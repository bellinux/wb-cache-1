5|$|Shortly {{after midnight}} on January 4, 1974—around {{the time that}} he {{terminated}} his relationship with Brooks—Bundy entered the basement apartment of 18-year-old Karen Sparks (identified as Joni Lenz, Mary Adams or Terri Caldwell by various sources), a dancer and student at UW. After bludgeoning the sleeping woman senseless with a metal rod from her <b>bed</b> <b>frame,</b> he sexually assaulted her with either the same rod, or a metal speculum, causing extensive internal injuries. She remained unconscious for 10 days, but survived with permanent disabilities. Less than a month later, {{in the early morning hours}} of February 1, Bundy broke into the basement room of Lynda Ann Healy, a UW undergraduate who broadcast morning radio weather reports for skiers. He beat her unconscious, dressed her in blue jeans, a white blouse, and boots, and carried her away.|$|E
5|$|Three {{companies}} of Pioneers {{were assigned to}} Barkas's command {{to carry out the}} physical work of making the thousands of dummies. They came respectively from East Africa, Mauritius and the Seychelles. One company worked the standard <b>bed</b> <b>frame</b> palm hurdles into the required shapes and fixed them together to make tank bodies, turrets and other dummy vehicle elements. The second company prepared hessian covers for the vehicle elements. The third company painted and prepared the dummies to the required degree of realism. Since the different Pioneer companies did not like one another, Barkas moved their camps as far apart as possible. To help maintain security, a NAAFI canteen was set up exclusively for the camouflage workers, to help keep everyone in camp.|$|E
5|$|It {{begins with}} a shot of Wade's face and the guitar introduction. He then sings {{the first line of}} lyrics, which is {{followed}} by a transition to a boy lying on a bed shirtless. As the video switches between Wade and the boy, it zooms on the <b>bed</b> <b>frame</b> (which has the same face from the album cover) and opens into another area. The boy is then seen walking around the new area looking around until he goes up nearby stairs. While going up the stairs, the video switches between shots of the boy going up the stairs and Wade singing the lyrics. Once up the stairs, the boy looks around and then walks into a bright light that he sees nearby. He walks through the bright archway into a dark room as the video switches to Lifehouse playing the song. After this, it switches to the boy as he looks up and the camera zooms out to reveal that he is in a giant maze. He then walks back where he came from to find that he is in a house with Lifehouse playing on the television. He then jumps off a window sill and appears tiny as he walks up to a book that is bigger than him. It then transitions to Lifehouse playing the song as the boy gets up on a chair which slowly transcends into his original bed. The video then zooms out on the boy lying on his bed and then switches to the band. It ends with the boy walking into darkness and Wade's face looking on the floor.|$|E

25|$|A Slide Away Bed {{is a type}} of {{sofa bed}} that slides to the wall to form a sofa. The {{mattress}} is hinged to form a seating surface and back support. The <b>bed</b> <b>frame</b> support is a telescoping frame that allows the bed platform to recess below the seating cushion. The primitive version of the slide away bed was co-invented by Manning Lane, Warren J. Hauck and Roy O. Sweeney of Cincinnati, Ohio. U.S. patent #4,204,287 was filed on September 5, 1978 and issued on May 27, 1980.|$|E
25|$|Bell is also {{credited}} with developing {{one of the}} early versions of a metal detector in 1881. The device was quickly put together in an attempt to find the bullet in the body of U.S. President James Garfield. According to some accounts, the metal detector worked flawlessly in tests but did not find the assassin's bullet partly because the metal <b>bed</b> <b>frame</b> on which the President was lying disturbed the instrument, resulting in static. The president's surgeons, who were skeptical of the device, ignored Bell's requests to move the president to a bed not fitted with metal springs. Alternatively, although Bell had detected a slight sound on his first test, the bullet may have been lodged too deeply to be detected by the crude apparatus.|$|E
25|$|The puritanical pastor leads {{confirmation}} {{classes and}} gives his pubescent children a guilty conscience over apparently small transgressions. He has them wear white ribbons {{as a reminder}} of the innocence and purity from which they have strayed. When under interrogation his son confesses to impure touching, the pastor has the boy’s hands tied to his <b>bed</b> <b>frame</b> each night. The doctor, a widower, treats the village children kindly but humiliates his housekeeper (the local midwife, with whom he is having sexual relations) and also sexually abuses his teenage daughter. The baron, who is the lord of the manor, underwrites harvest festivities for the villagers, many of them his farm workers. After his young son is abusively injured by unknown assailant(s), he summarily dismisses Eva for no apparent reason, yet defends the integrity of a farmer whose son in a symbolic act has destroyed the baron's field of cabbages.|$|E

25|$|Scott {{was driven}} to a beach cottage, where the rope around his ankles was {{loosened}} sufficiently to enable him to make steps. Ross and his partners walked him into the house, {{one of the men}} leading him on a nylon leash, another holding his handcuffs. Ross and his partners had made the house a virtual prison; the windows were covered with thick nylon straps forming a mesh, to prevent escape. The two doors to the room where he was held were guarded. His captors also took his shoes and fitted the room with motion detectors. According to Shupe and Darnell's (2006) account of court testimony, Scott demanded that he be allowed to leave, and asked Ross whether he would try to make him change his religious beliefs. Ross was said to have replied that that was what he was paid to do. When Scott threatened Ross with criminal prosecution, Ross was said to have threatened Scott that he would handcuff him to the <b>bed</b> <b>frame.</b>|$|E
500|$|The episode {{contains}} {{a number of}} other references. Sarah comments that she has [...] "finally" [...] watched Mannequin. Mary is later shown doing pull-ups from her <b>bed</b> <b>frame</b> in her prison cell, referencing the film , where Sarah Connor (also portrayed by Hamilton) did the same thing. While practicing his Italian accent, Morgan quotes video game character Mario's catchphrase [...] "It's me, Mario!" [...] Morgan later comments that buckets of acid are going {{to be used in the}} same way as on Breaking Bad, recommending the series to Casey.|$|E
500|$|Soon afterward, Barton is {{visited by}} two police detectives, who inform him that Charlie's {{real name is}} Karl [...] "Madman" [...] Mundt. Mundt is a serial killer wanted for several murders; after {{shooting}} his victims, they explain, he decapitates them and keeps the heads. Stunned, Barton returns {{to his room and}} examines the box. Placing it on his desk without opening it, he begins writing and produces the entire script in one sitting. After a night of celebratory dancing, Barton returns to find the detectives in his room, who, after handcuffing Barton to the bed, reveal they've found evidence of Mundt's latest murders. Each of the men notes how hot it is, before Charlie as the hotel is engulfed in flames. Running through the hallway, screaming [...] "I'll show you the life of the mind!", Charlie shoots the policemen with a shotgun. As the hallway burns, Charlie speaks with Barton about their lives and the hotel, breaks the <b>bed</b> <b>frame</b> to which Barton is handcuffed (thus freeing him), then retires to his own room, saying as he goes that he paid a visit to Barton's parents and uncle in New York. Barton leaves the still-burning hotel, carrying the box and his script. Shortly thereafter he attempts to telephone his family, but there is no answer.|$|E
5000|$|Modern {{manufacturing}} conventions {{have produced}} many standard mattress and box spring sizes. Beds vary by {{country of origin}} as per the table below. These dimensions are for the mattress - actual <b>bed</b> <b>frames</b> are a little larger to accommodate the mattress. Mattress thickness varies considerably.|$|R
5000|$|It {{is worth}} noting that [...] "bed size" [...] in the UK {{generally}} refers to mattress size. This is because mattresses have a standard size grading, whereas <b>bed</b> <b>frames</b> do not. While many companies in the UK do offer bespoke bed making services, most mass-produced <b>bed</b> linens, <b>bed</b> <b>frames</b> and mattresses fit only the standard bed sizes above. It should be noted that a Queen size mattress in the UK is often misunderstood {{to be one of the}} larger sizes as is the case in many other parts of the world. However, at 120cm in width, it is smaller than a UK double. Another common mistake is to use a mattress size as the required space for the full dimensions of the bed and mattress.|$|R
50|$|John Hemmings {{had some}} {{woodworking}} signatures that help distinguish his work {{from that of}} other workers at the Monticello Joinery.

2500|$|On May 25, 2012, an 11-minute video titled 1 Lunatic 1 Ice Pick was {{uploaded}} to Bestgore.com, {{depicting a}} naked male {{tied to a}} <b>bed</b> <b>frame</b> being repeatedly stabbed with an ice pick and a kitchen knife, then dismembered, followed by acts of necrophilia. The perpetrator uses a knife and fork to cut {{off some of the}} flesh and gets a dog to chew on the body. During the video, the 1987 New Order song [...] "True Faith" [...] plays in the background, and a poster for the 1942 film Casablanca is visible on the wall. Canadian authorities obtained a [...] "more extensive" [...] version of the video and said cannibalism may have been performed.

2500|$|Beginning on November 9, 2005, Abramović {{presented}} Seven Easy Pieces at the Guggenheim Museum in New York City. On seven consecutive nights {{for seven}} hours she recreated {{the works of}} five artists first performed in the '60s and '70s, in addition to re-performing her own Lips of Thomas and introducing a new performance on the last night. The performances were arduous, requiring both the physical and the mental concentration of the artist. [...] Included in Abramović's performances were recreations of Gina Pane's Self-Portraits, which required lying on a <b>bed</b> <b>frame</b> suspended over a grid of lit candles, and of Vito Acconci's 1972 performance in which the artist masturbated under the floorboards of a gallery as visitors walked overhead. It is argued that Abramović re-performed these works {{as a series of}} homages to the past, though many of the performances were altered from their originals.|$|E
2500|$|In {{an effort}} to relieve the sick man from {{the heat of a}} Washington summer, Navy {{engineers}} rigged up an early version of the modern air conditioner. Fans blew air over a large box of ice and into the President's sickroom; the device worked well enough to lower the temperature twenty degrees. Doctors continued to probe Garfield's wound with dirty, unsterilized fingers and instruments, attempting to find the location of the bullet. Alexander Graham Bell devised a metal detector specifically for the purpose of finding the bullet lodged inside Garfield. [...] He was unsuccessful, partly because Garfield's metal <b>bed</b> <b>frame</b> made the instrument malfunction, and partly because Bliss allowed Bell to use the device only on Garfield's right side, where Bliss insisted the bullet had lodged. Bell's subsequent tests indicated that his metal detector was in good working order, and that he would have found the bullet had he been allowed to use the device on Garfield's left side.|$|E
