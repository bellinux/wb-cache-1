50|$|Non-obese {{diabetic}} or NOD mice, {{like the}} <b>Biobreeding</b> <b>rat,</b> {{are used as}} an animal model for type 1 diabetes. Diabetes develops in NOD mice {{as a result of}} insulitis, a leukocytic infiltrate of the pancreatic islets. Onset of diabetes is associated with a moderate glycosuria and a non-fasting hyperglycemia. It is recommended to monitor for development of glycosuria from 10 weeks of age; this can be carried out using urine glucose dipsticks. NOD mice will develop spontaneous diabetes when left in a sterile environment. The incidence of spontaneous diabetes in the NOD mouse is 60-80% in females and 20-30% in males. Onset of diabetes also varies between males and females: commonly, onset is delayed in males by several weeks.|$|E
40|$|CONTEXT: Type 1 {{diabetes}} mellitus is a T cell mediated autoimmune disease with no known methods of prevention. The <b>BioBreeding</b> <b>rat</b> {{is used as}} an animal model {{for the study of}} human Type 1 diabetes. In spite of a severe lymphopenia, these animals develop spontaneous diabetes at the age of 10 - 12 weeks. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether anti-inflammatory gene therapy could be used to prevent autoimmune diabetes in the <b>BioBreeding</b> <b>rat.</b> DESIGN: A retroviral DNA vector, MSCVneo. IL- 4, carrying the DNA sequence encoding the rat interleukin- 4, was designed to transfer interleukin- 4 to BioBreeding rats. Spleen cells of prediabetic animals were activated and transduced in vitro with replication-defective retroviruses expressing the MSCVneo. IL- 4 vector. These lymphocytes were subsequently administered intraperitoneally to 3 - 4 week old prediabetic BioBreeding rats. Control animals were reconstituted with spleen cells transduced with MSCVneo vector. RESULTS: The neo gene marker was detectable by RT-PCR in rat spleen cells of up to 6 to 12 months after treatment. Fifty percent (6 out of 12) of the animals treated were protected from autoimmune disease development. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the <b>BioBreeding</b> <b>rat</b> {{can be used as a}} useful model to develop gene therapy regimens for diabetes. These studies provide further support for the hypothesis that interleukin- 4 based gene therapy may have potential clinical value for preventing autoimmune diabetes in humans...|$|E
40|$|Background It remains {{controversial}} whether {{avoidance of}} dietary diabetogenic triggers, such as cow's milk proteins, can prevent {{type 1 diabetes}} in genetically susceptible individuals. Here, different extensive casein hydrolysates (HC) and single amino acid (AA) formulations were tested for their effect on mechanisms underlying autoimmune diabetes pathogenesis in diabetes-prone <b>BioBreeding</b> <b>rats.</b> Intestinal integrity, gut microbiota composition and mucosal immune reactivity were studies to assess whether these formulations have differential effects in autoimmune diabetes prevention. Methods Diabetes-prone <b>BioBreeding</b> <b>rats</b> received diets in which the protein fraction was exchanged for the different hydrolysates or AA compositions, starting from weaning {{until the end of}} the experiment (d 150). Diabetes development was monitored, and faecal and ileal samples were collected. Gut microbiota composition and cytokine/tight junction mRNA expression were measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Cytokine levels of ileum explant cultures were measured by ELISA, and intestinal permeability was measured in vivo by lactulose-mannitol assay. Results Both HC-diet fed groups revealed remarkable reduction of diabetes incidence with the most pronounced effect in Nutramigen (R) -fed animals. Interestingly, AA-fed rats only showed delayed autoimmune diabetes development. Furthermore, both HC-fed groups had improved intestinal barrier function when compared with control chow or AA-fed animals. Interestingly, higher IL- 10 levels were measured in ileum tissue explants from Nutramigen (R) -fed rats. Beneficial gut microbiota changes (increased Lactobacilli and reduced Bacteroides spp. levels) were found associated especially with HC-diet interventions. Conclusions Casein hydrolysates were found superior to AA-mix in autoimmune diabetes prevention. This suggests the presence of specific peptides that beneficially affect mechanisms that may play a critical role in autoimmune diabetes pathogenesis. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

Most class I molecules are membrane bound, but mouse and rat cDNA clones and genes without a functional code for the transmembrane amino acids have been identified. The membrane-associated class I molecules are important in the control of cell-mediated cytotoxicity, while {{the function of the}} soluble molecules remains unclear. Previous studies have shown that beta 2 m circulates in rat serum in three different molecular weight classes. The first is free beta 2 m (Mr, 12, 000), the second is about Mr 70, 000, and the third is roughly Mr 200, 000. In an inbred subline of immunodeficient, diabetes-prone <b>BioBreeding</b> <b>rats</b> (BioBreeding/Hagedorn), previous work detected two restriction fragment polymorphisms in class I major histocompatibility complex genes, one of them a gene deletion on a 7 -kilobase BamHI fragment and the other on a 2 -kilobase BamHI fragment.

40|$|Type 1 {{diabetes}} {{is associated with}} abberations of fat metabolism {{before and after the}} clinical onset of disease. It has been hypothesized that the absence of the effect of insulin in the liver contributes to reduced hepatic fat synthesis. We measured hepatic gene expression and serum metabolites before and after the onset of hyperglycemia in a <b>BioBreeding</b> <b>rat</b> model of type 1 diabetes. Functional pathway annotation identified that lipid metabolism was differentially expressed in hyperglycemic rats and that these pathways significantly overlapped with genes regulated by insulin. 17 serum metabolites significantly changed in concentration. All but 2 of the identified metabolites had previously been reported in type 1 diabetes, and carbohydrates were overall the most upregulated class of metabolites. We conclude that lack of insulin in the liver contributes to the changes in fat metabolism observed in type 1 diabetes.

40|$|The BB (<b>BioBreeding)</b> <b>rat</b> {{is one of}} {{the best}} models of {{spontaneous}} autoimmune diabetes and is used to study non-MHC loci contributing to Type 1 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes in the diabetes-prone BB (BBDP) rat is polygenic, dependent upon mutations at several loci. Iddm 1, on chromosome 4, is responsible for a lymphopenia (lyp) phenotype and is essential to diabetes. In this study, we report the positional cloning of the Iddm 1 /lyp locus. We show that lymphopenia is due to a frameshift deletion in a novel member (Ian 5) of the Immune-Associated Nucleotide (IAN) -related gene family, resulting in truncation of a significant portion of the protein. This mutation was absent in 37 other inbred rat strains that are nonlymphopenic and nondiabetic.

T-cell-mediated destruction of beta-cells is a characteristic feature of autoimmune (Type 1) diabetes. Here we explore the ability of PKC inhibition, using the PKC inhibitor AEB- 071 (AEB), to reduce disease in two animal models of spontaneous autoimmune diabetes (non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse and <b>biobreeding</b> <b>rat</b> (BB)). NOD mice were treated with AEB for 4 weeks, starting at either 4 weeks of age (prior {{to the development of}} insulitis) or at 8 weeks of age, once insulitis is present. Animals treated with AEB during the effector phase of the disease (treatment onset at 8 weeks of age), showed a 2 -week delay in diabetes onset (p < 0. 05). In these animals, the extent of insulitis was lower than in vehicle-treated controls; however, neither serum autoimmune anti-GAD 65 antibody levels nor pancreatic insulin content were different between experimental groups. Overall, inhibition of PKC can mildly reduce lymphocytic infiltrate of pancreatic islets and modestly delay onset of autoimmune diabetes in NOD mice.

40|$|Progression of {{diabetic}} nephropathy appears {{directly related to}} renal tubulointerstitial injury, but the involved genes are incompletely delineated. To identify such genes, DNA microarray analysis was performed with RNA from renal proximal tubules (RPTs) of streptozotocin-induced diabetic Wistar <b>rats,</b> spontaneously diabetic <b>BioBreeding</b> <b>rats,</b> and rat immortalized renal proximal tubular cells (IRPTCs) exposed to high glucose (25 mM) medium for 2 weeks. Osteopontin (OPN) mRNA expression was quantified by real time-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) or conventional reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). OPN mRNA expression was upregulated (5 – 70 -fold increase) in diabetic rat RPTs and in IRPTCs chronically exposed to high glucose compared to control RPTs and IRPTCs. High glucose, angiotensin II, phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β 1) stimulated OPN mRNA expression in IRPTCs in a dose- and time-dependent manner. This effect was inhibited by tiron, taurine, diphenylene iodinium, losartan, perindopril, calphostin C, or LY 379196 but not PD 123319. IRPTCs overexpressing dominant-negative protein kinase C-beta 1 (PKC-β 1) cDNA or antisense TGF-β 1 cDNA prevented the high glucose effect on OPN mRNA expression. We concluded that high glucose-mediated increases in OPN gene expression in diabetic rat RPTs and IRPTCs are mediated, at least in part, via reactive oxygen species generation, intrarenal rennin–angiotensin system activation, TGF-β 1 expression, and PKC-β 1 signaling...|$|R

Cells that express RT 6 have an immunoregulatory {{function}} and modulate the expression of autoimmune diabetes mellitus in the <b>BioBreeding</b> <b>rat.</b> A homologue of the rat RT 6 gene, designated Rt 6, has been identified in the mouse, but expression of mouse Rt 6 protein has not been documented. Rat RT 6 is known to be a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) glycohydrolase. We now report that rat RT 6. 2 and recombinant mouse Rt 6 locus 1 proteins possess auto-ADP ribosylation activity. In addition, mouse Rt 6 but not rat RT 6, catalyzes the ADP ribosylation of exogenous acceptors such as histones. The ADP-ribosyl-protein bonds in auto-ADP-ribosylated rat RT 6. 2, auto-ADP-ribosylated mouse Rt 6, and ADP-ribosylhistone synthesized by Rt 6 were stable to HgCl 2 and HCl, but labile to NH 2 OH, consistent with ADP ribosylarginine linkages. To determine if these enzymatic activities could affect the function of rat T cells, the effect of substrate availability on lymphocyte proliferation was examined. An inverse correlation was observed between NAD+ concentration in the medium and the ability of rat T cells to respond to anti-CD 3, ConA, and PMA plus ionomycin.

A strong {{indication}} of this is found in the diabetes-prone <b>BioBreeding</b> <b>rat</b> (BBDP), where a frameshift mutation in Gimap 5 results in T-cell lymphopenia. We have investigated the function of human Gimap 5 in T cells. We found that reduction of Gimap 5 by RNA interference in Jurkat cells did not affect the number of apoptotic cells whereas transient over-expression of Gimap 5 resulted in a major {{increase in the number of}} apoptotic cells. The same effect of over-expression was found in naive human T cells purified from blood but not in activated human T cells. This suggests that the apoptosis-inducing effect of Gimap 5 over-expression is dependent on the activation status of the cells. Since the apoptosis-inducing effect of Gimap 5 was contrary to the expected function of Gimap 5 based on the phenotype of BBDP rats, we over-expressed rat wt Gimap 5 and Gimap 5 with the mutation found in BBDP (Gimap 5 -lyp). Both versions of rat Gimap 5 induced apoptosis when expressed in the rat T-cell line C 58 (NT) D. 1. G. OVAR. 1, however, Gimap 5 -lyp greatly exacerbated cell death.

40|$|Background: The {{intestinal}} epithelium is {{a barrier}} that composes {{one of the most}} immunologically active surfaces of the body due to constant exposure to microorganisms as well as an infinite diversity of food antigens. Disruption of intestinal barrier function and aberrant mucosal immune activation have been implicated in a variety of diseases within and outside of the gastrointestinal tract. With this model in mind, recent studies have shown a link between diet, composition of intestinal microbiota, and type 1 diabetes pathogenesis. In the <b>BioBreeding</b> <b>rat</b> model of type 1 diabetes, comparison of the intestinal microbial composition of diabetes prone and diabetes resistant animals found Lactobacillus species were negatively correlated with type 1 diabetes development. Two species, Lactobacillus johnsonii and L. reuteri, were isolated from diabetes resistant rats.

Methodology/Principal: Findings Results Rats administered L. johnsonii, but not L. reuteri, post-weaning developed type 1 diabetes at a protracted rate. Analysis of the intestinal ileum showed administration of L. johnsonii induced changes in the native microbiota, host mucosal proteins, and host oxidative stress response.

In this report we show that a detectable percentage of CD 8 + lymphocytes express the T-cell receptor for antigen, thus identifying them as part of the T-cell lineage. The failure of these CD 8 + T-cell-receptor-positive T cells to lyse target cells that are susceptible to T-cell mediated cytotoxicity is associated with markedly reduced expression of cell-surface CD 8. Targets expressing higher than normal levels of class I major histocompatibility complex target antigen could be lysed, suggesting that reduction in CD 8 has decreased T-cell activity for target antigen.

40|$|A better {{understanding}} of pathogenic mechanisms is {{required in order to}} treat diseases. However, the mechanisms of diabetes mellitus and diabetic complications are extremely complex. Immune reactions are involved in the pathogenesis of diabetes and its complications, while diabetes influences immune reactions. Furthermore, both diabetes and immune reactions are influenced by genetic and environmental factors. To address these issues, animal models are useful tools. So far, various animal models of diabetes have been developed in rats, which have advantages over mice models in terms of the larger volume of tissue samples and the variety of type 2 diabetes models. In this review, we introduce rat models of diabetes and summarize the immune reactions in diabetic rat models. Finally, we speculate on the relationship between immune reactions and diabetic episodes. For example, diabetes-prone <b>Biobreeding</b> <b>rats,</b> type 1 diabetes model rats, exhibit increased autoreactive cellular and inflammatory immune reactions, while Goto-Kakizaki rats, type 2 diabetes model rats, exhibit increased Th 2 reactions and attenuation of phagocytic activity. Investigation of immunological abnormalities in various diabetic rat models is useful for elucidating complicated mechanisms in the pathophysiology of diabetes.

The dietary impact on the composition of the cecal microbiota was determined by the generation of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) profiles of PCR-amplified 16 S rRNA gene sequences. The DGGE profiles produced from the cecal microbiota of rats within each dietary group were similar, but consensus profiles generated from pooled bacterial DNAs showed differences between rat groups. Animals fed HV glucans (HV-fed rats) had DGGE consensus profiles that were 30 % dissimilar from those of the other rat groups. A 16 S rRNA gene fragment that was more conspicuous in the profiles of HV-fed animals than in those of cellulose-fed rats had sequence identity with Lactobacillus acidophilus. Measurements of L. acidophilus rRNA abundance (DNA-RNA hybridization), the preparation of cloned 16 S rRNA gene libraries, and the enumeration of Lactobacillus cells (fluorescent in situ hybridization) showed that lactobacilli formed a greater proportion of the cecal microbiota in HV-fed rats.

Initial scans of allelic association were followed by more detailed logistic regression modeling that adjusted for known type I diabetes risk factors and potential confounding variables. The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs 6598, located in a polyadenylation signal of GIMAP 5, was associated with the presence of significant levels of IA- 2 autoantibodies in the type I diabetes patients. Patients with the minor allele A of rs 6598 had an increased prevalence of IA- 2 autoantibody levels compared to patients without the minor allele (OR= 2. 2; Bonferroni-corrected P= 0. 003), after adjusting for age at clinical onset (P= 8. 0 times 10 - 13) and the numbers of HLA-DQ A 1 * 0501 -B 1 * 0201 haplotypes (P= 2. 4 times 10 - 5) and DQ A 1 * 0301 -B 1 * 0302 haplotypes (P= 0. 002). GIMAP 5 polymorphism was not associated with type I diabetes or with GAD 65 or insulin autoantibodies, ICA, or age at clinical onset in patients.

40|$|The <b>BioBreeding</b> <b>rat</b> {{develops}} a spontaneous syndrome resembling human type I diabetes mellitus. Salient features include abrupt onset of insulin depend-ent, ketosis-prone diabetes between 60 - 120 d of age (1); lymphocytic insulitis with virtually complete destruction of pancreatic,Q cells (2, 3); and genetic predisposition and occurrence of hyperglycemia {{in the majority}} of inbred Bio-Breeding/Worcester (BB/Wor) ' animals (4). Support for an immune pathogenesis of BB/Wor diabetes is derived from the following lines of evidence: lymphocytic insulitis before and during the acute phase of hyperglycemia (1 - 3); ability to adoptively transfer diabetes with injec-tions of Con-A stimulated diabetic spleen cells (5, 6); MHC-linked susceptibility to diabetes (7); apparent presence ofantibodies against islet cell surface molecules in diabetic and diabetes-prone animals (8); prevention of diabetes by neonatal thymectomy and immune suppression (9 - 14); prevention of diabetes by immune enhancement measures that correct the rats ' immune incompetence (15 - 18). The precise phenotypic identification of the effector cells that mediate final destruction of the pancreatic # cells has not been accomplished. Although lymphocytes and macrophages infiltrate the pancreatic islets, and la ' macro-phages are numerous (2, 19, 20), the functional role and specificity of these inflammatory cells is uncertain, since animals protected from diabetes by most immune-suppressive measures (9 - 11, 13) frequently show histologic evidence of lymphocytic insulitis despite the presence of normal plasma glucose levels.

40|$|Functional {{gastrointestinal}} disorders (FGID) such as {{irritable bowel syndrome}} (IBS) {{and functional}} dyspepsia (FD) are characterized by bothersome gastrointestinal complaints {{in the absence of}} an organic, systemic or metabolic cause that is likely to explain the symptoms. Despite the high prevalence, the pathophysiology of this heterogeneous group of disorders is still elusive and reflected by the limited effectiveness of the few available treatment options. In the present PhD project we focused on the role of intestinal barrier function in the pathophysiology of FGID. Several groups have reported increased intestinal permeability not only in FGID, but also in organic gastrointestinal disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease. A plausible and popular working hypothesis for both functional and organic intestinal disorders is that increased penetration of food- and bacteria-derived antigens from the intestinal lumen incites a low-grade immune activation in the gastrointestinal tract, which in the case of FGID is characterized by an increased presence and/or activity of mast cells and eosinophils. Nonetheless, the evidence is merely associative and a cause-effect relation has never been demonstrated. A well-characterized animal model would fill in an unmet need in the functional gastrointestinal research field to better appreciate the role of the intestinal barrier function. Moreover, knowledge about the etiology of the intestinal barrier defect in FGID is limited. In the first part of the project, we have characterized the <b>BioBreeding</b> <b>rat</b> as a suitable model for FGID since it shares key pathophysiological features with human disease, i. e. increased intestinal permeability, low-grade intestinal inflammation and disturbed intestinal motility. We have described in detail the natural history of these events and demonstrated that the earliest demonstrable defect is an intestinal permeability defect that preceded a progressive immune activation, which ultimately resulted in invasion of the enteric nervous system with a motility disorder of the intestine due to loss of nitrergic neurons. We also showed that the inflammatory reaction was predominated by an infiltration of mast cells and eosinophils. Unfortunately, we were not successful in normalizing the early permeability defect with larazotide, a recently developed regulator of intestinal permeability. Altogether, our data identify the <b>BioBreeding</b> <b>rat</b> as a promising model to study the pathophysiology of FGID and to help advancing preclinical drug development for FGID. Subsequently we have investigated possible mechanisms for the observed intestinal barrier defect in FGID. The first possible candidate was psychological stress. In animal models, stress has been shown to cause low-grade intestinal inflammation through the induction of intestinal hyperpermeability, but data in humans were lacking. We performed a study in healthy volunteers and provided the first evidence of increased intestinal permeability during public speech as a model for psychological stress in humans. This effect could be reproduced by administration of corticotropin-releasing hormone and was blocked by mast cell stabilization. This study provides a possible mechanism why psychological stress affects symptom severity and disease course, both in FGID and inflammatory bowel disease. Subsequently, in an animal model of chronic social stress, we showed a synergistic effect of acute and chronic stress on the colonic barrier function and investigated changes of the expression of proteins involved in mucosal integrity. Finally, we reported an increased susceptibility of the distal compared to the proximal small intestine to stress-induced hyperpermeability, possibly related to the higher bacterial load in this part of the intestine. A second candidate as a contributor to impaired barrier function in FGID, was acid. Increased presence of acid in the duodenum has been suggested to be involved in symptom generation in a subgroup of FD patients through the induction of a reflex with gastric relaxation and hypersensitivity to distention of the stomach. In healthy volunteers, we showed that perfusion of the duodenum with acid gives rise to increased intestinal permeability and activation of mast cells. In two more mechanistic studies we have explored the contribution of two pathways, one mediated through the 5 -HT 3 receptor and one through nerve endings immediately below the epithelium of the duodenum. We showed that blocking the 5 -HT 3 receptor decreased the sensitivity of the stomach after duodenal acid perfusion and that blocking the superficial nerve endings attenuated the acid-induced gastric relaxation. In the final part of the PhD project, we investigated how the stem and progenitor cells of the gut contribute to the barrier function. We studied a parasite infection model in mice and found that miR- 365, a regulator of gene expression, is involved in the regulation of the stem cell compartment to maintain the barrier upon infection. status: publishe...|$|E

Two separate cross sectional and prospective (blood samples collected at 45 d, 70 d and 149 d or at diagnosis) studies were carried out. Western blotting results in both studies confirmed that high S 10 reactivity in the pre-diabetic period was associated with diabetes. Overall Western blot analyses showed interestingly that two soy protein-fractions, S 6 and S 13, were related to resistance and reactivity against these two fractions may be protective and the S 10 soy protein fraction appears to be highly diabetes-related and associated with diabetes. In studies using human serum, two sets of blood samples from newly diagnosed diabetic children showed the same association for the S 10 soy protein fraction. Early oral dosing with soybean meal delayed the onset of diabetes and protected some of the animals from developing the disease.

40|$|Type 1 {{diabetes}} (T 1 D) {{is characterized}} by selective autoimmune destruction of the insulin producing beta-cells in the islets of Langerhans. When the beta-cells are destroyed exogenous administration of insulin is necessary for maintenance of glucose homeostasis.

Changes in protein expression pattern during spontaneous diabetes development in the diabetes prone <b>BioBreeding</b> <b>rat</b> (BB-DP) have previously been described. In the present study, we have investigated if any of the changes seen in the protein expression pattern during spontaneous diabetes development are also present during allograft rejection of BB-DP rat islets. Two hundred neonatal islets were syngeneically transplanted under the kidney capsule of 30 day old BB-DP rats and removed prior to and at onset of diabetes. Allogeneically transplanted islets from BB-DP rats were removed before onset of allograft rejection and at maximal islet graft inflammation (rejection). The protein expression profiles of the transplants were visualised by two-dimensional gel (2 -DG) electrophoresis, analysed and compared. In total, 2590 protein spots were visualised and of these 310 changed expression (p < 0. 01) in syngeneic islet transplants in the BB-DP rats from 7 days after transplantation until onset of diabetes. In BB-DP islets transplanted to WK rats 53 protein spots (p < 0. 01) showed changes in expression when comparing islet grafts removed 7 days after transplantation with islet grafts removed 12 days after transplantation where mononuclear cell infiltration is at its maximum. Only four protein spots (1 %) were significantly changed in both syngeneic (autoimmune) and allogeneic islet destruction. When comparing protein expression changes in syngeneic BB-DP islet transplants from 37 days after transplantation to onset of diabetes with protein expression changes in allografts from day 7 to 12 after transplantation only three spot were found to commonly change expression in both situations. In conclusion, a large number of protein expression changes were detected in both autoimmune islet destruction and allogeneic islet rejection, only two overlaps were detected, suggesting that autoimmune islet destruction and allogeneic islet rejection may result from different target cell responses to signals induced by the cellular infiltrate. Whether this reflects activation of distinct signalling pathways in islet cells is currently unknown and need to be further investigated...|$|E
40|$|Background Alterations in rat's nerve {{collagens}} due {{to diabetes}} {{may be related}} to the permanence of damage due to diabetic neuropathy. We (1) provide a methodology for determining the diameters of collagen fibers accounting for atomic force microscope (AFM) imaging artifacts, (2) present data on structural differences in sciatic nerve endoneurial, epineurial and tail tendon collagens of control and diabetic Sprague–Dawley and <b>BioBreeding</b> <b>rats,</b> and (3) compare results with literature values. Methods We measured collagen diameters and band spacing on endoneurial and epineurial sciatic nerve tissue, and tail tendon, in control and diabetic rats (STZ-induced 12 -week diabetic SD and 16 -week spontaneously diabetic BB rats). We also developed a model to interpret the raw AFM data. Results All types of fibrillar collagen diameters studied became larger for diabetic versus control animals. Values for diabetic and control collagen fiber diameters in SD rats were 78 nm and 72 nm for SN epineurium, and 49 nm and 43 nm for SN endoneurium. For diabetic and control BB rats, these values were 83 nm and 77 nm (SN epineurium) and 49 nm and 43 nm (SN endoneurium). Values of 161 nm and 125 nm were found for diabetic and control tail tendon of BB rats. No significant changes were observed in any of the five comparisons made in D-band spacings that ranged from 63 to 69 nm. Conclusions The best means we have found to reduce raw AFM data is to measure several diameters with a single scan, using valley-to-valley measurements. Structural, fibrillar collagens of the nerve and tendon become larger in rats exposed to prolonged diabetes. Copyright © 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

40|$|Type 1 {{diabetes}} mellitus is a classical {{example of a}} T-cell-mediated autoimmune disease. Several aberrations in immune regulation have been described in both human diabetes patients and animal models of type 1 diabetes.

Macroscopic clinical evidence of type II collagen-induced ar-thritis (CIA) first appeared as periarticular erythema and edema in the hind paws between days 9 and 1 0 postimmunization with CII. The incidence of CIA was 100 % by day 11 in the CII-challenged rats; and CIA severity progressed over a 28 -day period with radiographic evaluation revealing focal resorption of bone together with osteophyte {{formation in the}} tibiotarsal joint and soft tissue swelling. The histopathology of CIA included an hyperplastic synovium that invaded and eroded articular carti-lage at the joint margins, and subchondral bone resorption associated with bone-derived, multinucleated cell-containing granulomatous lesions in the rat hind paw.

Underlying pathogenetic mechanisms are not fully understood {{partly due to the}} lack of a relevant animal model to study the effect(s) of long-term autoimmune diabetes on development of in-stent restenosis. We here describe the development of in-stent restenosis in long-term (~ 7 months) spontaneously diabetic and age-matched, thymectomized, nondiabetic Diabetes Prone <b>BioBreeding</b> (BBDP) <b>rats</b> (n = 6 - 7 in each group). Diabetes was suboptimally treated with insulin and was characterized by significant hyperglycaemia, polyuria, proteinuria, and increased HbA 1 c levels.

Computerized morphometric analysis revealed significantly increased neointima formation in long-term diabetic rats compared with nondiabetic controls. In conclusion, long-term autoimmune diabetes in BBDP rats enhances in-stent restenosis.

40|$|Type 1 {{diabetes}} (T 1 D) is an autoimmune disorder, {{targeting the}} β-cells of the pancreas. Processes {{occurring in the}} gut and pancreas are inferred to be involved. The pre-diabetic expression signature in these tissues is largely uncharacterized. HYPOTHESIS: Spontaneous models of T 1 D, the LEW. 1 AR 1 /Ztm-iddm <b>rat</b> (LEW-DP) and <b>BioBreeding</b> diabetes-prone <b>rat</b> (BBdp) exhibit a distinct transcriptional signature prior to T 1 D onset. Transcriptional profiling was used to elucidate the expression signatures of the LEW-DP gut and BBdp pancreas. The LEW-DP gut displayed decreased expression of markers of anti-inflammatory M 2 macrophages. The LEW-DP rats showed an upregulation of markers of pro-inflammatory signaling when fed a diabetes-promoting cereal diet compared with LEW-DP rats fed a protective hydrolyzed casein diet. Prospective pancreatectomy was used to analyze T 1 D development in the BBdp rat. Significant upregulation of β-cell markers Reg 3 α, Reg 3 β, and Trim 26 was observed in pre-diabetic rats. Thus, it was shown that environment modifies the transcriptional program and the transcriptional profile is programmed early to affect T 1 D development...|$|R
40|$|Endothelial cells (EC) from {{diabetic}} <b>BioBreeding</b> (BB) <b>rats</b> have an impaired {{ability to}} produce NO. This deficiency is not due to a defect in the constitutive isoform of NO synthase in EC (ecNOS) or alterations in intracellular calcium, calmodulin, NADPH or arginine levels. Instead, ecNOS cannot produce sufficient NO because of a deficiency in tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4)), a cofactor necessary for enzyme activity. EC from diabetic rats exhibited only 12 % of the BH(4) levels found in EC from normal animals or diabetes-prone animals which did not develop disease. As a result, NO synthesis by EC of diabetic rats was only 18 % of that for normal animals. Increasing BH(4) levels with sepiapterin increased NO production, suggesting that BH(4) deficiency is a metabolic basis for impaired endothelial NO synthesis in diabetic BB rats. This deficiency is due to decreased activity of GTP-cyclohydrolase I, the first and rate-limiting enzyme in the de novo biosynthesis of BH(4). GTP-cyclohydrolase activity was low because of a decreased expression of the protein in the diabetic cells...|$|R
40|$|Dietary {{factors have}} been {{reported}} to affect the development of spontaneous diabetes in various colonies of inbred and outbred diabetes-prone (DP) <b>BioBreeding</b> (BB) <b>rats.</b> Several studies have attributed a protective effect to a diet omitting crude protein mixtures in favor of purified casein, hydrolyzed casein, or free amino acids. We have used inbred BB rats, all of which become diabetic in specific pathogen-free (SPF) conditions when fed ordinary rat chow, to test the capacity of 2 different protein-free diets to modulate BB rat diabetes in 2 distinct pathogen-free environments. BB rats known to all develop diabetes by 100 days of age were fed from birth with 1 of 3 diets. By 120 days of age, 100 % of the animals on a standard diabetogenic chow diet, 83 % of animals on an amino acid-based protein-free diet, and 100 % of animals on a hydrolyzed casein-based diet had developed diabetes (P >. 05).

Vagal neuropathy, hyperglycemia, and alter-ations in the myenteric plexus have been proposed as underlying mechanism. We therefore studied the relationship between vagal function, gastrointestinal motiliy and characteristics of the enteric nervous system in the <b>biobreeding</b> (BB) <b>rat</b> known as model for spontaneous type 1 diabetes. Methods Gastric emptying breath test, small intestinal electromyography, relative risk-interval variability, histology and immunohistoche-mistry on antral and jejunal segments were performed at 1, 8 and 16 weeks after diabetes onset and on age-matched controls. Results We observed no consistent changes in relative risk-interval variability and gastric emptying rate. There was however, a loss of phases 3 with longer duration of diabetes on small intestinal electromyography. We found a progressive decrease of nitrergic neurons in the myenteric plexus of antrum and jejunum, while numbers of cholinergic nerve were not altered. In addition, a transient inflammatory infiltrate in jejunal wall was found in spontaneous diabetic BB rats at 8 weeks of diabetes.
