40|$|Understanding {{host plant}} {{volatile}} – aphid interactions can facilitate {{the selection of}} crop <b>border</b> <b>plants</b> as a strategy to reduce plant virus incidence in crops. Crop <b>border</b> <b>plant</b> species with attractive odours {{could be used to}} attract aphids into the border crop and away from the main crop. As different cultivars of the same crop can vary in their olfactory attractiveness to aphids, selecting an attractive cultivar as a border crop is important to increase aphid landing rates. This study evaluated olfactory responses of the bird cherry-oat aphid, Rhopalosiphum padi (L.) (Hemiptera: Aphididae), to three cultivars each of maize [Zea mays L. (Poaceae) ], potato [Solanum tuberosum L. (Solanaceae) ], and wheat [Triticumaestivum L. (Poaceae) ] with the aim of selecting an attractive crop <b>border</b> <b>plant</b> to reduce the incidence of the non-persistent Potato virus Y [PVY (Potyviridae) ] in seed potatoes. Volatiles emitted by the crop cultivars were collected and identified using coupled gas chromatography/ mass spectrometry. Quantitative and qualitative differences were found among cultivars. Behavioural responses of alate R. padi to odours of the cultivars and synthetic compounds identified from the plants were determined with a four-arm olfactometer. Rhopalosiphum padi was attracted to odours emitted from maize cultivar 6 Q- 121, but did not respond to odours from the remaining eight crop cultivars. Volatile compounds from maize and wheat cultivars that elicited a behavioural response from R. padi and contributed to differences in plant volatile profiles included (Z) - 3 -hexenyl acetate (attractant) and a-farnesene, (E) - 2 -hexenal, indole, and (3 E, 7 E) - 4, 8, 12 -trimethyltrideca- 1, 3, 7, 11 -tetraene (TMTT) (repellents). We conclude that maize cv. 6 Q- 121 is potentially suitable as a crop <b>border</b> <b>plant</b> based on the behavioural response of R. padi to the olfactory cues emitted by this cultivar. The findings provide insight into selecting crop cultivars capable of attracting R. padi to crop <b>border</b> <b>plants.</b> National Research Foundation (NRF), the University of Pretoria and the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research (MISTRA) through the Plant-ComMistra programme.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, a <b>Border</b> <b>Planting</b> (BP) pattern {{recommended}} by the Bangladesh Agricultural Research Council was tested against Regular Planting (RP) to assess the effect, if any, on gross phytoplankton photosynthesis and shading. A Wide Planting (WP) pattern was {{also included in the}} trial, as an extreme case, to assess the level of photosynthesis that might be obtained if some of the rice yield was sacrificed. Three rice-planting treatments, each with four replicates, using the rice variety BR 16, were undertaken: (1) RP, 26 cm between rows N to S and E to W; (2) BP, 20 cm between rows N to S and alternately 21 cm and 36 cm between rows E, to W; and (3) WP, 66 cm between rows N to S and E to W. BP showed no advantage compared to RP, possibly because the rice variety used was short and thus produced relatively little shading. WP did show a benefit for phytoplankton photosynthesis, but this may not generate an increase in fish yield sufficient to justify the negative impact of rice production...|$|E
40|$|Agroforestry and Short Rotation Coppice (SRC), for {{timber and}} {{bioenergy}} wood production, {{are recognized as}} economically viable and sustainable as separate cropping systems under ideal growing conditions. Little is known about agricultural and ecological interactions which might occur combining them in a tree-based intercropping system. This mixed approach, called alley coppice, is currently investigated in an European research Project (www. agrocop. com), and has important advantages: (i) a regular income guaranteed from the SRC component; (ii) light competition between species can often improve the stem form of timber trees; (iii) timber trees can be planted at the final spacing, avoiding expensive thinning; (iv) SRC component protects young timber trees from wind/storm damage; (v) alley coppice {{is expected to have}} positive impacts on biodiversity, and reducing soil erosion. Three system designs are currently investigated: Simultaneous planting (SP); Lagged planting (LP) and <b>Border</b> <b>planting</b> (BP). In SP, timber and SRC components are planted in the same year; the key investigated factor is the distance between timber trees and the first SRC row, comparing 1, 2, 3 m in plantations in Ireland, Germany and Italy. A tree row width of three meters guaranteed satisfying growth rates of Sorbus and Pyrus timber trees in a mixture with 2 -yr SRC poplar (Populus spp) in Italy, improving timber wood quality. LP, with planting SRC under adult timber trees, is studied in France and Ireland, according to timber tree age, species and inter-row spacings. In France, light and water competition had significant effects on poplar SRC growth and yield according to the distance from the walnut trees. BP involves planting timber trees along the borders of SRC blocks. Experimental plantations were established in Ireland and Germany, with the aim of avoiding asymmetric light competition that might hamper stem form of timber trees. Guidelines for practitioners on alley coppice optimization will be provided {{at the end of the}} project...|$|E

Four experimental skin wounds, two in either side of the midline plane at the lumbar region were made, each was of 2. 5 cm length and 0. 5 cm depth. The experimental animals were studied under 6 Groups. A series of 50 and 30 % extracts of <b>border</b> <b>plant</b> (Aerva sanguinolenta), thankuni plant (Centella asiatica), antibiotic (Pronapen®) and saline were used in this experiment and these were applied twice daily to each wound.
