5|$|By 2000, Madonna {{was dating}} {{director}} Guy Ritchie, and {{was pregnant with}} their child. Wanting to distract herself from the media frenzy surrounding this news, Madonna concentrated {{on the development of}} her eighth studio album, Music. Buoyed up by the commercial success of 1998's Ray of Light album, she was keen on getting back to the studio to record new material. She was then introduced to French DJ and producer Mirwais Ahmadzaï. Madonna instantly liked his pitch-shifting, pulverizing rhythms and his utilization of acid <b>bass</b> <b>in</b> his songs.|$|E

He joined Queen in 1971 {{on the strength of}} his musical and electronic skills, particularly the home-made Deacy Amp which guitarist Brian May used to create guitar orchestras throughout Queen's career. From the third album, Sheer Heart Attack, onwards, he wrote at least one song per album, several of which became hits. As well as bass, Deacon played some guitar and keyboards on Queen's studio work, but was the only member never to sing on their records.|$|E

5|$|At the age {{of fifteen}} on 6 July 1957, McCartney met John Lennon and his band, the Quarrymen, at the St Peter's Church Hall fête in Woolton. The Quarrymen played a mix {{of rock and roll}} and skiffle, a type of popular music with jazz, blues and folk influences. Soon afterwards, the members of the band invited McCartney to join as a rhythm guitarist, and he formed a close working {{relationship}} with Lennon. Harrison joined in 1958 as lead guitarist, followed by Lennon's art school friend Stuart Sutcliffe on <b>bass,</b> <b>in</b> 1960. By May 1960 the band had tried several names, including Johnny and the Moondogs, Beatals and the Silver Beetles. They adopted the name the Beatles in August 1960 and recruited drummer Pete Best shortly before a five-engagement residency in Hamburg.|$|E

5|$|By the 1920s, in bottled form, Worthington {{was one of}} {{only three}} nationally {{distributed}} beer brands, alongside Bass and Guinness. Product rationalisation began after the Second World War and although Worthington occasionally overtook <b>Bass</b> <b>in</b> sales, the decision was taken to prioritise Bass products. Arthur Manners took the chairmanship of <b>Bass</b> <b>in</b> 1947, and was instrumental in driving the company forward. Brewing industry mergers from the late 1950s onwards damaged Worthington sales, as tied house ownership became increasingly concentrated with brewers intent on promoting their own products. At the same time, bottled beer sales suffered as drinkers in search of consistency opted for the new keg beers instead. In 1965, the original Worthington brewery was closed, although production of the Worthington beers continued, consisting of White Shield, Green Shield (a filtered version of White Shield) and the draught product, E. Worthington E became the main keg bitter offered by Bass from 1967, and it had become a leading bitter brand by the 1970s, boosted by the company's network of 11,000 public houses. Worthington E was replaced as Bass' leading keg bitter by Worthington Best Bitter in the 1980s, and by Worthington Smoothflow from the mid-1990s. In 2000, Bass was bought by the Belgian brewer Interbrew. The Competition Commission ordered Interbrew to divest itself of a number of its recently acquired brands, and Worthington was bought by the American brewer Coors, who later became Molson Coors in 2005. In 2004 Coors announced that they would no longer advertise Worthington on a large scale.|$|E

In Help!, Evans played a confused channel swimmer who pops up through an ice-hole in Austria, and {{on a beach in}} the Bahamas. Evans and Aspinall were asked to find and hire the actors that were needed to perform in the Magical Mystery Tour film, and to hire an old 60-seater coach, on which they were told to paint the Magical Mystery Tour logo, which McCartney had designed. Evans later appeared in the film as one of the magicians, who cast mysterious spells on the passengers of the bus.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} bassist for Anthem, which renamed to Anthym, {{was deemed}} unsatisfactory, so Slovak began teaching Flea to play bass. Following {{several months of}} commitment to the instrument, Flea developed proficiency and a strong musical chemistry with Slovak. When Strassman saw Flea playing Anthym songs on his equipment he quit the band, with Flea quickly replacing him. Shortly afterwards Anthym entered a local Battle of the Bands contest and won second place. Anthym started to play at local nightclubs, {{despite the fact that}} the members were all underage. After graduating from high school, the band changed their name to What Is This?. Flea left Anthym around this time to accept an offer of playing <b>bass</b> <b>in</b> the prominent L.A. punk band Fear. What Is This? continued on and performed many shows along the California coast.|$|E
5|$|The {{passing of}} the Antarctic Conservation Act (1978) in the U.S. brought several {{restrictions}} to U.S. activity on Antarctica. The introduction of alien plants or animals can bring a criminal penalty, as can the extraction of any indigenous species. The overfishing of krill, which plays {{a large role in}} the Antarctic ecosystem, led officials to enact regulations on fishing. The Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), a treaty that came into force in 1980, requires that regulations managing all Southern Ocean fisheries consider potential effects on the entire Antarctic ecosystem. Despite these new acts, unregulated and illegal fishing, particularly of Patagonian toothfish (marketed as Chilean Sea <b>Bass</b> <b>in</b> the U.S.), remains a serious problem. The illegal fishing of toothfish has been increasing, with estimates of 32,000tonnes (35,300short tons) in 2000.|$|E
5|$|When William Worthington died in 1800, his brewery {{was one of}} {{the largest}} outside London. From 1866 a Worthington chemist, Horace Tabberer Brown, pioneered brewing science in the {{separation}} and cultivation of pure yeast strains, and from 1872 the company was the first in the world to systematically use a laboratory in the brewing process. The company merged with its major Burton rival <b>Bass</b> <b>in</b> 1927. Throughout the 1920s until the 1960s the brand, in bottled form, ranked alongside Bass and Guinness as one of only three beers with nationwide distribution. However, bottled beer sales declined as keg beer grew in popularity throughout the 1960s, and the Worthington brewery was closed in 1965. The beers continued to be brewed elsewhere, and Bass used the Worthington brand for its principal keg bitter offerings from the 1960s onward, first as Worthington E, then as Worthington Best Bitter from the 1980s, and Worthington Creamflow from the 1990s to the present.|$|E

5|$|William Stones {{had started}} brewing in 1847 in Sheffield with Joseph Watts. Following Watts' death in 1854, Stones {{continued}} brewing by himself. In 1868, he purchased the lease of the Neepsend Brewery and renamed it the Cannon Brewery. He continued to brew there {{until his death}} in 1894. Stones' success saw him die as one of the richest men in Sheffield, although he lived a modest life. The company was taken over by <b>Bass</b> <b>in</b> 1968. In 2000, Bass sold its brewing operations to the Belgian brewer Interbrew who were ordered by the Competition Commission to sell the Stones brand. In 2002, the brand was purchased by the American Coors Brewing Company, who merged to become Molson Coors in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Activity began {{slowing down}} for the band by late 2000, with Keenan {{returning}} to Tool to finish the recording {{of what would be}} their next album, Lateralus. Keenan returned to A Perfect Circle to tour from January to March 2001, until returning to Tool again for the rest of 2001 to release and tour in support of Lateralus. Initial plans were for Howerdel to collaborate long-distance on writing new A Perfect Circle material with Keenan while he toured with Tool, by sending ideas back and forth to one another, though Keenan found it too difficult to balance both, eventually lessening his role while he focused on Tool. Efforts continued through mid-2002, with Howerdel primarily focusing on writing new material while sporadically working with Van Leeuwen, Lenchantin, and Freese. By June 2002, Van Leeuwen estimated that about 80% of the instrumental material was completed while they waited for Keenan's return. However, lineup changes and disagreements on the album's direction would lead to the album not being released for over a year. Both Lenchantin and VanLeeuwen had both been working on solo material during the band's downtime, and then moved on to join other bands. Lenchantin would leave to join Billy Corgan's new start-up band Zwan in April 2002, while Van Leeuwen began touring Queens of the Stone Age shortly after. Ex-Marilyn Manson bassist Jeordie White, formerly known as Twiggy Ramirez, replaced Lenchantin on <b>bass</b> <b>in</b> January 2003. Shortly after, VanLeeuwen permanently left the band, and long-time band collaborator Danny Lohner filled in temporarily as the second guitarist for wrapping up the album.|$|E
5|$|From 1886, Worthington {{began to}} acquire public houses, which {{provided}} a captive market for their product. In order to raise capital for this expansion, the firm became {{a public company}} in 1889, and Horace Brown was created joint managing director alongside William Posnette Manners. By this time the company had an annual output of around 200,000 barrels, and employed 470 people. By 1890, the company's bottling operations equalled those of Bass, Guinness, Allsopp and Whitbread. When William Henry Worthington (1826–1894) died he left no direct heirs and was the fourth and final generation of the family to manage Worthington & Co. Horace Brown left the company in 1894 following a dispute with co-manager William Manners. By 1900, 73 per cent of the company's equity was {{in the hands of}} William Posnette Manners (1846–1915), who had joined the company in 1862 as a junior clerk, and under his astute leadership Worthington acquired a reputation for the quality of its bottled pale ales. The company acquired the Burton Brewery Company in 1915. On Manners' death in 1915, control of the company passed to two of his sons, Arthur (1879–1968) and Ernest. Arthur was the architect of the merger with archrival <b>Bass</b> <b>in</b> 1927, and proved {{to be more than a}} match for John Gretton, 1st Baron Gretton, the chairman of the much larger Bass. Despite Bass's superior capitalization, the terms of the merger were such that Manners became chairman and joint managing director of Worthington, and deputy chairman and joint managing director of Bass. The amalgamation, described as 'the biggest non-merger in the history of the brewing industry', failed to realize its objectives. Apart from greater co-operation in bottled beer production and distribution, there were few economies and the two companies continued to operate as separate entities. Both boards were increasingly dominated by Manners and his family.|$|E
