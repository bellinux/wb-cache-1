25|$|When the Civil War {{broke out}} and Henry was {{rejected}} {{as a volunteer}} {{on account of his}} slightly cripped right hand, he turned his attention to making a <b>button</b> <b>hole</b> machine. He and his brother James entered into partnership with Mr. Seaman and in 1862 they perfected an automatic buttonhole sewing machine.

This caused hard feelings among the hand buttonhole workers, and one day during the noon hour they smashed the machine. However, the next morning another machine was working in its place. All together there were over one hundred thousand <b>button</b> <b>holes</b> made there. The patents were taken over by the Wheeler and Wilson Manufacturing Company of Bridgeport, Connecticut.
