In this study, we investigated the effect of HEPES on the uptake and bidirectional transport of P-gp substrates employing both Caco- 2 and MDCK-MDR 1 cells. ATP-dependent uptake of glutamic acid was also examined. ATP production was further quantified applying ATP Determination Kit. An addition of HEPES to the cellular washing and incubation media significantly altered the uptake and transport of P-gp substrates in both Caco- 2 and MDCK-MDR 1 cells. Uptake of P-gp substrates substantially diminished as the HEPES concentration was raised to 25 mM. Bidirectional (A-B and B-A) transport studies revealed that permeability ratio of PappB-A to PappA-B {{in the presence of}} 25 mM HEPES was significantly higher than control. The uptake of phenylalanine is an ATP-independent process, whereas the accumulation of glutamic acid is ATP-dependent. While phenylalanine uptake remained unchanged glutamic acid uptake was elevated with the addition of HEPES. Verapamil is an inhibitor of P-gp mediated uptake, elevation of cyclosporine uptake in the presence of 5 μM verapamil was compromised by the presence of 25 mM HEPES.

40|$|Alpha 6 beta 2 nicotinic {{acetylcholine}} receptors (nAChRs) {{are potential}} therapeutic {{targets for the}} treatment of several neuropsychiatric diseases, including addiction and Parkinson’s disease. Alpha-conotoxin (α-CTx) TxIB is a uniquely selective ligand, which blocks α 6 /α 3 β 2 β 3 nAChRs only, but does not block the other subtypes. Therefore, α-CTx TxIB is a valuable therapeutic candidate peptide. Synthesizing enough α-CTx TxIB with high yield production is required for conducting wide-range testing of its potential medicinal applications. The current study optimized the cleavage of synthesized α-CTx TxIB resin-bounded peptide and folding of the cleaved linear peptide. Key parameters influencing cleavage and oxidative folding of α-CTx TxIB were examined, such as <b>buffer,</b> redox <b>agents,</b> pH, salt, co-solvent and temperature. Twelve conditions were used for cleavage optimization. Fifty-four kinds of one-step oxidative solution were used to assess their effects on each α-CTx TxIB isomers’ yield. The result indicated that co-solvent choices were particularly important. Completely oxidative folding of globular isomer was achieved when the NH 4 HCO 3 or Tris-HCl folding buffer at 4 °C contained 40 % of co-solvent DMSO, and GSH:GSSG (2 : 1) or GSH only with pH 8 ~ 8. 7...|$|R
40|$|Nano-iron {{metal and}} nano-iron oxides {{are among the}} most widely used {{engineered}} and naturally occurring nanostructures, and the increasing incidence of biological exposure to these nanostructures has raised concerns about their biotoxicity. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) -induced oxidative stress {{is one of the most}} accepted toxic mechanisms and, in the past decades, considerable efforts have been made to investigate the ROS-related activities of iron nanostructures. In this review, we summarize activities of nano-iron metal and nano-iron oxides in ROS-related redox processes, addressing in detail the known homogeneous and heterogeneous redox mechanisms involved in these processes, intrinsic ROS-related properties of iron nanostructures (chemical composition, particle size, and crystalline phase), and ROS-related bio-microenvironmental factors, including physiological pH and <b>buffers,</b> biogenic reducing <b>agents,</b> and other organic substances...|$|R
30|$|Besides {{distilled}} Water, {{other four}} moistening agents were also examined, and results (Fig.  3 b) {{revealed that the}} composition of the moistening media profoundly affects LA yield. Basal salt solutions and tap water resulted in higher LA production as compared to D/W alone. Enzyme production using Toyama’s salt solution (pH 5.0) was significantly higher than other moistening agents and it was therefore selected as the moistening agent in further experiments. Our studies are in line with the reports on LA production with moistening agent (distilled water) at acidic pH using Cladosporium sp. (Kumara et al. 2013). Other researchers have reported LA production using <b>buffer</b> as moistening <b>agent</b> on neutral and near neutral pH range {{depending on the type of}} organism used (Soniyambi et al. 2011; Yasser et al. 2002).|$|R
