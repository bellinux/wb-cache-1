40|$|An {{experimentally}} observed {{violation of}} <b>Bell</b> <b>s</b> inequality {{is supposed to}} show the failure of local realism to deal with quantum reality. However, finite statistics and the time sequential nature of real experiments still allows a loophole for local realism. We show that the randomised design of the Aspect experiment closes this loophole. Our main tool is van de Geer s (2000) supermartingale version of the classical Bernstein (1924) inequality guaranteeing, at the root n scale, a not-heavier-than-Gaussian tail {{of the distribution of}} a sum of bounded supermartingale differences. The results are used to specify a protocol for a public bet between the author and L. Accardi, who in recent papers (Accardi and Regoli, 2000 a,b, 2001) has claimed to have produced a suite of computer programmes, to be run on a network of computers, which will simulate a violation of <b>Bell</b> <b>s</b> inequalites. At a sample size of thirty thousand, both error probabilities are guaranteed smaller than one in a million, provided we adhere to the sequential randomized design...|$|R

Spread- E s data obtained at night every 15 min by the midlatitudinal vertical sounding station of the ionosphere in Dushanbe (φ= 38. 5 ° N, λ= 68. 8 ° E) are analysed. Groups of earthquakes with different magnitudes and different distances between the epicenter and the sounding station are considered. A statistical analysis of the obtained results is performed. It is shown that during the three nights before an earthquake, spread- E <b>s</b> <b>phenomena</b> are observed more often than during the forth, fifth and sixth nights before the event. This effect is found to depend on both {{the magnitude of the}} earthquake and the distance between the epicenter and the sounding station...|$|R

The inference of non-locality from EPR experiments will be against the principle of non-realism of quantum mechanics. Therefore, the experiments about quantum entanglement cannot provide any proof to accuse locality...|$|R
