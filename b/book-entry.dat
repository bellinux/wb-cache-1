40|$|From the Introduction]. Today, most {{payments}} {{consist of}} electronic transfer {{of information and}} <b>book-entries.</b> The domestic financial infrastructure in the EU is generally highly developed, with large and small value systems, central securities depositories, and modern exchanges. Until recently, the cross-border infrastructure was virtually non-existent. Central banks have traditionally {{played an important role}} in payment systems. This role has been based on both the operational and the oversight responsibilities of central banks...|$|R
40|$|Investors do not {{physically}} hold their investment securities any more. Securities are held and transferred through a complex, sophisticated, and international network of financial intermediaries, including central securities depositories, investment banks, and brokers-dealers. Investors {{buy and sell}} their holdings by having <b>book-entries</b> made to their securities accounts; they provide collateral to secured lenders by <b>book-entries</b> or by control agreements. Because transfers and collateral transactions are critical to the liquidity of the financial markets and to financial stability, market participants and regulators have become increasingly concerned with the legal soundness, the internal consistency, and the international compatibility of national laws regulating the holding and transfer of securities held with an intermediary. This article examines how the international harmonisation of key rules of commercial law {{can contribute to the}} reduction of legal risk and discusses a draft convention prepared by the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law (UNIDROIT). Rather than addressing the numerous features of that draft, the author focuses on its methodology—the “functional approach”—and finds {{that it is possible to}} create effective international treaty provisions, which contracting States may implement without disrupting their property law with respect to the structure and characterisation of investors' interests in securities. This article tests the robustness of the functional approach by examining two critical issues: the definition of intermediated securities as the building block of international substantive rules and the choice among four internationally recognised methods for the transfer of intermediated securities and for their use as collateral...|$|R

40|$|In today's {{financial}} markets, investors {{no longer}} hold securities physically. Instead, securities such as shares or bonds are mostly held through intermediaries and transferred {{by way of}} <b>book-entries</b> on securities accounts. However, there are remarkable conceptual differences between the various jurisdictions {{with regard to the}} legal treatment of intermediated securities. It is widely agreed that this patchwork creates considerable legal risks, especially in cross-border situations. Two initiatives are in place to reduce these risks. In 2009, the UNIDROIT Convention on Substantive Rules for Intermediated Securities (the 'Geneva Securities Convention') was adopted, aimed at harmonisation on the international level. The EU Commission is also running a legislative project, to achieve harmonisation at the regional level. This book compares both initiatives and analyses their impact on the securities laws of selected European jurisdictions...|$|R

But the [...] "contractualisation" [...] of the substantive law of securities incurred by the Unidroit convention results, {{within the context of a}} bankruptcy affecting the constituent of a Guarantee, in making ineffective [...] "title transfer guarantees", which, so far, in the countries, where these are recognised, escape the perimeter of the bankruptcy of their constituent. This situation is all the more paradoxical that a chapter of the Unidroit Convention, inspired by the European Directive 2002/47 on financial securities (FCD), compels the signatory States to recognise [...] "title transfer guarantees". This contradiction between the provisions concerning the <b>book-entries</b> and the methods of constitution of guarantees shows the limits of the [...] "contractual-functional" [...] approach.|$|R
50|$|Most {{investors who}} use an online broker {{or even a}} regular full-service broker will have their shares held in <b>book-entry</b> form.

50|$|Although the {{phenomenon}} is ancient, since book entry systems for recording securities have been noted from civilisations as early as Assyria in 2000 BC, it gained new prominence {{with the advent of}} computer technology in the late 20th century. Even during the period when paper certificates were popular, <b>book-entry</b> systems continued since many small firms could not afford printing secured paper-form securities. These <b>book-entry</b> securities were often held under the control of an attorney who acts as a notary to certify the existence of the securities, as well as their authenticity.|$|E

They also keep records of how many shares or bonds each investor owns.|$|E
5000|$|In {{finance and}} {{financial}} law, dematerialization {{refers to the}} substitution of paper-form securities by <b>book-entry</b> securities. This {{is a form of}} indirect holding system where an intermediary, such as a broker or central securities depository, or the issuer itself (e.g French system) holds a record of the ownership of shares usually in electronic format. [...] The dematerialization of securities such as stocks has been a major trend since the late 1960s, with the result that by 2010 the majority of global securities were held in dematerialized form.|$|E
5000|$|The next tier {{consists}} of {{a limited number of}} financial institutions, brokers, depositories and other professional investors who have direct contractual relationships with the CSDs and who hold their interests in securities in <b>book-entry</b> accounts with a CSD. These intermediaries (sometimes called participants of the CSD) in turn, hold in their accounts interests in or in respect of securities either for themselves or for their customers, such as institutional or retail investors or further intermediaries, and so forth until accounts are held for the investors.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1990s, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) {{working with}} the {{securities}} industry, developed a new form of, [...] "direct holding system" [...] that would allow both the speedy settlement of securities transactions and communication between shareholders and their companies. This new system was a type of <b>book-entry</b> direct registration system (DRS) operated by stock transfer agent. This concept would allow any retail investor who wants his or her securities to be registered directly on the books of the issuer, but does not necessarily want to receive a certificate, to register those securities in <b>book-entry</b> form directly on the books of the issuer. The DRS concept {{has been slow to}} develop for two reasons. First, many investors do not understand that if they give up paper certificates while joining a DRS, this will return them to the status of direct shareholders of the issuer rather than just customers of a broker (who is the registered shareholder {{in the eyes of the}} issuer), and second, once brokers and banks had been inserted as the [...] "indispensable" [...] middlemen between shareholders and issuers, they were not eager to surrender this privileged position of control. As a result, one version of the [...] "direct holding system" [...] is an inefficient relic of the past and a modern DRS form of direct holding remains for most shareholders an unrealized thing of the future.|$|E
5000|$|Established in 1973, it {{was created}} to reduce costs and provide {{efficiencies}} by immobilizing securities and making [...] "book-entry" [...] changes to show ownership of the securities. DTC moves securities for NSCC's net settlements, and settlement for institutional trades (which typically involve money and securities transfers between custodian banks and broker-dealers), as well as money market instruments. In 2007, DTC settled transactions worth $513 trillion, and processed 325 million <b>book-entry</b> deliveries. In addition to settlement services, DTC retains custody of 3.5 million securities issues, worth about $40 trillion, including securities issued in the United States and more than 110 other countries.

Anyone holding ATK common stock {{at the end}} of the {{business}} day on February 2, 2015 received two shares of Vista Outdoor common stock. Eligible shareholders had their brokerage account credited or received a <b>book-entry</b> account statement reflecting their ownership.

5000|$|In particular, the {{functional}} approach {{made it possible}} to refine the distinction between [...] "intrinsic right" [...] (right of the content) and [...] "substantive right" [...] (right of the container). The functional approach also {{made it possible to}} outline, inside [...] "substantive right", a distinction between [...] "right of book-entries" [...] and [...] "property right" [...] (or [...] "rights in rem"). However, while voluntarily ruling out the aspects relating to property rights, the authors of the Unidroit Convention did not content themselves to draft a convention limited to the sole <b>book-entry</b> aspects. Contractualising the relationship between account holders and account providers, while discarding any possibility for the final investor to rivindicate the securities, the authors of the Unidroit Convention, at the end, reproduced the American model of property of securities resulting from the 1994 reform of Article 8 of the American Uniform Commercial Code.|$|E
50|$|Chills and freezes can {{be imposed}} on {{securities}} for more complicated reasons, such as when DTC determines {{that there may be}} a legal, regulatory, or operational problem with the issuance of the security, or the trading or clearing of transactions involving the security. For example, DTC may chill or freeze a security when DTC becomes aware or is informed by the issuer, transfer agent, federal or state regulators, or federal or state law enforcement officials that an issuance of some or all of the issuer’s securities or transfer in those securities is in violation of state or federal law. If DTC suspects that all or a portion of its holdings of a security may not be freely transferable as is required for DTC services, it may decide to chill one or more of its services or place a freeze on all services for the security. When there is a corporate action, DTC will temporarily chill the security for <b>book-entry</b> activities. In other instances, a corporate action can cause a more permanent chill. This may force the issuer to reapply for eligibility altogether.|$|E
40|$|The {{conversion}} of U. S. Treasury securities from physical to <b>book-entry</b> form {{was a major}} event {{in the history of}} the Treasury market. The conversion, which began in 1966, resulted in an automated system that has greatly reduced market operating costs and risks. This article examines the origins and development of the Federal Reserve <b>book-entry</b> system for Treasury securities. It suggests that the system was the product of three important factors: the interest of the Federal Reserve Banks and the Treasury in lowering their operating costs and risks, the intention of the Reserve Banks and the Treasury to preserve the liquidity of the market, and the desire of the Reserve Banks to reduce member bank operating costs. Two critical incidents-a loss of securities at a Reserve Bank in 1962 and an "insurance crisis" in 1970 - 71 -played major roles in the early development and subsequent expansion of the <b>book-entry</b> system.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{phenomenon}} of the financial collateral arrangements, under which parties transfer <b>book-entry</b> securities. It focuses on the legal questions link to the international element. Financial collateral arrangements typically occur in securities repurchase and securities lending. These transactions play important role in order to guarantee liquidity cash and proper functioning of capital markets in the European Union. Simultaneously, securities are no longer only of a tangible goods nature; instead they exists as electronic records in securities accounts. This is why conflicts of law issues have become so paramount. This study analyses the approach of Czech law to financial collateral arrangements. In particular, if the collateral is represented by a <b>book-entry</b> share, bond or fund unit. It pays attention to such a matter from the national as well as the harmonised EU perspective. On an EU level, such arrangements are primarily regulated by the Collateral Directive (FCAD).

In the first part the quality of connection of the right and the list is analyzed including situations when the shareholder's right can exist independently of the security list. Also the definition of securities is reviewed which apply to shares only with certain reservation described here. The functions and the most important features of shares, such as the substitutability and tradability of shares on a regulated market, are also discussed. The thesis further reflects the fact that the share can also be issued as a <b>book-entry</b> security, the regulation of which has been separated from the category of securities and therefore forms a separate category. The last alternative is the share {{in the form of an}} immobilized security whose character is based on the adjustment of the securities as the share's list is preserved, as well as the <b>book-entry</b> securities through registration in the register. The second part analyzes registered shares and bearer shares. These forms of shares are distinguished by their requisites, but also by the extent of the limitations that are set out in these forms.
