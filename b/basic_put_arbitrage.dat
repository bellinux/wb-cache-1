It can be shown that the exchange rate serves to convert prices of international undiversifiable risks from one currency to another. <b>Put</b> differently, <b>arbitrage</b> ensures that risk carries the same price in any two countries when evaluated from a particular viewpoint. As a consequence of this, expected returns should be equal after being converted to a common currency. We develop, estimate and test a linear 3 -country asset pricing model for exchange risk hedged bond returns. Using US, UK, and German bond portfolio return data we find favorable evidence for the exchange rate being an unconditional converter of prices of risk across countries. Few other papers verify this important arbitrage pricing corollary. multi-country asset pricing model, exchange risk, price of risk conversion...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{theoretical}} index of spatial uncertainty is defined, which measures {{the degree of}} diversity faced by potential movers in a destination choice set. As a result of variations in attractiveness and distance, destinations are considered to exert varying degrees of spatial dominance on origins and to compete on that basis {{for the attention of}} would-be movers. It is hypothesized that at origins where dominances are more uniform, there is 'less to choose' among destinations and it is more difficult to predict accurately spatial interaction (and vice versa). The <b>basic</b> concept <b>put</b> forth is that spatial uncertainty and the spatial interaction-model performance are related to the relative location of origins with respect to destinations.
