25|$|Magnetophone's {{music was}} {{at odds with}} the Brit Pop 'indie' guitar bands that predominated in the second city's venues; consequently, from 1998-1999 Saunders and Hanson {{organised}} and promoted their own night of 'alternative' music entitled 'We <b>Brought</b> <b>Our</b> Friends'.|$|E
25|$|This {{first single}} {{was met with}} great enthusiasm by the press, and by fellow musicians, {{including}} Spacemen 3's Sonic Boom who met the band at a 'We <b>Brought</b> <b>Our</b> Friends' show and later worked and performed with them. A series of other singles, 12"s, and compilations followed, and a long term relationship with Static Caravan Recordings began.|$|E
500|$|Entwistle {{recalled}} {{being close}} to Moon on tour: [...] "I suppose we were two of a kind"...We shared a room {{on the road and}} got up to no good." [...] Consequently, both were often involved in blowing up toilets. In a 1981 Los Angeles Times interview he admitted, [...] "A lot of times when Keith was blowing up toilets I was standing behind him with the matches." [...] In Alabama, Moon and Entwistle loaded a toilet with cherry bombs after being denied room service. According to Entwistle, [...] "That toilet was just dust all over the walls by the time we checked out. The management <b>brought</b> <b>our</b> suitcases down to the gig and said: 'Don't come back...'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Nearing the mid-1880s, {{there was}} a decline of bison in the Wood Mountain region. This {{was a result of}} the United States government’s attempt to starve out Sitting Bull. With the end of the Bison Hunt, the Métis began life as ranchers: “We <b>brought</b> <b>our</b> stock and {{expertise}} to Willow Bunch. No one knew more about horsemanship and training horses than we did”. The Métis population in Willow Bunch became known as a “hub of the first tentative ranching operations in southwestern Saskatchewan.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Abbey {{has also}} drawn {{criticism}} for what some regard as his racist and sexist views. In an essay called [...] "Immigration and Liberal Taboos", collected in his 1988 book One Life at a Time, Please, Abbey expressed {{his opposition to}} immigration ("legal or illegal, from any source") into the United States: [...] "(I)t occurs to some of us that perhaps ever-continuing industrial and population growth is not the true road to human happiness, that simple gross quantitative increase of this kind creates only more pain, dislocation, confusion and misery. In which case it might be wise for us as American citizens to consider calling {{a halt to the}} mass influx of even more millions of hungry, ignorant, unskilled, and culturally-morally-genetically impoverished people. At least until we have <b>brought</b> <b>our</b> own affairs into order. Especially when these uninvited millions bring with them an alien mode of life which—let us be honest about this—is not appealing to the majority of Americans. Why not? Because we prefer democratic government, for one thing; because we still hope for an open, spacious, uncrowded, and beautiful—yes, beautiful!—society, for another. The alternative, in the squalor, cruelty, and corruption of Latin America, is plain for all to see." ...|$|E
