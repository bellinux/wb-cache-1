The most optimal option of production, which is proposed based on the literary study, is the technology of conventional draught with blankholder. A tool, punch and die were chosen due to performed technology and structural calculatios. And it was also determined the machine CTC 250 with nominal power 250 kN.

40|$|Areas {{with various}} defects and damages, which reduce {{carrying}} capacity, {{were examined in}} a study of metal chimneys. In this work, the influence of the local dimples on the function of metal chimneys was considered. Modeling tasks were completed in the software packages LIRA and ANSYS. Parameters were identified, which characterize the local dimples, and a numerical study of the influence of local dimples on the stress-strain state of shells of metal chimneys was conducted. A distribution field of circular and meridional tension was analyzed in a researched area. Zones of influence of dimples on the <b>bearing</b> <b>cover</b> of metal chimneys were investigated. The bearing capacities of high-rise structures with various dimple geometries and various cover parameters were determined with respect to specified areas of the trunk. Dependent relationships are represented graphically for the decrease in bearing capacity of a cover with respect to dimples. Diameter and thickness of covers of metal chimneys were constructed according to the resulting data...|$|E

40|$|Hydropower {{laboratories}} {{are used}} to determine the hydraulic performance of model turbines, which can then be used as an indication of expected prototype operation. The rules and guidelines for performance of complete model tests are provided by the international IEC 60193 [2] standard. An important part of model testing is the determination of turbine shaft torque and axial forces. The objective of this thesis is to design a system for measurement and calibration of friction torque and axial load on the Francis turbine test rig for both the Waterpower Laboratory at NTNU and the Turbine Testing Laboratory at Kathmandu. The systems must comply with the requirements of IEC 60193 [2]. The friction torque measuring system at the Waterpower Laboratory is based on the existing setup, with a load cell attached to an arm, sensing the torsional movement of the <b>bearing</b> <b>cover.</b> A linear stepper has been introduced to the design, to counteract the frictional forces of the membrane. The system has been evaluated for total systematic uncertainty. Pressure taps inside the hydrostatic bearing {{are used to}} measure axial forces acting on the Francis turbine at the Waterpower Laboratory. A design has been developed for calibration of the pressure transducers, able to perform calibration of forces in both axial directions. Stress analysis are performed on the consisting parts, and total systematic uncertainty of the setup is determined. For the Turbine Testing Laboratory, the friction torque and axial loads are measured with silicon strain gauges. The existing shaft and bearing design has been modified to fit the space requirements of the measurement setups. A telemetry system is utilized for wireless transmission of the signal. 3 D model of the Francis turbine test rigs at both Waterpower Laboratory and Turbine Testing Laboratory are developed. Detailed machine drawings of the measurement setups are presented in this thesis...|$|E
