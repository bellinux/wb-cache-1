40|$|The use of {{automatic}} differentiation for an exact computation of geometric properties of bevel gear tooth flanks is discussed. Known {{models of the}} kinematics of the machine tools generating bevel gear tooth flanks have been improved. Using that result, we compute curvature properties of the generated envelope surfaces directly. From an analytical point of view, the envelope condition used in differential geometry {{can be interpreted as}} a singularity of a vector function in 3 -space. By an analytical characterization of this singularity we obtain a two-dimensional parameterization of the generated flank for any machine parameter set. The necessary partial derivatives of the vector function are computed with the help {{of automatic}} differentiation. For the first time it is possible to compute the curvature properties and the resulting undercut geometry between tooth and fillet surface of the tooth flanks of any spiral bevel or hypoid gear without any approximation.
