The current paper examined the feelings of street <b>beggars</b> on begging life and their survival livelihoods in urban areas of central Tanzania. This study employed a cross-sectional research design. The population of the study consisted of street <b>beggars</b> and non-street <b>beggars,</b> municipal officials, councilors, business people and community members.

Step towards banning, or discourage begging should be welcome. Families where <b>beggars</b> come from should be made aware of taking fore responsibility of taking care of their family members who are <b>beggars...</b>|$|R

5|$|As {{told in the}} Kurma Purana, Bhikshatana-Shiva {{wanted to}} reveal the ignorance of the sages, who were engrossed in Dharma (righteousness) and extreme austerities but had {{forgotten}} the Samkhya (Supreme Knowledge). The naked, handsome, ithyphallic (with an erect phallus, urdhvalinga) <b>beggar</b> Shiva entered the forest, begging for alms from the sages' wives. They were so enamoured of him that while granting alms, they allowed their clothes to fall off and followed him, dancing and singing, love-sick. Bhikshatana was accompanied by Mohini—Vishnu disguised as Bhikshatana's enchanting wife, who maddens the sages' sons in love. The sages, unable to recognise Shiva, abused and cursed him, even assaulting him. They cursed that his Linga (phallus) should fall off. Shiva allowed it to be so and the Linga became an infinite fiery pillar of light. Anusuya, the wife of sage Atri, enlightened the sages that the couple {{was none other than}} Shiva and Vishnu. The sages thereafter worshipped the Linga. Pleased, Shiva returned to the forest as a <b>beggar</b> in an ugly form with his wife Parvati. Eventually, he revealed his supreme form to the sages and exalted the Pashupata vow – by which a man restrains his passion, becomes celibate, and roams naked smeared with ash – declaring that such a lifestyle would lead to moksha (salvation).|$|E

A cross-sectional research design was employed in this study. Structured questionnaires {{were administered to}} 130 street <b>beggars,</b> who were selected from various public spaces using a convenience sampling technique. Focus-group discussions, key-informant interviews, and observations were also used to collect primary data. The study found that street <b>beggars</b> fell into four categories namely <b>beggars</b> on the streets, <b>beggars</b> of the streets, <b>beggars</b> in the streets, and <b>beggars</b> of street families, based on where they slept after begging hours and contacts with their families. Furthermore, the phenomenon of street begging is an outcome of many factors, including poverty, unemployment, physical challenges, death of parents, and family disintegration. The study recommends that to address the phenomenon of street begging, policy planners and local government authorities must adopt multi-faceted, multi-targeted, and multi-tiered approaches {{in the form of}} preventative and responsive interventions...|$|R
