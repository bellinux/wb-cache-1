The fatigue spalls in the silicon nitride resembled those in typical <b>bearing</b> <b>steels.</b> The ten-percent fatigue life of the silicon nitride balls was approximately one-eighth to one-fifth that of typical <b>bearing</b> <b>steels</b> (52100 and M- 50).

The corrosion behavior of <b>bearing</b> <b>steels</b> in the lubricant environment {{has been observed}} to be quite different than in aqueous solution. Both {{the amount of water}} contamination in oil and chloride content of the water impact the observed corrosion rates in oil-water mixtures. All steel compositions tested demonstrated localized corrosion damage when exposed to oil with water added; however, inherently less corrosion-resistant alloys had more widespread shallow attack, whereas higher Cr-containing alloys displayed more localized severe attack. The mechanism of corrosion in the two-phase, oil plus aqueous phase system appears to be controlled by an aqueous corrosion process dependent on steel microstructure and emulsified or free water and likely limited by oxygen availability and amount of water (with aggressive ions) in the oil...|$|R

Kwaio also attempted to avenge the deaths of those who died overseas, and they earned a reputation as a fierce and dangerous group. Missionaries from the South Seas Evangelical Church were brought to support those in Queensland who had become Christians there, and enclaves were established in the lowlands.|$|E

The decomposition is partial and a significant amount of austenite could be retained even after ∼ 106 stress cycles. A scenario revealing different stages of retained austenite behaviour under compressive stresses has been established. It is observed that retained austenite first decomposes during the first tens of cycles and at 103 cycles, whilst it remains stable at cycles ranging 102 – 103 and after 104.

40|$|Abstract: Traditionally, bridge <b>bearings</b> {{supporting}} <b>steel</b> trapezoidal {{box girder}} (a. k. a. tub girder) superstructures consist of fabricator designed mechanical devices, such as pot or disk bearings (a. k. a. high load, multi-rotational bearings), {{that may be}} guided or unguided and are typically expensive to fabricate and place. The performance of these bearings has been mixed, with some being maintenance free and others requiring significant maintenance, repair and/or replacement.

40|$|The {{potential}} for significant performance increases, using ceramic materials in un-lubricated {{rolling element bearing}} applications, {{has been the subject}} of research over the past two decades. Practical advantages over steel include increased ability to withstand high loads, severe environments and high speeds. However, widespread acceptance has been limited by the inability to predict wear life for ceramic bearing applications. In this thesis, the rolling contact wear of 52100 <b>bearing</b> <b>steel</b> and Over-aged Magnesia-Partially-Stabilised Zirconia (OA-Mg-PSZ) ceramic are examined using a newly developed rolling contact wear test rig. The new wear test rig simulates the system geometry of an un-lubricated hybrid (ceramic and steel) ball bearing. The new wear test rig is versatile in that it allows low cost samples to be utilised resulting in a larger number of samples that can be tested. Wear samples of 52100 <b>bearing</b> <b>steel</b> and OA-Mg-PSZ produced by the new wear test rig were examined for mass loss and wear depth. The wear behavior of both the steel and ceramic material showed a dependence on operating variables time and load. Load was varied between 300 N to 790 N. Typical mass loss after 1 hour of testing 52100 <b>bearing</b> <b>steel</b> at 790 N was 0. 03 grams as compared to OA-Mg-PSZ which was 0. 001 grams. The rolling contact wear of the OA-Mg-PSZ was an order of magnitude lower than that of the 52100 <b>bearing</b> <b>steel.</b> The wear mechanism for 52100 <b>bearing</b> <b>steel</b> was typical of plastic deformation and shearing near and below the surface of rolling contact. Once cracks extend to reach the surface, thin flat like sheets are produced. In OA-Mg-PSZ the wear mechanism initially is that of plastic deformation on the scale of the surface asperities with asperity polishing occurring followed by lateral cracks and fatigue spallation. Results obtained using the new rolling contact wear test rig led to the establishment of a new equation for wear modeling of 52100 <b>bearing</b> <b>steel</b> and OA-Mg-PSZ ceramic materials...|$|E

40|$|Substantial {{microstructural}} {{changes have}} been found to occur in <b>bearing</b> <b>steels</b> when subjected to high stress Rolling Contact Fatigue (RCF) and have been mainly reported in literature between the 1940 s and 1990 s. However, owing to limitations in the characterisation techniques available at the time, inconsistent interpretation and use of discrepant terminology have caused considerable difficulties in defining the microstructural changes accurately and unambiguously. In the present work, we have investigated the typical microstructural alterations, including Dark Etching Region (DER), Low Angle Bands (LABs) and High Angle Bands (HABs), and their formation mechanisms in RCF failed AISI 52100 (100 Cr 6) <b>bearing</b> <b>steels</b> using a combination of advanced microstructure characterisation techniques, including Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) coupled with Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), and nanohardness measurements.

The results show that new globular and elongated grains with distinct textures form during all stages of RCF, however a redistribution of chemical elements was only observed during the later stages of RCF. This has provided a significant insight in the formation mechanisms of DER, LABs and HABs.

40|$|<b>Steel</b> bridge <b>bearings</b> {{are widely}} used in {{existing}} bridges in the United States to provide a load transfer mechanism and accommodate movements between the superstructure and substructure. Due {{to a lack of}} regular maintenance, the in-situ condition of these <b>steel</b> <b>bearings</b> is often severely corroded. Moreover, these <b>steel</b> <b>bearings</b> are not designed for seismic loads {{due to a lack of}} understanding of the seismic hazard posed to bridges in the Central and Eastern United States (CEUS) at the time that many of these bridges were built. As awareness of their susceptibility to corrosion and vulnerability to seismic loads increases among bridge owners and engineers, the seismic performance of <b>steel</b> <b>bearings</b> and their influence on the overall bridge system performance is of major concern, particularly given the importance the highway network plays in sustaining economic prosperity. For this reason, the goal of this study is to correlate corrosion level with the performance of <b>steel</b> <b>bearings</b> under seismic loads, thereby providing a means of more accurately assessing the vulnerability of in-situ bridges. An analytical and finite element study is first undertaken to gain a preliminary understanding of the mechanical behavior of the considered <b>steel</b> <b>bearings.</b> Corrosion loss quantification and large-scale experimental testing are then conducted on 25 salvaged <b>steel</b> bridge <b>bearings</b> aiming to provide an in-depth understanding of corrosion loss distribution and its influence on the cyclic behavior of <b>steel</b> <b>bearings.</b> Further, a portfolio of constitutive models that incorporate corrosion effects is created for the <b>steel</b> bridge <b>bearings</b> based on the experimental findings. The seismic performance of the <b>steel</b> <b>bearings</b> and the bridge systems is then numerically evaluated considering design basis earthquakes and maximum credible earthquakes.
