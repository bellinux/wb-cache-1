25|$|Morphine was {{the most}} {{commonly}} abused narcotic analgesic in the world until heroin was synthesized and came into use. In general, until the synthesis of dihydromorphine (ca. 1900), the dihydromorphinone class of opioids (1920s), and oxycodone (1916) and similar drugs, {{there were no other}} drugs in the same efficacy range as opium, morphine, and heroin, with synthetics still several years away (pethidine was invented in Germany in 1937) and opioid agonists among the semi-synthetics were analogues and derivatives of codeine such as dihydrocodeine (Paracodin), ethylmorphine (Dionine), and <b>benzylmorphine</b> (Peronine). Even today, morphine is the most sought after prescription narcotic by heroin addicts when heroin is scarce, all other things being equal; local conditions and user preference may cause hydromorphone, oxymorphone, high-dose oxycodone, or methadone as well as dextromoramide in specific instances such as 1970s Australia, to top that particular list. The stop-gap drugs used by the largest absolute number of heroin addicts is probably codeine, with significant use also of dihydrocodeine, poppy straw derivatives like poppy pod and poppy seed tea, propoxyphene, and tramadol.|$|E

50|$|<b>Benzylmorphine</b> (Peronine) is a semi-synthetic opioid {{narcotic}} {{introduced to}} the international market in 1896 {{and that of the}} United States very shortly thereafter. It is much like codeine, containing a benzyl group attached to the morphine molecule just as the methyl group creates codeine and the ethyl group creates ethylmorphine or dionine (used as a generic name for that drug just as peronine is for <b>benzylmorphine).</b> It is about 90% as strong as codeine by weight.|$|E
50|$|<b>Benzylmorphine</b> is {{an active}} {{metabolite}} of the opioid analgesic myrophine, formed in the liver. It has a metabolic fate {{similar to that of}} codeine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Benzylmorphine</b> {{is used as}} the {{hydrochloride}} (free base {{conversion ratio}} 0.91) and methylsulphonate (0.80) and has a US DEA Administrative Controlled Substance Control Number of 9052.|$|E
50|$|<b>Benzylmorphine</b> {{is used in}} {{much the}} same way as codeine and ethylmorphine, {{primarily}} as a moderate strength analgesic, for eye surgery as a 1 to 2% solution, and as a cough suppressant. It was available in the United States prior to 1914 and was still used until the 1960s, but fell into disuse once alternative opiate derivatives became preferred by doctors (i.e. hydrocodone as an analgesic and codeine as a cough suppressant) <b>Benzylmorphine</b> is now a Schedule I Controlled Substance in the USA and is regulated internationally under UN drug conventions.|$|E

50|$|Nicocodeine is {{regulated}} {{in most cases}} as is codeine and similar weak opiate drugs like ethylmorphine, <b>benzylmorphine,</b> dihydrocodeine and its other close derivatives like acetyldihydrocodeine (although not the stronger hydrocodone or oxycodone, which are regulated like morphine) and others of this class in the laws of countries and the Single Convention On Narcotic Drugs. One notable example {{is the fact that}} nicocodeine is a Schedule I/Narcotic controlled substance in the United States along with heroin as nicocodeine was never introduced for medical use in the United States.|$|E
50|$|Myrophine is {{substituted}} with a 3-benzyl {{group and}} a 6-myristyl chain. It is metabolised to form <b>benzylmorphine</b> and then further to morphine, {{and so is}} a long-acting prodrug for morphine, but with a slow onset of effects. It is weaker than morphine as an analgesic but longer-lasting in effects, and was thought to have more local anesthetic effect than morphine, though with a somewhat greater tendency to cause histamine reactions like itching and rash. In addiction studies conducted in human subjects in the 1950's, myrophine did not substitute for morphine in withdrawal, did not produce notable morphine-like effects, and did not produce addiction or dependence regardless of dose or how it was administered. Consequently, it {{was thought to be}} useful in treating pain in addicts who were being detoxified from other opioid drugs.|$|E
5000|$|The {{interaction}} of carisoprodol with essentially all opioids, and other centrally acting analgesics, but especially [...] {{those of the}} codeine-derived subgroup of the semisynthetic class (codeine, ethylmorphine, dihydrocodeine, hydrocodone, oxycodone, nicocodeine, <b>benzylmorphine,</b> the various acetylated codeine derivatives including acetyldihydrocodeine, dihydroisocodeine, nicodicodeine and others) [...] which allows {{the use of a}} smaller dose of the opioid to have a given effect , is useful in general and especially where skeletal muscle injury and/or spasm is {{a large part of the}} problem. The potentiation effect is also useful in other pain situations and is also especially useful with opioids of the open-chain class, such as methadone, levomethadone, ketobemidone, phenadoxone and others. In recreational drug users, deaths have resulted from carelessly combining overdoses of hydrocodone and carisoprodol. Another danger of misuse of carisoprodol and opiates is the potential to aspirate while unconscious.|$|E
50|$|Morphine {{became a}} {{controlled}} substance in the US under the Harrison Narcotics Tax Act of 1914, and possession {{without a prescription}} in the US is a criminal offense.Morphine was the most commonly abused narcotic analgesic in the world until heroin was synthesized and came into use. In general, until the synthesis of dihydromorphine (ca. 1900), the dihydromorphinone class of opioids (1920s), and oxycodone (1916) and similar drugs, {{there were no other}} drugs in the same efficacy range as opium, morphine, and heroin, with synthetics still several years away (pethidine was invented in Germany in 1937) and opioid agonists among the semi-synthetics were analogues and derivatives of codeine such as dihydrocodeine (Paracodin), ethylmorphine (Dionine), and <b>benzylmorphine</b> (Peronine).

5000|$|Under the Controlled Substances Act, {{dihydromorphine}} {{is listed}} as a Schedule I substance along with heroin. [...] In the United States, {{its role in the}} production of dihydrocodeine and other related drugs make it a Schedule I substance with one of the higher annual manufacturing quotas granted by the US Drug Enforcement Administration—3300 kilos in 2013; manufacturers, distributors, and importers with the correct DEA license and state permits related thereto are able to use Schedule I drugs in this fashion when they are transformed into something of a lower schedule. The DEA has assigned dihydromorphine and all of its salts, esters, &c the ACSCN of 9145. As with nicomorphine, MDMA, heroin (DEA 2013 production quota: 25 grammes) and the like, dihydromorphine is also used in research such as that mentioned above in properly licensed facilities; Form 225, the most common and least expensive individual researcher's license, does not include Schedule I so the lab must have a higher-level DEA registration [...] As with other licit opioids used for medical purposes in other countries, including even much weaker opioids like nicocodeine, <b>benzylmorphine,</b> and tilidine, the reason for dihydromorphine being in Schedule I is that it was not in medical use in the USA at time the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 was drawn up.|$|E
