5|$|As Ivan {{continued}} to strengthen, it proceeded about 80mi (130km) {{north of the}} ABC islands on September9. High winds <b>blew</b> <b>away</b> roof shingles and produced large swells that battered several coastal facilities. A developing spiral band dropped heavy rainfall over Aruba, causing flooding and $1.1 million worth in structural damage.|$|E
5|$|About 80% of Manila's 7 million {{residents}} lost power {{due to the}} storm. Low-lying areas of Manila were underwater as strong winds <b>blew</b> <b>away</b> roofs of shacks and uprooted trees. Throughout the city, four deaths happened. One man was electrocuted while another man was crushed by debris. Fifty people were confirmed to have died and 2,089 dwellings were damaged in nearby Bataan after storm surge crashed into the area. Most of the casualties in Bataan were due to drownings; the city was also the hardest hit by the storm. Throughout the area near Bataan, 10 villages were destroyed. In Pantalan Luma, all but four of the town's 400 huts were destroyed.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the floods, strong winds <b>blew</b> <b>away</b> many roofs and some entire houses made of mud, leaving thousands of people homeless. The combined effects of the preceding floods and Eline left about 463,000people displaced or homeless, including 46,000children five years old or younger. Overall, the preceding floods and Eline caused about 700deaths, half of whom in Chokwe. with damage estimated at $500million (2000USD). At least 17people died directly due to Eline, although many bodies were washed away and unable to be counted. The cyclone and the floods disrupted much of the economic progress Mozambique had made in the 1990s {{since the end of}} its civil war.|$|E

5|$|To {{start the}} {{construction}} work, {{there was an}} official 'cutting of the first sod' ceremony. This took place in September 1846 The site chosen for the ceremony was a field in Etruria. A roped off enclosure for directors was created and {{the remainder of the}} field was reserved for invited guests. A mile long procession headed by John Lewis Ricardo, Member of Parliament for Stoke-on-Trent and chairman of the NSR Company, formed. On Ricardo's arrival, the crowds broke through the roped off area and Ricardo was pushed and shoved. During the actual cutting he buckled the silver spade and had difficulty removing the sod. Finally, his hat <b>blew</b> <b>away.</b>|$|E
25|$|This tower {{above the}} {{transept}} crossing has undergone several changes since its original {{construction in the}} thirteenth century. Today it features many Flamboyant motifs and structures dating to the early sixteenth century. A tall, slender spire that <b>blew</b> <b>away</b> in a storm in 1705 originally capped the tower.|$|E
25|$|Weather {{conditions}} in the area can be extreme, with the Roaring Forties wind being a particular problem. The maximum wind gust ever recorded was 176km/h. Reportedly, the first keepers of the light took chickens with them to Maatsuyker but the fowls <b>blew</b> <b>away</b> into the ocean. Given the wind and lack of shelter, this is possible if they were left outside during storms. Vegetables get blown flat by the wind, but surprisingly, can be grown successfully, even though the garden is {{on the west side}} of the island, facing into the prevailing winds.|$|E

25|$|Contrary {{to reports}} at the time, {{and what is}} still assumed by many, the {{collapse}} of the wall did not cause the 39 deaths. Instead, the collapse relieved pressure and allowed fans to escape. Most died of suffocation after tripping or being crushed against the wall before the collapse. A further 600 fans were also injured. Bodies were carried out from the stadium on sections of iron fencing and laid outside, covered with giant football flags.

25|$|The team's two {{remaining}} stars, Jason Kidd and Jim Jackson, bickered throughout the season, though {{neither of them}} had any trouble establishing his individual stardom. Jackson led the team in scoring with 19.6 ppg, made 121 three-pointers and was the only Mav to start in all 82 games. Kidd became the first Maverick to be elected a starter in the NBA All-Star Game, and finished second in the league in assists and fourth in steals while averaging 16.6 ppg. George McCloud, who averaged 9.6 ppg in his previous year, <b>blew</b> <b>away</b> his career-high scoring average as the Mavs resorted to the outside shot time and again due to their lack of an inside scoring threat. McCloud averaged 18.9 ppg and made 257 three-pointers, equaling the second-highest individual season total in league history.|$|E

25|$|The 12th (Nelson) Company on {{the right}} of the 1st Canterbury Battalion was faced by machine-gun fire from a ruined pillbox and dugout. The New Zealand advance stopped until the post was overrun by a few men, who {{captured}} the gun and took eight prisoners. The company was more vulnerable to machine-gun fire from Gheluvelt Ridge, when a strong westerly wind <b>blew</b> <b>away</b> the smoke barrage and the British artillery failed to suppress the machine guns in Gheluvelt village. The Nelson Company suffered many casualties from the enfilade fire and the Germans in their path but kept going. As the New Zealanders advanced, sections were dropped off to form a defensive flank along the southern slope of the spur. The sections used Lewis guns and rifles and inflicted many casualties on the Germans and a Lewis gunner knocked out a German machine-gun. Casualties in the Nelson Company prevented the survivors and the left-hand company of the 1st Canterbury from over-running a big blockhouse and reinforcements from the support company were also defeated. To fill the gap left by the reinforcements, the reserve company moved forward through an artillery barrage at Veldhoek to Jericho.|$|E

The church continued to exist in a poor state, so that by 1692 choral services had to be suspended in fear that the roof would collapse.
