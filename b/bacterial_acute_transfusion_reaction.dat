40|$|Aim: This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine the}} incidence and type of <b>acute</b> <b>transfusion</b> <b>reactions</b> in a pediatric intensive care unit. Material and Method: The patients admitted to our pediatric intensive care unit between February 2006 and February 2007 were prospectively recorded. A bedside nurse recorded the patients’ vital signs before, during and up to 4 hours after the transfusions. Results: A total of 762 transfusions were administered to 219 patients during the study period. <b>Acute</b> <b>transfusion</b> <b>reactions</b> were diagnosed in 17. 8 % (n= 38) of transfusions in critically ill children. <b>Acute</b> <b>transfusion</b> <b>reactions</b> incidence rate was found as 4. 9 % (38 / 762). All the <b>acute</b> <b>transfusion</b> <b>reactions</b> were febrile non hemolytic reactions. Febrile non hemolytic reactions were associated 68 % (n= 26) with red blood cell transfusions, 21 % (n= 8) with platelet transfusions and 3. 7 % (n= 4) with intravenous immunoglobulin transfusions. Overall 8 % (n= 8) of platelet, 6. 1 % (n= 26) of red blood cell and 3. 7 % (n= 4) of immunoglobulin infusions were involved in febrile non hemolytic <b>reactions.</b> <b>Transfusions</b> were repeated in 52 % (n= 116) of patients. <b>Acute</b> <b>transfusion</b> <b>reactions</b> incidence rate was found 9 % (n= 11) in multiple transfusions. There was significant association between <b>acute</b> <b>transfusion</b> <b>reactions</b> and multiple <b>transfusions</b> (p= 0. 006). Conclusions: Febrile non hemolytic reactions occur frequently in critically ill pediatric patients who require <b>transfusions.</b> The <b>acute</b> <b>transfusion</b> <b>reaction</b> risk increases with multiple transfusons. The surveillance of transfusions given to pediatric intensive care patients enhances the knowledge about the incidence, type, risk factors and the safety standard required for transfusions.

We determined the incidence and pattern of transfusion-related adverse events reported to the National Blood Service Zimbabwe. Materials and methods. A retrospective review of the transfusion-event records of the National Blood Service Zimbabwe was conducted covering the period from 1 January 1999 to 31 December 2011. All transfusion-related event reports received during the period were analysed. Results. A total of 308 transfusion adverse events (0. 046 %) were reported for 670, 625 blood components distributed. The majority (61. 6 %) of the patients who experienced an adverse event were female. The median age was 36 years (range, 1 - 89 years). The majority (68. 8 %) of the adverse events were <b>acute</b> <b>transfusion</b> <b>reactions</b> consisting of febrile non-haemolytic <b>transfusion</b> <b>reactions</b> (58. 5 %), minor allergies (31. 6 %), haemolytic reactions (5. 2 %), severe allergic reactions (2. 4 %), anaphylaxis (1. 4 %) and hypotension (0. 9 %). Two-thirds (66. 6 %) of the adverse events occurred following administration of whole blood, although only 10. 6 % of the blood was distributed as whole blood.

The incidence of suspected transfusion adverse events was generally lower than the incidences reported globally in countries with well-established haemovigilance systems.

40|$|Background Leukoreduction of labile blood {{components}} dramatically {{decreases the}} frequency of minor, intermediate, and severe adverse events (AEs), referred to as <b>acute</b> <b>transfusion</b> <b>reactions</b> (ATRs), especially after transfusion of platelet components (PCs). The pathophysiology of AEs may result from accumulation of soluble, secreted, platelet (PLT) factors with proinflammatory functions stored in PCs. Thus, several cosynergizing factors associated with PLT accumulation in PCs may contribute to clinically reported ATRs with inflammatory symptoms. Study Design and Methods We screened for 65 PLT-associated secretory products in PCs that caused ATRs and identified PLT molecules associated with ATRs and inflammation. A functional in vitro study using PC supernatants assayed on reporting immune cells was performed to indicate relevance. Results Among 10, 600 apheresis PCs, 30 caused inflammatory ATRs and contained significantly elevated levels of soluble CD 40 ligand (sCD 40 L), interleukin (IL) - 27, and soluble OX 40 ligand (sOX 40 L). Normal PLTs secreted IL- 27 and sOX 40 L at bioactive concentrations upon thrombin stimulation and were up regulated in association with ATRs, similar to sCD 40 L. Other secreted products were identified but not investigated further as their positivity was not consistent. Conclusions This study demonstrates the putative participation of PLT-derived sOX 40 L, IL- 27, and sCD 40 L, which accumulate in PC supernatants, with inflammatory-type ATRs. Further studies are required to determine the clinical significance of these findings to forecast preventive measures whenever possible...|$|R

The objective {{of this study was}} to further characterize the safety profile of INTERCEPT-treated platelet components (PCT-PLT) administered across a broad patient population. Materials and Methods This open-label, observational haemovigilance programme of PCT-PLT transfusions was conducted in 21 centres in 11 countries. All transfusions were monitored for adverse events within 24 h post-transfusion and for serious adverse events (SAEs) up to 7 days post-transfusion. All adverse events were assessed for severity (Grade 0 - 4), and causal relationship to PCT-PLT transfusion. Results Over the course of 7 years in the study centres, 4067 patients received 19 175 PCT-PLT transfusions. Adverse events were infrequent, and most were of Grade 1 severity. On a per-transfusion basis, 123 (0. 6 %) were classified an <b>acute</b> <b>transfusion</b> <b>reaction</b> (ATR) defined as an adverse event related to the transfusion. Among these ATRs, the most common were chills (77, 0. 4 %) and urticaria (41, 0. 2 %). Fourteen SAEs were reported, of which 2 were attributed to platelet transfusion (< 0. 1 %). No case of transfusion-related acute lung injury, transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease, transfusion-transmitted infection or death was attributed to the transfusion of PCT-PLT.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Red {{blood cell}} {{transfusion}} related to select surgical procedures accounts for approximately 2. 8 million transfusions in the United States yearly and occurs commonly after hip fracture surgeries. Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated lack of clinical benefit with higher versus lower transfusion thresholds in postoperative hip fracture repair patients with cardiac disease or {{risk factors for}} cardiac disease. The economic implications of a higher versus lower hemoglobin (Hb) threshold {{have not yet been}} investigated. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A decision tree analysis was constructed to estimate differences in healthcare costs and charges between a Hb transfusion threshold strategy of 8 g/dL versus 10 g/dL from the perspective of both Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) as well as hospitals. Secondary outcome measures included differences in transfusion-related adverse events. RESULTS: Among the 133, 697 Medicare beneficiaries undergoing hip fracture repair in 2012, we estimated that 45, 457 patients would be anemic and at risk for transfusion. CMS would save an estimated $ 11. 3 million to $ 24. 3 million in payments, while hospitals would reduce charges by an estimated $ 52. 7 million to $ 93. 6 million if the restrictive transfusion strategy were to be implemented nationally. Additionally, rates of transfusion-associated circulatory overload, transfusion-related acute lung injury, <b>acute</b> <b>transfusion</b> <b>reactions,</b> length of stay, and mortality would be reduced. CONCLUSIONS: This model suggests that the uniform adoption of a restrictive transfusion strategy among patients with cardiac disease and risk factors for cardiac disease undergoing hip fracture repair would result in significant reductions in clinically important outcomes with significant cost savings...|$|R

Other transfusion hazards persist, including human error resulting in the inadvertent transfusion of incompatible blood, <b>acute</b> and delayed <b>transfusion</b> <b>reactions,</b> transfusion-related <b>acute</b> lung injury (TRALI), transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (TA-GVHD), and transfusion-induced immunomodulation. These infectious and noninfectious hazards are reviewed briefly {{in the context of their}} historical evolution...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: An active {{haemovigilance}} programme {{was implemented}} to survey adverse events (AE) associated with transfusion of platelets photochemically treated with amotosalen and ultraviolet A (PCT-PLT). The results of 5106 transfusions {{have already been}} reported. Here we report {{the results of an}} additional 7437 PCT-PLT transfusions. METHODS: The focus of this ongoing haemovigilance programme is to document all AEs associated with PCT-PLT transfusion. Data collected for AEs include: time of event after starting transfusion, clinical descriptions, vital signs, results from radiographs and bacterial cultures, event severity (Grade 0 - 4) and causal relationship to PCT-PLT transfusion. RESULTS: One thousand four hundred patients (mean 60 years, range 1 - 96) received PCT-PLT transfusions. The majority of the patients (53. 4 %) had haematology-oncology diseases and required conventional chemotherapy (44. 8 %) or stem cell transplantation (8. 6 %). Sixty-eight PCT-PLT transfusions were associated with AE. <b>Acute</b> <b>transfusion</b> <b>reactions</b> (ATR), classified as an AE possibly related, probably related, or related to PCT-PLT transfusions were infrequent (n = 55, 55 / 7437 = 0. 7 %) and most were of Grade 1 severity. Thirty-nine patients (39 / 1400 = 2. 8 %) experienced one or more ATRs. The most frequently reported signs/symptoms were chills, fever, urticaria, dyspnoea, nausea and vomiting. Five AEs were considered severe (> or = Grade 2); however, no causal relationship to PCT-PLT transfusion was found. Repeated exposure to PCT-PLT did not increase the likelihood of an ATR. No cases of transfusion-related acute lung injury and no deaths due to PCT-PLT transfusions were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Routine transfusion of PCT-PLT is well-tolerated {{in a wide range of}} patients. ATRs related to PCT-PLT transfusion were infrequent and most were of mild severity...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundKpa antigen {{is a low}} {{incidence}} red blood cell antigen within the Kell system. Anti-Kpa alloantibody {{may be associated with}} acute and delayed hemolytic <b>transfusion</b> <b>reactions.</b> Case StudyWe report a case of a clinically significant <b>acute</b> extravascular hemolytic <b>transfusion</b> <b>reaction</b> mediated by previously unrecognized (and undetected) anti-Kpa alloantibody. This reaction occurred in a patient who met all criteria for electronic crossmatch, resulting in the transfusion of an incompatible red cell unit. ResultsPost-transfusion investigation showed the transfused red cell unit was crossmatch compatible at the immediate spin phase but was 3 [*]+[*]incompatible at the antiglobulin phase. No evidence of intravascular hemolysis was observed upon visual comparison of the pre- and post-transfusion peripheral blood plasma. Further testing showed the presence of anti-Kpa antibody. The clinical course of the patient included acute febrile and systemic reaction. ConclusionAcute extravascular hemolytic <b>transfusion</b> <b>reaction</b> may occur due to undetected anti-Kpa alloantibody. Various strategies for crossmatching are discussed in the context of antibodies to {{low incidence}} antigens...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Photochemical {{pathogen}} inactivation treatment (PCT) of plasma components with amotosalen and UVA {{has been}} implemented in Europe. To establish a postapproval safety database, an active hemovigilance (HV) program utilizing an electronic data capture system (EDCS) was initiated. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The response to transfusion was documented after each PCT-plasma transfusion. The primary outcome was {{the incidence of}} <b>acute</b> <b>transfusion</b> <b>reactions</b> (ATRs) within 24 hours of transfusion. An ATR was defined as an adverse event (AE) possibly related, probably related, or related to the PCT-plasma transfusion. For AEs, the following were collected: time of event after transfusion, clinical description, vital signs, clinical and laboratory test results, severity (Grade 0 - 4), seriousness, and causal relationship to transfusion of PCT-plasma. RESULTS: To date, 3232 patients (59. 1 % male) with a primary indication for plasma transfusion due to a hematology disorder (23. 1 %), surgery (32. 4 %), or a general medical condition (44. 4 %) received 7483 PCT-plasma transfusions (composed of 19, 069 apheresis plasma components). The {{mean age of the}} patient population was 57. 3 years (2884 adults, 160 children, and 188 infants). ATRs were reported for 8 / 7483 transfusions (0. 11 %; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 03 - 0. 19) and 8 / 3232 patients (0. 25 %; 95 % CI, 0. 08 - 0. 42 %). Five ATRs were of Grade 1 severity. The remaining three ATRs were classified as serious. No deaths or episodes of transfusion-related acute lung injury attributed to a PCT-plasma transfusion were reported. CONCLUSION: PCT-plasma transfusions were well tolerated in routine clinical use. The EDCS HV program facilitated collection and reporting of safety information on a real-time basis from multiple sites...|$|R
40|$|An <b>acute</b> {{hemolytic}} <b>transfusion</b> <b>reaction</b> {{resulting from}} dog erythrocyte antigen (DEA) 1. 1 incompatibility {{developed in a}} dog previously sensitized to DEA 1. 1 by a transfusion 3 years earlier. The dog developed fever, pigmenturia, and lethargy, and its pcv did not rise as expected. The donor blood was type DEA 1. 1 positive, whereas the recipient's blood was type DEA 1. 1, DEA 1. 2, and DEA 7 negative. A major crossmatch was later found to be strongly incompatible. Studies of the recipient's plasma revealed a specific anti-DEA 1. 1 alloantibody of the IgG class with high hemolysin and agglutinin activity. Such <b>acute</b> hemolytic <b>transfusion</b> <b>reactions</b> can be avoided by crossmatching previously transfused dogs and by using dogs that are type DEA 1. 1 negative (and preferably also type DEA 1. 2 and DEA 7 negative) as blood donors. -U.
