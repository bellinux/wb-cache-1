5|$|The {{object of}} {{blackjack}} {{is for a}} player to defeat the dealer by obtaining a total as close to 21 as possible without accumulating a total that exceeds this number. In blackjack, the standard rule {{is that if the}} player is dealt a pair of identically ranked initial cards, known as a pair, the player is allowed to split them into separate hands and ask for a new second card for each while placing a full initial bet identical to the original wager with each. After placing the wager for the split hands the dealer gives the player an additional card for each split card. The two hands created by splitting are considered independently in competition against the dealer. Splitting allows the gambler to turn a bad hand into one or two hands with a good possibility of winning. It also allows the player to double the bet when the dealer busts. Some rules even allow for resplitting until the player has as many as four hands or allow doubling the bet after a split so that each hand has a bet double the original. The standard rules are that when a <b>bet</b> <b>is</b> doubled on a hand, the player is only allowed to draw one more card for that hand.|$|E

5000|$|In 2003, Seattle Storm {{point guard}} Sue Bird made a bet with morning host Mitch Levy that gained {{national}} publicity. The <b>bet</b> <b>was</b> over Bird's season assist/turnover ratio.

40|$|In parimutuel betting markets, it {{has been}} {{observed}} that proportionally too many <b>bets</b> <b>are</b> placed on longshots, late <b>bets</b> <b>are</b> more informative than early bets, and a sizeable fraction of <b>bets</b> <b>are</b> placed early. We propose an explanation for these facts based on equilibrium incentives of privately informed rational bettors, who profit from betting against bettors with recreational motives. We show that small rational bettors who act on private information have an incentive to wait until the last minute, and then bet without access to the information of the others.

25|$|For late {{surrender}}, however, {{while it}} is tempting to opt for surrender on any hand which will probably lose, the correct strategy is to only surrender on the very worst hands, because having even a one in four chance of winning the full <b>bet</b> <b>is</b> better than losing half the bet and pushing the other half, as entailed by surrendering.|$|E
25|$|The side wager is {{typically}} {{placed in a}} designated area next to the box for the main wager. A player wishing to wager on a side <b>bet</b> <b>is</b> usually required to place a wager on blackjack. Some games require that the blackjack wager should equal or exceed any side bet wager. A non-controlling player of a blackjack hand is usually permitted to place a side bet {{regardless of whether the}} controlling player does so.|$|E
5000|$|Players {{can place}} bet any point number (4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10) by placing their wager in the come area {{and telling the}} dealer how much and on what number(s), [...] "30 on the 6", [...] "5 on the 5" [...] or [...] "25 buy the 10". Both place and buy <b>bets</b> <b>are</b> <b>bets</b> that the number <b>bet</b> on will <b>be</b> rolled before a 7 <b>is</b> rolled. These <b>bets</b> <b>are</b> {{considered}} working <b>bets,</b> {{and will continue to}} be paid out each time a shooter rolls the place or buy point number. By rules, place <b>bets</b> <b>are</b> NOT working on the come out roll but can be [...] "turned on" [...] by the player. Players may remove or reduce (<b>bet</b> must <b>be</b> at least table minimum) this bet anytime before it loses (seven out).|$|R

25|$|Double down: The {{player is}} allowed to {{increase}} the initial bet by up to 100% in exchange for committing to stand after receiving exactly one more card. The additional <b>bet</b> <b>is</b> placed in the betting box next to the original bet. Some games do not permit the player to increase the bet by amounts other than 100%. Non-controlling players may double their wager or decline to do so, but they are bound by the controlling player's decision to take only one card.|$|E
25|$|BET also airs {{a program}} block called BET Inspiration which {{features}} Christian programming. This block airs {{in lieu of}} infomercials in late night, which the network has not aired since 1997; <b>BET</b> <b>is</b> {{one of a handful}} of cable channels and one of only two Viacom-owned networks to have discontinued airing infomercials (sister network Nick at Nite ran infomercials in some overnight timeslots from 1987 to 1998, with series airing in that daypart since then). In the years after the cancellation of 106 & Park, would BET resume airing infomercials in early mornings and, in 2017, its Christian programming block changed its name to BET Rejoice.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, the {{insurance}} <b>bet</b> <b>is</b> susceptible to advantage play. It is advantageous {{to make an}} insurance bet whenever the hole card {{has more than a}} chance of one in three of being a ten. Advantage play techniques can sometimes identify such situations. In a multi-hand, face-up, single deck game, it is possible to establish whether insurance is a good bet simply by observing the other cards on the table after the deal; even if there are just 2 player hands exposed, and neither of their two initial cards is a ten, then 16 in 47 of the remaining cards are tens, which is larger than 1 in 3, so insurance is a good bet. This is an elementary example of the family of advantage play techniques known as card counting.|$|E

The Lottery draws six numbers plus a Bonus Ball. The top prize (matching the first six numbers) on a $2 wager is $1,000,000; however the top prize is [...] "taxes paid" [...] (the actual prize, $1,408,451, is before withholding, which is to be reported for tax purposes; the after withholding amount is $1,000,000.) Top prizes on $1 and 50-cent wagers are proportionally smaller.|$|E

The restoration consisted of repainting, cleaning and recovering all in the original color scheme. Furniture was restored to its original state and replicas replaced what could not be restored.

After 24 hours, Stewie asks for the money owed, but Brian {{says he does not}} have it and to give him until next Friday.

Eventually, Brian agrees to pay off the bet. After Stewie's <b>bet</b> <b>is</b> satisfied, he offers Brian an opportunity to get one [...] "free revenge shot" [...] to make up for all the torture he caused. Brian accepts the offer, but leaves Stewie in suspense as to when the free hit will be delivered, until Stewie is overcome with paranoia and starts beating himself up in an attempt to satisfy Brian. After biding his time and making Stewie worry about what could happen, Brian—while the Griffins are in London, leaving the Patriots-Silly Nannies game—nonchalantly shoves Stewie in front of a moving bus.|$|E
500|$|The kibbutz {{started as}} a {{portable}} community (gar'in) called [...] "Kibbutz Hashomer Hatzair Bet" [...] (<b>Bet</b> <b>is</b> the second letter in Hebrew). It's pioneers gathered on 21 January 1922 in Neve Sha'anan, Haifa by Polish Jews, of Hashomer Hatzair movement from Galicia who arrived during the Third Aliyah. The members came from a group named [...] "Dror" [...] from Afula and from two other groups who worked near Jerusalem, {{as well as a}} few unaffiliated pioneers. At its formation the kibbutz had 80 members. During its first year, the number of members shrank to 65. In the summer of 1922 the members moved to Nahalal where they helped with swamp drying and road paving. At Nahalal some members suffered from diseases and lack of livelihood. In early 1924 the number was at 60, as old members left and new ones joined. Most of the reasons for leaving were the difficulty adjusting to the kibbutz life. Others left because they wished to continue their academic career, others because of their families and some because of ideological opposition. In 1925 the kibbutz, which consisted of 60 adults and six children, moved to Afula. In Afula, the kibbutz united with another HaShomer HaTzair kibbutz called [...] "Kibbutz HaShomer HaTzair Dalet" [...] (the fourth letter in Hebrew), which was formed in Hadera in 1924. After the unification the number of members rose to 90. The members were given the land for settlement in November 1926 and 15 men and women left Afula and settled in a khan on Tell Abu Shusha next to the Arab village of Abu Shusha, where they worked the land. In the next year two mules were bought and 120 dunams of fields of wheat and barley were sowed until the kibbutz moved to its current location.|$|E
