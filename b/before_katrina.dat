5|$|Holloway's family, however, {{took the}} {{opposite}} approach and criticized the lessening of coverage of her disappearance {{due to a}} shift in news priority when Hurricane Katrina struck on August 23, 2005. The saturation coverage of Holloway's disappearance was finally eclipsed by the hurricane. Beth Twitty and Dave Holloway alleged that Aruba {{took advantage of the}} extensive coverage of Hurricane Katrina to release the suspects, however the deadline for judicial review of Van der Sloot's detention was set long <b>before</b> <b>Katrina.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Hurricane Katrina and the {{subsequent}} 2005 levee failures in Greater New Orleans, the congregation's building at 7000 Canal Boulevard filled with at least ten feet of water, and Beth Israel garnered national attention after {{attempts were made to}} save its Torah scrolls. Beth Israel's rabbi, Yisroel Shiff, who had evacuated to Tennessee <b>before</b> <b>Katrina</b> hit, contacted Rabbi Isaac Leider, who had worked on ZAKA search-and-rescue teams in Israel for five years. After contacting federal officials and the Louisiana National Guard, Leider hired a helicopter to fly him to within a mile of Beth Israel, met with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) search-and-rescue team appointed to retrieve the scrolls. The group used rubber rafts to reach Beth Israel and enter it, where Leider waded into the sanctuary and rescued the Torah scrolls and their silver ornaments.|$|E
5|$|On August25, Florida's Emergency Operations Center was {{activated}} in Tallahassee {{to monitor}} {{the progress of the}} hurricane. <b>Before</b> <b>Katrina</b> moved ashore, schools and businesses were closed in the Miami area. Cruise ships altered their paths due to seaports in southeastern Florida closing. Officials in Miami-Dade County advised residents in mobile homes or with special needs to evacuate. To the north in Broward County, residents east of the Intracoastal Waterway or in mobile homes were advised to leave their homes. Evacuation orders were issued for offshore islands in Palm Beach County, and for residents in mobile homes south of Lantana Road. Shelters were opened across the region. Officials closed the Miami International Airport, Fort Lauderdale – Hollywood International Airport, Key West International Airport, and Florida Keys Marathon Airport due to the storm. In Monroe and Collier counties, schools were closed, and a shelter was opened in Immokalee.|$|E

5|$|About {{nine hours}} after the system {{developed}} on August24, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) issued a tropical storm watch from the Seven Mile Bridge to Vero Beach. Later that day, the watch was upgraded to a tropical storm warning and hurricane watch from Florida City to Vero Beach after the storm's intensification became apparent. About 25hours <b>before</b> <b>Katrina</b> made landfall, the tropical storm watch was extended northward to Titusville, and a tropical storm warning and a hurricane watch was issued for Lake Okeechobee. Early on August25, a hurricane warning was issued from Florida City to Vero Beach and for Lake Okeechobee. In southeastern Florida, the lead time for the hurricane watch and warning occurred 31.5 and 19.5hours before landfall, respectively; both were 16.5hours less than the desired lead time. A tropical storm warning was also issued from Florida Key, southward through the Florida Keys to the Dry Tortugas, and northward along the western coast to Longboat Key. The warning in the Florida Keys occurred only nine hours {{before the onset of}} tropical storm force winds.|$|E
2500|$|Sheriff Lee {{maintained}} a strong presence during Hurricane Katrina.

5|$|Three days <b>before</b> <b>Katrina's</b> {{second and}} third landfalls, the National Hurricane Center began {{predicting}} that the storm would make landfall as a major hurricane. By the next morning, on August 27, the NHC issued a hurricane watch that included the New Orleans metro area, which was upgraded to a hurricane warning by 10:00p.m. CDT that same evening. At this point, Katrina was a Category3 hurricane with 115mph (185km/h) winds and about 335miles (540km) to the south-southeast of the Mississippi River's mouth.|$|R
2500|$|There are {{indications}} that the soft earth and peat underlying canal walls may have given way.

2500|$|Landrieu {{emphasized}} {{his record}} {{in the state legislature}} and as Lieutenant Governor, and his ability to build consensus among a broad range of political players. [...] For their part, the Landrieu campaign criticized Nagin's go-it-alone governing style as alienating to New Orleans's potential allies, and his frequent gaffes as embarrassing to the city. [...] Landrieu said he would restore credibility to city government and jump-start a lethargic rebuilding process: a major Landrieu slogan was [...] "What was OK <b>before</b> <b>Katrina</b> isn't OK after Katrina." [...] Landrieu ads featured shots of the city's abandoned flooded cars and blamed Nagin for his lack of leadership.|$|E
2500|$|No {{reliable}} figures currently {{exist for}} the size and ethnic makeup of New Orleans’s current population. [...] It is widely recognized, however, that the current demographics of New Orleans are on average more white and more affluent than they were <b>before</b> <b>Katrina.</b> [...] This made {{it very hard to}} predict the outcome of the election. [...] This new demographic reality encouraged many candidates that might not have considered entering the race before the storm. [...] New Orleans has not had a white mayor since 1978, but a large number of candidates - including every candidate considered to have a 'serious' chance of winning other than incumbent Nagin - were white.|$|E
2500|$|On March 4 Nagin {{appeared}} {{before an audience}} of New Orleans evacuees at an event organized by the NAACP, where he made the statement that [...] "there was {{all this talk about}} this being an opportunity to change New Orleans forever and maybe everybody shouldn’t come back, and maybe this is an opportunity to kind of change New Orleans and go back to what it used to be. I have 23 candidates running for mayor and very few of them look like us. [...] There's a potential to be a major change in the political structure of New Orleans." [...] Some perceived these comments to be a divisive follow-up to his [...] "Chocolate City" [...] remarks, while others point out that the fact that Nagin is the only major African-American candidate in a field of 23 is a sign of the demographic shift in a city that was over two-thirds black <b>before</b> <b>Katrina.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Ray Nagin : Incumbent mayor Ray Nagin sought re-election. [...] <b>Before</b> <b>Katrina,</b> he {{was widely}} {{perceived}} {{as having a}} very high chance of re-election, but the new political climate left his level of support uncertain. [...] Nagin faced strong criticism of his handling of Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath. [...] Many middle- and upper-class white voters, who supported him in the 2002 election and were vital to his success in that contest, were alienated by his ‘chocolate city’ speech in January 2006, and very few white voters supported him this time. [...] The elements {{of the business community}} that were such an important part of his support base in 2002 mainly supported other candidates, while Nagin's business-oriented plans for reconstruction in New Orleans have alienated many voters. [...] Moreover, the city’s black majority has been significantly reduced, and many in the city’s black community were critical of Nagin even before the hurricane, citing amongst other issues {{the fact that he was}} known to have conservative politics and had supported Republican candidates in the past. [...] Nagin campaigned on his experience as mayor and in defense of his record, arguing that New Orleans needs experienced leadership in a crisis situation. [...] After being defeated in the primary, Rob Couhig, Virginia Boulet, and Tom Watson endorsed Nagin in the runoff.|$|E
2500|$|Anderson's work (his family's collection) was, {{partially}} destroyed when Hurricane Katrina struck Ocean Springs in 2005, and {{the storm}} surge penetrated the small cinderblock building that had been built to house his works owned by his family safely after Hurricane Camille. There was extensive water damage to the watercolors, drawings, manuscripts, and other objects that were kept there, and much of this work, from the Anderson Family collection, was dried and removed to Mississippi State University. Some has been restored by conservator Margaret Moreland. [...] Works housed on site at the Walter Anderson Museum of Art, Ocean Springs, were undamaged, although part of the offsite collection was (in 2006 the Museum undertook the restoration of Anderson's original linoleum blocks and other works.) The condition of the Community Center mural was worsened by the storm, and it was announced in June 2006 {{that it would be}} restored by a team from the Winterthur Conservation Project. Manuscripts of Anderson's writing, much of it unpublished, were kept at Shearwater and were damaged or destroyed. Fortunately, years earlier Anderson's correspondence and much of his other writing had been microfilmed for the Archives of American Art. Still more writing and biographical materials were photocopied <b>before</b> <b>Katrina</b> by Anderson biographer Christopher Maurer and those copies have been donated, together with copies of the archives of Shearwater Pottery, to Archives and Special Collections at the JD Williams Library, University of Mississippi.|$|E

500|$|<b>Before</b> <b>Katrina’s</b> {{landfall}} in 2005, {{the economy}} of New Orleans relied heavily on its usefulness and income derived from being a port city.
