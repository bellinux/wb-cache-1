The literature on various breast elastography techniques is reviewed, and recommendations are made on evidence-based results. Practical advice is given on how to perform and interpret breast elastography for optimal results, with emphasis placed on avoiding pitfalls. Artifacts are reviewed, and the clinical utility of some artifacts is discussed. Both strain and shear wave techniques have been shown to be highly accurate in characterizing breast lesions as benign or malignant. The relationship between the various techniques is discussed, and recommended interpretation based on a BI-RADS-like malignancy probability scale is provided.

40|$|AbstractObjectives: Preoperative breast volume {{estimation}} is {{very important}} for the success of the breast surgery. In the present study, two different breast volume determination methods, Cavalieri principle and 3 D reconstruction were compared. Material and methods: Consecutive sections were taken in slice thickness of 5  mm. Every 2 nd <b>breast</b> <b>section</b> in a set of consecutive sections was selected. We marked breast tissue with blue line on each selected section, and so prepared CT scans used for breast volume estimation. The volumes of the 60 breasts were estimated using the Cavalieri principle and 3 D reconstruction. Results: The mean breast volume value was established to be 467. 79  ±  188. 90  cm 3 with Cavalieri method and 465. 91  ±  191. 41  cm 3 with 3 D reconstruction. The mean CE for the estimates in this study was calculated as 0. 25 %. Skin-sparing volume was about 91. 64 % of the whole breast volume. Both methods are very accurate and have a strong linear association. Conclusion: Our results suggest that the calculation of breast volume or its part in vivo from systematic series of CT scans using the Cavalieri principle or 3 D breast reconstruction is accurate enough to have a significant clinical benefit in planning reconstructive breast surgery. These methods can help the surgeon guide the choice of the most appropriate implant or/and flap preoperatively...|$|E

40|$|The <b>Breast</b> <b>Section</b> of the Italian Society of Radiology {{set up a}} {{cooperative}} study which included 17 Departments of Radiology and Breast Diagnosis in order to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of US versus mammography in nonpalpable breast lesions. From January 1, 1989 to december 31, 1990, 400 nonpalpable breast lesions (142 benign lesions, 59 in situ and 199 infiltrating carcinomas) were detected by mammography and/or US; they had questionable/suspicious findings which called for further investigation by means of cytology and/or histology. US proved much less sensitive in non-palpable carcinomas than mammography (49. 2 % vs 93. 8 %), also in younger women, and failed to detect 50 % of the benign/malignant nonpalpable lesions identified by mammography. US sensitivity was directly related to lesion diameter and probe frequency: 38. 7 % in infiltrating carcinomas 10 mm; 12 % in the patients examined with a 5 -MHz probe vs 57. 7 % in those examined with a > or = 7. 5 -MHz probe. Furthermore, the most significant US patterns of nonpalpable lesion were irregular contours, posterior attenuation and irregular internal echoes, while an irregular skin line and Cooper ligaments had no significant relation with carcinoma. Thus, breast US cannot {{be used as a}} screening test on asymptomatic patients not even on young women with radiologically dense breasts. On the contrary, US performed with high-frequency probes is useful in the assessment of nonpalpable lesions identified by mammography, and allows, in many cases, US-guided cytology and preoperative localizatio...|$|E

It is managed {{in conjunction with the}} Australian Safety and Efficacy Register of New Interventional Procedures – Surgical. An overview of results for invasive breast cancer from January 1999 until December 2004 is presented to provide preliminary data for participating surgeons. Methods: Invasive breast cancer cases were retrieved from the National Breast Cancer Audit database for the 274 participating breast surgeons in Australia and New Zealand. Data for a variety of clinical parameters were analysed to provide an overview of the diagnostic, histological, surgical and adjuvant therapy management issues. Results: There were 25 026 cases of invasive breast cancer. Annual percentages of mammographically detected cancers from 1999 to 2004 did not differ significantly. Breast-conserving surgery rates also remained stable at 60 %. Margins were involved in 5 % of patients; an additional 9 % had final margins of less than 1 mm. Radiotherapy followed breast-conserving surgery in most cases (86 %). Patients undergoing mastectomy with large tumours (> 5 cm) underwent radiotherapy in 71 % of cases. When at least four lymph nodes were positive, radiotherapy followed mastectomy in the majority (75 %) of cases. The most frequently carried out axillary procedure was a level 2 dissection. Chemotherapy was received by 78 % of oestrogen receptor negative, axillary node positive, postmenopausal patients. Tamoxifen was used in the majority (83 %) of oestrogen receptor positive cases. Conclusion: Surgeons contributing their invasive breast cancer data show a high quality of treatment. Some further improvement may be possibly related to excision margins and tamoxifen prescription for oestrogen receptor negative cancers. Chemotherapy prescription might also warrant further investigation.

After establishing a correlation between IHC and/or FISH and MT-PCR results, the ER/Her- 2 status of a further 32 randomly selected, archival breast tumour specimens was established by MT-PCR in a blinded fashion, and compared to IHC/FISH results. Results MT-PCR levels of ER and Her- 2 showed good concordance with IHC and FISH results. Furthermore, among the ER positive tumours, MT-PCR provided a quantitative score with a high dynamic range. Threshold values obtained from this data set applied to 32 archival tumour specimens showed that tumours strongly positive for ER and/or Her- 2 expression were easily identified by MT-PCR.

Materials and Methods: Paraffin embedded histologically proven invasive <b>breast</b> tissue <b>sections</b> that were obtained from 40 patients and the adjacent normal <b>breast</b> tissue <b>sections</b> used as controls to determine breast carcinoma specific changes in the expression of BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Results: Majority of the cases express either low or no detectable level of BRCA 1 expression in tumor tissues in comparison with control; the decline in BRCA 1 expression was found to be more prominent in advanced grade 3 disease. On the other hand, the expression of BRCA 2 protein was moderate or low in breast cancer cases and its overall distribution did not show significant difference when compared with controls. Interestingly, those breast cancer cases, which were found to express low or no BRCA 1 expression, demonstrated a higher protein level of BRCA 2. The inverse correlation of BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 expression was more prominent in post-menopausal patients. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate in a subset of cases that decline in BRCA 1 expression that may be associated with potentially compensatory increase in BRCA 2 protein, which may depend on tumor grade as well as menopausal status...|$|R

40|$|The MHC class I chain-related gene A (MICA) is {{frequently}} expressed {{on the surface}} of intestinal epithelium and by many epithelial tumours. MICA is a stress-induced antigen which was identified as an activator of natural killer cells via interaction with the NKG 2 D receptor. We have raised a rabbit polyclonal antibody against a synthetic peptide that recognises denatured MICA on both Western blots and in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections. In the present study this antibody was used to undertake a definitive study of 530 breast cancer cases with mean follow up of 7 years to determine the prognostic significance of MICA expression. To detect any association between MICA expression and NK infiltration, whole sections of 50 tumours were also analysed for CD 56 staining. Univariate analysis showed significant relationships between MICA expression and histological grade (P =  0. 006), lymph node stage (P =  0. 013), Nottingham Prognostic Index (NPI, P =  0. 002), the presence of vascular invasion (P =  0. 045) and tumour type (P =  0. 023). Upregulation of MICA was more often found in histological grade 3, poor prognosis (NPI > 5. 4) tumours. Association of high MICA expression with NK cell infiltration was not demonstrated, as very few NK cells were present in whole <b>breast</b> <b>sections.</b> Our results suggest that induced expression of MICA may be an indicator of poor prognosis in breast carcinoma and is indicative of a tumour environment that has undergone stresses such as apoptosis, necrosis, or hypoxia...|$|R

40|$|Fourier Transform InfraRed (FTIR) {{spectroscopy}} {{coupled to}} microscopy (IR imaging) has shown unique advantages in detecting morphological and molecular pathologic alterations in biological tissues. The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate the potential of IR imaging as a diagnostic tool to identify characteristics of breast epithelial cells and the stroma. In this study a total of 19 breast tissue samples were obtained from 13 patients. For 6 of the patients, we also obtained Non-Adjacent Non-Tumor tissue samples. Infrared images were recorded on the main cell/tissue types identified in all breast tissue samples. Unsupervised Principal Component Analyses and supervised Partial Least Square Discriminant Analyses (PLS-DA) were used to discriminate spectra. Leave-one-out cross-validation was used to evaluate the performance of PLS-DA models. Our results show that IR imaging coupled with PLS-DA can efficiently identify the main cell types present in FFPE <b>breast</b> tissue <b>sections,</b> i. e. epithelial cells, lymphocytes, connective tissue, vascular tissue and erythrocytes. A second PLS-DA model could distinguish normal and tumor breast epithelial cells in the <b>breast</b> tissue <b>sections.</b> A patient-specific model reached particularly high sensitivity, specificity and MCC rates. Finally, we showed that the stroma located close or at distance from the tumor exhibits distinct spectral characteristics. In conclusion FTIR imaging combined with computational algorithms could be an accurate, rapid and objective tool to identify/quantify breast epithelial cells and differentiate tumor from normal breast tissue as well as normal from tumor-associated stroma, paving the way to the establishment of a potential complementary tool to ensure safe tumor margins.

Tissues were chosen to represent a relevant variation in tumor type, grade, patient age, and menopausal status. By comparison, there was 65 % positive staining for estrogen receptor, 61 % for progesterone receptor, 67 % for nuclear p 53, and 39 % for c-Erb-B 2 with the invasive <b>breast</b> cancer <b>sections.</b> Reaction with the normal tissue types examined (67) was restricted to the vasopressinergic magnocellular neurons of the hypothalamus, where provasopressin is normally produced, and the posterior pituitary, where these neurons terminate.

Previously, we demonstrated that polyclonal antibodies to proAVP detected that protein in all breast cancer samples examined, but there was no reaction with breast tissue containing fibrocystic disease. The results presented here not only expand upon those earlier results, but they also demonstrate the specificity and effectiveness of what may be considered a more clinically-relevant agent. Thus, proAVP appears to be an attractive target for the detection of invasive breast cancer and DCIS, and these results suggest that MAG 1 may be a beneficial tool for use in the development of such strategies...|$|R

40|$|We {{welcome the}} {{comments}} of Speirs and her co-workers concerning the variation and expression of ERb protein in breast cancer tissues as reported by ourselves (Saunders et al, 2002 a) and Skliris et al (2001).

If sensitivity (and the methodology which might lead to this is discussed below), then discrepancies may be resolved by determining appropriate cut-off values. On the other hand, differences in specificity may produce variations that are not simply related to ERb expression. It may therefore be useful to add the following perspective.

Poor cytotoxicity exerted by tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) against tumour cells in vitro, combined with continued tumour growth in vivo, suggests deficiencies in TIL function or numbers.

Control subjects were matched to each case subject on NBSS study arm, screening center, year of birth, and age at diagnosis of benign <b>breast</b> disease. Histologic <b>sections</b> of benign and cancerous breast tissues were analyzed immunohistochemically. Information on potential confounding factors was obtained by use of a self-administered lifestyle questionnaire. Results...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Efficient use {{of whole}} slide imaging in {{pathology}} needs automated {{region of interest}} (ROI) retrieval and classification, {{through the use of}} image analysis and data sorting tools. One possible method for data sorting uses Spectral Analysis for Dimensionality Reduction. We present some interesting results in the field of histopathology and cytohematology. In histopathology, we developed a Computer-Aided Diagnosis system applied to low-resolution images representing the totality of histological <b>breast</b> tumour <b>sections.</b> The images can be digitized directly at low resolution or be obtained from sub-sampled high-resolution virtual slides. Spectral Analysis is used (1) for image segmentation (stroma, tumour epithelium), by determining a «distance» between all the images of the database, (2) for choosing representative images and characteristic patterns of each histological type in order to index them, and (3) for visualizing images or features similar to a sample provided by the pathologist. In cytohematology, we studied a blood smear virtual slide acquired through high resolution oil scanning and Spectral Analysis is used to sort selected nucleated blood cell classes so that the pathologist may easily focus on specific classes whose morphology could then be studied more carefully or which can be analyzed through complementary instruments, like Multispectral Imaging or Raman MicroSpectroscopy. </p...|$|R
