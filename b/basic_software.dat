5|$|The {{game was}} the first title in the Fire Emblem series on a {{portable}} console. While development of a handheld Fire Emblem title had been considered for earlier games, the team felt available hardware lacked the expression to realize their vision. The GBA offered technical capacities superior to the Super Famicom, the release platform of the last Fire Emblem title , while also offering portability, making it more appealing to players. The platform was also chosen due to estimated development time and budget considerations. Developing for the new hardware proved challenging in some respects, and easy in others such as creating <b>basic</b> <b>software.</b> During development, two different versions were developed while the team were {{getting used to the}} new hardware. One of the main issues they faced was the limited resolution and screen size of the GBA. The game's combat animations were intended to evoke scenes from high fantasy, such as The Lord of the Rings, contrasting with the equivalent styles of fantasy fighting in Japanese stories.|$|E
25|$|In the letter, Gates {{expressed}} {{frustration with}} most computer hobbyists who were using his company's Altair <b>BASIC</b> <b>software</b> without having paid for it. He asserted that such widespread unauthorized copying in effect discourages developers from investing {{time and money}} in creating high-quality software. He cited the unfairness of gaining the benefits of software authors' time, effort, and capital without paying them.|$|E

The Intel 8253 Mode 3 Square Wave generator was used for music, in the Kit computer MZ-40K (...) by SHARP Corporation, made in Japan at May 1978. Another Micro computer [...] used a 5Bit D/A converter music automated reference signal. Also important was {{the development of a}} method to generate using <b>BASIC</b> <b>software.</b> The machine was assembled by Hitachi, Ltd. and made in Japan in September 1978.|$|E

Commodore {{did not include a}} reset button on any of their computers until the CBM-II line, but there were third-party cartridges with a reset button on them. It is possible to trigger a soft reset by jumping to the CPU reset vector at $FCE2. A few programs use this as an [...] "exit" [...] feature, although it does not clear memory.|$|E
