40|$|Introduction: Medicinal {{plants are}} {{valuable}} natural {{resources that are}} nowadays known as safe pre-materials for drug industries in the advanced countries. <b>Black</b> <b>caraway</b> {{is one of the}} most important and economical medicinal plants that can be grown naturally in some regions of Yazd province. The essence of the plant are used in treatment of diarrhea, dyspepsia, fever, flatulence, stomachache, hemorrhoids, hiccoughs, as an antihistaminic and more numerous uses in medicine industries. This plant shows several therapeutic effects on digestive and urinary tract disorders and is well known as an anti-convulsant, anthelmintic, anti-asthma and antidyspnic drug in Iranian traditional medicine. Bunium Persicum oil is capable of suppressing the initial stage of an inflammatory process. Also, this plant is used for culinary purposes and for flavoring foods and beverages. Methods: In this research, the fractionization of seed essence was done by GC method and the compounds were recognized. The DPPH test was used for estimating anti oxidant effects and the Follin-Ciocalteu method was used for estimating quantity of phenol compounds. Results: The results revealed that- γTerpinene had the highest percentage in the essence of the native <b>black</b> <b>caraway</b> of Yazd province. Also, the antioxidant test showed the high antioxidant effect of the native <b>black</b> <b>caraway</b> of Yazd province with an IC 50 of 2. 85 µg. mg- 1 and the phenolic component percentage of 117. 09 mg. g 1.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{different}} doses of <b>black</b> <b>caraway</b> (Carum carvi L.) {{oil on the}} levels of serum creatinine in alloxan induced-diabetic rats was studied. Forty white male albino rats of the Winster strain weighing between 125 and 215 g were used. Diabetes was induced in the experimental rats with alloxan (70 mg kg - 1) body weight. Five rats were randomly assigned into each group (Group I - VIII). Group I rats served as the normal control, Group II served as the caraway control, whereas, Group III rats served as the diabetic control. Groups IV to VIII were the test groups. The test group rats were administered different doses of the <b>black</b> <b>caraway</b> oil thus; 5, 10, 20, 40 and 80 mg kg - 1 body weight, respectively. The experiment lasted {{for a period of}} 10 weeks. The blood glucose and serum creatinine levels in the different groups were assayed. There was a statistically significant increase (p< 0. 0001) in the levels of blood glucose and serum creatinine in the diabetic control (Group III). These levels were significantly reduced by the administration of 10 mg kg - 1 wet weight of the <b>black</b> <b>caraway</b> oil group (Group V) compared to the diabetic control (Group III) and the other treatment groups (Groups IV, VI-VIII).

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{different}} doses of <b>Black</b> <b>caraway</b> {{oil on the}} Liver enzymes (i. e., alkaline phosphatase, aspartate amino transferase and alanine amino transferase) of alloxan-induced diabetic rats was studied. Forty white male albino rats of the winster strain weighing between 125 - 215 g were used. They were divided into eight groups. Diabetes was induced in the experimental rats with alloxan (70 mg kg - 1 body weight). Group 1 rats served as the normal control, group II served as the caraway control whereas group III served as the diabetic control. Groups IV to VIII were the test groups. They were administered various doses of caraway oil ranging from 5, 10, 20, 40 and 80 mg kg - 1 body weight respectively. The experiment lasted {{for a period of}} 10 weeks. The following liver enzymes were assayed: Aspartate Amino Transferase (ASAT), Alanine Amino Transferase (ALAT) and alkaline phosphatase. Histopathology was also done for the liver.

Finally, the best nanoemulsion based on size, homogeneity, and stability of the particles, was encapsulated using two different encapsulating material compositions, i. e. maltodextrin (100 %) and a combination of maltodextrin and soy protein isolate at a ratio of 80 : 20 (w/w). The results showed that the three-hour reflux method produced better <b>black</b> <b>cumin</b> extract properties than that of maceration. Use of 3 % surfactant gave a stable nanoemulsion with average droplet size of 10. 93 nm. Reconstitution of the encapsulated nanoemulsion resulted in products with more spherical globules, indicating an efficient encapsulation process. The combination of of maltodextrin and soy protein isolate provided a better preservation of phenolic content and antioxidant capacity as compared to the use of maltodextrin alone...|$|R
40|$|Evaluation of {{medicinal}} plants to drought and salt stress tolerance, {{in an attempt}} to plant them under drought and saline regions, is of utmost importance. Environmental stresses, especially drought and salt, reduce the global crop yields more than other factors. Selection of drought tolerant crops at germination stage, usually is, the fast and low cost method. In order to study the effect of osmotic stress on germination indices of <b>black</b> <b>cumin</b> and milk thistle, an experiment carried out in a completely randomized design with four replications at the Seed Technology Laboratoary of Yasouj University in 2008. Treatments were 0 (as control), - 2. 4, - 4. 8, - 7. 2 and - 9. 4 bar osmotic potentials created by using PEG 6000. Results showed that, decreasing of osmotic potential reduced speed of germination and its percentage, root and shoot lengths and dry matter in these two plants. <b>Black</b> <b>cumin</b> showed higher tolerance, to - 4. 8 bar osmotic potential, as compared to milk thistle. However, milk thistle showed higher tolerance to drought stress, up to this osmotic potential (- 4. 8 bar), compared to <b>black</b> <b>cumin.</b> Milk thistle had lower germination speed and percentage at higher drought stress as compared to <b>black</b> <b>cumin.</b> Generally, milk thistle showed better growth and survival than <b>black</b> <b>cumin</b> due to its higher root and shoot length and dry matter...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{explore the}} {{hypoglycaemic}} and hypocholesterolemic potential of conventional and supercritical extracts of <b>black</b> <b>cumin.</b> Methods: Purposely, rat modelling {{was carried out}} for 2 months by designing three studies i. e. study I (normal rats), study II (hyperglycaemic rats) and study III (hypercholesterolemic rats). Each study was further divided into three groups based on diet i. e. control, functional diet (contained extract of <b>black</b> <b>cumin</b> prepared by using conventional solvent) and nutraceutical diet (contained extract of <b>black</b> <b>cumin</b> prepared by supercritical fluid extraction system). Results: During whole trial, an abating trend was observed {{in the level of}} serum cholesterol with maximum reduction (12. 8 %) in nutraceutical group of study III. Low density lipoprotein and triglyceride level was also lowered maximum in study III as 17. 1 % and 11. 6 %, respectively. Whereas, highest decline in glucose level was in nutraceutical group of study II as 11. 2 %. Conclusions: Inclusion of <b>black</b> <b>cumin</b> extracts in diet significantly lowers the occurrence of hyperglycaemia and hypercholesterolaemia. Furthermore, hypoglycaemic and hypocholesterolemic potential of nutraceutical diet is more prominent as compared to functional diet...|$|R
40|$|Abstract It is {{important}} that the methods and materials used for to lengthen the shelf-life of food are simple, inexpensive and safe. For these reasons, herbal additives like cumin oil (Nigella sativa L.) have been preferred recently. Thus, the present study focuses on the influence of <b>black</b> <b>cumin</b> oil on chemical, microbiological and sensory quality of fish (Barbus grypus) fillets during storage at 2 ± 1 °C. Acceptability scores for sensory quality of all described treatment groups decreased with storage time. Defined limits for mesophilic bacteria and Total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N) were reached after 21 st days for the control group, after 24 th days for with 0. 2 % <b>black</b> <b>cumin</b> oil treated group and after 28 th days for with 0. 4 % and 0. 6 % <b>black</b> <b>cumin</b> oil treated groups. No difference was found among groups during storage in terms of defined thiobarbituric acid (TBA) values. Consequently, it was found that <b>black</b> <b>cumin</b> oil treated groups had longer shelf-life and higher sensory quality than the untreated control group...|$|R

40|$|Mariem Yusuksawad 1, Narongsak Chaiyabutr 21 Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, 2 Department of Physiology, Faculty of Veterinary Science, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, ThailandBackground: <b>Black</b> <b>cumin</b> (Nigella sativa) is {{an ancient}} herbal {{medicine}} recommended by the World Health Organization. The antioxidant and antihyperglycemic effects of <b>black</b> <b>cumin</b> are well established. Amelioration of renal dysfunction in nephrotoxic rats with <b>black</b> <b>cumin</b> treatment has also been noted. However, the effect of <b>black</b> <b>cumin</b> treatment on renal dysfunction in diabetes mellitus has not been clarified. In this study, the effect of <b>black</b> <b>cumin</b> oil (BC) on changes in renal dysfunction and renal hemodynamics in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats was evaluated. Methods: The experiments were performed in male Sprague Dawley rats, divided into four groups (seven in each group) : (1) normal rats given tap water (CON); (2) normal rats administered with BC (CON-BC); (3) diabetic rats given tap water only (STZ); and (4) diabetic rats administered with BC (STZ-BC). Diabetes mellitus was induced in the rats by an injection of streptozotocin. BC was given orally at the dose of 1000 mg/kg body weight to the rat in either CON-BC or STZ-BC every day for 8 weeks. Renal hemodynamics and functions in each rat were studied. Results: Renal hemodynamic changes in STZ-BC rats appeared to increase in terms of glomerular filtration rate, effective renal plasma flow, and effective renal blood flow, while renal vascular resistance and filtration fraction were decreased in comparison with diabetic rats given tap water only (STZ). An improvement of renal tubular dysfunction in STZ-BC rats was indicated by the decreases in fractional excretion of water and Mg++. Conclusion: An administration of BC can restore changes in renal hemodynamics and renal dysfunction in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.

40|$|Background: Functional and {{nutraceutical}} {{foods are}} gaining immense popularity among the masses. Plants and their bioactive molecules are of prime importance. Although various plants from different geographical {{areas have been}} tested in the past, many horizons {{still need to be}} addressed. <b>Black</b> <b>cumin</b> (Nigella sativa L.) is one such example that is quite popular in South Asia and the Middle East. Context and purpose: The present research study was designed to expedite the role of <b>black</b> <b>cumin</b> seed in reducing the risk of hypercholesterolemia. For the purpose, thirty Sprague dawley rats were procured from the National Institute of Health (NIH) in Islamabad, Pakistan, and further split up into three groups, (10 rats each). Experimental diets were prepared using powdered <b>black</b> <b>cumin</b> (PBC) at 1 % and 2 %, and compared with the placebo. Results: The results revealed that PBC was effective in reducing the serum cholesterol, triglycerides, and low-density lipoproteins (LDL). Additionally, the experimental diets resulted in a non-significant increase in high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Overall, powdered <b>black</b> <b>cumin</b> at 1 % and 2 % reduced cholesterol level by 6. 73, and 4. 48 %, LDL by 24. 79, and 24. 32 % respectively. However, the supplementation of PBC at 2 % resulted in marked variations as increasing tendency, which was recorded for cholesterol and triglycerides contents after 28 days of study. Conclusion: Present research investigation brightened the prospects of using powdered <b>black</b> <b>cumin</b> seed in diet based therapies to improve the lipid profile. Further studies are still required to assess the phytochemistry of the plants and indeed the functional ingredients responsible for such health benefits.
