50|$|The Santoku has a straighter edge than a chef's knife, with a blunted sheepsfoot-tip {{blade and}} a thinner spine, {{particularly}} near the point. From 12 cm to 18 cm (5 to 7 inches) long, a true Japanese Santoku is well-balanced, normally flat-ground, and generally lighter and thinner than its Western counterparts, often using superior blade steels {{to provide a}} blade with exceptional hardness and an acute cutting angle. This construction allows the knife to more easily slice thin-boned and <b>boneless</b> <b>meats,</b> fish, and vegetables. Many subsequent Western and Asian copies of the Japanese Santoku do not always incorporate these features, resulting in reduced cutting ability. Some Western Santoku-pattern knives are even fitted with kullen/kuhlen, scallops {{on the sides of}} the blade above the edge, in an attempt to reduce the sticking of foods and reduce cutting friction.

Shear values also significantly (P<. 05) decreased {{as the product}} temper-ature increased, indicating tenderness development. Microwave reheating/cooking of hams removed from the smokehouse at 48. 9, 60. 0, and 71. 1 C gave final yields of approximately 85 %, irrespective of previous smokehouse cooking temperature. Taste panelists scored the ham at 7. 2 on a nine-point preference scale for microwave reheated, cooked hams; these scores were not affected by previous smokehouse temperature. Heme pigment conversion to the nitric oxide heme pigment form showed a dependence on the internal temperature of the product during heating, typical of cured meat products.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the following {{study was to determine}} if a post-chill whole carcass Cecure ® (Safe Foods Corporation, N. Little Rock, AR) treatment (0. 3 % @ 0. 5 gallon/carcass) would extend the shelf-life of various further processed broiler products which were produced from Cecure ® -treated whole carcasses. Cecure ® is an FDA and USDA/FSIS approved, patented formulation containing the active ingredient cetylpyridinium chloride. Cecure ® is approved by FDA and USDA/FSIS for application to pre-immersion chilled, post-immersion chilled and air-chilled whole carcasses and to skin-on carcass parts. For this study, a commercially available, fully automated, post-chill Cecure ® rinse cabinet was installed and operated in a USDA-inspected broiler processing facility several months prior to initiation of the study. On the day the shelf-life study was to be conducted, a single flock of birds was utilized. Control samples were collected during a 2 -hour period prior to turning on the Cecure ® post-chill whole carcass system. Six different types of broiler products were collected for evaluation including <b>boneless</b> skinless breast <b>meat,</b> thighs, wings, split breasts, leg quarters and whole carcasses. After all control samples were collected (n= 70 per product type) the Cecure ® system was turned on and allowed to run for 2 hours after which similar product samples were collected for products produced from Cecure ® -treated whole carcasses. All broiler parts were tray-packed and whole carcasses were bagged individually. On Day 0, all samples were held at 28 o F for approximately 6 hours after which they were held at 32 o F for 3 days. For the remainder of the study, all samples were held at 34 o F. On Days 0, 5 and 10 and Days 14 through 22, each of the six product types was microbiologically evaluated using Aerobic Plate Count Petrifilm™ 3 until the products were considered spoiled (7 logs colony forming units per mL). Regardless of product type, the Cecure ® whole carcass post-chill treatment (0. 3 %) resulted in initial reductions in Aerobic Plate Count on Day 0 from 0. 5 to > 1 log. These initial Day 0 microbial reductions led to increases in product shelf-life as follows: <b>boneless</b> skinless breast <b>meat</b> and whole carcasses (1. 5 -day extension), thighs, split breasts and wings (2 -day extension) and leg quarters (1 -day extension). It {{should be noted that the}} slope and the shape of the bacterial growth curves for all Cecure ® -treated products were almost identical to those for the control products with the exception of a lower initial (Day 0) level of bacteria; hence, increasing the days to spoilage without a delayed technical effect. The results from this study demonstrate that the use of a post-chill Cecure ® whole carcass rinse treatment (0. 3 %) will significantly improve the shelf-life of whole carcasses and corresponding cut-up broiler parts including <b>boneless</b> skinless breast <b>meat,</b> thighs, wings, split breasts and leg quarters...|$|R

The range imaging system in conjunction with X-ray imaging was used to provide synergistic imaging detection of bone fragments in poultry fillets. In this research, two 5 mW diode lasers coupled with two CCD cameras were used to produce 3 D information based on structured lights and triangulation. A laser scattering phenomenon on meat tissues was studied when calculating the object thickness. To obtain the accurate 3 D information, the cameras were calibrated to correct for camera distortions. For pixel registrations of the X-ray and laser 3 D images, the range imaging system was calibrated, and noises and signal variations in the X-ray and laser 3 D images were analyzed. Furthermore, {{the relationship between the}} X-ray absorption and 3 D thickness of fillets was obtained, and a mapping function based on this relationship was applied to convert the fillet 3 D images into the pseudo-X-ray images.

Two instrumental parameters (maximum shear force and total shear energy) were used as estimates of meat tenderness. Calibration (R 2 cal) and validation (r 2 val) coefficients of determination were used for predicting instrumental measurements using the reflectance, and its first and second derivatives. The model using second derivative reflectance data yielded the best results for all samples. Regressions preformed on these samples produced R 2 cal values ranging from 0. 70 to 0. 75 and r 2 val values ranging from 0. 59 to 0. 65 for maximum shear force and total shear energy, demonstrating the potential of NIR to predict poultry breast meat tenderness.

40|$|Background. More {{and more}} poultry is {{intended}} {{for the production of}} <b>boneless</b> culinary <b>meat</b> both in Poland and other EU countries. The method in which meat is prepared causes inaccurate deboning, leaving a relatively meaningful amount of muscle tissue on the skeletal system. Loss of protein, beneficial for its nutritional value, reaches the level of a few percent of the total of the obtained meat mass. Thus, the issue of mechanically separated poultry meat (MSPM) utilization becomes significant. However, meat mechanically deboned may deteriorate the sensory quality of the final product with respect to characteristics such as taste, odour, consistency, and colour. In this context, the work is focused on an evaluation of selected quality features of the frankfurter type sausage with varied MSPM participation obtained from poultry necks and bodies. Material and methods. The research material was a frankfurter type sausage, made from class III pork – control sample K. In the other experimental samples, 25 % and 50 % of pork was substituted by MSPM obtained from necks (Sz 25 and Sz 50) and bodies (W 25 and W 50) of broilers of the COB breed. In the experimental sausages the following were measured: chemical composition and colour L*a*b* in CIE system. Then, sensory evaluation was carried out applying a 5 -point method. The obtained results were subjected to statistical analysis. Results. On the basis of the obtained results it was stated that the basic composition of the final product changed depending upon the type and amount of MSPM introduced into the raw material composition. The introduction of MSPM into the mentioned meat products composition brought about a significant decrease in the notation of characteristics such as odour, cross-section colour, and exterior colour, measured sensorically. However, the statistical analysis of the results did not show a significant impact of a partial substitution of pork meat with mechanically deboned poultry meat on the overall desirability of the model sausages. Conclusions. A partial substitution of pork meat with mechanically deboned poultry meat from broilers’ necks and bodies is possible. MSPM content of the raw material composition higher than 25 % may negatively influence some sensory quality characteristics. No significant impact of substitution of pork meat MSPM on physical colour parameters a* and b* was noticed, independently of the type of MSPM and amount of substitution in the raw material...|$|R
