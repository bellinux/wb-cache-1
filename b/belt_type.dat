50|$|Power {{transmission}} {{is a function}} of belt tension. However, also increasing with tension is stress (load) on the belt and bearings. The ideal belt is that of the lowest tension that does not slip in high loads. Belt tensions should also be adjusted to <b>belt</b> <b>type,</b> size, speed, and pulley diameters. Belt tension is determined by measuring the force to deflect the belt a given distance per inch of pulley. Timing belts need only adequate tension to keep the belt in contact with the pulley.|$|E

50|$|The main subprocesses of sensor-based sorting are {{material}} conditioning, material presentation, detection, {{data processing}} and separation. Material conditioning includes all operations which prepare the particles for being detected by the sensor. All optical sensors need clean material {{to be able}} to detect optical characteristics. Conditioning includes screening and cleaning of the feed material. The aim of the material presentation is the isolation of the particles by creating a single particle layer with the densest surface cover possible without particles touching each other and enough distance to each other allowing for a selective detection and rejection of each single particle. There are two types of sensor-based sorters: the chute type and the <b>belt</b> <b>type.</b> For both types the first step in acceleration is spreading out the particles by a vibrating feeder followed by either a fast belt or a chute. On the <b>belt</b> <b>type</b> the sensor usually detects the particles horizontally while they pass it on the belt. For the chute type the material detection is usually done vertically while the material passes the sensor in a free fall. The data processing is done in real time by a computer. The computer transfers the result of the data processing to an ultra fast ejection unit which, depending on the sorting decision, ejects a particle or lets it pass.|$|E
50|$|The weapon feeds {{from the}} left side from open-link, metal {{ammunition}} belts: either the American disintegrating M13 belt (NATO standard) or the segmented German DM1 belt, whose 50-round sections can be linked through a cartridge. In order to adapt the weapon to feed from one <b>belt</b> <b>type</b> to the other, several components of the feed mechanism need to be reconfigured since the position of the feed tray's cartridge stop and pawl angles in the top cover are different. The MAG features a pawl-type feeding mechanism that continues to move the feed link during both the rearward and forward cycles of the reciprocating bolt carrier, producing a smooth belt flow. The feeding mechanism's three pawls are actuated by a roller connected to the bolt carrier. The feed channel rail, feed link, both feed slides and the feed tray are chrome plated. The top cover body is an anodized aluminum casting. In the infantry assault role, the weapon can be fitted with a sheet metal container that houses a 50-round belt and is attached to {{the left side of the}} receiver.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: This paper {{suggests}} the experimental guidelines {{to evaluate the}} electro-mechanical safety of <b>belt</b> <b>type</b> equipment. The electro-mechanical safety was determined by using the International Electrotechnical Commission guidelines, which are widely used as important factors for assessing the electro-mechanical safety of <b>belt</b> <b>type</b> equipment. However, the local guidelines on wearable healthcare sensors are currently not well-established. Therefore, safety guidelines suited for the actual circumstances in Korea are required, and this paper attempts to try a new experimental safety test procedure of the wearable healthcare sensor. Methods: This <b>belt</b> <b>type</b> device measures the electrocardiogram (ECG) and heart rates by attaching to the chest. Examination lists were selected by analyzing the common standards ofelectro-mechanical safety (IEC 60601 - 1) and environment tests (IEC 60068 - 1, IEC 60068 - 2) of home-healthcare equipment. Results: The essential electrical safety, which was required for the RS 300 G 3 as a medical device, was evaluated, {{and most of the}} examination lists were selected by considering the circumstances of the users. The device passed all the selected examinable lists that are applicable to the Korean environment. Conclusions: This study has limitations to estimate and to conduct electro-mechanical safety experiments because our study focused on the <b>belt</b> <b>type</b> of heart-rates equipment. We are not taking into account the overall electro-mechanical home-healthcare measurements. According to industrial and technological development, there are infinite possibilities for the advancement of home-healthcare equipment, so more examination lists for safety are being added in addition to what w...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Along {{with the}} rapid {{development}} of chemical industry and the progress of science and technology, there exist safety risks for {{a large number of}} risk source pipelines. On the basis of the conventional containment measures for risk source leakage, this paper designed two types of emergency devices and corresponding rapid closure methods. One type is the pipeline leak sealing airbag inside the risk source. It is constituted by sealing institutions, diversion institutions, keep institutions and fixed institution. During the work, the sealing airbag gets inflated to realize the rapid closure inside in the piping. It is applicable to the sealing of the heat, water supply, the chemical pipeline, and even large pipe leakages. It also provides the diversion function. The second type the external leakage sealing gasbag for the risk source pipelines. It is compositioned by the <b>belt</b> <b>type</b> rubber air mattress,left and right sides of adjustable bits semi-manipulator mechanism.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare postures of male and female vehicle occupants, tested in both front seat positions, during normal driving and {{deceleration}} onset. These data are useful for the development and initialisation of computational human body models. A secondary aim was to examine the effect of reversible, motorised seat belts in these events. Kinematics were analysed for volunteers driving on rural roads, prior to autonomous braking (11 m/s 2 deceleration). Two restraint configurations were tested: a standard versus a motorized belt, activated 200 ms before braking initiation. Kinematic metric comparison via ANCOVA was performed to understand postural differences across gender, role (driver/passenger), and <b>belt</b> <b>type</b> (standard/motorised). Data was analysed prior to and at vehicle deceleration, termed typical riding and initial braking, respectively. While males and females displayed similar postures during typical riding, differences existed between drivers and passengers, especially with respect to neck posture. Drivers displayed more protracted neck postures, with significantly smaller (by 22 ‐ 27 mm, depending on gender) head‐to‐sternum horizontal distances, than passengers. Motorised belts significantly changed posture during initial braking, notably of the chest (which was shifted posteriorly by approximately 13 mm, depending on gender and role), while standard belts did not.

A total of 7 <b>types</b> of base <b>belts</b> and 26 <b>types</b> of altitudinal <b>belts</b> are identified in the study region. The main altitudinal belt lines, such as forest line, the upper limit of dark coniferous forest and snow line, have similar latitudinal and longitudinal spatial patterns, namely, arched quadratic curve model with latitudes and concave quadratic curve model along longitudinal direction. These patterns can be together called as "Hyperbolic-paraboloid model", revealing the complexity and speciality {{of the environment and}} ecology in the study region. This result further validates the hypnosis of a common quadratic model for spatial pattern of mountain altitudinal belts proposed by the authors. The spatial pattern of altitudinal belts is closely related with moisture-related exposure effect in the Hengduan Mountains. Different combinations (spectra) of altitudinal belts and different base <b>belt</b> <b>types</b> appear in windward and leeward flanks and even in the same flanks of different ranges. This is closely related with the parallel mountain ranges of the Hengduan Mountains, which, at nearly right angle with the moving direction of prevailing moisture-laden air masses from west and east, hold up the warm and humid monsoon wind from moving into the core region and result in different moisture conditions in windward and leeward flanks. However, how to quantitatively describe the moisture-related exposure effect needs further study.
