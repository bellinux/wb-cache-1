5|$|Palencia-Roth {{notes that}} critics {{have been struck}} by the humorless elegiac style of The General in His Labyrinth; its dark mood and somber message {{is similar to that}} of The Autumn of the Patriarch. Love is a theme common to <b>both</b> <b>Love</b> in the Time of Cholera and The General in His Labyrinth, but the latter is {{considered}} a tragedy. These two novels have been used to demonstrate the range of García Márquez's work.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} a {{monologue}} given by fashion model Agyness Deyn. Scenes of Rihanna with her romantic interest (Dudley O'Shaughnessy) in <b>both</b> <b>love</b> and hate scenarios intersperse, as they experience mounting difficulties in their relationship. After enduring the overwhelming effects of recreational drugs and physical violence, she finds her boyfriend unconscious {{on the floor of}} his apartment, and leaves him, having had enough of the relationship.

5|$|On April 17, James {{defeated}} Madison Rayne in a {{steel cage}} match, which lasted {{less than a}} minute, to win the TNA Knockouts Championship for the first time. With the win, James {{became the first woman}} in history to have held the WWE Women's Championship, the WWE Divas Championship, and the TNA Knockouts Championship. On the May 5 episode of Impact!, James made her first successful title defense against Ms. Tessmacher. On May 15 at Sacrifice, James successfully defended her title against Madison Rayne and in the process helped Tara get a release from her alliance with Rayne. The following month at Slammiversary IX, James successfully defended her title against Angelina Love, however after the match <b>both</b> <b>Love</b> and Winter attacked her. On June 18, James made her debut for TNA's Mexican partner Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide (AAA) at Triplemanía XIX, where she teamed with Angelina Love, Sexy Star and Velvet Sky to defeat Cynthia Moreno, Faby Apache, Lolita and Mari Apache in an eight-woman tag team match. James returned to AAA on July 9, teaming with Sexy Star to defeat the Apaches in a tag team match, after which she challenged Mari to a match for her AAA Reina de Reinas Championship. On July 31 at Verano de Escándalo, James competed in an eight–way match for the Reina de Reinas Championship, becoming the last person eliminated by the new champion, Pimpinela Escarlata.

25|$|The Chinese {{association}} of Venus to Metal appears at first {{fundamentally different from}} Western notions of love and romance. In Babylonian mythology, her equivalent was Ishtar, goddess of <b>both</b> <b>love</b> and war. The Chinese metal representative is unyielding and forceful, set in their ways and taciturn; yet Venus' Western element is air, which is logical and sanguine. Metal is also sophisticated, and enjoys the good things in life. In Western astrology, Venus rules both Libra, which is sophisticated, logical, and romantic, and Taurus, which is reserved, sensual, and unyielding. Some Western astrologers believe that metal is better associated with the qualities of the planet Saturn, arguing that metal equates to air in the western system, and that Saturn is linked to air in Vedic astrology.|$|E
25|$|As {{the best}} and {{original}} state, {{there was a time}} when the pure elements and the two powers co-existed in a condition of rest and inertness in the form of a sphere. The elements existed together in their purity, without mixture and separation, and the uniting power of Love predominated in the sphere: the separating power of Strife guarded the extreme edges of the sphere. Since that time, strife gained more sway and the bond which kept the pure elementary substances together in the sphere was dissolved. The elements became the world of phenomena we see today, full of contrasts and oppositions, operated on by <b>both</b> <b>Love</b> and Strife. The sphere being the embodiment of pure existence is the embodiment or representative of God. Empedocles assumed a cyclical universe whereby the elements return and prepare the formation of the sphere for the next period of the universe.|$|E
500|$|The last recitative, [...] "" [...] (Lord, let Your {{faithful}} {{love for}} me), is secco, but closes as an arioso {{on the words}} [...] "" [...] (and considers your love constantly).

500|$|Critics universally acknowledged, {{but gave}} mixed {{opinions}} on, the game's {{high level of}} difficulty. This sentiment was epitomized by Sliva's comment that [...] "Don't Starve will never, ever hold your hand, and I <b>both</b> <b>love</b> it and hate it for that." [...] For example, he felt some of his deaths were unfairly caused by the game's camera system obscuring needed objects. Meunier stated that [...] "survival doesn't come easy, but there's an undeniable thrill to the challenge," [...] but also placed the high difficulty in his list of the game's cons. Leon Hurley of Official PlayStation Magazine claimed that [...] "learning is half the fun and even the smallest victory {{makes you feel like}} you’re winning with a capital FU." [...] Reviewers also felt that players' levels of satisfaction would depend heavily on their levels of commitment to survival.|$|E
500|$|Edgar Allan Poe {{was very}} close to his brother, as he wrote: [...] "there can be no tie more strong than that of brother for brother — {{it is not so much}} that they love one another as that they <b>both</b> <b>love</b> the same parent." [...] Edgar {{occasionally}} used the alias [...] "Henri Le Rennet", a French version of his older brother's name. He was also inspired by his brother Henry's travels, often incorporating some of his stories from overseas into tellings of his own life story. The character of August Barnard in Edgar's novel The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket (1838) seems to be inspired by Henry, especially in his travels across the sea and his drinking. Poe may have also transformed his brother's name into the title character in his poem [...] "Lenore".|$|E
500|$|Ramprasad's {{literary}} works include [...] Vidyasundar (or Kalikaman-gala) (ca. sixth or seventh {{decade of the}} 18th century), Kali-kirtana, the fragmentary Krishna-kirtana, and Shaktigiti. Kali-kirtana {{is a collection of}} lyric and narrative poetry describing the early life of Uma. Krishna-kirtana is an incomplete book of poems and songs to Krishna—the complete collection is yet to be discovered. Vidyasundara Kavya is written in a narrative style that was already popular in Bengali literature, telling the traditional love story of Vidya and Sundara—children of kings who are aided by Kali in meeting, falling in love, and marrying. Shaktigiti is Ramprasad's well known and respected work, in which he expresses his deepest feelings and love for Kali. In Shaktigiti, he shares the most intimate relationship with Kali—a child who can <b>both</b> <b>love</b> and quarrel with his mother over the inequities of human birth.|$|E

Later, Liz reveals that she has a Life Alert Emergency Response necklace; this necklace helps the elderly contact emergency services in case of an accident. Carol wonders why Geico—an auto insurance company—has multiple mascots, a reference to Geico's advertising campaigns. Jack plans to seduce the gay interior designer that Avery hired and hopes to get the designer to agree with him to leave the apartment the way it is, explaining to Liz [...] "Do you know what a prize I am in the gay community? There's a term for it. I'm a bear. And I'm a daddy. I'm a daddy bear."

Neha, upset at being passed over for promotion, goes home and is consoled by Rani; in turn, she helps Rani accept her son's sexuality. Kunal and Sam help Neha with a project assigned by Abhi, who is impressed with her work. They later take Neha on separate dates, both telling her that they love her. Neha, convinced that they are gay, sees the dates as friendly outings. When Abhi and Neha begin dating, Sam and Kunal sabotage the budding relationship by giving Abhi inappropriate advice; this irritates Neha, and she and Abhi quarrel. When Neha discovers Kunal and Sam's plan, she misinterprets it as jealousy of Abhi. Sam and Kunal redirect their efforts into frightening Veer, Abhi's five-year-old son, about his future with Neha. During a basketball game, Neha discovers that Abhi plans to propose to her and asks Kunal and Sameer's advice. They ask her to turn him down, admitting that their homosexuality is a ruse and they <b>both</b> <b>love</b> her. Veer tells Abhi about his fears, and during the game Abhi breaks up with Neha. She tearfully evicts Kunal and Sameer from her apartment, and resigns from Verve.|$|E
500|$|Several James Turner Street {{residents}} have claimed they were tricked into {{appearing in the}} series by Love Productions, who they say told them it would be about community spirit. One resident told the Birmingham Mail, [...] "They {{told me it was}} about living as a community and how we all got along. But the actual programme doesn't show any of that. If they had said it was about benefits and making the street look bad I would not have taken part. They tricked us." [...] Responding to allegations the residents were duped, Nick Mirsky said that Love Productions had spent much time consulting the residents before filming began, and that process continued afterwards: [...] "Key contributors have been offered viewings of the programmes during the editing period and were given the opportunity to comment on them. <b>Both</b> <b>Love</b> and Channel 4 listened to any concerns raised, and in some cases made changes to the programme to accommodate them." [...] Dierdre Kelly, however, subsequently told ITV's This Morning that she believed the programme had provided a one-sided view of her community, and that the residents [...] "went into the show naively". Gareth Price of The Guardian suggested the show's producers [...] "adeptly edited their film in order to provoke a response from its intended audience".|$|E
