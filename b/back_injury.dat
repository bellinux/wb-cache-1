40|$|<b>Back</b> <b>injuries</b> {{have become}} a major {{component}} in worker compensation costs within industry today. Company XYZ has felt this impact and recognize that the equipment service employees (ESEs) {{are at high risk}} of <b>back</b> <b>injuries.</b> The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify and analyze contributing factors for the occurrence of <b>back</b> <b>injuries</b> in equipment service employees (ESEs) at Company XYZ. Past records have indicated that ESEs are at high risk of <b>back</b> <b>injuries.</b> Within one year, over 300 <b>back</b> <b>injuries</b> were reported. For this study, the anatomy of the back and intervention approaches were researched. Some of these approaches that can be implemented into the workplace are the use of back belts, a physical fitness program, engineering controls and different types of lifting techniques. To help identify and analyze the contributing factors, several data sources such as the loss tab analysis, worker compensation costs, and accident reports were evaluated as well as observing the daily tasks of the ESEs and customer service agents (CSAs). The results of theiii evaluation from the loss tab analysis and accident reports were that the activity of lifting caused the majority of <b>back</b> <b>injuries.</b> For one year, worker compensation costs reported over $ 200, 000 for <b>back</b> <b>injuries</b> for the ESEs. The observations of the ESEs and CSAs were evaluated to fin...|$|R
