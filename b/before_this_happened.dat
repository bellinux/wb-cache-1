5|$|The loss {{of plant}} life will also {{result in the}} {{eventual}} loss of oxygen as well as ozone due to the respiration of animals, chemical reactions in the atmosphere, and volcanic eruptions, meaning less attenuation of DNA-damaging ultraviolet radiation, {{as well as the}} death of animals; the first animals to disappear would be large mammals, followed by small mammals, birds, amphibians and large fish, reptiles and small fish, and finally invertebrates. <b>Before</b> <b>this</b> <b>happened</b> it's expected that life would concentrate at refugia of lower temperature such as high elevations where less land surface area is available, thus restricting population sizes. Smaller animals would survive better than larger ones because of lesser oxygen requirements, while birds would fare better than mammals thanks to their ability to travel large distances looking for colder temperatures.|$|E

A line over the Kaimai Range was suggested in 1911 but was quickly dismissed as being impractical.

After his parachute deployed, he used his survival radio to issue a mayday call {{and was able to}} contact the KC-135 that had seen him shot down. Zelko used his survival radio while still descending although this was contrary to his training.

25|$|Compulsory figures {{formerly}} {{accounted for}} up to 60% of the score in singles figure skating, which meant that skaters who could build up a big lead in figures could win competitions {{even if they were}} mediocre free skaters. As television coverage of skating events became more important, so did free skating. Beginning in 1968, the ISU began to progressively reduce the weight of figures and introduced the short program in 1973. With these changes, the emphasis in competitive figure skating shifted to increasing athleticism. By the 1980s, some skaters began practicing quadruple jumps. Jozef Sabovcik of Czechoslovakia landed a quad toe loop at the 1986 European Championships which was recognized at the event but then ruled invalid three weeks later due to a touchdown with his free foot. At the 1988 World Championships, Kurt Browning of Canada landed the first quad toe loop which has remained ratified. Although it was expected that quads would soon become an important part of men's skating, it was a number of years <b>before</b> <b>this</b> <b>happened.</b> Japan's Midori Ito landed the first triple axel by a woman. Worth only 20% by 1989, figures were eliminated entirely from international competition in 1990.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the age of}} 23, Wain {{married his}} sisters' governess, Emily Richardson, who was ten years his senior (which was {{considered}} quite scandalous at the time), and moved with her to Hampstead in north London. Emily soon began to suffer from breast cancer, and died three years into their marriage. Prior to Emily's death, Wain discovered the subject that would define his career. During her illness, Emily was comforted by their pet cat Peter, a stray black and white kitten they had rescued after hearing him mewing in the rain one night. Emily's spirits were greatly lifted by Peter, and Louis began to draw extensive sketches of him, which Emily strongly encouraged him to have published. She died <b>before</b> <b>this</b> <b>happened,</b> but he continued to make cat sketches. He later wrote of Peter, [...] "To him, properly, belongs the foundation of my career, the developments of my initial efforts, and the establishing of my work."

He was forced to give them this demonstration of his kindness and affection to them, to live according {{to the laws of}} their countries.
