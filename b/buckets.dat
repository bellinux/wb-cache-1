5|$|The use {{of water}} to {{extinguish}} the fire was also frustrated. In principle, water was available from a system of elm pipes which supplied 30,000 houses via a high water tower at Cornhill, filled from the river at high tide, and also via a reservoir of Hertfordshire spring water in Islington. It was often possible to open a pipe near a burning building and connect it to a hose to play on a fire or fill <b>buckets.</b> Further, Pudding Lane {{was close to the}} river. Theoretically, all the lanes from the river up to the bakery and adjoining buildings should have been manned with double rows of firefighters passing full <b>buckets</b> up to the fire and empty <b>buckets</b> back down to the river.|$|E
5|$|Beside the weapons, each zduhać {{carried a}} milk bucket and a peck measure; an {{alternative}} {{for the latter}} could be a shovel or broom from a threshing floor. If a band of zduhaći succeeded to seize the peck measures from the enemy band, they would thereby transfer the crop yield from the area of their enemies to their own area. Seizing the milk <b>buckets</b> meant that the milk yield would be transferred. According to the clan of Kuči, zduhaći used their peck measures, milk <b>buckets,</b> and other containers to grab off the overall yield of the enemy territory.|$|E
5|$|The Algonquians {{recognized}} maple sap as {{a source}} of energy and nutrition. At the beginning of the spring thaw, they used stone tools to make V-shaped incisions in tree trunks; they then inserted reeds or concave pieces of bark to run the sap into <b>buckets,</b> which were often made from birch bark. The maple sap was concentrated either by dropping hot cooking stones into the <b>buckets</b> or by leaving them exposed to the cold temperatures overnight and disposing of the layer of ice that formed on top. While there was widespread agriculture in Mesoamerica and the Southeast and Southwest regions of the United States, the production of maple syrup is one of only a few agricultural processes in the Northeast that is not a European colonial import.|$|E

50|$|The leaky <b>bucket</b> as a meter {{is exactly}} {{equivalent}} to (a mirror image of) the token <b>bucket</b> algorithm, i.e. {{the process of}} adding water to the leaky <b>bucket</b> exactly mirrors that of removing tokens from the token <b>bucket</b> when a conforming packet arrives, the process of leaking {{of water from the}} leaky <b>bucket</b> exactly mirrors that of regularly adding tokens to the token <b>bucket,</b> and the test that the leaky <b>bucket</b> will not overflow is a mirror of the test that the token <b>bucket</b> contains enough tokens and will not 'underflow'.

5|$|<b>Buckets</b> {{began to}} be {{replaced}} with plastic bags, which allowed people to see at a distance how much sap had been collected. Syrup producers also began using tractors to haul vats of sap from the trees being tapped (the sugarbush) to the evaporator. Some producers adopted motor-powered tappers and metal tubing systems to convey sap from the tree to a central collection container, but these techniques were not widely used. Heating methods also diversified: modern producers use wood, oil, natural gas, propane, or steam to evaporate sap. Modern filtration methods were perfected to prevent contamination of the syrup.|$|E

5|$|His {{capital is}} {{believed}} to be somewhere in modern-day Haryana. Prithu used his Kshatriya power to make the earth yield its riches. Hence the earth is called Prithvi, daughter of Prithu. Prithu, by mere fiat of will, created millions of men, elephants, chariots and horses. During his reign, there was no decreptitude, no calamity, no famine, no disease, no agriculture and no mining. Prithu enjoyed popularity amongst his subjects, hence all kings are called Rajas. Cows yielded <b>buckets</b> of rich milk when they were touched. Trees and lotuses always had honey in them. People were healthy and happy and had no fear of thieves or wild animals. Nobody died of accidents. Kusha grass was golden in colour. Fruits were always sweet and ripe and nobody went hungry.

5|$|Most of {{the early}} {{industrial}} development in Minneapolis was tied to St. Anthony Falls and the power it provided. Between 1848 and 1887, Minneapolis {{led the nation in}} sawmilling. In 1856, the mills produced 12 million board feet (28,000 m³) of lumber. That total had risen to about 91,000,000 board feet (215,000 m³) in 1869, and 960,000,000 board feet (2,270,000 m³) in 1899. During the peak of this activity, at least 13 sawmills were operating on the falls. The sawmills also supported related industries such as mills that planed and smoothed the lumber; factories that built sashes, doors, and windows; and manufacturers of shingles and wooden <b>buckets.</b>|$|E

40|$|<b>Bucket</b> {{elevators}} outwardly {{appear to}} be simple devices. However having a <b>bucket</b> bolted to a flexible belt creates difficulties at the interface of the belt, <b>bucket</b> and head pulley. At the point where a <b>bucket's</b> connection line becomes tangent to the pulley, {{the tip of the}} <b>bucket</b> must undergo a very rapid acceleration phase; theoretically infinite. In reality, as the point of tangency is reached, the tip of the <b>bucket</b> lags behind its theoretical position before accelerating and overshooting its nominally correct position. The motion of an empty <b>bucket</b> is a decaying damped oscillation. When the <b>bucket</b> is transporting bulk material then more complex motion occurs. This paper presents preliminary results of an investigation utilising Discrete Element modelling tools to better understand the impact of the transition point on the discharge pattern from the <b>bucket.</b> We anticipate that this will lead {{to a better understanding of}} structural fatigue of the belt carcass and provide a better understanding of the interacting mechanisms at work in <b>bucket</b> elevator systems...|$|R

5|$|This {{doctrine}} {{was useful}} in the Islamic world outside the Middle East where the Muslims encountered environments and challenges they had been unfamiliar with in Arabia. One example of isthisan is cited as follows: If a well is contaminated {{it may not be}} used for ritual purification. Istihsan suggests that withdrawing a certain number of <b>buckets</b> of water from the well will remove the impurities. Analogical reason, however, dictates that despite removing some of the water, a small concentration of contaminants will always remain in the well (or the well walls) rendering the well impure. The application of analogy means the public may not use the well, and therefore causes hardship. Thus the principle of justistic preference is applied, and the public may use the well for ritual purification.|$|E
50|$|The leaky <b>bucket</b> as a queue for {{variable}} packet lengths {{can also}} be described as equivalent to a special case of the leaky <b>bucket</b> as a meter.

Hence, as the leaky <b>bucket</b> as a meter and token <b>bucket</b> are equivalent, the leaky <b>bucket</b> as a queue for variable packet lengths is also a special case of a traffic shaping function using a leaky <b>bucket</b> (or token <b>bucket)</b> as a meter.|$|R
