Previous research reported that channel scanning phase {{accounts for more than}} 90 % of the overall link-layer handoff latency, ranging from 350 to 500 msec.

40|$|Over {{the past}} two hundred years, {{automotive}} technology has evolved from mechanised horse carriage to high-tech systems which pack more computing power than the entire space program that put Neil Armstrong on the moon. Hand-in-hand with this evolution came a proliferation of ownership and use of cars. This enormous success causes one of modern society’s largest problems: where many vehicles accumulate, traffic congestion occurs. To a large degree, the cause of traffic congestion lies in the poor ability of the human driver to control the (longitudinal) motion of the vehicle under congested traffic circumstances. This leads to so-called string instabilities or shock waves, traveling against the flow of traffic. The traffic flow performance can be improved if the control of acceleration and deceleration is automated. Presently available solutions use radar or lidar to detect and measure {{the distance to the}} vehicle in front, and a cruise controller automatically reacts by adjusting the vehicle speed. However, the performance of these systems is not sufficient to prevent shock waves, predominantly due to the delay introduced by the sensors. The Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) is a system which circumvents this by using wireless communication to exchange information about vehicle dynamics using the periodic transmission of so-called beacon messages. The technology proposed for this wireless communication is IEEE 802. 11 p, {{a modified version of the}} IEEE 802. 11 a designed for Wireless LAN applications. However, the wireless medium succumbs to a congested state in a similar fashion as the traffic on the road in response to an increase of the traffic density. This dissertation focusses on the beaconing communication, used to generate a cooperative awareness in each vehicle. Given the real-time nature of the CACC system, it is important that the information in the cooperative awareness is accurate and fresh, even under an increasing number of communicating nodes in near vicinity. To this end, beaconing is evaluated through analytical modelling, discrete-event simulation and proof-of-concept implementations. The purpose is to determine the scalability limits of the IEEE 802. 11 p Medium Access Control mechanism when used for beaconing, and find and address bottlenecks. In this disseration, detailed analytical models of the Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) and the Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) are proposed, validated, and compared. Various mechanisms which impact the scalability of a beaconing system are described and evaluated using both these analytical and simulation models. In particular, an extensive comparison between the DCF and EDCA access mechanism variants of IEEE 802. 11 is performed based on their performance in the face of increasing traffic density. The conclusion is that, although IEEE 802. 11 p defines the EDCA to be used, the DCF is a more favourable access mechanism for the broadcast transmission of beacon messages. Under both access methods, the use of the EIFS is found to be redundant because the <b>beacon</b> <b>channel</b> is broadcast-only. Furthermore, the periodic channel switching defined by IEEE 1609. 4, which defines a way to use single-radio IEEE 802. 11 p on multiple channels in a time-division fashion, has a detrimental effect on beaconing performance. In addition, the way beacon messages are buffered and scheduled for transmission is evaluated. We conclude that it is beneficial to use a dropping policy which drops the oldest information in the queue, as opposed to the most recent arrival as is often implemented. This method is coined the Oldest Packet Drop (OPD) mechanism and is described and evaluated in detail. The outlook of a CACC application operating on beacons transmitted using IEEE 802. 11 p is good. However, care has to be taken that the system does not become congested. This dissertation provides a set of tools to estimate when the channel becomes congested, and to evaluate the impact of various design choices on communication performance...|$|R
30|$|According to {{the work}} in [10], the {{locating}} systems can be preliminarily grouped into two major categories: receptive locating systems and transmissive locating systems. In the receptive locating systems, the position information is distributed ubiquitously, and the mobile device can derive its own location from this information [the global positioning system (GPS) is the most representative example]. The mobile device can independently locate the derived position in a map, so a local service (without revealing its position to a third party) can be easily provided {{on top of this}} locating information, or some value-added services can be obtained by sharing this locating information with others. Conversely, in the transmissive locating systems, the position is derived by a fixed station which either sees the mobile device or receives a beacon from it. The station can transmit the derived locating result back to the device or use it to generate other value-added services. Sub-cell global system for mobile communications or GSM positioning is a prime example employs this approach, which leverages the mobile communication <b>channel</b> <b>beacon.</b> Also hybrid techniques combining these principles are possible, and this paper will actually underline this possibility.|$|R

The condition worsens under high vehicular density where it impacts reliability and upper bound latency of safety messages.

40|$|In a {{vehicular}} ad hoc network (VANET), {{the periodic}} exchange of single-hop status information broadcasts (<b>beacon</b> frames) produces <b>channel</b> loading, which causes channel congestion and induces information conflict problems. To guarantee fairness in beacon transmissions from each node and maximum network connectivity, adjustment of the beacon transmission power {{is an effective}} method for reducing and preventing channel congestion. In this study, the primary factors that influence wireless channel loading are selected to construct the KF-BCLF, which is a channel load forecasting algorithm based on a recursive Kalman filter and employs multiple regression equation. By pre-adjusting the transmission power based on the forecasted channel load, the channel load was kept within a predefined range; therefore, channel congestion was prevented. Based on this method, the CLF-BTPC, which is a transmission power control algorithm, is proposed. To verify KF-BCLF algorithm, a traffic survey method that involved the collection of floating car data along a major traffic road in Changchun City is employed. By comparing this forecast with the measured channel loads, the proposed KF-BCLF algorithm was proven to be effective. In addition, the CLF-BTPC algorithm is verified by simulating a section of eight-lane highway and a signal-controlled urban intersection. The results of the two verification process indicate that this distributed CLF-BTPC algorithm can effectively control channel load, prevent channel congestion, and enhance the stability and robustness of wireless beacon transmission in a vehicular network...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{address the issue of}} {{association}} fairness when Wi-Fi and LTE unlicensed (LTE-U) coexist on the same channel in the unlicensed 5 GHz band. Since beacon transmission {{is the first step in}} starting the association process in Wi-Fi, we define association fairness as how fair LTE-U is in allowing Wi-Fi to start transmitting <b>beacons</b> on a <b>channel</b> that it occupies with a very large duty cycle. According to the LTE-U specification, if a LTE-U base station determines that a channel is vacant, it can transmit for up to 20 ms and turn OFF for only 1 ms, resulting in a duty cycle of 95 %. In an area with heavy spectrum usage, there will be cases when a Wi-Fi access point wishes to share the same channel, as it does today with Wi-Fi. We study, both theoretically and experimentally, the effect that such a large LTE-U duty cycle can have on the association process, specifically Wi-Fi beacon transmission and reception. We demonstrate via an experimental set-up using National Instrument (NI) USRPs that a significant percentage of Wi-Fi beacons will either not be transmitted in a timely fashion or will not be received at the LTE-U BS thus making it difficult for the LTE-U BS to adapt its duty cycle in response to the Wi-Fi usage. Our experimental results corroborate our theoretical analysis. We compare the results with Wi-Fi/Wi-Fi coexistence and demonstrate that LTE-U/Wi-Fi coexistence is not fair when it comes to initial association since there is a much larger percentage of beacon errors in the latter case. Hence, the results in the paper indicate that in order to maintain association fairness, a LTE-U BS should not transmit at such high duty cycles, even if it deems the channel to be vacant.
