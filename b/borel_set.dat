50|$|<b>Borel</b> <b>sets</b> are {{important}} in measure theory, since any measure defined on the open sets of a space, or on the closed sets of a space, must also be defined on all <b>Borel</b> <b>sets</b> of that space.

25|$|This {{distribution}} can {{be generalized}} to more complicated sets than intervals.

2500|$|In {{mathematical}} logic, the Borel hierarchy is a stratification of the Borel algebra {{generated by}} the open subsets of a Polish space; elements of this algebra are called Borel sets.

2500|$|Every <b>Borel</b> <b>set</b> can, non-uniquely, be built up, {{starting}} from intervals with rational endpoints and applying {{the operations of}} complement and countable unions, a countable number of times.

2500|$|A {{code for}} a {{lightface}} <b>Borel</b> <b>set</b> gives complete {{information about how}} to recover the set from sets of smaller rank. [...] This contrasts with the boldface hierarchy, where no such effectivity is required. Each lightface <b>Borel</b> <b>set</b> has infinitely many distinct codes.
