50|$|A {{recent study}} found genetic {{evidence}} of multiple instances and species combinations where genetic material has passed the species boundary in <b>bears</b> (a process called introgression by geneticists). Specifically, species with evidence of past intermingling were (1) brown <b>bear</b> and American black <b>bear,</b> (2) brown <b>bear</b> and polar <b>bear,</b> (3) American black <b>bear</b> and Asian black <b>bear,</b> (4) <b>bears</b> currently distributed in Asia (sloth <b>bear,</b> sun <b>bear</b> and Asian black <b>bear).</b> Overall, this study shows that evolution in the <b>bear</b> family (Ursidae) has not been strictly , but instead showed complex evolutionary relationships.|$|R

50|$|Other {{more common}} <b>bears</b> in China include the Asiatic black <b>bear</b> and the brown <b>bear</b> which are found {{across much of}} the country. Sub-species of the brown <b>bear</b> include the Himalayan brown <b>bear</b> and the Tibetan blue <b>bear</b> in Tibet, and the Ussuri brown <b>bear</b> in Heilongjiang. The sun <b>bear</b> is found in Yunnan. <b>Bears,</b> {{especially}} black <b>bears,</b> are also raised in captivity to harvest their bile for use in traditional Chinese medicine.|$|R
5|$|According to some sources, {{the church}} could be {{identified}} with San Salvatore de Bordonia; a bordone was the staff <b>borne</b> by pilgrims coming to St. Peter's. These would have left their staffs in San Giacomo before entering Saint Peter, exactly as they did after completing the Way of St. James, and this fact would explain also the late dedication to Saint James.|$|E
5|$|Alan Rushton {{adds that}} no one in the {{household}} of the newly married Duchess of Kent, including Conroy, is known to have had haemophilia, and that her probable awareness of the scandals surrounding the behaviour of Caroline of Brunswick and Caroline Matilda of Great Britain would have deterred her from seeking an affair elsewhere. Furthermore, Princess Victoria was said to have <b>borne</b> a strong family resemblance to her father and grandfather George III.|$|E
5|$|Areoles are {{structures}} {{unique to}} cacti. Although variable, they typically appear as woolly or hairy {{areas on the}} stems from which spines emerge. Flowers are also produced from areoles. In the genus Pereskia, believed similar to the ancestor of all cacti, the areoles occur in the axils of leaves (i.e. in the angle between the leaf stalk and the stem). In leafless cacti, areoles are often <b>borne</b> on raised areas on the stem where leaf bases would have been.|$|E
50|$|For the new 2007 TV series, Care Bears: Adventures in Care-a-lot, {{five of the}} Care <b>Bears</b> {{were chosen}} {{to be the main}} {{characters}} of the show.

50|$|Brown <b>bears</b> usually {{dominate}} other <b>bear</b> {{species in}} areas where they coexist. Due to their smaller size, American black <b>bears</b> are at a competitive disadvantage to brown <b>bears</b> in open, unforested areas. Although displacement of black <b>bears</b> by brown <b>bears</b> has been documented, actual interspecific killing of black <b>bears</b> by brown <b>bears</b> has only occasionally been reported. Confrontation is mostly avoided due to the black <b>bear's</b> diurnal habits and preference for heavily forested areas, {{as opposed to the}} brown <b>bear's</b> largely nocturnal habits and preference for open spaces. Where they do not live in close proximity to grizzly <b>bears,</b> and especially where found near human habitations, American black <b>bears</b> may become to a larger extent nocturnal. Brown <b>bears</b> may also kill Asian black <b>bears,</b> though the latter species probably largely avoids conflicts with the brown <b>bear</b> due to similar habits and habitat preferences to the American black species. Brown <b>bears</b> will eat the fruit dropped from trees by the Asian black <b>bear,</b> as they themselves are too large and cumbersome to climb. Improbably, in the Himalayas, brown <b>bears</b> are reportedly intimidated by Asian black <b>bears</b> in confrontations. However, the Himalayan black <b>bears</b> are reportedly more aggressive towards humans than the region's Himalayan brown <b>bear,</b> and the latter is one of the smaller races of brown <b>bear,</b> though still somewhat larger than the black <b>bear.</b> In Siberia, the opposite is true, and black <b>bears</b> are not known to attack people, but brown <b>bears</b> are. Both black <b>bears</b> seem to be most vulnerable to predatory attacks by brown <b>bears</b> when the latter species leaves hibernation sooner in early spring and ambushes the smaller ursids in their dens.|$|R
