Moreover, President Echeverría's leftist rhetoric and actions—such as abetting illegal land seizures by peasants—eroded investor confidence and alienated the private sector. The <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> <b>disequilibrium</b> became unmanageable as capital flight intensified, forcing the government in 1976 to devalue the peso by 58 percent. The action ended Mexico's twenty-year fixed exchange rate. Mexico accepted an IMF adjustment program and received financial backing from the United States. According to a 2017 study, [...] "Key US and Mexican officials recognized that an IMF program of currency devaluation and austerity would probably fail in its stated objective of reducing Mexico's balance of payments deficit. Nevertheless, US Treasury and Federal Reserve officials, fearing that a Mexican default might lead to bank failures and subsequent global financial crisis, intervened to an unprecedented degree in the negotiations between the IMF and Mexico. The United States offered direct financial support and worked through diplomatic channels to insist that Mexico accept an IMF adjustment program, {{as a way of}} bailing out US banks. Mexican president Luis Echeverría's administration consented to IMF adjustment because officials perceived it as the least politically costly option among a range of alternatives." ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the notion of}} a jobs guarantee (JG) that is bestowed on each individual as a right of citizenry. Central to a JG economy is the notion that full employment with inflation control is both possible and desirable. Unlike a liberal economy, which has used the deficiency of demand {{over the last two decades}} to manage price stability, a JG economy controls inflation by manipulating the ratio of employees that are in the private labor sector vis-à-vis the elastic public labor market. The JG labor sector, unlike the private labor market, is underwritten by the state acting as an employer of last resort. The paper makes a case illustrating that although a JG economy is superior to a liberal economy, political impediments would render the scheme inoperative, owing to organized labor's resistance to how a JG economy (1) controls inflation and (2) stabilizes <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> <b>disequilibrium.</b> The paper concludes with an alternative examination illustrating that full employment with inflation control is possible, though only if certain post-liberal institutions are established.

During the past decade, Tanzania has faced an unprecedented economic crisis, characterised by severe <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> <b>disequilibrium,</b> high inflation, and large government budget deficits. Population has grown more rapidly than gross domestic product. Shortages of consumer goods were widespread and intermittent food shortage had to be met by food imports. To tackle the economic crisis, government implemented several adjustment and stabilization programmes (Ndulu and Lipumba, 1986). These policies culminated in significant devaluation and the liberalization of imports financed by privately-owned foreign exchange. Restrictions on private trade b food grains were relaxed. In June 1986, the government adopted the World Bank and IMF-supported Economic Recovery Programme (ERP). The policy measures taken included a major devaluation and a crawling peg to correct future overvaluation, control of the growth of government expenditures to reduce and limit government borrowing from the banking system, increases in agricultural producer prices, and further relaxation of restrictions on private trade in major food grains. The policy thrust has been to adopt market-oriented policy instruments and to depend less on state-controlled procedures. Since 1984 government has further liberalized the economy.

These include crises in electricity generation and distribution, domestic and external debt crisis, <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> <b>disequilibrium</b> and fluctuations in key macroeconomic variables such as broad money supply, exchange rate, real GDP growth rate etc. This paper has attempted to investigate the impact of stabilization policies (monetary and fiscal policies) and electricity supply on economic development in Nigeria using the OLS estimation technique. The time series characteristics of the variables were tested using the Ng and Perron (2001) modified unit root test and the (ARDL) bounds testing approach to cointegration proposed by Pesaran et al (2001). The result of the parsimonious estimates showed that broad money supply, government expenditure and electricity supply were important determinants of per capita GDP growth rate in Nigeria. To test {{for the importance of}} electricity supply in the model, we run the regression first without electricity supply and then with electricity supply, the inclusion of electricity supply in the regression significantly improved the diagnostic statistics.

40|$|This thesis aims {{to analyse}} the {{connection}} between the Eurozone's balance of payments crisis and the TARGET 2 balances. These balances represent mutual clearing relationship of the individual euro area member states to the European Central Bank inside the TARGET 2 system, which serves as a heart of the Eurozone's payment settlements. In fact, the central banks of the core countries hold significant positive balances while the peripheral central banks accumulated substantial negative positions. The TARGET 2 balances appeared mainly {{as a consequence of the}} liquidity outflow from the peripheral countries to the core due to the large imbalances in fundamental factors such as the NCA deficits, net foreign debt, public and private debt or competitiveness. The development of the balances was further facilitated via uneven liquidity provisions from the Eurosystem, as the peripheral countries effectively financed their <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> <b>disequilibrium</b> by issuing new liquidity that almost immediately moved to the core. The banking systems of the core started to operate in the liquidity excess status as the monetary base increased in 2011 and 2012. Assets with questionable quality collateralized the increasing refinancing operations in the periphery as the collateral requirements were repeatedly lowered. It resulted in an increase in the credit risk of these operations primarily in the periphery countries. This situation, among many others presented in this thesis, raises further questions about the parameters of the future single monetary policy as well as the continuance of the European monetary union...|$|E
40|$|In the {{literature}} there seems a certain {{consensus that the}} international dimension {{played an important role}} in influencing the choices of Central-East European countries (CEECs) and most of the New Independent States of the former Soviet Union (NIS) in introducing democracy and market-oriented economies. The aim of the chapter is to examine how certain external economic influences affected democratic consolidation and the introduction of market forces in the post-communist countries. The analysis concentrates on the role played by external economic actors, taking as a case study the IMF. At times the IMF was accused of undermining the sovereignty and political legitimacy of beneficiary countries. These countries are said to have little choice but to accept the unpopular measures forced upon them by the IMF. It is true that at times when the external situation of a country deteriorated rapidly, with <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> <b>disequilibrium,</b> loss of reserves and, in some cases, difficulty in servicing foreign debt, transition countries were heavily dependent on the IMF for assistance (in particular, because of the application of cross-conditionality by other international organisations such as the EU). However, over time the bargaining power of the recipient country appears to have played an important role, and all the transition countries proved unwilling or unable to protract the application of austerity measures for more than a year or two. Given the claims of mistaken policies, undue interference and lack of transparency against the IMF on the one hand, and the increasing volatility of the international financial system on the other, the debate about reform of the international financial architecture acquired a new urgency. In the case of Europe one of the main reforms proposed, i. e. an increased role for regional integration blocs, has de facto already been implemented. At least in the countries, which have applied for membership, the EU is the main external actor, and applies a more far-reaching and stringent economic and political conditionality than was ever the case for the IMF...|$|E
40|$|Economies {{benefit from}} {{international}} trade, but joining {{the world market}} also exposes them to external shocks. How can the government in Eastern European and developing countries reduce their vulnerability to such shocks? What are appropriate policy responses? The authors examine how external shocks (such as commodity price changes, variations in global demand, and fluctuating interest) affect economic performance, and how those effects are mitigated by the right policy responses at the right time. They introduce a methodology for measuring the effect on current account of external shocks and apply it for the Philippines. They rationalize balance of payments responses to external shocks and domestic policies in a theoretical model of a small open economy. Did the Philippines choose the appropriate policies when faced with <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> <b>disequilibrium?</b> Among comparable Asian countries, the Philippines in 1970 enjoyed a relatively high per capita income that has since failed to keep pace. Why? Adverse shocks did not help, but {{other countries in the}} region experienced similar shocks and performed better. The Philippines relied heavily on external flow, which fueled an investment boom. Given low real interest rates at the time, this seemed a reasonable approach - but there were two flaws to it. First, the investments were poorly conceived, were mismanaged, failed to produce appropriate returns, and became a burden on the state. One large nuclear power plant has yet to yield a return. Second, with so many external resources available, the government ignored the need for meaningful structural reform, especially in trade and public resources and distortionary trade policies can absorb more than all the gains from favorable shocks. When external conditions improved in the mid- 1980 s, the Philippines could not take advantage of them because of its heavy external debt and its cumbersome trade regime. Had authorities introduced structural reform (liberalizing trade, strengthening public finance, and freezing up factor markets), the economy could have more easily absorbed the impact of unfavorable shocks. In 1991, the IMF gave the Philippines a stand-by credit. Authorities are now addressing some structural problems by liberalizing the exchange rate, removing import tariffs, and restructuring the public sector, including the Central Bank. Perhaps this will allow more sustainable growth and an economy that can more readily absorb external shocks...|$|E
