This paper investigates the association between prudence and the monitoring of financial ratios by credit union trade associations. We find that compliance with the mandated level of capital reserves is uniformly high, regardless of the existence or extent of self-regulation. However, after controlling for cross-sectional differences in profitability, age, size, growth and common <b>bond</b> <b>type</b> <b>a</b> positive association exists between self-regulation and financial ratios measuring prudence and loan book quality. These findings have policy implications for the regulation of credit unions in Northern Ireland and elsewhere regarding potential regulatory cost savings from reliance on self-regulation provided by trade association...|$|E
40|$|Atropisomers are {{stereoisomers}} {{resulting from}} restricted rotation around single bonds {{such that the}} rotational barrier is high enough to permit observation of the isomeric species. Atropisomers are numerous in number and type: among atropisomers of the sp 2 –sp 2 single <b>bond</b> <b>type,</b> <b>a</b> classical example is constituted by the biphenyls (or biaryls in gen-eral) {{as shown in figure}} 1 A. When X ≠ Y and U ≠ V and if the steric interaction of X–U, X–V, and/or Y–V, Y–U is large enough, two nonplanar, axially chiral enantiomers exist [1]. Another example of atropisomerism, related to the biphenyl-type, was first reported by Gottwald and Ullman in the por-phyrin series (Fig. 1 B) [2]. This type of atropisomerism in porphyrins has been utilised in the design of superstructured models of the active sites of hemoproteins [3 - 7]. Porphyrins (see Fig. 3) are macrocycles consisting of fou...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Robust {{methods to}} tune the unique {{electronic}} properties of graphene by chemical modification are in great demand {{due to the}} potential of the two dimensional material to impact a range of device applications. Here we show that carbon and nitrogen core-level resonant X-ray spectroscopy is a sensitive probe of chemical bonding and electronic structure of chemical dopants introduced in single-sheet graphene films. In conjunction with density functional theory based calculations, we are able to obtain a detailed picture of <b>bond</b> <b>types</b> and electronic structure in graphene doped with nitrogen at the sub-percent level. We show that different N-bond types, including graphitic, pyridinic, and nitrilic, can exist in a single, dilutely N-doped graphene sheet.

50|$|The blue seed has two {{different}} <b>types.</b> First, the <b>bond</b> <b>type,</b> is <b>a</b> strong, concentrated sphere of energy which will {{home in on}} enemies at a close range, attach to the creature, and explode.

This can be used by Orestes and Polyxena. The blue colored spheres are good against large, armored enemies, but since the bubble has a slow fire rate and the 8-point range has holes in its field, they are not good against swarms of small enemies.|$|R
