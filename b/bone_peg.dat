40|$|The {{mechanical}} rigidity {{of three}} different methods of resorbable intramedullary fixation (<b>bone</b> <b>peg,</b> and polyglycolide rods with and without interlocking) was assessed in a comminuted phalangeal fracture model and the results compared with two commonly used internal fixation devices (lateral plate, crossed K-wires) in a cadaver model. Each fixation technique was tested for its biomechanical strength in apex palmar bending, compression and torsion. Failure testing for the three resorbable methods was also done. The results showed that lateral plating provided the best rigidity in apex palmar bending and torsion, followed by intramedullary <b>bone</b> <b>peg</b> fixation. All resorbable intramedullary fixations had rigidity that was at least the same as crossed K-wires. For the torque test, polyglycolide rods with interlocking provided better rigidity than without interlocking.

40|$|In this paper, we {{wished to}} determine: (1) if a greater trochanteric epiphysiodesis (GTE) slows {{the growth of}} the greater trochanter; (2) if <b>bone</b> <b>peg</b> epiphysiodesis or screw epiphysiodesis is more {{effective}} at slowing greater trochanteric growth; and (3) if a GTE is most effective in young (8) age. In this retrospective study, 35 children with unilateral Perthes disease underwent GTE. The height of the greater trochanter was measured radiographically at the time of surgery and at least two years after surgery. The untreated opposite side, which showed no radiographic evidence of Perthes disease, was used as a control. Epiphysiodesis was performed by using multiple drill holes and either a screw or a <b>bone</b> <b>peg.</b> Mean age at the time of surgery was 7  years (range, 3. 2 to 12. 2  years) and mean follow-up was 58  months (range, 24 to 104  months).

40|$|One {{does not}} need to mention the {{necessity}} for some certain and reliable means to stimulate the length-growth of long bones. Clinically many causes enter into the production of shortening deformities,-just as, conversely, many causes produce an unusual longitudinal growth. Among such causes are trauma, congenital deformities, vascular disturb-ances, rickets, osteomalacia, osteitis deformans, syphilis, chronic or acute illness, chronic or acute infections of the bone, especially in and about the metaphysis; osteomyelitis is a common agent in this respect. The use of ivory or <b>bone</b> <b>pegs</b> driven into the femoral or tibial epi-physes, or both, is advocated by some clinicians and condemned by others. Goldthwait states that in cases where slight infections or sloughing has occurred about the pegs, the stimulation was more marked.

30|$|Various {{treatment}} options have been proposed, including <b>bone</b> <b>peg</b> epiphysiodesis, pinning in situ (PIS), closed reduction and pinning (CRIF), open reduction and physeal osteotomy (PO), open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) and Ganz surgical dislocation (GSD). The types of fixation devices and their designs {{have been the}} subject of various researches. Ideal fixation devices should prevent further slippage, while allowing for continued growth with possible remodelling and prevention of future impingement [21 – 24]. The general consensus appears to be managing patients according to their slip grade. This was addressed in a review of the subject by Loder et al. in 2012, with mild and moderate slips tending to be treated with pinning in situ. Severe slips can be challenging to manage, as achieving a screw position centrally in the epiphysis with PIS may be technically difficult and subsequent remodelling may be insufficient.|$|E

30|$|This {{study was}} based on a {{previous}} follow-up study of patients treated for SCFE [8]. The patients were identified by searching through the radiographic archive of our hospital during the year 2006. We included patients that were living in the South-East area of Norway, with all radiographs available and a minimum follow-up of 20  years follow-up. Seventy-nine patients met the inclusion criteria. However, 15 patients were not included for the following reasons: nine patients had died during the follow-up time, five patients did not respond to the enquiry and one patient did not want to participate in the study. Sixteen patients (including two with bilateral slip) did not appear for the follow-up examination and were evaluated by telephone interview. Thus, 48 patients were examined with follow-up radiographs. Eight of these patients had bilateral slip and were, therefore, not included in this study. Thus, 40 patients (18 men and 22 women) with unilateral SCFE were included. The mean age at diagnosis was 13.8  years among the male patients and 12.6  years among the female patients. Thirty-five patients had been treated with in situ fixation alone (23 with screw fixation and 12 with <b>bone</b> <b>peg</b> epiphysiodesis) and five patients with in situ fixation combined with corrective femoral osteotomy.

Like other Gaucho huts--which are nearly all alike--it was covered with long yellow grass, and bore so strong a resemblance to the surrounding country, that, at a little distance, it might easily have been mistaken for a hillock. The kitchen of the establishment was a detached shed a few yards off. After sunset the hut was lighted by a feeble lamp, made of bullock's tallow, which brought into strong relief the bridles, spurs, bolas, and lassos which hung from <b>bone</b> <b>pegs</b> on the walls.

Last, but not least in importance, a Gaucho infant hung suspended from the rafters in a primitive cradle of bullock's skin, the corners of which were drawn together by four strips of hide.

40|$|As yet {{the only}} thing we can do in the {{treatment}} of slipped epiphysis of the femoral head is to try to detect the condition as early as possible and prevent further slipping. If slipping is advanced, attempts must be made to improve the position of the epiphysis. If slipping is slight to moderate, the epiphysis may be fixed without preliminary correction of its position since such a degree of slip-ping does not seriously impair function and any secondary arthritic changes are usually slight. Howorth, in 1941 and 1949, reviewed a large series of patients with slipped upper femoral epiphyses treated by the method he had been using since 1930. He secures fixation by inserting <b>bone</b> <b>pegs</b> through drill holes across the epiphyseal plate. (A similar method has since been described by Heyman and Herndon.) In Howorth’s method the results he achieved must be regarded as very good; there was no aseptic necrosis nor did any serious complication occur in the 200 hips operated on. The only disadvantage of his method is the relatively long interval before weight-bearing is allowed. This period varies with the age of the child and the state of the epiphyseal plate. Howorth permitted weight-bearing about ten weeks postoperatively. It was mainly because of the length of this period that Waldenstr#{ 246 }m, in Sweden, recommended nailing according to the method described by Wilson in 1938; fixation of the epiphysis with a three-flanged nail, a method which has since been widely used in our country and with which this paper is concerned.

40|$|Background Glenoid {{component}} failure {{is the most}} common complication of total shoulder arthroplasty. It can be correlated with failure of the component itself to resist wear and deformation, failure of fixation or failure of the glenoid <b>bone.</b> Anchor <b>Peg</b> Glenoid component (Depuy) seems to have a higher bone fixation in biomechanical canine model: it is a all-polyethylene, concave component with one circumferentially fluted, central, interference-fit peg and three small cemented peripheral pegs. Materials and methods We realized a prospective study of Anchor Peg total shoulder arthroplasty, included 27 patients suffering from primary arthrosis or arthritis, without rotator cuff tear. A clinical and radiographic evaluation was performed at 3 months, 1 and 2 years; a CT scan was made in postoperative and analyzed central <b>peg’s</b> <b>bone</b> integration 1 year later. Results Improvement of postoperative Constant score and radiographic good results were correlated with satisfactory subjective results reported by patients.

Twenty-six CT scans were available at 1 year: it showed complete bone integration around the central peg in 21 cases and partial peripheral bone integration in four cases. Only one patient had any tissue integration around the peg, probably because of his implantation near cortical bone of scapular spine.

This operation hasbeen performed in Bath, {{since the beginning of}} I 955, and is presented as one of simplicity, freefrom complication and {{with a high degree of}} success. In I 952 Duncan McKeever described a method of arthrodesing this joint, by means of a screwinserted across the excised joint, the head of the screw lying under the proximal phalanx, the screwitself occupying the whole of the medulla of the metatarsal shaft. He appeared to be wholly satisfied with the results, but patients who havehad this type of fusion have, on occasion, com-plained of pain over the screw head on walking, with loss of the efficient functioning of the longflexor of the toe, an all-important factor in securing a satisfactory gait. In addition, the presence of the metallic foreign body in the metatarsal shaft has on one occasion provoked abony reaction with periosteal new bone formation, and cavitation of the metatarsal, accompanied by severe pain. These complications have necessitated removal of the screw, a task which is not always simple and which subjects the patient to a second opera-tive procedure. The method of fusion to be described obviates these complications. Indications for Arthrodesis There has been described in orthopaedicliterature a multitude of operative procedures for arthritic conditions of the first metatarso-phalan-geal joint. Among these have been attempts to correct, by osteotomy, the direction of the first metatarsal in metatarsus primus varus in young adults, the basic deformity at this age.

Normal saline solution was used to expand the diame-ter of its membrane from 7. 8 to 10. 5 mm, resulting in abutment of the distal peg to the compacted cancellous bone of the femoral head.

40|$|Objectives: To {{test whether}} or not an {{experimental}} polyethylene glycol (PEG) membrane maintains the bone graft volume and contributes {{to the preservation of}} the ridge contour in comparison with a commercially available synthetic membrane. Materials and methods: In 18 dogs, all mandibular premolars and the first molars were extracted. Ten weeks later, acute standardized defects were prepared. The defects of four dogs were randomly assigned to three modalities: (1) PEG plus deproteinized bovine <b>bone</b> mineral (DBBM) (<b>PEG),</b> (2) a resorbable glycolide trimethylene carbonate membrane plus DBBM (PGA-TMC), and (3) DBBM alone (DBBM). These dogs were then sacrificed for the baseline measurements. The remaining defects of 14 dogs were randomly assigned to (1) PEG plus DBBM, (2) PGA-TMC plus DBBM, (3) DBBM, and (4) empty defect. The dogs were sacrificed at baseline (n= 4), 4 weeks (n= 7), or at 16 weeks (n= 7). Mixed model regressions and the non-parametric Brunner-Langer method were applied for statistical analysis. Results: At baseline, equal tissue augmentation was observed in all groups. At 4 and 16 weeks, the greatest augmented area fractions were calculated for PEG (103 %; 107 %, respectively), followed by PGA-TMC (98 %; 91 %), DBBM (85 %; 78 %), and empty (46 %; 54 %), being statistically significant different (P< 0. 001) between PEG and empty at 4 and 16 weeks, and PEG and DBBM at 16 weeks. The overall decrease (P≤ 0. 01) in the amount of bone graft between baseline and 16 weeks was - 14 % (PEG), - 22 % (PGA-TMC), and - 23 % (DBBM). Conclusions: The study demonstrates that the combination of the PEG membrane with DBBM maintains the bone graft volume over time better than controls. The PEG membrane with DBBM was also the most effective method to preserve the ridge contour. To cite this article: Thoma DS, Dard MM, Hälg G-A, Ramel CF, Hämmerle CHF, Jung RE.

40|$|There is {{increasing}} use of Unicondylar or Unicompartmental Knee Replacements (UKR), especially following publication of good survival data and a trend towards ‘minimally invasive surgery’. The UKR preserves one of the femoral condyles and its meniscus, plus both of the cruciate ligaments. Therefore, the knee functions more normally following UKR than after Total Knee Replacement (TKR). However, the odds for failure of the UKR are higher than the TKR, and a principal reason is loosening of the tibial and femoral components. There {{is a need for}} the development of more reliable UKR fixation designs. The overall aim of this research was to understand fixation of UKR and make recommendations for improvement to designers and surgeons. Since the Oxford mobile-bearing UKR is most widely used in the UK, it was used as the benchmark in this study. To assess initial fixation, in-vitro bone-constructs were prepared from ten cadavers implanted with the Oxford mobile-bearing UKR and tested for bone strain and bone-implant interface motion with the implants fixed using first cementless and then cemented methods. Cementless fixation produced higher proximal tibia strain and bone-implant displacement than cemented fixation. Peak bone strain increased with reduced bone density, such that the lowest density specimen fractured when implanted with the cementless UKR. To assess long-term fixation, an in-vivo prospective follow-up study of 11 Oxford UKR patients was developed and conducted for one-year, taking measurements of bone density using Dual X-Ray Absorptiometry (DXA) scanning. The average bone resorption under the tibial implant was found to be low; while it was higher under the femoral component and very high under the tibial intercondylar eminence. The fixation of the Oxford UKR implant was considered to be adequate at 1 -year. Finite Element (FE) simulation techniques were reviewed and developed to simulate the UKR knee for investigation of bone strain, bone-implant interface micromotion and bone remodelling to assess initial and long-term fixation performance. Computer simulations of the tibiae and femora of 2 patients and 4 cadaveric specimens (obtained from the in-vivo and in-vitro studies) were developed and validated for bone strain, bone-implant interface micromotion and bone remodelling. Comparative multi-specimen computational studies were conducted to understand how particular design features affected fixation. Good fixation was indicated for cementless UKRs when implanted in dense bone, but bone strains were very high in low density tibia. Cementation of the implants spread the loads more evenly and reduced bone strains. The cementless tibial implant caused less bone resorption (compared to the cemented equivalent) but the difference in the femur was small. Bone resorption was highest at the anterior tibia and posterior to the femoral <b>peg.</b> <b>Bone</b> density was an important factor in the fixation performance of implant design features. Less bulky fixation features reduced bone resorption, provided that the underlying bone was sufficiently dense to maintain bone strains below the failure limit of bone. For patients with dense bone, fixation could be improved with shorter tibial keels and less stiff femoral implants. For patients with low density bone, fixation could be improved with cementation and bone resection that avoids creating stress-raisers. Imperial Users onl...|$|R
