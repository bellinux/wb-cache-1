5|$|A {{feature-length film}} that {{indirectly}} parodies Star Trek is Galaxy Quest. This film is <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>premise</b> that aliens monitoring the broadcast of an Earth-based TV series called Galaxy Quest, modeled heavily on Star Trek, {{believe that what}} they are seeing is real. Many Star Trek actors have been quoted saying that Galaxy Quest was a brilliant parody.|$|E
5|$|The goddess-oriented Shakti {{tradition}} of Hinduism is <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>premise</b> that the Supreme Principle and the Ultimate Reality called Brahman is female (Devi), but it treats the male as her equal and complementary partner. This partner is Shiva.|$|E
5|$|A {{central part}} of Macdonald's case {{concerned}} the redistribution of wealth from richer provinces to poorer ones. His argument was <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>premise</b> that richer provinces benefited from national economic policies such as high tariffs while poorer provinces were penalized by them. Macdonald suggested that compensatory subsidies to poorer, less-populated provinces be based on need, not population, {{so that they could}} pay for government services available {{in other parts of the}} country without having to impose higher-than-average levels of taxation.|$|E
50|$|The {{argument}} is valid (because the conclusion is true <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>premises,</b> that is, that the conclusion follows <b>the</b> <b>premises)</b> and since <b>the</b> <b>premises</b> {{are in fact}} true, the {{argument is}} sound.|$|R

5|$|Orci and Kurtzman {{also worked}} {{together}} as executive producers on the animated television series, , {{due to their}} involvement with the live action movies. Following {{the end of the}} series they were hopeful to be involved in a future animated series <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>premise,</b> which Orci saw less like a reboot of the show and more of a continuation in a different guise. He felt that while Prime was sophisticated, there were concerns that it was leaving younger viewers behind because of its complexity and intensity.|$|E
5|$|Research {{has found}} a {{tentative}} benefit in using minocycline to treat schizophrenia. Nidotherapy or efforts to change the environment of people with schizophrenia to improve their ability to function, is also being studied; however, {{there is not enough}} evidence yet to make conclusions about its effectiveness. Negative symptoms have proven a challenge to treat, as they are generally not made better by medication. Various agents have been explored for possible benefits in this area. There have been trials on drugs with anti-inflammatory activity, <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>premise</b> that inflammation might {{play a role in the}} pathology of schizophrenia.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} time in the United States {{includes}} DST during both world wars, but no standardization of peacetime DST until 1966. In May 1965, for two weeks, St. Paul, Minnesota and Minneapolis, Minnesota were on different times, when the capital city decided to join most of the nation by starting Daylight Saving Time while Minneapolis opted to follow the later date set by state law. In the mid-1980s, Clorox (parent of Kingsford Charcoal) and 7-Eleven provided the primary funding for the Daylight Saving Time Coalition behind the 1987 extension to U.S. DST, and both Idaho senators voted for it <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>premise</b> that during DST fast-food restaurants sell more French fries, which are made from Idaho potatoes.|$|E
5000|$|A {{deductive}} argument {{asserts that}} {{the truth of the}} conclusion is a logical consequence of <b>the</b> <b>premises.</b> <b>Based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>premises,</b> <b>the</b> conclusion follows necessarily (with certainty). For example, given premises that A=B and B=C, then the conclusion follows necessarily that A=C. Deductive arguments are sometimes referred to as [...] "truth-preserving" [...] arguments.|$|R
50|$|In 1991, in the Patrick Ryan v. Maharishi Yogi case {{filed in}} the US District Court in Washington, DC, Judge Oliver Gasch refused to allow Singer to testify, <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>premises</b> that Singer and Ofshe's theory did not enjoy {{substantial}} scientific approval and was therefore not admissible {{as the basis of}} expert opinion.|$|R
50|$|The school {{campus is}} <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>premises</b> of a 17th-century palace, the Quinta de Nossa Senhora da Conceição in Barcarena, Oeiras. The 5 hectare campus was newly {{refurbished}} in 2011, boasting {{a vast array}} of state-of-the-art amenities. During its inaugural year (2010/2011), the school opened at temporary premises, located at Fundição de Oeiras, but has since been located at its present campus.|$|R
5|$|Like the Battles of Marathon and Thermopylae, Salamis {{has gained}} {{something}} of a 'legendary' status (unlike, for instance, the more decisive Battle of Plataea), {{perhaps because of the}} desperate circumstances and the unlikely odds. A significant number of historians have stated that Salamis {{is one of the most}} significant battles in human history (though the same is often stated of Marathon). In a more extreme form of this argument, some historians argue that if the Greeks had lost at Salamis, the ensuing conquest of Greece by the Persians would have effectively stifled the growth of Western Civilization as we know it. This view is <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>premise</b> that much of modern Western society, such as philosophy, science, personal freedom and democracy are rooted in the legacy of Ancient Greece. Thus, this school of thought argues that, given the domination of much of modern history by Western Civilization, Persian domination of Greece might have changed the whole trajectory of human history. It is also worth mentioning that the celebrated blossoming of hugely influential Athenian culture occurred only after the Persian wars were won.|$|E

50|$|A {{range of}} methods {{can be used}} to assess which {{environmental}} enrichments should be provided. These are <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>premises</b> that captive animals should perform behaviours in a similar way to those in the ethogram of their ancestral species, animals should be allowed to perform the activities or interactions they prefer, i.e. preference test studies, and animals should be allowed to perform those activities for which they are highly motivated, i.e. motivation studies.|$|R

The charging frequency was derived from field trial results taken from the BMW ActiveE and MINI E vehicles in Asia, Europe and the U.S., whereby the typical commuting use between the pilot users' homes and workplaces was calculated.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>premises</b> of non-materialistic {{explanations}} of the mind, some have suggested {{the existence of a}} cosmic consciousness, asserting that consciousness is actually the [...] "ground of all being". Proponents of this view cite accounts of paranormal phenomena, primarily extrasensory perceptions and psychic powers, as evidence for an incorporeal higher consciousness. In hopes of proving the existence of these phenomena, parapsychologists have orchestrated various experiments, but successful results might be due to poor experimental controls and might have alternative explanations.|$|R

The developed model explains a traveler’s propensity to comply with received advice {{in terms of the}} interaction between his preferences for different travel alternatives, relative importance attached to travel times, perceived travel time uncertainty and perceived unreliability of the information. Following the presentation of the model, we illustrate its workings by means of numerical simulations...|$|R

25|$|Nāda yoga {{centers on}} deep inner listening, chanting, and {{elevated}} music. Its {{theoretical and practical}} aspects are <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>premise</b> that everything that exists, including human beings, consists of sound vibrations, called nāda. The aim of hatha yoga is to hear the nadam – the soundless sound, which is Om – by first perfecting the ability to listen. Jivamukti Yoga practices this through chanting and inspirational music.|$|E
25|$|In {{statutory}} rape, overt {{force or}} threat {{need not be}} present. The laws presume coercion, because a minor or mentally challenged adult is legally incapable of giving consent to the act. Statutory rape laws are <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>premise</b> that until a person reaches a certain age, {{he or she is}} legally incapable of consenting to sexual intercourse. Thus, even if a minor engages in sexual intercourse willingly, the intercourse is not consensual.|$|E
