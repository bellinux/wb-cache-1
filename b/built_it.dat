5|$|In 1864 the Board {{decided to}} seek powers {{to extend the}} railway beyond Gupworthy to {{workings}} in Joyce's Cleeve in the Quarme Valley. Preliminary notices to this effect were published, but no application was made. Had the line been <b>built</b> <b>it</b> would have entailed another incline, which ore {{would have had to}} ascend before travelling eastwards to Brendon Hill where it would travel down again.|$|E
5|$|Only one BT19 was <b>built.</b> <b>It</b> {{was bought}} by Repco in 2004 and put {{on display in the}} National Sports Museum in Melbourne, Australia, in 2008. It is often {{demonstrated}} at motorsport events.|$|E
5|$|The F-4J had {{improved}} air-to-air and ground-attack capability; deliveries begun in 1966 {{and ended in}} 1972 with 522 <b>built.</b> <b>It</b> was equipped with J79-GE-10 engines with 17,844lbf (79.374kN) thrust, the Westinghouse AN/AWG-10 Fire Control System (making the F-4J the first fighter {{in the world with}} operational look-down/shoot-down capability), a new integrated missile control system and the AN/AJB-7 bombing system for expanded ground attack capability.|$|E

50|$|Between 1949 and 1952, the Sosa Reservoir was <b>built.</b> <b>Its</b> dam {{is almost}} 60 m high and its area is 39.3 ha.|$|R
50|$|A {{station wagon}} was offered for 1951, with only 251 <b>built.</b> <b>Its</b> 131.5 in {{wheelbase}} {{is the longest}} ever used on a station wagon.|$|R
5|$|Two-seat trainer {{version of}} F-105D with {{lengthened}} forward fuselage. It was fully combat-capable and had dual controls, taller fin, and increased takeoff weight; its first flight {{took place on}} 11 June 1963. A total of 143 were <b>built.</b> <b>It</b> featured the AN/APN-148 navigational radar.|$|E
5|$|When <b>built,</b> <b>it</b> was {{expected}} that the reservoir would supply water for municipal use in the Amman region. However, the current levels of pollution in the lake make the water unfit for human consumption, and it is used for irrigation only.|$|E
5|$|After {{filing for}} a patent for the {{additron}} tube, Rogers Majestic pushed Kates to create a device to showcase the tube to potential buyers. Kates designed a specialized computer incorporating the technology and <b>built</b> <b>it</b> {{with the assistance of}} engineers from Rogers Majestic. The large, four meter tall metal computer could only play tic-tac-toe and was installed in the Engineering Building at the Canadian National Exhibition from 25 August–9 September 1950.|$|E
50|$|By 1924 The Indialantic Casino was <b>built.</b> <b>Its</b> {{name was}} later changed to the Bahama Beach Club. This is the {{location}} of Nance Park today.|$|R
500|$|Beginning in 1942 an {{improved}} {{version of the}} bomb was <b>built.</b> <b>Its</b> nose was much less thick and it contained [...] of trinitroanisole. It weighed [...]|$|R
50|$|From 1884 to 1885, a new chancel was <b>built.</b> <b>Its</b> {{architect}} was A.E. Purdie, {{who also}} designed Kilworth House and the chapel at Rudding Park House.|$|R
5|$|Burnside {{was ordered}} to take the IX Corps back to the Eastern Theater, where he <b>built</b> <b>it</b> up to a {{strength}} of over 21,000 in Annapolis, Maryland. The IX Corps fought in the Overland Campaign of May 1864 as an independent command, reporting initially to Grant; his corps was not assigned to the Army of the Potomac because Burnside outranked its commander Maj. Gen. George G. Meade, {{who had been a}} division commander under Burnside at Fredericksburg. This cumbersome arrangement was rectified on May 24 just before the Battle of North Anna, when Burnside agreed to waive his precedence of rank and was placed under Meade's direct command.|$|E
5|$|From 1749 to the 1760s, Fort Chambray {{was built}} on the island of Gozo. It was {{intended}} to be a new fortified city like Valletta, and eventually to replace the Cittadella as the island's capital. This was unsuccessful, and eventually only the fort was <b>built.</b> <b>It</b> saw some action during the French occupation of 1798, but its importance eventually diminished. It was converted into a hospital in the 19th century. In the 1990s, the interior of the fort began to be redeveloped, but the outer bastions and some barracks remain intact.|$|E
5|$|In 1866, American {{soldiers}} established Camp Warner, {{a military}} camp near present-day Hart Mountain National Antelope Refuge in Lake County. They were sent from Boise, Idaho, {{to build a}} military camp in the high desert, and <b>built</b> <b>it</b> east of the Warner Lakes, because they doubted that they could cross the series of wetlands. Maj. Gen. George Crook disapproved of the soldiers' decision. He built a road across the lakes and moved the camp to {{the western side of}} them.|$|E
50|$|The {{homopolar}} motor {{was the first}} electrical motor to be <b>built.</b> <b>Its</b> operation was demonstrated by Michael Faraday in 1821 at the Royal Institution in London.|$|R
50|$|Beginning in 1942 an {{improved}} {{version of the}} bomb was <b>built.</b> <b>Its</b> nose was much less thick and it contained 35.7 kg of trinitroanisole. It weighed 811.2 kg.|$|R
50|$|In 1947, the Church by the Sea was built.In 1948, the Beach Club was <b>built.</b> <b>Its</b> {{restaurant}} was operated by Howard Johnson's.In 1949, a new bridge was started over Baker Haulover.|$|R
5|$|In 1889 the Duke of Buckingham died, and in 1894 the {{trustees}} of his estate {{set up the}} Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad Company (O) {{with the intention of}} extending the line from Brill to Oxford, but the extension beyond Brill was never built. Rail services from London to Oxford were very poor at this time; despite being an extremely roundabout route, had the connection from Quainton Road to Oxford been <b>built</b> <b>it</b> would have been the shortest route between Oxford and the City of London.|$|E
5|$|In Sweden, as of 2007 {{there are}} ten {{operating}} nuclear reactors that produce about 45% of its electricity. Two other reactors in Barsebäck {{were shut down}} in 1999 and 2005. When these reactors were <b>built,</b> <b>it</b> was expected their nuclear fuel would be reprocessed in a foreign country, and the reprocessing waste would not be returned to Sweden. Later, construction of a domestic reprocessing plant was contemplated, but has not been built.|$|E
5|$|Kraków's {{early history}} begins with {{evidence}} of a Stone Age settlement on the present site of the Wawel Hill. A legend attributes Kraków's founding to the mythical ruler Krakus, who <b>built</b> <b>it</b> above a cave occupied by a dragon, Smok Wawelski. The first written record of the city's name dates back to 965, when Kraków {{was described as a}} notable commercial centre controlled first by Moravia (876–879), but captured by a Bohemian duke Boleslaus I in 955. The first acclaimed ruler of Poland, Mieszko I, took Kraków from the Bohemians and incorporated it into the holdings of the Piast dynasty towards the end of his reign.|$|E
50|$|The new 40/50 was {{responsible}} for Rolls-Royce's early reputation with over 6,000 <b>built.</b> <b>Its</b> chassis {{was used as a}} basis for the first British armoured car used in both world wars.|$|R
5000|$|... 1920s - The Indialantic Hotel was <b>built.</b> <b>Its</b> {{name was}} later changed to the Tradewinds Hotel. The hotel was {{on what is}} now South Shannon Avenue, the current {{location}} of Tradewinds Terrace.|$|R

5|$|On 4 May 1684 an {{earthquake}} devastated the city, severely damaging the Santa María castle. A road linking the Santa María de la Cabeza and San Antonio de la Eminencia castles was mentioned by Agustín Crame in a 1777 {{proposal for the}} defense of the city. Crame opposed the idea, but stated that if a road were <b>built</b> <b>it</b> should be a gravel one. The Santa María de la Cabeza castle was partially destroyed in a powerful earthquake felt throughout the state in 1797.|$|E
5|$|On September 15, 2014, Marshall County {{officials}} {{brought the}} extension of I-68 up again {{as a way for}} oil companies to have easier access to drill into the area, likely by fracking. Much like the second leg of the Southern Beltway in the Pittsburgh area, an extension of I-68 is being spurred in response to the Marcellus natural gas trend. If the extension were to be <b>built,</b> <b>it</b> would also include a widening of WV2 to four lanes and would cost an estimated $5 million per mile. It is expected that the project would be divided into two legs, first from Morgantown to Cameron, then Cameron to Moundsville.|$|E
5|$|Pilot {{plants were}} {{built at the}} Anacostia Naval Air Station and the Philadelphia Navy Yard, and a {{production}} facility at the Clinton Engineer Works in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. This was the only production-scale liquid thermal diffusion plant ever <b>built.</b> <b>It</b> could not enrich uranium sufficiently for use in an atomic bomb, but it could provide slightly enriched feed for the Y-12 calutrons and the K-25 gaseous diffusion plants. It was estimated that the S-50 plant had sped up production of enriched uranium used in the Little Boy bomb employed in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima by a week.|$|E
50|$|Ruins of the Roman amphitheatre on the main, {{left bank}} of the Charente, near {{the summit of the}} hill upon which the town was <b>built.</b> <b>Its</b> notable tiers (cavea) are built against the hill and an embankment.|$|R
50|$|Cormorán is {{a coastal}} and fluvial {{research}} ship {{designed by the}} engineering team at Río Santiago Shipyard, where <b>it</b> was <b>built.</b> <b>Its</b> hull has a metallic structure covered with cedar wooden planks, and its superstructure is made of aluminium.|$|R

5|$|Pinat HaGola ("Diaspora's Place) is a {{memorial}} {{site for the}} children {{who died in the}} Holocaust. The monument was built by the sculptor Zeev Ben-Zvi, between 1945 and 1947. He <b>built</b> <b>it</b> with the students of the kibbutz and it was the earliest memorial site for the Holocaust in Israel. During the battle of Mishmar HaEmek in 1948, the site was damaged by a shell, but Zeev Ben-Zvi refused to repair it.|$|E
5|$|Significant {{obstacles}} had to {{be overcome}} in the handling of both fluorine and UF6. Before the K-25 gaseous diffusion plant could be <b>built,</b> <b>it</b> was first necessary to develop non-reactive chemical compounds {{that could be used}} as coatings, lubricants and gaskets for the surfaces which would come into contact with the UF6 gas (a highly reactive and corrosive substance). William T. Miller, professor of organic chemistry at Cornell University, was co-opted to develop such materials, because of his expertise in organofluorine chemistry. Miller and his team developed several novel non-reactive chlorofluorocarbon polymers that were used in this application.|$|E
5|$|The Do 17F-1 was a {{long-range}} reconnaissance aircraft based on field modified Do 17Es. The Do 17 prototype V8 {{was used to}} test the configuration of the F-1 and V11 for the F-2. The defensive armament consisted of a MG 15 in the B- and C-Stand (B-Stand - an upper rear firing position, C-Stand — lower gun emplacement). The fuselage had two cameras along with six ejector tubes for flashlight cartridges. The F-1 would see service until replaced by the Do 17 P in 1938. Only one F-2 was ever <b>built,</b> <b>it</b> was designated D-ACZJ and was used by Zeiss-Jena Company as a factory aircraft.|$|E
50|$|Near {{the end of}} 1830, the Amawalk meeting house burned. This {{time the}} damage was complete. The {{following}} year the current meeting house was <b>built.</b> <b>Its</b> construction costs came in slightly over the budgeted $1,250 ($ in modern dollars).|$|R
50|$|Built for the LNER in 1937, and the 100th Gresley Pacific <b>built.</b> <b>Its</b> Doncaster Works {{number was}} 1863. It was {{originally}} numbered 4498. It is a 4-6-2 locomotive {{to the same}} design by Sir Nigel Gresley as the more famous Mallard.|$|R
50|$|The First Congregational Church of Barnet {{was created}} by Reverend David Sutherland in September 1829 after a new brick church had been <b>built.</b> <b>Its</b> first {{permanent}} minister was the Reverend Henry Fairbanks. The church which stands now was constructed in 1854.|$|R
