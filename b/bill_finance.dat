40|$|This paper {{presents}} a formal methodology, using a market-based risk neutral approach, {{to gauge the}} credit risk of guarantee issues in a Taiwanese <b>bills</b> <b>finance</b> company. In particular, the probability of default is endogenously determined. Evidence shows that the recovery rate {{plays an important role}} in credit risk of a <b>bills</b> <b>finance</b> company's guarantee issues. On the other hand, credit risk is also correlated with different industries and business cycles, and care must be taken to consider these factors. Faced with the implementation of the Basel Capital Accord, it is anticipated that this paper will be helpful to Taiwan's financial institutions. ...|$|R

50|$|In December 1999, the KMT {{began to}} attack Soong's integrity.

Soong defended himself by saying he was acting under Lee's direction, but his story was largely unpersuasive. Initially holding a commanding lead in the polls, Soong lost by just over 300,000 votes, and the financial scandal that tarnished his image as a clean politician likely led to this outcome.|$|R

This study further adopted Chi square test to examine the representativeness of the samples. The test p value was > 0.05 at 0.106, indicating that no significant differences existed between these two groups (population and the returned valid samples), and existed sufficient sample sizes to achieve adequate representation.|$|R
