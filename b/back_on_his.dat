5|$|Forty {{days before}} the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, while {{training}} in Debre Zeit, Abebe began to feel pain.

5|$|David Bell, the Home Office negotiator, kept contradicting himself, {{as if in}} a bid {{to prolong}} the negotiations. He would agree to our terms, then he would try and tell us it was out of his hands, and go <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> word. If it was out of the Home Officer's hands—then whose hands was it in? I think the final stages were messed around by the Home Office so that our protest could help to divert the public's {{attention}} from the Poll Tax revolt that was going on throughout the country. As Alan Lord was snatched after being asked to negotiate on behalf of us all, this made us all more defiant about ending the protest.|$|E
5|$|Israel is a 58-year-old New Yorker {{who decided}} he couldn't be gay and Orthodox, {{and turned his}} <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> religion, though not before his family forced him into {{electroshock}} therapy to try to cure him. Now a tour guide in the Haredi neighborhoods of New York, the film follows him as he gives a tour, psychoanalyzes himself and decides, on the 25th anniversary of being with his life partner, to call his 98-year-old father, a rabbi, whom he has not seen in over twenty years.|$|E
5|$|Moe's idea {{involved}} {{setting his}} bar on fire, which {{he ends up}} doing by accident as he realizes Renee has left. Meanwhile, Homer escapes jail by attacking Hans Moleman, who was delivering books to the inmates. He enters the burning bar to confront Moe, and the two start fighting. They are both soon rendered unconscious from smoke inhalation, but Barney appears and rescues them. The bar is completely destroyed, and during their reconciliation Homer promises to help Moe get <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> feet.

5|$|Springfield {{starts to}} harass and hate all immigrants. At the Kwik-E-Mart, Apu confides in Homer {{that he is}} an illegal immigrant. Apu {{explains}} that if Proposition 24 passes, he will have to leave the United States, as his visa expired many years earlier. Apu is forced to go to Fat Tony to obtain a false United States citizenship. However, feeling guilty and embarrassed about taking the fraudulent route, he realizes he has disgraced his parents by turning his <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> Indian heritage, and tears up the fake passport.|$|E
5|$|The NS-10 {{displaced}} the Auratone 5C Sound Cube as the nearfield monitor {{of choice}} in the 1980s and was recognised {{for its ability to}} reveal shortcomings in recordings. It probably first reached American shores through a recording engineer's visit to Japan. The engineer, likely to have been Greg Ladanyi, monitored a recording session through the speaker in a Japanese studio and brought a pair <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> return to the US. Ladanyi then began using the speakers in a Los Angeles studio. Other engineers heard the NS-10 {{for the first time and}} were impressed by its sound. Its use spread to New York where the NS-10 was adopted at The Power Station and other studios.|$|E
5|$|The {{third section}} {{discusses}} {{the rulers of}} secular society and their flaws. The fourth, which is a formal section, deploys a series of Baroque paradoxes {{in the context of}} the Good Friday mass. This past manner is regarded ironically by the poet in the fifth section as he looks <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> period of experimentation in 'the years of l'entre deux guerres as 'largely wasted'. He welcomes approaching old age as a new opportunity to find renewal, although it might only be a rediscovery of 'what has been lost and found and lost again'.|$|E

5|$|As {{the race}} reached the lower slopes of Ventoux, Simpsons's team {{mechanic}} Harry Hall, witnessed Simpson, still ill, putting the lid <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> water bottle as he exited a building. Race commissaire (official), Jacques Lohmuller, later confirmed to Hall {{that he also}} saw the incident and that Simpson was putting brandy in his bottle. As the race closed in on the summit of Ventoux, the peloton began to fracture, and for a while, Simpson managed {{to stay in the}} front group of elite riders. He then slipped back to a group of chasers around one minute behind before he began to lose control of his bike and zig-zag across the road. His team manager, Alec Taylor, feared for Simpson less for the way he was going up the mountain than for the way he would go down the other side.|$|E
5|$|As the two champions {{appeared}} {{they were}} greeted by a frenzy of excitement and everyone was on their feet to acclaim the two heroes. It was difficult to recognise them. Garin was first, followed by the mud-soaked figure of Cordang. Suddenly, to the stupefaction of everyone, Cordang slipped and fell on the velodrome's cement surface. Garin could not believe his luck. By the time Cordang was <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> bike, he had lost 100 metres. There remained six laps to cover. Two miserable kilometres in which to catch Garin. The crowd held its breath as they watched the incredible pursuit match. The bell rang out. One lap, there remained one lap. 333 metres for Garin, who had a lead of 30 metres on the Batave.|$|E
5|$|Chris becomes {{frustrated}} with Aidan {{when he does}} not confide in him about his feelings or accept help from him. When Aidan goes <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> promise to be more open and honest, Chris breaks up with him. Chris suffers a flashback to the crash and damages a Lassiter's car. Ralphie Mahone (Daniel Bowden) fixes the car and in return, he asks Chris to rework some vehicles for him. Chris comes clean to Lucas, who calls the police. Ralphie threatens Chris, but Mason Turner (Taylor Glockner) intervenes and gets rid of Ralphie. Georgia Brooks's boyfriend, Scotty, makes sexual advances towards Chris. When Georgia finds out, she starts avoiding Chris, but they later make up. Chris befriends Amber Turner (Jenna Rosenow) when he sees she is being bullied.

5|$|Eberardo Pavesi {{dominated}} the difficult ninth stage that contained the major climbs of the Nava, Tenda, and San Bartolomeo. Pavesi {{went on to}} win the stage by close to six minutes over the second-place finisher Luigi Ganna. The race's tenth and final stage was marred by rain. Race leader Carlo Galetti crashed into a hay wagon early on in the stage and sustained some heavy wounds, he would get <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> bike and finish the stage in fifth place. Despite the rain in Milan, many spectators still came to watch the riders arrive. Luigi Ganna was the first rider to cross the finish line in Milan and in doing so, he won his third stage of the 1910 Giro d'Italia. Carlo Galetti won the Giro d'Italia by a margin of eighteen points over Pavesi. Galetti and his team, Atala-Continental, won the team classification.|$|E
5|$|Homer buys {{a matter}} {{transporter}} from Professor Frink. That night, Bart, after experimentations involving the family pets, {{steps into the}} teleporter with a fly on his arm, thinking that he will become a mutant superhero. He comes out with his normal head, but with the fly's body whilst the fly has his body. Bart enlists the help of Lisa. However, she is chased by the fly and cornered in the kitchen. Bart tries to stop the fighting, but is quickly eaten by the fly. Lisa then sees {{this as an opportunity}} to undo the process and pushes the fly into the teleporter. Bart comes out the other end, now with his head <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> real body. Homer then pulls out an axe and angrily chases Bart for using the device.|$|E
5|$|Neglected in her {{relationship}} with the once-human Manhattan, whose now-godlike powers and transformation have removed him completely from the everyday concerns of living beings and no longer kept on retainer by the government, Juspeczyk stays with Dreiberg; they begin a romance, don their costumes, and resume vigilante work as they grow closer together. With Dreiberg starting to believe some aspects of Rorschach's conspiracy theory, the pair take {{it upon themselves to}} break him out of prison. Manhattan, after looking <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> own personal history, places the fate of his involvement with human affairs in Juspeczyk's hands. He teleports her to Mars {{to make the case for}} emotional investment. During the course of the argument, Juspeczyk is forced to come to terms with the fact that Blake, who once attempted to rape her mother, was in fact her biological father following a second, consensual relationship. This discovery, reflecting the complexity of human emotions and relationships, re-sparks Manhattan's interest in humanity.|$|E

5|$|Pineda {{finished}} the 2011 {{season with a}} 9–10 record and a 3.74 ERA. He recorded no wins in his final seven starts {{over the last two}} months of the year, and the Mariners cut <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> work load as a precaution against an arm injury. In 28 starts, he struck out 173 hitters while walking just 55 over 171 innings. Pineda struck out 24.9% of all batters faced, which was the third highest strikeout percentage in MLB. He also finished fifth in voting for American League Rookie of the Year Award, behind Jeremy Hellickson, Mark Trumbo, Eric Hosmer, and Iván Nova, and ahead of teammate Dustin Ackley, who finished sixth. After the season, Keith Law ranked Pineda as the 20th best player under the age of 25.|$|E
5|$|The {{themes of}} Reflections {{are similar to}} those of The Eolian Harp. They are set in the same location, and both {{describe}} Coleridge's relationship with his wife and sexual desire. The reflection on his life within the poem represent an unwillingness to accept his current idyllic life and a rejection of the conclusion drawn in The Eolian Harp. Although the land of Clevedon can bring one closer to God in Coleridge's view, he reflects on how one cannot simply exist in such an area but must actively seek out truth in order to fulfill God's will. The poem details how men feel a need to seek truth like a philosopher while also desiring to simply live in an idyllic natural state. The poem reconciles these desires by claiming that the pursuer of truth can still reflect <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> time when he was simply enjoying nature and God's presence.|$|E
5|$|Websites such as Equestria Daily and Ponychan {{were created}} for fans to share artwork, stories, music, and {{news about the}} show. Founded in January 2011, Equestria Daily had over 36 million pageviews in its first 9 months, and has since surpassed 500 million views (June 2014). The blog, which {{receives}} more than 175,000 visits a day and is fully funded by advertising revenue, was established by 23-year-old college student Shaun Scotellaro {{for the purpose of}} collecting fan fiction and news specific to Friendship Is Magic. Shaun eventually cut <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> community college classes in order to continue running the site out of his parents' house in Glendale, Arizona, when it grew in popularity. He believed the show needed a unified fan base at the time, as there existed an overarching concern that Hasbro would not be authorizing a second season.|$|E
