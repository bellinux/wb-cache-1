In this paper we analyze the competition of <b>biomass</b> <b>sources</b> and changes in management of woody resources induced by the joint expansion of the bioenergy sector and forest industries.

40|$|International Energy Workshop : [URL] audienceIn {{the context}} of {{mitigating}} climate change and increase energy security, the utilization of biomass in the energy sector is expected {{to play a major}} role. However, to estimate the possibility of fulfilling national goals concerning the future use of <b>biomass</b> <b>sources</b> and to estimate the future use of <b>biomass</b> <b>sources</b> in the energy sector, the current energy system models needs to be further developed to consider the high sub-national variances in the supply and cost of the <b>biomass</b> <b>sources.</b> In this paper we present a sub-national MARKAL/TIMES model for estimating regional utilization of <b>biomass</b> <b>sources</b> and the future development of the energy system. The proposed model is evaluated for two case studies, France and Sweden, for which the future utilization of biomass is evaluated utilizing numerous scenarios of the potential supply of biomass, cost of biomass, and end-use demand. Our results show that the limit of national biomass potentials for energy purposes in France is approximately 35 Mtoe, while all demand scenarios for Sweden could be fulfilled by national biomass potentials. Furthermore, the results show that there are large differences in the regional utilization level of <b>biomass</b> <b>sources,</b> even when the total utilization level of <b>biomass</b> <b>sources</b> is high...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to improve evaluations of the future use of <b>biomass</b> <b>sources</b> in Sweden and France by representing the high spatial variations of the supply and cost of <b>biomass</b> <b>sources</b> in energy system models. The proposed methodology considers a high spatial disaggregation of <b>biomass</b> supply <b>sources,</b> as well as detailed biomass cost-supply curves, and is thereby able to account for spatial differences in heterogeneous land qualities, management strategies, and possible adaptation rates. Integrating the methodology into national or regional energy system models will enhance cost-effective evaluations of <b>biomass</b> <b>sources</b> as well as the development of the bioenergy sector. A TIMES energy system model was used to evaluate bioenergy production potential for France and Sweden based on domestic <b>biomass</b> <b>sources</b> and under the assumption that bioenergy production should not be at the expense of domestic food and forestry supply. Results show that by 2050, the <b>biomass</b> <b>sources</b> considered could provide as much as 250 PJ of bioenergy in Sweden, and 1470 PJ of bioenergy in France. Results further showed that 1 st generation biofuels are likely to continue to play a substantial role in the biofuel mix. While 2 nd generation biofuel production in Sweden is likely to be low, larger amounts of 2 nd generation biofuels could be produced in France. However, the amount and type of 2 nd generation biofuel produced in France was found to be highly dependent on the bioenergy demand level...|$|R
40|$|What is {{the best}} <b>biomass</b> <b>source</b> and {{conversion}} process to create the biofuels to power our country in the future? Specifically, is cellulosic ethanol capable of becoming a viable biofuel?

(2) How do we design and implement a comprehensive stream application, like DAC, from many divergent stream analytic PEs? (3) How do we deploy DAC in light of <b>source</b> <b>streams</b> with extremely different rates?

This paper introduces diversity embedded streaming erasure codes (DE-SCo), that provide a flexible tradeoff between the channel quality and receiver delay.

40|$|Abstract: With {{the rapid}} {{industrial}} growth, {{the need for}} renewable energy sources is rising fast. Being a developing country, Bangladesh aims towards industrial expansion, which is always followed by increased energy consumption. Considering the fact that fossil fuel is not sustainable and <b>biomass</b> <b>sources</b> are abundant and offer more versatility, the latter have become an attractive alternative to petroleum-based products. Moreover, utilization of biomass also seems promising because of biodegradability and lower greenhouse gas emissions, ensuring reduced environmental pollution, a grave concern with fossil-fuel technology. Biomass can range from agricultural byproducts to industrial and municipal wastes, however, very few <b>biomass</b> <b>sources</b> are currently being used in Bangladesh. Moreover, biomass {{can also be utilized}} to derive valuable chemicals, which are potential raw materials in several existing industries in Bangladesh. Despite having massive potential in Bangladesh, there haven't been organized studies on feedstock types, quantities, characterization and applications. Here we present an organized study to identify potential <b>biomass</b> <b>sources</b> and their available quantities. Considering specific waste fractions from varying sources, total amount of utilizable biomass resources have been calculated.
