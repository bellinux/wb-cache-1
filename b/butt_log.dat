Four <b>butt</b> <b>logs</b> and four upper logs {{for each of the}} three existing diameter grades were selected and sawed. The wood pieces were analyzed after sawing and after kiln drying. The presence of knots, which occurred due to the absence of forest management and influenced the qualitative classification of the wood pieces, was observed mainly in the samples from upper logs.

This study first presents the maps of average stiffness, average strength and average warp in radiata pine structural timber, obtained from sixty-two 27 -year old, unpruned radiata pine trees. From these maps, one can conclude that the <b>butt</b> <b>logs</b> are problem <b>logs,</b> because the <b>butt</b> <b>logs</b> displayed the lowest stiffness, as well as the maximum bow and spring within the stems. The stiffness and strength distributions were compared with the typical distribution of wood density, which reveals that the wood density alone does not reflect the mechanical properties of radiata pine structural timber, because: 1) the denser <b>butt</b> <b>logs</b> exhibited the lowest stiffness among all log types; 2) the <b>butt</b> <b>logs</b> were not the strongest logs compared with other log types. Knots are found to be the most important factor weakening the mechanical properties and causing extra distortion in structural timber. 99 % of the boards broke at a knot that is associated also with lower local stiffness. 70 % of maximum bows and 40 % of maximum springs occurred off the expected mid-span, which may be attributed to the deflections introduced by larger margin and edge knots. In order to estimate the failure strength non-destructively, this study examined the failure features of the weakest point in detail, including the local stiffness at the failure zone, the failure pattern of knots and the failure frequency in relation to growth and features of knots.

Because the random occurrence of resin pockets can confound results, basic data used in this paper are from grades produced when resin pockets were ignored. Results showed the production of clearwood and values and grades realised from pruned <b>butt</b> <b>logs</b> are determined by three major factors: log size, defect core size, and log conversion percentage. A Grade Index has been derived in which the relationship of these factors is expressed as: dbh x log conversion Grade Index =. defect core Data from the 3 studies were combined in a Grade Index Model which defines a pruned log value gradient, the expected outturn in clears, and gives an approximation of the proportions in other grades. Results from an independent fourth sample of 12 logs were used to validate the Grade Index Model. Because the Grade Index is an expression of the quality of pruned <b>butt</b> <b>logs</b> which may be used either predictively or reflectively, applications to stand planning, evaluations of silvicultural regimes, and evaluations of existing pruned stands are proposed.

40|$|A New Zealand {{stand of}} Eucalyptus nitens (Deane & Maiden) Maiden was pruned up to height 8 m and grown for 15 years at low {{stocking}} to 57 cm diameter at breast height. This stand provided 15 trees, preselected {{for a range}} of wood density. Lumber and veneer were cut from the 5 -m <b>butt</b> <b>logs,</b> veneer was peeled from the second logs from height 7 to 13 m, and each tree was evaluated for production of appearance-grade lumber and rotary-peeled veneer. Butt-log quality was good as pruning had effectively restricted the knotty core, and there was little decay from branches in either <b>butt</b> <b>logs</b> or veneer billets. Longitudinal growth stresses varied widely among trees, resulting in log end-splitting and sawlog flitch movement during sawing (spring), which led to crook in sawn timber, substantially reducing timber conversion in some trees. Collapse and internal checking were prevalent in air-dried lumber, and numbers of checks varied widely among trees. Face-checking was found in boards from all trees after kiln-drying and reconditioning, and even those with very few face checks had internal checks. Veneer thickness varied unacceptably, caused probably by incorrect knife- and pressure-bar settings. Veneer splitting also varied among trees, and was worse in butt-log than in second-log veneers. Unsatisfactory pre-heating of billets before peeling may have exacerbated splitting. Knots severely downgraded structural plywood veneer grades, < 8 % of sheets from the second logs being acceptable compared with 87 % of sheets from the pruned <b>butt</b> <b>logs.</b> Stiffness of veneer sheets was successfully measured using a sonic device (Pundit™) to sort veneers for manufacture of laminated veneer lumber...|$|R

40|$|Frequency and Character of Knots in Triangular Profiles of Pine (Pinus silvestris L) and Spruce (Picea abies Karst). by Hans Holmberg Dick Sandberg Abstract This report {{describes}} {{the structure and}} amount of knots in triangular profiles from StarSawing of pine (Pinus silvestris L) and spruce (Picea abies Karst). The yield of blanks is determined mainly with a defined knot structure and the fibre aberration around knots. In addition a minor investigation {{of the amount of}} pitch pockets has been carried out. The specimens comprise of <b>butt</b> <b>logs</b> from three different areas in Sweden. The specimens are taken from normal grown pine, and both normal and fast grown spruce. Large amounts of the knots found in triangular profiles from <b>butt</b> <b>logs</b> are unacceptable for further refinement. Thus, the knots have to be removed. When producing blanks free from knots there is a volume decrease of 8 and 21 percent in average for pine and spruce respectively, referring to the original volume. Further refinement including fibre aberration increases the volume loss by another 5 percent for pine and 6 percent for spruce. The length of the refined blanks varies between 2 and 500 centimetres for pine and between 2 and 400 centimetres for spruce. Measurement results are included in the report for calculating the volume yield of blanks free from knots, with or without fibre aberration.

The yield of kraft pulp from top logs and slabwood was poor in comparison to P. radiata, but the chemical consumption was normal.

The observed differences between the two studies are also {{due to the fact that}} the analysis by Bembenek et al. (2014) did not include the top sections of the stems nor the assortment values (PW and EW), which were correlated with the stand density in a different way than in the case of the assortments from the lower sections of the stems (Table  3).|$|R
40|$|Trees {{monitored}} for bark stripping {{over the}} previous 20 years were examined for timber defects by felling, then observing stain and rot in the split <b>butt</b> <b>logs</b> and strength testing wood samples. Logs (52 bark stripped, 28 controls) came from eight sites that had tree crops 28 – 39 years old; the logs were stratified for wound size (180 cm 2), large wounds being rare. Many wounded logs had no stain or rot, but six of the 33 better-quality sawlogs were judged to be usable only for pulp. Modulus of elasticity and modulus of rupture were affected only at wounds and only in the sapwood there; at this position, mean stiffness and strength were both significantly reduced compared with control logs, with lowest means for logs with large wounds. Large wounds suffered a much greater incidence of stain and rot than small wounds, but their rarity meant that the calculated financial loss caused by the bark stripping estimated to be incurred over the whole rotation up to felling was only 3 per cent of the crop value. ...|$|R
