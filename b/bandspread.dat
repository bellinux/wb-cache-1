2500|$|In July 1940, the Hallicrafters Company {{announced}} the SX-28 [...] "Super Skyrider", {{the result of}} a development effort by 12 staff engineers and analysis of more than 600 reports that included input from U.S. government engineers, commercial users, and amateur radio operators. The SX-28's distinctive art deco styling was considered sleek and strikingly modern in 1940. The radio frequency coverage was 550kHz (0.55MHz) to 43 MHz in six bands. The SX-28 included an Amplified AVC, a Lamb Noise Silencer, Calibrated <b>bandspread,</b> and Push-Pull audio output. The SX-28 was known for its [...] "high fidelity" [...] audio together with high sensitivity, stability and selectivity, and good purchase value.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bandspread</b> {{controls}} {{were found on}} communications receivers, amateur radio receivers, and some broadcast receivers. With the advent of digital frequency synthesizers that could be set with high resolution by a keypad or incremental tuning knob, the requirement for <b>bandspread</b> control in many applications was eliminated.|$|E
5000|$|In a radio receiver, a <b>bandspread</b> {{control is}} a {{secondary}} tuning control that allows accurate tuning of closely spaced frequencies of a radio band. With a main tuning control that covered {{a wide range of}} frequencies, for example 10-14 megahertz in a few turns of the tuning knob, a very small motion might change the tuning by tens of kilohertz and would make accurate tuning to any particular frequency difficult. A calibrated <b>bandspread</b> tuning control allows the main tuning to be set to a predefined spot on the control, and the <b>bandspread</b> allows tuning of a particular frequency within some restricted range of the main tuning control.|$|E
40|$|Absh. act- This paper {{evaluates the}} {{performance}} of a packet radio network employing Code Division Multiple Access and a Stack Algorithm to resolve message collisions. We investigate the effects of <b>bandspreading</b> assuming a fixed total system bandwidth. Although <b>bandspreading</b> with perfectly orthogonal signals enhances system capacity, it does not resolve the instability of ALOHA random access unless special measures are taken to control retransmission traffic. Using a Stack Algorithm, at small traffic loads the packet delay is minimized if no spreading is applied. At large traffic loads, perfect CDMA enhances performance, but for imperfect signal separation at the receiver, advantages of CDMA are lost. The capacity of the Stack Algorithm addressed here can be enhanced from 0. 32 to at least 0. 40 if a large spreading factor with perfect signal separation is employe...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the on going NASA/Harris FHSC CODEC program. The program objectives are {{to design and}} build an encoder decoder that allows operation in either burst or continuous modes at data rates of up to 300 megabits per second. The decoder handles both hard and soft decision decoding and can switch between modes on a burst by burst basis. <b>Bandspreading</b> is low since the code rate is {{greater than or equal}} to 7 / 8. The encoder and a hard decision decoder fit on a single application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chip. A soft decision applique is implemented using 300 K ECL logic which can be easily translated to an ECL gate array...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{describe}} an error-correction coding approach that allows operation in either burst or continuous modes at data rates of multiple hundreds of megabits per second. <b>Bandspreading</b> is low since the code rate is 7 / 8 or greater, {{which is consistent}} with high-rate link operation. The encoder, along with a hard-decision decoder, fits on a single application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chip. Soft-decision decoding is possible utilizing applique hardware in conjunction with the hard-decision decoder. Expected coding gain {{is a function of the}} application and is approximately 2. 5 dB for hard-decision decoding at 10 - 5 bit-error rate with phase-shift-keying modulation and additive Gaussian white noise interference. The principal use envisioned for this technique is to achieve a modest amount of coding gain on high-data-rate, bandwidth-constrained channels. Data rates of up to 300 Mb/s can be accommodated by the codec chip. The major objective is burst-mode communications, where code words are composed of 32 n data bits followed by 32 overhead bits...|$|R
5000|$|One {{method of}} adding a <b>bandspread</b> control {{was to put}} a {{relatively}} small value variable tuning capacitor and dial directly in parallel with the main tuning variable capacitor ( [...] or connected to a tap on the coil of the tuned circuit). The smaller capacitor would have much less effect on the resonant frequency than the main capacitor, allowing fine discrimination of the tuned frequency. A second method, mechanical <b>bandspread,</b> was a second tuning knob connected through a gear train to the main tuning knob; each turn of the <b>bandspread</b> dial moved the main dial through {{a small part of}} its range, improving the precision of tuning.|$|E

40|$|Miniaturization {{of liquid}} chromatography, {{capillary}} HPLC, has {{made possible the}} separation of samples with volumes in the low microliter to nanoliter range. Downsizing separation column requires more sensitive detection method. Biuret-based electrochemistry {{has proven to be}} effective in peptide detection, but work {{needs to be done to}} make it feasible in capillary separation system. This thesis presents modifications of a standard electrochemical detector with dual working electrodes, which decreases <b>bandspreading</b> into the nL range suitable for capillary HPLC. This miniaturized detector has detection limit of 3 nM (6 fmol) for peptides on the upstream anode. The downstream cathode has high selectivity by applying reductive potential. The common carbon working electrode can be replaced with gold electrodes with a self-assembled naphthalenethiol monolayer, which suppresses the background current from Au while giving detectable current from Cu-peptide redox reaction. When the modified Au electrode is assembled to a flow cell for peptide detection, it gives stable current response and the sensitivity is comparable to a glassy carbon electrode. These advances will permit non-electrochemists to determine peptides by capillary HPLC quantitatively, and open the way for chip-based detectors...|$|R
5000|$|Model S-85 (1954-5), general {{coverage}} (560 kHz-30 MHz/4 bands), single conversion), amateur <b>bandspread</b> (10-80m), dual tuning dials, RF {{and audio}} gain controls, {{beat frequency oscillator}} (controllable frequency), transmit/receive switch, sold for $119.95 at Sears, Roebuck and Co.|$|E
50|$|The {{front panel}} {{controls}} are typically more comprehensive {{than those on}} a broadcasting receiver. Usual features include: signal strength meter; RF gain control; AVC/AGC adjustments; band switching or preselector switching; selectable bandwidth filters; BFO tuning; and audio limiters or attenuators. Precise, calibrated, analog tuning and display dials are used, with a separate <b>bandspread</b> control to allow selective tuning of signals close in frequency. In more recent units, electronic digital frequency displays are provided. In communication receivers, the decorative wooden cabinets typical of early broadcast receivers were replaced with utilitarian metal cabinets to provide electromagnetic shielding and mechanical ruggedness.|$|E
5000|$|The {{two most}} {{distinctive}} {{features of this}} radio were its use of a micrometer-type dial, and plug-in sets of tuning coils that slid into a full-width opening {{at the bottom of}} the front panel. The dial, designed by Willam Graydon Smith, allowed for continuous analog tuning while digitally indicating incremental progress over a range of ten full turns of the large tuning knob that tuned with velvet smoothness. Ten times the circumference of the dial is 12 feet (nearly 4 m), which allowed for great frequency resolution. The four standard sets of coils, A, B, C, and D, covered 14-30, 7-14.4, 3.5-7.3, and 1.7-4 MHz, respectively. Two other sets of coils, E and F, sold separately, covered 960-2050 kHz and 480-960 kHz, respectively. Before each radio left the factory, a technician custom calibrated a set of A, B, C, and D coils for that particular radio, a process that took nearly 4 hours. [...] Each of the four main sets of coils also had <b>bandspread</b> modes set by moving screws that limited the frequency range to 28-29.7, 14-14.4, 7-7.3, 3.5-4 MHz, respectively, for amateur radio use.|$|E

The SX-28 saw use by various branches of U.S. and allied military and signals intelligence agencies during World War II. SX-28 and Hallicrafters S-27 and S-36 receivers were often rack mounted in British government listening posts and secret listening stations for monitoring German radar and communications during the war such as Beaumanor Hall in the English Midlands where German and Italian encrypted radio messages were sent to Bletchley Park for decoding. A number of the receivers were sent to Russia {{as a part of the}} Lend Lease Act, subsequently modified to accommodate Russian tubes.|$|E
40|$|An {{analysis}} is given {{of the effect}} of carrier spectral width on bandwidth of optical fibre transmission lines and a simple generalized expression is deduced relating carrier <b>bandspread</b> and maximum permissible pulse rate. It is shown that for the case of a semiconductor laser carrier source the bandwidth of a multimode fibre can be made to approach that expected from single-mode and graded-index fibres...|$|E
40|$|Spread {{spectrum}} (SS) is a {{modulation technique}} {{in which the}} signal occupies a bandwidth {{much larger than the}} minimum necessary to send the information. A synchronized reception with the code at the receiver is used for despreading the information before data recovery. <b>Bandspread</b> is accomplished by means of a code which is independent of the data. Bandspreading code is pseudo-random, thus the spread signal resembles noise. The coded modulation characteristic of SS system uniquely qualifies it for navigation applications. Any signal used in ranging is subject to time/distance relations. A SS signal has advantage that its phase is easily resolvable. Direct-sequence (DS) form of modulation is mostly preferred over Frequency Hopping system (FH) as FH systems do not normally possess high resolution properties. Higher the chip rate, the better the measurement capability. The basic resolution is one code chip. Initially, some existing code families e. g. Gold, Kasami (large and smal [...] ...|$|E
