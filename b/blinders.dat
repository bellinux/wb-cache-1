5000|$|Economist Rob Johnson, {{who watched}} the <b>Blinder</b> ordeal, says <b>Blinder</b> {{made the mistake of}} {{behaving}} as if the Fed was a place where competing ideas and assumptions were debated. [...] "Sociologically, what was happening was the Fed staff was really afraid of <b>Blinder.</b> At some level, as an applied empirical economist, Alan <b>Blinder</b> is really brilliant," [...] says Johnson.In closed-door meetings, <b>Blinder</b> did what so few do: he challenged assumptions. [...] "The Fed staff would come out and their ritual is: Greenspan has kind of told them what to conclude and they produce studies in which they conclude this. And <b>Blinder</b> treated it more like an open academic debate when he first got there and he'd come out and say, 'Well, that's not true. If you change this assumption and change this assumption and use this kind of assumption you get a completely different result.' And it just created a stir inside - {{it was sort of like}} the whole pipeline of Greenspan-arriving-at-decisions was disrupted."This put him in conflict with Greenspan and his staff. [...] "A lot of senior staff... were pissed off about <b>Blinder</b> - how should we say? - not playing by the customs that they were accustomed to," [...] Johnson says.|$|R

25|$|During the {{majority}} of the year caribou roam the tundra in small herds, but twice a year large herds of caribou cross the inland regions. Caribou have excellent senses of smell and hearing so that the hunters must be very careful when in pursuit. Often, Inuit hunters set up camp miles away from the caribou crossing and wait until they are in full view to attack. There are many ways in which the caribou can be captured, including spearing, forcing caribou into the river, using <b>blinders,</b> scaring the caribou, and stalking the caribou. When spearing caribou, hunters put the string of the spear in their mouths and the other end they use to gently spear the animal.|$|E

500|$|According to Russell Kirk, [...] "Nor is it {{possible}} to appreciate Eliotwhether or not one agrees with himif one comes to Four Quartets with ideological <b>blinders.</b> Ideology, it must be remembered, is the attempt to supplant religious dogmas by political and scientistic dogmas. If one's first premise is that religion must be a snare and a delusion, for instance, then it follows that Eliot becomes an enemy to be assaulted, rather than a pilgrim whose journal one may admire-even if one does not believe in the goal of that quest." ...|$|E
