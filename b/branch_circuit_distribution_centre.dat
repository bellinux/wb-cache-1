40|$|We {{show how}} an {{adaptive}} control algorithm {{can improve the}} performance of distributed reactive power control in a radial <b>distribution</b> <b>circuit</b> with a high penetration of photovoltaic (PV) cells. The adaptive algorithm is designed to balance the need for power quality (voltage regulation) {{with the desire to}} minimize power loss. The adaptation law determines whether the objective function minimizes power losses or voltage regulation based on whether the voltage at each node remains close enough to the voltage at the substation. The reactive power is controlled through the inverter on the PV cells. The control signals are determined based on local instantaneous measurements of the real and reactive power at each node. We use the example of a single <b>branch</b> radial <b>distribution</b> <b>circuit</b> to demonstrate the ability of the adaptive scheme to effectively reduce voltage variations while simultaneously minimizing the power loss in the studied cases. Simulations verify that the adaptive schemes compares favorably with local and global schemes previously reported in the literature...|$|R
40|$|The {{addition}} of renewable generation, such as PV's, throughout a <b>distribution</b> <b>circuit,</b> create significant unprecedented {{challenges for the}} electric grid. The real power injections to the system can cause problems such as loss of proper voltage regulation when the PV penetration level gets high enough. Moreover, the uncertainty and rapid fluctuation of renewable power generators, such as PV's requires the design of more advanced VAR control schemes on a fast timescale. This paper presents a model that employs the storage device (battery) in the optimal power flow equations with global and local dynamic VAR controls algorithms. The reactive power is controlled through the inverter on the PV cells. The control signals are determined based on local instantaneous measurements of the real and reactive power at each node. We use {{the example of a}} single <b>branch</b> radial <b>distribution</b> <b>circuit</b> to demonstrate the ability of both the global and local dynamic VAR control schemes to effectively reduce voltage variations while simultaneously minimizing the total power loss in the studied cases.
