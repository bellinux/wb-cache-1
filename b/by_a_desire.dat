5|$|Despite his pessimism {{expressed}} to the Dutch {{government and the}} mandate {{he had been given}} to surrender the Army, General Winkelman awaited the outcome of events, avoiding actually capitulating until it was absolutely necessary. In this he was perhaps motivated <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> to engage the opposing German troops for as long as possible, to assist the Allied war effort. In the early morning of 14 May, though the situation remained critical, a certain calm was evident in the Dutch Headquarters.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{restoration}} of the veneration of icons in March 843, the Byzantine Empire's government, headed by the Empress-regent Theodora and the logothetes Theoktistos, embarked on a sustained assault on the Byzantines' main political and ideological foe, the Abbasid Caliphate and its dependencies. This aggressive stance was on the one hand facilitated by the internal stability {{that the end of the}} Iconoclasm controversy brought, and on the other encouraged <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> to vindicate the new policy through military victories against the Muslims.|$|E

5|$|Among the downsides {{to rapid}} {{industrialization}} was pollution. Brick firing produced {{particulate air pollution}} and paint-making created lead dust, while beer and liquor brewing produced grain swill. The worst pollution was coal dust and smoke, for which St. Louis was infamous by the 1890s. The greatest number of complaints to the St. Louis Board of Health were due to industries engaged in rendering, which produced noxious fumes. In spite of this, pollution control was hindered <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> to promote growth. One of the few controls began in 1880, in which regulations would be enforced strictly in some areas while little in others, thereby encouraging factories to concentrate in industrial districts.|$|E

5|$|Boyer {{observes the}} {{distinction}} between how nonhuman animals can receive political protection {{as individuals and as}} species. He argues that the latter form of protection is motivated <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> to preserve human experience of the species rather than the experiences of the nonhuman animals themselves. Politically motivated species advocacy, Boyer argues, is highly anthropocentric, as advocates present these animals as sharing in particular revered virtues; as a result, the likes of habitat and genetic health are the focus of advocates, rather than the nonhuman animals themselves. Using the example of polar bear preservation, Boyer illustrates how species advocacy becomes tied up with broader political goals concerning humans and competing visions of the value of animals. He concludes that the advancement of species advocacy can limit the achievement of animal welfare/rights goals.|$|E
5|$|From the age {{of about}} twelve until he was seventeen, Newton was educated at The King's School, Grantham, which taught Latin and Greek and {{probably}} imparted a significant foundation of mathematics. He was removed from school, and by October 1659, {{he was to be}} found at Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth, where his mother, widowed for a second time, attempted to make a farmer of him. Newton hated farming. Henry Stokes, master at the King's School, persuaded his mother to send him back to school so that he might complete his education. Motivated partly <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> for revenge against a schoolyard bully, he became the top-ranked student, distinguishing himself mainly by building sundials and models of windmills.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, AR. Drone is flown {{autonomously}} {{from the initial}} position (x,y,z) to the desired position called waypoint (xdes,ydes,zdes) using Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC). The FLC consists of three control loops which are pitch control loop, roll control loop and vertical rate control loop. Pitch control loop is used to control the x-position of the AR. Drone; the inputs are the desired x-position and current value of x-position, while its output is the pitch. Roll control loop is used to control the y-position of the AR. Drone; the inputs are the desired y-position and current value of y-position, while its output is the roll. Vertical rate control loop is used to control the z-position of the AR. Drone; the inputs are the desired z-position and current value of z-position and its output is the vertical rate. The algorithm is realized in three flight schemes and the navigation data is recorded. The first flight scheme: <b>a</b> <b>desired</b> x-position, xdes, of AR. Drone will be reached first followed <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>desired</b> y-position, ydes, and lastly <b>a</b> <b>desired</b> z-position, zdes. The second flight scheme: <b>a</b> <b>desired</b> x-position and y-position, (xdes,ydes), will be reached simultaneously followed <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>desired</b> z-position, zdes. The third flight scheme: AR. Drone flies towards to desired position (xdes,ydes,zdes) simultaneously. The {{results show that the}} AR. Drone can reach the waypoint with the three schemes well. However, the flight scheme straight towards the waypoint with the FLC working simultaneously is the most satisfying one...|$|R
5|$|In {{an effort}} to {{consolidate}} territory under their control, Croatian Serb leaders organised a political rally at the Plitvice Lakes on 25 March 1991, demanding the area be annexed to the SAO Krajina. Three days later, on 28 March, SAO Krajina special police seized the area, {{and with the help}} of armed civilians, removed the Croatian management of the Plitvice Lakes National Park. The force deployed by the SAO Krajina to the Plitvice Lakes was estimated to be approximately 100-strong. The region was relatively sparsely populated and there was no obvious threat to Serbs there. Journalist Tim Judah suggests that the move may have been motivated <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> to control a strategic road that ran north-south through the park, linking the Serb communities in the Lika and Banovina regions.|$|E
5|$|In {{distinguishing}} {{the police}} characters from other television detectives, Simon {{makes the point}} that even the best police of The Wire are motivated not <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> to protect and serve, but by the intellectual vanity of believing they are smarter than the criminals they are chasing. However, while many of the police do exhibit altruistic qualities, many officers portrayed on the show are incompetent, brutal, self-aggrandizing, or hamstrung by bureaucracy and politics. The criminals are not always motivated by profit or a desire to harm others; many are trapped in their existence and all have human qualities. Even so, The Wire does not minimize or gloss over the horrific effects of their actions.|$|E
5|$|Offa {{succeeded in}} having Lichfield {{elevated}} to an archbishopric, but {{the rise in}} Lichfield's status was unpopular with Canterbury, the other southern English archbishopric. Offa was probably motivated <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> to increase the status of his kingdom and to free his kingdom's ecclesiastical affairs from the control of another kingdom's archbishopric, and possibly the need to secure the coronation of Offa's successor, which the Archbishop of Canterbury had opposed. After Offa's death his distant relative Coenwulf became king, and petitioned the pope to have Lichfield returned to a simple bishopric. The pope agreed {{to do so in}} 803, by which time Hygeberht was no longer even considered a bishop: he is listed as an abbot at the council that oversaw the demotion of Lichfield in 803. The date of his death is unknown.|$|E

After Edward's death, however, it emerged that Agnes had {{been responsible for the}} murder of her former, first husband, John Cotell: two of her servants had strangled him at Farleigh Hungerford Castle, before burning his body in the castle oven to destroy any evidence. Agnes appears to have been motivated <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> for the wealth that would follow her second marriage to Sir Edward, but in 1523 Agnes and the two servants were hung for murder in London.|$|E

5|$|Vice-President Millard Fillmore {{ascended to}} the {{presidency}} upon Taylor's death and offered Crittenden the post of Attorney General. Believing the rift in the Whig Party was now much improved, he accepted the offer and resigned the governorship in 1850. Fillmore, an opponent of slavery, requested an opinion from Crittenden on {{the constitutionality of the}} fugitive slave law, one of the bills involved in the Compromise of 1850. Specifically, he asked if the law suspended the writ of habeas corpus. Crittenden said that it did not, opining that it discharged a duty placed on Congress by the Constitution to return runaway slaves. Crittenden's opinion was probably motivated <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> to see the Compromise pass and avert further sectional tension. Fillmore, his misgivings assuaged, signed the bill, keeping the Compromise intact.|$|E

Despite their difficult relationship, David dedicated the book to her mother. Before the book was published, David left England to live {{for a short time}} in France.

50|$|This model {{follows a}} {{functional}} perspective in which behaviors {{are caused by}} the events that immediately precede and follow them. Four types of reinforcement processes can maintain self-injury: intrapersonal negative reinforcement, intrapersonal positive reinforcement, interpersonal positive reinforcement, and interpersonal negative reinforcement. Intrapersonal negative reinforcement refers to self-injury being followed <b>by</b> <b>a</b> decrease or stop of aversive thoughts or feelings. Intrapersonal positive reinforcement involves self-injury being followed <b>by</b> <b>an</b> increase in <b>desired</b> thoughts or feelings such as a feeling of satisfaction. Interpersonal positive reinforcement occurs when self-injury is followed <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>desired</b> social event such as attention or support. Finally, interpersonal negative reinforcement occurs when self-injury is followed <b>by</b> <b>a</b> decrease or stop of a social event. Many studies investigating the motives reported for engaging in self-injury provide evidence for this four-function model.|$|R
