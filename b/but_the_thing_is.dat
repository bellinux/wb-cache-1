500|$|In {{the wake}} of the shooting, Democrats and Republicans both called for a cooling of {{political}} rhetoric and a return to bipartisanship. On the eve of the shooting, Giffords had written to a Republican friend, Trey Grayson, Secretary of State of Kentucky, saying, [...] "we need {{to figure out how to}} tone our rhetoric and partisanship down." [...] In March 2010, Giffords had expressed concern about the use of crosshairs on a national midterm election map on Sarah Palin's campaign webpage denoting targeted congressional seats, including Giffords's, in Arizona's 8th district. Shortly after the map's posting and the subsequent vandalizing of her office that month, Giffords said, [...] "We're in Sarah Palin's 'targeted' list, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> that the way she has it depicted, we're in the crosshairs of a gun sight over our district. When people do that, they've got to realize that there are consequences to that action." [...] At that point in the interview, however, the interviewer said, [...] "campaign rhetoric and war rhetoric have been interchangeable for years." [...] The image was removed from Palin's [...] "takebackthe20" [...] website following the January shootings. Palin responded to her critics in a January 12 video, rejecting the notion that anyone other than the gunman could bear any responsibility for the Tucson shooting, and accusing the press of manufacturing a [...] "blood libel" [...] to blame her and the right wing for the attacks.|$|E
2500|$|On October 8, 2013, Gambino {{released}} a teaser video for the album, which he announced as being titled Because the Internet {{and that it}} would be released in December 2013. Gambino told MTV that singer Beck gave him the idea for the album title. He explained the title, saying: [...] "Because the internet I'm here, because of the internet we're all here. It's the language of earth. Everyone keeps saying by this or that year, Mandarin or Spanish will be the most dominant language, but the internet is already a language we are all connected to; even my dad can understand the meme format. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is,</b> there are no rules, which is also the awesome thing." ...|$|E

6000|$|Lewisham spoke {{like a man}} who is {{lifting a}} weight. [...] "All this, you know, is off the question. I'm not disputing your ability. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> ... it isn't right." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “You {{have done}} so, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> so utterly hateful that it carries its {{refutation}} with it”; {{and there was}} a portentous sparkle in the girl’s eyes as she fixed them upon him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Most of us, I believe, {{have that}} wish, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> often horribly complex," [...] she said. [...] "Anyway, you must put Gregory off again if it's only for another month or two. I fancy {{you will not}} find it remarkably difficult." ...|$|E
6000|$|At that moment--for {{a moment}} only--I almost {{felt as if}} I could have said to Effie, [...] "Take him!" [...] <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> too impossible--a {{something}} within us rises against it--and I said nothing.|$|R
6000|$|I {{will tell}} you a story that I have read of Martha and Mary; the name of the book I have forgot; I mean of the book in which I found <b>the</b> relation; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> thus:-- ...|$|R
60|$|Heyst was disgusted also, but {{in another}} way. He too was incredulous. He regretted having {{mentioned}} <b>the</b> girl; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> done, his repugnance had been overcome {{in the heat of}} his argument against the absurd bandit.|$|R
6000|$|SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. [Speaking {{with great}} firmness.] Arthur, I am very sorry, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> quite {{out of the}} question.

6000|$|... "No; there ain't; {{at least}} perhaps there ain't. Though {{as far as}} I can see, {{brothers}} and sisters {{out in the world}} are mostly as hard to each other where money is concerned as other people. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is,</b> you didn't mean to lend it without security." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> done; I {{was now in}} {{the arms}} of my new spouse, who {{appeared}} still the same as before; great even to magnificence, and nothing less than #1000 a year could support the ordinary equipage he appeared in.|$|R
60|$|That Ruth, {{even under}} the {{influence}} of Lora Delane Porter, should have been capable of her present insubordination, <b>was</b> surprising, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> too trivial {{to be a source of}} anxiety.

60|$|<b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> {{necessary}} to Milton, {{who wanted to}} assign some cause or original of the Devil's Rebellion; and so, as I said above, the design is well laid, it only wants two Trifles call'd Truth and History; so I leave it to struggle for itself.|$|R

6000|$|... "I have," [...] he said, [...] "failed {{here as a}} teacher. At {{first it}} hurt a little to admit it, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> plain.

"I thought I should--I thought I should--Faith, I am {{sometimes}} surprised {{myself at}} the turn things take in this world. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> not the less certain--the proofs are lying in the strong chest of our house at London, deposited there by the old Earl, who repented of his roguery to Miss Martigny long before he died, but had not courage enough to do his legitimate son justice till the sexton had housed him." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{success of}} my last {{experiment}} induced {{me to try}} an experiment with my photographic apparatus.

6000|$|... "I had fever, you know, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> remarkably real. It {{was like}} lantern {{pictures}} melting on the screen.

6000|$|I.--Little enough, I agree. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> {{that there}} must be a [...] great number of men at work, for us to make sure of the man of [...] genius: he is one out of a multitude.

60|$|Kit {{began to}} understand. Revillon {{had not been}} cheated; he was not very keen about seizing Mossamedes.

6000|$|Page 333. [...] "'Tis plain, all {{the power}} the bishops have, {{is derived from the}} people, &c." [...] In general the {{distinction}} lies here. The permissive power of exercising jurisdiction, lies in the people, or legislature, or administrator of a kingdom; but not of making him a bishop. As a physician that commenceth abroad, may be suffered to practise in London or be hindered; but they have not the power of creating him a doctor, which is peculiar to a university. This is some allusion; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> plain, as it seemeth to me, and wanteth no subterfuge, &c.|$|E

60|$|The office-boy pondered for a moment. Then {{he slowly}} opened a ledger, drew a day-book towards him, and {{continued}} his work.

60|$|Mrs. Austin {{knew her}} sister and waited, {{although}} she was annoyed. One could not blame Kit for doing what he ought, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> unlucky. After a minute or two, Jefferson jumped on a lava block and Olivia cried out. Just outside the harbour a long dark object rolled about in the foam. The object was like a boat, but it was obviously not the proper side up.|$|R
