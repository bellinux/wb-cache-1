25|$|Btrieve for Netware was {{essentially}} the same as Btrieve for DOS with some extra features available only on Netware at the time. It ran a server process, called BSERVER, on the file-sharing server and this managed data I/O in conjunction with the network file system. The server process was first implemented as a Netware Value Added Process (VAP) called BSERVER.VAP, but was switched to a Netware NetWare Loadable Module (NLM) soon after. BSERVER was the database engine that dealt with access to records, however it also accepted requests for the transmission of requested data to another server via the <b>BROUTER</b> process.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>BROUTER</b> process {{allowed for}} {{incoming}} requests to be [...] "routed" [...] to {{a copy of}} the database on another server. It was loaded on the Netware server and dealt with communication between multiple server processes running on the file-server through the use of two File Server Tables (FSTs). According to Pervasive, these provide a list of [...] "server names and addresses, and the Server Routing Table (SRT)". <b>BROUTER</b> also enabled communication requests to be routed to the correct server via SPX by looking up the BSPXCOM NLM and coordinated locks and other mechanisms that controlled access to the data in the Btrieve database.|$|E
2500|$|In 1987, Novell started diversifying {{and buying}} {{companies}} {{to add to}} their NetWare operating system. One of the companies they purchased was SoftCraft. Nancy Woodward became the Vice-President and General Manager of Novell's Austin operations while Doug Woodward became the Vice-President of Advanced Database Technologies. Early the next year, Btrieve 5.0 was released to run as a native NetWare application, or VAP (Value Added Process). According to Jim Kyle, [...] "it had auto-increment key types, the <b>BROUTER</b> network process server, data-only and key-only files, and optional data compression". Version 5.1 was released in 1990 with increased file-handling transaction capability, logging and roll-forward operations, along with several API enhancements. Several versions were created for DOS, OS/2 and Microsoft Windows. Version 6.0 was released in June 1992. However, it was not promoted extensively by Novell, and due to enhancements, (such as the change from pre-imaging to shadow-paging) it was incompatible with previous versions of Btrieve. The market did not increase much for Btrieve {{and it did not}} see wide adoption due to these issues.|$|E
50|$|<b>Brouters</b> {{operate at}} both the network layer for routable {{protocols}} and at the data link layer for non-routable protocols. As networks continue to become more complex, a mix of routable and non-routable protocols {{has led to the}} need for the combined features of bridges and routers. <b>Brouters</b> handle both routable and non-routable features by acting as routers for routable protocols and bridges for non-routable protocols. Bridged protocols might propagate throughout the network, but techniques such as filtering and learning might be used to reduce potential congestion. <b>Brouters</b> are used as connecting devices in the networking system, so it acts as a bridge in a network and as a router in an internetwork.|$|R
5000|$|Filtering {{broadcasts}} by Layer 3 equipment, typically routers (and even switches {{that employ}} advanced filtering called <b>brouters).</b>|$|R
5000|$|A routing bridge or RBridge, {{also known}} as a TRILL Switch, is a network device that {{implements}} the TRILL protocol, as specified by the IETF [...] and {{should not be confused with}} <b>BRouters</b> (Bridging Routers). RBridges are compatible with previous IEEE 802.1 customer bridges as well as IPv4 and IPv6 routers and end nodes. They are invisible to current IP routers and, like routers, RBridges terminate the bridge spanning tree protocol.|$|R
50|$|A bridge router or <b>brouter</b> is {{a network}} device that {{works as a}} bridge and as a router. The <b>brouter</b> routes packets for known {{protocols}} and simply forwards all other packets as a bridge would.|$|E

40|$|This paper aims to give {{a general}} {{description}} of a Bridge designed to transparently interconnect a cloud of MilCAN [1] segments using a high-speed backbone such as Ethernet. MilCAN is a protocol developed {{under the auspices of}} the International High Speed Data Bus Users group in order to cover the requirements for military Vetronics systems, providing deterministic and redundant communication between MilCAN nodes. With the constant increase of embedded devices within a vehicle the need for interconnection clashes with the speed limits of available backbone protocols. The VSI-Bridge is a software-based Bridge with routing capabilities (<b>BRouter)</b> developed to connect a MilCAN segment to high-speed complex protocols used as backbones. The target was to offload non-critical traffic from the embedded network to the backbone, thus reducing the load...|$|E
