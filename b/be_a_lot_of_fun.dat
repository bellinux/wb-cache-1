500|$|Reviews of FireRed and LeafGreen {{were mostly}} positive, and the games {{currently}} hold an aggregate score of 81percent on Metacritic. Craig Harris of IGN gave the games an [...] "Outstanding" [...] 9.0/10 rating and praised {{the creators of}} the games for creating a game that [...] "works extremely well for the handheld market. It doesn't have quite the same variety as Ruby/Sapphire, but it's still incredibly satisfying." [...] Harris was less positive about the games' graphics, which he thought were [...] "limited" [...] and [...] "basic". GameSpot's Greg Kasavin, who gave the games 8.4 out of 10, commented that [...] "though Pokémon could probably use a few new twists after all these years, FireRed and LeafGreen are great role-playing games on their own merits, filled with lots more content and more challenges than last year's Ruby and Sapphire, and offering up plenty of addictive gameplay that can <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>fun</b> for players of all ages." [...] Unlike Harris, Kasavin praised the games' graphics for their [...] "colorful good looks and the endearing character designs that the series is known for." [...] Game Informer rated the games a [...] "Very Good" [...] 8/10 for being [...] "a lot of fun", yet they saw the graphics as [...] "utterly unremarkable" [...] {{when compared to other}} handheld games.|$|E
500|$|Before 20th Century Fox gave Alien vs. Predator the greenlight, Aliens writer/{{director}} James Cameron {{had been}} working on a story for a fifth Alien film. Alien director Ridley Scott had talked with Cameron, stating [...] "I think it would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>fun,</b> {{but the most important thing}} is to get the story right." [...] In a 2002 interview, Scott's concept for a story was [...] "to go back to where the alien creatures were first found and explain how they were created"; this project eventually became Scott's film Prometheus (2012). On learning that Fox intended to pursue Alien vs. Predator, Cameron believed the film would [...] "kill the validity of the franchise" [...] and ceased work on his story, [...] "To me, that was Frankenstein Meets Werewolf. It was Universal just taking their assets and starting to play them off against each other...Milking it." [...] After viewing Alien vs. Predator, however, Cameron remarked that [...] "it was actually pretty good. I think of the five Alien films, I'd rate it third. I actually liked it. I actually liked it a lot." [...] Conversely, Ridley Scott had no interest in the Alien vs. Predator films. When asked in May 2012 if he had watched them, Scott laughed, [...] "No. I couldn't do that. I couldn't quite take that step." [...] Director Neill Blomkamp would eventually go on to pitch his sequel to Aliens.|$|E
500|$|Seili has {{received}} mixed to positive reviews from music critics. Most of the reviewers have been {{appreciative of the}} vocals and the successful combination of synthpop and darker ballads, but more or less critical with the notable contrast between the thumping pop song [...] "Nettiin" [...] {{and the rest of}} the album and Vartiainen's lack of peculiarity. Teemu Fiilin of the magazine Rumba gave Seili three out of five stars, saying that [...] "Seili follows pretty much the schlager-ish pattern of a poet girl's inflated electro-pop". He complimented [...] "En haluu kuolla tänä yönä" [...] as [...] "a brilliant pop song, suitable to be sung by a [...] 27-year-old Jenni Vartiainen who is enjoying her life". Due to the accompaniment of the more poetical, dramatical and mature songs written by Mariska, Fiilin considered [...] "Nettiin" [...] "a really epic fail" [...] that [...] "would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>fun</b> if performed by Tea Hiilloste on Kids Top 20". He thought [...] "Duran Duran" [...] is also brilliant, but considered Vartiainen to be more talented with faster songs, because she, when singing melancholic songs, [...] "lags kilometers behind [...] Chisu". The pop rock magazine Stara said the album is not as good at first hearing as Vartiainen's debut Ihmisten edessä, but it gave the album four out five stars. The magazine complimented the aggregate of [...] "En haluu kuolla tänä yönä" [...] and the beauty and elegance of [...] "Duran Duran". Stara was less harsh on reviewing the inclusion of [...] "Nettiin", saying the Western-themed sounds seem a bit odd, but that the song is good in its entirety.|$|E

Just like any other Used record, it’s a horse of many colors: There <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> soft and heavy sounds, there <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> brutal, sharp, bright sounds, and the tempos are {{anywhere}} from ultra-slow to super fast and heavy.

5000|$|Craig Sheeley {{reviewed}} GURPS Illuminati for Challenge #66. Sheeley {{comments in}} his conclusion: [...] "GURPS Illuminati {{is one of}} this season's bestsellers for Steve Jackson Games, outselling even their masterpiece, Hacker. This {{is not to say}} that there <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> people out there who buy the conspiracy theory, or that there <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> gamers wanting to actually play the game of paranoia ...

500|$|Reviews for Ravenloft were {{generally}} positive. Rick Swan reviewed the adventure in The Space Gamer No. 72. He commented {{that there was}} [...] "so much gothic atmosphere in Ravenloft that if it had any more, it'd flap its pages and fly away", and stated {{that the bulk of}} the adventure involving a search of Castle Ravenloft was [...] "not too interesting" [...] with encounters few and far between, and that the mechanic of using a regular deck of cards to simulate a gypsy fortune teller was [...] "silly and the results are too arbitrary" [...] but concluded that [...] "Ravenloft is such a refreshing change that even with its problems, it's recommended." [...] In the July 1984 issue of White Dwarf magazine, the module was given 8 out of 10 overall, with the reviewer mentioning its presentation as a positive, and its complexity as a negative. It was likened to a Hammer horror production and praised as enjoyable, although the reviewer said the game's puns were tedious and detracted from the spooky atmosphere. White Dwarf reviewer Dave Morris said it [...] "should <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>fun</b> – 'light, relief' of a nerve-wracking and deadly sort" [...] and concluded that Ravenloft is [...] "full of clever touches", and [...] "features some first-class illustration and graphics". In a review for the January 1984 issue of Dragon magazine (published by a subsidiary of TSR), game designer Ken Rolston argued that, despite its design innovations, Ravenloft was still in essence a dungeon-style adventure. Rolston praised the randomization, the maps, and the player text (which is read aloud to the players by the DM). He said the player text [...] "consistently develops an atmosphere of darkness and decay." [...] Despite this, Rolston felt that the adventure has trouble in developing a frightening tone. He singles out its use of common monsters in D, an abundance of traps, and frequent combat interludes as elements that detract from the adventure's spookiness by interrupting the module's flow. Ultimately, he felt that in [...] "AD terms it is a masterpiece", but not a work of [...] "Gothic horror". Tracy Hickman stated in 1998, [...] "I still believe the original Ravenloft modules were perhaps the best that ever had my name on them." ...|$|E

So it's going to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>fun.</b> It's going to be much more free, as far as the acting style."
