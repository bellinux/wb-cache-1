The Quarter was hard hit by the Great Depression and struggled to recover after. Some companies constructed large factories {{as they tried to}} diversify their businesses.

In the meantime, they launched Metanoia (1998), a compilation of improvisations recorded during the Signify sessions, some of which were later shaped into songs. Finally, they signed to Snapper/K-Scope and the album Stupid Dream (1999) was issued. The album was a departure in style from all their previous works, in favour a more song-oriented direction, as a consequence this alienated some older fans but <b>brought</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of new ones. Its follow-up, Lightbulb Sun (2000), assured the fan base and solidified the ground of its predecessor. For this one, they worked with Dave Gregory of XTC, who provided string arrangements.

Merlino was only 32 years old, an extremely young age for any Mafia member, let alone a leader of a Mafia family. Merlino and his allies were all young and unexperienced in running a criminal organization of such magnitude. They were also flashy, violent and loved the limelight. Merlino was often spotted by reporters and cameramen on the streets of South Philadelphia followed by a large entourage. Merlino's high-profile <b>brought</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of attention from the press and law enforcement. The crime family itself was unstable, with things poorly managed by Merlino's crew whose violent reputation was used to keep things in order. The Merlino faction's arrogance and aggressiveness turned off a lot of criminals from working with the crime family. Merlino's associates were also involved in drug deals in Philadelphia and Boston while overseeing the crime family's gambling, loan sharking, stolen goods and extortion rackets.|$|E

However, titles that were not participating in an event for the month, such as [...] "Forever Evil", were still grouped together in the larger solicit by the previous family headings. In September 2014, DC co-publisher Dan DiDio spoke about classifying the titles into the families, saying, [...] "one of the things we did, when we launched the New 52, we broke those classifications up {{in a way that we}} were able to draw attention to all the characters.

500|$|As {{a border}} {{crossing}} between two large growing countries, the Suspension Bridge had throngs of travelers passing over it. [...] Furthermore, {{it was the}} intersection of three major railroads. [...] Coupled with its vicinity to a natural wonder, the Niagara Falls, the bridge <b>brought</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of railroad traffic into the region once it was opened. [...] The towns {{at the ends of}} the bridge benefited greatly from this heavy movement of people and goods. [...] The village of Suspension Bridge, United States, grew quickly within a few years after the opening of the bridge, acquiring shops, factories, and a hotel. [...] Its tourism and commerce soon rivaled the town of Niagara Falls, New York; eventually, the village was merged into the town in 1892. [...] Similarly, Clifton on the Canadian end of the bridge was integrated into the town of Niagara Falls, Ontario. [...] The two Niagara Falls cities boasted commerce that surpassed neighboring settlements. [...] Around the time of its official opening, the bridge was one of the busiest points of trade on the United States–Canada border, carrying $12million of transitory goods and $2million of bonded materials into Canada.

Chris Carter said of the episode, [...] "I'm proud of the way it came together, what it did for the series, and the overwhelmingly positive response it has gotten. I'm very pleased beginning season three with where this episode put us—which is that it posed more questions than it answered." [...] He later said in 2005 that the episode <b>brought</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of interest to the show due to the apparent death of agent Mulder. The episode, along with both other parts of the story arc, were listed concurrently as the second-best episode of the series by Den of Geek's Nina Sordi.

Paul Mariner was full of praise for his team and singled out youngster Yannick Bolasie, who made his debut for the club. [...] "We played with intellect.
