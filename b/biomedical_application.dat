The following article deals with fifth generation biomaterials {{that are used}} for bone structure replacement. For any material to be classified for <b>biomedical</b> <b>application</b> three requirements must be met.

Secondly, the material should be biodegradable (for in-graft only); the material should harmlessly degrade or dissolve {{in the body of the}} organism to allow it to resume natural functioning. Thirdly, the material should be mechanically sound; for the replacement of load [...] bearing structures, the material should possess equivalent or greater mechanical stability to ensure high reliability of the graft.|$|E

30|$|Gold {{nanoclusters}} (AuNCs) {{have been}} extensively applied as a fluorescent probe for <b>biomedical</b> <b>applications</b> in imaging, detection, and therapy {{due to their}} unique chemical and physical properties. Fluorescent probes of AuNCs have exhibited high compatibility, superior photostablility, and excellent water solubility which resulted in remarkable <b>biomedical</b> <b>applications</b> for long-term imaging, high-sensitivity detection, and target-specific treatment.

50|$|The main {{drawback}} of {{microcontact printing}} for <b>biomedical</b> <b>application</b> {{is that it}} is not possible to print different molecules with one stamp. To print different (bio)molecules in one step, a new concept is proposed : the macrostamp. It is a stamp composed of dots. The space between the dots corresponds to the space between the wells of a microplate. Then, it is possible to ink, dry and print in one step different molecules.|$|E
50|$|Perfluorochemical (perfluorocarbon) {{molecules}} {{have very}} different structures that impart different physical properties such as respiratory gas solubility, density, viscosity, vapor pressure, and lipid solubility. Thus, {{it is critical to}} choose the appropriate PFC for a specific <b>biomedical</b> <b>application,</b> such as liquid ventilation, drug delivery or blood substitutes. The physical properties of PFC liquids vary substantially; however, the one common property is their high solubility for respiratory gases. In fact, these liquids carry more oxygen and carbon dioxide than blood.|$|E
5000|$|If {{the rings}} and axes are {{biodegradable}} and biocompatible, the polyrotaxanes {{can also be}} used for <b>biomedical</b> <b>application,</b> such as gene/drug delivery. The advantage of polyrotaxanes over other biomedical polymers, such as polysaccharides, is that because the interlocked structures are maintained by bulky stoppers at the ends of the strings, if the bulky stoppers are removed, such as removed by a chemical stimulus, rings dethread from the axes. The drastic structural change can be used for programmed drug or gene delivery, in which the drug or gene can be released with the rings when the stoppers are cut off at the specific destination.|$|E

5000|$|The {{toxicity}} of SWNHs {{is a critical}} issue relating to their <b>biomedical</b> <b>application,</b> which has been investigated in vitro and in vivo extensively. [...] The SWNHs {{were found to be}} a nonirritant and a nondermal sensitizer through skin primary and conjunctival irritation tests and skin sensitization test. Negative mutagenic and clastogenic potentials suggest that SWNHs are not carcinogenic. The acute peroral {{toxicity of}} SWNHs was found to be quite low—the lethal dosage for rats was more than 2000 mg/kg of body weight. Intratracheal instillation tests revealed that SWNHs rarely damaged rat lung tissue for a 90-day test period, although black pigmentation due to accumulated nanohorns was observed. While further toxicological assessments, including chronic (repeated dose), reproductive, and developmental toxicity studies, are still needed, yet the present results strongly suggest that as-grown SWNHs have low acute toxicities.|$|E
50|$|The {{complexity}} of biological systems requires customized care {{to sustain their}} function. When {{they are no longer}} able to perform their purpose, interference of new cells and biological cues is provided by a scaffold material. Fibrin scaffold has many aspects like being biocompatible, biodegradable and easily processable. Furthermore, it has an autologous nature and it can be manipulated in various size and shape. Inherent role in wound healing is helpful in surgical applications. Many factors can be bound to fibrin scaffold and those can be released in a cell-controlled manner. Its stiffness can be managed by changing the concentration according to needs of surrounding or encapsulated cells. Additional mechanical properties can be obtained by combining fibrin with other suitable scaffolds. Each <b>biomedical</b> <b>application</b> has its own characteristic requirement for different kinds of tissues and recent studies with fibrin scaffold are promising towards faster recovery, less complications and long-lasting solutions.|$|E

50|$|Co-Cr alloy {{was first}} {{discovered}} by Elwood Haynes {{in the early}} 1900s by fusing cobalt and chromium. The alloy was first discovered with many other elements such as tungsten and molybdenum in it. Haynes reported his alloy was capable of resisting oxidation and corrosive fumes and exhibited no visible sign of tarnish even when subjecting the alloy to boiling nitric acid. Under the name Stellite™, Co-Cr alloy {{has been used in}} various fields where high wear-resistance was needed including aerospace industry, cutlery, bearings, blades, etc. Co-Cr alloy started receiving more attention as its <b>biomedical</b> <b>application</b> was found. In the 20th century, the alloy was first used in medical tool manufacturing, and in 1960, the first Co-Cr prosthetic heart valve was implanted, which happened to last over 30 years showing its high wear-resistance. Recently, due to excellent resistant properties, biocompatibility, high melting points, and incredible strength at high temperatures, Co-Cr alloy is used for the manufacture of many artificial joints including hips and knees, dental partial bridge work, gas turbines, and many others.|$|E
50|$|The {{group is}} {{multidisciplinary}} and draws {{on a range}} of specialisms including, biology, chemistry, engineering, physics and computational modelling to help develop understanding of the structure function relationships used by amphiphilic bioactive molecules. The term ‘‘peptide-amphiphile’’ can be used to describe amphiphilic peptides consisting only of amino acids that show segregation of charged and uncharged components within the primary or secondary structure. Alternatively they may be composed of hydrophilic peptides linked to hydrophobic alkyl chains or lipids, and peptide based copolymers. Such molecules are of significant biological importance due to the range of asymmetric boundaries that occur in nature such as those found at a membrane lipid interface. Amphiphilic protein sequences can be involved in protein targeting, membrane protein assembly as well as membrane fusion and lysis. In addition to amphiphilic peptides possessing key biological functions amphiphiles are becoming of increasing interest in the creation of new biomaterials. Amphiphiles can self-assemble into a variety of different structures such as micelles, vesicles, monolayers, bilayers, nanofibers, nanotapes, ribbons, and twisted ribbons, to minimise unfavorable interactions with their surroundings. A key aspect of his work involves the development of bioactive peptides and new biomaterials with <b>biomedical</b> <b>application.</b>|$|E
50|$|The wear, friction, and {{electrical}} properties of DLC {{make it an}} appealing material for medical applications. Fortunately, DLC has proved to have excellent bio-compatibility as well. This has enabled many medical procedures, such as Percutaneous coronary intervention employing brachytherapy {{to benefit from the}} unique electrical properties of DLC. At low voltages and low temperatures electrodes coated with DLC can emit enough electrons to be arranged into disposable, micro-X-ray tubes as small as the radioactive seeds that are introduced into arteries or tumors in conventional brachytherapy. The same dose of prescribed radiation can be applied from the inside, out with the additional possibility to switch on and off the radiation in the prescribed pattern for the X-rays being used. DLC has proved to be an excellent coating to prolong the life of and reduce complications with replacement hip joints and artificial knees. It also has been successfully applied to coronary artery stents, reducing the incidence of thrombosis. The implantable human heart pump can be considered the ultimate <b>biomedical</b> <b>application</b> where DLC coating is used on blood contacting surfaces of the key components of the device.|$|E
