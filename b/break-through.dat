5|$|On 14 April 1999, the Pakistan Post, {{as part of}} its 'Scientists of Pakistan' series, {{issued a}} {{commemorative}} stamp to honour the contributions and services of Siddiqui. In the same year, the street leading to PCSIR Laboratories Complex in Karachi was named as Shahrah-e-Dr. Salim-uz-Zaman Siddiqui. Siddiqui was also remembered by his students and colleagues, many of whom continued to dedicate their international research and publications to his memory. In 2002, a research article was published in the journal Tetrahedron in which, authors Faizi and Naz dedicated their <b>break-through</b> research to the memory of Siddiqui, their mentor.|$|E
5|$|On 10 May 1940, Germany invaded Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Belgium {{under the}} {{operational}} plan Fall Gelb (Case Yellow). The Allied armies attempted {{to halt the}} German Army in Belgium, believing {{it to be the}} main German thrust. After the French had fully committed the best of the Allied armies to Belgium between 10 and 12 May, the Germans enacted the second phase of their operation, a <b>break-through,</b> or sickle cut, through the Ardennes, and advanced toward the English Channel. The German Army (Heer) reached the Channel after five days, encircling the Allied armies. The Germans gradually reduced the pocket of Allied forces, forcing them back to the sea. The Belgian Army surrendered on 28 May 1940, ending the battle.|$|E

This involves both the Monte Carlo (MC) method and the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling procedure. One may have gleaned this also already from the “Constructing a posterior random variable” section.|$|R
5|$|The main {{opposition}} to Simonds's force was the 12th SS Panzer Division, {{which included the}} remnants of two infantry divisions. German forces within the Falaise Pocket approached 350,000 men. Had surprise been achieved, the Canadians would likely have succeeded in a rapid <b>break-through.</b> However, {{on the night of}} 13/14 August, a Canadian officer lost his way while moving between divisional headquarters. He drove into German lines and was promptly killed. The Germans discovered a copy of Simonds' orders on his body. As a result, the 12th SS Panzer Division placed the bulk of its remaining strength—500grenadiers and 15tanks, along with twelve 8.8 cm PaK 43 anti-tank guns— along the Allies' expected line of approach.|$|E
5|$|On 5 August 2010, Parma {{announced}} {{the signing of}} Giovinco on loan from Juventus, with an option to buy half of the player's transfer rights {{at the end of}} the season. He made his Parma debut against Brescia in a 2–0 win on 29 August. He scored his first goal for Parma on 12 September 2010, a free kick in a 2–1 loss to Catania. An impressive start to the season earned Giovinco a call up to represent the Italian national team. On 6 January 2011, Giovinco scored two goals for Parma in a 4–1 win against his parent club, Juventus. After initially struggling to settle-in at Parma, he refound his form towards the end of the season and made his <b>break-through</b> with the club, finishing his first season at the club with 7 goals in 30 appearances in the league. At the end of the season, on 22 June 2011, Parma exercised the option to buy half of Giovinco's contract for a fee of €3 million.|$|E
5|$|Rest at Metz was {{interrupted}} by the German offensive in the Ardennes, the Battle of the Bulge. The division moved north to Luxembourg from 19 to 21 December, {{to take part in}} the battle of the Ardennes <b>break-through.</b> It attacked at Rambrouch and Grosbous on 22 December, beat off strong German counterattacks, captured Arsdorf on Christmas Day after heavy fighting, attacked toward the Wiltz River, but was forced to withdraw in the face of determined German resistance. After regrouping on 5–8 January 1945, it attacked again, crossing the Wiltz River on 20 January. The division continued its advance, taking Grumelscheid on 21 January, and crossed the Clerf River on 24 January. The division was reassigned to XX Corps. The division immediately shifted to the east bank of the Saar, and maintained defensive positions in the Saarlautern area from 29 January until 6 March 1945.|$|E

5|$|The {{fighting}} was costly for both sides. Although the Australians halted the advancing Chinese 117th Division and inflicted numerous casualties on them, they also suffered heavy losses. In the aftermath the inexperienced Australian battalion commander—Lieutenant Colonel Floyd Walsh—was relieved {{of his position}} by the British brigade commander, having taken over just six days earlier {{following the death of}} the previous commanding officer at Chongju. Nonetheless, the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade succeeded in preventing a Chinese <b>break-through</b> at Pakchon, keeping open vital withdrawal routes across the river and securing the UN left flank. Suffering significant casualties, the Chinese offensive was halted the next day due to logistic difficulties. The Chinese and North Koreans were temporarily forced to withdraw north, while the UN successfully reinforced its positions, holding on the Chongchon Line. Yet by late November the US Eighth Army was again forced to withdraw after the Chinese began their Second Phase Offensive, starting a long retreat south. The UN forces were expelled from North Korea, and withdrew to the 38th Parallel where they sought to re-establish defensive positions.|$|E
