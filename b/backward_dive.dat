50|$|The men's 10 metre platform, also {{reported}} as plongeons de haut vol variés (English: varied high diving), {{was one of}} five diving events on the diving at the 1924 Summer Olympics programme. The competition was actually held from both 10 metre and 5 metre platforms. Divers performed four compulsory dives - standing inward plain dive, standing <b>backward</b> <b>dive</b> with twist, running forward somersault dive and running reverse somersault dive (5 metre platform) - and four dives of the competitor's choice {{for a total of}} eight dives. The competition was held on Saturday July 19, 1924, and Sunday July 20, 1924.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the inward two and one half {{somersault}} dive in a tuck position (405 C) performed by females (n = 22) and the inward two and one half somersault dive in a pike position (405 B) performed by males (n = 24) to determine changes required by females to successfully perform 405 B. Key performance variables in inward dives were also compared to those of <b>backward</b> <b>dives.</b> Video data of the dives performed at the 1999 FINA World Diving Cup were captured and digitised to obtain times and postures of the divers at specific events including takeoff and entry. Estimates of flight height and mass-normalised work done on the springboard were obtained from flight times. Some females worked the springboard strongly enough to generate sufficient height and rotation to perform 405 B. Males performed 405 B comfortably because they achieved better height and rotation than the females. A comparison of <b>backward</b> and inward <b>dives</b> revealed that divers are able to attain greater height in <b>backward</b> <b>dives</b> than inward dives...|$|R
5000|$|Divers {{performed}} five pre-chosen dives (one {{from each}} category) - a running straight header forward, backward header with pike, running straight isander-half gainer reverse <b>dive,</b> <b>backward</b> spring and forward dive with pike, and running straight forward twist.|$|R
50|$|The men's 3 metre springboard, also {{reported}} as plongeons du tremplin (English: trampoline diving), {{was one of}} five diving events on the diving at the 1924 Summer Olympics programme. The competition was actually held from both 3 metre and 1 metre boards. Divers performed six compulsory <b>dives</b> - standing <b>backward</b> plain <b>dive,</b> standing forward dive with twist, standing inward piked dive with twist, standing reverse piked dive, standing reverse plain dive with twist (3 metre board) and a standing forward somersault piked dive (1 metre board) - two jury-drawn dives and four dives of the competitor's choice {{for a total of}} twelve dives. The competition was held on Wednesday July 16, 1924, and Thursday July 17, 1924.|$|R
5000|$|... weather= 38°F (Sunny)A home {{overtime}} {{loss to the}} San Francisco 49ers {{snapped the}} Eagles' nine-game winning streak. A bad snap led to an early field goal miss for San Francisco, but after an Eagles 3-and-out, the 49ers took back over and scored on a 15-yard screen pass to Kevan Barlow. The defense then tightened and creating a turnover {{that led to a}} short Duce Staley touchdown run. Todd Pinkston fumbled away a touchdown out of the endzone after catching a long pass from Donovan McNabb. The Eagles took a 14-7 lead on another short-yardage Staley touchdown. A 33-yard pass from Garcia to Brandon Lloyd tied the score at halftime. Before the half was over, 49ers star Terrell Owens had broken his collarbone, and Eagles starting linebacker Carlos Emmons had broken his leg - a big blow for the playoffs. Brian Westbrook returned a punt 81 yards for a touchdown in the third quarter - bringing back recent memories of his big touchdown in the Meadowlands. San Francisco answered with two fields goals and a touchdown by Barlow (followed by a successful two-point conversion) to take a 28-21 lead. McNabb rallied the Eagles, driving them down the field (with Freddie Mitchell coming up with a big 4th down reception). McNabb beat the blitz and Pinkston made a <b>backward</b> <b>diving</b> catch to tie the game with a minute left. In overtime, Tony Parrish picked off McNabb and returned it inside the Eagles 5-yard line. Todd Peterson kicked the game winner and the Eagles' streak ended. McNabb had two interceptions and David Akers missed two field goals. Pinkston had 121 receiving yards and a touchdown, but Barlow rushed for 154 for San Francisco. With the loss, the Eagles dropped their record to 11-4.|$|R
50|$|The men's 10 metre platform, also {{reported}} as high diving, {{was one of}} four diving events on the diving at the 1928 Summer Olympics programme. The competition was actually held from both 10 metre and 5 metre boards. Divers performed four compulsory dives - running plain <b>dive,</b> <b>backward</b> somersault (5 metre platform), standing plain dive, running plain dive (10 metre platform) - and four dives of the competitor's choice (different from the compulsory), from either platform, for a total of eight dives. The competition was held from Thursday August 9, 1928 to Saturday August 11, 1928.|$|R
