5|$|A Non-constituency Member of Parliament ("NCMP") is a {{candidate}} of an opposition political party who, despite having lost in a general election, is declared elected as a Member of the Parliament of Singapore ("MP") by virtue of provisions in the Constitution and the Parliamentary Elections Act enabling the unsuccessful candidates who have performed the best to be accorded the status. The MP is so called <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> does not represent any constituency (or electoral division) in Parliament.|$|E
5|$|The {{applicant}} for {{an election}} {{to be avoided}} may ask for a declaration that the election is void, that a particular candidate was wrongfully declared to have been elected, and/or that another candidate was duly elected. The applicant may also request for a scrutiny– that is, a re-examination of the ballot papers– {{if he or she}} alleges that an unsuccessful candidate had a majority of lawful votes. When a scrutiny is conducted, the election judge may order a vote to be struck off if the voter was not on the register of electors assigned to the polling station at which the vote was recorded or was not authorized to vote at the station; if the vote was obtained by bribery, treating or undue influence; if the voter committed or induced someone to commit the offence of personation; and if the vote was for a disqualified candidate and the disqualification was either a matter that the voter was aware of or was sufficiently publicized or widely known. During a scrutiny, a tendered vote that is shown to be valid will be added to the poll if any party to the proceedings asks for the vote to be added. On the other hand, a registered elector's vote will not be struck off at a scrutiny just <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> was not qualified to be on the electoral register, and the returning officer's decision {{as to whether or not}} a ballot paper should be rejected may not be questioned.|$|E

40|$|This Note {{points out}} {{problems}} with the Bragdon v. Abbott Supreme Court decision and ultimately argues that an asymptomatic HIV-positive person is not disabled under the first definition of disability contained in the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA); that is, “a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits {{one or more of}} the major life activities of such individual. ” An asymptomatic HIV-positive individual is not disabled within that definition <b>because,</b> even though <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> suffers from a physical impairment, the impairment does not substantially limit any major life activity. Although this Note rejects the argument that reproduction is a major life activity even assuming arguendo that reproduction is a major life activity within the meaning of the ADA, the ability to reproduce is not substantially limited. Any limitation comes not from the physical impairment itself, but from the individual’s reaction to the disease...|$|R

25|$|Ontological hermeneutics {{affirms that}} human beings exist in a world around them and that through {{background}} a priori (before experience) foreknowledge, they constantly seek to understand themselves and that world, including other humans and inanimate objects. Heidegger termed human beings as Dasein, the German word for being-there. In other words, an individual is termed Dasein <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> exists there, being there at some place in the present. Put in more simple terms, an individual is Dasein <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> literally exists. Heidegger, along with Dilthey, was concerned about understanding human nature, {{what it means to}} exist, to be.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} {{intrinsic}} motivation is when an employee becomes an IT professional <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> {{wants to learn}} about how computer users interact with computer networks. The employee has the intrinsic motivation to gain more knowledge. Art for art's sake {{is an example of}} intrinsic motivation in the domain of art.|$|E
50|$|Reeder (2000) {{found that}} there are four types of {{attraction}} within cross-platform friendships: subjective physical/sexual attraction, objective physical/sexual attraction, romantic attraction, and friendship attraction. Subjective physical/sexual attraction occurs {{when one of the}} individuals in the friendship is physically attracted to the other. Objective physical/sexual attraction happens when one individual thinks that the other is attractive in general, yet they are not attracted to the person. Romantic attraction within the cross-platform friendship occurs when one of the individuals within the friendship desires to turn the friendship into a romantic relationship <b>because</b> they believe <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> would make a good girlfriend or boyfriend. Friendship attraction is simply when an individual feels very platonically connected to his or her friend. The four types can coexist together within a friendship or can occur separately. Furthermore, the type of attraction that an individual feels within a cross-platform friendship can change over time. Within Reeder’s (2000) sample, friendship attraction is the most prevalent type of attraction within cross-platform friendships. Even when participants felt other types of attraction within their cross-platform friendships, they prioritized their friendship attraction so that they relationship would not be ruined.|$|R

Managing such a center is a very complex and difficult taskregarding to the different processes and factors in a usual warehouse when we want tominimize the labor costs. Most of the workers’ working time is spent with travelingbetween source and destination points which cause deadheading. Even if a worker knowsthe structure of a warehouse well and <b>because</b> of that <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> can find the shortest pathbetween two points, it is still not guaranteed that there won’t be long traveling timebetween the locations of two consecutive tasks. We need optimal assignments betweentasks and workers. In the scientific literature Generalized Assignment Problem (GAP) is a wellknownproblem which deals with the assignment of m workers to n tasks consideringseveral constraints. The primary purpose of my thesis project was to choose a heuristics(genetic algorithm, tabu search or ant colony optimization) to be implemented into SAPExtended Warehouse Management (SAP EWM) by with task assignment will be moreeffective between tasks and resources. After system analysis I had to realize that due different constraints and businessdemands only 1 : 1 assingments are allowed in SAP EWM. Because of that I had to use adifferent and simpler approach – instead of the introduced heuristics – which could gainbetter assignments during the test phase in several cases.

6000|$|We did {{not think}} {{there were so many}} boys, proportionately, or boys let loose, in Madrid as in the other towns we had seen, and we remarked to that sort of foreign sojourner who is so often met in strange cities that the {{children}} seemed like little men and women. [...] "Yes," [...] he said, [...] "the Spaniards are not children until they are thirty or forty, and then they never grow up." [...] It was perhaps too epigrammatic, but it may have caught at a fact. From another foreign sojourner I heard that the Catholicism of Spain, in spite of all newspaper appearances to the contrary and many bold novels, is still intense and unyieldingly repressive. But how far the severity of the church characterizes manners {{it would be hard to}} say. Perhaps these are often the effect of temperament. One heard more than one saw of the indifference of shop-keepers to shoppers in Madrid; in Andalusia, say especially in Seville, one saw nothing of it. But from the testimony of sufferers it appears to be the Madrid shop-keeper's reasonable conception that if a customer comes to buy something it is <b>because</b> <b>he,</b> <b>or</b> more frequently <b>she,</b> wants it and is more concerned than himself in the transaction. He does not put himself about in serving her, and if she intimates that he is rudely indifferent, and that though she has often come to him before she will never come again, he remains tranquil. From experience I cannot say how true this is; but certainly I failed to awaken any lively emotion in the booksellers of whom I tried to buy some modern plays. It seemed to me that I was vexing them in the Oriental calm which they would have preferred to my money, or even my interest in the new Spanish drama. But in a shop where fans were sold, the shopman, taken in an unguarded moment, seemed really to enter into the spirit of our selection for friends at home; he even corrected my wrong accent in the Spanish word for fan, which was certainly going a great way.|$|R

But <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> cannot vote unless his or her vote would break a tie and by convention must vote {{to maintain the status}} quo (which includes voting confidence in the government), a minority government can slightly weaken the opposition's power by electing an opposition speaker.|$|E

25|$|One {{effect of}} modern patent usage {{is that a}} small-time inventor, who can afford both the {{patenting}} process and {{the defense of the}} patent, can use the exclusive right status to become a licensor.

500|$|In 1793, {{when the}} British {{government}} {{called on the}} nation to fast in honour of the war, anti-war Dissenters such as Barbauld were left with a moral quandary: [...] "Obey the order and violate their consciences by praying for success in a war they disapproved? observe the Fast, but preach against the war? defy the Proclamation and refuse to take any part in the Fast?" [...] Barbauld took this opportunity to write a sermon, Sins of Government, Sins of the Nation, on the moral responsibility of the individual; for her, each individual {{is responsible for the}} actions of the nation <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> constitutes part of the nation. The essay attempts to determine what the proper role of the individual is in the state and while she argues that [...] "insubordination" [...] can undermine a government, she does admit that there are lines of [...] "conscience" [...] that one cannot cross in obeying a government.

500|$|In 1965, the {{benefits}} of the National College of Education partnership were less evident and the Administrative Board purchased Avery Coonley from the NCE. Under Malach's leadership, ACS continued to experiment and innovate. Despite widespread skepticism among contemporary educators that kindergartners were ready to read, ACS launched an early reading program in the early 1960s. Malach's stance was that [...] "we don't believe a child should be taught <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> is now 6 years old or in 1st grade. Our children begin to learn to read when the teacher determines the child is ready. Then the teacher works individually with the child at his or her own pace." [...] By this time, however, the once-radical ideas of progressive education had become [...] "conventional wisdom" [...] and kindergarten was a ubiquitous feature of American public schools. As part of Malach's [...] "bid to reforge the leadership role that Avery Coonley School had played during its early years", ACS joined the Independent Schools Association of the Central States (ISACS) in 1961. ISACS was founded in 1908 to promote best practices in independent schools, and instituted a mandatory accreditation program for member schools in 1961. Avery Coonley served as the headquarters of ISACS from 1970 until the central office was dissolved in 2000.|$|E

On the other hand, if <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> behaves well and gains the trust of <b>he</b> <b>or</b> her colleagues, <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> is rewarded with progressively higher access rights.
