40|$|AbstractWe treated 27 {{children}} with idiopathic epilepsy with zonisamide monotherapy {{over a period}} of 2 years and observed <b>behaviour</b> <b>disturbances</b> in a prospective study. In all cases, seizure control was excellent; however, two cases (7. 4 %) had <b>behaviour</b> <b>disturbances.</b> The first (Case 1) was a 14 -year-old girl with partial epilepsy which began at age 4 years. Zonisamide was administered at age 6 years, which was effective against her seizures, but selective mutism, violent behaviour, and lack of concentration developed at age 10 years. The second (Case 2) was a 15 -year-old girl with generalized tonic–clonic seizures which began at age 10 years. Zonisamide was also effective against her seizures, but obsessive compulsive disorders (OCD) developed at age 13 years. The patients have had no other physical or mental problems and decreasing the dosage of zonisamide reduced the problems. There are few reports of <b>behaviour</b> <b>disturbances</b> provoked by zonisamide monotherapy in epileptic children who are neither physically nor mentally disturbed. While problems can develop several years later, in the present study, decreasing the zonisamide dosage maintained adequate prevention of seizures and eliminated the <b>behaviour</b> <b>disturbances.</b> Zonisamide is still a useful anticonvulsant for epileptic seizures, but physicians should be wary of its adverse behavioural side effects, which may arise several years later...|$|E

Children with non-accidental injury but without growth problems or emotional deprivation were least likely to show behaviour or developmental problems. The features associated with child abuse and neglect can be classified according to whether they describe factors that cause the abuse (primary) or its conse-quences. Thus primary factors (causative) such as parental violence, sexual deviance, or lack of attention lead to understimulation and emotiona...|$|R

40|$|The {{contingent}} negative variation (CNV) is a long-latency event-related potential elicited by paired or associated stimuli. We recorded contingent negative {{variation in}} 50 patients with complex partial and secondarily generalized seizures and in 20 neurologically and psychiatrically normal unmedicated controls. CNV was recorded from Fz, Cz, and Pz. A 2000 Hz tone was followed after 1. 5 s by 1000 microsecond light flash, {{at which a}} button press was to be executed. Filter band pass was 0. 1 – 20 Hz, analysis time was 10 s and 10 responses were replicated. Patients with complex partial seizures with and without secondary generalization had lower measurements of area under the CNV curve (AUC) than did controls, and CNV amplitude was significantly reduced. Patients with interictal behavioural symptoms had significantly smaller AUC and lower amplitude. No {{significant difference was found}} between depressed and non-depressed seizure patients with respect to AUC, but amplitude was significantly lower in depressed patients. Seizure patients with psychosis had significantly lower AUC but did not differ from non-psychotic patients in CNV amplitude. No differences were found between seizure patients with and without personality disorder with respect to CNV AUC or amplitude. Post-imperative negative variation was significantly more common in seizure patients than in controls and among patients with epilepsy, was significantly increased in those with inter-ictal <b>behaviour</b> <b>disturbance</b> generally and psychosis particularly. No specific effect of anticonvulsant monotherapy on AUC or amplitude was identified. These findings suggest that CNV may differ between partial epilepsy patients and controls, and that inter-ictal <b>behaviour</b> <b>disturbance</b> may particularly affect CNV measures. They also agree with previous evidence for a frontal lobe generator for the CNV, and a possible role for central dopaminergic pathways in the production of PINV...|$|R

40|$|Determinants of intergenerational social {{mobility}} were examined in 8287 men from the British Cohort Study 1970.

Structural equation modelling using full information maximum likelihood estimation demonstrated that: educational qualifications mediated other predictors' effects, accounting for the greatest amount of variance in people's own social status attainment; there was a substantial overlap of childhood behavioural disturbance, intelligence, and locus of control; there were effects of parental social class on own occupational social class attainment.

40|$|The {{diagnosis}} {{and management of}} epilepsy in the population of people with learning disabilities can be complex and challenging. Epilepsy {{is the most common}} medical condition seen in people with learning disabilities, and both the disorder and its treatment can have significant impact upon an individual’s physical health and psychological wellbeing. Assessment may be complicated by other common comorbidities, such as communication difficulties, mental illness and challenging behaviour, as well as issues raised by the individual’s capacity to consent to treatment. The disorder itself may also be potentially more complex to treat, with many individuals experiencing more than one seizure type and a greater chance of treatment resistance compared with the general population. These complicating factors and far-reaching consequences make an accurate {{diagnosis and}} individualized management plan all the more important in this population. This contribution addresses these issues, focusing on individualized assessment and treatment and highlighting the assessment of <b>behaviour</b> <b>disturbance</b> in conjunction with epilepsy and its treatment...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{reasons for}} the {{occurrence}} of interictal <b>behaviour</b> <b>disturbance</b> in children with epilepsy, and the management of such problems, are considered. The search for a direct relationship between epilepsy related variables and behaviour disorders is far from conclusive. While such a relationship may exist with respect to ictal behaviour problems, this line of investigation is of limited value in respect of its implications {{for the management of}} interictal problems. In the latter case it is proposed that organic factors may be considered to be a risk factor. In addition, the negative psychosocial sequelae of a diagnosis of epilepsy can result in conditions which are likely to foster the development of inappropriate behaviours. Learning theory would further suggest that environmental contingencies {{have a role to play}} in the shaping and maintenance of such behaviours. This broader framework for conceptualising the development and maintenance of interictal behaviour disorders has clear management implications. Clinical examples of the successful application of this approach to the management of persistent behavioural problems in two young people with epilepsy are presented...|$|R
40|$|Succinic semialdehyde {{dehydrogenase}} (SSADH) {{is involved}} in the final degradation step of the inhibitory neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid by converting succinic semialdehyde to succinic acid in the mitochondrial matrix. SSADH deficiency, a rare autosomal recessive disease, exhibits variable clinical phenotypes, including psychomotor retardation, language delay, <b>behaviour</b> <b>disturbance</b> and convulsions. Here, we present crystal structures of both the oxidized and reduced forms of human SSADH. Interestingly, the structures show that the catalytic loop of the enzyme undergoes large structural changes depending on the redox status of the environment, which is mediated by a reversible disulphide bond formation between a catalytic Cys 340 and an adjacent Cys 342 residues located on the loop. Subsequent in vivo and in vitro studies reveal that the ‘dynamic catalytic loop' confers a response to reactive oxygen species and changes in redox status, indicating that the redox-switch modulation could be a physiological control mechanism of human SSADH. Structural basis for the substrate specificity of the enzyme and the impact of known missense point mutations associated with the disease pathogenesis are presented as well...|$|R

40|$|In this {{investigation}} 17 horses which show stereotypic walking, were observed directly during {{one week in}} summer and one week in winter. The daily observation started just before feeding {{in the morning and}} ended when there was no activity in the stable in the evening. Additional data from altogether 61 horses were raised by questionnaire. The aim {{of the study was to}} describe the stereotypic behaviour and to receive indications about environmental factors effecting the behaviour as well as causes of the stereotypy. The postal questionnaire that was sent to riding-, breeding- and racing-stables in the region Berlin-Brandenburg at the beginning of the study obtained a resonance of 41, 2 %. Additionally owners of box-walking horses contacted the author after the publication of two magazine articles and the presentation of the project in the Internet. Altogether a prevalence of 1, 3 % could be determined for stereotypic walking. Stereotypic walking takes place along a straight or circular route, the former being observed more frequently. Usually the horses turn to the fence when changing the walking direction, the head being more or less turned toward the fence. In the box the horses wind themselves to a certain extent back and forth. The observed horses showed stall-circling predominantly in clockwise direction. Completely calm walking could be observed as well as nervous and excited pacing. A diversion, although brief, by external attractions during the execution of the stereotypy could be observed. Only with 41, 2 % of the horses stereotypic walking actually takes place only in the box. Therefore the term `box-walking´ is regarded as unsuitable for the <b>behaviour</b> <b>disturbance.</b> Instead the term `stereotypic walking&# 180; is proposed. For all horses the portion of the <b>behaviour</b> <b>disturbance</b> of the total observed time hardly differs between the winter and the summer observation period. In some cases the portion of the stereotypy of the time budget was higher in summer, in others during the winter observation. A maximum of the stereotypic activity is registered in winter in the afternoon, when most activity in the stable prevails. A second peak can be observed in the morning, at the time when the horses are brought on the paddock or the pasture and when stable work takes place. During the summer observation the maximum of stereotypic activity is in the morning. There is another rise in the afternoon which is lower, however, than in winter. In this study a correlation between the occurrence of stereotypy and the race of the horses could be shown. The prevalence of stereotypic walking was higher in Thoroughbred horses than in ponies. Questions about the character and temperament of the animals resulted, however, in no indication for a predisposition for the development of stereotypy. The portion of stallions among the stereotypic animals appears very high. An increased occurrence of stereotypic walking for specific utilizations of the horses could not be determined. Likewise no accumulation within a certain age range could be found. The number of horses on the yard as well as the quantity of fed hay had no effect on the incidence of the abnormal behaviour, either. A vast majority of the affected horses has access to a paddock and/or a pasture. With over 60 % of the horses the beginning of stereotypic walking could not be determined. For the remaining animals the first time in stable, weaning, the beginning of the training, the separation from grazing pals or a stable change were indicated as a cause. Beside this in several horses the stereotypy started during a longer period when the horse had to stay in the box. Altogether 24 % of the registered stereotypic activities (stereotypic walking and/or weaving) were related to an environmental event. In the remaining cases a connection was only to be assumed. A factor related to the prevalence of abnormal behaviour in all horses could not be found. Stereotypic walking arose particularly in situations that are connected with a high level of arousal for the horse, like the appearance of the owner, general unrest in the stable, feeding or taking horses out of the stable. The effectiveness of changes in the management for the therapy of the <b>behaviour</b> <b>disturbance</b> could not be judged clearly. A medicinal therapy was conducted with none of the animals. Preventing the movement by tying up led only in one case to a reduction of the stereotypy, no horse began to weave. In all horses the stereotypy was generally very hard or impossible to influence. With the eight animals whose <b>behaviour</b> <b>disturbance,</b> according to statements of the owners, led to damage to the animal, one must assume a disturbed well-being of the animals. In all other respects the stereotypy can be seen as a pattern which helps the animal to cope with an environment which is or was not optimal for the animal. Therefore an animal should not be prevented from the execution of the stereotypy as long as no damage develops, in order to avoid further motivation conflicts. One should try, however, to reduce stereotypy by changes in the management that are individually matched to causes that have been determined. <br /...|$|R

Method: Nursing home residents referred to six psychogeriatric and geriatric outreach services for treatment of VDB were examined pre- treatment and followed-up for three months by a research nurse. All recommended treatments for VDB {{and the effects of}} implementation were recorded. Main outcome measures were the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia, the Dementia <b>Behaviour</b> <b>Disturbance</b> Scale and measures of nurse satisfaction. Results: Three-month outcome data was available for 22 residents, of whom four had died. Of the remainder, six (33 %) had objective improvement in VDB. The nursing home staff rated the outreach teams as at least ‘somewhat’ helpful in 61 % of cases surviving three months and was particularly satisfied with medication advice. No specific treatment appeared to be more effective. Conclusions: Reduction in VDB obtained through interventions by psychogeriatric and geriatric outreach teams was modest, but nursing home staff found most of the teams to be helpful. Aged care outreach services should provide support to nursing home staff in the management of challenging behaviours. 5 page(s...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: There {{is a lack}} {{of clear}} and {{explicit}} models of the way various family and social influences on children's behaviour interact with factors such as temperament to produce <b>behaviour</b> <b>disturbance</b> in young children. METHOD: The following measures had been obtained on a total population sample of 1047 families with a 3 -year-old child: the child's perceived cuddliness, difficult temperament, mother's unhappy childhood, maternal <b>disturbance,</b> social class, <b>behaviour</b> problems and overactivity. A latent variable analysis using the LISREL 7 program was applied to the data. RESULTS: A model that allowed the latent variables child 'temperament' and 'mother's mental state' to have separate additive effects on 'child adaptation' proved an excellent fit (goodness of fit index = 0. 956). This model suggests that there is a common factor ('child adaptation') underlying behaviour problems and overactivity. Using this model 72 % of child adaptation in boys could be explained. For girls however temperament and mother's mental state accounted for only 30 % of the variance in child adaptation. CONCLUSION: There is a need to investigate different mechanisms for the origins of behaviour problems in preschool boys and girls...|$|R

Five categories of caregiver behaviours were identified from the qualitative data: gathering information about treatment, symptoms, and health care; obtaining support; responding to behaviour disturbances; managing household, personal, and medical care; and managing distress associated with caregiving. The challenges of caregiving were also identified, including deterioration of care recipients, particularly their <b>behaviour</b> <b>disturbances,</b> a shortage of supportive resources, stigmatization of dementia among the general population, as well as increased distress and decreased social activities due to increased care demand.

40|$|This {{retrospective}} file {{study investigated}} the results of various types of status epilepticus (SE) in the Netherlands. We evaluated 576 adult patients and 112 children. The diagnosis of SE appeared wrong in about 20 % of the cases. In both adults (346) and children (82) with generalized convulsive status epilepticus (GCSE) the results were especially determined by the underlying cause, but also by duration of SE, the presence of more than 1 medical complication {{and the quality of}} treatment. It can be estimated that in the Netherlands every year 24 adult patients will die and 10 patients will develop morbidity, caused by inadequate therapy of GCSE. Treatment according to protocol may prevent this. In 65 adult patients with non-convulsive status epilepticus the results were also especially determined by the underlying cause; inadequate treatment contributed to morbidity in three patients with complex partial status epilepticus (CPSE). In one adult patient with CPSE the longlasting discharges themselves caused morbidity (memory deficit). Stroke appeared the main cause of simple partial status epilepticus (SPSE) in 47 adult patients, with corresponding poor outcome. It was striking that in 20 % of the patients with previous epilepsy a new acute neurological cause of SPSE could be found. In one patient morbidity appeared to be caused by the epileptic discharges themselves. In children we also studied the results of continuous epileptic discharges during sleep in two syndromes, characterized by severe cognitive decline and <b>behaviour</b> <b>disturbances.</b> The syndromes are known as Continuous Spikes and Waves during Sleep (CSWS) and Landau-Kleffner Syndrome (LKS). The results in the ten children we studied were poor, mainly determined by the long duration of the continuous nocturnal epileptic discharges.

We obtained 369 sets of teacher ratings and 226 parent ratings. Our parent ratings generally reflected less disturbance than did parent ratings in the national samples reported by Meltzer and colleagues (Meltzer, Gatward, Corbin, Goodman, & Ford, 2003; Meltzer, Gatward, Goodman, & Ford, 2000). Our teacher ratings reflected similar levels of disturbance to teacher ratings in the national sample, except that the older boys in this sample were rated as more disturbed by their teachers. Teacher ratings of disturbance were associated with perceived Special Educational Needs (SENs), and {{it was noted that}} statutory remedial help was said to be needed particularly urgently for older boys. In this community there is negligible statutory educational funding and remedial support for older boys is said to be particularly under-resourced.

40|$|SUMMARY. Maternal smoking during {{pregnancy}} {{is considered to}} be one of the most significant causes of complications in pregnancy and is associated with an unfavourable outcome in childbirth compared with pregnancy in non-smokers. Specifically, smoking {{during pregnancy}} increases the likelihood of placenta praevia, abruptio placentae, ectopic gestation and premature rupture of the membranes (PRM). In addition, research has established that smoking during pregnancy increases the rates of low birth weight (LBW), perinatal mortality, premature birth and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). As these children grow up they present a variety of health problems, including respiratory illness, <b>behaviour</b> <b>disturbances,</b> attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and high arterial blood pressure. LBW is also associated with an increased incidence of health problems in the neonatal period. Effects have been documented of maternal smoking during pregnancy on the future fertility of male infants and the occurrence of congenital abnormalities, and a connection has been reported between daily maternal smoking in early pregnancy and infantile autism.

Among the solutions investigated to reduce fish stress, domestication and selection {{appear to be}} the favoured approaches. This thesis has two main goals: 1) Identify the main behavioural characteristics of the European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) in rearing conditions, and 2) Analyse <b>behaviour</b> <b>disturbances</b> induced by stress on animals, which genetic origin is known, to evaluate the influence of domestication and selection on adaptability and their welfare potential. A study carried out on fish presenting the common domestication state found in sea bass farms in Europe, has allowed the characterisation of "standards" self-feeding behaviour, growth potential, physiological status and also {{a better understanding of the}} social structure in this species. Studies on stress effects showed a set of common responses for fish originating from different levels of domestication and/or selection for growth but also that the process of domestication seems to improve fish learning and environmental adaptation, and the process of selection for growth seems to promote animals with regular feeding rhythms throughout the day, high exploration capacities in new environment and variable growth over time.

40|$|This {{manuscript}} is original, has {{not been}} previously published and is not under concurrent consideration elsewhere. Objective: A wide range of behavioural and psychological symptoms (BPSD) are common in dementia, {{and it has been}} suggested that groups of correlated symptoms should be studied together. Here, we describe the groups of BPSD that have been identified in the literature and how they have been used to study associations, burden, treatment and underlying biology. Methods: The literature database PubMed was searched for articles that identified clusters or factors of BPSD or used previously defined symptom groups. Results: Sixty-two studies were included. Generally, the following symptom groups were suggested: affective symptoms, including depression and anxiety; psychosis, including delusions and hallucinations; hyperactivity, including irritability and aggression; and euphoria. Symptoms that did not show consistent results include apathy, eating disturbances, night-time <b>behaviour</b> <b>disturbances,</b> disinhibition and aberrant motor behaviour. Symptom groups differed in their associations, treatment and biology. Conclusions: Studies investigating symptomgroups show relatively consistent results. Studying symptomgroups allows similar symptoms to be studied together, which might strengthen results and may point to differences in their aetiology and treatment. However, a large amount of the individual variability of the symptoms could no...|$|E

40|$|Background: Smith–Magenis {{syndrome}} (SMS) (OMIM No 182290) is {{a mental}} retardation syndrome characterised by behavioural abnormalities, including self injurious <b>behaviours,</b> sleep <b>disturbance,</b> and distinct craniofacial and skeletal anomalies. It is {{usually associated with}} deletion involving 17 p 11. 2 and is estimated to occur in 1 / 25 000 births. Heterozygous frameshift mutations leading to protein truncation in retinoic acid induced 1 gene (RAI 1) {{have been identified in}} individuals with phenotypic features consistent with SMS. RAI 1 lies within the 17 p 11. 2 locus, but these patients did not have 17 p 11. 2 deletions...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the prevalence of disruptive behaviour displayed by older people in community and residential respite care settings. The specific objectives were to (i) obtain an estimate of the frequency of disruptive behaviour displayed by older people in the community setting before residential respite care; (ii) characterize older people being admitted for residential respite care; and (iii) obtain an estimate of the frequency of disruptive behaviour displayed by older people in residential respite care. A quantitative approach using a cross-sectional survey was employed in the community and in the residential aged care facilities. The older people (n = 100) had a mean age of 81. 8 years (range 66 – 96 years). The older people were being admitted from their homes for booked respite care at residential aged care facilities in a regional Australian city. Home caregivers and nurses rated disruptive behaviour using the Dementia <b>Behaviour</b> <b>Disturbance</b> Scale (DBDS). Reliability data for the DBDS are provided. As expected, in both community and residential respite settings, older people with dementia (29 %) scored significantly higher on the DBDS than people without dementia. In addition, DBDS scores were unexpectedly higher in the community setting than in the respite setting. These findings should be taken into consideration by primary health-care professionals when offering treatment options to the home caregivers and by staff in the residential aged care facilities that offer respite...|$|R
