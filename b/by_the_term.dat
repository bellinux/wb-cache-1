5|$|In {{works from}} Jeux vénitiens, Lutosławski wrote long {{passages}} {{in which the}} parts of the ensemble are not to be synchronised exactly. At cues from the conductor each instrumentalist may be instructed to move straight on to the next section, to finish their current section before moving on, or to stop. In this way the random elements within compositionally controlled limits defined <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> aleatory are carefully directed by the composer, who controls the architecture and harmonic progression of the piece precisely. Lutosławski notated the music exactly; there is no improvisation, no choice of parts is given to any instrumentalist, and there is thus no doubt about how the musical performance is to be realised.|$|E
5|$|The Little Mermaid vigorously relaunched a {{profound}} {{new interest in}} the animation and musical film genres. The film {{was also the first}} to feature the use of Disney's Computer Animation Production System (CAPS). Developed for Disney by Pixar, which had grown into a commercial computer animation and technology development company, CAPS would become significant in allowing future Disney films to more seamlessly integrate computer-generated imagery and achieve higher production values with digital ink and paint and compositing techniques. The Little Mermaid was {{the first of a series}} of blockbusters that would be released over the next decade by Walt Disney Feature Animation, a period later designated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> Disney Renaissance.|$|E
5|$|In 616, Rædwald {{defeated}} {{and killed}} Æthelfrith of Northumbria in the Battle of the River Idle and then installed Edwin {{as the new}} Deiran king. Whilst Edwin had been an exile at Rædwald's court, {{he had had a}} dream where he was told that if he converted to Christianity, he would become greater than any that had ruled before him. Steven Plunkett relates that, according to the version of events as told in the Whitby Life of St Gregory, it was Paulinus who visited Edwin and obtained his promise to convert to Christianity in return for regal power. After Edwin emerged as the ruler of Deira, with its centre at York, he became accepted as king of the northern Northumbrian province of Bernicia. Following his victory over the Northumbrians, Rædwald was not only king of the East Angles, but also the most powerful king amongst the rulers of the various English kingdoms, occupying the role which was later described <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> Bretwalda. He is thought by many to have been buried in the sumptuous ship burial at Sutton Hoo.|$|E

5|$|Motion {{camouflage}} is camouflage {{which provides}} a degree of concealment for a moving object, given that motion makes objects easy to detect however well their coloration matches their background or breaks up their outlines. The principal form of motion camouflage, and the type generally meant <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>term,</b> involves an attacker's mimicking the optic flow of the background as seen by its target. This enables the attacker to approach the target while appearing to remain stationary from the target's perspective, unlike in classical pursuit. The attacker chooses its flight path so as {{to remain on the}} line between the target and some landmark point. The target therefore does not see the attacker move from the landmark point. The only visible evidence that the attacker is moving is its looming, the change in size as the attacker approaches. Motion is also used in a variety of other camouflage strategies, including swaying to mimic plant movements in the wind or ocean currents.|$|E
