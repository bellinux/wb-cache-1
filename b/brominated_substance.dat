The original publication {{is available at}} [URL] new type of antimicrobial, biocompatible and toughness enhanced ultra-thin fiber mats for biomedical applications is presented. The tough and porous fiber mats were obtained by electrospinning solution-blended poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and polyethylene oxide (PEO), filled with up to 25 wt % of Lanasol—a naturally occurring brominated cyclic compound that can be extracted from red sea algae. Antibacterial effectiveness was tested following the industrial Standard JIS L 1902 and under agitated medium (ASTM E 2149). Even at the lowest concentrations of Lanasol, 4 wt %, a significant bactericidal effect was seen with a 4 -log (99. 99 %) reduction in bacterial viability against S. aureus, {{which is one of}} the leading causes of hospital-acquired (nosocomial) infections in the world. The mechanical fiber toughness was insignificantly altered up to the maximum Lanasol concentration tested, and was for all fiber mats orders of magnitudes higher than electrospun fibers based on solely PMMA. This antimicrobial fiber system, relying on a dissolved antimicrobial agent (demonstrated by X-ray diffraction and Infrared (IR) -spectroscopy) rather than a dispersed and “mixed-in” solid antibacterial particle phase, presents a new concept which opens the door to tougher, stronger and more ductile antimicrobial fibers.

40|$|Abstract This study investigates four {{halogenated}} substances; three polyfluorinated {{compounds and}} one <b>brominated</b> <b>substance.</b> The polyfluorinated compounds, namely 6 : 2 fluorotelomer alcohol (6 : 2 FTOH), 8 : 2 fluorotelomer alcohol (8 : 2 FTOH) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), are widespread anthropogenic compounds, {{used in a}} variety of consumer products due to their water-, grease- and stain-repellent property. Levels of PFOA in human blood are typically around 5 ppb (0. 01 μM), while FTOHs so far not have been measured in human samples due to technical difficulties. One of the main effect of PFOA in laboratory animals and in in vitro experiments is an induction of peroxisomal proliferation, leading to increased oxidation of fat, changed expression of a variety of genes, and increased cell proliferation, possibly inducing cancer development, both in the liver and in the pancreas and testicle. PFOA is also a reproductive toxicant, changes membrane architecture, and inhibits the effluent transporter Pgp. Several {{of the effects of the}} FTOHs are similar to those observed after PFOA exposure and several of the genes that show altered expression after PFOA exposure are also changed after exposure to 8 : 2 FTOH. Effects of 8 : 2 FTOH exposure include hepatocellular necrosis and peroxisomal proliferation, as well as detrimental effects on development in mice. Both 6 : 2 and 8 : 2 FTOH have been shown to act as xenoestrogens in vitro. We evaluated the effect of 6 : 2, 8 : 2 FTOH and PFOA on testicular cells from Wistar rats. Testicular cells were exposed in vitro to concentrations up to 300 μM for one hour. No signs of cytotoxicity were observed. The level of single strand breaks, abasic sites and oxidized purines was not increased, either. Whether the expression of the breast cancer resistant protein (Bcrp 1) was altered, remains unsure due to high variability between experimental runs. One major weakness in these experiments is the use of a relatively short exposure time, making it very difficult to draw conclusions. Since the tested concentrations are many magnitudes higher than exposure in the general population, the data have nonetheless predictive value. Taken together, the results suggest that the tested PFCs do not exhibit testicular toxicity. The brominated compound 1, 2 -dibromo- 3 -chloropropane (DBCP) is known to induce permanent or temporary infertility in men, in addition to being a renal toxicant. It also induced DNA damage and acts as a clastogen and mutagen, inducing cancer development. The DNA inducing effect of DBCP on three testicular cell types was evaluated; Sertoli cells and other somatic cells seem to be the most sensitive cell type, spermatogonia the least sensitive, and spermatids seem to have a medium sensitivity. However whether the results obtained in experiments with somatic cells are correct is quite uncertain due to prolonged perincubation time. The repair capacity in spermatogonia and spermatids was also examined; spermatogonia were found to repair DNA damage induced by DBCP somehow faster than spermatids. Taken together, the results suggest that it may be the supporting cells like Sertoli cells that get heaviest damaged by DBCP. The damage in these cells can then lead to impaired germ cell development by interfering with the supply of nutrition, testosterone and other supporting functions. Spermatogonia appear to be least sensitive and repair the induced DNA damage relatively effectively. Since these cells are located outside of the blood-testis barrier these efficient defense mechanisms are very meaningful...|$|E

40|$|In the eutrophicated Baltic Sea, several {{naturally}} produced hydroxylated polybrominated diphenyl ethers (OH-PBDEs) {{have been}} found in marine biota. OH-PBDEs are toxic to adult and developing zebrafish and shown to be potent disruptors of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Disturbed OXPHOS can result in altered energy metabolism and weight loss. In herring, the concentration of OH-PBDEs (i. e. 2 '-OH-BDE 68 and 6 -OH-BDE 47) has increased during the period 1980 - 2010 in the Baltic Proper. Over the same time period, the condition and fat content in Baltic herring have decreased.

The ship's track between northern Japan and Singapore traversed three climatic zones of the northern hemisphere. Recently polluted air, clean marine air derived from the central Pacific Ocean from different latitudes, and marine air from the Indonesian archipelago were collected. Tetrachloroethene and trichloroethene of anthropogenic origin, brominated halocarbons as tribromomethane, dibromochloromethane and bromodichloromethane of anthropogenic and natural sources, and other trace gases were measured in the air samples. Very sparse data {{on the distribution of}} these compounds exist for the western Pacific atmosphere. The distribution patterns of the compounds were related to synoptic-scale meteorology, spatial conditions, and origin of the air masses. Anthropogenic and natural sources for both chlorinated and <b>brominated</b> <b>substances</b> were identified. Tetrachloroethene and trichloroethene concentrations and their ratios identify anthropogenic sources. Their mixing ratios were quite low compared to previously published data. They are in agreement with expected low concentrations of photochemically active substances during autumn, with an overall decrease in concentrations toward lower latitudes, and with a decrease of emissions during recent years. Strong evidence for a natural source of trichloroethene was discovered in the tropical region. The concentrations of naturally released brominated species were high compared to other measurements over the Pacific.

40|$|AbstractLong-tailed ducks (Clangula hyemalis) that {{breed in}} {{northern}} Europe and western Siberia and commonly {{winter in the}} Baltic Sea, are threatened by a significant population decrease. The ducks are, by primarily feeding on Baltic blue mussels (Mytilus trossulus × Mytilus edulis) while wintering in the Baltic Sea, potentially subjected {{to high levels of}} toxic hydroxylated polybrominated diphenyl ethers (OH-PBDEs). To assess long-tailed ducks exposure to polybrominated phenols (PBPs), polybrominated anisoles (PBAs), hydroxylated polybrominated diphenyl ethers (OH-PBDEs), their methylated counterparts (MeO-PBDEs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), livers of ten long-tailed ducks wintering in the Baltic Sea were analysed. Pattern and levels of analytes in long-tailed ducks (liver) and blue mussels sampled in March and May at nine sites in the Baltic Sea were compared. The geometric mean concentration (ng/g l. w.) in livers of long-tailed ducks and Baltic blue mussels were: Σ 2 PBPs: 0. 57 and 48; Σ 2 PBAs: 0. 83 and 11; Σ 7 OH-PBDEs: 6. 1 and 45; Σ 7 MeO-PBDEs: 3. 8 and 69; Σ 7 PBDEs: 8. 0 and 7. 2, respectively.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{toxicity}} and occurrence of hydroxylated polybrominated diphenyl ethers (OH-PBDEs) in Baltic Sea biota. The aims were to assess OH-PBDEs potency for disruption of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and determine their and related compounds exposure in Baltic blue mussel, herring and long-tailed duck. A method {{for analysis of}} OH-PBDEs in herring and long-tailed duck plasma was also evaluated. Relevant OH-PBDEs were tested in vitro for OXPHOS disruption, using a classic rat mitochondrial respiration assay and a cell mitochondrial membrane potential assay. All compounds were found to disrupt OXPHOS either by protonophoric uncoupling and/or via inhibition of the electron transport chain. 6 -OH-BDE 47 and 6 -OH-BDE 85, were identified as particularly potent OXPHOS disruptors. Strong synergism was observed when OH-PBDEs were tested as a mixture corresponding to what is present in Baltic blue mussels. Baltic blue mussel is main feed for several species of mussel feeding sea ducks which have decreased dramatically in numbers. To assess long-tailed ducks exposure to <b>brominated</b> <b>substances,</b> liver tissue from long-tailed ducks wintering in the Baltic Sea and blue mussels were analysed. The result confirms that long-tailed duck are exposed to OH-PBDEs via their diet. However, low concentrations {{were found in the}} duck livers, which suggest low retention of these compounds despite daily intake. How the nutritional value of blue mussels as feed for sea ducks are affected by OH-PBDE exposure still needs further studies. Other species of sea ducks foraging on Baltic blue mussels during summer months can also be more exposed due to seasonal variation in primary production. Herring sampled in the Baltic Proper and Bothnian Sea, were found to contain OH-PBDEs and high levels of their methylated counterpart, MeO-PBDEs. As demethylation of MeO-PBDEs is known to occur in fish, MeO-PBDEs may pose as additional source for more toxic OH-PBDEs in herring and their roe.

Within this framework we analyze the impact of dehydration and deep convection on the amount of stratospheric bromine using an idealized and a detailed full chemistry approach. We model the two most important <b>brominated</b> short-lived <b>substances,</b> bromoform (CHBr 3) and dibromomethane (CH 2 Br 2), assuming a uniform convective detrainment mixing ratio of 1 part per trillion by volume (pptv) for both species.

In the latter case virtually the entire amount of bromine originating from very short-lived source gases is able to reach the stratosphere thus rendering the impact of dehydration and scavenging on inorganic bromine in the tropopause insignificant. Furthermore, our long-term calculations show that the mixing ratios of very short-lived substances are strongly correlated to convective activity, i. e. intensified convection leads to higher amounts of very short-lived substances in the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere especially under extreme conditions like El Niño seasons. However, this does not apply to the inorganic brominated product gases whose concentrations are anti-correlated to convective activity mainly due to convective dilution and possible scavenging, depending on the applied approach...|$|R

The external exposure of cats to these compounds from house dust and their food was also investigated. The analytical methodology used for serum extractions was validated {{for analysis of}} OH-PBDEs in cat serum. Cats are highly exposed to dust and thereby also to chemicals accumulated in dust, due to their grooming behavior. This makes pet cats, a suitable biomarker for exposure to chemicals in house dust in home environments. Thereby, cats’ exposure to dust is somewhat similar to toddlers, due their hand-to-mouth behavior. Thus, cats’ internal exposure {{may be used to}} access that of toddlers. The PBDE pattern in Swedish pet cats show exposure to Penta-, Octa- and DecaBDE and their profile matches that of dust from their homes, suggesting dust to be an important exposure source. Serum concentrations of BDE- 47 in the cats were also shown to correlate with house dust from their living rooms. Feline hyperthyroidism (FH) is a common endocrine disease in elderly cats worldwide, still the actual cause(s) has not been established even though environmental pollutants such as PBDEs have been suggested. Difference in contamination load between cats with normal thyroid status and cats diagnosed with FH was performed and higher serum concentrations for some PBDEs (BDE- 99, 153, - 183) were found in the hyperthyroid cats. Further, the presence of the longtime discontinued flame retardant, decabromobiphenyl (BB- 209) in all sampled cats indicates that it is still being circulated. A significant correlation between serum concentrations of BB- 209 and matched cat food samples was found. Very few OH-PBDEs were indeed shown in cat serum and the dominating compound, 6 -OH-BDE 47, is believed to be of natural origin rather than being a metabolite of BDE- 47.

40|$|<b>Brominated</b> very {{short-lived}} <b>substances</b> (BrVSLS) are atmospherically important trace gases {{that play}} an important role in stratospheric ozone destruction. Major BrVSLS including bromoform (CHBr_(3)), dibromomethane (CH_(2) Br_(2)), chlorodibromomethane (CHClBr_(2)), and bromodichloromethane (CHBrCl_(2)) are thought to be predominately formed naturally via vanadium bromoperoxidase (V-BrPO) mediated halogenation of organic matter (OM). The objective of this research was to couple field observations and laboratory experiments to understand global distributions, saturation anomalies, fluxes, and identify natural sources of BrVSLS. All the trace gases were measured with gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Field observations were conducted in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Results from field observations showed that BrVSLS tend to be elevated in biologically active waters, such as coastal waters, the productive surface open ocean, and at chlorophyll maximum depths. The production of natural BrVSLS is likely controlled by complex biogeochemical factors in the ecosystems. CH_(2) Br_(2) was thought to be derived from the same source(s) as CHBr_(3), but results presented in this dissertation suggest they may in fact be derived from disparate sources. Screening for important BrVSLS producers was attempted in the laboratory. Only 2 out of 9 phytoplankton species screened show observable BrVSLS production. CH_(2) Br_(2) production was only observed in 1 species screened. Chloroperoxidase-like activity in diatom was observed for the first time, which provided evidence for biological production of chloroform (CHCl_(3)). The role of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in controlling BrVSLS production was investigated in the laboratory. Production of BrVSLS varied significantly with different model DOM compounds upon V-BrPO mediated halogenation. Certain DOM enhanced BrVSLS production, but the majority of the model DOM compounds tested in this study either interfered with or had no observable effect on BrVSLS production. Further evidences showed that V-BrPO mediated halogenation can alter DOM chemical characteristics. Alteration of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in terms of ?bio-bleaching? was observed in model lignin phenol compounds and CDOM collected from two cyanobacterial cultures. Results from this study suggest that the presence of V-BrPO producing phytoplankton is essential for enhanced BrVSLS production, as V-BrPO induced brominated reactive species, such as hypobromous acid (HOBrenz), is required. However, BrVSLS production rates are largely controlled by other biogeochemical factors in seawater, such as DOM composition. Results from this study also suggest that V-BrPO activity not only plays an essential role in BrVSLS production, but it also plays a significant role in the transformation of DOM and may be a significant component of the marine carbon cycle...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{investigate}} distributions of 32 volatile chlorinated and/or brominated halocarbons that are currently believed {{to be present in}} the tropical upper troposphere and stratosphere and to contribute to stratospheric ozone depletion and also to global warming. For this purpose an analytical system was established, which is capable to measure ultra-low concentrated atmospheric trace gases. A quadrupole Mass Spectrometric (MS) Detector was attached to an existing Gas Chromatograph with pre-concentration system and Electron Capture Detector (ECD). The characterisation of the chromatographic system was significantly enhanced by the subsequent identification of 48 additional volatile organic compounds. Furthermore a Gaussian fit algorithm, which was developed in the workgroup, was applied to the chromatographic signals. This algorithm was proven to reflect peaks quantitatively and to enhance the performance of the integration process – especially the reproducibilities for peaks with a low signal to noise ratio. As it is known that the Electron Capture Detector responds nonlinear the new MS detector was checked for such behaviour and found to respond linear. In logical consistency the complete quantification process including e. g. pre-concentration of trace gases and signal integration can be considered as linear responding within the investigated parameter ranges. Moreover, the long term stability of the targeted halocarbons was proven inside the calibration standard containers over a period of 25 months. Many substances were also found to be stable inside the containers used for storage of air samples but a number of substances showed significant concentration changes. These were mainly CH 3 Cl (methyl chloride), CH 3 Br (methyl bromide), CH 2 Cl 2 (dichloromethane), CHCl 3 (chloroform), CCl 4 (tetrachloromethane), C 2 Cl 4 (tetrachloroethene), CH 3 CCl 3 (methyl chloroform), CH 2 ClCH 2 Cl (1, 2 -dichloroethane) und C 2 H 5 Cl (chloroethane). But the number of affected substances and also the corresponding concentration changes varied between the individual containers. A systematic investigation of the influence of possible causes (e. g. air sampling methods, container materials) is recommended. Results from both internal detectors were compared and revealed biases and disadvantages of the ECD caused by its lower selectivity and its nonlinear response behaviour. Consequently the MS detector was chosen for the quantification of atmospheric trace gases. The quantification process was performed relative to externally calibrated air standards. To assess the uncertainties connected with different absolute calibration scales cross-comparisons between calibration standards of three different laboratories were carried out. Most substances’ calibrations agreed within the measurement uncertainties but significant differences were observed for CF 2 ClBr (H 1211), CH 3 Cl (methyl chloride), CH 2 Cl 2 (dichloromethane), CHCl 3 (chloroform), CCl 4 (tetrachloromethane) and CH 3 CCl 3 (methyl chloroform). As five of these substances were also observed to show concentration changes inside sample containers it is likely, that such changes are responsible for calibration differences. In addition to the detailed assessment of uncertainties connected with the analytical quantification process a set of air samples was available for measurements. These samples mainly originated from the upper troposphere and lower and middle stratosphere in the tropics and the determined halocarbon quantities were used to investigate their distributions in the respective atmospheric regions. In detail, the altitudinal distributions and interrelations of 17 long-lived halocarbons in the tropical stratosphere were determined and compared with those of other stratospheric regions. Tracer-tracer-correlations of these substances in the tropical stratosphere were found to differ from those in mid- and high-latitudes. Characteristic fit functions relative to CF 2 Cl 2 (F 12) which are valid for the tropical stratosphere in 2005 were derived as well as time-independent fit functions of fractional release factors (FRFs) relative to the mean age of air. Both sets of correlations could be used for the parameterisation and evaluation of models and also to reassess the Global Warming Potentials (GWPs) of the corresponding halocarbons which might affect future climate predictions. However, the data set on halocarbons in the tropical stratosphere is still insufficient to investigate the variability of tracer-tracer-correlations and FRFs caused by dynamical and photochemical processes. Therefore it is important for future research to perform additional measurements there and – if possible – to extend the measurements to the upper tropical stratosphere in order to characterise the sink of those halocarbons that are still present in these altitudes. In addition, the amount of chlorine and bromine present in the form of organic compounds inside and above the main stratospheric entrance region (the Tropical Tropopause Layer, TTL) was quantified in the frame of a case study. This was possible because of a cooperation with scientists from the University of East Anglia which carried out measurements of six additional halocarbons leading to a total of 28 quantified target substances. Ten of these substances have short atmospheric lifetimes compared with the mean transport times of tropospheric air to the stratosphere (i. e. lifetimes below 0. 5 years) and show non-uniform distributions in the upper troposphere. The contribution of these substances to stratospheric ozone depletion is subject of an ongoing scientific debate. In the performed case study a fraction range of short-lived halocarbons of 6 – 8 % (0. 98 – 1. 25 ppt) relative to the sum of bromine from organic substances and of 1. 1 – 1. 4 % (36. 6 – 47. 1 ppt) for the corresponding sum of chlorine was calculated to enter the stratosphere above Brazil in June 2005. Moreover by combining the data with tropospheric reference data and age of air observations the abundances of inorganic chlorine and bromine (Cly and Bry) were derived. At an altitude of 34 km an amount of 3062 ppt of Cly and 17. 5 ppt of Bry from organic source gases was calculated. The latter is significantly lower than Bry mixing ratios inferred from quasisimultaneous BrO measurements at 33 km altitude above Brazil (Dorf, 2005, Dorf et al., 2008). But at the University of East Anglia indications for the presence of unknown <b>brominated</b> organic <b>substances</b> in the TTL were found which might cause this difference. Finally, a major result of this thesis adds to the knowledge of the composition of the troposphere as three Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) were first observed. Trifluorochloroethene, 3 -chloropentafluoropropene and 4, 4 -dichlorohexafluoro- 1 -butene were found in air samples collected at the Taunus Observatory near Frankfurt (Main) and the Jungfraujoch High Altitude Research Station in Switzerland (Laube and Engel, 2008). Identification was possible because of an air plume containing high concentrations of these substances. It is suggested that the abundances found on this occasion originated from a local source. The atmospheric lifetimes of these substances are expected to be rather short as they contain a double bond. A quantitative calibration could only be derived for trifluorochloroethene but not for the other species by now. Thus, a relative sensitivity method was derived to get a first indication of the observed atmospheric abundances. All three CFCs could also be detected in air masses representative of background conditions, though with much lower concentrations. These species and some of their degradation products are toxic and could also be relevant for stratospheric and tropospheric ozone depletion. It is important {{to find out more about}} their atmospheric distributions, lifetimes, sinks and sources and their ability to reach the stratosphere to assess their possible influence on the global atmosphere. This will be done in the frame of the project "CLEARFOGG – Checking Layers of the Earths AtmospheRe For halogenated Ozone-depleting and Greenhouse Gases". This research project aims to perform a systematic scan of the atmosphere because there are indications for the presence of a number of halogenated organic compounds which are unknown by now. It was recently decided to be funded by the British National Environmental Research Council and will be carried out at the University of East Anglia mainly by the author of this thesis. Das Ziel dieser Arbeit war die Untersuchung der Verteilung von 32 flüchtigen halogenierten Kohlenwasserstoffen in der oberen Troposphäre sowie unteren und mittleren Stratosphäre in den Tropen. Die Zielsubstanzen waren 32 chlorierte und/oder bromierte Kohlenwasserstoffe, die bereits in der oberen tropischen Troposphäre (der stratosphärischen Haupteintragsregion) nachgewiesen worden sind und somit nicht nur nicht nur zur globalen Erwärmung sondern auch zum stratosphärischen Ozonabbau beitragen können (WMO, 2007, IPCC, 2007). Es existieren bisher nur sehr wenige Beobachtungen von Halogenkohlenwasserstoffen in der tropischen Stratosphäre. Diese sind zum Teil veraltet (z. B. Goldan et al., 1980) oder beschränken sich auf die untere Stratosphäre (z. B. Volk et al., 1997, Schauffler et al., 1999). Die chemische Zusammensetzung der tropischen Stratosphäre beeinflusst jedoch den dortigen Strahlungshaushalt und somit das Klima dieses Planeten. Deswegen war es äußerst wichtig, die Höhenverteilungen von Halogenkohlenwasserstoffen in dieser atmosphärischen Region zu charakterisieren. Für die Untersuchung der Verteilungen wurde zunächst ein analytisches System zur Messung von äußerst gering konzentrierten atmosphärischen Spurengasen aufgebaut. Ein existierendes Gas-Chromatographie-System (GC) mit kryogener Anreicherungseinheit und einem Elektronen-Einfang-Detektor (ECD) wurde um ein|$|R
