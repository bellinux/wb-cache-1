5|$|His parents' {{marriage}} {{dissolved in}} July 1888, when Max Döblin eloped with Henriette Zander, a seamstress twenty years his junior, {{and moved to}} America {{to start a new}} life. The catastrophic loss of his father was a central event in Döblin's childhood and would be formative for his later life. Shortly thereafter, in October 1888, Sophie and the five children moved to Berlin and took up residence in a small shabby apartment on the Blumenstraße in Berlin's working-class east. Döblin's parents briefly reconciled in 1889, when Max returned penniless from America; the family moved to Hamburg in April 1889, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> light that Max had brought his lover back with him and was leading a double life, Sophie and the children returned to Berlin in September 1889.|$|E

25|$|Meir {{stated in}} the 1975 edition of her {{autobiography}} My Life that “It {{is not only a}} matter, I believe, of religious observance and practice. To me, being Jewish means and has always meant being proud {{to be part of a}} people that has maintained its distinct identity for more than 2,000 years, with all the pain and torment that has been inflicted upon it.” Meir strongly identified with Judaism culturally, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> her religious beliefs she was an atheist.|$|E
25|$|<b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> {{expansion}} {{in other parts}} of the world, namely Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, then totally new cultural dynamics had entered into the equation, so to speak, and one sees here of what was to take the Americas, South East Asia, and the Pacific by storm a few hundred years later. The idea that peoples who possessed cultural customs and racial appearances strikingly different from those of the colonizing power is no new idea borne out of the Medieval period or the Enlightenment.|$|E
25|$|In the 1930s, Armand Denis made {{films that}} {{told the world}} about Africa. However, his {{documentary}} gave fanciful stories about Rwanda's Tutsis being a noble ruling elite originally from Egypt, whereas the Hutus were a peasant race. In reality, they were racially the same, and the Belgian rulers had ruthlessly exploited the myth. <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> independence, liberal Belgians felt guilty, and decided the Hutus should overthrow the Tutsi rule. This led to a bloodbath, as the Tutsis were then seen as aliens and were slaughtered.|$|E

25|$|Johnson {{initially}} {{had nearly}} 5,000 colonials at his command, but General William Shirley, {{the governor of}} Massachusetts who had been commissioned to lead a simultaneous expedition to Fort Niagara, shifted some of Johnson's men and resources to his own campaign. Tensions escalated as the two generals worked {{against each other in}} recruiting Native allies. The dispute was complicated by the unusual command structure: as Braddock's second-in-command, General Shirley was Johnson's superior officer, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> Indian affairs, Johnson was theoretically in charge. In time, Shirley would blame the failure of his expedition on Johnson's refusal to provide him with adequate Indian support. According to the Johnson biographer Milton Hamilton, historians usually portrayed Johnson as acting unreasonably in the controversy with Shirley, but Hamilton argued that Johnson was reacting to Shirley's clumsy Indian diplomacy, which harmed the British relationship with the Six Nations.|$|E
25|$|During the {{campaign}} for the Act of Union, both Castlereagh and Cornwallis had, in good faith, forwarded informal assurances they had received from Pitt's Cabinet to the Irish Catholics {{that they would be}} allowed to sit in Parliament. Both Castlereagh and Cornwallis knew Catholic emancipation would be critical if their objectives for Union were to be realised. Emancipation was, however, opposed by much of the British establishment, including George III, who was convinced that it would violate his royal oath as protector of the Protestant faith. Pitt tried to follow through on his commitment, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> light that the King had approached Henry Addington, an opponent of Catholic emancipation, about becoming Prime Minister to replace the pro-emancipation Pitt, both Castlereagh and Pitt resigned in protest. Castlereagh would long be held personally responsible by many Catholics in Ireland for the breach of promise and the British Government's betrayal of their rights.|$|E

In the first episode, Holman stated that Amy's identity was not clear and she wore her own clothes later on. Gillan thought that Amy had inner confidence to wear clothes that showed [...] "a bit of skin from time to time". She tried on many things, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> short skirts she [...] "just thought it was right" [...] and showed that Amy was [...] "comfortable and confident about her look". She believed that the skirts reflected what young women typically wear at her age. Executive producer Piers Wenger also noted that Amy's 1970s flying jacket, which she wears [...] "quite a lot", reflected Gillan was a [...] "born adventurer" [...] and Amy developed a love for travel and adventure.|$|E

500|$|Harrison {{had been}} {{expected}} to adhere to Whig Party policies and to defer to party congressional leaders, particularly Clay. When Tyler succeeded him, he initially concurred with the new Whig Congress, signing into law the preemption bill granting [...] "squatters' sovereignty" [...] to settlers on public land, a Distribution Act (discussed below), a new bankruptcy law, and {{the repeal of the}} Independent Treasury. <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> the great banking question, Tyler was soon at odds with the Congressional Whigs, and twice vetoed Clay's legislation for a national banking act. Although the second bill was originally tailored to meet his objections in the first veto, its final version did not. This practice, designed to protect Clay from having a successful incumbent president as a rival for the Whig nomination in 1844, became known as [...] "heading Captain Tyler", a term coined by Whig Representative John Minor Botts of Virginia. Tyler proposed an alternative fiscal plan known as the [...] "Exchequer", but Clay's friends who controlled the Congress would have none of it.|$|E
500|$|Before her arrival, O'Reilly said Naomi was [...] "a lot of fun", but {{she would}} be hiding some secrets {{and it would be}} {{interesting}} to see the lengths she would go to in order to keep them hidden, particularly from her mother. O'Reilly described Naomi as having a [...] "good heart", <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> getting what she wants, some of her actions were [...] "questionable". She also said Naomi was good at turning a situation to her advantage, and likened her to a cat, as she enjoys the [...] "finer things in life". The actress continued, [...] "On top of all that, she is her mother's daughter. She has the Canning straight up, strength and vulgarity that her genes and upbringing have given her in spades. She's quirky but sophisticated, and at times petulant and silly. All in all, she is very, very fun to play." [...] O'Reilly did not think Naomi was bad, but she was spoilt and always tried to get her own way. However, underneath the surface, she was kind and caring. When asked whether viewers would like Naomi, O'Reilly believed that she could turn out to be a [...] "character everyone loves to hate".|$|E

Flirt as he did, in September, with those opposed to Hitler, he toed the party line when extreme pressure was exerted for the return of the Sudetenland and its German nationals by the Czechs to Germany."

2500|$|Many of Pauli's {{ideas and}} results were never {{published}} and appeared {{only in his}} letters, which were often copied and circulated by their recipients. Pauli may have been unconcerned that much of his work thus went uncredited, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> Heisenberg's world-renowned 1958 lecture at Göttingen on their joint work on a unified field theory, and the press release calling Pauli a mere [...] "assistant to Professor Heisenberg", Pauli became offended, shooting back several times at CERN and elsewhere by denouncing Heisenberg's physics prowess. The deterioration between them resulted in Heisenberg ignoring Pauli's funeral, and writing in his autobiography that Pauli's criticisms were overwrought. Pauli was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1953. In 1958 he became foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.|$|E

2500|$|The Eagles {{recorded}} the track with Don Henley on lead vocal three different times, twice at the Record Plant in Los Angeles and finally at the Criteria Studios in Miami. [...] They first recorded a riff, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> recording the vocal, {{it was found}} to be in too high a key for Henley's voice, so Felder progressively lowered the key from E minor, eventually settling on B minor. The second recording however was judged too fast. In Miami, the band fine-tuned the instrumentation and the lyrics and recorded numerous takes. Five or six best ones were selected, and the best parts were then spliced together to create the released version. According to the producer Bill Szymczyk, there were 33 edits on the two‑inch master. The final section features a guitar battle between Joe Walsh (who had replaced Bernie Leadon who left in 1975) and Felder, which took the two of them sitting together working for around three days to achieve the necessary precision. [...] Walsh and Felder initially started improvising but Henley insisted that the recording should follow the music as first recorded in Felder's demo.|$|E
