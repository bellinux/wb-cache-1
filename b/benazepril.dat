40|$|Objective: To {{conduct an}} {{economic}} {{analysis in the}} US of antihypertensive treatment with and without <b>benazepril</b> in patients with chronic renal insufficiency. Design: A four-state Markov model, using clinical data obtained from a 3 -year randomised clinical trial [the Angiotensin-Converting-Enzyme Inhibition in Progressive Renal Insufficiency (AIPRI) study] plus its extension study (median 3. 6 years), and cost data obtained from published US sources. The period of analysis was 7 years following randomisation. Perspective: Healthcare payer. Setting: Clinical data were obtained from multiple medical centres in three European countries {{as described in the}} published studies. Key economic data were obtained from the US Healthcare Financing Administration's End Stage Renal Disease programme. Patients and interventions: In the clinical studies on which this economic analysis was based, patients with chronic renal insufficiency of various aetiologies were randomised to antihypertensive therapy with or without concomitant <b>benazepril.</b> Main outcome measures and results: Over 7 years of analysis, patients randomised to antihypertensive treatment with concomitant <b>benazepril</b> therapy incurred on average $US 12 991 (1999 values) lower medical costs than patients prescribed antihypertensive treatment without <b>benazepril,</b> and obtained an additional 0. 091 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Costs and QALYs were greater for the <b>benazepril</b> arm than the placebo arm for all years of analysis after the first. Rank order stability of results favouring the <b>benazepril</b> therapy arm was found in sensitivity analyses of changes in key model parameters. Additional economic and health benefits favouring patients receiving <b>benazepril</b> would be seen if underlying model rates of dialysis and transplantation were increased, as may be appropriate to reflect treatment practice differences in the US relative to European countries. Conclusions: <b>Benazepril</b> therapy as a component of antihypertensive treatment of persons with chronic renal insufficiency initially costs money, but investment costs are recouped quickly and return on investment continues to grow. The impact of end-stage renal disease on patient health and healthcare costs is great. Thus, the quality-adjusted survival benefits and overall cost savings seen in <b>benazepril</b> recipients over a prolonged period (2 to 7 years) indicate that the strategy of prescribing <b>benazepril</b> to reduce progression of renal disease in patients with renal insufficiency is both clinically and economically beneficial compared with current antihypertensive regimens without ACE inhibition.

The mean (±SEM) exercise time was 8. 5 ± 0. 7 min with placebo, 8. 3 ± 0. 6 min (95 % confidence interval [CI] − 1. 06 to 0. 54) with <b>benazepril,</b> 9. 4 ± 0. 5 min (95 % CI − 0. 32 to 2. 14) with metoprolol OROS and 9. 6 ± 0. 5 min (95 % CI − 0. 25 to 2. 47) with the combination of <b>benazepril</b> and metoprolol OROS. The mean exercise time {{to the development of}} 1 mm ST segment depression was prolonged from 6. 0 ± 0. 6 min with placebo to 6. 3 ± 0. 6 min (95 % CI − 0. 93 to 1. 45) with <b>benazepril,</b> 7. 9 ± 0. 5 min (95 % CI 0. 83 to 3. 0) with metoprolol OROS and 8. 1 ± 0. 6 min (95 % CI 0. 88 to 3. 29) with the combination of <b>benazepril</b> and metoprolol OROS. <b>Benazepril</b> did not alter the rest or maximal heart rate, whereas metoprolol OROS alone and in combination significantly lowered the heart rate at rest and during maximal exercise. Systolic blood pressure at rest was nonsignifi-cantly reduced, whereas diastolic blood pressure was lowered significantly by all treatments in comparison with placebo. At maximal exercise, only metoprolol OROS, whether given alone or in combination with <b>benazepril,</b> was able to blunt significantly systolic blood pressure and rate-pressure product. During ambulatory ECG monitoring, heart rate was lowered throughout the 24 h period with metoprolol OROS but not with <b>benazepril.</b> Total episodes of ST segment depression in 24 h were 221 with placebo, 160 (95 % CI − 3. 72 to 1. 28) with <b>benazepril,</b> 136 (95 % CI − 4. 68 to − 0. 89) with metoprolol OROS and 150 (95 % CI − 5. 35 to 0. 78) with the combination of <b>benazepril</b> and metoprolol OROS. Similarly, total ischemic burden was 1, 549 min with placebo, which was reduced to 879 min (95 % CI − 48. 28 to 1. 92) with <b>benazepril,</b> 807 min (95 % CI − 44. 87 to − 6. 63) with metoprolol OROS and 828 min (95 % CI − 49. 63 to − 0. 37) with the combination of these. In conclusion, metoprolol OROS is an effective antiischemic agent. <b>Benazepril</b> did not produce any clinical benefit in terms of exercise test variables.

Another seven normal rats were included in normal control group. Then, rats in each group were accordingly given normal saline, TSLM, TSLM plus <b>benazepril</b> and <b>benazepril</b> orally for six weeks respectively. Blood and urine biochemical indexes, plasma atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), pathomorphology of renal tissue, transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β 1) and glucose transporter 1 (GLUT 1) mRNAs in renal tissue were observed. Results: Both TSLM and <b>benazepril</b> could decrease urinary albumin excretion rates, creatinine clearance and ratio of kidney weight to body weight of the rats with DN as well as reduce the pathological damages of the renal tissues.

40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} was {{conducted}} with the aim of evaluating the protective effects of Bombyx mori, quercetin and <b>benazepril</b> on doxorubicin (DXR) induced cardiotoxicity and nephrotoxicity in rats. B. mori, quercetin and <b>benazepril</b> were administered for 7 days, and a single intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg body weight of DXR on day five. The animals were sacrificed 48 h after DXR administration. DXR produced a significant elevation in the malondialdehyde (MDA) level and significantly inhibited the activity of glutathione (GSH) in the heart and the kidney followed by the activity of catalase (CAT) in the heart tissue with a significant rise in the serum levels of aspartate transaminase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine and a reduction in serum GSH levels indicating acute cardiac toxicity. B. mori, quercetin and <b>benazepril</b> pretreatment significantly reduced the MDA concentration and ameliorated the inhibition of cardiac GSH and CAT activity. B. mori, quercetin and <b>benazepril</b> also significantly improved the serum levels of AST, LDH, BUN, creatinine and GSH in DXR-treated rats.

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{determine}} the anti-ischaemic {{effects of a}} new angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, <b>benazepril,</b> compared with nifedipine, alone and in combination, in chronic stable angina caused by coronary artery disease. DESIGN [...] Placebo controlled, double blind, latin square design. SETTING [...] Regional cardiology service for a mixed urban and rural population. SUBJECTS [...] 40 patients with stable exertional angina producing at least 1 mm ST segment depression on exercise test with the Bruce protocol. 34 patients completed all four phases of the trial. INTERVENTIONS [...] Each patient was treated with placebo, <b>benazepril</b> (10 mg twice daily), nifedipine retard (20 mg twice daily), and a combination of <b>benazepril</b> and nifedipine in the same doses, in random order for periods of two weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES AND RESULTS [...] Total duration of exercise was not increased by any treatment. Exercise time {{to the development of}} 1 mm ST segment depression was not significantly changed with <b>benazepril</b> alone or in combination with nifedipine but was increased with nifedipine from 4. 18 (1. 8) min to 4. 99 (1. 6) min (95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 0. 28 to 1. 34; p < 0. 05). There was a significant relation between increase in duration of exercise and resting renin concentration (r = 0. 498; p < 0. 01). Myocardial ischaemia during daily activity, as assessed by ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring, was reduced by <b>benazepril</b> and by the <b>benazepril</b> and nifedipine combination. This was significant for total ischaemic burden (451 (628) min v 231 (408) min; 95 % CI - 398 to - 41 min; p < 0. 05) and maximal depth of ST segment depression (- 2. 47 (1. 2) mm v - 2. 16 mm; 95 % CI 0. 04 to 0. 57; p < 0. 05) for the combination and for maximal ST segment depth for <b>benazepril</b> monotherapy (- 2. 47 (1. 2) mm v - 1. 96 (1. 2) mm; 95 % CI 0. 18 to 0. 91; p < 0. 05). <b>Benazepril</b> significantly altered the circadian rhythm of cardiac ischaemia, abolishing the peak ischaemic periods at 0700 to 1200 and 1700 to 2300 (p < 0. 05).

Hemodynamic studies were {{performed}} noninvasively by means of M-mode echo (central hemodynamics and left ventricular systolic function), 2 -D echo-Doppler (left ventricular diastolic function), and pulsed Doppler flowmetry (forearm circulation). Examinations were done {{at the end of}} a placebo run-in period and 3 hours after <b>benazepril</b> administration, both on the first day and after 6 weeks of treatment (10 or 20 mg once daily, according to patient response). In comparison with placebo, <b>benazepril</b> reduced systolic (p = 0. 04) and diastolic (p = 0. 003) blood pressure, because of a significant reduction in systemic vascular resistance (p = 0. 03), while cardiac output was unchanged. Forearm vascular resistance was reduced and brachial artery compliance increased, although not to a statistically significant level (both p = 0. 07). Both systolic and diastolic left ventricular function were positively influenced by the afterload reduction: End-systolic stress was reduced by 12 % (p = 0. 07), as was the late diastolic peak flow velocity (p = 0. 02). All hemodynamic changes were evident after acute <b>benazepril</b> administration, and no differences was observed between acute and repeated treatment. We conclude that, similar to other ACE-inhibitors, <b>benazepril</b> reduces blood pressure through a reduction in vascular resistance, while cardiac output and heart rate are unaffected. These hemodynamic effects occur as early as after the first administration and exert a favorable influence on left ventricular dynamics...|$|E
40|$|An altered {{ambulatory}} {{blood pressure}} (BP) {{and heart rate}} (HR) profile is related to chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cardiorenal syndrome. In this study, we {{examined the effects of}} aliskiren, when added to angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers, on ambulatory BP and cardiorenal function in CKD. Thirty-six hypertensive CKD patients were randomly assigned to the aliskiren add-on group (n = 18) or the <b>benazepril</b> add-on group (n = 18). Ambulatory BP and cardiorenal function parameters were measured at baseline and 24 weeks after treatment. Compared with the <b>benazepril</b> group, nighttime systolic BP variability in the aliskiren group was lower after treatment. Albuminuria was decreased in the aliskiren group, but not in the <b>benazepril</b> group. In addition, left ventricular mass index (LVMI) was significantly lower in the aliskiren group than in the <b>benazepril</b> group after treatment. In the aliskiren group, multivariate linear regression analysis showed an association between changes in albuminuria and changes in nighttime systolic BP. Furthermore, there were associations between changes in LVMI and changes in daytime HR variability, as well as between changes in LVMI and changes in plasma aldosterone concentration. These results suggest that aliskiren add-on therapy may be beneficial for suppression of renal deterioration and pathological cardiac remodeling through an improvement that is effected in ambulatory BP and HR profiles...|$|E
