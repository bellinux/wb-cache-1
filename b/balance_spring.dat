5|$|The {{engineer}} Coleman Sellers {{questioned the}} origin and weight of the board used with the <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> apparatus. Sellers wrote that a standard mahogany board weighs around thirteen and half pounds but the one used in Crookes' experiment may have been at fault at only six pounds. Crookes responded to Sellers claiming the board weighed six pounds and {{this was not a}} mistake, he also stated he had the board for about sixteen years and it was originally cut in a lumber yard.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though he}} {{produced}} a number of pocket timekeepers, from around 1772-1778, Arnold was still experimenting with different types of compensation balance and methods of <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> adjustment. The most difficult problem to surmount was the problem of making an effective and continuously adjustable temperature compensation device. For technical reasons, the temperature compensation for the <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> had to somehow {{be incorporated into the}} balance itself and not act on the <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> directly as had been done previously by Arnold and others.|$|E

25|$|However, because Arnold's <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> patents were {{in force}} (each for 14 years), Earnshaw could {{not use the}} helical <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> until the 1775 patent lapsed in 1789, and, {{in the case of}} the 1782 patent, 1796. Until around 1796, Earnshaw made watches with flat balance springs only, but post 1800, {{practically}} every marine chronometer, including those by Earnshaw, had a helical spring with terminal overcoils.|$|E
25|$|In recent years, {{research}} has established that Arnold's success was {{not due to}} the form of detent escapement, but to his original methods of adjusting the <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> for positional errors by manipulating the overcoil terminal curve. For obvious reasons, Arnold tried to keep these methods secret, certainly it is recorded that he clearly expressed his concerns about possible plagiarism to Earnshaw, warning him {{in no uncertain terms}} not to use his Helical <b>balance</b> <b>spring.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The {{bimetallic}} compensated {{balance wheel}} was made obsolete {{in the early}} 20th century by advances in metallurgy.

25|$|During {{the same}} period, between 1779 and 1782, Arnold {{finalized}} {{the form of}} his chronometer watches. Through continuous experimentation, he worked {{out a way to}} make an effective but simple form of compensation balance. At the same time, he discovered a simple modification to his helical <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> that let develop concentrically and, also, confer the property of isochronism on the oscillating balance. Not only this, but adjustments to the compensation balance and the <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> could be carried out in a simple, calculated way. These were the main subjects of the patent, which he took out in 1782.|$|E
25|$|Such springs were {{essential}} in modern watches with a detached lever escapement {{because they can}} be adjusted for isochronism. Watches in the time of Huygens and Hooke, however, employed the very undetached verge escapement. It interfered with the isochronal properties of any form of <b>balance</b> <b>spring,</b> spiral or otherwise.|$|E
25|$|Hooke made tremendously {{important}} {{contributions to the}} science of timekeeping, being intimately involved in the advances of his time; {{the introduction of the}} pendulum as a better regulator for clocks, the <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> to improve the timekeeping of watches, and the proposal that a precise timekeeper could be used to find the longitude at sea.|$|E

40|$|By the {{experiment}} {{on the balance}} of three forces, we notice that one force can not become equal to the resultant {{of the other two}} forces when we use a <b>spring</b> <b>balance</b> horizontally or obliquely.

40|$|Motivated by {{the need}} to statically balance the {{inherent}} elastic forces in linkages, this paper presents three techniques to statically balance a four-bar linkage loaded by a zero-free-length spring attached between its coupler point and an anchor point on the ground. The number of auxiliary links and <b>balancing</b> <b>springs</b> required for the three techniques is {{less than or equal to}} that of the only technique currently in the literature. One of the three techniques does not require auxiliary links. In these techniques, the set of values for the spring constants and the ground-anchor point of the <b>balancing</b> <b>springs</b> can vary over a one-parameter family. Thrice as many balancing choices are available when the cognates are considered. The ensuing numerous options enable a user to choose the most practical solution. To facilitate the evaluation of the balancing choices for all the cognates, Roberts-Chebyshev cognate theorem is extended to statically balanced four-bar linkages. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

25|$|The {{fact that}} Arnold had {{recognized}} the technical {{advantages of a}} <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> of this form clearly demonstrates {{a high degree of}} insight. The balance that was the subject of the patent appears to have been an unsuccessful design. Certainly, some marine chronometers used this balance, but none have survived. Pearson records a balance of this kind in his possession that was 2.4inches in diameter.|$|E
25|$|This {{surviving}} watch {{dates from}} around 1769-1770, and is signed Arnold No. 1 Invenit et Fecit. The movement, which indicates centre seconds, has a steel balance with a bimetallic temperature compensation strip that acts {{on the flat}} <b>balance</b> <b>spring.</b> Though now altered, the original escapement was Arnold's horizontal pivoted detent as fitted to the larger timekeepers, which was it seems not entirely successful and needed improvements.|$|E
25|$|Arnold {{knew that}} as the balance and <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> control the {{timekeeping}} in a portable watch, he only needed {{to find a way}} of giving the balance a consistent impulse with minimal interference from the wheel work, together with an effective temperature compensation. After making some experimental machines, he produced what could be regarded as a production model to the Board of Longitude in March 1771.|$|E
50|$|Wristwatches {{and smaller}} clocks {{do not use}} pendulums as the timing device. Instead, they use a balance spring: a fine spring {{connected}} to a metal balance wheel that oscillates (rotates back and forth). Most modern mechanical watches have a working frequency of 3 to 4 Hz (3 - 4 cycles, or 6 - 8 beats per second, 21,600 - 28,800 beats per hour or bph). Faster or slower speeds are used in some watches (33,600 bph or 19,800 bph). The beats per minute depend on the <b>balance</b> <b>spring's</b> stiffness (spring constant); to keep time, the stiffness should not vary with temperature. Consequently, <b>balance</b> <b>springs</b> use sophisticated alloys; in this area, watchmaking is still advancing. As with the pendulum, the escapement must provide a small kick each cycle to keep the balance wheel oscillating. Also, the same lubrication problem occurs over time; the watch will lose accuracy (typically it will speed up) when the escapement lubrication starts failing.|$|R
50|$|The first <b>spring</b> <b>balance</b> in Britain {{was made}} around 1770 by Richard Salter of Bilston, near Wolverhampton.

25|$|Huygens {{developed}} a <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> {{watch in the}} same period as, though independently of, Robert Hooke. Controversy over the priority persisted for centuries. A Huygens watch employed a spiral balance spring; but he used this form of spring initially only because the balance in his first watch rotated more than one and a half turns. He later used spiral springs in more conventional watches, made for him by Thuret in Paris from around 1675.|$|E
25|$|Two other makers {{also made}} {{precision}} watches with the detached escapement: Josiah Emery and John Brockbank.

25|$|The balance {{consisted}} of a circular steel balance wheel with two bimetallic strips attached diametrically. Each bimetallic strip terminated with a screw thread mounted with a weight or balance nut. The further along the strip this nut was screwed, the greater the compensating effect. Another part of the patent concerned an addition to {{the form of the}} balance spring—a coil of smaller radius {{at each end of the}} helical spring, which offered increasing resistance to the rotating balance as it turned towards the end of each vibration. This was an important invention, as it largely eliminated the problem of the positional adjustment of balance controlled watches. This device, known as the Overcoil <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> is still used today in most precision mechanical watches.|$|E

50|$|A {{number of}} {{materials}} {{have been used}} for <b>balance</b> <b>springs.</b> Early on, steel was used, but without any hardening or tempering process applied; as a result, these springs would gradually weaken and the watch would start losing time.

Hardened and tempered steel was first used by John Harrison and subsequently remained the material of choice until the 20th century.|$|R

500|$|The {{invention}} of the mainspring in the early 15th century allowed portable clocks to be built, evolving into the first pocketwatches by the 17th century, but these were not very accurate until the <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> {{was added to the}} balance wheel in the mid 17th century. Some dispute remains as to whether British scientist Robert Hooke (his was a straight spring) or Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens was the actual inventor of the <b>balance</b> <b>spring.</b> Huygens was clearly the first to use a spiral <b>balance</b> <b>spring,</b> the form used in virtually all watches to the present day. [...] The addition of the <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> made the balance wheel a harmonic oscillator like the pendulum in a pendulum clock, which oscillated at a fixed resonant frequency and resisted oscillating at other rates. [...] This innovation increased watches' accuracy enormously, reducing error from perhaps several hours per day to perhaps 10 minutes per day, resulting in the addition of the minute hand to the watch face around 1680 in Britain and 1700 in France.|$|E
500|$|Early clock dials showed hours: {{the display}} of minutes and seconds evolved later.

50|$|The largest use of Elinvar was in <b>balance</b> <b>springs</b> for {{mechanical}} {{watches and}} chronometers. A {{major cause of}} inaccuracy in watches and clocks was that ordinary steels used in springs lost elasticity slightly as the temperature increased, so the balance wheel would oscillate more slowly back and forth, and the clock would lose time. Chronometers and precision watches required complex temperature-compensated balance wheels for accurate timekeeping. Springs made of Elinvar, and other low temperature coefficient alloys such as Nivarox that followed, were not affected by temperature, so they made the temperature-compensated balance wheel obsolete.|$|R
