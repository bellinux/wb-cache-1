40|$|Non-native herbivores may alter plant {{communities}} {{through their}} preferential consumption of seedlings of different species. We assessed seedling herbivory by two invasive gastropod species in Hawaii, the giant African snail (Achatina fulica) and the Cuban <b>brown</b> <b>slug</b> (Veronicella cubensis). We hypothesized that six native species would suffer greater gastropod herbivory than four non-native species, and that species with short stature, thin leaves, and lacking physical defenses would suffer the greatest mortality from gastropods. Herbivory was measured during 13 -day preference trials using enclosures that each contained four different woody species (two native, two non-native) and {{were assigned to}} one of three treatments: giant African snail, Cuban <b>brown</b> <b>slug,</b> or control (no gastropod). Discriminant function analysis was used to predict gastropod-induced seedling mortality from a suite of seedling characteristics. Native species did not always experience greater herbivory than non-natives species, and seedling mortality was 0 – 100 %. Native Pipturus albidus and Clermontia parviflora suffered 100 % mortality from V. cubensis herbivory, and P. albidus, Psychotria hawaiiensis, and Myrsine lessertiana suffered C 80 % mortality from A. fulica. Two non-natives (Fraxinus uhdei, Clidemia hirta), and two natives (Metrosideros polymorpha, Diospyros sandwicensis), suffered little damage and no mortality. Non-native Ardisia elliptica suffered 10 – 30 %gastropod mortality, and non-native Psidium cattleianum mortality was 0 – 50 %. Leaf thickness best predicted species mortality caused by slugs and snails; some thicker-leaved species suffered most. Invasive snails and slugs threaten some native and non-native seedlings by directly consuming them. Current and future plant community structure in Hawaii may in part reflect the feeding preferences of invasive gastropods...|$|E
40|$|Seedlings of many {{vegetables}} and flowers are favoured foods and high population of slugs [Filicaulis alte (Ferussac) ] can cause difficulties in establishing these plants. Slugs also feed on many {{fruits and vegetables}} prior to harvest. This pre-harvest feeding results in wounds that allow various fungi and bacteria to enter and spoil the crop. The slime trails also contaminate the produce and the products are unfit for sale (Barker 2002). Seedlings are often cut off at the soil surface by slugs. They also feed below ground on roots and tubers of beet, carrot, potato, radish and turnip. Slugs usually feed on surface of potato tubers, tomato and egg plant fruits, but sometimes dig into the flesh of these vegetables (Jagtap 2000). Preliminary studies conducted by Kaur and Kaur (2003) indicated that black/brown slug with mid-dorsal streak, F. alte inflicted three types of damage to seedlings/saplings of {{vegetables and}} flower plants in laboratory feeding tests viz., leaves eaten from the margins, consumption of whole upper portion of seedling and stem girdling with resultant wilting of plants causing damage to sponge gourd (67 %), coriander (67 %), cabbage (76 %), brinjal (27 %), spinach (72 %), cauliflower (47 %). Some type of damage was inflicted by the other biotype of F. alte i. e., the <b>brown</b> <b>slug</b> with black spots but to somewhat less extent viz. sponge gourd (47 %), coriander (34 %), cabbage (56 %), brinjal (22 %), spinach (33 %), cauliflower (26 %) (personal communication) indicating its less destructive nature as compared to black / <b>brown</b> <b>slug</b> with mid-dorsal yellow streak. No damage assessment {{has been done in}} vegetable crop fields in Punjab. So present studies were undertaken to study {{the nature and extent of}} damage inflicted to various vegetable crops at Malerkotla, so that the effective timing for slug control be determined...|$|E
50|$|This slug is {{carnivorous}} {{and actively}} preys on snails. It is usually grayish brown to dark gray in color with scattered black {{spots on the}} upper surface of the body. The bottom surface of the foot is a light reddish <b>brown.</b> These <b>slugs</b> inhabit environments with high humidity and shade, such as foothills and city gardens, although they are rarely seen.|$|R

But [...] and [...] saw Wilson bounce among four organizations—the Browns, Cleveland Indians, Tigers and Athletics—and make ineffective appearances in six total big-league games for the Browns and A's. Finally, in 1950, he was acquired by the Triple-A Seattle Rainiers, managed by Paul Richards. Wilson won 24 games (losing 11) for a sixth-place team and led the Pacific Coast League in strikeouts.

5000|$|Following {{the death}} of the {{original}} league, the Monarchs spent several years as an independent team, mostly barnstorming through the Midwest, West, and western Canada. They frequently toured with the House of David baseball team. Hall of Famers Hilton Smith, a pitcher, and Willard <b>Brown,</b> a <b>slugging</b> shortstop/outfielder with a consistent batting average of over [...]300, became Monarch mainstays during this time. During the 1940s, Willard Brown became the go-to home run hitter for the Monarchs. [...] With Andy Cooper now at the helm, the Monarchs became charter members of the Negro American League in 1937, winning the first league title. Andy Cooper was responsible for leading the Monarchs to bring home the pennant in 1939 and 1940. [...] The Kansas City Monarchs then won the next two league championships and won [...] winning the renewed Negro League World Series in 1942 in four straight games against the Homestead Grays.At the start of this run the Monarchs acquired their most famous player, Hall of Fame pitcher Satchel Paige, who had since his rookie season in 1927 built a reputation as the best hurler in black baseball for the Birmingham Black Barons, Pittsburgh Crawfords, and several other teams. Suffering from an arm injury and generally thought to be done, Paige joined the Monarchs' B team in 1939; by 1940 he had recovered and been called up to the Monarchs' main squad, where he became their top drawing card. Paige {{was the subject of a}} lot of stories, both true and folklore, and became a legend to people who don’t even follow baseball. For example, he was known to have known the outfielders to sit on the ground behind him while he struck out the hitter and there was someone on base that could possibly tie the game up. Paige also warmed up before pitching in a game by throwing across a gum wrapper as home plate. [...] Paige led another superb Monarchs' staff that included fellow Hall of Famer Hilton Smith, the veteran Chet Brewer, Booker McDaniels, Jim LaMarque, and several others. They won one last NAL pennant in 1946, but lost a seven-game World Series to the Newark Eagles; in this series, they lost four games and won three.|$|R
