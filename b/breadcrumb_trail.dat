40|$|This {{document}} is {{a synthesis of}} the research that I have been conducting, along with my co–authors, since the defence of my PhD thesis. This encompasses several topics, which although apparently non immediately connected, {{will turn out to}} follow, at least from the theoretical point of view, the same <b>breadcrumbs</b> <b>trail,</b> namely stochastic control (and also stochastic differential games). As I will try to make clear, most of my research topics actually share strong connections, be it {{from the point of view}} of the applications which drive them, or from the mathematical tools needed to study them. I have nonetheless made the choice to regroup them along four different lines, corresponding to the four parts of the present manuscript(i) 2 BSDEs, BSDEs and robust finance. (ii) Regularity and numerics for BSDEs. (iii) Transaction costs and homogenisation of partial differential equations. (iv) Contracting theory...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that while the use of <b>breadcrumb</b> <b>trails</b> to {{navigate}} a website can be helpful, few users choose to utilize this method of navigation. This study investigates the effects of "mere exposure " and training on breadcrumb usage and satisfaction. Participants were {{randomly assigned to one of}} three conditions. Condition I participants received both exposure and instruction to use breadcrumb navigation. Condition II participants received only mere exposure to the use of breadcrumb navigation and Condition III participants received neither exposure nor instruction to use breadcrumb navigation. Upon completing a list of search tasks, Condition I participants spent less time, visited fewer web pages, and relied less on other methods of navigation. The mere exposure group, Condition II, did not produce significantly faster search times or visit fewer web pages than the participants i...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This research assessed website management and development practices across the United Kingdom university library sector. As a starting point, the design and features of this group of websites was recorded against criteria drawn from the extant literature. This activity established core content and features of UK library websites as: a search box or link for searching the library catalogue, electronic resources or website; a navigation column {{on the left and}} <b>breadcrumb</b> <b>trail</b> to aid information location and website orientation; homepage design was repeated on library website sub-pages; university brand elements appeared in the banner; and a contact us link was provided for communication with library personnel. Library websites conformed to 14 of the 20 homepage usability guidelines examined indicating that web managers were taking steps to ensure that users were well served by their websites. Areas for improvement included better navigation support (sitemap/index), greater adoption of new technologies and more interactive features. Website management and development practices were established through national survey and in-depth case studies. These illustrated the adoption of a team approach to website management and development; formal website policy and strategy were not routinely created; library web personnel and their ability to build effective links with colleagues at the institution made a valuable contribution to the success of a library website; corporate services and institutional practices played an important part in library website development; library staff were actively engaged in consultations with their website audience; and a user focused approach to website development prevailed. User studies and metric data were considered in the website evaluation and development process. However, there were some issues with both data streams and interpreting metric data to inform website development. Evaluation and development activities were not always possible due to staff/time shortages, technical constraints, corporate website templates, and, to a lesser extent, lack of finance...|$|E
