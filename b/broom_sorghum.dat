40|$|The <b>broom</b> <b>sorghum</b> type is {{characterized}} by having lax panicle with short rachis and long andresistant branches, which makes it suitable for the manufacturing of brooms. This work evaluated the morphologicalcharacteristics of <b>broom</b> <b>sorghum</b> strains selected from accesses from different regions of Brazil. The experimentwas conducted at the Federal University of Viçosa, in Viçosa, MG, Brazil {{during the period of}} March to July 2009. The treatments consisted of nine <b>broom</b> <b>sorghum</b> lines and a commercial variety (Tietê), used as a control. Certaincharacteristics were determined such as plant height at flowering, diameter of the panicle stalk, panicle length andrachis length. The strains showed no differences in the diameter of the panicle stalk. The lineage SV 08 - 001 standsout as to the length of the rachis and height of the plant. The lineages SV 07 - 060 and SV 07 - 032 were more promisingfor the production of quality brooms...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} crops in the Santa Cruz region of Bolivia is <b>broom</b> <b>sorghum.</b> It is used for making brooms and has become a major local industry since the crop was introduced in the early 1950 s. There are several varieties of sorghum that produce long straight stems for brooms. Their potential was first recognised in Italy nearly 300 years ago, and the <b>broom</b> <b>sorghum</b> varieties have been gradually spreading across the world. Despite this, little was known about the crops in Bolivia, so the British Overseas Development Administration has been funding a programme to collect available data on the crop. Researchers have been testing local varieties and have ascertained that plant density has a big effect on the stem produced. As part of the background work, the researchers have managed to obtain seeds from the United States, Argentina and India. These new varieties will be tested in the coming year. Farmers' cooperatives and other similar institutions will be asked to produce their own seed. In Fiji, broomcorn, another variety of sorghum used for making brooms, is grown on a small scale in the Sigatoka Valley. It was started as a cottage industry in 1963. Farmers planted 30 hectares (74 acres) in 1978 producing 78 tonnes. During 1983 export sales of manufactured brooms were valued at $ 59, 171 while local sales came to $ 7, 608. Broomcorn production in Fiji is expected to increase in the coming years since markets have been extended overseas.

40|$|An action {{spectrum}} for anthocyanin formation in dark-grown <b>broom</b> <b>sorghum</b> (Sorghum bicolor Moench, cv Acme Broomcorn and cv Sekishokuzairai Fukuyama Broomcorn) seedlings was determined over the wavelength range from 260 to 735 nanometers. The action peaks were at 290, 650, 385, and 480 nanometers {{in descending order}} of height. The action of the 290 -nanometer peak was not affected by subsequently given far red light, whereas {{those of the other}} three action peaks were nullified completely. The nullification of the 385 -nanometer peak action by far red light was reversible. When an irradiation at these action peaks was followed by a phytochrome-saturating fluence of red light irradiation, the action of the 290 -nanometer peak remained, whereas that of the 385 -nanometer peak {{as well as those of}} the 650 - and 480 -nanometer peaks was masked by the action of the second irradiation. These findings suggested that the 290 - and 385 -nanometer action peaks involved different photoreceptors, the latter being phytochrome. The blue light-absorbing photoreceptor as reported to be a prerequisite for phytochrome action in milo sorghum was not found to exist in the broom sorghums...|$|E
50|$|In 1797, {{the quality}} of brooms changed when Levi Dickenson, a farmer in Hadley, Massachusetts, made a broom for his wife, using the tassels of sorghum, a grain he was growing for the seeds. His wife spread good words around town, {{creating}} demand for Dickenson's <b>sorghum</b> <b>brooms.</b> The <b>sorghum</b> <b>brooms</b> held up well, but ultimately, like all brooms, fell apart. Dickenson subsequently invented a machine that would make better brooms, and faster than he could. In 1810, the foot treadle broom machine was invented. This machine played an integral part in the Industrial Revolution.|$|R

5000|$|The {{legend has}} it that the witches, indistinguishable from the other women by day, at night anointed their underarms (or their breasts) with an unguent and took off flying, pronouncing a magic phrase (recounted above), riding on <b>brooms</b> of <b>sorghum.</b> At the same time the witches became incorporeal, spirits like the wind; indeed, their {{preferred}} nights for flying were stormy ones. In particular, it was further believed that there was a bridge from which the witches of Benevento usually launched themselves into flight, which was therefore called the [...] "bridge of the jannaras," [...] destroyed during World War II. At night they stole horses out of their stables and after plaiting the horses' hair they would race the horse until it started to foam around the mouth; they would then rub themselves with it.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigating}} effect of irrigation intervals on yield and yield components of sorghum cultivars, an experiment {{was conducted at}} the Research Farm of Islamic Azad University of Miyaneh on May, 2008. This experiment was implemented {{in the form of}} split-plot with randomized complete block design in three replicates. The first factor included 3 irrigation intervals (7, 14, 21) days, and grain sorghum cultivars including Kimya, Payam and <b>broom</b> <b>sorghum</b> called local cultivar Golbous was main and secondary plot, respectively. According to the results, the effect of irrigation intervals and cultivar on many of the studied traits such as plant height, panicle length, stem diameter, number of leaves, grain number per plant and grain yield was significant and intraction between irrigation intervals and cultivar on plant height, panicle length, grain number per plant was significant. The comparison of means indicated that plant height, panicle length, grain number per plant and grain yield decreases as the irrigation intervals increased. This comparison also suggested payam cultivar is superior to Kimya and local Golbous in terms of the grain number per plant and grain yield. Plant height had a positive and significant correlation with all of the studied characters unless seed number per plant...|$|E
50|$|Shaker brooms {{built upon}} the 1797 {{contribution}} of Levi Dickenson of Hadley, Massachusetts who used tassels of sorghum (Sorghum vulgare), known as broom corn, {{to make a}} better grade of broom. Brooms were essential to kitchen and hearth cleanliness. The manufacture and selling of brooms was the most widespread of all the Shaker industries. The first <b>sorghum</b> <b>brooms</b> were made by the Shakers at Watervliet. This colony is credited with being the first to grow broom corn, which was around 1800 when they first grew it on an island in the Mohawk River that was near their community.|$|R

40|$|Sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] is {{the sixth}} most {{important}} grain crop worldwide. In addition to grain varieties, diversifying selection in sorghum breeding has produced elite types for forage, silage, sugar, syrup, fiber, and <b>broom</b> production. <b>Sorghum,</b> however, {{has yet to}} undergo selection for whole plant energy production. Recent initiatives and improvements in grain, stem sugar, and lignocellulosic ethanol suggest that all plant parts may be valuable for energy production in the future. The primary focus of this dissertation {{was to understand the}} genetics of tradeoffs in yield and composition of grain, stem sugar and lignocellulosic biomass, and identify genetic diversity in grain and sweet sorghum types. 	A biparental recombinant inbred line population, derived from a cross between a sweet and a grain sorghum, was used to identify QTL for non-structural carbohydrates in the first study and structural carbohydrates in the second. Including both studies, a total of 303 QTL were identified across 69 reported traits. From these studies, a major finding was that tradeoffs are minimal between carbohydrates under favorable conditions. This supports a sink limited model of whole plant energy production. Identified tradeoffs co-localized with QTL for height, flowering time and stand density suggesting some pleiotropic effects. Another important finding in the second study was that the genetic control of structural composition was found to be different between stem and leaf tissue. This was also true for protein, with QTL for grain, stem and leaf crude protein failing to co-localize. These results suggest independent selection on tissues would be most effective. Additional products of these first two studies were a genetic map and NIRS equations for grain, stem and leaf tissue. 	The third study used a diverse panel of 125 sweet, grain and landrace sorghums to examine genetic relationships within the sweet sorghums and between sweet and grain sorghums. Using principal coordinate analysis, three main populations within sweet sorghum were identified, syrup types, sugar and energy types, and amber types. These had some correspondence with grain races kafir, bicolor and caudatum. Association mapping detected four major height QTL, and one QTL for brix...|$|R
