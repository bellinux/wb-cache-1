25|$|José Nicolas Francisco Pablo Lemery é Ibarrola Ney y González, Marques de Baroja (2 December 1811 – 11 April 1886) was a Spanish {{general who}} served as the 82nd Governor-General of the Philippines, 109th Governor of Puerto Rico, Deputy and Senator of <b>Baleares.</b> He was {{distinguished}} in his military and political career, striving for justice, equality and fair government in the positions he held.|$|E
25|$|The Spanish Republican Army {{had just}} 18 tanks of a {{sufficiently}} modern design, and the Nationalists {{took control of}} 10. Naval capacity was uneven, with the Republicans retaining a numerical advantage, but with the Navy's top commanders {{and two of the}} most modern ships, heavy cruisers Canarias —captured at the Ferrol shipyard—and <b>Baleares,</b> in Nationalist hands. The Spanish Republican Navy suffered from the same problems as the army—many officers had defected or had been killed after trying to do so. Two-thirds of air capability was retained by the government—however, the whole of the Republican Air Force was very outdated.|$|E
25|$|The {{sinking of}} rebel heavy cruiser <b>Baleares</b> {{was hailed as}} a great victory by the republican government. Following this victory, {{commander}} of the republican fleet Luis González de Ubieta was awarded the Laureate Plate of Madrid (Placa Laureada de Madrid), the highest military award for gallantry of the Second Spanish Republic. The Distintivo de Madrid, which had been established by the Spanish Republic in order to reward courage, was given to cruisers Libertad and Méndez Núñez, and destroyers Lepanto, Almirante Antequera and Sánchez Barcáiztegui, {{as well as to}} their crew members. This entitled these ships to fly a special pennant and their crews to wear a special badge on their uniforms with the old Coat of arms of Madrid.|$|E
500|$|From about 218 BC onwards, the Republican army's slingers were {{exclusively}} mercenaries {{from the}} Balearic Islands, which had nurtured a strong indigenous tradition of slinging from prehistoric times. As a result, in classical Latin, <b>Baleares</b> (literally [...] "inhabitants of the Balearic Islands") became an alternative word for [...] "slingers" [...] (funditores, from funda = [...] "sling"). Because of this, {{it is uncertain}} whether {{the most of the}} imperial army's slingers continued to be drawn from the Balearics themselves, or, like archers, derived mainly from other regions.|$|E
500|$|The {{dominant}} poleis of Athens and Sparta were {{weakened by}} warring each other, {{especially during the}} Peloponnesian War (431–404 BCE) won by Sparta. They were defeated and ruled by Thebes for a time (371–360 BCE), after which Sparta's role was over. Eventually, all of Greece was subjugated by the Macedonian monarchy in 338 BCE, that {{put an end to}} the era of free autonomous city-states, and Athenian democracy as well in 322 BCE. In the subsequent Hellenistic period (334–30 BCE) numerous diadochs (successors of Alexander the Great) fought one another for the kingship of Macedon, definitively obtained by the Antigonids in 277 BCE. Meanwhile, the Phoenician city-state of Carthage, located in present-day Tunisia, aside from settling large swaths of North Africa's coast, also set up several colonies on [...] Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica, the <b>Baleares</b> and in southern Iberia. The Carthaginian empire, according to tradition founded in 814 BCE, started out as a monarchy, but in the 4th century transformed into a republic where suffets ("judges") ruled. Finally, Rome gradually conquered all of Italy (primarily after 350 BCE), and defeated Carthage in the Punic Wars (264–146 BCE). In 168, Macedon was subdued by the Romans, and partitioned into four client republics. These were annexed as Roman provinces in 148, as happened to Greece in 146, making Rome's territory envelop all of literate Europe. The remainder of Iberia, the Illyrian coast and eventually Gaul by general Julius Caesar were added to the Roman Republic, which however was experiencing an institutional crisis. After defeating his rival Pompey, Caesar was appointed dictator to restore order. He almost managed to found a dynasty in the process, but was killed by a republican cabal led by Brutus in 44 BCE.|$|E
2500|$|In March 1938, however, <b>Baleares,</b> {{accompanied}} by five rebel destroyers, was engaged {{again by the}} Republican Navy off in the Battle of Cape Palos, off Cartagena's shores. During the gunnery duel, Republican destroyers , [...] and , all fired their torpedoes. Two or three of Lepantos torpedoes hit <b>Baleares,</b> detonating her forward magazine and sinking her. Out of her crew of 1,206, she had 765 seamen killed or missing, among them rebel vice admiral Manuel Vierna Belando, commander of the Nationalist cruiser division.|$|E
2500|$|A mixed {{force of}} 15,000 Nationalists troops (Moroccan colonial troops, Carlist militia members (Requetés)), and Italian {{soldiers}} {{participated in the}} Nationalist attack on Málaga. [...] This force was commanded overall by Queipo de Llano. [...] The Italians, led by Mario Roatta and known as the Blackshirts, formed nine mechanized battalions of about 5,000-10,000 soldiers and were equipped with light tanks and armored cars. In the Alboran Sea, the Canarias, <b>Baleares</b> and Velasco were in position to blockade and bombard Málaga, backed by the German cruiser Admiral Graf Spee.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2011 the Spanish {{government}} {{approved a}} [...] (...) fund for year 2011 to promote electric vehicles. The incentives include direct subsidies for {{the acquisition of}} new electric cars for up to 25% of the purchase price, before tax, {{to a maximum of}} €6,000 per vehicle (US$8,600), and 25% of the gross purchase price of other electric vehicles such as buses and vans, with a maximum of €15,000 or €30,000, depending on the range and type of vehicle. Several regional government grant incentives for the purchase of alternative fuel vehicles including electric and hybrid vehicles. In Aragón, Asturias, <b>Baleares,</b> Madrid, Navarra, Valencia, Castilla-La Mancha, Murcia, Castilla y León electric vehicles are eligible to a €6,000 tax incentive and hybrids to €2,000.|$|E
2500|$|Lemery {{was born}} in Madrid, Spain on 2 December 1811 to Nicolas Lemery y Ney and Genera Ibarrola y Gonzalez. He served as the chief {{military}} officer of the Spanish Royal Family, particularly as adjutant of Francis, Duke of Cadiz. In 1848, he married Flora Ferrer y Alvarez Torres. Their children were María Flora de Lemery y Ferrer, Marquesa de Baroja (born 1849), Manuela Lemery y Ferrer Ibarrola (born 1852), and Isabel Lemery y Ferrer Ibarrola (born 1861). In 1854, he succeeded Joaquín Francisco Pacheco y Gutiérrez-Calderón as Deputy of <b>Baleares.</b> In 1855, he was appointed by Queen Isabel II of Spain as Governor of Puerto Rico, where he succeeded Andrés García Camba. Before holding these offices, he had a brief stint in Cuba (1850–1852), wherein he was appointed as commanding general of the colonial armed forces. This appointment {{was done with the}} help of his friend, José Gutiérrez de la Concha, 1st Marquis of Havana, who was then serving as Governor of Cuba. He was known to have employed harsh policies in suppressing an [...] "impending rebellion." [...] Among those who were arrested out of suspicion was Joaquín de Agüero, who would lead a rebellion in 1851. In 1858, he was promoted lieutenant general and was elected senator for life (senador vitalicio) in the Senate of Spain.|$|E
60|$|Let {{the reader}} {{now turn to}} the map and find the place of Carthage upon it. Let him imagine a great and rich city there, with piers, and docks, and {{extensive}} warehouses for the commerce, and temples, and public edifices of splendid architecture, for the religious and civil service of the state, and elegant mansions and palaces for the wealthy aristocracy, and walls and towers {{for the defense of}} the whole. Let him then imagine a back country, extending for some hundred miles into the interior of Africa, fertile and highly cultivated, producing great stores of corn, and wine, and rich fruits of every description. Let him then look at the islands of Sicily, of Corsica, and Sardinia, and the <b>Baleares,</b> and conceive of them as rich and prosperous countries, and all under the Carthaginian rule. Look, also, at the coast of Spain; see, in imagination, the city of Carthagena, with its fortifications, and its army, and the gold and silver mines, with thousands and thousands of slaves toiling in them. Imagine fleets of ships going continually along the shores of the Mediterranean, from country to country, cruising back and forth to Tyre, to Cyprus, to Egypt, to Sicily, to Spain, carrying corn, and flax, and purple dyes, and spices, and perfumes, and precious stones, and ropes and sails for ships, and gold and silver, and then periodically returning to Carthage, to add the profits they had made to the vast treasures of wealth already accumulated there. Let the reader imagine all this with the map before him, so as to have a distinct conception of the geographical relations of the localities, and he will have a pretty correct idea of the Carthaginian power at the time it commenced its dreadful conflicts with Rome.|$|E
50|$|While {{these ships}} steamed ahead, Republican cruisers Libertad and Méndez Núñez engaged <b>Baleares.</b> A {{crashing}} volley from Libertad smashed <b>Baleares</b> electronics, temporarily disabling the cruisers main guns. But the Nationalists repaired {{the damage and}} <b>Baleares</b> renewed her pursuit.|$|E
5000|$|The {{official}} {{name of the}} Balearic Islands in Catalan is Illes Balears, while in Spanish they are known as the Islas <b>Baleares.</b> The term [...] "Balearic" [...] derives from Greek (/Gymnesiae and /Balliareis). In Latin it is <b>Baleares.</b>|$|E
