Brett and Deanna's property in Hattiesburg, Mississippi was also extensively damaged by the storm. Favre elected to continue {{to play in the}} 2005 season.|$|E
25|$|In November 2010, {{the band}} played a set of shows in the UK, each with an {{individual}} set list and their album The Latest was given away as a free disc with the UK magazine Classic Rock. On July 17, 2011 at the Bluesfest in Ottawa, 20 minutes into Cheap Trick’s set, a thunderstorm <b>blew</b> <b>through</b> the festival area. The band and crew were on the stage when without warning the 40-ton roof fell. It fell away from the audience and landed on the band's truck which was parked alongside {{the back of the}} stage, breaking the fall and allowing everyone about 30 seconds to escape.|$|E
25|$|A {{quarter of}} a century earlier, the nearby town of Indianola on Matagorda Bay was {{undergoing}} its own boom and was second to Galveston among Texas port cities. Then in 1875, a powerful hurricane <b>blew</b> <b>through,</b> nearly destroying the town. Indianola was rebuilt, though a second hurricane in 1886 caused residents to simply give up and move elsewhere. Many Galveston residents took the destruction of Indianola as an object lesson on the threat posed by hurricanes. Galveston is built on a low, flat island, little more than a large sandbar along the Gulf Coast. These residents proposed a seawall be constructed to protect the city, but their concerns were dismissed by {{the majority of the population}} and the city's government.|$|E

500|$|Although {{things seemed}} {{to start off}} smoothly, when {{construction}} began on the bridge in 1834, things went downhill. The bridge was constructed fast, and when completed {{in the spring of}} 1836, it was a wooden covered bridge at a length of [...] Within days of opening the bridge, on April 9, 1836, a storm <b>blew</b> <b>through</b> the valley, destroying two of the bridges three piers and rendered the new bridge unusable. After restarting construction later, the bridge was redone using the same piers and in 1839, was completed and opened once again. However, in January 1841, another storm, dubbed the Bridges Freshet of January 1841, <b>blew</b> <b>through</b> the valley, destroying most of the bridges in the area, and causing major damage to the structure from Riverton to Belvidere. However, this time, the bridge survived the storm. A local historian stated that because of the constant repairwork on the bridge itself, the bridge company had never paid one dividend of money to its stockholders. Although, after society {{on both sides of the}} bridge began to live life with it, money started flowing into the accounts of the stockholders.|$|E

[...] Stump was {{the only member of}} the quartet to take on a solo project while Fall Out Boy was on hiatus, recording debut album Soul Punk entirely on his own: he wrote, produced, and played every instrument for all tracks on the record. In addition, he married his longtime girlfriend and lost over sixty pounds through portion control and exercise. Stump <b>blew</b> <b>through</b> most of his savings putting together a large band to tour behind Soul Punk, but ticket sales were sparse and the album stalled commercially. During a particularly dark moment in February 2012, Stump poured his heart out in a 1500-word blog entry called [...] "We Liked You Better Fat: Confessions of a Pariah."

[...] Aside from Soul Punk and personal developments, Stump moonlighted as a professional songwriter/producer, co-writing tracks with Bruno Mars and All Time Low, and pursued acting.|$|E
2500|$|Lennon <b>blew</b> <b>through</b> a straw into a pan {{of water}} to create a {{bubbling}} effect; McCartney and Lennon talked through tin cans to create {{the sound of the}} captain's orders; at 1:38-40 in the song, Starr stepped outside the doors of the recording room and yelled like a sailor, acknowledging [...] "Cut the cable! Drop the cable!", which was looped into the song afterwards; and Abbey Road employees John Skinner and Terry Condon twirled chains in a tin bath to create water sounds. After the line, [...] "and the band begins to play", Emerick found a recording of a brass band and changed it slightly so it could not be identified, although it is thought to be a recording of Georges Krier and Charles Helmer's composition, [...] "Le Rêve Passe" [...] (1906). The original recording had a spoken intro by Starr, but the idea was abandoned on 3 June.|$|E

Due to a self-admitted spendthrift attitude, Smith felt {{he had nothing to}} lose when a producer from NBC and Quincy Jones approached him with an idea for a sitcom, with Townes appearing as a recurring character, named [...] "Jazz". The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air boosted his profile and his pocketbook. Smith <b>blew</b> <b>through</b> almost US$2.8m, while giving none to the IRS for taxes. Soon after And in This Corner... was released, Smith was sentenced by the IRS to pay this all back. For the first three seasons of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Smith had 25% of his paycheck garnished by the IRS. In 1990 Ready Rock C decided not to continue as support and later sued the duo.|$|E

2500|$|The initial form of {{government}} was an executive council formed of public servant appointed by and responsible to the governor. This changed when the New Zealand Constitution Act 1852, an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that granted self-government to the Colony of New Zealand, was received. This allowed for a bicameral General Assembly (or Parliament), consisting of the Governor, an appointed Legislative Council and an elected House of Representatives, with an Executive Council nominally appointed by the Governor. It also allowed for provincial governments, and six provinces were initially established. The first general election was held in 1853 and Parliament convened in Auckland for its first session, which was opened on 27 May 1854. On 3 June, {{the question of the}} seat of Parliament was first discussed, with Edward Gibbon Wakefield arguing that the seat {{of government}} must be shifted to Wellington. Travel to and from parliament was arduous, and the members from the far south had taken two months to get to Auckland. A more central location was desirable, a move not supported by the members from Auckland constituencies. What also did not help was that the General Assembly House had been erected in a hurry and {{was nothing more than a}} shell, and members called it the [...] "Shedifice". The wind <b>blew</b> <b>through</b> the building, it leaked in the rain, and basic amenities like toilets were missing. Built on what was then the edge of town, it was a building without comforts.|$|E
