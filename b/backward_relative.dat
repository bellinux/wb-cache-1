5000|$|Assume {{that the}} wave {{generator}} is the input rotation. As the wave generator plug rotates, the flex spline teeth which are meshed {{with those of}} the circular spline slowly change position. The major axis of the flex spline's ellipse rotates with wave generator, so the points where the teeth mesh revolve around the center point {{at the same rate as}} the wave generator's shaft. The key to the design of the strain wave gear is that there are fewer teeth (often for example two fewer) on the flex spline than there are on the circular spline. This means that for every full rotation of the wave generator, the flex spline would be required to rotate a slight amount (two teeth in this example) <b>backward</b> <b>relative</b> to the circular spline. Thus the rotation action of the wave generator results in a much slower rotation of the flex spline in the opposite direction.|$|E

In walking, backward slipping was more frequent, whereas forward slipping was more frequent when turning. Stopping and gait initiation engendered only {{forward and backward}} slipping, respectively. Based on slip distance and sliding velocity, severity of forward slipping was least in walking than for the other gait tasks, whereas the tasks had similar effects on <b>backward</b> slipping. <b>Relative</b> to the dry surface, heel and foot contact angles reduced and heel contact (HC) velocity increased for all gait tasks on the contaminated surface. Ground reaction forces were generally lower on the contaminated surface, suggesting kinetic adaptation immediately following HC.

With progress in the economy, society and urbanization, the ethnic minority areas will be greatly developed.

50|$|The {{strain wave}} gearing theory {{is based on}} elastic {{dynamics}} and utilizes the flexibility of metal. The mechanism has three basic components: a wave generator, a flexspline, and a circular spline. More complex versions have a fourth component normally used to shorten the overall length or to increase the gear reduction within a smaller diameter, but still follow the same basic principles.The wave generator {{is made up of}} two separate parts: an elliptical disk called a wave generator plug and an outer ball bearing. The gear plug is inserted into the bearing, giving the bearing an elliptical shape as well.The flexspline is like a shallow cup. The sides of the spline are very thin, but the bottom is thick and rigid. This results in significant flexibility of the walls at the open end due to the thin wall, but in the closed side being quite rigid and able to be tightly secured (to a shaft, for example). Teeth are positioned radially around the outside of the open end of the flexspline. The flexspline fits tightly over the wave generator, so that when the wave generator plug is rotated, the flexspline deforms to the shape of a rotating ellipse but does not rotate with the wave generator.The circular spline is a rigid circular ring with teeth on the inside. The flexspline and wave generator are placed inside the circular spline, meshing the teeth of the flexspline and the circular spline. Because the flexspline has an elliptical shape, its teeth only actually mesh with the teeth of the circular spline in two regions {{on opposite sides of the}} flexspline, along the major axis of the ellipse.Assume that the wave generator is the input rotation. As the wave generator plug rotates, the flexspline teeth which are meshed with those of the circular spline change. The major axis of the flexspline actually rotates with wave generator, so the points where the teeth mesh revolve around the center point at the same rate as the wave generator. The key to the design of the strain wave gear is that there are fewer teeth (for example two fewer) on the flexspline than there are on the circular spline. This means that for every full rotation of the wave generator, the flexspline would be required to rotate a slight amount (two teeth, for example) <b>backward</b> <b>relative</b> to the circular spline. Thus the rotation action of the wave generator results in a much slower rotation of the flexspline in the opposite direction.For a strain wave gearing mechanism, the gearing reduction ratio can be calculated from the number of teeth on each gear: For example, if there are 202 teeth on the circular spline and 200 on the flexspline, the reduction ratio is (200 − 202)/200 = −0.01Thus the flexspline spins at 1/100 the speed of the wave generator plug and in the opposite direction. This allows different reduction ratios to be set without changing the mechanism's shape, increasing its weight, or adding stages. The range of possible gear ratios is limited by tooth size limits for a given configuration.|$|E

40|$|Studies {{have shown}} that the {{position}} of a target stimulus is misperceived owing to ongoing motion. Although static forces (fixation, landmarks) affect perceived position, motion remains the overwhelming force driving estimates of position. Motion endpoint estimates biased in the direction of motion are perceptual signatures of motion's dominant role in localization. We sought conditions in which static forces exert the predominant influence over perceived position: stimulus displays for which target position is perceived <b>backward</b> <b>relative</b> to motion. We used a target that moved diagonally with constant speed, abruptly turned 90 ° and continued at constant speed; observers localized the discontinuity. This yielded a previously undescribed effect, “turn-point shift,” the tendency of observers to estimate the position of orthogonal direction change <b>backward</b> <b>relative</b> to subsequent motion direction. Display and mislocalization direction differ from past studies. Static forces (foveal attraction, repulsion by subsequently occupied spatial positions) were found to be responsible. Delayed turn-point estimates, reconstructed from probing the entire trajectory, shifted the horizontal coordinate forward in the direction of motion. This implies more than one percept of turn-point position. As various estimates of turn-point position arise at different times, under different task demands, the perceptual system does not necessarily resolve conflicts between them...|$|E

An interaction regime of the electron beam counterpropagating to the laser pulse is employed, when pronounced high-energy x-ray double peaks emerge at different angles near the <b>backward</b> direction <b>relative</b> to the initial electron motion. This is achieved in the relativistic interaction domain, with the additional requirements that the electron energy is much lower than that necessary for the electron reflection condition at the laser peak, and the stochasticity effects in the photon emission are weak.

40|$|Long ago an {{unexpected}} and unexplainable phenomena was observed. The distribution of muons from positive pion decay at rest was anisotropic with an excess in the <b>backward</b> direction <b>relative</b> to {{the direction of}} the proton beam from which the pions were created. Although this effect was observed by several different groups with pions produced by different means, the result was not accepted by the physics community, because it is in direct conflict with a large set of other experiments indicating that the pion is a pseudoscalar particle. It is possible to satisfy both sets of experiments if helicity-zero vector particles exist and the pion is such a particle. Helicity-zero vector particles have direction but no net spin. For the neutral pion to be a vector particle requires an additional modification to conventional theory as discussed herein. An experiment is proposed which can prove that the asymmetry in the distribution of muons from pion decay is a genuine physical effect because the asymmetry can be modified in a controllable manner.

40|$|That many {{industries}} exhibit {{highly concentrated}} market structures, even at the global level, calls for trade theoretic analyses which can accommodate this fact. We present a two-country, general equilibrium analysis in which high concentration levels can be sustained through the interaction between R&D and market structure, whilst emphasizing the effects of trade and industrial policy on wages and welfare. The world economy is characterized by asymmetric initial conditions and populations. If initial conditions are very different, freetrade reduces wages in a <b>backward</b> economy, <b>relative</b> to autarky. However, the advanced economy always achieves higher wages through trade. Welfare gains from trade arise when economies are either very similar or very different. In the intermediate case, when initial conditions are not too different, and the advanced economy’s population is not very large, the backward economy loses from trade, while the advanced economy gains. A compensation mechanism is feasible and would ensure that no nation loses from trade. The analysis provides formal criteria for the choice of trade partners {{and the formation of}} trade blocs.

40|$|ABSTRACT: As a {{reinforcing}} material the geosynthetics {{are widely used}} in engineering practice to strengthen the foundation, slope, road, pavement, crushed-stone column, etc. However, the study on the reinforcement mechanism and the relevant design theory are much <b>backward</b> <b>relative</b> to the engineering application. As a result, the development of reinforcement technology was inhibited. The need for studying the interaction behavior between geosynthetics and soil has been realized by Chinese engineer. This paper firstly presents some typical views on the reinforcement mechanism in China. All the mechanism of reinforcement {{can be divided into}} two aspects: the direct reinforcement effect, which is resulted from the contact surface between soil and reinforced material, and the indirect reinforcement effect, which is resulted from the composite soil around the contact-face. Both effects have functions of improving rigidity, re-distributing stress and strain fields, changing the failure mode of soil, etc. Particularly, the mechanism associated with shear-band in the soil adjacent to contact-face is discussed in details. Thereafter, the results from laboratory tests, modeling tests and field observation are presented in the paper.
