5|$|Although practised in Basse Casamance for centuries, rice {{cultivation}} has <b>been</b> <b>threatened</b> {{since the late}} 1960s. Productivity has declined because many workers have opted for life in the city, even though they continue to support their community. The drought of the 1970s and 1980s further aggravated the situation.|$|E
5|$|Gondor {{had long}} <b>been</b> <b>threatened</b> by the nearby realm of Mordor, and in 3018 the Dark Lord Sauron began the War of the Ring, attacking the ruined city of Osgiliath that guarded the passage to Minas Tirith. Faramir and Boromir {{commanded}} the defence, and {{were among those}} few who survived when {{the eastern half of}} Osgiliath was captured and the bridges across the River Anduin were destroyed.|$|E

5|$|In December 2007 Fernández de Kirchner became president. In 2008 {{the rural}} sector mobilized against a {{resolution}} that would have increased the export tax rate on soybean exports from 35% to 44.1%. Ultimately, the new taxation regime was abandoned. Official Argentine statistics {{are believed to have}} significantly underreported inflation since 2007, and independent economists publishing their own estimates of Argentine inflation have <b>been</b> <b>threatened</b> with fines and prosecution.|$|E
5|$|Darjeeling {{has several}} British-style public schools, which attract pupils {{from all over}} India and a few {{neighbouring}} countries. The varied culture of the town reflects its diverse demographic milieu comprising indigenous Bengali, Nepali, Lepcha, Bhutia, Tibetan, and other mainland Indian ethno-linguistic groups. Darjeeling, alongside its neighbouring town of Kalimpong, was {{the centre of the}} Gorkhaland movement in the 1980s. The town's fragile ecology has <b>been</b> <b>threatened</b> by a rising demand for environmental resources, stemming from growing tourist traffic and poorly planned urbanisation.|$|E
5|$|In November 2007 someone {{claiming}} to be an al-Qaeda member sent Rambhadracharya a letter telling him and his disciples either to accept Islam or {{to be prepared to}} die. Police superintendent Kamal Singh Rathore said that this letter had been sent from Haridwar, that Rambhadracharya's security arrangements had been increased and that an intensive investigation of the letter had been carried out. Gita Devi, secretary of JRHU, said that Rambhadracharya had <b>been</b> <b>threatened</b> by al-Qaeda, as Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas president Nrityagopal had been in the past.|$|E

50|$|The plant <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> by {{the loss}} and {{degradation}} of its habitat. In New Mexico it <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> by oil and gas development and {{the changes that have}} occurred on the land due to overgrazing, such as erosion and introduced species of plants.

5|$|Parties {{bringing}} {{judicial review}} must have sufficient {{interest in the}} challenged subject. Professor Mullen therefore {{suggests that it is}} at first glance surprising that standing was not contested: the appellants brought proceedings in their personal capacities, yet had not even <b>been</b> <b>threatened</b> with prosecution. However, he suggests that no challenge was made because the legislation was likely to be challenged at some point and it was more convenient for the Government to have the legal issue decided before the Hunting Act came into force. Moreover, the recent expansion of standing for issues of public interest, such as the validity of an Act of Parliament, would have made a successful challenge more difficult.|$|E
5|$|Silk weaving is the {{dominant}} industry in Varanasi. Muslims are the influential community in this industry with {{nearly half a million}} of them working as weavers, dyers, sari finishers, and salespersons. Weaving is typically done within the household, and most weavers are Momin Ansari Muslims. Varanasi is known throughout India for its production of very fine silk and Banarasi saris, brocades with gold and silver thread work, which are often used for weddings and special occasions. The production of silk often uses bonded child labour, though perhaps not at a higher rate than elsewhere in India. The silk weaving industry has recently <b>been</b> <b>threatened</b> by the rise of power looms and computer-generated designs and by competition from Chinese silk imports.|$|E
5|$|The Canadian Pacific Railway was {{instrumental}} in Banff's early years, building the Banff Springs Hotel and Chateau Lake Louise, and attracting tourists through extensive advertising. In the early 20th century, roads were built in Banff, at times by war internees from World War I, and through Great Depression-era public works projects. Since the 1960s, park accommodations have been open all year, with annual tourism visits to Banff increasing to over 5million in the 1990s. Millions more pass through the park on the Trans-Canada Highway. As Banff has over three million visitors annually, the health of its ecosystem has <b>been</b> <b>threatened.</b> In the mid-1990s, Parks Canada responded by initiating a two-year study, which resulted in management recommendations, and new policies that aim to preserve ecological integrity.|$|E

5|$|The {{lighthouse}} has <b>been</b> <b>threatened</b> by erosion for decades. In the 1930s, as {{a response}} to the erosion, a breakwater was constructed to protect the boat landing area. In 1996, the Connecticut Trust for Historic Preservation and the National Trust for Historic Preservation assisted the task of obtaining funding for a $4.5 million erosion-control project. The funds were approved in 1998 with the help of Connecticut Senators, Joseph Lieberman and Christopher Dodd and New Haven's Congressional Representative Rosa DeLauro. In 2001, the construction of a stone wall and creation of a buffer zone was completed. The second phase of the project calls for protective revetment on the south side of the island.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} histories had {{on occasion}} <b>been</b> <b>threatened</b> with political interference, {{particularly with the}} change in government in 1949. Kippenberger, a person of high standing with both {{the government and the}} ordinary New Zealander, was a strong advocate for the project, and was able to convince the new government of the merits of the official histories. Kippenberger encouraged a positive atmosphere at the War History Branch, despite a tight budget and at times crowded work conditions. He was proud of its rate of output, which exceeded the efforts of the better resourced official histories of Australia and Great Britain. By 1963, the War History Branch he had presided over for much of its life had produced nearly 50 major volumes.|$|E
5|$|Worlebury Camp (also {{known as}} Worlebury Hillfort) {{is the site}} of an Iron Age hillfort on Worlebury Hill, north of Weston-super-Mare in Somerset, England. The fort was {{designed}} for defence, as is evidenced by the number of walls and ditches around the site. Several large triangular platforms have been uncovered around the sides of the fort, lower down on the hillside. Nearly one hundred storage pits of various sizes were cut into the bedrock, and many of these had human remains, coins, and other artefacts in them. During the 19th and 20th centuries the fort has suffered damage and <b>been</b> <b>threatened</b> with complete destruction on multiple occasions. The site has been designated a Scheduled monument; it falls within the Weston Woods Local Nature Reserve which was declared to Natural England by North Somerset Council in 2005.|$|E

5|$|Paul, {{a member}} of his old unit, {{contacts}} him and reveals he is suffering similar terrifying experiences but is immediately killed when his car explodes. Jacob is dragged away from the wreckage by a bespectacled man. Commiserating after the funeral, the members of Jacob's old platoon confess that they have all been experiencing similarly horrifying hallucinations. Believing that they are suffering the effects of a military experiment performed on them without their knowledge or consent, the men hire a lawyer to investigate but he backs out of the case after reading military files documenting that the soldiers were never in combat and were discharged for psychological reasons. Jacob’s comrades soon apprehensively back down – Jacob angrily suspects they have <b>been</b> <b>threatened</b> into doing so. Jacob himself is later thrown into a car with intimidating men in suits who warn him against further investigation. He jumps from the moving car and is injured. He is taken to a hospital where he is restrained on a stretcher and wheeled down corridors full of grotesquely deformed patients before doctors, wielding barbaric metal instruments, inform him he is dead.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} storm reached its peak {{intensity}} on November20, the NHC issued a hurricane watch from Grand Isle, Louisiana, to Cedar Key, Florida. Later that day, {{a portion of the}} watch area was upgraded to a warning from Bay St. Louis, Mississippi to St. Marks, Florida. About 20,000employees on oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico were evacuated, many by helicopter. The USS Lexington left port from Naval Air Station Pensacola to ride out the storm in open waters, and aircraft in the region were flown inland. About 100,000people along the Florida Panhandle were told to leave their houses after Governor Bob Graham issued evacuation orders in 13counties. About 2,000people stayed in 34shelters in Panama City. Roads in the region suffered traffic jams from the large volume of evacuees. Portions of the Florida Gulf Coast had <b>been</b> <b>threatened</b> by Hurricane Elena earlier in the season, and some evacuees of that storm intended not to leave during Kate due to the poor shelter conditions that they had experienced. Governor Graham activated 300members of the Florida National Guard to prevent looting and to assist in evacuations. One person died from a stress-induced heart attack in Chipley after evacuating. Outside of Florida, about 2,200people fled Grand Isle, Louisiana.|$|E
5|$|The {{award was}} given posthumously on three occasions: to David Kaplan, an ABC News {{producer}} {{killed by a}} sniper in Sarajevo in 1992; to Paul Klebnikov, a Russian Forbes journalist {{shot to death in}} 2004 by unknown attackers; and to Atwar Bahjat, an Iraqi journalist for Al Arabiya who was abducted and murdered in February 2006. A number of other laureates had <b>been</b> <b>threatened</b> or attacked in the year preceding their award, such as Guatemalan journalist Byron Barrera (1991), whose wife was murdered in an attack on their car, and Željko Kopanja (2000), who lost his legs in a car bomb. Other laureates have been killed after their awards, such as Irish crime reporter Veronica Guerin (1995), awarded a year before her murder, and Palestinian cameraman Mazen Dana (1991), awarded two years before being fatally shot by a US soldier in Iraq. Eritrean journalist Fesshaye Yohannes (2002) died while still imprisoned; owing to conflicting reports and the secrecy of his confinement, the cause and year of his death remain unclear.|$|E
