5|$|France's {{defeat in}} Indochina, {{coupled with the}} German {{destruction}} of her armies just 14 years earlier, seriously damaged its prestige elsewhere in its colonial empire, {{as well as with}} its NATO allies, most importantly, the United States. Within its empire, the defeat in Indochina served to spur independence movements in other colonies, notably the North African territories from which many of the troops who fought at Điện Biên Phủ had <b>been</b> <b>recruited.</b>|$|E

Penn State halfback Lydell Mitchell had <b>been</b> <b>recruited</b> by Lester and {{originally intended}} to go to Maryland before he opted for Penn State instead. Lester was bothered by a similar situation with fullback Franco Harris, whose high school coach {{was a friend of}} Lester's. Lester attributed Maryland's football woes to the turnover at head coach and lack of depth because of recruitment shortcomings. Maryland won the finale against Virginia to finish the season with a 3–7 record.|$|E

5|$|The suit {{called for}} the school {{district}} to reverse its policy of racial segregation. The Topeka Board of Education operated separate elementary schools under an 1879 Kansas law, which permitted (but did not require) districts to maintain separate elementary school facilities for {{black and white students}} in 12 communities with populations over 15,000. The plaintiffs had <b>been</b> <b>recruited</b> by the leadership of the Topeka NAACP. Notable among the Topeka NAACP leaders were the chairman McKinley Burnett; Charles Scott, one of three serving as legal counsel for the chapter; and Lucinda Todd.|$|E
5000|$|New [...] "Area of Recruitment" [...] {{gameplay}} mechanic. In Rome, {{there was}} virtually no restriction on the units a faction could train {{in a given}} province: for example, Carthage could train exactly the same units in their capital city of Carthage as they could in their distant colonies in Spain. The exceptions were that Roman First Cohorts could only <b>be</b> <b>recruited</b> in Rome; Spartan hoplites could only <b>be</b> <b>recruited</b> in Sparta or Syracuse; and elephant and camel units could only <b>be</b> <b>recruited</b> in provinces that have those animals as resources. In RTR, the units that can <b>be</b> <b>recruited</b> in a province depend {{in large part on}} the province itself. Gallic infantry, for instance, can only <b>be</b> <b>recruited</b> in Gaul, but can <b>be</b> <b>recruited</b> there by any faction which controls it. Still, all factions do have their own typical units that can <b>be</b> <b>recruited</b> in any of their territories once the appropriate buildings have been constructed.|$|R

5|$|Cummings {{was among}} the first people {{accepted}} into USC's Civil Pilot Training Program in 1939. She completed an advanced aerobatics course and earned her pilot's license in 1940 and, by her 1941 graduation, had acquired enough training to begin work as an instructor. Having <b>been</b> <b>recruited</b> by Jacqueline Cochran, Cummings joined the Women's Auxiliary Ferrying Squadron in 1942, which soon became the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP). After graduating from training in Houston in May 1943, she served in World War II until the organization's deactivation in December 1944. During this time, {{she was a member of}} the 6th Ferrying Group out of Long Beach, California, eventually reaching the rank of First Lieutenant, and flew 18 different types of military aircraft. In the same month as her unit's deactivation, she married fellow military pilot Howard Critchell, whom she had a met at a base that was used as a ferry stop for the WASP.|$|E
5|$|If the {{proportion}} of barbarians was {{in the region of}} 25%, then it is probably much higher than in the 2nd-century regular army. If the same proportion had <b>been</b> <b>recruited</b> into the auxilia of the 2nd-century army, then in excess of 40% of recruits would have been barbarian-born, since the auxilia constituted 60% of the regular land army. There is no evidence that recruitment of barbarians was on such a large scale in the 2nd century. An analysis of named soldiers of non-Roman origin shows that 75% were Germanic: Franks, Alamanni, Saxons, Goths, and Vandals are attested in the Notitia unit names. Other significant sources of recruits were the Sarmatians from the Danubian lands; and Armenians and Iberians from the Caucasus region.|$|E

5|$|In {{the season}} one finale, Shelby adopts Quinn and Puck's newborn daughter, Beth. She leaves Vocal Adrenaline before the {{beginning}} of the next school year. Shelby returns in the second episode of the third season, having <b>been</b> <b>recruited</b> to lead a second glee club at McKinley High by Sugar Motta's father when Sugar is refused entry into New Directions. Shelby offers to include both Quinn and Puck in Beth's life. Struggling at being a mother, she forms a romantic bond with eighteen-year-old student Puck, leading to a sexual relationship before she tells him that their relationship is a mistake and resigns from McKinley in the eighth episode. While Menzel's musical performances on the show have been lauded, Shelby's storylines were characterized as rushed, incomprehensible and polarizing by contemporary reviewers.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the four}} British {{divisions}} mentioned above, Gillespie's {{was the first}} to penetrate the enemy's frontier. The Nepalese had anticipated that Dehra Dun would be the first place of assault, and had tasked Captain Balbhadra Kunwar with the fortification of the place. When Balbhadra Kunwar, commander of the Nepalese defence army at Dehradun, heard of the approach of the British Army and its size, he realised that {{it would be impossible to}} defend the city. He withdrew from Dehradun and moved his force of about 600, including dependents, to a hill north-east of the city. He subsequently took up a position in the small fort of Nalapani, Khalanga. His force was ethnically diverse, consisting of Magar soldiers belonging to the Purano Gorakh Battalion and soldiers that had <b>been</b> <b>recruited</b> from Garhwal and nearby areas. On 22 October, before the British declaration of war on 1 November 1814, Gillespie seized the Keree Pass leading into the Dun Valley. He then proceeded to Dehra unchallenged.|$|E

5|$|The Australian Services Reconnaissance Department (SRD) also {{collected}} {{intelligence on}} Labuan {{and other parts}} of the Brunei Bay area during May. On the first of the month several RAAF PBY Catalina aircraft carrying SRD personnel overflew Labuan. These aircraft later landed near two native prahu and questioned their crews; two sailors were flown back to an Allied base for further questioning. On 15 May two Malays working for the SRD were landed in Brunei Bay by a Catalina, and sailed to Labuan on board a prahu. These agents recruited a local civilian from Labuan, and the party was extracted by a Catalina near the mainland village of Kampong Mengalong on 19 May. The intelligence gained from these operations provided the Australians with a good understanding of Labuan's geography and infrastructure. In addition, civilians who had <b>been</b> <b>recruited</b> by the SRD's SEMUT 2 team (which had been parachuted into Borneo during April) provided intelligence on the size and movements of Labuan's garrison force.|$|E
5|$|The legions, {{which had}} been a mix of life {{professionals}} and civilian campaigners, was altered into a standing army of professionals only. The actual structure of the cohort army remained {{much the same as}} in the late Republic, although around the 1st centuryAD the first cohort of each legion was increased in size to a total of 800 soldiers. However, while the structure of the legions remained much the same, their make-up gradually changed. Whereas early Republican legions had been raised by a draft from eligible Roman citizens, imperial legions were recruited solely on a voluntary basis and from a much wider base of manpower. Likewise, whereas Republican legions had <b>been</b> <b>recruited</b> almost exclusively in Italy, early Imperial legions drew most of their recruits from Roman colonies in the provinces from 68AD onwards. One estimate places the proportion of Italian troops at 65% under Augustus in c.1AD, falling to around 49% by the end of Nero's reign.|$|E
5|$|The {{trial of}} Pierre Frugoli and Lucien Mattei opened on 30 November 1987 in Pau, France.

Frugoli, however, acknowledged that he had set out to kill ETA members. He stated that he had <b>been</b> <b>recruited</b> {{by members of the}} Spanish secret services, codenamed Francis and Miguel, in La Samaritaine bar in Marseilles port. With Mattei, he made several trips to San Sebastián to receive instructions for the attack, the last in the city's Orly Hotel three days before the attack. He claimed that Francis had offered him 100,000 francs for carrying out the attack and 50,000 more for each person killed. Francis then met them in Bayonne, supplying them with the weapons used in the attack and the identities of the desired targets.|$|E
