2500|$|Many animals use the {{variation}} in duration of melatonin production each day as a seasonal clock. In animals including humans, the profile of melatonin synthesis and secretion {{is affected by the}} variable duration of night in summer as compared to winter. The change in duration of secretion thus serves as a <b>biological</b> <b>signal</b> for the organization of daylength-dependent (photoperiodic) seasonal functions such as reproduction, behavior, coat growth, and camouflage coloring in seasonal animals. In seasonal breeders that do not have long gestation periods and that mate during longer daylight hours, the melatonin signal controls the seasonal variation in their sexual physiology, and similar physiological effects can be induced by exogenous melatonin in animals including mynah birds and hamsters. Melatonin can suppress libido by inhibiting secretion of luteinizing hormone [...] and follicle-stimulating hormone [...] from the anterior pituitary gland, especially in mammals that have a breeding season when daylight hours are long. The reproduction of long-day breeders is repressed by melatonin and the reproduction of short-day breeders is stimulated by melatonin.|$|E

50|$|A Driven Right Leg Circuit or DRL circuit is an {{electric}} circuit {{that is often}} added to <b>biological</b> <b>signal</b> amplifiers to reduce Common-mode interference. <b>Biological</b> <b>signal</b> amplifiers such as ECG (Electrocardiogram) EEG (Electroencephalogram) or EMG circuits measure very small electrical signals emitted by the body, often as small as several micro-volts (millionths of a volt). Unfortunately, the patient's body can also act as an antenna which picks up electromagnetic interference, especially 50/60 Hz noise from electrical power lines. This interference can obscure the biological signals, making them very hard to measure. Right Leg Driver circuitry is used to eliminate interference noise by actively canceling the interference.|$|E

50|$|The Wnt {{signaling}} pathways are a {{group of}} signal transduction pathways made of proteins that pass signals into a cell through cell surface receptors. Three Wnt signaling pathways have been characterized: the canonical Wnt pathway, the noncanonical planar cell polarity pathway, and the noncanonical Wnt/calcium pathway. All three pathways are activated by binding a Wnt-protein ligand to a Frizzled family receptor, which passes the <b>biological</b> <b>signal</b> to the Dishevelled protein inside the cell. The canonical Wnt pathway leads to regulation of gene transcription, and {{is thought to be}} negatively regulated in part by the SPATS1 gene. The noncanonical planar cell polarity pathway regulates the cytoskeleton that is responsible for the shape of the cell. The noncanonical Wnt/calcium pathway regulates calcium inside the cell. Wnt signaling pathways use either nearby cell-cell communication (paracrine) or same-cell communication (autocrine). They are highly evolutionarily conserved in animals, which means they are similar across animal species from fruit flies to humans.|$|E
5000|$|A chemoreceptor, {{also known}} as chemosensor, is a {{specialized}} sensory receptor cell which transduces (responds to) a chemical substance (endogenous or induced) and generates a <b>biological</b> <b>signal.</b> This signal {{may be in the}} form of an action potential if the chemoreceptor is a neuron (nerve cell), or in the form of a neurotransmitter that can activate a nearby nerve fiber if the chemosensor is a specialized sensory receptor cell, such as the taste receptor in a taste bud or in an internal peripheral chemoreceptor such as the carotid body (ex, in chemotherapy). In more general terms, a chemosensor detects toxic or hazardous chemicals in the internal or external environment of the human body (e.x. chemotherapy) and transmits that information to the central nervous system, (and rarely the peripheral nervous system), in order to expel the biologically active toxins from the blood, and prevent further consumption of alcohol and/or other acutely toxic recreational intoxicants.|$|E

50|$|Some Archean rock {{formations}} show macroscopic similarity to modern microbial structures, {{leading to the}} inference that these structures represent evidence of ancient life, namely stromatolites. However, others regard these patterns as being due to natural material deposition or some other abiogenic mechanism. Scientists have argued for a biological origin of stromatolites due {{to the presence of}} organic globule clusters within the thin layers of the stromatolites, of aragonite nanocrystals (both features of current stromatolites), and because of the persistence of an inferred <b>biological</b> <b>signal</b> through changing environmental circumstances.Stromatolites are a major constituent of the fossil record of the first forms of life on earth. The earliest fossils date to 3.7 billion years ago. They peaked about 1.25 billion years ago and subsequently declined in abundance and diversity, so that by the start of the Cambrian they had fallen to 20% of their peak. The most widely supported explanation is that stromatolite builders fell victim to grazing creatures (the Cambrian substrate revolution); this theory implies that sufficiently complex organisms were common over 1 billion years ago.|$|E

Implicit silhouette and landmark matching are considered for the cinematic images and are combined with global statistical congealing-type measurements of the optical one. The problem is reformulated using a discrete MRF, where optical imaging costs are expressed in singleton (global) potentials, while smoothness constraints as well as cinematic measurements through pair-wise potentials. Promising experimental results demonstrate the potentials of our approach...|$|E
