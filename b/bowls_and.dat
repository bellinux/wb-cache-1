5|$|Even where metal {{objects such}} as <b>bowls</b> <b>and</b> dishes {{do not seem to}} have {{geometric}} decoration, still the designs, such as arabesques, are often set in octagonal compartments or arranged in concentric bands around the object.

Eva Baer notes that while this design was essentially simple, it was elaborated by metalworkers into intricate patterns interlaced with arabesques, sometimes organised around further basic Islamic patterns, such as the hexagonal pattern of six overlapping circles.|$|E
