5|$|The {{origin of}} the white belt is unknown, but {{generally}} presumed {{to have come from}} cross breeding with Lakenvelder (Dutch <b>Belted)</b> cattle. A Polled Herd Book was started in 1852 which registered both Aberdeen-Angus and Galloways. Galloway breeders acquired their own herd book in 1878. The Dun and <b>Belted</b> Galloway Association was formed in Scotland in 1921, and in 1951 the name of the organisation was changed to the <b>Belted</b> Galloway Society and dun cattle were no longer registered. It also keeps and records pedigrees for <b>Belted</b> Galloways and oversees the registration of White and Red Galloways.|$|E
5|$|<b>Belted</b> Galloways are {{primarily}} raised for their quality marbled beef, {{although they are}} sometimes milked and purchased to adorn pastures due to their striking appearance.|$|E
5|$|Eight {{species of}} birds inhabit the {{floodplains}} and slopes near Mahoning Creek. These include scarlet tanagers, black-throated green warblers, <b>belted</b> kingfishers, gray catbirds, black-capped chickadees, eastern wood-peewees, Louisiana waterthrushes, and wood thrushes.|$|E
5000|$|The {{cost of the}} Steel <b>belt</b> is high. Compare {{with other}} {{materials}} ( [...] plastic <b>belt),</b> the steel <b>belt</b> is more expensive. However, the steel <b>belt</b> have an advantage overall because the Steel <b>Belt</b> are not petroleum based material. The Steel <b>Belt</b> making prices per linear foot is less expensive compared to plastic <b>belt.</b> Furthermore, the Steel <b>Belt</b> lead by low cost of process compared to the plastic <b>belt.</b>|$|R
50|$|A webbed <b>belt,</b> {{military}} <b>belt</b> or skater <b>belt</b> {{is a type}} of <b>belt</b> {{distinguished by}} its <b>belt</b> buckle design and lack of holes in the cord, which is usually found in other <b>belts</b> where a pin is used as the fastening mechanism in the <b>belt</b> buckle.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>belt</b> must be worn if {{clothing}} item has <b>belt</b> loops. <b>Belts</b> {{may not be}} accessorized or have adornments. A <b>belt</b> {{cannot be}} worn {{if there are no}} <b>belt</b> loops.|$|R
5|$|Examples of {{clothing}} in Parthian inspired sculptures {{have been found}} in excavations at Hatra, in northwestern Iraq. Statues erected there feature the typical Parthian shirt (qamis), combined with trousers and made with fine, ornamented materials. The aristocratic elite of Hatra adopted the bobbed hairstyles, headdresses, and <b>belted</b> tunics worn by the nobility belonging to the central Arsacid court. The trouser-suit was even worn by the Arsacid kings, as shown on the reverse images of coins. The Parthian trouser-suit was also adopted in Palmyra, Syria, along with the use of Parthian frontality in art.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to bald eagles, which {{live in the}} IBA year round and have successfully established a breeding population there, the IBA is home to <b>belted</b> kingfishers, scarlet tanagers, black-throated blue warblers, common mergansers, blue and green heron, hermit thrushes, and wood ducks. Large numbers of ospreys use the gorge during spring and fall migration periods. The woodlands are inhabited by the ruffed grouse, Pennsylvania's state bird, and wild turkeys. Swainson's thrush breeds in the IBA and the northern harrier breeds and overwinters in Pine Creek Gorge.|$|E
5|$|Musically, I'm Breathless {{consists}} predominantly of jazz, {{swing and}} pop songs. The tracks reflected Madonna's showgirl personality and {{were influenced by}} her relationship with Beatty. The singer wanted to create music that would fit the style and production of the film, set {{in the days of}} the Untouchables law enforcement, and sang the songs accordingly. In some areas she pitched her vocals and <b>belted</b> the notes when necessary. She even smoked cigarettes in order to portray the vocals of her character Breathless. Beatty and singer Mandy Patinkin were featured as duet partners on three of the songs.|$|E
40|$|Use of seatbelts in late model {{cars with}} {{automatic}} or manual <b>belt</b> systems {{was observed in}} suburban Washington, DC, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Philadelphia. In cars with automatic two-point <b>belt</b> systems, the use of shoulder <b>belts</b> by drivers was substantially {{higher than in the}} same model cars with manual three-point <b>belts.</b> This finding was true in varying degrees whatever the type of automatic <b>belt,</b> including cars with detachable nonmotorized <b>belts,</b> cars with detachable motorized <b>belts,</b> and especially cars with nondetachable motorized <b>belts.</b> Most of these automatic shoulder <b>belts</b> systems include manual lap <b>belts.</b> Use of lap <b>belts</b> was lower in cars with automatic two-point <b>belt</b> systems than in the same model cars with manual three-point belts; precisely how much lower could not be reliably estimated in this survey. Use of shoulder and lap <b>belts</b> was slightly higher in General Motors cars with detachable automatic three-point <b>belts</b> compared with the same model cars with manual three-point belts; in Hondas {{there was no difference in}} the rates of use of manual three-point <b>belts</b> and the rates of use of automatic three-point <b>belts...</b>|$|R
50|$|Black <b>belt</b> holders (yudansha) all wear a black <b>belt</b> {{that may}} be {{embroidered}} with the holder's name and style. There are ceremonial <b>belts</b> for high-ranking black <b>belts,</b> including the red-and-black panelled <b>belt</b> for 5th Dan, the red-and-white panelled <b>belt</b> for holders of 6th, 7th and 8th Dan, and a red <b>belt</b> for 9th and 10th Dan masters.|$|R
50|$|Power {{transmission}} {{is a function}} of <b>belt</b> tension. However, also increasing with tension is stress (load) on the <b>belt</b> and bearings. The ideal <b>belt</b> is that of the lowest tension that does not slip in high loads. <b>Belt</b> tensions should also be adjusted to <b>belt</b> type, size, speed, and pulley diameters. <b>Belt</b> tension is determined by measuring the force to deflect the <b>belt</b> a given distance per inch of pulley. Timing <b>belts</b> need only adequate tension to keep the <b>belt</b> in contact with the pulley.|$|R
5|$|Waterfowl at {{the refuge}} include Canada Geese, Wood Ducks, swans, Northern Pintails, Green Herons, teal, mergansers, <b>Belted</b> Kingfishers, and American Wigeon among others. Birds that spend time there include, Great Blue Herons, Sandhill Cranes, Oregon Juncos, wrens, European Starlings, blackbirds, nuthatches, Pacific-slope Flycatchers, Red-tailed Hawks, American Goldfinches, Peregrine Falcons, Yellow Warblers, Western Flycatchers, Killdeer, Northern Harriers, Ospreys, egrets, quail, pheasants, Golden-crowned Kinglets, owls, and Black-headed Grosbeaks {{to name a}} few. There is also a pair of Bald Eagles. The year it was created {{officials}} counted 24 different bird species. By 2008 there were 185 birds species represented at the refuge.|$|E
5|$|Arab and Islamic {{influences}} strongly mark Antemoro culture. Traditionally, Antemoro men's clothing {{included a}} turban or fez style hat and long, loose robes {{similar to those}} worn in {{many other parts of}} the Muslim world. Harefo reeds were woven to form mats (tafitsihy) that were sewn together to form jackets and tunics (with long sleeves for older men); a loincloth made of fanto (beaten barkcloth) was worn beneath the ensemble. Women wore sleeveless sheath dresses made from two or three reed mats sewn together and <b>belted</b> at the waist or drawn over one shoulder. Adolescent and adult women often also wore a mat bandeau or halter top. It was historically forbidden for women to wear lambas made of cotton or any other material than woven raffia mats, as it was believed this could render them more attractive to men outside their clan, with whom they were forbidden to marry.|$|E
5|$|Located in the Northern Rockies, Missoula has {{a typical}} Rocky Mountain ecology. Local {{wildlife}} includes populations of white-tailed deer, black bears, osprey, and bald eagles. During the winter, rapid snowmelt on Mount Jumbo {{due to its}} steep slope leaves grass available for grazing elk and mule deer. The rivers around Missoula provide nesting habitats for bank swallows, northern rough-winged swallows and <b>belted</b> kingfishers. Killdeer and spotted sandpipers can be seen foraging for insects along the gravel bars. Other species include song sparrows, catbirds, several species of warblers, and the pileated woodpecker. The rivers also provide cold, clean water for native fish such as westslope cutthroat trout and bull trout. The meandering streams also attract beaver and wood ducks. The parks also host a variety of snakes such as racers, garter snakes, and rubber boa.|$|E
40|$|The use of {{automatic}} safety <b>belts</b> among motorists {{throughout the state}} of Michigan was examined in May 1990 {{as part of a}} broader direct-observation survey to measure compliance with Michigan's mandatory safety <b>belt</b> use law. Use of the two most common types {{of automatic}} <b>belt</b> systems were measured: the nonmotorized detachable three-point lap and shoulder <b>belt</b> system and the motorized shoulder <b>belt</b> with manual lap <b>belt</b> system. A total of 828 drivers and 237 front-right passengers were observed with automatic <b>belt</b> systems between April 30, 1990 and May 24, 1990. Use of nonmotorized detachable three-point lap and shoulder <b>belt</b> systems was 74. 3 %. Lap <b>belt</b> use of motorized shoulder and manual lap <b>belt</b> systems was 79. 2 %. Of all motorized shoulder <b>belt</b> and manual lap <b>belt</b> systems observed, 97. 4 % had the shoulder <b>belts</b> connected...|$|R
50|$|Black <b>belt</b> holders (yudansha) all wear a black <b>belt</b> {{that may}} be {{embroidered}} with the holder's name and style. There are ceremonial <b>belts</b> for high-ranking black <b>belts,</b> including the red and white panelled <b>belt</b> for holders of 6th, 7th and 8th Dan, and a red <b>belt</b> for 9th and 10th Dan masters.

50|$|Back <b>belts,</b> or {{lumbar support}} <b>belts,</b> are {{generally}} lightweight <b>belts</b> worn around {{the lower back}} to provide support to the lumbar. Industrial back <b>belts</b> tend {{to be similar to}} weight lifting <b>belts</b> or special <b>belts</b> used in medical rehabilitation therapy. Back <b>belts</b> are popular among workers across a number of industries—airline baggage handlers, warehouse workers, grocery clerks, etc.—specifically to prevent lifting injuries.|$|R
5|$|The {{streets in}} {{downtown}} Ann Arbor conform to a grid pattern, though {{this pattern is}} less common in the surrounding areas. Major roads branch out from the downtown district like spokes on a wheel to the highways surrounding the city. The city is <b>belted</b> by three freeways: I-94, which runs along the southern and western portion of the city; U.S. Highway 23 (US23), which primarily runs along {{the eastern edge of}} Ann Arbor; and M-14, which runs along the northern edge of the city. Other nearby highways include US12 (Michigan Ave.), M-17 (Washtenaw Ave.), and M-153 (Ford Rd.). Several of the major surface arteries lead to the I-94/M-14 interchange in the west, US 23 in the east, and the city's southern areas. The city also has a system of bike routes and paths and includes the nearly complete Washtenaw County Border-to-Border Trail.|$|E

25|$|The {{pelerine}} was {{a popular}} name for wide, capelike collars that extended over the shoulders and covered the upper chest. Sometimes they had layers of tiered fabric, long front panels hanging down from center front, or were also <b>belted</b> at the natural waistline.|$|E
40|$|Belt-positioning booster {{seats are}} {{recommended}} {{for children who}} use vehicle seat <b>belts</b> as primary restraints but who {{are too small to}} obtain good <b>belt</b> fit. Previous research has shown that belt-positioning boosters reduce injury risk, but the <b>belt</b> fit produced by the wide range of boosters in the US market has not previously been assessed. The present study describes the development of a method for quantifying <b>belt</b> fit with a Hybrid-III 6 -year-old test dummy. The measurement method was applied in a laboratory seat mockup to 31 boosters (10 in both backless and highback modes) across a range of <b>belt</b> geometries obtained from in-vehicle measurements. <b>Belt</b> fit varied widely across boosters. Backless boosters generally produced better lap <b>belt</b> fit than highback boosters, largely because adding the back component moved the dummy forward with respect to the lap <b>belt</b> routing guides. However, highback boosters produced more consistent shoulder <b>belt</b> fit {{because of the presence of}} <b>belt</b> routing guides near the shoulder. Some boosters performed well on both lap <b>belt</b> and shoulder <b>belt</b> fit. Lap <b>belt</b> fit in dedicated boosters was generally better than in combination restraints that also can be used with an integrated harness. Results demonstrate that certain booster design features produce better <b>belt</b> fit across a wide range of <b>belt</b> geometries.

25|$|As {{trees are}} drowned by rising beaver impoundments, they become ideal nesting sites for woodpeckers, which carve {{cavities}} that attract many other bird species, including flycatchers (Empidonax spp.), tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor), tits (Paridae spp.), wood ducks (Aix sponsa), goldeneyes (Bucephala spp.), mergansers (Mergus spp.), owls (Tytonidae, Strigidae) and American kestrels (Falco sparverius). Piscivores, including herons (Ardea spp.), grebes (Podicipedidae), cormorants (Phalacrocorax ssp.), American bitterns (Botaurus lentiginosa), great egret (Ardea alba), snowy egret (Egretta thula), mergansers, and <b>belted</b> kingfishers (Megaceryle alcyon), use beaver ponds for fishing. Hooded mergansers (Lophodytes cucullatus), green heron (Butorides virescens), {{great blue heron}} (Ardea herodias) and <b>belted</b> kingfisher appeared more frequently in New York wetlands where beaver were active than at sites with no beaver activity.|$|E
