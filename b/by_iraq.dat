5|$|On August 1, 1990, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein {{sent the}} invading Iraqi forces into {{neighboring}} Kuwait, a small petroleum-rich state long claimed <b>by</b> <b>Iraq</b> {{as part of}} its territory. This invasion sparked the initiation of the Persian Gulf War and it brought worldwide condemnation. An estimated 140,000 Iraqi troops quickly took control of Kuwait City and moved on to the Saudi Arabia/Kuwait border. The United States had already begun to develop contingency plans for the defense of Saudi Arabia by the U.S. Central Command, headed by General Norman Schwarzkopf, because of its important petroleum reserves.|$|E

He also scored a goal in Iraq's defeat against Yugoslavia 4–2. Iraq were knocked out of the competition after drawing a game and losing the other two.|$|E
5|$|Between 1964 and 1975, both Britain and France {{delivered}} significant {{quantities of}} arms, including Hunters, to Iraq. The Hunters {{were far more}} effective in fighting guerrilla activity than the Russian MiG-17s then operated <b>by</b> <b>Iraq.</b> In 1967, Hunters of the Iraqi Air Force saw action after the Six-Day War between Israel and several neighbouring Arab nations. During the War of Attrition Iraqi Hunters usually operated from bases in Egypt and Syria. While flying a Hunter from Iraqi Airbase H3, Flight Lieutenant Saiful Azam, on exchange from the Pakistan Air Force, shot down three Israeli jets including a Sud Aviation Vautour and a Mirage IIICJ. Some missions were also flown by the Royal Jordanian Air Force, {{but most of the}} Jordanian Hunters were destroyed on the ground {{on the first day of}} the Six-Day War. Replacement Hunters for Jordanian service were acquired from both Britain and Saudi Arabia in the war's aftermath. These were used with considerable success in ground attacks against Syrian Army tanks during the Black September Crisis.|$|E

50|$|In 1989, it {{appeared}} that Saudi-Iraqi relations, strong during the war, would be maintained. A pact of non-interference and non-aggression was signed between the countries, followed by a Kuwaiti-Iraqi deal for Iraq to supply Kuwait with water for drinking and irrigation, although a request for Kuwait to lease Iraq Umm Qasr was rejected. Saudi-backed development projects were hampered <b>by</b> <b>Iraq's</b> large debts, even with the demobilization of 200,000 soldiers. Iraq also looked to increase arms production so as to become an exporter, although {{the success of these}} projects was also restrained <b>by</b> <b>Iraq's</b> obligations; in Iraq, resentment to OPEC's controls mounted.|$|R

25|$|Testimony to {{the close}} {{relationship}} shared <b>by</b> <b>Iraq</b> and western Iran during the Abbasid era and later centuries, {{is the fact}} that the two regions came to share the same name. The western region of Iran (ancient Media) was called 'Irāq-e 'Ajamī ("Persian Iraq"), while central-southern Iraq (Babylonia) was called 'Irāq al-'Arabī ("Arabic Iraq") or Bābil ("Babylon"). And the name Iraq comes from the ancient Mesopotamian city Uruk, which suggests an even older relationship.|$|E
