5|$|Back in Detroit, Sarif {{admits to}} Adam that the Illuminati {{are behind the}} attacks. Adam infiltrates a Humanity Front rally and discovers Sandoval's location. Sandoval admits his {{involvement}} in the kidnapping and gives Adam the lead to find the researchers. Back in Sarif HQ, Adam meets Hugh Darrow, who is currently working to stave off global warming with the newly constructed Panchaea Facility in the Arctic. Adam, along with other augmented people, also start experiencing painful glitches, with authorities urging them to have a <b>biochip</b> replacement. Pritchard locates the tracking beacon of one of the scientists, taking Adam back to Hengsha, where he and Malik are ambushed by Belltower. The beacon leads Adam to Tong Si Hung, who has just been implanted with the now-deceased scientist's arm. Under Tong's direction, Adam manages to stow away in a stasis pod {{in the wake of a}} staged explosion, waking up a few days later in a secret Singapore base. He finds the kidnapped scientists, and learns that the <b>biochip</b> malfunctions were staged to distribute the result of their research: a new <b>biochip</b> to control augmented humans. Adam and the scientists stage a distraction, allowing him to infiltrate the facility's secret bunker. Here he faces Namir one last time, then finds Megan. Confronted, Megan tells him that she was kidnapped for her research; the genetic key to make all humans compatible with augmentations, which she found in Adam's DNA — and to help Darrow foil the Illuminati's plans.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Microfluidic <b>biochips</b> are {{replacing}} the conventional biochemical analyzers by integrating {{all the necessary}} functions for biochemical analysis using microfluidics. <b>Biochips</b> are used in many application areas, such as, in vitro diagnostics, drug discovery, biotech and ecology. The focus {{of this paper is}} on continuous-flow <b>biochips,</b> where the basic building block is a microvalve and, by combining these microvalves, more complex units such as mixers, switches, multiplexers can be built. Al-though the complexity of <b>biochips</b> is increasing, they are still designed manually, using software such as AutoCAD. Another roadblock in the deployment of microfluidic <b>biochips</b> is the lack of test techniques: defective chips lead to repetition of experiments, which is undesirable due to increased labor and high reagent cost.

40|$|With the {{advancement}} of digital microfluidics technology, applications such as on-chip DNA analysis, point of care diagnosis and automated drug discovery are common nowadays. The use of Digital Microfluidics <b>Biochips</b> (DMFBs) in disease assessment and recognition of target molecules had become popular {{during the past few}} years. The reliability of these DMFBs is crucial when they are used in various medical applications. Errors found in these <b>biochips</b> are mainly due to the defects developed during droplet manipulation, chip degradation and inaccuracies in the bio-assay experiments. The recently proposed Micro-electrode-dot Array (MEDA) -based DMFBs involve both fluidic and electronic domains in the micro-electrode cell. Thus, the testing techniques for these <b>biochips</b> should be revised in order to ensure proper functionality. This paper describes recent advances in the testing technologies for digital microfluidics <b>biochips,</b> which would serve as a useful platform for developing revised/new testing techniques for MEDA-based <b>biochips.</b> Therefore, the relevancy of these techniques with respect to testing of MEDA-based <b>biochips</b> is analyzed in order to exploit the full potential of these <b>biochips...</b>|$|R

Thus, we organized this tutorial at Embedded Systems Week, to inform researchers about the potential of <b>biochips.</b> We presented the vision, the research challenges and an overview of the design automation as well as of the fabrication work. We show how the conventional methods in embedded systems can be applied to <b>biochips</b> to optimize their execution and design.

500|$|Moments later, Darrow appears live on {{television}} and broadcasts a modified signal that throws any augmented person with the new <b>biochip</b> into a fear-driven, murderous frenzy. Jensen evacuates the scientists, and commandeers an orbital flight module to reach Panchaea. He confronts Darrow, who reveals that he wants humanity to abandon the augmentation technology he invented, because he believes it will destroy human identity. Adam sets out to disable Panchaea's Hyron Project supercomputer and end the broadcast; on the way, he encounters Taggart and Sarif, who each urge him to side with them and further their own agendas. At the heart of Panchaea, Jensen first confronts Zhao Yun Ru when she tries to hijack the signal for her own use; then Eliza, who offers Jensen four choices. Jensen can either broadcast the full truth and distance humanity from augmentations; rig the broadcast so it throws suspicion on the Humanity Front and allows further development of augmentation technology; send out a report blaming the incident on contaminated Neuropozyne so Taggart's group and by extension the Illuminati find new support; or destroy Panchea, leaving no-one to [...] "spin the story". Depending on the choice and whether Jensen has taken a pacifist or violent approach through the game, his final narration varies.|$|E

2500|$|A DNA {{microarray}} (also {{commonly known}} as DNA chip or <b>biochip)</b> {{is a collection of}} microscopic DNA spots attached to a solid surface. Scientists use DNA microarrays to measure the expression levels of large numbers of genes simultaneously or to genotype multiple regions of a genome. Each DNA spot contains picomoles (10−12 moles) of a specific DNA sequence, known as probes (or reporters or oligos). These can be a short section of a gene or other DNA element that are used to hybridize a cDNA or cRNA (also called anti-sense RNA) [...] sample (called target) under high-stringency conditions. Probe-target hybridization is usually detected and quantified by detection of fluorophore-, silver-, or chemiluminescence-labeled targets to determine relative abundance of nucleic acid sequences in the target. The original nucleic acid arrays were macro arrays approximately 9cm × 12cm and the first computerized image based analysis was published in 1981.|$|E

The <b>biochip</b> is used to simultaneously analyze a panel of related tests in a single sample, producing a patient profile. The patient profile can be used in disease screening, diagnosis, monitoring disease progression or monitoring treatment. Performing multiple analyses simultaneously, described as multiplexing, allows a significant reduction in processing time and the amount of patient sample required. <b>Biochip</b> Array Technology is a novel application of a familiar methodology, using sandwich, competitive and antibody-capture immunoassays.
