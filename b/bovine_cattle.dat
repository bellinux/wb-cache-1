500|$|The {{bacillus}} causing tuberculosis, M. tuberculosis, {{was identified}} and described on 24 March 1882 by Robert Koch. He received the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine in 1905 for this discovery. Koch {{did not believe}} the <b>bovine</b> (<b>cattle)</b> and human tuberculosis diseases were similar, which delayed the recognition of infected milk as a source of infection. Later, the risk of transmission from this source was dramatically reduced by the invention of the pasteurization process. Koch announced a glycerine extract of the tubercle bacilli as a [...] "remedy" [...] for tuberculosis in 1890, calling it [...] "tuberculin". While it was not effective, it was later successfully adapted as a screening test for the presence of pre-symptomatic tuberculosis. The World Tuberculosis Day was established on 24 March for this reason.|$|E

40|$|Background : Present {{investigation}} {{is based on}} the clinicopatho-biochemical alteration related to natural tick borne bovine babesiosis in Punjab state. Methods : Blood samples from jugular vein of 542 <b>bovines</b> (<b>cattle</b> 466 and buffaloes 76) having history of tick in­festation, fever, hemoglobinurea or anemia were collected and tested for Babesia bigemina by blood smear examina­tion and PCR targeting 18 S rRNA gene to distinguish clinically and subclinically infected groups. Further the hemato-biochemical parameters were correlated with the status of infection. Results: Overall, of the 542 samples tested 16. 42 % were positive by PCR while only 1. 66 % by blood smear exami­nation. The trend of molecular prevalence was found to decrease from north-eastern towards western Punjab. Analy­sis of the hematobiochemical alterations showed significant decrease in the levels of RBC, Hb, PCV, and MCV with significant increase in TBIL, MCH and MCHC levels. Conclusion: As the transmission of B. bigemina is transovarian, presence of even few infected Rhipicephalus (Booph­ilus) microplus ticks on a subclinically infection can be the nidus of infection for whole herd, causing severe economic losses, at the same time significantly affecting the physiology of carrier animal. </p...|$|R

40|$|Communicated by Stephen Gourley) Abstract. A general {{mathematical}} {{model for a}} disease with an exposed (la-tent) period and relapse is proposed. Such a model is appropriate for tuber-culosis, including <b>bovine</b> tuberculosis in <b>cattle</b> and wildlife, and for herpes. For this model with a general probability of remaining in the exposed class, the basic reproduction number R 0 is identified and its threshold property is discussed. In particular, the disease-free equilibrium is proved to be globally asymptotically stable if R 0 1, and the disease is shown to be uniformly persistent with the infective population size either approaching or oscillating about the endemic level. Numerical simulations (for parameters appropriate for <b>bovine</b> tuberculosis in <b>cattle)</b> withR 0 > 1 indicate that solutions tend to this endemic state...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Bovine {{tuberculosis}} (bTB) is {{an important}} public health concern worldwide. This {{study was conducted to}} determine the status of bTB in animals raised by tuberculosis patients in Western Chitwan, Nepal. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted from August, 2011 to January, 2012. A total of 100 <b>bovines</b> (<b>cattle</b> and buffalo) raised in 60 farms of tuberculosis patients were tested with single intradermal tuberculin test considering various animal factors. Well designed questionnaire survey was taken with 70 tuberculosis patients of same 60 families focusing knowledge, awareness and various practices related to bovine tuberculosis. RESULTS: Overall 15 % bovines were positive for tuberculosis (13. 6 % cattle and 15. 4 % buffaloes). Age of animal was significantly associated with tuberculosis (p< 0. 05) while sex and species were not. 24 % tuberculosis patients had raw milk consuming habit while very few of them (9 %) were aware of zoonotic aspect of bovine tuberculosis. CONCLUSIONS: There is high chance of tuberculosis transmission form animals to humans or vice versa. Further detailed study is needed in large scale with stronger intersectoral collaboration of medical and veterinary health sector to determine the scale of problem and find out prevention and control strategies against zoonotic tuberculosis...|$|R

40|$|Fascioliasis is an {{important}} food-borne parasitic zoonosis caused by two trematode species, Fasciola hepatica and Fasciola gigantica. The characterisation and differentiation of Fasciola populations is crucial to control the disease, given the different transmission, epidemiology and pathology characteristics of the two species. Lineal biometric features of adult liver flukes infecting livestock have been studied to characterise and discriminate fasciolids from Bangladesh. An accurate analysis was conducted to phenotypically discriminate between fasciolids from naturally infected <b>bovines</b> (<b>cattle,</b> buffaloes) throughout the country. Morphometric analyses were made with a computer image analysis system (CIAS) applied {{on the basis of}} standardised measurements and the logistic model of the body growth and development of fasciolids in the different host groups. Since it is the first ever comprehensive study of this kind undertaken in Bangladesh, the results are compared to pure fasciolid populations of F. hepatica from the European Mediterranean area and F. gigantica from Burkina Faso, geographical areas where both species do not co-exist. Principal component analysis showed that the biometric characteristics of fasciolids from Bangladesh are situated between F. hepatica and F. gigantica standard populations, indicating the presence of phenotypes of intermediate forms in Bangladesh. These results are analysed by considering the present emergence of animal fascioliasis, the local lymnaeid fauna, the impact of climate change, and the risk of human infection in the country...|$|R

40|$|Control of bovine {{tuberculosis}} (TB) in cattle has proven particularly challenging where reservoirs of infection exist in wildlife populations. In Britain and Ireland, control is hampered by {{a reservoir of}} infection in Eurasian badgers (Meles meles).

Here we show that Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination of captive badgers reduced the progression, severity and excretion of Mycobacterium bovis infection after experimental challenge. In a clinical field study, BCG vaccination of free-living badgers reduced the incidence of positive serological test results by 73. 8 per cent.
