40|$|It is {{now clear}} that the major {{identified}} risk factor for the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) is a positive family history. Furthermore, the available data in spouses and twins indicate that the genetic susceptibility is due in large measure to shared familial predisposition. This emphasizes the importance of identifying the actual familial susceptibilities. Given the data for immunopathogenetic etiologies in the genesis of IBD, the logical candidate genes are those that involve the immune system. Data for several of these gene marker systems have been considered confusing or inconclusive. When approached with the concept that IBD is a genetically heterogeneous group of disorders, patterns are beginning to emerge for the human lymphocyte antigen class II region genes on chromosome 6, and the complement C 3 gene on chromosome 19. Available data do not yet implicate the immunoglobulin or T cell receptor genes, but further studies are needed, especially for the latter. Firm identification of genetic susceptibilities will require the study of an adequate number of families, which is being facilitated by the establishment of an IBD family-based cell line <b>bank.</b> <b>Identification</b> of the genes that predispose to IBD will allow the study of natural history from susceptibility to clinical disease and, when understood, will provide new approaches to disease therapy and even prevention...|$|E
40|$|Effective problem <b>bank</b> <b>identification</b> and {{resolution}} {{is crucial to}} ensure not only the soundness of a bank {{but also for the}} resilience of the financial system as a whole since banks are dominant players in the financial system. Successful problem bank management will reduce the potential of both individual bank failures and banking crisis as well as minimise resolution costs. Hence, a comprehensive, clear framework and guidelines for dealing with problem banks is crucial. This study aims at two main objectives: (i) to analyse the framework and process of problem <b>bank</b> <b>identification,</b> intervention {{and resolution}} in the SEACEN countries; and (ii) to identify key issues and lessons learned for an effective problem bank management. In general, bank supervisors in nine SEACEN surveyed countries have a clear legal and prudential framework in dealing with problem banks. However, the level of progress diverges from country to country depending on their legal and political settings as well as economic development. Crisis hit countries (Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand), and countries experiencing banking system distresses (Philippines and Republic of China, Taiwan) appear to have a more developed framework, particularly on crisis management. Supervisory authorities in the crisis countries have enhanced the effectiveness of their banking supervision along with the post-crisis bank restructuring program. However, non crisis hit countries (Cambodia, Nepal, Papua New Guinea and Sri Lanka) have a less comprehensive framework. Non-crisis countries mostly are yet to have an explicit deposit insurance scheme and develop a crisis management framework. Among key challenges for bank supervisors is to ensure both macro and micro supervisory objectives ¨C to maintain financial stability and ensure depositor protection ¨C are effectively attained. In practice, it often is difficult to identify and measure as well as manage systemic risk which requires different skills and methodologies. Therefore, it is imperative to perform ¨C and enhance the efficacy of ¨C macro-prudential surveillance to identify, monitor and mitigate the risks to the financial system. For countries which are yet to have a crisis management framework it is important to develop comprehensive financial safety nets, consisting of: (i) an explicit and limited deposit insurance scheme; (ii) a well-defined and transparent LLR both in normal times and during systemic crises; and (iii) a clear crisis management framework. Deposit insurance and LLR can be important tools for crisis management, but they are not sufficient to prevent banking crises. They should be used along with measures such as market discipline and prudential banking supervision. A well-devised framework is essential, but effective implementation is much more important. It is necessary to perform a crisis simulation regularly in order to increase readiness in managing crisis Therefore, capacity building is indispensable. ...|$|E

Orientations of pVIII tyrosines (Tyr 21 and Tyr 24) {{with respect to the}} filament axis have been determined by Raman linear intensity difference (RLID) spectroscopy of flow-oriented mutant virions in which the tyrosines were independently mutated to methionine. The results show that the twofold axis of the phenolic ring (C 1 -C 4 line) of Tyr 21 is inclined at 39. 5 +/- 1. 4 degrees from the virion axis, and that of Tyr 24 is inclined at 43. 7 +/- 0. 6 degrees. The orientation determined for the Tyr 21 phenol ring is close to that of a structural model previously proposed on the basis of fiber x-ray diffraction results (Protein Data <b>Bank,</b> <b>identification</b> code 1 IFJ). On the other hand, the orientation determined for the Tyr 24 phenol ring differs from the diffraction-based model by a 40 degrees rotation about the Calpha-Cbeta bond.

40|$|Abstract Background Poly(ADP-ribose) is a NAD + -requiring, DNA-repairing, enzyme {{playing a}} central role in {{pancreatic}} β-cell death and in the development of endothelial dysfunction in humans and experimental animals. PARP activation is also relevant to the development of complications of diabetes. Hence, agents capable of inhibiting PARP may be useful in preventing the development of diabetes and in slowing down complications of diabetes. Methods PARP inhibition was assessed with a colorimetric assay kit. Molecular docking studies on the active site of PARP were conducted using the crystalline structure of the enzyme available as Protein Data <b>Bank</b> <b>Identification</b> No. 1 UK 1. Type 2 diabetes was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats with streptozotocin (STZ, 60 mg/kg, i. p.). The test compounds (3 -aminobenzamide = 3 -AB, nicotinamide = NIC, taurine = TAU) were given by the i. p. route 45 min before STZ at 2. 4 mM/kg (all three compounds) or 1. 2 and 3. 6 mM/kg (only NIC and TAU). Blood samples were collected at 24 hr after STZ and processed for their plasma. The plasma samples were used to measure glucose, insulin, cholesterol, triglycerides, malondialdehyde, nitric oxide, and glutathione levels using reported methods. Results 3 -AB, NIC and TAU were able to inhibit PARP, with the inhibitory potency order being 3 -AB>NIC>>TAU. Molecular docking studies at the active site of PARP showed 3 -AB and NIC to interact with the binding site for the nicotinamide moiety of NAD + and TAU to interact with the binding site for the adenine moiety of NAD +. While STZ-induced diabetes elevated all the experimental parameters examined and lowered the insulin output, a pretreatment with 3 -AB, NIC or TAU reversed these trends to a significant extent. At a dose of 2. 4 mm/kg, the protective effect decreased in the approximate order 3 -AB>NIC≥TAU. The attenuating actions of both NIC and TAU were dose-related except for the plasma lipids since NIC was without a significant effect at all doses tested. Conclusions At equal molar doses, 3 -AB was generally more potent than either TAU or NIC as an antidiabetogenic agent, but the differences were not as dramatic as would have been predicted from their differences in PARP inhibitory potencies. NIC and TAU demonstrated dose-related effects, which in the case of TAU were only evident at doses ≥ 2. 4 mM/kg. The present results also suggest {{that in the case of}} NIC and TAU an increase in dose will enhance the magnitude of their attenuating actions on diabetes-related biochemical alterations to that achieved with a stronger PARP inhibitor such as 3 -AB. Hence, dosing will play a critical role in clinical studies assessing the merits of NIC and TAU as diabetes-preventing agents. </p...|$|E
