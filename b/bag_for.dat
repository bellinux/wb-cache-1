5|$|In {{the late}} nineteenth century, a bounty was levied on J.lagostoma {{in order to reduce}} its numbers. Hunters were paid 6 pence (alternatively paid in rum) for every hundred claws collected. In 1879, the total <b>bag</b> <b>for</b> the island {{comprised}} 66 cats, 4,013 mice, 7,683 rats and 80,414 land crabs; in the eight years to 1887, bounties were collected on more than 330,000 crabs. The current population is much smaller, and the low level of recruitment and lack of juveniles suggests that the species may become endangered.|$|E
5|$|The painted frieze {{above the}} astronomical clock shows five deities from {{classical}} antiquity, each representing both {{a day of}} the week and a planet in their order according to Ptolemaic cosmology. From left to right, they are: Saturn with sickle and club for Saturday, Jupiter with thunderbolts for Thursday, Mars with sword and shield for Tuesday, Venus with Cupid for Friday and Mercury with staff and <b>bag</b> <b>for</b> Wednesday. The painting of the entire clock area was refurbished in 1983. Only the matte areas on the clock face are from the earlier coat of paint.|$|E

5000|$|In many {{healthcare}} facilities, large disposable blue bags (often with drawstrings) {{are commonly}} used to collect soiled linens. Some are printed with the words [...] "Soiled Linens" [...] and [...] "Ropa Sucias" [...] on them. (These bags fall {{in line with the}} color scheme of waste bags in the healthcare industry: red <b>bags</b> <b>for</b> biohazard/infectious waste, yellow <b>bags</b> <b>for</b> either chemo therapy waste or infectious soiled linens, and blue <b>bags</b> <b>for</b> soiled linens).|$|R
5000|$|These <b>bags</b> {{were used}} <b>for</b> various purposes. Often {{they were used}} for {{transporting}} goods while on migration.

There are also specialized bags such as <b>bags</b> <b>for</b> carrying mirrors, <b>bags</b> <b>for</b> carrying the Qur'an, <b>bags</b> <b>for</b> carrying tent stakes and more. Often the bags are known by specific names based on the function they served. Some common bag names are [...] "cuval" [...] (camel bag), [...] "khorjin" [...] (double-sided donkey bags) and [...] "mafrash" [...] (bedding bag) to name just a few.|$|R

While the mount system designation remains the same, the mount itself has been extensively redesigned to accommodate the ammunition magazine and a <b>bag</b> <b>for</b> catching expended ammunition casings and ammunition links, as well as an improved roller on the pintle to prevent excessive and premature wear to the mount assembly.|$|E
25|$|Borisov and Deylan Peevski are {{connected}} to the Bulgarian company Vitosha, which engaged in a common practice in Bulgaria of “judicial tricks and scams.” The Vitosha-Ultrastroy case involved the abuse of the court system’s bankruptcy proceedings to take money from, abandon, and leave in ruins an Israeli foreign investment project. The Israeli investors were ultimately tied up in years of court proceedings and left holding the <b>bag</b> <b>for</b> their investment.|$|E

25|$|Alcoholics {{are often}} {{deficient}} in various nutrients, {{which can cause}} severe complications during alcohol withdrawal, such as the development of Wernicke syndrome. To help to prevent Wernicke syndrome, alcoholics should be administered a multivitamin preparation with sufficient quantities of thiamine and folic acid. During alcohol withdrawal, the prophylactic administration of thiamine, folic acid, and pyridoxine intravenously is recommended before starting any carbohydrate-containing fluids or food. These vitamins are often combined into a banana <b>bag</b> <b>for</b> intravenous administration.|$|E
25|$|It {{was later}} {{reported}} that the crime {{had taken place in}} a nearby Weehawken, New Jersey motel named the Park Avenue Hotel. A New Jersey judge had later signed an arrest warrant on Thursday, July 27, 2006. Videotape recovered from the hotel showed Coleman leading Moore through the premises. Police surmise that Coleman beat, raped, and strangled Moore before stuffing her body into a duffel <b>bag</b> <b>for</b> disposal. It appeared that Coleman tried to remove his DNA evidence from her body by cutting Moore's fingernails and cleaning her body with alcohol.|$|E
25|$|The 2014–15 {{season was}} {{something}} of a mixed <b>bag</b> <b>for</b> NBC, but still successful. NBC launched eight new series that year, with only one, comedy-drama police procedural The Mysteries of Laura, being renewed for a second season. Nevertheless, the network continued to experience success with most of its returning series, especially The Blacklist (despite a modest decline in viewership following its move to Thursdays midway through the season, due partly to an initial weak lead-in from miniseries The Slap). Combined with the record number of viewers tuning in to Super Bowl XLIX, NBC again finished #1 in the 18-49 demographic and in second place overall.|$|E

25|$|The 2006–07 {{season was}} a mixed <b>bag</b> <b>for</b> the network, with Deal or No Deal {{remaining}} strong and Heroes becoming a surprise hit on Monday nights, while the highly touted Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip (from West Wing creator Aaron Sorkin) lost {{a third of}} its premiere-night viewers by Week 6 and was eventually cancelled; two critically acclaimed sitcoms, The Office and 30 Rock, also pulled in modest successes and {{went on to win the}} Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series for four consecutive years. The network also regained the rights to the NFL after eight years that season when it acquired the Sunday Night Football package from ESPN (as part of a deal that also saw Monday Night Football move to ESPN from ABC). However, despite this, NBC remained at a very distant fourth place, barely ranking ahead of The CW.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{his more}} notable oddities {{included}} a diet to supplement his extreme fitness regime, which consisted largely of tea, biscuits, and baked beans. Like his mentor, Alan Knott, a heavy tea drinker, Russell would often get through 20 cups a day. He used to dip the tea bag in once, add plenty of milk, then hang it on a nail ready for subsequent use. In the final Test of the 1989 Ashes series (against Australia) at the Oval, Derek Randall counted that he used the same <b>bag</b> <b>for</b> all five days, which roughly equates to 100 cups. For lunch, Russell would eat two Weetabix, soaked for exactly eight minutes in milk, and a mashed banana. For dinner, steak and chips or chicken without skin was a favourite meal – Russell once spent every night of a Test at a Chinese restaurant in Perth, ordering cashew chicken: without the cashews.|$|E
25|$|Arcade mode is {{the main}} {{multiplayer}} section of TimeSplitters 2. It can normally be played with up to four players with each player using {{a division of the}} television's screen. However, with a System Link, up to sixteen players can participate. System link was not included with the GameCube version. When a player is killed, he or she is respawned at a random location on the map with full health. Weapons, armour, and other items that enhance players' abilities are placed in several preset positions scattered about the map. The objective of the game depends on the mode selected. Four are available at the start: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Bag (a version of Capture the Flag) and BagTag (where a player must survive while in possession of the <b>bag</b> <b>for</b> the longest period of time). There are sixteen game modes in total, but twelve are unavailable until the player beats certain levels of the game.|$|E

25|$|After Madson retired {{all three}} Cubs he faced {{in the top}} of the eighth, the Nationals staged their final rally in the bottom of the inning. Joe Maddon had called in Cubs closer Wade Davis to get the last out of the seventh inning and kept him in to pitch the eighth and ninth in the hope that he would get a seven-out save, an unusually long outing for him. Davis started the eighth by walking Daniel Murphy and Anthony Rendon, but then got pinch-hitter Adam Lind to ground into a double play that {{advanced}} Murphy to third. Michael A. Taylor then singled to drive in Murphy and cut Chicago's lead to 9-8, and light-hitting catcher José Lobatón who had replaced Wieters in the game, singled, advancing Taylor to second. With Davis clearly tiring and the top of the Nationals′ order coming to bat, Washington′s hopes rose that they could at least tie the game. Trea Turner came to the plate and had worked his at-bat to a 2-1 count when catcher Willson Contreras threw to first to pick off Lobatón. Lobatón was called safe, but the Cubs challenged the call and the video replay revealed that Lobatón′s foot had lost contact with the <b>bag</b> <b>for</b> less than a second while Anthony Rizzo was applying the tag. Lobatón was ruled out, and the inning ended.|$|E
500|$|The High Court {{said that}} the trial judge {{did not seem to}} be aware that he had the {{authority}} to adjourn the trial.
