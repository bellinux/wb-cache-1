5000|$|Since its {{foundation}} in 1965 in Le Havre, France, Sidel {{has been developing}} packaging technologies for the beverage industry. In 1961 the company developed the first plastic bottle made of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) as a container for edible oil and, later on, wine, milk and water. In 1973 Sidel released the first plastic HDPE (high-density polyethylene) bottle for milk, sterilised by ultra-heat treatment (UHT). In 1980 Sidel delivered its first PET <b>blow</b> <b>moulding</b> machine to the family-owned soft-drink company Barraclough in Great Britain. Sidel’s first international subsidiary opened in 1984 in Atlanta, USA. In the same year, Sidel also sold the first high-speed PET <b>blow</b> <b>moulding</b> machine. In the 1990s Sidel acquired the French companies Hema (1995), Cermex (1996) [...] and Gebo (1997). In 1997 Sidel introduced a system which combines <b>blow</b> <b>moulding,</b> filling and capping. In same year, the first Sidel dry preforms decontamination by H2O2 spray was launched with the Combi Disis. The development of an internal carbon-based coating in 1999 strengthened the barrier properties of PET packages to gases (O2 and CO2) and made PET-bottles usable for beer. In 2003 Sidel joined Tetra Laval and merged with the Italian company Simonazzi in 2005. Simonazzi was founded in 1850 and had its headquarters in Parma, Italy. In 2006, Sidel launched Predis™, its dry decontamination solution technology for preforms. In April 2013, Sidel announced the launch of a new company {{as part of the}} Sidel Group, Gebo Cermex. [...] Gebo Cermex focuses on engineering, line integration and end-of-line packaging. A partnership with Kortec was communicated in October 2013. The target of the co-operation is to develop new light-blocking PET milk bottles. In March 2014, the divestment of Swedish subsidiary, Tectubes, was announced.|$|E

40|$|Injection {{moulding}} and <b>blow</b> <b>moulding</b> {{are probably}} the most widely used process for manufacturing parts by using plastic materials. A wide variety of products are manufactured by using these two technologies, which vary greatly in their size, complexity, and application. The injection moulding process requires the use of an injection moulding machine, raw plastic material and a mould. The process cycle for injection moulding consists of the following four stages: clamping, injection, cooling and ejection. <b>Blow</b> <b>moulding</b> is a manufacturing process that is used to create hollow plastic parts by inflating a heated plastic tube until it fills a mould and forms the desired shape. The manufacturing process is divided into three stages: injection, blowing and ejection. There are many types of materials that may be used in the injection moulding and <b>blow</b> <b>moulding</b> process. Most polymers may be used, including all thermoplastics, some thermosets, and some elastomers. Injection moulding industry is used to create many things such as milk cartons, packaging, bottle caps, automotive dashboards, pocket combs, and most other plastic products available today. Parts made from <b>blow</b> <b>moulding</b> are plastic, hollow, and thin-walled, such as bottles and containers that are available in a variety of shapes and sizes.

Design/methodology/approach: The value for the Barus number for different dimensions of the nozzle gap and the distribution of the temperature field during <b>blow</b> <b>moulding</b> process have been determined; the product thickness profile has been defined; phenomena which occur during blowing stage have been registered. The investigations have been performed by means of the <b>blow</b> <b>moulding</b> machine of UFP- 05 type by IPTS – Metalchem Toruń using the designed and prepared blow mould with the sight-glass made of polycarbonate. Findings: The performed investigations enabled the insight study of uncontrolled phenomena which occur during each individual stage of the process and they showed the dependencies between these phenomena and the process parameters. Moreover, the detailed analyses enabled to determine the influence of these parameters on the physical features and dimensions of the finished goods. Research limitations/implications: The continuation of the investigations with use of extended blow mould design equipped in polycarbonate sight-glass which enabled the determination of the influence of the structure and mould cavity dimensions on the finished product wall thickness seems to be justified.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Blow</b> <b>moulding</b> is {{the forming}} of a hollow part by `blowing ’ a mould cavity shaped parison {{made by a}} {{thermoplastic}} molten tube. Blow-moulded parts often require strict control of the thickness distribution {{in order to achieve}} the required mechanical performance and ®nal weight. A fuzzy optimization algorithm for determining the optimal die gap openings and die geometry for the required thickness distribution in the <b>blow</b> <b>moulding</b> process is presented. The idea of the fuzzy optimization algorithm is that, instead of using purely numerical information to obtain the new design point in the next iteration, engineering knowledge and the human supervision process can be modelled in the optimization algorithm using fuzzy rules. The structure of an optimization algorithm is still maintained to guide the engineering decision process and to ensure that an optimal solution rather than a trial and error solution can be obtained. It is shown how a single fuzzy engine can be used in various cases and types of optimization of the <b>blow</b> <b>moulding</b> process...|$|E
