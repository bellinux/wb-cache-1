The requirements for multicellularity were embedded in the genes of some of these cells, specifically choanoflagellates. These are thought to be the precursors for all multicellular organisms. They are highly related to sponges (Porifera), which are the simplest multicellular organisms.|$|E

25|$|There is {{evidence}} that the FCC continues to be influenced by the corporate media lobby. The strong, direct relationships that have developed over the years between regulators and corporate media lobbyists, is essential to greater influence. It goes much deeper than the idea that the lobby has simply <b>been</b> <b>around</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> while. Members of the FCC have traditionally had strong connections to industry. As the job of an FCC commissioner or staffer is often highly technical, and specific knowledge of the dynamics of the telecommunications and media industries must be known, commissioners are often plucked out of high-paying jobs in the industry. History has shown, {{due to the fact that}} FCC Commissioners are appointed only to five-year terms, that there is a revolving door between the Commission and industry.|$|E
25|$|The {{celestial}} sphere has been divided into 88 constellations. The International Astronomical Union (IAU) constellations are {{areas of the}} sky. Each of these contains remarkable X-ray sources. Some of them are have been identified from astrophysical modeling to be galaxies or black holes at the centers of galaxies. Some are pulsars. As with sources already successfully modeled by X-ray astrophysics, striving to understand the generation of X-rays by the apparent source helps to understand the Sun, the universe as a whole, and how these affect us on Earth. Constellations are an astronomical device for handling observation and precision independent of current physical theory or interpretation. Astronomy has <b>been</b> <b>around</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long time. Physical theory changes with time. With respect to celestial X-ray sources, X-ray astrophysics tends {{to focus on the}} physical reason for X-ray brightness, whereas X-ray astronomy tends to focus on their classification, order of discovery, variability, resolvability, and their relationship with nearby sources in other constellations.|$|E
25|$|During this era, entire {{automobiles}} (including {{thousands of}} Model Ts) were even hacked apart by their owners and reconfigured into custom machinery permanently {{dedicated to a}} purpose, such as homemade tractors and ice saws. Dozens of aftermarket companies sold prefab kits to facilitate the T's conversion from car to tractor. The Model T had <b>been</b> <b>around</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> decade before the Fordson tractor became available (1917–18), and many Ts had been converted for field use. (For example, Harry Ferguson, later famous for his hitches and tractors, worked on Eros Model T tractor conversions before he worked with Fordsons and others.) During the next decade, Model T tractor conversion kits were harder to sell, as the Fordson and then the Farmall (1924), {{as well as other}} light and affordable tractors, served the farm market. But during the Depression (1930s), Model T tractor conversion kits had a resurgence, because by then used Model Ts and junkyard parts for them were plentiful and cheap.|$|E

500|$|The idea of Lisa dating Nelson had <b>been</b> <b>around</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> while, {{with several}} {{different}} versions being pitched. The writers wanted a [...] "silly" [...] Homer story {{to balance the}} episode out, {{and the idea of}} using the telemarketing scam for this had also <b>been</b> <b>around</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> while. By this time, the show had begun to have episodes revolving around secondary characters. This was the first episode to revolve around Nelson, and was done to partly explain why Nelson acts the way he does. The words to Nelson's song were contributed by Mike Scully's daughters. The scene in which Milhouse passes Lisa's note to Nelson was written by Bill Oakley, with the line, [...] "He can't hear you, we had to pack his ears with gauze", being George Meyer's line. There was a debate as to how injured Milhouse should look without it looking disturbing, and the drop of blood coming from his nose was decided to be enough. Milhouse liking Vaseline on toast was based on a child from Josh Weinstein's school days who everyday would get onto the bus with a piece of toast, which had Vaseline on it.|$|E

Ellefson said [...] "13" [...] is a song that [...] "summed up the arc of Megadeth as a band".

500|$|The revolutionary {{faces at}} least two special problems. First, the {{transformation}} back into naked power occurs when revolutionary power has <b>been</b> <b>around</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long period without achieving a resolution to its key conflict. At some point, the original goal of the creed tends to be forgotten, and consequently, the fanatics of the movement change their goals and aspire toward mere domination (Russell 1938:92). Second, the revolutionary must always deal {{with the threat of}} counter-revolutionaries, and is hence faced with a dilemma: because revolutionary power must by definition think that the original revolution was justified, it [...] "cannot, logically, contend that all subsequent revolutions must be wicked" [...] (Russell 1938:87).|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{concept for}} the episode {{came from a}} few lines of show ideas written by George Meyer. One of them read [...] "Bart the homo", and Ron Hauge was selected to write the episode, with the story stemming from that line. The idea of using filmmaker John Waters as a guest star had <b>been</b> <b>around</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> while. Many of the staff were fans of his work, and showrunners Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein had planned to use him in an episode called [...] "Lisa and Camp", which revolved around Lisa [...] "discovering the joys of campy things". Their idea was combined with Meyer's and it became this episode. The episode was originally titled [...] "Bart Goes to Camp", but was renamed because the joke was too oblique. Mike B. Anderson directed the episode, telling The Gold Coast Bulletin: [...] "When I read the script I was enthralled, {{not only because of}} the visual possibilities, but also because the story felt very solid. It was engaging and surprising and I really put heart into that episode." ...|$|E
500|$|Concerned {{about his}} dog, Stan goes {{to look for}} him, missing {{the start of the}} {{football}} game. When Stan finds Sparky at the Big Gay Animal Sanctuary, Big Gay Al takes Stan on a boat ride through his sanctuary and gives a speech about how homosexuality has <b>been</b> <b>around</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long time, which eventually makes Stan accept his dog's homosexuality. Meanwhile, Richard Stamos fails to hit the high note of the song at half time. Returning to the final moments of the game, Stan steps in as the quarterback, passing the ball to Kyle for a touchdown that beats the betting spread as time runs out. In his speech after the game, Stan tells the people of South Park about the Big Gay Animal Sanctuary and that [...] "it's okay to be gay". He leads the people {{to the site of the}} Sanctuary, but it has mysteriously disappeared; people's runaway gay pets, however, return. Before leaving, Big Gay Al thanks Stan for making everyone understand homosexuality. Although the Cows beat the spread, Richard Stamos appears to prove he can hit the high note that he missed earlier, triggering the bomb and killing the Middle Park team's mascot.|$|E
