30|$|Asset {{management}} takes a life-cycle {{approach of}} assets as its starting point (Falls et al. 2001). Baskarada et al. (2006) define assets as ‘everything which has economic value and {{is owned by}} an organization.’ The <b>British</b> <b>Standard</b> <b>Specification</b> PAS 55 defines asset management as ‘the systematic and coordinated activities to manage assets and their performance, risks and costs during their life cycle optimally, considering the strategic goals of the organisation’ (BS EN ISO 9001 : 2008 2008). Due to the rapid development {{of the field of}} infrastructure (asset) management since the 1990 ’s, no clear definition of infrastructure asset management exits (Schraven et al., 2013). They state that the numerous definitions of asset management share common ground with regard to two aspects: (1) assets are used to achieve organizational goals and (2) managing assets means considering the complete asset life cycle. Herder and Wijnia (2012) refer to the strategic use of asset management as ‘an integral approach in which asset management is used to contribute to organisational goals’. Asset management thus is about a life-cycle approach, and is linked to strategic organizational goals.|$|E

This work is intended to represent and investigate the deterioration of concrete {{structures in}} Port Sudan, review and study the methods of repair used in Port Sudan and evaluate their effectiveness as well as suggest the proper procedure to avoid deterioration in new constructions at the design, and construction stages, and suggest the proper repair methods. The study reviewed durability of concrete and the causes of deterioration in concrete structures {{and how they can}} be prevented as well as diagnosis of causes and methods of repair. The study defined the problem by constructing a questionnaire which showed that (41. 76 %) of samples were deteriorated structures, and Althaora, Hadal and Hialkhaleeg are the most affected regions. Corrosion of steel reinforcement is a major cause of concrete deterioration where (75. 5 %) of deteriorated samples showed cover spalling, and (66. 67 %) presented longitudinal cracks parallel to reinforcement steel. Slabs were the most affected members (76 %), while columns were (38 %) and walls (64 %). (68. 89) of the rehabilitation was improper and this lead to annual repair where (55. 6 %) of rehabilitation was repeated 4 to 6 times in the last 10 years. Three building have been taken from the most affected regions; and the corrosion damage was investigated and diagnosed by visual 5 assessment, field test and laboratory test. Source of constituent material (fine aggregate and water), and soil form foundation were tested also, so as to support the field test.

40|$|Because of the {{increase}} of safety requirements with respect to storage of LPG over the last ten years, underground storage is becoming increasingly significant. Storage is possible in engineering geological and in civil engineering constructions. The main features of these two solutions are presented. LPG can be stored either pressurized or refrigerated. This report concerns the pressurized storage in a civil construction. In mounded storage a horizontal cylindrical steel vessel is covered with sand. The normal mounded storage has some disadvantages which can be solved by partly submerging the vessel in the groundwater. This mode of storage is called mounded storage with a floating foundation. It is expected that using this method the differential settlements of the vessel will be smaller. Also {{the height of the}} mound will be smaller. A layer of sand on top of the vessel will prevent it from floating up. For some various sizes and shapes of the vessel the required thickness of this layer is calculated. In this report {{on the basis of a}} few criteria for the depth of the excavation and the length of the vessel the best alternative is chosen. For the chosen vessel the wall thicknesses are calculated and checked following the <b>British</b> <b>Standard</b> <b>Specification</b> for fusion-welded pressure vessels (BS 5500). A partly submerged vessel needs a coating and a cathodic protection system to prevent it from corroding. Exact the same coating and cathodic protection used for the normal mounded storage, can be used for the mounded storage with a floating foundation. The vessels will be shop-built in a tent close to their foundation. The foundation will be built in a dry excavation. With cranes the vessels will be put on their foundation. When the vessel is partly submerged the potential longitudinal bending moment in the vessel will be less. The differential settlement will be smaller but this does not effect the wall thicknesses since the dry situation is mandatory for the calculation of these sizes. The mounded storage with a floating foundation will be less expensive than storage in spheres, but more expensive than the normal mounded storage. However, other reasons than cost could perhaps make the mounded storage with a floating foundation a preferable storage method. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
40|$|Oil and gas fields {{located in}} {{offshore}} are today being developed in even harsher and more challenging environments {{than anyone had}} thought of before. New designs, technologies, regulations and requirements have been developed and implemented along with these changes. As {{a result of these}} harsh conditions, the offshore structures will experience a lot of challenges in terms of design and maintenance integrity. One of the most important concerns is the wave loadings which are critical on offshore structures in these environments due to their cyclic behaviour over time. The structures considered in this thesis are pipe lines, which are influenced by wave loadings. The wave loadings considered in this thesis are high cyclic loadings, which will accumulate damages on structures and then lead to fatigue failures. These failures are a result of a combination of the stress amplitudes and the number of cycles. ASME B 31. 3 is the piping code that is utilized in design of most offshore process piping systems. But due to its lack of information about high cyclic fatigue failures, other codes need to be considered on this matter. There are different specifications which address fatigue failures, and the code used in this thesis is PD 5500 <b>British</b> <b>standard</b> <b>specification.</b> This is used as a reference approach to estimate fatigue life. As an experiment there are two different other approaches discussed. One is covering the fatigue by calculating equivalent stress range and the other is covering the fatigue by assuming that a probability density function of stress range may be represented by a two parameter Weibull distribution. Examples from the Eldfisk and the Snorre fields have used for explanations of above given approaches. One has been the bridge piping on the Eldfisk field and the other one has been the flow line on the Snorre A field. The approach given in the PD 5500 specification and the equivalent stress range approach gives the same results for the fatigue life estimation, but the third approach which assumed a two parameter Weibull distribution of stress range, gives a different result than the other two. The equivalent stress range approach can be proven analytically, but hasn’t proven earlier to be used with the two slopes SN curves. The thesis is discussed about the feasibility of using the equivalent stress range approach as another way of high cyclic fatigue assessment. This approach can be suitable to use in the industrial fatigue analyses but not the third approach. Fatigue damages on offshore topside piping systems in the North Sea have been evaluated by using the above examples and it has identified that more than 80 % of the fatigue damages happened at the wave heights between 2 m to 8 m...|$|E
