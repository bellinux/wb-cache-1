Leng writes of this song-wide message: [...] "It presents his realization {{that he has to}} walk away and carry on with his own life. George Harrison is not his Beatle brothers' keeper." ...|$|E

500|$|Using the gauze projection-screen, Phillips, Reznor, and Sheridan {{devised a}} [...] "gag" [...] where they {{projected}} [...] "a sheet of glass shattering onto a downstage kabuki scrim that would drop as the glass shatters fell. ...

[...] This technique {{can be seen in the}} tour documentary <b>Beside</b> <b>You</b> in Time. [...] In contrast to the lighting of previous tours, Performance 2007 featured minimal lighting that was designed to shadow Reznor and the band.|$|E

500|$|As {{a result}} of Revolution Muslim's statement, Seattle {{cartoonist}} Molly Norris suggested that many people draw and publish pictures of Muhammad on May 20, 2010, which she dubbed the [...] "first annual Everybody Draw Mohammed Day". However, very few cartoonists actually joined her in criticizing Islam or depicting the prophet Muhammed; instead, much like Maher and Stewart, they merely praised her for her efforts and condemned the idea of censorship. Norris herself went into hiding, shortly thereafter, {{on the advice of}} the FBI. Animated comedy series Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane voiced this ambivalence {{on the part of the}} creative community, saying [...] "No one is a bigger critic of organized religion than I am", but nevertheless added, [...] "It's tricky. You pick your battles. You have to judge how real the threat is against how funny the joke is. How much do I care about the joke?" [...] And The Simpsons also addressed the apparent hypocrisy of those who claimed to stand with South Park in a chalkboard gag during the opening sequence of the April 25, 2010 episode [...] "The Squirt and the Whale", with Bart Simpson writing [...] "South Parkâ€”We'd Stand <b>Beside</b> <b>You</b> If We Weren't So Scared".|$|E
500|$|Anna in {{particular}} and the whole film in general had undergone a number {{of changes in the}} story, most notably making the heroine the younger sister of the Snow Queen. Describing the character's development process, director Jennifer Lee admitted, [...] "Even with Anna there was a tug of war for a long time. There are elements of it that we didn't land on with Anna until late into production, so we changed some of the animation to support it." [...] Bell generally described her character as [...] "She doesn't have good postures, she's not very elegant, but she's a good person and she's utterly determined." [...] Lee added, [...] "She doesn't have any superpowers, but Anna is one of these ordinary people doing an extraordinary thing." [...] Contrary to her sister Elsa who represents fear, Anna represents love, she is filled with optimism with an extraordinary heart. Director Chris Buck later stated, [...] " [...] secret weapon is love," [...] while head of story Paul Briggs commented that she is [...] "a character who is willing to stand <b>beside</b> <b>you</b> and stand up for what's right. Her sister was born with a condition that's shaped a world where Anna doesn't belong." [...] In the images of Frozens main characters released by Disney in July 2013, Anna and her role in the film was described as follows: ...|$|E

500|$|Falle took a {{sustained}} interest in Bedford v. Canada, {{a case that}} began in the fall of 2010 when laws against keeping a brothel, communicating in order to facilitate prostitution, and living off the avails of prostitution were struck down by the Ontario Superior Court of Justice as unconstitutional. When Falle first heard about this decision, she cried, and expressed surprise and disappointment. She said that she did not believe that the average Canadian realized the implications of striking down these laws, which she said were that [...] "your next door neighbours can run a brothel right <b>beside</b> <b>you.</b> Your children could be exposed to condoms left on their driveway, johns propositioning them." [...] She also expressed her concern that striking down anti-prostitution laws normalizes prostitution as a career option for children to consider. She also said that, without the laws, [...] "pimps will be legitimate businesspeople [...] billboards advertising brothels could start appearing on roadsides." [...] Ron Marzel, a lawyer attempting to have the anti-prostitution laws declared unconstitutional, said, [...] "the reality is there are consenting adults who want to go into" [...] prostitution. Falle was angered by this statement, and replied that 97% of women in the sex industry are not engaging in prostitution by choice, and that [...] "the voices of the overwhelming majority of women who {{want to get out of}} prostitution are being drowned out by a vocal few." ...|$|E
