His wife and daughters subdivided the farm property, which they continued to live on, and leased the mill to an Isaac Merritt and Charles Frost in 1845, {{on the condition that}} the two built a cotton mill and housing at their own expense within a decade. By 1850, they had done so, since it is depicted on a contemporary county map. According to the 1850 census's industrial schedule, the mill employed 35 and produced 30000 lb of cotton yarn per year.

The Sharon Steel Hoop Company also acquired the Mary Furnace from the Ohio Iron and Steel Company to secure a source of pig iron supply for the Lowellville Plant, and added to the Mary Plant two new open hearth furnaces, a 34” reversing <b>blooming</b> <b>mill,</b> and a 21&$#148; bar mill, These improvements {{made it possible to}} abandon the now obsolete steel making facilities and <b>blooming</b> <b>mill</b> at the Sharon Works in 1920.|$|E

50|$|In 1896, the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited had {{acquired}} {{land on the}} river shore at Mayfield East for smelters, and in 1910 {{it was decided that}} they would construct here a major steel works and foundries, with a 350-ton blast furnace and three 65-ton open hearth steel furnaces, a <b>bloom</b> <b>mill</b> and heavy rail mill, with by-product coke ovens to supply coke for the blast furnaces. The advantages of the site played a major part in this decision: for transport both rail and shipping already existed, and they had close proximity to the Newcastle and South Maitland coalfields, (the coal consumption in 1947 was 30,000 tons each week). The task of reclaiming swampland at Port Waratah for the main site began in January 1913, and the New South Wales Government undertook to dredge and maintain a river channel between the works and the sea, 500 ft wide and 25 ft deep at low water to the steelwork's basin and wharves. Altogether the company acquired 1225 acre. The blast furnace commenced operations in March 1915.|$|R

Although originally MMK was built for civilian needs its move to military use did not take long despite the fact that MMK did not produce special steels used in the defense industry. After the attack on the USSR, on June 22, 1941, the factory obtained its first order for production of metal armour. Instructions were given to proceed to the production of blanks for live shells, and to explore the possibilities of creating specialist products for armoured tanks, which required rebuilding the production facility. The government provided a number of specialists for the development of armoured steel. The factory created an Armour Bureau, which was responsible for the development of technology for the production of armoured steel products. By July 23, 1941, the third hearth furnace of MMK produced its first steel output for the military. Simultaneously with the development of armoured steel smelting technology at the plant, other military orders were produced. In order to provide more armour for the front they decided to on a quick solution - and began the production of rolled sheets in the <b>blooming</b> <b>mill.</b> Testing was successful, and the factories constructing the tanks received armour at least two weeks ahead of the deadline set by the government. Armour sheet production at MMK in the end of 1941 exceeded its pre-war production. Simultaneously, specialized areas and workshops for the production of ammunition was improved. Hand grenades, components for missiles, and other defense products were manufactured. Magnitogorsk was converted into the major military arsenal of the country. The construction and commissioning of new production units continued. Attention was concentrated on blast furnaces № 5 and № 6, and this blast furnace steel became the biggest in USSR.|$|E

40|$|During {{this thesis}} work a coupled thermo-mechanical {{finite element model}} (FEM) was builtto {{simulate}} hot rolling in the <b>blooming</b> <b>mill</b> at Sandvik Materials Technology (SMT) inSandviken. The <b>blooming</b> <b>mill</b> {{is the first in}} a long line of processes that continuously or ingotcast ingots are subjected to before becoming finished products. The aim of this thesis work was twofold. The first was to create a parameterized finiteelement (FE) model of the <b>blooming</b> <b>mill.</b> The commercial FE software package MSCMarc/Mentat was used to create this model and the programing language Python was used toparameterize it. Second, two different pass schedules (A and B) were studied and comparedusing the model. The two pass series were evaluated with focus on their ability to healcentreline porosity, i. e. to close voids in the centre of the ingot. This evaluation was made by studying the hydrostatic stress (σm), the von Mises stress (σeq) and the plastic strain (εp) in the centre of the ingot. From these parameters the stress triaxiality(Tx) and the hydrostatic integration parameter (Gm) were calculated for each pass in bothseries using two different transportation times (30 and 150 s) from the furnace. The relationbetween Gm and an analytical parameter (Δ) was also studied. This parameter is the ratiobetween the mean height of the ingot and the contact length between the rolls and the ingot,which is useful as a rule of thumb to determine the homogeneity or penetration of strain for aspecific pass. The pass series designed with fewer passes (B), many with greater reduction, was shown toachieve better void closure theoretically. It was also shown that a temperature gradient, whichis the result of a longer holding time between the furnace and the <b>blooming</b> <b>mill</b> leads toimproved void closure...|$|E
40|$|Tyt. z nagłówka. Bibliogr. s. 16 - 17. In the paper, we {{consider}} {{a problem of}} scheduling a set of tasks on a single processor. Each task must be preprocessed {{before it can be}} started on a processor. The efficiency of preprocessing is variable, i. e., the rate of the task preprocessing depends on the amount of continuously divisible resource allotted to this task. This dependency is given by concave, continuous, non-negative and strictly increasing function of the resource amount. The total consumption of resource at each moment is upper bounded. The objective is to minimize the maximum task completion time. The considered problem is NP-hard. Such a problem appears, e. g., in steel mill systems, where ingots (before hot rolling on the <b>blooming</b> <b>mill)</b> have to achieve the required temperature in the preheating process in soaking pits. Some new properties of the problem are proved. These properties are used to construct the procedure for evaluation of the neighbourhood. The procedure is proposed to improve the efficiency of algorithms based on the neighbourhood concept, such as metaheuristics. The computational experiment is conducted to examine the efficiency of the proposed procedure. The described approach can be easily used in the other discrete-continuous scheduling problems.
