40|$|The {{current study}} {{explored}} {{the role of}} advertising in building an effective cessation service brand in Minnesota, United States. Using data from a ClearWay MinnesotaSM campaign evaluation (N = 1, 361), this study examined how mass media advertising works to reinforce recognition of the QUITPLAN Services brand, <b>brand</b> <b>favorability,</b> and brand attributes. Respondents with confirmed awareness of television campaign ads {{were significantly more likely}} to report ever hearing of the brand than those who were not aware of the ads (odds ratio [OR] = 4. 28, p 3 ̆c. 001). In addition, confirmed ad awareness correlated with <b>brand</b> <b>favorability</b> (β =. 37, p 3 ̆c. 001) and attributes (personalized: β =. 50, p 3 ̆c. 001; respectful: β =. 43, p 3 ̆c. 001; proven: β =. 42, p 3 ̆c. 001; accessible: β =. 46, p 3 ̆c. 001), and there was a significant relationship between <b>brand</b> <b>favorability</b> and intention to quit among smokers (OR = 2. 44, p =. 001). The findings in this study contribute to the literature on social marketing and health branding by demonstrating effective strategies for establishing a cessation service brand. Practical implications, research limitations, and future directions are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Sponsorships play an {{increasingly}} {{important role in the}} viability of events, including those targeted at tourists, and sponsors typically seek to build a rapport between their brands and the event attendees. The extent to which the event-related imagery benefits the sponsor brand will depend on the alignment between the sponsor brand and the event. In addressing this issue this study examines the mediating role of event-sponsor fit between visitor event-liking, self-sponsor congruity, and sponsor <b>brand</b> <b>favorability.</b> Interviews were conducted with 1215 attendees at the 2010 Taipei International Flora Exhibition and formed a basis for hypothesis testing. An examination of three sponsor brands over nine surveys concluded that event-sponsor fit consistently mediates the effect of event-liking and self-sponsor congruity on <b>brand</b> <b>favorability.</b> Results confirmed that event organizers and sponsors can benefit from the use of perceived fit as a means of shaping brand attitudes when they sponsor art- and/or social-related events.

40|$|In this paper, {{we explain}} the repeat {{exposure}} effect of Internet advertising. By using a field data set of 34 advertising campaigns, we analyze functional {{forms of the}} repeat exposure effect of Internet advertising. Among four ad effectiveness measures including aided brand awareness, message recall, <b>brand</b> opinion (<b>favorability),</b> and purchase intent, only message recall shows substantial differences between control and exposures groups. Two patterns of repeating exposure effect on message recall are found: the one in monotonically increasing with a decreasing rate {{and the other in}} a quadratic form of inverted 'U'-shape with 'wearout' effect.

40|$|Social TV {{is the use}} of {{communication}} devices to connect with family and friends watching other TV screens. Plausible arguments suggest both positive and negative effects of social TV viewing on ad-effectiveness. This study contributes by providing evidence for the direction of social TV&# 039;s effects. The results of a controlled laboratory experiment suggest that the benefits of social TV, principally its association with live TV and therefore less ad-avoidance, come at the cost of negative distraction effects. Like normal coviewing, social TV viewing distracts from ad-processing, reducing unaided recall and <b>brand</b> attitude <b>favorability,</b> compared to individual (solus) viewing. However, social TV messaging about ads improved brand attitude. Perceived creativity increased the likelihood of ad-related messaging. Social TV also has an additional source of distraction, multitasking, but in this study, multitasking did not further reduce ad-effectiveness compared to coviewing. The paper concludes with implications for advertisers and future research...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} decision brand managers {{have to make}} when positioning their products in a retail setting is to whether price new line extensions at parity or let products vary in the price/quality spectrum. Despite the growing interest in vertical line extension issues, {{there has been little}} research investigating how product-line length affects extension favorability. Therefore, this paper investigates the framing effect that a product line price structure has on consumer judgments of vertical extensions and, in particular, of upscale extensions. A basic proposition of this research is that the parent brand price range affects the perceived or psychological distance between extension and parent <b>brand,</b> influencing extension <b>favorability</b> ratings. In two experiments, it is shown that positioning an upscale extension {{in the context of a}} wide product-line will lead to higher consistency perceptions between the parent brand and a new upscale extension than an equivalent upscale extension positioned in the context of a narrow parent brand product-line...|$|R
40|$|Investigates the {{influence}} of mood and <b>brand</b> <b>favorability</b> on the evaluation of brand extensions. It is argued that affective states {{have an impact on}} the likelihood that the evaluation of a new product is based on the implications of the brand rather than on the implications of the features of the new product. Specifically, participants reported more positive evaluations of a new product when it was introduced by a positive rather than a negative brand – and this differential impact of category information was more pronounced for participants in a positive compared to a neutral or a negative mood...|$|E
40|$|Facing an {{increasingly}} competitive marketplace, many firms have turned toward formal alliances with other entities {{in order to}} achieve strategic advantages. With this alliance growth comes a need for a greater understanding of the impact that such public affiliations can have on consumer attitudes. While marketing research has noted how public brand activity can influence perceptions about a brand (see Aaker 1991, 1996; Keller 1993, 1998), it remains unclear whether brand alliances can act as significant brand associations and subsequently alter brand beliefs. ^ The goal of this dissertation was to examine the impact that alliances may have on brand perceptions. The study explored whether brand attitudes concerning image and favorability can be enhanced, diluted, or strengthened as the result of an alliance. Based on insight from schema theory, the associative network memory model, and congruity theory it was hypothesized that <b>brand</b> image and <b>favorability</b> perceptions could be altered by an alliance. ...|$|R
5000|$|This {{commercial}} {{structure is}} from State Farm's [...] "Get to a Better State" [...] campaign that premiered in June 2011, {{with an increased}} spending budget. As a result, State Farm’s <b>brand</b> awareness and <b>favorability</b> has gone up considerably. This campaign focuses on making humor out of unfortunate problems that are commonly faced. These commercials then make light of the situation by demonstrating {{how easy it is}} to contact an agent and correct the problem that has occurred. Each of these commercials follows a similar structure. A group of one to three people find themselves in an unfortunate situation. Someone in the group will then call on their State Farm agent by singing the jingle “like a good neighbor, State Farm is there”. A State Farm agent will then appear and help the group out with their problem. There are a few commercials that deviate from this structure, but still follow the same ultimate pattern.|$|R
