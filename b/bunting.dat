5|$|The {{yellowhammer}} {{was described}} by Linnaeus in his Systema Naturae in 1758 under its current scientific name. Emberiza {{is derived from the}} Old German embritz, a <b>bunting,</b> and citrinella is the Italian for a small yellow bird. The English name is thought to have come from ammer, another German word for a <b>bunting,</b> and was first recorded in 1553 as yelambre.|$|E

5|$|The bird family Emberizidae {{contains}} around 300 seed-eating species, {{the majority}} of which {{are found in the}} Americas, although the genus Emberiza, with more than forty members, is confined to the Old World. Within its genus, the yellowhammer is most closely related to the pine <b>bunting,</b> with which it forms a superspecies; they have at times been considered as one species. The white-capped and cirl buntings are also near relatives of the species pair. Where their ranges meet, the yellowhammer and pine <b>bunting</b> interbreed; the yellowhammer is dominant, and the hybrid zone is moving further east.|$|E

50|$|The pine <b>bunting's</b> {{natural food}} {{consists}} seeds, and when feeding young, insects. The nest {{is on the}} ground. Four to six eggs are laid, which show the hair-like markings characteristic of <b>buntings.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1942, German bombs hit the {{buildings}} of <b>Buntings,</b> Curl Brothers and Woolworths. The Woolworths and Curl Brothers buildings were completely destroyed, however <b>Buntings</b> was patched up {{and used as}} a NAAFI Service club.|$|R
5|$|The pine <b>bunting</b> and {{yellowhammer}} are {{so closely}} related that each {{responds to the}} other's song. The male yellowhammer's song is more attractive to females, and is {{one reason for the}} dominance of that species where the ranges overlap.|$|E
5|$|Grant {{historian}} Josiah <b>Bunting</b> III {{noted that}} Grant was never {{put on his}} guard when Secretary Belknap came to the White House in a disturbed manner or even asked why Belknap wanted to resign in the first place. <b>Bunting</b> argues that Grant should have pressed Belknap into {{an explanation for the}} abrupt resignation request. Grant's acceptance of the resignation indirectly allowed Belknap, after he was impeached by the House of Representatives for his actions, to escape conviction, since he was no longer a government official. Belknap was acquitted by the Senate, escaping with less than the two-thirds majority vote needed for conviction. Even though the Senate voted that it could put private citizens on trial, many senators were reluctant to convict Belknap since he was no longer Secretary of War. It has been suggested that Grant accepted the resignation in a Victorian impulse to protect the women involved.|$|E
5|$|In French drawings, Vengeur {{is often}} {{depicted}} as flying the Tricolour, {{which had been}} recently ordered by the Convention to be flown as battle ensign; however, {{due to a lack}} of <b>bunting</b> in Brest, Villaret had not been able to distribute this flag to all his ships, and thus Vengeur probably still flew the white flag with a canton of three equal columns of red, white, and blue.|$|E

50|$|The {{site was}} {{classified}} as an IBA because it supports significant numbers of the populations of various bird species, either as residents, or as breeding or passage migrants. These include saker falcons, cinereous vultures, European rollers, Upcher's warblers, plain leaf-warblers, white-throated robins, Finsch's wheatears, variable wheatears, chestnut-breasted <b>buntings</b> and grey-necked <b>buntings.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The genus Passerina is a {{group of}} birds in the {{cardinal}} family (Cardinalidae). Although not directly related to <b>buntings</b> in the family Emberizidae, they are sometimes known as the North American <b>buntings</b> (the North American Emberizidae are colloquially called [...] "sparrows" [...] although they are also not related to these birds).|$|R
5|$|It {{was one of}} the texts, {{along with}} Thomas Bewick's {{contemporaneous}} A History of British Birds (2 volumes, 1797 and 1804) that made ornithology popular in Britain, and, with the 1676 Ornithologia libri tres of Francis Willughby and John Ray, helped to make it the object of serious study. The book includes a description of the cirl <b>bunting,</b> discovered by Montagu in 1800 near his home in Kingsbridge, Devon.|$|E

5|$|Species present {{all year}} round include little and great crested grebes, lapwing, redshank, tufted duck, gadwall, kingfisher, reed <b>bunting,</b> great spotted woodpecker, {{sparrowhawk}} and little owl. In the spring, passage waders visit the pools alongside the estuary; these include whimbrel, common, wood and green sandpipers, spotted redshank, common greenshank, avocet, godwit, little gull and black tern, and other migrants arriving at the reserve include wheatear, whinchat, redstart and black redstart.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) {{estimates}} the European {{population of the}} yellowhammer to be from 54–93million individuals, suggesting a Eurasian total of 73–186million birds. Although the population {{appears to be in}} a decline, the decrease is not rapid enough to trigger the IUCN vulnerability criteria. The large numbers and huge breeding range of about 12.9million km2 (5million sq mi), mean that this <b>bunting</b> is classified by the IUCN as being of least concern.|$|E
5|$|Yellowhammers of the British and Irish race, E. c. caliginosa were {{introduced}} to New Zealand by local acclimatisation societies in 1862, and soon spread over the main islands. They sometimes visit New Zealand's subantarctic islands, although rarely staying to breed, and have reached Australia's Lord Howe Island {{on a number of}} occasions. At the beginning of the 20th century, this <b>bunting</b> was seen as a serious agricultural pest in its adopted country.|$|E
50|$|The {{site was}} {{identified}} as an IBA by BirdLife International because it supports significant numbers of the populations of various bird species, either as resident breeders or on migration. These include see-see partridges, ruddy shelducks, saker falcons, common cranes, Upcher's warblers, plain leaf-warblers, eastern rock-nuthatches, white-throated robins, Finsch's wheatears, variable wheatears, red-tailed wheatears, chestnut-breasted <b>buntings</b> and grey-necked <b>buntings.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Once <b>Bunting’s</b> {{idea was}} made public and the {{announcement}} appeared {{on the front page}} of the New York Times in the fall of 1960, more than 2,000 women inquired about the [...] "experiment."

5|$|Between {{the river}} {{mouth and the}} River Witham, a large expanse of {{saltmarsh}} provides breeding grounds for common redshank, Eurasian oystercatcher and reed <b>bunting</b> in the summer, and Eurasian wigeon, mallard, common shelduck and common teal in the winter. Birds of prey such as hen harrier and merlin feed on the flocks of linnet and twite, while the mudflats support dunlin, whimbrel, and bar-tailed godwit. The Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust have a reserve there, which is next to RSPB Frampton Marsh, a reserve managed by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.|$|E
5|$|Females and juveniles, {{especially}} of the pale eastern subspecies, E. c. erythrogenys, may be confused with pine buntings, but they always have a yellow tint to their plumage, a paler rufous rump and more uniform upperparts than that species. Young and female yellowhammers can be distinguished from cirl buntings by the grey-brown rump of the latter species. Male hybrids with pine <b>bunting</b> are typically white-faced and have some yellow on the head, underparts or flight feathers, but females are usually indistinguishable from yellowhammers.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, {{the death}} of Emperor Hirohito once again raised moral issues about the {{national}} flag. Conservatives felt that if the flag could be used during the ceremonies without reopening old wounds, they might {{have a chance to}} propose that the Hinomaru become the national flag without being challenged about its meaning. During an official six-day mourning period, flags were flown at half staff or draped in black <b>bunting</b> all across Japan. Despite reports of protesters vandalizing the Hinomaru {{on the day of the}} Emperor's funeral, schools' right to fly the Japanese flag at half-staff without reservations brought success to the conservatives.|$|E
50|$|Ecological traps {{are thought}} to occur when the {{attractiveness}} of a habitat increases disproportionately in relation to its value for survival and reproduction. The result is preference of falsely attractive habitat and a general avoidance of high-quality but less-attractive habitats. For example, Indigo <b>buntings</b> typically nest in shrubby habitat or broken forest transitions between closed canopy forest and open field. Human activity can create 'sharper', more abrupt forest edges and <b>buntings</b> prefer to nest along these edges. However, these artificial sharp forest edges also concentrate the movement of predators which predate their nests. In this way, <b>Buntings</b> prefer to nest in highly altered habitats where their nest success is lowest.|$|R

5|$|Lundy has {{attracted}} many vagrant birds, in particular species from North America. The island's bird list totals 317 species. This has {{included the following}} species, each of which represents the sole British record: Ancient murrelet, eastern phoebe and eastern towhee. Records of bimaculated lark, American robin and common yellowthroat were also firsts for Britain (American robin has also occurred two further times on Lundy). Veerys in 1987 and 1997 were Britain's second and fourth records, a Rüppell's warbler in 1979 was Britain's second, an eastern Bonelli's warbler in 2004 was Britain's fourth, and a black-faced <b>bunting</b> in 2001 Britain's third.|$|E

Princess Alice made four more roundtrips through early August, then shifted to Bremen–Suez Canal–Far East service, making her first Lloyd voyage on that route 31August. Princess Alice would continue this pattern—sailing the North Atlantic during the heaviest-trafficked season and shifting to the Far East runs for the balance of the year—through 1910.|$|E
5|$|The {{entire body}} {{of the book is}} {{arranged}} as a dictionary from Aberdevine ('Vide Siskin.) on page 58 (the pages are however not numbered in the original) to Yelper ('Vide Avoset.) on page 687. Since the book does not have a continuous narrative to summarise, the account here will use one species as a running example to illustrate the book's approach. The cirl <b>bunting</b> is chosen because it was discovered by Montagu and is associated in Britain with his home town of Kingsbridge, Devon. He also chose the species for the colour frontispiece of the book.|$|E
