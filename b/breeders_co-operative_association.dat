The research found that co-ops experience significantly higher survival rates than other forms of business start-ups. For example, the three year survival rate for co-ops incorporated in 2005 and 2006 was 81. 5 % compared to 48 % for conventional firms in Alberta. Key success factors identified by participants were: • Boards with the right skill sets which worked effectively together • Effective communications between board, staff, and members. • Realistic business plans • Engaged membership • Start-up and development capitalization • Acquiring needed expertise • Coordination of the multitude of developmental tasks • Mentorship. The report includes recommendations for ways to enhance support to co-operative development and survival.
