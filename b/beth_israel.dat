5|$|As {{a result}} of Hurricane Katrina and the {{subsequent}} 2005 levee failures in Greater New Orleans, the congregation's building at 7000 Canal Boulevard filled with at least ten feet of water, and <b>Beth</b> <b>Israel</b> garnered national attention after {{attempts were made to}} save its Torah scrolls. Beth Israel's rabbi, Yisroel Shiff, who had evacuated to Tennessee before Katrina hit, contacted Rabbi Isaac Leider, who had worked on ZAKA search-and-rescue teams in Israel for five years. After contacting federal officials and the Louisiana National Guard, Leider hired a helicopter to fly him to within a mile of <b>Beth</b> <b>Israel,</b> met with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) search-and-rescue team appointed to retrieve the scrolls. The group used rubber rafts to reach <b>Beth</b> <b>Israel</b> and enter it, where Leider waded into the sanctuary and rescued the Torah scrolls and their silver ornaments.|$|E
5|$|In 1905, <b>Beth</b> <b>Israel</b> {{purchased}} {{the home of}} New Orleans' former mayor Joseph A. Shakspeare at 1610 Carondelet Street. Funds for the new acquisition came from both the Orthodox and Reform communities of New Orleans. After remodeling the building, the congregation began holding services there, {{in time for the}} 1906 High Holy Days. Membership grew quickly; by 1910 <b>Beth</b> <b>Israel</b> was the second-largest Jewish congregation in the city, with 180 member families, and by 1914 that number had grown to 250 families. By 1918, however, membership had fallen to 175 families. That year the synagogue's income was $6,000 (today $).|$|E

5|$|Despite Leider's efforts, {{all seven}} Torah scrolls were unsalvageable, {{and had to}} be buried. They had {{initially}} been buried in her backyard by Rebecca Heggelund, <b>Beth</b> <b>Israel's</b> non-Jewish secretary, who first received them after their rescue, and were subsequently re-buried next to the grave of <b>Beth</b> <b>Israel's</b> gabbai Meyer Lachoff. Lachoff had died just after Katrina, but could not be buried in New Orleans until months later.|$|R
25|$|Haim Cassorla {{replaced}} Harary in 1988; when he left, in 1995, {{the congregation}} {{could not afford}} to hire a replacement. Dr. Laurence Boxer acted in place of a rabbi, without remuneration, conducting all services and grave-side rituals. By 1998 <b>Beth</b> <b>Israel's</b> membership had dropped to 65 families, and by 2008 membership was 50 families. In the 2000s, <b>Beth</b> <b>Israel's</b> president was Dr. Lawrence Wolfgang.|$|R

5|$|In 2005 Cohen started {{classes for}} adults {{who wished to}} {{celebrate}} their Bar and Bat Mitzvah, but had not had the opportunity when 12 or 13. That same year, {{in the aftermath of}} Hurricane Katrina, <b>Beth</b> <b>Israel</b> welcomed between 75 and 100 evacuees from New Orleans. In 2006 <b>Beth</b> <b>Israel</b> had a membership of approximately 200 families which, in contrast with Mississippi's other Jewish congregations, was slowly growing. Beth Israel's services were attended by about 50 people in 2008. , it remained the first, and only, synagogue in Jackson, and was the largest Jewish congregation in the state. Cohen was the rabbi.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to losing {{all of its}} Torah scrolls, <b>Beth</b> <b>Israel</b> lost all its furniture, and over 3,000 siddurs and mahzors, {{and almost all of}} its members' homes were flooded, forcing them to move. The congregation did, however, receive assistance in replacing some of its assets; the Orthodox Union immediately sent <b>Beth</b> <b>Israel</b> 50 ArtScroll siddurs, and Brith Shalom <b>Beth</b> <b>Israel</b> Congregation of Charleston, South Carolina, and Congregation Shaare Zedek Sons of Abraham of Providence, Rhode Island each donated Torahs. Hayley Fields, a 14-year-old from Los Angeles, heard of Beth Israel's difficult circumstances, and with the support of her mother, spearheaded a fund-raising drive, selling 3,500 watches. $18,000 was ultimately raised to buy a Torah, which was dedicated in August, 2006, two days before {{the first anniversary of the}} hurricane. At that ceremony the National Council of Young Israel also donated 150 new Artscoll mahzors, in time for the High Holy Days.|$|E
5|$|Tensions eased when <b>Beth</b> <b>Israel</b> hired {{its first}} Rabbi, the Reverend L. Winter, in 1870. He moved the {{congregation}} towards Reform Judaism, replacing Saturday services with Friday night ones, giving sermons in English, and adding confirmation ceremonies. However, Winter left soon afterward. Beth Israel's building burned down in 1874, {{and was replaced}} by a stone and brick building at the same location. In 1875 <b>Beth</b> <b>Israel</b> formalized its move to Reform by joining the Union of American Hebrew Congregations (now Union for Reform Judaism).|$|E

5|$|Besides {{their main}} campus in Broadmoor, the {{congregation}} also operates <b>Beth</b> <b>Israel</b> Cemetery, {{listed on the}} National Register of Historic Places in 1989. Located at 19th Street and 5th Avenue, it was originally outside of Meridian's city limits and {{was intended to be}} a rural cemetery, but the city has since expanded and annexed the area containing the cemetery. The cemetery contains generations of German and Alsatian immigrants, as well as many big names of the largely mercantile Jewish community of {{the late nineteenth and early}} twentieth centuries. <b>Beth</b> <b>Israel</b> Cemetery is the only remaining built memorial for many of Meridian's early Jews since the era of the 1879 and 1906 temple buildings, neither of which still stands.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} days of Lauderdale County before Meridian was established, the nearby town of Marion was the largest {{settlement}} in the area. The families of Abraham Threefoot, Isaac Rosenbaum, Leopold Rosenbaum, E. Lowenstein, and Jacob Cohen lived in Marion during these early years. These families, along with other Jews in Marion, worked with Jews from the up-and-coming Meridian to build a temple halfway between the two towns. After the American Civil War, Meridian began to grow rapidly and Marion began to decline. As a result, many of Marion's Jews elected to move to Meridian. In 1868, the Jewish community established the first Jewish congregation in Lauderdale County, <b>Beth</b> <b>Israel,</b> and bought the lot which is now the <b>Beth</b> <b>Israel</b> Cemetery for $100 (today $).|$|E
