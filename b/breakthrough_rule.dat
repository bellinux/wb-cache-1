40|$|In {{the context}} of anti-crisis measures, the Italian Parliament amended the rules on public {{takeover}} bids, making the passivity rule and the <b>breakthrough</b> <b>rule</b> optional (as allowed by the 2004 European Directive). This choice {{appears to be in}} line with the laws of most European member States, but it is nevertheless a radical change with respect to the traditional Italian regulation, which used to be based - since the introduction of the law on takeover bids - on the principle of the mandatory passivity. The article analyses the issue and explain that that radical change of perspective could be understood only if considered {{as a part of the}} legislative responses to the global finance turmoil...|$|E
40|$|The Board Neutrality and Breakthrough {{rules as}} found in the European Takeover Bids Directive were {{intended}} to be cornerstones of a harmonised European takeover regime. However, both lost {{a great deal of}} significance after being rendered optional, due to a late-stage political compromise. This thesis undertakes an economic assessment in order to ascertain whether the current rules represent an optimal solution for European companies. This is married with a historical evaluation in an attempt to consider reforms which are both economically positive and politically viable. The evidence produced favours suggestions that the Board Neutrality rule should remain optional, while altering the 'opt-out' system. However there is little economic justification for the European <b>Breakthrough</b> <b>rule</b> as it currently stands. ...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, I {{tackle the}} {{question}} whether one share - one vote should become a European law rule. I examine, first of all, the economic theory concerning one share - one vote and its optimality, and the law and economics literature on dual class recapitalizations and other deviations from one share - one vote. I also consider the agency costs of deviations from one share - one vote and examine whether they justify regulation. I subsequently analyze the rules implementing the one share - one vote standard in the US and Europe. In particular, I analyze the self-regulatory rules of US exchanges, the relevant provisions of the European Takeover Directive (including the well known break-through rule), and the European Court of Justice's position as to golden shares (which also are deviations from the one share - one vote standard). I conclude that one share - one vote is not justified by economic efficiency, as also confirmed by comparative law. Also the European <b>breakthrough</b> <b>rule,</b> which ultimately strikes down all deviations from one share - one vote, {{does not appear to}} be well grounded. Only transparency rules appear to be justified at EU level as disclosure of ownership and voting structures serves a pricing and governance function, while harmonisation of the relevant rules reduces transaction costs in integrated markets...|$|E
5000|$|At {{first the}} party was clearly {{nationalist}} and staunchly conservative. The importance of a strong defense was underlined and other societal institutions embraced by the party were the monarchy {{and the state of}} law. The party held initially a protectionist view towards the economy; tariffs were widely supported as well as interventionist economical measures such as agricultural subsidies. In the defence policy crisis in 1914, which overturned the parliamentary Liberal government, the party sided with King Gustav but stopped short of accepting a right-wing government by royal appointment, instead opting for an independent-conservative [...] "war cabinet" [...] under Hjalmar Hammarskjöld which was eventually overturned in favor of a Liberal-Social Democratic majority coalition government and thus the <b>breakthrough</b> of parliamentary <b>rule,</b> albeit reluctantly embraced by the right.|$|R
40|$|Background: Resistance-associated substitutions (RAS) {{are usually}} {{determined}} after treatment failure of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) drugs, before a new DAA regimen is started. We investigated {{the presence of}} RAS in HCV quasispecies after therapy failure and compared them with baseline sequences to assess the accumulation of RAS and their role in treatment failure. Materials and methods: Frequent longitudinal serum sampling from four HCV 1 b chronic infected patients was performed. Deep sequencing of NS 3 and NS 5 B regions, by Ion Personal Genome Machine Sequencer, was applied. Sample-specific consensus sequences were generated from error corrected and adapter cleaned reads using reference guided de novo assembly with Vicuna and the Viral Finishing and Annotation Toolkit. HCV subtyping was performed by manual phylogenetic analysis using PhyML, and by typing tools COMET and Oxford. RAS were analyzed aligning HCV 1 b reference sequences and subsequently by Geno 2 pheno tool. Results: All patients were DAA-naïve, not HIV/HBV co-infected. First line therapy for patients 1 and 2 consisted of telaprevir containing regimen, while patient 3 was first treated with simeprevir + daclatasvir and patient 4 with boceprevir in combination with peg-interferon/ribavirin. After failure, {{all of them were}} treated with simeprevir + sofosbuvir. Patient 3 had further failure to the last therapy. At <b>breakthrough</b> in majority <b>rule</b> consensus sequence of patient 1, we found NS 354 A RAS, which reduces susceptibility to telaprevir and boceprevir. At baseline this patient’s virus population had NS 3 substitution 122 G as majority variant, which is not a RAS but located at a hot spot position related to simeprevir resistance (NS 3122 R). Concerning patient 3, the breakthrough viral population harboured NS 3168 V RAS (simeprevir, asunaprevir, paritaprevir and grazoprevir resistances) as majority variant. This RAS was not detected at baseline and could no longer be detected as majority variant nine months after breakthrough. Additionally, in patient 3, NS 5 B 159 F sofosbuvir RAS and the NS 5 B 316 N fitness-associated substitution were detected in the majority rule consensus sequence at all time points, these pre-existing RAS may have contributed to treatment failure. For two of the patients, only a baseline sample was available. In patient 2, the majority rule consensus sequence of NS 3 contained the NS 3170 I substitution on a hot spot position related to boceprevir, simeprevir and telaprevir resistances (NS 3170 A/T). In patient 4, the majority population harboured NS 3174 T substitution on a hot spot position related to boceprevir and telaprevir resistances (NS 3174 F/S). Conclusions: Our data illustrate the importance of resistance testing at baseline and before retreatment after DAA therapy failure. As recently reported in published data, the V amino acidic substitution on 168 position is generally less fit in the absence of selective Protease Inhibitors pressure. Indeed, reversal of treatment acquired NS 3168 V RAS after treatment failure in one patient suggests a fitness cost for this mutation. This reversion to DAA-sensitive virus in just a few months raises concern about time of testing and retreatment. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This DPhil thesis {{analyses}} the Takeover Bid Directive in {{the light}} of EU Law and examines the extent to which this Directive facilitates the exercise of the fundamental freedom of establishment and the free movement of capital in the internal market. Since the Directive is based on the EC Treaty chapter on freedom of establishment (Articles 43 and 44 (2) (g) EC Treaty), it should in principle contribute to cross frontier corporate mobility in the internal market through takeover bids; this was the aim of the Commission in its various proposals. Takeover bids and the EC Treaty provisions on freedom of establishment are closely related. The Directive forms part of the EU company law harmonization programme whose weaknesses and limits are also explored. However, the Takeover Bid Directive is an EU company law instrument with strong links to EU capital market law. The initial aims of the EU legislature were to establish an internal market for companies and to achieve market integration in the field of EU company law. However, the Takeover Bid Directive is a compromise and watered down version of a proposal which the Commission envisaged would lead to a more effective pan-European takeover regime than that which actually proved possible. The need for compromise {{was the result of the}} very different legal and policy approaches of the Member States in the field of takeover regulation. Some provisions of the Directive are obligatory for all Member States. These provisions include the mandatory bid rule, the squeeze-out right, and the sell-out right. All these obligatory provisions of the Directive are in their present form open to criticism. The two key provisions of the Directive have been made optional for Member States. These are the non-frustration rule, requiring the board to obtain the prior authorization of the general meeting of shareholders before taking any action which could result in the frustration of the bid; and the <b>breakthrough</b> <b>rule,</b> requiring that any restrictions on the transfer of securities or voting rights provided for in the articles of association of the offeree company or in contractual agreements between the offeree company and the holders of its securities or in contractual agreements between holders of the offeree company’s securities shall not apply vis-à-vis the offeror during the time allowed for acceptance of the bid. Nevertheless, Member States, which opt out, are obliged to allow individual companies to opt in. Moreover, a reciprocity rule was also adopted, which allows Member States to permit those companies, which apply these provisions, to opt out again if they are the target of a bidder, which does not itself apply the same takeover provisions. Additionally, the non-frustration and the <b>breakthrough</b> <b>rule</b> are not fully comprehensive and even when a company applies them, it might still be able to evade their application since some corporate and financial structures remain outside the Directive’s scope. Finally, this thesis discusses the extent to which obstacles to cross border takeovers addressed by the Directive, or indeed left intact by the Directive, are to be regarded as restrictions on the right of establishment stricto sensu, or simply as obstacles in practice to making a successful takeover bid. More specifically, it scrutinizes the horizontal direct effect of the EC fundamental freedoms and seeks to analyze the extent to which conduct of the board and articles in the corporate constitution might be said to constitute restrictions on the freedom of establishment and on the free movement of capital.

40|$|It is {{too early}} to make a {{complete}} judgment on the effectiveness of Directive 2004 / 25 /EC on Takeover Bids as a regulatory mechanism. Such a decision would involve determining whether the Directive: achieves its goals, secures high levels of compliance from Member States and market participants and is democratically accountable. However, this paper places the Directive under a regulatory microscope in order to reflect upon some of its potential strengths and failings in respect of these criteria. A central regulatory problem for European legislators involved determining the optimal balance between harmonization and diversity. In an attempt to reach agreement between Member States, a framework Directive was agreed laying down minimum standards for takeover regulation and a number of key provisions were made optional. On the one hand, it is argued that even this 2 ̆ 2 light regulatory touch 2 ̆ 2 may have jeopardised the existing efficient self-regulatory regime which operates in the UK, the largest European takeover market. On the other hand, by allowing Member States a significant degree of discretion in implementing the Directive, problems of interpretation and classification arise (is the Directive a company law directive or a capital markets directive?), regulatory gaps may be identified, national differences emerge and the achievement of the Directive 2 ̆ 7 s goal of facilitating takeovers and yielding a level playing field may be thwarted. In respect of the latter, the paper focuses on the restrictions on frustrating action and the <b>breakthrough</b> <b>rule.</b> Finally, the paper seeks to determine whether, in this context, competition is preferable to harmonisation. It was hoped that by setting down benchmarks the Directive might 2 ̆ 2 put a floor to the race to the bottom. 2 ̆ 2 Unfortunately, it is argued that the picture post-implementation does not support this contention...|$|E
