25|$|The SSRIs are {{the first}} rationally {{designed}} class of psychotropic medications. The strategy behind rational drug design {{is to develop a}} new drug that is capable of affecting a specific biological target, or in this case a special neural site of action (uptake pumps, receptors), while trying to avoid effects on other site of actions. The goal in such development is to produce pharmacological agents that are more efficacious, safer and better tolerated than older medications. An initial success was achieved when medicinal chemists set out in search of the ideal SSRI with the chemical synthesis of zimelidine (figure 1) from the antihistamine drug <b>brompheniramine,</b> which exhibited selective inhibition of 5-HT re-uptake with minimal inhibition of norepinephrine (NE) re-uptake. Most importantly, zimelidine did not come with the adverse effect profile as the TCAs and therefore it became the template for the second generation SSRIs. Zimelidine was the first SSRI to be marketed, but several cases of Guillain–Barré syndrome were {{associated with the use of}} the drug which led to withdrawal from the market in 1983. Subsequently, several non-tricyclic SSRIs were discovered and marketed. Fluoxetine, which was FDA approved in 1987 and is usually thought to be the first SSRI to be marketed, paved the way for the next generation of SSRIs and was thought to be some kind of prototype. Introduction of fluoxetine to the market is hailed as a miracle drug for the treatment of depression because it had fewer adverse effects, simpler dosing strategies and greater margin of safety when overdoses were consumed and thus it had better adherence, compared to the older antidepressants (TCAs and MAOIs). Since then the number of drugs in the SSRI class has become bigger and they are now six (fluoxetine, paroxetine, citalopram, escitalopram, sertraline and fluvoxamine), as demonstrated in table 1.|$|E
2500|$|Itching and {{flushing}} {{and other}} effects of blood vessel dilation are also common side-effects, due to histamine release {{in response to}} the drug using one or more types of receptors in the CNS or other responses elsewhere in the body. [...] First-generation antihistamines such as tripelennamine (Pyrabenzamine), clemastine (Tavist), hydroxyzine (Atarax), diphenhydramine (Benadryl), cyproheptadine (Periactin), <b>brompheniramine</b> (Dimetapp), chlorphenamine (Chlor-Trimeton), doxylamine (NyQuil) and phenyltoloxamine (Percogesic Original Formula) not only combat the histamine-driven side-effects, but are analgesic-sparing (potentiating) in various degrees. The antihistamine promethazine (Phenergan) may also {{have a positive effect on}} hepatic metabolism of dihydrocodeine as it does with codeine. Higher doses of promethazine may interfere with most other opioids with the exception of the pethidine family (Demerol and the like) by this or other unknown mechanisms.|$|E
50|$|The {{halogenated}} alkylamine antihistamines all exhibit optic isomerism and <b>brompheniramine</b> products contain racaemic <b>brompheniramine</b> maleate whereas dexbrompheniramine (Drixoral) is the dextrorotary (right-handed) stereoisomer.|$|E
50|$|<b>Brompheniramine's</b> {{effects on}} the {{cholinergic}} system may include side-effects such as drowsiness, sedation, dry mouth, dry throat, blurred vision, and increased heart rate. It is listed {{as one of the}} drugs of highest anticholinergic activity in a study of anticholinergenic burden, including long-term cognitive impairment.|$|R
50|$|<b>Brompheniramine</b> has {{antidepressant}} properties, inhibiting reuptake of the neurotransmitter serotonin and norepinephrine. Based on this knowledge, Arvid Carlssonand his colleagues, {{working at}} the Swedish company Astra AB, were able to derive the first marketed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, zimelidine, from <b>brompheniramine.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Brompheniramine</b> is metabolised by {{cytochrome}} P450s.|$|E
50|$|Zimelidine was {{developed}} in the late 1970s and early 1980s by Arvid Carlsson, who was then working for the Swedish company Astra AB. It was discovered following a search for drugs with structures similar to <b>brompheniramine</b> (it is a derivative of <b>brompheniramine),</b> an antihistamine with antidepressant activity. Zimelidine was first sold in 1982.|$|E
50|$|<b>Brompheniramine</b> (Bromfed, Dimetapp, Bromfenex, Dimetane, BPN, Lodrane), {{commonly}} {{marketed as}} its salt <b>brompheniramine</b> maleate, is an antihistamine drug of the propylamine (alkylamine) class. It {{is readily available}} over the counter and is indicated {{for the treatment of}} the symptoms of the common cold and allergic rhinitis, such as runny nose, itchy eyes, watery eyes, and sneezing. It is a first-generation antihistamine.|$|E
5000|$|Others: <b>brompheniramine,</b> chlorpheniramine, cocaine, cyclobenzaprine, {{dextromethorphan}} (DXM), ketamine, MDPV, nefazodone, phencyclidine (PCP), pheniramine, sibutramine, trazodone ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Brompheniramine</b> {{is part of}} {{a series}} of antihistamines {{including}} pheniramine (Naphcon) and its halogenated derivatives and others including fluorpheniramine, chlorpheniramine, dexchlorpheniramine (Polaramine), triprolidine (Actifed), and iodopheniramine.|$|E
50|$|Like {{other agents}} of this type, <b>brompheniramine</b> also has analgesic-sparing (potentiating) effects on opioid analgesics, {{commonly}} reducing codeine, dihydrocodeine, and hydrocodone requirements by 10 to 35 percent.|$|E
50|$|Chlorphenamine {{is part of}} {{a series}} of antihistamines {{including}} pheniramine (Naphcon) and its halogenated derivatives and others including fluorpheniramine, dexchlorphenamine (Polaramine), <b>brompheniramine</b> (Dimetapp), dexbrompheniramine (Drixoral), deschlorpheniramine, triprolidine (Actifed), and iodopheniramine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Brompheniramine</b> is {{an analog}} of chlorpheniramine. The only {{difference}} is that the chlorine atom in the benzene ring is replaced with a bromine atom. It is also synthesized in an analogous manner.|$|E
50|$|<b>Brompheniramine</b> {{works by}} acting as an {{antagonist}} of histamine H1 receptors. It also {{functions as a}} moderately effective anticholinergic agent, and is likely an antimuscarinic agent similar to other common antihistamines such as diphenhydramine.|$|E
50|$|Zimelidine is an {{antidepressant}} and SSRI {{which was}} derived from the antihistamine pheniramine, which, similarly to its analogues <b>brompheniramine</b> and chlorpheniramine, possesses SNRI properties. Fluvoxamine, another antidepressant and SSRI, was developed from the antihistamine tripelennamine, which possesses SNDRI actions.|$|E
50|$|Derivatives of {{pheniramine}} include chlorphenamine, dexbrompheniramine, dexchlorpheniramine, triprolidine, and <b>brompheniramine.</b> Two other halogenated derivatives, iodopheniramine and fluorpheniramine, {{are currently}} in use for research on combination therapies for malaria and some cancers. The halogenation of pheniramine increases its potency by 20-fold.|$|E
50|$|Dexbrompheniramine is an {{antihistamine}} with anticholinergic properties used {{to treat}} allergic conditions such as hay fever or urticaria. It is the pharmacologically active dextrorotatory isomer of <b>brompheniramine.</b> It was formerly marketed in combination with pseudoephedrine under the name Drixoral in the US and Canada.|$|E
50|$|C. elegans {{is able to}} {{transform}} the tricyclic antidepressants amitriptyline and doxepin, the tetracyclic antidepressant mirtazapine, the muscle relaxant cyclobenzaprine, the typical antipsychotic chlorpromazine {{as well as the}} antihistamine and anticholinergic methdilazine and azatadine. It is also able {{to transform}} the antihistamines <b>brompheniramine,</b> chlorpheniramine and pheniramine.|$|E
50|$|While {{working at}} Astra AB, Carlsson {{and his colleagues}} were able to derive the first marketed {{selective}} serotonin reuptake inhibitor, zimelidine, from <b>brompheniramine.</b> Zimelidine preceded both Fluoxetine (Prozac) and Fluvoxamine as the first SSRI, but was later withdrawn from the market due to rare cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome.|$|E
50|$|CNS {{depressants}} {{may enhance}} the depressant effects of hydromorphone, such as other opioids, anesthetics, sedatives, hypnotics, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, phenothiazines, chloral hydrate, dimenhydrinate, and glutethimide. The depressant effect of hydromorphone {{may also be}} enhanced by MAO inhibitors (including procarbazine), first-generation antihistamines (<b>brompheniramine,</b> promethazine, diphenhydramine, chlorpheniramine), beta-blockers, and alcohol. When combined therapy is contemplated, the dose should be reduced of one or both agents.|$|E
50|$|In the 1960s, {{diphenhydramine}} {{was found}} to inhibit reuptake of the neurotransmitter serotonin. This discovery led to a search for viable antidepressants with similar structures and fewer side effects, culminating in the invention of fluoxetine (Prozac), a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). A similar search had previously led to the synthesis of the first SSRI, zimelidine, from <b>brompheniramine,</b> also an antihistamine.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to being a histamine H1 receptor antagonist, chlorphenamine has been found to act as a potent serotonin reuptake inhibitor (KD = 15.2 nM for the serotonin transporter). It has only weak affinity for the norepinephrine and dopamine transporters (KD = 1,440 nM and 1,060 nM, respectively). A similar antihistamine, <b>brompheniramine,</b> led to the discovery of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) zimelidine. Limited clinical evidence shows that chlorphenamine is comparable to several antidepressant medications in its ability to inhibit the reuptake of serotonin, and may be useful in the treatment of depression and anxiety disorders.|$|E
50|$|Itching and {{flushing}} {{and other}} effects of blood vessel dilation are also common side-effects, due to histamine release {{in response to}} the drug using one or more types of receptors in the CNS and/or other responses elsewhere in the body.

5000|$|Dimetapp is a {{brand of}} {{over-the-counter}} cold and allergy medicines manufactured by Pfizer (formerly Wyeth). At one point, Dimetapp as a household word referred to a single combination preparation marketed to relieve symptoms of the common cold, containing <b>brompheniramine</b> (an antihistamine) and phenylephrine (decongestant replacing the formerly used pseudoephedrine, which itself replaced phenylpropanolamine). Variants were created, including Dimetapp DM {{with the addition of}} dextromethorphan (an antitussive or cough suppressant). Dimetapp Elixir and Colour Free Elixir are intended to relieve nasal congestion, runny nose, itchy watery eyes and sneezing, whereas Dimetapp DM and Dimetapp DM Colour Free Elixir are intended for colds with dry coughs and also to treat whooping cough. Early Dimetapp liquid products were characterized by a strong grape candy flavor.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{investigate}} the effects of H 1 -antihistamines of the 1 st generation (antazoline, bromadryl, <b>brompheniramine,</b> dithiaden, cyclizine, chlorcyclizine, chlorpheniramine, clemastine) and the 2 nd generation (acrivastine, ketotifen, and loratadine) on the respiratory burst of phagocytes. Reactive oxygen species generation in neutrophils isolated from rat blood was measured using luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence. Changes in nitrite formation and iNOS protein expression by RAW 264. 7 macrophages were analysed using Griess reaction and Western blotting. The antioxidative properties of drugs in cell-free systems were detected spectrophotometrically, luminometrically, fluorimetrically, and amperometrically. The majority of the H 1 -antihistamines tested (bromadryl, <b>brompheniramine,</b> chlorcyclizine, chlorpheniramine, clemastine, dithiaden, and ketotifen) exhibited a significant inhibitory effect on the chemiluminescence activity of phagocytes. H 1 -antihistamines did not show significant scavenging properties against superoxide anion and hydroxyl radical, thus this could not contribute to the inhibition of chemiluminescence. H 1 -antihistamines had a different ability to modulate nitric oxide production by LPS-stimulated macrophages. Bromadryl, clemastine, and dithiaden were the most effective since they inhibited iNOS expression, which was followed by a significant reduction in nitrite levels. H 1 -antihistamines had no scavenging activity against nitric oxide. It can be concluded that the effects observed in the H 1 -antihistamines tested are not mediated exclusively via H 1 -receptor pathway or by direct antioxidative properties. Based on our results, antihistamines not interfering with the microbicidal mechanisms of leukocytes (antazoline, acrivastine and cyclizine) could be used preferentially in infections. Other antihistamines should be used, under pathological conditions accompanied by the overproduction of reactive oxygen species...|$|E

Corticosteroids do not appear to have adverse effects in pregnancy beyond those well recognized in nonpregnant patients.

The data were further confirmed by UV spectrometry and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The structure of the complexes in the solid state was determined using X-ray crystallography performed on the co-crystals precipitated from the 1 : 1 aqueous solution of selector and selectand. This multiple approach allowed an elucidation of the most likely structural reason for a different affinity (binding strength) of BrPh enantiomers towards &#x 3 b 2;-CD and TM-&#x 3 b 2;-CD.

40|$|Binding of the {{antihistamine}} drug <b>brompheniramine</b> (BPA) {{to human}} serum albumin (HSA) is studied by measuring quenching of the fluorescence and room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) of tryptophan. The modified Stern-Volmer equation {{was used to}} derive association constants and accessible fractions from the steady-state fluorescence data. Decay associated spectra (DAS) revealed three tryptophan fluorescence lifetimes, indicating the presence of three HSA conformations. BPA causes mainly static quenching of the long-living, solvent-exposed conformer. RTP spectra and lifetimes, recorded under deoxygenated conditions {{in the presence of}} 0. 2 M KI, provided additional kinetic information about the HSA-BPA interactions. Fluorescence DAS that were also recorded in the presence of 0. 2 M KI revealed that the solvent-exposed conformer is the major contributor to the RTP signal. The phosphorescence quenching is mostly dynamic at pH 7 and mostly static at pH 9, presumably related to the protonation state of the alkylamino chain of BPA. This provides direct insight into the binding mode of the antihistamine drug, as well as kinetic information at both the nanosecond and the millisecond time scales. © 2012 American Chemical Society...|$|E
40|$|An open-tubular {{capillary}} electrochromatography column was prepared by chemically immobilized β-cyclodextrin modified gold nanoparticles onto new surface with the prederivatization of (3 -mercaptopropyl) -trimethoxysilane. The synthesized nanoparticles and the prepared column {{were characterized by}} transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, infrared spectroscopy and ultraviolet visible spectroscopy. When the column was employed as the chiral stationary phase, no enantioselectivity was observed for ten model basic drugs. So β-cyclodextrin {{was added to the}} background electrolyte as chiral additive to expect a possible synergistic effect occurring and resulting in a better separation. Fortunately, significant improvement in enantioselectivity was obtained for ten pairs of drug enantiomers. Then, the effects of β-cyclodextrin concentration and background electrolyte pH on the chiral separation were investigated. With the developed separation mode, all the enantiomers (except for venlafaxine) were baseline separated in resolutions of 4. 49, 1. 68, 1. 88, 1. 57, 2. 52, 2. 33, 3. 24, 1. 63 and 3. 90 for zopiclone, chlorphenamine maleate, <b>brompheniramine</b> maleate, dioxopromethazine hydrochloride, carvedilol, homatropine hydrobromide, homatropine methylbromide, venlafaxine, sibutramine hydrochloride and terbutaline sulfate, respectively.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Excipients {{in various}} {{formulations}} of active drugs occasionally include known contact allergens. Their ingestion may trigger dermatitis or {{cause it to}} become widespread or refractory to therapy. OBJECTIVE: The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the prevalence of common contact allergens among the excipients of oral antihistamines available in this country. METHODS: We gathered the complete ingredient lists of 2119 different preparations of 12 oral antihistamines from the National Library of Medicine data bank and entered them into an electronic database for analysis. RESULTS: More than half the formulations (55. 0 %) contained at least 1 member of the 10 allergen families assessed. Most <b>brompheniramine</b> and doxepin preparations included potentially allergenic excipients, whereas fexofenadine was most often free of them. Sorbitan group members, azo dyes, and propylene glycol were the allergens found most frequently in the antihistamines, each present in over 25 % of the products. Elixirs, liquids, solutions, suspensions, and syrups were more likely than nonchewable caplets, capsules, and tablets to contain the allergens tabulated (100 % vs 39. 3 %, respectively). Chewable pills frequently contained azo dyes. CONCLUSIONS: Ingestion of antihistamines could precipitate a systemic contact dermatitis in a patient sensitized to an allergen present as an excipient in the medicine...|$|E
40|$|The {{activation}} of mast-cells in situ induces angiogenesis in normally vascularized, adult mammalian tissue. Since the secreting mast-cell characteristically releases histamine, we studied the possible role of histamine {{in the outcome}} of mast-cell mediated angiogenesis using the rat mesenteric window assay. One H 1 -receptor antagonist, <b>brompheniramine</b> maleate (BPA), and one H 2 -receptor antagonist, metiamide, were separately administered systemically (s. c.) at non-toxic doses during the period of angiogenesis induction. Angiogenesis was effected by i. p. injections of the mast-cell secretagogue compound 48 / 80 for 5 consecutive days. The animals were killed 14 days after the start of the i. p. and s. c. treatment, close {{to the middle of the}} expanding angiogenic phase of the angiogenic reaction studied. Angiogenesis was quantified in terms of (a) the number of vessel profiles per unit tissue length (No/UL), which reflects mainly the degree of branching and/or tortuosity, (b) the relative vascularized area (VA), which is a measure of spatial extension, and (c) the vascular density (VD), a measure of vessel density per unit area of vascularized tissue. Whereas BPA significantly suppressed No/UL, metiamide significantly reduced No/UL and VD in statistical terms suggesting that endogenous mast-cell histamine is angiogenic through both H 1 - and H 2 -receptors. This appears to be the first paper to report that the occupancy of H 2 -receptors is angiogenic...|$|E
40|$|Acute {{ultraviolet}} light B (UVB) injury {{is associated with}} dermal mast cell histamine release. The possibility that histamine-stimulated prostaglandin (PG) synthesis could be a mechanism for irradiation erythema was therefore examined using human skin explants. Explants responded to UV irradiation (120 mJ/cm 2) with a fivefold increase in synthesis of prostaglandins E 2, F 2 alpha and 6 -keto PGF 1 alpha. Incubating explants with the H 1 antihistamines <b>brompheniramine</b> (50 microM) or pyrilamine (30 microM) inhibited PG release from irradiated explants 63 +/- 4. 9 % (mean +/- SEM) 6 h after UV exposure. Antihistamines did not affect PG synthesis in control explants. Irradiation increased the histamine concentration in explant conditioned medium only 50 % over basal values, suggesting that irradiation enhanced histamine responsiveness. Explants were therefore incubated with exogenous histamine. In irradiated explants, PG synthesis was stimulated threefold by 3 microM histamine. Unirradiated explants' PG synthesis was unaffected by histamine. Enhanced histamine sensitivity was also examined in epidermal cell cultures. In irradiated cultures, histamine sensitivity was again markedly potentiated: as little as 1 microM histamine stimulated significant PGE 2 release and the response to 10 - 30 microM histamine was increased six to eight times {{compared with that of}} unirradiated cultures. These studies demonstrate that endogenous histamine stimulates PG synthesis in human skin after UV injury by potentiation of histamine-induced prostaglandin release. Potentiated agonist responses induced by UV exposure may contribute to the effects of UVB irradiation injury and in particular to irradiation erythema...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study a fast, {{sensitive}} and robust validated method to quantify chlorpheniramine in human plasma using <b>brompheniramine</b> as internal standard (IS) is described. The analyte and the IS were extracted from plasma by LLE (diethyl ether-dichloromethane, 80 : 20, v/v) and analyzed by HPLC-ESI-MS/MS. Chromatographic separation was performed using a gradient of methanol from 35 to 90 % with 2. 5 mm NH(4) OH on a Gemini Phenomenex C(8) 5 mu m column (50 x 4. 6 mm i. d.) in 5. 0 min/run. The method fitted to a linear calibration curve (0. 05 - 10 ng/mL, R > 0. 9991). The precision (%CV) and accuracy ranged, respectively: intra-batch from 1. 5 to 6. 8 % and 99. 1 to 106. 6 %, and inter-batch from 2. 4 to 9. 0 %, and 99. 9 to 103. 1 %. The validated bioanalytical procedure {{was used to assess}} the comparative bioavailability in healthy volunteers of two dexchlorpheniramine 2. 0 mg tablet formulations (test dexchlorpheniramine, Eurofarma, and reference Celestamine (R), Schering-Plough). The study was conducted using an open, randomized, two-period crossover design with a 2 week washout interval. Since the 90 % confidence interval for C(max) and AUC ratios were all within the 80 - 125 % interval proposed by ANVISA and FDA, it was concluded that test and reference formulations are bioequivalent concerning the rate and the extent of absorption.

40|$|A {{controlled}} photo-polymerisation {{procedure for}} {{the synthesis of}} spherical molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) beads {{through the use of}} a suspension polymerisation methodology is described. As molecular imprinting moves towards commercialisation, the need to produce packing materials with good flow properties is critical. A comparative study of non-covalent MIPs synthesised by suspension and bulk polymerisation methods using 2 -aminopyridine (2 -apy) as a template and methacrylic acid (MAA) as functional monomer to produce acrylate polymers is reported. The influence of experimental parameters such as temperature, agitation speed and cross-linker i. e. trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate (TRIM) and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) was examined in order to assess their impact on binding performance, yield, morphology and particle size distribution in the different polymers. It was concluded that for improved polymer performance, longer polymerisation times and lower temperatures resulted in the best polymer affinity for suspension polymerisation. A detailed investigation of polymers produced by varying pre-polymerisation composition was performed using binding isotherm analysis. The optimum isotherm for use for MIP analysis was found to be the Langmuir-Freundlich isotherm with additional information subsequently obtained by plotting affinity distribution spectra. A greater number of binding sites with similar binding energies were found in the suspension MIPs in comparison to NIPs. A GC-MS methodology was utilised to characterise the performance of polymers synthesised under varying conditions in the absence of solvent. A direct comparison was found between imprinting performance assessed by a GC-MS methodology and solution phase analysis experiments. To extend the scope of this study, MIPs were prepared for chlorpheniramine racemate (CP), dchlorpheniramine (d-CP), <b>brompheniramine</b> racemate (BP) and d-brompheniramine (d-BP) as the template molecules respectively employing a novel non-stabilised aqueous suspension polymerisation procedure. A cross-selectivity rebinding study was carried out on the polymers using chiral HPLC analysis. Higher uptake capacities and IF values were found for the BP polymers over the CP polymers. It is speculated the higher binding of BP polymers over CP is related to differences in polarisability between Br and Cl and steric constraints. The d-CP MIP prepared at 9500 rpm was packed as a HPLC stationary phase and the enantioselectivity and chromatographic behaviour of CP and BP was studied using an aqueous mobile phase. The highest enantioselectivity factor (1. 19) and resolution (0. 88) was obtained for CP over BP. Interestingly, BP was more retained on the d-CP MIP column than CP as a result of deprotonation correlating with equilibrium binding observations. The effect of column temperature on the d-CP MIP column was also studied for the separation of a mixture of d-CP and d-BP isomers and concluded that with increase in column temperature improved retention performance was observed with sharper peaks produced and an increase in resolution from 0. 61 to 0. 86. The d-CP imprinted column was also capable of separating pheniramine racemate (PHEN), CP and BP enantiomers using an aqueous mobile phase. The highest retention factor, enantioselectivity and resolution were observed for BP over the PHEN and CP enantiomers. This was explained due to the fact that all compounds possess similar pKa values and in addition the hydrophobicity is in the order of BP, CP and PHEN. The chromatographic behaviour and separation of CP, d-CP, BP and d-BP isomers were also studied on a d-BP imprinted column using an aqueous mobile phase. The retention, selectivity and resolution of BP and d-BP on the d-BP imprinted column were greater in comparison to CP and d-CP. The results showed that the d-CP and d-BP imprinted columns each gave the best enantioseparation for its own template. Physical characterisation of the polymers was carried out using nitrogen sorption porosimetry, particle size distribution, solvent swell studies and SEM. All samples exhibited low specific surface areas, pore volumes and pore diameters indicating non-porous materials. Trends were observed between the polymer properties characterised by the above techniques and the synthesis conditions...|$|E
