50|$|During {{the early}} 1930s, Prezent {{established}} himself as a critic of the leading Soviet ecologists of the time, and especially of the sub-field of <b>biocenology</b> as such. His attack on biocenologists had three directions: attack on the botanically-oriented ecologists, attack on then-most prominent Soviet educator in the field Boris Yevgenyevich Raikov, and finally attack on zoology-focused ecologists.|$|E
50|$|The {{attack on}} zoologists started early, during the Fourth All-Union Congress of Zoologists, Anatomists, and Histologists in Kiev in May 1930, where Prezent first made his {{criticism}} of <b>biocenology</b> public in an exchange with the prominent zoologist Vladimir Vladimirovich Stanchinskiy. Similarly to the tactics he employed in fighting the botanists, Prezent waited until the December 1931 All-Union Faunistics Conference, and navigated its organization into silencing and attacking conservationsim.|$|E
40|$|Alexander Ryumin is an {{extraordinary}} scientist, all his adult life and scientific career occurred mainly from {{the second half of}} the thirties up to the seventies of the twentieth century. Since childhood, his approach to science and the biological worldview was formed by Peter A. Manteufel at the Club of young biologists at the Moscow zoo. He graduated from the Moscow state University in 1936. His teachers and mentors were the great biologists: Mikhail A. Menzbir and Alexey N. Severtsov. He was interested in a wide range of biological problems associated with body temperature and thermoregulation in different animal groups, energy of living systems, the activities of the central nervous system, evolutionary process, <b>biocenology,</b> etc. He described the important evolutionary principle of stabilization of high body temperature in the evolution of vertebrates, and other biological regularities. In addition, he was involved in paleontological research, mostly of the Paleolithic period. In this regard, he was acquainted with such great scientists as Alexander Ya. Bryusov and Ivan A. Efremov and received help and support from them. He is known as a discoverer of the gallery of Paleolithic paintings in Kapova cave in the Southern Urals in Bashkiria. However, A. V. Ryumin, as a scientist with extraordinary thinking, was almost completely forgotten in subsequent generations of biologists. In the article the biography of A. V. Ryumin and the whole range of his scientific interests are described...|$|E
40|$|In {{this report}} the authorâ€™s {{attention}} is focused on the role and position of the phytocenosis in the ecosystem and the importance of phytoceno- logical investigations for the ecological, zoocenological and microbioceno- logical researches, and for the complex (teamwork) research of the ecosystem. The vegetable kingdom, as the only transformator of solar energy and the only of organic matter on the earth, constitutes a primarly, basic component not only of the biosphere, but also of every concrete biogeocenosis (ecosystem) on the earth. All the components of biosphere and particular ecosystems are, however, linked together with interrelations of conditionality and constant dependence (phyto-, zoo- and microbiocenosis and the biotope) in the unique process of matter and energy circulation. Thanks to this circulation, the survival and permanent regeneration of the ecosysten as a unique whole and of each of its components are made possible. Therefore, the true and complete ecological reality on the earth are only the biosphere and biogeocenosis (ecosystem), and not the phytosphere, phytocenosis and other components. When the position and role of one of the ecosystem components is separately determined, {{this does not mean that}} other components are underrated or that this is done by a conscious phylosophical or practical (research) dismemberment of the ecosystem, but that this is a methodically justified and necessary analysis of the significance of each of individual components for other components and the ecosystem as a whole. This may undoubtedly be useful not only in specialized (phytocenological, zoocenological, microbio- cenological) investigations, but also in complex investigations of the ecosystem. In addition to its basic and primary role in the metabolism of the ecosystem, the phytocenosis also represents a structurally most organized, most complex, most stable and most durable component of the ecosystem. As such, it constitutes its basis not only as regards the metabolism and structure but also the dynamics and succession. The vertical and horizontal differentiation of the ecosystem is to a large measure determined by the differentiation of the phytomass and the whole structure of the phytocenosis. Thus, for instance, the phytocenosis strata constitute the basis of biogeocenotic synusiae (Sukachev), that is, the basic structural parts of the ecosystem. But these may by further differentiated into biogeocenotic horizonts on the basis of animal and microbic species, groups and communities (Bjalovic). The time (seasonal and many-year) structure of phytocenosis and their historical successive development represent the basis for the dynamic and succession of zoo- and microbiocenoses and biotope, despite the phytocenosis dependence on other ecosystem components which obey their own laws of development and variability. As indicators of general climate, microclimate, phytoclimate and soil climate, and of other conditions of the biotope, the plant species, their cenotic groups (synusiae, micro- and macrocenotic complexes) and whole phytocenoses, may help analyze and differentiate the biocenosis and biotope. The bounderies of phyto-, zoo- and microbiocenoses often do not coincide, because the animal species and microorganisms and their communities are more variable and dynamic and with different manners of life and different reaction norms than the plant species and communities. In spite of this, a phytocenosis, (association) may serve as a basis for singling out, analyzing and classifying biogeocenoses, and provided that a teamwork system is employed in biocenotical investigations of concrete biogeocenoses, each particular case by itself may be solved, and in this way unique biogeocenotic types may gradually be formed. Investigations made no for by the local and foreign researches are eharakterized, on the one hand, by a very limited utilization of the results of phytocenological investigations, and on the other, by an insufficient collaboration of ecologists of different specialities in the complex study of ecosystem. And this is the task of the contemporary <b>biocenology...</b>|$|E
