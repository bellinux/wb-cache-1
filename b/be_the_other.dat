5|$|Qualifying {{followed}} the usual road and street course system, {{with the field}} being split into two groups. In {{the first group of}} twelve runners, Wilson topped the session, 0.46 seconds ahead of the HVM Racing machine of Switzerland's Simona de Silvestro—one of four female drivers in the race—with Alex Tagliani in third position. Other drivers to make it into the second session of qualifying were Power, Takuma Sato and Raphael Matos. The remaining twelve drivers took part in the second group, with Hunter-Reay topping his second session of the day. Hélio Castroneves, Briscoe, Franchitti, Dixon and Kanaan were the other competitors in the top six, and thus progressed to the second round of qualifying. In the Top 12, Power recorded the fastest lap time, holding off the British pair Wilson and Franchitti. Hunter-Reay, Kanaan and Tagliani finished between fourth and sixth, and would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> half of the drivers that progressed to the Fast Six. Franchitti saved his best lap of qualifying to the last possible moment, taking his thirteenth career IndyCar Series pole position, and his 24th in American open-wheel racing. Tagliani took second on the grid, on his début with the FAZZT Race Team. Wilson took third ahead of Hunter-Reay, Power and Kanaan.|$|E

NASA asked EG and Van den Berg to compile a list of eight people who would qualify to perform the science experiments in space and to become a Payload Specialist. Van den Berg and his chief, Dr. Harold A. Lamonds could only come up with seven names. Lamonds subsequently proposed adding Van den Berg to the list, joking with Van den Berg that due to his age, huge glasses and little strength, he would probably be dropped during the first selection round; but at least they would have eight names. Van den Berg agreed to be added to the list, but didn't really consider himself being selected to be a realistic scenario.|$|E

25|$|In Spain {{and in most}} Spanish-{{speaking}} countries, {{the custom}} is for people to have two surnames. Usually the first surname comes from {{the father and the}} second from the mother, but it could <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> way round. When speaking or in informal situations only the first one is used, although both are needed for legal purpose. A child's first surname will usually be their father's first surname, while the child's second surname will usually be the mother's first surname. For example, if José García Torres and María Acosta Gómez had a child named Pablo, then his full name would be Pablo García Acosta. One family member's relationship to another can often be identified by the various combinations and permutations of surnames.|$|E
25|$|Pittas {{were first}} {{described}} scientifically by Carl Linnaeus in 1766 in his revised 12th {{edition of the}} Systema Naturae. He placed the Indian pitta in the crow family and genus Corvus. Ten years later it {{was placed in the}} thrush family, due to similarities of morphology and behaviour, before being placed in its own genus, Pitta in 1816 by Louis Vieillot. Vieillot was also the first to consider the genus a family in its own right. The family's closest relatives have for a long time assumed to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> suboscine birds, and particularly the Old World broadbills and asities (formerly treated as two families, now either lumped into one or split into four).

A strong reason given by the Shi'a scholars for this belief is the event of (Mubahala) mentioned in the Quran, {{in which there is}} no reference to the presence of any other female apart from Fatimah, however Sunnis accept that Muhammad had four daughters all from Khadijah.|$|E

They resolve tomorrow to bring a more suitable piece of rope and, if Godot fails to arrive, to commit suicide at last. Again, they decide to clear out for the night, but, again, neither of them makes any attempt to move.|$|E

500|$|Good luck favored Bryan—he was {{considered}} for various convention roles by the silverites, {{but each time}} was not selected.

[...] Bryan considered this no loss at all; the focus of the convention was on the party platform and the debate which would precede its adoption. The platform would symbolize the repudiation of Cleveland and his policies after the insurgents' long struggle, and Bryan was determined to close the debate on the platform. Bryan, once seated, was Nebraska's representative to the Committee on Resolutions (generally called the [...] "platform committee"), which allocated 80minutes to each side in the debate and selected Bryan as one of the speakers. South Carolina Senator Benjamin Tillman was to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> pro-silver speaker, and originally wished to close the debate.

500|$|Qualifying {{followed}} the usual road and street course system, {{with the field}} being split into two groups. All cars were split into two groups of twelve, with the fastest six from each group going through to the [...] "Top 12" [...] session. In this session, the fastest six runners progressed to the [...] "Firestone Fast Six". The fastest driver in the final session claimed pole position, {{with the rest of}} the runners lining up in session order, regardless of qualifying times. (Fast Six from one to six, Top 12 from seven-twelve and Round 1 from 13–24, with Group 1 drivers occupying the odd-numbered grid positions, and Group 2 drivers occupying the even-numbered starting positions). Duno was prohibited from participating in qualifying because her practice lap times did not meet the required performance standards but was allowed to start the race. In the first group of twelve runners, Power paced the session, nearly three-tenths of a second faster than teammate Briscoe with Castroneves in third place. Other drivers to make it into the second session of qualifying were Franchitti, Wilson and Raphael Matos. The remaining twelve drivers took part in the second group, with Simona de Silvestro recording her fastest lap of the day. Hunter-Reay, Dixon, Viso, Mutoh and Scheckter were the other competitors in the top six, and thus progressed to the second round of qualifying. In the Top 12, Power set the fastest lap time, holding off teammate Castroneves and Dixon. Briscoe, Franchitti and Viso finished between fourth and sixth, and would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> half of the drivers that progressed to the Fast Six. Power clinched his sixth pole position of the season with a time of one minute and 00.7126 seconds. He was joined on the grid's front row by teammate Castroneves who had the pole position until Power's lap. Chip Ganassi Racing teammates Dixon and Franchitti were third and fourth, and Briscoe took fifth ahead of Viso.|$|E
500|$|The next match pitted Bam Bam Bigelow, Bastion Booger and The Headshrinkers (accompanied by Luna Vachon and Afa) {{against a}} team calling {{themselves}} the Four Doinks. After Bigelow's team was introduced, Doink the Clown's theme song began to play, but immediately {{switched to the}} theme of The Bushwhackers and Howard Finkel introduced the pair as Luke Doink and Butch Doink as they came down wearing clown wigs, with Luke riding a scooter and Butch pulling a wagon. As the fans waited to see who would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> two Doinks, the intro to Doink's theme played again and the two Doinks were joined by Mabel Doink and Mo Doink with their rapping manager Oscar Doink; as they came to the ring they were referred to by Bobby Heenan as [...] "Doinks on a Mission". Headshrinker Samu was eliminated first after he bit several of the balloons being carried by his opponents. He was purposely offered one more balloon by the Doinks, which he willfully bit into. Samu was stunned to find out that the balloon was full of water, which caused him to stumble back in surprise and Luke rolled him up and pinned him. Later, Booger has a chance to pin Luke after he hit the Trip to the Batcave on him. However, Booger got off of Luke and went to the corner where Headshrinker Fatu offered him a banana. As Booger was looking to perform the move again, his teammates dragged him away and Booger landed on his knees. Luke and Butch performed their trademark battering ram on Booger. Mabel then executed a leg drop on Booger and pinned him. Down four wrestlers to two, Bigelow's team appeared to be making a comeback when Fatu began taking down his opponents with the carcass of a turkey that Afa had been eating from the entire match. He then performed a top rope splash onto Mo. Fatu got distracted, however, and examined a banana peel with curiosity. Butch entered the ring with a bucket and faked out Fatu by making {{like he was going to}} toss the contents of the bucket onto him. This resulted in Fatu slipping on the banana peel, and Butch pinned him to eliminate him from the match. Left by himself, Bigelow began brutally atracking three of the Doinks and seemed to get the upper hand when Mabel entered the ring and Bigelow was unable to do much to him. Meanwhile, Butch dumped a bucket of confetti all over Luna, which caused Bigelow to become momentarily distracted and Mabel and Mo sandwiched him in the corner. Bigelow fell, Mabel performed a splash on him, and the referee counted the pin as the other three Doinks piled on. After the match, the real Doink the Clown appeared on the video screen to taunt Bigelow.|$|E
