5|$|La Fleche's stable companion, Orme, was {{regarded}} as {{the best of the}} year's two-year-old colts, and there was speculation as to which of the two was the <b>better.</b> <b>It</b> was also generally believed that La Fleche would have the Derby as her principal target for the following year.|$|E
5|$|Kom {{gives birth}} to twins and applies for a {{government}} job. However, she refuses {{the position of a}} police constable, feeling that as a world-champion boxer, she deserves <b>better.</b> <b>It</b> devastates her to learn that people no longer recognise her. Onler encourages her to restart her boxing training. She joins the gym again, leaving her husband to look after the twins at home. Her coach is still upset about her decision to marry, but Kom makes a comeback in the National Boxing Championship. Despite performing better than her opponent, she loses the match due to the apparent partiality of the judges. Kom throws a chair in anger towards them, resulting in a ban. She later writes an apology letter, and the official accepts it, but only after insulting her.|$|E

25|$|To {{understand}} this notion <b>better,</b> <b>it</b> helps {{to consider a}} relation as mapping every element x∈X to a set xR = { y∈Y | xRy }. This set is sometimes called the successor neighborhood of x in R; one can define the predecessor neighborhood analogously. Synonymous terms for these notions are afterset and respectively foreset.|$|E
25|$|The factors {{governing}} the word order within noun phrases are not known.

Where context, semantics, and the verbal suffixes fail to disambiguate, verb–noun–noun is understood to be VSO.|$|E

25|$|Carrying out a {{military}} plan in winter {{was not the}} major failure of the operation.

The IX and X Corps marched with maximum effectiveness given the conditions. The majority of the units managed to move to the correct positions. In respect to the inflicted Russian casualties, they should be credited.|$|E

As the tests on the Sea Beach line progressed, grade time stops were added to ensure safety on the line, and on the 42nd Street line. The train was dubbed SAM, and was to operate on Track 4 of the shuttle line.|$|E
25|$|That {{was the end}} as far as Schofield's brief {{relationship}} with an England cap was concerned. He returned to his county, and though he was picked for another A tour to the West Indies in 2000–01 things started to fall apart shortly afterwards. In 2001 he took only 14 wickets {{at an average of}} over 54, though 26 wickets at 18.53 in List A cricket were a compensation, and although his average of 18.38 in 2002 looked <b>better</b> <b>it</b> was deceptive: Schofield was bowled only 122 first-class overs in total that summer.|$|E

25|$|The {{foreign affairs}} {{initiatives}} of the Adams administration fared only slightly <b>better.</b> <b>It</b> did conclude reciprocal trading rights treaties with several nations, arranged to extend indefinitely a commercial convention with Britain and resolved outstanding questions regarding British {{seizure of property}} during the War of 1812. The administration was, however, prevented from resolving several ongoing trade issues, which only served to heighten tensions with Britain and negatively impacted U.S. trade. When Adams wished to send a delegation to the 1826 Congress of Panama, a gathering of the new republics of Latin America, his request for funding was blocked by Congress.|$|E
25|$|Radar systems must {{overcome}} unwanted signals {{in order to}} focus on the targets of interest. These unwanted signals may originate from internal and external sources, both passive and active. The ability of the radar system to overcome these unwanted signals defines its signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). SNR is defined as the ratio of the signal power to the noise power within the desired signal; it compares the level of a desired target signal to the level of background noise (atmospheric noise and noise generated within the receiver). The higher a system's SNR the <b>better</b> <b>it</b> is at discriminating actual targets from noise signals.|$|E
25|$|Transient (state) {{loneliness}} {{is temporary}} in nature, caused by {{something in the}} environment, and is easily relieved. Chronic (trait) loneliness is more permanent, caused by the person, and is not easily relieved. For example, {{when a person is}} sick and cannot socialize with friends would be a case of transient loneliness. Once the person got <b>better</b> <b>it</b> would be easy for them to alleviate their loneliness. A person who feels lonely regardless of if they are at a family gathering, with friends, or alone is experiencing chronic loneliness. It does not matter {{what goes on in the}} surrounding environment, the experience of loneliness is always there.|$|E

25|$|In mid-May 1940, Canadian and US {{officers}} watched {{comparative tests}} of a XP-40 and a Spitfire, at RCAF Uplands, Ottawa. While the Spitfire {{was considered to}} have performed <b>better,</b> <b>it</b> was not available for use in Canada and the P-40 was ordered to meet home air defense requirements. In all, eight Home War Establishment Squadrons were equipped with the Kittyhawk: 72 Kittyhawk I, 12 Kittyhawk Ia, 15 Kittyhawk III and 35 Kittyhawk IV aircraft, {{for a total of}} 134 aircraft. These aircraft were mostly diverted from RAF Lend-Lease orders for service in Canada. The P-40 Kittyhawks were obtained in lieu of 144 P-39 Airacobras originally allocated to Canada but reassigned to the RAF.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} in {{the characteristics of the}} nests within the Vespula vulgaris species. Aerial nests and nests that are very close {{to the surface of the}} ground have much thicker envelopes than those under the ground. Because heat is less well insulated above the ground, the wasps build thick envelopes to prevent heat from escaping. Also, smaller nests have thicker envelopes than larger nests. This is mainly due to the fact that the amount of heat produced is proportional to the volume of the nest. The larger a nest is the <b>better</b> <b>it</b> will be in conserving the nest warmth. The optimal temperature of the nest is around 32°C. However, when the temperature rises above the optimal temperature (during hot days), the workers use their wings as fans to cool the nest down.|$|E
25|$|The Samaritans {{interpret}} the deuteronomic commandment to mean displaying any select text from the Samaritan {{version of the}} five Books of Moses. This can contain a blessing or a particularly holy or uplifting message. In the past they placed a stone plaque inscribed with the Ten Commandments above the house door, some examples {{dating back to the}} Byzantine (4th-7th century) and Early Muslim (7th-11th century) periods being now shown in the Israel Museum in Jerusalem. Nowadays a Samaritan mezuzah is usually made of either marble, a wooden plate, or a sheet of parchment or high quality paper, on which they inscribe select verses from the Samaritan Torah. This they place either above the house door, or inside the house, in the entrance hall or at a prominent place on a large wall. These mezuzot are found in every Samaritan household {{as well as in the}} synagogue. Today some Samaritans would also use a Jewish-style mezuzah case and place inside it a small written Samaritan scroll, i.e. a text from the Samaritan Torah, written in the Samaritan alphabet. The more such mezuzot there are in the house, the <b>better</b> <b>it</b> is considered to be.|$|E

25|$|Plots of {{the four}} results above in the ROC space are given in the figure. The result of method A clearly shows the best {{predictive}} power among A, B, and C. The result of B lies on the random guess line (the diagonal line), {{and it can be}} seen in the table that the accuracy of B is 50%. However, when C is mirrored across the center point (0.5,0.5), the resulting method C′ is even better than A. This mirrored method simply reverses the predictions of whatever method or test produced the C contingency table. Although the original C method has negative predictive power, simply reversing its decisions leads to a new predictive method C′ which has positive predictive power. When the C method predicts p or n, the C′ method would predict n or p, respectively. In this manner, the C′ test would perform the best. The closer a result from a contingency table is to the upper left corner, the <b>better</b> <b>it</b> predicts, but the distance from the random guess line in either direction is the best indicator of how much predictive power a method has. If the result is below the line (i.e. the method is worse than a random guess), all of the method's predictions must be reversed in order to utilize its power, thereby moving the result above the random guess line.|$|E
