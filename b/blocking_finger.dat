2500|$|To {{achieve the}} {{required}} density LCC architects favoured tower blocks set in green space {{as can be}} seen in the neighbouring Silchester Estate, the Clifford Wearden & Associates architects propose a solution of densely packed low-rise apartments with landscaped greenspace. The [...] <b>finger</b> <b>block</b> was seen as a tower block laid on its side- instead of lifts and service shafts there was the internal walkway. [...] It was intended to keep the housing as compact as possible thus freeing up more green space in between. The units were of different sizes and slotted together like lego <b>blocks.</b> The <b>finger</b> <b>blocks</b> were built above garages on a deck, along the centre of the deck was a covered walkway, which provided the street in the sky. On either side of the street were flats and the stair columns that rose to the flats above. The flats themselves were grouped in blocks and projected, joining over the walkway. The <b>finger</b> <b>blocks</b> were very close to the annual disturbances in Notting Hill, and the walkways provided escape routes that the police were unable to control. In 1992, the <b>finger</b> <b>blocks</b> were refurbished and wall erected that segmented the walkways and required pass key access- destroying the original design concept and one of the <b>finger</b> <b>blocks</b> unique features.|$|R

The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the effect of digital block on SPa 02, lag time and height of plethysmographic wave of pulse oximeter by simulated shock in upper extrimity. &# 13; Methods. In an experimental study, 34 Paitents under general anesthesia and elective surgery were selected. Lag time and height of pletysmographic wave and SPa 02 had been measured in two fingers shocked by cooling, elevation of hand and inflation of cuff; then, compared to opposite middle finger as control. shocked Middle <b>finger</b> were <b>blocked</b> by lidocaine 2 % and these parameters were measured in the 15 th and 20 th minutes after digital block.

Examination revealed a stepladder deformity. Neurovascular examination was normal. Radiographs revealed dorsal dislocation of both the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints. The finger was reduced easily by longitudinal manual traction under the digital <b>block.</b> The <b>finger</b> was splinted in the intrinsic plus position for 3 weeks accompanied with active range of motion. After 6 months, the patient returned to normal sporting activity without limitation of motion.

40|$|Background: Finger {{injuries}} {{are a common}} chief complaint in the emergency department (ED) and primary care setting. Repair of these injuries often require digital anesthesia through performing a digital nerve block (DNB). The two-injection subcutaneous volar block (SVB) and a two-injection dorsal digital block (DDB) {{are two of the}} most prevalently performed digital blocks in practice today. This systematic review examines which DNB technique is most appropriate and attempts to offer a recommendation for a standardized level of care. Methods: An extensive literature search was performed using Medline-OVID, Medline-PubMed, CINAHL, and Google Scholar. The following keywords were searched individually and in combination: digital anesthesia, digital <b>block,</b> and <b>finger</b> <b>block.</b> Inclusion criteria consisted of trials comparing the SVB and the DDB from 2007 to present. All articles were assessed for quality using GRADE. Results: The search resulted in 114 articles that were narrowed down to 32 by limiting articles to human studies written in English and published after 2007. The abstracts and titles were then hand searched for trials comparing the SVB and the DDB. Final articles meeting all inclusion criteria were three studies, two RCTs and one quasi-experimental. The primary outcome of successful anesthesia was measured and the quasi-experimental showed the SVB being more effective than the DDB and the two RCTs provided data with {{no significant difference between the}} two digital blocks. A secondary outcome of the patients’ pain score of the injection was also measured by two of the studies and no statistical significance was found. Conclusion: The SVB is equally effective in delivering anesthesia as the DDB but is only a single injection making it less invasive, easier to perform and teach, and avoids the risk of damaging the finger nerves. For these reasons a safe recommendation come be made for the use of the SVB when repairing a finger injury that is not located on the dorsal aspect of the proximal phalanx in which case is the only clinical scenario that the DDB should be utilized...|$|R

40|$|Patients with lesions of {{the left}} {{posterior}} parietal cortex commonly fail in identifying their fingers, a condition known as finger agnosia, yet are relatively unimpaired in sensation and skilled action. Such dissociations have traditionally been interpreted as evidence that structural body representations (BSR), such as the body structural description, are distinct from sensorimotor representations, such as the body schema. We investigated whether performance on tasks commonly used to assess finger agnosia is modulated by changes in hand posture. We used the ‘in between’ test in which participants estimate the number of unstimulated fingers between two touched fingers or a localization task in which participants judge which two fingers were stimulated. Across <b>blocks,</b> the <b>fingers</b> were placed in three levels of splay. Judged finger numerosity was analysed, in Exp. 1 by direct report and in Exp. 2 as {{the actual number of}} fingers between the fingers named. In both experiments, judgments were greater when non-adjacent stimulated fingers were positioned far apart compared to when they were close together or touching, whereas judgements were unaltered when adjacent fingers were stimulated.

(2) The elimination of the 2 injection <b>finger</b> <b>block</b> technique in favor of the single injection palmar block.
