The Reflective Judgment Interview (RJI) was conducted with 15 college freshmen enrolled in a composition course that focused on persuasive writing. Participants ’ essays were examined for patterns in position-taking, evidence-usage, treatment of objections, and rhetorical strategies. Essays were examined “blind ” to participants ’ reflective judgment scores, and then analyses were compared across reflective judgment groupings.

Based on assessments made by independent raters, four participants were described as using predominantly pre-reflective judgment, and eleven were described as using predominantly quasi-reflective judgment.

40|$|This work {{describes}} how genetic programming {{is applied to}} evolving controllers for the minimum time swing up and inverted balance tasks of the continuous state and action: limited torque acrobot. The best swing-up controller is able to swing the acrobot up to a position {{very close to the}} inverted ‘handstand’ position in a very short time, shorter than that of Coulom (2004), who applied the same constraints on the applied torque values, and to take only slightly longer than the approach by Lai et al.

The best balance controller is able to balance the acrobot in the inverted position when starting from the <b>balance</b> <b>position</b> for the length of time used in the fitness function in all runs; furthermore, 47 out of 50 of the runs evolve controllers able to maintain the <b>balance</b> <b>position</b> for an extended period, an improvement on the balance controllers generated by Dracopoulos and Nichols (2012), which this paper is extended from.

30|$|It {{is found}} that that the {{direction}} of vibration is along the z direction. The vibration <b>balance</b> <b>position</b> is below the horizontal plane of planar elastic tube bundle subjected to the earth gravity. The red arrow represents the instantaneous vibration direction. At the time of τ/ 4 and 3 τ/ 4, the planar elastic tube bundle reaches the position of peak and valley, respectively. For the velocity 0.2  m/s, the planar elastic tube bundle is still below the horizontal plane at the position of peak. While the planar elastic tube bundle is almost over the horizontal plane at the position of peak in the velocity 0.5  m/s. The reason behind {{this is that the}} fluid force generated by increasing velocity overcomes the effect of earth gravity. It means that the vibration <b>balance</b> <b>position</b> will be raised because of the increasing fluid force.|$|R

Then, based on these models, the impacts of (1) an appreciation of the US dollar against the EURO and (2) an increase in the volatility of the US dollar / EURO rate are derived. Our results indicate that an appreciation of the US dollar /EURO rate or an increase in the volatility of this rate leads to a lower real GDP growth rate and worsening of the trade <b>balance</b> <b>positions</b> for Egypt and Jordan and the opposite for Morocco...|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{investigate}} whether adolescent baseball pitchers change lower extremity kinematic and temporal parameters during a simulated game, which may affect performance outcomes. Method: Twelve male adolescent pitchers (14 – 16 years) threw 90 pitches (6 sets of 15 pitches) from an artificial mound towards a pitching net. Angular displacements, angular velocities and temporal parameters at the hip, knee and ankle of the trailing and leading legs were collected throughout the pitching cycle. Dependent variables were analysed from the <b>balance</b> <b>position</b> through to maximal internal {{rotation of the}} shoulder. Performance outcomes of ball velocity and pitching accuracy were also recorded. The last five pitches of the second and final sets were compared to determine whether changes in the pitching mechanics and performance outcomes had occurred {{by the end of}} the simulated game. Results: Pitchers assumed a less upright posture and the leading leg was not raised as high at the <b>balance</b> <b>position</b> in the final set. Throughout stride phase, pitchers decreased maximal hip extension and ankle plantarflexion displacements in the trailing leg. Additional decreases in the maximal angular velocities for hip abduction and knee extension were seen throughout the stride phase in the final set. Foot contact occurred earlier in the final set, resulting in decreased hip flexion and increased hip abduction in the leading leg. No kinematic differences were observed between sets at ball release. Ball velocity and pitching accuracy decreased in the final set. Conclusion: Kinematic differences in the lower extremities suggest that lower extremity musculature may have been affected by fatigue {{by the end of the}} simulated game. Consequently, pitchers may have produced less forward momentum during the final set of pitches, which could have contributed to the decreased ball velocity. The altered <b>balance</b> <b>position</b> seems to be the underlying factor for the subsequent changes in the lower extremity pitching mechanics. Therefore, the leading leg hip flexors and the trailing leg hip and knee extensors may require strengthening to maintain the <b>balance</b> <b>position.</b> Additional strengthening of the ankle plantarflexors would assist the hip and knee in producing consistent propulsive forces during the stride phase throughout a game...|$|R
