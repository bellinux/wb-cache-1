25|$|During this election, {{political}} parties used technology in {{innovative ways to}} reach out to the voters. Although SMS had been used during prior elections, {{political parties}} had realised that the rural and illiterate voters which form a majority couldn't read. Young and technology savvy politicians quickly realised that voice was the way {{to reach out to}} the rural community as they could speak their language. This turned out to <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>interesting</b> as two voice companies from India, TringMe and VoiceHawk played the pivotal role in reaching out to the billion people of India.|$|E

The politics of it are what gives it its dimension and momentum, and of course I was interested in the politics. Why wouldn't I be?" ...|$|E
500|$|O'Malley was {{characterized}} a [...] "hapless naif". On {{the topic of}} O'Malley's longtime crush on Meredith in the second season, Knight said: [...] "What's going to <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>interesting</b> to see is what he's {{going to do with}} Meredith. It's getting close to time. Whatever he chooses to do will inform who he is the rest of his life." [...] After their sexual encounter occurred onscreen, Knight {{said in an interview with}} Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune: [...] "George wasn't really paying full attention. He was letting his own feelings override his respect for Meredith. A person really clued in would get that there wasn't anything coming back, but he was so in his head about it and caught up in his own feelings that he wasn't listening. It's not just that he loves her...it's a kind of selfish love he had for her." [...] He also added that, [...] "I think George has a lot of growing up to do. Part of that is making horrible, stupid mistakes. He's been pretty sheltered." ...|$|E

500|$|At the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, Spears said to MTV News {{that she}} had thought of a [...] "really cool concept for the video, just to make it interesting. You'll have to see." [...] She then {{contacted}} Chris Marrs Piliero, who directed the music video for her previous single [...] "I Wanna Go", to work with her. She told him the basic story she had planned, which he described as a [...] "fairy-tale, sweet, knight-in-shining-armor feel to it. I said let's take that and make the fairy tale badass." [...] Spears also wanted her real-life boyfriend Jason Trawick to play the criminal. Marrs Piliero was initially hesitant to cast Trawick feeling that a professional actor would do a better job, but did not talk to Spears about it. He told USA Today, [...] "When you're doing nudity, I don't think {{it was at the}} top of Britney's list to bring in some random guy while her boyfriend watches. [...] We definitely wanted to make some passionate, steamy scenes, but we also wanted it to be intensely beautiful. We didn't want to go for raunchy. We wanted it to be sensual and steamy." [...] On September 6, 2011, Spears announced through her Twitter account {{that she had}} decided to shoot the video [...] "in the streets of merry old England when I get there." [...] In an interview with AOL, she explained, [...] "I've never shot on location out of the country of America for a video. So, it should <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>interesting.</b> It was partly my idea ... to see if it could to happen, and they were like, 'Yeah, it's a great idea,' so we did it." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the time}} the first {{meteorite}} from the Moon was discovered in 1982, there was speculation that some other unusual meteorites that had been found previously originated from Mars. [...] The positive identification of lunar meteorites on Earth supported the hypothesis that meteoroid impacts on Mars could eject rocks from that planet. There are also speculations {{about the possibility of}} finding [...] "Earth meteorites" [...] {{on the surface of the}} Moon. This would <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>interesting</b> because in this case stones from Earth older than 3.9 billion years, which are destroyed on Earth by various geological processes, may have survived on the Moon. Thus some scientists propose new missions to the Moon to search for ancient rocks from Earth.|$|E
2500|$|The BBC World Service {{began in}} 1932 as the BBC Empire Service, {{broadcasting}} on shortwave and aimed principally at English speakers across the British Empire. In his first Christmas Message, King George V {{stated that the}} service was intended for [...] "men and women, so cut off by the snow, the desert, or the sea, that only voices {{out of the air}} can reach them." [...] First hopes for the Empire Service were low. The Director General, Sir John Reith (later Lord Reith) said in the opening programme: [...] "Don't expect too much in the early days; for some time we shall transmit comparatively simple programmes, to give the best chance of intelligible reception and provide evidence as to the type of material most suitable for the service in each zone. The programmes will neither <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>interesting</b> nor very good." [...] This address was read out five times as it was broadcast live to different parts of the world.|$|E
