5|$|Art {{direction}} for the album is credited to Frank Olinsky, Billy Corgan, and Corgan's then-girlfriend and frequent collaborator Yelena Yemchuk. The artwork for the album and its singles consisted almost entirely of <b>black-and-white</b> <b>photographs</b> shot by Yemchuk, many of which featured model Amy Wesson.|$|E
5|$|Documentary {{photography}} {{has also}} flourished outside the press. As an example, Jette Bang (1914–1964) {{was fascinated by}} Greenland and the Greenlanders. From 1936, she took over 12,000 <b>black-and-white</b> <b>photographs</b> {{of the country and}} its inhabitants, showing how close to nature people lived.|$|E
5|$|Kirsten Klein (born 1945) studied {{portrait}} {{and museum}} photography before specializing in landscapes. Her <b>black-and-white</b> <b>photographs</b> often {{make use of}} older techniques such as cyanotype and platinum printing. Concentrating on landscapes, she conveys a sensitive, poetic and often melancholic mood. Since 1976, she has lived on the Danish island of Mors where she has photographed the ever-changing countryside and coastline.|$|E

While the document does not provide an illustration of the original design, <b>black-and-white</b> <b>photographs</b> taken at this historic event provide images of the first Bhutanese flag at the ceremony.|$|E
5|$|They {{were also}} popular for their {{personal}} appearances in television {{shows such as}} Bob Hope Christmas Specials. Mansfield and Hargitay {{had a number of}} business holdings, including the Hargitay Exercise Equipment Company, Jayne Mansfield Productions, and Eastland Savings and Loan. She co-wrote the autobiographical book Jayne Mansfield's Wild, Wild World with Hargitay. The book also contained 32 pages of <b>black-and-white</b> <b>photographs</b> from the film on glossy paper.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, the Swiss {{publisher}} Urs Graf Verlag Bern {{produced the}} first facsimile of the Book of Kells. The {{majority of the}} pages were reproduced in <b>black-and-white</b> <b>photographs,</b> but the edition also featured forty-eight colour reproductions, including all the full-page decorations. Under licence from the Board of Trinity College Dublin, Thames and Hudson produced a second facsimile edition in 1974. This edition included all the full-page illustrations in the manuscript and a representative section of the ornamentation of the text pages, together with some enlarged details of the illustrations. The reproductions were all in full colour, with photography by John Kennedy, Green Studio, Dublin.|$|E

5|$|Maxwell {{was also}} {{interested}} in applying his theory of colour perception, namely in colour photography. Stemming directly from his psychological work on colour perception: if a sum of any three lights could reproduce any perceivable colour, then colour photographs could be produced {{with a set of}} three coloured filters. In the course of his 1855 paper, Maxwell proposed that, if three <b>black-and-white</b> <b>photographs</b> of a scene were taken through red, green and blue filters and transparent prints of the images were projected onto a screen using three projectors equipped with similar filters, when superimposed on the screen the result would be perceived by the human eye as a complete reproduction of all the colours in the scene.|$|E
5|$|The {{photographs}} {{taken during the}} Klondike gold rush heavily influenced later cultural approaches to the stampede. The gold rush was vividly recorded by several early photographers, for instance Eric Hegg; these stark, <b>black-and-white</b> <b>photographs</b> showing the ascent of the Chilkoot pass rapidly became iconic images and were widely distributed. These pictures in turn inspired Charlie Chaplin to make The Gold Rush, a silent movie, which uses {{the background of the}} Klondike to combine physical comedy with its character's desperate battle for survival in the harsh conditions of the stampede. The photographs reappear in the documentary City of Gold from 1957 which, narrated by Pierre Berton, won prizes for pioneering the incorporation of still images into documentary film-making. The Klondike gold rush, however, has not been widely covered in later fictional films; even The Far Country, a Western from 1955 set in the Klondike, largely ignores the unique features of the gold rush in favour of a traditional Western plot. Indeed, much of the popular literature on the gold rush approaches the stampede simply as a final phase of the expansion of the American West, a perception critiqued by modern historians such as Charlene Porsild.|$|E
5|$|Arkham Citys {{marketing}} campaign {{was designed to}} reach an audience outside of superhero fans and appeal to consumers who are attracted to games like the first-person shooter series Call of Duty. Warner Bros.'s marketing team decided that Batman's status as a cultural icon and superhero was unavoidable, {{so they decided to}} emphasize other elements of the character that could appeal to fans of first-person shooters and action games. <b>Black-and-white</b> <b>photographs</b> of iconic personalities like inventor Steve Jobs and actor James Dean served as inspiration and a basis for the final {{marketing campaign}} used in advertisements and the game's cover art. The imagery, highlighted with blood and bathed in light was considered {{to move away from the}} classic superhero image and refocus on Batman's humanity. The black and white campaign was featured on 120 magazine covers and was targeted towards approximately 15 million consumers across a variety of social media and Warner Bros. products, in addition to a series of viral marketing videos and stunts involving actors in costume attending press-related events. By April 2012, three gameplay trailers had gained approximately 6 million views. The viral segment of the campaign involved several audio recordings between characters from the game including Hugo Strange, Quincy Sharp, Riddler, and the Penguin; each recording could be found by solving a puzzle. The entire campaign spent more than a year in development, producing artwork, videos, DLC, printed advertisements, billboards, and events, and was estimated to have cost at least $10 million.|$|E

25|$|Milton Denman Van Dyke (August 1, 1922 – May 10, 2010) was Professor of the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics at Stanford University. He {{was known}} for his work in fluid dynamics, {{especially}} with respect to the use of perturbation analysis in aerodynamics. His often-cited book An Album of Fluid Motion presents a collection of about 400 selected <b>black-and-white</b> <b>photographs</b> of flow visualization in experiments, received – on his request – from researchers all over the world.|$|E
25|$|Smith then {{secured a}} {{contract}} to replace supermodel Claudia Schiffer in a Guess jeans ad campaign featuring a series of sultry <b>black-and-white</b> <b>photographs.</b> During the Guess campaign Smith changed her name to Anna Nicole Smith. Guess photographers noticed Smith bore {{a striking resemblance to}} bombshell Jayne Mansfield and showcased her in several Mansfield-inspired photo sessions. In 1993 before Christmas, she modeled for the Swedish clothing company H. This led to her being pictured on large billboards in Sweden and Norway.|$|E
50|$|One of Lavine's most {{well known}} {{photographs}} is the {{cover for the}} CD Life After Death by The Notorious B.I.G., which was released fifteen days after Biggie's murder. The <b>black-and-white</b> <b>photograph</b> features Wallace (Biggie) standing alongside a black funeral hearse. In hindsight many saw this as portending his death. In another <b>black-and-white</b> <b>photograph</b> from the same shoot, Wallace is {{standing in front of}} row after row of headstones in a graveyard.|$|R

25|$|While {{he was in}} the Northern part of Australia Wongar {{worked on}} his Totem and Ore {{photographic}} collection known also under the title Boomerang and Atom. The collection contained several thousand <b>black-and-white</b> <b>photographs</b> portraying the impact of uranium mining and the British nuclear testing on tribal Aborigines. In 1974 Wongar was asked to send some of the Totem and Ore photographs for an exhibition in the Parliament House Library in Canberra. The exhibition was banned by order of the Australian parliament only a few hours after the official opening.|$|E
25|$|For killer whales, {{researchers}} arbitrarily {{chose the}} left side of the animal as the one to be used for identification. Bigg's team of killer whale photographers and spotters quickly grew to include hundreds of volunteers from along the coast, a project that was eventually formalized in 1999 as the B.C. Cetacean Sightings Network. In 1975, researchers examining thousands of <b>black-and-white</b> <b>photographs</b> began to assemble a catalog containing a photograph of every killer whale in British Columbia's waters, a catalog that has been continually updated and used to this day.|$|E
25|$|Kiarostami {{produced}} 10 on Ten (2004), {{a journal}} documentary that shares ten lessons on movie-making while he drives through {{the locations of}} his past films. The movie is shot on digital video with a stationary camera mounted inside the car, in a manner reminiscent of Taste of Cherry and Ten. In 2005 and 2006, he directed The Roads of Kiarostami, a 32-minute documentary that reflects {{on the power of}} landscape, combining austere <b>black-and-white</b> <b>photographs</b> with poetic observations, engaging music with political subject matter. Also in 2005, Kiarostami contributed the central section to Tickets, a portmanteau film set on a train traveling through Italy. The other segments were directed by Ken Loach and Ermanno Olmi.|$|E

25|$|The first {{permanent}} color {{photograph was}} taken in 1861 using the three-color-separation principle first published by Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell in 1855. The foundation of virtually all practical color processes, Maxwell's idea was to take three separate <b>black-and-white</b> <b>photographs</b> through red, green and blue filters. This provides the photographer with the three basic channels required to recreate a color image. Transparent prints of the images could be projected through similar color filters and superimposed on the projection screen, an additive method of color reproduction. A color print on paper could be produced by superimposing carbon prints of the three images made in their complementary colors, a subtractive method of color reproduction pioneered by Louis Ducos du Hauron in the late 1860s.|$|E
25|$|Construction of Olympic began {{three months}} before Titanic to ease {{pressures}} on the shipyard. Several years would pass before Britannic would be launched. In order to accommodate {{the construction of the}} class, Harland and Wolff upgraded their facility in Belfast; the most dramatic change was the combining of three slipways into two larger ones. Olympic and Titanic were constructed side by side. Olympics keel was laid on 16 December 1908 and she was launched on 20 October 1910, without having been christened beforehand. For her launch, the hull was painted in a light grey colour for photographic purposes; a common practice of the day for the first ship in a new class, as it made the lines of the ship clearer in the <b>black-and-white</b> <b>photographs.</b> Her hull was repainted black following the launch.|$|E
25|$|In 1973, Morton Smith {{published}} a book on a previously unknown letter of Clement of Alexandria. He stated that, while cataloging documents at the ancient Greek Orthodox monastery of Mar Saba {{in the summer of}} 1958, he discovered the text of the letter handwritten into the endpapers of Isaac Vossius' 1646 printed edition of the works of Ignatius of Antioch. It presented a letter of Clement of Alexandria to one Theodore, whom he seeks to warn against a Gospel of Mark falsified by the gnostic sect of Carpocratians. Clement concedes that it gives a 'more spiritual' version of Mark and quotes from it. This letter is consequently referred to as the Mar Saba letter. In his book, Smith {{published a}} set of <b>black-and-white</b> <b>photographs</b> of the text. He published a second book for the popular audience in 1974.|$|E
