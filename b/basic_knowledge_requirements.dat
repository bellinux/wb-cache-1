40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 115 - 125) Training in {{a corporate}} environment requires excellent communication skills {{for the successful}} execution of training techniques. The purpose {{of the project was}} to determine the <b>basic</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>requirements</b> of an entry-level corporate trainer, apply them by developing a ???Train-the-Trainer??? seminar, and integrate knowledge of training with communication skills to conduct the seminar for graduate students. As reflected in current literature produced by practioners in the field of human resource development an understanding of adult learning, training design, and training methods is necessary to develop instruction. Coupled with this, knowledge of research techniques and practices, as they pertain to training needs analysis and evaluation of training is critical. Although there are some established norms and styles relating to the facilitation of classroom-based training programs, much of the skills require effective use of listening and oral presentation skills. To function in a corporate training department, an understanding of corporate training roles and administrative practices is helpful...|$|E
40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} definition of stress management education. The major purposes {{of the study were}} to: (1) create an instrument which could be used to define the <b>basic</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>requirements</b> for individuals providing stress management education; and, (2) to administer the instrument (Validation Study for the Blueprint of Knowledge for Stress Management Education) to a body of established professionals who currently represent the substantive areas of the field and who possess the academic, clinical, or educational credentials and experiences to give credibility to the study and to the field. ^ The instrument was developed with the input of over 700 professionals from the United States and 26 foreign countries who are recognized for their educational, clinical and/or research work in stress management. These experts included psychologists; physiologists; physicians; nurses; social workers; elementary, secondary and post-secondary educators; researchers; corporate trainers; noted authors of stress management resources and biofeedback therapists who provide educational training in stress management. The resulting instrument was a 200 -item assimilation of what had been identified as the minimum knowledge needed for individuals providing stress management education. ^ This instrument was mailed to a representative sample of recognized professionals in Stress Management Education in the United States and Canada. The questionnaire contained items grouped under three major domain areas: (1) Basic Concepts in Stress Management; (2) Strategies for Enhancing Stress Management Skills; and (3) Application of Learning Theory, Measurements and Ethics in Stress Management. Respondents were asked to rate each item on a five-point scale according to the importance of each item for the entry-level stress management educator. ^ As a result of the study, three items which did not meet the minimum criteria for inclusion were eliminated from the knowledge base. No significant differences were found among respondents 2 ̆ 7 ratings based on gender or level of education. A significant difference was found in how respondents rated the sub-scales of Measurement and Experimental Research based on profession. ...|$|E

To explore the reproducibility of prior work, here we present {{results from a}} three-laboratory study, the objectives of which were to determine the mean and variability in test endpoints (i. e., adult fecundity, egg hatchability, and juvenile growth) under baseline conditions and to identify the sources of variability. A major source of variability {{for all of the}} measured endpoints was due to differences within and among individuals. With few exceptions, variability among laboratories and among replicate tanks within laboratories contributed little to the observed variability in endpoints. The results highlight the importance of obtaining <b>basic</b> <b>knowledge</b> of husbandry <b>requirements</b> and baseline information on life-history traits of potential test species prior to designing toxicity test protocols. Understanding of the levels and sources of endpoint variability is essential so that statistically robust and ecologically relevant tests of chemicals can be conducted...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Single {{nucleotide}} polymorphism (SNP) genotyping {{is a major}} {{activity in}} biomedical research. Scientists prefer to have a facile access to the results which may require conversions between data formats. First hand SNP data is often entered in or saved in the MS-Excel format, but this software lacks genetic and epidemiological related functions. A general tool to do basic genetic and epidemiological analysis and data conversion for MS-Excel is needed. Findings The SNP_tools package is prepared as an add-in for MS-Excel. The code is written in Visual Basic for Application, embedded in the Microsoft Office package. This add-in is an easy to use tool for users with <b>basic</b> computer <b>knowledge</b> (and <b>requirements</b> for <b>basic</b> statistical analysis).

40|$|Distinguished Alumni Award Program author. VADM Harvey E. Johnson, Jr., USCG (Ret) (Presented 11 May 06) Recognizing {{that earlier}} this year the Coast Guard's level of {{awareness}} was elevated with regard to deficiencies in the <b>basic</b> skill and <b>knowledge</b> <b>requirements,</b> {{the purpose of this}} thesis is to identify the recruiting program, from among the many alternatives, as having the greatest potential for effectively evaluating and controlling the quality dimension. This thesis will explore the concept of recruiting effectiveness as it can be defined in terms of quantity AND quality within the Coast Guard recruiting program. The Coast Guard recruiting program has generated considerable expertise and efficiency at operating within the quantity dimension. Therefore, this thesis will focus attention upon the quality dimension as it relates to, and can be manipulated by, the recruiting organization. The specific elements of the recruiting program having potential to impact effectiveness through quality will be identified and evaluated in light of current research. Recommendations concerning those elements and their usefulness in the evaluation and control of the quality and quantity dimensions will be offered with the intention of improving the Coast Guard's responsiveness to evolving quality demands.

40|$|This thesis poses three {{questions}} about the Swedish national <b>knowledge</b> <b>requirements,</b> which {{have been in place}} in Swedish schools since 1994 : How do teachers understand them? How do members of parliament understand them? How useful are they as teaching assessment tools? Edmund Husserl's concept of intentionality provides a perspective on these <b>knowledge</b> <b>requirements</b> as meaningful phenomena. Martin Heidegger's conceptual framework highlights usefulness as a statutory prerequisite {{to be able to see}} the <b>knowledge</b> <b>requirements</b> as a tool for assessment and national governance. The empirical material for the three parts of the thesis come from conversations with thirteen teachers who award grades, a review of 197 parliamentary bills from 1990 to 2010 and a review of the <b>knowledge</b> <b>requirements</b> for the subject of Swedish in primary and secondary school curricula from the years 1994, 2000 and 2011. The study's first results section shows that teachers understand the national <b>knowledge</b> <b>requirements</b> as corresponding to either qualitative or quantitative differences in the level of knowledge, or as a combination of the two. These different interpretations entail different ways of using the <b>knowledge</b> <b>requirements</b> in different assessment situations. The second results section shows that members of parliament have very high hopes for what the <b>knowledge</b> <b>requirements</b> will accomplish in Swedish schools. The results of the study in Part Three demonstrate that the national <b>knowledge</b> <b>requirements</b> are so vague that their usefulness is questionable...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{awareness}} among upper secondary students, and <b>knowledge</b> <b>requirements</b> for two different subjects in a Swedish school. In the Swedish school system, Swedish students’ are tested against specified <b>knowledge</b> <b>requirements,</b> which are correlated to the grades. I wanted to study if there was any difference between how <b>knowledge</b> <b>requirements</b> are being used in the subjects of Swedish in correlation to Mathematics, and if the students experienced and perceived that their awareness about the <b>knowledge</b> <b>requirements</b> may have an impact on their grade. The study is a quantitative investigation, among upper secondary students in the second and third year, in an academic preparatory upper secondary school. Most of the students were about 18 – 19 years old, when the material was gathered. The result of the study shows that the teachers who are teaching Swedish are more prone to assess the <b>knowledge</b> <b>requirements</b> to their students compared to those that teach Mathematics. The study shows that this fact does not produce any discrepancy among the students. The students do not experience that knowledge and understanding of the <b>knowledge</b> <b>requirements</b> influence their grade in a positive way...|$|R
40|$|Pluripotent {{stem cells}} have the {{capacity}} to self renew and to differentiate to cells of the three somatic germ layers that comprise an organism. Embryonic stem cells are the most studied pluripotent stem cells. Pluripotent stem cells have also been derived from adult tissues. Both embryonic and adult stem cells represent valuable sources of cells for applications in cell therapy, drug screening and tissue engineering. While expanding stem cells in culture, it is critical to maintain their self-renewal and differentiation capacity. In generating particular cell types for specific applications, it is important to direct their differentiation to the desired lineage. Challenges in expansion of undifferentiated stem cells for clinical applications include the removal of feeder layers and non-defined components in the culture medium. Our limited <b>basic</b> <b>knowledge</b> on the <b>requirements</b> for maintaining pluripotency of adult pluripotent stem cells and the lack of appropriate markers associated with pluripotency hinders the progress toward their wide spread application. In vitro differentiation of stem cells usually produces a mixed population of different cell lineages with the desired cell type present only at a small proportion. Use of growth factors that promote differentiation, expansion or survival of specific cell types is key in controlling the differentiation towards specific cell lineages. A variety of bioreactors for cell cultivation exist and can be readily adapted for stem cell cultivation and differentiation. They provide a well-controlled environment for studying the process of stem cell propagation and differentiation. Their wide use will facilitate the development of processes for stem cell application. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to explore how {{teachers}} at Swedish upper secondary schools perceive the so-called value words and <b>knowledge</b> <b>requirements</b> of religious studies 1 as defined by the present curriculum for upper secondary school 2011 (Gy 11) how they consider themselves to apply these value words in their teaching, and whether they consider the <b>knowledge</b> <b>requirements</b> as alegitimate basis for equivalentassessment. My studyis based oninterviewswithfour teachers in religious studies at four different upper swcondary schools in the municipalityof Jönköping, Sweden. The results of my study show that the interviewed teachers perceive the value words in the <b>knowledge</b> <b>requirements</b> of religious studies 1,as defined by the present curriculum Gy 11, aredifficult to interpret and that the value wordsare not definitive, but interpretable. All teachers use the <b>knowledge</b> <b>requirements</b> in theirplanning of teaching,but also in teaching where they are to concretize the <b>knowledge</b> <b>requirements</b> and value wordsthrough their own examples. Half of the teachers, however, experienced a lack of interest in the <b>knowledge</b> <b>requirements</b> by the pupils, which make it even more important to discuss knowledge requirementswith them, while the teachers’assessment has to rely on these <b>knowledge</b> <b>requirements.</b> All teachers apply the knowledge requirementsin their assessments, but three of the interviewees perceive the knowledge requirementsas unfavorable or unfair, since the knowledgerequirements and the present curriculum, Gy 11 expressa view of knowledge,whichaccording to several teachers,emphasizes qualitative rather than quantitative aspects. The <b>knowledge</b> <b>requirements</b> are considered as a basis for equivalentassessment to some degree, but full equivalence is not possible since the guiding documents can always be interpreted in multiple ways by the teachers. More importantly, the interviewed teachersin this study emphasized the importance oftime to discuss knowledgerequirements and assessment with colleagues, which could increase the chances of more equivalence.

The program is designed for non-expert user in order to help them composing gamelan music or analyzing their composition to achieve explanation and recommendation of ideal composition. There are 2 essential components in this method, which are knowledge and inference. Knowledge is represented into <b>basic</b> <b>knowledge</b> and melodic <b>knowledge.</b> <b>Basic</b> <b>knowledge</b> contains rules that control the structure of gamelan song, and melodic knowledge supports system in composing or analyzing notations sequence that fit the characteristics of melody in gamelan music. <b>Basic</b> <b>knowledge</b> represents <b>basic</b> rules of gamelan music that have quantitative value, so deterministic approach is used for <b>basic</b> <b>knowledge</b> acquisition. Melodic knowledge consists of dynamic data, so stochastic approach is used to create the melodic knowledge base. The rules of composing and analyzing a composition are defined based on <b>basic</b> <b>knowledge</b> and melodic knowledge. The inference engine is designed to compose and analyze a composition.
