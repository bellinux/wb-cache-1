There is not much research done in both fields, especially in the <b>bouncing</b> <b>mechanism.</b> In fact to the best of authors’ knowledge no of research has been done on integrating both mechanism to produce a spherical system that is capable of rolling and bouncing, which can produce a very significant mobile robot. Therefore, this research deals with the modeling and development of a bouncing spherical robot using computational intelligent technique, i. e. Particle Swarm Optimization technique (PSO). A 3 D virtual prototype of a spherical robot was developed in Visual Nastran as a platform for input and out data acquisition. Different simulations environment have been created, such as the free fall bouncing, shooting up and projectile type of environment to investigate the bouncing profile affected by different forces. The data obtained were then used for system identification using PSO technique with mean square error (MSE) of 0. 0004 %. The transfer function representing the <b>bouncing</b> <b>mechanism</b> of the sphere robot was then obtained. Next, the prototype of the sphere robot with bouncing capability was developed.

40|$|The double bounce {{effect of}} {{buildings}} {{is an important}} characteristic in very high resolution (VHR) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. It typically appears as a strong scattering mechanism caused by a corner reflector, which is made of the front wall of a building and its surrounding ground area. In order to exploit this feature effectively for automatic building detection and reconstruction techniques, empirical studies on real VHR SAR images need to investigate {{the stability of the}} double <b>bounce</b> <b>mechanism</b> with respect to changes in the viewing configuration and material properties. Thus, this paper addresses the analysis of the relation between the double bounce effect and the aspect angle of a building for two different ground materials, by analyzing two TerraSAR-X VHR spaceborne SAR images. Furthermore, we compare the empirical results with the simulations obtained by theoretical electromagnetic models. We show that if the buildings are surrounded by asphalt, the strength of the double bounce decreases significantly from 0 to 10 degrees aspect angle, while it decreases moderately for higher values of the aspect angle. Considering buildings which are surrounded by grass, the drop of the strength for low values of the aspect angle is less evident, but it is more constant on the full range of aspect angles. JRC.

The present study is intended to analyse how the ratio between positive and negative work modifies the <b>bouncing</b> <b>mechanism</b> of running. Our goals are (i) to identify the changes in motion of the centre of mass of the body associated with {{the slope of the}} terrain and the speed of progression, (ii) to study the effect of these changes on the storage and release of elastic energy during contact and (iii) to propose a model that predicts the change in the <b>bouncing</b> <b>mechanism</b> with slope and speed. Therefore, the ground reaction forces were measured on ten subjects running on an instrumented treadmill at different slopes (from − 9 ° to + 9 °) and different speeds (between 2. 2 and 5. 6 m s− 1). The movements of the centre of mass of the body and its external mechanical energy were then evaluated. Our results suggest that the increase in the muscular power is contained (1) on a positive slope: by decreasing the step period and the downward movements of the body, and by increasing the duration of the push, and (2) on a negative slope: by increasing the step period and the duration of the brake, and by decreasing the upward movement of the body.

40|$|The <b>bouncing</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{of human}} running is {{characterized}} by a shorter duration of the brake after ‘landing’ compared with a longer duration of the push before ‘takeoff’. This landing–takeoff asymmetry has been thought to be a consequence of the force–velocity relation of the muscle, resulting in a greater force exerted during stretching after landing and a lower force developed during shortening before takeoff. However, the asymmetric lever system of the human foot during stance may also be the cause. Here, we measure the landing–takeoff asymmetry in bouncing steps of running, hopping and trotting animals using diverse lever systems. We find that the duration of the push exceeds that of the brake in all the animals, indicating that the different lever systems comply with the basic property of muscle to resist stretching with a force greater than that developed during shortening. In addition, results show both the landing–takeoff asymmetry and the mass-specific vertical stiffness to be greater in small animals than in large animals. We suggest that the landing–takeoff asymmetry is an index of a lack of elasticity, which increases with increasing the role of muscle relative to that of tendon within muscle–tendon units...|$|R

Bouncing requires efficient conversion of initial kinetic energy into surface energy and back into kinetic energy. This process {{is believed to be}} limited to non-wetting, in particular superhydrophobic surfaces, for which viscous dissipation during drop-substrate contact is minimal. Here, we report a novel <b>bouncing</b> <b>mechanism</b> that applies equally to non-wetting and wetting systems for flat surfaces with contact angles down to 10 degrees. For initial impact speeds up to about 0. 5 m/s we demonstrate using dual wavelength interferometry that aqueous and non-aqueous drops remain separated from the substrate by air films of (sub) micrometer thickness at all times throughout a series of up to 16 consecutive bouncing events. We show that the purely dissipative force arising from the viscous squeeze-out of air is responsible for both the momentum transfer and for a substantial part of the residual energy dissipation.

These exceptional dimensions provide certain advantages (e. g. the mass-specific energetic cost of locomotion is decreased) but also disadvantages (e. g. forces are proportional to body volume while supportive tissue strength depends on their cross-sectional area, which makes elephants relatively more fragile than smaller animals). In order to understand better how body size affects gait mechanics {{the movement of the}} centre of mass (COM) of 34 Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) was studied over their entire speed range of 0. 4 - 5. 0 m s(- 1) with force platforms. The mass-specific mechanical work required to maintain the movements of the COM per unit distance is ~ 0. 2 J kg(- 1) m(- 1) (about 1 / 3 of the average of other animals ranging in size from a 35 g kangaroo rat to a 70 kg human). At low speeds this work is reduced by a pendulum-like exchange between the kinetic and potential energies of the COM, with a maximum energy exchange of ~ 60 % at 1. 4 m s(- 1). At high speeds, elephants use a <b>bouncing</b> <b>mechanism</b> with little exchange between kinetic and potential energies of the COM, although without an aerial phase.

40|$|The {{effect of}} age and body size on the <b>bouncing</b> <b>mechanism</b> of running was studied in {{children}} aged 2 - 16 years. The natural frequency of the bouncing system (fs) and the external work required to move the centre of mass of the body were measured using a force platform. At all ages, during running below ≈ 11 km h− 1, the freely chosen step frequency (f) is about equal to fs (symmetric rebound), independent of speed, although it decreases with age from 4 Hz at 2 years to 2. 5 Hz above 12 years. The decrease of step frequency with age {{is associated with a}} decrease in the mass-specific vertical stiffness of the bouncing system (k/m) due to an increase of the body mass (m) with a constant stiffness (k). Above 12 years, k/m and f remain approximately constant due to a parallel increase in both k and m with age. Above the critical speed of ≈ 11 km h− 1, independent of age, the rebound becomes asymmetric, i. e. f < fs. The maximum running speed (V¯f,max) increases with age while the step frequency at remains constant (≈ 4 Hz), independent of age. At a given speed, the higher step frequency in preteens results in a mass-specific power against gravity less than that in adults. The external power required to move the centre of mass of the body is correspondingly reduced...|$|R
40|$|When leaping an obstacle, {{the runner}} {{increases}} the vertical velocity of his/her {{centre of mass}} (COM) at takeoff to augment the amplitude and duration of the aerial phase over it. This study analyses the modification of the <b>bouncing</b> <b>mechanism</b> of running when approaching a barrier. The forces exerted by the {{feet on the ground}} are measured by a 13 -m-long force platform during the four to nine running steps preceding the jump over a 0. 45 - to 0. 85 -m-high barrier, at an approaching speed between 9 and 21  km h(- 1). The movements of the COM are evaluated by time-integration of the forces and the stiffness of the bouncing system by computer simulation. The running mechanism is modified during the two steps preceding the barrier. During the contact period, two steps before the barrier, the leg-spring stiffness decreases; consequently, the COM is lowered and accelerated forward. Then during the contact period preceding the obstacle, the leg-spring stiffness increases and the COM is raised and accelerated upwards, whereas its forward velocity is reduced. During this phase, the leg-spring acts like a pole, which stores elastic energy and changes the direction of the velocity vector to release this energy in a vertical direction. At high speeds, this storage-release mechanism of elastic energy is sufficient to provide the energy necessary to leap the obstacle. On the contrary, at low speeds, the amount of elastic energy stored and released in the leg-spring is not sufficient to jump over the obstacle and additional positive muscular work must be done...|$|R
40|$|One {{countermeasure}} {{used during}} long duration spaceflight to maintain bone and muscle mass is a treadmill {{equipped with a}} subject loading system (SLS) that simulates gravity. To date, {{little is known about}} the biomechanics of running in weightlessness on such a treadmill-SLS system. We have designed an instrumented treadmill/force-plate to compare the biomechanics of running in weightlessness to running on Earth. Gravity was simulated by two pneumatic pistons pulling downwards on a subject’s harness, with a force approximately equal to body weight on Earth. Four transducers, mounted under the treadmill, measured the three components of the reaction force exerted by the tread-belt under the foot. A high-speed video camera recorded the movements of limb segments while electromyography of four lower limb muscles was registered. Experiments in weightlessness where conducted during European Space Agency parabolic flight campaigns. Control experiments were performed on the same subjects on Earth. When running on the treadmill with a SLS, the <b>bouncing</b> <b>mechanism</b> of running is preserved. Depending on the speed of progression, the ground reaction forces, contact and aerial times, muscular work and bone stress differed by a maximum of ± 5 - 15 % during running on the treadmill with a SLS, as compared to on Earth. The movements of the lower limb segments and the EMG patterns of the lower limb muscles were also comparable. Thus the biomechanics of running on Earth can reasonably be duplicated in weightlessness using a treadmill with a SLS that generates a pull-down force close to body weight on Earth.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare energy cost of running and lower limb spring-mass {{characteristics}} and maximal power between young and older highly trained runners. Methods Twenty highly trained male endurance runners were divided into two groups: young and master athletes. Two testing sessions were used to measure and compare (i) lower limb power during three jumping tests (squat jump (SJ), countermovement jump (CMJ), and rebound jump (RJ)) as well as stiffness during the RJ test and running trials (using an OptoJump system (Microgate, Bolzano, Italy) placed on the floor for jumping and on each side of the treadmill belt for running), and (ii) the energy cost of running and oxygen consumption (V-O 2) kinetics (using an Oxycon Pro breath-by-breath gas analyzer (Jaeger, Höchberg, Germany)) at three speeds: 10 km·h- 1, self-selected speed, and speed corresponding to 90 % of the second ventilatory threshold (VT 2). Results Energy cost of running was higher in masters than in young athletes at all speeds (10 km·h- 1, 13. 0 %; self-selected, 10. 8 %; 90 % VT 2, 7. 7 % on average). Jumping power was lower in masters (SJ,- 28. 0 %; CMJ,- 30. 5 %; RJ,- 27. 9 %) and significantly correlated with energy cost at 10 km·h- 1 and at self-selected speed (10 km·h- 1 : r =- 0. 71,- 0. 70,- 0. 47; self-selected speed: r =- 0. 76,- 0. 74,- 0. 58, respectively).

40|$|Temporally and {{spatially}} resolved {{simulations of}} turbulent flow need realistic inlet velocity fluctuations. The vortex method, described and implemented in this work, adds vortices to the inlet mean flow profile. The vortices are randomly distributed over the inlet and they {{move across the}} extent of the inlet with a finite life-time. The initial vortex sizes, strengths, as well as their developing motion and life-times, are determined by the inlet mean velocity and turbulence distributions. In contrast to previous studies of the vortex method, the inlet mean velocity and turbulence distributions are in the present work theoretically determined, and thus form an explicit part of the boundary condition. This makes the method independent of precursor RANS simulations. Special care has been taken to distribute the vortices evenly across the inlet. The tangential velocity of the vortices is randomly initialized and the spatial and temporal correlation is preserved. An edge <b>bouncing</b> <b>mechanism</b> is implemented at solid boundaries. The boundary condition is applied to a DNS simulation of pipe flow at a Reynolds number of 5300, based on pipe diameter, aiming at reaching fully developed conditions at a short distance from the inlet. The results are compared with those using cyclic boundary conditions, and with two DNS results found in the literature. It is shown that a good agreement is reached for the mean velocity profiles five pipe diameters downstream from the inlet. Also the resolved velocity fluctuations at that location are reasonable. It is concluded that the present implementation of the vortex method boundary condition, based on theoretical mean velocity and turbulence profiles, gives an inlet flow that is sufficiently realistic to reach a well-resolved fully developed turbulent pipe flow at five pipe diameters downstream the inlet...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{focused on}} running when leaping over an obstacle, {{ranging from a}} little barrier to a high hurdle, in {{recreational}} runners (RR) and trained athletes (TA) and at different speeds. Four studies were performed from a global to a segmental approach. Experiments were realised on a 33 m long running track equipped with a 13 m long force plate. Runners were filmed by a high-speed camera. Results show that the velocity of progression increases from the fourth to the second step before the barrier, depending on the obstacle height, approaching velocity and level of expertise of the runner (RR vs TA). Moreover, we founded that the <b>bouncing</b> <b>mechanism</b> of running is modified during the two steps immediately preceding the barrier. During the contact period two steps before the barrier, a decrease of the torsional stiffness {{at the level of}} the knee and of the ankle induces a decrease of the leg-spring stiffness (kleg). Consequently the centre of mass of the runner (COM) is accelerated forward while remaining lower compared to steady-state running. During the last step before the barrier, the runner places the foot, from which he takes off, well in front of the body. During the contact, the increase of the torsional stiffness {{at the level of the}} knee and of the ankle induces an increase of the kleg. Consequently the COM is decelerated forward and elevated. During this phase, the leg-spring stores elastic energy and changes the direction of the velocity vector to release this energy in a vertical direction. The same strategy is used by TA and RR to cross an obstacle. However, TA optimise the mechanism of jumping by reducing the loss in the velocity of progression when crossing the obstacle and by limiting the vertical trajectory of the COM.

40|$|International audienceIn Radar remote sensing, the {{electromagnetic}} (em) modeling of scattering contributions from natural or man-made scatterers has often {{to deal with}} coupling scattering mechanisms due to the underlying reflecting surface (ground or water). For the monostatic configuration, this contribution is commonly associated with the so-called double <b>bounce</b> scattering <b>mechanism,</b> which is also known to be located in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images at the vertical projection of the scatterer onto the ground. To explore this phenomenon in the more general case of bistatic SAR but also for triple bounce scattering, a new formalism using virtual scatterers is introduced in this paper. Based upon image theory and on far-field assumption, these virtual points are defined by simple interaction scatterers located on the reflecting surface, and involving the same traveling wave path than the considered scattering mechanism. Depending only on the incidence and scattering angles, elegant formulae in their simplicity are highlighted to construct these fictitious scatterers. The resulting reduction of multiple to simple interaction scattering mechanisms simplifies the finding of their location within bistatic SAR images, generalizing thereby migration effects associated to coupling mechanisms in the bistatic configuration...|$|R

If they are converted into adiabatic/curvature perturbations after the bounce, they typically form the dominant contribution to the observed temperature fluctuations in the microwave background, which can have several beneficial implications.

The second objective is to evaluate the potential of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to quantify the adsorption of polydisperse colloids at the solid–liquid interface. The affinity of colloidal pitch for carboxyl methyl dextran (CMD) surfaces was studied by SPR and optical microscopy. The dynamics of adsorption and desorption of concentration pulses of colloidal pitch on carboxy methyl dextranwere followedat the solid–liquid interface by SPR. The parameters investigatedwere temperature, pitch concentration, colloid size and pitch build-up. The direct adsorption of pitch onto pulp fibreswas {{found to be a}} poor strategy for pitch control in papermaking. This is because of the very lowchemical affinity of pitch for polysaccharide surfaces. Pitch can be carried by fibres as the lowdesorption rate might not allowfull desorption during papermaking.

40|$|Triboelectric charge {{accumulation}} both poses {{problems and}} offers opportunities for dry particulate processing. It generates hazards in many industrial systems, but is exploited in several important applications, including electrophotographic toner charging and triboelectric separation. However, the charging of continuous particulate flows on solid surfaces is poorly understood, {{and design of}} devices to optimise triboelectric behaviour is often qualitative or based on trial and error. This study attempts to identify the main charging mechanisms for a continuous particulate flow on a flat surface. The proposed charging models incorporate contact time, velocity and mode of contact. A model incorporating contact area effects arising from sliding and rolling contact is consistent with experimental data, {{as long as a}} charge limit is imposed on <b>bouncing</b> particles. A <b>mechanism</b> for this charge limit, involving separation discharge, is proposed. The effect of delocalised image charge on the system is estimated and found to be negligible. Some general design principles are proposed for triboelectric optimisation of particle processing devices...|$|R
40|$|Summary. In string theory, the {{traditional}} {{picture of a}} Universe that emerges from the inflation of a very small and highly curved space-time patch is a possibility, not a necessity: quite different initial conditions are possible, and not necessarily unlikely. In particular, the duality symmetries of string theory suggest scenarios in which the Universe starts inflating from an initial state characterized by very small curvature and interactions. Such a state, being gravitationally unstable, will evolve towards higher curvature and coupling, until string-size effects and loop corrections make the Universe “bounce ” into a standard, decreasing-curvature regime. In such a context, the hot big bang of conventional cosmology {{is replaced by a}} “hot big bounce ” in which the <b>bouncing</b> and heating <b>mechanisms</b> originate from the quantum production of particles in the high-curvature, large-coupling pre-bounce phase.

In particular, the duality symmetries of string theory suggest scenarios in which the Universe starts inflating from an initial state characterized by very small curvature and interactions. Such a state, being gravitationally unstable, will evolve towards higher curvature and coupling, until string-size effects and loop corrections make the Universe "bounce" into a standard, decreasing-curvature regime. In such a context, the hot big bang of conventional cosmology {{is replaced by a}} "hot big bounce" in which the <b>bouncing</b> and heating <b>mechanisms</b> originate from the quantum production of particles in the high-curvature, large-coupling pre-bounce phase. Here we briefly summarize the main features of this inflationary scenario, proposed a quarter century ago. In its simplest version (where it represents an alternative and not a complement to standard slow-roll inflation) it can produce a viable spectrum of density perturbations, together with a tensor component characterized by a "blue" spectral index with a peak in the GHz frequency range. That means, phenomenologically, a very small contribution to a primordial B-mode in the CMB polarization, and the possibility of a large enough stochastic background of gravitational waves to be measurable by present or future gravitational wave detectors.

40|$|The new {{generation}} of spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radars (SAR) and optical sensors provides metric or submetric resolution imagery, thus allowing, in principle, the detection of single building damage after an earthquake. However, {{the complexity of the}} image forming mechanisms within urban settlements, especially of radar images, makes the automatic detection of damaged buildings still a challenging task. The integration of different pieces of information, not only from remote sensing but also from geological and structural data sources, may help providing reliable damage assessment. Such an integration is foreseen in the APhoRISM (Advanced PRocedures for volcanic Seismic Monitoring) FP 7 project which is the framework of the present study. In this work we present a semiautomatic procedure exploiting Very High Resolution images acquired before and after an earthquake from both SAR and optical sensors for providing damage assessment products at single building scale. In order to test the proposed methodologies we use optical images from QuickBird satellite and Spotlight COSMOSkyMed SAR imagery of the seismic event that hit L’Aquila city (Italy) on April 6, 2009. For validation purposes two ground based damage maps are used. The first one refers to the survey performed by the Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia(INGV), while the second one is related to ground survey carried out by the Italian Civil Protection Department (DPC). Dealing with metric and submetric resolutions, object based change detection approaches are proposed. For segmenting optical images a GIS layer reporting building footprints is used. This allow the change analysis to be focused on the objects of interest, avoiding false alarms due for example to vegetation changes and temporary objects. As for SAR data, because of the complexity and peculiarity of building appearance in radar images, an ad-hoc segmentation technique of the pre-event image has been developed. It is based on the use of morphological profiles to extract bright stripes and ridges caused by double <b>bounce</b> and/or layover <b>mechanisms,</b> the most distinctive features of the SAR building response. Looking at changes in these regions heavy damaged buildings can be identified. When a building collapses changes are also expected within the building footprint and in the shadow area. Typically an increase of the backscattering is observed in these regions due to the scattering contribution from debris and to the return coming from the ground previously occluded by the shadow. In order to single out such kind of changes a segmentation approach exploiting the KullbackLeibler Divergence (KLD) is proposed. A deep analysis of many change detection features, evaluated at object scale, is done by assessing their correlation with damage information provided by ground surveys. As for SAR data, the intensity ratio, the interferometric coherence, the intensity correlation and the KLD are analyzed. Regarding optical data, features describing texture and color changes are considered in addition to statistical similarity and correlation descriptors, such as the KLD and the Mutual Information. Exploiting these features, a non parametric classification approach based on the Bayesian Maximum A Posterior criterion is implemented for both SAR and optical data. The classification performances are not excellent when tested using the available ground truth, but a similar uncertainty has been observed comparing the INGV ground truth with that provided by the Italian DPC demonstrating the challenge of an accurate damage assessment even on ground (considering the difficulties encountered after an earthquake). SAR and optical data allow comparable performances in terms of damage sensitivity. Better performances in terms of false alarms rate are found using optical data. An improvement of the results is expected from the data integration approach foreseen in the APhoRISM project, which is presently under development and will be also depicted...|$|R
