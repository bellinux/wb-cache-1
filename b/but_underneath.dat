Love is {{the embodiment of}} what drives the band: the dichotomy of pretty/ugly... The pretty/ugly dynamic also comes across in Hole's music... a song like [...] "Teenage Whore" [...] at first comes across like a ranting noisy rage, <b>but</b> <b>underneath</b> is a surprisingly lush melody." [...] In a retrospective assessment, Spin noted the album's over noise rock influences, writing that it [...] "played like a AmRep release." ...|$|E
500|$|Dotty is {{a seven-year-old}} {{child who has}} pigtails. The EastEnders website {{describes}} her as [...] "butter wouldn't melt {{when it comes to}} this cockney sparrow, <b>but</b> <b>underneath</b> she's a devil in disguise", as well as conniving, backstabbing and cold-hearted. Altman described Dotty as [...] "a chip off the old block", as did Nancy Banks-Smith from The Guardian though the Daily Record described Dotty as [...] "a chip off her grandma's block". Charlie Clements, who played Bradley Branning, said that Dotty, being Nick's daughter, was [...] "bound to be a bit iffy." [...] He also called her [...] "evil", as did several critics.|$|E
500|$|Harrison married Hetty Cary in 1894. They {{had four}} children: three daughters, Ursula, Constance, and Sally, and a son, Richard. He {{was a member}} of the Episcopal Church. [...] Harrison was {{described}} as [...] "physically imposing", and gray-haired in his middle age. Harry DeButts, an employee and protégé, described him as [...] "a little cold when you first met him, <b>but</b> <b>underneath</b> he was a very warm, admirable, capable and wise man". He died on February 2, 1938, of heart disease, and was buried in Ivy Hill Cemetery in Alexandria, Virginia. [...] On the day after Harrison's death, the New York Times carried his obituary, but instead of a photograph of Harrison, the picture that ran with the obituary was of John Jeremiah Pelley, the president of the Association of American Railroads, who was still alive.|$|E

500|$|The musical {{composition}} of [...] "Teenage Whore" [...] follows {{the status quo}} of Pretty on the Inside, which is most often noted for its extreme abrasiveness, though it is also noted for its sophisticated use of melodic structure which is buried under arrangements. Spin addressed this, saying: [...] "at first [...] comes across like a ranting noisy rage, <b>but</b> <b>underneath</b> is a surprisingly lush melody." [...] The song's main verse riff follows an E-G-F chord progression, with the bridge composed of a layering of diminished fifths and muted strings, evoking a [...] "sonic uncleanliness." [...] As {{with the majority of}} the band's songs, the lyrics to [...] "Teenage Whore" [...] were written by Love, and deal with a negative self image and real or imagined perception of oneself as a [...] "whore", which is reinforced by the narrator's mother.|$|E
500|$|Garbage drummer and co-producer Butch Vig {{said that}} when the group contributed to film soundtracks, [...] "one of our fantasies would be to do the Bond theme or do the new Bond song." [...] Manson called herself {{a fan of the}} series, [...] "an {{institution}} I admire and has always captured my imagination since I was a child", and the films had a [...] "sensibility quite similar to how we approach making music". The chance to record a Bond theme appealed to her because [...] "you know it's going down in movie history", and coming from Scotland, like original Bond Sean Connery, [...] "that's very close and inherent in our culture. It's not Bond if it's not Scottish!" [...] The singer considered Garbage's music and the series' concepts [...] "something that you can enjoy on the surface, <b>but</b> <b>underneath</b> there are lots of conflicting themes you can get into." ...|$|E
500|$|He led the Vale {{to victory}} over Championship sides Sheffield United and Sheffield Wednesday {{in the opening}} rounds of the League Cup. However {{following}} {{a period of three}} defeats in seven days, Adams decided to place his whole squad on the transfer list, saying of his team's performance: [...] "We looked like a woman who had a big fur coat on <b>but</b> <b>underneath</b> she’s got no knickers on." [...] It was a controversial move, one that divided opinion among analysts and fans, also bringing the fourth tier club to national attention. He later admitted he merely played [...] "a psychological game with them... I don't think they fell for it – I don't think anybody fell for it". Three wins – including a cup win over League One Stockport County and a league win at local rivals Crewe Alexandra – and three draws within four weeks saw Adams nominated for the League Two Manager of the Month award for October 2009. In the January 2010 transfer window he signed winger Lewis Haldane permanently, and took winger Sean Rigg and striker Craig Davies on loan. Adams' men stormed into the play-off places {{for the first time in}} the season with just two games left to play, following a 2–1 win over champions-elect Notts County. Yet with just one point from their final two games, the Vale finished the season in 10th place.|$|E

500|$|Sharing what he {{perceived}} to be [...] "key" [...] moments {{in each of the}} seventeen music videos, Walker of MTV identified one for [...] "No Angel" [...] where Beyoncé [...] "proves she comes 'with a side of trouble'". Bradley Stern from MuuMuse remarked how the video looked like the video game Grand Theft Auto and showed things that did not look [...] "angelic": [...] "Between the tough-looking gangbangers, fancy cars and flashy jewelry, strippers and dozens of 'In Loving Memory' tees and tributes, it seems like Bey's trying to say these aren't exactly the easiest streets to live... But like the song suggests, just because things might get rough sometimes doesn't mean it's not still home." [...] A mixed review came from an editor of Houston Chronicle who described the clip as [...] "somber, shocking" [...] and noted the omissions of many landmarks characteristic for the city such as Waterwall, the Houston Astrodome and The Galleria. The editor also noted that the video offered a glimpse in the town's sex industry and elaborated, Many Houstonians probably don't know that side of the city. They almost certainly don't see it as beautiful. ' culture' is what some pundits call it. <b>But</b> <b>underneath</b> is something complicated, and it has a way of influencing society unlike anything else Houston produces. Because of Beyoncé, that is the Houston that the world sees. It is a Houston that deserves a closer look.|$|E
500|$|The show's writers {{presented}} Todd's personality as {{a combination}} of dark humor, uncouth behavior, and {{the essence of a}} tortured soul; he often delivers one-liners that range from humorous to sadistic. Soap opera columnist Jenn Bishop stated that Todd's personality is [...] "violent, gentle, caring, apathetic, smart, obsessive, crazy, irrational, devilish, heroic, angst-filled, comical, etc." [...] and that [...] " [...] loves, but he feels he's unworthy of true love because of the things he's done. He doesn't love himself and projects a facade of a confident, arrogant playboy, <b>but</b> <b>underneath</b> it all, he's someone who seeks an unattainable love". Columnist Jill Berry, who saw Todd as self-centered in the extreme, said that although Todd desperately wants to be loved, he is unable to give or receive it, and when he is loved, he will destroy it. She did acknowledge Todd's capability of loving his children, which he expressed by doing [...] "crazy and illegal things to prove it", but felt that much of the difficulty he experiences is brought on by himself and that he is incapable of learning from his mistakes even when they hurt the people he loves. She said Todd is in need of [...] "intensive therapy", which will never work because he refuses to change. [...] For example, as portrayed by St. John in 2006, he fights for the custody of his son, Sam, but he is motivated by anger that he has been lied to and revenge more than by a desire to recover his child.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews from critics, with several reviewers dubbing {{it one of}} the worst episodes of the series. Francis Dass of the New Straits Times Press referred to it as [...] "one of the weaker episodes" [...] of the fifth season. The A.V. Club reviewer Todd VanDerWerff gave [...] "Schizogeny" [...] a D–, and wrote that [...] "'Schizogeny' just might be the very worst episode of The X-Files", noting that [...] "the tone [...] is off." [...] Furthermore, VanDerWerff felt that [...] "the more Scott and Wollaeger try to continue explaining this and tie it into the idea of child abuse, the less it attains any of the power or tragedy they want it to have." [...] Starpulse, in a run-down of the best and worst episodes and villains of the series, named the killer trees the worst monster-of-the-week and wrote, [...] " [...] proved that even the X-Files writers can come up completely dry on their scary creeps sometimes." [...] Critical Myth's John Keegan gave the episode 4/10, and, while praising the [...] "interesting concept" [...] of the episode, concluded that it was filled with [...] "odd inconsistencies, [...] is definitely not one of the better episodes of the season." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three-and-a-half stars out of five. [...] The two wrote positively of {{the first part of the}} episode noting that [...] "director Ralph Hemecker [...] the eeriness to the fore, and [...] this a more honest-to-truth scary slice of X-File than has been offered in ages." [...] Shearman and Pearson, however, argued that the episode's references to Psycho and its [...] "lack of explanation" [...] result in the episode approaching [...] "nonsense." [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four. She wrote that, [...] "the plot of 'Schizogeny' is more tangled than the episode's paranormal root system, <b>but</b> <b>underneath</b> lies some powerful themes." ...|$|E

2500|$|Barnes {{remained}} {{contemptuous of}} Anaïs and would {{cross the street}} to avoid her. Barnes was angry that Nin had named a character Djuna, and when the feminist bookstore Djuna Books opened in Greenwich Village, Barnes called to demand that the name be changed. Barnes had a lifelong affection for poet Marianne Moore since she and Moore were young in the 1920s. [...] Barnes was bitter at the end, <b>but</b> <b>underneath</b> her sometimes formidable facade she was warm and always amusing, with an almost Shakespearean vocabulary (despite having not had much formal education).|$|E

In his later works, Merrick rejected socially imposed roles and labels, insisting that each gay person question the assumptions underlying his life. Gordon Merrick broke new ground that has only recently become fertile. Deeper probing into Merrick's works will undoubtedly yield richer understandings of the complex social dynamics that construct networks of control over human sexuality.' ...|$|E

2500|$|A decade later, the Goncourt brothers, diarists of the Second Empire, {{provided}} the fullest eyewitness portrait of La Païva, then close to 50 years of age.

Wrinkles which, under the light, look black in the white face; and down from {{each side of the}} mouth a crease {{in the shape of a}} horseshoe meeting beneath the chin and cutting across it in a great fold bespeaking age.

2500|$|The anime series, {{directed}} by Takayuki Inagaki {{who has worked}} on Desert Punk and Indian Summer, has an abundance of fanservice and panty shots that have been heavily criticized from reviewers in manga and anime, who have compared the show to panty-ridden series such as Najica Blitz Tactics and Agent Aika. Lumbard was disgusted by the fanservice of weird sexual imagery around Yukari, and lowered his overall opinion of the second anime series because of it. Høgset wrote that the series was like Shuffle! with more fanservice with [...] "average 'all the girls dotes on the guy' stupidity". Deb Aoki found the fanservice in the manga to be a bit unwholesome and cheesy, <b>but</b> <b>underneath</b> were teen themes about friendship, loyalty, and courage. Reception on the characters' fanservice has been acknowledged by Ikeda. In the bonus comics at the end of Season II, Volume 6, Ikeda responds to a fan letter that criticizes that the Newspaper Club girls artwork in the manga is not as moe as in the anime by having them go over aspects of moe that has already incorporated such as cat ears, knee socks, large breasts, twin tails, long bangs, as well as what the girls would look like when drawn with large eyes, distinguishing accessories and speech inflections. When asked in an interview about the fewer panty shots compared to other shōnen manga; Ikeda replied that he favors showing less as it would be more erotic and intriguing.|$|E
2500|$|GameSpot's Jeff Gerstmann {{was less}} impressed, scoring the PC version 6 out of 10, the PS2 version 6.4 out of 10 and the Xbox version 6.6 out of 10, and calling the game [...] "a foul-mouthed and bloody {{adventure}} that does {{next to nothing}} with the characters [...] The whole experience feels flat and often self-conscious." [...] Of the PC version, he wrote [...] "even on machines that go way beyond the game's recommended system requirements, we noticed plenty of frame rate trouble and slowdown. The textures aren't pretty, and overall, the game looks like a quick and dirty console port." [...] He concluded [...] "Overall, Scarface: The World Is Yours is more a victim of some poor design choices than any glaring technical issues. [...] by taking the focus off of the gameplay elements that you'd want in an open-city game and putting it more on the game's bland mission design and all the dull side tasks you'll {{have to do to}} earn a reputation, Scarface doesn't play to its potential strengths. The end result is a functional game that presents an interesting premise, <b>but</b> <b>underneath</b> you'll find a wholly uninteresting game." [...] He was even more critical of the Wii version, scoring it 5.8 out of 10, writing [...] "the gamepad-to-Wii Remote transition has made this lackluster game play even worse." [...] He was extremely critical of the controls; [...] "while it's somewhat impressive on some level that the developer managed to cram a standard gamepad-controlled game onto the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, it's never fun to play, and you'll feel like you're fighting the controls from start to finish." ...|$|E
