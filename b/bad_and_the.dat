5|$|A Fistful of Dollars {{proved a}} {{landmark}} {{in the development}} of spaghetti Westerns, with Leone depicting a more lawless and desolate world than traditional westerns, and challenging American stereotypes of a western hero with a morally ambiguous antihero. The film's success made Eastwood a major star in Italy and he was re-hired to star in For a Few Dollars More (1965), the second of the trilogy. Through the efforts of screenwriter Luciano Vincenzoni, the rights to For a Few Dollars More and the final film of the trilogy (The Good, the <b>Bad</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Ugly) were sold to United Artists for about $900,000.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1940s, Turner {{established}} {{herself as a}} leading actress in such films as Johnny Eager (1941), Honky Tonk (1941), Ziegfeld Girl (1941), and Somewhere I'll Find You (1942). She appeared in the 1941 horror film Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, and her reputation as a glamorous femme fatale was enhanced by her performance in the film noir The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946). Her popularity continued through the 1950s in such films as The <b>Bad</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Beautiful (1952) and Peyton Place (1957), for which she was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress.|$|E

5|$|The poem is an elegy in {{name but}} not in form; it employs a style {{similar to that of}} {{contemporary}} odes, but it embodies a meditation on death, and remembrance after death. The poem argues that the remembrance can be good and <b>bad,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> narrator finds comfort in pondering the lives of the obscure rustics buried in the churchyard. The two versions of the poem, Stanzas and Elegy, approach death differently; the first contains a stoic response to death, but the final version contains an epitaph which serves to repress the narrator's fear of dying. With its discussion of, and focus on, the obscure and the known, the poem has possible political ramifications, but it does not make any definite claims on politics to be more universal in its approach to life and death.|$|E

25|$|The Good, the <b>Bad</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Ugly was {{marketed as}} {{the third and final}} {{installment}} in the Dollars Trilogy, following A Fistful of Dollars and For a Few Dollars More. The film was a financial success, grossing over $25 million at the box office, and is credited with catapulting Eastwood into stardom. Due to general disapproval of the Spaghetti Western genre at the time, critical reception of the film following its release was mixed, but it gained critical acclaim in later years. The Good, the <b>Bad</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Ugly is now seen {{as one of the greatest}} and most influential Westerns of all time.|$|E

25|$|Leone, Donati and Luciano Vincenzoni worked {{together}} on the film’s screenplay {{for three to four}} weeks, discussing characters and scenes for the film. Donati, who had previously acted as an uncredited script doctor for The Good, the <b>Bad</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Ugly, conceived Juan Miranda’s character as an extension of Tuco from The Good, the <b>Bad</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Ugly. Meanwhile, Leone was largely responsible for the character of John Mallory, and the film’s focus on the development of John and Juan’s friendship. At times, however, Leone, Donati, and Vincenzoni found that they had highly differing opinions about how the film should be made, with Leone wanting to have the film produced on a large scale with an epic quality, while Donati and Vincenzoni perceived the film as a low-budget thriller.|$|E
