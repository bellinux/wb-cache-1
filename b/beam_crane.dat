It deals with the study of real stress in the cross section focused on local stress analysis in the web of cross section due to eccentricities of wheal load and {{on the problems of}} stress analysis above the middle support of multi-span beams. First, the outline of crane supporting structures, currently used methods of implementation and available stress analysis methods are summarized.

40|$|Abstract — The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to present a new methodology of calculation by means of the F. E. M. applied to crane jibs. This analysis has been carried out in terms of strength and stiffness, and for any type of crane jib: telescopic crane, lattice crane, closed <b>beam</b> <b>crane,</b> etc. There have been simulated different load cases and boundary conditions that the structure should bear. This load cases can be obtained from normal and extreme operation of the crane, and there have been taken into account current regulations and previous experience. It has been also necessary to define the methodology to simulate non structural elements, contacts, materials, etc. Concerning regulations, it has been necessary to make an adaptation of the regulation UNE- 58536, because the specific regulation affecting these crane jibs (UNE 1726), was not enough restrictive. Moreover it has been necessary to estimate some translational and rotational velocities to apply the regulation. Furthermore, the welding of some parts has been simulated and analyzed, and it has been carried out a comparative analysis between the experimental results and the numerical results for some load cases. Once this correlation has been obtained the methodology of calculation and the numerical results are validated. Index Terms — jib, F. E. M., strength, crane, forklift truck I...|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that many civil {{engineering}} constructions, such as roads, bridges, <b>beam</b> <b>cranes,</b> marine and off-shore structures may experience fatigue loading which can cause failure at a stress level much lower than in case of a single static load. Continuous degradation of the concrete during the loading process, due to propagation of microscopic cracks in the cement matrix and consequent strength decrease, may lead to extreme deformation and excessive crack widths, followed by structural collapse. This phenomenon is extensively documented in literature for normal, Vibrated Concrete (VC), whereas this is not so for Self-Compacting Concrete (SCC). Since both concrete types have a substantially different composition, it is unsure whether their mechanical properties regarding fracture behaviour and fatigue resistance are similar or not. In this paper the results of static and dynamic four point bending loading tests (with stress levels from 0. 10 fcc to 0. 80 fcc) on reinforced concrete beams are reported. For comparison purposes 50 % of the specimens is made from VC and 50 % from SCC. During the static and fatigue tests, deflection, strain, crack width evolution and failure mechanism are observed. Subsequently, further analysis is carried out and both types of concrete are compared. The results determine that differences in deflection, strain, and crack pattern are present. Definite conclusions regarding the number of cycles to failure, however, cannot be drawn, given the scatter on these results. For that, further research will be needed...|$|R
50|$|In 1956, Romer {{decided to}} mount a Kronosaurus queenslandicus {{skeleton}} and had to obtain an unusually large {{amount of money to}} do the job. This was because the weight of the final mount was estimated to exceed the carrying capacity of the floor on which it would rest, due to the large amount of steel that would be used in preparing the mount. Therefore, architects drafted plans for a large I-beam to span the entire width of the building. Then two large holes were opened in the external walls and permanent mounts were created on each wall to hold the <b>beam.</b> <b>Cranes</b> then raised and inserted the beam into the holes so that it spanned the entire floor and was then secured to the two mounts. Romer Lewis and Jensen decided how to mount Kronosaurus. Jensen had plans showing how {{to mount a}} dinosaur without visible supports, plans which relied on his talents as an artist, sculptor, house framer, machinist and welder. Romer gave his approval to attempt a free standing mount. The plans were modified to suit the actual skeleton and Kronosaurus became the first mount done anywhere without visible structural members. All supporting bars, beams and sheets of metal and wood were integrated into or behind the bones. In addition to the unique method of concealing structural elements, Jensen used a curved back wall that had no corners to create the trompe d'oeil effect of a floating skeleton. There were no corners, vertical walls, or lines which would create the impression that the Kronosaurus was standing on the floor.|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} conclusions {{were made}} {{upon completion of}} the testing of crane beams: The lowest rigidity is demonstrated by welded beams exposed to temporary mobile loads; the maximal buckling caused by temporary mobile loads is equal to 12 mm, or 1 / 1, 1790 of the span; the rigidity of <b>crane</b> <b>beams</b> of an overflow dam meets the requirements set by Section E 2. 1 of Construction Rules 20. 13330. 2011 "Loads and Actions". In general, the authors state that the <b>crane</b> <b>beams</b> of the span structure of the overflow dam are in a serviceable operating condition, according to their opinion issued upon completion of examination and testing procedures. The recommendation is to regularly tighten screw nuts and to install high-strength bolts in the points of missing rivets.
