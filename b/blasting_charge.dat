Wrecking balls are more likely to cause collateral damage, because it is difficult to completely control the swing of the ball.|$|R
30|$|The {{damage of}} plain panels under contact explosions was {{evaluated}} for failure modes such as crater, spall, and breach. The failure modes {{of the plain}} panels were obtained according to amount of <b>blast</b> <b>charge</b> for the contact blast tests using emulsion explosives. Observations of how the amount of <b>blast</b> <b>charge</b> affected the failure mode of plain panels were made, and a suitable amount of <b>blast</b> <b>charge</b> for damage evaluation was determined. From evaluating the damage results of plain panels, the amount of <b>blast</b> <b>charge</b> for contact <b>blast</b> tests of FRCC panels was determined. In this study, emulsion explosives (NewMITE Plus) were used in contact blast tests because they are chemically very safe and easy to cast (Hanhwa Corporation/Explosive 2016). For emulsion explosives, the thermal energy is 4.61  MJ/kg, which is calculated by heat of explosion (1100  kcal/kg) of NewMITE Plus. In addition, {{the value of the}} thermal energy of TNT was used 4.29  MJ/kg with reference to the previous work by Morishita et al. (2000, 2004). Thus, the ratio of the thermal energy between TNT and emulsion explosives is 1.07. In later discussions, the mass of the emulsion explosive is converted to equivalent TNT mass by means of this ratio.|$|R

But he was satisfied with this, and something in him thrilled as he heard in the crash of a <b>blasting</b> <b>charge</b> man's bold challenge to the wilderness.

The former held a steel bar in blue, frost-cracked hands and twisted it in the cavity while his companion struck the end. He knelt, in a cramped pose, in the snow, and Festing smiled. Bob was fond of comfort, and it was strange to see him occupied like this. Then, noting the length of the bar, he thought they would not sink the hole deep enough for the <b>blasting</b> <b>charge</b> before dinner, which was unfortunate, because the powder fumes are poisonous and would hang about the spot for some time.|$|E

Then he rose stiffly, and put on his clothes, which he found had been dried, and was informed {{by a man who}} appeared while he was doing it that his breakfast was waiting. Brooke wondered a little at this, for he knew that it was past the usual hour, but he made an excellent meal, and then, being shown into a compartment of the little galvanized iron shanty, found Saxton sitting at a table.

60|$|Winter {{was drawing}} towards its close at last, when, {{on the evening}} of a day in which the result of a heavy <b>blasting</b> <b>charge</b> had {{exceeded}} his utmost expectations, Geoffrey Thurston stood beside his foreman in his workmen's mess shanty. Tin lamps hung from the beams blackened with smoke, and sturdy men were finishing their six o'clock supper beneath them. The men were the pick of the province, for, until tempted by the contractor's high wages, most of them had been engaged in laying the foundations of its future greatness by wresting new spaces for corn and cattle from the forest. They ate, as they worked, heroically. The supper was varied and bountiful, for Geoffrey, who was conscious of a thrill of pride as he glanced down the long rows of weather-beaten faces, fed his workmen well. They had served him faithfully through howling gale and long black night, under scorching sun and bitter frost, and now that the result of that day's operations had brought the end of the work in sight, there was satisfaction in the knowledge that he had led such men.|$|E

The spell of the mountains and the company of broad-minded cheerful toilers had between them done a good deal for Lee. Then up on the hillside a strip of bunting fluttered from the summit of a blighted pine, the cry [...] "She's coming!" [...] rolled from man to man, and there was a thunderous crash as some one fired a heavy <b>blasting</b> <b>charge.</b> A plume of white vapor rose {{at the end of the}} valley, and twinkling metal flashed athwart the pines, while a roar of voices broke out and my own heart beats faster in the succeeding stillness.

30|$|For blast {{tests of}} {{cementitious}} composite materials, the failure modes {{are influenced by}} the standoff distance from the explosion source. The effect of blast load on the test specimens decreases with atmospheric pressure and the dispersion of explosion pressure increases with the distance from the explosion source. Furthermore, the mass of high explosive (HE) is also serves as a very important parameter in the failure modes of cementitious composite materials. Therefore, the scaled distance with the mass of HE has {{a significant impact on the}} failure modes of cementitious composite materials under the explosion test. In the close-in blast test, generally induces global damage of the test specimen, such as flexural failure, cracking, and shear-punching action, based on the standoff distance level. However, local damage (i.e., crater, spall, and breach) also will occur if the combined loads are severe enough (McVay 1988), although that require larger <b>blast</b> <b>charge</b> compared to the contact blast test. In contrast, the failure modes of cementitious composite materials caused by contact-blast tests tend to be local damage. Thus, the current study employs contact explosions because various strengths of <b>blast</b> <b>charge</b> are required; namely, when considering the explosion tests on a laboratory scale, the local damage of the concrete panel caused by the close-in blast test is difficult to perform, whereas the evaluation of local damage is possible with only a small amount of <b>blast</b> <b>charge</b> in contact explosions.|$|R

30|$|In the literature, {{the authors}} have shown that certain {{properties}} {{are determined by the}} orientation of the crystallites on the substrate. That is, the FWHM width of the ZnO peak along the orientation (002) of the X-ray inclination curve should be less than 0.58 to achieve an effective electromechanical coupling [18, 19]. Other studies have shown the frequency dependence of the electrical properties of ZnO sandwich structures [20]. The σAC test based on the electrical properties of the ZnO thin films showed that in the frequency range of 10  kHz to 10  MHz, electrical conduction is performed by tunneling between the quantum wells. The resistivity of the dielectric material being high, the electrical conductivity of the material can only be achieved by transporting the <b>blasting</b> <b>charge</b> between the particles. In this work, the characteristics of metal–insulator–semiconductor (MIS) capacitors with zinc oxide (ZnO) as a dielectric material were studied.

40|$|The {{sizes and}} shapes of armourstone blocks for rubble break-waters are {{primarily}} determined at the quarryface, and later modification then occurs in situ in the breakwater environ-ment. The principal controlling parameters in the quarry include: rock type, rock joint frequency and orientation, size and type of <b>blasting</b> <b>charge</b> and {{the orientation of the}} blast's fractionating power. The majority of existing data on this subject has been obtained from detailed studies of quarries principally con-cerned with aggregate production in Britain, but extensive studies have recently been carried out on a variety of rock types in quarries that are currently producing primary ar-mourstone for breakwater structures in the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom. These studies combine to permit the relative importance of the various controlling factors which operate during quarrying, transport, placement and subsequently in service to be evaluated and are reported here. The quarry-orientated study is supplemented by detailed studies of block modification and deterioration i the several different environmental zones of breakwater structures. The principal factors controlling this shape modification are micro-fracture pattern, mineralogy and fabric, grade of weather-ing of the original rock, grain interlock and intergranular cement ype. Changes in shape will modify the stability factors of in situ armour blocks and alter void ratios and slope angles, which together are perhaps the most important factors controlling the dissipation of wave energies on rubble mound breakwaters.
