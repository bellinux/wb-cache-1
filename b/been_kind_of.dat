5|$|It's not literal {{about the}} drug for me, I've never taken lithium before. It's sort of a metaphor about {{numbness}} and happiness... it's me looking at happiness {{in a negative way}} because I've always <b>been...</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> afraid to be happy. Like with the band and the art and everything else, it's always like I'm never letting myself break through into the happiness it seems like, because it's not cool or something. And describing happiness is lithium, it's like saying 'that's numbness, I won't be able to be an artist anymore if I'm happy', which is hilarious because that's just not true, I'm happy. So it's... this fight within the song of... 'do I do this and get out of here and get happy or do I wallow in it like I always do?' and it's cool because {{at the end of the}} song I say 'I'm going to let it go', like I am going to be happy.|$|E

500|$|The Industrial Records website {{explains}} that the musicians wanted to re-invent rock music, and that their uncensored records were about {{their relationship with the}} world. They go on to say that they wanted their music to be an awakening for listeners so that they would begin to think for themselves and question the world around them. [...] Industrial Records intended the term industrial to evoke the idea of music created for a new generation, with previous music being more agricultural: P-Orridge stated that [...] "there's an irony in the word 'industrial' because there's the music industry. And then there's the joke we often used to make in interviews about churning out our records like motorcars —that sense of industrial. And ... up till then the music had <b>been</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> based on the blues and slavery, and we thought it was time to update it to at least Victorian times—you know, the Industrial Revolution".|$|E

500|$|The third pod of {{the season}} [...] "ties {{together}} [...] thematically", taking the characters into the virtual world of the Framework, where their lives {{are different from the}} real world. This explores [...] "what if" [...] scenarios for many of the characters by showing who they may have been if a major regret of their life was changed, hence the pod's title, Agents of Hydra. This continues the season's focus on the nature of identity and reality, having [...] "payoff to all the reflection on the past" [...] such as Mack's tragic loss of his daughter and Fitz's troubled relationship with his father. Bennet called the pod [...] "very relevant. It's definitely a theme that I think has <b>been</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> hopping around in pop culture at the moment. But it's kind of like a fun Marvel take on that. For all those people who wished to see these characters in a different light, {{this is going to be}} the time for that to happen." [...] Whedon felt that this storyline would not be interesting early in a series, but is rewarding after spending [...] "80-plus episodes with these characters".|$|E
500|$|Most of the {{material}} was written by Cornell and bassist Ben Shepherd, the latter having already worked on six of the sixteen album tracks. Reportedly, tensions within the group arose during the recording sessions, with guitarist Kim Thayil and Cornell allegedly clashing over Cornell's desire to shift away from the heavy guitar riffing that had become the band's trademark. Thayil's only contribution to the album was the song [...] "Never the Machine Forever", for which he wrote both the lyrics and the music, and which was also the last song the band recorded. The song initially {{came out of a}} jam session Thayil had with Seattle musician Greg Gilmore. In the liner notes, Thayil credits Gilmore for inspiring the song. He stated that {{he had a lot of}} incomplete music ideas that were missing lyrics and were not arranged, so they did not make the album. Thayil said, [...] "It can be a little bit discouraging if there isn't satisfactory creative input, but on the other hand, I write all the solo bits and don't really have limitations on the parts I come up with for guitar." [...] Cornell said, [...] "By the time we were finished, it felt like it had <b>been</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> hard, like it was a long, hard haul. But there was stuff we were discovering." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the {{worldwide}} tour {{in support of}} Superunknown, the band began working on what would become their last studio album for over 15 years, choosing to produce the record themselves. However, tensions within the group reportedly arose during the sessions, with Thayil and Cornell allegedly clashing over Cornell's desire to shift away from the heavy guitar riffing that had become the band's trademark. Cornell said, [...] "By {{the time we were}} finished, it felt like it had <b>been</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> hard, like it was a long, hard haul. But there was stuff we were discovering." [...] The band's fifth album, Down on the Upside, was released on May 21, 1996. It was notably less heavy than the group's earlier albums, and marked a further departure from the band's grunge roots. At the time, Soundgarden explained that they wanted to experiment with other sounds, including acoustic instrumentation. David Browne of Entertainment Weekly said, [...] "Few bands since Led Zeppelin have so crisply mixed instruments both acoustic and electric." [...] The overall mood of the album's lyrics is less dark than on previous Soundgarden albums, with Cornell describing some songs as [...] "self-affirming". The album spawned several singles, including [...] "Pretty Noose", [...] "Burden in My Hand", and [...] "Blow Up the Outside World". [...] "Pretty Noose" [...] was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance in 1997. Despite favorable reviews and modest sales, the album did not match the sales or critical praise of Superunknown.|$|E

500|$|The {{first time}} Karofsky {{received}} significant notice from critics {{was for the}} second season's sixth episode, [...] "Never Been Kissed". Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times commented that it was testament to the writers and cast that Karofsky's kiss startled the audience {{as much as it}} did Kurt, and commended the transitioning of Karofsky from a faceless jock into [...] "a nuanced character with a back story and hidden motives of his own." [...] MTV's Aly Semigran wrote that, should the episode inspire a single teenager to have courage in the face of discrimination, or re-consider bullying, it would be an impressive accomplishment. Linda Holmes of National Public Radio dismissed [...] "Never Been Kissed" [...] as [...] "one of the most facile and emotionally inauthentic episodes the show has ever produced", and felt that Karofsky's swift transition from bullying to kissing Kurt was absurd and [...] "emotionally unsound". His appearances over the next few episodes drew only oblique commentary, such as The Atlantic Kevin Fallon's characterization in his review on [...] "Furt" [...] of the bullying storyline as a [...] "very important arc that's been well-acted by all parties involved". In [...] "The Sue Sylvester Shuffle", The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff wrote, [...] "I thought giving Kurt's bully, Karofsky (...), a miniature story arc that resolved itself only partially was a smart move. Up until now, he's <b>been</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> a walking cliché, and now he gets to be someone who's not all repressed sexuality and monstrous tendencies." [...] Reiter commented, [...] "And best of all, we got to watch Karofsky's character develop a bit more. It was nice to see him let loose a little and dance, but all his back-and-forthing about glee was a little confusing." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{original}} cut of {{the film}} that screened for test audiences prior to the reshoots became known colloquially as The Producer's Cut, and bootlegged copies of it surfaced among film collectors. This cut of Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers features numerous differences, ranging from different scores and musical cues to substantial shifts in plot, particularly regarding the film's conclusion. In a retrospective interview, Farrands noted that the finale in this {{cut of the}} film was sufficiently [...] "creepy" [...] and [...] "Gothic," [...] but conceded that it lacked intensity, which is largely what prompted Dimension Films to begin reshoots. The Producer's Cut of the film garnered a cult following, according to writer Farrands: [...] "It's amazing the life that [...] has continued to have because there is this alternate version that has <b>been,</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> in-the-vault all these years." ...|$|E
2500|$|Director Guillermo del Toro {{explored}} several concepts for the sequel, initially {{planning to}} recreate the classic versions of Frankenstein, Dracula and The Wolf Man. He and comic book creator Mike Mignola also spent a few days adapting the Almost Colossus story, featuring Roger the Homunculus. They then {{found it easier to}} create an original story based on folklore, because del Toro was planning Pan's Labyrinth, and Mignola's comics were becoming increasingly based on mythology. Later, del Toro pitched a premise to Revolution Studios that involved four Titans from the four corners of Earth—Wind, Water, Fire, and Earth—before he replaced the Titans with a Golden Army. Mignola described the theme of the sequel, [...] "The focus is more on the folklore and fairy tale aspect of Hellboy. It's not Nazis, machines and mad scientists but the old gods and characters who have <b>been</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> shoved out of our world." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 2000s {{the term}} [...] "screamo" [...] began being used loosely to {{describe}} any use of screamed vocals in music.

Juan Gabe, vocalist for the band Comadre, alleged that the term [...] "has <b>been</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> tainted in a way, especially in the States." [...] Derek Miller, guitarist for the band Poison the Well noted the term's constant differing usages and jokingly stated that it [...] "describes a thousand different genres." [...] According to Jeff Mitchell of Iowa State Daily, [...] "there is no set definition of what screamo sounds like but screaming over once deafeningly loud rocking noise and suddenly quiet, melodic guitar lines is a theme commonly affiliated with the genre."
