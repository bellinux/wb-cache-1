5000|$|Future {{relative}} to a reference point is formed using the past tense of the copula, e.g. [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to eat dinner" [...] (instead of the present [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to eat dinner"). This may express past intention ("I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to eat dinner") or prediction ("It <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to rain").|$|R

5|$|On 20 February 1941, No. 4 Commando were {{informed}} they would <b>be</b> <b>going</b> to Troon in Scotland for an exercise. The {{next day the}} unit boarded HMS Queen Emma, but on 22 February 1941, after they anchored at Scapa Flow, their real objective was divulged. Together with No. 3 Commando they were to conduct Operation Claymore, a raid on the Lofoten Islands. Claymore's main objective was to stop the manufacture of fish oil and its exportation to Germany, where it was used in making explosives.|$|E

5000|$|..... Upon the {{suggestion}} of Gendarmerie Forces Commander Gen. Şener Eruygur, {{we went to the}} social facilities of the gendarmerie. (...) We decided to form an action plan on our own. We <b>were</b> first <b>going</b> {{to take control of the}} media, so I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to invite M.Ö. for that purpose. We <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to keep in contact with rectors and arrange for students to engage in demonstrations. We <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to act in unison with unions. We <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to get posters hung in the streets. We <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to contact associations and incite them against the government. We <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to do all of this across the country, and it would be known as Sarıkız.|$|R
5|$|The {{war in the}} Middle East {{ended on}} 31 October 1918, {{following}} {{the signing of the}} Armistice of Moudros. In November the regiment was selected {{to be part of the}} Allied force of occupation for the Dardanelles peninsula. They would again <b>be</b> <b>going</b> in a dismounted role, but only twenty-five officers and 464 other ranks were involved. Leaving Egypt on 28 November they disembarked on 5 December and moved into their camps at Maidos and Kilid Bahr. On 19 January 1919, the majority of the regiment returned to Egypt, rejoining the brigade at Kantara.|$|E
5|$|A counterattack to {{take back}} the {{airfield}} and Point 107 was organised for the following day at Hargest's headquarters. He was exhausted and had to take a quick nap before a conference to work out detailed plans for the counter-attack, much to the disgust of some of the other participants. Afterwards, he became pessimistic of the chances of success and unsuccessfully sought to have the attack called off. The attack did fail but Hargest, still well behind the frontlines, mistakenly believed it to <b>be</b> <b>going</b> well until he found that his brigade had returned to their starting positions. His pessimism began to affect Puttick, who asked Freyberg to allow the 5th Infantry Brigade to withdraw, which it duly did. This began an eventual retreat and evacuation from Crete on 31 May, with Hargest flying out for Egypt by seaplane, his brigade following by sea.|$|E
5|$|Both yes–no {{questions}} and wh-questions in English are mostly formed using subject–auxiliary inversion (Am I going tomorrow?, Where can we eat?), which may require do-support (Do you like her?, Where did he go?). In most cases, interrogative words (wh-words; e.g. what, who, where, when, why, how) {{appear in a}} fronted position. For example, in the question What did you see?, the word what appears as the first constituent despite being the grammatical object of the sentence. (When the wh-word is the subject or forms part of the subject, no inversion occurs: Who saw the cat?.) Prepositional phrases can also be fronted when they are the question's theme, e.g. To whose house did you go last night?. The personal interrogative pronoun who is the only interrogative pronoun to still show inflection for case, with the variant whom serving as the objective case form, although this form may <b>be</b> <b>going</b> out of use in many contexts.|$|E

5|$|Despite these setbacks, the West Pier Trust {{remained}} {{adamant that}} they would soon begin full restoration work. Retired boxer Chris Eubank criticised the delays in restoring the pier, saying he could raise the money himself in six months. In December 2004, the Trust confirmed the restoration would not <b>be</b> <b>going</b> ahead after their plans were rejected by the Heritage Lottery Fund. The pier was partially demolished in February 2010, partly {{to make way for}} the planned i360 observation tower. In February 2014, due to stormy weather, the pier split in half and a large part of the centre fell into the sea. Waves swept away the eastern side of the damaged metal skeleton, which remained after the 2003 fire. A selection of artefacts rescued from the pier is exhibited in the Brighton Fishing Museum. A further section of the pier collapsed in 2016.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the nature}} of filming for a {{computer}} game, certain short performances had to be filmed over and over separately, like Adrienne simply crossing a room. Many of the actors, including Morsell, Lee and Bailey, had never done any blue screen acting before, and Miano had only done it once. Morsell in particular said she found it challenging because it was so physically constrictive. Such items as tables, chairs, doors or stairs that the actors appear to interact with are in fact constructed objects painted blue to match the blue screen, and were occasionally challenging for the actors to work with. During one scene, David Homb accidentally stood {{in such a way that}} his arm appeared to <b>be</b> <b>going</b> through the living room wall.|$|E
5|$|Low-altitude {{intercepts}} {{would also}} {{have the advantage of}} reducing the problem with nuclear blackout. The lower edge of an extended fireball used to induce nuclear blackout extended down to about 60km, the same as the altitude at which decluttering became effective. Hence, low-altitude intercepts meant that deliberate attempts to create a blackout would not affect the operation of the Sprint missile. Just as importantly, because the Sprint's own warheads would <b>be</b> <b>going</b> off far below this altitude, their fireballs would be much smaller and only black out {{a small portion of the}} sky. The radar would have to survive the electrical effects of EMP, and significant effort was expended on this. It also meant that the threat tube trajectories would have to be developed rapidly, before or between blackout periods. This demanded a very high-performance computer, one that did not exist at that time.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) {{receives}} a text from Robert California (James Spader) inviting {{him on the}} trip to Tallahassee. After unsuccessfully trying to back out via text, Jim and Pam both agree Jim should just go. During Jim's request session with Andy and Dwight, Jim shows the texts from California, shocking both Andy and Dwight, making it all but official that Jim will <b>be</b> <b>going</b> to Tallahassee. The final team includes Cathy, Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak), Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker), Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) and Jim, infuriating Dwight. At first he tries to convince the members to change their minds, but after realizing they all have excellent ideas for the project, he is content with the team.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the public}} blamed Ernest for Sellis's death. The more extreme Whig papers, anti-royal pamphleteers, and caricaturists all offered nefarious {{explanations}} for Sellis's death, in which the Duke was to blame. Some stories had the Duke cuckolding Sellis, with the attack as retaliation, or Sellis killed for finding Ernest and Mrs. Sellis in bed together. Others suggested that the Duke was the lover of either Sellis or Neale, and that blackmail had {{played a part in}} the death. Both Roger Fulford and John Van der Kiste, who wrote books about George III's children, ascribe part of the animus and fear towards the Duke {{to the fact that he}} did not conduct love affairs in public, as did his older brothers. According to them, the public feared what vices might <b>be</b> <b>going</b> on behind the locked doors of the Duke's house, and assumed the worst.|$|E
5|$|The Tramp {{encounters}} {{the drunken}} millionaire {{a third time}} and is again invited to the mansion. The Tramp relates the girl's plight and the millionaire gives him money for her operation. Two burglars knock the millionaire out and {{take the rest of}} his money. The burglars flee before the arrival of the police, who find the Tramp with the money the millionaire gave him, but because of the knock on his head the millionaire does not remember giving it. The Tramp evades the police long enough to get the money to the girl, telling her he will <b>be</b> <b>going</b> away for a time, but in due course he is apprehended and imprisoned.|$|E
