5|$|Microsoft {{introduced}} Windows Server 2012 and its developer preview in the BUILD 2011 {{conference on}} September 9, 2011. However, unlike Windows 8, the developer preview of Windows Server 2012 was only {{made available to}} MSDN subscribers. It included a graphical user interface (GUI) based on Metro design language and a new Server Manager, a graphical application used for server management. On February 16, 2012, Microsoft released an update for developer preview <b>build</b> <b>that</b> extended its expiry date from April 8, 2012 to January 15, 2013.|$|E
5|$|Because {{it would}} be {{utilized}} in both directions, {{the capacity of the}} proposed interstate loop line would be equivalent, it is said, to two 2-track lines or one 4-track line from New Jersey to New York City due to its having two crossings between New Jersey and New York. The loop was said to be able to carry 192,500 passengers per hour, or 4.62million daily passengers, had it been built. The estimate was based on the operation of 35 trains per hour in each direction, and each train would be eleven cars long and would carry 100 passengers per car. It was to be built as a multi-phase project, wherein the IRT and BMT would work together to <b>build</b> <b>that</b> system to New Jersey. Extensions of the IRT Flushing Line and BMT Canarsie Line were both considered; the Canarsie Line was to be extended to Hoboken near the Palisades, while the Flushing Line was to be extended to Franklin Street between Boulevard and Bergenline Avenues in Union City. Ultimately, the cost was too great, and with the Great Depression, these ideas were quickly shot down.|$|E

These machines {{are not considered}} a viable approach to net power because of their high conduction and radiation losses. They are simple enough to <b>build</b> <b>that</b> amateurs have fused atoms using them.|$|E

25|$|Baekje {{was heavily}} {{influenced}} by Goguryeo because the first King Onjo of Baekje was a son of the Goguryeo's first king Go Ju-mong {{as well as by}} southern China. As it expanded southward, moving its capital to Ungjin (current Gongju) in 475 and to Sabi (current Buyeo) in 538, its arts became richer and more refined than that of Goguryeo. Also characteristic of Baekje architecture is its use of curvilinear designs. Though no Baekje buildings are extant - in fact, no wooden structure of any of the Three Kingdoms now remains - it is possible to deduce from Horyuji temple in Japan, which Baekje architects and technicians helped to <b>build,</b> <b>that</b> Baekje's architecture came into full bloom after the introduction of Buddhism in 384. What remains in the building sites, patterned tiles and other relics, as well as the stone pagodas that have survived the ravages of time, testifies to the highly developed culture of Baekje.|$|E
25|$|Release Candidate 2 (RC2) (built on October 3, 2006 with a {{build number}} of 5744.16384), was {{released}} to CPP members, TAP testers, MSDN/Technet subscribers, and other technical beta testers on Friday, October 6, 2006, and {{was available for}} download until October 9. Because of an aggressive development schedule, this was the final <b>build</b> <b>that</b> would be officially released {{to the general public}} for testing. Nevertheless, all pre-release product keys will work until the final RTM build. Several testers reported that RC2 was faster and more stable than build 5728. However, because RC2, which was a regular interim build, and not a major milestone as the name suggests, was not as rigorously tested as RC1, RC1 may have been more stable in certain situations. This build fixed many compatibility issues that plagued previous builds. Vista's GUI, which continued to be improved, contained some minor tweaks, one of the more prominent of which was the new ability to customize the color, but not the transparency, of maximized windows. In previous builds, windows became predominantly black when maximized, an effect that could not be altered by users. A Control Panel icon for Windows Sideshow was also added.|$|E

500|$|The Sam & Max {{franchise}} {{has been}} highly successful critically, {{and is considered}} an iconic and influential aspect of the video game industry in the 1990s and the adventure game genre. In 2007, Steve Purcell wrote that he was somewhat surprised at {{the success of his}} creation, noting that the series had gained a large fan gathering despite the small size of the franchise. As the series contains only a small amount of comics, video games and a short TV series, Purcell commented that there was [...] "certainly not enough material to <b>build</b> <b>that</b> relentless traction of an endlessly renewed sitcom or a syndicated comic that has existed since the Korean Conflict". The comics were well received by critics, many praising the humor and style of the stories and characters. However, later commentators have noted that the comic book series did not gain much popularity or recognition until after the release of Sam & Max Hit the Road in 1993; the later episodic video games are seen to have revived interest in the comics again, resulting {{in the creation of the}} webcomic [...] "The Big Sleep" [...] and publication of an anniversary edition of Surfin' The Highway.|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Hanauer {{teamed up}} with Hollywood {{producer}} Joe Roth to make another bid for MLS expansion into Seattle, {{at a cost of}} $30million. Paul Allen, whose First and Goal company operated Qwest Field (now CenturyLink Field), joined the ownership group that same year, making the bid the most promising yet for Seattle. During the first week of November 2007, rumors began to <b>build</b> <b>that</b> MLS would be announcing an expansion into Seattle the following week, and that the ownership group had taken on a fourth member, TV personality Drew Carey. In a press conference on November 13, 2007, it was announced that Seattle had been awarded an expansion team. The announcement marked the return of top-level soccer to Seattle {{for the first time since}} the dissolution of its North American Soccer League (NASL) team in 1983. [...] The announcement also meant that the Seattle Sounders of the USL First Division would play its final season the year before the new MLS franchise was formed. [...] "Seattle Sounders FC" [...] was announced as the team name on April 7, 2008, along with the team logo, colors and badge design, in a presentation held at the Space Needle.
