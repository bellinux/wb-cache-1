Jackson {{expressed}} his desire for Diprivan; [...] "it was the only medication that makes him fall asleep straight away". Lee was concerned, he seemed to have a familiarity with it. Jackson told Lee he had been administered Diprivan before but only for surgery, not for anything else. Lee says she didn't know what Diprivan was, so she called a doctor friend of hers who said it was an anesthetic used for surgery in hospital. Jackson told her other doctors had said Diprivan was safe to use, that all he needed was to be monitored. Jackson asked her to stay that night because he wanted to show Lee he was unable to sleep, he slept for 5 hours, woke up and was upset that he didn't sleep longer and that the nutritional medicine wasn't working. He then said [...] "the only thing that helps is Diprivan, can you find someone to help me sleep?" [...] "as soon as Diprivan gets in my veins it knocks me out and I go to sleep right away".

[...] The carrot-chewing scenes are generally followed by Bugs' most well-known catchphrase, [...] "What's up, Doc?", which was written by director Tex Avery for his first Bugs Bunny film, A Wild Hare (1940). Avery explained later that it was a common expression in his native Texas and that he did not think much of the phrase. When the cartoon was first screened in theaters, the [...] "What's up, Doc?" [...] scene generated a tremendously positive audience reaction. As a result, the scene became a recurring element in subsequent cartoons. The phrase was sometimes modified for a situation.

[...] to the knight in Knight-mare Hare, and [...] "What's up, prune-face?" [...] to the aged Elmer in The Old Grey Hare. He might also greet Daffy with [...] "What's up, Duck?"

Knockout – Kamp i Kirken, is an event, derived from the idea, that an actual confrontation with intense boxing matches - within the religious framework of a church, will inspire one to reflect and consider the struggles in life. Therefore, this paper examines the problem definition: How do you create and analyse a new experience ideal in a site-specific event, based on two contrasting agencies. In order to investigate this, a performance was established in cooperation with uKirke and SABU (Sjællands Amatør Bokse Union). This allowed the project to create a phenomenological processing point, from a theoretical site-specific design, deduced from Miwon Kwon’s book; “One Place After Another” (2004). The project will then have the intention to be evaluated through participant observations and an analytic viewpoint from Michael Eigtved’s book; “Forestillinger” (2003).
