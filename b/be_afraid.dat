Marge assures him {{he has nothing to}} <b>be</b> <b>afraid</b> of, but a green fog seeps in through the window and the Simpsons are turned inside out.

5|$|Do I wish I {{had never}} endured post-partum depression? Absolutely. But {{to deny the}} {{experience}} is to deny who I am. I still mourn the loss of what could have been, but I also feel deep gratitude for those who stood by me, for the lesson that we must never <b>be</b> <b>afraid</b> to ask for help, and for the feeling of summer that still remains.|$|E
5|$|Nuaym {{then came}} up with an {{efficient}} stratagem. He first went to the Banu Qurayza and warned them about the intentions {{of the rest of the}} Confederacy. If the siege fails, he said, the Confederacy will not <b>be</b> <b>afraid</b> to abandon the Jews, leaving them at the mercy of Muhammad. The Qurayza should thus demand Confederate leaders as hostages in return for cooperation. This advice touched upon the fears the Qurayza had already harboured.|$|E
60|$|Nor did {{the bold}} {{cast of the}} boy's mind offset his {{physical}} defects, as it invariably does in the biographies. On the contrary. He <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> of his father.

5|$|Dale {{has also}} made several film appearances. He {{appeared}} as the Romulan Praetor Hiren in Star Trek Nemesis, a part he got after the actor originally cast fell ill, and had small parts in films such as Hollywood Homicide, After the Sunset, and the minor part of General Ross in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Dale said his script for Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was printed on tin foil so {{it was impossible to}} replicate, {{in order to keep the}} film's plot a secret. He appeared in four films released in 2011: A Little Bit of Heaven, Priest, Don't <b>Be</b> <b>Afraid</b> of the Dark, and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, having joined late in the film's production.|$|E
5|$|In 1902 an American {{newspaper}} {{published the}} allegation that Lord Arthur Somerset, having learned {{in some way that}} 19 Cleveland Street was under police surveillance, and that he may have been identified as a visitor, he contrived to bring the Prince to the house on an innocent pretext {{in the hope that the}} police, seeing him cross the threshold, would <b>be</b> <b>afraid</b> to take the case any further. The report alleged the ruse Somerset used was the Prince's fondness for buhl furniture: he invited him to inspect a buhl cabinet which was in the house, and that the Prince remained there no more than five minutes.|$|E
5|$|The cast {{consisted}} {{mostly of}} unknowns, though Isabel Bigley, {{who had just}} originated Sister Sarah Brown in Guys and Dolls, was given the leading role of chorus girl Jeanie. For Larry, the assistant stage manager {{who falls in love}} with Jeanie, they cast Bill Hayes, a well-known stage and television actor. William Tabbert, the original Lt. Joe Cable in South Pacific was considered for the part of Larry, but lost out because he was thought to be too tall to <b>be</b> <b>afraid</b> of Mark Dawson, hired as the towering bully Bob.|$|E

As they approach the cedar mountain, they hear Humbaba bellowing, and have to encourage each other not to <b>be</b> <b>afraid.</b>|$|E

25|$|In the {{continuation}} of the reading, Moses taught that if a legal case proved too baffling for the Israelites to decide, then they were promptly to go to Temple in Jerusalem, appear before the kohenim or judge in charge, and present their problem, and carry out any verdict that was announced there without deviating either to the right or to the left. They were to execute any man who presumptuously disregarded the priest or the judge, so that all the people would hear, <b>be</b> <b>afraid,</b> and not act presumptuously again.
