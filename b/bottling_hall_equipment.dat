40|$|Much of the {{mainstream}} and critical literatures stress the potential of teamwork for normative integration through socialization and peer pressure. This article utilizes case studies in the large <b>bottling</b> <b>halls</b> of spirits producers in Scotland to explore the characteristics of and limits to such integration. A multi-dimensional model of team-work and an examination of both practices and attitudes enables the research to identify the variety of managerial objectives and out-comes across and within the plants. Though the extent of integration varies between the teams, the overall results lead to scepticism about whether team members {{can be considered as}} socially engineered individuals who have internalized company normative demands. These findings, it is argued, are compatible with the majority of comparable case study research...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to analyze the satisfaction of participants in the offered programs of exercise of health and fitness clubs for municipal Youth and Sport organizations. A random sample of 320 participants was selected from 18 closed halls and responded to a questionnaire that was pre-checked for reliability, validity and objectivity (Chen, 2001). The questionnaire included questions related to demographics, participant satisfaction from the exercise programs and from the level of organisation these have, the quality of <b>equipment</b> the athletic <b>halls</b> have and the variety of services offered. Data was analysed statistically to determine the relationships and differences between the mean value of the different variables. Results show that the profile of the major customer segment is women from 26 to 35 years old with University education. Also, statistical analysis shows that there are significant differences between the average values in all 5 dimensions of participant satisfaction: the prices of exercise programs, program content, the quality of <b>hall</b> <b>equipment,</b> public relations and employee performance. Also, there are statistically significant differences between the demographic variables (age, sex, income) and the 5 participant satisfaction dimensions. However, the dimensions that present statistically significant differences vary according to the demographic variable analysed. This shows that municipal sports centres should differentiate their offers according to the dimensions of satisfaction that are more important for each customer segment as these are formed based on age, income or sex...|$|R
