The crash {{resulted}} in her being hospitalised with three lumbar spinal fractures and a severe concussion. Though {{she was out of}} the race due to severe injuries, her team-mate Anna van der Breggen took home the gold medal for the Netherlands. Despite her injuries, van Vleuten was riding a bicycle within ten days of her accident and made a winning return to competition one month later, taking the overall victory and two stage wins at the 2016 Lotto Belisol Belgium Tour.|$|E
40|$|For a small {{electric}} vehicle (EV) with the rear two in-wheel motors, the hydraulic brake {{system and the}} mechanical brake system are installed at {{the front and rear}} tire respectively. The mechanical brake system is used at the rear tire because there is no enough space for the hydraulic brake system. In a braking condition, the in-wheel motor at the rear tire will generate the regenerative braking force and it can improve the braking performance of the vehicle. However, during braking on the low adhesion road surface, anti-lock brake system (ABS) is very crucial to prevent the tire from lock-up. To improve the safety and stability of the vehicle, the combination of anti-skid control system and direct yaw moment control system is proposed. The anti-skid control system contains a hydraulic unit of ABS at the front tires and regenerative <b>brake</b> <b>timing</b> control at the rear tires. The control method of the regenerative <b>brake</b> <b>timing</b> control is same as ABS and it will turn on and off to prevent the tire from lock-up. On the other hand, the direct yaw moment control system is developed to increase the steer performance of the vehicle. The optimal control is used as the control strategy method to control the yaw moment. The simulation is developed in MATLAB Simulink and the result shows that the proposed model can improve the stopping distance from 9 seconds to 8. 2 seconds. In addition, the combination of skid control and yaw moment control also improved the steer performance of the vehicle...|$|E

40|$|The {{relation}} between car-following behaviour and braking performance was studied in a driving simulator. The theoretical perspective was that {{individual differences in}} tactical car-driving behaviour {{may be related to}} skills on the operational level of the driving task via a process of adaptation. In a sample of 16 young and middle-aged experienced drivers independent assessments were made of preferred time headway during car following and of braking skill. Starting from modem theories of visual-motor learning, braking performance was analyzed in terms of a reaction time component, an open-loop visual-motor component, and a closed-loop visual-motor component involving the precise adjustment of <b>braking</b> (<b>timing</b> and force) to the situation. The efficiency of the visual-motor component of braking was a strong and significant predictor of choice of time headway to the lead vehicle {{in such a way that}} less efficient braking indicated a preference for a longer time headway. This result supports the theory of adaptation on the individual level...|$|R

The model applies intermittent brake adjustments to minimize accumulated looming prediction error. It is here applied to the simulation {{of a set of}} lead vehicle scenarios. The imulation results in terms of <b>brake</b> initiation <b>timing</b> and <b>brake</b> jerk are demonstrated to capture well the specific types of kinematics-ependencies that have been recently reported from naturalistic near-crashes and crashes...|$|R
40|$|Brushless DC (BLDC) motors are {{becoming}} an increasingly popular motor {{of choice for}} low powered vehicles such as mopeds, power assisted bicycles, mobility scooters, and in this reported application, motorised mountain boards. With rapid developments in technology, high energy density batteries such as Lithium-ion Polymer batteries {{are becoming}} more affordable and highly suitable for such vehicles due to the superior charge rate and light weight of the lithium chemistry batteries. This combined with the high power, light weight, and low cost BLDC motor results in the BLDC motor being a very favourable solution over an internal combustion engine for low power vehicles with power requirements of up to 7 kW. A BLDC motor controller was developed specifically for the motorised mountain board application. The motor controller is a sensored BLDC motor controller which takes inputs from Hall Effect sensors to determine the rotor position. Many other sensors are used to monitor the variables that are critical to {{the operation of the}} motor controller such as the motor phase current, battery voltage, motor temperature, and transistor temperature. The reported system is further enhanced by several additional features such as output for an LCD screen, regenerative <b>braking,</b> <b>timing</b> advance, cruise control, and soft start functions. These topics are discussed briefly in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Building {{on ideas}} from {{contemporary}} neuroscience, a framework is proposed in which drivers’ steering and pedal behavior is modeled {{as a series}} of individual control adjustments, triggered after accumulation of sensory evidence for the need of an adjustment, or evidence that a previous or ongoing adjustment is not achieving the intended results. Example simulations are provided. Speciﬁcally, it is shown that evidence accumulation can account for previously unexplained variance in looming detection thresholds and <b>brake</b> onset <b>timing.</b> It is argued that the proposed framework resolves a discrepancy in the current driver modeling literature, by explaining not only the short-latency, well-tuned, closed-loop type of control of routine driving, but also the degradation into long-latency, ill-tuned open-loop control in more rare, unexpected, and urgent situations such as near-accidents...|$|R
40|$|Development of the Body Flap Actuation Subsystem for Space Shuttles {{included}} alterations {{from the}} original design to mechanical stops, planet gears, control valves, and solenoid valves. The mechanical stops were redesigned to absorb stall load and rotating inertia of the hydraulic motors instead of only stall load. The institution of a quill shaft (torsion spring) was a successful solution. The planet gears in the geared rotary actuators developed cracks during testing. This failure was alleviated via modification to the gears. A motor pressurization - <b>brake</b> release <b>timing</b> technique was developed thru analysis and testing. This resulted in a control valve configuration which would not permit freewheeling of the body flap surface. Finally, several solenoid valve configurations were tested to obtain the desired performance. Conceptual redesigns and modifications were weighted against each other to optimize a solution. Tradeoffs were usually made between life, performance, failure tolerance, and reliability versus weight, envelope, and maintainability...|$|R
40|$|The {{tests were}} carried out with the spark timing {{adjusted}} to the maximum <b>brake</b> torque <b>timing</b> in various equivalence ratios and engine speeds for gasoline and natural gas operations. In this work, the lower heating value of gasoline is about 13. 6 % {{higher than that of}} natural gas. Based on the experimental results, the natural gas operation causes an increase of about 6. 2 % brake special fuel consumption, 22 % water temperature difference between outlet and inlet engine, 3 % exhaust valve seat temperature, 2. 3 % brake thermal efficiency and a decrease of around 20. 1 % maximum brake torque, 6. 8 % exhaust gas temperature and 19 % lubricating oil temperature when compared to gasoline operation. The results also revealed that, over the entire range of engine speed and equivalence ratios, the exhaust gas temperature and the lubricating oil temperature for gasoline operation is higher than that of natural gas operation while the exhaust valve seat temperature for natural gas operation is higher...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{specific}} heat ratio used in heat release calculations plays {{a crucial role}} in the determination of combustion parameters. In this study, the effects of assumed {{specific heat}} ratio on the heat release analysis of engine pressure data are studied in a spark ignition engine, using natural gas and gasoline fuels. The experiments were carried out with the spark timing adjusted to the maximum <b>brake</b> torque <b>timing,</b> at an equivalence ratio of ϕ= 1 and a speed engine of N= 3300 rpm. The combustion parameters are obtained from the heat release rate, which obtained from the first law of thermodynamics during a cycle. The results show that the combustion parameters have high sensitivity to the variation and first derivative of the specific heat ratio. The results also show that the influence of the first derivative of the specific heat ratio on the combustion parameters for natural gas operation is higher than that for gasoline operation. Moreover, the first derivative of the specific heat ratio for determination of combustion parameters should not be ignored...|$|R

40|$|The wind braking {{model and}} its {{applications}} of magnetars are discussed. The decreasing torque of magnetars during outbursts, anti-glitch, and anti-correlations between radiation and timing are understandable {{in the wind}} <b>braking</b> model. Recent <b>timing</b> observations of magnetars are also consistent with the previous modeling. A magnetism-powered wind nebula and a braking index smaller than three are the two predictions. Besides isolated magnetars, {{there may also be}} accreting magnetars in binary systems and magnetars accreting from fallback disks. Observationally, ultra-luminous X-ray pulsars may be accreting magnetars, while super-slow magnetars may be magnetars with fallback disks in the past.

40|$|Abstract- Efforts {{are being}} made {{throughout}} the World to reduce the consumption of liquid petroleum fuels wherever is possible. Biodiesel is recently gaining prominence {{as a substitute for}} petroleum based diesel mainly due to environmental considerations and depletion of vital resources like petroleum and coal.

This study investigates influence of injection timing of 20 % blend simarouba biodiesel on performance and emission characteristics. The effect of varying injection timing was evaluated in terms of thermal efficiency, specific fuel consumption, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen.

50|$|Water has a {{very high}} heat of vaporization. As the ambient {{temperature}} water is injected into the engine, heat transfers from the hot cylinder head and intake air into the water. This makes it evaporate, cooling the intake charge. A cooler intake charge means it is more dense (higher volumetric efficiency) and also has a lower tendency to knock. However, the water vapor displaces some air, negating some of the denser intake charge benefit. Knocking is generally {{more of a problem}} in forced induction engines rather than naturally aspirated, so this can help prevent it. On electronic ignition systems the ignition timing is generally retarded to prevent knock from occurring but with water injection it can be advanced closer to maximum <b>brake</b> torque (MBT) <b>timing</b> for additional power.|$|R
40|$|Floral biology {{includes}} {{the series of}} processes which leads buds to evolve into flowers and fruits. Improving the knowledge on floral biology in olive is important both for scientific understanding and for practical reasons, since optimizing these applications results in better fruit yield. These processes are: induction (the conversion of vegetative to inflorescence buds), differentiations (the actual formation of flower parts in the bud), floral formation (the formation and evolution of the inflorescence and the flowers after bud <b>brake),</b> flowering (<b>timing,</b> flower types, andromonoecy), pollination, fertilization and compatibility, ovary abortion, fruit set. This papers describes all these steps and discusses the most recent knowledge on olive floral biology, including some recent theories like the “aging” theory, for which a minimum aging of the meristematic apex is necessary to allow floral induction and differentiation, and the “competition” theory, for which the greater competition for resources among flowers in cultivars with larger flower and fruit sizes, explains the greater ovary abortion and reduced fruit set in such cultivars. Finally, the very low fruit set and the apparently redundant flowering in olive is explained in evolutionary terms (mail fitness). The paper ends with concluding remark and practical suggestions for improving fruit yield, and provides answers to frequently asked questions.

Performance, emission and combustion parameters are studied at MBT (Maximum <b>Brake</b> Torque) spark <b>timing</b> with WOT (Wide Open Throttle) position. All trials are performed in the speed range of 1100 rpm– 1800 rpm. Baseline observations are recorded with gasoline for comparison purpose. Results have shown that maximum brake power is reduced by 19. 06 % and peak brake thermal efficiency is increased by 3. 16 % {{in the case of}} hydrogen operation.

40|$|Searches for {{persistent}} gravitational {{radiation from}} nonpulsating neutron stars in young supernova remnants (SNRs) are computationally challenging because of rapid stellar braking. We describe a practical, efficient, semi-coherent search {{based on a}} hidden Markov model (HMM) tracking scheme, solved by the Viterbi algorithm, combined with a maximum likelihood matched filter, the F-statistic. The scheme is well suited to analyzing data from advanced detectors like the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (Advanced LIGO). It can track rapid phase evolution from secular stellar <b>braking</b> and stochastic <b>timing</b> noise torques simultaneously without searching second- and higher-order derivatives of the signal frequency, providing an economical alternative to stack-slide-based semi-coherent algorithms. One implementation tracks the signal frequency alone. A second implementation tracks the signal frequency and its first time derivative.

40|$|Films of pigeons {{flying to}} a perch were {{analysed}} {{to test a}} theory of how speed of approach and timing of foot extension in preparation for landing are visually controlled. Rapid neural computation of distance to perch and of speed and deceleration {{would seem to be}} required. However, according to the theory, none of this is necessary. Simpler control is possible based solely on the value of the tau function of certain optic variables x, where the tau function of xis xdivided by its rate of change; i. e. t(x) =x/x [...] t(x) is a first-order approximation of time to contact with the perch and so could be used for timing foot extension. Controlled braking is possible by simply keeping t. (x), the rate of change of t(x), constant. The results indicated that pigeons did regulate their braking when approaching the perch by keeping t. (x) constant and initiated foot extension when t(x) reached a threshold value of approximately 150 ms. They followed this procedure even when they had one eye covered, and so binocular vision was not necessary for regulating <b>braking</b> or <b>timing</b> foot extension. It is shown that an optic variable that the pigeons could be using is the width of the optic projection of the gap between foot and perch. It is further shown that they could be using the same optic variable for controlling the trajectory of their feet to contact the perch...|$|R

The test results show that: as the EGR ratio changing from 0 (the EGR valve is fully closed) to 43. 8 %(the EGR valve is fully opened), the in-cylinder pressure is decreasing with the EGR ratio increasing; the coefficient of variation in indicated mean effective pressure (imepCOV) is not changing significantly at high load conditions, changing range is less than 1 %; CA 50 is postponed from 11. 8 o CAto 15. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} analyze the effect of {{hydrogen}} rich gas addition (HRG) on lean burn engine’s thermal efficiency and emission, an experimental research was conducted on a gasoline direct injection (GDI) engine using definite fraction of HRG. The results showed that HRG addition could significantly extend the lean operation limit, improve the engine’s lean burn ability, and decrease burn duration. HRG addition 10 %, 18 %, and 30 % extended the lean limit equivalence ratio 0. 62, 0. 58, and 0. 52 respectively. Combustion duration decreased as increasing fraction of HRG due to speed up flame propagation. HC emission decreased with the increasing fraction of HRG upto equivalence ratio 0. 6 due to higher cylinder temperatures {{making it easier to}} burn lean mixtures. But thereafter HC emissions steadily increased despite of HRG addition as amount of fuel in regions was very lean to burn during primary combustion process. The same trend was observed in CO emission. However, nitrogen oxides (NOx) were found to increase with HRG addition because of hydrogen’s high burn speed. Thermal efficiency increased 3 % with addition of HRG at equivalence ratio 0. 7. The experimental results showed that the maximum <b>brake</b> torque <b>timing</b> (MBT), air fuel ratio and HRG supplementation were implied significant influence on lean limit operation, burn durations, thermal efficiency and exhaust emission. It was concluded that taking advantage of hydrogen’s high burn speed, obviously spark timing has to be retarded to MBT for substantial reduction of NOx emissions and further increase of engine’s thermal efficiency...|$|R

A large number of experimental studies are reported to study the thermal performance of biodiesels used in diesel engines operated at constant compression ratio and constant injection pressure. In these studies the effect of load, blend, speed, injection <b>timing,</b> <b>brake</b> power, etc on thermal performance and emission characteristics are studied. The fields of optimization on VCRE performance at various CR have emerged as areas of research in recent times. It is found that very few studies are reported in these areas.

40|$|The {{chemical}} and physical limits of cycle-to-cycle combustion variability and engine out emissions of a gasoline port fuelled {{spark ignition engine}} have been investigated. The experimental investigations were carried out on a V 8 engine with port fuel injection and variable intake valve timing. The chemical limits of stable combustion {{have been shown to}} be a function of burned gas, fuel and air mixture. The widest limit, gas fuel ratio of 9 was found at maximum <b>brake</b> torque spark <b>timing.</b> Retarding the spark timing by 10 oCA caused a small reduction in the stable area, 20 oCA retard reduced the stable combustion area significantly, whereby stable combustion occurred within an area of gas fuel ratio of 10. Burn rate analysis indicated increased variability in both the flame development and rapid burn period. The increase in variability in the rapid burn period is greater than that associated with the flame development. The variability is magnified from flame development through the rapid burn phase. This finding was consistent for unstable combustion caused by exceeding {{chemical and}} physical limits. Engine out emissions were investigated and characterised using engine global state parameters, for example AFR, burned gas fraction, for both stable and unstable combustion conditions. Carbon monoxide and oxides of nitrogen emissions correlations were unaffected by the presence of unstable combustion events whereas hydrocarbon emissions showed a significant increase.
