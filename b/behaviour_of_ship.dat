40|$|The paper reports {{some results}} {{on the issue of}} the {{thickness}} influence on the fatigue strength of welded joints. It is indeed well known that the recommendations of the current Codes used for ship structures are based on the results obtained for quite thick plates, and are applied also to relatively thin plates. For thicknesses greater than 25 mm a “thickness reduction factor” is considered, while no “thinness effect bonus” is foreseen for small thicknesses. A series of experimental tests has been carried out in order to investigate the response to high-cycle fatigue of butt-welded joints of thickness less than 25 mm. In order to avoid time-consuming procedures, the analyses have been performed resorting to the Thermographic Method, already successfully adopted to predict the fatigue <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> <b>ship</b> structures...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{surface tension}} {{of water is}} a key {{parameter}} for assessing the degree of contamination of harbours, ports and open waters. However standard methods of measuring surface tension do so at the flat air/water interface {{at the top of}} a body of water, whereas in for many important processes, this is not the manifestation of surface tension that is most important. For biogenic decomposition, air/sea gas exchange, the production of aerosols (all three of which are known to be important for climate on a global scale), as well as the <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> <b>ship</b> wakes and their effects (in distributing contaminants in the water column, affecting the local sound field or the ship’s acoustic signature), and in the harvesting and transportation of petrochemicals, it is the surface tension on the wall of bubbles within the water column that matters. This paper explores a technique that can measure the surface tension on a bubble wall, and compares it with the surface tension measured at the air/water interface. Any difference would mean that modelling of the above effects, based on measurements of surface tension on the flat air/water interface, would contain systematic errors with global implications...|$|E

40|$|International audienceCurrent {{maritime}} traffic monitoring systems are essentials for a maritime situational awareness. However, {{they are not}} always adapted to the identification <b>of</b> risky <b>behaviours</b> <b>of</b> <b>ships.</b> It {{is very difficult for}} operators responsible for monitoring traffic to identify which vessels are at risk among all the shipping traffic displayed on their screen. We present in this paper a hybrid approach for analysing dangerous <b>behaviours</b> <b>of</b> <b>ships</b> based on AIS data. This approach is based on supervised and unsupervised analyses and it was developed in the frame of PhDs. Our approach is based on three complementary methodologies: (1) data mining for knowledge and pattern extraction for behaviour modelling, (2) ontological modelling <b>of</b> <b>behaviour</b> for an unsupervised detection and (3) geovisual analysis of large volume of data for a supervised detection of threats at sea. Three prototypes were developed to test our approach...|$|R

40|$|The {{accuracy}} and reliability of structural analyses are significantly compromised owing to the utilization of simple beam elements to model the global mechanical <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> <b>ship</b> hulls. These 1 D models entail various assumptions and do not provide accurate and reliable results for hulls with complex structural details, such as cut-outs or reinforcements. The 3 D FEM solutions, on the other hand, are computationally expensive. In the present study, refined 1 D FE models {{for the analysis of}} simplified naval engineering structures have been developed by using the well-known Carrera Unified Formulation (CUF). According to CUF, refined kinematics beam models that go beyond classical theories (Euler, Timoshenko) can be easily developed by expressing the displacement field as an expansion in terms of generic functions, whose form and order are arbitrary. Hence, the stiffness and mass matrices are written in terms of fundamental nuclei, which are independent of the adopted class of beam theory and the FE approximation along the beam axis. As a particular class of CUF models, Lagrange polynomials have been used to formulate beam models at the component scale. According to this approach, each structural component (e. g. hull, longerons, bulkheads, and floors) can be modelled by means of the same 1 D formulation. The results clearly demonstrate the enhanced capabilities of the proposed formulation, which is able to replicate solid/shell ANSYS solutions with very low computational effort...|$|E
40|$|Environmental {{legislation}} to protect North and Baltic Sea areas from harmful vessel-source emissions has received increased political attention in recent years. Legislative measures {{are expected to}} show positive effects {{on the health of}} the marine environment and society. At the same time, compliance might increase the costs to industry and have effects on freight rates and volumes shipped with potential negative repercussions on the environment. Building on an exploratory sequential mixed methods approach, this research project will study the economic effects of maritime environmental legislation in two phases. In Phase I, exploratory in-depth interviews were conducted with 12 experts from various stakeholder groups aiming at identifying variables influencing the relationship between environmental legislation, freight rates and volumes shipped. Influencing factors like compliance, enforcement and modal shift were identified and studied. Phase II will comprise of a quantitative study conducted with the aim of verifying the theory build in Phase I and quantifying economic effects of rules on shipping pollution.

40|$|The use of sensor {{networks}} {{has been}} proposed for military surveillance and environmental monitoring applications. Those systems are composed of a heterogeneous set of sensors to observe the environment. In centralised systems the observed data will be conveyed to the control room to process the data. Human operators are supposed to give a semantic interpretation of the observed data. They are searching for suspicious or unwanted behaviour. The increase of surveillance sensors in the military domain requires {{a huge amount of}} human operators which is far beyond available resources. Automated systems are needed to give a context sensitive semantic interpretation of the observed kinematic data. As a proof of concept two automatic surveillance projects will be discussed in this paper. The first project is about a centralised system based on the AISAutomated Identification System which will be used to monitor ship movements automatically. The second project is about a decentralised system composed of a network of cameras installed at a military area. There is a need for a surveillance system along the coast of Europe. There is an increase of illegal drugs transport from the open sea, intrusion of boat refuges, illegal fishing, pollution of the sea by illegal chemical and oil pollution by ships. An automated sensor system is needed to detect illegal intruders and suspicious ship movements. Vessels fitted with AIS transceivers and transponders can be tracked by AIS base stations located along coast lines or, when out of range of terrestrial networks, through a growing number of satellites that are fitted with special AIS receivers. AIS data include a unique identifier of a vessel and kinematic data such as its position, course and speed. The proposed system enables identification, and tracking of vessels and to detect unwanted or illegal <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> <b>ship</b> movements. If ships violate traffic rules, enter forbidden areas or approach a critical infrastructure an alert will be generated automatically in the control room. Human operators start an emergency procedure. The second project is about a network of cameras installed at a military area. The area is monitored by multiple cameras with non-overlapping field of views monitored by human operators. We developed an automated surveillance system. At the entrance gate the identity of visitors will be checked by a face recognition system. In case of intruders, unwanted behaviour, trouble makers the emotional state of the visitor will be assessed by an analysis of facial expressions using the Active Appearance model. If unwanted behaviour is detected an alert is send the control room. Also license place of cars will be recognized using a system based on Neocognitron Neural Networks. Moving objects as persons and vehicles will be detected, localized and tracked. Kinematic parameters are extracted and a semantic interpretation of their behaviour is automatically generated using a rule based system and Bayesian networks. Cars violating the traffic rules or passing speed limits or entering forbidden areas or stopping/parking at forbidden places will be detected. A prototype of a system has been developed which is able to monitor the area 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Scienc...|$|E

The different strategies <b>of</b> <b>shipping</b> lines, the balance <b>of</b> power between <b>shipping</b> lines and shippers and constraints related to inland transportation all have a potential impact on the development <b>of</b> maritime <b>shipping</b> networks. Moreover, strategic alliances between the port and the shipping industry, which have both been driven by strong concentration processes and vertical integration, have a profound influence on the maritime network structure and also on the grade of integration of a region in the global maritime transport network. This paper seeks to understand the evolution of maritime networks in and between two differently developed regions. The {{focus is on the}} trade route and networks between the West Coast of South America and Northern Europe. The paper analyses the network structures and the <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> <b>shipping</b> lines in different economic contexts and port systems.

The authors aim to answer the question of how far the configuration of hinterlands determines calling patterns and if strategic alliances and vertical integration reduce footloose <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> <b>shipping</b> lines. Further, we discuss how far, under the current configuration, shipping lines influence port development, and also the reverse situation of how far port accessibility and performance influence maritime network developments.
