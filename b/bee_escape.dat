40|$|Pesticides can harm {{honey bee}} health and {{foraging}} behavior, even when bees {{are exposed to}} sublethal doses. We tested the effect of imidacloprid, a common neonicotinoid pesticide, on honey bee avoidance of danger during foraging in indoor and outdoor feeder choice trials. Danger stimuli consisted of honey bee sting gland alarm pheromone or live praying mantises. In outdoor foraging experiments in which bees chose between two feeders, bees fed repeatedly upon sucrose solution containing a high but field-realistic concentration of 40 μg/L imidacloprid. However, there was no effect of pesticide treatment. Neither pesticide nor control bees demonstrated significant avoidance of the live mantis (P≥ 0. 63 for non pesticide bees and P≥ 0. 42 for pesticide bees). In contrast, control bees avoided the alarm pheromone feeder in all three consecutive choices (P≤ 0. 01). Pesticide-treated bees avoided the alarm pheromone feeder only on their second choice (P= 0. 004). There was no significant overall effect of pesticide treatment in this experiment. In indoor trials designed to mimic outdoor foraging under controlled conditions, bees exposed to 1 ng or 2. 16 ng of imidacloprid spent 16 - 26 % less time {{on the side of}} the indoor arena with alarm pheromone as compared to control bees. These trials possibly presented a different context: bees attempting to escape rather than forage. Overall, our results do not provide strong support for the hypothesis that imidacloprid alters bee decision-making about danger in the context of foraging, though the indoor trials suggest a new avenue of investigation into the effects of imidacloprid on honey <b>bee</b> <b>escape</b> behavior...|$|E

He garnered evidence against this claim from his dissections. By examining larvae, he identified underdeveloped adult features in pre-adult animals.

40|$|Manyoni {{district}} has high beekeeping potential {{due to the}} presence of virgin forest (mainly miombo woodlands and Itigi thickets). Research project was carried out in Aghondi village in Manyoni district to assess beekeeping activities as a source of income and environmental conservation. The project were identified through community needs assessment, where during the research process both qualitative and quantitative together with Participatory Rural Appraisal research methodology, data collection tools such as interviews, observations, and focus group discussion were employed, that lead to prioritization and identification of the core problem. The project implementation was done based on the prioritization need and the evaluations which were done within six months after project phased out. Activities implemented was one day awareness creation to Aghondi community on beekeeping activities, This was followed by training of beekeepers groups members on project and financial management, training on existing beekeepers groups to increase knowledge of modern/commercial beekeeping, purchase of 20 modern and 30 log/bark hives and beekeeping kits. Conclusion, beekeeping is a good project for rural people whose they don’t have enough income.

40|$|Even at {{sublethal}} doses, neonicotinoids, {{commonly used}} insecticides can affect neurons involved in learning and memory, cognitive features that {{play a key}} role in colony fitness because they facilitate foraging. The commonly used neonicotinoid, imidacloprid, impairs the ability of bees to associate floral odors with a nectar reward. However, no studies, to date, have examined how if imidacloprid impairs negative associative learning. Sit- and-wait predators like spiders can attack foraging bees. Because <b>bees</b> can <b>escape</b> such attacks, learning to avoid dangerous foraging sites should enhance their survival. Negative associative learning classically uses electric shock as the punishing stimulus, although this is not natural. To better mimic predation, we developed a robo- predator so we consistently attack foragers with a pinching bite at a fixed force. Also, all prior aversive learning studies have used single, pure odors to test learning. We challenged bees with a more natural task and used the sting extension reflex (SER=the unconditioned response) to show that they can learn to associate an aversive biting stimulus with the complex odors of different Thymus vulgaris chemotypes. Bees exhibited a two fold higher SER response to the odors of punished as compared to non-punished chemotypes in short- and longer- term learning tests. Finally, we show that chronic exposure over 4 days to a sublethal concentration (25. 56 [mu]g/L= 20. 79 ppb) significantly impairs negative short- term and longer-term learning. Control bees show 8 fold better short-term learning and longer-term learning than imidacloprid-treated bees. The impact of neonicotinoids on aversive learning and how bees avoid danger should therefore be more widely considere...|$|R
50|$|Bucket orchids are an {{excellent}} example of coevolution and mutualism, as the orchids have evolved along with orchid bees (the tribe Euglossini of the family Apidae) and both depend on each other for reproduction. One to three flowers are borne on a pendant stem that comes {{from the base of the}} pseudobulbs. The flower secretes a fluid (see Coryanthes alborosea picture) into the flower lip, which is shaped like a bucket. The male orchid bees (not the females) are attracted to the flower by a strong scent from aromatic oils, which they store in specialized spongy pouches inside their swollen hind legs, as they appear to use the scent in their courtship dances in order to attract females. The bees, trying to get the waxy substance containing the scent, sometimes fall to the fluid-filled bucket. As they are trying to escape, they find that there are some small knobs on which they can climb on, while the rest of the lip is lined with smooth, downward-pointing hairs, upon which their claws cannot find a grip. The knobs lead to a spout (see the Coryanthes leucocorys picture), but as the bee is trying to escape, the spout constricts. At that same moment, the small packets containing the pollen of the orchid get pressed against the thorax of the bee. However, the glue on the pollen packets does not set immediately, so the orchid keeps the bee trapped until the glue has set. Once the glue has set, the bee is let free and he can now dry his wings and fly off. His ordeal may have taken as long as forty-five minutes. Hopefully, the bee will go to another flower, where, if the flower is to be successful at reproducing, the bee falls once again into the bucket of the same species. This time the pollen packets get stuck to the stigma as the <b>bee</b> is <b>escaping,</b> and after a while the orchid will produce a seed pod.|$|R
40|$|In {{the course}} of their {{foraging}} bouts, bees frequently encounter spider webs among the vegetation. The ability to see and avoid these webs is vital for the success of the individual bee's foraging bout. In this study, we report on the response of stingless bees (Trigona carbonaria) towards the webs of the St. Andrew's Cross spider (Argiope keyserlingi). We studied the ability of bees to avoid webs in different contexts: when bees were on their foraging path or when they were returning to the hive as well as when they were flying North or South. We show that the probability of a bee being able to avoid a web depends on the context of the bee's flight rather than the visual appearance of the web. Furthermore, the presence of the spider seems to alert the bee to the web, resulting in bees being more able to avoid capture. We show, specifically, that the probability of being captured is higher when the bee is returning to the hive compared with when the bee is foraging. The likelihood of avoiding a web is also influenced by the compass direction of the flight, although to a lesser extent. Our results indicate that the context of the predator-prey encounter has a significant influence on a <b>bee's</b> ability to <b>escape</b> interception by a spider web. 8 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Members of the bee family Megachilidae exhibit {{fascinating}} behavior {{related to}} nesting, floral preference, and cleptoparasitic strategy. In order {{to explore the}} evolution of these behaviors, I assembled a large, multi-locus molecular data set for the bee family Megachilidae and used maximum likelihood-, Bayesian-, and maximum parsimony-based analytical methods to trace the evolutionary history of the family. I present the first molecular-based phylogenetic hypotheses of relationships within Megachilidae and use biogeographic analyses, ancestral state reconstructions, and divergence dating and diversification rate analyses to date the antiquity of Megachilidae and to explore patterns of diversification, nesting behavior and floral preferences in the family. I find that two ancient lineages of megachilid bees exhibit behavior and biology which reflect those of the earliest bees: they are solitary, restricted to deserts, build unlined nests, and are host-plant specialists. I suggest {{that the use of}} foreign material in nest construction allowed early megachilid <b>bees</b> to <b>escape</b> their ancestral desert habitat and colonize temperate, previously uninhabitable areas. In order to further examine phylogenetic relationships among tribes of the family Megachilidae, I develop a novel bootstrapping algorithm designed to balance the signal from combined molecular-morphological datasets; I use the results of all phylogenetic analyses to propose a new subfamilial- and tribal-level classification for Megachilidae and present a revised key to the tribes of Megachilidae. I also reconstruct the evolutionary history of the tribe Anthidiini and offer the first molecular-based phylogenetic hypothesis of the generic and suprageneric relationships within Anthidiini based on maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses. I trace the evolutionary history of nesting behavior, the origins of cleptoparasitism, and the evolution of cleptoparasitic strategy in the megachilid tribe Anthidiini using Bayesian ancestral state reconstructions. Our results indicate three suprageneric clades within Anthidiini: the Trachusa group, the Anthidium group, and the Dianthidium group; each of these groups shows a distinct preference for either plant fibers or plant resins as a primary nest-building material. Our phylogeny supports two origins of cleptoparasitism in Anthidiini and also supports the hypothesis that cleptoparasitic lineages with hospicidal adults are an evolutionary intermediate between nest-building bees and cleptoparasitic lineages with hospicidal larvae...|$|R
40|$|The {{honey bee}} is an {{excellent}} visual learner, but we know little about how and why it performs so well, or how visual information is learned by the bee brain. Here we examined the different roles of two key integrative regions of the brain in visual learning: the mushroom bodies and the central complex. We tested bees' learning performance in a new assay of color learning that used electric shock as punishment. In this assay a light field was paired with electric shock. The {{other half of the}} conditioning chamber was illuminated with light of a different wavelength and not paired with shocks. The unrestrained bee could run away from the light stimulus and thereby associate one wavelength with punishment, and the other with safety. We compared learning performance of bees in which either the central complex or mushroom bodies had been transiently inactivated by microinjection of the reversible anesthetic procaine. Control <b>bees</b> learned to <b>escape</b> the shock-paired light field and to spend more time in the safe light field after a few trials. When ventral lobe neurons of the mushroom bodies were silenced, bees were no longer able to associate one light field with shock. By contrast, silencing of one collar region of the mushroom body calyx did not alter behavior in the learning assay in comparison to control treatment. Bees with silenced central complex neurons did not leave the shock-paired light field in the middle trials of training, even after a few seconds of being shocked. We discussed how mushroom bodies and the central complex both contribute to aversive visual learning with an operant component...|$|R

While visitors to flowers of C. montanum represented three insect orders, at two sites, over four seasons only small- to medium-sized, solitary bees (5 - 10 mm in length) carried the pollen massulae. Bee-visitation occurred at both sites and began within 24 - 48 hours following labellum expansion. Female bees in the genus Lasioglossum (Halictidae) were the most common carriers of massulae.
