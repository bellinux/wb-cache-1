Hence, it is important to evaluate the mechanical behavior of columns in case of <b>biaxial</b> <b>bending</b> combined with fire and to provide guidelines for fire resistance design. In this paper, first a simplified method proposed by Bresler is presented for design under ambient temperature in order to predict the interaction curves of concrete columns subjected to <b>biaxial</b> <b>bending</b> and axial loading, based on a calculation of the uniaxial bending capacity. In order to verify whether this method can be adopted in case of fire, a cross-sectional calculation tool is introduced and validated with experimental data. Further, the results from the simplified method are compared with those obtained with the calculation tool. Subsequently, the simplified method is elaborated further in order {{to take into account the}} effect of an ISO 834 standard fire for a column loaded by a symmetrical biaxial load. Finally, the results of a parametric study are presented. Suggestions are given for implementing this method for design of relatively short concrete columns subjected to <b>biaxial</b> <b>bending</b> in case of an ISO 834 fire...|$|E

40|$|Available {{capacity}} {{models for}} the assessment of seismic capacity of reinforced concrete columns are mainly based on experimental tests under axial load and uniaxial bending. Furthermore, experimental tests have been mainly performed on columns representative of new constructions. In order to analyze the effects of <b>biaxial</b> <b>bending</b> on the seismic performances of existing r. c. columns with design characteristics non-conforming to present day seismic codes and practices, the paper presents the results of a first stage of tests on r. c columns under both axial load and <b>biaxial</b> <b>bending,</b> which effectively simulate the seismic actions. In particular, the paper presents results of four tests on full scale square columns reinforced with plain bars, subjected to constant axial load and biaxial cyclic actions. Two different cyclic displacement paths were investigated: horizontal displacements with an inclination angle of 45 or 30 with respect to the cross section principal axes. The influence of <b>biaxial</b> <b>bending</b> actions on the global behavior of existing r. c. columns in terms of stiffness, strength, and deformation capacity as well as the effects of different horizontal displacements orientation on their performances are herein investigated and discussed; the comparison with experimental outcomes provided by uniaxial bending tests on companion specimens are also presented. Experimental findings showed that <b>biaxial</b> <b>bending</b> actions affect columns rotational capacity more than strength.

40|$|Device {{applications}} of shape memory polymers demand diverse shape changing geometries, which are currently limited to non-omnidirectional movement. This restriction originates from traditional thermomechanical programming {{methods such as}} uniaxial, <b>biaxial</b> stretching, <b>bending,</b> or compression. A solvent-modulated programming method is reported to achieve an omnidirectional shape memory behavior. The method utilizes freeze drying of hydrogels of polyethylene glycol networks with a melting transition temperature around 50 °C in their dry state. Such a process creates temporarily fixed macroporosity, which collapses upon heating, leading to significant omnidirectional shrinkage. These shrunken materials can swell in water to form hydrogels again and the omnidirectional programming and recovery can be repeated. The fixity ratio (R f) and recovery ratio (R r) can be maintained at 90 % and 98 % respectively upon shape memory multicycling. The maximum linear recoverable strain, as limited by the maximum swelling, is ≈ 90 %. Amongst various application potentials, one can envision the fabrication of multiphase composites by taking advantages of the omnidirectional shrinkage from a porous polymer to a denser structure...|$|R

This paper presents the thermoelastic degradation of general cross-ply laminates, containing transverse ply cracks, subjected to <b>biaxial</b> extension, <b>bending</b> and thermal loading. The stress and displacement fields are calculated by using the state space equation method [Zhang D, Ye JQ, Sheng HY.

By this approach, a laminated plate may be composed of an arbitrary number of orthotropic layers, each of which may have different material properties and thickness. The method takes into account all independent material constants and guarantees continuous fields of all interlaminar stresses across interfaces between material layers. After introducing the concept of the effective thermoelastic properties of a laminate, the degradations of axial elastic moduli, Poisson¿s ratios, thermal expansion coefficients and flexural moduli are predicted and compared with numerical results from other methods or available test results.

Consideration of the second gradient of deformation such as in couples stress continuum theories addresses the size dependency that is observed in such porous structures.

The elastic mechanical constants of the effective couple-stress continuum are deduced at the representative volume element level by an equivalent strain energy method.
