In south-eastern Australia, <b>broad-headed</b> <b>snakes</b> Hoplocephalus bungaroides (Elapidae) lie in wait under sun-warmed rocks to ambush velvet geckos Oedura leseuerii (Gekkonidae). Previous laboratory work has shown that both the geckos and the snakes actively select hotter rather than colder rocks, and that the snakes actively select rocks scented by geckos. We manipulated rock temperature {{and the presence of}} two types of cues from geckos (chemical and visual information) to clarify the causal basis for foraging site selection by the juveniles of this snake. When given a choice between cold lizard-scented rocks and hot unscented rocks, our captive snakes gave a higher priority to lizard scent than to temperature. The snakes also selected shelter-sites that provided visual as well as scent cues from lizards, rather than shelter-sites with scent cues alone. Thus, although <b>broad-headed</b> <b>snakes</b> show a direct preference for hotter rather than colder rocks in the laboratory, their choice of foraging site in the field may also be influenced by the presence of scent cues from prey.

40|$|Organisms {{selecting}} retreat sites may evaluate {{not only}} {{the quality of the}} specific shelter, but also the proximity of that site to resources in the surrounding area. Distinguishing between habitat selection at these two spatial scales is complicated by co-variation among microhabitat factors (i. e., the attributes of individual retreat sites often correlate with their proximity to landscape features). Disentangling this co-variation may facilitate the restoration or conservation of threatened systems. To experimentally examine the role of landscape attributes in determining retreat-site quality for saxicolous ectotherms, we deployed 198 identical artificial rocks in open (sun-exposed) sites on sandstone outcrops in southeastern Australia, and recorded faunal usage of those retreat sites over the next 29 months. Several landscape-scale attributes were associated with occupancy of experimental rocks, but different features were important for different species.

To obtain such information, we surgically implanted miniature radio transmitters in 25 individual <b>broad-headed</b> <b>snakes</b> Hoplocephalus bungaroides, a small (mean snout-vent length = 57 cm, mean mass = 51 g) viviparous elapid snake reliant upon sandstone outcrops in southeastern Australia. We also carried out a mark-recapture study of this threatened species. Our telemetered snakes spent long periods of time sequestered inside retreat-sites (rocks, crevices, tree hollows) and thus were active on only 21 % of days. Gravid females had small home ranges (mean size = 0 · 05 ha, convex polygon method) and remained near cliffs during summer, whereas most males and non-gravid females moved long distances (up to 780 m) away from cliff tops during summer and had larger home ranges (mean size = 3 · 3 ha). Movements by the snakes were more frequent and extensive when they were in the woodland (mean interval between successive moves = 2 · 9 days; mean displacement per move = 159 m) than when they were in the rock outcrops (means = 6 · 3 days, 37 m). Home ranges were larger in summer than in spring, and were larger in 1994 – 95 than in other years. Home ranges of males showed little spatial or temporal overlap in spring, but females were found within the areas used by males. During summer there was little temporal or spatial overlap of home ranges of adults, which suggests that snakes may actively avoid conspecifics of either sex while foraging in the forest. Many adult snakes showed strong site fidelity, frequently returning to the same rocks where they were initially captured. Dispersal of juvenile snakes from their birth sites was relatively limited (maximum recorded distance = 375 m after 6 months). Our results have significant implications for conservation of this threatened taxon. The fixed home ranges and high site fidelity of adults coupled with the low dispersal rates of juvenile <b>broad-headed</b> <b>snakes</b> mitigate against successful natural recolonisation of rehabilitated habitats. Thus, habitat restoration may need to be combined with release of captive-bred progeny, or field-caught neonates. The exclusive home ranges of adult snakes suggest that social interactions (avoidance of conspecifics) may limit population densities, and hence that (i) removal of some neonates may not reduce future densities of adults, and (ii) habitat destruction {{is likely to be a}} more serious long-term threat than removal or killing of individual snakes.

40|$|Vertebrates that destroy or disturb {{habitats}} used {{by other}} animals may influence habitat selection by sympatric taxa. In south-east Australian forests, superb lyrebirds (Menura novaehollandiae) displace soil, leaf litter and rocks during their daily foraging activities.

To estimate {{the frequency of}} lyrebird rock disturbance, and to assess whether lyrebirds also attack small snakes, we placed 900 plasticine snake replicas under stones on rock and soil substrates along transects on three sandstone plateaux. Because juvenile snakes must select retreat sites that simultaneously allow them to thermoregulate and minimize predation risk, we quantified the thermal environments underneath stones on rock and soil substrates. During the 6 -week experiment, animals disturbed rocks on soil substrates twice as often (16. 9 %) as rocks lying on rock substrates (8. 2 %). Disturbed rocks were significantly smaller and lighter than undisturbed rocks on both substrates. Lyrebirds were the major agents of disturbance, and attacked 40 % of snake models under disturbed rocks. Rocks on soil substrates conferred the greatest thermal benefits to snakes, but both species of snake avoided these microhabitats in the field. Instead, juvenile snakes selected rocks on rock substrates, and sheltered under stones that were too heavy for superb lyrebirds to disturb.

The <b>broad-headed</b> <b>snake</b> (Hoplocephalus bungaroides) has become Australia 2 ̆ 7 s most endangered snake due to a dependence on rock habitats that are subject to high rates of human-induced degradation. The permanence of degradation can only be reversed by outcrop restoration.

We confirmed that habitat value was restored: lizard prey of the <b>broad-headed</b> <b>snake</b> was more abundant in constructed compared to natural outcrops; broad-headed snakes were detected equally in constructed and natural outcrops.

40|$|Many prey {{species are}} faced with {{multiple}} predators that differ {{in the degree of}} danger posed. The threat-sensitive predator avoidance hypothesis predicts that prey should assess the degree of threat posed by different predators and match their behavior according to current levels of risk. To test this prediction, we compared the behavioral responses of nocturnal velvet geckos, Oedura lesueurii, to chemicals from 2 snakes that pose different threats: the dangerous <b>broad-headed</b> <b>snake</b> Hoplocephalus bungaroides that eats geckos and the less dangerous small-eyed snake Cryptophis nigrescens that eats skinks (i. e., does not consume geckos). We also tested whether predator avoidance by prey was modulated by thermal costs associated with retreat-site selection. In both the presence and absence of thermal costs, velvet geckos avoided crevices scented by both dangerous and less dangerous snake species. When given the choice between a crevice scented by a <b>broad-headed</b> <b>snake</b> and a crevice scented by a small-eyed snake, most geckos avoided either retreat site. These results suggest that velvet geckos treat both snake predators as equally dangerous. To further explore these results, we quantified patterns of retreat-site selection by free-living velvet geckos on 2 sandstone plateaux. As in the laboratory, velvet geckos avoided thermally suitable rocks previously used by both snake species. Hence, a gecko's choice of retreat site is influenced by the presence of snake chemicals but is independent of thermal costs or the level of danger posed by the predator.

We tested these predictions with data on two species of sympatric, saurophagous, small-bodied, viviparous elapid snakes: the <b>broad-headed</b> <b>snake,</b> Hoplocephalus bungaroides, and the small-eyed snake, Rhinoplocephalus nigrescens. Demographic parameters and growth curves for both species were estimated from a long-term (9 years) mark-recapture study in Morton National Park, south-eastern Australia. The ambush predator (H. bungaroides) displayed slower juvenile growth and later maturation (5 years for males, 6 years for females) than did the active forager (R. nigrescens, 3 years). Litter sizes were similar in both species, but reproductive frequency was higher in R. nigrescens (90 – 100 %) than in H. bungaroides (50 %). Juvenile survival was lower in the active searcher (31 %) than in the ambush forager (55 %), but adult survivorship was similar (74 % vs 82 %). Our results {{support the hypothesis that}} ambush foragers display ‘slow’ life history traits, but additional phylogenetically independent comparisons are needed to evaluate the generality of this pattern.

40|$|Conservation {{reserves}} are commonly relied on {{as a primary}} means of conserving threatened species. We conducted surveys for the endangered <b>Broad-headed</b> <b>Snake</b> Hoplocephalus bungaroides across 236 sites in 10 conservation reserves of the Sydney region, to assess the present day distribution of this species. Surveys were targeted at rock outcrops, which provide critical shelter sites during the year. Sites were stratified {{on the basis of}} proximity to walking tracks and roads as a surrogate for potential anthropogenic disturbance. Despite the apparent suitability of much of the habitat surveyed, few Broad-headed Snakes were detected and in only four of the reserves. This confirms the rarity of this species and suggests that apparent habitat suitability within conservation reserves is an inadequate basis on which to conclude that a species may be reasonably conserved. Habitat disturbance was common across the reserves, often irrespective of distance from tracks and roads. Much of this disturbance appeared to be due to activities associated with hikers and reptile poachers, rather than rock thieves as previously postulated. The abundance of loose rocks (total rocks, snake preferred rocks) varied across reserves but was not related to distance to tracks and roads, or greater at sites where snakes were detected. We conclude that the conservation needs of this species are more urgent than previously reported...|$|E
40|$|A {{detailed}} {{understanding of}} how extensively animals move through the landscape, and the habitat features upon which they rely, can identify conservation priorities and thus inform management planning. For many endangered species, information on habitat use either is sparse, or is based upon studies from {{a small part of}} the species ’ range. The <b>broad-headed</b> <b>snake</b> (Hoplocephalus bungaroides) is restricted to a specialized habitat (sandstone outcrops and nearby forests) within a small geographic range in south-eastern Australia. Previous research on this endangered taxon was done at a single site in the extreme south of the species ’ geographic range. We captured and radio-tracked 9 adult broad-headed snakes at sites in the northern part of the species ’ distribution, to evaluate the generality of results from prior studies, and to identify critical habitat components for this northern population. Snakes spent most of winter beneath sun-warmed rocks then shifted to tree hollows in summer. Thermal regimes within retreat-sites support the hypothesis that this shift is thermally driven. Intervals between successive displacements were longer than in the southern snakes but dispersal distances per move and home ranges were similar. Our snakes showed non-random preferences both in terms of macrohabitat (e. g., avoidance of some vegetation types) and microhabitat (e. g., frequent use of hollow-bearing trees). Despite many consistencies, the ecology of this species differs enough between southern and northern extremes of its range tha...|$|E
