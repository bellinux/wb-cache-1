5|$|During a Whipple's procedure, {{commonly}} used to treat pancreatic cancer <b>by</b> <b>removing</b> <b>the</b> pancreas, duodenum, {{and part of the}} jejunum, the ligament of Treitz is separated from the duodenum and preserved. When the remaining jejunum is anastamosed with the pylorus of the stomach, it may be passed through the ligament.|$|E
50|$|Vertical {{force is}} {{transmitted}} from the opposed trunk style pistons to either an upper or lower crankshaft. The two crank shafts are geared together by a vertical drive shaft. Pistons are <b>removed</b> <b>by</b> either <b>removing</b> <b>the</b> top crankshaft, and <b>removing</b> from <b>the</b> top, or <b>by</b> <b>removing</b> through <b>the</b> lower crank case access doors.|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> 2 -CP <b>removed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{entire system}} was the {{summation}} of <b>the</b> 2 -CP <b>removed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> biofilm and the adsorption by activated carbon. Figure  11 f shows {{the amount of}} 2 -CP <b>removed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> entire system, activated carbon, and biofilm in a BAC process. Since 2 -CP <b>removed</b> <b>by</b> adsorption does not change its chemical structure, the amount of 2 -CP <b>removed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> activated carbon also equals the amount of 2 -CP that remains adsorbed in the activated carbon.|$|R

5|$|The chassis {{was used}} for both a command tank (Panzerbefehlswagen 35(t)) which {{featured}} extra radios (20 built) and also as an artillery tractor (Artillerie Schlepper 35(t)) <b>by</b> <b>removing</b> <b>the</b> turret and upper hull and covering the gap with canvas (49 converted from March 42 onwards).|$|E
5|$|Another {{concern is}} the fact that {{sugarcane}} fields are traditionally burned just before harvest to avoid harm to the workers, <b>by</b> <b>removing</b> <b>the</b> sharp leaves and killing snakes and other harmful animals, and also to fertilize the fields with ash. Mechanization will reduce pollution from burning fields and has higher productivity than people, and due to mechanization the number of temporary workers in the sugarcane plantations has already declined. By the 2008 harvest season, around 47% of the cane was collected with harvesting machines.|$|E
5|$|Following the urgings of Superintendent George {{and various}} {{official}} enquiries, new workshops were built to provide increased useful employment for prisoners. The western workshops, located between the entry complex and the Female Division, were built from 1900–1901 of squared limestone rubble with openings dressed in brick. An open saw-tooth roof with southern skylights covered the five spaces {{designed for the}} five traditional workshops: tailors, bookbinders, shoemakers, mat makers and painters. The two northern shops were later amalgamated <b>by</b> <b>removing</b> <b>the</b> dividing wall.|$|E

5|$|In Antananarivo and {{throughout}} the highlands, Merina and Betsileo families practice the famadihana, an ancestor reburial ceremony. This ceremony typically occurs {{five to seven years}} after the death of a relative and is celebrated <b>by</b> <b>removing</b> <b>the</b> relative's lamba-wrapped remains from the family tomb, rewrapping it with fresh silk shrouds and returning it to the tomb. Relatives, friends and neighbors are invited {{to take part in the}} music, dancing and feasting that accompanies the event. The famadihana is costly; many families sacrifice higher living standards to set aside money for the ceremony.|$|E
5|$|In the manga series Pokémon Adventures, Team Rocket creates Mewtwo, {{but some}} of his DNA is placed inside of the Gym leader Blaine. Because of the DNA that they share, the two are unable to be {{separated}} for very long without becoming ill. Later, another Pokémon, Entei is able to break the bond between the two <b>by</b> <b>removing</b> <b>the</b> DNA in Blaine's arm, at which point Mewtwo leaves. It eventually helps the main character of the series, Red, fight against Team Rocket leader Giovanni and his Deoxys.|$|E
5|$|The VT heralded the fitment of {{semi-trailing}} arm independent {{rear suspension}} as standard across the range, a significant selling point over the rival Falcon, along with increased electronics such as Traction Control. However, in terms of suspension, the original Opel design was simplified <b>by</b> <b>removing</b> <b>the</b> toe control links that was standard equipment on the European Omega since 1987. Consequently, this afflicted the VT with excessive tyre wear due to distortions to the suspension camber angle and toe under heavy load, such as heavy towing or when travelling over undulated surfaces.|$|E

The other main {{road in the}} area is Highway 41 which served the city {{from the start of}} its modern history. This road runs from west to east towards Gedera and it is the main transport link to the port of Ashdod and the industrial zones, and connects to Highway 4 with an interchange.|$|E
5|$|Thyroid cancers {{are treated}} <b>by</b> <b>removing</b> <b>the</b> whole {{or part of}} thyroid gland. Radioactive Iodine 131 may be given to radioablate the thyroid. Thyroxine is given to replace the hormones lost and to {{suppress}} TSH production, as TSH may stimulate recurrence.

5|$|American Pharoah {{made his}} track debut in a maiden race over {{six and a}} half furlongs on the Polytrack surface at Del Mar Racetrack on August9. Ridden by Martin Garcia, he started as the 7–5 {{favorite}} against eight opponents. He became unsettled before the race and, after running in second place until the stretch, faded to finish fifth behind Om, Iron Fist, One Lucky Dane, and Calculator, more than nine lengths behind the winner. He ran in a blinker hood, which appeared to unnerve him, as did the commotion in the saddling paddock. Baffert addressed his anxiety issues <b>by</b> <b>removing</b> <b>the</b> hood and stuffing cotton in the horse's ears for subsequent races.|$|E

5|$|Kenyatta {{had made}} clear {{his belief that}} Kenya should become a one-party state, {{regarding}} this as a better expression of national unity than a multi-party system. In {{the first five years}} of independence, he consolidated his control of the central government, seeking to prevent the entrenchment of tribal power bases <b>by</b> <b>removing</b> <b>the</b> autonomy of the country's provinces. He argued that centralised control of the government was needed to deal with the growth in demands for local services and to assist more rapid economic development. In 1966, it launched a commission to examine reforms to local government operations. In 1969, it passed the Transfer of Functions Act, which stopped grants to local authorities and transferred major services from provincial to central control.|$|E

During the 2013–14 season, Rome played 7 games in the AHL with the Texas Stars, and 25 games with the Dallas Stars, scoring no goals and just one assist with the NHL club. On June 16, 2014, Rome was placed on unconditional waivers by the Dallas Stars, and the following day (after he cleared waivers) Dallas confirmed their use of a compliance buyout, allowing the team to save salary cap space <b>by</b> <b>removing</b> <b>the</b> final year of his three-year, $4.5 million contract, from the team's salary calculations.|$|E
5|$|The P90 can {{be fitted}} with a sling for greater ease of carry, and since the weapon has a fixed stock (as opposed to having a {{collapsing}} or folding stock), it can be quickly deployed when needed. The weapon's smooth, rounded contours prevent it from snagging on the shooter's clothing or equipment, and a small vertical protrusion is provided at {{the front end of}} the weapon's frame to prevent the shooter's hand from accidentally slipping in front of the muzzle while shooting. A hollow compartment inside the rear of the weapon's frame—accessed <b>by</b> <b>removing</b> <b>the</b> buttplate—allows for convenient storage of a cleaning kit.|$|E
