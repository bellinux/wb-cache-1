5|$|The {{company also}} began a close working {{relationship}} with Ida Lupino of Four Star International. She starred in two suspense films with Robert Ryan—Nicholas Ray's On Dangerous Ground (1952, though shooting had been completed two years earlier) and <b>Beware,</b> My Lovely (1952), a coproduction between RKO and Lupino's company, The Filmakers. Of more historic note, Lupino was Hollywood's only female director during the period; of the five pictures The Filmakers made with RKO, Lupino directed three, including her now celebrated The Hitch-Hiker (1953). Exposing many moviegoers to Asian cinema for the first time, RKO distributed Akira Kurosawa's epochal Rashomon in the United States, sixteen months after its original 1950 Japanese release. The only smash hits released by RKO in the 1950s came out during this period, but neither was an in-house production: Goldwyn's Hans Christian Andersen (1952) was followed by Disney's Peter Pan (1953).|$|E

5|$|Kingdom Hearts was wildly successful, {{shipping}} {{more than}} four million copies worldwide; Shimomura's music was frequently cited {{as one of the}} highlights of the game, and the title track has been ranked as the fourth-best role-playing game title track of all time.

After the release of Kingdom Hearts in 2002, Shimomura left Square for maternity leave, and began work as a freelancer in 2003. She has built on the work she did while at Square; since leaving she has composed or is composing music for eleven Kingdom Hearts games and Nintendo's Mario & Luigi series. She has also worked on many other projects, such as Heroes of Mana and various arranged albums. In February 2014, Shimomura played piano at a retrospective 25th anniversary concert at Tokyo FM Hall. She performed songs from games such as Kingdom Hearts, Live a Live, and Street Fighter II. During the <b>Beware</b> the Forest's Mushrooms performance from Super Mario RPG, Shimomura was joined onstage by fellow game composer Yasunori Mitsuda, who played the Irish bouzouki. She most recently composed and produced the majority of the score for Final Fantasy XV, which she began writing for in 2006, a decade before the game was released.|$|E

Robert's attendant Raimbaut sings a ballad about a beautiful princess from Normandy who married a devil; the princess had a son, Robert, known as 'le diable'. Robert indignantly reveals that he is the son in question and condemns Raimbaut to death. Raimbaut begs for pardon and tells Robert that he is engaged to marry. Robert relents and relishes the thought of the droit du seigneur. Raimbaut's fianceé arrives; Robert recognizes her as his foster-sister Alice and pardons Raimbaut. Alice tells Robert that his mother has died and that her last words were a warning about a threatening dark force (Va! Va! dit-elle). She offers Robert his mother's will. Robert is too overcome to read it and asks Alice to keep it for the present. Robert expresses his longing for his beloved Isabelle and Alice offers to take a letter to her. Alice warns Robert to <b>beware</b> of Bertram but he ignores her. With Bertram's encouragement, Robert gambles with the knights and loses all of his money, as well as his armour.|$|E

40|$|This work {{deals with}} the {{difference}} between man and animal {{in the context of}} the theme of time as treated by Heidegger and Derrida. The starting point of the work is the critique of early Heidegger and his characterization of animal as poor in world. This critique targets his thinking of time and possibility. As first two chapters try to show, despite his basic emphasis on time and on the possibility character of human being, Heidegger still thinks time on the basis of presence and possibility on the basis of reality. Only after taking this step can he think animal privatively as meaningless or poor - in a certain absence of time. This critique results in looking for a more consistent thinking of time and possibility as a way to a more welcoming thinking of animal. The third chapter is concerned with Derrida's objections to searching for other time and it maps the main problems connected with this project of Heidegger. The next three chapters present the main analysis of Heidegger's later thought of time. The differences between his late and early thought are emphasized as the differences between his late speech Time and Being and the early work Being and Time. Heidegger in his later works explores the unity of the three-dimensional time and <b>bewares</b> to think it as presence. The ground of the unity [...] ...|$|R

Several themes were explored when focusing on this improvement; such as the inclusion of extensive gardens and green spaces, the combination of a care program for severely demented people and other (public) programmatic functions, and the use of small-scale living homes for the ones suffering from dementia. The design location is situated {{in the southern part of}} Amsterdam, on the former Havenstraat terrain. This specific plot is surrounded by different spatial and social conditions, as it forms the junction between different residential neighborhoods (the Schinkelbuurt and Plan-Zuid by Berlage) and a former industrial area. On this plot a former prison building, Het Huis van <b>Bewaring</b> II, is situated. Through many years this built structure has given place to multiple types of functional program, including artists’ residences, and currently functions as a refugee shelter. Within this specific graduation project the re-use of this former prison building is of great importance, as it problematizes the relation between a given site, an existing built structure and a specific functional program, the dementia care home.
