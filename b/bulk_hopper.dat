Such recycling machinery is enclosed and employs a dust collection system. Some of the emissions are caught by scrubbers and screens. Magnets, eddy currents, and Trommel screens are employed to separate glass, plastic, and ferrous and nonferrous metals, which {{can then be}} further separated at a smelter.|$|R
50|$|Double dump valves, {{also known}} as double flap valves or double flap gates, are a type of airlock valve {{commonly}} used in industrial applications as a component in bulk material handling applications. Double dump valves are primarily used to discharge chunky or fibrous, <b>bulk</b> materials from <b>hoppers,</b> bins, and cyclones operating under positive or negative pressure. Double dump valves are used to discharge a flow of material {{while at the same}} time serving as an airlock transition point to preserve the pressure differential above and below the valve. This type of material handling valve is ideal for use with bulky or abrasive materials that would tend to jam or damage a rotary feeder.|$|R
40|$|While {{calculation}} {{procedures for the}} design of storage bins for dry bulk materials have been long acknowledged, the design of wet solids storage vessels is an on-going issue. Because the effects of the wet solids properties such as consolidation behavior, water permeability and viscosity on the material discharge have not been investigated yet, existing design procedures employ the principles of Jenike for dry bulk materials to describe the stress fields in a surge bin during initial filling and discharge. This paper focuses on both theoretical and experimental investigations of the discharge mechanisms and loads acting on the wall of a tank filled with a mixture of solids and water. The objective is to confirm whether the Jenike principles can be applied {{for the design of}} wet solids concentrator vessels. Tekscan® tactile pressure pads were applied to measure the profile of normal stress acting on the hopper wall of a wet solids bin, especially during discharge. Results are compared with the stresses calculated by applying standard calculation methods for dry <b>bulk</b> materials <b>hopper</b> design in conjunction with the effect of hydrostatic pressure. The results indicate that wet solids are behaving like dry bulk materials. However, the Jenike design method may be too conservative, leading to hopper half angles steeper and tanks higher than necessary...|$|R

Statistical and dynamical algorithms are presented for the generation of Delannay and Voronoi lattices. In numerical shear cell experiments the dependency of dilatance and shear power on the shear velocity and the standard power was studied. The model describes even the well-known spontaneous formation of shear bands in the cells. The two- dimensional simulation of a shear zone between two tectonic plates yields earthquake statistics corresponding to the Gutenberg-Richter law.

The X-ray tomograms provide information on the <b>bulk</b> of the <b>hopper</b> filling, and allow to determine the particle positions and orientations inside the silo, as well as spatial variations of the local packing density. We find that particles show a preferred orientation and thereby an enhanced order in the flowing zone of the silo. Similarly to simple shear flows, the average orientation of the particles is not parallel to the streamlines but encloses a certain angle with them.

Bulk wheat flow challenges such as inconsistent flow, arching, etc., are common during handling. The irregular size and non-uniformity of physical properties, {{the presence of}} impurities affects the flow of wheat. Chaff and insects infested kernels {{are the two most}} common impurities present in bulk wheat. In this research, the effect of these two impurities on bulk wheat physical and flow properties were studied. Physical and flow indicators, such as bulk, tapped, particle densities, angle of repose, Hausner ratio, Carr index, and porosity measures the flowability of uncompacted bulk solids.

5000|$|The CCI Phantom is a Nelson-based pump action paintball marker {{developed}} and produced by Mike Casady. Production began in 1987 after {{about six months}} of prototype work. The name for the marker {{was derived from the}} much more stealth-oriented and drawn-out style of play that was typical when the game was first developing. The Phantom was designed to be powered by a single 12 gram CO2 powerlet, but larger tanks may also be used by removing the powerlet adapter or using a dummy powerlet. When first introduced the marker featured a fixed barrel assembly referred to as a [...] "unibody" [...] combined with a modified Crosman air pistol frame and brass bead sight. However, since roughly 1989 the body and barrel of the marker have been two distinct parts and no longer feature the bead style sight. The marker is also capable of supporting <b>bulk</b> gravity fed <b>hoppers</b> by using a different breech type. The Phantom is {{one of only a handful}} of readily available markers acceptable for use in the various forms of stock class paintball. However, because the Phantom is capable of auto-triggering and features barrel porting it is considered to be a modified stock class marker.|$|R
40|$|A 2 -dimensional {{model of}} stress {{distribution}} in a wedge hopper has been developed. This is a co-ordinate-specific {{version of the}} Lamé-Maxwell equations in a space frame dictated by the assumption of circular arc, principal stress orientation. A set of orthogonal, independent variables {{has been defined as}} x-ψo space. x is the vertical height of intersection of the circular principal stress arc with the wedge wall and the radius of the circular arc is proportional to x. ψo is the angle that the radius makes to the vertical at the lower arc in the system - lower boundary condition. The second principal stress follows ψ-lines through the vessel from ψo at the lower boundary, eventually passing through the vessel wall and leaving the system. The model has been used to integrate the stress equations along lines of principal stress using numerical techniques. An analytical solution has been found at ψo = 0 of the same mathematical form as the Enstad/Walker/Walters equations. The model can be used to predict the location of the stable, cohesive arch and to predict unviable stress states in terms of the Mohr-Coulomb yield criterion. There is a requirement for experimental data of internal stress distributions within <b>bulk</b> solids in <b>hoppers</b> and silos to validate this and other models...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} {{increased}} interest in large-scale industrial use of lignocellulosic plant biomass as an alternative biofuel replacement of fossil fuels (coal) in power plant boilers. Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), a perennial energy crop {{has been one of}} the favorable feedstocks considered as a dedicated energy crop in existing systems. However, the physical and flow properties of switchgrass particulates differ from coal due to its inherent low bulk density, high aspect ratio and fibrous nature. Because of the very different characteristics of switchgrass compared to most bulk solids of rigid-plastic nature, the fundamental flow mechanics differ as well. This makes it difficult or impossible to feed switchgrass into utility boilers using existing handling equipment such as hoppers designed for coal. Thorough hopper design studies for irregular-shaped particulates such as switchgrass do not exist; this provided a need to investigate fundamental material properties of switchgrass particulates and their effect on the flow mechanics in hoppers under gravity discharge. ^ Relationships between particle and bulk properties of switchgrass ground to geometric mean sizes (dwg) of 0. 98, 0. 70 and 0. 34 mm by hammer milling through screen sizes, 6. 4, 3. 2 and 1. 6 mm, respectively, were evaluated. Particle size distribution decreased with size reduction indicating a smaller, more uniform particle size. Bulk density and particle density increased with size reduction indicating a less compressible bulk solid and improved handling. Particle shape (image analysis) suggested that the needle-shaped nature of switchgrass particles is an inherent characteristic that causes poor flowabilty and size reduction does not influence the shape of switchgrass particles. ^ Flow properties determined by shear testing provided relationships between compression and material strength. A comparison of flow properties to physical properties showed strong influences of particle size, particle size distribution and bulk density on the unconfined yield strength (UYS) and cohesion. Flow index values classified ground switchgrass of 0. 98 mm dwg as a cohesive poor-flowing material. Improved flow was suggested when switchgrass was ground through screen sizes smaller than 6. 4 mm, that is for dwg of 0. 70 and 0. 34 mm, respectively. ^ Dr. Andrew Jenike 2 ̆ 7 s (1964) hopper design principles were applied to the ground switchgrass material. Observed discharge openings through experimental hopper tests agreed quite well with calculated results of Jenike 2 ̆ 7 s method. A larger discharge opening was required for larger particle size and a less dense switchgrass bulk. Modeling of the hopper flow factor for Jenike 2 ̆ 7 s approach and experimental hopper testing suggested that the hopper half angle, particle-particle friction (effective angle of internal friction) and particle-wall friction (wall-friction angle) were significant factors affecting hopper design for switchgrass biomass. Comparing results of an established hopper design to actual observations allowed the hopper design to be evaluated for effects of changes induced by particle size reduction on <b>bulk</b> solid <b>hopper</b> design. ^ The results from this dissertation work provided a fundamental understanding of material properties that comprise the flow mechanics in hoppers as well as design. This developed understanding enables design options to be effectively assessed for modifying the process or hopper to provide reliable flow of bulk solids comprised of fibrous, irregular-shaped particulates. ...|$|R
