5|$|Conchology is the {{scientific}} study of mollusc shells, but the term conchologist is also sometimes used to describe a collector of shells. Many people pick up shells on the <b>beach</b> <b>or</b> purchase them and display them in their homes. There are many private and public collections of mollusc shells, but the largest one in the world is at the Smithsonian Institution, which houses in excess of 20 million specimens.|$|E
5|$|The {{identification}} of stolen diamonds presents {{a set of}} difficult problems. Rough diamonds will have a distinctive shape depending on whether their source is a mine or from an alluvial environment such as a <b>beach</b> <b>or</b> river - alluvial diamonds have smoother surfaces than {{those that have been}} mined. Determining the provenance of cut and polished stones is much more complex.|$|E
5|$|The northernmost of {{the beaches}} is Playa Las Terrazas or Playa Principal (The Terraces <b>Beach</b> <b>or</b> Main Beach), {{which is in}} front of Ross Park. It is popular for surfing. Near the beach and at Ross Park, there are balustrades and long stairs dating from the early 1900s. There is a balcony over the rocks at the {{southern}} end of the beach. It is the busiest during the summer months. Several surf schools, such as La Ola Perfecta, and Lobos del Pac√≠fico, are located nearby, as is the fish market at Fishermen Creek.|$|E

5|$|At Jig, {{the first}} wave of {{infantry}} (the 1st Dorsetshires and 1st Hampshires of the 231st Infantry Brigade) arrived at 07:25, and immediately came under fire from the casemated 75mm gun at Le Hamel. Due to navigation errors and the strong current, both groups came ashore well to the east of their intended landing points. The DD tank and Royal Marine Centaur tanks that were supposed to arrive in advance of the landing were delayed by rough seas and did not arrive until 08:00. Many of the tanks got bogged down on the <b>beach</b> <b>or</b> were taken out by enemy fire. The tide came in quicker than expected, before many of the beach obstacles and mines were cleared, and some of the landing craft were damaged as a result.|$|E
5|$|The Coastal Discovery Museum, in {{conjunction}} with the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources, patrols the beaches from May through October as part of the Sea Turtle Protection Project. The purpose of the project is to inventory and monitor nesting locations, and if necessary, move them to more suitable locations. During the summer months, the museum sponsors the Turtle Talk & Walk, which is a special tour designed to educate the public about this endangered species. To protect loggerhead sea turtles, a town ordinance stipulates that artificial lighting must be shielded so that it cannot be seen from the <b>beach,</b> <b>or</b> it must be turned off by 10:00p.m. from May 1 to October 31 each year.|$|E
5|$|The {{first six}} seasons {{featured}} sixteen fighters, in either {{one or two}} weight categories. The first two seasons, however, were very different from each following season. The original format for The Ultimate Fighter saw each team compete in challenges, such as hoisting their respective coach up on their shoulders and sprinting down a <b>beach,</b> <b>or</b> a team tug-of-war. These challenges resulted in eliminations of fighters who hadn't fought, {{until late in the}} season when the challenge incentive was to select the next fight where fighters would be eliminated, having lost the fight. In the first two seasons, fighters would also leave the house for good upon losing and this often resulted in odd numbers for teams, which forced the moving of fighters to opposing teams.|$|E

5|$|Erosion can be {{the result}} of {{material}} movement by the wind. There are two main effects. First, wind causes small particles to be lifted and therefore moved to another region. This is called deflation. Second, these suspended particles may impact on solid objects causing erosion by abrasion (ecological succession). Wind erosion generally occurs in areas with little or no vegetation, often in areas where there is insufficient rainfall to support vegetation. An example is the formation of sand dunes, on a <b>beach</b> <b>or</b> in a desert. Loess is a homogeneous, typically nonstratified, porous, friable, slightly coherent, often calcareous, fine-grained, silty, pale yellow or buff, windblown (Aeolian) sediment. It generally occurs as a widespread blanket deposit that covers areas of hundreds of square kilometers and tens of meters thick. Loess often stands in either steep or vertical faces. Loess tends to develop into highly rich soils. Under appropriate climatic conditions, areas with loess are among the most agriculturally productive in the world. Loess deposits are geologically unstable by nature, and will erode very readily. Therefore, windbreaks (such as big trees and bushes) are often planted by farmers to reduce the wind erosion of loess.|$|E
5|$|Norfolk Coast Path, {{an ancient}} long {{distance}} footpath, cuts {{across the south}} eastern corner of the reserve along the sea wall between the farmland and the salt marshes, and further west at Holme-next-the-Sea the trail joins Peddars Way. The tip of Blakeney Point {{can be reached by}} walking up the shingle spit from the car park at Cley <b>Beach,</b> <b>or</b> by boats from the quay at Morston. The boat gives good views of the seal colonies and avoids the long walk over a difficult surface. The National Trust has an information centre and tea room at the quay, and a visitor centre on the Point. The centre was formerly a lifeboat station and is open in the summer months. Halfway House, or the Watch House, is a building 2.4km (1.5mi) from Cley Beach car park. Originally built in the 19th century as a look-out for smugglers, it was used in succession as a coast guard station, by the Girl Guides, and as a holiday let.|$|E
5|$|When AirTrain JFK {{was being}} planned, it was {{expected}} that 11,000 passengers per day would pay to ride the system between the airport and either Howard <b>Beach</b> <b>or</b> Jamaica, while 23,000 more daily passengers would use the AirTrain to travel between terminals. This would amount to about 4 million paid passengers and 8.4 million in-airport passengers per year. The system would cause a reduction of approximately 75,000 vehicle miles driven per day, as well as accommodate over 3,000 daily riders from Manhattan, according to the FEIS. During the first month of service, an average of 15,000 daily passengers rode either the paid or unpaid sections of the system, less than the 34,000 expected daily riders. This made it the second-busiest airport transportation system in the United States, even though it had been open for only a month. Since then, ridership continued to rise. AirTrain JFK transported 1 million riders within its first six months.|$|E

5|$|When the {{railways}} were nationalised in 1948, services at Montpelier {{came under the}} control of the Western Region of British Railways. Staff levels were reduced further, down to two booking clerks, four porters, a checker and a weighbridge operator by 1950. Service levels had decreased slightly by 1955 to 28 towards Avonmouth and 29 towards Bristol, but the services were at regular intervals. Passenger numbers however dropped sharply in 1961 as the result of a fare increase, and so in 1962 a new reduced timetable was enacted, which lost more passengers. A year later in 1963, the Beeching report suggested the complete withdrawal of services along the line, but ultimately only those beyond Severn <b>Beach</b> <b>or</b> via Henbury were withdrawn. The goods yard at Montpelier closed on 18 November 1965, with the signal box following on 10 May 1967. Staff were completely withdrawn on 17 July 1967 with tickets issued by the train guard. The general reduction in passenger traffic, as well as the transfer of Avonmouth goods traffic to the Henbury Loop Line, allowed the removal of the northern track from 19 October 1970, with all services using the southern platform. The former goods yard is now a small industrial estate. By 1974, service had reduced to 19 trains per day in each direction, with no Sunday services beyond Avonmouth.|$|E
5|$|When the {{railways}} were nationalised in 1948, services at Shirehampton {{came under the}} aegis of the Western Region of British Railways. Staff levels decreased by 1958 to two clerks, two leading porters, one porter, and a stationmaster who was also responsible for Sea Mills railway station. Service levels had decreased slightly by 1955 to 28 towards Avonmouth and 29 towards Bristol, but the services were at regular intervals. Passenger numbers however dropped sharply in 1961 as the result of a fare increase, and so in 1962 a new reduced timetable was enacted, which lost more passengers. A year later in 1963, the Beeching report suggested the complete withdrawal of services along the line, but ultimately only those beyond Severn <b>Beach</b> <b>or</b> via Henbury were withdrawn. Goods services from the station ended on 29 November 1965, and from 17 July 1967 all staffing was withdrawn from stations along the line, including Shirehampton, with tickets issued by the train guard. An 800-ton oil storage tank was built in the station yard in 1967, with deliveries continuing until the mid-eighties. By 2005 the yard had been redeveloped and was occupied by a commercial vehicle hire company. The general reduction in passenger traffic, as well as the transfer of Avonmouth goods traffic to the Henbury Loop Line, allowed the removal of the second track from 19 October 1970, with all services using the original, northern platform. The signal box was taken out of service at the same time, and the buildings on the remaining platform sold off before being destroyed by a fire in the 1990s. The station master's house is now a private dwelling, with the garden containing a small brick building with a chimney surviving from the station buildings. By 1974, service had reduced to 19 trains per day in each direction, with no Sunday services beyond Avonmouth.|$|E

25|$|Stranded vessels can be {{retracted}} from a <b>beach</b> <b>or</b> reef {{by the use}} of Grasp's {{towing machine}} and propulsion. Additional retraction force can be applied to a stranded vessel through the use of up to six legs of beach gear, consisting of 6,000 pound STATO anchors, wire rope, chain, and salvage buoys. In a typical configuration, two legs of beach gear are rigged on board Grasp, and up to four legs of beach are rigged to the stranded vessel.|$|E
