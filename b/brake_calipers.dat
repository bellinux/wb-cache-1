25|$|A new front-drive {{platform}} underpinned the car, {{although the}} wheelbase remained unchanged and overall length grew by a lone centimetre. Weight-saving aluminum was {{employed in the}} hood, rear hatch, front axle and <b>brake</b> <b>calipers</b> (disc brakes were finally assigned to all four wheels).|$|E
25|$|The {{next step}} up was the Gr.A car, which was fitted with 16 Speedline 2012 rims (with {{optional}} extractors), further improvements on suspension and more tuned engine producing between 205–220 PS. Front brakes were also updated with 323mm discs and four-pot Alcon <b>brake</b> <b>calipers.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... 1976 models had {{the front}} <b>brake</b> <b>caliper</b> {{moved to the}} right fork leg, behind the fork as opposed to {{in front of the}} fork. This placed the <b>brake</b> <b>caliper</b> nearer the {{steering}} pivot center-line, requiring slightly less effort to steer.|$|R

25|$|Technical {{improvements}} in the chassis include Tokico radial <b>brake</b> <b>calipers,</b> allowing smaller discs and therefore lower unsprung weight, translating into superior handling. Increased front braking power necessitated a sturdier lower triple clamp. The rear brake caliper {{was moved to the}} top of the disc, giving a cleaner visual appearance. New 17inch wheels were designed, using Bridgestone BT-015 radials taken almost directly from the GSX-R1000.|$|E
25|$|A Competition Group (Comp-G) {{package was}} {{available}} for the GTP that included red painted <b>brake</b> <b>calipers</b> (same brakes as the 'standard' GTP), sport tuned suspension, heads-up display (also in GT2 model), 4-speed automatic transmission with paddle-style TAPShift, StabiliTrak dynamic control system, 3.29 axle ratio, performance tires and Magnasteer II. Also, a 10-spoke light weight wheel was standard with the Comp-G package but could be 'upgraded' to the GTP optional wheel.|$|E

25|$|The Veyron's brakes use cross drilled, {{radially}} vented {{carbon fibre}} reinforced silicon carbide (C/SiC) composite discs, manufactured by SGL Carbon, {{which have a}} much greater resistance to brake fade when compared with conventional cast iron discs. The lightweight aluminium alloy monobloc <b>brake</b> <b>calipers</b> are made by AP Racing; the fronts have eight titanium pistons and the rear calipers have six pistons. Bugatti claims maximum deceleration of 1.3g on road tyres. As an added safety feature, {{in the event of}} brake failure, an anti-lock braking system (ABS) has also been installed on the handbrake.|$|E
25|$|The Gallardo Nera was {{a special}} edition limited to 185 units of the Gallardo and was {{introduced}} at the Paris Motor Show. The car was designed to showcase the customization options available to the customer in the Ad Personam program. It features special matte black body panels and was only available in a special shade of black: a combination of Nero Serapis and Nero Noctis. <b>Brake</b> <b>calipers</b> are painted a special silver and the taillights are smoked to match the darker paint scheme. The interior was stitched from high-contrast black and white leather in the Q-Citura (lozenge shaped) fashion.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{standards}} for mounting disc <b>brake</b> <b>calipers.</b> I.S. (International Standard) is different for 160mm and 203mm rotor and differs between forks with a QR and 20mm through axle. The post-mount standard also differs by disc size and axle type. Many incompatible variants were produced over the years, mostly by fork manufacturers. The mount {{used on the}} Rockshox Boxxer is the most typical of these specialty mounts, but most fork manufactures now use either the IS or post-mount standard for their current forks. As a point of reference, Hayes currently sells no fewer than 13 different adapters to fit their brakes to various mounting patterns.|$|E
5000|$|NASCAR has {{approved}} a new <b>brake</b> <b>caliper</b> system for 2015 and issued a new parts approval process.|$|R
50|$|From 1991, {{the rear}} drum brake was {{replaced}} by a 240 mm disc brake, with a single-piston <b>brake</b> <b>caliper.</b>|$|R
25|$|The <b>brake</b> <b>caliper</b> is the {{assembly}} which houses the brake pads and pistons. The pistons are usually made of plastic, aluminium or chrome-plated steel.|$|R
25|$|Available in 2006 Route 66 Edition was {{finished}} in either Solar Yellow or Black. This version featured Solar Yellow <b>brake</b> <b>calipers,</b> body-color grille, solar-tinted sunscreen glass, liftgate mounted spoiler, 17-inch all-season performance tires, four-wheel anti-lock brakes with low-speed traction control, speed control, and a sport suspension. Brightwork accents included chrome body-side moldings, a chrome exhaust tip and , chrome-plated, and five-spoke Empire aluminum wheels. Exterior identification included a 'Street Cruiser' badge with Solar Yellow accents on the liftgate and 'Route 66' badges {{on the front}} doors. A total of 1443 Route 66 models were produced in North America, with 142 of those equipped with 5 speed manual transmissions.|$|E
25|$|A {{disadvantage}} of post mounts {{is that the}} bolt is threaded directly into the fork lowers. If the threads are stripped or if the bolt is stuck, then the threads {{will need to be}} repaired, or the seized bolt drilled out. Frame manufacturers have standardized the IS mount for the rear disc brake mount. In recent years post mount has gained ground and is becoming more common. This is mostly due to decreased manufacturing and part cost for the <b>brake</b> <b>calipers</b> when using post mount. A limitation of the mount is that the location of the rotor is more constrained: it is possible to encounter incompatible hub/fork combinations, where the rotor is out of range.|$|E
25|$|Carbon fiber {{is used on}} the roof, hood, fenders, front {{splitter}}, and rocker moldings; {{the hood}} and fenders are painted over, while the roof and splitter are merely covered in a clear-coat, retaining their black color. A polycarbonate window {{is placed in the}} center of the hood, allowing the engine intercooler to be seen from the exterior. The wheels are the largest ever placed on a production Corvette, with both front and rear wheels increasing in size and diameter over the Corvette Z06. Carbon-ceramic brakes are included. The <b>brake</b> <b>calipers</b> are painted blue, as are the engine intercooler trim and the ZR1 logo. Magnetic Selective Ride Control is also included on the car, with sensors to automatically adjust stiffness levels based on road conditions and vehicle movement.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to analyze the stress and the strain fields in the <b>brake</b> <b>caliper</b> mounts of front {{motorbike}} suspensions produced by the braking action. First of all, some formulae useful to evaluate the maximum braking force in function of the vehicle features (e. g., total mass, centre of gravity position, tyre dimension, and brake disk diameter) have been developed. A mathematical model useful to calculate the axial, the bending, and the torque stresses on the <b>braking</b> <b>caliper</b> mounts has been then defined. The model has been developed by comparing the theoretical results with those obtained by some numerical analyses, based on the finite element method. An ad hoc test equipment has been, finally, designed and manufactured in order to define and analyze experimentally the strength {{of different types of}} <b>brake</b> <b>caliper</b> mounts and, at the same time, to verify the proposed model...|$|R
50|$|In 2003, Suzuki {{redesigned}} the SV650 {{with a new}} pressure-cast aluminum truss frame, bodywork, swing-arm with revised rear <b>brake</b> <b>caliper</b> mounting, exhaust, digital speedometer {{display and}} electronic fuel injection/induction system to replace the carburetor.|$|R

25|$|In 2014, as part {{of running}} changes {{consistent}} with those of the MY15 Toyota 86 GTS, the Subaru BRZ also featured a new key fob and two new colours, including ‘WR Blue Pearl’ metallic finish. In addition, Subaru also launched special editions both for the United States and Australia markets. For the former, one thousand BRZ Series. Blue editions were marketed at additional cost, half painted in Blue Pearl and the other half in Crystal Pearl White. This model featured STI body kit parts, 17-inch STI black alloy wheels and red <b>brake</b> <b>calipers.</b> For Australia, Subaru launched a similar variant known as the Special Edition, also at additional cost. It featured stripes across the bonnet, boot and roof; 17-inch STI black alloy wheels; STI boot spoiler plus front, side and rear-side under spoilers; a rear diffuser and a push-button starter switch. It was available in every existing BRZ paint hue.|$|E
25|$|The Mustang Bullitt {{returned}} in February 2008, {{a variant of}} the Mustang GT, the last version of which was produced in 2001. It is reminiscent of the Dark Highland Green GT-390 fastback Mustang driven by Steve McQueen in the 1968 film Bullitt. Available in Dark Highland Green or Black exterior paint without spoiler and GT fender emblems; the faux gas cap on the deck lid is replaced by a unique Bullitt version. The Mustang GT's standard fog light-equipped grille is replaced with a specially designed pony-less style grille highlighted by an aluminium accent. Dark Argent Gray 18-inch cast-aluminum euro-flange wheels are used with matching <b>brake</b> <b>calipers</b> and larger, 3.5inch exhaust tips replace the Mustang GT's standard 3 inch tips. Although side (quarter) window louvers (as shown in picture) are not standard, they are added by owners because they are similar to those on the 1968 Mustang fastback.|$|E
25|$|The car {{now has the}} {{addition}} of the Advanced Aerodynamic Package (two-piece front corner splitters and a rear decklid spoiler made from carbon fiber), lightweight Sidewinder II wheels finished in matte-black, Pirelli P Zero Corsa tires, two-mode (Street and Race) Bilstein DampTronic suspension adapted from the GTS, but with firmer levels of damping and a smaller spread between modes, shock dampers, increased spring rates and thicker anti-roll bars, carbon fiber underhood X-brace (instead of the aluminium brace in all other models), carbon fiber rear tail light applique from the Exterior Carbon Fiber Accent Package, two-piece Brembo brake rotors with wider brake annulus, black-anodized Brembo <b>brake</b> <b>calipers</b> painted with the Viper logo in TA Orange, TA logos behind both front wheels and a Stryker decal instead of the standard badge on the hood (TA Orange on the Venom Black cars, black on the TA Orange and Venom White cars), black interior with TA Orange accent stitching on the ballistic cloth seats, instrument panel & cowl, center stack, console, hand brake, shifter boot, and door panels. The aerodynamic package adds 200 pounds (90.72kg) of downforce at 100mph (160.93km/h). Top speed is 193mph (310.60km/h) instead of the non-aerodynamics package cars' 206mph (331.52km/h). The car's mileage is 12 mpg in city, and 19 mpg in highway.|$|E
50|$|Mid-'77 {{the front}} forks {{had a major}} redesign, fork tube {{diameter}} increased from 34 to 35 mm and internals were changed (although this also holds true for various years of the same tube size). The entire fork assembly (with triple tree) will swap either way but fork parts are not equivalent. Also the <b>brake</b> <b>caliper</b> changed from a 48 mm dual piston cast iron design for the 34 mm fork to a 40 mm aluminum single piston floating caliper for the 35 mm forks. The <b>brake</b> <b>caliper</b> mounting lugs on the fork sliders are of different spacing for the 34 mm and 35 mm forks so the calipers can't be swapped.|$|R
50|$|The Z1000 was restyled {{and updated}} for 2014 making {{slightly}} {{more power and}} front <b>brake</b> <b>caliper</b> are 4 piston monoblock. Also a big piston Showa separate function fork along with lighter wheels and a slightly larger gas tank.|$|R
