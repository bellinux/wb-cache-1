25|$|The 1985 Mexico City {{earthquake}} of September 19, 1985 is a {{good example}} of earthquake damage to a modern city built on soft sediment. Though the earthquake epicenter was located around 350km from the city, the sites with soft clay deposits exhibited a huge amplification of ground motion resulting in severe damage. Mexico City is built on a thick layer of soft soil over a hard stratum. The western part of the city is located on the edge of an old lakebed, whereas, soft clay deposits filling the former lakebed underline the eastern part. In the lake <b>bed</b> <b>area,</b> the soft clay deposits have shear wave velocities ranging from 40 to 90m/s and the underlying hard strata has a shear wave velocity in the range 500m/s or greater. During the earthquake of 1985, the seismic waves were trapped in the soft strata. The soft soil layer allowed the upward propagating shear waves to propagate easily; however, the hard strata at the bottom acted like a reflector and bounced back the downward propagating waves. This kind of trapping of waves created a resonance and consequently resulted in an enormous amplification of the ground motion. As a result, the lake <b>bed</b> <b>area</b> suffered catastrophic damage; however, in the southwest part of the city, ground motions were moderate and building damage was minor. The acceleration recorded in the hill-zones were relatively low-amplitude, short period ground motions compared to high amplitude and long period ground motions recorded at stations located in the lake zone.|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} it was {{investigated}} whether covered <b>bedding</b> <b>areas</b> {{are able to}} reduce dust emissions from laying hens. The study shows that laying hens in an aviary system preferred dust bath behaviour under the tiers. Also in deep litter houses the number of hens that displays dust bath behaviour on the covered <b>bedding</b> <b>area</b> is probably not sufficient to give a relevant reduction of dust emissions. Further research on this principle is not recommended...|$|R

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the possibility of}} decreasing defecation in a <b>bedding</b> <b>area</b> by inducing a heifer to visit a feeding station {{within a few minutes}} or immediately after standing. An experimental paddock (11. 3 x 6. 8 m) was made outdoors. Half of the paddock was roofed and bedded with straw to form a resting area. A feeding station was situated in the remaining area of the paddock，which was designated as the feeding area. Six Holstein heifers，the test subjects，were grouped together in the paddock. A standing detection device was developed and attached to the heifer's left hind leg. The feeding station had an antenna that identified the heifer carrying the ID-tag when it entered the station. This experiment included control period and an experimental period. The feeding station was closed during the control period. During the experimental period，the heifers were allowed to obtain the concentrate when they visited the feeding station within a limited time (60 min， 30 min， 10 min， 5 min) after standing. Instances of defecation in the <b>bedding</b> <b>area</b> were counted in the morning and in the evening before cleaning. This study verified the possibility that the average number of instances of defecation in the <b>bedding</b> <b>area</b> decreased significantly (pく 0. 01) to 12. 5 ± 6. 4 during the experimental period from average defecations in the <b>bedding</b> <b>area</b> were 23. 5 ±t 7. 8 during the control period. We conclude that inducing the heifer to visit the feeding station within a few minutes after standing decreases defecation in the <b>bedding</b> <b>area.</b> 放し飼い牛舎において牛床を設置しない牛舎，いわ ゆるフリーバーンにおいて，起立直後の牛をフィード ステーションへ誘導することにより牛のベッドエリア での排池を減らす方法を検討することを目的とした. 屋外に実験用パドック(1 l. 3 X 6. 8 m) を作成した. パ ドックの半分に屋根をかけ，ワラを敷いて休息エリア とした. 残り半分を給餌エリアとし，フィードステー ションを設置した. 6 頭のホルスタイン種育成牛を群飼した. 午の左後肢に起立検知機を取り付け，牛の起 立を自動検知した. フィードステーションには牛の首 につけたリスボンダーの個体識別番号を認識するアン テナがついており，起立後の牛にフィードステーショ ンから配合飼料を給与できるようにした. 実験は予備 期(17 日間) と本期(44 日間) に分けて実施した. 予 備期はフィードステーションを封鎖した. 本期は処理 60 (牛が起立後 60 分間以内にフィードステーションを 訪問すると配合飼料を得られる) ，処理 30 (30 分間以 内) ，処理 10 (10 分間以内) ，処理 5 (5 分間以内) の 4 つの処理を行った. 処理 30 ， 10 ， 5 は，設定した条 件に従ってコンピュータで自動的に移行するようにした. 朝夕の作業時に休息エリアの糞の個数を数えた. 休息エリアでの糞の平均個数は予備期 23. 5 ± 7. 8 個に 対し，本期では 12. 5 ± 6. 4 個と有意(pく 0. 01) に減少 した. このことから，牛が起立直後にフィードステー ションを訪問するよう条件づけするか，またはその方 向に移動するようにできれば，排泄場所をある程度制 御することができると考えられた.

50|$|The {{advantage}} of the Envoy XUV over a pickup truck or a more truck-like configuration such as the Chevrolet Avalanche (which originated the MidGate feature) is that with retractable roof and rear glass closed, the cargo area is sealed, full roof height and lockable, thus making it an enclosed SUV.

5000|$|Tana Vallis is 60 km (37 miles) {{long and}} {{begins at the}} {{southwest}} rim of Galilaei Crater. Tana was eroded by the catastrophic drainage of a lake that formerly filled the crater, overtopped its rim, and rapidly eroded a breach channel through which the lake in Galilaei Crater drained. Terrestrial dam breach methods were used to estimate paleo-discharges in Tana Vallis. [...] Peak discharge rates in Tana Vallis would have depended on how quickly the breach channel formed. If it fully formed in two to ten days, the discharge peak {{would have been in}} the range from 15 to 47 million cubic meters per second. A key erosion parameter, stream power, has also been evaluated for Tana Vallis. For a scenario where the breach formed in five days, the stream power per unit stream <b>bed</b> <b>area</b> at the time of peak discharge would have exceeded 350,000 watts per square meter. Erosive power of this magnitude would have sufficed to erode basaltic bedrock. The impact-altered material in the rim of Galilaei Crater would have been more easily eroded than intact basalts, and therefore the breach channel would have formed relatively fast.|$|E
50|$|The latest {{evolution}} for skid units {{utilized for}} public {{safety in the}} past few years has seen them become more compact in size so they will fit onto the relatively small cargo <b>bed</b> <b>area</b> of an ATV/UTV off road vehicle. These vehicles like the Polaris Ranger 4x4 or 6x6 chassis, along with the Kawasaki Mule 4x4, the Kubota RTV 900 and many other makes and models are gaining popularity among fire dept and ambulance services across the country. These smaller off road vehicles can get into places where much larger fire and ambulance apparatus cannot. Also, the ATV/UTV vehicles can maneuver over much rougher terrain. There are now fire skid units made specifically for these vehicles. There is also a number of fire/rescue skid units allowing double duty of fighting fires and allowing rescuers to place a medical victim onto the unit for transport out of the woods. Another skid unit, the medical skid unit is specifically targeted to be placed into the cargo bed of ATV/UTV vehicles which are completely focused on providing medical transport, like a mini-ambulance, into the back country or woods for victim retrievals. These medical bed units can carry a trained medical attendant to be with the patient at all times, a full complement of medical gear in an enclosed storage area and other fixtures like 02 holders and IV poles to hold IV bags up above the patient.|$|E
