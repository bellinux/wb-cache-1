Each player is assigned direct control of a single character.

Players can customize the controls, which are largely the same for each race, with slight differences for abilities.|$|E

5|$|Madagascar {{is one of}} {{the poorest}} {{countries}} in the world, with a high population growth rate of 2.5%per year and nearly 70% of the population living in poverty. The country is also <b>burdened</b> <b>with</b> high levels of debt and limited resources. These socioeconomic issues have complicated conservation efforts, even though the island of Madagascar has been recognized by IUCN/SSC as a critical primate region for over 20years. Due to its relatively small land area—587,045km2 (226,659sq mi)—compared to other high-priority biodiversity regions and its high levels of endemism, the country {{is considered one of the}} world's most important biodiversity hotspots, with lemur conservation being a high priority. Despite the added emphasis for conservation, there is no indication that the extinctions that began with the arrival of humans have come to an end.|$|E
5|$|Historian James C. Klotter has speculated that, had John C. Breckinridge's father, Cabell, lived, {{he would}} have steered his son to the Whig Party and the Union, rather than the Democratic Party and the Confederacy, but the Kentucky Secretary of State and former Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives died of a fever on September 1, 1823, months before his son's third birthday. <b>Burdened</b> <b>with</b> her husband's debts, widow Mary Breckinridge and her {{children}} moved to her in-laws' home near Lexington, Kentucky, where John C. Breckinridge's grandmother taught him the political philosophies of his late grandfather, U.S. Attorney General John Breckinridge. John Breckinridge believed {{the federal government was}} created by, and subject to, the co-equal governments of the states. As a state representative, he introduced the Kentucky Resolutions of 1798 and 1799, which denounced the Alien and Sedition Acts and asserted that states could nullify them and other federal laws that they deemed unconstitutional. A strict constructionist, he held that the federal government could only exercise powers explicitly given to it in the Constitution.|$|E

5|$|The {{new arrival}} was a British ship sent from the Channel Fleet on a lone patrol: the frigate HMS Thames under Captain James Cotes. Thames {{was an old}} frigate, built in 1758 and {{carrying}} 32 12-pounder guns. The ship was below its standard complement of 215 men, sailing with only 184, which meant that the 6-pounder guns that augmented the main battery could not be manned. By comparison, Uranie {{was five years old}} and carried 40 18-pounder guns and weighing almost double the weight of the British ship. Her full complement was of 260 men, but she lacked 60 of her sailors, dispatched in prize crews over three captured ships, and was <b>burdened</b> <b>with</b> over 260 prisoners. At first unsure of the identity of the ship to the north, Tartu hoisted a blue flag as an identification signal and sent the Alcoudia away in case the ship should be revealed to be hostile. Cotes did not respond to the signal, and the two ships were soon hidden from one another by a rain squall.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Patient {{financial}} <b>burden</b> <b>with</b> {{chronic disease}} poses significant health risks, yet it remains outside {{the scope of}} clinical visits. Little is known about how physicians perceive their patients’ health-related financial burden in the context of primary care. The {{purpose of this study was}} to describe physician experiences <b>with</b> patients’ financial <b>burden</b> while managing chronic disease and the communication of these issues. Methods In November 2013, four focus groups were conducted in an academic medical center. A convenience sample of 29 internal and family medicine resident physicians was used in this study. A semi-structured interview protocol was employed by trained facilitators. Coded transcripts were analyzed for themes regarding physicians’ experiences with identifying, managing, and communicating financial <b>burden</b> <b>with</b> their patients in the context of primary care. Results Major themes identified were 1) patient financial <b>burden</b> <b>with</b> chronic care is visible to physicians, 2) patient’s financial <b>burden</b> <b>with</b> chronic care and discussing these issues is important to physicians, 3) ability to identify patients who perceive financial burden is imperfect, 4) communication of financial <b>burden</b> <b>with</b> patients is complex and difficult to navigate, 5) strategies utilized to address concerns are not always generalizable, and 6) physicians have ideas for widespread change to make these conversations easier for them. Conclusion Awareness of physician perspectives in identifying and addressing their patients’ disease-related financial burden may better equip researchers and medical educators to develop interventions that aid care teams in better understanding these patient concerns to promote compliance with treatment recommendations...|$|R

40|$|Objective. To {{determine}} the cost-effectiveness of averting {{the burden of}} disease. We used secondary population data and metaanalyses of various government-funded services and interventions to investigate {{the costs and benefits}} of various levels of treatment for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA) in adults using a burden of disease framework. Method. Population burden was calculated for both diseases in the absence of any treatment as years lived with disability (YLD), ignoring the years of life lost. We then estimated the proportion of <b>burden</b> averted <b>with</b> current interventions, the proportion that could be averted with optimally implemented cut-rent evidence-based guidelines, and the direct treatment cost-effectiveness ratio in dollars per YLD averted for both treatment levels. Results. The majority of people with arthritis sought medical treatment. Current treatment for RA averted 26 % of the <b>burden,</b> <b>with</b> a cost-effectiveness ratio of $ 19, 000 per YLD averted. Optimal, evidence-based treatment would avert 48 % of the <b>burden.</b> <b>with</b> a cost-effectiveness ratio of $ 12, 000 per YLD averted. Current treatment of OA in Australia averted 27 % of the <b>burden,</b> <b>with</b> a cost-effectiveness ratio of $ 25, 000 per YLD averted. Optimal, evidence-based treatment would avert 39 % of the <b>burden,</b> <b>with</b> an unchanged cost-effectiveness ratio of $ 25, 000 per YLD averted. Conclusion. While the precise dollar costs in each country will differ, the relativities at this level of coverage should remain the same. There is no evidence that closing the gap between evidence and practice would result in a drop in efficiency...|$|R
