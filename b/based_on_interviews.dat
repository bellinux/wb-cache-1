5|$|According to Geisel's biographers Judith and Neil Morgan, Horton Hatches the Egg {{was born}} in 1940, the day after New Year's, {{when he took a}} break from drawing in his Park Avenue {{apartment}} and went for a walk.

This account was <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>interviews</b> with Geisel, who had told similar stories about the book's creation to reporters asking about his creative process since as early as 1957.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare {{psychiatric}} diagnoses <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>interview</b> information with those <b>based</b> <b>on</b> best-estimate procedures, to evaluate information used in such procedures, and to use 5 -year follow-up data to determine whether the bestestimate diagnosis is an improvement over the interview-based diagnosis. Method: Psychiatric diagnoses were <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>interview</b> reports from 373 probands and 2, 615 relatives participating in a high-risk family study of alcoholism. The diagnosis also included clinician ratings in a bestestimate procedure of this study. Results: For most diagnoses, both sensitivity and specificity, using the best-estimate diagnosis (BED) as the gold standard, were excellent, in both relatives and probands. Substance abuse was an exception, with very low sensitivity, although specificity rates were excellent. For nonsubstance diagnoses, specificity was high, but sensitivity ranged from 59 % to 84 % across relatives and probands. In general, BED procedures led to higher prevalence estimates than thos...|$|R
