5|$|Fukuda's {{training}} method consisted mostly {{of the student}} taking fall after fall for the teacher or senior student until he <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> {{the mechanics of the}} technique. Fukuda stressed applied technique over ritual form. He gave beginners a short description of the technique and had them engage in free practice (randori) in order to teach through experience. It was only after the student had attained some proficiency that he taught them traditional forms (kata). This method was difficult, as there were no special mats for falling, only the standard straw mats (tatami) laid over wooden floors.|$|E
5|$|During that period, general {{relativity}} remained {{something of a}} curiosity among physical theories. It was clearly superior to Newtonian gravity, being consistent with special relativity and accounting for several effects unexplained by the Newtonian theory. Einstein himself had shown in 1915 how his theory explained the anomalous perihelion advance of the planet Mercury without any arbitrary parameters (""). Similarly, a 1919 expedition led by Eddington confirmed {{general relativity}}'s prediction for the deflection of starlight by the Sun during the total solar eclipse of May 29, 1919, making Einstein instantly famous. Yet the theory entered the mainstream of theoretical physics and astrophysics only with the developments between approximately 1960 and 1975, {{now known as the}} golden age of general relativity. Physicists <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the concept of a black hole, and to identify quasars as one of these objects' astrophysical manifestations. Ever more precise solar system tests confirmed the theory's predictive power, and relativistic cosmology, too, became amenable to direct observational tests.|$|E
25|$|While in Rome {{he started}} to restructure the Italian {{prosecution}} system, creating district offices to fight the Mafia and a national office to fight organised crime. Next was his move to prevent Carnevale from reviewing the sentence of the Maxi Trial. In {{a blow to the}} Mafia, the Maxi Trial convictions were upheld by the Supreme Court in January 1992. To the surprise of many, Falcone's move to Rome was very successful. He achieved a genuine revolution in the judiciary. The Mafia <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> that Falcone was even more dangerous in Rome than he had been in Palermo.|$|E

25|$|While {{growing up}} in Puerto Rico in the 1950s and 1960s, La Luz’s {{grandfather}} used {{to take him to}} the tobacco, coffee and sugarcane fields in Puerto Rico where he witnessed first hand the plight of poor Puerto Ricans who were toiling these fields to earn their meager livelihoods. Having seen the swollen bellies of their children who were malnourished and whose fathers pushed relentlessly to work the fields while living in the poorest of conditions – many in shacks without running water, electricity and with poor hygienic conditions – La Luz <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the importance of working for the sensible human rights of those who had no voice. The fight for basic rights and justice for all people, no matter who they were or where they were from became his life’s passion.|$|E
25|$|Psychologists Jack Block and Jeanne Block {{evaluated}} Genie in February 1971 and put {{her language}} below the two-year-old level on the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale. During the next month her vocabulary acquisition began to accelerate at a progressively more rapid pace, with observers putting her active vocabulary at over 100 words. Doctors noted that she seemed to know far more words than she would spontaneously say, but {{could not be sure}} about the extent of either her receptive or expressive vocabulary because she was so responsive to nonverbal stimuli. After another month, Genie began spontaneously producing one-word utterances and <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> increasingly complex sentences. Soon after she appeared to understand some basic elements of the give-and-take nature of conversation, and without prompting could provide non-imitative one-word responses to statements or questions.|$|E
25|$|His journey {{started when}} {{he studied the}} Qur'an in a literal way, and he slowly <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the {{principles}} lined in the religion. Then something happened to him in America to remove his doubts. He says; {{that while he was}} going to America, he was on the boat (ferry), and he saw the way the boat he was travelling in – was rocking in the huge sea – all under the control of Allah without it sinking or capsizing. At that point he realized the power of Allah. He said Iman (belief) entered into his heart due to this. His second scenario was in San Francisco, when he went on top of a mountain, and he could see the whole of creation in front of him, and he realized the beauty and harmony that existed amongst the creation as a whole. He said that, the sweetness of Iman hit him.|$|E

25|$|Hobbs' {{breakthrough}} came in 1901, and {{he began}} to believe he could succeed as a cricketer. His batting improved throughout the season, during which he appeared for two local sides, Ainsworth and the Cambridge Liberals. Appearing for the former against the latter, he scored 102, his first century. His performances in the season meant that he was picked for an annual charity match played between a team representing Cambridge and a team of professional cricketers brought by the Cambridge-born Surrey cricketer Tom Hayward. Hobbs was a last minute replacement, and although he scored just 26 not out, was comfortable playing against the professionals; Hobbs was delighted that he could compete at a higher level, and he <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the best way to bat effectively. At the end of the season, he was invited to play as an amateur for Cambridgeshire, even though his record in club cricket was unremarkable. He was not particularly successful, reaching double figures just once, but his experiences in the season increased his determination to pursue a career in cricket.|$|E
25|$|That {{following}} day, 14 February 1779, Cook {{marched through}} the village to retrieve the King. Cook took the King (aliʻi nui) by his own hand and led him willingly away. One of Kalaniʻōpuʻu's favorite wives, Kanekapolei and two chiefs approached the group as they were heading to boats. They pleaded with the king not to go until he stopped and sat where he stood. An old kahuna (priest), chanting rapidly while holding out a coconut, attempted to distract Cook and his men as a large crowd began to form at the shore. The king <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> that Cook was his enemy. As Cook turned his back to help launch the boats, he was struck on the head by the villagers and then stabbed to death as he fell on {{his face in the}} surf. He was first struck on the head with a club by a chief named Kalaimanokahoʻowaha or Kanaʻina (namesake of Charles Kana'ina) and then stabbed by one of the king's attendants, Nuaa. The Hawaiians carried his body away towards the back of the town, still visible to the ship through their spyglass. Four marines, Corporal James Thomas, Private Theophilus Hinks, Private Thomas Fatchett and Private John Allen, were also killed and two others were wounded in the confrontation.|$|E
500|$|Once {{his studies}} were completed, Balzac was persuaded {{by his father}} to follow him into the Law; for three years he trained and worked {{at the office of}} Victor Passez, a family friend. During this time Balzac <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the vagaries of human nature. In his 1840 novel Le Notaire, he wrote that a young person in the legal {{profession}} sees [...] "the oily wheels of every fortune, the hideous wrangling of heirs over corpses not yet cold, the human heart grappling with the Penal Code." ...|$|E

Auerbach received an athletic scholarship to the basketball program of Bill Reinhart at George Washington University in Washington, D.C. Auerbach was a standout basketball player and graduated with a M.A. in 1941. In those years, Auerbach <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> {{the importance of the}} fast break, appreciating how potent three charging attackers against two back-pedalling defenders could be.|$|E
500|$|Although the {{division}} of labour inherent in prescriptive technologies is usually associated with the industrial revolution, Franklin points out that such production methods have been used since ancient times. Chinese bronze casting before 1200 BC for example, required a tightly controlled and closely supervised production process {{as well as a}} strict division of labour. Franklin writes that when she studied Chinese bronze casting as a metallurgist, [...] "the extraordinary social meaning of prescriptive technologies dawned on me. I <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> what they meant, not just in terms of casting bronze but in terms of discipline and planning, of organization and command." ...|$|E

In 2011, Carlsen said: [...] "Thanks to [...] I <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> a whole class of positions better.... Kasparov gave me a great deal of practical help."

Before we really <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> disease and the weather and things like that, we sought false explanations for them. Now science has filled {{in some of the}} realm– not all– that religion used to fill. But the mystery and the beauty of the world is overwhelmingly amazing, and there's no scientific explanation of how it came about. To say that it was generated by random numbers, that does seem, you know, sort of an uncharitable view [...] I think it makes sense to believe in God, but exactly what decision in your life you make differently because of it, I don't know." ...|$|E
500|$|Fox {{crossed into}} Ontario {{at the town}} of Hawkesbury on the last Saturday in June. He was met by a brass band and {{thousands}} of residents who lined the streets to cheer him on, while the Ontario Provincial Police gave him an escort throughout the province. Despite the sweltering heat of summer, he continued to run [...] per day. On his arrival in Ottawa, Fox met Governor General Ed Schreyer and Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau and was the guest of honour at numerous sporting events in the city. In front of 16,000 fans, he performed a ceremonial kickoff at a Canadian Football League game and was given a standing ovation. Fox's journal reflected his growing excitement at the reception he had received as he <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> how deeply moved Canadians were by his efforts.|$|E
500|$|In the English version, he was {{voiced by}} Maile Flanagan in [...] {{film as a}} toddler, and Amanda C. Miller in the Boruto film as a teenager. In the Japanese version, he was voiced by Kokoro Kikuchi in The Last as a toddler; for the Boruto film and anime, he is voiced by Yūko Sanpei. Sanpei was thankful for being offered this {{position}} and joked about how Junko Takeuchi became a [...] "father" [...] as her voice role was Naruto. Initially, Sanpei recalls having difficulties voicing Boruto; when she received her script for the film, she <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> Boruto's concept as the boy who loves his father dearly, which helped her voice the character better. Please with the film Boruto, Sanpei asked Kishimoto to make another one which resulted in Kishimoto asking her to let him rest for another one.|$|E

500|$|A {{turning point}} in the book occurs when Rita {{falls in love with a}} gambler named L. D. Tolbrook, who seduces Rita and {{introduces}} her to prostitution. Her mother's hospitalization and death of her brother Bailey's wife drives Rita to her mother's home. She leaves her young son with a caretaker, Big Mary, but when she returns for him, she finds that Big Mary had disappeared with Clyde. She tries to elicit help from Tolbrook, who puts her in her place when she finds him at his home and requests that he help her find her son. She finally realizes that he had been taking advantage of her, but is able to trace Big Mary and Clyde to Bakersfield, California, and has an emotional reunion with her son. She writes, [...] "In the plowed farmyard near Bakersfield, I <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> that uniqueness of the person.

500|$|As {{part of her}} {{preparation}} for each day's filming, she had the Trill spots applied by makeup artist Mary Kay Morse, with Michael Westmore working on her detailing instead. This was a change from when Farrell had portrayed Jadzia, as in that case, Westmore had applied the spots himself each day. She made her first appearance in the season seven opener, [...] "Image in the Sand", for which she was required for only half a day, as she was in only one scene. [...] "I came in and I had one line — that's it, I hadn't even moved to L.A. yet and I hadn't found a place to live." [...] She <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> what was required of her from her second episode onwards. She later explained that [...] "I never really got too freaked in the beginning.

500|$|In the {{afternoon}} General Winkelman received information about armoured forces advancing in the Langstraat region, {{on the road}} between 's-Hertogenbosch and the Moerdijk bridges. He still fostered hopes that those forces were French, but the announcement by Radio Bremen at 23:00 that German tanks had linked up with the paratroopers ended those hopes. At last he <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> {{the essence of the}} German strategy. He ordered the artillery batteries in the Hoekse Waard to try to destroy the Moerdijk bridges and sent a special engineering team to Rotterdam to blow up the Willemsbrug. Pessimistic about the general situation at this point, he also ordered the vast strategic oil reserves of Royal Dutch Shell at Pernis to be set on fire. [...] Having been informed by Winkelman of his concerns earlier in {{the afternoon}}, the Dutch government asked Winston Churchill for three British divisions to turn the tide. The new prime minister answered that he simply did not have any reserves; however, three British torpedo boats were sent to Lake IJssel. Also, 2nd Welsh Guard battalion was prepared to be sent to Hook of Holland though it would not arrive in time.|$|E
