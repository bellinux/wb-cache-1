40|$|Limewash is a versatile, accommodating, {{and robust}} surface {{covering}} that {{is compatible with}} a variety of building surfaces. It is maintainable, beautiful, stable, and long lasting. It is an aesthetic statement to many cultures, from the white houses of Greece, to earth tones of the southwest United States. This paper takes an on-site look at the practical aspects of limewashing {{on a wide variety of}} substrates and in a wide range of climates, including: • Types of compatible substrates; • Preparation of the substrate for lime washing; • Use of pigments and additives; • Application techniques on different substrates; • Application techniques in different climates; and • Maintenance. The authors combine their experiences from both the science of lime and the practical application of lime, stone, and earth construction in Europe, America, and Australia [...] from lime plastering the Globe Theatre in London, England to lime washing modern three-coat stucco in Las Vegas, Nevada. ∗ © Copyright NLA <b>Building</b> <b>Lime</b> Group 2005 The views presented in this paper are solely those of the authors.

30|$|In 2010, new European <b>building</b> <b>lime</b> {{standard}} EN 459 - 1, modified {{from previous}} version, was published [12]. Comparing to old version, {{natural hydraulic lime}} (NHL), formulated lime (FL) and hydraulic lime (HL) {{under the category of}} limes with hydraulic properties has been clearly specified. Natural hydraulic lime, its use can be dated back to Romans [13], is a lime with hydraulic properties produced by burning of more or less argillaceous or siliceous limestones with reduction to powder by slaking with or without grinding. No other additions are allowed except grinding agents up to 0.1 wt%. Hydraulic lime is, however, a binder consisting of lime and other materials such as cement, blast furnace slag, fly ash, limestone filler and other suitable materials, but does not need to have a declaration of constituents. Formulated lime (FL), which is a new term, is a lime with hydraulic properties mainly consisting of air lime (CL) and/or natural hydraulic lime (NHL) with added hydraulic and/or pozzolanic material. To protect the user especially in restoration and conservation, formulated limes contain a constituent’s declaration.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} using {{different}} binding agents {{in combination with}} hemp shives and fibres in Lime-Hemp Concrete (LHC) building material was examined. LHC is a light composite building material with <b>building</b> <b>lime</b> as binding agents and hemp (Cannabis sativa) as a renewable raw material from agriculture. Contemporary LHC only uses the woody core part of the hemp, the shive. However, using both hemp shives and fibres may improve the mechanical strength, {{eliminating the need for}} a fibre separation process. The aim was to elucidate the feasibility of using the entire fragmented hemp stalk in an LHC, and to determine some important material properties such as compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, water sorption and frost resistance. LHC with varying inclusions of the lime-based binders were tested, as were five mixes using the binding agents hydrated lime, hydraulic lime, and cement. Specimens were cured for 12 weeks at room temperature and 40 days in a carbonation room (4. 5 vol% CO 2), and tested for mechanical properties, water sorption and frost resistance. Using both shives and fibres in LHC may be advantageous for countries such as Sweden where facilities for separating hemp from shives are not commercially available. (C) 2009 IAgrE.

40|$|EN 459 is {{the only}} {{standard}} currently available on <b>building</b> <b>lime</b> at European level and, {{even if it is}} a not compulsory norm, it has been acquired as national laws by all countries of European Union. Consequently, EN 459 {{is the only}} reference point for the lime used in the construction industry. As any specific standard for binders used in restoration works has been written until now, this means that EN 459 is also the only reference point in the field of conservation of cultural heritage. Consequently EN 459 can be seen both, as resource (because any other tool is given as guarantee of product quality) and as limitation (because this standard has not been designed for the conservation field but for all the limes used in the construction industry). Comparison between new (2010) and old (2001) version of the norm highlights an improvement process that drives some parts of this regulation toward the needs of conservation. But, as the norm is made to regulate all lime based products, it is clear that it will never meet the specific needs of conservation. For this reason, a technical analysis of different versions of this norm can help to understand some of the processes that drive innovation {{in one of the most}} important aspects of the restoration of cultural heritage...|$|E

40|$|This paper, and the {{research}} it describes, examines the benefits and importance of good site practice for the aftercare of lime mortars and renders. The control of moisture is explored in relation to mortar development. This work shows {{the way in which}} proper aftercare in terms of wetting, drying and protection enables lime mortars and renders to perform at their best. It is important that Architects, Engineers and specifiers can rely on craftspeople who understand the need for aftercare and ensure that best practice is followed. This paper provides a scientific explanation of how the traditional practice to control moisture, before and immediately following the application of <b>building</b> <b>limes,</b> works to improve set and durability. Scientific reasons for the traditional site practice of damping down the background to application of lime mixes, and the subsequent tending of finished work, are explained by reference to laboratory research developed for the purpose...|$|R

30|$|The {{considerable}} {{difference in}} properties of Conserv and Lithomex restoration mortars {{raise the question}} of whether stone repair materials should be more carefully selected. The results presented here highlight the importance of using a specification framework, similar to those for <b>building</b> <b>limes</b> [50], for stone repair materials. This would obviate the simple assumption of suitability of a restoration mortar for use on numerous substrate types [15 – 17, 50]. The importance attached to the evaluation of substrate properties concurs with previous studies undertaken by various researchers [15 – 17]. These results emphasize the need for a thorough understanding of material properties and site conditions in order to provide an understanding of how repair materials will perform. This must be viewed in conjunction with an appreciation of appropriate specification criteria for conservation work. Further research into the microstructural properties of these materials may give additional insights into the causes of their different physical properties. This should be combined with on-site observation and testing to identify any potentially problematic macro-scale issues associated with restoration mortars, particularly in relation to moisture transmission and retention. Understanding these factors amongst others, are essential to prevent damage to the built heritage through the use of incompatible repair materials.|$|R
40|$|In this {{multidisciplinary}} project lime-hemp is {{studied as}} a {{thermal insulating material}} for the renovation of historic timber and brick buildings*). Focus is on buildings in the historic city of Visby on the Swedish island of Gotland in the Baltic sea. Many historic buildings in Visby have over the past decades been thermally insulated with materials such as mineral wools and polystyrene. Due to this, damage caused by moisture and microbial growth has increased. As a consequence, cultural and historical values have been damaged. Lime-hemp is a sustainable building material that consists of hemp shiv and <b>building</b> <b>limes.</b> It works differently than conventional insulating materials; in addition to good thermal insulation properties, it also has good thermal mass and moisture buffering capacity. This project will study the durability of the lime-hemp, especially microbial growth and moisture problems, and opportunities for renovation of historic buildings, while creating a good indoor climate and preserving historical values. Lab-studies as well as full-scale studies are conducted. The aim of the project is to sustainably improve energy efficiency while preserving historical values, without durability problems. *) The project started in September 2016 and results are not expected until earliest autumn 2017.
