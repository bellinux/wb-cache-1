40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this {{exploratory}} {{study was to determine}} how knowledge workers could align the creation and management of <b>business</b> <b>records</b> with organisational records management needs. Problem investigated: Knowledge workers are employed by more than one organisation at the same time. This creates problems in managing and preserving the <b>business</b> <b>records</b> created and received by knowledge workers. This article investigates how organisations should manage and preserve their <b>business</b> <b>records</b> that are created and received by knowledge workers who are employed by more than one organisation. Methodology: The importance of the management of <b>business</b> <b>records</b> in the knowledge economy was discussed and in the empirical survey data was collected through a questionnaire survey of 122 knowledge workers at an investment management company. Findings: The results of the empirical survey revealed that the majority of respondents always save <b>business</b> <b>records</b> that they create on their own personal filing systems and that they are familiar with the concept of records management. The findings provided support for the hypothesis that knowledge workers take control of managing the <b>business</b> <b>records</b> of various organisations, as their careers consist of a series of projects or assignments, irrespective of the organisation employing them. Value of research: The active role that knowledge workers can play in the management of strategic <b>business</b> <b>records,</b> underlines its key position as an information management function in organisations. Further research is needed to clarify the importance of records management in the knowledge economy. Conclusion : Knowledge workers take control of managing the <b>business</b> <b>records</b> of various organisations, as their careers consist of a series of projects or assignments while working at different organisations. </p...|$|R

2500|$|Supporters of Romney hailed his <b>business</b> <b>record,</b> {{especially}} his {{success with the}} 2002 Olympics, as that of one who {{would be able to}} bring a new era of efficiency into Massachusetts politics. [...] He proposed to reorganize the state government and stressed his ability to obtain federal funds for the state. [...] Romney said he would [...] cut $1 billion out of the $23 billion state budget by eliminating the usual suspects of waste, fraud, and mismanagement while still reducing taxes over a phased period. He also said he was generally against tax increases, but refused to rule out the possibility; he did attempt to paint O'Brien as a 'tax-and-spend liberal'. [...] Romney contributed over $6million to his own campaign during the election, a state record at the time. [...] He raised nearly $10million for his campaign overall. [...] His campaign was the first to use microtargeting techniques, in which fine-grained groups of voters were reached with narrowly tailored messaging.|$|E

50|$|From its humble {{beginning}} with the Unsacred Hearts and Secret Dakota Ring, Serious <b>Business</b> <b>records</b> soon reached out to musical acquaintances and long-time friends Man in Gray, The Two Man Gentlemen Band, and DraculaZombieUSA. These 5 bands formed the nucleus of Serious <b>Business</b> <b>Records,</b> and though they had little in common musically, {{many of the same}} musicians were members of each band. This musical cross-pollination created a close-knit, almost family oriented structure to Serious <b>Business</b> <b>Records</b> that rests at the core of its philosophy as a label. Of the five members in Rocketship Park, only one is not in Higgins; the Homosexuals' current lineup includes two members of the Unsacred Hearts, and multi-instrumentalist Josh Kaufman regularly performs with Rocketship Park, Higgins, Jack and the Pulpits, and Secret Dakota Ring. This unique ideology has served Serious <b>Business</b> <b>Records</b> well—the debut records from Secret Dakota Ring and The Two Man Gentlemen Band have long since sold out, and the label continues to attract new bands.|$|R
