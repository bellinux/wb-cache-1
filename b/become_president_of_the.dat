5|$|Both Robert Bingham and Percy Haly died in 1937; with J. C. W. Beckham aging—he {{would die}} in 1940—Chandler moved {{to fill the}} {{leadership}} void in the faction. He soon came {{to believe he was}} destined to <b>become</b> <b>President</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States. In mid-1937, he began advocating for Marvel Mills Logan, Kentucky's junior senator, to be appointed to the Supreme Court, creating a Senate vacancy to which Chandler, as governor, could appoint himself. The death of Justice George Sutherland in January 1938 gave President Franklin D. Roosevelt the opportunity to accommodate Chandler's wishes, but Roosevelt preferred younger justices—Logan was 63—and Kentucky's senior Senator, Alben Barkley, recommended Solicitor General Stanley Forman Reed for the appointment. Roosevelt heeded Barkley's advice and appointed Reed instead of Logan.|$|E

He was also awarded an honorary doctorate from Bristol University, and at the award ceremony met the Conservative Party politician Winston Churchill, who was then engaged in writing his multi-volume A History of the English-Speaking Peoples; Churchill asked Wheeler to aid him in writing about late prehistoric and early medieval Britain, to which the latter agreed.|$|E

5|$|As {{the merger}} of the AFL and NFL became {{effective}} in 1970, the unions agreed to meet {{for the first time}} in January of that year. The NFL players wanted Ed Meador—who was the president-elect of the NFLPA prior to the merger—to <b>become</b> <b>president</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> newly combined association while the AFL players wanted Jack Kemp. The compromise was John Mackey of the Baltimore Colts, an NFL team before the merger, which was grouped with former AFL teams in the American Football Conference. The AFL players agreed to Mackey's election on the condition that former AFL player Alan Miller would become general counsel. Though the NFL owners were open to recognizing the union, their representatives requested lawyers not be present during negotiations, something the players were unwilling to agree to. This prompted the players to petition the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) for union certification.|$|E
5|$|Fantasia 2000, {{a sequel}} to the 1940 film {{that had been a}} pet-project of Roy E. Disney's since 1990, was {{released}} on January 1, 2000. Produced in pieces when artists were available between productions, Fantasia 2000 was the first animated feature produced for and released in IMAX format. A standard theatrical release followed in June, but the film's $90 million worldwide box office total against its $90 million production cost resulted in it losing $100 million for the studio. Peter Schneider left his post as president of Walt Disney Feature Animation in 1999 to <b>become</b> <b>president</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Walt Disney Studios under Joe Roth. Thomas Schumacher, who had been Schneider's vice president of animation for several years, became the new president of Walt Disney Feature Animation. By this time, competition from other studios had driven animators' incomes to all-time highs, making traditionally animated features even more costly to produce. Schumacher was tasked with cutting costs, and massive layoffs began to cut salaries and bring the studio's staff– which peaked at 2,200 people in 1999– down to approximately 1,200 employees.|$|E

The second report was published in November, recommending that County Court judges should be appointed to try cases, and the final report was published in February 1947 recommending {{the establishment of a}} Marriage Welfare Service. The reports were well received by the public and led to Denning being invited in 1949 to <b>become</b> <b>President</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> National Marriage Guidance Council.|$|E

5|$|In 1907, she vacationed in Germany, {{and enjoyed}} her time {{so much that}} she chose to remain in Europe to {{continue}} her piano studies. For the next two years she studied music in Vienna under Franz Xaver Scharwenka, pianist to the court of Francis Joseph I of Austria, and in Berlin under Martin Krause. After returning from Europe, Hogg settled in Houston with her brother William. Although the city had a population of about 100,000, it had no museums or parks and no professional theater, music, or ballet groups. Hogg chose to teach music and continued in this vocation for the next nine years. One of her first pupils was Jacques Abram, who later became a concert pianist. By 1913, Hogg had <b>become</b> <b>president</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Girls' Musical Society and was on the entertainment committee of the College Women's Club, which organized a small theater group known as the Green Mask Players. That year, she organized the Houston Symphony Orchestra. Hogg served as the vice-president of the Symphony Society when the first session of the Board of Directors convened.
