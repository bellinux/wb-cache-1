50|$|<b>Breacher</b> and Brentwood go to Lizzy's {{house and}} find Monster's body stuffed in a refrigerator.

Lizzy and Sugar ambush <b>Breacher,</b> and Brentwood assists <b>Breacher.</b> Lizzy and Sugar drive away, chased by <b>Breacher</b> and Brentwood.

50|$|<b>Breacher</b> and Brentwood visit Tripod, {{who left}} the DEA after being suspended, and find him dead after a shootout in which he killed an assailant <b>Breacher</b> {{identified}} as a cartel enforcer.

Brentwood apologizes to <b>Breacher,</b> and they have sex.|$|E
40|$|The {{existing}} literature on willful breach {{has not been}} able to define what should count as 2 ̆ 2 willful. 2 ̆ 2 I argue here that any definition we adopt has implications for just how high damages should be raised in those cases where a breach qualifies as willful. As a result, both of these issues-the definition of 2 ̆ 2 willful, 2 ̆ 2 and the measure of damages for willful breach-need to be considered simultaneously. Specifically, if a definition of 2 ̆ 2 willful 2 ̆ 2 excludes all <b>breachers</b> who behaved efficiently, then in theory we can raise the penalty on the remaining inefficient <b>breachers</b> to any arbitrarily high level (2 ̆ 2 throw the book at them 2 ̆ 2). But if, instead, a given definition of willful would catch even some efficient <b>breachers</b> in its net, the damages assessed against willful <b>breachers</b> should be more limited. In that case, damages for willful breach might still justifiably be raised, but they should be raised only to the level that is economically efficient...|$|R

5000|$|Explosive {{breaching}} can be {{the fastest}} method, though {{it is also the}} most dangerous, to both the <b>breachers</b> and the room occupants.

[...] Breaching can be performed with a specially formed breaching charge placed in contact with the door, or with various standoff breaching devices, such as specialized rifle grenades like the SIMON breach grenade.|$|R

50|$|These {{vehicles}} {{are equipped with}} mechanical or other means for the breaching of man made obstacles. Common types of breaching vehicles include mechanical flails, mine plough vehicles, and mine roller vehicles. In some cases, these vehicles will also mount Mine-clearing line charges. Breaching vehicles may be either converted armoured fighting vehicles or purpose built vehicles. In larger militaries, converted AFV {{are likely to be}} used as assault <b>breachers</b> while the breached obstacle is still covered by enemy observation and fire, and then purpose built breaching vehicles will create additional lanes for following forces.|$|R

60|$|On the 24th the {{batteries}} on Mount Olia, having effected what {{was believed to}} be a practicable breach, 2000 men of the fifth division, consisting of the 3d battalion of the Royals, the 38th, and the 9th, made an assault at night. To arrive at the breach they had to make their way along the slippery rocks on the bed of the Urumea, exposed to a flank-fire from the river-wall of the town.

50|$|Elements of the MSRT's primary assault force {{are known}} as a Direct Action Section (DAS). Members of a DAS may include a Team Leader, Comms/JTAC's, <b>Breachers,</b> Medics, Precision Marksmen Observation members (snipers/observers), and team members trained to {{identify}} Chemical Biological Nuclear Radiological (CBRN) threats. These assault force teams train extensively in advanced close quarters combat and advanced combat marksmanship. They are well equipped to quickly and surreptitiously board suspicious vessels, secure gas and oil platforms or secure land based targets by fast-roping from helicopters or using other undisclosed methods to neutralize enemy personnel. The Tactical Delivery Team (TDT), boat assault force, are trained in advanced vessel delivery tactics and stealthy delivery of the main assault force (DAS) as well as follow on forces.|$|R
2500|$|A breach or a lunge is a {{leap out}} of the water, also known as cresting. The {{distinction}} between the two is fairly arbitrary: cetacean researcher Hal Whitehead defines a breach as any leap in which at least 40% of the animal's body clears the water, and a lunge as a leap with less than 40% clearance. Qualitatively, a breach is a genuine jump with an intent to clear the water, whereas a lunge {{is the result of a}} fast upward-sloping swim that has caused the whale to clear the surface of the water unintentionally. This latter [...] "lunging" [...] behaviour is often a result of feeding in rorquals. The right, humpback and sperm whales are the most widely observed jumpers. However other baleen whales such as fin, blue, minke, gray and sei whales also breach. Oceanic dolphins, including the orca, are very common <b>breachers</b> and are in fact capable of lifting themselves completely {{out of the}} water very easily, although there is little distinction between this and porpoising. Some non-cetacean marine creatures also exhibit breaching behavior, such as several shark species and rays of the genera Manta and Mobula.|$|R
40|$|Background: The study evaluates a {{group of}} Military Service Members {{specialized}} in blast explosive training called “Breachers” who are routinely exposed to multiple low-level blasts while teaching breaching at the U. S. Marine Corps in Quantico Virginia. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine if there are any acute or long-term auditory changes due to repeated low-level blast exposures used in training. The performance of the instructor group “Breachers” was compared to a control group, “Engineers”. Methods: A total of 11 <b>Breachers</b> and four engineers were evaluated in the study. The participants received comprehensive auditory tests, including pure-tone testing, speech-in-noise (SIN) measures, and central auditory behavioral and objective tests using early and late (P 300) auditory evoked potentials over a period of 17 months. They also received shorter assessments immediately following the blast-exposure onsite at Quantico. Results: No acute or longitudinal effects were identified. However, there were some interesting baseline effects found in both groups. Contrary to the expected, the onsite hearing thresholds and distortion product otoacoustic emissions were slightly better at a few frequencies immediately after blast-exposure than measurements obtained with the same equipment weeks to months after each blast-exposure. Conclusions: To date, the current study is the most comprehensive study that evaluates the long-term effects of blast-exposure on hearing. Despite extensive testing to assess changes, the findings of this study suggest that the levels of current exposures used in this military training environment do not seem to have an obvious deleterious effect on hearing...|$|R
