40|$|Automatic {{identification}} of the necrotic zone boundary {{is important in the}} assessment of treatments on in vitro tumour spheroids. This has been difficult especially when the difference in cell density between the necrotic and viable zones of a tumour spheroid is small. To help overcome this problem, we developed novel one-dimensional pair-correlation functions (PCFs) to provide quantitative estimates of the radial distance of the necrotic zone boundary from the centre of a tumour spheroid. We validate our approach on synthetic tumour spheroids in which the position of the necrotic zone boundary is known a priori. It is then applied to nine real tumour spheroids imaged with light sheet-based fluorescence microscopy. PCF estimates of the necrotic zone boundary are compared with those of a human expert and an existing standard computational method. S. Dini, B. J. <b>Binder,</b> <b>S.</b> C. Fischer, C.

40|$|Prions are {{involved}} in the pathogenesis of the fatal neurodegenerative disorders called transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) such as scrapie in sheep, BSE in cattle and Creutzfeldt-Jakob-Disease in humans. The pathogenic form of the prion protein (PrPSc) represents the infectious agent and the currently only known marker for prion disease. PrPSc is caused by misfolding and aggregation of the cellular prion protein (PrPC) and it is stored as plaques and prion rods mainly in the brain. Because of the biochemical similarity of the prion protein isoforms, the development of pre-clinical diagnostic tests that could reliably discriminate between the conformations has failed up to date. In this study, therefore, the following strategies were employed to isolate PrPSc-specific aptamers by: (i) selection against PrP 27 - 30 that was isolated from infected hamster brains, (ii) selection against conformation-specific epitopes by employing a peptide approach and (iii) selection against in vitro aggregated, but soluble PrP-oligomers. It turned out that PrPSc was no suitable target for in vitro selection. This was likely due to its inhomogenity. Consequently, peptides were designed to mimic the conformational epitopes of PrPSc which are masked in PrPC. Highly affinic and specific aptamers against Tyr-Tyr-Arg-motif of pathogenic prion protein were successfully isolated. The apparent dissociation constants of these aptamers were determined in the nanomolar range. Binding motifs could be defined by using primary and secondary structure analysis. The best <b>binder</b> <b>S</b> 3 - 20 was reduced to the minimal binding motif without loss of affinity. The aptamers were also capable to bind to PrP-oligomers that were used as a model for PrPSc with a Kd of 800 nM and to discriminate between the two isoforms with a factor of two. However, the specificity of these aptamers was not satisfactory. Therfore, an additional selection was performed and novel aptamers were raised against PrP-oligomers. These aptamers exhibited dissociation constants in the range of 640 - 680 nM and the discrimination factor could be enhanced to 3 to 5. These isolated aptamers that will serve as starting point for further cycles of in vitro evolution to achieve higher affinity and specificity for PrPSc...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Sadum {{is one of}} the {{traditional}} cloths of the Batak people in North Sumatra. It is woven on a back strap loom with supplementary weft technique. Sadum is a warp faced weaving made of cotton and beads woven into the cloth. Ritually it is used as a shoulder cloth, gifts exchanges, and in dances. It also bears the symbol of good tidings and blessings for the receiver. The cloth has change during times in technique, color, patterns, as well as in functions. But the use as a ritual cloth stays the same. The basic weaving techniques and equipments used to create it hasn’t change, but its material and added techniques has made this cloth become more rich in color, pattern, and texture. Most changes began when the Europeans came to Indonesia and introduced new material such as synthetic fibers and colors. In the 70 <b>s</b> traditional <b>cloth</b> of Indonesia got its boost when the government declared batik as Indonesian national attire. This encourages other traditional weavings to develop into contemporary clothing. Later, new techniques and material were introduced to the Sadum weavings including embroidery, silk and golden threads which were never used before...|$|R
40|$|Emphysema {{is one of}} the {{hallmarks}} of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), a devastating lung disease often caused by smoking. Emphysema appears on Computed Tomography (CT) scans as a variety of textures that correlate with the disease subtypes. It has been shown that the disease subtypes and the lung texture are linked to physiological indicators and prognosis, although neither is well characterized clinically. Most previous computational approaches to modeling emphysema imaging data have focused on supervised classification of lung textures in patches of CT scans. In this work, we describe a generative model that jointly captures heterogeneity of disease subtypes and of the patient population. We also derive a corresponding inference algorithm that simultaneously discovers disease subtypes and population structure in an unsupervised manner. This approach enables us to create image-based descriptors of emphysema beyond those that can be identified through manual labeling of currently defined phenotypes. By applying the resulting algorithm to a large data set, we identify groups of patients and disease subtypes that correlate with distinct physiological indicators. by Polina <b>Binder.</b> Thesis: <b>S.</b> M., Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, 2016.

40|$|My {{original}} {{desire to}} study an urban center which still produced elaborate handmade textiles {{was to provide}} some possible clues to more seriously consider the practical side of historic production. In other words, what were the physical concerns and limitations of cloth production. In the end I learned that textiles often function in a very complex, multidimensional form and cannot be truly understood without considering many facets of the society which produced them. Conversely, in societies where textiles are highly valued, their study can add much to understanding everything from cultural values, economics and technology to international politics. In addition to the obvious subject of this paper, handweaving in everyday life of artisans, merchants and consumers in Fez, my object in this presentation is twofold. First I would like to help form {{a better understanding of}} the degree of specialization and complexity of cloth in a society which has traditionally depended upon handwoven production. Secondly I would like to provide a basic knowledge, a certain degree of comfort, and thus an appreciation about drawlooms and the fabrics produced by them. The means I have chosen to achieve this two point agenda is to introduce three weaving workshops which were active in the late 19802 ̆ 7 s in the old city of Fez, Morocco, noting the physical surroundings and learning of the weavers 2 ̆ 7 training as well as their business concerns. We will conclude our exposure in the textile showroom of an old, well established crafts family that has successfully made the transition to industrial production while still maintaining much of the essence of the Moroccan cloth tradition. As noted in the foregoing papers presented on this panel, Fez is an urban center which has long been associated with cloth production. During the 14 th century when it was considered second only to Cairo in the Moslem world, Ibn Abi Zar 1 a contemporary writer cites documents that indicate that as early as the 12 century the city already had over 3, 000 looms while a 16 th century account, written shortly after the Andulian migration, states that there were 20, 000 textile workers in the city. 2 Even today when most of the world 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>cloth</b> is produced industrially the Handweavers Cooperative Association, a government sponsored organization supporting commercial handwoven production has a sizeable membership.

Fifty ceramic bars (2. 0 x 3. 0 x 2. 5 mm) were produced and randomly divided into five groups (n= 10), according to surface treatments: C: Control; Cer: Ceramaster (60 s); CW: cloth wheel with large-grit diamond (30 <b>s)</b> + <b>cloth</b> wheel with fine-grit diamond paste (30 s); E: grey Exa-Cerapol (20 s) + pink Exa-Cerapol (20 s) + Cerapol Super (20 s); F: Felt wheel with large-grit diamond paste (30 s) + Felt wheel with fine-grit diamond paste (30 s). The samples were evaluated quantitatively for surface roughness (Ra) and qualitatively by SEM, at different moments: initial (prior to roughening), after roughening and after polishing procedures.
