So we develop a <b>bellows</b> <b>type</b> micro contact probe. Our micro contact probe is a vertical-type micro contact probe for area arrays and narrow pitch electrode pads.

The quartz actuators with large displacement have not been developed because quartz has small piezoelectric constants compared to other materials such as PZT. However, we proved that a smart mechanism enabled {{us to have a}} large displacement up to 200 microns with a millimeter size suspended actuator using the piezoelectricity of quartz. As examples, we fabricated <b>bellows</b> <b>type</b> actuators and optical choppers, and measured their mechanical characteristics.

50|$|Welded bellows (also called edge-welded, or {{diaphragm}} bellows) {{are manufactured}} by welding {{a number of}} individually formed diaphragms to each other. The comparison between the two <b>bellows</b> <b>types</b> generally centers on cost and performance. Hydroformed bellows generally have a high tooling cost, but, when mass-produced, may have a lower piece price. However, hydroformed bellows have lower performance characteristics due to relatively thick walls and high stiffness. Welded metal bellows are produced with a lower initial tooling cost and maintain higher performance characteristics. The drawback of welded bellows is the reduced metal strength at weld joints, caused by the high temperature of welding.|$|R

The analysis of static characteristic shows that compensation volume and variation of pressure compensate margin {{are limited to}} each other.

Therefore, a new type of pressure compensation unit is developed, it has advantages of big volume compensation and almost constant pressure compensate margin, it solves the core technical problem of deep-water balancing hydraulic power.

Expansion joints can be non-metallic or metallic (often called <b>bellows</b> <b>type).</b> Non-metallic can be a single ply of rubberized material or a composite made of multiple layers of heat and erosion resistant flexible material. Typical layers are: outer cover to act a gas seal, a corrosion-resistant material such as Teflon, a layer of fiberglass to act as aninsulator and to add durability, several layers of insulation {{to ensure that the}} heat transfer from the flue gas is reduced to the required temperature and an inside layer.|$|R

40|$|The {{relative}} stability and ergodicity of deterministic time-reversible thermostats, both singly and in coupled pairs, are assessed through their Lyapunov spectra. Five <b>types</b> of <b>thermostat</b> are coupled {{to one another}} through a single Hooke's-Law harmonic spring. The resulting dynamics shows that three specific <b>thermostat</b> <b>types,</b> Hoover-Holian, Ju-Bulgac, and Martyna-Klein-Tuckerman, have very similar Lyapunov spectra in their equilibrium four-dimensional phase spaces and when coupled in equilibrium or nonequilibrium pairs. All three of these oscillator-based thermostats are shown to be ergodic, with smooth analytic Gaussian distributions in their extended phase spaces (coordinate, momentum, and two control variables). Evidently these three ergodic and time-reversible <b>thermostat</b> <b>types</b> are particularly useful as statistical-mechanical thermometers and thermostats. Each of them generates Gibbs' universal canonical distribution internally {{as well as for}} systems to which they are coupled. Thus they obey the Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics, as a good heat bath should. They also provide dissipative heat flow with relatively small nonlinearity when two or more such bath temperatures interact and provide useful deterministic replacements for the stochastic Langevin equation.

50|$|The {{metal bellows}} {{accumulators}} function similarly to the compressed gas type, except the elastic diaphragm or floating piston {{is replaced by}} a hermetically sealed welded metal bellows. Fluid may be internal or external to the bellows. The advantages to the metal <b>bellows</b> <b>type</b> include exceptionally low spring rate, allowing the gas charge to do all the work with little change in pressure from full to empty, and a long stroke relative to solid (empty) height, which gives maximum storage volume for a given container size. The welded metal bellows accumulator provides an exceptionally high level of accumulator performance, and can be produced with a broad spectrum of alloys resulting in a broad range of fluid compatibility. Another advantage to this type {{is that it does not}} face issues with high pressure operation, thus allowing more energy storage capacity.|$|R

50|$|Fin brakes {{involve a}} metal fin being {{attached}} to the underside of a train. The track is fitted with two computer-controlled squeezing mechanisms which upon closing, squeeze the fin and either slow or stop the train. Fin brakes {{are the most common}} form of brakes on roller coasters today. Sometimes they are thick metal box beams (mostly on Bolliger & Mabillard roller coasters); others are thin metal plates. They slide between pairs of friction pads similar to automotive brake pads. Fin brakes are designed to be fail-safe, so that a loss of power will cause them to engage. Brakes are constructed according to a certain measure of redundancy, meaning the ride is usually fitted with one extra set of brakes to bring the train to a hold even if one brake fails. Opening is done by a <b>bellows</b> <b>type</b> of air-operated actuator. Each set of brakes is fitted with its own air supply system controlled by supply valves which open the brake when it is safe to do so. A heavy spring, usually made of steel, is used to hold the brake closed by default.|$|R

40|$|Postoperative right {{ventricular}} (RV) {{failure is}} difficult to treat and develops from functional impairment of the underlying free wall and septum. This report describes the vital importance of the ventricular septum in RV structure /function relationships, demonstrates how the helical ventricular myocardial band model defines spatial geometry of the free wall and septum to provide architectural reasons for RV dynamic action, and focuses upon pathophysiologic reasons for adverse perioperative events resulting in right ventricular failure. Myocyte fiber orientation {{is the key to}} ventricular performance in health and disease. The transverse geometry of the free wall allows constriction (<b>bellows</b> <b>type</b> motion), whereas oblique septal fiber orientation and midline septal position is essential for ventricular twisting, the vital mechanism for RV ejection against increased pulmonary vascular resistance. The septum is considered ‚Äúthe lion or motor of RV performance‚Äù. This central muscle mass occupies ~ 40 % of myocardial ventricular weight, and injury from impaired myocardial protection is a preventable event. Septal function should be the index of adequacy of myocardial protection and we will show echocardiographic evidence that the integrated cardioplegic method prevents its injury. Dysfunction of a normally functioning septum following surgical cardiac procedures calls for reevaluation of myocardial protection methods...|$|R

The dilatometeris based on the principle of con¬Øned compression and comprises of a pressure cell used in combination with a tensile testing machine with rotation capability. The design of the pressure cell is a mixture of atraditional 'piston-die type' dilatometer and a Couette rheometer, i. e. piston and die make up an annular shaped sample spacing. Typical dimensions of annular samples are: inner radius ri = 10. 5 mm, outerradius ro = 11. 0 mm, height h = 2. 5 mm, and a typical mass of about 60 - 70 mg. Silicon grease is used to reduce loss of hydrostatic pressure in the sample due to friction occurring between the solidifying sampleand dilatometer wall. Specific volume measurements at low cooling rate using an isotactic polypropylene (i-PP) are compared with measurements performed using a commercial <b>bellows</b> <b>type</b> dilatometer, showing relative di¬Æerences in the range of 0. 1 - 0. 4 %.
