5|$|Copa Libertadores was {{the only}} {{continental}} competition in South America until {{the creation of the}} Supercopa Libertadores in 1988, and the Recopa Sudamericana in 1989. The first was contested <b>between</b> <b>past</b> champions of the main continental tournament, while the second was played by the winners of the Libertadores and the Supercopa of the previous year. In 1992, Copa CONMEBOL was established, being a competition for the best-placed clubs in the national leagues that did not qualify for the Copa Libertadores. Other Copas were also created by the continental confederation in the 1990s, some of them with a single game, mainly contested <b>between</b> <b>past</b> winners of the previous competitions. Copa Mercosur and the Copa Merconorte replaced the Supercopa in 1998, and eventually absorbed Copa CONMEBOL in 2000. The two competitions were replaced by the Copa Sudamericana in 2002, which remains active as the second most important tournament on the continent.|$|E
5|$|In the Rogue Cut version, Rogue's role is more consequential, and the {{narrative}} is more complex: When seeing Stryker causes Wolverine's consciousness to phase <b>between</b> <b>past</b> and future—resulting in his claws being extended, injuring Kitty Pryde—the Professor {{talks about the}} need for Wolverine to have more time back in 1973. Bobby Drake (Iceman) proposes breaking into the heavily guarded remains of Cerebro at the Professor's school, the one place where the Professor's mind can't reach others from the outside, in order to rescue Rogue, who is being held captive there. With the Professor and Magneto, he does so—at the cost of his own life—and Rogue is taken to where the mutants are making their last stand, where she takes over for Kitty in regards to keeping Wolverine's mind in 1973, for the remaining time until the moment history is changed, with a suggestion that Wolverine is aware of the switch as he appears to feel Rogue's presence. The Sentinels were able to find the X-Men through a tracking device inside a Sentinel's hand, which got stuck in the X-Jet after the Sentinel tried to prevent the Professor, Magneto and Rogue from escaping the incinerated remains of the X-Mansion. It also includes a scene where Mystique visits the X-Mansion at night while Charles and Logan are sleeping. She revisits her previous romance with Beast but leaves very early the next morning and breaks Cerebro in order to prevent Charles from finding her.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} decade, Atlético {{won the state}} league in 1991 and first saw success at continental level in 1992, when it won the inaugural Copa CONMEBOL. The team, managed by Procópio Cardoso, defeated Paraguay's Olimpia in the finals to claim its first official international title. As champion of that competition, the club {{took part in the}} 1993 Copa de Oro, in which it eliminated rivals Cruzeiro in the semi-finals but eventually lost to Argentina's Boca Juniors. After finishing fourth in the 1994 Brasileirão, {{the following}} year saw the club win the state league and reach the finals of the Copa CONMEBOL for a second time. This one ended in defeat to Argentine team Rosario Central on penalties, after Atlético won the first leg by 4–0 and lost the second one by the same score. In 1996, Atlético participated in the Copa Masters CONMEBOL, a competition <b>between</b> <b>past</b> winners of the Copa CONMEBOL that was played in Cuiabá; Atlético eliminated Rosario Central in the semi-finals but lost to São Paulo in the final match. The team also finished third in that year's Brasileiro and fourth in the following edition, falling in the semi-finals of both seasons. Another triumph came in the 1997 Copa CONMEBOL, when an Atlético team that included Marques and Cláudio Taffarel defeated Argentina's Lanús in the finals, and won the trophy for a second time. In 1999, after another Campeonato Mineiro title, a Galo side led by Marques and Guilherme, the top scorer in the league, reached the Série A finals for the fourth time, but lost to Corinthians. Despite international success and good performances in the Série A, the decade was marked by bad club administration by Atlético's presidents and deteriorating finances, which made the club one of the most indebted in Brazilian football.|$|E

5|$|Each Surface overworld had a {{specific}} theme: the forest overworld revolved around landforms altering gameplay, the volcano overworld focused around {{changing the rules}} of gameplay, while the desert overworld was themed around duality <b>between</b> <b>past</b> and present. The first areas, the Sealed Grounds and Faron Woods, were created so players could be eased into the game's mechanics and navigation. While the forest areas were made to be mostly flat, the Eldin Volcano overworld was made with height differences in mind to provide a greater challenge. Elements in the volcano terrain included areas of lava, and slopes where Link's sprinting ability would become necessary for reaching new areas. For the Lanayru Desert, the team created three different overworld zones due to its unique time shifting mechanics, triggered with Time Shift stones: this shifting between different zones was inspired by similar systems in Ocarina of Time and Twilight Princess. The portable Time Shift stones were one of many ideas included in the desert overworld as they did not fit with the forest or volcano environments. A difficult feature to include naturally was the remnants of Lanayru's Ancient Civilization, which used electricity to power both its technology and citizens. Enemy types that recurred in all Surface-based overworld areas were given slightly altered designs so they would be unique to each overworld. The Silent Realms were created as a new mechanic, filled with enemies {{that could not be}} defeated and relying on Link's sprinting ability rather than his weapons or items. While they had experimented with indestructible enemies in Phantom Hourglass and Spirit Tracks, but this time it was changed by restricting Link's options and actions. They also created a time limit for added strategy, as knowledge of the areas where the Spirit Realms were located was key to completing them. This was also why they were set up in areas players would already be familiar with. They were originally in the form of special dungeons, but this was discarded in favor of the familiar areas.|$|E

25|$|A {{very large}} number of fossils have now been {{discovered}} and identified. These fossils serve as a chronological record of evolution. The fossil record provides examples of transitional species that demonstrate ancestral links <b>between</b> <b>past</b> and present life forms. One such transitional fossil is Archaeopteryx, an ancient organism that had the distinct characteristics of a reptile (such as a long, bony tail and conical teeth) yet also had characteristics of birds (such as feathers and a wishbone). The implication from such a find is that modern reptiles and birds arose from a common ancestor.|$|E
25|$|The plot {{follows a}} {{non-sequential}} structure; it switches from past memories to present experiences, and often entangles the two. This meshing of memory with sensation creates confusion <b>between</b> <b>past</b> and present, {{in which no}} details are concrete. Words and phrases are repeated throughout the book, highlighting themes and recurring ideas. This redundancy generates a sense of obsession throughout the narrative, Erika's obsession to learn the truth, and Hilde's obsession to forget it. Coupled with repetition, Reichart's use of recurring words—such as alone, exclusion, and guilt—emphasize their importance to the main points and the extreme feelings Hilde feels about them.|$|E

25|$|The Wheeler–Feynman {{absorber}} theory (also {{called the}} Wheeler–Feynman time-symmetric theory), named after its originators, the physicists Richard Feynman and John Archibald Wheeler, is {{an interpretation of}} electrodynamics derived from {{the assumption that the}} solutions of the electromagnetic field equations must be invariant under time-reversal transformation, as are the field equations themselves. Indeed, there is no apparent reason for the time-reversal symmetry breaking, which singles out a preferential time direction and thus makes a distinction <b>between</b> <b>past</b> and future. A time-reversal invariant theory is more logical and elegant. Another key principle, resulting from this interpretation and reminiscent of Mach's principle due to Tetrode, is that elementary particles are not self-interacting. This immediately removes the problem of self-energies.|$|E
