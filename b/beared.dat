5|$|Ripken {{married the}} former Kelly Geer at Towson United Methodist Church on Friday, November 13, 1987. They have a daughter, Rachel, and a son, Ryan. Ryan, also a {{baseball}} player, {{was drafted by}} the Orioles in the 20th round of Major League Baseball's 2012 amateur draft. However, he chose to attend college instead, beginning his freshman year at the University of South Carolina in 2012. He transferred to Indian River Community College and was drafted in the 15th round of the Major League Baseball's 2014 amateur draft by the Washington Nationals. After being released by the Nationals in March 2017, he signed with the Orioles and {{was assigned to the}} Aberdeen Ironbirds, which were owned by his father and played at a stadium that <b>beared</b> his name. It was reported on April 28, 2016, that Ripken and his wife Kelly had divorced after a one-year separation.|$|E
25|$|During {{the interim}} peace, Hallamaa traded cracked Soviet ciphers with {{other states to}} fund Finnish signals {{intelligence}} operations—for example to the Swedes in exchange for RCA transmitters. Hallamaa was promoted to lieutenant colonel and appointed {{the commander of the}} HQ's Radio Battalion in October 1941 during the early months of the Continuation War. Finnish radio intelligence had grown from 75 persons during the Winter War to approximately 1,000 soldiers. Reportedly, they were able to decrypt 80 percent of Soviet messages on the Finnish front. Collaboration and exchange of Soviet ciphers with Japan <b>beared</b> fruit when the Soviets switched their western front ciphers in late 1941 with the eastern ciphers used in Vladivostok—immediately decryptable due to the exchange.|$|E

6000|$|One of the shepherd's early {{memories}} was of Dan'l Burdon, a labourer on {{the farm}} where Isaac Bawcombe was head-shepherd. He retained a vivid recollection of this person, who had a profound gravity and was the most silent man in the parish. He was always thinking about hidden treasure, and all his spare time was spent in seeking for it. On a Sunday morning, or in the evening after working hours, he would take a spade or pick and go away over the hills on his endless search after [...] "something he could not find." [...] He opened {{some of the largest}} barrows, making trenches six to ten feet deep through them, but found nothing to reward him. One day he took Caleb with him, and they went to a part of the down where there were certain depressions in the turf of a circular form and six to seven feet in circumference. Burdon had observed these basin-like depressions and had thought it possible they marked the place where things of value had been buried in long-past ages. To begin he cut the turf all round and carefully removed it, then dug and found a thick layer of flints. These removed, he came upon a deposit of ashes and charred wood. And that was all. Burdon without a word set to work to put it all back in its place again--ashes and wood, and earth and flints--and having trod it firmly down he carefully replaced the turf, then leaning on his spade gazed silently at the spot for a space of several minutes. At last he spoke. [...] "Maybe, Caleb, you've <b>beared</b> tell about what the Bible says of burnt sacrifice. Well now, I be of opinion that it were here. They people the Bible says about, they come up here to sacrifice on White Bustard Down, and these be the places where they made their fires." ...|$|E

50|$|Brown <b>bears</b> usually {{dominate}} other <b>bear</b> {{species in}} areas where they coexist. Due to their smaller size, American black <b>bears</b> are at a competitive disadvantage to brown <b>bears</b> in open, unforested areas. Although displacement of black <b>bears</b> by brown <b>bears</b> has been documented, actual interspecific killing of black <b>bears</b> by brown <b>bears</b> has only occasionally been reported. Confrontation is mostly avoided due to the black <b>bear's</b> diurnal habits and preference for heavily forested areas, {{as opposed to the}} brown <b>bear's</b> largely nocturnal habits and preference for open spaces. Where they do not live in close proximity to grizzly <b>bears,</b> and especially where found near human habitations, American black <b>bears</b> may become to a larger extent nocturnal. Brown <b>bears</b> may also kill Asian black <b>bears,</b> though the latter species probably largely avoids conflicts with the brown <b>bear</b> due to similar habits and habitat preferences to the American black species. Brown <b>bears</b> will eat the fruit dropped from trees by the Asian black <b>bear,</b> as they themselves are too large and cumbersome to climb. Improbably, in the Himalayas, brown <b>bears</b> are reportedly intimidated by Asian black <b>bears</b> in confrontations. However, the Himalayan black <b>bears</b> are reportedly more aggressive towards humans than the region's Himalayan brown <b>bear,</b> and the latter is one of the smaller races of brown <b>bear,</b> though still somewhat larger than the black <b>bear.</b> In Siberia, the opposite is true, and black <b>bears</b> are not known to attack people, but brown <b>bears</b> are. Both black <b>bears</b> seem to be most vulnerable to predatory attacks by brown <b>bears</b> when the latter species leaves hibernation sooner in early spring and ambushes the smaller ursids in their dens.|$|R
