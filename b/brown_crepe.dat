5000|$|Estate <b>brown</b> <b>crepe</b> (EBC) is {{made from}} [...] "cup lump" [...] (raw, {{naturally}} coagulated rubber from the collection cup) and other coagulum.|$|E
5000|$|The costume worn by Julie Andrews, in {{the number}} [...] "The Shady Dame from Seville" [...] {{is in fact the}} same costume worn by Robert Preston {{at the end of the}} film. It was made to fit Preston, and then, using a series of hooks and eyes at the back, it was drawn in tight to fit Andrews' shapely figure. Additional black silk ruffles were also added to the bottom of the garment, to hide the {{differences}} in height. The fabric is a black and <b>brown</b> <b>crepe,</b> with fine gold threads woven into it, that when lit appears to have an almost wet look about it.|$|E

40|$|Hat of gray velvet. The domed crown is {{made from}} six {{segments}} of gray velvet, sewn in bands extending from front to back. The brim, of matching felt, is set off-center to the crown, giving more brim in front than back. The front of the brim turns up somewhat, and has an embellishment of long dark brown feathers extending along the brim from a dark brown velvet bow set {{on the underside of}} the brim. The hat is lined in a bronze <b>brown</b> <b>crepe,</b> and has an inner hatband of brown grosgrain ribbon along the inside lower edge of the crown. A small contrasting stitch on the inner hatband indicates the front of the hat. Designer's/Retailer's label sewn to inner hatband: "Made to order hat / Bergdorf / Goodman / Fifth Ave at 58 th...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The direct {{near-infrared}} spectroscopic reflectance {{measurements of}} prevul-canized natural rubber (<b>brown</b> <b>crepe)</b> was employed for determination of its Mooney viscosity. NIR reflectance spectra {{were obtained for}} a total of 100 samples whose Mooney viscosity (VM in the range 68 – 95 units) have been determined by the standard reference procedure using a commercial computerized Mooney viscometer. These samples were employed as the raw material or were treated to achieve better homogenization. A Fourier transform near infrared (FT-NIR) spectrophotometer was employed, and the reflectance spectra were obtained with resolution of 4 cm 21 in the range 4000 – 10, 000 cm 21 as an average of 75 scans. The samples were split in a cali-bration set containing 70 samples and in an external validation set consisting of the remaining 30 samples. The calibration and validation spectra sets were treated to correct for baseline shift, further transformed by first derivative and finally modeled by partial least squares (PLS) employing four latent variables. The model was evaluated with the external sample test set, and a RMSEP of 3. 6 and 3. 9 units of Mooney viscosity were obtained for homogenized and nonhomogenized samples...|$|E
