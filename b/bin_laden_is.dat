5|$|A {{debate on}} whether the {{military}} photos {{should or should not}} be released to the public has taken place. Those supporting the release argued that the photos should be considered public records, that the photos are necessary to complete the journalistic record, and that the photos would prove bin Laden's death and therefore prevent conspiracy theories that <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> <b>is</b> still alive. Those in opposition to a release of the photos expressed concern that the photos would inflame anti-American sentiment in the Middle East.|$|E

No evidence, however, surfaced {{to prove that}} Saad was still alive, and it was later {{reported that}} Osama <b>bin</b> <b>Laden,</b> {{shortly before his death}} during a Navy Seals raid in 2011, was grooming his younger son Hamza <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> to <b>be</b> his heir apparent, a position that was originally bestowed to Saad. Letters retrieved from the compound where <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> <b>was</b> killed in Abbottabad, Pakistan confirmed that Saad was killed.|$|R

That evening, the President {{attended}} the annual White House Correspondent's Association dinner, which was hosted by comedian and television actor Seth Meyers. At one point, Meyers joked: [...] "People think <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> <b>is</b> hiding in the Hindu Kush, {{but did you know}} that every day from 4 to 5 he hosts a show on C-SPAN?" [...] Obama laughed, despite his knowledge of the operation to come.|$|E
500|$|Bin Laden, who orchestrated the attacks, {{initially}} denied {{but later}} admitted involvement. Al Jazeera broadcast {{a statement by}} bin Laden on September 16, 2001, stating, [...] "I stress that I have not carried out this act, which {{appears to have been}} carried out by individuals with their own motivation." [...] In November 2001, U.S. forces recovered a videotape from a destroyed house in Jalalabad, Afghanistan. In the video, <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> <b>is</b> seen talking to Khaled al-Harbi and admits foreknowledge of the attacks. On December 27, 2001, a second bin Laden video was released. In the video, he said: ...|$|E
500|$|In {{testimony}} before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, Attorney General Eric Holder said, [...] "The operation against bin Laden was justified {{as an act of}} national self-defense. It's lawful to target an enemy commander in the field." [...] He called the killing of bin Laden [...] "a tremendous step forward in attaining justice for the nearly 3,000 innocent Americans who were murdered on September 11, 2001." [...] Commenting on the legality under international law, University of Michigan Law Professor Steven Ratner said, [...] "A lot of it depends on whether you believe Osama <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> <b>is</b> a combatant in a war or a suspect in a mass murder." [...] In the latter case, [...] "you would only be able to kill a suspect if they represented an immediate threat".|$|E
5000|$|On August 7, 1998, <b>Bin</b> <b>Laden</b> struck again, {{this time}} with {{simultaneous}} bombings on the U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. (see above) The CIA, having confirmed <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> <b>was</b> behind the attack, informed Clinton that terrorist leaders were planning to meet at a camp near Khowst, to plan future attacks. According to Tenet, [...] "several hundred," [...] including <b>bin</b> <b>Laden,</b> would attend. On August 20, Clinton ordered cruise missile strikes on Al-Qaeda terrorist training camps in Afghanistan and a pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum, Sudan, where <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> <b>was</b> suspected of manufacturing biological weapons.

500|$|The final part {{addresses}} the actual rise of al-Qaeda. Curtis argues that, after their failed revolutions, bin Laden and Zawahiri {{had little or}} no popular support, let alone a serious complex organisation of terrorists, and were dependent on independent operatives to carry out their new call for jihad. However, the film argues that in order to prosecute bin Laden in absentia for the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings, U.S. prosecutors had to prove that he is the head of a criminal organisation responsible for the bombings. They find a former associate of bin Laden, Jamal al-Fadl, and pay him to testify that <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> <b>is</b> the head of a massive terrorist organisation called [...] "al-Qaeda". With the September 11 attacks, neoconservatives in the new Republican administration of George W. Bush use this invented concept of an organisation to justify another crusade against a new enemy, culminating in the launch of the War on Terror.|$|E

2500|$|After the 1998 U.S. embassy {{bombings in}} Africa, bin Laden and several al-Qaeda members were indicted in U.S. {{criminal}} court.

50|$|A study {{published}} in 2012 also found that conspiracy theorists frequently believe in multiple conspiracies, even when one conspiracy contradicts the other.

The President's National Security Advisor tasks the CIA with creating a plan to capture or kill bin Laden if he can be found. Two stealth helicopters from Area 51 are flown by the Army's 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment to enter Pakistan, insert members of DEVGRU and the CIA's SAD/SOG and raid {{the compound}}. Before briefing President Barack Obama, the CIA Director holds a meeting of his senior officers, who assess that bin Laden being there is a chance of 60â€“80%, rather than another high-value target.
