Claiborne said Clanton was supported by a window initially after he was shot, and fired some shots after sitting, with the pistol supported on his leg. After he ran out of ammunition, he called for more cartridges, but C. S. Fly took his pistol at about the time the general shooting ended.|$|E
5|$|The property's {{original}} {{area was}} 2acres (8,000 m²), {{but this was}} reduced by about half around 1830 when the Pennsylvania Canal (North Branch Division) was dug through the house's front yard, <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>and</b> river. On May 31, 1860, the Lackawanna and Bloomsburg Railroad opened with a train from Danville. This was the second railroad track in Northumberland, and ran behind the house. The canal closed in 1902 and was later filled in. The modern railroad line approximates the canal's course through the front yard; the track behind the house no longer exists.|$|E
5|$|The {{chambers}} {{appointed a}} conference committee to resolve differences <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>and</b> Senate {{versions of the}} bill. A major contention concerned the poll tax provisions; the Senate version allowed the Attorney General to sue states that used poll taxes to discriminate, while the House version outright banned all poll taxes. Initially, the committee members were stalemated. To help broker a compromise, Attorney General Katzenbach drafted legislative language explicitly asserting that poll taxes were unconstitutional and instructed the Department of Justice to sue the states that maintained poll taxes. To assuage concerns of liberal committee members that this provision was not strong enough, Katzenbach {{enlisted the help of}} Martin Luther King, Jr., who gave his support to the compromise. King's endorsement ended the stalemate, and on July 29, the conference committee reported its version out of committee. The House approved this conference report version of the bill on August 3 by a 328-74 vote (Democrats 217-54, Republicans 111-20), and the Senate passed it on August 4 by a 79-18 vote (Democrats 49-17, Republicans 30-1). On August 6, President Johnson signed the Act into law with King, Rosa Parks, John Lewis, and other civil rights leaders in attendance at the signing ceremony.|$|E

25|$|Important {{structural}} changes included the direct election of senators by popular election {{according to the}} Seventeenth Amendment , ratified in April 8, 1913, with positive effects (senators more sensitive to public opinion) and negative effects (undermining the authority of state governments). Supreme Court decisions based on the Constitution's commerce clause expanded congressional power to regulate the economy. One effect of popular election of senators was to reduce the difference <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>and</b> Senate {{in terms of their}} link to the electorate. Lame duck reforms according to the Twentieth Amendment ended the power of defeated and retiring members of Congress to wield influence despite their lack of accountability.|$|E
25|$|At {{the state}} level, {{the pattern of}} split ticket voting and divided {{government}} holds. Democrats currently hold one of the state's U.S. Senate seats, as well as {{four of the five}} statewide offices (Governor, Superintendent of Public Instruction, Secretary of State and State Auditor). The lone congressional district has been Republican since 1996 and in 2014 Steve Daines won one of the state's Senate seats for the GOP. The Legislative branch had split party control <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>and</b> senate most years between 2004 and 2010, when the mid-term elections returned both branches to Republican control. The state Senate is, as of 2015, controlled by the Republicans 29 to 21, and the State House of Representatives at 59 to 41. Historically, Republicans are strongest in the east, while Democrats are strongest in the west.|$|E
25|$|During 1962 Hayden came to {{national}} attention {{due to a}} dispute over procedural issues between the Senate Appropriations committee and House Appropriations Committee. Billed in the press as a feud between two octogenarian chairmen, Hayden and Representative Clarence Cannon, the dispute began {{over the issue of}} where conference committees to resolve appropriation issues would meet. The Constitution required that all appropriations bills must originate in the House while long-standing tradition of the time held that conference committee meetings occurred on the Senate side of the United States Capitol with a senator chairing the committee. The dispute began in January 1962 when members of the House appropriations committee passed a resolution calling for the meeting location of the conference committee to be evenly split <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>and</b> Senate side of the Capitol building. In response to this, the Senate appropriations committee passed a resolution calling for half of all appropriations bills to originate in the Senate. By April, Hayden had arranged for a meeting room located midway between the two chambers but House members refused to discuss the issue face-to-face until July, when US$55billion in unapproved appropriations bill threatened to force a government shutdown.|$|E

500|$|Davis {{was opposed}} to slavery and its {{extension}} into the territories, but he voted {{for most of the}} provisions of the Compromise of 1850, including the bill on Texas borders, shocking some anti-compromise Whigs. [...] He regularly voted in favor of the Wilmot Proviso, a measure to ban slavery from territories won in the Mexican war which was frequently attached to legislation in the late 1840s but was never adopted. [...] In one notable debate, Davis used procedural measures to delay vote on an amendment to remove it from a military appropriations bill, hoping to force a vote without time to conference on differences <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>and</b> Senate versions before Congress adjourned. [...] However, due to a difference in the clocks in the respective chambers, the House adjourned before he finished speaking, scuttling the bill. [...] Salmon P. Chase wrote of the episode, [...] "Ten political lives of ten John Davises, spent in the best direction, could not compensate for this half-hour's mischief", and Polk noted that if the loss of the bill delayed the end of the Mexican war, Davis would [...] "deserve the execrations of the country."

500|$|The latter {{years of}} Matheson's {{presidency}} were troubled by a chronic shortage of funds. In 1919–1920, facilities designed for 700 {{students had to}} serve 1,365 students, and the school received the same $100,000 appropriation (...) that it had received since 1915, made worse by inflation which nearly halved its value in that time. Matheson was able to acquire a $25,000 increase from the General Assembly that year. In 1920–1921, though, an increase of $125,000 (to $250,000) was passed but subsequently tabled due to differences <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>and</b> Senate {{version of the bill}} unrelated to Tech. To continue running the school, a frantic scramble for funds was undertaken, resulting in $40,000 from the General Education Board, $30,000 from a loan fund organized by the Georgia Rotary Club, and a grant from the Atlanta City Council. The University of Georgia, in a similar financial condition, was forced to cut its faculty's salary. After this drama, the situation still did not improve: in 1922–1923, only $112,500 of the requested $250,000 had been appropriated, leading Matheson to reluctantly start charging in-state students for tuition. The rates were $100 for in-state students (...) and $175 for out-of-state students (...) [...] Georgia Tech still needed a $125,000 line of credit against its first professional fund-raising effort, the [...] "Greater Georgia Tech Campaign".|$|E
