5|$|In 2002 {{producers}} asked Barlow {{to return}} as Mavis, {{but she was}} too busy. In 2006 Barlow claimed that she had again been asked to return to Coronation Street, but had refused as she felt the storylines were not good enough for Mavis. Barlow stated in 2007 that she is unlikely to return, <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be unable to cope with the accelerated production schedule of one more episode a week since her last appearance in 1997. Executive producer Kim Crowther said in 2009 that she would have liked Mavis to return to the serial.|$|E
5|$|The {{birth of}} her {{daughter}} in September 1857, however, began to reduce the level of her activism. Stone had made preliminary arrangements for the 1857 national convention {{to be held in}} Providence, but <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not be able to attend it, she handed responsibility to Susan B. Anthony and Thomas Wentworth Higginson. When the Panic of 1857 disrupted Anthony’s plan to move the convention to Chicago, Stone made the announcement that the next National Woman’s Rights Convention would be in May 1858. Anthony helped Stone arrange the 1858 convention and then took sole responsibility for the 1859 meeting. Elizabeth Cady Stanton took charge of the 1860 convention.|$|E
5|$|With {{the spiders}} distracted, Finn and Jake {{try to escape}} from the web, but to no avail. Ed later returns with a flaming sword, which he {{presents}} to Barb. However, she gets angry, arguing that he picked the gift because he liked, not <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> like it. Angered, Ed cuts the web, releasing Finn and Jake; he claims that Barb is dependent on him for food, as she cannot spin her own webs due to some unknown dysfunction. Barb attacks Ed, noting that she will have to eat him instead. Finn tries to help, but is pinned to a wall by Barb, who suddenly beings to moan as if in pain. Just then, an enormous egg sack emerges from her epigyne. The sack bursts, giving birth to thousands of tiny spiders, who proceed to bury Finn and Jake.|$|E
50|$|Rose, Jade's mother, was married, briefly, to Alan Scott. When she had {{children}} by Scott, {{she gave them}} up for adoption <b>because</b> <b>she</b> feared <b>she</b> <b>would</b> harm them. Jade and her twin were separated.|$|R
50|$|Sepulveda {{told the}} New York Post that, after earning her MBA, {{she decided to}} work in law enforcement, not finance, <b>because</b> <b>she</b> thought <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be more able {{to help people in}} law enforcement.|$|R

25|$|The {{overloading}} {{was also}} previously noted by an off-duty captain {{and the first}} mate. Lee Sang-yun also proposed overloading as a cause. According to the off-duty captain of Sewol, the ship owners ignored his warning that the ship should not carry so much cargo <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not be stable.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, Gabbard {{filed for}} reelection, but then volunteered for Army National Guard service in Iraq. Cabanilla, who filed {{to run against}} her, called on the {{incumbent}} to resign <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> {{not be able to}} represent her district from Iraq. Gabbard chose not to campaign for a second term, and Cabanilla won the Democratic primary, 64%–25%.|$|E
25|$|Many {{characters}} in Oz are animated objects. Such figures as the Glass Cat, the Scarecrow, Jack Pumpkinhead, the Sawhorse, {{and others are}} common. Entire regions are the homes of such animated beings. The Dainty China Country is entirely filled with creatures made of china, who would freeze into figurines if removed. The China princess lives in fear of breaking, <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> never be as pretty even if repaired.|$|E
50|$|Fenella Magleesh - Initially a scullery maid and {{assistant}} to Janet Magleesh, she {{is revealed in}} Act 3 to be Janet's daughter. She was crying in Act 1 for reasons unexplained. In Act 3, both Janet and Fenella reveal that she was upset over Jabez's decision to marry both the non-existent Victoria Cavendish and then Daphne Dixon <b>because</b> <b>she</b> hoped <b>she</b> <b>would</b> one day catch Jabez's attention.|$|R

25|$|During {{this time}} she prayed, made {{frequent}} offerings to the gods of ancient Egypt, and would often {{spend the night in}} the Great pyramid. Eady became the object of village gossip <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> make night prayers and offerings to Horus at the Great Sphinx. Yet she also was respected by the villagers for her honesty in not hiding her true faith in the Egyptian gods. She was sensitive to the religious observances of others, and would fast with the Muslim villagers during Ramadan and celebrate with Christians at Christmas.|$|E
25|$|Starting in 1866, the Guion Line was {{successful}} in the Liverpool-Queenstown-New York steerage trade. In 1875, Guion began commissioning express liners to compete for first class business, but its first two ships were total failures. William Pearce, the controlling partner of the John Elder shipyard, was convinced that a crack steamer that carried only passengers and light freight could be profitable <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> attract more passengers and spend less time in port. When Cunard rejected his proposal, Pearce offered his idea to the Guion line at a bargain price of £140,000 {{at a time when}} express liners typically cost £200,000. He also agreed to share the initial costs. Stephen Guion, managing director of the line, personally owned the new vessel.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the largest}} adult great whites ever {{exhibited}} was at Japan's Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium in 2016, where a [...] male was exhibited for three days before dying. Probably the most famous captive was a [...] female named Sandy, which in August 1980 became the only great white to be housed at the California Academy of Sciences' Steinhart Aquarium in San Francisco, California. She was released <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not eat and constantly bumped against the walls.|$|E
5000|$|While under DSP Media, in 2007 she {{was asked}} {{if she wanted to}} debut as a member of Kara. Jaekyung turned the offer down <b>because</b> <b>she</b> thought <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be happy with her Rainbow members. In 2007 Jaekyung was asked to join SM Entertainment, hinting at the {{possibility}} that she may have joined Girls' Generation. In 2008, she appeared in SS501's song [...] "A Song Calling For You" [...] music video before debuting as a Rainbow member.|$|R
5000|$|Cason {{says she}} and her sister [...] "finally {{abandoned}} work on the manuscript <b>because</b> <b>she</b> Josie <b>would</b> not clear up the Tombstone sequence where it pertained to her and Wyatt."

500|$|Before {{the release}} of Wave, Smith, now {{separated}} from long-time partner Allen Lanier, met Fred [...] "Sonic" [...] Smith, former guitar player for Detroit rock band MC5 and his own Sonic's Rendezvous Band, who adored poetry {{as much as she}} did. Waves [...] "Dancing Barefoot" [...] (inspired by Jeanne Hébuterne and her tragic love for Amedeo Modigliani) and [...] "Frederick" [...] were both dedicated to him. The running joke at the time was that she married Fred only <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not have to change her name. They had a son, Jackson (b. 1982) who would go on to marry The White Stripes drummer, Meg White in 2009; and a daughter, Jesse (b. 1987).|$|E
500|$|The Doctor makes {{contact with}} Rory; Mo's wife, Ambrose; and Ambrose's father, Tony, {{reminding}} {{them to keep}} their captive Silurian, Restac's sister Alaya, alive. They are unaware that Ambrose has already killed Alaya <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not help Tony, whom she had infected with Silurian venom. The Doctor arranges a [...] "conference" [...] between the Silurians (represented by Eldane) and the humans (represented by Amy and Nasreen); the three discuss how both species can co-exist {{on the surface of}} the Earth. Ambrose and Tony, worried about the Silurian reaction when they discover Alaya's death, set Nasreen and Tony's drill to burrow further and self-destruct fifteen minutes after they depart, which would destroy the Silurian oxygen supply and kill them all.|$|E
500|$|HMS Repulse was a [...] of the Royal Navy built {{during the}} First World War. Originally laid down as an {{improved}} {{version of the}} s, her construction was suspended on the outbreak of war <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not be ready in a timely manner. Admiral Lord Fisher, upon becoming First Sea Lord, gained approval to restart her construction as a battlecruiser that could be built and enter service quickly. The Director of Naval Construction (DNC), Eustace Tennyson-D'Eyncourt, quickly produced an entirely new design to meet Admiral Lord Fisher's requirements and the builders agreed to deliver the ships in 15 months. They did not quite meet that ambitious goal, but the ship was delivered {{a few months after}} the Battle of Jutland in 1916. Repulse, and her sister , were the world's fastest capital ships upon completion.|$|E

50|$|Hippomenes fell in {{love with}} Atalanta, the virgin huntress who {{strongly}} disliked the idea of getting married. After a warning from an oracle about getting married, she declared that whoever wanted to marry her was to beat her in a footrace (herself being a notoriously swift runner), and that those who should try and lose would be punished by instant death.Another version (followed by Hyginus) was that her father wanted her to be married, but she did not. She agreed to running races against her suitors <b>because</b> <b>she</b> thought <b>she</b> <b>would</b> never lose.|$|R

500|$|Persistent rumours linked Elizabeth Hurley to {{the role}} of Bellatrix Lestrange, {{although}} Warner Bros. asserted there was [...] "no truth whatsoever" [...] to reports that she had been cast. As early as August 2005, rumours began linking Helen McCrory {{to the role}}. On 2 February 2006 it was announced that McCrory had indeed been cast as Bellatrix. However, in April 2006 she revealed that she was three months pregnant and withdrew from the film <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> {{not have been able to}} perform the intense battle sequences in the Ministry of Magic in September and October 2006. The announcement that Bonham Carter had been recast in the role was made on 25 May 2006. McCrory was subsequently cast as Narcissa Malfoy from Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince onwards.|$|E
500|$|As each {{episode of}} Inside No. 9 {{features}} new characters, the writers {{were able to}} attract actors {{who might have been}} unwilling to commit to an entire series. Jane Horrocks, Nikki Amuka-Bird and Tony Way feature respectively as Liz, Joanne and Michael, other volunteers at the call centre. The characters of Liz and Joanne have strongly differing approaches to their roles as volunteers, with Joanne focussing on detachment and Liz on involvement. Both approaches, for Pemberton, have advantages and disadvantages. Jane's desk is adorned with various trinkets, including ornaments and pictures. These were Horrocks's idea, and, for Pemberton and Shearsmith, served to make viewers suspicious of her from the start. Horrocks was chosen <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be able to add humour while still keeping to the tight timings necessary for the episode; many of her lines were improvised. The character of Michael begins to work at the centre during the episode. Pemberton and Shearsmith considered having it mentioned that he had been sent by [...] "Pauline from Wood Green", a reference to the stage version of The League of Gentlemen Pauline, who had been based at Wood Green. However, this {{was not included in the}} final episode.|$|E
500|$|Cohan {{auditioned for}} Ruby, but {{ultimately}} received {{the part of}} Bela. Upon learning of Cohan's British accent, a [...] "really psyched" [...] Kripke reworked the character to be British. The actress herself later pictured Bela that way, feeling she [...] "has some kind of cool shading and sneakiness, which fits the British accent". At the time of Cohan's casting, however, she had been given little exposure to the character script-wise, and was unaware she would play a [...] "nasty person". It was not until The CW up-fronts that Kripke gave her a [...] "good spiel" [...] about Bela [...] <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be interviewed. The actress later turned down an offer from him to provide more of the character's backstory, and instead opted to learn it as the episodes were filmed. In order to prepare for her role, Cohan received training in weaponry to be [...] "well equipped with swords {{and a lot of}} instrumentssharp instruments", and in kickboxing alongside Ruby's actress Katie Cassidy. Cohan and Cassidy also decided to catch up on Supernatural before filming for the third season began, by watching the first two seasons together.|$|E

50|$|A couple died, {{leaving their}} three sons a porridge-pot, a griddle, and a cat.

They all set out to seek their fortune.|$|R
500|$|Meanwhile Canning's {{supporters}} were soliciting donations through the Case of Elizabeth Canning, an independently printed pamphlet designed to raise {{support for the}} prosecution of her captors. [...] In the Case of Wells was clearly identified as [...] "that Monster of a Woman", and in an edited version which appeared a week later in the Public Advertiser {{it was revealed that}} Canning had suffered a fit after being struck on the head. [...] Squires was called an [...] "old Gypsy Woman", who [...] "robbed the girl of her stays; and then in a miserable naked Condition, <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not become a common Prostitute, confined her in an old Back Room or loft". [...] Although Squires was often referred to as a gypsy this identification had, on occasion, been called into question. [...] Being named a gypsy could carry certain legal penalties and although these were rarely applied, gypsies were nevertheless treated as pariahs. [...] Moore (1994) described Squires as a [...] "dark, tall, but stooping, elderly woman, with an estimated age ranging from sixty to eighty, sometimes depicted as exceptionally hearty", continuing [...] "all accounts do agree that she was an exceptionally ugly woman, with a very large nose and a lower lip swollen and disfigured by scrofula." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{a stormy}} Cambridge night, Nina lets herself in to an office, {{where she is}} found by Professor Nigel Squires. He is holding a gun, {{but it is not}} loaded. Nina's boyfriend Simon is a fan of cryptic crosswords, but she is never able to help him. She has come to the office of Squires—a classicist who sets crosswords for Varsity as the Sphinx—to seek the answers to the next day's crossword. Squires sets about to teach Nina: [...] "I teach wild {{creature}} without hospital building" [...] results in ARCHITECTURE, which Simon studies. They turn to the clues for the next day, beginning to fill a large grid. Squires uses the name of the Sphinx <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> asphyxiate and consume those who failed to answer her riddle: she was [...] "devious and deadly". Squires makes tea, as Nina looks to his trophies. A picture of Squires with his late wife draws her attention, and they discuss the cut-throat world of competitive crosswording. Nina has answered DOWNANDOUT and WRAP; Squires answers DESI and helps with TRENT. Squires asks about Simon, but catches Nina in a lie; with her excuse being that she only wants to learn. Together, they deduce SWAMPLANDS, meaning [...] "bog". Nina, though, suggests that is should be bogs, otherwise Squires would be cheating. Suddenly spluttering, Squires takes a seat, as Nina begins on the next clue. She suddenly displays clear proficiency, answering ASPHYXIATION.|$|E
