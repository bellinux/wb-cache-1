We have studied the interaction between A beta and a <b>beta-cyclodextrin</b> dimer, consisting of two <b>beta-cyclodextrin</b> monomers connected by a flexible linker. The <b>beta-cyclodextrin</b> monomer has been found to interact with A beta(1 - 40) at sites Y 10, F 19, and/or F 20 with a dissociation constant (K-D) of 3. 9 +/- 2. 0 mM. Here H- 1 -N- 15 and H- 1 -C- 13 heteronuclear single-quantum correlation nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra show that in addition, the <b>beta-cyclodextrin</b> monomer and dimer bind to the histidines. NMR translational diffusion experiments reveal the increased affinity of the <b>beta-cyclodextrin</b> dimer (apparent K-D of 1. 1 +/-. 5 mM) for A beta(1 - 40) compared to that of the <b>beta-cyclodextrin</b> monomer.

We conclude that cyclodextrin monomers and dimers have specific, modulating effects on the A beta(1 - 40) aggregation process.

The addition of acetic acid to the reaction mixture was found to slow the cross-linking reaction, yielding homogeneous matrices. The mechanical characterization indicated that the elasticity of the matrices increased as the CD content in the hydrogel increased while the elongation was irrespective of the hydrogel composition. By incubation in water and ethanol, the hydrogels underwent complete swelling in 5 - 10 min. The water up-take increased logarithmically as the CD/PEG ratio decreased to reach a swelling degree of 800 % (swollen hydrogel/dry hydrogel, w/w%). The ethanol uptake increased with a power correlation as the CD/PEG ratio decreased to reach a swelling degree of about 1000 % with 0. 25 : 1 CD/PEG hydrogel.

The study by conventional steady state absorption and fluorescence spectroscopies and by time-resolved femto- and nanosecond laser flash spectroscopies suggests that in ethanol and pH 7 buffer the <b>beta-cyclodextrins</b> embed the highly hydrophobic tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl) -chlorin macrocycle and strongly interact with the chlorin rings in the singlet and triplet manifolds. In these solvents, femtosecond spectroscopy suggests that the conjugate undergoes a rapid relaxation in the upper excited singlet states induced by photochemical and/or conformation change(s) {{at a rate of}} about 5 ps(- 1) to fluorescent states whose lifetime is similar to 8 ns. This interaction is destroyed upon addition of Triton X 100 to buffer. Both FC and CDFC strongly fluoresce (Phi(F) similar to 0. 5) in micelles. Similar behavior is observed at the triplet level. In ethanol and water, the initial transient triplet state absorbance decays within 1 - 3 mu s yielding a longer lived triplet with spectral properties indistinguishable from that of original difference absorbance spectra. The determination of the molar absorbance in the 440 - 460 nm region (similar to 35 000 M(- 1) cm(- 1)) leads to an estimate of similar to 0. 2 for the triplet formation quantum yield of FC in toluene and of FC and CDFC in Triton X 100 micelles.
