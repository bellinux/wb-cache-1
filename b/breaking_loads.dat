As an alternative low-cost, rapid-fabrication geometry, multifilament Nicalon™ (with pyrolytic carbon-coating) tows were densified with the preceramic polymer (Blackglas™) technology to form single tow ceramic ”mini-composites”. Using modified ASTM tow testing methods, the Blackglas-Nicalon(C) mini-composites {{were tested in}} tension at ambient temperatures. The ceramic mini-composites had fibrous failure with linear load-deflection curves and mean <b>breaking</b> <b>loads</b> of 70 N. Gage length (1, 2. 5 & 5 cm) effects on <b>breaking</b> <b>loads</b> were minimal. The coefficient of variation (CoV) for the ceramic mini-composites was 19 % as compared to a 10 % CoV for earlier tensile tests on Blackglas-Nicalon 2 -D fabric composite bars. Results were compared to tensile tests of epoxy-Nicalon tows. Breaking strengths of the ceramic mini-composites were roughly 30 % of the breaking strengths of the epoxy-Nicalon composites.

To examine the {{advantages}} of cotton gill nets, we analyzed changes in mesh <b>breaking</b> <b>load</b> of a new cotton gill net used in a fishing operation. A new cotton gill net was also soaked in a seawater tank to simulate ghost fishing conditions. The average mesh <b>breaking</b> <b>load</b> of new cotton mesh was 50. 3 N. This value decreased to 19. 0 N after 38 days (∼ 912 h), and after 82 days (∼ 1968 h) the mesh could be easily torn (<b>breaking</b> <b>load</b> 0. 07 N). Under fishing conditions, the cumulative soak time was only 744. 4 h over 19 months.

The ratio of the two <b>break</b> <b>loads</b> (bent:straight) for identically processed samples was used as a proxy for measuring the ductility of the guide wires: the higher the ratio, the more ductile the sample. The average <b>break</b> <b>load</b> ratio as a function of increased cold work, decreased from 1. 27 to 0. 91 for the heat treated samples, and decreased from 1. 28 to 1. 13 for the non-heat treated samples.

The magnitude of the decrease in <b>break</b> <b>load</b> ratio between heat treated and non-heat treated wires is dependent on the level of cold work; there was a difference of 0. 01 for the lowest level of cold work, and a difference of 0. 22 for the highest level of cold work.

40|$|The {{effect of}} various {{inorganic}} and organic additives as possible nucleating agents on the crystallisation behaviour of P. E.

Various methods of mixing(: the polymer and additive were investigated and a method involving the screw-Extrusion of the polymer and the additive was ultimately adopted. Crystallisation {{studies were carried out}} using differential scanning calorimetry under dynamic and isothermal modes. The results produced under conditions of isothermal crystallisation were analysed by means of a computer. Despite differences between batches of polymer all the additives with the exception of indigo produced a nucleating effect in the polymer as indicated by an increase in the rate of crystallisation compared with that of the base polymer. Two organo-metallic substances (sodium benzoate and sodium stearate) proved to be the most effective in this respect by decreasing the degree of supercooling of the polymer by 20 [degrees]. Morphological studies were carried out on isothermally crystallised samples, after etching and replication using a transmission electron microscope. A nodular structure whose dimensions were sensitive to both the nucleating agent and the temperature of crystallisation was observed. Mechanical testing of samples direct from the D. S.

40|$|Characterization of {{material}} properties {{is necessary for}} design purposes {{and has been a}} topic of research for many years. Over the last several decades, much {{progress has been made in}} identifying metrics to describe fracture mechanics properties and developing procedures to measure the appropriate values. However, in the context of design, there has not been as much success in quantifying the susceptibility of a material to corrosion damage and its subsequent impact on material behavior in the framework of fracture mechanics. A natural next step in understanding the effects of corrosion damage was to develop a link between standard material test procedures and fatigue life in the presence of corrosion. Simply stated, the goal of this investigation was to formulate a cheaper and quicker method for assessing the consequences of corrosion on remaining fatigue life. ^ For this study, <b>breaking</b> <b>load</b> specimens and fatigue specimens of a single nominal gage (0. 063 ″) of aluminum alloy 2024 -T 3 were exposed to three levels of corrosion. The <b>breaking</b> <b>load</b> specimens were taken from three different material lots, and the fatigue tests were carried out at three stress levels. All failed specimens, both <b>breaking</b> <b>load</b> and fatigue specimens, were examined to characterize the damage state(s) and failure mechanism(s). Correlations between <b>breaking</b> <b>load</b> results and fatigue life results in the presence of corrosion damage were developed using a fracture mechanics foundation and the observed mechanisms of failure. Where <b>breaking</b> <b>load</b> tests showed a decrease in strength due to increased corrosion exposure, the corresponding set of fatigue tests showed a decrease in life. And where <b>breaking</b> <b>load</b> tests from different specimen orientations exhibited similar levels of strength, the corresponding set of fatigue specimens showed similar lives. The spread from shortest to longest fatigue lives among the different corrosion conditions decreased at the higher stress levels. Life predictions based on <b>breaking</b> <b>load</b> data were generally shorter than the experimental lives by an average of 20 %. The life prediction methodology developed from this investigation is a very valuable tool for the purpose of assessing material substitution for aircraft designers, alloy differentiation for manufacturers, or inspection intervals and aircraft retirement schedules for aircraft in service. ...|$|R

Microscopic examination revealed that two brands were core spun and seven were tow spun type threads. Data resulting from the standard testing procedures were tested statistically by analysis of variance or the Student's "t" test. Associations were determined by Pearson's correlation coefficient. Differences occurred among and within both the brands {{and the types of}} thread. Single strand <b>breaking</b> <b>load</b> varied significantly only among the tow spun black threads. The loop breaking strength of the tow spun threads was greater than that of the core spun threads. The core spun black threads were stronger than the core spun white threads in loop breaking strength. The core spun threads had the higher single strand breaking elongation. A significant variation in single strand elongation occurred among the white threads and the black threads of both the tow spun and core spun threads. Variation in loop breaking elongation existed among the brands. Variation in loop breaking elongation also occurred among the white tow spun threads and between the black core spun threads.

Friction stir welding (FSW) is a new welding technique particularly well suited to aluminum alloys though this technique is also used for other materials. Friction stir welding promises joints with low porosity, fine microstructures, minimum phase transformation and low oxidation compared to conventional welding techniques.

The {{effect of the}} final thermal treatment temperature (663 – 963 ◦C) and temperature programme (temperature of isothermal step and heating rate) on yield, elemental composition, porosity development and mechanical strength of the resulting ACC were examined. Nitrogen isotherms at − 196 ◦C, carbon dioxide isotherms at 0 ◦C, <b>breaking</b> <b>loads</b> and Youngs modulus values were determined for all the samples.

The mechanical properties depend on the metabolic phase of the graft material—degeneration, revascularization, fibroplasia, and maturation of the collagen. During maturization vascularity and cellularity decrease and nuclei are arranged longitudinally. In this way the allograft serves as a scaffold for collagen formation, while it is fully substituted by vital collagen.

Numerous pioneering works have already been carried out showing their efficiency, especially for bio-medical applications. Nevertheless, this technology remains confined to academic studies at the laboratory scale because chalcogenide glass fibers are difficult to shape to produce reliable, sensitive and compact sensors. In this paper, a new method for designing and fabricating a compact and robust sensing head with a selenide glass fiber is described. Compact looped sensing heads with diameter equal to 2 mm were thus shaped. This represents an outstanding achievement considering the brittleness of such uncoated fibers. FEWS experiments were implemented using alcoholic solutions as target samples showing that the sensitivity is higher than with the routinely used classical fiber. It is also shown that the best compromise in term of sensitivity is to fabricate a sensing head including two full loops.

40|$|Aim: To {{investigate}} {{in vitro}} the fracture resistance {{of two different}} post systems, a conventional one with post space preparation using a drill and an alternative one adapted to the canal shape. Methodology: After sample size calculation, the crowns of 26 single-rooted freshly-extracted teeth were removed with a disc 1 mm coronal to the cemento-enamel junction. The canals were shaped with Mtwo rotary files up to size 40, 0. 06 tpaer and filled with the continuous wave of condensation technique leaving the coronal 9 mm of the canal unfilled. After the post space preparation by a dedicated drill, double-tapered fibre posts (DT Light-Post) were cemented in half of the roots (G 1, n = 13). 0. 06 tapered fibre posts (Tech S Endoshape) were trimmed to fit the canal of the remaining roots (G 2, n = 13) and then cemented without post space preparation. A self- adhesive cement (RelyX Unicem) was used in both groups. The posts were cut 5 mm from the root coronal surface. The specimens were embedded in acrylic resin {{and the top of}} the post was loaded under continuous compressive force (45 °, 0. 75 mm/min) to measure the maximum breaking load (N). Data were statistically analyzed by using a Student’s t-test (α = 0. 05). Results: The mean maximum <b>breaking</b> <b>loads</b> ±SD were G 1 = 164. 07 ± 21. 54 and G 2 = 151. 22 ± 14. 69.

The {{aim of this}} study was to compare the fracture resistance and failure modes of endodontically treated maxillary premolars treated with or without a fiber post and restored with different types of crowns. Eighty human maxillary premolars were selected. After root canal treatment, the teeth were embedded in resin blocks and divided into four groups. Samples received MOD cavity preparations and were divided into two subgroups: with and without fiber posts and restored using porcelain fused to metal, lithium disilicate, fiber-reinforced composite, or zirconia crowns. The specimens were vertically loaded in the central fossa using a universal loading machine until failure, and the maximum <b>breaking</b> <b>loads</b> were recorded. Samples were perfused with Indian ink to highlight the fracture lines and the mode of failure that was classified as restorable or nonrestorable. Even without post, all crown designs resisted vertically applied forces beyond those that may be encountered in the mouth. Two-way analysis of variance revealed the use of a fiber post (p = 0. 007) and the type of crown (p < 0. 001) significantly affected the restorability of fractured teeth. The relationship between placing or not placing the post and the type of failure (restorable/nonrestorable) was found to be significant (chi(2) test, p = 0. 002). Although post placement resulted in higher fracture resistance values, these were significant for Empress II crowns only. The results suggest that the posts could contribute to the reinforcement and strengthening of pulpless maxillary premolars. With respect to failure modes, placement of fiber posts improved the fracture from nonrestorable to restorable patterns. This study suggests that the placement of fiber posts is necessary to improve fracture resistance even under full-coverage crowns...|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} investigation, {{experimental}} and numerical studies {{were carried out}} to determine the axial impact splitting loads and the splitting process of naturally bedded layered slate rocks. This effort was undertaken to examine an alternate slate mining procedure so that the wastage in slate can be reduced from the present-day 95 %. This was the first effort made in the use of this procedure for slate excavation. [...] Experimental impact forces were determined by carrying out splitting tests on different sizes of slate blocks from small to intermediate scales, using a hydraulic actuator with a wedge-shaped indenter in the laboratory. Generally the slate blocks split parallel to their natural bedding planes, exhibiting clean and even split faces. Thus the use of this procedure for slate mining will minimize the damage produced by the use of optimum explosives; this reduction in wastage has been approximately estimated to be nearly 20 % to 25 % less than the present-day 95 %. It has been observed in some cases that <b>breaking</b> <b>loads</b> were not consistent with the sizes of blocks (probably due to the presence of preexisting flaws within the block). Some of the larger blocks needed lesser loads to break than those found for relatively smaller blocks. [...] Numerical analyses were carried out to predict the impact splitting loads required to split a finite sized layered slate rock based on the observed mechanism of plane crack propagation in plane strain and three-dimensional slate blocks, obtained from impact splitting of slate blocks in the laboratory. In order to characterize the material for numerical analysis, properties of the slate material, such as elastic moduli, Poisson's ratio, compressive and tensile strengths, coefficient of friction (between slate and steel), plane strain fracture toughness, hardness, crack propagation velocity etc., were determined after carrying out extensive experimental investigations. The experimental values obtained in this study were generally within the ranges specified for slates of other origins. It must also be mentioned here that the results presented in this thesis on the physical and mechanical properties of slate are the first study carried out on slates of Newfoundland origin. [...] ABAQUS finite element software was used to simulate the entire wedge impact splitting process during numerical analysis. Mode I (plane strain opening mode) dynamic crack propagation was simulated numerically by the sequential releasing of the restraining node on the symmetric plane of the analyzed specimen. Mode I stress intensity factors (KI) were determined for different crack lengths and two types of crack propagation velocities. It was found that the crack propagation velocities had little (less than 10 %) or almost no effect on the variation of the mode I stress intensity factors (SIPs). The possibility of crack propagation was determined by comparing KI with the plane strain fracture toughness (KIC). For a chosen slate block, the mode I stress intensity factor was obtained to be almost the same as its fracture toughness, when the experimental impact splitting load was applied on it. Also in a three-dimensional splitting scenario, a parabolic crack front was required to model an equal fracture toughness (or stress intensity factor) value all along the crack front. [...] Numerical results on the effect of size of the specimen (width and depth) on the mode I stress intensity factor were also examined and a correlation equation was established between the mode I stress intensity factor, splitting force and plane strain geometry of the slate block. <b>Breaking</b> <b>loads</b> calculated using the correlation equation for plane strain fracture toughness were compared with those obtained from experimental work. The differences between the numerical and experimental impact forces were found to vary between + 0. 78 to - 32. 34 %. A field problem, considering the separation of a large sized slate slab from its intact state, was also analyzed numerically. The breaking load obtained from this study was compared with those obtained from the developed correlation equation. A good agreement (difference was less than 15 %) was obtained between them. A discussion is also given concerning the possible reduction of wastage by the use of this process as a slate mining procedure...|$|E
