500|$|Northrup {{went to a}} {{psychiatrist}} to obtain advice about Hubbard's increasingly violent and irrational behaviour, {{and was told that}} he probably needed to be institutionalized and that she was in serious danger. She gave Hubbard an ultimatum: get treatment or she would leave with the baby. He was furious and threatened to kill Alexis rather than let Northrup care for her: [...] "He didn't want her to be brought up by me <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> league with the doctors. He thought I had thrown in with the psychiatrists, with the devils." [...] She left Palm Springs on February 3, leaving Hubbard to complain that Northrup [...] "had hypnotized him in his sleep and commanded him not to write." ...|$|E
500|$|In April, Diplo told The Huffington Post that he {{had reached}} an {{agreement}} to clear the samples. However, in an August interview with Pitchfork, Baauer {{said that he has}} not made any money from the song, despite Diplo's reported agreement: [...] "I'm meeting with my lawyer ... so I'm gonna find that out. I think it's mostly because of all the legal shit. I didn’t clear the samples <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> my fucking bedroom on Grand Street. I wasn't going to think to call up , I didn’t even know who it was who did that I knew the Jayson Musson [...] So I found myself in that fucking pickle. Legal letters and shit. Ugh. Lawyers. So exposure-wise it was fantastic, but everything else..." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon {{returning}} to Brisbane {{after the first}} round of trials, Tonelli tore rib cartilage while participating in judo at high school. The pain of the injury restricted him to swimming backstroke for four months, and his times steadily improved during this period under the guidance of John Rigby at the Valley Pool. At the final selection event, he came second in both the 100m and 200m backstroke behind Olympic gold medallist Brad Cooper to earn his international debut. At the World Championships in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, he came sixth in the 200m backstroke behind East Germany's Roland Matthes, who set a world record. Tonelli self-deprecatingly noted that [...] "I didn't get to see him [...] swim in the final, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> the same race five sets of speedos behind".|$|E

500|$|On {{his first}} day of filming, in July 2006, Thompson—who grew up {{watching}} Coronation Street—was starstruck. [...] " [...] was the strangest {{day of my life}} <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> a room with all these famous people." [...] He added: [...] "It was completely different to how I imagined it would be. Everyone's been really nice to me and it's going well." [...] Prior to the airing of the Connor family's arrival on the famous cobblestone street in August 2006, Thompson commented, [...] "I can't say too much about Ryan and the story lines, but he's very mischievous. The character is not a bad lad, but he's not a good lad either." [...] Garth Philips, series producer, said at the time, [...] "We held extensive casting sessions to get this family right, and the energy that Sean, Rob, Kym and Ben have will certainly make them a joy to watch on screen." [...] He continued, [...] "They're a twenty-first century Coronation Street family, and we hope our viewers will be as enthralled and excited by them as we are." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{first half}} of Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt was {{recorded}} shortly {{after the completion of}} Blood Sugar Sex Magik; the second half between late 1991 and early 1992, during the album's tour. [...] "Running Away Into You" [...] is the only track recorded after he left the Chili Peppers. The album is a heavily experimental avant-garde composition whose initial purpose was spiritual and emotional expression: [...] "I wrote [...] <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> a really big place in my head—it was a huge, spiritual place telling me what to do. As long as I'm obeying those forces, it's always going to be meaningful. I could be playing guitar and I could say 'Play something that sucks,' and if I'm in that place, it's gonna be great. And {{it has nothing to do}} with me, except in ways that can't be understood." [...] Frusciante further asserted that the album was meant to be experienced as a cohesive unit rather than separate entities or songs. Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt was released on Rick Rubin's label American Recordings. Warner Bros., the Chili Peppers' label, owned rights to the album because of the leaving-artist clause in Frusciante's Chili Peppers contract. However, because he was reclusive, the label gladly handed the rights over to Rubin, who released the album at the urging of Frusciante's friends.|$|E
500|$|In June 2014, the IMAX Corporation {{announced}} that the IMAX release of the film would be converted to IMAX 3D. Following the completion of principal photography several more cast members were revealed including Stellan Skarsgård, Anthony Mackie, Idris Elba, and Tom Hiddleston, reprising their roles from previous MCU films. However, Hiddleston's scenes {{did not make the}} theatrical cut of the film, with Whedon saying what was shot [...] "didn't play" [...] and he did not want the film to feel [...] "overstuffed". According to Hiddleston, [...] "In test screenings, audiences had overemphasized Loki's role, so they thought that <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> it, I was controlling Ultron, and it was actually imbalancing people's expectations." [...] Whedon later explained that Elba and Atwell appear in the film because of exploring the psyches of the Avengers from Scarlet Witch's power. In December 2014, Kim's role was revealed as Dr. Helen Cho. Additional scenes were scheduled to be filmed in January 2015 at Pinewood Studios. In February 2015, Marvel confirmed through promotional material that Serkis portrays Ulysses Klaue in the film. In early April 2015, Linda Cardellini and Julie Delpy were confirmed {{to be part of the}} film's cast. At the same time, Whedon stated that the film would not contain a post-credits scene, which had become customary for MCU films. Whedon tried to come up with a post-credit scene but felt that he could not top the [...] "Shawarma scene" [...] in The Avengers, explaining, [...] "It didn't seem to lend itself in the same way, and we wanted to be true to what felt right. The first rule of making a sequel is take the best moments and do something else. Don't do the Indiana Jones gun trick again differently. Just go somewhere else. Don't try to hit the same highs, because people will sense it." [...] However, Feige clarified, [...] "There will be a tag [...] But there's not a post––credit scene." ...|$|E

[...] In September 2014, Maradona met with Pope Francis in Rome, crediting Francis for inspiring him to return to religion after many years; he stated, [...] "We should all imitate Pope Francis.
