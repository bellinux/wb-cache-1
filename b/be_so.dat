5|$|Along {{with his}} bandmates Lee and Lifeson, Peart was made an Officer of the Order of Canada on May 9, 1996. The trio {{was the first}} rock band to <b>be</b> <b>so</b> honoured, as a group.

5|$|Celtic law made {{specific}} provision {{with regard to}} cabbages and leeks, stating {{that they should be}} enclosed by fences for protection against wandering cattle. The two green vegetables were the only ones mentioned specifically in the laws, though uncultivated plants were still likely to be used in their cooking. The leek went on to <b>be</b> <b>so</b> important to Welsh cuisine—found in many symbolic dishes including cawl and Glamorgan sausage—that it became the country's national vegetable.|$|E

5|$|Cold {{seawater}} {{is used in}} the Seawater Greenhouse to both {{cool and}} humidify the interior of greenhouse-like structure.

5|$|For an implant to osseointegrate, {{it needs}} to be {{surrounded}} by a healthy quantity of bone. In order for it to survive long-term, {{it needs to}} have a thick healthy soft tissue (gingiva) envelope around it. It is common for either the bone or soft tissue to <b>be</b> <b>so</b> deficient that the surgeon needs to reconstruct it either before or during implant placement.|$|E
5|$|George's {{distrust}} of the Tories aided the passing of power to the Whigs. Whig dominance would grow to <b>be</b> <b>so</b> great under George that the Tories would not return to power for another half-century. After the election, the Whig-dominated Parliament passed the Septennial Act 1715, which extended the maximum duration of Parliament to seven years (although it could be dissolved earlier by the Sovereign). Thus Whigs already in power could remain in such a position for a greater period of time.|$|E

5|$|In 1933, the Mint gained {{its first}} female Director, Nellie Tayloe Ross, and despite initial mistrust {{between her and}} O'Reilly, they came to forge a strong bond. Although {{scheduled}} for mandatory retirement in 1935, O'Reilly was considered to <b>be</b> <b>so</b> indispensable to the bureau's operations that U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt postponed this until 1938. During her later years, O'Reilly remained in Washington D.C.; she no longer involved herself in Mint affairs, instead devoting much of her attention to Catholic charitable work.|$|E

5|$|In January 1980, in {{response}} to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, President Carter postponed consideration of the SALT-2 Treaty and imposed a trade embargo.

5|$|In United States v. Hamilton (1883), the Court reaffirmed {{its earlier}} {{holdings}} that certificates could not issue from motions to quash an indictment. And, in United States v.

5|$|In dry tall grasslands in monsoonal areas, {{the change}} in {{vegetation}} may <b>be</b> <b>so</b> great due to either fires or wet season growth that birds may be more nomadic and change territories more than other fairywrens. They form more stable territories elsewhere, such as in coastal areas. Cooperative breeding is less common with this species than with other fairywrens; helper birds have been sporadically reported, but the red-backed fairywren has been little studied.|$|E
