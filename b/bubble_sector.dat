Despite charges of poor treatment of clients, exaggeration of {{the impact on the}} poorest as well as the risks of credit <b>bubbles,</b> the <b>sector</b> can play a non-negligible role in reaching financial services to low-income households. In regulating the sector, there is need for caution in setting interest rate ceilings on micro-loans and for greater openness to micro-savings products...|$|R
40|$|This study {{tests for}} the {{presence}} of periodically, partially collapsing speculative <b>bubbles</b> in the <b>sector</b> indices of the S&P 500 using a regime-switching approach. We also employ an augmented model that includes trading volume as a technical indicator to improve the ability of the model to time bubble collapses and to better capture the temporal variations in returns. We find that over 70 % of the S&P 500 index by market capitalization, and seven of its ten sector component indices exhibited bubble-like behaviour over our sample period. Thus the speculative bubble that grew in the 1990 ’s and subsequently collapsed was pervasive in the US equity market. The <b>bubble</b> affected numerous <b>sectors</b> including energy and industrials, rather than being confined to information technology, telecommunications and the media. Stock market bubbles, fundamental values, dividends, regime switching, speculative bubble test. ...|$|R
50|$|Given {{that the}} FTZ amalgamated two {{existing}} bonded zones—Waigaoqiao and Yangshan—a {{large percentage of}} its total area is given over to industrial use. Moreover, commercial space was quickly snatched up by speculators betting on the future desirability of the zone's preferential policies. This drove up office rents in the FTZ and has created a <b>bubble</b> in the <b>sector.</b> In response, the Municipal Government implemented measures to rezone industrial districts for commercial and R&D usage. Notably, enterprises are permitted to register virtual offices in the FTZ, through which they can still enjoy the zone's distinctive regulations.|$|R
40|$|Stock price bubbles {{are often}} on {{productive}} assets and {{occur in a}} sector of the economy. In addition, their occurence is often accompanied by credit booms. Incorporating these features, we provide a two-sector endogenous growth model with credit-driven stock price bubbles. Bubbles have a credit easing e¤ect in that they relax collateral constraints and improve investment e ¢ ciency. Sectoral bubbles also have a capital reallocation e¤ect {{in the sense that}} <b>bubbles</b> in a <b>sector</b> attract more capital to be reallocated to that sector. Their impact on economic growth depends on the interplay between these two e¤ects. Bubbles may misallocate resources across sectors and reduce welfare...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the {{performance}} of the United States (US) on the Global Entrepreneurship and Development Index (GEDI), capturing the contextual features of entrepreneurship. The US ranks third on the GEDI. It performs well on the aspirations sub-index but lags on the attitudes and activity sub-indices. Its performance is strong in areas of startu skills, competition, and new technology but weak in cultural support, tech sector, and high-growth business. Performance is stronger on institutional variables than on individual variables. Apparent weakness in the tech sector, lack of cultural support for entrepreneurship and lack of high-growth business can be due to the changing political environment and international volatility, 1990 s tech <b>sector</b> <b>bubble</b> burst, the recent recession, and the improving performance of other counties.

40|$|Higher {{education}} is often {{considered as one}} of the safest and most profitable investments in human capital. There are, however, signals that this sector has been experiencing unsustainable economic boom in the United States. This study examines the ability of Austrian Business Cycle Theory to explain the possibility of such boom, i. e. to explain the potential systematic errors in the allocation of human capital. We find that respective allocation is driven by the similar market forces as the allocation of physical capital and hence, that it may fall victim to the same, or similar false market signals, thus creating the cycle of boom and bust. Credit expansion in the sector of student loans can be the trigger then. Furthermore, we study the actual development in this sector and find that empirical evidence provides many reasons to believe that there has actually been unsustainable boom i. e. an economic <b>bubble</b> in the <b>sector</b> of post-secondary education in the United States...|$|R

Curs acadèmic 2015 - 2016 The Descriptive evidence, {{classify}} the firms: in {{firms with}} Leverage over the average, firms with Leverage down the average and firms with Leverage between {{the mean and}} median (the most efficient group). This part also classify the firms in important economic sectors: Construction (economic sector with overinvestment), Manufacturing, Retail Trade, Transportation & Public Utilities and Services. The Econometric results, conclude that the Leverage and the Operating Profit have an inverse correlation. Moreover in the relation between Leverage and Turnover the Econometric results found that in the economic expansion period, {{an increase in the}} Leverage can help firms to increase their Turnover, but in the economic crisis period Leverage and Turnover don't have correlation. The Ideas, suggests ideas as leverage strategies to invest, a reference Leverage Ratio, index for price <b>bubbles</b> in economic <b>sectors</b> and the idea that the high aggregate leverage can predict a high GDP volatility in subsequent years...|$|R
3000|$|It {{is often}} {{argued that this}} {{demographic}} of workers tends to be concentrated in industries that are {{more sensitive to the}} business cycle. Labour market fluctuations by industry certainly {{played an important role in}} explaining the distribution of job loss in Ireland (e.g. McGinnity et al. 2014). The recession in Ireland coincided with the end of a property <b>bubble.</b> The construction <b>sector,</b> which employed about 20  % of male workers in the first quarter of 2008, had lost 62  % of its employment positions by the third quarter of 2012, according to QNHS data. Although the decline in jobs associated with specific industries may account for a large part of the gender differences in job loss, the trend was not systematic across industries. 1 In some industries—such as the professional, scientific and technical activities or the financial, insurance and real estate activities—the rate of job loss has been higher for women than for men, on average. Also, in the wholesale and retail trade sector, which employed about 15  % of all people at work in the first quarter of 2008, divided almost equally between men and women, the timing of job loss varied significantly by gender. 2 [...]...|$|R
40|$|This article {{addresses}} the materialist theory {{of development and}} fall of Marxism based on the theory of value as originally considered and presented by Karl Marx in Grundrisse and in Crítica da Economia Política, claiming that the production of value depends on labor force. As it takes place today, capital displaces labor force in every industry, service and activity, country, territory and region all over the world; workers are dismissed and are transferred to speculative activities of the fictional capital. This lesser disposition of labor force eventually harms the mean profit rate and, as time goes by, it provokes a crisis. The present capitalist crisis is resultant from the insufficiency and, to certain extent, to the incapacity of mechanisms from the system to generate enough value production in the labor process, to provide value to the invested capital (in settings of production, raw matter, and in labor force or variable capital); to create more value and to regain increased profit rate. These restraints of the financial capital (fictional capital) cause a deviation to the speculative plan and contribute {{for the formation of}} tragic speculative <b>bubbles</b> in <b>sectors</b> such as those of housing, energy and food. No matter how much productivity is increased, developing a technological revolution and “sparing labor force”, the reduction of time, socially required for the production of goods and labor force, becomes harder and more marginal. This is the way the capitalist system enters a civilian, structural and organic crisis, as it is now. To go beyond the capital means to construct structures and superstructures of a new non-capitalist society based on a new way to produce, to work and to keep harmonious and friendly human social relations. It is difficult to have a successful revolution if not with the education of its agents, that is, the organized front people, parties and syndicates that will raise the social, political and cultural awareness. For that purpose, a brief analysis of the system crisis core is required. ...|$|R
40|$|Evidence {{regarding}} {{the validity of}} the present value model for stock prices has typically been assessed at index level. Moreover, such research typically rejects the model. In contrast research at the firm level is more supportive of the model. This paper, using the present value model as the base for analysis, considers sector level data. Three main objectives motivate the paper. First, to fill the gap in the research noted above. Second, to see if the recent technology bubble affected all other sectors. Third, to examine returns predictability using the present value model adjusted for the presence of bubbles. The results suggest, first, only limited support for the simple present value model, supporting the notion that as data are aggregated then the information content of dividends becomes obscured. Second, that the late 1990 s <b>bubble</b> affected all <b>sectors</b> {{with the exception of the}} more traditional industrial sectors, which have seen significant price rises following the end of the early 2000 s bear market. Third, a regime switching model that incorporates both a fundamental and bubble component demonstrates that when the bubble component is small the dividend yield acts as a reasonable predictor of sector returns, however, when the bubble is large prices become disconnected from dividends. The results here inform our knowledge of the present value model and should be of interest both to researchers attempting to model market behaviour and investors attempting to forecast it.
