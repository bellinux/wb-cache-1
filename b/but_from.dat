5|$|Between 1925 and 1928, Ny-Ålesund saw four air {{expeditions to}} the North Pole, {{two of which}} {{required}} {{the construction of an}} airship hangar and mast. The first proposal for an airport in Ny-Ålesund was launched in 1956 by Norsk Polar Navigasjon, who proposed an airport at Kvadehuksletta. Soviet protests against the airport caused the Norwegian authorities to oppose the plans, which were laid to rest in the early 1960s. Construction at Hamnerabben started in 1965 following the decision to build Kongsfjord Telemetry Station.
