50|$|Lying {{just beyond}} the {{southern}} borders of Geevagh lies a much larger lake: Lough Arrow. To the east lies the border with County Roscommon and to the north beyond Carran Hill lies County Leitrim. To the west lies the village of Riverstown and most of County Sligo. The underlying rock structure {{is a combination of}} limestone, shale and sandstone, many examples of which {{can be seen in the}} local stone walls. A blanket bog covers the top of Carran Hill and boggy land with poor quality soil is a feature of the local farms, the shallow soil being fertile enough to support only low density mixed farming of cattle and sheep. As a consequence of this, many local farmers supplement their meager income from farming with wages from jobs in the local big town of Sligo. One of the few local industries that supplied work to generations of men from the locality was the Arigna coal mines, located near the community of Glenkillamey to the north of Geevagh. This mine was in operation in one form or another since the 18th century and provided a low grade coal to a small power station operated by the ESB (Electricity Supply Board) since 1958. However the mine closed for the last time in 1990 hitting the local communities hard, particularly in the Arigna/Glenkillamey area. In keeping with its past involvement in power generation, 2005 saw the installation of six wind turbines at Carrownadargny. These electricity generating turbines - owned by Orliven Ltd - are each capable of producing 0.85MW of power, and are manufactured by the Spanish company Gamesa. The towers on which the turbines stand are 44 metres high, with a combined <b>blade</b> <b>diameter</b> of 52 metres.

40|$|The {{understanding}} of wave-current interaction is of increasing {{interest in the}} field of coastal and offshore engineering. An area where wave-current interaction is likely to be an important factor is in the development of Marine Current Energy Converters (MCECs). Little has been done to investigate the behaviour of MCECs in unsteady flow caused by wave motion and close proximity of the device to the structure. The additional forces applied to the blades through the action of the waves could very well dictate the structural design of blades as well as the proximity to the water surface. The forces applied to the blades from waves will not be perpendicular to the blades as with marine currents. The forces will be composed of a more complex circular motion. This repeating oscillation will place additional strain on blades, but if the magnitude of this can be quantified it may permit optimised MCEC devices to be placed nearer to the sea surface allowing manufactures to use larger <b>blade</b> <b>diameters</b> to maximise energy extractio...|$|R
40|$|To meet growing energy demands {{wind energy}} {{has become an}} {{important}} source of energy. In the last decade wind turbines have been installed offshore to accommodate even more wind power. The offshore wind resource is of a better quality, resulting in higher electricity output. On the other hand, the costs of constructing and installing support structures for these turbines offshore is higher than onshore. Therefore offshore turbines are being made larger to economize in the support structure and installation costs. As the technology for wind turbines improves, the industry has developed wind turbines with rotor diameters as large as 150 m and power ratings of 8. 0 MW. It is the intention to build wind farms in water depths of even 60 meters. The combination of increasing water depths, increasing wind tower heights and rotor <b>blade</b> <b>diameters</b> creates loads that complicate the foundation design.

40|$|Offshore Wind {{power is}} {{considered}} one of the fastest growing maritime sectors and the most promising sources of ‘clean’ energy towards meeting the European targets for 2020 and 2050. The growth of the sector has also been mirrored in other continents like China and US.

The combination of increasing wind tower heights, rotor <b>blade</b> <b>diameters</b> and water depths, needed for the multi-megawatt wind turbines, makes the need for complex jacket support structures inevitable. As the design of jacket support structures is fatigue driven, the challenge is to balance fatigue performance, structural weight and the operating and maintenance (O&M) strategies in order to reduce the Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) and the Operating Expenditure (OPEX). The current industry-wide accepted methods of fatigue life prediction, according to offshore wind design standards and guidelines, have certain known conservatism.

40|$|Abstract—The {{value of}} overall oxygen {{transfer}} Coefficient (KLa), {{which is the}} best measure of oxygen transfer in water through aeration, is obtained by a simple approach, which sufficiently explains the utility of the method to eliminate the discrepancies due to inaccurate assumption of saturation dissolved oxygen concentration. The rate of oxygen transfer depends on number of factors like intensity of turbulence, which in turns depends on the speed of rotation, size, and number of <b>blades,</b> <b>diameter</b> and immersion depth of the rotor, and size and shape of aeration tank, as well as on physical, chemical, and biological characteristic of water. An attempt is made in this paper to correlate the overall oxygen transfer Coefficient (KLa), as an independent parameter with other influencing parameters mentioned above. It has been estimated that the simulation equation developed predicts the values of KLa and power with an average standard error of estimation of 0. 0164 and 7. 66 respectively and with R 2 values of 0. 979 and 0. 989 respectively, when compared with experimentally determined values.
