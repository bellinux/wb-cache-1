500|$|Square Enix was {{supposed}} to pay Grin US$16.5 million {{for the production of}} Fortress in successive waves in accordance with the project's milestones. No payments were made during the first two months of development, but Grin's co-founder Bo Andersson was initially not worried as he considered delayed payments common and had faith in the project. However, several more months went by without payments, costing the studio 12 million krona a month. Grin closed all of their offices except for the main one in Stockholm, but still no money came. In 2009, Grin released Terminator Salvation, , and Bionic Commando to negative reviews and poor sales, which caused further financial woes and seemed to make Square Enix nervous. The publisher wanted updates and asked that all of the game's assets, including the code, the music files, and even the game's developer language <b>be</b> <b>faxed</b> to them. This move was described as impossible and [...] "almost a criminal behavior" [...] by Andersson.|$|E

The EEA links these countries into the EU's market, extending the four freedoms to these states. In return, they pay a membership fee and have to adopt most areas of EU law (which they do not have direct impact in shaping).

50|$|Fax has no {{technical}} {{advantage over}} sending information over the Internet, using {{technologies such as}} email, scanner, and graphics file formats; however, it is extremely simple to use: put the documents to <b>be</b> <b>faxed</b> in a hopper, dial a phone number, and press a button. Fax continues to be used over the telephone network at locations without computer and Internet facilities; and sometimes a fax of a document with a person's handwritten signature is a requirement for legal reasons. Computer fax over the Internet allows fax communication without an actual fax machine at either or both ends.|$|E

However, if an item is rare, fragile, or exceptionally valuable, the owning library is {{under no obligation to}} release it for interlibrary loan. Some collections and volumes, especially bound journals and one-of-a-kind manuscripts, are non-circulating, meaning that they may not be borrowed. Books may be delivered by mail or by courier service. Photocopies may <b>be</b> <b>faxed,</b> or scanned and delivered electronically.

Subsequently, in 2008, just before a new presidential election, new legislation that required all major Internet portal sites to require identity verification of their users was put into effect. This applies to all users who add any publicly viewable content. For example, to post a comment on a news article, a user registration and citizen identity number verification is required. For foreigners {{who do not have}} such numbers, a copy of passport must <b>be</b> <b>faxed</b> and verified. Although this law was initially met with public outcry, as of 2008, most of the major portals, including Daum, Naver, Nate, and Yahoo Korea, enforce such verification before the user can post any material that is publicly viewable. YouTube refused to conform to the law, instead opting to disable the commenting feature on its Korean site.|$|E
