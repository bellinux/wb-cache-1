5|$|Adopted {{children}} are children that were given up at birth, abandoned or {{were unable to}} be cared for by their <b>biological</b> <b>parents.</b> They may have been put into foster care before finding their permanent residence. It is particularly hard for adopted children to get adopted from foster care: 50,000 children were adopted in 2001. The average age of these children was 7, which shows that fewer older children were adopted.|$|E
5|$|Currently 1,500,000 (2% of all U.S children) are adopted. There are {{different}} types of adoption; embryo adoption when a couple is having trouble conceiving a child and instead choose to have their sperm and egg conjoined outside the womb, international adoption where couples adopt children that come from foreign countries, and private adoption {{which is the most}} common form of adoption. In private adoption, families can adopt children via licensed agencies or with by directly contacting the child's <b>biological</b> <b>parents.</b>|$|E

5|$|This {{decision}} {{may cause}} regret in some men and women. Of women aged over 30 who have undergone tubal ligation, about 5% regret their decision, {{as compared with}} 20% of women aged under 30. By contrast, less than 5% of men are likely to regret sterilization. Men more likely to regret sterilization are younger, have young or no children, or have an unstable marriage.

5|$|After falling {{pregnant}} by Brett Macklin (Gerry Sont), Ruth Stewart (Justine Clarke) {{gave birth}} to Martha. However, she decided to give Martha up for adoption to a family called the MacKenzies. Martha grew up on her new family's farm. Her adoptive parents died, leaving Martha with the farm and her adoptive brothers. Martha then {{went in search of}} her <b>biological</b> <b>parents.</b> Brett did not want to know her, but she managed to form a relationship with Ruth and went to live with her in New York. Her grandfather, Alf, and her great aunt, Morag (Cornelia Frances), came to visit and Martha chose to return to Australia to live with her relatives.|$|E
5|$|Chad Harris-Crane is {{the main}} love {{interest}} and later husband of Whitney Russell; {{he is also the}} father of Miles Davis Harris-Crane and another child. Chad's early appearances focus on his search for his <b>biological</b> <b>parents,</b> and his love triangle with sisters Whitney and Simone. Chad is initially believed to be Eve and Julian's child, which would make his relationship with Whitney incestuous. Chad's birth certificate later proves he was conceived when Alistair Crane raped Eve's adoptive sister Liz Sanbourne. He reunites with Whitney without the stigma of incest. During his separation from Whitney, Chad initiates a sexual relationship with Vincent Clarkson and continues it after his marriage. He is unaware he is committing incest because he is Vincent's half-uncle, adoptive half-cousin, and half-brother-in-law. After catching Chad having sex with Vincent, Whitney files for divorce; they later begin to reconcile through helping Theresa Lopez-Fitzgerald and Ethan Winthrop reunite as a couple. Their potential reconciliation is cut short when Chad is murdered by Alistair.|$|E
40|$|Background: Varicose veins (VVs) {{cluster in}} families, but the {{familial}} risk of VVs {{has not been}} determined among adoptees. The aim was to estimate whether the familial transmission of VVs is related to disease in <b>biological</b> and/or adoptive <b>parents.</b> Study Design: The Swedish Multi-Generation Register and the Swedish Patient Register were used to follow all Swedish-born adoptees (born 1932 through 2004) that could be linked to both their biological and their adoptive parents (n = 80, 214; 50 % females). The risk of VVs was estimated in adoptees with at least 1 <b>biological</b> <b>parent</b> with VVs, but no adoptive parent with VVs (n = 187) compared with adoptees without a <b>biological</b> or adoptive <b>parent</b> with VVs (n = 1, 758). The risk of VVs was also determined in adoptees with at least 1 adoptive <b>parent,</b> but no <b>biological</b> <b>parent</b> with VVs (n = 87), and in adoptees with both <b>biological</b> and adoptive <b>parents</b> affected (n = 21). Results: Adoptees from an affected <b>biological</b> <b>parent,</b> but no adoptive parent, {{were more likely to}} have VVs than adoptees from an unaffected <b>biological</b> or adoptive <b>parent</b> (standard incidence ratio [SIR] = 2. 21; 95 % CI, 1. 91 - 2. 55). The familial SIR for adoptees with both an affected <b>biological</b> <b>parent</b> and an adoptive parent was 4. 58 (95 % CI, 2. 83 - 7. 01). Adoptees with an affected adoptive <b>parent</b> but no <b>biological</b> <b>parent</b> were not at increased risk of VVs (SIR = 1. 15; 95 % CI, 0. 92 - 1. 42). Conclusions: These novel findings suggest that genetic factors make a strong contribution to the familial transmission of VVs from parents to offspring, although familial environmental factors might contribute...|$|R

In the US, most children enter foster care due to neglect. If a <b>biological</b> <b>parent</b> or legal guardian is unwilling {{to care for a}} child, the child is deemed to be dependent and is placed under the care of the child protection agency.

5|$|Enlisting {{the help}} of the Stabbington Brothers, a duo of muscular thieves who were once betrayed by Flynn, Gothel offers them both revenge on Flynn Rider and Rapunzel's gift once they agree to help her find them, not {{intending}} to keep the latter half of her promise as she only wants Rapunzel for herself. When her initial attempt to convince Rapunzel to return home with her fails, Gothel, upon a second encounter, tricks the Stabbington Brothers into immobilizing Flynn, later knocking them unconscious when they attempt to kidnap Rapunzel. Convincing Rapunzel that Flynn has betrayed her, they return to the tower. While Flynn escapes from the dungeon, Rapunzel suddenly realizes her true identity and rebels against Gothel, only to be chained and gagged. Gothel stabs Flynn upon his arrival to rescue Rapunzel, but agrees to free Rapunzel long enough to heal him on the condition that she remain with her forever. However, Flynn unexpectedly cuts Rapunzel's hair, causing it to lose its magic. It turns brown, and a horrified Gothel (failing to salvage Rapunzel's hair) ages rapidly, falling out of the tower's window but disintegrating into dust before she hits the ground, essentially dying of old age. Flynn dies in Rapunzel's arms, but is miraculously returned to life by Rapunzel's tear, and she is finally reunited with her <b>biological</b> <b>parents.</b>|$|E

Nicole later decides she and Geoff should return to the island to repair their relationship. They chased through woodland by a murderer, Derrick who tries to kill them both. However they manage to escape. Nicole decides to try her best to make their relationship work. However, after Freya kisses her they enter a few rocky periods and later break up.|$|E
5|$|Prior to her disappearance, {{according}} to her friends, Carol was feeling depressed. She had talked of tracing her <b>biological</b> <b>parents,</b> as she was adopted. On 17 July 1976, she went missing. Gordon claimed that she had left home for another man, and Carol had left their home in Leece twice before. It was for this reason, Gordon claimed, {{that he did not}} report her missing for six weeks. Carol was said to time her periods away from home to coincide with the school holidays. Gordon claimed that it wasn't until she didn't return in time to take up her job as a primary school teacher in September (the start of the school term) that he realised that there was a problem. At this time he reported her missing via his solicitor, and her family was informed. On the day she vanished, the family had been due to visit Blackpool on a day trip. However, Carol said she felt unwell and wanted to remain behind in bed. She was never seen alive again by her family. Gordon claimed he returned home to find Carol had left the house, leaving behind her wedding ring, {{and that there was no}} sign of a struggle. A missing persons enquiry was launched, but nothing came of it. This missing persons report was subsequently lost, and it was implied by some that it was because both Gordon and a senior police commander (who, by the time the article was published, had died) involved in the case were freemasons. This was rebutted by Sandra Lean, who, in No Smoke, claimed that Gordon had never been a freemason. At the time, police told Gordon that, should a body be found, he would be the main suspect.|$|E

50|$|Since 2014 in Croatia, {{a similar}} {{institution}} called partner-guardianship exists. It allows a life partner {{who is not a}} <b>biological</b> <b>parent</b> of their partner's child or children to gain parental responsibilities on a temporary or permanent basis.|$|R
50|$|A life {{partner who}} is not the <b>biological</b> <b>parent</b> of his partners' child or {{children}} can gain parental responsibilities on a temporary or permanent basis. During a life partnership, a parent or parents of a child or children can temporarily entrust a life partner {{who is not}} the <b>biological</b> <b>parent</b> with parental rights. Should those rights last over 30 days, the decision must be certified with the solicitor. In this situation, {{as long as the}} parental rights last, parent/parents and a life partner must agree on decisions important for the child's/children's well-being. In case of a dissolution of a life partnership, a partner who is not the <b>biological</b> <b>parent</b> can maintain personal relationship with the child or children, should the court decide it is in their best interest. Partner-guardianship is an institution created within the Life Partnership Act that enables a life partner who is not the <b>biological</b> <b>parent</b> to gain permanent parental rights, and is similar to stepchild adoption. Such a relationship between the non-parent life partner and the child may be established under two conditions; if the child's or children's parent-partner is deceased, under condition that a second parent is also deceased, or his/her parental rights have been terminated due to child abuse. Alternately, if a parent-partner is alive, but a second parent is unknown, deceased, or his/her parental rights have been terminated, the life partner who is not the <b>biological</b> <b>parent</b> can become a partner-guardian if the court decides in their favour. Both formal and informal life partners are eligible to partner-guardianship. The partner-guardian receives full parental responsibility {{as is the case with}} stepchild adoption, and is registered in the child's birth certificate as their partner-guardian. Partner-guardianship is a permanent next-of-kin relationship with all the right, responsibilities, and legal impacts as that of a parent and a child. A single person regardless of sexual orientation is allowed to adopt. On 13 July 2015, it was reported that the first case of partner-guardianship had been granted.|$|R
