25|$|The {{part that}} I never really {{developed}} {{is the death}} of Luke and Leia's mother. I had a backstory for her in earlier drafts, but it basically didn't survive. When I got to Jedi, I wanted {{one of the kids}} {{to have some kind of}} memory of her because she will be a key figure in the new episodes I'm writing. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> debated whether or not Leia should remember her.|$|E

500|$|The opening track, [...] "Afraid" [...] (featuring rapper Attitude), is a {{description}} of Furtado's fear of what people think of her, and she has said the chorus reminds her of [...] "walking down the hall in high school ... because you live from the outside in. Now that I'm an adult, I care about the inside of me ... Before I said I didn't care about what people thought about me, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> did." ...|$|E

500|$|Conversely, Noel Murray of The Onions The A.V. Club graded [...] "Snakehead" [...] with a B+, {{explaining}} {{the focus on}} Walter was a [...] "smart choice by the Fringe team thematically". Murray continued, [...] "Ordinarily I'd be griping that this episode was yet another mythology-free time-waster, with a plot that—two-foot-long parasites aside—could be passed along to any other procedural show currently on the air. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> enjoyed 'Snakehead,' both {{because of the way}} the story reflected who Walter is and because of all the little touches of character development and scene-setting.|$|E
500|$|On March 7, 2011, it was {{reported}} that Universal would not proceed with At the Mountains of Madness because del Toro was unwilling to compromise on the $150 million budget and R rating. The director later reflected, [...] "When it happened, this has never happened to me, but I actually cried that weekend a lot. I don't want to sound like a puny soul, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> was devastated. I was weeping for the movie." [...] The project collapsed on a Friday, and del Toro signed to direct Pacific Rim the following Monday.|$|E

We are {{finished}} with Columbia. So, there is nothing written in stone. We'll see what the fans want." [...] In an interview with Rolling Stone about what the future holds, Joe Perry admitted that, [...] "I don't even know if making new albums makes sense anymore. Maybe we'll just release an EP every six months. I don't know what the future looks like." ...|$|E

500|$|The role of Holly {{was created}} by series co-creator Ryan Murphy {{specifically}} for Paltrow, a personal friend. Murphy suggested that she showcase her vocal and dancing talent ahead of the December 2010 release of the film Country Strong, in which Paltrow plays a country singer. Murphy said of Paltrow, [...] "Gwyneth is a great singer. She's done {{it a little bit}} <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> want to show it off and show everyone how great she is." [...] It {{was not the first time}} Paltrow had sung on screen: she played a karaoke singer in the movie Duets in 2000, and had a number one hit in Australia for her duet of [...] "Cruisin' from its soundtrack.|$|E
500|$|Jackson told Sister 2 Sister magazine, [...] "There {{were some}} people who didn't like the {{direction}} I took with this album. I love doing dance songs and I think my fans expect that of me. I have been getting more behind the scenes with film and television. I will probably continue to do music – and acting is still a strong passion of mine – <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> have been loving behind-the-scenes work: producing, directing and all the technical stuff". A {{few months before the}} split, a spokesperson for the label told Billboard, [...] "Unfortunately we haven't experienced the results we would have liked with this new album. But we respect and support Janet".|$|E
500|$|Mikkel S. Eriksen, Tor Erik Hermansen, and Ester Dean {{assisted}} Perry {{in writing}} [...] "Peacock" [...] for her third studio album, Teenage Dream, released in 2010. According to Perry, {{the whole point}} of writing [...] "Peacock" [...] was to play with words. Midway through recording the album, Perry recalled saying to the people she was working with: [...] "Look I've got a lot of jewels, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> don't have the crown. I really don't have that full-blown presentation". So she then decided {{to get back into the}} studio and work with Stargate, a production team co-producing Teenage Dream, during a late-night session and made several more songs, including [...] "Firework" [...] and [...] "Peacock".|$|E

500|$|Whedon {{approached}} Nathan Fillion to {{play the}} lead role of Malcolm Reynolds; after Whedon explained the premise and showed him the treatment for the pilot, Fillion was eager for the role. Fillion was called back several times to read for the part before he was cast. He noted that [...] "it was really thrilling. It was my first lead and I was pretty nervous, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> wanted that part and I wanted to tell those stories." [...] Fillion later said he was [...] "heartbroken" [...] when he learned the series had been cancelled. Fillion has called his time on Firefly the best acting job he ever had, and compares every job {{he has had to}} it.|$|E
500|$|During 1940, Friedman was {{appointed}} {{an assistant professor}} teaching Economics at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, but encountered antisemitism in the Economics department and {{decided to return to}} government service. From 1941 to 1943 Friedman worked on wartime tax policy for the federal government, as an advisor to senior officials of the United States Department of the Treasury. As a Treasury spokesman during 1942 he advocated a Keynesian policy of taxation. He helped to invent the payroll withholding tax system, since the federal government badly needed money in order to fight the war. He later said, [...] "I have no apologies for it, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> wish we hadn't found it necessary and I wish there were some way of abolishing withholding now." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{asked if}} {{religion}} {{plays a part}} in her life in 2009, Streep replied: [...] "I follow no doctrine. I don't belong to a church or a temple or a synagogue or an ashram." [...] In an interview in December 2008, she also alluded to her lack of religious belief when she said: [...] "So I've always been really, deeply interested, because I think I can understand the solace that's available in the whole construct of religion. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> don't believe {{in the power of}} prayer, or things would have been avoided that have happened, that are awful. So it's a horrible position as an intelligent, emotional, yearning human being to sit outside of the available comfort there. But I just can't go there." ...|$|E

The powers that be are only as interested in you as they think you are in the job. For me it's about more than turning up and saying the lines. It's about understanding it and trying to make it better. That's actually a lot of fun. What's great is nobody says, 'Just shut up.' They want you to work at it. [...] I surprise myself sometimes because after {{two and a half years}} sometimes I see friends on the side of a poster and I think, 'do I want to do something else?' <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> like this job, I never get that awful ‘dread’ feeling when you really don’t want to go into work." ...|$|E
500|$|French {{director}} Jean-Baptiste Mondino {{was selected}} by Bowie to direct an accompanying music video. Regarding this, Bowie said, [...] "It's an experiment; I'm really putting myself in his [...] hands. [...] I think if I did it , {{it would be very}} abrasive, and I'm not quite sure if that's how I want the song to come off visually. In concert it will be abrasive; it won't have the same quality as the video. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> think Mondino is a fantastic video maker. He just knows that this is his genre. He's like a craftsman and that's what he's trying to perfect, this craft of making his five minutes work." [...] Actor Joe Dallesandro makes appearances throughout the clip, announcing the dance marathon. A shot from the music video was used to commercialize 7" [...] releases of the single.|$|E
500|$|Having {{originally}} {{agreed to}} serve {{for a year}} Gleeson wrote to Father Bernard Rawlinson, the senior Roman Catholic chaplain, in October 1915 requesting that he be relieved of duty stating that [...] "I am sorry to be leaving the dear old Munster lads, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> can't stand it any longer. I {{do not like the}} life, though I love the poor men ever so much". He became a curate at the Church of Our Lady of Lourdes in Dublin but requested permission from his Archbishop, William Walsh, to return to army service for another year. He was recommissioned in his previous rank on 15 May 1917 and would serve another two years. When the Royal Munster Fusiliers were transferred to the 48th Brigade, 16th (Irish) Division on 29 January 1918 Gleeson remained with the 1st Infantry Division.|$|E

500|$|Musically, Stripped is a pop and R album which {{incorporates}} {{elements of}} many different genres, including soul, metal, hip hop, rock, rock and roll, gospel and Latin. The album broke her teen pop root in the self-titled debut album in 1999. According to Aguilera, {{she wanted to be}} [...] "real" [...] in her next records because she was [...] "overworked" [...] at the time she was [...] "a part of the big craze pop phenomenon". Multiple critics criticized its musical style, calling it a lack of musical concentration. On Stripped, Aguilera became the writer of most of the songs. She also revealed that Perry's songwriting on Pink's album Missundaztood (2001) inspired Aguilera a lot. She further commented, [...] "I wasn't a big fan of the Dallas Austin songs, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>really,</b> really loved the Linda Perry song".|$|E
500|$|Historian Seth Jacobs {{asserted}} that Đức had [...] "reduced America's Diệm experiment to ashes as well" [...] and that [...] "no amount of pleading could retrieve Diệm's reputation" [...] once Browne's images had become ingrained into {{the psyche of}} the world public. Ellen Hammer described the event as having [...] "evoked dark images of persecution and horror corresponding to a profoundly Asian reality that passed the understanding of Westerners." [...] John Mecklin, an official from the U.S. embassy, noted that the photograph [...] "had a shock effect of incalculable value to the Buddhist cause, becoming {{a symbol of the}} state of things in Vietnam." [...] William Colby, then chief of the Central Intelligence Agency's Far East Division, opined that Diệm [...] "handled the Buddhist crisis fairly badly and allowed it to grow. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> don't think there was much they could have done about it once that bonze burned himself." ...|$|E

Two months later, the hiatus was briefly interrupted when they did two shows supporting Coldplay along with Jay-Z at Wembley Stadium. In April 2012, during an interview with Chris Moyles on Radio 1, Cheryl Cole revealed the girls had been in talks to regroup for the group's tenth anniversary later that year. In August 2012, Nicola Roberts was also featured on the same radio show, and said, [...] "It's our tenth birthday in November so we will definitely celebrating.
