5000|$|If {{there is}} a {{dishwasher}} without a <b>booster</b> <b>heater,</b> it may require a water temperature within a range of [...] for optimum cleaning, but tempering valves set {{to no more than}} [...] can be applied to faucets to avoid scalding. Tank temperatures above [...] may produce limescale deposits, which could later harbor bacteria, in the water tank. Higher temperatures may also increase etching of glassware in the dishwasher.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to domestic units, industrial dishwashers {{are available for}} use in commercial establishments such as hotels and restaurants, where {{a large number of}} dishes must be cleaned. Washing is conducted with temperatures of 65 - 71 C and sanitation is achieved by either the use of a <b>booster</b> <b>heater</b> that will provide a 82 C [...] "final rinse" [...] temperature or {{through the use of a}} chemical sanitizer.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike a {{residential}} dishwasher, a commercial dishwasher does not utilize a drying cycle (commercial drying {{is achieved by}} heated ware meeting open air once the wash/rinse/sanitation cycles have been completed) and thus are significantly faster than their residential counterparts. Washing is conducted with 65-71 째C / 150-160 째F temperatures and sanitation is achieved by either {{the use of a}} <b>booster</b> <b>heater</b> that will provide the machine 82 째C / 180 째F [...] "final rinse" [...] temperature or {{through the use of a}} chemical sanitizer. This distinction labels the machines as either [...] "high-temp" [...] or [...] "low-temp".|$|E
50|$|A Berkshire type was {{the first}} of the Lima Super Power {{locomotives}} in 1925 and these followed in that tradition, with all the latest equipment -- Schmidt superheater, Elesco feedwater <b>heater,</b> <b>booster</b> on the trailing truck, roller bearings, and so forth. They carried Baker valve gear, which the C&O preferred to the simpler and much more widely used Walschaerts valve gear.|$|R
50|$|The first Mohawks {{delivered}} for the NYC {{were delivered}} by ALCO in 1916; these were purely freighters, with 69-inch drivers and small tenders. Further orders of L-1 subclasses followed in subsequent years, including {{some from the}} Lima Locomotive Works. All these locomotives had uncluttered lines as built, mostly thanks {{to the lack of}} such modern appliances as feedwater <b>heaters,</b> <b>booster</b> engines and the like. Many had feedwater heaters and other appliances added later, however. 185 L-1 locomotives were produced.|$|R
5000|$|A {{total of}} 24 AMC AMXs, all 1969 models {{were made by}} AMI between August, 1969 and July, 1970. [...] All {{featured}} the 343 CID L V8s. Differences to the RHD two-seater AMXs compared to the U.S. models included swapping the power brake <b>booster</b> and <b>heater</b> motor on the firewall, the power steering pump remained in its usual left location, although {{the rest of the}} steering components had to be {{on the right side of}} the cars. All of the Australian AMX interiors were finished in black featuring a unique RHD dashboard with a wood-grained instrument cluster in front of the driver. While the AMX was marketed as a performance muscle car in the U.S. marketplace, the Australian AMXs came with a large high level of equipment that was optional in the U.S., and these AMXs were advertised as personal luxury cars.|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of operating parameters on convection in the Bridgman-Stockbarger technique was studied with a transparent furnace and melt. Convection was nearly nonexistent near the interface in the vertically stabilized configuration (temperature increasing with height). With {{the addition of}} a short <b>booster</b> <b>heater</b> between the main heater and the cooler, a destabilizing temperature gradient (temperature decreasing with height) was produced in the melt near the interface, and significant convection was produced throughout the entire melt. Convective velocities increased and flow symmetry improved as power to the <b>booster</b> <b>heater</b> was increased...|$|E
40|$|A high {{gradient}} {{directional solidification}} furnace is disclosed which includes eight thermal zones throughout {{the length of}} the furnace. In the hot end of the furnace, furnace elements provide desired temperatures. These elements include Nichrome wire received in a grooved tube which is encapsulated y an outer alumina core. A <b>booster</b> <b>heater</b> is provided in the hot end of the furnace which includes toroidal tungsten/rhenium wire which has a capacity to put heat quickly into the furnace. An adiabatic zone is provided by an insulation barrier to separate the hot end of the furnace from the cold end. The old end of the furnace is defined by additional heating elements. A heat transfer plate provides a means by which heat may be extracted from the furnace and conducted away through liquid cooled jackets. By varying the input of heat via the <b>booster</b> <b>heater</b> and output of heat via the heat transfer plate, a desired thermal gradient profile may be provided...|$|E
40|$|A {{relatively}} simple one-dimensional thermal {{model of the}} Bridgman growth process has been developed which is applicable {{to the growth of}} small diameter samples with conductivities similar to those of metallic alloys. The heat flow in a translating rod is analyzed {{in a way that is}} applicable to Biot numbers less than unity. The model accommodates an adiabatic zone, different heat transfer coefficients in the hot and cold zones, and changes in sample material properties associated with phase change. The analysis is applied to several simplified cases. The effect of the rod's motion is studied in a three-zone furnace for a rod sufficiently long that end effects can be neglected; end effects are then investigated for a motionless rod. Finally, the addition of a fourth zone, an independently controlled <b>booster</b> <b>heater</b> between the main heater and the adiabatic zone, is evaluated for its ability to increase the gradient in the sample at the melt interface and to control the position of the interface...|$|E
2500|$|Differences to the RHD Australian AMXs (compared to the U.S. models) {{included}} different outside rear-view mirrors, {{and black}} vinyl trim inside the [...] "AMX" [...] circle logo on the C-pillars, As with Rambler sedans built in right hand drive, windscreen wipers were not reversed, remaining LHD pattern, {{but the power}} brake <b>booster</b> and <b>heater</b> on the firewall were swapped over. Although the power steering pump remained in its usual left location, {{the remainder of the}} steering components were {{on the right side of}} the car. The cars came with [...] and automatic transmission, power steering, power disk brakes, [...] "twin-grip" [...] rear axle, and other items that were optional on the U.S. models. All of the Australian AMX interiors were finished in black and featured unique seats, door panels, and a fiberglass RHD dashboard with a wood-grained instrument cluster in front of the driver. The Australian AMXs came with a large high level of equipment and were promoted as [...] "super" [...] personal luxury cars.|$|R
