50|$|The tintype was {{essentially}} {{a variant of the}} ambrotype, replacing the latter's glass plate with a thin sheet of japanned iron (hence ferro). Ambrotypes often exhibit some flaking of their black <b>back</b> <b>coating,</b> cracking or detachment of the image-bearing emulsion layer, or other deterioration, but the image layer on a tintype has proven to be typically very durable.|$|E
50|$|All tape {{thicknesses}} here {{refer to}} the total tape thickness unless otherwise specified, including the base, the oxide coating and any <b>back</b> <b>coating.</b> In the USA, tape thickness is often expressed as {{the thickness of the}} base alone. However, this varies from manufacturer to manufacturer and also between tape formulations from the same manufacturer. Outside of the USA, the overall thickness is more often quoted, and is the more relevant measurement when relating the thickness to the length that can be fit onto a reel or into a cassette.|$|E
50|$|<b>Backing</b> <b>coats</b> {{are applied}} to the {{underside}} of the strip with or without a primer.

50|$|Available {{coatings}} include polyesters, plastisols, polyurethanes, polyvinylidene fluorides (PVDF), epoxies, primers, <b>backing</b> <b>coats</b> and laminate films. For each product, {{the coating}} is {{built up in}} a number of layers.|$|R
50|$|Some tapes may {{deteriorate}} {{because of}} a breakdown in the binder (the glue) that holds the oxide particles on the tape, or the <b>back</b> <b>coating</b> on the reverse side, if the tape was {{from any of the}} tape manufacturers who had inadvertently used an unstable binder formulation. That binder contained polyurethane that soaks up water and causes the urethane to rise to the tape's surface. This problem became known as the 'sticky-shed syndrome'. One explanation was offered that short strands of urethane were most commonly used in tapes - until it was discovered that middle-sized strands are better and were good at absorbing moisture. Baking the tape temporarily restores the tape by driving the water molecules from the binder {{so that it can be}} safely copied to another tape or a different format. After baking, the tape usually remains in good condition for approximately a month. If the tape re-deteriorates, it may be possible to bake the tape again.|$|E
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} the first room‐temperature low‐threshold continuous‐wave (cw) operation of Al 0. 3 Ga 0. 7 As/GaAs single quantum well (SQW) heterostructure lasers grown by metalorganic {{chemical vapor deposition}} (MOCVD) on Si substrates using techniques of SiO 2 <b>back</b> <b>coating</b> and thermal cycle annealing. The all‐MOCVD‐grown SQW lasers on GaAs/Si with etch pit density of 1. 5 × 107 cm- 2 have threshold current as low as 55 mA (1. 41 kA/cm 2) under cw at room temperature. The SiO 2 <b>back</b> <b>coating</b> is effective to obtain excellent current‐voltage characteristics. Thermal cycle annealing is also found to improve the crystallinity of GaAs/Si and to contribute to room‐temperature cw operation of the lasers on Si substrates...|$|E

50|$|In {{architecture}} a quirk {{is a small}} 'V' shaped channel used {{to insulate}} and give relief to a convex rounded moulding. To create the plastered corner, <b>backing</b> <b>coat</b> (browning) is plastered up to the staff bead, then the quirk is cut into the <b>backing</b> <b>coat</b> a little larger than the finished size. When the top skimming coat is applied, again the bead is fully skimmed in and then, using a straight edge, the quirk is re-cut to the finished depth, usually on an approximate 45 degree angle into the bead. The quirk will hide the eventual small crack that will form between the staff bead and plaster.|$|R

Most of the fabrics are cotton and cotton blends with polyester. Printing is essentially all done with water insoluble pigment dispersions. Other operations which support the printing process are fabric preparation, dyeing, and finishing. Foam <b>back</b> <b>coating</b> is also done, with and without flame retardlng additives.

40|$|The {{contrast}} {{visible in}} a coated relief specimen viewed by {{transmission electron microscopy}} is generated by the angular difference between the direction of contrast coat evaporation and the direction from which the relief is viewed. This contrast can often be exploited for the computer reconstruction of specimen relief from optical density data if the contrast angle is known. If an additional <b>backing</b> <b>coat</b> is present, the relief must be viewed along the direction of <b>backing</b> <b>coat</b> evaporation, and may therefore require reorientation {{by the use of}} a rotate/tilt holder. Despite attainment of correct orientation, undercutting  multiple intersections of imaging electrons with different regions of contrast coat  may yet prevent valid reconstruction. Although the danger of experiencing undercutting is high, "vertical" coating, in conjunction with minimal tilting, could be used when maximum relief information is required from a unique specimen. Bidirectional contrasting may also be useful for increasing the information capacity of relief coats...|$|R

40|$|Thermal {{printing}} is a {{rapid and}} inexpensive printing technology {{widely used in}} commercial applications such as point-of-sale receipts, luggage tags, faxes, and labels (Mendum, Stoler et al. 2011). Direct thermal printing produces an image when specific chemicals within the coating of thermal paper are heated. 5 Thermal printing technology was first developed in the late 1960 s, and its popularity grew in the 1980 s and 1990 s as it became more cost effective and versatile. This chapter describes {{the components of the}} thermal paper system, its associated equipment, process, and applications, as well as the alternative chemicals analyzed and considered in the alternatives assessment. 3. 1 Components of Thermal Paper Thermal paper is a highly engineered product that is coated with a thermal sensitive layer that reacts in the presence of heat to create the printed image. The following sections describe the key components of thermal paper development, including chemistry and manufacture. This information was useful in evaluating potential alternatives in this application. 3. 1. 1 Paper Thermal paper is a standard paper grade that has been coated with a thermal sensitive layer, also known as a thermal reactive layer (see Figure 3 - 1). A pre-coat, or base coat, is applied to the base paper and allows for high resolution by preventing the heat transfer through all of the paper‟s layers, and for smoothness. Applied to the pre-coat is a thermal layer that contains the necessary reactive components (see Section 3. 1. 2). Additionally, thermal paper may contain a protective top <b>coat</b> and/or <b>back</b> <b>coat.</b> Top coats may be used for some applications to protect thermal paper from mechanical stress or chemical reactions. Similarly, <b>back</b> <b>coats</b> may be used to provide additional protection during lamination, printing, or other mechanical processes (Koehler Thermal Papers n. d.). Thermal paper used for receipts typically lack the top and <b>back</b> <b>coats...</b>|$|R
