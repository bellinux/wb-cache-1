5000|$|Piroxicam [...] (INN, BAN, USAN, AAN; in some {{countries}} it is spelt piroksikam or piroxikam) is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) of the oxicam class used to relieve the symptoms of painful, inflammatory conditions like arthritis. Piroxicam works by preventing the production of endogenous prostaglandins which {{are involved in the}} mediation of pain, stiffness, tenderness and swelling. The medicine is available as capsules, tablets and (not in all countries) as a prescription-free gel 0.5%. It is also available in a <b>betadex</b> formulation, which allows a more rapid absorption of piroxicam from the digestive tract.|$|E
5000|$|On June 25, 2010, Bayer sued Teva for falsely {{claiming}} that Gianvi, Teva's Generic of Yaz, was [...] "stabilized by <b>betadex</b> as a clathrate." [...] The lawsuit stems from Bayer's US patent, 5798338, on the binding and preservative agents {{that were not}} in fact present in Gianvi. [...] "In the preparation of such low-dosed dosage forms, strong fluctuations of the active ingredient concentrations in the dosage units occur almost unavoidably (inadequate content uniformity), which manifest themselves more strongly, the smaller {{the amount of the}} active ingredient. It has now been found that the drawbacks that are observed especially in the preparation and storage of dosage forms which contain low-dosed steroidal sex hormones can be avoided, at least to a large extent, if dosage forms are prepared that contain powdery cyclodextrin clathrates of these active ingredients."The settlement of the lawsuit resulted in Teva changing its product marketing to remove the claim that it used the same ingredients as Yaz. Bayer's patent is on a method specifically designed to prevent oxidative degradation of the estrogen.|$|E
