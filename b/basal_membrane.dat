25|$|The <b>basal</b> <b>membrane</b> is a histopathological {{extracellular}} matrix feature that forms {{at the center}} of injury and partially covers the astrocytic processes. It is composed of three layers with the basal lamina as the prominent layer. Molecularly, the <b>basal</b> <b>membrane</b> is created by glycoprotein and proteoglycan protomers. Further, two independent networks are formed within the <b>basal</b> <b>membrane</b> by collagen IV and laminin for structural support. Other molecular components of the <b>basal</b> <b>membrane</b> include fibulin-1, fibronectin, entactin, and hepparan sulfate proteoglycan perlecan. Ultimately, the astrocytes attach to the <b>basal</b> <b>membrane,</b> and the complex surrounds the blood vessels and nervous tissue to form the initial wound covering.|$|E
25|$|The {{glial scar}} also {{prevents}} neuronal regrowth. Following {{trauma to the}} CNS, axons begin to sprout and attempt to extend across the injury site in order to repair the damaged regions. However, the scar prevents axonal extensions via physical and chemical means. Astrocytes form a dense network of gap junctions that generates a physical barrier to axonal regrowth. Further, the astrocytes secrete several growth-inhibitory molecules that chemically prevent axonal extensions. Moreover, the <b>basal</b> <b>membrane</b> component is expected to generate an additional physical and chemical barrier to axonal extensions.|$|E
25|$|Kcne2-/- mice exhibit achlorhydria, gastric hyperplasia, and mis-trafficking of KCNQ1 to the parietal cell <b>basal</b> <b>membrane.</b> The mis-trafficking {{occurs because}} KCNE3 is {{upregulated}} in the parietal cells of Kcne2-/- mice, and hijacks KCNQ1, {{taking it to}} the basolateral membrane. When both Kcne2 and Kcne3 are germline-deleted in mice, KCNQ1 traffics to the parietal cell apical membrane but the gastric phenotype is even worse than for Kcne2-/- mice, emphasizing that KCNQ1 requires KCNE2 co-assembly for functional attributes other than targeting in parietal cells. Kcne2-/- mice also develop gastritis cystica profunda and gastric neoplasia. Human KCNE2 downregulation is also observed in sites of gastritis cystica profunda and gastric adenocarcinoma.|$|E

40|$|Two ampullary {{epithelial}} properties {{necessary for}} electroreception {{were used to}} identify the types of ion channels and transporters found in apical and <b>basal</b> <b>membranes</b> of ampullary receptor cells of skates and to assess their individual role under voltage-clamp conditions. The two essential properties are (1) a steady-state negative conductance generated in apical membranes and (2) a small, spontaneous current oscillation originating in <b>basal</b> <b>membranes</b> (Lu and Fishman, 1995). The effects of pharmacological agents and ion substitutions on these properties were evaluated from transorgan or transepithelial complex admittance determinations in the frequency range 0. 125 to 50 Hz measured in individual, isolated ampullary organs. In apical membranes, L-type Ca channels {{were found to be}} responsible for generation of the steady-state negative conductance. In <b>basal</b> <b>membranes,</b> K and Ca-dependent Cl (Cl(Ca)) channels were demonstrated to contribute to a net positive membrane conductance. L-type Ca channels were also evident in <b>basal</b> <b>membranes</b> and are thought to function in synaptic transmission from the electroreceptive epithelium to the primary afferent nerve. In addition to ion channels in <b>basal</b> <b>membranes,</b> two transporters (Na+/K+ pump and Na(+) -Ca+ exchanger) were apparent. Rapid (minutes) cessation of the current oscillation after blockage of any of the basal ion channels (Ca, Cl(Ca), K) suggests critical involvement of each of these channel types in the generation of the oscillation. Suppression of either Na+/K+ transport or Na(+) -Ca 2 + exchange also eliminated the oscillation but at a slower rate, indicating an indirect effect...|$|R
40|$|The biogenesis of {{plasmalemma}} glycoproteins of rat small-intestinal villus cells was {{studied by}} following the incorporation of l-[1, 5, 6 - 3 H]fucose, given intraperitoneally with and without chase, into Golgi, lateral <b>basal</b> and microvillus <b>membranes.</b> Each membrane fraction showed distinct kinetics of incorporation of labelled fucose and was differently affected by the chase, which produced a much greater decrease in incorporation of label into Golgi and microvillus than into lateral <b>basal</b> <b>membranes.</b> The kinetic data suggest a redistribution of newly synthesized glycoproteins {{from the site of}} fucosylation, the Golgi complex, directly into both lateral <b>basal</b> and microvillus <b>membranes.</b> The observed biphasic pattern of label incorporation into the microvillus membrane fraction may be evidence for a second indirect route of incorporation. The selective effect of the chase suggests the presence of two different pools of radioactive fucose in the Golgi complex that differ in (1) their accessibility to dilution with non-radioactive fucose, and (2) their utilization for the biosynthesis of membrane glycoproteins subsequently destined for either the microvillus or the lateral basal parts of the plasmalemma. The radioactively labelled glycoproteins of the different membrane fractions were separated by sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide-slab-gel electrophoresis and identified by fluorography. The patterns of labelled glycoproteins in Golgi and lateral <b>basal</b> <b>membranes</b> were identical at all times. At least 14 bands could be identified shortly after radioactive-fucose injection. Most seemed to disappear at later times, although one of them, which was never observed in microvillus membranes, increased in relative intensity. All but two of the labelled glycoproteins present in the microvillus membrane corresponded to those observed in Golgi and lateral <b>basal</b> <b>membranes</b> shortly after fucose injection. The patterns of labelled glycoproteins in all membrane fractions were little affected by the chase. These data support a flow concept for the insertion of most surface-membrane glycoproteins of the intestinal villus cells...|$|R
25|$|In females, {{synthesis}} of estrogens starts in theca interna {{cells in the}} ovary, by the {{synthesis of}} androstenedione from cholesterol. Androstenedione is a substance of weak androgenic activity which serves predominantly as a precursor for more potent androgens such as testosterone as well as estrogen. This compound crosses the <b>basal</b> <b>membrane</b> into the surrounding granulosa cells, where it is converted either immediately into estrone, or into testosterone and then estradiol in an additional step. The conversion of androstenedione to testosterone is catalyzed by 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17β-HSD), whereas the conversion of androstenedione and testosterone into estrone and estradiol, respectively is catalyzed by aromatase, enzymes which are both expressed in granulosa cells. In contrast, granulosa cells lack 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase, whereas theca cells express these enzymes and 17β-HSD but lack aromatase. Hence, both granulosa and theca cells are essential {{for the production of}} estrogen in the ovaries.|$|E

2500|$|The growth {{capacity}} of the axons lies in the microtubules which are located just beyond the actin filaments.

Laminins of the <b>basal</b> <b>membrane</b> interact with the integrins of the growth cone to promote the forward movement of the growth cone. Additionally, axon outgrowth is also supported by the stabilization of the proximal ends of microtubules, which provide the structural support for the axon.|$|E
40|$|Polyclonal {{antibodies}} raised {{against the}} human erythrocyte nucleoside transporter {{were used to}} investigate {{the distribution of the}} nucleoside transporters in the placenta. Immunoblots of brush-border membranes isolated from the human syncytiotrophoblast revealed a cross-reactive species that co-migrated with the erythrocyte nucleoside transporter as a broad band of apparent M(r) 55, 000. In contrast, no labelling was detected in <b>basal</b> <b>membranes</b> containing a similar number of equilibrative nucleoside transporters as assessed by nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBMPR) -binding. The absence of cross-reactive epitopes in <b>basal</b> <b>membranes</b> and their presence in brush-border membranes was confirmed by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. The results suggest that at least two isoforms of the NBMPR-sensitive nucleoside transporter are present in the human placenta.

40|$|The fine {{structure}} of the transitional epithelium of rat ureter has been studied in thin sections with the electron microscope, including some stained cytochemically to show nucleoside triphosphatase activity. The epithelium is three to four cells deep with cuboidal or columnar basal cells, intermediate cells, and superficial squamous cells.

It is of the nature of chitine; but boiling caustic potash has rather more effect on it than on true chitine; and I think boiling nitric acid rather less effect. In one single instance, namely, in Coronula, the cement comes out of the four orifices of the two bifurcating ducts, in the shape of distinct cells, which, between the whale's skin and the <b>basal</b> <b>membrane,</b> arrange themselves so as to make a circular, continuous slip of cement; then the cells blend together, and are converted into transparent, structureless cement. Cementing tissue or membrane would, perhaps, have been a more correct title than cement; but, in ordinary cases, its appearance is so little like that of an organised tissue, that I have for this reason, and for brevity-sake, preferred the simple term of Cement.|$|E

The purified receptors showed Mr 67000 on SDS/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. Specific binding of radioligand to the purified beta-adrenergic receptors displayed stereoselectivity, and the agonist competition profiles demonstrated the presence of both beta 1 - and beta 2 -receptors. By using the subtype-selective ligands CGP- 20712 A (beta 1 -selective) and ICI- 118, 551 (beta 2 -selective), the purified Mr- 67000 species was shown to be composed of equivalent amounts of beta 1 - and beta 2 -adrenergic receptors. Affinity chromatography on Sepharose-alprenolol and sequential elution with 1 microM-CGP- 20712 A followed by 100 microM(-) -alprenolol permitted beta 1 -adrenergic receptors to be resolved from the mixture of beta 1 -/beta 2 -adrenergic receptors.

50|$|Because glucose travels {{across the}} {{placenta}} (through diffusion facilitated by GLUT1 carrier), {{which is located}} in the syncytiotrophoblast on both the microvillus and <b>basal</b> <b>membranes,</b> these membranes may be the rate-limiting step in placental glucose transport. There is a two- to three-fold increase in the expression of syncytiotrophoblast glucose transporters with advancing gestation. Finally, the role of GLUT3/GLUT4 transport remains speculative. If the untreated gestational diabetes fetus is exposed to consistently higher glucose levels, this leads to increased fetal levels of insulin (insulin itself cannot cross the placenta). The growth-stimulating effects of insulin can lead to excessive growth and a large body (macrosomia). After birth, the high glucose environment disappears, leaving these newborns with ongoing high insulin production and susceptibility to low blood glucose levels (hypoglycemia).|$|R
