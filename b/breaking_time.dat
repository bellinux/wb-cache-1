The paper studies stroke <b>break</b> <b>times</b> within handwritten characters and presents a new method for setting HWR timeout by examining the <b>break</b> <b>time</b> distributions. For multi-stroke character HWR input, a timeout is widely used as a segmentation technique to initiate the recognition process. In this paper, we examine the largest stroke <b>break</b> <b>time</b> in each character and explore the relationship between <b>break</b> <b>time</b> distribution and optimal HWR timeout. The study used Chinese as test material and the test independent variables were writing condition (input box, full screen) and user’s posture while they were writing (hold device in hand, keep device on table). The main findings are: (1) the stroke <b>break</b> <b>times</b> are similar in full screen and input box conditions, though the users tend to write larger characters in full screen condition. (2) The stroke <b>break</b> <b>times</b> fit into a tight distribution. It is feasible to estimate optimal HWR timeout by studying stoke <b>break</b> <b>time</b> distribution. A nonparametric histogram method was used to model the stroke break distributions and it showed that typical Chinese HWR default timeouts are around 99 % percentile in the distribution. (3) Differences in HWR stroke break distributions are very significant between individual users. The stroke <b>break</b> <b>time</b> analysis can also be applied to design HWR timeout customization scale...|$|R

The purpose of this review was to identify the correlates of children's physical activity (aged 8 - 14 years) occurring during the school <b>break</b> <b>time</b> and after-school periods. A review was conducted of the peer-reviewed literature, published between 1990 and January 2011.

As a noted test pilot, Percival continued to fly his own creations; in 1935, he flew a Gull from England to Morocco {{and back to}} England, winning the Oswald Watt Gold Medal. He was the first pilot to fly from Britain to Africa and back in one day. He left Gravesend at 1.30am and returned to Croydon at 6.20pm. [...] "Day trips {{in the future will}} be as commonplace as trips to Margate" [...] he said in a broadcast at nine o'clock.

6000|$|Natick was {{looked upon}} {{with so much}} {{distrust}} and aversion that Government, fearing occasions of bloodshed, decided that the inhabitants must be removed to Deer Island. On the 7th of October a great fast-day, with prayer and preaching, had been held, and fierce and bitter entreaties had been uttered against the Indian Sachems, especially Philip. One wonders whether Eliot--now seventy-one years old--felt it come home {{to him that he}} knew not what spirit he had been of when he had prayed for the death of the Moorish prince. It must have been a heart- <b>breaking</b> <b>time</b> for the aged man, to see the spot founded in so much hope and prayer, the fruit of so much care and meditation, thus broken up and ruined, and when he was too old to do the like work over again. At the end of that month of October, Captain Thomas Prentiss, with a party of horse and five or six carts, arrived at Natick, and made known the commands of the Government. Sadly but patiently the Indians submitted. Two hundred men, women, and children were made to get together all they could carry, and marched from their homes to the banks of the Charles River. Here, at a spot called the Pines, Mr. Eliot met them, and they gathered round him to hear his words of comfort, as he exhorted them to meek patience, resignation, and steadiness to the faith. The scene was exceedingly affecting, as the white-haired pastor stood by the river-side beneath the tall pines, with his dark-skinned, newly reclaimed children about him, clinging to him for consolation, but neither murmuring nor struggling, only praying and encouraging one another. Captain Prentiss and his soldiers were deeply touched; but at midnight, when the tide was high enough, three large boats bore the Indians over to Deer Island. Here they were, transplanted from their comfortable homes in the beginning of a long and very severe winter; but, well divided by the river from all suspicion of doing violence, they fared better than the praying Indians of the new town of Wamesit. A barn full of hay and corn had been burnt, and fourteen men of Chelmsford, the next settlement, concluding it had been done by the Wamesit Red-skins, went thither, called them out of their wigwams, and then fired at them, killing a lad and five women and children. After all, the fire had been caused by some skulking heathen Indians; but though the Government obtained the arrest of the murderers, the jury would not find them guilty. The Wamesit Indians fled into the forest, and sent a piteous letter:--"We are not sorry for what we leave behind, but we are sorry that the English have driven us from our praying to God and from our teacher. We did begin to understand praying to God a little." [...] They were invited back, but were afraid to come till cold and hunger drove them to their old abode, and then the indefatigable Eliot and Gookin visited them, and did all in their power to bring about a better feeling towards them in Chelmsford.|$|E
40|$|School <b>break</b> <b>time</b> {{is one of}} the {{few times}} of the day for {{children}} to engage in selfdirected play with peers. The primary school curriculum recommends breaks of 10 minutes duration per day and a daily recreation period of 30 minutes. A survey questionnaire examined the policies and practices that influence the physical activity (PA) <b>break</b> <b>time</b> habits of children in 391 Irish primary schools. The response rate was 54. 5 %. Children’s PA levels were observed in three Irish primary schools at <b>break</b> <b>time</b> using the SOPLAY system of observation (McKenzie, 2002). The study found that boys were more active than girls at <b>break</b> <b>time.</b> The highest proportion of children was sedentary (39. 3 %) with the lowest proportion in the vigorous activity category (26. 4 %). Small schools (100 pupils) were less likely to provide school equipment to children to play with at all <b>break</b> <b>times</b> (p< 0. 05). Small schools (< 101 pupils) experience fewer barriers than larger schools specifically with respect to storage space, equipment cost or risk of equipment loss/damage and provision of loose equipment (p< 0. 05). Boys schools were more likely than girls schools to provide loose equipment at all <b>break</b> <b>times</b> (p< 0. 05). Given the 40 % PA <b>break</b> <b>time</b> threshold proposed by Ridgers and Stratton (2005), Irish primary schools should recognise the value of <b>break</b> <b>time</b> in providing 16 minutes of PA. This study suggests that safety is a barrier to PA promotion in relation to restrictive playground size and equipment. Schools promote certain practices at <b>break</b> <b>time</b> that influence children’s PA behaviour from implicit and or explicit policies. While the school is not solely responsible for children’s PA levels, simple strategic changes in practices may encourage and stimulate more children to be active...|$|R

This study investigated cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between a range of individual, behavioural, social and policy/organisational correlates and objectively measured school <b>break</b> <b>time</b> physical activity and sedentary time. METHODS: In 2006, 146 adolescents (50 % males; mean age =  14. 1 ± 0. 6 years) completed a questionnaire and wore an accelerometer for ≥ 3 school days. Time spent engaged in sedentary, light (LPA) and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) during school <b>break</b> <b>times</b> (recess and lunchtime) were calculated using existing cut-points. Measures were repeated in 2008 among 111 adolescents. Multilevel models examined cross-sectional and longitudinal associations.
