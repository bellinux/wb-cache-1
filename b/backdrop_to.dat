5|$|A stage play {{based on}} the disaster, by the {{journalist}} and broadcaster Margaret Coles, was first performed at the Sherman Cymru, Cardiff in 1991. The disaster at Senghenydd has provided the <b>backdrop</b> <b>to</b> two printed works of historical fiction: Alexander Cordell's This Sweet and Bitter Earth (1977) and Cwmwl dros y Cwm (2013) by Gareth F Williams.|$|E
5|$|Following {{closely in}} the {{footsteps}} of Sir Walter Scott, the novel uses its truthful historical <b>backdrop</b> <b>to</b> tell a fictional story of people who sculpted the past. The novel addresses themes of passionate love, vengeful trickery, and social status. While it is disdained by critics in favor of Balzac's later work, the novel marks a turning point in his life and artistry.|$|E
5|$|Frome's Cheap Street is a {{location}} in episode {{six of the}} first series of BBC TV comedy The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin. Frome has also provided the <b>backdrop</b> <b>to</b> historical dramas, such as Poldark, broadcast in 2016 which has regular scenes shot in Gentle Street, and Drover's Gold, filmed by BBC Wales in 1996.|$|E

5|$|Seacoal – a film made by Amber Films in 1985. The {{station is}} {{features}} heavily {{as a backdrop}} in the beach scenes, where the characters are working, collecting seacoal. Photographer Mik Critchlow (who would later become involved with Amber Films' sister company Side Gallery) also documented the seacoalers at Lynemouth, between 1981 and 1983. He also used the power station as an industrial <b>backdrop</b> <b>to</b> some of his images.|$|E
5|$|The 1975 {{tour with}} the Revue {{provided}} the <b>backdrop</b> <b>to</b> Dylan's nearly four-hour film Renaldo and Clara, a sprawling narrative mixed with concert footage and reminiscences. Released in 1978, the movie received poor, sometimes scathing, reviews. Later in that year, a two-hour edit, {{dominated by the}} concert performances, was more widely released.|$|E
5|$|Between 1990 and 2011, when Apocalypse {{was known}} as Iron Wolf, there was no theme for the roller coaster. After its {{relocation}} to Six Flags America, to match the new name of the coaster, an {{end of the world}} apocalypse theme was added with fire, crashed planes and zombies located in the queue line and along the layout of the roller coaster. As guests go further in the queue line to the end at the station, it mimics an end of the world apocalypse scenario. The skull from Skull Mountain also serves as a <b>backdrop</b> <b>to</b> the ride.|$|E
5000|$|In 1989, Bellows {{purchased}} a large building in midtown Omaha that he christened the Mahler Building, after the composer Gustav Mahler. Once {{home to the}} Mermaid Lounge, Bellows renovated the building and used it as his studio, with space to build large sets <b>to</b> use as <b>backdrops</b> <b>to</b> his artwork. Regarding the design and creation of actual sets as <b>backdrops</b> <b>to</b> his work, he remarked, “It’s a real little bit of Hollywood, the way I work.” [...] In 1992, Bellows also described his art as “little movies that don’t move…I try to make art that is really part of me, that there is just no question about it. I get that from a Bergman film. I get that from Scorsese. I get that from David Lynch.” ...|$|R
50|$|Backdrop CMS's {{philosophy}} {{is focused on}} providing an affordable yet comprehensive CMS for small to medium-sized businesses, non-profits, educational institutions, and other organizations. Because Backdrop CMS {{is very similar to}} Drupal 7, a module that was written for Drupal 7 can be ported <b>to</b> <b>Backdrop</b> CMS far more quickly than to Drupal 8. There is also a built-in upgrade path from Drupal 7 <b>to</b> <b>Backdrop</b> CMS. It should be more affordable to upgrade an existing Drupal 7 site <b>to</b> <b>Backdrop</b> than <b>to</b> migrate it to Drupal 8.|$|R
50|$|Survivors series. Balog {{tried to}} change people’s {{perception}} of endangered wildlife by altering {{the context in which}} the animals were viewed. Instead of capturing his subjects in nature with a telephoto lens, he photographed them in non-natural settings, often against white <b>backdrops,</b> <b>to</b> emphasize their vulnerability.|$|R
5|$|Ion Agârbiceanu (September 12, 1882 – May 28, 1963) was an Austro-Hungarian-born Romanian writer, journalist, politician, theologian and Greek-Catholic priest. A {{native of}} Transylvania, he {{graduated}} from Budapest University, after which he was ordained. He was initially assigned to a parish in the Apuseni Mountains, which form the <b>backdrop</b> <b>to</b> much of his fiction. Before 1910, Agârbiceanu had achieved literary fame in both Transylvania and the Kingdom of Romania; his work was disputed between the rival schools of Sămănătorul and Poporanism.|$|E
5|$|Satyajit Ray's ancestry can {{be traced}} back for at least ten generations. Ray's grandfather, Upendrakishore Ray was a writer, illustrator, philosopher, publisher, amateur {{astronomer}} and a leader of the Brahmo Samaj, a religious and social movement in nineteenth century Bengal. He also set up a printing press by the name of U. Ray and Sons, which formed a crucial <b>backdrop</b> <b>to</b> Satyajit's life. Sukumar Ray, Upendrakishore's son and father of Satyajit, was a pioneering Bengali writer of nonsense rhyme (abol tabol) and children's literature, an illustrator and a critic. Ray was born to Sukumar and Suprabha Ray in Calcutta.|$|E
5|$|The parish {{church of}} St. James is also {{located near the}} centre of Taunton quite close to St. Mary Magdalene. The oldest parts of St. James Church are early 14th-century, and there are {{fragments}} of 15th-century glass in the west end. Like St. Mary's {{it also has a}} sandstone tower but built to a much less impressive design. The tower was also, like St. Mary's, rebuilt in the 19th century– in this case thought to be due to building defects in the original tower. The church backs onto the County Ground and forms a familiar <b>backdrop</b> <b>to</b> the popular cricket ground.|$|E
50|$|It {{also runs}} events in tourist attractions around Donegal itself. Drive-in movies at Downings Beach and at Ards Forest Park have been sell-outs {{in past years}} and the natural {{landscape}} of Glenveagh, Earagail, the Muckish and Aghla mountains, Tory Island and Magheraroarty Beach all form regular <b>backdrops</b> <b>to</b> the festival programme.|$|R
50|$|Musically, {{military}} bands perform marches. The corps style {{can incorporate}} any or multiple styles {{of music to}} fit the theme of their show. Corps style bands can utilize props and <b>backdrops</b> <b>to</b> enhance the theatrical quality of their show, whereas military bands generally don't have a theme for their shows.|$|R
50|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 1980s, Kinmonth {{returned}} to painting. His canvasses were exhibited by Richard Demarco Gallery at the International Contemporary Art Fair at Olympia and were used by Jasper Conran as scenic <b>backdrops</b> <b>to</b> complement his costume designs for David Bintley's one-act ballet Tombeaux for The Royal Ballet (1993).|$|R
5|$|As one of {{the most}} {{successful}} teams in the country, Arsenal have often featured when football is depicted in the arts in Britain. They formed the <b>backdrop</b> <b>to</b> {{one of the}} earliest football-related novels, The Arsenal Stadium Mystery (1939), which was made into a film in the same year. The story centres on a friendly match between Arsenal and an amateur side, one of whose players is poisoned while playing. Many Arsenal players appeared as themselves in the film and manager George Allison was given a speaking part. More recently, the book Fever Pitch by Nick Hornby was an autobiographical account of Hornby's life and relationship with football and Arsenal in particular. Published in 1992, it formed part of the revival and rehabilitation of football in British society during the 1990s. The book was twice adapted for the cinema– the 1997 British film focuses on Arsenal's 1988–89 title win, and a 2005 American version features a fan of baseball's Boston Red Sox.|$|E
5|$|Criticism of {{the film}} also appeared, mostly from academia rather than the popular press. Horowitz points out {{that much of the}} Jewish {{activity}} seen in the ghetto consists of financial transactions such as lending money, trading on the black market, or hiding wealth, thus perpetuating a stereotypical view of Jewish life. Horowitz notes that while the depiction of women in the film accurately reflects Nazi ideology, the low status of women and the link between violence and sexuality is not explored further. History professor Omer Bartov of Brown University notes that the physically large and strongly drawn characters of Schindler and Göth overshadow the Jewish victims, who are depicted as small, scurrying, and frightened – a mere <b>backdrop</b> <b>to</b> the struggle of good versus evil.|$|E
5|$|On 3 November 2004, Jagannadh met Mahesh Babu at the Taj Hotel in Hyderbad {{to outline}} the film's plot. It {{told the story}} of Uttam Singh, an {{undercover}} police officer, infiltrating a mafia gang as a criminal, with the intention of killing its kingpin. Mahesh liked the script but suggested Jagannadh tweak the script's <b>backdrop</b> <b>to</b> suit the Telugu-speaking peoples' sensibilities. Jagannadh agreed and also replaced the existing title with Pokiri. Mahesh wanted the film's production to begin in 2005 allowing him to complete his current commitments. While he waited for Mahesh, Jagannadh directed Akkineni Nagarjuna in Super (2005). While reworking the script, Jagannadh took inspiration from Marana Mrudangam (1988) and State Rowdy (1989). Pokiri was produced jointly by Jagannadh and Manjula Ghattamaneni's production companies, Vaishno Academy and Indira Productions respectively, on a budget of 100120 million.|$|E

5000|$|Elements {{of popular}} culture that appear as <b>backdrops</b> <b>to</b> the main story include the song [...] "If I Were a Rich Man" [...] from Fiddler on the Roof; a {{recorded}} orchestral performance of The Beatles' song [...] "Yesterday"; The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson; the theme music of the television series Ben Casey; and televised boxing matches.|$|R
5|$|The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr., {{was filmed}} {{primarily}} on the Warner Bros. soundstages. Town and street scenes were staged on the Western backlot, known as Laramie Street. It {{was one of the}} last Western shows to use the backlot. Cuse said that logistics were a problem because so many of the Hollywood Western sets and towns had been torn down by the 1990s. Outdoor scenes were shot on the Warner Bros. ranch in Valencia, California; Bronson Canyon in Los Angeles; and the Valuze Ranch in Santa Clarita, California. Some of the locomotive scenes from Brisco were filmed on location at Railtown 1897 State Historic Park in Jamestown, California. A painting used in the show as a <b>backdrop</b> <b>to</b> create illusions of greater depth perspectives is exhibited at the park.|$|E
5|$|The Clifton Bridge Company {{initially}} {{managed the}} bridge under licence from a charitable trust. The trust subsequently purchased the company shares, completing this in 1949 {{and took over}} {{the running of the}} bridge using the income from tolls to pay for maintenance. The bridge is a distinctive landmark, used as a symbol of Bristol on postcards, promotional materials, and informational web sites. It was also used as a <b>backdrop</b> <b>to</b> several films and television advertising and programmes. It has also been the venue for significant cultural events such as the first modern bungee jump in 1979, the last ever Concorde flight in 2003 and a handover of the Olympic Torch relay in 2012.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of the crashed plane, in which Hank discovers a dead pilot and the $4.4 million in cash, was filmed on a soundstage. A second plane, designed to have frosted windows, was attached to a gimbal, about five feet off the ground. To match the interior with footage shot in Wisconsin, the art department built a set with real trees and a painted <b>backdrop.</b> <b>To</b> depict Hank being attacked by a flock of crows inside the plane, puppets were used to attack Paxton as he appeared on screen, while two live crows were used to attack an animatronic replica of the actor. A separate soundstage was used to create two sets depicting the interiors of the Mitchell home, where Hank and his wife Sarah (Fonda) reside. The first set was the main floor an exterior entrance way, and the second was created for the upstairs bedrooms. Principal photography concluded on March 13, 1998, after 55 days of filming.|$|E
2500|$|Buddhist {{imagery is}} {{increasingly}} appropriated by modern pop culture {{and also for}} commercial use. For example, the Dalai Lama's image was used in a campaign celebrating leadership by Apple Computer.

[...] Hollywood movies such as Kundun, Little Buddha and Seven Years in Tibet have had considerable commercial success.|$|R
50|$|Different {{locations}} at The Pope {{have been}} used for <b>backdrops</b> <b>to</b> various scenes for film and television. The pool has been used to film scenes for the movie Across the Universe (2007) and the HBO comedy series Flight of the Conchords.

5|$|The costliest war in U.S. {{history in}} terms of American life, this war {{has been the subject}} of, or the <b>backdrop</b> <b>to,</b> {{numerous}} films, documentaries and mini-series. One of the earliest films using the Civil War as its subject was D.W. Griffith's 1910 silent picture, The Fugitive. Films that have the war as its main subject, or about a certain aspect of the war include the 1989 film, Glory, about the first formal unit of the Union Army during the American Civil War to be made up entirely of black men. Some films such as Gettysburg focused on a single battle during the war, or even on a single incident, like the French short film, La Rivière du Hibou (An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge). Others like the 1993 miniseries North and South spanned the entire breadth of the war. Some films deal with the human aspects of the war, such as The Red Badge of Courage (1951), or Shenandoah (1965), on the tragedy that the war inflicted on the civilian population. Ken Burns's The Civil War is the most watched documentary in the history of PBS.|$|E

5000|$|Penn {{was among}} the first photographers to pose {{subjects}} against a simple grey or white backdrop and he effectively used this simplicity. [...] Expanding his austere studio surroundings, Penn constructed a set of upright angled <b>backdrops,</b> <b>to</b> form a stark, acute corner.
