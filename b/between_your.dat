5|$|I {{actually}} wrote a {{song about}} it on my album, it's called 'GUY' and it stands for 'Go Under You'. So wearing make-up, smelling delicious and having suckable, kissable, edible things <b>between</b> <b>your</b> limbs is something I find strengthening because I know that when I pick the right guy, I can let him have it. Some women feel oppressed by make-up and clothing, and here’s to them, they {{have every right to}} feel that way as well.|$|E
5|$|I never agreed, {{even as a}} young person, {{with the}} Thomas Wolfe title You Can't Go Home Again. Instinctively I didn’t. But the truth is, you can never leave home. You take it with you; it’s under your fingernails; it’s in the hair follicles; it’s {{in the way you}} smile; it’s in the ride of your hips, in the passage of your breasts; it’s all there, no matter where you go. You can take on the affectations and the postures of other places and even learn to speak their ways. But the truth is, home is <b>between</b> <b>your</b> teeth.|$|E
25|$|When {{different}} {{materials are}} brought {{together and then}} separated, an accumulation of electric charge can occur which leaves one material positively charged while the other becomes negatively charged. The mild shock that you receive when touching a grounded object after walking on carpet {{is an example of}} excess electrical charge accumulating in your body from frictional charging <b>between</b> <b>your</b> shoes and the carpet. The resulting charge build-up upon your body can generate a strong electrical discharge. Although experimenting with static electricity may be fun, similar sparks create severe hazards in those industries dealing with flammable substances, where a small electrical spark may ignite explosive mixtures with devastating consequences.|$|E

500|$|The scriptural texts for tefillin are obscure in literal meaning. For example, Deuteronomy 11:18 {{is one of}} the {{standard}} texts referenced as supporting the obligation, but does not designate what specifically to [...] "bind upon your arm," [...] and the definition of totafot <b>between</b> <b>your</b> eyes is not obvious. It is the Talmud, the authoritative oral tradition for Rabbinic Judaism, which explains what are to be bound to the body and the form of tefillin.|$|E

500|$|As David remarked in this section, her {{approach}} to measuring out ingredients {{had changed since}} her early days: [...] "By temperament a non-measurer, I have myself, first through the wish to communicate recipes and now by force of habit, become the reverse. I find that the discipline of weighing and measuring does one's cooking nothing but good, provided that one does not waste time messing about with quarter-saltspoons and five-eighths of pints, nor, above all, expect that precision will eliminate the necessity to keep one's head or train one's eye and palate." [...] The author does not conceal her dislike for some much-used herbs: sage [...] "deadens the food with its musty dried blood scent" [...] and rosemary [...] "acrid taste … the spiky little leaves get stuck <b>between</b> <b>your</b> teeth." ...|$|E
500|$|In March 1941, Vasey was {{promoted}} to temporary brigadier and took command of the 6th Division's 19th Infantry Brigade following the departure of Horace Robertson to Australia on medical grounds. He led it in Greece, suffering a defeat at the Battle of Vevi. Vasey's instructions to his men were couched in typical Vasey terms: [...] "Here you bloody well are and here you bloody well stay. And if any bloody German gets <b>between</b> <b>your</b> post and the next, turn your bloody bren around and shoot him up the arse." [...] The 19th Infantry Brigade was evacuated to Crete, where it fought in the Battle of Crete. Vasey was commended {{for his work in}} Crete and was among the last to be evacuated to Egypt, but some 3,000 Australians were taken prisoner. Although it was a bitter defeat, Vasey's performance was considered outstanding; he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE), awarded a Bar to his DSO, and later the Greek War Cross.|$|E

500|$|Finally, a Bedouin story {{states that}} Allah created the Arabian horse {{from the south}} wind and exclaimed, [...] "I create thee, Oh Arabian. To thy forelock, I bind Victory in battle. On thy back, I set a rich spoil and a Treasure in thy loins. I {{establish}} thee {{as one of the}} Glories of the Earth... I give thee flight without wings." [...] Other versions of the story claim Allah said to the South Wind: [...] "I want to make a creature out of you. Condense." [...] Then from the material condensed from the wind, he made a kamayt-colored animal (a bay or burnt chestnut) and said: [...] "I call you Horse; I make you Arabian and I give you the chestnut color of the ant; I have hung happiness from the forelock which hangs <b>between</b> <b>your</b> eyes; you shall be the Lord of the other animals. Men shall follow you wherever you go; you shall be as good for flight as for pursuit; you shall fly without wings; riches shall be on your back and fortune shall come through your meditation." ...|$|E
500|$|Co-written by D'Angelo and {{producer}} Raphael Saadiq, [...] "Untitled (How Does It Feel)" [...] features sexually-explicit lyrics that follow and narrate a man's plea to his love interest for sex, {{as demonstrated in}} the song's second verse: [...] "Love to make you wet / In <b>between</b> <b>your</b> thighs, cause / I love when it comes inside of you / I get so excited when I'm around you, baby". The song's lyrics {{have been described as}} [...] "generic pop lyrics". Music critic Andy Peterson described the lyrics as [...] "not–so–subtle", citing the line [...] "Baby close the door / Listen girl, I have something I wanna show you / I wish you’d open up cause I wanna take the walls down with you" [...] as an example. Music journalist Greg Levine cited its lyrics as [...] "the generic pop lyrics", while also noting the similarity the lyrics have to those of other classic soul ballads, stating [...] "Each line seems to be directly lifted from Marvin Gaye, Prince, or Curtis Mayfield."

500|$|Co-written by Raphael Saadiq, [...] "Untitled (How Does It Feel)" [...] is {{a tribute}} to one of D'Angelo's primary influences, Prince, and evokes his early [...] The {{similarity}} of D'Angelo's music on Voodoo to Prince was addressed in Saul Williams's liner notes, as he stated [...] "I'd pay to see Prince's face as he listens to this album." [...] Questlove described the song as [...] "finding the line between parody and honesty [...] In an era of 'the cover song', redoing a Prince song was taboo. This is the second best thing". It follows a six eight signature and features electric guitar interplay throughout, which is reminiscent of the Jimi Hendrix guitar style and [...] "Maggot Brain" [...] sound. The song contains a drum pattern with a uniform dynamic. D'Angelo's vocals were overdubbed several times to produce the sound of a choir singing harmonies during choruses, all of which were sung by D'Angelo. The song's sexually explicit lyrics describe the narrator's plea to his lover for sex, as exemplified in the second verse: [...] "Love to make you wet/In <b>between</b> <b>your</b> thighs, cause/I love when it comes inside of you/I get so excited when I'm around you, baby" [...] It has been cited by critics as the album's best song.|$|E
