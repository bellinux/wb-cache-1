5|$|In 2015 {{the album}} was reissued, {{initially}} on vinyl record and a CD re-release in March, followed by a lossless digital release. Originally the band had planned on releasing a new studio album in March 2015, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not due to bassist Kusakari's pregnancy.|$|E
5|$|Nelson {{began to}} develop severe stomach pains, but refused to see a doctor. He distrusted them because his {{brother-in-law}} had died after having a pacemaker installed. It was speculated among friends that the pains were from cancer, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> have been an acid condition.|$|E
5|$|There are cables with A plugs on both ends, {{which may}} be valid if the cable includes, for example, a USB host-to-host {{transfer}} device with 2 ports, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> also be non-standard and erroneous and should be used carefully.|$|E

60|$|The {{girls were}} silent a while, seriously {{considering}} this startling assertion. They had, between them, considerable money, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> realized <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not enter {{a field that}} required such an enormous investment as film making.|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> before <b>they</b> <b>could</b> move {{to do her}} bidding, Garnache's voice rang imperatively {{through the}} chamber.|$|R
5|$|Ali Aaltonen was {{replaced}} by Eero Haapalainen. He in turn was displaced by the Eino Rahja, Adolf Taimi and Evert Eloranta triumvirate. The last Red Guard commander in chief was Kullervo Manner. Some talented men with a high sense of responsibility such as Hugo Salmela in Tampere rose up to take the lead, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not {{change the course of}} the war. The Reds achieved some local victories, as they retreated from southern Finland toward Russia, e.g. against German troops in the fierce Battle of Syrjäntaka on 28–29 April in Tuulos.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1900s, {{the success of}} deep-bore {{electric}} trains on the Underground suggested that local services out of London could also be electrified. Following the war, the GER needed more capacity out of Liverpool Street as it was at capacity (serving almost 230,000 passengers daily in 1921), <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not afford electrification. They considered high powered and high tractive steam locomotives including the GER Class A55 as a possible alternative, but these were rejected because of high track loadings.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Posada was {{a turning}} point in Hungarian-Wallachian relations: though {{in the course of the}} 14th century, the kings of Hungary still tried to {{regulate}} the voivodes of Wallachia more than one time, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> only succeed temporarily. Thus Basarab's victory irretrievably opened the way to independence for the Principality of Wallachia.|$|E
60|$|Andy was right, <b>but</b> before <b>they</b> <b>could</b> {{reach his}} bearship, the animal scented them and hobbled away.|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> before <b>they</b> <b>could</b> {{come up to}} the {{schooner}} {{she disappeared}} around a headland of the island.|$|R

5|$|The song {{at the end}} of the show, {{written by}} Ken Keeler, is a parody of various Bond themes. Keeler {{originally}} wrote it to be three seconds longer and sound more like the Goldfinger theme, but the final version was shorter and the lyrics were sped up. The writers wanted the song to be sung by Shirley Bassey, who sang several Bond themes, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not get her to record the part.|$|E
5|$|The station {{also has}} six gas {{turbines}} providing backup for breakdowns, or shut downs in the National Grid. Their annual output is generally low, generating 75MW {{and three of}} the units have been mothballed and are out of operation, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> be refurbished. Emissions from these units are released through the station's second, smaller chimney, to the south of the main stack.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the terms}} of the Washington Naval Treaty, Italy was {{permitted}} to retain Regina Elena and her three sisters. The Italian Navy could have kept the ships in service indefinitely, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not be replaced by new battleships under the normal practice of the Treaty system. Nevertheless, she was stricken from the naval register on 16 February 1923 and subsequently broken up for scrap.|$|E

60|$|Both {{sprang up}} hastily, <b>but</b> ere <b>they</b> <b>could</b> make {{any attempt to}} escape the skipper and mate emerged from the {{companion}} and walked towards them.|$|R
60|$|Then all of {{the party}} struck out to reach the landing-place without delay. They felt that {{something}} unusual had occurred, <b>but</b> what, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not surmise.|$|R
5|$|After their {{conquest of}} Pasir Panjang Ridge, the Japanese {{proceeded}} to march towards {{the city of}} Singapore for their final decisive thrust against remaining Allied forces there. Perched on a hill (near present Keppel Country Club) along Pasir Panjang Road, the escaped Malay and British soldiers had gathered together and waited patiently to ambush the Japanese convoy heading towards the city. Using mounted Bofors guns, they let loose deluge of gunshots causing the Japanese to scramble for cover. The Japanese tanks attempted to move forward to engage the enemy <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not advance due to the sea of dead and wounded bodies blocking its way. About 100 Japanese soldiers were killed during the ambush before the Anglo-Malay force retreated {{to the city to}} join their fellow men for their final stand against the Japanese.|$|E
5|$|Although {{late and}} over-budget the {{decision}} to cancel the MRA4 was controversial as the remaining airframes had all been near completion. It {{has been reported that}} following the retirement of the Nimrod MR2 (in March 2010.), Russian submarines have been able to travel past the UK in international waters, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not be tracked {{because of the lack of}} suitable aircraft. In November and early December 2014 four maritime patrol aircraft operated by France, Canada and the United States were based at RAF Lossiemouth to attempt to locate a Russian submarine which had been spotted in British territorial waters off west Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Commanded by Captain Roderick Dew, {{the ship}} was {{initially}} assigned to the Channel Fleet where she spent three months as temporary flagship before she {{was transferred to the}} Mediterranean in 1868. Lord Clyde made one cruise with the Mediterranean Fleet during which she fractured her steel mainyard in a squall. Her engines continued to deteriorate and they were condemned as no longer safe to use by the fleet engineer when she arrived in Naples. The ship was sent to the Malta Dockyard under sail for repair, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> only make temporary repairs that would enable her to reach home.|$|E

6000|$|Although {{this was}} {{strictly}} true, the Cormorants {{had never heard}} of it; <b>but,</b> before <b>they</b> <b>could</b> answer, a loud, deep voice cried; [...] "Heigho! What is all that?" ...|$|R

5|$|Deities {{were present}} {{not only in}} the heavens, but also in the human body itself. They were {{responsible}} for maintaining the body's five viscera, guarding the registers of life, and regulating the souls. There were five internal deities that were particularly important in Lingbao Daoism. The Great Unity lived in the head, along with Lordling and White Prime, who could descend into the liver and lungs. The Director of Destinies lived in the heart and sexual organs, and finally, the Peach Child lived in the lower dantian. Normally these deities resided in the heavens, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> be activated by scriptural recitations to descend into the body.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} years of the show, the staff was forced by the Fox network into doing clip shows to save money. There was {{originally}} intense pressure on the producers of the show to create extra episodes in each season, and the plan was to make four clip shows per season to meet that limit. Writers and producers, however, felt that this many clip shows would alienate fans of the series. The Fox network's reasoning was that clip shows cost half of what a normal episode costs to produce, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> sell syndication rights at full price.|$|E
5|$|Four of {{the twelve}} LCPRs had been damaged. Three were soon repaired, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not be risked further, for without them, the {{reconnaissance}} force could not be evacuated. The emergency plan provided for an APD to enter the harbour and take troops off from a jetty but this would clearly be a desperate measure indeed. Over the next four hours, the boats continued to make trips to the beach, but only when it was believed destroyers had suppressed enemy fire. Heavy rain made it safer by reducing visibility. The last destroyer was unloaded at 12:50. By this time, the navy had lost two men dead and three wounded.|$|E

5|$|Four {{wins and}} a draw {{at home to}} Basel placed Barcelona {{on top of their}} group with a game to spare, and despite defeat to Shakhtar Donetsk on Matchday 6, they still had the third-best record amongst the qualifiers for the first {{knockout}} round. As group winners, Barcelona would avoid being drawn with other group winners, including Manchester United, Liverpool, Juventus and Bayern Munich, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> still be drawn against runners-up such as Chelsea, Internazionale and Arsenal. The draw eventually paired them with Olympique Lyonnais and, as group winners, they were given the right to play the second leg at home.|$|E
5|$|Rural {{families}} that sold a large agricultural surplus {{to the market}} not only could afford to buy more charcoal, tea, oil, and wine, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> also amass enough funds to establish secondary means of production for generating more wealth. Besides necessary agricultural foodstuffs, farming families could often produce wine, charcoal, paper, textiles, and other goods they sold through brokers. Farmers in Suzhou often specialized in raising bombyx mori to produce silk wares, while in Fujian, Sichuan, and Guangdong farmers often grew sugarcane. In order to ensure the prosperity of rural areas, technical applications for public works projects and improved agricultural techniques were essential. The vast irrigation system of China had to be furnished with multitudes of wheelwrights mass-producing standardized waterwheels and square-pallet chain pumps that could lift water from lower planes to higher irrigation planes.|$|E
5|$|The English army {{consisted}} {{entirely of}} infantry. It {{is possible that}} some of the higher class members of the army rode to battle, but when battle was joined they dismounted to fight on foot. The core of the army was made up of housecarls, full-time professional soldiers. Their armour consisted of a conical helmet, a mail hauberk, and a shield, which might be either kite-shaped or round. Most housecarls fought with the two-handed Danish battleaxe, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> also carry a sword. The rest of the army was made up of levies from the fyrd, also infantry but more lightly armoured and not professionals. Most of the infantry would have formed part of the shield wall, in which all the men in the front ranks locked their shields together. Behind them would have been axemen and men with javelins as well as archers.|$|E
