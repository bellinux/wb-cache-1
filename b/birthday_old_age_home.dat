40|$|This study {{explored}} age-cohort {{differences on}} attitudes and intention toward <b>old</b> <b>age</b> <b>home</b> placement among 186 young, 161 middle-aged, and 185 older Chinese in Hong Kong, who voluntarily {{participated in this}} questionnaire survey without monetary reward. Compared to young adults and middle-aged Chinese, older Chinese {{were more likely to}} view <b>old</b> <b>age</b> <b>homes</b> positively, to adhere to traditional filial obligations, and to endorse beliefs about individual independence. Middle-aged Chinese reported greater intention, as compared to young adult Chinese, to refer older people to <b>old</b> <b>age</b> <b>homes.</b> Favorable attitudes toward <b>old</b> <b>age</b> <b>homes</b> were the most significant predictor of acceptance of <b>old</b> <b>age</b> <b>home</b> placement in each cohort. Among young Chinese adults, beliefs about independence and positive attitudes toward older people also significantly accounted for intention to refer older family members to <b>old</b> <b>age</b> <b>home</b> care. The findings suggest that <b>old</b> <b>age</b> <b>home</b> placement is not associated with unfilial thinking in contemporary Chinese society. Limitation and implications of the study were also discussed. © Springer Science + Business Media, LLC 2009. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Background: This study {{presents}} an alternative assessment method for establishing {{the demand for}} an <b>old</b> <b>age</b> <b>home</b> among a community-dwelling older population. The instrument, called 'orientation towards admission into an <b>old</b> <b>age</b> home', represents {{the intensity of the}} need for admission as expressed by older people themselves. Therefore it is indicative of the 'subjective demand'. Methods: Using a longitudinal design (1993 - 98), the study tests whether a stronger orientation towards admission into an <b>old</b> <b>age</b> <b>home</b> leads to use of an <b>old</b> <b>age</b> <b>home.</b> This assessment method is compared with another method of assessing 'subjective demand', that is by those who have applied for and are waiting for admission. Additionally, the method is compared with an 'objective' indicator of demand, that is, the level of physical impairments and age of the elderly person. Results: Results show that the subjective demand as measured by the 'orientation toward admission into an <b>old</b> <b>age</b> home' is indeed related to actual use of an <b>old</b> <b>age</b> <b>home.</b> The subjective demand as measured by being on a waiting list is not significantly related to the use of an <b>old</b> <b>age</b> <b>home.</b> The level of physical impairments (the objective demand) and age are sometimes, but not always, significantly related to the use of an <b>old</b> <b>age</b> <b>home.</b> Conclusion: The instrument 'orientation' provides us with a valuable instrument in assessing 'subjective demand' for an <b>old</b> <b>age</b> <b>home</b> among community-dwelling <b>older</b> people. ...|$|R

40|$|Aims and Objectives: To {{study and}} compare the {{perception}} of <b>old</b> <b>age</b> and self in elderly women living in community and in <b>old</b> <b>age</b> <b>homes.</b> Materials and Methods: By using a cross sectional study design 60 elderly females (30 each from community and <b>old</b> <b>age</b> <b>homes)</b> were assessed using a semi-structured proforma and an interview questionnaire. Data was qualitatively analysed and frequency computation was done. Results: The elderly women living in community had more of an attitude of ′acceptance′ towards <b>old</b> <b>age</b> and ′generativity′ {{was a part of}} ageing for them. They were found to be more satisfied with life and had better emotional support, whereas elderly in <b>old</b> <b>age</b> <b>home</b> perceived better instrumental support. Conclusion: Both community living and living in an <b>old</b> <b>age</b> <b>home,</b> have certain positive aspects. From a perspective of future policies and outreach services, {{it would be interesting to}} note the same and use best of both the worlds to provide the best for the elder in either setting...|$|R

40|$|Life {{satisfaction}} {{among the}} elderly has become an important issue in geriatric care. Change in life styles, demanding jobs, a shift to nuclear family structures have led to increased neglect of the elderly by families and community. The study was conducted on life satisfaction level of male (n= 50) and females (n= 60) geriatrics staying in selected <b>old</b> <b>age</b> <b>home.</b> The findings revealed that the life satisfaction level was high and satisfactory in female <b>old</b> <b>age</b> populations in comparison to males geriatrics staying in <b>old</b> <b>age</b> <b>home</b> {{and there is a}} significant difference in life satisfaction level between male and female geriatrics living in selected <b>old</b> <b>age</b> <b>home...</b>|$|R
40|$|As yet the {{determinants}} {{of the need for}} nursing <b>homes</b> and <b>old</b> <b>age</b> <b>homes</b> are not clearly understood. This {{may be due to the}} fact that care facilities providing different levels of care may yield different predictors of use. Moreover! the absence of theory and ignorance of the problems with 'use' as the dependent variable, may be responsible for this. In this study these issues are addressed explicitly. The study focuses on the need for living in an <b>old</b> <b>age</b> <b>home</b> and a theoretical model predicts under what circumstances frail elderly people will express the need for living in such a home. Findings show that, as hypothesised, loss of comfort and affection are among the main predictors of a strong orientation towards living in an <b>old</b> <b>age</b> <b>home.</b> Resources to counter the loss of comfort and affection - a spouse, income, home adaptations, private help, informal and formal home care - were. only partly effective in their hypothesised function of deterring orientation towards living in an <b>old</b> <b>age</b> <b>home.</b> Pressure from others to apply for an <b>old</b> <b>age</b> <b>home</b> had the strongest effect.

40|$|D. Cur. Limited {{funds for}} the {{delivering}} of health and social services necessitate the cost-effective utilization of all categories of nursing personnel in <b>old</b> <b>age</b> <b>homes.</b> Professional nurses are being retrenched and supervision over weekends and after hours is being scaled down {{due to a lack}} of guidelines for the cost-effective utilization of nursing personnel in <b>old</b> <b>age</b> <b>homes.</b> A combined quantitative-qualitative approach had been applied in this empirical study to explore and describe the utilization of nursing personnel in <b>old</b> <b>age</b> <b>homes.</b> The goal of the study was to compile guidelines for the cost-effective utilization of nursing personnel in <b>old</b> <b>age</b> <b>homes.</b> Data collection and data analysis were conducted during three phases. A survey of the population of <b>old</b> <b>age</b> <b>homes</b> in South Africa was first conducted to determine the composition of the residents and nursing personnel in these <b>old</b> <b>age</b> <b>homes</b> and to explore the cost implications of the personnel composition. The contents of job descriptions of professional nurses working in <b>old</b> <b>age</b> <b>homes</b> were analysed on a computer by the researcher using NUDtIST software during the second phase of the study. The third phase consisted of conducting and analysing focus groups with professional nurses regarding. their expectations of their own duties, tasks and responsibilities and those of nursing auxiliaries and lay caregivers in <b>old</b> <b>age</b> <b>homes.</b> The three phases were conducted simultaneously and the results of the three phases were triangulated and subjected to a limited literature control. The results were verified during visits to nursing homes in the USA, Canada and the UK. A conceptual framework and guidelines for the cost-effective utilization of nursing personnel in <b>old</b> <b>age</b> <b>homes</b> were developed from the findings of this study. Respondents from the first phase of the study and experts verified the guidelines for being applicable, important, clear and accessible. The findings indicated that most of the residents of the <b>old</b> <b>age</b> <b>homes</b> are very <b>old</b> and are in need of 24 hours nursing/care due to their level of frailty. The nursing personnel budget forms a significant portion of the operating budget of the <b>old</b> <b>age</b> <b>homes</b> and managers are of the opinion that professional nurses are expensive but an essential component of the nursing personnel. The duties, tasks and responsibilities of professional nurses were identified as well as those which are shared with nursing auxiliaries and lay caregivers in <b>old</b> <b>age</b> <b>homes.</b> The conceptual framework which was established from the results of the study indicates that the goal, costeffective utilization of nursing personnel, is reached when quality care has been delivered within the constraints of the budget limitations. The process has been described as the compiling of guidelines for all categories of nursing personnel regarding clinical nursing, nursing management and nursing education as well as the handling of non nursing tasks while considering the personnel standards and job descriptions. The role players are the manager, all categories of nursing personnel, lay caregivers, family and volunteers which perform within the restrictions of the personnel composition and the appropriate code of conduct regulations. The context for the utilization of nursing personnel is the <b>old</b> <b>age</b> <b>home</b> where nursing/care giving is delivered on a continuum and the dynamics which influence the cost-effective utilization of nursing personnel include applicable legislation and policies of government departments and non government organizations...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{project is the}} first phase of a larger study aimed at describing and exploring the cost-effective utilisation of nursing personnel in <b>old</b> <b>age</b> <b>homes</b> in South Africa. The aim in the first phase was to describe the composition of the residents and nursing personnel of <b>old</b> <b>age</b> <b>homes</b> in South Africa. An exploratory and descriptive survey was conducted and the data was collected by means of a questionnaire. The questionnaire also included data on the financial implications of utilising professional nursing personnel to manage the care of the frail residents/older persons in <b>old</b> <b>age</b> <b>homes</b> in South Africa. The questionnaires were mailed to 612 <b>old</b> <b>age</b> <b>homes</b> published in the Hospital and Nursing Yearbook of 1997 (100 % sample). A total of 145 (23. 69 %) questionnaires were returned and included in the descriptive data analysis. The residents are mainly female (77 %), older than 85 years of age, belong to the white race group (83, 74 %) and are highly dependent on nursing care and supervision (69, 7 %). <b>Old</b> <b>age</b> <b>homes</b> are mainly managed/ controlled by welfare organisations and lay health care workers are utilised to a large extent (42, 22 % of the nursing workforce) to render nursing care to the frail residents.

40|$|Key Messages: 1. Among 1600 cognitively normal elderly persons {{living in}} <b>old</b> <b>age</b> <b>homes</b> in Hong Kong, 88 % {{preferred}} palliative treatments that could keep them comfortable and free from pain, and 88 % {{agreed to have}} advance directives. Factors that favour having advance directives among Chinese elders included the practice of asking for relatives’ advice in medical decisions, wishing to be informed of their terminal illness diagnoses, absence of a stroke history, and having no problems in self-care. 2. Approximately one third of <b>old</b> <b>age</b> <b>home</b> residents would accept dying in place. Older age, religion (Catholic or non-believer of traditional Chinese religion), having a better mood score (Geriatric Depression Scale), having no siblings, not receiving an <b>old</b> <b>age</b> allowance, and being a resident of subvented <b>old</b> <b>age</b> <b>homes</b> were independent predictors of preference for community end-of-life care and dying in place. 3. End-of-life care in the hospital was expensive. The total bed-day costs for the 2084 deaths in the two clusters for the index death episode, cumulative 3, 6, and 12 months of hospitalisation were HK$ 65 474 591, HK$ 82 543 510, HK$ 100 170 949, and HK$ 108 960 348, respectively. The annual cost-savings in hospitalisation bed-days would be HK$ 177 million when about 30 % of elders accepted dying in their <b>old</b> <b>age</b> <b>homes.</b> 4. Elderly residents {{were willing to pay}} an additional fee for community end-of-life care services in <b>old</b> <b>age</b> <b>homes.</b> Both the services of the doctor and <b>old</b> <b>age</b> <b>home</b> staff were important attributes. Hence, elderly people were prepared to use more community end-of-life care if better staff and doctor services were provided. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} {{severity}} of the symptoms of depression among the people aged 65 years and above living in an <b>old</b> <b>age</b> <b>home</b> and in their own home. Methods: The present study comprised of total 260 people aged 65 years and above (130 from Social Welfare center <b>old</b> <b>age</b> <b>home</b> Pashupatinath Kathmandu Nepal and 130 people aged 65 years and above from different VDCs of Rasuwa district Nepal). The interview through structured questionnaire was used to collect data of background (socio-demographic) variables and independent variables. Geriatric depression scale (long form) was used to collect the data on severity of the symptoms of depression. The severity of symptoms of depression as an outcome variable consisting three categories normal (0 - 9), mild (10 - 19) and severe depression (20 - 30) were assessed with geriatric depression scale. Cross tabulation and chi-square test were applied to measure the association of variables. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to calculate the crude and adjusted odd ratios (OR) with their 95 % confidence intervals (CI).   Results:The severity of the symptoms of depression was higher in the residents of <b>old</b> <b>age</b> <b>home</b> (59. 2 percent severe symptoms of depression) than in residents of their own home (20. 8 percent severe symptoms of depression). The people living in <b>old</b> <b>age</b> <b>home</b> had higher likelihood of having   symptoms of depression [OR 10. 93, 95 %CI (5. 05 - 23. 65) ]. Gender and marital status were significantly associated with severity of symptoms of depression in both groups. Female gender had higher likelihood of having severe symptoms of depression than male. Widows/widowers had more likelihood of having severe symptoms than the people with other marital status. Literacy and caste were not associated with symptoms of depression for both groups. Age, occupation before age of 65 years and religion were associated only for those living in their own home. Self reported health, total disease present, level of satisfaction of life, perception of life and perception about <b>old</b> <b>age</b> showed significant association with mild and severe symptoms of depression in the people living in <b>old</b> <b>age</b> <b>home</b> even after adjusting for all socio-demographic variables. However among the people living in their own home only the perception of life, level of satisfaction of life and leisure time activities were significantly associated with   mild and severe symptoms of depression.   Conclusion:Compared to <b>old</b> <b>aged</b> people residing in their own home, those residing in <b>old</b> <b>age</b> <b>home</b> had the higher likelihood of having symptoms of depression. The place of residence matters a lot to determine the symptoms of depression and there may be separate determinants of severity of symptoms of depression in case of <b>old</b> <b>aged</b> people living in an <b>old</b> <b>age</b> <b>home</b> and those living in their own home.
