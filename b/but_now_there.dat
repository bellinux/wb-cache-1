25|$|These {{important}} scientific {{findings may}} begin to shift the neuron-specific perspective into a more holistic view of the brain which encompasses the glial cells as well. The glia's importance is becoming ever more clear {{as time goes on}} and new research is conducted. For the vast part of the last century, scientists have written off glial cells to be nothing more than the structure and foundations that hold the neurons in place. <b>But</b> <b>now,</b> <b>there</b> is direct evidence that correlates the number of glial cells in the brain with the amount of intelligence that any given species possesses. Future research will begin to shed light on the mysterious, yet increasingly crucial, role of glial cells.|$|E

25|$|The Camposanto Monumentale once {{contained}} a large collection of Roman sculptures and sarcophagi, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>there</b> are only 84 remaining. The walls were once covered in frescoes, the first were applied in 1360, the last about three centuries later. The Stories of the Old Testament by Benozzo Gozzoli (c. 15th century) were {{situated in the}} north gallery, while the south arcade was famous for the Stories of the Genesis by Piero di Puccio (c. late 15th century). The most remarkable fresco is The Triumph of Death, a realistic work by Buonamico Buffalmacco. On 27 July 1944, incendiary bombs dropped by Allied aircraft set {{the roof of the}} building on fire and covered them in molten lead, all but destroying them. Since 1945, restoration works have been going on and now the Campo Santo has been brought back to its original state.|$|E

[...] Jinnah was buried on 12 September 1948 amid official mourning in both India and Pakistan; a million people gathered for his funeral. Indian Governor-General Rajagopalachari cancelled an official reception that day in honour of the late leader. Today, Jinnah rests in a large marble mausoleum, Mazar-e-Quaid, in Karachi.|$|E

500|$|Keeping {{with the}} spirit of past games, Howard promised to keep {{with the spirit}} of [...] "big-world, do-anything"-style games, feeling that a certain size and number of choices were needed to make {{role-playing}} feel [...] "meaningful"; <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>there</b> was to be greater emphasis on keeping the game focused. Pete Hines saw the developments between games as less an issue of design focus and more as a [...] "natural side effect of improving and refining how the game works". If smart decisions were made, ease of play would naturally follow. Oblivion would include fewer NPCs and quests than Morrowind, and mindless filler, which Howard felt the team had been guilty of in the past, would be avoided. In exchange, Producer Gavin Carter later explained, there would be greater focus on length and depth in the quests, adding more [...] "alternate paths", more characters [...] "to connect with, who actually have personalities". Carter cast negative aspersions on aspects of gameplay too far removed from the game's central plot. Carter stated that such material was not needed, preferring instead that the focus be on the plot, on [...] "fighting these demon lords", and that further material is [...] "tertiary" [...] and [...] "takes away".|$|E

2500|$|A {{platform}} game (or platformer) is a [...] type {{of video}} game, and subgenre of action game. It involves guiding a player character or avatar to jump between suspended platforms and/or over obstacles to traverse their environment. The player controls the jumps to avoid letting their character fall to their death or miss necessary jumps. The most common unifying element of games of this genre is the jump button, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>there</b> are other alternatives like swiping a touchscreen. Other acrobatic maneuvers may factor into the gameplay as well, such as climbing, swinging from vines or extendable arms, as in Ristar or Bionic Commando, or bouncing from springboards or trampolines, as in Alpha Waves. These mechanics, {{even in the}} context of other genres, are commonly called platforming, a verbification of platform. Games where jumping is automated completely, such as 3D games in The Legend of Zelda series, fall outside of the genre.|$|E
2500|$|Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film four stars {{of four and}} wrote, [...] "The Tree of Life is a film of vast {{ambition}} and deep humility, attempting no less than to encompass all of existence and view it {{through the prism of}} a few infinitesimal lives. The only other film I've seen with this boldness of vision is Kubrick's [...] and it lacked Malick's fierce evocation of human feeling. There were once several directors who yearned to make no less than a masterpiece, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>there</b> are only a few. Malick has stayed true to that hope ever since his first feature in 1973." [...] The following year, Ebert gave The Tree of Life one of his 10 votes in Sight & Sounds 2012 critics' poll of the world's greatest films. Anthony Lane of The New Yorker said a [...] "seraphic strain" [...] in Malick's work [...] "hits a solipsistic high" [...] in The Tree of Life. [...] "While the result will sound to some like a prayer, others may find it increasingly lonely and locked, and may themselves pray for Ben Hecht or Billy Wilder to rise from the dead and attack Malick’s script with a quiver of poisonous wisecracks," [...] the magazine's reviewer said.|$|E
2500|$|Nixon {{later told}} Soap Opera Digest that she always planned on pairing Dimitri with Erica, but held {{off to see}} if they worked well together. [...] "Long before their {{relationship}} started, viewers were saying that Erica and Dimitri belong together," [...] she said. [...] "They have great chemistry and are very alike, kindred spirits." [...] Nixon wrote the beginning of the couple's story as a love-hate relationship where they both disliked each other. The dislike became an attraction that resulted in a [...] "tug-of-war" [...] type of story. [...] "We can't even define it as a romance," [...] Nader said. [...] "It has to be defined as a positioning of players. Dimitri is very well aware that he has to dance a little dance with her." [...] Nixon made the relationship different from Erica's other ones. In previous romances, she acted as the aggressor. In this one, Nixon positioned Dimitri as the one who pursued Erica and made the first sexual overtures. She also used the Erica and Dimitri relationship as a way of developing a new, more sexual side of Dimitri. Nader said, [...] "There was a part of Dimitri that he never explored before because he married so young. A part of him shut down. <b>But</b> <b>now,</b> <b>there</b> is a whole other aspect of his sexual nature that has been awakened and Erica is about that. [...] a lot more fire with her." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{granting}} of a charter (Stadtrecht) would place responsibility on the inhabitants {{to maintain the}} walls and defences and also provide a force of citizens (Bürgergarde) to defend the town when necessary, The uniformed Bürgergarde survived in some Austrian towns until {{they were forced to}} disband in 1920, but they have been re-established in Radstadt, Murau and Eggenburg. [...] The Bürgergarde were often granted a larger tower on the wall for their musters and other towers may have been granted to craftsmens’ gilds. By the end of the 17th century, evidence from prints suggest that some town walls were starting to fall into decay and in the 18th Century Maria Theresa and Joseph II encouraged the removal of gates to encourage economic growth. But it was the French forces of Napoleon who may have done most to demolish and flatten major fortresses as at Klagenfurt. Houses were now being built against the walls and in the ditches or moats of many towns and new ring roads started to appear. In Vienna, Mayor Karl Luger undertook the massive demolition task of removing the highly fortified bastions and replacing them with the Ringstrasse. Demolition of walls and towers continued into the 20th century, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>there</b> was growing feeling that they should be preserved for their historic interest. Possibly the first instance of the deliberate conservation of a town wall was in 1909 when the Imperial Ministry of Culture and Education granted Drosendorf 3,000 crowns to undertake a repair programme. At Radkersburg, a start was made on the preservation and display of the elaborate fortifications as early as the 1920s. Hitler, whose birthplace was Braunau am Inn, was aware of the demolition of the north gate-tower of the town in 1893 and had plans prepared (unexecuted) to rebuild it. More recently there has been widespread conservation work undertaken on the town defences of towns such as Weitra, Zwettl, Hainburg, Drosendorf, and Radstadt.|$|E
2500|$|The {{last major}} {{thing that would}} happen with the Soviet Science Academy would be a {{struggle}} to allow more Western ideas into the Physics Department. This obviously {{was in response to}} America having nuclear weapons and the Soviet Union realizing they needed to catch up with them. An article would be published by Vladimir Fock through the Soviet Science academy criticizing the theories of Einstein because he was a Western scientist. [...] However, this propagandist work was found to have shoddy science behind it and the entire department upon inspection was found to be less productive {{than the rest of the}} Science Academy. The more realistic scientific work written by Moisey Alexandrovich Markov which agreed with Western theories would receive more support. So in the beginning, with people like Aleksandrov in the philosophy department there was the idea that people should not bring up Western ideology even to criticize it and explain why Communism is better <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>there</b> is a turnaround where because beating the West is what matters good science needs to take place even if it means talking about ideas that go against principles to do so. This is because the philosophy of the West had been more important to defeat than proper research methods until the concerns about nuclear war emerged. They would decide to fire more of the department and hire more competent people because of the increased importance of nuclear research. The need for physicists would protect Jewish people from the xenophobic wrath of Stalin and Beria but not everyone would be spared for these reasons. [...] Still many scientists would be protected by the institute because they were seen as important to the success of the country. The Soviet Science Academy would help to play their part in the goal of the Soviet Union to surpass the military might of the United States through the use of physics and chemistry research.|$|E
