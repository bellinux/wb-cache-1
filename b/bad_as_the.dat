5|$|Following the tie to the Mark Greys, the Panhandles {{traveled}} to Lorain, Ohio, {{to play against}} the Elyria Athletics on Thanksgiving Day. The result of the game was another 0–0 tie, making it the seventh time in nine games the Panhandles were held scoreless. Chris Willis stated this tie was not as <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> previous weeks because the Athletics had old players from the Akron Indians, a winning team in the Ohio League.|$|E
5|$|An off spinner, Johnson was {{a member}} of Bradman’s first-choice team, playing in four of the five Tests before being dropped for the final rubber. He also played in the matches against Worcestershire, the MCC and Leveson-Gower's XI, where Australia {{selected}} their strongest possible team. However, Johnson was not prominent in the Test success, taking seven wickets at 61.00, his best result being 3/72 in the first innings of the Second Test. Among the five frontline bowlers used in four or more Tests, Lindwall, Miller, Toshack, Johnston and Johnson, the last had the worst average by a factor of almost two; Toshack averaged 33.09 and the others less than 23.50. Lindwall and Johnston took 27 wickets each, while Miller and Toshack took 13 and 11 respectively. Johnson’s economy rate was the second worst of the quintet and his strike rate of 156.86 was more than twice as <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> others, with the exception of Toshack (94.46). Johnson also had little impact with the bat, scoring 51 runs at 10.20, but he did take five catches in the slips.|$|E

25|$|Compared to many Welsh towns, Newport's {{economy had}} a broad base, with foundries, {{engineering}} works, a cattle market and shops that served much of Monmouthshire. However, the docks were in decline {{even before the}} Great Depression, and local unemployment peaked at 34.7% in 1930: high, but not as <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> levels seen in the mining towns of the South Wales Valleys. Despite the economic conditions, the council re-housed over half {{the population in the}} 1920s and 30s. In 1930 the Town Dock was filled in.|$|E
25|$|A later study {{questioned}} {{the attitudes of}} adolescents. When asked about abstinence, many girls reported they felt conflicted. They were trying to balance maintaining a good reputation with trying to maintain a romantic relationship and wanting to behave in adult-like ways. Boys viewed having sex as social capital. Many boys believed that their male peers who were abstinent would not as easily climb the social ladder as sexually active boys. Some boys said that for them, the risks that may come from having sex were not as <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> social risks that could come from remaining abstinent.|$|E

Amid the continual rain, the advance guard limped into Abrantes on 23 November. The rear of the corps closed up on 26 November. By this time, the only guns with the column were four Spanish horse artillery pieces, while half of the soldiers were straggling or marauding.|$|E

Influenza pandemics from its genetic offspring may include influenza A virus subtypes other than H5N1. While genetic analysis of the H5N1 virus shows that influenza pandemics from its genetic offspring can easily be far more lethal than the Spanish flu pandemic, planning for a future influenza pandemic is based on what can be done and there is no higher Pandemic Severity Index level than a Category 5 pandemic which, roughly speaking, is any pandemic as <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Spanish flu or worse; and for which all intervention measures are to be used.|$|E
25|$|The {{country had}} been hit by a {{prolonged}} period of dry weather in the second half 2011, which had been attributed to the La Niña that results in the cooling of the surface temperature of the sea around Tuvalu which resulted in reduced rainfall. In October 2011, the Tuvalu Red Cross reported that the country had not received normal rainfall in six months, leading to shortages. The capital, Funafuti, and several of the outer atolls had been particularly affected by the drought. Nukulaelae and Nanumaga were the most seriously affected outer islands. The dry conditions on Nukulaelae affected the vast majority of pulaka pits - Pulaka, or swamp taro, is a staple crop for Tuvaluans. On Vaitupu the drought was also severe, but not as <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> other islands.|$|E
25|$|The patrol bases were hurriedly created. One of {{the young}} lieutenants who flew from Marfa Field {{in the summer of}} 1919 remembered the flying field as a pasture at the eastern edge of town. Its five hangars were made from canvas. A double row of ten or twelve tents served as officer and enlisted {{quarters}} and sheltered flight headquarters and supply. The lieutenant, Stacy C. Hinkle, recalled his tour of duty on the border as “a life of hardship, possible death, starvation pay, and a lonely life without social contacts, in hot, barren desert wastes, tortured by sun, wind, and sand.” The boredom was as <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> physical hardship and discomfort, the sole recreation being drinking and gambling. Even so, Hinkle thought the airmen better off than the poor fellows at cavalry outposts up and down the border.|$|E

25|$|In 1945–46 {{housing and}} food {{conditions}} were <b>bad,</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> disruption of transport, markets, and finances slowed {{a return to}} normal. In the West, bombing had destroyed the fourth of the housing stock, and over 10 million refugees from the east had crowded in, most living in camps. Food production in 1946–48 was only two-thirds of the prewar level, while grain and meat shipments – which usually supplied 25% of the food – no longer arrived from the East. Furthermore, {{the end of the}} war brought the end of large shipments of food seized from occupied nations that had sustained Germany during the war. Coal production was down 60%, which had cascading negative effects on railroads, heavy industry, and heating. Industrial production fell more than half and reached prewar levels only at the end of 1949.|$|E
25|$|In Germany in 1945–46 {{housing and}} food {{conditions}} were <b>bad,</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> disruption of transport, markets and finances slowed {{a return to}} normality. In the West, bombing had destroyed 5,000,000 houses and apartments, and 12,000,000 refugees from the east had crowded in. Food production was only two-thirds of the pre-war level in 1946–48, while normal grain and meat shipments no longer arrived from the East. The drop in food production {{can be attributed to}} a drought that killed a major portion of the wheat crop while a severe winter destroyed the majority of the wheat crop the following year. This caused most Europeans to rely on a 1,500 calorie per day diet. Furthermore, the large shipments of food stolen from occupied nations during the war no longer reached Germany. Industrial production fell more than half and reached pre-war levels only at the end of 1949.|$|E
25|$|After the 1976 season, {{most of the}} Athletics' veteran players {{did become}} {{eligible}} for free agency, and predictably almost all left. Several decades and 3,000 miles later, one of baseball's most storied franchises suffered yet another dismemberment of a dynasty team. As happened {{with the end of}} the A's first dynasty in the early 1900s, the collapse was swift and total. The next three years were as <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> worst days in Philadelphia or Kansas City, with the A's finishing last twice and next-to-last once. In 1977, for instance—only three years after winning the World Series and two years after playing for the pennant—the A's finished with the worst record in the American League, and the second-worst record in baseball. They even trailed the expansion Seattle Mariners (though by only 1/2 game, as one game with the Minnesota Twins was canceled by weather and never made up).|$|E
