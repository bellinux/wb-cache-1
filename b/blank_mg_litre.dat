The highest explant establishment (77. 88 %) was observed during spring, {{which was on}} a par with explant establishment frequency during winter season (76. 21 %). The lowest explant establishment was observed during rainy season (61. 94 %).

The antibrowning agents decreased explant browning, yet they could not eliminate it. The magnitude of the effect of the antibrowning agents depended on the season of explant collection and type of explant. Antibrowning agents were more useful during spring and winter seasons when the incidence of browning was low, in comparison to rainy, summer and autumn seasons when the browning was comparatively high.

Iron and arsenic speciation were followed in the dissolved phase, and microbial Fe(II) oxidation products were identified using XRD and EXAFS spectroscopy. Arsenite was found to coprecipitate with amorphous phases, with schwertmannite, and/or to be incorporated in tooeleite (Fe 6 (AsO 3) 4 SO 4 (OH) 4. H 2 O). Precipitation of As-poor jarosite also occurred {{at the end of}} the experiments. The nature, proportion and sequence of the biominerals differed from one strain to another and as a function of the inoculum size.

We investigated if severe hypoalbuminaemia may affect the accuracy of a target-controlled infusion (TCI) device, the Diprifusor, during sedation in critically ill patients. Methods. Ten critically ill hypoalbuminaemic patients ( 32 g litre 1) were included in this study. They underwent sedation with propofol, aimed at a Ramsey sedation score of 4 – 5. The Diprifusor was used to achieve target propofol plasma concentrations that ranged between 0. 6 and 1. 5 <b>mg</b> <b>litre</b> 1. Propofol concentration was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography 5 min, 15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 6 h and 8 h after starting TCI. The accuracy of TCI was evaluated by calculating performance errors [PE= 100 ·(measured concentration–predicted concentration) /predicted concentration], absolute and relative individual median performance errors (MDAPE and MDPE) and divergence (the slope of individual regression lines between PEs and time). Results. PEs [median (range) ] were 7 (– 65, 79) in hypoalbuminaemic patients and 2 (– 53, 188) in normoalbuminaemic patients; absolute PEs were 21 (1, 79) and 22 (0, 188). No significant difference was observed between the two groups. MDPE, MDAPE and divergence values were also similar.

In a prospective, randomized, clinical trial, we have investigated whether an S-(þ) -ketamine-based anaesthetic protocol leads to increased cardiac troponin T levels (cTnT) after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Methods. Two hundred and nine patients undergoing elective CABG were randomized to receive either i. v. anaesthesia with sufentanil–midazolam–propofol (SMP; n 108) or S-(þ) -ketamine– midazolam–propofol (KMP; n 101). Haemodynamic variables were maintained within the normal range. Invasive haemodynamic monitoring was performed using a pulmonary artery catheter. Plasma cTnT levels were sampled before induction and 1, 6, and 24 h after aortic unclamping. Cardiovascular adverse events, such as electrocardiographic signs of ischaemia, perioperative myocardial infarction, and death, were recorded. Results. Patient characteristics, cardiac profile, intraoperative management, and the incidence of cardiovascular adverse events were comparable between the groups. Plasma cTnT levels increased after operation in both groups. cTnT levels were significantly lower in the KMP group 6 h after aortic unclamping compared with the SMP group (P 0. 004), but did not differ 24 h after aortic unclamping [median (range) : SMP 0. 4 (0. 01 – 3. 9) vs KMP 0. 4 (0. 07 – 6. 6) <b>mg</b> <b>litre</b> 21, P 0. 338].

Casts are characterized by lower pH, are enriched in organic carbon (OC) and clay content, have a larger cation exchange capacity, and a greater exchangeable Ca content. The clay mineralogy of the soil studied and casts {{is characterized by a}} muscovite-kaolinite-chlorite association. In addition, the clay fraction of the soil contains lepidocrocite (γ-FeOOH), which was not found in the casts. Atrazine adsorption isotherms were reasonably well described by the Freundlich equation and were all non-linear. The mean amounts of adsorbed AT for starting concentrations of 3 - 30 <b>mg</b> <b>litre</b> 1 ranged from 8 to 34 %, being largest in earthworm casts. Soil AT adsorption capacity was well correlated with OC content. Non-decomposed organic matter present in the coarse size fractions and specific compounds present in earthworm casts (proteins, mono- and polysaccharides, polyphenols, sugars, lignin) and microbial and fungal biomass contribute to AT adsorption. Weak electrostatic (physical) sorption of AT on organic compounds and on mineral surfaces prevails. For casts, the formation of additional hydrophobic interactions between AT and SOM is proposed. We also studied AT biodegradation by the model bacterium Pseudomonas sp. strain ADP in the presence of soils or earthworm casts. An enhancement of the AT disappearance rate was observed in the presence of all the solid matrices tested compared with that obtained in an aqueous medium.
