5|$|A {{number of}} {{preclinical}} {{studies have demonstrated}} inhibitory effects of MFGM against several pathogens. Both whole <b>bovine</b> MFGM and its extracted lipid components were found to exhibit dose-dependent inhibition of rotavirus infectivity in vitro. Antibacterial effects of MFGM have included decreased gastric colonization and inflammation after H. pylori infection in mice; inhibition of shiga toxin gene expression by E. coli O157:H7; and decreased colonization and translocation of L. monocytogenes. Mice that were fed prophylactically with <b>bovine</b> whey glycoprotein fraction, including MFGM proteins, did not develop diarrhea after exposure to rotavirus.|$|E

5|$|Bacterial {{diseases}} {{carried by}} wolves include brucellosis, lyme disease, leptospirosis, tularemia, <b>bovine</b> tuberculosis, listeriosis, anthrax and foot and mouth disease. Wolves can catch Brucella suis from wild and domestic reindeer. While adult wolves {{tend not to}} show any clinical signs, it can severely weaken the pups of infected females. Although lyme disease can debilitate individual wolves, {{it does not appear}} to have any significant effect on wolf populations. Leptospirosis can be contracted through contact with infected prey or urine, and can cause fever, anorexia, vomiting, anemia, hematuria, icterus, and death. Wolves living near farms are more vulnerable to the disease than those living in the wilderness, probably because of prolonged contact with infected domestic animal waste. Wolves may catch tularemia from lagomorph prey, though its effect on wolves is unknown. Although <b>bovine</b> tuberculosis is not considered a major threat to wolves, it has been recorded to have once killed two wolf pups in Canada.|$|E

40|$|Fasciolosis is a {{parasitic}} disease {{which is caused}} by digenetic trematodes, such as Fasciola hepatica, and which occurs worldwide. The disease causes significant economic losses in cattle because of the reduction in milk and meat production and because the parasitized livers have no economic value. Also, abortion and mortality rates increase. To determine the occurrence and dispersal of F. hepatica {{in the state of}} Minas Gerais, fecal samples were collected from <b>bovines</b> aged 12 months and older between April 2005 and April 2006. The <b>bovines</b> came from 1, 251 rural farms of 120 municipalities/cities in Minas Gerais. Water was collected to ascertain the presence of the intermediate host in the properties where infected <b>bovines</b> were found. A total of 16 municipalities had infected <b>bovines</b> and 13 had the presence of Lymnaea columella. We detected infected <b>bovines</b> in 70 % of the rural farms visited in the municipality of Itajubá. Itajubá was also found to have infected snails with the larval stage of F. hepatica.

40|$|Trichostrongylids {{infection}} {{has gained}} significant public health importance since Trichostrongylus spp. infections {{have been reported}} in humans in Lao PDR. In this study, gastrointestinal nematodes were identified and the intensity of infections was determined in goats and cattle, which are animals greatly used for meat production in Lahanam Village, Lao PDR. The total number of goats and <b>bovines</b> was 23 and 29, respectively, pertaining to 32 households surveyed in the area. Feacal samples were randomly collected from 14 goats and 11 <b>bovines.</b> Ninety three percent (13 / 14) of goats and 36 % (3 / 11) of cattle were infected, with an average of 1, 728 and 86 eggs per gram of faeces (EPG), respectively. Coproculture showed Trichostrongylus spp. (goats 16 %; <b>bovines</b> 48 %), Haemonchus spp. (goats 69 %; <b>bovines</b> 37 %), Cooperia spp. (<b>bovines</b> 8 %) and Oesophagostomum spp. (goats 15 %; <b>bovines</b> 6 %). After performing the necropsy on an adult goat, Trichuris spp. was also found. We confirmed the presence of Oesophagostomum spp., H. contortus and T. colubriformis by morphology and DNA sequencing analysis of the ITS region of rDNA. Due to interactions between humans and goats in Lahanam Village and high EPG results, the diagnosis of species and the intensity of gastrointestinal nematode infection in these animals are important public-health issues. Other ruminant parasites, such as Oesophagostomum and Haemonchus, found in caprines and <b>bovines,</b> are reported to be causes of zoonosis and their presence in humans should be investigated in future field surveys in this area...|$|R

40|$|The {{infection}} of the digital area {{is the most common}} cause of lameness in cattle, leading to the rejection of high-production animals destined to reproduction. This study aimed at histological and histomorphometric evaluations of the testis of <b>bovines</b> with digital dermatitis. Different portions of testis from 20 Nellore animals, ten healthy and ten with digital dermatitis, between 25 and 30 months of age, were analyzed. All analyzed testis showed some degree of degeneration of the seminiferous epithelium. Mononuclear interstitial infiltrate was observed in testis of both healthy <b>bovines</b> and the ones with digital dermatitis. <b>Bovines</b> with digital dermatitis presented higher height of seminiferous tubular epithelium in all regions of testis, larger area of the tubular lumen, and larger tubular diameter. We concluded that young Nellore <b>bovines</b> show different degrees of testicular degeneration, as well as chronic nonspecific interstitial orchitis, unrelated to digital dermatitis. The testis histomorphometric changes of these animals are not related with foot disease...|$|R

25|$|Human milk {{is rich in}} choline, but {{formulas}} {{derived from}} other sources, particularly soy, have lower total choline concentrations than human milk. <b>Bovine</b> milk and bovine-derived formulas had similar or higher glycerophosphocholine compared to human milk, and soy-derived formulas had lower glycerophosphocholine content. Phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin concentrations were similar between <b>bovine</b> formulas and human milk, but soy-derived infant formulas had more phosphatidylcholine than human or <b>bovine</b> sources. Soy-derived formulas had less sphingomyelin than human milk, which is a concern, since sphingomyelin is used for producing myelin, which insulates neurons. Free choline concentrations in mature human milk were 30–80% lower than those found in <b>bovine</b> milk or formulas. Mature human milk also has lower free choline than colostrum-transitional human milk. Phosphocholine is particularly abundant in human milk.|$|E
