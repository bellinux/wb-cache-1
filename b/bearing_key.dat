Many [...] "filmed inserts" [...] were produced by UK artists {{so they could be}} screened on TV when the bands were not available to appear live. Pink Floyd were pioneers in producing promotional films for their songs including [...] "San Francisco: Film", directed by Anthony Stern, [...] "Scarecrow", [...] "Arnold Layne" [...] and [...] "Interstellar Overdrive", the latter directed by Peter Whitehead, who also made several pioneering clips for The Rolling Stones between 1966 and 1968. In the UK The Kinks made one of the first [...] "plot" [...] promo clips for a song. For their single [...] "Dead End Street" [...] (1966) a miniature comic movie was made. The BBC reportedly refused to air the clip because it was considered to be in [...] "poor taste". The Who featured in several promotional clips in this period, beginning with their 1965 clip for I Can't Explain. Their plot clip for Happy Jack (1966) shows the band acting like a gang of thieves. The promo film to Call Me Lightning (1968) tells a story of how drummer Keith Moon came to join the group: The other three band members are having tea inside what looks like an abandoned hangar when suddenly a [...] "bleeding box" [...] arrives, out of which jumps a fast-running, time lapse, Moon that the other members subsequently try {{to get a hold of}} in a sped-up slapstick chasing sequence to wind him down.

40|$|The nonnucleoside reverse {{transcriptase}} inhibitors (NNRTIs) are {{key components of}} {{highly active antiretroviral therapy}} (HAART) for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1). A major problem with the first approved NNRTIs was the emergence of mutations in the HIV- 1 {{reverse transcriptase}} (RT), in particular K 103 N and Y 181 C, which led to resistance to the entire class. We adopted an iterative strategy to synthesize and test small molecule inhibitors from a chemical series of pyrazoles against wild-type (wt) RT and the most prevalent NNRTI-resistant mutants. The emerging candidate, lersivirine (UK- 453, 061), binds the RT enzyme in a novel way (resulting in a unique resistance profile), inhibits over 60 % of viruses <b>bearing</b> <b>key</b> RT mutations, with 50 % effective concentrations (EC 50 s) within 10 -fold of those for wt viruses, and has excellent selectivity against a range of human targets. Altogether lersivirine is a highly potent and selective NNRTI, with excellent efficacy against NNRTI-resistant viruses...|$|E
40|$|Terrorists usually target high {{occupancy}} iconic {{and public}} buildings using vehicle borne incendiary devices {{in order to}} claim a maximum number of lives and cause extensive damage to public property. While initial casualties are due to direct shock by the explosion, collapse of structural elements may extensively increase the total figure. Most of these buildings have been or are built without consideration of their vulnerability to such events. Therefore, the vulnerability and residual capacity assessment of buildings to deliberately exploded bombs is important to provide mitigation strategies to protect the buildings' occupants and the property. Explosive loads and their effects on a building have therefore attracted significant attention in the recent past. Comprehensive and economical design strategies must be developed for future construction. This research investigates the response and damage of reinforced concrete (RC) framed buildings together with their load <b>bearing</b> <b>key</b> structural components to a near field blast event. Finite element method (FEM) based {{analysis was used to}} investigate the structural framing system and components for global stability, followed by a rigorous analysis of key structural components for damage evaluation using the codes SAP 2000 and LS DYNA respectively. The research involved four important areas in structural engineering. They are blast load determination, numerical modelling with FEM techniques, material performance under high strain rate and non-linear dynamic structural analysis. The response and damage of a RC framed building for different blast load scenarios were investigated. The blast influence region for a two dimensional RC frame was investigated for different load conditions and identified the critical region for each loading case. Two types of design methods are recommended for RC columns to provide superior residual capacities. They are RC columns detailing with multi-layer steel reinforcement cages and a composite columns including a central structural steel core. These are to provide post blast gravity load resisting capacity compared to typical RC column against a catastrophic collapse. Overall, this research broadens the current knowledge of blast and residual capacity analysis of RC framed structures and recommends methods to evaluate and mitigate blast impact on key elements of multi-storey buildings...|$|E

40|$|This paper proposes an {{effective}} numerical method {{to determine the}} forced response of the disk-spindle system represented by asymmetric finite element equations. The asymmetric global finite element matrices are transformed to the modal domain by using the mode vectors from the standard eigenvalue problem. Even though the asymmetric equations of motion in modal domain are coupled, the degrees of freedom in modal domain are much reduced {{so that they are}} numerically integrated.

40|$|Abstract: Roller {{bearing failure}} {{is a major}} factor in failure of {{rotating}} machinery. As a fatal defect is detected, it is common to shut down the machinery as soon as possible to avoid catastrophic damages. Performing such an action, which usually occurs at inconvenient times, typically results in substantial time and economical losses. It is, therefore, important to monitor the condition of roller bearings and to know the details of severity of defects before they cause serious catastrophic consequences. The vibration monitoring technique is suitable to analyze various defects in bearing. This technique can provide early information about progressing malfunctions. This paper describes the suitability of vibration monitoring and analysis techniques to detect defects in roller bearings. Triaxial vibration measurements were taken {{at each end of the}} coupling on the motor and rotor bearing housings. The results indicate that bad bearing has a strong effect on the vibration spectra. Time domain analysis, vibration spectrum analysis have been employed to identify different defects in bearings. The results have demonstrated that each one of these techniques is useful to detect problems in roller <b>bearings.</b> <b>Key</b> words: Roller <b>bearings</b> Defects Prediction Vibration signal Signature analysi...|$|R

40|$|Under-deck {{cable-stayed}} bridges {{are very}} effective structural systems {{for which the}} strong contribution of the stay cables under live loading allows {{for the design of}} very slender decks for persistent and transient loading scenarios. Their behaviour when subjected to seismic excitation is investigated herein and a set of design criteria are presented that relate to the type and arrangement of bearings, the number and configuration of struts, and the transverse distribution of stay cables. The nonlinear behaviour of these bridges when subject to both near- and far-field accelerograms has been thoroughly investigated through the use of incremental dynamic analyses. An intensity measure which reflects the pertinent contributions to response when several vibration modes are activated has been proposed and is shown to be effective for the analysis of this structural type. The under-deck cable-stay system contributes in a very positive manner to reducing the response when the bridges are subject to very strong seismic excitation. For such scenarios, the reduction in the stiffness of the deck due to crack formation, when prestressed concrete decks are used, mobilises the cable system and enhances the overall performance of the system. Sets of natural accelerograms that are compliant with the prescriptions of Eurocode 8 have also been applied in order to propose a set of design criteria for this bridge type in areas prone to earthquakes. Particular attention is given to outlining the optimal strategies for the deployment of <b>bearings.</b> <b>KEY</b> WORDS: Under-deck cable-stayed bridges; nonlinear dynamics; Eurocode 8; bridge bearings; seismic response; incremental dynamic analysis; near-field effects; Intensity Measure 1...|$|R
