Little is known regarding the pathogenicity of this fungus and consequently, four Norwegian C. resinifera isolates were inoculated on to Norway spruce (Picea abies) using two different techniques. These included single-point inoculations on young trees (two inoculations per tree on 14 -year-old trees) and mass-inoculations on older trees (# 200 inoculations per tree on 34 -year-old trees). In both experiments, C. resinifera induced minor symptoms {{that in most}} cases {{did not differ significantly}} from inoculation with sterile agar. The virulent <b>blue-stain</b> fungus C. polonica, which was inoculated for comparative purposes, induced extensive symptoms, causing 83 % dead cambium circumference and 82 % blue-stained sapwood, and long necrotic lesions in the phloem.

40|$|Tag 1 is a {{transposable element}} first {{identified}} as an insertion in the CHL 1 gene of Arabidopsis. The chl 1 ::Tag 1 mutant originated from a plant (ecotype Landsberg erecta) that had been transformed with the maize transposon Activator (Ac), which is distantly related to Tag 1. Genomic analysis of untransformed Landsberg erecta plants demonstrated that two identical Tag 1 elements {{are present in the}} Landsberg erecta genome. To determine what provides transposase function for Tag 1 transposition, we examined Tag 1 excision in different genetic backgrounds. First, the chl 1 ::Tag 1 mutant was backcrossed to untransformed wild-type Arabidopsis plants to remove the Ac element(s) from the genome. F 2 progeny that had no Ac elements but still retained Tag 1 in the CHL 1 gene were identified. Tag 1 still excised in these Ac-minus progeny producing CHL 1 revertants; therefore, Ac is not required for Tag 1 excision. Next, Tag 1 was inserted between a cauliflower mosaic virus 35 S promoter and a beta-glucuronidase (GUS) marker gene and transformed into tobacco. Transformants showed <b>blue-staining</b> sectors indicative of Tag 1 excision.

Thermal treatment is one of the well-established processes used to improve wood stability by modifying chemical compounds and masking <b>blue-stains</b> by darkening the fibre color. In this study, the MPB lumber was subjected to thermal treatment at three temperatures (195, 205, or 215 °C) and three exposure times (1. 5, 2, or 3 h). Based on Duncan's multiple range test, the results indicated that the volumetric swelling after thermal treatment, either from oven-dry to air-conditioned or from oven-dry to water-saturated, was significantly reduced after thermal treatment. Modulus of elasticity was increased when specimens were treated at a temperature of 195 °C, and then decreased as the temperature increased. Modulus of rupture was significantly reduced as treatment temperature increased. The hardness of lumber thermal-treated at 195 °C was significantly increased compared to that of the untreated lumber.

5000|$|The {{psilocybin}} molecule is indirectly {{responsible for}} the hallucinogenic properties of the Psilocybe genus. This compound, {{as well as all}} other indole alkaloids, are derived from the amino acid tryptophan, being the only amino acid with the indole-amine ring. Tryptophan is converted to tryptamine by decarboxylation. Two methylation steps occur producing DMT, another psychedelic compound. Hydroxylation of this compound produces the more potent hallucinogen psilocin, followed by phosphorylation yielding psilocybin. After ingestion of the psilocybin compound alkaline phosphatases present in the body's digestive system, kidneys, and possibly in the blood readily cleave the phosphoryl ester bond from psilocybin, yielding the hydroxyl compound, psilocin. Psilocin is the chemical primarily {{responsible for the}} hallucinogenic effects of the Psilocybe genus. [...] The <b>blue-staining</b> species of Psilocybe are characterized by the presence of psilocin and psilocybin. This <b>blue-staining</b> reaction occurs after the fruit body has been injured, particularly near the base of the stalk. This reaction is thought to be due to the oxidation of psilocybin after the outer surface of the fruit body has been breached. The degree of bluing in a Psilocybe fruit body roughly correlates with the concentration of psilocin in the mushroom. Psilocybin is chemically far more stable than psilocin, the latter compound being largely lost when the mushroom is heated or dried.|$|R

In this study we characterized the local and systemic defense responses of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) against Ophiostoma brunneo-ciliatum Math.

Although the length of the necrotic lesions differed between control (wound) and fungal treatments, only two compounds (pinosylvin monomethyl ether and (+) -α-pinene) were significantly affected by the presence of the fungi, indicating that Scots pine has a generic, rather than specific, induced response. The fact that both nutritional and <b>blue-stain</b> fungi triggered comparable induced defense responses suggests that even a non-pathogenic fungus may participate in exhausting host plant defenses, indirectly assisting in the beetle establishment process.
