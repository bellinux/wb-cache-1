500|$|Fallout 3 {{received}} universal acclaim, {{according to}} video game review aggregator Metacritic. 1UP.com's Demian Linn praised its open-ended gameplay and flexible character-leveling system. While the V.A.T.S. system was called [...] "fun", enemy encounters {{were said to}} suffer {{from a lack of}} precision in real-time combat and little variety in enemy types. The review concluded, Fallout 3 is a [...] "hugely ambitious game that doesn't come around very often". IGN editor Erik Brudvig praised the game's [...] "minimalist" [...] sound design, observing, [...] "you might find yourself with nothing but the sound of wind rustling through decaying trees and <b>blowing</b> <b>dust</b> across the barren plains ... Fallout 3 proves that less can be more". The review noted that the [...] "unusual amount of realism" [...] combined with the [...] "endless conversation permutations" [...] produces [...] "one of the most truly interactive experiences of the generation". In a review of the game for Kotaku, Mike Fahey commented that [...] "While Inon Zur's score is filled with epic goodness, the real stars of Fallout 3s music are the vintage songs from the 1940s".|$|E
500|$|Reviews {{interpreted}} these visions as Ben's {{challenge to}} find and defeat Brother Justin; Ben has to ultimately stop {{the creation of the}} atomic bomb as [...] "the world's march towards doomsday." [...] The Season 1 prologue already suggested this interpretation, mentioning [...] "a false sun explod over Trinity," [...] at which point [...] "man forever traded away wonder for reason." [...] The Trinity test near Alamogordo, New Mexico was humankind's first test of a nuclear weapon in 1945, and Daniel Knauf would have finished Carnivàles six-year run with the explosion of an atomic bomb as the beginning of the [...] "Age of Reason". Still, Knauf's story is [...] "not about the deployment of the bomb, it's more about the invention of the bomb," [...] with the focus [...] "around Alamogordo and the Trinity test site rather than Hiroshima and Nagasaki." [...] Much research was put into the visual effects of the explosion. Stock footage of the first beats of nuclear explosions and a self-created explosion of 300gallons of gasoline were used for reference. The ground effects and <b>blowing</b> <b>dust</b> were created with combinations of volumetric computer graphics smoke, and the fireball of the nuclear explosion was built from Hubble images of the Sun. Knauf left the interpretation of the kiss vision open to both the characters and the audience.|$|E

The wind rose, however, and <b>blew</b> <b>dust</b> and sand in the faces of horse and rider. Except lizards, Slone did not see any living things.|$|R
2500|$|Ghutrah (...) is a {{traditional}} headdress typically worn by Arab men. It is made of a square of cloth ("scarf"), usually cotton, folded and wrapped in various styles around the head. It is commonly worn in areas with an arid climate, to provide protection from direct sun exposure, and also protection of the mouth and eyes from <b>blown</b> <b>dust</b> and sand.|$|R
50|$|Fertilization occurs {{naturally}} when upwellings bring nutrient-rich {{water to}} the surface, as occurs when ocean currents meet an ocean bank or a sea mount. This form of fertilization produces the world's largest marine habitats. Fertilization can also occur when weather carries wind <b>blown</b> <b>dust</b> long distances over the ocean, or iron-rich minerals are carried into the ocean by glaciers, rivers and icebergs.|$|R

2500|$|Phobos {{has been}} photographed in {{close-up}} by several spacecraft whose primary mission {{has been to}} photograph Mars. The first was Mariner 7 in 1969, followed by Viking 1 in 1977, Mars Global Surveyor in 1998 and 2003, Mars Express in 2004, 2008, and 2010, and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter in 2007 and 2008. On August 25, 2005, the Spirit Rover, with an excess of energy due to wind <b>blowing</b> <b>dust</b> off of its solar panels, took several short-exposure photographs {{of the night sky}} from the surface of Mars. [...] Phobos and Deimos are both clearly visible in the photograph.|$|E
2500|$|Three tests {{planned for}} 1993 have been {{abandoned}} in place, two in Yucca Flat. The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty had been strongly supported by the UN General Assembly in 1991, and negotiations began in earnest in 1993. The United States, on October 3, 1992, suspended all nuclear weapons testing programs in anticipation of eventual ratification of the treaty. The partially assembled cabling, towers and equipment for shot [...] "Icecap" [...] in Area 1 and shot [...] "Gabbs" [...] in Area 2 lie amid weeds and <b>blowing</b> <b>dust,</b> waiting for a possible resumption of nuclear testing. Shot [...] "Greenwater" [...] awaits its fate in Area 19 at Pahute Mesa. [...] "Icecap" [...] {{was to be a}} joint US-UK test event.|$|E
50|$|A {{cleaning}} {{event is}} a phenomenon whereby dust is removed from solar panels, particularly ones on Mars, {{by the action of}} wind. The term cleaning event is used on several NASA webpages; generally the term is used in reference to the fact that Martian winds have <b>blown</b> <b>dust</b> clear off the solar panels of probes on Mars increasing their energy output.|$|R

2500|$|Meanwhile, the 42nd Line in attack columns {{tried to}} rush Acland's brigade, which began volleying at a {{distance}} of [...] When they saw the 1st Light bolting for the rear, the men of 42nd also ran away. Luckily for Reynier, Kempt's disorderly pursuit gave the Frenchman time to patch up his line. Acland got into a musketry duel with Peyri's brigade and the Poles soon decamped, but the Swiss battalion refused to panic. The brigades of Acland and Cole converged on Digonet's position, which now included the Swiss. But every time the British advanced, the 9th Chasseurs galloped toward them, forcing them to halt and form square. The French horsemen would then turn and ride back to the protection of their infantry. Even after Acland and Cole were reinforced by Oswald, the standoff continued. Fortunately for the British, a breeze was <b>blowing</b> <b>dust</b> and smoke into the faces of the French artillerymen and their aim was poor. Finally, the eight center companies of the 20th Foot appeared on the extreme British left, having returned from their diversionary attack. When the 20th Foot attacked Digonet's right flank, Reynier ordered the remains of his division to retreat to Catanzaro. French losses were 490 killed, 870 wounded, and 722 captured. British losses were far fewer, 45 killed and 282 wounded.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{inherent}} dangers involved in pursuing hazardous weather. These range from lightning, tornadoes, large hail, flooding, hazardous road conditions (rain or hail-covered roadways), animals on the roadway, downed power lines (and occasionally other debris), reduced visibility from heavy rain (often wind blown), <b>blowing</b> <b>dust,</b> and hail fog. Most directly weather-related hazards such {{as from a}} tornado are minimized if the storm chaser is knowledgeable and cautious. In some situations severe downburst winds may push automobiles around, especially high-profile vehicles. Tornadoes affect a relatively small area and are predictable enough to be avoided if sustaining situational awareness and following strategies including always having an open escape route, maintaining a safe distance, and avoiding placement {{in the direction of}} travel of a tornado (in most cases in the Northern Hemisphere this is to the north and to the east of a tornado). Lightning, however, is an unavoidable hazard. [...] "Core punching", storm chaser slang for driving through a heavy precipitation core to intercept the area of interest within a storm, is recognized as hazardous due to reduced visibility and because many tornadoes are rain-wrapped. The [...] "bear's cage" [...] refers to the area under a rotating wall cloud (and any attendant tornadoes), which is the [...] "bear", and to the blinding precipitation (which can include window-shatteringly large hail) surrounding some or all sides of a tornado, which is the [...] "cage". Similarly, chasing at night heightens risk due to darkness.|$|E
60|$|In the {{meantime}} the days got warmer and a flush of vivid green {{spread across the}} grass. The roaring wind that swept the tableland drove clouds that never broke across the dazzling sky, and where there were belts of plowed land the harrows clanked across the furrows amidst a haze of <b>blowing</b> <b>dust.</b> The ducks and geese had gone, and red lilies began to sway above the rolling waves of grass. Farmer and hired man worked with tense activity, but Charnock's efforts were spasmodic and often slack.|$|E

A planned laser light show was cancelled when strong winds <b>blew</b> <b>dust</b> toward the audience.|$|R
5000|$|Ghutrah (غتره) is a {{traditional}} keffiyeh headdress worn by men in the Arabian peninsula. It is made of a square of usually finer cotton cloth ("scarf"), folded and wrapped in various styles (usually a triangle) around the head. It is commonly worn in areas with an arid climate, to provide protection from direct sun exposure, and also protection of the mouth and eyes from <b>blown</b> <b>dust</b> and sand.|$|R

60|$|A boisterous wind {{swept the}} high plain and round, white-edged clouds rolled across the sky. The grass that ran {{back from the}} horizon was parched, and in the {{distance}} a white streak of <b>blowing</b> <b>dust</b> marked a dried alkali lake. Dust of dark color drove along the row of wooden stores and houses that fronted the railroad track, across which three grain elevators rose like castles. The telegraph posts along the track melted into the level waste, and behind the spot where they vanished the tops of a larger group of elevators cut {{the edge of the}} plain.|$|E
60|$|Flora Schuyler, who {{noticed the}} little flush in her companion's face, glanced {{out of the}} dusty window, for the {{interior}} of the gently-rocking car, with its lavish decoration and upholstery, was not new to her, and the first thing that caught her eye was the miscellaneous deposit of rubbish, old boots, and discarded clothing, amidst the willows that slowly flitted by. Then she saw a towering water-tank, wooden houses that rose through a haze of <b>blowing</b> <b>dust,</b> hideous in their unadornment, against a crystalline sky, and a row of close-packed stock-cars which announced that they were in the station.|$|E
60|$|But mark what happened. As is not {{uncommon}} {{in the case of}} thunder showers, this rain fell upon the lands which the heathen cultivated {{on one side of the}} koppie, whereas those that belonged to the Christian section upon the other side received not a single drop. The unjust were bedewed, the just were left dry as bones. All that they received was the lightning, which killed an old man, one of the best Christians in the place. The limits of the torrent might have been marked off with a line. When it had passed, to the heathen right stood pools of water; to the Christian left there was nothing but <b>blowing</b> <b>dust.</b>|$|E

Also note the transport corridor of roads, railroads and conveyor belt system (vertical line at left) that transport phosphates 100 km (60 miles) from inland mines to the coast. Strong northerly winds <b>blow</b> <b>dust</b> and phosphate into the desert, giving a jagged edge to this line on its south side.|$|R
