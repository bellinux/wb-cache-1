25|$|The 2001–02 season, Tortorella's {{first full}} year behind the <b>bench,</b> <b>saw</b> some improvement. Martin St. Louis was having a {{breakout}} season when he broke his leg in game number 47 and was lost {{for the remainder of}} the season. Khabibulin recorded a shut out at the NHL All-Star Game but was not named its MVP, by all accounts due to the game's voting protocol. By mid-February, the Lightning were well out of playoff contention and were sinking under a rash of injuries. Dudley, who had guaranteed a playoff berth before the season, was fired and replaced by his assistant, Jay Feaster. Still the Lightning showed some signs of life, earning more than 60 points for the first time since 1997. Tortorella stripped Lecavalier of the captaincy due to contract negotiations that had made the young center miss the start of the season.|$|E
500|$|Three {{months after}} he started sitting as a judge he was {{transferred}} to the Court of King's Bench, where he was initially rather poor, being unfamiliar with the court's business. Within two years he showed [...] "the highest judicial excellence", and when Lord Ellenborough had a stroke in 1818, Abbott was chosen to replace him as Lord Chief Justice. His reign {{at the head of the}} Court of King's <b>Bench</b> <b>saw</b> the court flourish, with strong justices and his own much-admired abilities. He was appointed to the peerage in 1827, sitting as Charles Abbott, 1st Baron Tenterden, and initially attended the House of Lords regularly. His opposition to the Reform Act 1832, which he claimed treated city corporations [...] "with absolute contempt", led to his refusal to attend the Lords. Continuing to sit as Lord Chief Justice, Abbott gradually grew weaker, and finally fell ill halfway through a two-day trial. His disease baffled doctors, and he would die on 4 November 1832 at his home in Queen Square, London.|$|E

[...] The number of finger or hand amputations in the US has more recently been estimated to be 4000 annually, costing more than $2 billion a year to treat victims.|$|R
40|$|Commercial light {{curtains}} use {{a technique}} known as muting {{to differentiate between}} work pieces and other objects (e. g., human limbs) based on precise model knowledge of the process. At manually fed machinery (e. g., <b>bench</b> <b>saws),</b> such precise models cannot be derived due {{to the way the}} machinery is used. This paper presents a multispectral scanning sensor to classify an object's surface material as a new approach for the problem. The system is meant to detect the presence of limbs and therefore optimized for human skin detection. Evaluation on a test set of skin and (wet) wood samples showed a sufficiently high reliability with respect to safety standards...|$|R
60|$|The Place infield trotted to deep short-field; the outfielders {{moved out}} and swung around {{far to the}} right. Salisbury settled down in the box and {{appeared}} to put on extra effort as he delivered the ball. It was wide. The next also went off {{the outside of the}} plate. It looked as if Salisbury meant to pass Reddy to first. Then those on the <b>bench</b> <b>saw</b> a glance and a nod pass between Reddy Ray and Coach Arthurs. Again Salisbury pitched somewhat to the outside of the plate, but this time Reddy stepped forward and swung.|$|E
50|$|Guardado's {{first game}} {{under the new}} manager was against the United States: his {{introduction}} from the <b>bench</b> <b>saw</b> the game turn in Mexico's favor, but the game eventually ended with a 0-2 defeat. On 28 February 2007, in a friendly with Venezuela, he scored his first international goal.|$|E

50|$|The sawmill is {{a highly}} intact example of a small sawmill {{originally}} established to produce timber for packaging cases. The layout {{and all of the}} components typically found in a small mill of the 1950s remain including: the characteristic open-sided shed, early electrical insulators tracing the route of the original cabling, breakdown (Canadian) saw, number one and two <b>saw</b> <b>benches,</b> docking <b>saw,</b> original hand operated winch, rails and trolleys. The milling operation continues to follow the traditional packing case sequence of initial cut at the breakdown (Canadian) saw, sizing at the number one and two benches and cut to lengths at the docker.|$|R
50|$|In seven-member Molonglo, {{there was}} no change to {{representation}} from the 2001 ACT election with both Labor and the Liberals retaining three seats, and the Greens retaining one seat. Labor Deputy Chief Minister Ted Quinlan, and ministers Katy Gallagher and Simon Corbell all won re-election. The Liberal <b>benches</b> <b>saw</b> the re-election of one member, Jacqui Burke and two new members, Zed Seselja and Richard Mulcahy; following the retirement of longserving member and former Speaker, Greg Cornwell. Helen Cross, elected as a Liberal member at the 2001 ACT election, resigned from the Liberal Party in September 2002 to become an independent. Cross failed to get re-elected at the 2004 ACT election. The Greens sitting member, Kerrie Tucker, resigned from the Assembly less than one month before the election. The Greens endorsed Deb Foskey, who was elected as the sole Green in the Assembly.|$|R
5000|$|Sawmill shed Standing {{close to}} the road at the {{southeast}} corner of the site, the heart of the mill operations is an open timber framed shed with corrugated iron clad roofs. The main part is sheltered by a gable roof the north side of which extends west over the docker area and northeast with a small skillion roof over the number two bench. The shed is framed with sawn and unsawn timber, the roof supported by round posts. The compact milling operation is organised around the sequence of saws and the accompanying benches, motors, trolleys and rails accommodated within the shed. The saws stand in a line from the breakdown saw (Canadian saw) to the south to the number two <b>bench</b> <b>saw</b> to the north. Timber logs are stacked by forklift at the southwest, rolled onto a trolley where they are secured with a dog and run through the breakdown saw for the half cut. The cut logs then roll across to the number one <b>bench</b> <b>saw</b> where the bark is stripped and the half logs are cut into 2" [...] (50mm) or 2.5" [...] (62.5mm) width planks. The cut planks are stacked north of the number one bench and taken across to the number two <b>bench</b> <b>saw</b> where they are cut into thinner 1" [...] (25mm) boards which are stacked to the west and taken across to the docker where they are cut into shorter lengths (mostly 6 metres). From here the boards pass to the groover where the sides are grooved before being placed in the pallet stack west of the log stack. A number of trolleys on rails take the offcuts and waste from the various bench areas out to {{the west side of the}} shed.|$|E
50|$|Other useful {{power tools}} are a belt sander, {{especially}} if using recycled timber or for finishing rough-sawn timber. A thicknesser/planer is only needed if building many boats or larger vessels, {{as it is}} usually cheaper to pay a joiner {{to do this for}} a small amount of timber. A <b>bench</b> <b>saw</b> is useful if you buy larger sectioned timber, which may be considerably cheaper and need to saw it to the correct size, but again a timber yard will do this for a small charge.|$|E
50|$|The {{overhaul}} of the aldermanic <b>bench</b> <b>saw</b> the election of key figures from the liberal ranks. Having avoided the principle of electing from outside the Council four years previously this practice was now adopted once again, leading to criticism, most notably from the Liberal-supporting Cambrian News. It was noted in particular that three defeated candidates were elected, namely James Stevens at Cardigan, Daniel Jones of Llanon and Davies of Cwrtmawr. J.T. Morgan of Talybont was also re-elected although he had not contested the election.|$|E
50|$|The raised timber {{platform}} accommodates gantries, <b>benches,</b> <b>saws,</b> trolleys, {{tracks and}} stacking {{areas of the}} mill operations. Two earth mounds {{to the south of}} the shed facilitate loading of logs onto the platform by fork lift. A conveyor belt travels west from the centre of the platform to a burning area adjacent. The burning area is unroofed and enclosed with sheets of corrugated iron. A small room to the northeast corner of the platform is timber framed and clad with weatherboards and accommodates the saw sharpening facilities. Part of the platform extends unroofed to the east with a set of trolley tracks running out along the southern side - this extension gives the mill the capacity to saw very long logs. A set of timber stairs descends from the northeast to the engine room. A set of timber stairs also descends from {{the west side of the}} platform. The area below the platform accommodated the transmission shafts, pulleys and other elements of the steam-driven operation.|$|R

After {{a trip to}} the DL in July, Pierre was moved into a platoon in center field with the struggling Jones. When the Dodgers traded for Manny Ramirez, Pierre moved to the <b>bench</b> and <b>saw</b> limited action, primarily as a pinch runner the rest of the season.|$|R
50|$|After {{an initial}} period on the backbenches, Coveney was {{promoted}} to the Front Bench by Michael Noonan as deputy chief whip, remaining in this position until a 2002 reshuffle when he became Spokesperson on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources under Enda Kenny. A three-year period as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) {{was followed by a}} return to domestic politics in 2007 when he was appointed Spokesperson on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. A 2010 reshuffle of the Front <b>Bench</b> <b>saw</b> him take over as Spokesperson on Transport.|$|E

50|$|Heading {{into the}} second match of the series, Queensland had a host of injury {{concerns}} with Billy Slater, Greg Inglis and Daly Cherry-Evans all in significant doubt, whilst the man Cherry-Evans deputised for, Cooper Cronk, was suspected {{to be ruled out}} of the remainder of the series with a broken arm he suffered in the first game. As a result, Mal Meninga chose to carry 22 man squad into game two, where he would name Will Chambers, Ben Hunt, Jacob Lillyman, Anthony Milford and Willie Tonga as his reserves. Sam Thaiday returned from injury that ruled him of the first game to rejoin the starting forward pack. To further complicate matters, forwards Josh Papalii and Corey Parker would later rule themselves out with injury, forcing Meninga to announce David Taylor as another reserve. On game day, Slater, Inglis and Cherry-Evans would pass fitness to reprise their positions, with Thaiday named at lock and Aidan Guerra into the starting second row. Changes on the <b>bench</b> <b>saw</b> Taylor and Lilyman joining the demoted Chris McQueen.|$|E
50|$|Pledger played NCAA Division I {{basketball}} for two {{seasons with the}} University of Missouri Kansas City Kangaroos. In his freshman season, he saw action in eight games while playing sparingly off the <b>bench.</b> Pledger <b>saw</b> significantly more action in his sophomore year, playing in 29 of 32 games while starting 23 of them. He averaged 5.2 points and 4.7 rebounds per game and added 31 blocks, which ranked third in the Mid-Continent Conference.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This {{research}} paper explores {{the design of}} an automatic safety brake mechanism on a manual circular table saw machine which stops the blade from rotating when human flesh is detected in the blade proximity. Fatal injuries are occurring, human thumbs and entire hand cutting during operation when operator accidentally touches the spinning blade. It has {{become a matter of}} concern to develop the safety mechanism which can be retrofitted on old-model table saw machines used to train students at a university wood workshop. The researchers made use of capacitive proximity sensors to detect human flesh and then automatically activate the brake pawl to the rotating blade, D. C. injection brake voltage which abruptly stop the running motor. The design procedure confirmed the quick release of the safety mechanism within 0. 25 seconds as revealed from the simulation of circuits in Proteus software. With this design it is possible to stop the spinning blade in 0. 25 seconds, before the operator touches the spinning blade and also the mechanism is adoptable to all circular saw machines (panel <b>saw,</b> <b>bench</b> <b>saws),</b> thus making a work-safe environment on the circular saws...|$|R
5000|$|... 2007 - 08 saw the Crocs {{struggle}} {{in their first}} ten games, only winning three matches. Before the season, the team was struggling with injuries to both 7 foot centre's Ben Pepper (back) and Greg Vanderjagt (knee) along with swingman Bradley Sheridan (back). The team ended up losing newly signed import Rosell Ellis who suffered a freak of an injury when he tore his pectoral muscle during a weight session just after two matches. In those two matches saw Ellis get 27 points and 11 rebounds in both matches. The Crocs then brought in streetball legend Corey 'Homicide' Wiliams which saw the Crocs turn back into a strong team. With also help from the crocs <b>bench</b> <b>saw</b> them finish the season in fifth place {{with a record of}} 17-13. But just like the 2006-07 season, saw the crocs win their first game against another newcomer Gold Coast Blaze but were once again saw them smashed by the team who finished one win higher than the Crocs in the Perth Wildcats 96-78.|$|E

6000|$|There was {{a mighty}} {{platform}} covered with crimson cloth in {{the centre of}} the hall in front of the orchestra. On it were several mysterious objects covered with sheets. At a signal--a whistle--given by the Doctor, a band of sturdy boys, clad in their work-a-day uniform, scampered down the central passage of the hall, jumped on the platform, flung off the sheets, and discovered carpenters' <b>benches,</b> <b>saws,</b> hammers, wood--in short, all the appliances with which they carry on the various trades at their [...] "Home" [...] in the East End. In a few seconds, as if by magic, the platform was a workshop in full swing--hammering, sawing, chiselling, wood-chopping, clattering, and indescribable din, which was enhanced, but not drowned, by the applause of the astonished audience. The little fellows worked as though life depended on their activity, for the space, it seemed to me, of half a minute. Then the shrill whistle sounded again, and the work ceased, as if the springs of life had been suddenly cut off. Dead silence ensued; each worker remaining in the attitude in which he had been petrified--a group of artisan statuary in colour! ...|$|R
50|$|Apart from {{threshing}} work, portable engines {{were used}} to drive corn-mills, centrifugal pumps, stone-crushers, dynamos, chaff-cutters, hay-balers and <b>saw</b> <b>benches.</b> They were even used to generate electricity for floodlighting at football matches, the first instance being at Bramall Lane, Sheffield in 1878.|$|R
