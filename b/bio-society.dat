40|$|Tissue {{engineering}} is an emerging biomedical innovation surrounded by potentiality and risk. Based on documentary analysis and expert interviews, this study discusses different constructions of risk according to main constituencies (scientists, clinicians and manufacturers), {{the way they}} prioritise and balance these risks, and how issues are framed as problematic or not. Complexity and uncertainty are the main drivers in this exercise, interpreted in terms of boundary drawing around contested risk domains. This {{is followed by a}} discussion of the translation of risk into regulatory policy, by focusing on two recent legislative initiatives by the European Commission: one to control the quality and safety aspects of human tissues and cells (DG SANCO Directive) and the other to facilitate the marketing of tissue engineered products in the EU (DG Enterprise Regulation). These two legislative initiatives aim to overcome the current regulatory lag in Europe, where tissue engineered applications are either unregulated or subject to a broad variety in national controls. This situation is problematic for manufacturers wanting to market their products in Europe, for regulators in evaluating the risks of these technologies and defining an appropriate approval route, and for patients in terms of unequal access to potentially beneficial therapies across the continent. Firmly rooted in ambitions to make the EU a techno-scientific and bio-economic powerhouse, regulation of this domain is troubled by competing agendas of promoting trade versus protecting public health. Social and ethical considerations about the impact of tissue engineering technology allow a reconsideration of the <b>bio-society</b> as alternative model, taking into account the technological as well as social character of innovation.

This {{dissertation}} {{is about}} five alternative future scenarios of Korea {{in the year}} 2030 to increase {{our understanding of the}} long-term future of Korea. By adopting Jim Dator's Alternative Futures Scenarios method, the five alternative future scenarios include four alternative scenario archetypes (growth, discipline, collapse, and transformation) and a preferred future scenario. This research explores the key question of 'what will Korea look like in the year 2030 '. After reviewing Korea's history and current situation and existing forecasts of the futures of Korea, we bounded the uncertainty about the future through the five alternative scenarios. First, The Republic of Samsung scenario is an official view of the Korean future. It represents the continuation of the existing economic development. Korean society is following the predictable developmental trajectory from a developmental state society to corporate society. Second, in the Great Han River Flood in Warmer Korea Scenario, Korea encounters catastrophic weather events, contributed by global warming. This scenario {{can be seen as a}} degrowth society that is a natural outcome of a destructive river flood. Third, the A Big Global Family Phenomenon scenario challenges the consumption oriented attitude and materialistic nature. It originates from human oriented attitude and social justice. This scenario has charted out the emergence of cosmopolitan values in the context of trends moved toward rapid globalization, dominance of multilevel governance, and growth of global citizenship. Fourth, the Age of Biotechnology scenario is an attempt to realize the post-modern desire for progress through biotechnology. In this scenario Korea is becoming a <b>bio-society</b> due to the successful commercialization of biotechnological products. Fifth, the Peaceful Unification as a Dream Come True scenario is a preferred future. Its vision is the peaceful unification and an equitable and sustainable society. It covers a situation in which two Koreans develop a strong support for peaceful unification. Also it is based on a sustainable economy to secure economic growth and to focus on the quality of life. By developing five alternative scenarios, this dissertation addresses the implications of five alternative scenarios for Korea's future and suggests strategic action plans to move toward a preferred future...|$|E
