5|$|In 1935, Ruby {{founded the}} Colorado Ranger Horse Association (CRHA), and {{was granted a}} {{corporate}} charter for the association in 1938. Ruby remained president of the organization from 1935 {{until his death in}} 1942. The registry initially imposed a 50-member limit, and many Ranger horses, whose breeders were not allowed to become members, were instead registered with the Appaloosa Horse Club. The member limit was lifted in 1964, and since then pedigree research has continued to find and register horses with Ranger breeding that are un-registered or registered as Appaloosas. During the 1980s, some Lusitano blood was allowed into the breed, but this practice has been discontinued. The CRHA states that up to 1 in 8 registered Appaloosas may have Colorado Ranger blood, and as such be eligible for registry with the CRHA. As of 2005, there were more than 6,000 horses registered with the CRHA, with between 100 and 125 new horses registered annually. While originally bred in the western US, today many Colorado Rangers are found in the midwest and eastern parts of the country, including the states of Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania. They are also found in Canada, where {{there is at least one}} large <b>breeding</b> <b>farm.</b>|$|E
5|$|A 1977 {{inventory}} revealed only 44 Poitou donkeys worldwide, {{and there}} were still fewer than 80 animals as of 1980. Conservation efforts were led by several public and private groups in France. In 1979, the Haras Nationaux, (the French national stud) and the Parc Naturel Regional du Marais Poitevin, working with private breeders, launched an effort to improve the genetics of the Poitou, develop new breeding techniques and collect traditional knowledge on the breed. In 1981, 18 large donkeys from Portugal were acquired for use in breeding Poitou donkeys. This preceded {{the creation of the}} Asinerie Nationale Experimentale, which opened in Charente-Maritime in Dampierre-sur-Boutonne in 1982, as an experimental <b>breeding</b> <b>farm</b> for Poitous. The Parc also works to preserve the Poitevin horse breed. In 1988, the Association pour la Sauvegarde du Baudet du Poitou (SABAUD) was formed as a breeder network that focuses on marketing and fundraising for the breed, and in 1989 became the financial support arm of the Asinerie Nationale Experimentale. The Association des Éleveurs des Races Équine, Mulassière et Asine, Baudet du Poitou is the registering body for the Poitou donkey. The early conservation efforts were sometimes sidetracked as some breeders sold crossbred Poitous as purebreds, which are worth up to ten times as much. Forged pedigrees and registration papers were sometimes used to legitimize these sales. However, by the 1990s, DNA testing and microchip technology began to be used to identify and track purebred animals.|$|E

40|$|The {{importance}} of electrical energy for a contemporary society is increasing. However, {{most of people}} don´t realise possible consequences of power outage for agriculture. This thesis aims at presenting an analysis of power outage effects on agricultural breeding in MEC Soběslav area. Considering {{the aim of the}} thesis, there is a problem whether the selected <b>breeding</b> <b>farms</b> are ready enough for power outages. The theoretical part of the thesis characterises crisis management, integrated rescue system (IRS), critical infrastructure and electrical grid. The following part of the chapter deals with livestock, poultry and pig breeding, mainly {{from the point of view}} of their technological as well as technical equipment. The research part is based on pen and paper interviews with representatives and owners of <b>breeding</b> <b>farms.</b> The research was focused on a degree of dependency on electrical energy in MEC Soběslav area. Two <b>breeding</b> <b>farms</b> in Germany were selected for a comparison with the situation abroad. The results revealed that most of the <b>breeding</b> <b>farms</b> are strongly dependent on electrical energy. Thanks to the last modernisation, automatic feeding or water supplying became a common standard. Unfortunately, most of the modern <b>breeding</b> <b>farms</b> are not able to guarantee these procedures in case of power outage. Great amount of <b>breeding</b> <b>farms</b> don´t have any emergency sources of energy and those that own some, have only limited supplies of fuel. There are no contracts guaranteeing the fuel for the <b>breeding</b> <b>farms.</b> The most problematic situation concerns poultry breeding, where the breeding procedures are wholly controlled by information systems and even the minute failures cause massive losses. Therefore the research problem was confirmed because the <b>breeding</b> <b>farms</b> are not equipped for powers outages. This diploma thesis is supposed to be used for educational purposes or as the means of orientation in the problem for individual breeders. The purpose is the education of presented subjects...|$|R

5|$|Porter {{edited the}} Constellation, a {{newspaper}} in New York City that published humorous stories. Porter became interested in sports, and concentrated on the emerging sports journalism field. In December 1831, Porter published {{the first issue of}} a new newspaper devoted to covering sports and other recreational activities, which he called The Spirit of the Times. Porter imitated Bell's Life in London, a contemporary English publication covering the same subjects. The first attempt at Spirit of the Times failed quickly, and Porter sold the magazine to C. J. B. Fisher, who merged it into Fisher's publication of the Traveller, and the Spirit was combined with the Traveller as the Traveller and Spirit of the Times. During the brief period that Porter operated the Spirit, he employed Horace Greeley as a typesetter. When Porter sold the Spirit, he then went to work at the New-Yorker, which was edited at the time by Horace Greeley. In January 1835 Porter purchased the Traveller and Spirit of the Times and renamed the newspaper back to Spirit of the Times, returning to editing it. This version of the Spirit managed to survive, although with some initial financial difficulties. Porter focused on selling his paper in the south and west of the United States, and emphasized subjects of use to his readers, such as cattle <b>breeding,</b> <b>farm</b> methods, books of interest, as well as sports. The newspaper was published weekly.|$|E

500|$|Therefore, {{rather than}} being subject to {{crossbreeding}} itself, the Breton has instead been used to improve many other breeds. [...] Buyers come to France {{from all over the}} world to buy Bretons for use in improving their native draft horses. [...] The Breton had a significant influence on the Canadian Horse, after members of the breed were sent to New France (Canada) during the 17th century. They have also been used to create the Swiss Freiberger, as well as other heavy draft breeds. Bretons were used in India to produce mules, and at the Saharanpur <b>breeding</b> <b>farm</b> were crossed with the Anglo-Arabian stallion Mystère to produce carriage horses. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, Italian farmers attempted to use the Brabant to improve local stock, but the offspring proved to be too heavy and slow for the lighter, more general draft work required. In the 1930s, the Hispano-Bretón breed was developed in Spain by crossing imported Breton stallions with local mares. Today, the breed population is small, but has been noted by researchers for its rich genetic diversity. After World War II, a Breton stallion was used to improve the Schleswig breed of Germany.|$|E

One hundred and eighteen R. equi isolates were identified by biochemical tests and submitted to a specie-specific and vapA multiplex PCR.
