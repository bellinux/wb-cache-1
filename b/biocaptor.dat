Also the adsorption of heavy metals such as Cd 2 +, Zn 2 + and Ni 2 + on humic acid-polyaniline systems (HA-PEB) was investigated {{at the same}} conditions. HA-PEB compounds were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), infrared spectrometry and cavity microelectrode. In addition, batch adsorption and cavity microelectrode {{were used in the}} adsorption study of Cd 2 +, Zn 2 + and Ni 2 + on HA-PEB. To develop biocaptors of polluting metals using a cavity microelectrode modified by HA-PEB systems, the adsorption kinetic and adsorption capacity were investigated. The SEM analysis showed that the presence of humic acid affected the PEB surface and caused the formation of a granular morphology. The maximum adsorption capacities (q(max)) of PFHA, THA and YHA determined by adsorption isotherms were 91. 31, 132. 1 and 151. 0 mg/g, respectively. Batch adsorption results showed that q(max) of Cd 2 +, Zn 2 + and Ni 2 + on HA-PEB followed the order: THA-PEB > YHA-PEB > PFHA-PEB. The voltammograms obtained with HA-PEB modified cavity microelectrode showed the appearance of new redox couples reflecting the adsorption of HA on PEB. Metal-humic acid-polyaniline voltammograms were characterized by appearance of oxidation-reduction couples or reduction wave corresponding to metal. Finally, the result may be exploited to develop a <b>biocaptor</b> based on the cavity microelectrode amended by THA-PEB and YHA-PEB...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Escherichia coli is a {{microorganism}} {{widely used}} in the industry {{for the production of}} recombinant proteins. The performances obtained at the laboratory level are not reproducible at a large scale. Actually, the mixing operation is not efficient enough: gradients of glucose and oxygen appear when operating in fed-batch mode (addition of glucose during the culture). These gradients cause adverse impacts on the production of biomass and recombinant protein. The aim of this work is to use the microbial population as <b>biocaptor</b> of the encoutered stress inside heterogeneous industrial bioreactors to better scale-up and regulate these reactors. • MATERIALS AND METHODS: A plasmid carrying a stress promoter followed by the coding sequence of the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) is introduced in the bacterial host (in our case, the strain E. coli K 12 will be considered as a model organism). When the cell is submitted to given stress condition, GFP synthesis is induced and accumulated into the cytoplasm, leading to the increase of the cell's fluorescence. Flow cytometry detection is used in order to quantify the fluorescence at the single cell level. Obtained results are frequency histograms of fluorescenceintensity in the microbial population • RESULTS: The rpoS gene is a gene of the general stress response, mainly induced at the entrance to stationary phase (during a lack of glucose). The tracking of the GFP fluorescence linked to the activation / repression of the rpoS promoter gives good results. Indeed, there is appearance of a segregation {{at the level of the}} GFP content among the microbial population. The intensity of the segregation, as well as its time of appearance during the culture can be related to the bioreactor mixing efficiency. • CONCLUSION: prpoS::gfp strains can be used as biosensors of the heterogeneity of glucose encountered inside industrial reactors. • POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS & KEY BENEFITS: These strains could be used to validate a fed-batch regulation (addition of glucose) at the industrial level.
