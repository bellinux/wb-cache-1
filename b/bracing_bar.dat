40|$|The energy dissipators are passive {{components}} that {{are incorporated into}} buildings and other structures undergoing dynamic excitations, especially earthquakes. Its purpose is to absorb the greatest part of the input energy, thus protecting the main structure. These devices are {{not a part of}} the main load-carrying system and therefore can be easily replaced after suffering serious damage. These devices are connected to the structure to be protected in such a way that they experience large strains under the action of the earthquakes; such strains produce the energy absorption. In building structures, the dissipators are installed in frames, usually in concentric <b>bracing</b> <b>bars</b> (either diagonal or chevron braces) since the interstory drifts generate significant distortions in these elements. Various types of dissipators have been proposed for building structures. Those based on yielding of metals, commonly known as hysteretic, are distinguished by their simplicity, economy and robustness; among them, the so-called buckling restrained braces have experienced a remarkable development because of their important advantages. The buckling restrained braces consist of concentric <b>bracing</b> <b>bars</b> composed by a slender steel core surrounded by a stockier casing, usually made of mortar and / or steel. It is crucial that there is a sliding interface between the core and the cover, to prevent relevant shear stress transfer. When the core is pulled or pushed it yields; the casing prevents the buckling of the core. These cycles of tensile and compressive yielding constitute the hysteresis loops through which the energy is dissipated. Despite relevant experience exists on buckling restrained braces (both on research and practical applications) many questions still remain unanswered. In particular, no reliable and accurate model of the structural behavior has been proposed. This lack prevents a deep understanding of the complex phenomena that occur during the operation of these elements, and hinders the development of innovative solutions. This work aims to improve the knowledge about the behavior of these devices, developing a comprehensive numerical model that opens the door for future developments. The results obtained with the proposed numerical model are compared with experimental results obtained at the University of Girona and the University of California.

40|$|In {{the paper}} some topics {{relevant}} to the design procedure and the seismic performance of steel concentrically braced frames (CBFs) are addressed. The design proposal of Eurocode 8 for CBFs is analysed {{in view of the}} application to fairly complex structural systems. Application of the “tension only” concept, to be used in strength verifications against ultimate-limit-state seismic effects, is applied employing a new strategy based upon the definition of a set of static equivalent seismic forces, computed from response spectrum analysis. Energy dissipation due to interaction between beams and diagonals in macro-bracing systems is also ad-dressed. The dynamic response of a complete 3 -D structural system, encompassing several frames with different brac-ing solutions, is studied by means of a step-by-step numerical procedure implemented in an in house devel-oped computer code. Non-linear response of <b>bracing</b> <b>bars</b> due to element buckling and inelastic material be-haviour, as well as non-linear response of beams interacting with macro-bracing systems is considered. Results, given either in terms of displacements and interstory drift envelopes or braces and beams hysteretic behavior, show higher modes and torsional effects importance. Effects of connection detailing, which may jeopardize bracing ductility is also considered through the introduction of a "death" option for bracing diago-nals exceeding a predeterminate ductility in tension...|$|R

5000|$|The Lancer {{platform}} {{was completely}} changed in 1996, {{and along with}} it, the Evolution, which had become extremely popular throughout the world. The engine and transaxle was rotated 180° to better balance the weight and eliminate torque steer. There were two versions available, The RS and GSR. The RS version was produced as a competition car with a limited-slip front differential and a friction type LSD at the rear. It also came with GLX seats and a choice of either 16" [...] or 17" [...] OZ light weight racing wheels. The RS also had wind up windows, optional air conditioning in some models, and a few extra <b>brace</b> <b>bars</b> to strengthen the chassis, one behind the front grill and the other across the boot floor. The GSR and the RS shared a new twin scroll turbocharger which helped to improve response and increase power to [...] at 6,500 rpm and [...] torque at 4,000 rpm. Mitsubishi's new Active Yaw Control appeared as a factory option on the GSR model, which used steering, throttle input sensors and g sensors to computer-hydraulically control torque split individually to the rear wheels {{and as a result}} the 10000 Evolution IVs produced all sold quickly. The Evolution IV can be distinguished by its two large fog lights in the front bumper (option on RS version), and the newly designed tail lights on the rear, which became a standard design to Evolution V, which would become yet another trademark of the Evolution series. This new generation was slightly heavier than previous Evos—the GSR in particular due to the added technology systems—but to counter this the car produced even more power—the weight of the RS being 1260 kg and the GSR being 1345 kg. Much of the technical improvements for this generation were also used in the second generation Mitsubishi RVR sold only in Japan.|$|R

5000|$|PETSCII {{also has}} a text mode, in which {{lowercase}} letters occupy the range $41 - $5A, and uppercase letters occupy the range $C1 - $DA. The text mode is not available at powerup, but must be actuated by holding one of the SHIFT keys and then press and release the Commodore key. Regardless of whether the chip has undergone this graphic [...] "shift", there are block graphic characters {{in the range of}} $E0-FF. This serves to distinguish PETSCII from those kinds of ASCII that go back no farther than ASCII-1967, so any text transfer between an 8-bit Commodore machine and one that uses 1967-derived ASCII would result in text where uppercase letters appear to be lowercase, and lowercase letters uppercase. There is no easy Boolean operation to change these cases to the proper case. Thus, as with other computers based on non-standard-ASCII character sets, software conversion is needed when exchanging text files and/or telecommunicating with standard ASCII systems.

50|$|Suspension tuning {{involves}} {{modifying the}} springs, shock absorbers, swaybars, {{and other related}} components of a vehicle. Shorter springs offer greater stiffness and a lower center of gravity at the possible cost of unwanted changes of suspension geometry. Stiffer shock absorbers improve the dynamic weight shifting during cornering and normally have shorter internals {{to stop them from}} bottoming out when shorter springs are used. Stiffer sway bars reduce body roll during cornering, thus improving the grip that the tires have on the surface by reducing suspension geometry changes caused by roll; this also improves handling response due to faster weight shifting (similar to stiffer springs.) The danger with overly stiff swaybars is the lifing of the inner wheel, which changes traction of that end at a discontinuous rate. By increasing the roll resistance of on end, weight transfer is concentrated at that end, causing it to slip more than the other. This effect is used to control the over/under steer characteristic as well as to reduce roll. Other components that are sometimes added are strut bars, which improve the body stiffness and help better maintain the proper suspension geometry during cornering. On some cars certain <b>braces,</b> anti-roll <b>bars,</b> etc., can be retrofitted to base model cars from sports models.|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} seismic {{retrofit}} techniques {{have been developed}} {{in order to prevent}} collapse of the buildings and bridges, which were constructed according to the old seismic design code, from earthquake attack. The seismic retrofit techniques are classified into three categories, namely, improving ductility, strength and reduction of seismic load. By paying {{attention to the fact that}} the transverse confinement of concrete is very useful in order to improve ductility for RC members subjected to compression, a new seismic retrofit technique is proposed as one of improving ductility for RC columns in this paper. The technique is an active confinement by PC bar prestressing. There are two arrangements in this seismic retrofit technique. One is to arrange PC bars through corner blocks or corner angles around the RC column as if external hoops and then to introduce prestressing by torque wrench. The other one is to arrange diagonal <b>braces</b> by PC <b>bars</b> in addition to the above-mentioned PC bar prestressing on the top and bottom parts of RC column in case of very short columns. Both techniques are easy to apply to the seismic retrofit of columns with or without wall or window and also beam-column connections.

40|$|LecturePg. 93 - 102 Test stand {{vibration}} {{measurements on}} a partially loaded 54, 000 hp, parallel shaft, double helical speed increaser revealed synchronous resonant vibrations near normal operating speed. Further testing confirmed the lateral critical {{speed of the}} pinion was lower than originally designed due to modifications applied while the gear unit was in the test stand, which were aimed at lowering bearing pad operating temperatures under full load field conditions. The lateral critical speed was seen to increase as expected by sequentially removing the coupling spacer, adapter plate, and the hub. However, resulting vibration measurements showed a resonance remained near running speed. Impact testing pointed to a structural, resonant axial motion of the gear case near rated operating speed. Finite element analyses of the gear unit confirmed the existence of two structural resonances with endwall breathing mode shapes near pinion speed. Excitation {{of one of these}} modes was provided by coupling unbalance on the rotating pinion shaft that demonstrated cross-coupling of radial forces due to unbalance and axial structural motions. The near coincidence of the structural resonance and the lateral critical speed on the test stand provided vibration amplification above that normally expected due to either resonant condition alone. Amplification factors were moderate and significant overlap occurred between the flanks of the two resonances. A two-step solution was implemented to increase the resonant frequencies of both the shaft in its oil film bearings and the gear case end walls. First, a bearing clearance and preload modification were applied along with additional hot oil removal techniques. Second, a tie <b>bar</b> <b>brace</b> was added above and parallel to the pinion between the end walls of the upper section of the gear case to increase structural stiffness in an axial direction. Additional rotordynamic and finite element analyses predicted significantly improved response to unbalance. The bearing and structural modifications were installed and tested sequentially. These tests, under similar conditions as previously imposed on the unit for qualification and acceptance, were successful in proving the solution. This paper documents measured vibrations at various stages in the investigation, results of rotordynamic and finite element analyses, bearing and gear case modifications, and final successful tests...|$|R
