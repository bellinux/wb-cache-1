50|$|A Redirection of Transfer {{charge is}} {{included}} in bank charges and are only required on specific transfer occasions only. A redirection fee is a <b>bank</b> <b>charge</b> that is only paid to a bank when a mistake is made by another bank and a sum of amount is transferred into a wrong bank account in another bank. This may occur between continents,countries or states. A redirection fee is often expensive when required as the bank requiring this may not have legal rights to freeze the account the funds are mistakenly transferred into. It may also require urgent attention depending on the banking rules {{of the country and}} it takes a period of 30-45 minutes for a redirected transfer to be completed. This is normally caused in a Bank Wire Transfer, Telegraphic Transfer also known as Telex Transfer (T/T) and most times, local bank to bank transfer. A redirection fee is only needed to be paid to the bank the funds are in and the bank will have to redirect the transfer to its correct destination. Most banks calculate this type of <b>bank</b> <b>charge</b> according to the amount in question.|$|E

40|$|Inductive Pulsed Plasma Thrusters (IPPTs) are {{a type of}} in-space {{propulsion}} {{that has}} multiple advantages over conventional chemical propulsion for long-duration, deep space missions. Existing IPPT prototypes utilize spark gap switches, however these are subject to corrosion problems that make them unreliable for long-term use. Recent advances in solid state switching technology have opened up a variety of switching options that could provide greater reliability, controllability, and increased energy efficiency. Taking advantage of this, a novel thruster drive circuit topology containing a high-power silicon controlled rectifier (SCR) and series fast recovery diode (FRD) is proposed {{that is expected to}} increase the recapture efficiency of the thruster drive circuit, defined as the percentage of energy that remains on the capacitor bank following a single discharge cycle. A conventional Si FRD from ABB and a prototype Silicon Carbide (SiC) PiN diode from Cree, Inc. were characterized and tested as part of an IPPT solid state switching module on the Flat-Plate Thruster (FPT) developed and constructed at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) Electric Propulsion Thruster Development Laboratory. Preliminary analytical characterization of the devices, including static performance, dynamic (switching) performance, and thermal analysis is described, as well as the construction of the FPT thruster and the experimental setup used for thruster switching data collection. Collected experimental data shows that the proposed drive circuit topology results in a 20 % higher recapture efficiency as compared to a topology containing no series diode. In addition, the superior reverse recovery characteristics of the Cree SiC diode as compared with the ABB Si diode result in an additional gain in recapture efficiency of approximately 5 % across a range of capacitor <b>bank</b> <b>charge</b> voltages.
