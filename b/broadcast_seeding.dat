40|$|Graduation date: 1969 An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine the best method to establish subterranean clover on medusahead infested ranges in Western Oregon. Secondary objectives of this study were to determind the effects of management treatments on (a) subterranean clover density, (b) density of medusahead and other vegetation, and (c) yield of subterranean clover. Four treatments for establishing subterranean clover were compared including two seeding methods superimposed over six old treatments for controlling medusahead. The results of this experiment are as follows: Subterranean clover density was found to be significantly higher early in the season in the sod plus <b>broadcast</b> <b>seeded</b> area, in all but the chemically treated areas, when compared with the sod seeded area. The number of subterranean clover plants per square foot in May was significantly higher in the sod plus <b>broadcast</b> <b>seeded</b> areas in all but the chemical treatment. There was a great loss of subterranean clover plants in both methods of seeding from March through April; this was due to poor nodulation. Vegetation density was significantly lower in the chemical-mowed and sheep-grazed treatments in May. Medusahead density was lower in only the chemical-mowed treatment. It appears that removing the old vegetation before applying paraquat makes the chemical more effective in controlling medusahead and other vegetation. The yield of vegetation other than subterranean clover ranged from 1, 871 to 2, 437 pounds per acre. The yield of vegetation in the chemical-mowed and sheep-grazed treatment was significantly lower than in the mechanical and control treatment. Subterranean clover yields, which were highest in the sod plus <b>broadcast</b> <b>seeded</b> areas, ranged from 22 to 397 pounds per acre. The chemical-unmowed treatment along with a previous control treatment had the highest yield: the lowest yield was obtained in the mechanical treatment combined with a late grazed treatment. Low yields of subterranean clover were attributed to lack of nodulation which probably was caused by dessication of rhizobja prior to sowing (a 24 hour delay in <b>broadcast</b> inoculated <b>seed),</b> drying after seeding because of poor coverage in drill rows and lack of available phosphorus. In establishing subterranean clover on similar sites, reduction of vegetation would be of prime importance. Prior grazing would be beneficial as shown, but because of the unpalatable and low nutritional value of annual grasses in summer and autumn, vegetation removal might depend on use of fire or mechanical means, with or without herbicides. For stand establishment sod- seeding was more effective than broadcasting the seed. A higher rate of seeding is suggested when surface broadcasting seed onto undisturbed soil. Continued work on establishing of subterranean clover on medusahead infested sites should include the variables mentioned above...|$|R

40|$|Ecological theory {{predicts that}} the {{arrangement}} of seedlings in newly restored communities may influence future species diversity and composition. We test the prediction that smaller distances between neighboring seeds in drill seeded grassland plantings would result in lower species diversity, greater weed abundance, and larger conspecific patch sizes than otherwise similar <b>broadcast</b> <b>seeded</b> plantings. A diverse grassland seed mix was either drill seeded, which places seeds in equally spaced rows, or <b>broadcast</b> <b>seeded,</b> which spreads seeds across the ground surface, into 24 plots in each of three sites in 2005. In summer 2007, we measured species abundance in a 1 m 2 quadrat in each plot and mapped common species within the quadrat by recording the most abundant species in each of 64 cells. Quadrat-scale diversity and weed abundance were similar between drilled and broadcast plots, suggesting that processes that limited establishment and controlled invasion were not affected by such fine-scale seed distribution. However, native warm-season (C 4) grasses were more abundant and occurred in less compact patches in drilled plots. This difference in C 4 grass abundance and distribution may result from increased germination or vegetative propagation of C 4 grasses in drilled plots. Our findings suggest that local plant density may control fine-scale heterogeneity and species composition in restored grasslands, processes {{that need to be}} further investigated to determine whether seed distributions can be manipulated to increase diversity in restored grasslands...|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] Critical {{wildlife}} habitat supporting mule deer, antelope, and sage grouse in high elevation rangeland and sagebrush ecosystems of southwest Wyoming {{is threatened by}} an expanding population and energy exploration and development. Our objective was to evaluate native shrub species establishment for restoration after disturbance. In October 2005, on a well-pad disturbance, 16 accessions of 13 native shrub species were drill-seeded in single species plots in a randomized complete block design with four replications. Also, two seed mixtures (Bridger and Shell) of grass, forb, and shrub species were broadcast- or drill-seeded, and one seed mixture (Shell) was hydro-seeded to separate areas outside of the replicated plots. Densities were sampled in September 2007. By 2007, nine of the 16 shrub accessions established in the replicated plots. Atriplex aptera had the greatest establishment at six plants/m 2 followed by Atriplex canescens at four plants/m 2. Establishment of the other seven accessions was similar and ranged from two to 0. 4 plants/m 2. Where the Bridger mix was <b>broadcast</b> <b>seeded,</b> Artemisia tridentata ssp. wyomingensis, Atriplex aptera, and Krascheninnikovia lanata establishment was estimated at 10, 000, 6, 770, and 1, 120 plants/ha, respectively.

40|$|Seedigation {{is the use}} of {{a moving}} {{sprinkler}} irrigation system to <b>broadcast</b> <b>seeds</b> on the soil surface. Seed germination, plant characteristics and yield for grain sorghum, winter wheat and soybeans that were seedigated and conventionally planted are compared. When the seeding rates for seedigation were increased above that for conventional planting, and adequate moisture was available for germination, grain sorghum and wheat seedigated on tilled surfaces produced yields similar to conventionally planted crops. Seedigation of soybeans into fallow conditions, or when used as a relay crop, was unsuccessful. Shallow disking following seedigation did not improve germination or yield of grain sorghum or winter wheat. Using seedigation to plant wheat into soybeans offers good potential.

40|$|Preliminary {{information}} {{on the effectiveness of}} trimethacarb as a bird repellent on <b>broadcast</b> <b>seed</b> and ripening crops was obtained during 1982 and 1983 from studies in Haiti, India, the Philippines, Bangladesh, Mali, and the United States. R 50 and LD 50 determinations for nine pest bird species to cereal crops in these countries indicated birds were not as sensitive to trimethacarb as to the avian repellent methiocarb. Rice and millet seed germination was not inhibited at 0. 125 and 0. 25 % treatment levels. Wheat seed germinated well at treatments of ≤ 0. 5 % in Bangladesh. Sorghum seed did not germinate as well at any treatment level. Trimethacarb treatments on <b>broadcast</b> wheat <b>seed</b> in Bangladesh protected exposed seed from bird damage. Field trial demonstrations suggested trimethacarb applications of at least 4 kg a. i. /ha to ripening grain are needed to reduce bird damage. Degradation of a 4 -kg a. i. /ha trimethacarb application on rice and sorghum was rapid with residue levels of 0. 10 ppm and 0. 68 ppm, respectively, remaining on the seed at harvest. These encouraging results, and the fact that trimethacarb is available in many developing countries, suggest that the chemical should be more extensively evaluated...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Production of the fodder legume, Lathyrus sativus, was {{studied in}} the rice fields of farmers to {{mitigate}} a shortage of fodder supply to dairy cattle and to improve soil fertility. Eight farmers <b>broadcast</b> <b>seed</b> of the fodder legume as a relay crop in standing Aman rice. Fodder yield was recorded and soil fertility was assessed. Fodder was harvested after 2 months and fed to milking cows by mixing with straw. Average green yield of fodder was 11. 02 t/ha and soil OM and nitrogen were increased {{as a result of}} legume growth. Milk yield was increased by 20 % and 14 % in on-farm and research station studies respectively, and milk composition slightly increased due to the supplementation of straw with fodder. It may be concluded that the integration of a fodder legume into a rice-based cropping system is a practical solution to fodder shortage and that it restores soil fertility and improves milk yield and milk composition of dairy cows...|$|R

50|$|The {{sowing time}} {{starts with the}} first rainfalls. This can vary {{depending}} on the variety and the geographical area of cultivation. The grains used for sowing are the best grains kept from the precedent harvest and are sown by hand (<b>broadcast</b> <b>seeding).</b> Sometimes the seeds are mixed with sand to have a more homogenous repartition on the soil. The seeds remain on the surface, so successive harrowing by hand or with the daba is needed to bury them slightly in the soil. Normally 30-40 kg/ha of seeds are used, but sometimes more than 70 kg/ha are sown, in order to control weeds at time of emergence. For germination and emergence a temperature of 30 °C is optimal. The germination and growth is rapid, and for the upkeep of the crop only weeding is needed.|$|E
50|$|Weeds are {{the major}} biotic {{stresses}} for finger millet cultivation. Its seeds are very small, {{which leads to a}} relatively slow development in early growing stages. This makes finger millet a weak competitor for light, water and nutrients compared with weeds. In East and Southern Africa, the closely related species Eleusine indica (common name Indian goose grass) is a severe weed competitor of finger millet. Especially in early growing stages of the crop and the weed and when <b>broadcast</b> <b>seeding</b> instead of row seeding is applied (as often the case in East Africa), the two species are very difficult to distinguish. Besides Eleusine indica, the species Xanthium strumarium, which is animal disperesed and the stolon-owning species Cyperus rotondus and Cynodon dactylon are important finger millet weeds. Measures to control weeds include cultural, physical and chemical methods. Cultural methods could be sowing in rows instead of broadcast sowing in order to make distinction between finger millet seedlings and Eleusine indica easier when hand weeding. ICRISAT promotes cover crops and crop rotations to discrupt the growing cycle of the weeds. Physical weed control in financial resource limited communities growing finger millet are mainly hand weeding or weeding with a hand hoe.|$|E
50|$|While {{complete}} contract {{theory is}} useful for explaining the terms of agricultural contracts, such as the sharing percentages in tenancy contracts (Steven N. S. Cheung, 1969), agency costs are typically needed to explain their forms. For example, piece rates are preferred for labor tasks where quality is readily observable, e.g. sharpened sugar cane stalks ready for planting. Where effort quality is difficult to observe, e.g. the uniformity of <b>broadcast</b> <b>seeds</b> or fertilizer, wage rates tend to be used. Allen and Lueck (2004) have found that farm organization is strongly influenced by diversity {{in the form of}} moral hazard such that crop and household characteristics explain the nature of the farm, even the lack of risk aversion. Roumasset (1995) finds that warranted intensification (e.g. due to land quality) jointly determines optimal specialization on the farm, along with the agency costs of alternative agricultural firms. Where warranted specialization is low, peasant farmers relying on household labor predominate. In high value-per-hectare agriculture, however, there is extensive horizontal specialization by task and vertical specialization between owner, supervisory personnel and workers. These agency theories of farm organization and agricultural allow for multiple shirking possibilities, in contrast to the principal-agency version of sharecropping and agricultural contracts (Stiglitz, 1974, 1988, 1988) which trades-off labor shirking vs. risk-bearing.|$|R

30|$|In Australia (as {{elsewhere}} worldwide), {{federal agencies}} have {{invested heavily in}} a number of restoration projects over the last two decades, whereby, in 2000 / 2001 alone, $A 36.4 million was allocated to re-establish native vegetation and appropriate wildlife habitats (Wilkins et al., 2003). Environment Australia’s major on-ground commitments from its $A 27.1 million Bushcare funding program included i) the direct seeding of 10, 000  ha of degraded land, ii) the planting of 4.5 million seedlings, and iii) the erection of 12, 000  km of protective fencing (Wilkins et al., 2003). These figures clearly reflect the overall concern shown for restoration and re-instatement of native ecosystems in Australia. However, despite substantial financial and human investment toward on-the-ground restoration efforts, little has been invested in monitoring of these efforts to assess whether the desired ecological outcomes have been achieved. In fact, in a review by Brooks and Lake (2007), it was reported that of the 2, 247 restoration projects undertaken in four catchment areas in Victoria, only 315 (14 %) included some form of monitoring, mostly using photographic records. As a consequence, in most restoration projects the on-ground outcome is largely untested, and so planned vegetation restoration strategies are seldom guided by site-specific evidence-based information. Even simple measures, such as the relative performance of <b>broadcast</b> <b>seed</b> and planted seedlings, or the level of natural recruitment of indigenous species, are rarely recorded. Therefore, basic reporting of restoration performance (albeit an unglamorous undertaking) would provide a beneficial insight into landscape-scale restoration successes and challenges which could usefully inform future practices.|$|R

The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the effectiveness of contour furrows, drill seeding, and aeration treatments in capturing overland flow, concentrating resources, and establishing perennial bunch grasses to convert dysfunctional semiarid rangeland to a functional rangeland. The site, located on the Edwards Plateau in west Texas, USA, had bare, structurally crusted soils with sparse short-grasses (Scleropogon brevifolius). The site had a low infiltration rate contributing to excess overland flow and loss of nutrients, organic matter, and soil. Contour furrows were installed with varying intra-furrow distances (0. 6 to 61 m) and then <b>broadcast</b> <b>seeded</b> to determine if furrow spacing would produce a vegetative response. Portions of the intra-furrow areas were aerated and drill seeded. All seed mixes contained warm season, perennial bunch grasses (Bouteloua curtipendula, Leptochloa dubia, and Setaria leucopila). Soil beneath furrows had greater soil water content (p-value < 0. 05) than intra-furrow areas. Furrow plots had greater density of seeded grasses and total vegetation (19 individuals m- 2 and 191 individuals m- 2, respectively) than intra-furrow plots (0 individuals m- 2 and 89 individuals m- 2, respectively). This study supports other findings that suggest 1. 5 m to 1. 8 m is optimum intra-furrow spacing. Vegetative responses to drill seeding and aeration treatments were insignificant.

30|$|Although the {{restoration}} project at Nurcoung is relatively new, results obtained from this study, to date, show that restoration efforts {{appear to be}} promising {{as evidenced by the}} significant number of planted seedlings and <b>broadcast</b> <b>seeds</b> that are established and surviving. As Audet et al. (2013) found, restored sites are travelling on a positive trajectory when the desired ecosystem characteristics are starting to establish there. Some of the desired ecosystem characteristics are now starting to establish in the restored Nurcoung sites. However, it will take a considerable amount of time for this to become a fully functioning ecosystem (Doley and Audet, 2013). It is only then that {{we would be able to}} determine whether it is a natural or novel system (Shackelford et al., 2013 a; Shackelford et al., 2013 b). As Monie et al. (2013) pointed out in their conclusion, seedling recruitment is one of the useful parameters in detecting development trends towards a sustainable restoration target, but it will be some time before we could determine any long-term resemblance to the pre-disturbance conditions. Restoring native biodiversity and ecosystem function among degraded landscapes is, of course, technically and financially demanding (Menz et al., 2013). Hence, it is necessary to assess ongoing ecological trajectories dispassionately and, when possible, using multiple indicators of ecosystem development and resilience. Ultimately, our findings support the convergence of rehabilitated sites toward reference communities. Then again, it should be recognized that, where sites may diverge from intended (or aspirational) targets, intervention should be required to achieve the highest ecological outcome, regardless of whether these are deemed natural, hybrid, or novel (Doley and Audet, 2013; Perring et al., 2013).|$|R

The plots had been previously planted in the spring of 1978 with 2 - 0 bare root Douglas-fir nursery stock. Two sections were interplanted with red alder, and two sections were <b>broadcast</b> <b>seeded</b> with grass the following year. Measurements indicate that Douglas-fir growth is inhibited by red alder and grass competition as well as competition from other Douglas-fir. Grass competition is severe only during the initial years of the plantation, while red alder competition becomes more pronounced with time. Growth is a function of density, competitor type, and site, and significant interactions occur among the three. Leaf area per tree of Douglas-fir under competition can be predicted by leaf weight, stand density, and competitor type. The formation of shade needles in response to density and competitor type increases the leaf area:leaf weight ratio. Growth efficiency (stemwood volume production/unit of leaf area) is not highest for the most vigorous trees. On a per hectare basis, high productivity is correlated with high leaf area index, but the relation is reversed on a per tree basis...|$|R
60|$|The {{prevailing}} {{ignorance of}} English in the English-speaking communities, enormously hampers {{the development of}} the racial consciousness. Except for those who wish to bawl the crudest thoughts, there is no means of reaching the whole mass of these communities to- day. So far as material requirements go {{it would be possible to}} fling a thought <b>broadcast</b> like <b>seed</b> over the whole world to-day, it would be possible to get a book into the hands of half the adults of our race. But at the hands and eyes one stops--there is a gap in the brains. Only thoughts that can be expressed in the meanest commonplaces will ever reach the minds of the majority of the English-speaking peoples under present conditions.|$|R
