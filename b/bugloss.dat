25|$|The {{island of}} Tenerife has a {{remarkable}} ecological diversity {{in spite of}} its small surface area, which is a consequence of the special environmental conditions on the island, where its distinct orography modifies the general climatic conditions at a local level, producing a significant variety of microclimates. This diversity of natural microclimates and, therefore, habitats, means that a rich and diverse flora (1400 species of plants) exists on the island, with well over a hundred entirely endemic to Tenerife. Endemic species include Viper's <b>bugloss,</b> Teide white broom, Teide violet etc. The fauna of the island has many endemic invertebrates and unique reptile, bird and mammal species. The fauna of Tenerife includes some 400 species of fish, 56 birds, five reptiles, two amphibians, 13 land mammals and several thousand invertebrates, along with several species of sea turtles, whales and dolphins.|$|E
500|$|A {{variety of}} plants produce red dyes, {{including}} {{a number of}} lichens, henna, alkanet or dyer's <b>bugloss</b> (Alkanna tinctoria), asafoetida and dyer's madder Rubia tinctorum. [...] Madder and related plants of the genus [...] Rubia [...] are native to many temperate zones around the world, and were already used as sources of good red dye, such as rose madder, in prehistory. [...] Madder has been identified on linen in the tomb of Tutankhamun, and Pliny the Elder records madder growing near Rome. Madder was a dye of commercial importance in Europe, being cultivated in the Netherlands and France to dye the red coats of military uniforms until the market collapsed following the development of synthetic alizarin dye in 1869. [...] Madder was also used to dye the [...] "hunting pinks" [...] of Great Britain.|$|E

Within the Las Cañadas caldera and at higher altitudes, plant species endemic to the Teide National Park include: the Teide white broom (Spartocytisus supranubius), which has white flowers; Descurainia bourgaeana, a shrubby crucifer with yellow flowers; the Canary Island wallflower (Erysimum scoparium), which has violet flowers; and the Teide <b>bugloss</b> (Echium wildpretii), whose red flowers form a pyramid up to [...] in height. The Teide daisy (Argyranthemum teneriffae) can be found at altitudes close to [...] above sea level, and the Teide violet (Viola cheiranthifolia) can be found right up to the summit, making it the highest flowering plant in Spain.|$|E

60|$|When I went, {{during school}} hours, {{to give a}} talk to the children, there I found Mab, one of the forty, sitting with her book, which told her nothing, in her little hands. She listened to the talk with an {{appearance}} of interest, although understanding nothing, her <b>bugloss</b> eyes on me, encouraging me with a very sweet smile, whenever I looked her way.|$|E
60|$|It {{was better}} so, {{seeing that the}} other {{character}} possessed my whole heart. She was not intellectual; {{no one would have}} said of her, for example, that she would one day blossom into a second Emily Bronte; that to future generations her wild moorland village would be the Haworth of the West. She was perhaps something better--a child of earth and sun, exquisite, with her flossy hair a shining chestnut gold, her eyes like the <b>bugloss,</b> her whole face like a flower or rather like a ripe peach in bloom and colour; we are apt to associate these delicious little beings with flavours as well as fragrances. But I am not going to be so foolish as to attempt to describe her.|$|E
60|$|Undoubtedly he was right; {{the blue}} sky, fair weather, the open air, was a {{suggestion}} of the blue flower. It amazed {{me to think of}} the years I had spent under blue skies and of all I had felt about blue flowers, without stumbling upon this very simple fact. So simple, so near to the surface that you no sooner hear it than you imagine you have always known it! It was impossible to look at blue flowers and not be convinced of its truth, especially when the flowers were spread over considerable areas, as when I looked at wild hyacinths in the spring woods, or followed the interminable blue band of the vernal squill on the west Cornish coast, or saw large arid tracts of land in Suffolk blue with viper's <b>bugloss.</b>|$|E
6000|$|A {{poor old}} Widow in her weeds [...] Sowed her garden with wild-flower seeds; [...] Not too shallow, {{and not too}} deep, [...] And down came April -- drip -- drip -- drip. [...] Up shone May, like gold, and soon [...] Green as an arbour grew leafy June. [...] And now all summer she sits and sews [...] Where willow herb, comfrey, <b>bugloss</b> blows, [...] Teasle and pansy, meadowsweet, [...] Campion, toadflax, and rough hawksbit; [...] Brown bee orchis, and Peals of Bells; [...] Clover, burnet, and thyme she smells; [...] Like Oberon's meadows her garden is [...] Drowsy from dawn to dusk with bees. [...] Weeps she never, but {{sometimes}} sighs, [...] And peeps at her garden with bright brown eyes; [...] And all she has is all she needs -- [...] A poor Old Widow in her weeds.|$|E
6000|$|Money! Money!--a few even of my {{handfuls of}} that, and I was free. I would teach [...] "them" [...] a lesson. I would redeem myself. Ah, if only I {{had had a}} {{fraction}} of Fanny's courage, should I so long have remained wilting and festering at No. 2? The sweet, sharp juices of the clumsy fruit quenched my thirst. To and fro swept the bees along their airy highway. A spiked tree of late-blooming <b>bugloss</b> streamed its blue and purple into my eyes. A year ago, {{the very thought of}} exhibiting myself for filthy (or any kind of) lucre would have filled me with unspeakable shame. But what else had I been doing those long, dragging months? What had Miss M. hired herself out to be but a pot of caviare to the gourmets? Puffed up with conceit and complacency, I had been merely feeding on the world's contempt sauced up as flattery. Nonsensical child.|$|E
60|$|Some purple flowers {{stand next}} in our regard {{on account of}} their {{nearness}} in colour to the pure blue. The wild hyacinth, blue-bottle, violet, and pansy, and some others, will occur to every one. These are the purple flowers in which blue predominates, and on that account have the same expression as the blue. The purples in which red predominates are akin in expression to the reds, and are associated with flesh-tints and blood. And here it may {{be noted that the}} blue and blue-purple flowers, which have the greatest charm for us, are those in which not only the colour of the eye but some resemblance in their form to the iris, with its central spot representing the pupil, appears. For example, the flax, borage, blue geranium, periwinkle, forget-me-not, speedwell, pansy and blue pimpernel, are actually more to us than some larger and handsomer blue flowers, such as the blue-bottle, vipers' <b>bugloss,</b> and succory, and of blue flowers seen in masses.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Wallace laments (and rightly) {{the absence}} in the tropic forests of such grand masses of colour as are {{supplied}} by a heather moor, a furze or broom-croft, {{a field of}} yellow charlock, blue <b>bugloss,</b> or scarlet poppy. Tropic landscape gardening will supply that defect; and a hundred plants of yellow Allamanda, or purple Dolichos, or blue Clitoria, or crimson Norantea, set side by side, as we might use a hundred Calceolarias or Geraniums, will carry up the forest walls, and over the tree-tops, not square yards, but I had almost said square acres of richest positive colour. I can conceive no limit to the effects--always heightened by the intense sunlight and the peculiar tenderness of the distances--which landscape gardening will produce when once it is {{brought to bear on}} such material as it has never yet attempted to touch, at least in the West Indies, save in the Botanic Garden at Port of Spain.|$|E
6000|$|The valley, winding {{through the}} red and green hills, was dull and warm till the cool morning easter, which usually set about eight a.m., began to blow. The effect of {{increasing}} altitude showed itself in the vegetation. We now saw {{for the first time}} the Kidád (Astragalus), with horrid thorns and a flower resembling from afar the gooseberry: it is common on the Hismá and in the South Country. The Kahlá (Echium), a <b>bugloss,</b> a borage-like plant, with viscous leaves and flowers of two colours,--the young light-pink and the old dark-blue,--everywhere beautified the sands, and reminded me of the Istrian hills, where it is plentiful as in the Nile Valley. The Jarad-thorn was not in bloom; and the same was the case with the hyacinth (Dipcadi erythraeum), so abundant in the Hisma', which some of us mistook for a [...] "wild onion." [...] The Zayti (Lavandula) had just donned its pretty azure bloom. There were Reseda, wild indigo, Tribulus (terrestris), the blue Aristida, the pale Stipa, and the Bromus grass, red and yellow. The Ratam (spartium), with delicate white and pink blossoms, was a reminiscence of Tenerife and its glorious crater; whilst a little higher up, the amene Cytisus, flowering with gold, carried our thoughts back to the far past.|$|E
6000|$|There {{were other}} open spaces {{covered with a}} {{vegetation}} almost as interesting as the canes and the trees: this was where what were called [...] "weeds" [...] were allowed to flourish. Here were the thorn-apple, chenopodium, sow-thistle, wild mustard, redweed, viper's <b>bugloss,</b> and others, both native and introduced, in dense thickets five or six feet high. It was difficult to push one's way through these thickets, and one was always in dread of treading on a snake. At another spot fennel flourished by itself, {{as if it had}} some mysterious power, perhaps its peculiar smell, of keeping other plants at a proper distance. It formed quite a thicket, and grew to a height of ten or twelve feet. This spot was a favourite haunt of mine, as it was in a waste place at the furthest point from the house, a wild solitary spot where I could spend long hours by myself watching the birds. But I also loved the fennel for itself, its beautiful green feathery foliage and the smell of it, also the taste, so that whenever I visited that secluded spot I would rub the crushed leaves in my palms and chew the small twigs for their peculiar fennel flavour.|$|E
60|$|Our tearless condition--our {{ability to}} keep dry when it was raining, so to say--resulted from quite {{different}} causes. Mine just then were {{the eyes of a}} naturalist curiously observing the demeanour of the beings around me. To Mab the whole spectacle was an act, an interlude, or scene in that wonderful endless play which was a perpetual delight to witness and in which she too was taking a part. And to see all her friends, her grown-up playmates, enjoying themselves in this unusual way, marching in a procession to the church, dressed in black, singing hymns with tears in their eyes--why, this was even better than school or Sunday service, romps in the playground or a children's tea. Every time I looked down at my little mate she lifted a rosy face to mine with her sweetest smile and <b>bugloss</b> eyes aglow with ineffable happiness. And now that we are far apart my loveliest memory of her is as she appeared then. I would not spoil that lovely image by going back to look at her again. Three years! It was said of Lewis Carroll that he ceased to care anything about his little Alices when they had come to the age of ten. Seven is my limit: they are perfect then: but in Mab's case the peculiar exquisite charm could hardly have lasted beyond the age of six.|$|E
6000|$|... 87. Then {{the spirit}} of these Draconidæ seems to pass more or less into other flowers, whose forms are {{properly}} pure vases; but it affects some of them slightly, others not at all. It never strongly affects the heaths; never once the roses; but it enters like an evil spirit into the buttercup, and turns it into a larkspur, with a black, spotted, grotesque centre, and a strange, broken blue, gorgeous and intense, yet impure, glittering on the surface {{as if it were}} strewn with broken glass, and stained or darkening irregularly into red. And then at last the serpent charm changes the ranunculus into monkshood, and makes it poisonous. It enters into the forget-me-not, and the star of heavenly turquoise is corrupted into the viper's <b>bugloss,</b> darkened with the same strange red as the larkspur, and fretted into a fringe of thorn; it enters, together with a strange insect-spirit, into the asphodels, and (though with a greater interval between the groups) they change to spotted orchideæ; it touches the poppy, it becomes a fumaria; the iris, and it pouts into a gladiolus; the lily, and it chequers itself into a snake's-head, and secretes in the deep of its bell, drops, not of venom indeed, but honey-dew, {{as if it were a}} healing serpent. For there is an Æsculapian as well as an evil serpentry among the Draconidæ, and the fairest of them, the [...] "erba della Madonna" [...] of Venice (Linaria Cymbalaria), descends from the ruins it delights into the herbage at their feet, and touches it; and behold, instantly, a vast group of herbs for healing,--all draconid in form,--spotted and crested, and from their lip-like corollas named [...] "labiatæ;" [...] full of various balm, and warm strength for healing, yet all of them without splendid honor or perfect beauty, [...] "ground ives," [...] richest when crushed under the foot; the best sweetness and gentle brightness of the robes of the field,--thyme, and marjoram, and Euphrasy.|$|E
60|$|The {{night was}} {{somewhat}} cloudy--the stars being visible only at intervals--and {{it was not}} until the clergyman had advanced a little way that he was able to perceive the person who had spoken. He saw that it was the old herbalist, and immediately accosted him. An animated conversation followed, Abraham expatiating on the virtues of the plants he had been gathering under the dominion of their respective planets, and astonishing the pale student by the extent of his information. In his turn, the old man was delighted to find in the clergyman a fellow-enthusiast in the forbidden ways of science; and as the student was no less charmed to discover in the 'yarb doctor' a scholar who could sympathise with him and understand his yearnings after the invisible, late as was the hour, the pair adjourned to Abraham's cottage. The visitor did not emerge until the labourers were going to their toil, the time having been spent in conversation upon the powers exercised by the planets upon plants and men, the old man growing eloquent as to the wonderful virtue of the Bay Tree, which, he said, could resist all the evil Saturn could do to the human body, and in the neighbourhood of which neither wizard nor devil, thunder or lightning, could hurt man; of Moonwort, with the leaves of which locks might be opened, and the shoes be removed from horses' feet; of Celandine, with which, if a young swallow loseth an eye, the parent birds will renew it; of Hound's Tongue, a leaf of which laid under the foot will save the bearer from the attacks of dogs; of <b>Bugloss,</b> the leaf of which maketh man poison-proof; of Sweet Basil, from which (quoting Miraldus) venomous beasts spring--the man who smelleth it having a scorpion bred in his brain; and of a score of other herbs under the dominion of the Moon and Cancer, and of the cures wrought by them through antipathy to Saturn.|$|E
60|$|So {{he formed}} his minsters, as I believe, upon {{the model of}} those leafy minsters in which he walked to meditate, amid the aisles which God, not man, has built. He sent their columns aloft like the boles of ancient trees. He wreathed their capitals, {{sometimes}} their very shafts, with flowers and creeping shoots. He threw their arches out, and interwove the groinings of their vaults, like the bough-roofage overhead. He decked with foliage and fruit the bosses above and the corbels below. He sent up out of those corbels upright shafts along the walls, in the likeness of the trees which sprang out of the rocks above his head. He raised those walls into great cliffs. He pierced them with the arches of the triforium, as with hermits' cells. He represented in the horizontal sills of his windows, and in his horizontal string-courses, the horizontal strata of the rocks. He opened the windows into high and lofty glades, broken, as in the forest, by the tracery of stems and boughs, through which was seen, not merely the outer, but the upper world. For he craved, as all true artists crave, for light and colour; and had the sky above been one perpetual blue, {{he might have been}} content with it, and left his glass transparent. But in that dark dank northern clime, rain and snowstorm, black cloud and grey mist, were all that he was like to see outside for nine months in the year. So he took such light and colour as nature gave in her few gayer moods; and set aloft his stained glass windows the hues of the noonday and the rainbow, and the sunrise and the sunset, and the purple of the heather, and the gold of the gorse, and the azure of the <b>bugloss,</b> and the crimson of the poppy; and among them, in gorgeous robes, the angels and the saints of heaven, and the memories of heroic virtues and heroic sufferings, that he might lift up his own eyes and heart for ever out of the dark, dank, sad world of the cold north, with all its coarsenesses and its crimes, toward a realm of perpetual holiness, amid a perpetual summer of beauty and of light; as one who--for he was true to nature, even in that--from between the black jaws of a narrow glen, or from beneath the black shade of gnarled trees, catches a glimpse of far lands gay with gardens and cottages, and purple mountain ranges, and the far off sea, and the hazy horizon melting into the hazy sky; and finds his heart carried out into an infinite at once of freedom and of repose.|$|E
60|$|But sad I cannot call it. Nor, I think, {{would you}} feel it sad, when you {{perceive}} how richly successive architects have squandered on it the treasures of their fancy; and made it, so they say, perhaps the most splendid specimen {{in the world of}} one of those stone forests, in which the men of old delighted to reproduce those leafy minsters which God, not man, has built; where they sent the columns aloft like the boles of giant trees, and wreathed their capitals, sometimes their very shafts, with vines and flowers; and decked with foliage and with fruit the bosses above and the corbels below; and sent up out of those corbels upright shafts along the walls, in likeness of the trees which sprang out of the rocks above their head; and raised those walls into great cliffs; and pierced those cliffs with the arches of the triforium, as with wild creatures’ caves or hermits’ cells; and represented in the horizontal string-courses and window-sills the strata of the rocks; and opened the windows into wide and lofty glades, broken, as in the forest, by the tracery of stems and boughs, through which were seen, not only the outer, but the upper world. For they craved—as all true artists crave—for light and colour; and had the sky above been one perpetual blue, they might have been content with it, and left their glass transparent.
