5|$|Even more remarkably, {{there is}} a general set of laws known as <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> mechanics, which is {{analogous}} to the laws of thermodynamics. For instance, by the second law of <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> mechanics, the area of the event horizon of a general <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> will never decrease with time, analogous to the entropy of a thermodynamic system. This limits the energy that can be extracted by classical means from a rotating <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> (e.g. by the Penrose process). There is strong evidence that the laws of <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> mechanics are, in fact, a subset of the laws of thermodynamics, and that the <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> area is proportional to its entropy. This leads to a modification of the original laws of <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> mechanics: for instance, as the second law of <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> mechanics becomes part of the second law of thermodynamics, it is possible for <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> area to decrease—as long as other processes ensure that, overall, entropy increases. As thermodynamical objects with non-zero temperature, black holes should emit thermal radiation. Semi-classical calculations indicate that indeed they do, with the surface gravity playing the role of temperature in Planck's law. This radiation is known as Hawking radiation (cf. the quantum theory section, below).|$|E
5|$|A <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> {{could be}} the power source instead of a star in order to {{increase}} the matter-to conversion efficiency.

5|$|A <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> is {{a region}} of spacetime exhibiting such strong {{gravitational}} effects that nothing—not even particles and electromagnetic radiation such as light—can escape from inside it. The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a <b>black</b> <b>hole.</b> The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the event horizon. Although the event horizon has an enormous effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, no locally detectable features appear to be observed. In many ways a <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light.|$|E

5|$|The AdS/CFT {{correspondence}} resolves the <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> information paradox, {{at least}} to some extent, because it shows how a <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> can evolve {{in a manner consistent with}} quantum mechanics in some contexts. Indeed, one can consider black holes in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence, and any such <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> corresponds to a configuration of particles on the boundary of anti-de Sitter space. These particles obey the usual rules of quantum mechanics and in particular evolve in a unitary fashion, so the <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> must also evolve in a unitary fashion, respecting the principles of quantum mechanics. In 2005, Hawking announced that the paradox had been settled in favor of information conservation by the AdS/CFT correspondence, and he suggested a concrete mechanism by which black holes might preserve information.|$|E

5|$|Water megamasers {{may be used}} {{to provide}} {{accurate}} distance determinations to distant galaxies. Assuming a Keplerian orbit, measuring the centripetal acceleration and velocity of water maser spots yields the physical diameter subtended by the maser spots. By then comparing the physical radius to the angular diameter measured on the sky, the distance to the maser may be determined. This method is effective with water megamasers because they occur in a small region around an AGN, and have narrow linewidths. This method of measuring distances is being used to provide an independent measure of the Hubble constant that does not rely upon use of standard candles. The method is limited, however, by the small number of water megamasers known at distances within the Hubble flow. This distance measurement also provides a measurement of the mass of the central object, which in this case is a supermassive <b>black</b> <b>hole.</b> <b>Black</b> <b>hole</b> mass measurements using water megamasers is the most accurate method of mass determination for black holes in galaxies other than the Milky Way. The <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> masses that are measured are consistent with the M-sigma relation, an empirical correlation between stellar velocity dispersion in galactic bulges and the mass of the central supermassive <b>black</b> <b>hole.</b>|$|E
5|$|When a pair {{of virtual}} {{particles}} (such as an electron and positron) is created {{in the vicinity of}} the event horizon, random spatial positioning might result in one of them to appear on the exterior; this process is called quantum tunnelling. The gravitational potential of the <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> can then supply the energy that transforms this virtual particle into a real particle, allowing it to radiate away into space. In exchange, the other member of the pair is given negative energy, which results in a net loss of mass-energy by the <b>black</b> <b>hole.</b> The rate of Hawking radiation increases with decreasing mass, eventually causing the <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> to evaporate away until, finally, it explodes.|$|E
