40|$|Important {{roles for}} <b>biotic</b> <b>agents</b> in {{integrated}} weed management include preventing seed production and weed emergence from the seed bank. Seed-attacking microorganisms {{have been described}} for {{a limited number of}} economically important weeds and serve as examples illustrating the potential for reducing weed seed production. Innundative releas-es of seed-feeding insects have also successfully reduced viable seeds produced by spe-cific weeds and subsequently reduced the viable weed seed content in soils. There are some indications that seed attacked by either microorganisms or insects carry over detri-mental effects in soil and result in reduced weed seedling emergence in the following growing seasons. Combinations of different <b>biotic</b> <b>agents</b> could enhance efficacy of weed management over that observed with either agent alone. For example, a selective seed-feeding insect, Niesthrea louisianica, combined with seed-attacking fungi (Fusarium spp.) significantly decreased velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti) seed viability and seedling emergence compared to either the insect or fungi alone. Insect-attacked, fungal-infected velvetleaf seeds survived at very low rates in soil (ca. 2 % viable seeds at 24 months.) and in plots where the seedbank was not replenished, no viable seeds were retrieved from soil after 24 months. Integration of compatible <b>biotic</b> <b>agents</b> can be an effective method for reducing seed viability before and after entry into the seed bank. Prevention of seed pro-duction is considered the foundation for successful weed management — effective insect + microorganism combinations are key in building this foundation in biologically-based weed management...|$|E

Identifying, understanding, and maintaining historic and functioning ecosystems in changing landscapes {{can be challenging}} because multiple internal and external factors interact across scales. In this dissertation, I present a hierarchical approach to investigate patterns of health and mortality of subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa (Hook) Nutt. var. lasiocarpa) associated with a non-native herbivorous insect, the balsam woolly adelgid (BWA), Adelges piceae Ratzeburg, and landscape disturbance on the Olympic Peninsula, Washington, U. S. A. Assessment across broad and fine spatial and temporal scales allowed the identification of distinct boundaries of change associated with climate, topography, vegetation, and disturbance processes of fire, winter weather events, mass movement, and endemic and introduced insects and pathogens. I used Landsat imagery at broad spatial and temporal scales to differentiate patterns of very-high-, high-, and low-magnitude disturbance in subalpine-fir forest using the normalized burn ratio (NBR). Low-magnitude decline in NBR gradually increased in area over time (1994 - 2007) and occurred predominantly at high elevations and southern aspects during years of warm PDO index values, suggesting interactive effects of an invasive <b>biotic</b> <b>agent</b> and climate. I conducted field studies that identified BWA as the <b>biotic</b> <b>agent</b> that was consistently present in affected areas and associated with poor health and mortality of subalpine fir. Using dendrochronology, I determined that variability {{in the growth of}} subalpine fir was positively associated with the arrival of BWA in a forest along Hurricane Ridge in Olympic National Park. I compared aerial detection surveys, Landsat imagery, and dendrochronology methods and confirmed that all three methods independently detected effects of BWA for the same time period.

40|$|Summary: Many cabbage trees (Cordyline australis) {{are dying}} {{throughout}} much of the North Island and the northern South Island of New Zealand. The symptomatology of those dying in urban environments is described, and is concluded to be consistent with the hypothesis that death is caused by a <b>biotic</b> <b>agent</b> entering through a leafy tuft of the branch system. This disease, which has been named Sudden Decline, usually leads to almost total defoliation of affected trees within 2 - 12 months. Disease incidence has increased linearly at about 11 % per annum since 1987 / 88. Cultivated trees of C. kaspar, C. obtecta, and various Cordyline hybrids have also been observed dying with Sudden Decline symptoms. Investigations aimed at identifying the causal agent are described, and the hypothesis is advanced that a phytoplasma (mycoplasma-like organism or MLO) is the cause. Sudden Decline is contrasted with the widespread ill-health apparent in many pastoral populations of cabbage tree throughout the country. This Rural Decline is characterised by a general loss of branch and leaf vigour and occasional tree death. It is suggested that Rural Decline is a complex disease (decline disease) caused by various <b>biotic</b> and abiotic <b>agents</b> interacting with an ageing population growing in situations where regeneration is prevented.

Applications of phytohormones (methyl salicylate and methyl jasmonate) and G. clavigera were used for initial induction of defenses. Monoterpene concentrations varied with initial induction from fungal and phytohormone application while watering treatment had no effect. Seedlings treated with G. clavigera and methyl jasmonate had the greatest monoterpene concentrations compared to the control and methyl salicylate-treated seedlings. However, the monoterpene response to the challenge inoculation varied with watering treatments, not with prior induction treatments, with lower monoterpene concentrations in fungal lesions on seedlings in the low to moderate watering treatments compared to normal watering treatment. Furthermore, prior induction from phytohormones resulted in systemic cross-induction of resistance to G. clavigera under normal watering treatment but susceptibility under low watering treatment. Seedlings stressed by low water conditions, which also had lower stomatal conductance than seedlings in the normal watering treatment, likely allocated resources to initial defense response but were left unable to acquire further resources for subsequent responses.

Exposure of non-target organisms to quinalphos {{in the environment}} depends {{on the extent of}} persistence of quinalphos in natural resources which is, in turn, controlled by factors—abiotic and biotic. Influence of abiotic factors such as sun light, pH and TiO 2 on degradation of quinalphos in natural resources such as soil and water was examined [18 – 22]. Relatively, less attention was paid on biotic factors involved in the fate of quinalphos in natural resources [23]. A definite participation of factors, in particular biotic factors, in the degradation of quinalphos in natural resources such as soil and water can only be demonstrated with the isolation of <b>biotic</b> <b>agents</b> with degradation traits from natural resources.

Clinical signs, simptomathology related to the organs involved in digestion, liver histology analyses, weight losses and pattern of weight and length relation, correlation between used feeds and occurrence of winter disease, implicated nutrition as one of most possible ethiological agent of this condition.

This is because variations in temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure and precipitation result in distinct flora and fauna among different sites. If climate conditions along an altitudinal range act as a strong direct or indirect selective pressure on dispersal syndromes, the dispersal spectrum among plant communities in different altitudes should be distinct. We organized the dispersal syndromes in five hierarchical levels according to the levels of detail in diaspore morphology and, consequently, different degrees of specificity to the dispersers. Then we identified, within each hierarchical level, the syndromes of tree species of four forest types of the Atlantic Rainforest along a 1200 m altitudinal range in Southeast Brazil. Among 327 species, we found two syndromes in the most general hierarchical level (abiotic and biotic dispersal), three in the following level (wind, self and animal), three in the intermediate level (barochory, autochory and endozoochory), two in the forth level (mammal and bird), and 12 syndromes in the most specific level, all of which were related to the morphology of diaspores dispersed by wind, autochory, mammals and birds. The dispersal spectrum in the five hierarchical levels was similar among the four forest types. Overall, the majority of species is dispersed by <b>biotic</b> <b>agents,</b> considered here as animals and the parent plant itself. Within <b>biotic</b> <b>agents,</b> the most important are animals, specifically birds. Most bird-dispersed species present drupoid diaspores.
