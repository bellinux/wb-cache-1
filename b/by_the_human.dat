5|$|The {{dominant}} {{producers of}} iodine today are Chile and Japan. Iodine {{and its compounds}} are primarily used in nutrition. Due to its high atomic number and ease of attachment to organic compounds, it has also found favour as a non-toxic radiocontrast material. Because of the specificity of its uptake <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> body, radioactive isotopes of iodine {{can also be used}} to treat thyroid cancer. Iodine is also used as a catalyst in the industrial production of acetic acid and some polymers.|$|E
5|$|The last {{surviving}} raphine species, the Rodrigues solitaire, probably became extinct before 1778. The dodo survived until 1662 or 1690.

Although the dodo became extinct earlier, the causes of extinction are related and involve the introduction of animals and hunting.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the story}} of Duke Karl Alexander and Joseph Süß Oppenheimer {{constituted}} a relatively obscure episode in German history, it {{became the subject of}} a number of literary and dramatic treatments over the course of more than a century; the earliest of these having been Wilhelm Hauff's 1827 novella. The most successful literary adaptation was Lion Feuchtwanger's novel titled Jud Süß (1925) based on a play that he had written in 1916 but subsequently withdrew. As a Jew, Feuchtwanger did not intend his portrayal of Süß to be antisemitic but rather as a study of the tragedy caused <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> weaknesses of greed, pride, and ambition. With an interest in exploring the challenges confronting Jews in the Diaspora, Feuchtwanger was particularly concerned with the issues of conversion and antisemitism. He was particularly {{struck by the fact that}} Süß could have saved himself by converting to Christianity but had steadfastly refused to do so, opting instead to return to formal Jewish observance and piety.|$|E
5|$|Another Green Wing {{series of}} running jokes is about hair. One {{of the more}} notable was various cracks about Mac's untidy hair, with Sue lending him a hair tie and hair clips before he goes in for an interview. Another was the {{character}} Karen getting her hair trapped in a printer in the first episode. Mac was {{often referred to as}} a Ginger by the other characters. Guy's hair becomes gradually curlier as the series goes on and Rachel dyes her hair from blonde to brunette after the first series. Other recurring jokes include Boyce's practical jokes, the bizarre games played <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> resources staff and surgery scenes where Caroline, Guy and Mac mess around while performing operations.|$|E
5|$|CASS4 (Crk {{associated}} substrate 4) is {{the fourth}} and last described member of the CAS protein family. CASS4 was detected by Singh et al. in 2008 following in silico screening of databases describing expressed sequence tags from an evolutionarily diverse group of organisms, using the CAS-related proteins (p130Cas, NEDD9/HEF1 and EFS) mRNAs as templates. Singh et al. subsequently cloned and characterized the CASS4 gene, originally assigning the name HEPL (HEF1-EFS-p130Cas-like) for similarity to the other three defined CAS genes. The official name was subsequently changed to CASS4 <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Human</b> Genome Organization (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC).|$|E

5|$|Depending on modality, {{language}} structure can {{be based}} on systems of sounds (speech), gestures (sign languages), or graphic or tactile symbols (writing). The ways in which languages use sounds or signs to construct meaning are studied in phonology. The study of how humans produce and perceive vocal sounds is called phonetics. In spoken language, meaning is produced when sounds {{become part of a}} system in which some sounds can contribute to expressing meaning and others do not. In any given language, {{only a limited number of}} the many distinct sounds that can be created <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> vocal apparatus contribute to constructing meaning.|$|E
5|$|Despite the Soviet government's efforts, on June 14, 1987, about 5,000 people {{rallied to}} commemorate the victims of Soviet deportations. This event, {{organized}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> rights group Helsinki-86, {{was the first time}} after the Soviet occupation that the flower-laying ceremony took place, as the practice was banned by the Soviet authorities. In response the Soviet government organized a bicycle race at the monument at the time when the ceremony was planned to take place. Helsinki-86 organized another flower-laying ceremony on August 23 in the same year {{to commemorate the}} anniversary of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, at which the crowd was dispersed using jets of water. Yet the independence movement grew in size, amounting in some events to {{more than half a million}} participants (about one quarter of Latvia's population) and three years later, on May 4, 1990, the re-establishment of the independence of Latvia was declared.|$|E
5|$|Free basic water. Inspired <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Human</b> Right to Water, two {{important}} cities in Colombia make a basic {{amount of water}} (Minimo Vital de Agua Potable) available to their poorest residents free of charge. In 2009, Medellin made 2.5 cubic meters of water per month and per person - or 10 cubic meters {{for a family of}} four - available for free to all urban residents in class 1. The city wants to reach 45,000 households and has budgeted 25 billion Pesos (USD 14 million) to finance free basic water and associated awareness campaigns. In February 2012 Bogota also introduced 6 cubic meters of free basic water per household for households in classes 1 and 2, covering more than 1.5 million households or 39% of all households. The annual cost is estimated at 60 billion Pesos (USD 33 million).|$|E

5|$|Lithium {{naturally}} only {{occurs in}} traces in biological systems {{and has no}} known biological role, but does have effects on the body when ingested. Lithium carbonate {{is used as a}} mood stabiliser in psychiatry to treat bipolar disorder (manic-depression) in daily doses of about 0.5 to 2grams, although there are side-effects. Excessive ingestion of lithium causes drowsiness, slurred speech and vomiting, among other symptoms, and poisons the central nervous system, which is dangerous as the required dosage of lithium to treat bipolar disorder is only slightly lower than the toxic dosage. Its biochemistry, the way it is handled <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> body and studies using rats and goats suggest that it is an essential trace element, although the natural biological function of lithium in humans has yet to be identified.|$|E
5|$|Loss of {{biodiversity}} stems {{largely from the}} habitat loss and fragmentation produced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> appropriation of land for development, forestry and agriculture as natural capital is progressively converted to man-made capital. Land use change is fundamental to {{the operations of the}} biosphere because alterations in the relative proportions of land dedicated to urbanisation, agriculture, forest, woodland, grassland and pasture have a marked effect on the global water, carbon and nitrogen biogeochemical cycles and this can impact negatively on both natural and human systems. At the local human scale, major sustainability benefits accrue from sustainable parks and gardens and green cities.|$|E
5|$|Maxwell {{was also}} {{interested}} in applying his theory of colour perception, namely in colour photography. Stemming directly from his psychological work on colour perception: if a sum of any three lights could reproduce any perceivable colour, then colour photographs could be produced {{with a set of}} three coloured filters. In the course of his 1855 paper, Maxwell proposed that, if three black-and-white photographs of a scene were taken through red, green and blue filters and transparent prints of the images were projected onto a screen using three projectors equipped with similar filters, when superimposed on the screen the result would be perceived <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> eye as a complete reproduction of all the colours in the scene.|$|E
