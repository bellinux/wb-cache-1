It provides a copula based daily rainfall disaggregation model to predict the total wet period’s duration (L) for given daily rainfall amount (R). Transition probabilities, parameterised by L, are used to aid the assignment of daily storm profile (DSP) type to R. A wet(1) - dry(0) alternation sub-model is used to generate a 1 - 0 <b>binary</b> <b>chain</b> of total duration D and consistent with variable L. Carefully designed rules are followed to select an observed scaled DSP from the Australian capital cities located in different climatic regions.

Application of the developed model to the Australia capital cities’ daily rainfall time series has reproduced gross statistics of the rainfall time series very well at all aggregation levels down to 6 minutes.

40|$|Integer {{multiple}} neural firing patterns exhibit multi-peaks in inter-spike interval (ISI) histogram (ISIH) and {{exponential decay}} in amplitude of peaks, which results from their stochastic mechanisms. But in previous experimental {{observation that the}} decay in ISIH frequently shows obvious bias from exponential law. This paper studied three typical cases of the decay, by transforming ISI series of the firing to discrete <b>binary</b> <b>chain</b> and calculating the probabilities or frequencies of symbols over the whole chain. The first case is the exponential decay without bias. An example of this case was discovered on hippocampal CA 1 pyramidal neuron stimulated by external signal. Probability calculation shows that this decay without bias results from a stochastic renewal process, in which the successive spikes are independent. The second case is the exponential decay with a higher first peak, while the third case is that with a lower first peak. An example of the second case was discovered in experiment on a neural pacemaker. Simulation and calculation of {{the second and third}} cases indicate that the dependency in successive spikes of the firing leads to the bias seen in decay of ISIH peaks. The quantitative expression of the decay slope of three cases of firing patterns, as well as the excitatory effect in the second case of firing pattern and the inhibitory effect in the third case of firing pattern are identified. The results clearly reveal the mechanism of the exponential decay in ISIH peaks of a number of important neural firing patterns and provide new understanding for typical bias from the exponential decay law...|$|E

For example, it delays in the wait line, it delays in time of transaction process, it delays in time of answer that you/they cause as neck of the bottle, it lacks memory, etc. The central problem that intends is guided to the growth and, evolution of the server web in an economic and scalable way that takes to a good yield. Consequently, the necessity exists of studying the processes transactions of the system, {{in such a way that}} another alternative is applied as genetic algorithms to optimize the process of transaction in servant, basing stops to improve processes of the server web and, to improve the attention to the clients / users. The objective is to implement a pretender of transactions guiding the taking of the administrator's of transactions decisions with the application of genetic algorithms. It was used the genetic algorithms to determine that transaction should take to assign it in the line of processes. Certain restrictions are assumed that the pretender took as given. For example, each transaction has a constant number of resources that you/they request. Each resource has a line that he/she administers and alone 2 requirement types can be made: to read and to write. The structure of a chromosome consists of an alelos group and each one corresponds with a requested resource. The administrator of transactions took the requirement for the resource to put it in line, the one that has a maximum of chromosome similar to 1, that is to say, when he finds among the group of transactions the transaction that has his alelos in 1. He took as chromosome a <b>binary</b> <b>chain</b> that will be converted to whole numbers.

El problema central que se propone está orientado al crecimiento y, evolución del servidor web de una manera económica y escalable que lleva a un rendimiento óptimo. Por consiguiente, existe la necesidad de estudiar los procesos de transacciones del sistema, de tal manera que se aplique otra alternativa como algoritmos genéticos para optimizar el proceso de transacción en el servidor, a fin de así mejorar los procesos del servidor web y, mejorar la atención a los clientes / usuarios. El objetivo es implementar un simulador de transacciones orientando a la toma de decisiones del administrador de transacciones con la aplicación de algoritmos genéticos. Se usará los algoritmos genéticos para determinar que transacción se debe tomar para asignarlo en la cola de procesos. Se asumen ciertas restricciones que el simulador tomará como dadas. Por ejemplo, cada transacción tiene un número constante de recursos que solicitan. Cada recurso tiene una cola que administra y solo se pueden hacer 2 tipos de requerimiento: leer y escribir. La estructura de un cromosoma consta de un grupo de alelos y cada uno corresponde con un recurso solicitado. El administrador de transacciones tomará el requerimiento por el recurso para ponerlo en cola, el que tenga un máximo de cromosoma igual a 1, es decir, cuando encuentre entre el grupo de transacciones la transacción que tenga sus alelos en 1. Se tomará como cromosoma una cadena binaria que será convertida a números enteros. Se ha realizado un análisis de los modelos de transacciones que operan actualmente y se ha extraído tales mecanismos para llevarlo a un proceso de toma de decisiones en función de los algoritmos genéticos. Se ha implementado un simulador prototipo para un sistema de aplicación con algoritmos genéticos, para optimizar el proceso de transacción, antes de procesar los datos, se evaluarán los procesos de transacciones sobre: tiempo de simulación, número de transacciones, tiempo de la transacción, número de recursos, longitud de la cola del recurso, probabilidad de cruzamiento, probabilidad de mutación, transacciones en cola, atendidos, en lectura, en escritura, tiempo consumido, y se consigue los resultados de procesos óptimos; el tiempo de procesamiento de datos mediante el simulador es menor que el tiempo de procesamiento de datos que en el procesador convencional, mejor uso del recurso de la computadora.
