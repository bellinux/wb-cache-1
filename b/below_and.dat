5|$|Another {{contribution}} of gyroscopic effects is a roll moment {{generated by the}} front wheel during countersteering. For example, steering left causes a moment to the right. The moment is small compared to the moment generated by the out-tracking front wheel, but begins {{as soon as the}} rider applies torque to the handlebars and so can be helpful in motorcycle racing. For more detail, see the section countersteering, <b>below,</b> <b>and</b> the countersteering article.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the time}} of the radiocarbon-indicated date of the eruption, there is {{evidence}} for a significant climatic event in the Northern Hemisphere like failure of crops in China (see <b>below)</b> <b>and</b> evidence from tree rings, cited above: bristlecone pines of California; bog oaks of Ireland, England, and Germany; and other trees in Sweden. The tree rings precisely date the event to 1628BCE.|$|E
5|$|As {{shown in}} the figure, and as {{originally}} described by , Rule 184 {{may be used to}} model deposition of particles onto a surface. In this model, one has a set of particles that occupy a subset of the positions in a square lattice oriented diagonally (the darker particles in the figure). If a particle is present at some position of the lattice, the lattice positions <b>below</b> <b>and</b> to the right, and <b>below</b> <b>and</b> {{to the left of the}} particle must also be filled, so the filled part of the lattice extends infinitely downward to the left and right. The boundary between filled and unfilled positions (the thin black line in the figure) is interpreted as modeling a surface, onto which more particles may be deposited. At each time step, the surface grows by the deposition of new particles in each local minimum of the surface; that is, at each position where it is possible to add one new particle that has existing particles below it on both sides (the lighter particles in the figure).|$|E

5|$|Beginning roughly in 1992, {{three years}} after the RJR Nabisco buyout, and {{continuing}} {{through the end of the}} decade the private equity industry once again experienced a tremendous boom, both in venture capital (as will be discussed <b>below)</b> <b>and</b> leveraged buyouts with the emergence of brand name firms managing multibillion-dollar sized funds. After declining from 1990 through 1992, the private equity industry began to increase in size raising approximately $20.8 billion of investor commitments in 1992 and reaching a high-water mark in 2000 of $305.7 billion, outpacing the growth of almost every other asset class.|$|E
5|$|<b>Below</b> <b>and</b> {{in front}} of the {{striatum}} are a number of basal forebrain structures. These include the nucleus accumbens, nucleus basalis, diagonal band of Broca, substantia innominata, and the medial septal nucleus. These structures are important in producing the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, which is then distributed widely throughout the brain. The basal forebrain, in particular the nucleus basalis, is considered to be the major cholinergic output of the central nervous system to the striatum and neocortex.|$|E

5|$|But {{the player}} {{primarily}} responsible for elevating the Modern Benoni {{to the status of}} a major opening was Mikhail Tal, who took up the opening in 1953 after seeing one of Nezhmetdinov's games. The tactical positions it led to were a perfect fit for Tal's combinatorial gifts and he crushed many opponents in brilliant style. Famous examples include his game against Bukhuti Gurgenidze at the 1957 USSR championship, excerpted <b>below,</b> <b>and</b> his win against Yuri Averbakh at the same tournament the following year.|$|E
5|$|Despite these differences, {{the leading}} causes {{of death in the}} United States are remarkably similar for men and women, headed by heart disease, which {{accounts}} for a quarter of all deaths, followed by cancer, lung disease and stroke. While women have a lower incidence of death from unintentional injury (see <b>below)</b> <b>and</b> suicide, they have a higher incidence of dementia (Gronowski and Schindler, Table I).|$|E
