5|$|A modern {{light rail}} system was {{proposed}} by a newly formed regional transit authority (RTA) in 1995, including a line running on Rainier Avenue between Downtown Seattle and Seattleâ€“Tacoma International Airport that stopped in Columbia City. After the $6.7 billion proposal was rejected <b>by</b> <b>voters</b> in March 1995, the RTA considered building a shorter elevated line on Rainier Avenue, including an option beginning at Columbia City and ending in the University District. In November 1996, a condensed $3.9 billion regional transit plan was approved <b>by</b> <b>voters,</b> including a light rail line between Seattle and Sea-Tac Airport that ran through the Rainier Valley, with an elevated station on Rainier Avenue South at South Edmunds Street in Columbia City.|$|E

The RTA, which renamed itself to Sound Transit, selected an at-grade alignment for light rail on Martin Luther King Jr. Way South in 1999, with a station at South Henderson Street.|$|E

5|$|The Municipality of Metropolitan Seattle (Metro) began {{operating}} {{bus service}} in King County in 1973, including regular bus {{service to the}} airport from Downtown Seattle on routes 174 and 194. A 1986 study from the Puget Sound Council of Governments and Metro recommended {{the construction of a}} light rail system between Federal Way and Lynnwood serving the airport and Downtown Seattle. A regional transit authority (RTA) was formed in the early 1990s to study a regional light rail system, first proposing a $6.7 billion plan in 1995 with service to Sea-Tac Airport via International Boulevard.

The plan, supported by Governor Albert D. Rosellini, was ultimately rejected by incoming Governor Daniel J. Evans in favor of completing Interstate 5. The Forward Thrust rapid transit plan, which was rejected <b>by</b> <b>voters</b> in 1968 and 1970, included Sea-Tac Airport in its long-term plans for service; the airport was excluded from the first phase because of possible changes brought by airport expansion and the Supersonic Transport program.|$|E

In more recent elections, liberal Ashland has supported tax levies and environmental regulations opposed <b>by</b> <b>voters</b> elsewhere in Jackson and nearby counties. Critics sometimes refer to the city as the People's Republic of Ashland.|$|E

5|$|Part of {{the reason}} for this is the {{extensive}} freeway system in the city, due to the majority of that system being funded by local, rather than federal funds, through a half-cent general sales tax measure approved <b>by</b> <b>voters</b> in 1985.
