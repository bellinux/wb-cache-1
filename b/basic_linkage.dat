40|$|Two degree-of-freedom (2 -DOF) closed spatial {{linkages}} can {{be useful}} in the design of robotic devices for spatial rigid-body guidance or manipulation. One of the simplest linkages of this type, without any passive DOF on its links, is the revolute-spherical-revolute-spherical (RSRS) four-bar spatial linkage. Although the RSRS topology has been used in some robotics applications, the kinematics study of this <b>basic</b> <b>linkage</b> has unexpectedly received little attention in the literature over the years. Counteracting this historical tendency, this work presents the derivation of the general implicit equation of the surface generated by a point on the coupler link of the general RSRS spatial mechanism. Since the derived surface equation expresses the Cartesian coordinates of the coupler point as a function only of known geometric parameters of the linkage, the equation {{can be useful}}, for instance, in the process of synthesizing new devices. The steps for generating the coupler surface, which is computed from a distance-based parametrization of the mechanism and is algebraic of order twelve, are detailed and a web link where the interested reader can download the full equation for further study is provided. It is also shown how the celebrated sextic curve of the planar four-bar linkage is obtained from this RSRS dodecic...|$|E

40|$|Sugarcane cultivars are polyploid, aneuploid, {{interspecific}} hybrids {{between the}} domesticated species Saccharum officinarum {{and the wild}} relative S. spontaneum. Cultivar chromosome numbers range from 100 to 130 with ~ 10 % contributed by S. spontaneum. We have undertaken a mapping study on the progeny of a selfed cultivar, R 570, to analyze this complex genome structure. A set of 128 {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} probes and one isozyme was used. Four hundred and eight markers were placed onto 96 cosegregation groups, based on linkages in coupling only. These groups could tentatively be assembled into 10 <b>basic</b> <b>linkage</b> groups on the basis of common probes. Origin of markers was investigated for 61 probes and the isozyme, leading to the identification of 80 S. officinarum and 66 S. spontaneum derived markers, respectively. Their distribution in cosegregation groups showed better map coverage for the S. spontaneum than for the S. officinarum genome fraction and occasional recombination between the two genomes. The study of repulsions between markers suggested the prevalence of random pairing between chromosomes, typical of autopolyploids. However, cases of preferential pairing between S. spontaneum chromosomes were also detected. A tentative Saccharum map was constructed by pooling linkage information for each linkage group...|$|E
40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to determine the outcrossing rate, the inheritance of markers and establish a <b>basic</b> <b>linkage</b> map in grasspea, Lathyrus sativus L. The outcrossing rate in a white-flowered line of grasspea ranged from 1. 7 to 2. 7 % among eight combinations of gene frequency and location. The outcrossing rate in this study (2. 2 ± 0. 7 %) suggests that individual lines of grasspea should be maintained in isolation to maintain their genetic integrity. Inheritance and linkage were determined for one morphological, 11 isozyme and 72 RAPD markers in five F 2 populations (all RAPD markers were in one F 2 population). The inheritance of flower colour was monogenic with colour dominant over white. The isozymes, ACO- 1, ACO- 2, AAT- 1, AAT- 2, EST- 6, FDH, LAP- 1, PGD- 2, SKDH and TPI- 1, were codominantly expressed with monogenic inheritance.

40|$|Because war {{and other}} renderings of politically-based {{conflict}} {{can be so}} destructive, it is natural for scientists and prac-titioners to move quickly to document the debilitating effects of political violence and to ameliorate or treat those effects via intervention efforts. This understandable leap to assist, however, can carry with it unrealistically simplistic presump-tions {{about the nature of}} political violence, which, in the end, do not serve well the driving interest to be of efficient, effective and lasting assistance to war’s participants. At the most basic level, for example, to presume (explicitly or implic-itly [e. g., through lack of thorough investigation]) that the violence of war is experienced uniformly across conflicts, and, further, that it automatically has debilitating effects (moreover, of the same type and severity) on those who endure it misses much critical texture and variation that is essential to the basic goals of understanding and providing assistance. Despite calls as old as a decade ago for more sophistication and nuance in the study of children and political violence (e. g. Cairns & Dawes, 1996), the knowledge base produced by (particularly quantitative and clinical) researchers remains quite narrow, restricted as it still is by presumptions of simplic-ity. Thus, for example, the dominant focus in the approach to the study of children’s and youths ’ experience with political violence remains the chronicling of violence exposure and the documentation of its correlation with stress or other forms of psychological impact (see Barber & Schluterman, 2008, for a recent overview of quantitative studies involving adolescents), and this despite repeated reviews that point out that even this <b>basic</b> <b>linkage,</b> narrow in focus as it is, {{has been found to be}} inconsistent and often not strong (e. g., Barber...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to take {{preliminary}} steps towards a critical theory of what is termed an ‘architecture of investment climate surveillance’. The paper outlines the contours of this architecture, which it suggests is made up of various private and publicagents that have authoritative positions in the market for evaluating investment opportunities and risks. By way of illustrating <b>basic</b> <b>linkages</b> and mechanisms, it examines the way in which these agents ‘read’ the implementation of a piece of non-orthodox policy: Bolivia’s nationalisation of gas. Though not unproblematic, Bolivia’s policy of nationalisation has significantly increased state revenue and allowed new social spending on poverty reduction. Yet despite these positive developmental effects, readings of this policy shift within the investment community have been highly critical, illustrating the investor-centred values on which these evaluations are based. The article concludes bysuggesting that scholars of globalisation must pay more attention to whether and how such discursive responses are able to delimit the space for non-orthodox policy in the global South...|$|R
40|$|This talk {{addresses}} {{the relationships between}} weather and El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and various other low frequency atmospheric variations such as the Pacific/North American pattern. We focus, in particular, on the predictability of extreme wintertime precipitation events over the continental United States. We first examine fifty years of daily precipitation observations and quantify the leading patterns of winter weather variability. These weather systems, familiar to operational weather forecasters, account {{for many of the}} major flooding events on the west coast as well as the major winter snowstorms along the east coast. We next examine the statistics of these storm systems with a particular focus on the occurrence of extreme events. The leading weather systems show varying degrees of linkages to low frequency atmospheric variability. We show, for example, that on seasonal time scales the probability of occurrence of certain types of west coast storms is strongly enhanced by El Nino, while it is reduced during winters with an anomalous trough {{to the west of the}} dateline. ENSO also has a strong impact on storms that develop over the Gulf of Mexico and affect much of the eastern United States, with enhanced storminess during El Nino, and reduced storminess during La Nina conditions. We conclude with an example of how well current climate models are able to reproduce the <b>basic</b> <b>linkages</b> between weather and low frequency variability...|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} the ‘‘Linkages to Public Land’’ (LPL) Framework, a general but comprehensive data-gathering and analysis approach aimed at informing citizen and agency decision making {{about the social}} environment of public land. This social assessment and planning approach identifies and categorizes various types of linkages {{that people have to}} public land and guides the tasks of finding and using information on people in those linkages. Linkages are defined as the ‘‘coupling mechanisms’’ that explain how and why humans interact with ecosystems, while linkage analyses are empirical investigations contextualized both temporally and geographically. The conceptual, legal, and theoretical underpinnings of five <b>basic</b> <b>linkage</b> categories (tribal, use, interest, neighboring land, and decision making) and further refinement into subcategories are explained. These categories are based upon the complex property and decision-making regimes governing public land. Applying an ‘‘inside-out’’ analytic perspective, the LPL Framework assesses the social environment inside public land units and traces linkages out into the larger social environment, instead of assessing the outside social environment (communities or stakeholders) and assuming linkages exist between the social entities and public lands, as is generally done in social assessments. The LPL Framework can be utilized in management activities such as assessing baseline conditions and designing monitoring protocols, planning and evaluating management alternatives, analyzing impacts of decisions, structuring public involvement and conflict management efforts, and conducting collaborative learning and stewardship activities. The framework enhances understanding of human dimensions of ecosystem management by providing a conceptual map of human linkages to public land and a stepwise process for focusing and contextualizing social analyses. The framework facilitates analysis of the compatibilities, conflicts, and trade-offs between various linkages, and between cumulative human linkages and capabilities of public land to sustain them. While the LPL Framework was developed for use in planning for U. S. National Forests, it could be applied to other types of public land in the United States and adapted and extended to public lands and common property areas in other countries...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Until recently, {{normal mode}} {{analysis}} (NMA) {{was limited to}} small proteins, {{not only because the}} required energy minimization is a computationally exhausting task, but also because NMA requires the expensive diagonalization of a 3 Na× 3 Na matrix with Na the number of atoms. A series of simplified models has been proposed, in particular the Rotation-Translation Blocks (RTB) method by Tama et al. for the simulation of proteins. It makes use of the concept that a peptide chain or protein {{can be seen as a}} subsequent set of rigid components, i. e. the peptide units. A peptide chain is thus divided into rigid blocks with six degrees of freedom each. Recently we developed the Mobile Block Hessian (MBH) method, which in a sense has similar features as the RTB method. The main difference is that MBH was developed to deal with partially optimized systems. The position/orientation of each block is optimized while the internal geometry is kept fixed at a plausible – but not necessarily optimized – geometry. This reduces the computational cost of the energy minimization. Applying the standard NMA on a partially optimized structure however results in spurious imaginary frequencies and unwanted coordinate dependence. The MBH avoids these unphysical effects by taking into account energy gradient corrections. Moreover the number of variables is reduced, which facilitates the diagonalization of the Hessian. In the original implementation of MBH, atoms could only be part of one rigid block. The MBH is now extended to the case where atoms can be part of two or more blocks.

40|$|This {{research}} {{is concerned with}} the case of Ukraine where there has been a fundamental change in the economic environment engendered by the transition from a centrally planned to a market economy and the resulting conditions of economic crisis. The way that Ukrainian marketers and consumers are reacting to this environmental change is the principal concern of the research together with the <b>basic</b> <b>linkages</b> between critical environmental elements and strategic marketing decisions. This research analyses the way in which marketing evolves in a turbulent, transitional environment. The study is based on eight case analyses within the retail sector of the Ukrainian market. The process of transition to a free market economy leads a researcher to question the validity of existing theories that have been based on empirical data that has been collected in the stable marketing environment of the West. For this reason an in-depth, theory building methodology is preferred. A number of broad research objectives were set. Firstly, to establish whether the sales - production - marketing stages model of marketing evolution, derived from empirical data collected in stable Western environments, is relevant {{in the context of the}} turbulent, transitional environment of Ukraine. Secondly, to establish if, in this turbulent, transitional environment, idiosyncratic approaches to marketing are emerging and thirdly to assess the development of attitudes to marketing, organisation for marketing and the development of marketing strategy in Ukraine. The main conclusions of this thesis are firstly, that the stages model of marketing orientation is not relevant in the context of Ukraine, secondly that there are idiosyncratic approaches to marketing emerging in the turbulent, transitional environment of Ukraine and finally that the above developments have a profound impact on the development of attitudes to marketing, organisation for marketing and the development of marketing strategy in Ukraine...|$|R

Data was integrated by use of a geographic information system. Identification of changes in wetlands and human activities was completed, as well as analyses of relationships between wetland change and changes in human activities. The model also identified and evaluated Mexican governmental policies affecting wetland changes. Results include descriptions, maps, and analyses of wetlands conditions and human activities, changes over an 18 year period, and interactions supported by correlation analyses Wetlands functions were summarized for the Tobari system. Human activities showed an increase in aquaculture, salt mining, agriculture, and fisheries. Changes by spatial distribution are shown in an intensity map. The federal government has promoted policies focused on development of irrigation districts, including self-sufficiency in grains and opening agricultural land. Economic incentives include subsidies, infrastructure financing, price controls, and compensation for international market fluctuations. Federal government policies did have important impacts on wetland change. The emphasis of this model was on correlation between changes in wetland functions and values, and changes in human activities. While wetland distribution, classes, and interactions are essential information, assigning value to them requires knowledge of their functions. Since values often depend upon local cultural and economic conditions, local perception of wetland values emerge from people's awareness of them. Some values are recognized by local people in the Tobari system, especially those related to their economic system. Others, such as those related to water quality and climatic regulation, are not recognized yet.

40|$|Abstract. A {{tetrahedral}} {{curve is}} an unmixed, usually non-reduced, one-dimensional subscheme of projective 3 -space whose homogeneous ideal is {{the intersection of}} powers of {{the ideals of the}} six coordinate lines. The second and third authors have shown that these curves have very nice combinatorial properties, and they have made a careful study of the even liaison classes of these curves. We build on this work by showing that they are “almost always ” componentwise linear, i. e. their homogeneous ideals have the property that for any d, the degree d component of the ideal generates a new ideal whose minimal free resolution is linear. The one type of exception is clearly spelled out and studied as well.

40|$|Condensed tannins from litchi seed were {{analyzed}} using reflectron modes and linear modes of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). The reflectron modes (accelerating voltage, 20. 0 kV; reflectron voltage, 23. 0 kV; delayed extraction voltage, 16. 32 kV; lens voltage, 9. 45 kV) spectra obtained clear information on <b>basic</b> unit, interflavan <b>linkage</b> and polymerization degree extended from 3 -mers to 18 -mers. The linear modes (accelerating voltage, 20. 0 kV; delayed extraction voltage, 16. 25 kV; lens voltage, 10. 0 kV) spectra further expanded the detectable polymers up to 27 -mers. Litchi seed condensed tannins were A-type procyanidins polymer with as high as 27 -mers. In the present study, reflectron modes coupled with linear modes was discussed as a potential method of MALDI-TOF MS in characterization of condensed tannins...|$|R
40|$|Hydrophilic {{polymers}} contain polar or charged functional groups, rendering them soluble in water. This chapter {{discusses the}} synthesis, properties, and applications of different hydrophilic polymers. It considers the hydrophilic polymers as three {{categories such as}} natural, semisynthetic, and synthetic. Natural hydrophilic polymers are again classified into plant origin and animal origin. Semisynthetic water-soluble polymers are derived by either chemical modification of natural polymers or from microbial sources. Most natural hydrophilic polymers are polysaccharides, which vary substantially in their <b>basic</b> sugar units, <b>linkages,</b> and substituents. Synthetic hydrophilic polymers have different applications in pharmacology, biotechnology, and chemistry. The chapter provides some examples of synthetic hydrophilic polymers. The copolymer Divinyl Ether-Maleic Anhydride (DIVEMA), which {{is also known as}} pyran copolymer, is used in drug delivery systems. It acts as an antitumor, antiviral, antifungal, and antibacterial agent. Polyoxazoline polymers are nonionic, stable, and highly soluble in water and organic solvents...|$|R

We build on this work by showing that they are “almost always” componentwise linear, i. e., their homogeneous ideals have the property that for any d, the degree d component of the ideal generates a new ideal whose minimal free resolution is linear.

40|$|In {{this article}} a typological {{overview}} of tail-head linkage (THL) in Papuan languages is presented. There {{are two types}} of THL, chained THL and thematized THL. The chained type is the default type and its morphosyntactic form follows from the <b>basic</b> clause <b>linkage</b> type in a given Papuan language, for example when switch reference constructions are the basic type of clause linkage, then the default type of THL takes the form of switch reference constructions. Chained THL carries referential coherence mechanisms (e. g. gender agreements, switch reference) and event sequencing mechanisms (e. g. sequence-simultaneity morphology) across chain boundaries. The second, marked, type of THL is with nominalized clauses that discontinue the event and participant lines. The head clause in this type of THL is a thematic NP that is syntactically separate from the chain and this reflects thematic discontinuity: the thematic head clause is off-sequence. In languages like Wambon and Usan the two types of THL select different verb types: medial verbs that express switch reference (same versus different subject) and/or sequence-simultaneity distinctions occur in the chained type and independent verbs that cannot express these distinctions occur in the second, thematic type. THL has four functions, referential coherence, processing ease, thematic continuity (chained type) and thematic discontinuity (thematized type). The phonological form of THL (slowly pronounced, rising intonation, pause phenomena) reflects its processing function to give speakers and addressees a break between two chains...|$|R

We examine some <b>basic</b> macrofinancial <b>linkages</b> of an SWF''s strategic asset allocation (SAA) strategies {{with regard to the}} government budget, monetary policy, and exchange rate movements. Based on a simple Markowitz-model framework, which integrates the specific objectives and constraints facing an SWF and the country''s specific characteristics and macroeconomic vulnerabilities (especially in relation to commodity prices and prospective defined liabilities), we derive an SAA. The asset-liability methodology that is applied in the selection of an SWF SAA also allows assessing whether (i) the SAA adequately takes into account the country-specific risks and vulnerabilities, and (ii) its objectives and macrofinancial constraints are consistent. Some analytical and practical issues in determining an SAA model are also discussed, along with key effects of a financial crisis.

40|$|OpenTrials is a {{collaborative}} and open database for all available structured data and documents on all clinical trials, threaded together by individual trial. With a versatile and expandable data schema, it is initially designed to host and match the following documents and data for each trial: registry entries; links, abstracts, or texts of academic journal papers; portions of regulatory documents describing individual trials; structured data on {{methods and results}} extracted by systematic reviewers or other researchers; clinical study reports; and additional documents such as blank consent forms, blank case report forms, and protocols. The intention {{is to create an}} open, freely re-usable index of all such information and to increase discoverability, facilitate research, identify inconsistent data, enable audits on the availability and completeness of this information, support advocacy for better data and drive up standards around open data in evidence-based medicine. The project has phase I funding. This will allow us to create a practical data schema and populate the database initially through web-scraping, <b>basic</b> record <b>linkage</b> techniques, crowd-sourced curation around selected drug areas, and import of existing sources of structured and documents. It will also allow us to create user-friendly web interfaces onto the data and conduct user engagement workshops to optimise the database and interface designs. Where other projects have set out to manually and perfectly curate a narrow range of information on a smaller number of trials, we aim to use a broader range of techniques and attempt to match a very large quantity of information on all trials. We are currently seeking feedback and additional sources of structured data...|$|R

40|$|Given {{a reduced}} 0 -dimensional {{subscheme}} X={P 1,…,Ps} of P 2, it is a well-studied but open question {{to determine the}} possible Hilbert functions of its first infinitesimal neighborhood (or double point scheme) Z defined by IZ=I 2 P 1 n?nI 2 Ps. If one fixes the Hilbert function of the support X of Z, {{the determination of the}} set D(h) of all possible Hilbert functions for Z seems to be a very difficult problem. The authors show that D(h) contains a unique minimal element hmin (with respect to the obvious partial ordering). Moreover, they construct a specific element of D(h) for every h. Similarly, the authors study the set Betti D(h) of all collections of graded Betti numbers of schemes Z whose support has Hilbert function h. They give an algorithm to describe a member of Betti D(h) for every h. To achieve these results, the authors use the type vector T=(d 1,…,dr) of h and special sets of points, called linear configurations, derived from this type vector. These sets are characterized by having di points Xi on a line Li where no point of Xi is on Lj for i?j. Although it is not true that every double point scheme whose support is a linear configuration with Hilbert function h has the same Hilbert function, the authors show that it has the same regularity which is also the maximal possible. Moreover, the authors characterize the Hilbert functions h for which double point schemes supported on a linear configuration having Hilbert function h share the same graded Betti numbers. Further methods of proof are Horace's method [see J. E. Alexander and A. Hirschowitz, J. Algebraic Geom. 4 (1995), no. 2, 201 [...] 222; MR 1311347 (96 f: 14065) ] and the technique of <b>basic</b> double <b>linkage...</b>|$|R
