5|$|Demetrius had <b>been,</b> <b>after</b> the First Illyrian War in 229 BC, {{ruler of}} most of coastal Illyria. However, in 219 BC, during the Second Illyrian War he was {{defeated}} by the Romans and fled {{to the court of}} Philip.|$|E
5|$|According to Plutarch, one {{tradition}} had it {{that the}} Persian king (who at the time would still have been Xerxes) agreed a humiliating peace treaty {{in the aftermath of}} the Eurymedon. However, as Plutarch admits, other authors denied that such a peace was made at this time, and the more logical date for any peace treaty would have <b>been</b> <b>after</b> the Cyprus campaign of 450 BC. The alternative suggested by Plutarch is that the Persian king acted as if he had made a humiliating peace with the Greeks, because he was so fearful of engaging in battle with them again. It is generally considered unlikely by modern historians that a peace treaty was made in the aftermath of Eurymedon.|$|E
5|$|An {{assistant}} of LeHand's, Grace Tully, {{took over}} as Roosevelt's secretary, but was never a companion for Roosevelt {{in the same way}} as LeHand had <b>been.</b> <b>After</b> Missy departed the White House, she never saw FDR again, though he did keep in touch with letters, phone calls and by sending gifts. In the fall of 1941, FDR rewrote his will to leave half of the annual income from his estate (which was eventually probated at more than $3 million) for LeHand's care, and half to Eleanor. The will stated that upon LeHand's death the income would go to Eleanor, with the principal eventually divided equally among his children. As LeHand died before FDR, her half reverted to Eleanor.|$|E

We interviewed six site creators {{to understand the}} motivations they felt and the challenges they encountered.

Less technically skilled interviewees coped with these challenges by collaborating with other people, but they were less positive about their respective site’s success compared to interviewees whose skills enabled them to work alone. We conclude by outlining opportunities for research aimed at helping people more rapidly and effectively collaborate on future web-centric projects...|$|R

5|$|Another {{earthquake}} {{struck in}} 1202, {{and it may}} have <b>been</b> <b>after</b> this event that the castle was remodelled. The 13th-century work was the last period of building at Krak des Chevaliers and gave it its current appearance. An enclosing stone circuit was built between 1142 and 1170; the earlier structure became the castle's inner court or ward. If there was a circuit of walls surrounding the inner court that pre-dated the current outer walls, no trace of it has been discovered.|$|E
5|$|During {{the rest}} of 1932 Gielgud played in a new piece, Musical Chairs by Ronald Mackenzie, and {{directed}} one new and one classic play, Strange Orchestra by Rodney Ackland in the West End, and The Merchant of Venice at the Old Vic, with Malcolm Keen as Shylock and Ashcroft as Portia. In 1932 he starred in Richard of Bordeaux by Elizabeth MacKintosh. This, a retelling in modern language {{of the events of}} Richard II, was greeted as the most successful historical play since Shaw's Saint Joan nine years earlier, more faithful to the events than Shakespeare had <b>been.</b> <b>After</b> an uncertain start in the West End it rapidly became a sell-out hit and played in London and on tour over the next three years.|$|E
5|$|Herodotus {{tells us}} that, on seeing {{the outcome of}} the battle hung in the balance, the {{disarmed}} Samians had joined in {{on the side of the}} allies, doing what they could. This inspired the other Ionian contingents to turn on the Persians as well. At which stage in the battle this happened is not clear; the Samians were presumably not in the main battle line (being disarmed), so it may have <b>been</b> <b>after</b> the Persians retreated to the camp. Meanwhile, the Milesians who were guarding the passes of Mycale also turned on the Persians. At first they misdirected the fleeing Persian contingents so that they ended up back amongst the Allied troops; then, perhaps seeing {{the outcome of the}} battle was certain, they began killing the fleeing Persians.|$|E

5|$|The {{project was}} only {{successful}} in raising rigging, some guns and other items. At {{least two other}} salvage teams in 1547 and 1549 received payment for raising more guns from the wreck. Despite {{the failure of the}} first salvage operation, there was still lingering belief in the possibility of retrieving the Mary Rose at least until 1546, when she was presented as part of the illustrated list of English warships called the Anthony Roll. When all hope of raising the complete ship was finally abandoned is not known. It could have <b>been</b> <b>after</b> Henry VIII's death in January 1547 or even as late as 1549, when the last guns were brought up. The Mary Rose was remembered well into the reign of ElizabethI, and according to one of the queen's admirals, William Monson (1569–1643), the wreck was visible from the surface at low tide in the late 16th century.|$|E
5|$|Dual Destinies {{features}} animated cutscenes {{produced by}} the animation studio Bones, which were directed by Seto at Capcom and Kenji Nagasaki at Bones. The scripts for these were drafted by Yamazaki, and included characters' lines {{as well as the}} general events and backgrounds for each scene. After the scripts were written, they were sent to Nagasaki, who drew storyboards for the scenes. When boarding the sequences, he added suggestions for details and nuances; for instance, in the script for one scene, Athena was going to trip and fall over, while Nagasaki suggested and boarded her tumbling down stairs, and added a guard character for her to interact with {{at the end of the}} scene to emphasize how painful the fall had <b>been.</b> <b>After</b> finalizing the scene, the team at Bones worked on the background art; while the courtrooms and defendant lobbies are shown in-game, the courthouse's stairway and main hall had not been shown before, and had to be designed specifically for the cutscenes.|$|E

25|$|After the disaster, Space Shuttle flight {{operations}} were suspended {{for more than}} two years, as they had <b>been</b> <b>after</b> the Challenger disaster.
