5|$|On the way home, Peter and Brian argue until Brian {{gets out}} of the car. A police officer gives Brian a ticket, for which Peter has to pay $10, for violating the local leash law, which only widens the rift between Peter and Brian. Another {{argument}} ensues and Peter mentions that he found Brian on the road as a stray dog. Angry that Peter brought that up and becoming more angry when Peter then demands that Brian stop being a bad dog, Brian leaves the house, whereupon he is treated cruelly by the community, and is (ultimately) forced to sleep at the bus shelter. Peter buys a new cat which turns out to be mischievous and abusive; the family gets rid of it and searches for Brian. By the time Peter decides to apologize to Brian, Brian has <b>been</b> <b>kicked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a restaurant and a public store and chased by the police when he was found drinking from a water fountain. Brian becomes homeless, having actually attacked a man on the street for treating him as a drunken hobo and for not believing that he was not a good dog but a crazy animal. He is subsequently taken away by the police.|$|E
25|$|After {{a period}} in a children's home in Deal, Kent, Wisdom ran away when he was 11 but {{returned}} to become an errand boy in a grocer's shop on leaving school at 13.

He later also worked as a coal miner, waiter and page boy.|$|E
25|$|Khadr {{has offered}} a number of {{conflicting}} accounts of his life.

The Dudley Boyz, who held the tag team championships; Rob Van Dam, who was the Hardcore Champion, and Christian, who was European Champion also saw that extended to them. Of these wrestlers, everyone except RVD (who was already cheered by fans despite being in the Alliance) remained a heel after the Alliance.

They lived on Gillam Street in the Rainbow Hill district of Worcester. At the time McGreavy moved in, Elsie was pregnant with the Ralphs' third child, Samantha, who was born in September 1972.|$|E
25|$|On the {{following}} episode of Impact!, Fortune formed {{an alliance with}} Hulk Hogan's and Eric Bischoff's new stable, Immortal. On the November 18 episode of Impact!, Flair returned to the ring, competing in a match where he faced Matt Morgan, who had <b>been</b> <b>kicked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Fortune the previous month; Morgan won the match after Douglas Williams turned {{on the rest of}} Fortune, when they interfered in the match. On January 25, 2011, it was reported that Flair had pulled out of TNA's Maximum Wooo! tour of Europe mid–tour after monetary disputes. After missing a show in Berlin, Germany, Flair returned to the tour on January 27 in Glasgow, Scotland, reportedly apologizing to the locker room prior to the show. On January 29, Flair wrestled his only match of the tour, defeating Douglas Williams in London, tearing his rotator cuff in the process. During Flair's time away from TNA, Fortune turned on Immortal. Flair returned at the February 14 tapings of the February 17 episode of Impact!, turning on Fortune during a match between A.J. Styles and Matt Hardy and jumping to Immortal. On the March 10 episode of Impact!, Flair defeated Styles and Hardy in a three–way street fight, contested as more of a two–on–one handicap match. On April 17 at Lockdown, Immortal, represented by Flair, Abyss, Bully Ray and Matt Hardy, was defeated by Fortune members James Storm, Kazarian and Robert Roode and Christopher Daniels, who replaced an injured A.J. Styles, in a Lethal Lockdown match, when Flair tapped out to Roode. The match was used to write Flair off television, as {{the following}} week he was scheduled to undergo surgery for his torn rotator cuff; however, Flair ultimately chose not to have the surgery as it would have required six months of rehab.|$|E

500|$|A {{report in}} 1990 said the blocks were being [...] "held hostage" [...] by the homeless, mainly [...] "aggressive panhandlers, {{stumbling}} drunks, violent drug users and the unpredictable mentally ill." [...] Reports {{in the mid-1990s}} said [...] "Downtown Portland had become a drug supermarket", with [...] "marijuana and LSD ... being dealt openly in the South Park Blocks," [...] and that the South Park Blocks, especially near the Lincoln statue, were home to [...] "The Park People", who littered, used drugs, and damaged property. Youth reported they {{had moved to the}} South Park Blocks because they had <b>been</b> <b>kicked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Pioneer Courthouse Square and O'Bryant Square. A child molester known as [...] "Krusty the Troll" [...] who preyed on homeless teens in the South Park Blocks, was charged with 79 counts of sex crimes in 1996. There was a major police sweep of the Park Blocks in 1996 for ordinances such as sitting on the Abraham Lincoln statue, marijuana possession, littering, and loud radios.|$|E
500|$|In {{the weeks}} after the forfeit, Rainmen guard Joey Haywood recounted that the team had been {{approached}} by an unknown man at their hotel following the brawl. Haywood said, [...] "He was pacing around the lobby on his phone eyeing us. He {{then went to the}} ATM but didn't actually do anything. He went and sat in a parked car out front. We thought something was going to go down, like he was scouting us out." [...] The Rainmen promptly left on the team bus, and it was considered a motive for forfeiting the game. On the morning of May 2, two days after the brawl, Rainmen guard Forrest Fisher wrote on Twitter that he had <b>been</b> <b>kicked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his apartment without warning. He said, [...] "We were in Toronto Friday morning, and I get a message from the landlord at the apartment I stay at, telling me that my bags have been packed and all of my stuff has been moved to storage." [...] The team management, who were responsible for players' living arrangements, were largely blamed for the affair. The players also claimed that they had not been paid in more than two weeks.|$|E
500|$|Bart {{disrupts}} one of Lisa's addresses to {{the nation}} to promote his music career, which leads Lisa to be branded unpopular when Bart sings to the public on live television that Lisa will be imposing a tax to get the country out of debt. Lisa later meets {{with the leaders of}} America's creditor nations, who demand that America pay them back. Bart steps in and uses his skills at stalling debt collectors to save the day, pleasing Lisa who had previously been mad at her brother. As a thank-you, Bart asks Lisa to [...] "legalize it", and Lisa says she will. Meanwhile, Homer has heard about gold buried by Abraham Lincoln {{on the grounds of the}} White House and starts a search for it. When he finally locates the [...] "gold", it is in fact a chest with a scroll in it that Lincoln had written on explaining that his [...] "gold" [...] is [...] "in the heart of every freedom-loving American." [...] Homer does not appreciate the metaphor and angrily curses Lincoln. After the vision is over, Bart promises that he will change. Lisa finds Bart and tells him that the family has <b>been</b> <b>kicked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the casino after Homer pushed a waitress and Marge lost $20,000. Bart tells Lisa about his vision of the future where he has a rock band and a moped, while downplaying Lisa's future presidency as [...] "some government job." ...|$|E

[...] Martin, who had implemented his trademark [...] "Billy Ball" [...] in Oakland, was known for his hot-tempered approach to the game. The Sporting News noted the difference in style between Martin and Boros: [...] "The volatile, dirt-kicking days are over for the time being in Oakland. Steve Boros, the man named to succeed Billy Martin, will live on the quiet side of Manager's Row[...] [...] [...] Unlike Martin, Boros said he will not rant and rave.

2500|$|Judt won a {{place at}} Emanuel School in Wandsworth, and {{following}} his education at Emanuel, {{he went on to}} study as a scholarship student at King's College, Cambridge. Judt was the first member of his family to finish secondary school and to go to university. While at Cambridge, Judt became close friends with Martyn Poliakoff, who later became well known as a chemist and star of the Periodic Table of Videos. He obtained a BA degree in history in 1969 and after spending a year at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris completed a Ph.D. in 1972. As a high school and university student he was a left-wing Zionist, and worked summers on kibbutzim. He moved away from Zionism after the Six-Day War of 1967, later stating that [...] "I went with this idealistic fantasy of creating a socialist, communitarian country", but that he came to realise that left-wing Zionists were [...] "remarkably unconscious of the people who had <b>been</b> <b>kicked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the country...to make this fantasy possible". He came to describe his Zionism as his particular [...] "ideological overinvestment". Judt wrote in February 2010 that: [...] "Before even turning twenty I had become, been, and ceased to be a Zionist, a Marxist, and a communitarian settler: no mean achievement for a south London teenager".|$|E

60|$|I cannot {{say that}} Mr. Prendergast {{believed}} {{much of this}} terribly long epistle when he first received it, or felt himself imbued with any great hope that his old friend's wife might be restored to her name and rank, and his old friend's son to his estate and fortune. But nevertheless {{he knew that it}} was worth inquiry. That Aby Mollett had <b>been</b> <b>kicked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Hap House in a manner that must have been mortifying to his feelings, Mr. Prendergast had himself seen; and that he would, therefore, do anything in his power to injure Owen Fitzgerald, Mr. Prendergast was quite sure. That he was a viler wretch even than his father, Mr. Prendergast suspected,--having been led to think so by words which had fallen from Sir Thomas, and being further confirmed in that opinion by the letter now in his hand. He was not, therefore, led into any strong opinion that these new tidings were of value. And, indeed, he was prone to disbelieve them, because they ran counter to a conviction which had already been made in his own heart, and had been extensively acted on by him. Nevertheless he resolved that even Aby's letter deserved attention, and that it should receive that attention early on the following morning.|$|E
