25|$|To {{those who}} believe that {{consciousness}} entails something more than behaving in all ways conscious, Dennett's view is seen as eliminativist, since it denies the existence of qualia and the possibility of philosophical zombies.

25|$|While the {{recycled}} nutrients may support some phytoplankton growth, {{it ultimately}} feeds back to increased C. amurensis populations.

Additionally, L. tetraspina appears impervious to predation by the clam or (almost) anything else.

The entire process is guided by the non-verbal responses of the client. The first is the act of establishing and maintaining rapport between the practitioner and the client which is achieved through pacing and leading the verbal (e.g., sensory predicates and keywords) and non-verbal behavior (e.g., matching and mirroring non-verbal behavior, or responding to eye movements) of the client.|$|E
25|$|One of Castoriadis' many {{important}} contributions to social theory {{was the idea}} that social change involves radical discontinuities that cannot <b>be</b> <b>understood</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of any determinate causes or presented as a sequence of events. Change emerges through the social imaginary without strict determinations, but in order to be socially recognized it must be instituted as revolution. Any knowledge of society and social change can exist only by referring to (or by positing) social imaginary significations. Thus, Castoriadis developed a conceptual framework where the sociological and philosophical category of the social imaginary has a central place and he offered an interpretation of modernity centered on the principal categories of social institutions and social imaginary significations; in his analysis, these categories are the product of the human faculties of the radical imagination and the social imaginary, the latter faculty being the collective dimension of the former. (According to Castoriadis, the sociological and philosophical category of the radical imaginary can be manifested only through the individual radical imagination and the social imaginary.) However, the social imaginary cannot be reduced or attributed to subjective imagination, since the individual is informed through an internalisation of social significations.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century, physics {{had evolved}} to the point at which {{classical}} mechanics could cope with highly complex problems involving macroscopic situations; thermodynamics and kinetic theory were well established; geometrical and physical optics could <b>be</b> <b>understood</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of electromagnetic waves; and the conservation laws for energy and momentum (and mass) were widely accepted. So profound were these and other developments that it was generally accepted that all the important laws of physics had been discovered and that, henceforth, research would be concerned with clearing up minor problems and particularly with improvements of method and measurement. However, around 1900 serious doubts arose about the completeness of the classical theories—the triumph of Maxwell's theories, for example, was undermined by inadequacies that had already begun to appear—and their inability to explain certain physical phenomena, such as the energy distribution in blackbody radiation and the photoelectric effect, while some of the theoretical formulations led to paradoxes when pushed to the limit. Prominent physicists such as Hendrik Lorentz, Emil Cohn, Ernst Wiechert and Wilhelm Wien believed that some modification of Maxwell's equations might provide the basis for all physical laws. These shortcomings of classical physics were never to be resolved and new ideas were required. At the beginning of the 20th century a major revolution shook the world of physics, which led to a new era, generally referred to as modern physics.|$|E

500|$|Sue Walsh {{observed}} in 2007 that critics have rigidly categorised Just So Stories as [...] "Children's Literature", and have in consequence given it scant literary attention. In her view, if critics mention {{the book at}} all, they talk {{about what kind of}} reading is good for children and what they are capable of understanding. The stories are discussed, she argues, by critics such as Elliott Gose [...] "in terms of ideas about the child’s pleasure (conceived of in sensual terms divorced of intellectual understanding) in the oral aspects of the text which are said to prompt an ‘active Participation’ which seems largely to <b>be</b> <b>understood</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of the ‘oral savouring’ of repetition".|$|E
500|$|While this {{discussion}} about specific fossils such as Opabinia and Anomalocaris was going on, {{the concept of}} stem groups was introduced to cover evolutionary [...] "aunts" [...] and [...] "cousins". A crown group {{is a group of}} closely related living animals plus their last common ancestor plus all its descendants. A stem group contains offshoots from members of the lineage earlier than the last common ancestor of the crown group; it is a relative concept, for example tardigrades are living animals that form a crown group in their own right, but Budd (1996) regarded them also as being a stem group relative to the arthropods. Viewing strange-looking organisms like Opabinia in this way makes it possible to see that, while the Cambrian explosion was unusual, it can <b>be</b> <b>understood</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of normal evolutionary processes.|$|E
500|$|A {{classical}} {{spring system}} {{can be described in}} terms of vibrational modes, which are analogous to the harmonics that occur on a stretched violin string. If the system starts in a particular mode, vibrations in other modes do not develop. [...] With the nonlinear component, Fermi expected energy in one mode [...] to transfer gradually to other modes, and eventually, to be distributed equally among all modes. [...] This is roughly what began to happen shortly after the system was initialized with all its energy in the lowest mode, but much later, essentially all the energy periodically reappeared in the lowest mode. [...] This behavior {{is very different from the}} expected equipartition of energy. It remained mysterious until 1965, when Kruskal and Zabusky showed that, after appropriate mathematical transformations, the {{system can be}} described by the Korteweg–de Vries equation, which is the prototype of nonlinear partial differential equations that have soliton solutions. [...] This means that FPUT behavior can <b>be</b> <b>understood</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of solitons.|$|E

500|$|The {{analogy of}} games– most {{commonly}} associated with Ludwig Wittgenstein– has been proposed {{as a way of}} establishing meaning in religious language. The theory asserts that language must <b>be</b> <b>understood</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of a game: just as each game has its own rules determining what can and cannot be done, so each context of language has its own rules determining what is and is not meaningful. Religion is classified as a possible and legitimate language game which is meaningful within its own context. Various parables have also been proposed {{to solve the problem of}} meaning in religious language. R. M. Hare used his parable of a lunatic to introduce the concept of [...] "bliks"– unfalsifiable beliefs according to which a worldview is established– which are not necessarily meaningless. Basil Mitchell used a parable to show that faith can be logical, even if it seems unverifiable. John Hick used his parable of the Celestial City to propose his theory of eschatological verification, the view that if there is an afterlife, then religious statements will be verifiable after death.|$|E
