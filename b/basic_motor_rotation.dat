40|$|Much {{indirect}} evidence supports {{the hypothesis that}} transformations of mental images are {{at least in part}} guided by motor processes, even in the case of images of abstract objects rather than of body parts. For example, rotation may be guided by processes that also prime one to see results of a specific motor action. We directly test the hypothesis by means of a dual-task paradigm in which subjects perform the Cooper-Shepard mental rotation task while executing an unseen <b>motor</b> <b>rotation</b> in a given direction and at a previously learned speed. Four results support the inference that mental <b>rotation</b> relies on <b>motor</b> processes. First, <b>motor</b> <b>rotation</b> that is compatible with mental rotation results in faster times and fewer errors in the imagery task than when the two rotations are incompatible. Second, the angle through which subjects rotate their mental images, and the angle through which they rotate a joystick handle are correlated, but only if the directions of the two rotations are compatible. Third, <b>motor</b> <b>rotation</b> modifies the classical inverted V-shaped mental rotation response time function, favoring the direction of the motor rotation; indeed, in some cases <b>motor</b> <b>rotation</b> even shifts the location of the minimum of this curve {{in the direction of the}} <b>motor</b> <b>rotation.</b> Fourth, the preceding effect is sensitive not only to the direction of the <b>motor</b> <b>rotation,</b> but also to the motor speed. A change in the speed of <b>motor</b> <b>rotation</b> can correspondingly slow down or speed up the mental rotation...|$|R

40|$|Rotation of the {{bacterial}} flagellar motor {{is powered}} by a transmembrane gradient of protons or, in some species, sodium ions. The molecular mechanism of coupling between ion flow and <b>motor</b> <b>rotation</b> is not understood. The proteins most closely involved in <b>motor</b> <b>rotation</b> are MotA, MotB, and FliG. MotA and MotB are transmembrane proteins that function in transmembrane proton conduction and that are believed to form the stator. FliG is a soluble protein located on the cytoplasmic face of the rotor. Two other proteins, FliM and FliN, are known to bind to FliG and have also been suggested to be involved to some extent in torque generation. Proton (or sodium) -binding sites in the motor are likely to be important to its function and might be formed from the side chains of acidic residues. To investigate the role of acidic residues in the function of the flagellar motor, we mutated each of the conserved acidic residues in the five proteins that have been suggested to be involved in torque generation and measured the effects on motility. None of the conserved acidic residues of MotA, FliG, FliM, or FliN proved essential for torque generation. An acidic residue at position 32 of MotB did prove essential. Of 15 different substitutions studied at this position, only the conservative-replacement D 32 E mutant retained any function. Previous studies, together with additional data presented here, indicate that the proteins involved in <b>motor</b> <b>rotation</b> do not contain any conserved basic residues that are critical for <b>motor</b> <b>rotation</b> per se. We propose that Asp 32 of MotB functions as a proton-binding site in the bacterial flagellar motor and that no other conserved, protonatable residues function in this capacity...|$|R

Hopefully, the prototype machine can help the small business enterprises to increase their production rate.
