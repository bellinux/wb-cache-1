5|$|Both of Wollstonecraft's novels also {{critique}} {{the discourse}} of sensibility, a moral philosophy and aesthetic that had become popular {{at the end of}} the eighteenth century. Mary is itself a novel of sensibility and Wollstonecraft attempts to use the tropes of that genre to undermine sentimentalism itself, a philosophy she <b>believed</b> <b>was</b> damaging to women because it encouraged them to rely overmuch on their emotions. In The Wrongs of Woman the heroine's indulgence on romantic fantasies fostered by novels themselves is depicted as particularly detrimental.|$|E
5|$|During {{the night}} of Saturday 23–24 January, the rebels met at the Mission church in Mbombwe, where Chilembwe gave a speech {{stressing}} {{that none of them}} should expect to survive the reprisals that would follow the revolt but that the uprising would draw greater attention to their conditions and destabilise the colonial system. This, Chilembwe <b>believed,</b> <b>was</b> the only way change would ever occur.|$|E
5|$|Following the album's December 1990 release, {{critical}} reviews {{were not}} favourable; critics noted Burke to be a poor replacement for McCulloch, who they <b>believed</b> <b>was</b> an indispensable {{aspect of the}} band. After Reverberation failed to chart, the band were dropped by WEA Records and, after two independently released singles, disbanded in 1993.|$|E

5|$|In October 1862, Dow {{was given}} command over the District of Pensacola, {{and moved to}} join other units there. He {{immediately}} earned the troops' disfavor by placing Pensacola under prohibition. He also (without authorization from Washington) began to recruit black troops from the local slave population while continuing his confiscation of rebel property. Butler soon countermanded the confiscation order, which Dow <b>believed</b> <b>was</b> done in revenge for his banning of alcohol.|$|E
5|$|Liman's directorial {{method was}} often hands-on. Many times he {{operated}} the camera himself {{in order to}} create what he <b>believed</b> <b>was</b> a more intimate relationship between himself, the material, and the actors. He felt that this connection was lost if he simply observed the recording on a monitor. This was a mindset he developed from his background as a small-scale indie film maker.|$|E
5|$|Murray's boyfriend {{had turned}} off {{his cell phone}} during his flight to Haverhill, New Hampshire. At some point, he {{received}} a voice mail that he <b>believed</b> <b>was</b> the sound of Murray sobbing. The call was traced to a calling card issued to the American Red Cross.|$|E
50|$|The {{plot of the}} {{original}} Escape Velocity involves disputes between the Confederation government and a Rebellion against it. As noted earlier, the player may choose sides (or not) based on who they <b>believe</b> <b>is</b> right, who they <b>believe</b> <b>is</b> stronger, who they <b>believe</b> it <b>is</b> more profitable to support, or any other criteria. The player begins with a shuttlecraft resembling those from Star Trek.|$|R

5|$|Thatcher began {{attending}} lunches {{regularly at}} the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA), {{a think tank}} founded by Hayekian poultry magnate Antony Fisher; she had been visiting the IEA and reading its publications since the early 1960s. There she {{was influenced by the}} ideas of Ralph Harris and Arthur Seldon, and became the face of the ideological movement opposing the British welfare state. Keynesian economics, they <b>believed,</b> <b>was</b> weakening Britain. The institute's pamphlets proposed less government, lower taxes, and more freedom for business and consumers.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of early traditions of Jesus' birth in Bethlehem is attested by the Christian apologist Justin Martyr, who stated in his Dialogue with Trypho (c. 155–161) that the Holy Family had taken refuge {{in a cave}} outside of the town. Origen of Alexandria, writing around the year 247, referred to a cave {{in the town of}} Bethlehem which local people <b>believed</b> <b>was</b> the birthplace of Jesus. This cave was possibly one which had previously been a site of the cult of Tammuz.|$|E
5|$|A heated altercation between Ramirez and {{teammate}} Kevin Youkilis {{took place}} on June 5, during a game at Fenway Park against the Tampa Bay Rays. The Boston Globe speculated that Youkilis was angry that Ramirez {{has been slow to}} join a bench-clearing brawl earlier in the game. The altercation may have also been caused by Ramirez objecting to what he <b>believed</b> <b>was</b> excessive complaining by Youkilis about the strike zone, as well as the first baseman's penchant for sometimes throwing his helmet in frustration after making an out. Before the fifth inning, Ramirez was caught on NESN cameras taking a swing at Youkilis. Ramirez and Youkilis yelled at each other and had to be separated by teammates, coaches, and training staff. Youkilis headed out to the field still yelling at Ramirez, while Ramirez was escorted into the tunnel leading to the clubhouse by bench coach Brad Mills and trainer Paul Lessard.|$|E

5|$|After the war, Haynes Stellite {{moved to}} {{producing}} tableware, jewelry, and pocket knives. The {{employees of the}} company unionized and began to demand wage increases beyond what Haynes <b>believed</b> <b>was</b> fair. The threat of labor strikes and Haynes' desire to avoid the problem led him to sell the company to Union Carbide on April 10, 1920, in exchange for 25,000 shares of Union Carbide stock valued at $2million. He later made an additional half million from dividends. Other details of the deal were never made public, and Haynes may have made as much $4million on the sale. After a series of owners, the company is now called Haynes International and is again independent.|$|E
5|$|Afterward, Grant {{suggested}} {{to his colleagues}} that they should {{catch up with the}} presidential limousine. Since he was the only Dallas-based member of the press in camera car two, Grant directed his driver to the Trade Mart, where they saw no activity. A worker across the street said he saw a limousine speed past, accompanied by motorcycles with their sirens blaring; Grant knew immediately that they were headed to Parkland Memorial Hospital. Once at Parkland, Grant started snapping pictures of anything he could, including Vice President Johnson's car, and a man and a police officer delivering what Grant <b>believed</b> <b>was</b> blood plasma.|$|E
5|$|Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches {{is a book}} {{composed}} by the American folklorist Charles Godfrey Leland that was published in 1899. It contains what he <b>believed</b> <b>was</b> the religious text {{of a group of}} pagan witches in Tuscany, Italy that documented their beliefs and rituals, although various historians and folklorists have disputed the existence of such a group. In the 20th century, the book was very influential {{in the development of the}} contemporary Pagan religion of Wicca. Aradia is also the name of a character in the webcomic Homestuck, created by Andrew Hussie.|$|E

5|$|At a Sunday {{church service}} in mid-December, in what Marshall <b>believed</b> <b>was</b> {{an attempt by}} other {{officials}} {{to force him to}} assume the presidency, a courier brought a message informing him that Wilson had died. Marshall was shocked, and rose to announce the news to the congregation. The ministers held a prayer, the congregation began singing hymns, and many people wept. Marshall and his wife exited the building, and made a call to the White House to determine his next course of action, only to find that he had been the victim of a hoax, and that Wilson was still living.|$|E
5|$|Birdsong first {{appeared}} with the Supremes in Ballard's {{place at a}} benefit concert at the Hollywood Bowl on April 29, 1967. Following the performance, Gordy quickly learned that Birdsong was still contractually committed to the Blue Belles when that group's lawyers filed an injunction against him. In May, Ballard returned for what she <b>believed</b> <b>was</b> a probationary period, although in reality it was a stopgap measure until Gordy {{was able to buy}} out Birdsong's contract. During May and June, knowing that she was one step away from being dismissed, Ballard made an attempt to toe the line, slimming down and showing up to commitments on time and sober. Despite this, Birdsong was secretly traveling with the Supremes, studying their routines.|$|E
5|$|Carter's initial {{pitch for}} The X-Files was {{rejected}} by Fox executives. He fleshed out the concept and returned a few weeks later, when they commissioned the pilot. Carter worked with NYPD Blue producer Daniel Sackheim to further develop the pilot, drawing stylistic inspiration from the 1988 documentary The Thin Blue Line and the British television series Prime Suspect. Inspiration also came from Carter's memories of The Twilight Zone {{as well as from}} The Silence of the Lambs, which provided the impetus for framing the series around agents from the FBI, in order to provide the characters with a more plausible reason for being involved in each case than Carter <b>believed</b> <b>was</b> present in Kolchak. Carter was determined to keep {{the relationship between the two}} leads strictly platonic, basing their interactions on the characters of Emma Peel and John Steed in The Avengers series.|$|E
