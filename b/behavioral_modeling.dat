40|$|A special three-party secure {{computation}} {{problem is}} studied {{in which one}} of three pairwise interacting parties is required to compute {{a function of the}} sequences held by the other two when one of the three parties may arbitrarily deviate from the computation protocol (active <b>behavioral</b> <b>model).</b> For this problem, information-theoretic conditions for secure computation are developed within the real versus ideal model simulation paradigm. Conditions for the passive <b>behavioral</b> <b>model</b> are also provided. A pure one-time-pad based protocol for securely computing the Hamming distance between binary sequences is developed and is shown, using the informationtheoretic security conditions, to be secure under both the active and passive <b>behavioral</b> <b>models.</b> In contrast, the general techniques of [1] and [2] require at least four parties when dealing with the active <b>behavioral</b> <b>model.</b> In particular, for the three-party problem considered herein, the BGW protocol that securely computes the squared l 2 distance between sequences under the passive <b>behavioral</b> <b>model</b> is demonstrated to be insecure under the active <b>behavioral</b> <b>model,</b> even for binary sequences when the squared l 2 distance coincides with the Hamming distance...|$|R

40|$|Fuzzy {{rules have}} been used to model complex human {{behavior}} in order to develop sophisticated industrial control systems. The use of fuzzy rules to create a <b>behavioral</b> <b>model</b> provides a quantitative basis for discussing the contribution of elements of the model to theories about the behavior. The application of a protocol and tool simplifies the development of a <b>behavioral</b> <b>model</b> from observational data. Extraction of a high level, linguistic <b>behavioral</b> <b>model</b> from the observational data is used to discover knowledge about the data. Tuning of the model is accomplished by parameter optimization through the adjustment of membership functions using the genetic fuzzy, self-adaptive system. A case study demonstrating the use of the protocol and tool is presented.

Trainees who went through a <b>behavioral</b> <b>modeling</b> program did much better in assessment centers. Created by Mel Sorcher and Arnold Goldstein, behavior modeling approached supervisor and management training as skill development, rather than an effort to provide cognitive understanding of why people behave as they do. The common methodology at that time was lectures. With Jim Robinson, a training manager from Agway, Byham developed the first commercial behavior modeling training system, called Interaction Management. Every year, more than one million people are trained using this methodology.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} and validates a {{power flow}} <b>behavioral</b> <b>model</b> {{of a gas}} tur- bine engine with a gas generator and free power turbine. “Simple” mathematical expressions to describe the engine’s power flow are derived from an understand- ing of basic thermodynamic and mechanical interactions taking place within the engine. The engine <b>behavioral</b> <b>model</b> presented is suitable for developing a supervisory level controller of an electrical power system that contains the en- gine connected to a generator and a large interconnection of many components, e. g., a naval ship power system powered by gas turbine engines. First principles engine models do not lend themselves to the preceding control development be- cause of their high granularity. The basis of the <b>behavioral</b> <b>model</b> development is the balance of energy flow across engine components; power flow is obtained by taking the time derivative of the energy flow. The <b>behavioral</b> <b>model</b> of a spe- cific engine utilizes constants and empirical fits of power conversion efficiencies obtained from data collected from a high-fidelity engine simulator. <b>Behavioral</b> <b>models</b> for a GE LM 2500 and an engine similar to a GE T 700 are constructed; the 2 -norm normalized error between the simulator and <b>behavioral</b> <b>model</b> out- puts for both engines is 3. 5 % or less...|$|R
