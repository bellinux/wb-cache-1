5|$|Karl Marx {{distinguished}} {{social classes}} by their {{connection to the}} means of production in the capitalist system: the bourgeoisie own the means, but this effectively includes the proletariat itself as the workers can only sell their own labour power (forming the material base of the cultural superstructure). Max Weber critiqued Marxist economic determinism, arguing that social stratification is not based purely on economic inequalities, but on other status and power differentials (e.g. patriarchy). According to Weber, stratification may occur among at least three complex variables: (1) Property (class): A person's economic position in a society, based on birth and individual achievement. Weber differs from Marx in that he does not see this as the supreme factor in stratification. Weber noted how managers of corporations or industries control firms they do not own; Marx would have placed such a person in the proletariat. (2) Prestige (status): A person's prestige, or popularity in a society. This could be determined <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> job this person does or wealth. and (3) Power (political party): A person's ability to get their way despite the resistance of others. For example, individuals in state jobs, such as an employee of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, or a member of the United States Congress, may hold little property or status but they still hold immense power Pierre Bourdieu provides a modern example in the concepts of cultural and symbolic capital. Theorists such as Ralf Dahrendorf have noted the tendency towards an enlarged middle-class in modern Western societies, particularly in relation to the necessity of an educated work force in technological or service-based economies. Perspectives concerning globalization, such as dependency theory, suggest this effect owes to the shift of workers to the developing countries.|$|E

25|$|A lot {{of modern}} {{criticism}} {{tries to find}} hidden structure or some unifying principle within the odes. 19th century criticism favoured 'gnomic unity' i.e. that each ode is bound together <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> moralizing or philosophic vision typical of archaic Gnomic poetry. Later critics sought unity in the way certain words or images are repeated and developed within a particular ode. For others, the odes are just celebrations of men and their communities, in which the elements such as myths, piety, and ethics are stock themes that the poet introduces without much real thought. Some conclude that the requirement for unity is too modern to have informed Pindar's ancient approach to a traditional craft.|$|E
25|$|The {{calculation}} of prior probabilities depends on available {{data from the}} genome being studied, {{and the type of}} analysis being performed. For studies where good reference data containing frequencies of known mutations is available (for example, in studying human genome data), these known frequencies of genotypes in the population can be used to estimate priors. Given population wide allele frequencies, prior genotype probabilities can be calculated at each locus according to the Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium. In the absence of such data, constant priors can be used, independent of the locus. These can be set using heuristically chosen values, possibly informed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> variations being sought by the study. Alternatively, supervised machine-learning procedures have been investigated that seek to learn optimal prior values for individuals in a sample, using supplied NGS data from these individuals.|$|E

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has received an average score of 64 out of 100, based on 32 reviews. Rob Mitchum of Pitchfork criticised Songs of Innocence for [...] "aim for a one-size-fits-all, vaguely inspirational tone, with a lean approach to details despite the press kit assertion that it's all 'very, very personal'". Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune said U2 [...] "sounded as impersonal as ever" [...] {{and that the}} album was [...] "flat and strangely complacent", while finding the more personal songs derivative of contemporary rock bands such as Imagine Dragons and Airborne Toxic Event. In a review for The Guardian, Caspar Llewellyn Smith wrote that U2 was [...] "treading old ground without much {{of a sense of}} how to move forward." [...] Ben Patashnik of NME said only [...] "Iris", [...] "Song for Someone", and [...] "Every Breaking Wave" [...] were [...] "standouts", and he criticised the release strategy, judging [...] "the fact it's free makes it seem cheap." [...] Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine deemed the album a thematic success that was [...] "otherwise marred <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> slick MOR pablum that plagued the band's last few efforts". Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic felt U2 did not challenge themselves sonically and that the album represents the contradictions in the band's music: [...] "They camouflage their nostalgia in the sound of modernity; they play gigantic music about intimacy... They want to be everything to everyone and, in attempting to do so, they've wound up with a record that appeals to a narrow audience".|$|E

2500|$|Early {{attempts}} at mutagenesis using radiation or chemical mutagens were non-site-specific, generating random mutations. [...] Analogs of nucleotides and other chemicals were later {{used to generate}} localized point mutations, examples of such chemicals are aminopurine, nitrosoguanidine, and bisulfite. [...] Site-directed mutagenesis was achieved in 1974 in the laboratory of Charles Weissmann using a nucleotide analogue N4-hydroxycytidine, which induces transition of GC to AT. These methods of mutagenesis, however, are limited <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> mutation they can achieve, {{and they are not}} as specific as later site-directed mutagenesis methods.|$|E

In particular, to maintain independent {{labor unions and}} political opposition in Vietnam, Rustin and others gave critical support to U.S. military intervention in the Vietnam War, while calling for a negotiated peace treaty and democratic elections. Rustin criticized the specific conduct of the war, though. For instance, in a fundraising letter sent to War Resisters League supporters in 1964, Rustin wrote of being [...] "angered and humiliated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> war being waged, a war of torture, a war in which civilians are being machine gunned from the air, and in which American napalm bombs are being dropped on the villages." ...|$|E
2500|$|Horace's Ars Poetica {{is second}} only to Aristotle's Poetics in its {{influence}} on literary theory and criticism. Milton recommended both works in his treatise of Education. Horace's Satires and Epistles however also had a huge impact, influencing theorists and critics such as John Dryden. There was considerable debate over the value of different lyrical forms for contemporary poets, as represented on one hand <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> four-line stanzas made familiar by Horace's Sapphic and Alcaic Odes and, on the other, the loosely structured Pindarics associated with the odes of Pindar. Translations occasionally involved scholars in the dilemmas of censorship. Thus Christopher Smart entirely omitted Odes [...] and re-numbered the remaining odes. He also removed the ending of Odes [...] Thomas Creech printed Epodes [...] and [...] in the original Latin but left out their English translations. Philip Francis left out both the English and Latin for those same two epodes, a gap in the numbering [...] the only indication that something was amiss. French editions of Horace were influential in England and these too were regularly bowdlerized.|$|E

2500|$|The fallacy {{was first}} {{described}} in a 1985 paper by Amos Tversky, Thomas Gilovich, and Robert Vallone. The [...] "Hot Hand in Basketball" [...] study questioned the theory that basketball players have [...] "hot hands", which the paper defined as the claim that players {{are more likely to}} make a successful shot if their previous shot was successful. The study looked at the inability of respondents to properly understand randomness and random events; much like innumeracy can impair a person's judgement of statistical information, the hot hand fallacy can lead people to form incorrect assumptions regarding random events. The three researchers provide an example in the study regarding the [...] "coin toss"; respondents expected even short sequences of heads and tails to be approximately 50% heads and 50% tails. The study proposed two biases that are created <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> thought pattern applied to the coin toss: it could lead an individual to believe that the probability of heads or tails increases after a long sequence of either has occurred (known as the gambler's fallacy); or it could cause an individual to reject randomness due to a belief that a streak of either outcome is not representative of a random sample.|$|E
2500|$|While {{working with}} the cerebellum, Kreitzer's group also {{discovered}} that depolarization of Purkinje cells could also cause a temporary reduction in excitatory input into these cells from both climbing fibres and parallel fibres (Kreitzer et al. 2001b). [...] This phenomenon was termed depolarization-induced suppression of excitation (DSE), and differs from DSI only <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> neurotransmitter whose release is reduced. [...] In the case of depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition, {{the result is a}} reduction in inhibitory GABA release, while in DSE the effect is a reduction in excitatory glutamate release. [...] DSE was also found to occur in other regions of the brain, however the evidence for the involvement of the endocannabinoid receptor CB1 in this process is not as solid as it is for DSI. [...] Both depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition and DSE have been studied in the CB1 knock-out mice. [...] Some groups show that both depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition and DSE are lacking in these mice, while others have shown that DSE, but not depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition, can still be evoked in the knock-outs (Ohno-Shosaku et al. 2002, Hajos et al. 2001). [...] The endocannabinoids may still mediate DSE too, but by acting at a yet unknown cannabinoid receptor. [...] Interestingly, some work has shown that anandamide can bind to the vannilloid receptor VR1, the receptor responsible for mediating the effects of capsaicin. [...] This receptor is present in the brain, and anandamide actions at this receptor may potentially contribute to DSE (Cristino et al. 2006, Hajos et al. 2002). [...] However DSE is currently a largely unexplored phenomenon and {{more research is needed to}} draw any firm conclusions.|$|E
