40|$|Air {{transport}} {{is subject}} to various risks. One of them is <b>bird</b> <b>strike</b> <b>hazard.</b> Despite numerous regulations concerning prevention from this type of occurrence, {{it is not possible}} to eliminate them entirely. Bird strikes most often take place during take-off and landing, that is on or in the vicinity of an airport. For that reason airport operators are the first parties that can be made accountable for this occurence. International law imposes numerous responsibilities on airport operators in terms of <b>bird</b> <b>strike</b> <b>hazard</b> prevention on air operations, thus placing airport operators in a “key position” in the system of safety. However, the party that suffers significant damages in the first instance, is the aircraft operator. If a bird strike takes place on or in the vicinity of an airport, an aicraft operator can sue the airport operator for compensation of damages. Generally, the issue of indemnity {{is subject to}} out of court negotiations, however instances in which there is a lack of agreement between the parties, i. e. airport operator, aircraft operator or their insurers, lead to legal proceedings for compensation. This article attempts to illustrate the relationship between air traffic participants such as airport operators and aircraft operators in connection with their obligations and liability, particulary taking into account the legal obligations of an airport operator...|$|E

40|$|Despite almost 40 {{years of}} {{research}} effort and operational experience, there remains very limited consensus concerning the best methods for managing the <b>bird</b> <b>strike</b> <b>hazard</b> at aerodromes. This is, in part, because the levels of risk, habitat type and bird species present at different aerodromes varies and the precise techniques that are successful at one site may not work at another. It is also partly {{due to differences in}} the levels of resources available at different airports and to differences in the attitude of airport managers and national regulators to the hazard posed by bird strikes. Following the implementation of the new ICAO standards on airport bird control, IBSC agreed at the 26 th meeting in Warsaw that a set of recommended minimum best practices should be developed to try and address these problems.

40|$|Bird {{aircraft}} collisions (<b>bird</b> <b>strikes)</b> are {{a recognized}} safety hazard and land uses that attract birds hazardous to aircraft {{should be avoided}} on and near airports. Many airfields contain large areas of anthropogenic grassland habitats, often dominated by cool season grasses. Land managed as native warm season grasses (NWSG) potentially could increase <b>bird</b> <b>strike</b> <b>hazards</b> on and near airports by attracting hazardous birds and harboring small mammals that are prey for hazardous raptors. We investigated bird and small mammal communities at three NWSG areas and three adjacent on airfield grassland areas in western Ohio, U. S. A. to determine whether NWSG increased <b>bird</b> <b>strike</b> <b>hazards.</b> Species specific differences in bird abundance and density were evident between the two landcover types, presumably the result of differences in plant community characteristics. Seven species of birds were found exclusively in NWSG or airfield grasslands. Birds of species categorized as ‘moderate’ to ‘extremely high’ in regard to hazard (severity) level to aircraft accounted for only 6 % and 2 % of all birds observed in airfield grasslands and NWSG areas, respectively. Small mammal capture success was approximately three times higher in NWSG areas, although raptor abundance did not differ between the two landcover types. Our findings suggest that NWSG might be considered a viable land use adjacent to airfields; however, similar research at additional locations, including larger NWSG areas, should be conducted...|$|R

40|$|Among {{the many}} sensors {{available}} {{to detect and}} track bird movement on airports, few provide a satisfactory capacity to both monitor bird flight and the capability to rapidly review, update, and improve monitoring capabilities. The Vectorial Three Dimension Bird Flight (V 3 DBF) Monitoring System has been developed to provide detection and analysis of bird movement using digital images and advanced image analysis technology. The sensor system is capable of identifying bird targets and using geometric relationships between sensors and the targets to identify the range and altitude of birds. The rapid refresh rate of the system allows horizontal and vertical tracking of bird targets. Detection algorithms can be automatically updated for species present and system output provides movement tracks in relation to geographic features such as runways. It is also possible to integrate system detection tracks with GIS. Because the digital images are retained, a complete record of detection and corresponding data processing is available to check accuracy and evaluate {{the performance of the}} system in a given airport setting. The present system operates using two sensors, but can be expanded to provide multiple sensors and coverage of large areas. Present V 3 DBF system capabilities have been expanded beyond detection and tracking to include <b>bird</b> <b>strike</b> <b>hazard</b> assessment and hazard warning based on track intersection with critical airspace...|$|E

40|$|Bird strike {{reporting}} {{is becoming increasingly}} important as airport operators, airlines and government aviation authorities are requesting their staff to report all bird strike occurrences. In South Africa the Endangered Wildlife Trust has been managing an integrated bird and wildlife hazard management program at ten airports managed by the Airports Company South Africa {{for the past seven}} years. In an attempt to best understand the <b>bird</b> <b>strike</b> <b>hazard</b> at the various airports a bird strike definition has been adopted which includes the reporting of carcass remain retrieved from the runways through to the more serious incidents where damage was reported to the aircraft. Numerous occurrences have been reported at the airports during this period – several of which only involved carcass remains or strikes with small birds having no effect on the aircraft. In response to requests from both the airport authorities and local airlines a system has been developed to rate bird strike occurrences based on their severity and in so doing provide more meaningful statistical feedback to the airport and airline management. The approach taken involve using factors such as known high risk bird species occurring at the airport, whether or not damage was done to the aircraft etc. to rate all the bird strikes which occurred at the respective airport. This paper will explain in detail the approach taken to rate the severity and risk of bird strike occurrences at airports and in so doing provide more meaningful statistical feedback to decision makers...|$|E

40|$|Brazil built {{one of the}} world’s largest {{aeronautical}} infrastructures. The airport net {{is distributed}} along its vast territory, which shows a tremendous ecosystem variety. Having a large civilian aircraft fleet and also running second after Venezuela in catalogued bird species, Brazil has had problems related to bird strikes. Nevertheless, Brazil {{is made up of}} 26 States plus the Federal District. Thus, besides the Union Government, each state holds its own government structure. The states are divided into counties that also have their own administrative structure. The jurisdiction of each level of government is established by the Federal Constitution, laws and others legal acts. Therefore, solutions for bird strike hazards, whose root causes are spread into all three government levels, encompass many institutions and require an orchestrated co-ordination.

40|$|Every year {{billions of}} birds migrate from {{breeding}} areas to their wintering ranges, some travelling over 10, 000 km. Stakeholders interested in aviation flight safety, spread of disease, conservation, education, urban planning, meteorology, wind turbines and bird migration ecology {{are interested in}} information on bird movements. Collecting and disseminating useful information about such mobile creatures exhibiting diverse behaviour is no simple task. However, ESA’s Integrated Application Promotion (IAP) programme may provide the solution with its system of systems philosophy, integrating space (Telecommunication, Navigation, Remote Sensing and Meteorology) assets in combination with terrestrial systems. FlySafe sustainable services could provide access to various existing radar systems and observation networks collecting information on bird migration, tracking of individual birds, enhancement of existing technologies, modelling tools, improved access to environmental data and web services. In the present situation radar measurements of birds are not comparable between countries and are covering {{only a part of}} Europe. One of the main motivations for air forces to participate in ESA FlySafe is {{to reduce the number of}} damaging bird strikes without unbalanced interference with the operations. This can be reached by automatic generation of ad-hoc warnings and timely reliable predictions of increased <b>bird</b> <b>strike</b> <b>hazard.</b> The aim of FlySafe is to develop such a bird warning system of systems in Europe. Currently four air forces (Germany, France, Belgium and The Netherlands), several research and academic institutes as well as industrial partners are participating in this initiative.

In addition, the movements of individual birds are tracked globally from space. Finally, the prediction in both time and space of bird migration within the measurement area will be discussed...|$|E
40|$|Santa Barbara Municipal Airport (SBA) {{is located}} in and {{adjacent}} to Goleta Slough, a large coastal salt marsh with limited tidal circulation. Various government and non-government agencies are pursuing a long-term project to restore the historic tidal circulation to the slough to improve ecological conditions. SBA recently completed a study to assess feasibility of conducting a controlled field experiment in the slough to evaluate the relationship between bird strike hazards {{and the presence of}} tidal and non-tidal wetlands near the airfield. The study indicated that a limited field experiment, in which new estuarine marsh areas are temporarily restored, would provide valuable empirical data on bird behavior and strike hazards. The study included provisions to ensure public safety during the experiment. The information from the field experiment will be used to determine the viability of a larger, long-term wetland restoration program in Goleta Slough, and appropriate <b>bird</b> <b>strike</b> <b>hazard</b> management actions. The need to conduct the Feasibility Study was an outgrowth of SBA’s Master Plan update process, which began in 1991. The FAA’s highest priority project identified in the Master Plan is to extend the Runway Safety Areas at either of the principal runway 7 - 25, which will necessarily impact the surrounding Goleta Slough coastal estuary. Over the last 10 years, SBA has worked closely with federal, state, and local regulatory agencies, as well as the environmental community, to develop a restoration plan for the slough that would provide the basis for the Runway Safety Area project mitigation requirements. As the Master Plan moved through the environmental assessment phase of the approval process, it became apparent that one of the main tenants of the slough plan, the restoration of tidal circulation, could potentially exacerbate the incidence of bird strikes. As the debate began to heat-up among the environmental community, USDA/Wildlife Services, SBA, and the FAA, the approval process ground to a halt. Finally, a compromise was struck in 1998 that bifurcated the Master Plan update process and the tidal restoration project. All parties agreed that prior to any further consideration of a tidal restoration project, scientific data was needed to better understand the relationship between coastal estuarine habitat, seasonal wetlands, and the incidence of bird strikes. Thus, the Master Plan update identified a mitigation plan without tidal restoration, which ultimately included a 4 : 1 replacement ratio for the seasonal wetlands impacted by the Runway Safety project. On a parallel tract, all parties also agreed to move forward in a deliberate and incremental fashion towards a managed experiment to test these relationships between habitats and bird strikes...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} 20 years, the Israeli Air Force (IAF) has focused {{attention}} in <b>bird</b> <b>strike</b> prevention on collisions between aircraft and migrating birds during low-level flight operations. Only {{in the last}} 2 years has the IAF begun to tackle the problem of reducing bird-aircraft collisions at or near airfields. A dramatic shift in thinking has led the IAF to initiate complete wildlife control programs at its airbases, featuring the employment of border collies and wildlife control officers to help eliminate the risk of wildlife collisions within the control zone (CTR) of each airfield. As a crucial component of this program, the IAF has initiated major changes in habitat management at airfields, eliminating agricultural initiatives and undergoing large-scale modifications in airfield maintenance practices. Additionally, the IAF has altered flight and ground operations where possible to attenuate the risk imposed by birds and has coordinated efforts within various departments at each airbase to address <b>bird</b> <b>strike</b> control issues. Awareness and the resolve to eliminate wildlife hazards at its airfields are key features to the IAF’s new directive on <b>bird</b> <b>strike</b> prevention. Though still in its infancy, the IAF’s new wildlife control program has already shown dramatic improvements in the reduction of <b>bird</b> <b>strike</b> <b>hazards</b> at airbases. In light of results achieved during this short time frame, it would indicate that use of border collies can be a highly effective mechanism for the IAF to combat <b>bird</b> <b>strike</b> problems.

40|$|Bird-aircraft {{collisions}} {{present a}} significant threat to military and commercial aircraft, and as bird populations and air traffic continue to grow, and airport/airbase operations continue to expand, {{the problem will}} steadily get worse. To help mitigate <b>bird</b> <b>strike</b> <b>hazards,</b> we propose a multi-sensor system consisting of ground radar and acoustic sensors that can directly monitor bird activity and provide an alert when a threat condition occurs. Radar offers a large detection range {{and the ability to}} detect in all weather conditions, while acoustic sensors allow the ability to detect targets in the midst of clutter and add the capability to classify. A multi-sensor approach ensures that the system can provide <b>bird</b> <b>strike</b> monitoring capability in any situation with a low false alarm rate. As the Phase II effort of an Air Force STTR project, we have constructed and tested a microphone array adapted from state-of-the-art undersea warfare sensor technology that measures accurate angles to any acoustic source (broadband or narrowband) and a parabolic dish microphone which provides high-gain data on targets of interest. A test was conducted near Panama City / Bay County International Airport in conjunction with the Merlin Bird Detection Radar designed by DeTect, Inc. Results of this test will be presented and show that the acoustic array is capable of detecting, localizing in angle, and tracking multiple targets simultaneously, including birds, bats, aircraft, automobiles, people, and boats. The parabolic dish microphone was able to provide very high-gain acoustic data on several of these targets.

S. Air Force (USAF). This study sampled the entire population of AMC airfields with BASH Phase II flight restrictions. The test period consisted of damaging birdstrike data collected 5 years before BASH Phase II operations began (1991 - 1995), and the years during BASH Phase II (1996 - 2000). It was hypothesized that since the implementation of BASH Phase II flight restrictions, there had been no significant reduction to the number of birdstrikes on AMC aircraft. During the period before BASH Phase II flight restrictions (1991 - 1995), AMC had a total of 35 reported damaging birdstrikes during the historic Phase II periods. Damaging birdstrikes increased in AMC to 44 from 1996 - 2000, when Phase II flight restrictions were imposed at these bases. The study concluded that not only was there no significant reduction in damaging birdstrikes, there was actually a 21 % increase of damaging birdstrikes, AMC wide. To date, there has been no known test of the USAF BASH Phase II program to determine if it has been successful...|$|R
40|$|The United States Air Force (USAF) <b>Bird</b> Aircraft <b>Strike</b> <b>Hazard</b> (BASH) Team {{has been}} {{developing}} versions of a Bird Avoidance Model (BAM) since the early 1980 ’s. In the developmental phases of the first models, it was recognized that avoiding birds on low-level routes and ranges was the only solution to the significant problem of <b>bird</b> <b>strikes</b> to these military operations nationwide. The early versions of BAM were limited in coverage, biological data, and resolution. With the advent of sophisticated Geographic Information System (GIS) technology and advances in computational capability, modern versions of the USAF BAM have become increasingly robust and user friendly. The current version of BAM, released to the USAF in 1999, incorporates data layers from many sources to display risk surfaces at 1 km resolution for the entire continental United States for each two-week period {{of the year and}} four daily time periods. Data on over 60 bird species considered most hazardous to flight operations, hundreds of environmental variables, infrastructure, and aeronautical charts are incorporated into the model. The user interface is a menu-driven package that allows pilots and schedulers to assess hazards on chosen routes with minimal effort in minutes. More sophisticated analyses are possible for other user groups. Preliminary reports from the user community have indicated savings of several million dollars in USAF aircraft assets {{in the first year of}} operation. Demand from the military community outside the continental US and the civil aviation community indicates a necessity for expansion of the BAM to other areas of the world and for continued refinement of data layers. International cooperation in the development of models will be necessary to ensure more global coverage and compatibility of systems between cooperating nations. The USAF has demonstrated its willingness to share its technology and experience to ensure such interoperability between cooperating agencies and nations...|$|R
40|$|Edwards Air Force Base (AFB) {{scheduled}} {{the construction}} of a runway in the spring of 2007. The runway would be in an area that contained migratory birds and their habitat. The construction project would be near Edwards AFB main runway and had the potential not only to impact species protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA), including the burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia), but also to increase <b>bird</b> and wildlife–aircraft <b>strike</b> <b>hazards</b> in the active flightline areas. To discourage nesting in the project area, reduce the potential for <b>bird</b> and wildlife–aircraft <b>strikes,</b> and maintain compliance with federal environmental law, more than 400 potential nesting burrows and nesting habitat (e. g., trees, shrubs, and cacti) were removed prior to the nesting season and construction activities. The project footprint was routinely resurveyed to ensure migratory birds did not move back into the project area. As of May 31, 2007, approximately 890 ha were surveyed, compliance with the MBTA was maintained, bird–aircraft strikes did not increase, and the project schedule was not impacted. Removing migratory bird nesting habitat prior to the nesting season was instrumental in reducing the potential for <b>bird</b> and wildlife–aircraft <b>strikes</b> and maintaining compliance with federal law. This removal strategy can be employed in other large-scale construction projects...|$|R
40|$|Management {{of problem}} {{wildlife}} within the airfield environment {{is a difficult}} job. Today’s Bird–Animal Aircraft <b>Strike</b> <b>Hazard</b> (BASH) program managers require {{as much information as}} possible to accomplish their tasks. Bird censuses and actual bird-strike events in and around the air operations area are used to make airfield management decisions and to assess the risk of bird hazards to aircraft. Both types of information are sampled rather sparsely. Avian radar is now being used as a new tool to provide continuous sampling of bird activity that significantly supplements visual censuses. The measure of risk used today is commonly expressed as the ratio of the number of <b>bird</b> <b>strikes</b> per 100, 000 flying hours. While important, this measure of risk is relatively insensitive to improvements in safety measures that do not result in dramatically fewer <b>bird</b> <b>strikes.</b> Stated differently, a reduction in safety or an increase in risk (which reflects an increased likelihood of <b>bird</b> <b>strikes</b> occurring) is not anticipated, but, rather, it is calculated after the fact when increases in <b>bird</b> <b>strikes</b> have been experienced. As a result, BASH managers are at a disadvantage because they can respond only after <b>bird</b> <b>strikes</b> occur. To address this deficiency, we introduce a new method for assessing risk that is based on near-miss events that complements risk calculations based on reported <b>bird</b> <b>strikes.</b> Recent advances in commercially available, digital avian tracking radars enabled biologists to automatically monitor and assess near-miss events. Near-miss events occur much more frequently than <b>bird</b> <b>strikes.</b> A combined dataset of <b>bird</b> <b>strikes</b> and near-misses provides BASH managers with a more responsive metric to evaluate the success of their program over time than by using only the bird-strike dataset...|$|R
40|$|Airports use <b>bird</b> <b>strike</b> {{statistics}} {{to determine whether}} or not their bird control programs are necessary and effective. For example, each year Transport Canada publishes the number of <b>bird</b> <b>strikes</b> at Canadian airports and analyzes data from airports with the most strikes. While we often relate the number of strikes to the number of aircraft movements, we seldom relate the number of strikes to the hazardous species of birds. Richard Dolbeer and his co-authors (2000) ranked species according to their hazards to aviation based on the risk of damage or effect on flight they pose. I present a method for a cummulative measure of <b>bird</b> <b>strikes</b> that takes into account the level of hazard posed by each strike. The method is simple and allows comparison between years and among airports around the world. It also provides managers with a quantitative measure of the overall <b>strike</b> <b>hazard</b> and provides incentive for them to focus on hazardous species...|$|R
