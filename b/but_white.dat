5|$|Amazings {{reputation}} {{had been}} for formulaic science fiction almost since it began, <b>but</b> <b>White</b> {{was able to bring}} the magazine to a higher standard than any other editor except Cele Goldsmith, and gave Amazing a respectable position in the field. His successors were not able to maintain the level of quality that he achieved.|$|E
5|$|In the present, when Eddie, Pink, and White return, Orange {{tries to}} {{convince}} them that Blonde planned to kill them and steal the diamonds for himself. Eddie kills Nash and accuses Orange of lying, since Blonde was loyal to his father. Joe arrives with news that the police have killed Blue. He is about to execute Orange, <b>but</b> <b>White</b> intervenes and holds Joe at gunpoint. Eddie points his own weapon at White, creating a Mexican standoff. All three shoot; both Cabots are killed, and White and Orange are wounded.|$|E
5|$|On March 29, 1968, King went to Memphis, Tennessee, {{in support}} of the black {{sanitary}} public works employees, who were represented by AFSCME Local 1733. The workers had been on strike since March 12 for higher wages and better treatment. In one incident, black street repairmen received pay for two hours when they were sent home because of bad weather, <b>but</b> <b>white</b> employees were paid for the full day.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 15-21.5 mm. The forewings {{are white}} and the hindwings are brownish gray along the front edge, <b>but</b> <b>whiter</b> in the back portion.|$|R

5|$|The Budapest Gambit saw a {{short-lived}} revival in 1984–85 when Chess Informant included three games (as many {{as in the}} previous fifteen years), all played at a high level of competition, and all won by Black. <b>But</b> <b>White</b> players found reinforcements and even invented a line with 4.e3 and 5.Nh3. In the 21st century, despite Shakhriyar Mamedyarov's successful efforts to rehabilitate the line 4.Bf4 g5, the Budapest Gambit almost never appears at the highest level. Its most recent appearance was when Richárd Rapport defeated Boris Gelfand with Black using the opening in round 2 of the 2014 Tata Steel Chess competition.|$|E
5|$|The {{village of}} Chana {{was founded in}} 1871, half a mile {{northwest}} of White Oak School, which was built in 1869. Chana's early settlers sent their children to White Oak School up to eighth grade, <b>but</b> <b>White</b> Oak was abandoned in 1883 when Chana School was built in a park in Chana. The White Oak building {{was used as a}} storage barn for hay until a fire destroyed it in 1886. In 1893, a second classroom was added to the existing structure of Chana School.|$|E
5|$|When the Vipers {{began the}} playoffs {{on the road}} against the Maine Red Claws on April 11, White did not travel with the team. The Vipers went on to sweep all three playoff series, <b>but</b> <b>White</b> did not play with the team. Over {{the course of the}} season, White {{traveled}} using a bus provided by the Rockets for 15 road games.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 14-19 mm. The ground colour of the forewings is pale greyish ferruginous, strigulated (finely streaked) with {{rust and}} with rust brown markings. The hindwings are pale brownish cream, <b>but</b> <b>whiter</b> basally.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 17 mm. The ground colour of the forewings is grey with weak brownish-grey short lines. The markings are brownish grey. The hindwings are grey brown, <b>but</b> <b>whiter</b> towards the base.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 10 mm. The ground colour of the forewings is whitish cream, but the reticulation (net-like pattern) and some larger strigulae (fine streaks) are brownish. The hindwings are grey, <b>but</b> <b>whiter</b> basally.|$|R
5|$|As White had {{expected}} the survivors to {{fight their way}} out of Ngok Tavak, he made the decision to leave the dead allied soldiers behind; the decision caused distress amongst the survivors of the battle, <b>but</b> <b>White</b> believed evacuating the deceased soldiers through enemy lines would have been suicidal. After the Marines and Mobile Strike Force personnel had destroyed their unneeded equipment, they were directed to form an order-of-march out of Ngok Tavak, {{in order to protect the}} wounded and those with little infantry experience. Just before they left the garrison, Cameron blew up the first CH-46 helicopter that was still intact on the landing zone, using the M-72 anti-tank weapon. The order-of-march was led by a group of Nung soldiers, who were followed by White and the survivors of the Marine artillery detachment, and behind them was another group of Nung soldiers covering the tail of the column. Together they evaded VC formations surrounding the hill feature of Ngok Tavak and marched eastward towards Khâm Đức.|$|E
5|$|Bond beats Le Chiffre at {{the poker}} table, but Lynd is kidnapped by Le Chiffre after the game, as is Bond, who is {{captured}} whilst pursuing them; Lynd is ransomed {{for the money}} and Bond is tortured. Le Chiffre is subsequently killed by Mr. White, a liaison between Le Chiffre {{and a number of}} his clients. Bond learns that his poker winnings were never repaid to the Treasury, which Lynd was supposed to have done, and Bond establishes that she was a double agent. Bond pursues her and is attacked by members of White's organisation: he survives, <b>but</b> <b>White</b> takes the money and Lynd sacrifices herself in exchange for Bond's life, as he later finds out from M. Bond subsequently finds and captures White.|$|E
5|$|By a 5–4 margin, {{the justices}} {{reversed}} the conviction, agreeing that Jacobson had been entrapped, on April 6, 1992. It {{has since been}} reported that {{this was one of}} the rare cases where the decision changed after arguments. The original poll of the justices showed a 7–2 majority for affirmance, with only White and Stevens holding out. <b>But</b> <b>White</b> argued persuasively for reversal to his fellow Justices, and Blackmun and Clarence Thomas, who had replaced Marshall, changed their minds. It has been suggested that Thomas, who later established a reputation for allowing wide latitude to law enforcement similar to other contemporary Republican appointees, was especially sensitive at that time to Jacobson's situation due to the sexual harassment allegations raised by Anita Hill during his own recent confirmation hearings.|$|E
5000|$|The blog was {{originally}} anonymous <b>but</b> <b>White's</b> identity was eventually uncovered. White's fellow (active) bloggers (anonymous or known to various degrees) include Adam, Charles, David, Derrick, Grandy, Marc, Patrick, and a bovine character named Via Angus.|$|R

5|$|On April 19, 1861, {{following}} {{the outbreak of}} the American Civil War, White enlisted as a Private in the Hampshire Guards, which later became Company K within the 13th Virginia Volunteer Infantry Regiment of the Army of Virginia. While Company K was under the command of Captain John B. Sherrard, White was promoted to Third Sergeant. White's company under the command of Sherrard departed Romney in June 1861. Within four to five months, White was successively promoted through the non-commissioned officer ranks to Sergeant Major and acting Adjutant of the 13th Virginia Infantry. He was further promoted to Adjutant, <b>but</b> <b>White</b> did not receive a commission. White served in the 13th Virginia Infantry for {{a little over a year}} until he was discharged from his service on account of a disability. White had developed typhoid fever and was ordered to recover in a hospital in Staunton.|$|E
5|$|The Mounties {{convince}} Kripik {{to come to}} {{the post}} to answer questions, and Kripik agrees. Several months pass. Hunt and Balk give Kripik the freedom of the post, and Hunt learns about the horrors the white traders visited on the Eskimo. When the Eskimo village moves on to new hunting rounds, Kripik's family stays behind to wait for him. They begin to starve, and Kripik learns of their plight. However, the rigid and rule-bound Inspector White has arrived at the RCMP outpost, and he demands that Kripik not only no longer be allowed to hunt during the day but also be chained down in his bed at night. Hunt tries to dissuade White, <b>but</b> <b>White</b> insists — and Hunt is forced to break his word that Kripik will not be chained.|$|E
5|$|The move 4.Nf3 {{develops}} a piece and covers the sensitive d2-square. After 4...Bb4+ 5.Nbd2Nc6 6.a3 Black can easily get {{confused by the}} move-order. The natural 6...Nxd2 7.Bxd2 Bxd2+ 8.Qxd2 Qe7 9.Qc3 transposes {{in the same position}} as after 5.Bd2, <b>but</b> <b>White</b> can also try 6...Nxd2 7.axb4! Nxf3+ 8.gxf3 Nxe5 9.Rg1 Qe7 10.Ra3! with a strong initiative. White can even retain his bishop with 6...Nxd2 7.Nxd2 and now Borik recommends 7...Bf8 with difficult play for Black as he is not certain to gain his pawn back. To avoid these possibilities Lalic advises the move-order 6...Bxd2+ 7.Bxd2 Nxd2 8.Qxd2 Qe7, but does not mention the possibility of White answering 6...Bxd2+ with 7.Nxd2. A possible improvement for Black (after 4...Bb4+ 5.Nbd2) would be 5...d5 with compensation for the pawn in all lines.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 30 mm. The ground colour of the forewings is pale brownish cream, <b>but</b> <b>whiter</b> along the costa and dorsum and sprinkled with cinnamon brown. The hindwings are cream with pale greyish strigulation (fine streaks).|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 14-17 mm. The ground colour of the forewings is grey, <b>but</b> <b>whiter</b> dorsally. The strigulation (fine streaking) is dark {{grey and}} the markings are grey strigulated with dark grey. The hindwings are greyish cream, with grey strigulation.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 15 mm. The ground colour of the forewings {{consists of}} a triangular white blotch before the mid-dorsum and a cream sprinkled brown basal area. The remaining area is brown. The hindwings are greyish brown, <b>but</b> <b>whiter</b> basally.|$|R
5|$|The mystacial vibrissae (whiskers on {{the upper}} lips) reach {{the tips of the}} ears when pressed against the head. The short, rounded ears {{themselves}} are naked on the inside, but covered with short brown hairs on the outer surface. Females have three pairs of mammae. The digits and metapodials are mostly covered by white hairs. Short ungual tufts of hairs surrounding the bases of the claws are present. There are five pads on the forefeet and six on the hindfeet. On the hindfeet, the fifth digit is nearly as long as the middle three and the first (the hallux) is much shorter. The tail is longer than the head and body and appears naked for most of its length, but fine hairs are visible near the tip. Although the lower side is slightly lighter, there is no clear difference in coloration between the upper and lower sides. The skin of the tail is gray, and it is covered lightly by fine hairs that are dark brown over most of the length of the tail, <b>but</b> <b>white</b> near the tip.|$|E
5|$|Tillman believed, {{and often}} stated as senator, that blacks must submit to either white {{domination}} or extermination. He {{was reluctant to}} undertake the latter, fearing hundreds of whites would die accomplishing it. He campaigned in the violent 1898 North Carolina elections, in which white Democrats were determined to take back control from a biracial Populist-Republican coalition elected in 1894 and 1896 on a fusion ticket. He spoke widely in North Carolina {{in the fall of}} 1898, often to crowds wearing red shirts, disheartening his Populist supporters. Terror and intimidation again won the day for the Democrats, who were elected statewide. They failed to win in the coastal city of Wilmington, <b>but</b> <b>white</b> supremacists took over by force. South Carolina saw violence as well: an effort to register black voters in Phoenix led whites to provoke a confrontation, after which a number of African Americans were murdered. Tillman warned African Americans and those who might combine with them that black political activism would provoke a murderous response from whites.|$|E

25|$|The Cathedral of Saint Michael {{was built}} in Sitka in 1848 and became {{the seat of the}} Russian Orthodox bishop of Kamchatka, the Kurile and Aleutian Islands, and Alaska. The {{original}} church burned to the ground in 1966, but was restored to its original appearance, with the deliberate exception of its clockface, which is black in photographs taken before 1966, <b>but</b> <b>white</b> in subsequent photos.|$|E
25|$|Peacherine {{is claimed}} to be a cross between a peach and a nectarine, and are marketed in Australia and New Zealand.

25|$|After {{winning the}} 1866 elections, the Radical Republicans {{took control of}} the Reconstruction process. The Army {{registered}} all male voters, and elections returned a Republican government composed of a coalition of freedmen, carpetbaggers, and scalawags. By a constitutional convention, new voters created the constitution of 1868; this brought democratic reforms to the state, including its first public school system. Native white Republicans supported it, <b>but</b> <b>white</b> Democrats viewed the Republican government as representative of black interests only and were largely unsupportive.|$|E
