A presentation of the theory of <b>blunt</b> <b>probe</b> operation is included with emphasis on the equations necessary to perform the analysis. This is followed by a discussion of computer program development.

Data {{were obtained}} {{primarily by the}} parachute-borne <b>blunt</b> <b>probe</b> technique conducted in coordinated rocket experiments at White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico and Wallops Island, Virginia. Electrical conductivity measurements and deduced charge density values from ten rocket launches are presented and discussed. Positive ion conductivity and electron density {{were found to be}} relatively invariant with height between 45 and 60 km. Variations in positive conductivity of a factor of two and enhancements in negative conductivity by as much as a factor of four were measured by the <b>blunt</b> <b>probe.</b> A simple lumped parameter ion chemistry model is shown to satisfactorily explain the charge density values for the undisturbed lower D-region. Implications of the data in terms of this model are considered. The principal loss mechanism for positive ions in the 45 to 60 km. region is concluded to be dissociative recombination. Electron densities deduced from the conductivity data are explained by detachment involving a minor neutral constituent which is mixed between 65 and 45 km. and then cuts off sharply below 45 km. A correlation study involving <b>blunt</b> <b>probe</b> measurements shows relatively good agreement between variations in positive conductivity and temperature...|$|E

Mechanical stimuli were applied to the tissue, which included stretch, <b>blunt</b> <b>probing</b> of the mucosa and stroking of the mucosa with von Frey hairs (10 - 1000 mg). Chemical stimuli were applied into a ring that was placed over the mechanoreceptive field of the fibre; these were distilled water, 154 and 308 mM NaCl, 100 μM capsaicin, 50 mM HCl, and undiluted and 50 % ferret bile. Recordings were made from 52 fibres, 12 of which showed characteristics of having endings in the mucosa. Mucosal afferents were sensitive to a 10 mg von Frey hair and were generally chemosensitive to ≥ 1 chemical stimulus. Ten fibres showed characteristics of having receptive fields in the muscular layer. These fibres responded readily to circumferential stretch, as well as to <b>blunt</b> <b>probing.</b> Twenty-seven fibres showed characteristics of having endings in the serosal layer. They adapted rapidly to circumferential stretch and responded to <b>blunt</b> <b>probing</b> of the serosa. Fifteen of 19 serosal fibres tested also responded to luminal chemicals. Three fibres were unresponsive to all mechanical stimuli but were recruited by chemical stimuli. This is the first characterization of colonic afferent fibres using an in vitro method and the first documentation of afferent fibres with their endings in the mucosa of the colon. These fibres are likely to be important in aspects of colonic sensation and reflex control...|$|R

A hemispherical nose-tip probe was used on ascent and a parachute-borne <b>blunt</b> <b>probe</b> on descent to measure polar conductivities, which were due entirely to positive and negative ions. The velocity of the supersonic probe was Mach 2. 5 at 50 km and 1. 75 at 70 km; the <b>blunt</b> <b>probe</b> was subsonic below 71 km. Between 65 and 75 km the ratio of negative to positive conductivities (and thus of mobilities) determined by the <b>blunt</b> <b>probe</b> was about 1. 2, and it approached 1 below this altitude range. The ratio obtained by the nose-tip probe varied from 1. 5 at 75 km to. 6 at 65 km, thus indicating a rapid variation {{of the effects of}} the shock wave on the sampled ions. The absolute values of positive conductivity measured subsonically and supersonically were essentially identical from 60 to 75 km, indicating that the sampled ions were unchanged by the shock. However, below 60 km the shock apparently 'broke up' the positive ions, as indicated by higher measured conductivities...|$|E
40|$|<b>Blunt</b> <b>probe</b> {{theory for}} subsonic flow in a weakly ionized and collisional gas is reviewed, and an {{electron}} collection theory for the relatively unexplored case, Deybye length approximately 1, which {{occurs in the}} lower ionosphere (D-region), is developed.

For ion collection, Hoult-Sonin theory is recognized as a correct description of the thin, ion density-perturbed layer adjacent the <b>blunt</b> <b>probe</b> surface. The large volume with electron density perturbed by a positively biased probe renders the usual thin boundary layer analysis inapplicable. Theories relating free stream conditions to the electron collection rate for both stationary and moving blunt probes are obtained.

A central {{feature of the}} daytime positive conductivity profiles is a sharp break occurring between 60 and 70 km which indicates the transition from galactic cosmic ray to solar ultraviolet ionization, and, hence provides information about the nitric oxide density. In the 50 - 60 km region the positive ion conductivity is relatively constant with altitude and correlates well with atmospheric temperature down to 35 km. Using temperature and pressure profiles and a reduced mobility, the conductivity profiles may be converted to density profiles.

40|$|The {{definitive}} version may {{be found}} at www. wiley. comThe management of pancreatic pain is a significant clinical problem so understanding of how sensory signals are generated in pancreatic tissue is fundamental. We aimed to characterize mechanosensitive and chemosensitive properties of pancreatic spinal and vagal afferents in vitro. Spinal and vagal afferent preparations from Sprague-Dawley rats were established incorporating the left splanchnic nerve or vagus nerves respectively. The common bile duct was cannulated for distension of the pancreatic duct with fluid. Nerve discharge evoked by <b>blunt</b> <b>probing,</b> duct distension or electrical stimulation was obtained from teased nerve bundles using standard extra-cellular recording. Discharge from 197 spinal afferent bundles was recorded, of which 57 % displayed spontaneous activity. <b>Blunt</b> <b>probing</b> revealed 61 mechanosensitive receptive fields which were associated primarily with arteries/blood vessels (33 / 61) and the parenchyma (22 / 61). All mechanosensitive responses were slowly adapting, with 33 % continuing to discharge after termination of the stimulus and 60 % displaying a response threshold < 10 g. Application of chemical mediators (bradykinin, histamine, 5 -hydroxytryptamine, cholecystokinin octapeptide) evoked a response from 31 / 57 units, with 33 % excitatory and 23 % inhibitory. Spontaneous discharge was recorded from 72 % of 135 vagal bundles. Mechanosensitive receptive fields were not identified in the pancreas but were evident in adjacent organs. No spinal or vagal afferent response to duct distension was obtained. In conclusion, pancreatic mechanosensitive spinal afferents are common, in contrast to pancreatic mechanosensitive vagal afferents indicating that pancreatic sensory innervation is predominantly spinal.

30|$|At a later stage, the {{formation}} of an antral polyp, which is visible through the defect intraorally, is possible. The establishment of oroantral communication can be confirmed by the Valsalva method. The patient is instructed to expel air against closed nostrils, while the clinician checks if air hisses from the fistula into the mouth. A hissing noise from air leakage through the maxillary sinus and nose indicates a positive test. In some cases, the test of blowing through the nose or mouth does not provide a positive answer, particularly when the fistular canal is filled with inflammatory changed nasal mucous membrane. Additionally, a test with a <b>blunt</b> <b>probe</b> will confirm the existence of an oroantral fistular canal.

The shortest latencies were observed after strong and fast-increase, moving or static stimuli. The responses to weak, gradual stimulation, appeared at a constant delay {{after the start of}} the displacement, equal to the minimum latency. An earlier phasic response was observed after fast-increase stimulations in two subjects. The long latency of the responses is probably due to a long central delay, similar to the late flexion reflex following electrical stimulation...|$|E

While accurate visual inspection of the peritoneal surfaces is important, the invasiveness of the disease will not always be initially apparent [7]. What appears to be a small superficial lesion can frequently be the head of a severe nodular or infiltrating area of endometriosis that can remain undetected beneath the surface. Laparoscopy should therefore include careful palpation of any suspect lesion with a <b>blunt</b> <b>probe</b> to check for possible infiltration or nodularity. It is unfortunately rare, but should be routine, for any lesion to be confirmed by excision and histological examination. The diagnosis of endometriosis is all too frequently made, if at all, by visual inspection only.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—According to the {{recommendations}} of the German M AK. list, inhalable dust (or so-called 'total dust') is currently sampled using probes having intake air velocities of 1. 2 S m s"'. Annular slot probes conforming to this requirement were developed for sampling independently of wind direction. Probes with a specific intake direction may also be used for sampling in well-defined air flows, provided the plane of the sampler entry is placed at 45 ° to the flow direction. Systematic studies of the sampling efficiency of such probes did not, however, show a consistent correlation with human inhalation efficiency (determined by experiments with model human heads in wind tunnels); instead, they showed that sampling efficiency is dependent also on the detailed geometric design of the probes. Better results have been obtained with so-called <b>blunt</b> <b>probes,</b> although development in this field is not yet concluded...|$|R

40|$|Two {{identical}} planar <b>blunt</b> <b>probes</b> {{of stainless}} steel material, biased with a bipolar ramp voltage, are {{used to measure the}} stratospheric polar conductivities to altitudes of 34 km. One probe (DP) is mounted closer to the gondola, looking downwards and shielded from sunlight, while the other (SP) is mounted looking sideways, away from the gondola. The daytime observations of positive ions in the 29 – 34 km altitude range with SP, and of negative ions at 34 km with DP, show photoelectric contaminations induced by solar UV radiations in the 190 – 230 nm band. These contaminations are found to be due to photoemissions from the SP probe steel surface and from the carbon paint that coats the surface of the gondola, respectively. It is found that, a segment of the photocurrent contaminated I–V curve, recorded with SP at higher negative probe potentials, is linear, and it can give the ambient positive polar conductivity...|$|R
40|$|A {{test flight}} {{for a series}} of middle {{atmosphere}} electrodynamics rockets was launched from Wallops Island, Virginia, at 7 : 18 EST on July 31, 1980. The mother-daughter configuration contained a three axis symmetric double probe electric field instrument and a <b>blunt</b> <b>probe</b> on the daughter payload, and a Gerdien condenser and a single axis (vertical) asymmetric double probe electric field instrument on the mother payload. The payloads reached an apogee of 111 km, and data were gathered from all instruments on the downleg. A downward vertical electric field with a maximum amplitude of about 4 V/m was observed in a layer between about 57 and 67 km. The integrated potential across this layer was approximately 20 kV. Conductivity measurements indicated that free electrons were absent from the region of large electric fields; however, the decrease in conductivity was insufficient to maintain vertical current continuity through the layer. These results establish the existence of large mesospheric electric fields, supporting previous results from single axis measurements...|$|E

The first of these was one of quiet solar activity, whereas the second was preceded by a major solar proton event on January 24. The third flight occurred on a normal winter day. We tentatively conclude that we have observed two days of 'anomalous' winter absorption of very different character, one possibly related to a solar disturbance, and one probably entirely induced by meteorological effects.

40|$|Objective: To quantitatively {{evaluate}} {{the role of}} fibrinogen (Fb) as a determinant of leukocyte (WBC) margination in postcapillary venules in light {{of its ability to}} induce red blood cell (RBC) aggregation with reductions in shear rate (γ ̇) and increase adhesiveness of WBCs to endothelium (EC). Methods: Red cell aggregation (RCA), WBC margination (flux at the EC), rolling velocity, and adhe-sion to the EC were measured in rat mesenteric postcapillary venules upon reducing γ ̇, prior to and following systemic infusion of Fb. Proximal occlusion of feeding microvessels with a <b>blunted</b> <b>probe</b> facilitated reductions in γ ̇ from 600 to 50 s− 1. An index of aggregation (G) was derived from light-scattering properties of RBCs, where G was proportional to the number of RBCs per aggregate. WBC margination was measured as the percentage of total luminal WBC flux that rolled on the EC, F ∗WBC. Results: For normal levels of Fb (0. 07 g%), reductions in γ ̇ resulted in a 4 -fold rise in F ∗WBC and no change in G as γ ̇ was reduced to 50 s− 1. Infusion of Fb to achieve a plasma concentration to 0. 7 g% caused a modest 20 % increase in G and a 2. 5 -fold increase in F ∗WBC at γ ̇ = 50 s− 1. WBC-EC adhesion appeared to increase significantly, but much less than with infusion of high molecular weight dextran (Dx).

Mechano- and chemosensory characteristics and receptive fields of single vagal fibers innervating the stomach as well as lumbar splanchnic nerves innervating the distal colon were identified using an in vitro perifusion system. Twenty-three (17 %) of one-hundred thirty-six vagal units identified were found to have multiple, punctate receptive fields, up to 35 mm apart, and were distributed throughout the stomach. Evidence was based on similarity of generated spike forms, occlusion, and latency determinations. Most responded with brief bursts of activity to mucosal stroking with von Frey hairs (10 - 200 mg) but not to stretch, and 32 % responded to capsaicin (10 (- 5) M). They were classified as rapidly adapting mucosal receptors. Four (8 %) of fifty-three single units recorded from the lumbar splanchnic nerve had more than one, punctate receptive field in the distal colon, up to 40 mm apart. They responded to <b>blunt</b> <b>probing,</b> particularly from the serosal side, and variously to chemical stimulation with 5 -hydroxytryptamine and capsaicin.

Only the facial artery and lower part of anterior facial vein were left, connecting the submandibular gland to the body. The anterior facial vein was cut near the point joining itself with the common facial vein. Bleeding from the anterior facial vein which attached to the submandibular gland was observed to evaluate the state of venous drainage from the gland (Figure  1 E). The proximal part of facial artery and its accompanying vein were cut at the roots of their branches from the external carotid artery.

The distal ∼ 3 cm of colorectum with either pelvic (PN) or lumbar splanchnic (LSN) nerve attached was removed, opened longitudinally, pinned flat in a recording chamber, and perfused with oxygenated Krebs solution. Colorectal receptive endings were located by electrical stimulation and characterized as mechanosensitive or not by <b>blunt</b> <b>probing,</b> mucosal stroking, and circumferential stretch. MIA endings were tested for response to and acquisition of mechanosensitivity by localized exposure to an inflammatory soup (IS). Colorectal afferents were also tested with twin-pulse and repetitive electrical stimulation paradigms. PN MIAs represented 23 % of 211 afferents studied, 71 % (30 / 42) of which acquired mechanosensitivity after application of IS to their receptive ending. LSN MIAs represented 33 % of 156 afferents studied, only 23 % (11 / 48) of which acquired mechanosensitivity after IS exposure. Mechanosensitive PN endings uniformly exhibited significant twin-pulse slowing whereas LSN endings showed no significant twin-pulse difference.

To determine {{the stability of}} the peri-implant hard and soft tissue, the following parameters were analyzed: implant survival, that is, the implants being in situ; the width and thickness of the peri-implant keratinized gingiva (in millimeters); the probing depth (in millimeters); BOP; peri-implant bone loss (in millimeters); and the presence of peri-implant osteolysis. The probing depth was measured with a <b>blunt</b> periodontal <b>probe</b> at four sites (mesio-buccal, distal-buccal, mesio-oral, and disto-oral). Simultaneously to the measurement of the probing depths, the implant was checked to see if probing provoked bleeding (BOP).|$|R
30|$|As {{the pair}} of s tips (on a <b>blunt</b> {{scanning}} <b>probe</b> tip) is scanned over the surface, each tip would encounter the largest charge density in the x direction at different positions of the scanning head holding the two tips. If the tip separation w were precisely (an integer times) the periodicity of the real-space lattice/structure, the conduction signal would simply be twice as large and the topographic image would be unchanged except for brightness from what a single tip would yield. If, on the other hand, the tips were separated by any other distance, the two tips would register different tunneling charge densities at each position of the scanning head, and {{the pair of}} conduction signals would beat against each other, altering the topographic image registered.|$|R
