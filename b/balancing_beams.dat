50|$|Reward Challenge: The two {{newly formed}} tribes were pitted {{against each other}} in an {{obstacle}} course, involving a high wall, followed by <b>balancing</b> <b>beams</b> to the first pit stop. All 9 members of the tribe have to reach the pit stops before they can continue in the course. The second stage involved a leopard crawl through mud and traversing up and over a steep, smooth incline, jumping into a water pit. The third stage consisted of an underground tunnel that they would enter single filed, and then travel across columns using two planks to reach the end of the course, falling off or letting the plank touch the ground meant that person/plank {{had to go back to}} the beginning of the columns. Using the planks, the entire team at the final stage would have to reach a suspended key, unlock a chest and created a giant drumstick. The first tribe to take that drumstick and bang the gong right at the end of the course wins.|$|E

40|$|Introduction The {{ability of}} felines to right {{themselves}} during a fall {{is a well-known}} phenomenon. Consider suspending a feline at a reasonable distance from any surface that is perpendicular to the gravitational normal and releasing it into a free-fall. Since the feline is inverted, it must perform some rotation to land properly. We have observed that, in general, a passive release (formally defined later) of an inverted feline results in rotation along an axis that {{is parallel to the}} body axis. Figure 1 demonstrates the two possibilities for such axial rotation. Researchers at respected research institutes such as the University of Pisa and the Dow Neurological Sciences Institute have long been interested in feline postural responses. Seminal feline postural research includes releasing felines from varying heights[2], studying felines on shaky tables[3], tripping felines on treadmills, and analyzing feline traversal of <b>balancing</b> <b>beams</b> (both jiggling[4] and rotating[5]).
