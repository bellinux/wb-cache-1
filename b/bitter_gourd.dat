25|$|Bitterness is {{the most}} {{sensitive}} of the tastes, and many perceive it as unpleasant, sharp, or disagreeable, but it is sometimes desirable and intentionally added via various bittering agents. Common bitter foods and beverages include coffee, unsweetened cocoa, South American mate, <b>bitter</b> <b>gourd,</b> olives, citrus peel, many plants in the Brassicaceae family, dandelion greens, wild chicory, and escarole. The ethanol in alcoholic beverages tastes bitter, as do the additional bitter ingredients found in some alcoholic beverages including hops in beer and orange in bitters.

Shortly afterwards we came upon patches of holcus, which had grown wild, from seeds scattered by travellers. This was the first sight of grain that gladdened my eyes since I left Bombay: the grave of the First Murderer never knew a Triptolemus [2], and Zayla is a barren flat of sand.

40|$|ABSTRACT Plants {{from the}} Momordica genus, Curcubitaceae, {{are used for}} several purposes, {{especially}} for their nutritional and medicinal properties. Commonly known as <b>bitter</b> <b>gourds,</b> melon and cucumber, these plants are characterized by a bitter taste owing to the large content of cucurbitacin compounds. However, several reports have shown an undisputed correlation between the therapeutic activities and polyphenolic flavonoid content. Using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry in combination with multivariate data models such as principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis, three Momordica species (M. foetida Schumach., M. charantia L. and M. balsamina L.) were chemo-taxonomically grouped based on their flavonoid content. Using a conventional mass spectrometric-based approach, thirteen flavonoids were tentatively identified and the three species were found to contain different isomers of the quercetin-, kaempferol- and isorhamnetin-O-glycosides. Our results indicate that Momordica species are overall very rich sources of flavonoids but do contain different forms thereof. Furthermore, {{to the best of}} our knowledge, this is a first report on the flavonoid content of M. balsamina L...|$|R

40|$|As a {{first step}} for the {{biological}} control of pest insects using ants we surveyed the ant fauna and its seasonality on seven farm lands, six of which were greenhouses, {{in the southern part}} of Okinawa Island. Cultivated plants were dragon fruits, eggplants, <b>bitter</b> <b>gourds,</b> green peppers and sugarcanes. Ants were collected using pitfall traps every 2 month (with some exception) throughout 2006. Regardless of inside or outside the greenhouses ants were less active and less abundant in the low temperature period from January to March, whereas they were abundant and seemingly active in the high temperature period from May to October. The ant species composition did not differ very much by cultivated plant species. Four species (Tetramorium bicarinatum, Monomorium chinense, Pheidole fervens and P. parva) were most common in those fields, which implies that these four species can have the highest potential as the biological-control agents in the warm season in Okinawa, on one hand. On the other hand, a large portion of those dominant ants consists of exotic tramps species, therefore their risk of biological invasion should be also carefully estimated before using them as control agents. 沖縄におけるアリの生物的害虫防除への利用に向けた第一歩として，沖縄島の 7 ヶ所の圃場（そのうち 6 つはハウス）におけるアリ相と個体数の季節変動を約 1 年間調べた．ピットフォールトラップ法を用いて圃場の中とすぐ外の屋外環境で調査を行った．栽培作物はラン，ドラゴンフルーツ，ナス，ゴーヤ，サトウキビ，ピーマンであった．屋外，ハウスに限らずアリ類は気温が低い 1 月から 3 月は採取個体数・種数ともに少なく，気温が高い 5 月～ 10 月にかけて採取個体数・種数ともに多かった．栽培作物に よるアリ相に大きな違いはみられず，オオシワアリ，クロヒメアリ，ブギオオズアリ，ミナミオオズアリの遍在性が高く個体数も多かっ た．沖縄島の圃場でアリを害虫防除資材として利用する場合，これらの種が高温期に利用できる可能性があると考えられる．その一方で優占種の多くは外来の放浪種であり，利用時にはその侵略性のリスクの検討も必要である...|$|R
50|$|On Day 17, {{with the}} {{exception}} of JK, the celebrity housemates entered the Pinoy Big Brother House. Later on, Big Brother revealed that only two of them dubbed as Lucky Stars will be able to continue their journey to reach the finale; he also told them that they will encounter many challenges determined by picking a ball among the other Bola ng Kapalaran placed inside a Big Tambiola. Yassi was tasked to choose the first ball; their first task was that they were only allowed to bring one luggage from eight luggage they have; they picked Nonong's luggage. After the entry of the housemates, disguised as a hooded face ninja, Jerome Ponce entered the House as a house guest in order to assist Big Brother in the housemates' challenges and to fix the thing between him and Elisse. On Day 18, Elisse picked the second ball which showed an image of a basket; the image would mean that they will get a basket of eggs, sweet potatoes and <b>bitter</b> <b>gourds</b> as their food. They had to ration it until Big Brother gives them another set of food supply. Meanwhile, McCoy was informed by Big Brother that the hooded face ninja was Jerome and that he has to help bring him to their bedroom without the female housemates noticing them; he was allowed to tell the task and ask for help with the other male housemates.|$|R
60|$|When {{that last}} loss was discovered, {{it was the}} Brahmin's turn to speak. He had prayed to his own Gods without answer. It might be, he said, that, unconsciously, the village had {{offended}} some one of the Gods of the Jungle, for, beyond doubt, the Jungle was against them. So they sent for the head-man of the nearest tribe of wandering Gonds--little, wise, and very black hunters, living in the deep Jungle, whose fathers came of the oldest race in India--the aboriginal owners of the land. They made the Gond welcome with what they had, and he stood on one leg, his bow in his hand, {{and two or three}} poisoned arrows stuck through his top-knot, looking half afraid and half contemptuously at the anxious villagers and their ruined fields. They wished to know whether his Gods--the Old Gods--were angry with them and what sacrifices should be offered. The Gond said nothing, but picked up a trail of the Karela, the vine that bears the <b>bitter</b> wild <b>gourd,</b> and laced it to and fro across the temple door {{in the face of the}} staring red Hindu image. Then he pushed with his hand in the open air along the road to Khanhiwara, and went back to his Jungle, and watched the Jungle People drifting through it. He knew that when the Jungle moves only white men can hope to turn it aside.|$|R

5000|$|At that conference, Ten Bears gave {{an eloquent}} address: My heart {{is filled with}} joy when I see you here, as the brooks fill with water when the snow melts in the spring; and I feel glad, as the ponies do when the fresh grass starts in the {{beginning}} of the year. I heard of your coming when I was many sleeps away, and I made but a few camps when I met you. I know that you had come to do good to me and my people. I looked for benefits which would last forever, and so my face shines with joy as I look upon you. My people have never first drawn a bow or fired a gun against the whites. There has been trouble on the line between us and my young men have danced the war dance. But it was not begun by us. It was you to send the first soldier and we who sent out the second. Two years ago I came upon this road, following the buffalo, that my wives and children might have their cheeks plump and their bodies warm. But the soldiers fired on us, and since that time there has been a noise like that of a thunderstorm and we have not known which way to go. So it was upon the Canadian. Nor have we been made to cry alone. The blue dressed soldiers and the Utes came from out of the night when it was dark and still, and for camp fires they lit our lodges. Instead of hunting game they killed my braves, and the warriors of the tribe cut short their hair for the dead. So it was in Texas. They made sorrow come in our camps, and we went out like the buffalo bulls when the cows are attacked. When we found them, we killed them, and their scalps hang in our lodges. The Comanches are not weak and blind, like the pups of a dog when seven sleeps old. They are strong and farsighted, like grown horses. We took their road and we went on it. The white women cried and our women laughed.But there are things which you have said which I do not like. They were not sweet like sugar but <b>bitter</b> like <b>gourds.</b> You said that you wanted to put us upon reservation, to build our houses and make us medicine lodges. I do not want them. I was born on the prairie where the wind blew free and there was nothing to break the light of the sun. I was born where there were no inclosures sic and where everything drew a free breath. I want to die there and not within walls. I know every stream and every wood between the Rio Grande and the Arkansas. I have hunted and lived over the country. I lived like my fathers before me, and like them, I lived happily.When I was at Washington the Great Father told me that all the Comanche land was ours and that no one should hinder us in living upon it. So, why do you ask us to leave the rivers and the sun and the wind and live in houses? Do not ask us to give up the buffalo for the sheep. The young men have heard talk of this, and it has made them sad and angry. Do not speak of it more. I love to carry out the talk I got from the Great Father. When I get goods and presents I and my people feel glad, since it shows that he holds us in his eye.If the Texans had kept out of my country there might have been peace. But that which you now say we must live on is too small. The Texans have taken away the places where the grass grew the thickest and the timber was the best. Had we kept that we might have done the things you ask. But it is too late. The white man has the country which we loved, and we only wish to wander on the prairie until we die. Any good thing you say to me shall not be forgotten. I shall carry it as near to my heart as my children, and it shall be as often on my tongue as the name of the Great Father. I want no blood upon my land to stain the grass. I want it all clear and pure and I wish it so that all who go through among my people may find peace when they come in and leave it when they go out.|$|R
