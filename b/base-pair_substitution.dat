The two cats are assumed to be extremely closely related, their differences being categorized as either intraspecies variations or individual mutations. Also, from the speed of cytochrome b's <b>base-pair</b> <b>substitution</b> and its diversity, it is estimated that the Iriomote cat diverged from the leopard cat around 180,000-200,000 years ago. According to marine geologists, the Ryukyu Islands were connected to mainland Asia via a land bridge from about 20,000 years ago to 240,000 years ago. Scientists believe that the Iriomote cat moved its range to the islands during this period. Because of this, it is assumed that there is little genetic variety within the species.|$|E

By analyzing reversion patterns of defined trpA alleles, we showed that pKM 101 altered the mutational specificity of UV-induced mutations. Certain UV-induced <b>base-pair</b> <b>substitutions</b> were strongly enhanced, while others were decreased in frequency {{in the presence of}} pKM 101. This result suggests an interaction between cellular misrepair and an error-prone repair function(s) provided by pKM 101. We have also examined UV mutational specificity in the absence of pKM 101 and found the following: (1) UV preferentially enhances missense, as well as nonsense, intergenic suppressor mutations; (2) UV causes all possible <b>base-pair</b> <b>substitutions</b> as well as frameshift mutations; (3) G·C base pairs are more susceptible to UV mutagenesis than A·T base pairs at the same nucleotide positions; and (4) UV-induced mutations can occur at nucleotide positions that are not part of pyrimidine-pyrimidine sequences...|$|R

40|$|A {{total of}} 405 unique single <b>base-pair</b> <b>substitutions,</b> {{located within the}} ATG {{translation}} initiation codons (TICs) of 255 different genes, and reported to cause human genetic disease, were retrieved from the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD). Although these lesions comprised only 0. 7 % of coding sequence mutations in HGMD, they nevertheless were 3. 4 -fold overrepresented as compared to other missense mutations. The distance between a TIC and the next downstream in-frame ATG codon was significantly greater for genes harboring TIC mutations than {{for the remainder of}} genes in HGMD (control genes). This suggests that the absence of an alternative ATG codon in the vicinity of a TIC increases the likelihood that a given TIC mutation will come to clinical attention. An additional 42 single <b>base-pair</b> <b>substitutions</b> in 37 different genes were identified in the vicinity of TICs (positions − 6 to + 4, comprising the so-called “Kozak consensus sequence”). These substitutions were not evenly distributed, being significantly more abundant at position + 4. Finally, contrary to our initial expectation, the match between the original TIC and the Kozak consensus sequence was significantly better (rather than worse) for genes harboring TIC mutations than for the HGMD control genes...|$|R

The epoxide rings of both compounds are unstable to heat in aqueous solutions, and they open to form glycerol 1 -mononitrate and presumably glycerol. These transformations were accelerated by microbial activity. Glycerol 1 -mononitrate was slowly denitrated to form glycerol.

These women had the same mutation, according to the findings. An intronic single <b>base-pair</b> <b>substitution</b> destroys an acceptor site, thus activating a cryptic splice site, leading to a 59 base-pair insertion and chain termination. The four families with both breast and ovarian cancer had chain termination mutations in the N-terminal half of the protein.

Where Sulcia muelleri is found occupying the body of Auchenorrhyncha hosts, the other members of Flavobacteria are found residing in freshwater bodies and soils.

Survival experiments showed that repair-proficient cells were slightly more sensitive for the cis isomer {{than for the}} trans isomer, whereas repair-deficient RecA and UvrB cells were extremely sensitive only for the cis compound. cis-Pt(NH 3) 2 Cl 2 induced mutagenesis in both wild-type cells and RecA cells but not in UvrB cells; whereas no detectable mutagenesis was induced by treatment with the trans compound. Examination {{of the nature of}} the mutations induced by cis-Pt(NH 3) 2 Cl 2, by using the LacI system, revealed that <b>base-pair</b> <b>substitutions</b> leading to nonsense mutants are only induced in wild-type cells, suggesting that the intact products of both the uvrB and the recA gene are necessary for the repair responsible for this type of mutagenesis. Investigation of the nonsense mutants reveals that 70 % of these mutations result from GC leads to TA or GC leads to AT substitutions at sites where the guanine is part of a GAG or GCG sequence.

40|$|The {{lysosomal}} enzyme termed acid alpha glucosidase (GAA), or acid maltase, is genetically polymorphic, {{with three}} alleles segregating {{in the normal}} population. The rarer GAA 2 allozyme has a lower affinity for glycogen and starch but not for lower-molecular-weight substrates. The GAA 2 allozyme can be detected by "affinity" electrophoresis in starch gel, since the lower affinity for the starch matrix results in a more rapid migration to the anode. Previously, we have isolated and sequenced the cDNA for GAA and transiently expressed the cDNA in deficient fibroblasts. In {{order to determine the}} molecular basis for the GAA 2 allozyme, we constructed a cDNA and a genomic DNA library from a GAA 2 cell line and determined the nucleotide sequence of the coding region. Only a single <b>base-pair</b> <b>substitution</b> of an A for a G at base-pair 271 was found, resulting in substitution of asparagine for aspartic acid at codon 91. This amino acid substitution is consistent with the more basic pI of the GAA 2 enzyme.

The integrated DNA product exhibits all of the features associated with integration of viral DNA in vivo (P. Hindmarsh et al., J. Virol., 73 : 2994 – 3003, 1999). Individual integrants are isolated from bacteria containing drug-resistant markers with amber mutations. This system was used to evaluate the importance of sequences in the terminal U 5 and U 3 long terminal repeats at positions 5 and/or 6, adjacent to the conserved CA dinucleotide. <b>Base-pair</b> <b>substitutions</b> introduced at these positions in U 5 result in significant reductions in recovered integrants from bacteria, due to increases in one-ended insertion events.
