5|$|Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars {{is one of}} {{only seven}} SNES games {{released}} outside Japan to use the Nintendo SA-1 chip. Compared with standard SNES games, the additional microprocessor allows higher clock speeds; faster access to the random-access memory (RAM); greater memory mapping capabilities, data storage, and compression; new direct memory access (DMA) modes, such as <b>bitmap</b> to bit plane transfer; and built-in CIC lockout for piracy protection and regional marketing control.|$|E
5|$|Read-Only Memory is a British {{publisher}} of art books on topics of video game history and culture. Following {{a resurgence of}} interest in 1980s and '90s British video game development, the company crowdfunded and produced four art books: an oral history of that Britsoft era, two books on British developers Sensible Software and The <b>Bitmap</b> Brothers, and a definitive volume on the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, for which the publisher became best known. Read-Only Memory's books are archival anthologies, including original design documents juxtaposed with developer interviews and high-quality prints of in-game graphics. Reviewers were particularly impressed with each book's breadth of unreleased concepts.|$|E
5|$|Video {{output is}} through an RF {{modulator}} and {{was designed for}} use with contemporary television sets, for a simple colour graphic display. Text can be displayed using 32columns × 24rows of characters from the ZX Spectrum character set or from a set provided within an application, from a palette of 15 shades: seven colours at two levels of brightness each, plus black. The image resolution is 256×192 with the same colour limitations. To conserve memory, colour is stored separate from the pixel <b>bitmap</b> in a low resolution, 32×24 grid overlay, corresponding to the character cells. In practice, this means that all pixels of an 8x8 character block share one foreground colour and one background colour.|$|E

50|$|Microsoft {{has defined}} a {{particular}} representation of color <b>bitmaps</b> of different color depths, {{as an aid}} to exchanging <b>bitmaps</b> between devices and applications with a variety of internal representations. They called these device-independent <b>bitmaps</b> or DIBs, and the file format for them is called DIB file format or BMP image file format.|$|R
40|$|<b>Bitmaps</b> are data {{structures}} occurring {{often in}} information retrieval. They are useful; {{they are also}} large and expensive to store. For this reason, considerable effort {{has been devoted to}} finding techniques for compressing them. These techniques are most effective for sparse <b>bitmaps.</b> We propose a preprocessing stage, in which <b>bitmaps</b> are first clustered and the clusters used to transform their member <b>bitmaps</b> into sparser ones, that can be more effectively compressed. The clustering method efficiently generates a graph structure on the <b>bitmaps.</b> In some situations, it is desired to impose restrictions on the graph; finding the optimal graph satisfying these restrictions is shown to be NPcomplete. The results of applying our algorithm to the Bible is presented: for some sets of <b>bitmaps,</b> our method almost doubled the compression savings. 1.

5|$|Early enemy designs {{included}} tanks, combat planes, and battleships. Nishikado, however, was {{not satisfied}} with the enemy movements; technical limitations made it difficult to simulate flying. Humans would have been easier to simulate, but Nishikado considered shooting them immoral. After seeing a magazine feature about Star Wars, he thought of using a space theme. Nishikado drew inspiration for the aliens from H. G. Wells' The War of the Worlds—he had watched the 1953 film adaptation as a child—and created initial <b>bitmap</b> images after the octopus-like aliens. Other alien designs were modeled after squids and crabs. The game was originally titled Space Monsters, inspired by a popular song in Japan at the time ("Monster"), but was changed to Space Invaders by Nishikado's superiors.|$|E
5|$|The {{second book}} was {{published}} {{on the subject of}} The <b>Bitmap</b> Brothers, a prominent British developer known for games such as Speedball, Xenon, and The Chaos Engine. Written by games journalist Duncan Harris, the 360-page book covers the developer's catalogue alongside concept art and interviews with its personnel. It features information about the developer's unfinished games and possible sequels. An interview with Sega's Tetsuya Mizuguchi spoke to the developer's influence, and musicians Tim Simenon and John Foxx discussed the role of music in the developer's games. Patrons who crowdfunded the project on Kickstarter received rewards including signed copies of the book and art prints. Nintendo Life reviewer praised the book's anecdotes and recommended the title for readers interested in the history of British games.|$|E
5|$|To {{experience}} {{firsthand the}} processes mod-makers {{would have to}} go through with the new engine, Valve ported Half-Life (dubbed Half-Life: Source) and Counter-Strike to their new Source engine. Half-Life: Source is a straight port, lacking any new content or the Blue Shift High Definition pack. However, it does take advantage of vertex and pixel shaders for more realistic water effects, as well as Half-Life 2's realistic physics engine. They also added several other features from Half-Life 2, including improved dynamic lightmaps, vertex maps, ragdolls, and a shadowmap system with cleaner, higher resolution, specular texture and normal maps, as well as utilization of the render-to-texture soft shadows found in Half-Life 2s Source engine, along with 3D skybox replacements in place of the old 16-bit color prerendered <b>bitmap</b> skies. The Half-Life port possesses many of the Source engine's graphical strengths as well as control weaknesses that have been noted in the Source engine. Later updates added a field of view options, support for OS X and Linux, an optional high-definition texture pack, among other improvements. Half-Life: Source is available with special editions of Half-Life 2, or separately on Steam.|$|E
50|$|Free-Space <b>Bitmaps</b> are {{one method}} used to track {{allocated}} sectors by some file systems. While the most simplistic design is highly inefficient, advanced or hybrid implementations of free space <b>bitmaps</b> {{are used by}} some modern file systems.|$|R
50|$|Some older {{versions}} of dvips with embedded <b>bitmapped</b> fonts, which represented letters and symbols as pictures {{at a fixed}} resolution (for instance, at 300 dpi). When such files are printed on newer devices (some with resolution of 1200 dpi), {{the letters of the}} files that have <b>bitmapped</b> fonts display a remarkably low quality, with jagged lines on curves and diagonals. One solution to this problem is to substitute the <b>bitmapped</b> fonts with scalable fonts (known among PostScript users as Type 1 fonts).|$|R

25|$|Digital type {{became the}} {{dominant}} form of {{type in the}} late 1980s and early 1990s. Digital fonts store the image of each character either as a <b>bitmap</b> in a <b>bitmap</b> font, or by mathematical description of lines and curves in an outline font, also called a vector font. <b>Bitmap</b> fonts were more commonly used in the earlier stages of digital type, and are rarely used today.|$|E

40|$|Very sparse <b>bitmaps</b> {{are used}} {{in a wide variety}} of applications, ranging from {{adjacency}} matrices in representation of large sparse graphs, representation of sparse space occupancy to book-keeping in databases. In this paper, we propose a method based on pruning of binary space partition (BSP) tree in minimal description length (MDL) principle for coding very sparse <b>bitmaps.</b> This new method for coding of sparse <b>bitmaps</b> meets seemingly competing objectives of good compression, the ability of conducting queries directly in compression domain, and simple and fast decoding. ...|$|R
