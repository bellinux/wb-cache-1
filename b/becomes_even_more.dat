5|$|Agaricus hondensis {{mushrooms}} are toxic, and consuming the fruit bodies causes gastroenteritis. Some fruit bodies smell of creosote, an odor that <b>becomes</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> prevalent if the {{mushrooms are}} cooked. Cooking also introduces an unpleasant soapy-metallic flavor. The fruit bodies {{are used as}} food by the vagrant shrew (Sorex vagrans) and the American shrew mole (Neurotrichus gibbsii). Relatively high levels of the chemical hydroquinone are present in fruit bodies.|$|E
5|$|At the lek, {{males have}} been {{observed}} to break up into pairs, performing “confrontation displays”. This consists of facing each other while bowing, jumping, and flapping their wings, sometimes even snapping their bills, {{and at the same}} time giving off various squawking and grunting calls. When the female approaches, it <b>becomes</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> intense. The display turns into a cacophony of bright color and a frenzied activity filling the air with very strange sounds.|$|E

When Liz cannot find a date to her ex-boyfriend's (Sudeikis) wedding, she revisits her old boyfriends (Hamm and Winters) in hope that a spark will reignite. Meanwhile, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) continues his journey to earn his EGOT.|$|E

The role of the future marshals becomes more clear in the campaigns of 1797, and especially in the Italian campaign; her handling of the material kept it fully focused on the future marshals Massena, Augereau, Berthier, and Brune.|$|E

She <b>becomes</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> frustrated when she sees Pete has brought Adam back; he missed his last bus home. Rachel Bradley's (Helen Baxendale) boyfriend Simon Atkinson (Stephen Mapes) breaks up with her over dinner after taking a job in Hong Kong.

Meanwhile, Veronica investigates and eventually finds out some startling information related to the radical feminist Lilith House—that they faked several of the rapes supposedly perpetrated by the Hearst serial rapist. In addition, Logan and Veronica's relationship <b>becomes</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> tumultuous, with Logan eventually coming to the realization that they need to break up.|$|E
5|$|Negative {{pressure}} {{is believed to}} be a property of vacuum energy, but the exact nature and existence of dark energy remains one of the great mysteries of the Big Bang. Results from the WMAP team in 2008 are in accordance with a universe that consists of 73% dark energy, 23% dark matter, 4.6% regular matter and less than 1% neutrinos. According to theory, the energy density in matter decreases with the expansion of the universe, but the dark energy density remains constant (or nearly so) as the universe expands. Therefore, matter made up a larger fraction of the total energy of the universe in the past than it does today, but its fractional contribution will fall in the far future as dark energy <b>becomes</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> dominant.|$|E
5|$|The film begins {{during the}} thirtieth {{year of the}} show. During the day, Truman notices strange occurrences that all seem {{centered}} on him (a falling spotlight, rain that only falls on him). Truman spots a disheveled man and recognizes him as his father, who had snuck back into the set, but actors quickly drag the man away. Despite efforts by Meryl and Truman's best friend Marlon to reassure Truman, Truman <b>becomes</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> suspicious about his life. One day, he takes Meryl by surprise by going on an impromptu road trip, but their way is blocked by apparent and increasingly implausible emergencies. Meryl begins to break down from the stress, and during an argument with Truman, breaks character and is later taken off the show. Truman, depressed and confused, is consoled by Marlon, and Christof uses the opportunity to re-introduce Truman's father to the show properly, {{under the guise of}} having lost his memory after the boating accident, in the hope of bringing Truman back to some emotional stability and a controllable state.|$|E

5|$|Beth asks Mick to {{help her}} friend Morgan find her stolen cameras. When he meets her, Mick is {{completely}} shocked; Morgan is identical to his ex-wife, Coraline. He <b>becomes</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> confused when his vampiric sense of smell tells him that Morgan is human. Mick tries to expose Morgan as Coraline, but finally comes {{to believe that she}} is a doppelgänger when he sees that she does not have the fleur de lis tattoo on her shoulder as Coraline did. When alone, Morgan scrubs away the heavy makeup that has been covering the tattoo. Beth snoops through Mick's property, and finds out Mick was the one who protected her as a little girl when she was kidnapped. Morgan goes with Mick to his apartment to clean up after almost getting hit by a car. Mick joins her in the shower and finally sees the tattoo on her shoulder, revealing her identity as Coraline. When Beth learns that Morgan is really Coraline, the lady who kidnapped her as a child, she goes to Mick's apartment and stabs her with a wooden stake, narrowly missing her heart, not realizing that she has become human. Coraline goes to hospital, but recovers and leaves after being revealed to be a vampire again. Beth's boyfriend Josh is kidnapped by a dangerous Los Angeles–based gang. Mick and Beth witness the event and drive after him, but Josh is shot. Beth realizes that Josh is dying, and begs Mick to turn him into a vampire; he refuses and Josh dies. While putting Josh's affairs in order, Beth discovers that Josh was about to propose to her.|$|E

25|$|Algebraic {{geometry}} {{occupies a}} central place in modern mathematics and has multiple conceptual connections with such diverse fields as complex analysis, topology and number theory.

She deals with her daughter Danielle's new romance with Matthew AppleWhite. Susan's love life <b>becomes</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> complicated as her ex-husband Karl Mayer (Richard Burgi) is engaged to Edie and has also started to lean towards Susan. Lynette goes back to her career in advertising while her husband Tom Scavo (Doug Savant) becomes a stay-at-home father, and Gabrielle decides to be faithful to Carlos, and begins preparations to have a child. Paul is framed and sent to jail not for the murder he committed in the previous season, but for a fake one.|$|E
