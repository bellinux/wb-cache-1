[...] His crew mate, Nick Clarry, focused on the approach to this year's race: [...] "This year it's heads down {{and get on with}} the job.

Mike Dann, a former CBS executive whom Cooney had hired as a CTW vice-president and her assistant, was assigned to field offers from other countries to produce their own versions of Sesame Street. Dann's appointment led to television critic Marvin Kitman stating, [...] "After he [...] sells [...] in Russia and Czechoslovakia, he might try Mississippi, where it is considered too controversial for educational TV".|$|E
500|$|Following the {{controversial}} refusal by Max Verstappen to follow team orders {{and let his}} teammate pass in the final lap of the race, team principal Franz Tost later backed up his driver: [...] "The team wanted to swap positions <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> Carlos was faster with the new tyres, {{but this was not}} the case, he could not catch up. He was too far away, so Max said no, and he was right." [...] The Ferrari team came under criticism after the race, when team personnel broke through a barrier by security to enter parc fermé and celebrate Vettel's victory. The team announced that they intended to [...] "send a written unconditional apology" [...] to the Grand Prix officials and security staff over the incident.|$|E

500|$|Originally, songwriters George Merrill and Shannon Rubicam {{had written}} the song's demo for Janet Jackson, {{employed}} by A Records executive, John McClain. However, after hearing the song, Jackson's management passed on the song, feeling it was too weak in comparison to her other material. In an interview with Fred Bronson, Merrill expressed his feelings after learning of Jackson's decision. [...] "We were pretty upset <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> it was perfect for her at the time. We had written it with her completely in mind." [...] During this period, Brenda Andrews, at Almo-Irving Music, Merrill and Rubicam's publisher, played the song for Gerry Griffith, the director for R music at A and Arista Records. Griffith, who was compiling material for Houston's debut at the time, felt the song perfectly matched her sound. He soon contacted Andrews and the song's two writers and implored that they should relinquish the song to him for Houston's debut album. Griffith described his discovery of the song, and what he and Clive Davis thought of it: ...|$|E
500|$|Soon after Sesame Street {{debuted in}} the USA, the CTW was asked {{independently}} by producers from several countries to produce {{versions of the}} series in their countries. Cooney remarked, [...] "To be frank, I was really surprised, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> we were creating the quintessential American show. We thought the Muppets were quintessentially American, {{and it turns out}} they're the most international characters ever created". She hired former CBS executive Mike Dann, who quit commercial television to become her assistant, as a CTW vice-president. One of Dann's tasks was to manage offers to produce versions of Sesame Street in other countries. In response to Dann's appointment, television critic Marvin Kitman said, [...] "After [...] sells [...] in Russia and Czechoslovakia, he might try Mississippi, where it is considered too controversial for educational TV". This was a reference to the May 1970 Mississippi state commission decision to ban the series. [...] By summer 1970, Dann had made the first international agreements for what the CTW came to term [...] "co-productions".|$|E
500|$|A {{few months}} after the 1969 debut of Sesame Street on PBS in the US, {{producers}} from several countries all around the world approached the Children's Television Workshop (CTW, later the Sesame Workshop, or [...] "the Workshop"), the organization responsible for the show's production, to create and produce versions of Sesame Street in their countries. [...] Co-creator Joan Ganz Cooney was approached by German public television officials about a year after the US version debuted. Many years later, Cooney recalled, [...] "To be frank, I was really surprised, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> we were creating the quintessential American show.

500|$|As {{some critics}} have noted, Psycho-Pass explores {{societal}} and psychological themes, such {{as the price of}} living without stress, and without fear of crime. Indeed, the Sibyl System targets individuals who are considering performing actions that might cause stress to others. But this {{raises the question of whether}} it is morally and socially acceptable to charge individuals with crimes they have not yet committed. For example, in the first episode, a woman is kidnapped, and the resultant trauma causes her Psycho-Pass to become clouded. According to Sibyl's instructions, the police are therefore prepared to kill her. But Akane steps in, refusing to accept Sibyl's verdict, and manages to bring the woman's Psycho-Pass level back to the acceptable range by speaking gently to her. Consequently, this challenges the notion that the potential to commit a crime necessarily correlates with actually committing the crime. According to Anime News Network, [...] "We are all capable of doing bad things at timesshould we be punished <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> of hurting someone before we act on it? Or because we were victims? It really all comes back to that first episode and Akane's reaction to the victim who presented as a violent criminal".|$|E
500|$|Bardon has {{revealed}} that both he and Brown were sceptical about their characters marrying. In an interview with American fan-based newspaper, Walford Gazette, he commented, [...] "No way did the pair {{of us want to}} get married <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> if we got married, we'd sit indoors and watch the telly every night. As it happened, we've had some nice things to do. And we are married, and it's worked out all right." [...] Brown has reiterated that she feared Dot would become boring if she married Jim, but that producers persuaded her that the marriage might be a good thing. On-screen, Dot had suffered the death of her grandson Ashley, and Brown felt that a traumatic event like that would have changed her character. In her opinion, the only way Dot would have got over Ashley's death [...] "would be to have someone else to care for and when it happened there was nobody [...] with marrying Jim she gets a family– that's what persuaded me. That house will become a house again– it will have a central point, {{they will be able to}} use the house as a central point, as Dot will be there." ...|$|E
500|$|Zak Penn, {{who wrote}} {{a draft of the}} first film in 1996, said the film would follow up Hulk, but {{stressed}} it would be more tonally similar to the TV show and Bruce Jones' run on the comic. He compared his script to Aliens, which was a very different film from Alien, but still in the same continuity. He included two scenes from his 1996 script: Banner jumping from a helicopter to trigger a transformation, and realizing he is unable to have sex with Betty. After the studio rejected a treatment by another screenwriter in 2006, Penn wrote three drafts before departing in early 2007 to promote his film The Grand. Norton, that April, began discussions to play Banner, and arranged a deal that included him as both an actor and a writer, with a screenplay draft he was contractually obligated to turn in within a month. He did so, and continued to polish his draft as late as halfway through principal photography. In November 2006, a June 13, 2008 release date was set. Leterrier acknowledged the only remaining similarity between the two films was Bruce hiding in South America, and that the film was a unique reboot, as generally audiences would have expected another forty-minute origin story. There were previous discussions to set the first act in Thailand. Leterrier felt audiences were left restless waiting for the character to arrive in Ang Lee's film. Feige commented, [...] "we didn't want to tell the origin story again, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> people were so familiar with it, which is why we didn't tell that... One reason we made Incredible Hulk was to get Hulk into the [...] canon." ...|$|E

In 1976, he was drafted into the Miilitary Rabbinate {{and served as a}} {{battalion}} rabbi, a brigade rabbi, a division rabbi, and the rabbi of GOC Army Headquarters. In 2000, Weiss was nominated to the position after Rabbi Gad Navon stepped down. Weiss was present at the 2008 Israel-Hezbollah prisoner exchange and remarked of the bodies that Hezbollah released: [...] "the verification process yesterday was very slow, <b>because,</b> if <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> the enemy was cruel to the living and the dead, we were surprised, when we opened the caskets, to discover just how cruel.

Even our Free kirks were limited to two, St. George's and the Free High. After all, we must have been liberally minded beyond most of our fellows, for, as a rule, those who frequented one of these churches shook their heads at the other. It is said that Dr. Whyte and Dr. Smith have a great appreciation of each other. They, too, are liberally minded.|$|R
500|$|With {{the open}} game world, Rocksteady {{included}} more villains to create challenges for Batman. Hugo Strange {{was selected as}} a primary antagonist, as his power and controlling manner help maintain the lockdown on Arkham City once Batman enters. Strange is aware of Batman's true identity, making Batman [...] "vulnerable and exposed {{in a way that}} he has never been before", according to Hill. He noted that Strange is a character new to many players but that his backstory and character are detailed throughout the game. Catwoman was also included based on her long history with Batman, though she was given her own agenda running parallel to the events within Arkham City. Catwoman's missions initially ended with her coming to Batman's aide, but late in development, the developers decided to give the player an alternate choice, allowing them to have the morally grey Catwoman leave the city with her loot; the addition was implemented in two days. Batman's sidekick Robin also appears, featuring a shaved head and contemporary costume design that were intended to move away from his traditional [...] "Boy Wonder" [...] image. Senior concept artist Kan Muftic explained: [...] "Our vision of Robin is the one of a troubled young individual that is calm and introverted at times, but very dangerous and aggressive if provoked. The shaved head is inspired by cage fighters, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> that Robin might be doing that in his spare time to keep him on his toes. Still, we kept all the classic trademarks of Robin's appearance, such as the red and yellow colors of his outfit, the cape and the mask." [...] Rocksteady originally did not plan to include Robin in the main story but later decided to as an authentic means of delivering new gadgets to Batman, as well as to introduce their version of the character and his relationship with Batman.|$|E

The majority of us just voted for it <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> we could try to fix the problem. Nobody envisioned boycotts. Nobody anticipated the emotion, the prayer vigils. The attitude was: These are the laws, let's start following them." [...] State Representative Kyrsten Sinema, the assistant House minority leader who {{tried to stop the}} bill and voted against it, similarly reflected: [...] "I knew it would be bad, but no one thought it would be this big.

5000|$|Chris Cester {{addressed}} the media speculation in a Jared story interview for Uptown Magazine Online, stating: [...] "It's funny because I asked him point blank about that.

It's funny that he said that to me <b>because</b> <b>we</b> also <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> were ripping off Motown more than 'Lust for Life'. To be honest with you that kind of annoyed me a lot, because I always thought it was really lazy. People just go well 'Lust for Life' is more well-known so that's what they go for, but if you listen to a song like 'You Can't Hurry Love' (The Supremes) I think you'll find it's closer to 'Are You Gonna Be My Girl' than 'Lust for Life' ever was. And that's what Iggy said as well." ...|$|R
2500|$|Secretary of State Dean Rusk {{commented on}} the most {{significant}} area of disagreement regarding the resolution:There was much bickering over whether that resolution should say from [...] "the" [...] territories or from [...] "all" [...] territories. In the French version, which is equally authentic, it says withdrawal de territory, with de meaning [...] "the." [...] We wanted that to be left a little vague and subject to future negotiation <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> the Israeli border along the West Bank could be [...] "rationalized"; certain anomalies could easily be straightened out with some exchanges of territory, making a more sensible border for all parties. We also wanted to leave open demilitarization measures in the Sinai and the Golan Heights and take {{a fresh look at}} the old city of Jerusalem. But we never contemplated any significant grant of territory to Israel {{as a result of the}} June 1967 war. On that point we and the Israelis to this day remain sharply divided. This situation could lead to real trouble in the future. Although every President since Harry Truman has committed the United States to the security and independence of Israel, I'm not aware of any commitment the United States has made to assist Israel in retaining territories seized in the Six-Day War.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the series}} {{does not have}} many lead characters, there are many {{recurring}} characters. Jeffrey Dean Morgan portrays John Winchester, father of Sam and Dean. Making an appearance in the pilot episode, John does not return until nearly halfway through the first season, after which he becomes a recurring character until his eventual death in the second season's premiere episode, though his spirit returns to help his sons in the season finale. Later in the series, it is announced that John Winchester fathered a third son with another woman; a half-brother to Sam and Dean. According to writer John Shiban, it was decided early on that John would die. The writers found that having the brothers being separated from their father [...] "split the show". Shiban noted that [...] "...the boys were looking for Dad, and {{they were looking for}} a monster of the week, whatever that is, whatever case crosses their path. It became difficult, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> it was like – 'what is Dad doing? Is he doing more interesting things than the boys are doing, or what?'" [...] They believed Morgan was initially reluctant about returning to Supernatural for the second season because of his recurring role on the series Grey's Anatomy. Future appearances of the character have been hindered by Morgan's busy schedule.|$|E

Singer/drummer Luke Tuchscherer was quoted by Songwriting Magazine as saying: [...] "When Taff left, the initial {{discussion}} was around getting another bassist. But we didn’t even get to the point of auditioning anyone, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> just <b>thought</b> they’d have to be a brilliant bass player and a brilliant singer, plus Taff was a great songwriter. That’s already pretty big shoes for anyone to fill. On top of that, the rest of us have been playing together for years and are best friends, so no-one would’ve wanted to come into the band. So there appeared to be no other option other than to quit, but then Ben said, ‘Why don’t I play bass?’ That saved the band really." ...|$|R
