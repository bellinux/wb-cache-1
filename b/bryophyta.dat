500|$|Buxbaumia (Bug moss, Bug-on-a-stick, Humpbacked elves, or Elf-cap moss) [...] is a genus {{of twelve}} species of moss (<b>Bryophyta).</b> It was first named in 1742 by Albrecht von Haller and later brought into modern botanical {{nomenclature}} in 1801 by Johann Hedwig to commemorate Johann Christian Buxbaum, a German physician and botanist {{who discovered the}} moss in 1712 {{at the mouth of}} the Volga River. [...] The moss is microscopic for most of its existence, and plants are noticeable only after they begin to produce their reproductive structures. The asymmetrical spore capsule has a distinctive shape and structure, some features of which appear to be transitional from those in primitive mosses to most modern mosses.|$|E

[...] However, since this grouping makes the <b>Bryophyta</b> paraphyletic, the liverworts are now usually given their own division.

50|$|The main Divisions of land plants, in {{the order}} in which they {{probably}} evolved, are the Marchantiophyta (liverworts), Anthocerotophyta (hornworts), <b>Bryophyta</b> (mosses), Filicophyta (ferns), Sphenophyta (horsetails), Cycadophyta (cycads), Ginkgophyta (ginkgo)s, Pinophyta (conifers), Gnetophyta (gnetophytes), and the Magnoliophyta (Angiosperms, flowering plants). The flowering plants now dominate terrestrial ecosystems, comprising 80% of vascular plant species.|$|E
5000|$|Bryophytes, an {{informal}} {{group that is}} now treated as three separate land plant Divisions, namely <b>Bryophyta</b> (mosses), Marchantiophyta (liverworts), and Anthocerotophyta (hornworts). In all bryophytes, the primary plants are the haploid gametophytes, with the only diploid portion being the attached sporophyte, consisting of a stalk and sporangium. Because these plants lack lignified water-conducting tissues, they can't become as tall as most vascular plants.|$|E
50|$|Phenolics {{can also}} be found in non-vascular land plants (bryophytes). Dihydrostilbenoids and bis(bibenzyls) can be found in liverworts (Marchantiophyta), for instance, the macrocycles cavicularin and riccardin C. Though lignin is absent in mosses (<b>Bryophyta)</b> and hornworts (Anthocerotophyta), some {{phenolics}} can be found in those two taxa. For instance, rosmarinic acid and a rosmarinic acid 3'-O-β-D-glucoside {{can be found in the}} hornwort Anthoceros agrestis.|$|E
50|$|Associated plant species, site indicators, include Pachypodium densiflorum, P. eburneum (Apocynaceae), Aloe compressa, A. capitata, (Asphodelaceae), Euphorbia quartzicola (Euphorbiaceae), (Orchidaceae), (Graminaea), (<b>Bryophyta),</b> and Lichenes.It {{occurs in}} a region that {{receives}} an annual rainfall of 1354 mm with a number of 5 dry months. Average monthly temperatures varies from 9 °C to 17 °C. The yearly average temperature is higher; however, at 13 °C to 18.4 °C.|$|E
