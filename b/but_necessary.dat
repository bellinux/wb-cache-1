5|$|Manstein was {{a proponent}} of the {{prospective}} German invasion of Great Britain, named Operation Seelöwe. He considered the operation risky <b>but</b> <b>necessary.</b> Early studies by various staff officers determined that air superiority was a prerequisite to the planned invasion. His corps was to be shipped across the English Channel from Boulogne to Bexhill as one of four units assigned to the first wave. But as the Luftwaffe failed to overcome the Royal Air Force during the Battle of Britain, Operation Seelöwe was postponed indefinitely on 12 October. For {{the rest of the}} year, Manstein, with little to do, spent time in Paris and at home.|$|E

In a famous letter to Leopold von Gerlach, Bismarck wrote that it was foolish to play chess having first put 16 of the 64 squares out of bounds. This observation became ironic, as after 1871, France indeed became Germany's permanent enemy, and eventually allied with Russia against Germany in the 1890s.|$|E

25|$|With the {{disintegration}} of the system, and of the functionality of central and local parliamentary assemblies in particular, confederations had assumed an important role, as a substitute <b>but</b> <b>necessary</b> mode of governance. Confederations, which in reality usually constituted more closely knit magnate factions, were temporary (lasting up to several years) associations, whose members were at times pressured into joining, but were sworn and often deeply committed. Confederate decisions were generally made by a majority of votes. All nobility could join, and there was some urban participation. A confederation was led by a marshal and a council and was typically directed against a monarch or aspired to defend the country from foreign oppression.|$|E
25|$|Marx {{also argues}} that, insofar as {{capitalist}} class society is intrinsically a very contradictory system – it contains many conflicting and competing forces – the masking of its true characteristics becomes an integral feature {{of how it}} actually operates. Buyers and sellers compete with other buyers and sellers. Businesses cannot practically do so without confidentiality and secrecy. Workers compete for job opportunities and access to resources. Capitalists and workers compete for {{their share of the}} new wealth that is produced, and nations compete with other nations. The masks are therefore not optional, <b>but</b> <b>necessary,</b> and the more one is able to know about others, the more subtle, ingenious and sophisticated the masks become.|$|E

25|$|A {{particular}} problem was fund-raising. The Confessing Christians depended completely on offertories, since the official church bodies {{did not share}} their revenues from the contributions levied from the parishioners {{by way of a}} surcharge on the income tax (so-called Church tax), collected and then transferred by the state tax offices. To block any access to funds, in 1934 the Nazi government subjected any form of public money collection to state approval, which was regularly denied if Confessing Christians applied for it. So door-to-door collections became a dangerous, <b>but</b> <b>necessary</b> thing. In the parish of the Capernaum Congregation, never anybody denounced the collectors, while in other, particularly more rural parishes many a Confessing Christian cleric and layman or laywoman was denounced and subsequently taken to court.|$|E
25|$|Algoma Steel {{went through}} years of ups and downs, marked {{by a lack of}} strong leadership, and in 1935 the company was again forced into receivership, and with it went the city: a plaintive cry for help from the mayor to Dunn details the ordeal. This time, at the age of 61, Dunn {{engineered}} a takeover so that he became the sole controlling shareholder thereby allowing him to take the tough <b>but</b> <b>necessary</b> reorganization measures to restore profitability to the steel maker. To accomplish this, he raised capital by negotiating bank loans, selling his beloved art collection and taking stock instead of income. As Algoma Steel's president and Chairman of its board of directors, he successfully turned it into one of the largest steel mills of the day and {{for more than twenty years}} guided the fortunes of the company he would eventually make into one of the most profitable producers in Canada.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{opponents of}} VSU liken fees to council rates or taxes – an {{unpleasant}} <b>but</b> <b>necessary</b> payment for those services which by necessity must be communally provided. VSU proponents respond that student unions are fundamentally not governments {{and should not}} have the right to compel money from people; they also argue that most union services – food, childcare, second-hand bookshops, etc. – already operate in the private sector, sometimes at cheaper prices than the subsidised equivalents. Opponents note that facilities such as playing fields and emergency student loans would have to be taken up by universities since they would almost certainly not be available through the private sector. Opponents of VSU cite that the nature of advocacy and representation fall beyond what could be put to market forces, they further state that the nature of such services prevent them from effectively functioning from within the university, therefore Student Associations must be entrusted to carry out these services.|$|E

500|$|When François Mitterrand {{was elected}} President of France in 1981, {{he laid out}} an ambitious plan {{for a variety of}} {{construction}} projects. One of these was the renovation of the Louvre Museum. Mitterrand appointed a civil servant named [...] to oversee it. After visiting museums in Europe and the United States, including the US National Gallery, he asked Pei to join the team. The architect made three secretive trips to Paris, to determine the feasibility of the project; only one museum employee knew why he was there.

The Thesmophoria, an important festival to Demeter which was restricted to women, was organised and conducted by Athenian citizen women. Athenian women also ventured outdoors socially. David Cohen writes, [...] "One {{of the most important}} activities of women included visiting or helping friends or relatives", and even wealthy women who could afford to spend their entire lives indoors probably interacted socially with other women outside in addition to the religious and ritual occasions when they were seen in public.
