5|$|A {{prophylactic}} method introduced {{after the}} North Sea Flood of 1953 is {{the construction of}} dams and storm-surge barriers (flood barriers). They are open and allow free passage, but close when the land is under threat of a storm surge. Major storm surge <b>barriers</b> <b>are</b> the Oosterscheldekering and Maeslantkering in the Netherlands, which {{are part of the}} Delta Works project; the Thames Barrier protecting London; and the Saint Petersburg Dam in Russia.|$|E
5|$|Many {{parallel}} programs {{require that}} their subtasks act in synchrony. This requires {{the use of}} a barrier. <b>Barriers</b> <b>are</b> typically implemented using a software lock. One class of algorithms, known as lock-free and wait-free algorithms, altogether avoids the use of locks and barriers. However, this approach is generally difficult to implement and requires correctly designed data structures.|$|E
5|$|All {{enemies are}} {{protected}} by health, shields, armor, barriers, or a combination thereof. Each type of protection has its own vulnerabilities. For example, armor is usually vulnerable to powers such as Incinerate, which burns enemies over time, and to weapons with a low rate of fire such as sniper rifles and heavy pistols. In contrast, shields are vulnerable to powers such as Overload and to rapid-firing weapons like submachine guns and assault rifles. <b>Barriers</b> <b>are</b> typically used by boss-type enemies and are vulnerable to certain weapons and powers. When the shields, armor, or barriers of an enemy have all been depleted, the player can use status-effect powers such as Pull, which temporarily levitates targets into the air, incapacitating them. Other powers may temporary benefit the player; for instance, Adrenaline Rush puts the player in bullet time. Powers do not require any sort of expendable resource; they only have a global refresh time period.|$|E

25|$|To further {{restrict}} saltwater intrusion, in 1966, a hinged <b>barrier</b> <b>was</b> installed just upstream of {{the large}} lock. This hollow metal <b>barrier</b> <b>is</b> filled with air {{to remain in the}} upright position, blocking the heavier salt water. When necessary to accommodate deep-draft vessels, the <b>barrier</b> <b>is</b> flooded and sinks {{to the bottom of the}} chamber.|$|R
25|$|These <b>barriers</b> <b>are</b> {{another reason}} why NP-complete {{problems}} are useful: if a polynomial-time algorithm can be demonstrated for an NP-complete problem, this would solve the P = NP problem in a way not excluded by the above results.|$|E
25|$|The {{social model}} of {{disability}} suggests disability {{is caused by}} the way society is organised, rather than by a person’s impairment. This model suggests barriers in society are created by ableism. When <b>barriers</b> <b>are</b> removed, people with disabilities can be independent and equal in society.|$|E
25|$|Vegetative <b>barriers</b> <b>are</b> {{narrower}} {{buffer strips}} of hardy, native, perennial grasses or shrubs planted in parallel rows to crops. They are {{very effective in}} reducing wind and water erosion which results in sediment trapping and water infiltration. They function in similar fashion to a contour buffer strip, just much narrower.|$|E
50|$|The <b>barrier</b> <b>is</b> a spherical energy shield which {{surrounds}} {{and protects}} the player's character from one attack; when hit, the <b>barrier</b> <b>is</b> lost instead of rings or a life. In Sonic 3, additional <b>barriers</b> <b>were</b> introduced {{which gave the}} player special abilities, {{such as the ability}} to magnetically attract rings and double jump, breathe underwater, resist fire.|$|R
50|$|In 1989 {{concrete}} tank <b>barriers</b> <b>were</b> {{constructed on}} the three south entrances. In war times these <b>barriers</b> would have <b>been</b> exploded out of their resting places. The <b>barriers</b> <b>were</b> removed in 2000 during construction of the 4th bore.|$|R
40|$|Altitude {{profiles}} of the Venus magnetic <b>barrier</b> <b>are</b> derived here from a statistical analysis of the Pioneer Venus Orbiter magnetometer data. The outer boundary of the magnetic <b>barrier</b> <b>is</b> then compared with the obstacle expected from gasdynamic models of the bow shock, and the stagnation pressure is compared with that expected from gasdynamic theory. The magnetic <b>barrier</b> <b>is</b> strongest at the subsolar point and weakens as expected with increasing solar zenith angle. The existence of a north-south asymmetry in the <b>barrier</b> strength <b>is</b> also demonstrated. The magnetic <b>barrier</b> <b>is</b> about 200 km thick at the subsolar point and 800 km thick at the terminator. The magnetic barrier transfers most of the solar wind dynamic pressure to the ionosphere via the enhanced magnetic pressure. The convected field gasdynamic model predicts the correct bow shock location if the magnetic <b>barrier</b> <b>is</b> treated as the obstacle...|$|R
25|$|It is {{informal}} trade {{across borders}} {{that is most}} often important to rural livelihoods and a customs union is unlikely to significantly impact the barriers that this faces and taxes are still being fixed separately by countries.

25|$|Roads are a chief {{source of}} {{environmental}} noise generation. In the early 1970s it was recognized that design of roads can {{be conducted to}} influence and minimize noise generation. Noise <b>barriers</b> <b>are</b> used to reduce noise pollution, in particular where roads are located close to built-up areas. Regulations can restrict the use of engine braking.|$|E
25|$|Until 2005, many {{motorways}} and dual carriageways in Ireland did {{not have}} crash barriers in the central reservation, the policy being to use a wider median instead. Crash <b>barriers</b> <b>are</b> now mandatory for such routes, and wire cabling or full crash barriers (depending {{on whether or not}} the route is a motorway, and median width) have been fitted to existing routes.|$|E

25|$|In many areas, regular {{avalanche}} tracks can {{be identified}} and precautions {{can be taken to}} minimise damage, such as the prevention of development in these areas. To mitigate the effect of avalanches the construction of artificial barriers can be very effective in reducing avalanche damage. There are several types: One kind of barrier (snow net) uses a net strung between poles that are anchored by guy wires in addition to their foundations. These <b>barriers</b> <b>are</b> similar to those used for rockslides. Another type of barrier is a rigid fence-like structure (snow fence) and may be constructed of steel, wood or pre-stressed concrete. They usually have gaps between the beams and are built perpendicular to the slope, with reinforcing beams on the downhill side. Rigid <b>barriers</b> <b>are</b> often considered unsightly, especially when many rows must be built. They are also expensive and vulnerable to damage from falling rocks in the warmer months. In addition to industrially manufactured barriers, landscaped barriers, called avalanche dams stop or deflect avalanches with their weight and strength. These <b>barriers</b> <b>are</b> made out of concrete, rocks or earth. They are usually placed right above the structure, road or railway that they are trying to protect, although they {{can also be used to}} channel avalanches into other barriers. Occasionally, earth mounds are placed in the avalanche's path to slow it down. Finally, along transportation corridors, large shelters, called snow sheds, can be built directly in the slide path of an avalanche to protect traffic from avalanches.|$|E
40|$|A thin, light-weight, {{multi-layer}} coating {{is provided}} for protecting metals and their alloys from environmental attack at high temperatures.

For B-type steps, when the diffusing adatom starts from a hexagonal-close-packed (HCP) site and ends at an FCC site, the 3 D ES <b>barrier</b> <b>is</b> 0.14 eV. When the diffusing adatom starts from an FCC site and ends at an HCP site, the 3 D ES <b>barrier</b> <b>is</b> 0.15 eV. When the diffusing adatom starts from an HCP site and ends at an HCP site, the 3 D ES <b>barrier</b> <b>is</b> 0.15 eV.

25|$|In many {{countries}} of the European Union these cable <b>barriers</b> <b>are</b> {{not allowed to be}} used along highways as they perceived to be especially hazardous for motorcyclists. However, a study of motorcyclist injury rates for several types of highway barrier did not find an appreciable difference in fatal and severe injuries between cable barrier and W-beam barrier. Both were significantly more hazardous than concrete barrier, however were less hazardous than having no barrier at all.|$|E
25|$|In Finland, level {{crossings}} (tasoylikäytävä or tasoristeys in Finnish) with warning lights have {{the more common}} red light(s) and a white light that flashes except when the red light(s) flash. Most, but not all, crossings with lights also have barriers. Full-length <b>barriers</b> <b>are</b> usually used only for pedestrian and bicycle lanes. Half-length <b>barriers</b> <b>are</b> used for motor roads, to avoid {{the risk of a}} vehicle being trapped on the tracks between the barriers. Bells begin to ring when the red lights start flashing and usually stop when the barriers have come down. Red-and-yellow crossbuck is used on both controlled and uncontrolled {{level crossings}}. If there are two or more tracks, {{the lower part of the}} cross is doubled. Only minor agricultural crossings might have no signs at all. On bigger roads there are usually also approach signs as seen in the picture. Finnish level crossings are the sixth safest in Europe. Finland's state railway system has almost 3000 level crossings, according to TraFi. In Finland over the course of railway history many level crossing accidents have occurred, in comparison to other Scandinavian countries. In Finland the maximum speed for trains on the rails with level crossings is 140km/h.|$|E
25|$|A QCA clock induces {{four stages}} in the {{tunneling}} barriers of the cells above it. In the first stage, the tunneling barriers start to rise. The second stage is reached when the tunneling <b>barriers</b> <b>are</b> high enough to prevent electrons from tunneling. The third stage occurs when the high barrier starts to lower. And finally, in the fourth stage, the tunneling barriers allow electrons to freely tunnel again. In simple words, when the clock signal is high, electrons are free to tunnel. When the clock signal is low, the cell becomes latched.|$|E

25|$|The {{passenger}} {{doors are}} higher than on normal buses so that passengers can only board from designated shelters. The doors employ automated swing and slide mechanisms which is manually controlled by the driver. Currently, the slide mechanism is being phased out, with all new buses being equipped with swing doors. Protective full-height acrylic glass <b>barriers</b> <b>are</b> installed behind passenger seats close to the sliding door mechanism. Although, feeder routes uses low street-level doors. This is achieved with the driver's door {{at the front of}} the bus on big buses and a pair of designated hydaulic folding door on medium buses.|$|E
25|$|Level {{crossings}} in Thailand, and Malaysia {{are largely}} manually operated, where the <b>barriers</b> <b>are</b> lowered using a manual switch when trains approach. A {{significant number of}} crossings are without barriers. Railway electrification in Malaysia has gradually eliminated level crossings in Peninsular Malaysia, replacing those along nearly all upgraded lines with large overhead viaducts or deep underground tunnels, and simply cutting off non-essential crossings outright. Level crossings used to exist along the KTM railway line in Singapore, but these were removed after the closure of Tanjong Pagar Railway Station, and the moving of the KTM railway station to Woodlands Train Checkpoint. But {{there are still some}} that are used on the line between Port Klang - Westport (Pulau Indah). However, it seems like only the level crossing near Port Klang Komuter Station has the barrier.|$|E
25|$|There are {{operating}} and maintenance depots at Poplar, now {{secondary to the}} larger site at Beckton, built {{on the site of}} the Beckton Gas Works in 1996 and accessed via a spur at Gallions Reach. Rolling stock is kept at both locations, which have maintenance workshops and extensive open-air carriage sidings. The Poplar depot, which is also the operating headquarters of Docklands Light Railway Ltd, KeolisAmey Docklands Ltd and the Emirates Air-Line cable car, houses diesel locomotives used for track maintenance. Poplar depot is alongside the north side of the Stratford line east of the station, and Beckton depot is to the east of the line on a long spur north-east of Gallions Reach. Beckton Depot has the only level crossing on DLR. It is an AHB type and the <b>barriers</b> <b>are</b> down unless a user wants to cross, much like Appleford but AHB styled.|$|E

40|$|Two two-bay {{pultruded}} {{glass fibre}} reinforced polymer (GFRP) post and rail safety <b>barriers</b> have <b>been</b> fabricated. One, a modular <b>barrier,</b> <b>was</b> fabricated from circular cross-section tubes, bolted sheet moulded composite (SMC) two-part multi-way connectors and bases.

50|$|The Foss <b>Barrier</b> <b>is</b> built {{across the}} river near its mouth at Castle Mills.

When the level reaches 7.8m AOD the <b>barrier</b> <b>is</b> then lowered, after running pumps for several minutes to clear silt and debris from the river bed. This provides a watertight fit. It takes four minutes to lower the barrier. To avoid the build-up of water behind the barrier causing the Foss to burst its banks, the water is pumped around the barrier and into the Ouse. This is done by eight pumps that pump water at 30 tonnes per second, this prevents the Foss flowing back on itself. The water pumped out should maintain a water level of 6.5m AOD behind the barrier.
