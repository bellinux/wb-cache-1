2500|$|Web 1.0 is a retronym {{referring}} to {{the first stage of}} the World Wide Web's evolution. According to Cormode, G. and, Krishnamurthy, B. (2008): [...] "content creators were few in Web 1.0 with the vast majority of users simply acting as consumers of content." [...] Personal web pages were common, consisting mainly of static pages hosted on ISP-run web servers, or on free web hosting services such as GeoCities. With the advent of Web 2.0, it was more common for the average web user to have social networking profiles on sites such as Myspace and Facebook, as well as personal blogs on one of the new low-cost web hosting services or a dedicated <b>blog</b> <b>host</b> like Blogger or LiveJournal. The content for both was generated dynamically from stored content, allowing for readers to comment directly on pages {{in a way that was}} not previously common.|$|E
