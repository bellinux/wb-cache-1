25|$|Peacekeepers {{monitor and}} observe peace {{processes}} in post-conflict areas and assist ex-combatants {{in implementing the}} peace agreements they may have signed. Such assistance comes in many forms, including confidence-building measures, power-sharing arrangements, electoral support, strengthening the rule of law, and economic and social development. Accordingly, UN peacekeepers (often referred to as Blue Berets or <b>Blue</b> <b>Helmets</b> because of their light blue berets or helmets) can include soldiers, police officers, and civilian personnel.|$|E

2500|$|The Security Council of the United Nations on 1 February {{unanimously}} {{adopted a}} resolution, presented by France, reinforcing {{the effectiveness of}} the arms embargo. Resolution 1584 authorised the <b>blue</b> <b>helmets</b> of the United Nations Operation in Côte d'Ivoire (UNOCI) and French soldiers of the Operation Unicorn to inspect without notice planes and freight vehicles using the ports, airports, airfields, military bases and border posts.

2500|$|Blue {{was also}} {{seen as a}} colour which was {{authoritative}} without being threatening. Following the Second World War, blue was adopted as the colour of important international organisations, including the United Nations, the Council of Europe, UNESCO, the European Union, and NATO. United Nations peacekeepers wear <b>blue</b> <b>helmets</b> to stress their peacekeeping role. Blue {{is used by the}} NATO Military Symbols for Land Based Systems to denote friendly forces, hence the term [...] "blue on blue" [...] for friendly fire, and Blue Force Tracking for location of friendly units. The People's Liberation Army of China (formerly known as the [...] "Red Army") uses the term [...] "Blue Army" [...] to refer to hostile forces during exercises.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the team}} debuted in 1937, the Rams' colors were red and black, {{featuring}} red helmets, black uniforms with red shoulders and sleeves, tan pants, and red socks {{with black and}} white stripes. One year later they would switch their team colors to gold and royal blue, with gold helmets, white pants, royal blue uniforms with gold numbers and gold shoulders, white pants with a royal stripe, and solid royal blue socks. By the mid-1940s the Rams had adopted gold jerseys (with navy blue serif numerals, navy blue shoulders, gold helmets, white pants with a gold-navy-gold stripe, and gold socks with two navy stripes). The uniforms were unchanged as the team moved to Los Angeles. The helmets were changed to navy in 1947. When Gehrke introduced the horns, they were painted yellow-gold on navy <b>blue</b> <b>helmets.</b> In 1949 the team adopted plastic helmets, and the Rams' horns were rendered by the Riddell company of Des Plaines, Illinois, which baked a painted design into the helmet at its factory. Also in 1949 the serif jersey numerals gave way to more standard block numbers. Wider, bolder horns joined at the helmet center front and curving around the earhole appeared in 1950; this design was somewhat tapered in 1954–1955. Also in 1950 a blue-gold-blue tri-stripe appeared on the pants and [...] "Northwestern University-style" [...] royal blue stripes were added to jersey sleeves. A white border {{was added to the}} blue jersey numerals in 1953. So-called [...] "TV numbers" [...] were added on jersey sleeves in 1956. In accordance with a 1957 NFL rule dictating that the home team wear dark, primary-colored jerseys and the road team light shirts, the Rams hurriedly readied for the regular season new royal-blue home jerseys with golden striping and golden front and back numerals with a white border. The white border was removed in 1958. The Rams continued to wear their golden jerseys for 1957 road games, but the following year adopted a white jersey with blue numerals and stripes. In 1962–63 the team's road white jersey featured a UCLA-style blue-gold-blue crescent shoulder tri-stripe.|$|E
60|$|You may imagine our {{feelings}} when, {{by the light}} of the lantern which hung from the porch, we saw a score of our hussars and dragoons all mixed in one wild heap, red coats and <b>blue,</b> <b>helmets</b> and busbies, pommelling each other to their hearts' content. We flung ourselves upon them, imploring, threatening, tugging at a lace collar, or at a spurred heel, until, at last, we had dragged them all apart. There they stood, flushed and bleeding, glaring at each other, and all panting together like a line of troop horses after a ten-mile chase. It was only with our drawn swords that we could keep them from each other's throats. The poor Capuchin stood in the porch in his long brown habit, wringing his hands and calling upon all the saints for mercy.|$|E
