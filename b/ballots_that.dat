5|$|As the 1876 presidential {{election}} approached, Garfield was {{loyal to the}} candidacy of Senator Blaine, and fought for the former Speaker's nomination at the 1876 Republican National Convention in Cincinnati. When it became clear, after six <b>ballots,</b> <b>that</b> Blaine could not prevail, the convention nominated Ohio Governor Rutherford B. Hayes. Although Garfield had supported Blaine, he had kept good relations with Hayes, and wholeheartedly supported the governor. Garfield had hoped to retire from politics after his term expired to devote himself full-time {{to the practice of}} law, but to help his party, he sought re-election, and won it easily that October. Any celebration was short lived, as Garfield's youngest son, Neddie, fell ill with whooping cough shortly after the congressional election, and soon died.|$|E
5|$|Despite its {{opposition}} to parliamentary democracy, Zbor participated in the 1935 Yugoslav parliamentary elections. It offered 8,100 candidates throughout Yugoslavia. On 5 May the Yugoslav government first announced {{the results of the}} elections, which showed that 72.6 percent of the eligible electorate had cast a total of 2,778,172 ballots. The party of Bogoljub Jevtić had received 1,738,390 (62.6%) votes and 320 seats in parliament and the Opposition Bloc led by Vladko Maček had received 983,248 (35.4%) votes and 48 seats. Zbor finished last in the polls, with 23,814 (0.8%) votes, and had acquired no seats in parliament. Of all the votes it had received, 13,635 came from the Danube Banovina, in which Ljotić's home district of Smederevo was located. The election results initially published by authorities caused an upheaval amongst the public, forcing the government to publish the results of a recount on 22 May. The recount showed that 100,000 additional <b>ballots</b> <b>that</b> had not been recorded on 5 May had been cast and that Jevtić's party had received 1,746,982 (60.6%) votes and 303 seats, the Opposition Bloc had received 1,076,345 (37.4%) and 67 seats, and that Zbor had received 24,008 (0.8%) votes and again no seats.|$|E

50|$|The {{system can}} be {{manipulated}} by either an optimistic voter, one who can cast a <b>ballot</b> <b>that</b> would elect some candidate better than all of those elected by voting honestly; or by a pessimistic voter, one who can cast a <b>ballot</b> <b>that</b> would exclude some candidate worse than all of those elected by voting strategically.|$|R

25|$|Ballots {{assigned}} to eliminated candidates are recounted and {{assigned to}} one of the remaining candidates based on the next preference on each ballot. The process repeats until one candidate achieves a majority of votes cast for continuing candidates. <b>Ballots</b> <b>that</b> 'exhaust' all their preferences (all its ranked candidates are eliminated) are set aside.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} two no-show paradoxes, {{in which}} a voter obtains a preferable outcome by abstaining from a vote. One arises when the casting of a <b>ballot</b> <b>that</b> ranks a candidate in first causes that candidate to lose the election. The other arises when a <b>ballot</b> <b>that</b> ranks a candidate in last causes that candidate to win. We show that when {{there are at least}} four candidates and when voters may express indifference, every voting rule satisfying Condorcet's principle must generate both of these paradoxes. ...|$|R

In {{the first round of}} elections, held on May 31, Noboa got 1,022,026 votes, 26.61% of valid <b>ballots.</b> <b>That</b> placed him second behind Jamil Mahuad (1,341,089 votes, 34.92% of valid ballots) and both battled in a runoff held on July 12. Noboa lost the runoff by 102,519 votes. Mahuad won with 2,243,000 votes.|$|E
25|$|This {{put an end}} to the band's {{plans to}} record a half studio/half live triple album with the working title 3 Dudes, 6 Sides, Half Studio, Half Live.

A year later, however, Watt and Hurley compiled various live recordings, based on the ballots, which was released as Ballot Result.|$|E
25|$|Similar to STV, {{the vote}} {{counting}} procedure occurs in rounds. The {{first round of}} RRV is identical to range voting. All ballots are added with equal weight, and the candidate with the highest overall score is elected. In all subsequent rounds, <b>ballots</b> <b>that</b> support candidates who have already been elected are added with a reduced weight. Thus voters who support none of the winners in the early rounds are increasingly likely to elect one of their preferred candidates in a later round. The procedure {{has been shown to}} yield proportional outcomes if voters are loyal to distinct groups of candidates (e.g. political parties).|$|E

25|$|Acevedo Vilá won the Puerto Rico General Elections of 2004 by {{approximately}} 3,880 votes (0.2 {{percent of the}} vote) over former governor Pedro Rosselló. However, since the margin of victory was so small, a full recount of the elections took place. During the period, Rosselló filed a civil lawsuit against Acevedo Vilá himself over a dispute of certain <b>ballots</b> <b>that</b> were cast during the elections. Acevedo Vilá is also the first elected governor born after {{the adoption of the}} 1952 Constitution of Puerto Rico. Many independentistas voted for Governor Anibal Acevedo Vilá because they did not want the statehood candidate to win the tight race.|$|E
500|$|Stivers led Kilroy by a 129,852–129,703 margin with 100% of the Election Day precincts counted, {{but before}} the {{provisional}} ballots were counted. On November 25, 2008, Madison and Union counties concluded their absentee, military, and provisional ballot counting and Stivers claimed a net gain resulting in a 594-vote lead. On December 5, 2008, Stivers' supporters won a ruling in the Ohio Supreme Court that the 1,000 provisional <b>ballots</b> <b>that</b> lacked signatures or had names and signatures in the wrong places be thrown out. On December 7, 2008, Franklin County Election Canvassers completed their final ballot count, which included absentee, military, and provisional ballots received within ten days of Election Day, giving Kilroy a victory margin of 2,311 votes over Stivers. This margin exceeds the automatic recount margin of 0.5%. Stivers conceded the race to Kilroy later on Sunday. [...] The late <b>ballots</b> <b>that</b> weighed on the election were of three types: military and overseas absentee ballots postmarked {{by the time the}} polls closed Tuesday November 4 and received by November 14; domestic absentee ballots postmarked by Monday November 3 that are received by November 14; absentee ballots with errors that voters correct by November 14.|$|E

[...] The case was consolidated with other cases in the United States District Court upon Brunner's request.

500|$|In the 1806 {{election}} the Republicans {{secured a}} majority in the Massachusetts assembly, and the gubernatorial election was notably close. [...] Running mainly against James Sullivan, Strong barely received a majority of the votes cast. [...] With fewer than 200 votes in the balance, the Republican-controlled legislature scrutinized the returns in a partisan manner, discarding <b>ballots</b> <b>that</b> had misspelled Strong's name while retaining those that misspelled Sullivan's and performing tallies in ways that favored their candidate. [...] This process concluded with a finding that Strong in fact lacked a majority of votes, which was what was then required to carry the election, as opposed to the modern plurality requirement. [...] Strong's Federalist allies in the legislature were able to publicize the partisan nature of the analysis, resulting in a hostile public backlash. [...] He was proclaimed the winner after further, less biased, analysis corrected the count in his favor. [...] However, in the 1807 election the rising tide of Republicanism swept Strong (along with other New England Federalists) out of office. [...] Federalists asked him to run in 1808, but he refused, noting that he had [...] "done his part" [...] and that his home base in Hampshire County was strongly Federalist.|$|E
500|$|Sullivan {{received}} the Republican nomination {{for governor in}} 1797 and 1798, but lost to Federalist Increase Sumner (in 1798 by a landslide after the XYZ Affair lent strength to the Federalist cause). [...] Republicanism eventually began gaining ground in Massachusetts, and Sullivan was again nominated in 1805 and 1806 for governor, losing both times to the popular incumbent Governor Caleb Strong. [...] In 1806 the Republicans gained control of the Massachusetts legislature, which managed to very nearly deny Strong a narrow victory. [...] With fewer than 200 votes in the balance, the Republican-controlled legislature scrutinized the returns in a partisan manner, discarding <b>ballots</b> <b>that</b> had misspelled Strong's name while retaining those that misspelled Sullivan's and performing tallies in ways that favored their candidate.

[...] He was proclaimed the winner after further, less biased, analysis corrected the count in his favor.
