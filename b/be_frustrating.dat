5|$|What's So Amazing About Grace? {{was named}} Book of the Year by the Evangelical Christian Publishers Association in 1998. In 2006, it ranked 17th on Christianity Todays list of fifty books {{that have shaped}} Evangelicals the most. In a Publishers Weekly review, Henry Carrigan notes an anecdotal style that can <b>be</b> <b>frustrating</b> but {{ultimately}} worth reading. For the Presbyterian Record, Canadian Christian writer Phil Callaway writes that he found the book refreshing and inspirational. What's So Amazing About Grace? has been endorsed {{by a number of}} public figures, including Irish musician Bono, British adventurer Debra Searle, and World Vision Australia CEO Tim Costello.|$|E
25|$|In {{cultures}} that value outspokenness and overt confidence, shyness can {{be perceived as}} weakness. To an unsympathetic observer, a shy individual may be mistaken as cold, distant, arrogant or aloof, which can <b>be</b> <b>frustrating</b> for the shy individual. However, in other cultures, shy people {{may be perceived as}} being thoughtful, intelligent, as being good listeners, and as being more likely to think before they speak.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{introduction}} of the DVD, some high budget films include the simultaneous option of both subtitles and/or dubbing. Often in such cases, the translations are made separately, rather than the subtitles being a verbatim transcript of the dubbed scenes of the film. While this allows for the smoothest possible flow of the subtitles, it can <b>be</b> <b>frustrating</b> for someone attempting to learn a foreign language.|$|E

25|$|A major {{revision}} {{was enacted}} in 2002. A rising number of impasses in collective bargaining appeared to <b>be</b> <b>frustrating</b> {{the purpose of}} CALRA. The UFW backed two bills which would impose binding arbitration and mediation on unions and employers if an impasse was declared. The bills passed the state legislature in August 2002, and Governor Davis signed them into law in October. Growers filed suit in state court to have the amendments declared unconstitutional, but a state appeals court upheld the revisions in 2006.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} two seasons for Port Adelaide would <b>be</b> <b>frustrating</b> dropping only one game during the 1911 minor round and going undefeated {{the following year}} in 1912 only to be knocked out of contention by West Adelaide both times, the second of these encounters {{in front of a}} pre war South Australian record crowd of 28,500. During the 1912 preseason, Port Adelaide travelled to Tasmania and took on a combination of players from various Tasmanian Football League (TFL) sides. The game would prove to be very competitive with Port Adelaide defeating the TFL combination 7.13 (55) to 6.6 (42).|$|E
25|$|Burns {{taught at}} Erasmus High School in Brooklyn for two years. While Burns enjoyed the {{educational}} field, she generally found {{the experience to}} <b>be</b> <b>frustrating</b> and wanted to continue her own studies. In 1906, at age twenty-seven, she moved to Germany to resume her studies in language. In Germany, Burns studied at the Universities of Bonn and Berlin from 1906 to 1909. Burns later moved to the United Kingdom, where she enrolled at Oxford University to study English. Burns {{was fortunate enough to}} have a very extensive educational background because her father, Edwards Burns, supported her and financed her international education.|$|E

25|$|People with {{executive}} dysfunction have {{a slower}} cognitive processing speed and thus often {{take longer to}} complete tasks than people who demonstrate typical executive function capabilities. This can <b>be</b> <b>frustrating</b> for the individual and can serve to impede academic progress. Disorders affecting children such as ADHD, along with oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, high functioning autism and Tourette’s syndrome have all been suggested to involve executive functioning deficits. The main focus of current research has been on working memory, planning, set shifting, inhibition, and fluency. This research suggests that differences exist between typically functioning, matched controls and clinical groups, on measures of executive functioning.|$|E
25|$|Subtitle {{translation}} can {{be different}} from the translation of written text. Usually, during the process of creating subtitles for a film or television program, the picture and each sentence of the audio are analyzed by the subtitle translator; also, the subtitle translator {{may or may not have}} access to a written transcript of the dialog. Especially in the field of commercial subtitles, the subtitle translator often interprets what is meant, rather than translating the manner in which the dialog is stated; that is, the meaning is more important than the form—the audience does not always appreciate this, as it can <b>be</b> <b>frustrating</b> for people who are familiar with some of the spoken language; spoken language may contain verbal padding or culturally implied meanings that cannot be conveyed in the written subtitles. Also, the subtitle translator may also condense the dialog to achieve an acceptable reading speed, whereby purpose is more important than form.|$|E
500|$|Criticism of Wild Arms {{comes from}} its myriad puzzles and minigames that {{resemble}} {{those found in}} an action games, described as being [...] "extremely action oriented, which may <b>be</b> <b>frustrating</b> to RPG fans who don't have the quickest of reflexes". The game was also compared to the RPG Final Fantasy VII, released five months later, which in turn led to Wild Arms being designated as a game that would [...] "suppress your appetite for Final Fantasy VII". [...] GameSpot additionally declared that Wild Arms graphics, though impressive, were not the industry standard at the time, remarking: [...] "Although it's no Final Fantasy VII, Wild Arms looks great." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{gameplay}} {{itself was}} viewed in a significantly harsher light. Several critics {{took issue with}} the controls, which were viewed as imprecise, both in the platforming and in the combat phases of the game. Reviewers took issue with {{various parts of the}} combat system. Several reviewers found combat against large groups of enemies to <b>be</b> <b>frustrating.</b> Jason Venter of GameSpot singled out a specific combat stage taking place on an airship as particularly demonstrative of the game's shortcomings in combat, calling the scenario [...] "cheap". Venter did, however, have praise for the game's boss battles, which he described as [...] "a nice change of pace because victory relies more on pattern memorization and intuition than manic combat". Edge Magazine echoed the praise for the boss battles, and both reviews lamented that such segments were not more common.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{response}} to the film was mixed but mostly positive, in Denmark, including praise for Madsen's direction, the performances of Lindhardt, Mikkelsen, Stengade and Mygind; opinions were divided about the portrayal of the main characters. The film [...] "has shocked Danish audiences" [...] for its portrayal of the protagonists as non-heroic, and has been criticised by historians. Berlingskes Ebbe Iversen commented {{that it can be}} both good and bad to have morally ambiguous characters as it can be seen as [...] "an artistic force" [...] to have [...] "authentic protagonists psychology", but it can also <b>be</b> <b>frustrating</b> to have their motives portrayed as [...] "enigmatic". The critic stated it did not make it a bad film, instead [...] "its subtle, not uncritical portrayal of the resistance seems sober and serious, the style is worked out to the smallest detail, and in its outer form the film is the type of work that you unkindly call conventional and more kindly describe as classic." ...|$|E
500|$|Li criticized Capcom for not {{providing}} an easy alternative to unlock characters since the multiple Arcade mode playthroughs needed to unlock them could <b>be</b> <b>frustrating.</b> Nintendo World Report's Neal Ronaghan mentioned {{it can get}} tedious, and echoing Li's sentiment, Ryan Scott of GameSpy complained that [...] "arcade mode needs {{to be left to}} die," [...] as multiplayer is the primary reason for playing fighting games. Both Scott and Ramsay thought many of the other unlockables obtainable through Arcade mode didn't offer sufficient value. Reviewers had mixed experiences with its online component; GameDaily's Robert Workman reported that it ran fluidly, but Scott said that the game lagged often enough to be unplayable. Edwards thought [...] "the netcode hasn't shown itself to be particularly sturdy," [...] but the situation may improve as the number of local players increase. Both Bozon and GameTrailers said that performance depends on each player's connection; the latter explained that lag is more likely to occur when playing against a distant opponent.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Success {{or failure}} of {{democracy}} are interpreted as different equilibria of a dynamic political game. Democracy <b>is</b> <b>frustrated</b> and fails when voters do not replace corrupt leaders, given some transition cost of changing leadership, and any new leader {{would be likely to}} govern corruptly. Even when new politicians have a small probability of being virtuous, democracy can <b>be</b> <b>frustrated</b> in a unitary political system. But in a federal system, democracy cannot <b>be</b> consistently <b>frustrated</b> at both national and provincial levels, because provincial leaders who govern responsibly could build reputations to become contenders for higher national office. Similarly, democracy cannot <b>be</b> consistently <b>frustrated</b> in a democratization process that begins with decentralized provincial democracy and only later introduces nationally elected leadership...|$|R
500|$|The {{game was}} often called a Super Mario 64 clone for its {{similarity}} in gameplay. Gerstmann compared it favourably to Mario, saying that [...] "it doesn't stray {{too far from}} the formula, but it makes the logical progressions you would expect Nintendo to make." [...] Game Informer observed that, while both games are very similar, Banjo-Kazooie has less emphasis on the platforming and more on exploration. Schneider noted that the worlds in Banjo-Kazooie are [...] "bigger, more detailed and are filled with interactive characters at every corner." [...] Colin Williamson of AllGame stated similar pros, crediting the level design as [...] "simply delightful, loaded with creativity, secrets, and memorable characters." [...] Nintendo Power remarked that the game's puzzles were fresh and that the characters [...] "have more of a loud-mouthed attitude than Mario and crew. One habitually-criticized aspect of the game was its flawed camera system. Game Revolution remarked that it can occasionally be in a bad angle to gauge a jump properly, while Edge said that its fixed position in underwater sections can <b>be</b> <b>frustrating</b> while retrieving collectables.|$|E
500|$|The clearer {{sound effects}} of the Dreamcast port were {{received}} well by Game Revolution's Shawn Sparks, who also remarked that the character models look slightly sharper. However, Steve Key of Computer And Video Games disliked the Dreamcast release's low-resolution backgrounds, which he thought made the characters stand out too much from the environments, and thus lessened the game's atmosphere. GameSpot staff writer James Mielke {{did not believe that}} the Dreamcast port was [...] "an essential purchase", but still called it a [...] "great game" [...] and, thanks to its low retail price, an attractive offer. The GameCube release was heavily criticized for its high price and dated graphics. However, [...] "Four-Eyed Dragon" [...] of GamePro noted that it offered the best in-game visuals of any version of the game. Davis and 1UP.com's Mark MacDonald were disappointed by the port's lack of features that were included in the Nintendo 64 release. Peer Schneider of IGN found the 2.5D version for the Game.com to <b>be</b> <b>frustrating</b> and only [...] "partially faithful" [...] to the original release of Resident Evil 2. Although he felt that its graphics and sound effects managed to recreate the original game's atmosphere to a certain extent, he thought that its controls were too [...] "sluggish" [...] to allow for an enjoyable experience.|$|E
500|$|The game's mission design {{received}} mixed reviews. Martin {{criticized the}} limited geographical variety of each level, but Welsh applauded the map variety, adding that each level feels different, as ideas were never identical. He further praised the game's portrayal of nature, describing it as [...] "elegantly expressed". Gonzalez {{added that the}} game's variety was sufficient, and is successful in keeping the game interesting. Some critics criticized the game's difficulty curve, and added that the later levels can <b>be</b> <b>frustrating</b> as they are significantly more challenging and demand high levels of time management. Winterhalter however, criticized {{the first half of}} the game, calling it a [...] "tutorial" [...] that must be endured before reaching the better missions, while describing the latter half as addictive. Justin McElroy from Joystiq added that the natural disasters featured are way too unpredictable, and lamented that the game had failed to provide players enough clues when the player failed and destroyed the entire tribe. Tom Francis of PC Gamer echoed similar statements, that the game seldom notified players of their mistakes, and that levels are excessively trial-and-error and feel too stressful for players to play. Jamin Smith of VideoGamer.com criticized the mission structure and objectives for being unrewarding and lacking a sense of progression.|$|E
50|$|Where a law {{subsequent}} to contracting is passed, which renders the fundamental principle of contracting illegal, the contract {{will be found}} to <b>be</b> <b>frustrated.</b> There <b>are</b> several situations in which this may occur. Events such as war may render certain trading or actions illegal, {{as was the case}} in Denny, Mott & Dickinson v James Fraser and also see in Ertel Bieber and Co v Rio Tinto Co Ltd 1978 AC 260. If the law changes prohibit performance after the contract was made, the contract may <b>be</b> <b>frustrated.</b> Changes in the law may render building work illegal, or the use of certain materials illegal. A contract for the construction of a reservoir was held to <b>be</b> <b>frustrated</b> following wartime building regulations.|$|R

500|$|Vergne {{was angry}} with d'Ambrosio's {{defensive}} driving {{and found the}} manner d'Ambrosio performed the manoeuvres as not being [...] "acceptable and fair". He described d'Ambrosio's tactics as [...] "totally stupid" [...] and that it prevented him from winning the race and questioned his intelligence. Vergne revealed that d'Ambrosio {{wanted to have a}} conservation about the manoeuvres but Vergne did not wish to speak to him. D'Ambrosio argued that his defensive driving was fair, saying that he was doing his own race. He argued that in the event that the sport's governing body, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile, felt he was overly aggressive, he would be notified and issued a warning D'Ambrosio said that from his point of view, he steered into the corner early and argued that he did not change his line: [...] "Sure, I didn’t give much space but this is racing. I understand it can <b>be</b> <b>frustrating</b> but everyone is doing their own race and it’s what the fans want to see.” He felt he could have achieved a maximum finishing position of fifth but the energy targets displayed on his steering wheel dashboard did not match those provided to him by Dragon, which caused him to push hard until his team realised they were mistaken. Vergne changed his verdict on the clash weeks later after admitting he was not aware that d'Ambrosio had incorrect information relayed to him and felt he had performed [...] "a great race". [...] "Things like this can happen. I don't think there are any more worries about it", he said.|$|E
500|$|Each playable {{character}} in the game {{has the ability to}} equip items. Weapons in the game, unlike its predecessors, are gained in levels. Some items are only found in certain stages, but is only obtainable if completing a goal. Sometimes the goal may be very simple, but some may be not that easy {{to figure out how to}} obtain the certain item. By defeating generals and lieutenants, the player's character is awarded experience scaled by the difficulty of each officer, and the amount of them defeated. This experience is allocated at the end of the level and allows the player to increase their attributes or obtain new forms. Each playable officer has 9 levels to achieve with their standard weapon, while a 10th level is accessible through special in-game requirements, and on the [...] "Hard" [...] difficulty, which is found to <b>be</b> <b>frustrating</b> like most games, the harder the difficulty the more eager you gain. Items can have a number of effects on the player such as increasing attack power, defense, and movement speed. You can also retrieve your health level to avoid getting killed and having [...] "Game Over" [...] by obtaining [...] "Chinese Meatbuns" [...] that at first, look like onions like in any other game in the so far successful Dynasty Warriors franchise. You can also obtain item boost that increase a certain skill by 2 for limited time only. You can also get packs of wine and packs of Chinese Meatbuns in certain stages in certain locations during gameplay. As said above, special items can also be unlocked by completing objectives during gameplay. Special items can grant the player a statistics boost, a unique ability or skill, or even a ride-able mount such as an Elephant or Horse.|$|E
500|$|The group {{initially}} invited Feldmann to hear its demos, and {{he suggested}} that the band regroup at his studio {{the next day to}} make a fresh start. The next day, the group wrote three songs, including the lead single [...] "Bored to Death". As the band continued to write and record, the trio chose to shelve their earlier recordings and proceeded to write 28 songs in a period of 3–4 weeks. Half of these songs were chosen to be put on the finalized album, in addition to two joke songs. Barker fought for all 28 songs to be on the album, as he felt fans had waited long enough for more new music. The trio, as well as Feldmann, regularly stayed in the studio for up to 18 hours a day. The band members would arrive at the studio with no plan for what to work on for the day. They would then write several songs in only a few hours, aiming to complete them {{by the end of the}} night. Feldmann asked the members to consider what Blink-182, as a group, are all about, to inspire the songwriting. He would encourage the musicians to write with speed, which Hoppus admitted could <b>be</b> <b>frustrating.</b> [...] "John was like, 'Okay: We've got the song structure. Write lyrics. Go in there and sing it. Go in there and sing it.' Sometimes, I was like, 'I'm not ready to sing!' (and Feldmann would reply) 'No. Go write something great right now!'" [...] Barker was more supportive of this method based on his work with the Transplants, which had a similar speedy approach. [...] "I always feel like your first instinct is your best," [...] Barker remarked.|$|E
