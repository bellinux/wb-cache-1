40|$|Diagonal <b>bracing</b> is {{a common}} method used in South Africa for the <b>bracing</b> of timber trussed roofs with spans of less than 9 m. In the typical diagonally <b>braced</b> roof system, the <b>brace</b> {{is placed on the}} {{underside}} of the compression chord, which is as far as it can be placed away from the battens that <b>brace</b> the trusses not directly connected to the diagonal <b>brace.</b> Some of the stiffness of the <b>bracing</b> is lost because the low torsional rigidity of the top chord as well as the batten to top chord nailing is all part of the structural system. In this paper the authors investigate <b>bracing</b> of the entire roof system and contend that it is better to connect the <b>bracing</b> member closer to the battens as this improves the stiffness and <b>bracing</b> ability of the system. The authors study both the diagonal <b>brace</b> as well as the alternative <b>bracing</b> method that uses criss-cross metal strapping, sometimes called speed <b>brace.</b> The speed <b>brace</b> is nailed to the top of the compression chord and is therefore much closer to the battens. Two different truss spans were studied to ascertain the buckling length of the top chord for both the diagonal <b>bracing</b> as well as speed <b>bracing.</b> By moving the <b>bracing</b> system closer to the battens the authors show that the speed <b>brace</b> gives a stiffer system which thereby reduces the buckling length of the top compression chord.

Whereas it is normally expected that gusset plates yield and buckle after that of <b>bracing</b> elements. Moreover, <b>bracing</b> elements buckling go with the plastic hinge formation in gusset plates. However, the geometry requirement to provide plastic hinge formation leads to larger and consequently thicker gusset plate. This article presents a research concerning steel <b>bracing</b> connection detail. In this proposed steel <b>bracing</b> connection, Hinge Plate manages the formation of the plastic hinge in the <b>bracing</b> connections. To verify the proposed idea a monotonic compression test was conducted on a <b>bracing</b> element; that was detailed with Hinge Plate. As a primary observational goal of the test, buckling mode of <b>bracing</b> element was depicted to be well managed by Hinge Plate. In addition, it was observed that the hierarchy of yielding in <b>bracing</b> element and then in Hinge Plate coincided with expected energy dissipation requirement in <b>bracing</b> frame...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – Steel <b>braced</b> {{frame is}} one of the {{structural}} systems used to resist earthquake loads in structures. Many existing reinforced concrete structures need retrofitting to overcome deficiencies and to resist seismic loads. The use of steel <b>bracing</b> systems for strengthening or retrofitting seismically in adequate reinforced concrete frames is a viable solution for enhancing earthquake resistance. Steel <b>bracing</b> is economical, easy to erect, occupies less space and has flexibility to design for meeting the required strength and stiffness. In the present study, seismic propensity of knee <b>braced</b> frames as weigh against concentric <b>braced</b> frames was investigated. These investigations were based on stiffness and ductility. Single- bay reinforced concrete frames in two levels which are a 1 - story and a 10 - story with three modes which are reinforced concrete frame without <b>brace</b> and reinforced concrete frame with concentric <b>brace</b> system and reinforced concrete frame with knee <b>brace</b> system were considered. Displacement analysis were performed using the Extended 3 D Analysis of Building Systems (ETABS) software for investigating stiffness of these system and pushover analysis were performed through Open System for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (OPENSEES) software for investigating ductility of these system. Finally, analysis of cyclic loading was done by using again the OPENSEES software for the completion of the investigations. The results of these outputs indicated that concentric <b>bracing</b> can provide a stiffer <b>bracing</b> system but reduces the ductility of the reinforced concrete frame. Knee <b>bracing</b> can be employed to provide the desired ductility level for reinforced concrete frame. It is concluded that both concentric <b>bracing</b> and knee <b>bracing</b> systems may be used to design or to retrofit for a damage-level earthquake. However, when designing or retrofitting for a collapse-level earthquake, knee <b>bracing</b> is a more effective system.
