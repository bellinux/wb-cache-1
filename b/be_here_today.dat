500|$|In 2000, Schmirler {{worked as}} colour {{commentator}} for CBC during Canada's national junior curling championships. During her illness, Schmirler {{had been largely}} removed from the public eye. While in Moncton for the championships, Schmirler {{held a press conference}} to update her situation. In speaking publicly about her ordeal for the first time, Schmirler spared few details about what she had gone through, while also expressing her hope for the future: [...] "There were three goals I had coming out of this thing, and the first one was to look after my family. And the second one...because I curl so much, I've never taken a hot vacation, so I'm going to put my feet in the sand in a warm place.

500|$|By December 2011, Romney assumed an {{even more}} {{prominent}} role in the campaign, {{as she tried to}} offer a more rounded and compelling portrait of her husband while he fell behind Newt Gingrich for a stretch in polls. [...] Her emphasis on their 42years of marriage and his steadfastness following the onset of her disease offered an implicit but clear contrast with Gingrich's own personal history. [...] She had long been known within the family as the [...] "Mitt-stabilizer", due to the calming effect she had on her husband, and continued to perform that role during the up-and-down campaign. [...] In particular, she began appearing with him more often during February 2012 as he dueled with Rick Santorum during the Republican presidential primaries. [...] Regarding the couple's net worth, she alluded to her health problems and said, [...] "Look, I don't even consider myself wealthy, which is an interesting thing, it can <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>today</b> and gone tomorrow. And how I measure riches is by the friends I have and the loved ones that I have and the people that I care about in my life." ...|$|E

The U.S. House Judiciary Committee devoted three hearings to the issue of sport-related brain injuries, repeatedly citing Schwarz's work during them.

[...] Pietersen went on to say: [...] "You know what - I have never said this before - I lost the captaincy, I got rid of the captaincy for the good of English cricket, and we would not <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>today</b> if I had not done what I did then." ...|$|E

6000|$|It {{has given}} me sincere {{pleasure}} to <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>today,</b> at the desire of your highly respected President and the Council of the College. In looking back upon my own past, I am sorry to say that I have found {{that it is a}} quarter of a century since I took part in those hopes and in those fears by which you have all recently been agitated, and which now are at an end. But, although so long a time has elapsed since I was moved by the same feelings, I beg leave to assure you that my sympathy with both victors and vanquished remains fresh--so fresh, indeed, that I could almost try to persuade myself that, after all, it cannot be so very long ago. My business during the last hour, however, has been to show that sympathy with one side only, and I assure you I have done my best to play my part heartily, and to rejoice in the success of those who have succeeded. Still, I should like to remind you at the end of it all, that success on an occasion of this kind, valuable and important as it is, is in reality only putting the foot upon one rung of the ladder which leads upwards; and that the rung of a ladder was never meant to rest upon, but only to hold a man's foot long enough to enable him to put the other somewhat higher. I trust that you will all regard these successes as simply reminders that your next business is, having enjoyed the success of the day, no longer to look at that success, but to look forward to the next difficulty that is to be conquered. And now, having had so much to say to the successful candidates, you must forgive me if I add that a sort of under-current of sympathy has been going on in my mind all the time for those who have not been successful, for those valiant knights who have been overthrown in your tourney, and have not made their appearance in public. I trust that, in accordance with old custom, they, wounded and bleeding, have been carried off to their tents, to be carefully tended by the fairest of maidens; and in these days, when the chances are that every one of such maidens will be a qualified practitioner, I have no doubt that all the splinters will have been carefully extracted, and that they are now physically healed. But there may remain some little fragment of moral or intellectual discouragement, and therefore I will take the liberty to remark that your chairman to-day, if he occupied his proper place, would be among them. Your chairman, in virtue of his position, and for the brief hour that he occupies that position, is a person of importance; and it may be some consolation to those who have failed if I say, that the quarter of a century which I have been speaking of, takes me back to the time when I was up at the University of London, a candidate for honours in anatomy and physiology, and when I was exceedingly well beaten by my excellent friend, Dr. Ransom, of Nottingham. There is a person here who recollects that circumstance very well. I refer to your venerated teacher and mine, Dr. Sharpey. He was at that time one of the examiners in anatomy and physiology, and you may be quite sure that, as he was one of the examiners, there remained not the smallest doubt in my mind of the propriety of his judgment, and I accepted my defeat with the most comfortable assurance that I had thoroughly well earned it. But, gentlemen, the competitor having been a worthy one, and the examination a fair one, I cannot say that I found in that circumstance anything very discouraging. I said to myself, [...] "Never mind; what's the next thing to be done?" [...] And I found that policy of [...] "never minding" [...] and going on to the next thing to be done, to be the most important of all policies in the conduct of practical life. It does not matter how many tumbles you have in this life, so long as you do not get dirty when you tumble; it is only the people who have to stop to be washed and made clean, who must necessarily lose the race. And I can assure you that there is the greatest practical benefit in making a few failures early in life. You learn that which is of inestimable importance--that there are a great many people in the world who are just as clever as you are. You learn to put your trust, by and by, in an economy and frugality of the exercise of your powers, both moral and intellectual; and you very soon find out, if you have not found it out before, that patience and tenacity of purpose are worth more than twice their weight of cleverness. In fact, if I were to go on discoursing on this subject, I should become almost eloquent in praise of non-success; but, lest so doing should seem, in any way, to wither well-earned laurels, I will turn from that topic, and ask you to accompany me in some considerations touching another subject which has a very profound interest for me, and which I think ought to have an equally profound interest for you.|$|E
