40|$|Abstract Background HAIs {{remain a}} {{frequent}} complication for hospitalised patients and pose {{a challenge that}} must be tackled by our health systems. Methods Quasi-experimental study. In {{order to determine the}} antimicrobial effectiveness of surface coating agents containing silver ions (BactiBlock®) the degree of contamination of several surfaces in two ICU wards was compared. The association between application of Bactiblock® and surface contamination was analysed using a relative risk (RR). Multivariate logistic regressions were performed for each product applied and each sampling location to adjust for the RR of the contamination of surfaces treated with Bactiblock® for the independent variables. Results Surface contamination was observed in 31. 5 % of treated samples and 27. 4 of untreated samples. Contamination was equally prominent on <b>bedside</b> <b>Tables</b> (38. 7 %), bed rails (38. 4 %) and sinks (38. 3 %), while the walls showed minimum contamination (2. 6 %). For beds under isolation protocols, contamination was higher (32. 6 %) than when no protocol was followed (26. 5 %) but the difference was not significant (p =  0. 148). After stratification for application method and adjusting the multivariate models for period of the study and presence of isolated patients, the risk of contamination after the intervention increased when the coating agent was applied using a spray (OR =  1. 79; 95 % CI: 1. 08 - 2. 95, particularly in a dry and rugged surface such as that of <b>bedside</b> <b>Tables</b> (OR =  2. 59; 95 % CI: 1. 22 - 5. 52); and decreased when the product was applied using a roller on a smooth and continuously cleaned (or wet) Surface (OR =  0. 42; 95 % CI: 0. 19 - 0. 92). Conclusion Coating of hospital surfaces with substances containing silver ions may reduce bacterial growth. However, the effectiveness of the coating agent is affected by application method and environmental conditions and the type and cleanness of the surface...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: {{to assess}} the {{efficiency}} of cleaning/disinfection of surfaces of an Intensive Care Unit. METHOD: descriptive-exploratory study with quantitative approach conducted {{over the course of}} four weeks. Visual inspection, bioluminescence adenosine triphosphate and microbiological indicators were used to indicate cleanliness/disinfection. Five surfaces (bed rails, <b>bedside</b> <b>tables,</b> infusion pumps, nurses' counter, and medical prescription table) were assessed before and after the use of rubbing alcohol at 70 % (w/v), totaling 160 samples for each method. Non-parametric tests were used considering statistically significant differences at p< 0. 05. RESULTS: after the cleaning/disinfection process, 87. 5, 79. 4 and 87. 5 % of the surfaces were considered clean using the visual inspection, bioluminescence adenosine triphosphate and microbiological analyses, respectively. A statistically significant decrease was observed in the disapproval rates after the cleaning process considering the three assessment methods; the visual inspection was the least reliable. CONCLUSION: the cleaning/disinfection method was efficient in reducing microbial load and organic matter of surfaces, however, these findings require further study to clarify aspects related to the efficiency of friction, its frequency, and {{whether or not there is}} association with other inputs to achieve improved results of the cleaning/disinfection process...|$|E

Methods During a 6 -week period, we cultured commonly touched surfaces (i. e. bedrails, telephones, call buttons, door knobs, toilet seats, and <b>bedside</b> <b>tables)</b> in rooms of patients with CDAD and VRE colonization or infection before and after housekeeping cleaning, and again after disinfection with 10 % bleach performed by the research staff.

40|$|For this {{research}} paper the question posed was “Is there a hospital procedure {{that needs to}} be updated? 2 ̆ 2 To answer that question data was collected from numerous nursing journals and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention to analyze the need for better hygiene of the equipment that comes into contact with the patient. Some of the items that were discussed in the research include: stethoscopes, blood pressure cuffs, thermometers, keyboards, phones, <b>bedside</b> <b>tables,</b> electrocardiogram (ECG) wires, and lab coats. From the evidence based practice research articles, it was evident that more focus needs to be placed on the daily cleaning and disinfection of equipment that receives frequent use to assess patients. It was evident after being in the facility on two separate occasions that a need for further education and reinforcement on proper disinfectant practices was needed. Some related interventions that should be included are reinforcement of proper cleaning techniques of patient care equipment on shift by shift basis, not just when the patient is being discharged or transferred. Another intervention that should be addressed is how to use correct cleaning and disinfecting products based on the patient’s needs, diagnosis, and the contamination level of the equipment. Another important factor is to consider the type of material that makes up the equipment when selecting a disinfectant solution. With all of these aspects in mind and also the concept to make cleaning of patient care equipment more routine in daily patient care is a critical topic {{that needs to be}} addressed, policies changed, and interventions implemented...|$|E
