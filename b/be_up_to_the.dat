5|$|After the {{groundbreaking}} opticals of Star Wars, The Motion Pictures producers realized the film required similarly high-quality visuals. Douglas Trumbull, a film director with an excellent reputation in Hollywood {{who had worked}} on , was the first choice for director of special effects, but declined the offer. When approached, Trumbull was busy on Close Encounters, and was tired of being ignored as a director and having to churn out special effects for someone else's production; after completing the effects work, Trumbull planned on launching his own feature using a new film process. The next choice, John Dykstra, was similarly wrapped up in other projects. Post-production supervisor Paul Rabwin suggested Robert Abel's production company Robert Abel and Associates might <b>be</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> task. The scope {{and size of the}} effects grew after the television movie became The Motion Picture. Abel and Associates bid $4million for doing the film's effects and Paramount accepted. As new effects were added, Abel increased their bid by $750,000, and Roddenberry suggested that the effects costs and schedules be reexamined.|$|E

25|$|Among the {{winemaking}} decisions where a producer's style {{can come}} through is {{the decision of}} whether or not to destem the grapes prior to crushing and fermentation. The presence of stems provide channels for the juice to percolate through the mass of grape skins that will form the cap during fermentation. This cap needs to be managed well and kept in constant contact with the juice in order to extract the color and phenolic compounds that will affect the flavor and aroma of the wine. While stems can help with this cap management, they also provide an additional source of tannins that may be extracted into the wine. The degree of tannin extraction desired will <b>be</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> winemaker with some tannins adding to the mouthfeel and aging potential of the wine while too much can make the wine seem harsh, bitter and out of the balance. The length of maceration, whether or not the wine stays in contact with its skin throughout the entire fermentation period, as well as the temperature that the wine is kept at throughout that fermentation will have an influence on the extraction of the color, tannins and phenols. The temperature of fermentation will also affect the volatilizing of the compounds that contribute to the aroma of the wine.|$|E
500|$|... "See No Evil" [...] was {{directed}} by Chris Menaul and written by series creator Paul Attanasio, who had not penned a Homicide script since series premiere [...] "Gone for Goode". The episode was originally meant to be the [...] premiere, but NBC decided to air [...] "" [...] first because it featured a guest appearance by Robin Williams, which the network hoped would lead to increased Nielsen ratings. Like the other three second season episodes, the script for [...] "See No Evil" [...] was already finished {{by the time the}} [...] ended, but due to poor ratings throughout the duration of the show, NBC executives asked for several refinements [...] including fewer episode subplots and less camera movements and jump cuts [...] before approving a second season. Attanasio deliberately wrote the [...] "See No Evil" [...] script so that it would be morally questionable whether the police handling of both main subplots [...] the assisted suicide and the suspected police shooting [...] were handled in an ethically correct way. Ultimately, Attanasio wanted it to <b>be</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> audience to interpret for themselves.|$|E

500|$|At the London {{conference that}} drew up the indictments of German war crimes before the Nuremberg trials, the Soviet negotiators put forward the allegation, [...] "In September 1941, 925 Polish {{officers}} who were prisoners of war {{were killed in the}} Katyn Forest near Smolensk". The U.S. negotiators agreed to include it, but were [...] "embarrassed" [...] by the inclusion (noting that the allegation had been debated extensively in the press) and concluded that it would <b>be</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Soviets to sustain it. At the trials in 1946, Soviet General Roman Rudenko raised the indictment, stating that [...] "one of the most important criminal acts for which the major war criminals are responsible was the mass execution of Polish prisoners of war shot in the Katyn forest near Smolensk by the German fascist invaders", but failed to make the case and the U.S. and British judges dismissed the charges. It was not the purpose of the court to determine whether Germany or the Soviet Union was responsible for the crime, but rather to attribute the crime to {{at least one of the}} defendants, which the court was unable to do.|$|E
500|$|Australia {{had less}} than 15 minutes of batting before the {{scheduled}} close of play. Barnes made an appeal against the light after the first ball of the innings, which was a wide by Edrich. Barnes walked down the pitch and reportedly muttered to umpire Frank Chester in a casual tone [...] "Eh, the light!", which allegedly shocked the arbiter. During the previous Ashes series in Australia, Barnes had continuously made time-wasting appeals against the light, which forced cricket administrators to limit the batting team to one appeal; if this was declined it would <b>be</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> umpires to offer an adjournment. Despite the appeal against the light, the Australians showed little desire to be watchful against Edrich's bowling, scoring 11 runs from his two overs. Morris and Barnes successfully negotiated the new ball bowling of Edrich and Bedser. They reached stumps at 17 without loss, with Morris on 10 and Barnes on six. Barnes had been fortunate, edging both Edrich and Bedser through the slip cordon, and Yardley's decision to place his bowlers Young and Bedser in that region raised surprise; bowlers tend to lack the agility and reflexes needed for such positions. At this stage, following their tail-end resistance, England were {{in a good position}} with runs on the board if rain struck overnight and caused a sticky wicket, forcing the Australians to bat in hostile conditions the following day.|$|E
500|$|Martin's uncle Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron (known as Lord Fairfax) {{owned the}} Northern Neck Proprietary land grant, {{which he had}} {{inherited}} from Martin's great-grandfather Thomas Colepeper, 2nd Baron Colepeper in 1719. The proprietary constituted up to [...] of Virginia's Northern Neck and a vast area spanning west to the North Branch Potomac River headwaters. The Northern Neck Proprietary had been awarded by the exiled Charles II of England to seven of his supporters in 1649, and again in 1688 by official patent. One of these seven supporters, Lord Colepeper, acquired the right to the entire proprietary in 1681, and his grandson, Lord Fairfax, inherited the land grant upon {{the death of his}} mother, Katherine Colepeper. Lord Fairfax dispatched his first cousin William Fairfax (1691–1757) to replace Robert Carter I as the steward and land agent for the Northern Neck Proprietary, a position in which Fairfax served until his death in 1757. In 1750, Martin's uncle Lord Fairfax established himself at his hunting plantation Greenway Court estate near present-day White Post in Clarke County with the intention of administering the proprietary himself. Lord Fairfax had previously reserved this land as his private residence in 1747, then known as [...] "the Quarter". With his cousin William Fairfax acting as land agent, Lord Fairfax sought additional assistance in managing the proprietary and scrutinized which of his family members from England would <b>be</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> task. Lord Fairfax first considered his brother Robert, then his brother-in-law Denny Martin, and in 1751, he finally decided upon enlisting the assistance of his twenty-year-old nephew and Denny Martin's son, Thomas Bryan Martin.|$|E

2500|$|Nevada {{politicians}} can (and generally do) play {{both sides}} of the prostitution dispute by declaring that they are personally opposed to prostitution but feel it should <b>be</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> counties to decide.
