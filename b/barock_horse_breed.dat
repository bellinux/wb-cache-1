40|$|Theme of {{this thesis}} is Breeding of the American <b>horse</b> <b>breeds</b> {{and their use}} in equestrian sport in the Czech Republic. This thesis is focused on {{individual}} American <b>horse</b> <b>breeds</b> and their use in equestrian, especially western sport. Thesis is focused on current situation in breeding of the American <b>horse</b> <b>breeds</b> in the Czech Republic. It describes individual western disciplines and associations organizing particular events. It's also focused on current situation in breeding of the American <b>horse</b> <b>breeds</b> in USA. For purpose of research, statistical data from Central horse evidence and associations of particular <b>horse</b> <b>breeds</b> about actual situation in breeding of the American <b>horse</b> <b>breeds</b> were used. Through analysis of mentioned data, increasing tendency in number of American <b>horse</b> <b>breeds</b> in the Czech Republic was found...|$|R

50|$|The Chilean horse or Chilean Corralero is a <b>horse</b> <b>breed</b> from South America. It is {{the oldest}} {{registered}} native American breed, the oldest registered breed of Iberian origin, the oldest registered <b>horse</b> <b>breed</b> in South America and the oldest registered stock <b>horse</b> <b>breed</b> in the Western Hemisphere.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the genetic ancestry and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) diversity of current Colombian <b>horse</b> <b>breeds</b> we sequenced a 364 -bp fragment of the mitocondrial DNA D-loop in 116 animals belonging to five Spanish <b>horse</b> <b>breeds</b> and the Colombian Paso Fino and Colombian Creole cattle <b>horse</b> <b>breeds.</b> Among Colombian <b>horse</b> <b>breeds,</b> haplogroup D had the highest frequency (53 %), followed by haplogroups A (19 %), C (8 %) and F (6 %). The higher frequency of haplogroup D in Colombian <b>horse</b> <b>breeds</b> supports the theory of an ancestral Iberian origin for these breeds. These results also indicate that different selective pressures among the Colombian breeds could explain the relatively higher genetic diversity found in the Colombian Creole cattle horse when compared with the Colombian Paso Fino...|$|R

40|$|Title: Influence of <b>horse</b> <b>breed</b> {{and type}} of terrain on {{activation}} of the abdominal muscles in hippotherapy. Purposes: The aim {{of the study is}} to find out if <b>horse</b> <b>breed</b> {{and type of}} terrain approaches muscle activation in the position of unassisted sitting Methods: The study is of intraindividual character and incudes theoretical and practical part. The activation of abdominal muscles was measured by using surface electromyography and kinematic analysis. Results: There was differance between muscle activation with a different type of terrain. <b>Horse</b> <b>breed</b> does not influence a muscle activation but the individual biomechanic of each horse.

50|$|Estonian horse (eesti hobune), {{also known}} as the Estonian native, the Estonian Klepper, or {{natively}} the Eesti hobune, is a relatively small <b>horse</b> <b>breed</b> originating in Estonia.

The Estonian horse has influenced several Baltic <b>horse</b> <b>breeds,</b> including the Tori <b>horse.</b> The <b>breed</b> is strong and is resistant against sickness.

40|$|In {{order to}} protect the genetic {{resource}} of native <b>horse</b> <b>breeds,</b> the genetic diversity of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) D-loop of three native <b>horse</b> <b>breeds</b> in western China were investigated. Forty-three 600 bp mtDNA D-loop sequences were analyzed by PCR and sequencing techniques, 33 unique haplotypes with 70 polymorphic sites were detected in these horses, which account for 11. 67 % of 600 bp sequence analyzed, showing the abundant genetic diversity of the three native <b>horse</b> <b>breeds</b> in western China. The Neighbour-Joining (NJ) phylogenetic tree based on 247 bp of 43 D-loop sequences demonstrated the presence of seven major lineages (A to G), indicating that the three native <b>horse</b> <b>breeds</b> in western China originated from multiple maternal origins. Consistent with the front, the NJ phylogenetic tree based on 600 bp of mtDNA D-loop sequences of 43 Chinese western native horses and 81 sequences of six <b>horse</b> <b>breeds</b> from GenBank indicated that the three <b>horse</b> <b>breeds</b> had distributed into the seven major lineages (A to G). The structure of the phylogenic tree is often blurred because the variation in a short segment of the mitochondrial genome is often accompanied by high levels of recurrent mutations. Consequently, longer D-loop sequences are helpful in achieving a higher level of molecular resolution in horses...|$|R
40|$|To {{assist in}} {{selection}} schemes we estimate the genetic {{diversity of the}} <b>horse</b> <b>breeds.</b> Genetic diversity at 13 microsatellite loci was compared in six horse breeds: Jeju Native Horse, American Quarter, Jeju Racing Horse, Mongolian Horse, Japanese Horse and Thoroughbred. All of the equine microsatellite {{used in this study}} were amplified and were polymorphic. The expected total heterozygosity over all the populations varied between 0. 669 and 0. 869 and the expected heterozygosity within population range from 0. 569 to 0. 219 in this study. The low coefficient of gene differentiation value showed that only 0. 118 of the diversity was between <b>horses</b> <b>breeds.</b> The constructed dendrogram from the genetic distance matrix showed little differentiation between <b>horse</b> <b>breeds</b> using DISPAN program. The genet-ic distance using 13 microsatellites ranged between 0. 137 and 0. 414 for the six <b>horse</b> <b>breeds.</b> These results confirm the potential use of equine microsatellite loci as a tool for genetic studies in horse populations. The genetic diversity of the six <b>horse</b> <b>breeds</b> to each other closed to their geographical distribution. Suggesting that the loci would be suitable for <b>horse</b> <b>breeds</b> parentage testing. Therefore, Microsatellite marker seems to be very useful for clarifying the evolutionary relationships of closely related populations...|$|R
