5|$|In May 2011, Cielo tested {{positive}} for the banned substance furosemide. Furosemide is a diuretic often used to help lose weight <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>a</b> masking agent which may hide the presence of other drugs. Cielo was one of four Brazilian swimmers who {{tested positive}} for the substance and was given a warning by Brazil's national swimming federation. Cielo claimed the positive drug test was a result of a cross-contamination. FINA appealed Cielo's case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) and CAS upheld the warning for Cielo. CAS claimed that a caffeine supplement had been contaminated, causing the failed drug test. CAS was convinced that the furosemide found was not aimed at improving athletic performance or masking the use of some other performance-enhancing substance.|$|E

5|$|The black meat of a Silkie is {{generally}} considered an unusual attribute in European and American cuisines. In contrast, several Asian cuisines consider Silkie meat a gourmet food. Chinese cuisine especially values the breed, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>a</b> common ingredient in some Japanese, Cambodian, Vietnamese and Korean dishes. Areas where Chinese cuisine has been a strong influence, such as Malaysia, may also cook Silkie. As early as the 7th century, traditional Chinese medicine has held that chicken soup made with Silkie meat is a curative food. The usual methods of cooking include using Silkie to make broth, braising, and in curries. Traditional Chinese soup made with Silkie also uses ingredients such as wolfberries, Dioscorea polystachya (mountain yam), orange peel, and fresh ginger. A few fusion restaurants in metropolitan areas of the West have also cooked it {{as a part of}} traditional American or French cuisine, such as in confit.|$|E

25|$|From an {{electrical}} {{point of view}} the electrolyte in an electrolytic capacitor is the actual cathode of the capacitor and must have good electrical conductivity, which is actually ion-conductivity in liquids. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>a</b> chemical mixture of solvents with acid or alkali additives, which must be non-corrosive (chemically inert) so that the capacitor, whose inner components are made of aluminum, remains stable over its expected lifetime. In addition to the good conductivity of operating electrolytes, there are other requirements, including chemical stability, chemical compatibility with aluminum, and low cost. The electrolyte should also provide oxygen for the forming processes and self-healing. This diversity of requirements for the liquid electrolyte results in a broad variety of proprietary solutions, with thousands of patented electrolytes.|$|E

25|$|The alkanes from pentane (C5H12) to octane (C8H18) are refined into gasoline, {{the ones}} from nonane (C9H20) to {{hexadecane}} (C16H34) into diesel fuel, kerosene and jet fuel. Alkanes {{with more than}} 16 carbon atoms can be refined into fuel oil and lubricating oil. At the heavier end of the range, paraffin wax is an alkane with approximately 25 carbon atoms, while asphalt has 35 and up, although these are usually cracked by modern refineries into more valuable products. The shortest molecules, those with four or fewer carbon atoms, are in a gaseous state at room temperature. They are the petroleum gases. Depending on demand {{and the cost of}} recovery, these gases are either flared off, sold as liquefied petroleum gas under pressure, or used to power the refinery's own burners. During the winter, butane (C4H10), is blended into the gasoline pool at high rates, because its high vapor pressure assists with cold starts. Liquified under pressure slightly above atmospheric, it is best known for powering cigarette lighters, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>a</b> main fuel source for many developing countries. Propane can be liquified under modest pressure, and is consumed for just about every application relying on petroleum for energy, from cooking to heating to transportation.|$|E

500|$|Following {{a three-year}} period of {{creative}} drought in the early 1980s after his marriage to Antonia Fraser {{and the death of}} Vivien Merchant, Pinter's plays tended to become shorter and more overtly political, serving as critiques of oppression, torture, and other abuses of human rights, linked by the apparent [...] "invulnerability of power." [...] Just before this hiatus, in 1979, Pinter re-discovered his manuscript of The Hothouse, which he had written in 1958 but had set aside; he revised it and then directed its first production himself at Hampstead Theatre in London, in 1980. Like his plays of the 1980s, The Hothouse concerns authoritarianism and the abuses of power politics, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>a</b> comedy, like his earlier comedies of menace. [...] Pinter played the major role of Roote in a 1995 revival at the Minerva Theatre, Chichester.|$|E

500|$|Barbauld's fifty-volume {{series of}} The British Novelists, {{published}} in 1810 with her large introductory {{essay on the}} history of the novel, allowed her to place her mark on literary history. It was [...] "the first English edition to make comprehensive critical and historical claims" [...] and was in every respect [...] "a canon-making enterprise." [...] In her insightful essay, Barbauld legitimises the novel, then still a controversial genre, by connecting it to ancient Persian and Greek literature. For her, a good novel is [...] "an epic in prose, with more of character and less (indeed in modern novels nothing) of the supernatural machinery." [...] Barbauld maintains that novel-reading has a multiplicity of benefits; not only is it a [...] "domestic pleasure", <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>a</b> way to [...] "infus principles and moral feelings" [...] into the population.

500|$|Near Erdene Zuu Monastery in Övörkhangai Province of Mongolia is Kharkhorin Rock which {{contains}} a massive {{statue of a}} penis raised on a platform on the steppe. The statue has dual functions; primarily it is a reminder to the monks to remain celibate, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>a</b> symbol of fertility and human life. A smaller statue of a phallus is nearer the monastery. Haesindang Park (also known as [...] "Penis Park") in Gangwon Province of South Korea, located about [...] south of Samcheok, is a nature park {{which contains}} a number of erect statues.

The townspeople were devastated and helpless, and a curse {{appeared to have been}} cast over them, ruining the local fishing industry. One day, a local fisherman relieved himself in the sea and miraculously the fishing industry revived. He discovered that her restless spirit could be appeased in such a manner, so the townsfolk compensated for the woman's inability to consummate beyond the grave by placing sexually potent phallic statues in view of the shore. The statues range in size and styles; some have faces on them and are more animated in appearance and more colorful, but others are exact depictions of the human penis.|$|E

500|$|... "Possibly Maybe" [...] is {{a fusion}} of trip hop and chill-out music, which the San Francisco Chronicle review called [...] "a fragmented, poetic {{rumination}} on love's ups and downs". It has also been considered ambient dub. Björk {{has said that it}} was the first unhappy song she wrote, stating in 1997: [...] "That was very hard for me. [...] I was ashamed writing a song that was not giving hope". The slide guitar heard in the background of the song was originally intended to be its focal point, as Björk initially strived for an [...] "ambient country" [...] sound inspired by Chris Isaak's [...] "Wicked Game". The lyrics of [...] "Possibly Maybe" [...] document the various stages of the singer's ill-fated relationship with Stéphane Sednaoui. [...] "I Miss You" [...] was described in 1997 as an [...] "amalgam of styles, with electronic drums melding into African bongos mixed with jazzy horn playing". A house music number, its [...] "horn-infused Afro-Cuban strains [...] reflect the romantic whimsy of [...] lyrics". Björk wrote [...] "Cover Me", one of the quieter moments on the album, to her co-producer Nellee Hooper after he {{agreed to participate in the}} making of Post. She has said: [...] "I guess I was trying to make fun of myself, how dangerous I manage sometimes to make album making. And trying to lure him into it. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>a</b> admiration thing from me to him". The album ends with the experimental [...] "Headphones", an ambient track. Featuring [...] "just-for-headphones studio tricks", it has been described as [...] "a chiming, somnolent dip into Björk's heavy-lidded pre-dream state". Its lyrics were written as a thank you to Graham Massey, who would make compilation cassettes for Björk. The singer also stated: [...] "But, of course, it is also a love letter to sound.
