5|$|In {{the study}} of natural selection, the {{population}} of Soay sheep that remain {{on the island of}} Hirta have been used to explore the relation of body size and coloration to reproductive success. Soay sheep come in several colors, and researchers investigated why the larger, darker sheep were in decline; this occurrence contradicted the rule of thumb that larger members of a population tend to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>successful</b> reproductively. The feral Soays on Hirta are especially useful subjects because they are isolated.|$|E

5|$|Kei Iwasaki of {{the band}} Sekaiichi, writing for Musica, felt that Ichiro Yamaguchi's dual love of 1990s pop music and {{electronic}} musicians such as Daft Punk and Cornelius strongly expressed itself throughout the album. He lauded Sakanaction's efforts to mix electronica and pop, but felt that mixing these two genres was a double-edged sword that invariably influenced the composition of songs. Because of this, he felt that Night Fishing might <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>successful</b> musically if the songs were re-recorded.|$|E
5|$|Many of the pre-game and in-game {{strategic}} {{decisions in}} baseball revolve around a fundamental fact: in general, right-handed batters tend to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>successful</b> against left-handed pitchers and, {{to an even}} greater degree, left-handed batters tend to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>successful</b> against right-handed pitchers. A manager with several left-handed batters in the regular lineup who knows the team will be facing a left-handed starting pitcher may respond by starting {{one or more of}} the right-handed backups on the team's roster. During the late innings of a game, as relief pitchers and pinch hitters are brought in, the opposing managers will often go back and forth trying to create favorable matchups with their substitutions: the manager of the fielding team trying to arrange same-handed pitcher-batter matchups, the manager of the batting team trying to arrange opposite-handed matchups. With a team that has the lead in the late innings, a manager may remove a starting position player—especially one whose turn at bat is not likely to come up again—for a more skillful fielder. Furthermore, unlike players in most team sports, baseball players can not return to a game after being replaced; this creates a greater risk when making lineup changes, especially as a team's pitching staff may be increasingly depleted in the late innings of a game, particularly one which goes into multiple extra innings.|$|E
5|$|That night, the Japanese made a minor {{attack against}} 'C' Company, {{but this was}} turned back with {{artillery}} and small arms. The following day the Australians resumed their attack. In doing so, McKinna ordered 'D' Company to renew the assault, aiming for Pear Hill, on the right hand side of the Australian line. Although it required a more physically draining approach march over Artillery Hill and through dense scrub, the tactic proved to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>successful</b> than the previous day's efforts. Pear Hill was joined by a narrow razorback ridge that limited the Australian frontage to just three men side-by-side, who had to cut {{their way through the}} thick bamboo with machetes. Weighed down with full marching order and heavy weapons, including Vickers machine guns, the Australians found it heavy going. It took the majority of the afternoon to reach {{the crest of the hill}} where they were to form up for the final assault. A thirty-minute pause followed, after which an artillery barrage was called down upon the Japanese defenders. On their right, 'A' Company, began to draw the Japanese fire and at 15:30 hours 'D' Company attacked the ridge, across a thin saddle. By late afternoon, the Japanese defenders had pulled back from the ridge, leaving the Australians in possession of it after heavy fighting with 'D' Company securing the main position, while 'B' Company skirted north of Barton's Knoll and secured a secondary position below the ridge, which the Australians dubbed Baker's Brow. Meanwhile, on the Australian left—the western side of the battlefield—a Juki heavy machine and snipers held up 'C' Company's advance.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of incumbent firms on the decision to allow foreign direct investment into an industry. Using data from India's economic reforms, {{the results show that}} firms in concentrated industries <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>successful</b> at preventing foreign entry, state-owned firms <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>successful</b> at stopping foreign entry than privately-owned firms, and profitable state-owned firms <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>successful</b> at stopping foreign entry than unprofitable state-owned firms. The pattern of foreign entry liberalization supports the private interest view of policy implementation and suggests that {{it may be necessary to}} reduce {{the influence of}} state-owned firms to optimally enact reforms. ...|$|R

25|$|The {{concept of}} tumor {{hierarchy}} claims that a tumor is a heterogeneous population of mutant cells, {{all of which}} share some mutations, but vary in specific phenotype. A tumor hosts several types of stem cells, one optimal to the specific environment and other less successful lines. These secondary lines may <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>successful</b> in other environments, allowing the tumor to adapt, including adaptation to therapeutic intervention. If correct, this concept impacts cancer stem cell-specific treatment regimes. Such a hierarchy would complicate attempts to pinpoint the origin.|$|E

25|$|Startups usually need to form {{partnerships}} with other firms to enable their business model to operate. To become attractive to other businesses, startups need to align their internal features, such as management style and products {{with the market}} situation. In their 2013 study, Kask and Linton develop two ideal profiles, or also known as configurations or archetypes, for startups that are commercializing inventions. The inheritor profile calls for a management style that is not too entrepreneurial (more conservative) and the startup should have an incremental invention (building on a previous standard). This profile is set out to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>successful</b> (in finding a business partner) in a market that has a dominant design (a clear standard is applied in this market). In contrast to this profile is the originator which has a management style that is highly entrepreneurial and in which a radical invention or a disruptive innovation (totally new standard) is being developed. This profile is set out to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>successful</b> (in finding a business partner) in a market {{that does not have}} a dominant design (established standard). New startups should align themselves to one of the profiles when commercializing an invention {{to be able to find}} and be attractive to a business partner. By finding a business partner a startup will have greater chances to become successful.|$|E

25|$|Music therapy {{can be used}} {{to improve}} {{function}} in patients that have lesions resulting from stroke or other disorders. More recent research suggests that music can increase a patient's motivation and positive emotions. Current research also suggests that when music therapy is used in conjunction with traditional therapy it improves success rates significantly. Therefore, it is hypothesized that music therapy helps a victim of stroke recover faster and with more success by increasing the patient's positive emotions and motivation, allowing him or her to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>successful</b> and feel more driven to participate in traditional therapies.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s {{research}} in both {{animals and humans}} began to provide evidence that sex hormones {{play an important role}} in early life in promoting or constraining adult sex-dimorphic sexual behavior and even gender identity. Examples of apparent androgen determination of gender identity in XY people with 5-alpha-reductase deficiency in the Dominican Republic had been published, along with reports of masculinized behavior in girls with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), and unsatisfactory sexual outcomes in adult women with CAH. Many endocrinologists were becoming skeptical that reassignment of genetic males to females was just a matter of learning and appearance, or that the newer clitoral reductions would <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>successful</b> than clitoral recessions.|$|E

25|$|Fighter Command {{cooperated with}} the navy during the Battle of Dunkirk when the RAF {{provided}} fighter cover for the embarkation of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), which was costly for both services. By 1 June, the RAF reduced its effort to conserve its fighters and a Minesweeper, one transport and three Destroyers were sunk and two destroyers were damaged in their absence. The absence of air cover was not uncommon and the RAF believed itself to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>successful</b> in battle, over-claiming German losses by 4:1. Of the 156 German aircraft lost in the west, about 35 were downed by fire from naval vessels leaving 102, aside from other causes, {{likely to have been}} shot down by the RAF against 106 British losses.|$|E
25|$|Emmy Werner {{was one of}} {{the early}} {{scientists}} to use the term resilience in the 1970s. She studied a cohort of children from Kauai, Hawaii. Kauai was quite poor and many {{of the children in the}} study grew up with alcoholic or mentally ill parents. Many of the parents were also out of work. Werner noted that of the children who grew up in these detrimental situations, two-thirds exhibited destructive behaviors in their later teen years, such as chronic unemployment, substance abuse, and out-of-wedlock births (in case of teenage girls). However, one-third of these youngsters did not exhibit destructive behaviours. Werner called the latter group 'resilient'. Thus, resilient children and their families were those who, by definition, demonstrated traits that allowed them to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>successful</b> than non-resilient children and families.|$|E

This led to an approach to both corporations, with the intention of selling BUA to one of them. BEA, which was approached first, refused because it considered the price Sir Nicholas was asking for BUA — £9 million — too high. A subsequent approach to BOAC proved to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>successful.</b> Sir Keith Granville, BOAC's then MD, agreed to purchase BUA from B for £7.9 million. Roy Mason, the President of the Board of Trade, gave the Government's preliminary approval to BOAC's proposed takeover of BUA, on the understanding that there were no realistic prospects of a merger with another independent airline as recommended in the Edwards report.|$|E
