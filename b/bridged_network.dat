We propose a global fairness reference model as the benchmark for global fairness of inter-ring traffic. We then propose a global fairness algorithm for implementing such a global fairness. We also propose how we can use the same algorithm to minimize the occurrence of buffer overflow at the bridges. Simulations were performed to evaluate the algorithms using various network scenarios and traffic patterns. The results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve the intended results of ensuring global fairness and minimizing buffer overflow in bridged RPR networks. Key words...|$|E

These {{complexes}} have been prepared by the reactions of UOF 4 with the pentafluorides in anhydrous hydrofluoric acid solvent or by fusing together UOF 4 /MF 5 mixtures. They have been characterized by elemental analysis, vibrational spectroscopy and X-ray powder diffraction {{and it has been}} shown that, in these complexes, UOF 4 possesses fluoride-ion donor properties. The first examples of compounds formed between uranyl fluoride and a Lewis acid pentafluoride are reported. The reaction of anhydrous UO 2 F 2 with SbF 5 in anhydrous HF produces UO 2 F 2. 3 SbF 5 which, on heating in vacuo at 125 C, gives UO 2 F 2. 2 SbF 5. On heating to 245 C this 1 : 2 adduct loses both SbF 5 ligands simultaneously to produce anhydrous UO 2 F 2. The crystal structure of the 1 : 3 adduct has been determined from single-crystal X-ray studies which have shown it to be a fluorine <b>bridged</b> <b>network.</b> The structure can be described in terms of zig-zag chains of UO 2 groups linked to SbF 6 units with Sb 2 F 11 units attached as side-chains to the uranium with significant ionic contributions to the bondings. Solutions of UOF 4 with SbF 5 in anhydrous HF are unstable for periods of longer than a few hours at room temperature. On standing these orange solutions lose their colour and crystals of uranium hexafluoride appear.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyse the role of social capital and <b>bridging</b> <b>networks</b> on {{entrepreneurial}} activity in three different regions in Sweden. Design/methodology/approach – The empirical base of the paper comprises 120 in-depth interviews with entrepreneurs and other stakeholders in three municipalities in Sweden, statistical data from Statistics Sweden and a large postal survey conducted by the Confederation of Swedish Enterprises. Findings – The <b>bridging</b> <b>networks</b> between local civil servants and local politicians on the one hand and entrepreneurs on the other are pivotal for the development of an entrepreneurial community. Research limitations/implications – Despite the same rational-legal framework, this paper shows how the cognitive dimension of social capital influences the level of entrepreneurship in three municipalities. The importance of <b>bridging</b> <b>networks</b> is also highlighted. Practical implications – An open channel of communication between politicians and entrepreneurs allows the former to gain legitimacy in the eyes of the latter.

40|$|For {{managing}} highway bridges, stakeholders require {{efficient and}} practical decision making techniques. In {{a context of}} limited bridge management budget, {{it is crucial to}} determine the most effective breakdown of financial resources over the different structures of a <b>bridge</b> <b>network.</b> <b>Bridge</b> management systems (BMSs) have been developed for such a purpose. However, they generally rely on an individual approach. The influence of the position of bridges in the transportation network, the consequences of inadequate service for the network users, due to maintenance actions or bridge failure, are not taken into consideration. Therefore, maintenance strategies obtained with current BMSs do not necessarily lead to an optimal level of service (LOS) of the <b>bridge</b> <b>network</b> for the users of the transportation network. Besides, the assessment of the structural performance of highway bridges usually requires the access to the geometrical and mechanical properties of its components. Such information might not be available for all structures in a <b>bridge</b> <b>network</b> for which managers try to schedule and prioritize maintenance strategies. On the contrary, visual inspections are performed regularly and information is generally available for all structures of the <b>bridge</b> <b>network.</b> The objective of this paper is threefold (1) propose an advanced network-level bridge management system considering the position of each bridge in the transportation network, (2) use information obtained at visual inspections to assess the performance of bridges, and (iii) compare optimal maintenance strategies, obtained with a genetic algorithm, when considering interests of users and bridge owner either separately as conflicting criteria, or simultaneously as a common interest for the whole community.

Structurally they consist of three domains, each containing two transmembrane alpha-helices linked {{by a short}} alpha-helix and loop. The substrate binds to three major contact points in the central cavity. The class of substrate (e. g., adenine nucleotides) is determined by contact point II on transmembrane alpha-helix H 4 {{and the type of}} substrate within the class (e. g., ADP, coenzyme A) by contact point I in H 2, whereas contact point III on H 6 is most usually a positively charged residue, irrespective of the type or class. Two salt <b>bridge</b> <b>networks,</b> consisting of conserved and symmetric residues, are located on the matrix and cytoplasmic side of the cavity. These residues are part of the gates that are involved in opening and closing of the carrier during the transport cycle, exposing the central substrate binding site to either side of the membrane in an alternating way. Here we revisit the plethora of mutagenesis data that have been collected {{over the last two decades}} to see if the residues in the proposed binding site and salt <b>bridge</b> <b>networks</b> are indeed important for function.

40|$|The {{structures}} of mitochondrial transporters and uncoupling proteins are 3 -fold pseudosymmetrical, but their substrates and coupling ions are not. Thus, deviations from symmetry {{are to be}} expected in the substrate and ion-binding sites in the central aqueous cavity. By analyzing the 3 -fold pseudosymmetrical repeats from which their sequences are made, conserved asymmetric residues were found to cluster in a region of the central cavity identified previously as the common substrate-binding site. Conserved symmetrical residues required for the transport mechanism were found at the water–membrane interfaces, and they include the three PX[DE]XX[RK] motifs, which form a salt <b>bridge</b> <b>network</b> on the matrix side of the cavity when the substrate-binding site is open to the mitochondrial intermembrane space. Symmetrical residues in three [FY][DE]XX[RK] motifs are on the cytoplasmic side of the cavity and could form a salt <b>bridge</b> <b>network</b> when the substrate-binding site is accessible from the mitochondrial matrix. It is proposed that the opening and closing of the carrier may be coupled to the disruption and formation of the 2 salt <b>bridge</b> <b>networks</b> via a 3 -fold rotary twist induced by substrate binding.

In the cytoplasmic state, which can be locked by carboxy-atractyloside, the substrate binding site is accessible to the cytoplasm, whereas in the matrix state, which can be locked by bongkrekic acid, the substrate binding site {{is open to the}} mitochondrial matrix. Access to the substrate binding site is regulated by salt <b>bridge</b> <b>networks</b> {{on either side of the}} central cavity, called the matrix and cytoplasmic salt <b>bridge</b> <b>network.</b> It has been proposed that during transport the salt <b>bridge</b> <b>networks</b> disrupt and form in an alternating way, opening and closing the binding site to opposite sides of the membrane, but experimental evidence has not been obtained for this mechanism. Single cysteine mutations were introduced at the cytoplasmic side of the yeast mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier, and the mutant carriers were expressed in the cytoplasmic membrane of Lactococcus lactis. They were capable of ADP transport and they could be inhibited by carboxy-atractyloside and bongkrekic acid. The complete inhibition by carboxy-atractyloside demonstrated that the carriers were oriented with the cytoplasmic side to the outside of the cells. To probe the accessibility of the single cysteines, the mutant carriers were locked in either the cytoplasmic or matrix state with the two inhibitors and labelled with the membrane-impermeable sulphydryl reagent eosin- 5 -maleimide. Specific cysteines that were accessible in the cytoplasmic state had become inaccessible in the matrix state. Subsequent experiments showed that ADP and ATP, but not AMP, led to the occlusion of single cysteines, demonstrating that the cytoplasmic side of the ADP/ATP carrier closes as part of the transport cycle. In addition, cross-linking studies combined with mass spectrometry and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy were tried to probe the closure of the cytoplasmic salt <b>bridge</b> <b>network...</b>|$|R
