5|$|After {{his victory}} at Hastings, William {{expected}} {{to receive the}} submission of the surviving English leaders, but instead Edgar the Ætheling was proclaimed king by the Witenagemot, {{with the support of}} Earls Edwin and Morcar, Stigand, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and Ealdred, the Archbishop of York. William therefore advanced, marching around the coast of Kent to London. He defeated an English force that attacked him at Southwark, <b>but</b> <b>being</b> unable to storm London Bridge he sought to reach the capital by a more circuitous route.|$|E
5|$|As I {{look back}} on it today, I see the whole picture very differently. It's true that I hated missing out on Sexton. And the first few months, I was miserable at Everett. <b>But</b> <b>being</b> bused to Everett {{turned out to be one}} of the best things that ever {{happened}} to me. It got me out of my own little world and taught me how to understand white people, how to communicate and deal with them.|$|E

5|$|As to Captain Benbow, I {{know of no}} {{difference}} between him and me, nor have we had any. He has no small obligation to me, <b>but</b> <b>being</b> called {{in some of the}} foolish printed papers ‘the famous Captain Benbow’, I suppose has put him a little out of himself, and has made him play the fool, as I guess, in some of his letters. I will not farther now particularize this business, but time will show I have not been in the wrong, unless being too kind to an ungrateful man.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the last}} episode, Wirt and Greg wake up in a hospital, with Greg telling a story <b>but</b> <b>being</b> cut off before we can hear what it's about. As the scene ends, Greg's frog begins to glow, due to having eaten a magic bell in The Unknown, {{suggesting}} that there was at least some physical aspect to the story. The series ends with a slow montage of how Wirt and Greg affected the inhabitants of the Unknown.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{low number}} of subfossil finds, Hadropithecus {{is thought to have}} been rare, and it died out sooner than its sister taxon, Archaeolemur. Both {{disappeared}} shortly after the arrival of humans to the island, <b>but</b> <b>being</b> a large, specialized, terrestrial grazer, Hadropithecus would have faced more pressure from domestic livestock, introduced pigs, and spreading human populations than its more generalized cousin. The last known record was radiocarbon dated to around 444–772 CE.|$|E

5|$|In Winter of the Fisher, Cameron Langford relates {{a fictional}} {{encounter}} between a fisher and an aging recluse {{living in the}} forest. The recluse frees the fisher from a trap and nurses it back to health. The fisher tolerates the attention, <b>but</b> <b>being</b> a wild animal, returns to the forest when well enough. Langford uses the ecology and known habits of the fisher to weave a tale of survival and tolerance in the northern woods of Canada.|$|E
5|$|It {{soon became}} evident that Wong's career would {{continue}} to be limited by American anti-miscegenation laws, which prevented her from sharing an on-screen kiss with any person of another race, even if the character was Asian, <b>but</b> <b>being</b> portrayed by a white actor. The only leading Asian man in U.S. films in the silent era was Sessue Hayakawa. Unless Asian leading men could be found, Wong could not be a leading lady.|$|E
5|$|The {{attack of}} Alexios's {{division}} initially caught Bryennios's men off guard, <b>but,</b> <b>being</b> veteran troops, they soon recovered {{and once again}} began to push it back. Retreating, Alexios's troops, and especially the Turks, employed skirmishing tactics, attacking the enemy line and then withdrawing swiftly, thus keeping their opponents at bay and weakening the coherence of their line. Some among Alexios's men chose to attack Bryennios, and the rebel general had to defend against several attacks himself.|$|E

5|$|The {{book was}} {{noted for its}} heft, {{in terms of its}} actual page numbers, {{exhaustive}} research, and dense academic language. The writing does occasionally include illustrative anecdotes and some plain language. Rifkin synthesizes research and material from fields such as literature and the arts, theology, philosophy, anthropology, sociology, political science, psychology, and communication theory. The book was described as sociobiology. The Empathic Civilization was contrasted to the book Crisis Economics by Nouriel Roubini and Stephen Mihm, as reaching different conclusions <b>but</b> <b>being</b> complementary by offering valid alternative futures different from contemporary belief in social progress.|$|E

Drake intercepted the French the following day, <b>but</b> <b>being</b> hopelessly out-numbered retired to Barbados. He arrived on 3June, and Rodney immediately put to sea {{with the entire}} fleet. The British reached Tobago the following day, only to learn it had surrendered two days previously.|$|E
5|$|After {{designing}} {{their own}} pro skateboard, the protagonist and Eric {{embark on a}} team trip to Moscow, Russia, where they reconcile. However, Eric gets drunk and joyrides in a Russian military tank. The protagonist hops in and attempts to stop the tank, <b>but</b> <b>being</b> unfamiliar with the controls, fails to stop it from crashing. Eric jumps out and runs away, leaving the protagonist, trapped inside, to be arrested by the Russian military. Eric then lies and claims the protagonist stole the tank, stating that he in fact tried to stop them. Unwilling to pay the $700,000 worth of damages, Todd kicks the protagonist off the team, much to Eric's delight. The American Embassy bails out the protagonist, leaving them to do favors for locals in order to return home to New Jersey.|$|E

5|$|From the mid-20th century, {{the docks}} {{declined}} in use and were finally closed in 1980, {{leading to the}} setting up of the London Docklands Development Corporation in 1981. London's main port is now at Tilbury, further down the Thames estuary, outside the boundary of Greater London. The dock had been established in 1886 to bring bulk goods by rail to London, <b>but</b> <b>being</b> nearer the sea and able to accommodate vessels of 50,000tons, they were more easily converted {{to the needs of}} modern container ships in 1968, and so they survived the closure of the inner docks. Various wharves along the river continue to be in use but on a much smaller scale.|$|E
5|$|Narayan was {{commissioned}} {{by the government of}} Karnataka to write a book to promote tourism in the state. The work was published {{as part of a larger}} government publication in the late 1970s. He thought it deserved better, and republished it as The Emerald Route (Indian Thought Publications, 1980). The book contains his personal perspective on the local history and heritage, <b>but</b> <b>being</b> bereft of his characters and creations, it misses his enjoyable narrative. The same year, he was elected as an honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and won the AC Benson Medal from the Royal Society of Literature. Around the same time, Narayan's works were translated to Chinese for the first time.|$|E
5|$|One {{reason for}} the mission's success was that it worked by example. Also {{important}} was Gregory's flexibility and willingness to allow the missionaries to adjust their liturgies and behaviour. Another reason was the willingness of Æthelberht to be baptised by a non-Frank. The king would have been wary of allowing the Frankish bishop Liudhard to convert him, as that might open Kent up to Frankish claims of overlordship. <b>But</b> <b>being</b> converted by {{an agent of the}} distant Roman pontiff was not only safer, it allowed the added prestige of accepting baptism from the central source of the Latin Church. As the Roman Church was considered part of the Roman Empire in Constantinople, this also would gain Æthelberht acknowledgement from the emperor. Other historians have attributed the success of the mission to the substantial resources Gregory invested in its success; he sent over forty missionaries in the first group, with more joining them later, a quite significant number.|$|E

5|$|The RAF {{high command}} never warmed to missiles, and always ranked them {{secondary}} to the V-bomber force. The missile bases were separate {{from the rest of}} the RAF and its personnel considered outside the mainstream. Project Emily gave the RAF considerable experience in missile operations, but the cancellation of Blue Streak on 2 February 1960 in favour of Skybolt, an air-launched ballistic missile, rendered this expertise of dubious value. Given the amount of time and money spent on Thor, consideration was given to extending the deployment. Responding to the arguments made for and against Blue Streak, there were proposals for improving Thor. If the missiles were already fuelled, then they could be launched in as little as 60 seconds, but they could only remain fuelled for two hours, after which components froze from contact with the liquid oxygen. The missiles then needed six hours to thaw out. It was impractical to base them underground, <b>but</b> <b>being</b> above ground made them very vulnerable to a nuclear attack. Yet the twenty Thor missiles squadrons were equivalent to seven and a half squadrons of V-bombers. Without them, there would be just fourteen V-bombers on quick alert.|$|E
5|$|The heavy Ottoman fire forced Canopus and Swiftsure to {{withdraw}} from their bombardment position, though this placed them in range of the guns at Erenköy as well, while those at Dardanus could still engage them. Cornwallis, having silenced the guns at Intepe, started shelling Erenköy, while Canopus and Swiftsure kept their fire on Dardanus. The Ottomans repeatedly straddled the three battleships, <b>but</b> <b>being</b> further out in the strait, they had more room to manoeuvre and so avoided any direct hits. By 16:40, the guns at Dardanus fell silent, allowing all three ships to concentrate their fire at Erenköy, where the batteries were quickly neutralised. The three ships then withdrew, seemingly having achieved their objective, though that night, when destroyers and minesweepers tried to clear the minefields blocking the straits, they were met with very heavy fire and were forced {{to withdraw}}. During the third landings on 4 March 1915, she demonstrated off the Aegean coast to keep Ottoman ground forces tied down.|$|E
5|$|Bart {{learns that}} the couple {{have lost their jobs}} and feels remorseful. After Seymour apologizes to Bart for {{embarrassing}} him, Bart encourages the former principal to stand up for himself and Edna. Agreeing to Bart's comment, Seymour and Edna lock down the school, call the media (with Bart's help) and make their demands: They want their jobs back and the townspeople to not interfere with their relationship. However, several residents reply with their accusation about the two having sexual intercourse in the janitor's closet described by their children. Seymour insists nothing of the sort happened and that he is a virgin. At first, everyone is speechless, <b>but</b> <b>being</b> on the basis of being such an embarrassing thing for someone his age to admit, they {{think it has to be}} true. Realizing that they have overreacted over the relationship, the residents peacefully leave, believing that no one would pretend to be a 44-year-old virgin. Chalmers agrees to reinstate Seymour and Edna as though nothing ever happened, but insists that they keep their relationship at a minimum level during school days. The couple decide to continue their relationship more privately than ever by convincing Bart that they have broken up after thanking him for helping them. They then go back into their relationship and enter the janitor's closet where they presumably have sex.|$|E
