40|$|Context In peri-urban environments, high {{availability}} of anthropogenic resources {{may result in}} relatively high abundances of some species, with potentially negative implications for other native biota. Effective management of such impacts requires understanding of the spatial ecology of problem species. However, home range and habitat use have not been described for the little raven (Corvus mellori), a superabundant native predator that occurs in urban and natural habitats, including those where threatened shorebirds <b>breed.</b> <b>Aims</b> The {{aim of this study}} was to provide basic information on little raven home range, habitat use and movements in a coastal peri-urban landscape. Methods Between October 2011 and January 2012 we radio-tracked 20 little ravens captured in a coastal wetland (near Melbourne, Australia). Key results Little ravens were highly mobile, moving up to 9. 9 km in an hour (median≤ 2 km), and had large ranges: Minimum Convex Polygons were 1664 - 9989 ha (median≤ 3362 ha). Although most birds used both anthropogenic and natural habitats, some birds strongly selected for coastal wetland habitat. Birds used multiple roosts during the study period, most of which occurred in grassland (58. 7 %) or urban (22. 3 %) areas. Movement of up to 8. 3 km (median≤ 2. 2 km) between roosts during the night was also detected. Conclusions Ravens were highly mobile and used large home ranges and a variety of habitats, with habitat preferences varying between birds. Implications Considering the large home ranges and inter-individual variation in habitat preferences of little raven populations, localised management to reduce their impacts on breeding shorebirds is unlikely to be successful.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{some aspects of}} breeding management in the Italian Heavy Draught Horse <b>breed,</b> <b>aiming</b> at improving its efficiency at stud farm level. A first aim was to evaluate the risk of unsuccessful reproduction in mares after an early (3 years) or normal (4 years) age at first foaling, in interaction with different stud rearing systems. A second objective was {{the examination of the}} mean time length in which young 2 -year-old stallions maintain a genetic superiority on older proven stallions, identifying a ‘genetic lifespan’ in which young stallions can be safely used for reducing the cost of services. Reproductive performance at first and second foaling of 1513 mares were used. Mares had a normal first foal at 3 (n 5745) or 4 years of age (n 5768) in stud farms on the basis of stable (n 5488), feral (n 5345) or semi-feral (n 5680) rearing systems. Logistic regression analysis was performed by modeling the risk of unsuccessful reproduction in the subsequent season (i. e., results at second foaling), as affected by the interaction of age at first foaling 3 rearing system (six classes). Genetic lifespan of young stallions was estimated by regressing the least square means from a mixed model analysis for repeated measures of individual differences in ‘total merit’ estimated breeding values (EBVs) between young stallions (mean no. of 45 /year) and the mean EBV of all proven stallions in a given year of genetic evaluation (mean no. of 483 /year). Young stallions born between 1999 and 2005 were used, following each generation (i. e., birth year) from 2 to 7 subsequent yearly genetic evaluations.

40|$|Determining the urea {{concentration}} in milk {{is a useful}} indicator of the nutritional protein status of the organism {{as well as of}} the ratio between the energy and the protein in ruminant rations, with increasing practical usage. In addition to nutrition, milk urea concentration is influenced by a whole range of factors, for example: breed, stage and number of lactations, body weight, daily production and chemical composition of milk, somatic cell count, season and milking. The objective of this research was to determine the impact of the cow breed (Holstein and Simmental), the number of lactation (1 st, 2 nd, 3 rd, 4 th, 5 th), milking time (morning-evening) and season (spring-summer and autumn-winter) on milk urea concentration. The following was determined for each breed: daily milk yield, milk fat, protein and lactose content, urea concentration and somatic cell count in milk. Statistical data processing was carried out by applying General Linear Model procedure, SAS system (1999). The cow breed had a significant influence on daily milk yield and log somatic cell count (P< 0. 001), lactose content in milk (P< 0. 01), milk fat content and milk urea concentration (P< 0. 05). The number of lactations significantly influenced daily milk yield (P< 0. 001), protein content (P< 0. 001 and P< 0. 01) and milk urea concentration, but only for Holstein breed (P< 0. 05). Milking time significantly influenced the fat and protein content (P< 0. 001) in the milk of Holstein cows, that is, lactose content (P< 0. 05) and urea concentration (P< 0. 05) in the milk of Simmental cows. The season significantly influenced the fat and protein content of milk (P< 0. 001), that is, urea concentration and log somatic cell count (P< 0. 01).
