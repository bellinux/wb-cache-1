It turns {{out that there are}} many Hilbert spaces which allow this, and they should be called Taylor spaces. They have certain reproduc-ing kernels which are either polynomials or power series with nonnegative coecients. Consequently, Taylor spaces can be spanned by translates of various classical special functions such as exponentials, rationals, hyperbolic cosines, logarithms, and Bessel functions. Since the theory of kernelbased interpolation and approximation is wellestablished, this leads to a variety of results. In particular, interpolation by shifted exponentials, rationals, hyperbolic cosines, logarithms, and Bessel functions provides exponentially convergent approximations to analytic functions, generalizung the classical <b>Bernstein</b> <b>theorem</b> for polynomial approximation to analytic functions...|$|R
