The priority problems identified was low household income. Community Based Beekeeping project was designed {{with the objective of}} diversifying community income from the agriculture which was found to be the main economic activity. JIENDELEZE group was formed to pioneer Community Based Beekeeping initiative in the village and the village government agreed for beekeeping to be practiced in the village land forest reserve. The project implementation resulted into formation of the JIENDELEZE group which is pioneering the project with expectation that more villagers will join. Group members were trained in modern beekeeping and group management. Twenty bee hives were mobilized and strategically set in the village land forest reserve. However, beekeeping working gears such as <b>bee</b> <b>veil,</b> gloves, boots etc were not secured and group members were encouraged to continue raising funds to procure such items as they are important particularly starts small grant has been requested from WWF to support the development of the beekeeping activities in the villages. It is expected that WWF will support it as it has a great interest with the conservation of the coastal forests in Tanzania and already WWF is collaborating with villages in conservation of the forest. It is recommended that JIENDELEZE group should continue implementing the project in a self reliance manner and use the funds accrued from the project to expand the project to sustainable levels. The district council should continue providing guidance to the group and ensure that the group project remains sustainable so that other villagers can learn from the group...|$|E

The very idea of bee people seemed rather ludicrous {{within the scope of}} the fairy tale setting, but 'Beeware' overcome a terrible pun in its title to not only come up with the best and tightest episode of the show yet, but expand the larger mythology {{in such a way that}} set up some bigger arcs for the rest of the season." ...|$|R
