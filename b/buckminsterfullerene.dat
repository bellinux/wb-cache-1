5|$|Richard E. Smalley, {{a chemist}} at Rice University, {{was best known}} as a co-discoverer of the C60 form of carbon known as buckminsterfullerine in 1985, along with Harry Kroto, Robert Curl, James Heath, and Sean O'Brien. <b>Buckminsterfullerene</b> was the first to be {{discovered}} of the class of molecules known as fullerenes, which also includes carbon nanotubes. The study and application of fullerenes forms {{a significant part of the}} fields of nanomaterials and nanoelectronics, and Smalley, Kroto, and Curl were awarded the 1996 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their discovery.|$|E
5|$|The Drexler–Smalley {{debate on}} {{molecular}} nanotechnology {{was a public}} dispute between K. Eric Drexler, the originator of the conceptual basis of molecular nanotechnology, and Richard Smalley, a recipient of the 1996 Nobel prize in Chemistry for {{the discovery of the}} nanomaterial <b>buckminsterfullerene.</b> The dispute was about the feasibility of constructing molecular assemblers, which are molecular machines which could robotically assemble molecular materials and devices by manipulating individual atoms or molecules. The concept of molecular assemblers was central to Drexler's conception of molecular nanotechnology, but Smalley argued that fundamental physical principles would prevent them from ever being possible. The two also traded accusations that the other's conception of nanotechnology was harmful to public perception of the field and threatened continued public support for nanotechnology research.|$|E

50|$|Wilkinson {{was then}} awarded the prestigious SERC-NATO post-doctoral {{fellowship}} {{to work with}} the Nobel Prize-winning Professor George Olah in Los Angeles, California, (1991-1992), where he worked on, among other things, natural products chemistry, organic chemistry and <b>Buckminsterfullerenes.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>Buckminsterfullerene</b> {{derives from}} {{the name of the}} noted {{futurist}} and inventor Buckminster Fuller. One of his designs of a geodesic dome structure bears great resemblance to C60; as a result, the discoverers of the allotrope named the newfound molecule after him. The general public, however, sometimes refers to <b>buckminsterfullerene,</b> and even Fuller's dome structure, as buckyballs.|$|E
25|$|An allotrope of carbon, fullerene—and a {{particular}} molecule of that allotrope C60 (<b>buckminsterfullerene</b> or buckyball) {{has been named}} after him. The <b>Buckminsterfullerene</b> molecule, which consists of 60 carbon atoms, very closely resembles a spherical version of Fuller's geodesic dome. The 1996 Nobel prize in chemistry was given to Kroto, Curl, and Smalley for their discovery of the fullerene.|$|E

5000|$|Physicist-turned-artist Julian Voss-Andreae {{has created}} several sculptures symbolizing wave-particle duality in <b>Buckminsterfullerenes.</b> Voss-Andreae participated in {{research}} demonstrating that even objects {{as large as}} <b>Buckminsterfullerenes</b> obey the peculiar laws of quantum physics. After this, Voss-Andreae changed careers to become a full-time artist. Since then he has created objects such as a 2' (60 cm) diameter bronze structure called [...] "Quantum Buckyball" [...] (2004) consisting of four nested buckyballs. His largest fullerene-based sculpture {{is located in a}} private Park in Portland, Oregon (USA). [...] "Quantum Reality (Large Buckyball Around Trees)" [...] (2007) is a 30' (9 m) diameter steel structure intersected by several trees that grow freely through the structure and support it in mid-air, just above arm's reach.|$|R
5000|$|Mackay {{has been}} {{interested}} in a generalized crystallography, which can describe not only crystals, but more complex structures and nanomaterials. He has applied his ideas of minimal surfaces to graphitic materials, proposing, with Humberto Terrones, periodic arrangements of carbon atoms with negative Gaussian curvature known as Schwarzites, which are the periodic cousins of <b>Buckminsterfullerenes</b> ...|$|R
50|$|Each {{cluster is}} about 6 {{nanometers}} wide {{and consists of}} about 4000 carbon atoms linked in graphite-like sheets that are given negative curvature by the inclusion of heptagons among the regular hexagonal pattern. This {{is the opposite of}} what happens in the case of <b>buckminsterfullerenes,</b> in which carbon sheets are given positive curvature by the inclusion of pentagons.|$|R
25|$|<b>Buckminsterfullerene</b> {{is one of}} {{the largest}} objects to have been shown to exhibit wave–particle duality; as stated in the theory every object {{exhibits}} this behavior.|$|E

25|$|After nearly 100 {{years since}} they were first observed, the <b>Buckminsterfullerene</b> ion, C60+, was {{unequivocally}} assigned as the carrier of two diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs). The paper by E.K. Campbell, M. Holz, D. Gerlich and J.P. Maier was published on August 16, 2015.|$|E
25|$|A {{fullerene}} is {{a molecule}} of carbon {{in the form}} of a hollow sphere, ellipsoid, tube, and many other shapes. Spherical fullerenes, also referred to as <b>Buckminsterfullerenes</b> or buckyballs, resemble the balls used in association football. Cylindrical fullerenes are also called carbon nanotubes (buckytubes). Fullerenes are similar in structure to graphite, which is composed of stacked graphene sheets of linked hexagonal rings. Unless they are cylindrical, they must also contain pentagonal (or sometimes heptagonal) rings.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>buckminsterfullerenes,</b> or {{usually just}} fullerenes or buckyballs for short, were {{discovered}} in 1985 {{by a team of}} scientists from Rice University and the University of Sussex, three of whom were awarded the 1996 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. They are named for the resemblance of their allotropic structure to the geodesic structures devised by the scientist and architect Richard Buckminster [...] "Bucky" [...] Fuller. Fullerenes are molecules of varying sizes composed entirely of carbon, which {{take the form of a}} hollow sphere, ellipsoid, or tube.|$|R
40|$|Buckybowls are {{polynuclear}} aromatic hydrocarbons {{that have a}} curved aromatic surface and are considered fragments of <b>buckminsterfullerenes.</b> The curved aromatic surface led {{to the loss of}} planar symmetry of the normal aromatic plane and may cause unique inherent chirality, so-called bowl chirality, which it is possible to thermally racemize through a bowl-to-bowl inversion process. In this short review, we summarize the studies concerning the special field of bowl chirality, focusing on recent practical aspects of attaining diastereo/enantioenriched chiral buckybowls through asymmetric synthesis, chiral optical resolution, selective chiral metal complexation, and chiral assembly formation...|$|R
25|$|<b>Buckminsterfullerene</b> is the {{smallest}} fullerene molecule containing pentagonal and hexagonal rings in which no two pentagons share an edge (which can be destabilizing, as in pentalene). It is also most common in terms of natural occurrence, as it can often be found in soot.|$|E
25|$|<b>Buckminster{{fullerene}}</b> (or bucky-ball) is a spherical fullerene molecule {{with the}} formula C60. It has a cage-like fused-ring structure (truncated icosahedron) which resembles {{a soccer ball}} (football), made of twenty hexagons and twelve pentagons, with a carbon atom at each vertex of each polygon and a bond along each polygon edge.|$|E
25|$|In solid <b>buckminsterfullerene,</b> the {{molecules}} C60 stick together via the van der Waals {{forces in the}} fcc (face-centered cubic) motif. At low temperatures the individual molecules are locked against rotation. Upon heating, they start rotating at about −20°C. This results in a first-order phase transition to a fcc structure and a small, yet abrupt increase in the lattice constant from 1.411 to 1.4154nm.|$|E
25|$|Nanomolecules can {{be created}} from {{virtually}} any element, but the majority produced in today's industry use carbon as the basis upon which the molecules are built around. Carbon can bond with nearly any element, allowing many possibilities {{when it comes to}} creating a specific molecule. Scientists can create thousands upon thousands of individual nanomolecules from a simple carbon basis. Some of the most famous nanomolecules currently in existence are solely carbon; these include carbon nanotubes and <b>buckminsterfullerenes.</b> In contrast with nanomolecules, the chemical components of nanoparticles usually consist of metals, such as iron, gold, silver, and platinum.|$|R
5000|$|A {{method for}} making {{macroscopic}} quantities of C60 and {{the confirmation of}} the hollow, cagelike structures was published in 1990 by Kratschmer and co-workers. This {{was followed by the}} publication of methods for higher fullerenes (C70 and higher). In 1993, scientists discovered how to make a compound which is not as susceptible to moisture and air. They made containers to hold <b>buckminsterfullerenes,</b> or buckyballs; therefore they nicknamed the containers ‘buckyjars’. [...] A few US patents were issued to universities in the mid-1990s; experiments with manufacturing techniques have continued at universities around the globe, including India, Japan, and Sweden.|$|R
25|$|Dust and {{molecules}} in {{the interstellar medium}} not only obscures photometry, but also causes absorption lines in spectroscopy. Their spectral features are generated by transitions of component electrons between different energy levels, or by rotational or vibrational spectra. Detection usually occurs in radio, microwave, or infrared portions of the spectrum. The chemical reactions that form these molecules can happen in cold, diffuse clouds or in the hot ejecta around a white dwarf star from a nova or supernova. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as acetylene (C2H2) generally group together to form graphites or other sooty material, but other organic molecules such as acetone ((CH3)2CO) and <b>buckminsterfullerenes</b> (C60 and C70) have been discovered.|$|R
25|$|Robert Floyd Curl Jr. (born August 23, 1933) is a University Professor Emeritus, Pitzer–Schlumberger Professor of Natural Sciences Emeritus, and Professor of Chemistry Emeritus at Rice University. He {{was awarded}} the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1996 for the {{discovery}} of the nanomaterial <b>buckminsterfullerene,</b> along with Richard Smalley (also of Rice University) and Harold Kroto of the University of Sussex.|$|E
25|$|The {{experimental}} evidence, {{a strong}} peak at 720 atomic mass units, {{indicated that a}} carbon molecule with 60 carbon atoms was forming, but provided no structural information. The research group concluded after reactivity experiments, that the most likely structure was a spheroidal molecule. The idea was quickly rationalized {{as the basis of}} an icosahedral symmetry closed cage structure. Kroto mentioned geodesic dome structures of the noted futurist and inventor Buckminster Fuller as influences in the naming of this particular substance as <b>buckminsterfullerene.</b>|$|E
25|$|Fullerenes are {{sparingly}} soluble in many solvents. Common solvents for the fullerenes include aromatics, such as toluene, {{and others like}} carbon disulfide. Solutions of pure <b>buckminsterfullerene</b> have a deep purple color. Solutions of C70 are a reddish brown. The higher fullerenes C76 to C84 {{have a variety of}} colors. C76 has two optical forms, while other higher fullerenes have several structural isomers. Fullerenes are the only known allotrope of carbon that can be dissolved in common solvents at room temperature.|$|E
50|$|Nanomachines {{are largely}} in the {{research}} and development phase, but some primitive molecular machines and nanomotors have been tested. An example is a sensor having a switch approximately 1.5 nanometers across, able to count specific molecules in a chemical sample. The first useful applications of nanomachines may be in nanomedicine. For example, biological machines could be used to identify and destroy cancer cells. Another potential application is the detection of toxic chemicals, and the measurement of their concentrations, in the environment. Rice University has demonstrated a single-molecule car developed by a chemical process and including <b>Buckminsterfullerenes</b> (buckyballs) for wheels. It is actuated by controlling the environmental temperature and by positioning a scanning tunneling microscope tip.|$|R
30|$|Van der Waals (vdW) He 2 {{diatomic}} {{trapped inside}} <b>buckminsterfullerene’s</b> void and preserving its diatomic bonding {{is itself a}} controversial phenomenon due to the smallness of the void diameter comparing to the He-He equilibrium distance. We propound a computational approach, including smaller fullerenes, C 20 and C 28, to demonstrate that encapsulation of He 2 inside the studied fullerenes exhibits an interesting quantum behavior resulting in a binding at shorter, non-vdW internuclear distances, and we develop a computational model to interpret these He-He bonding patterns in terms of Bader’s atom-in-molecule theory. We also conjecture a computational existence of He 2 @C 60 on a solid basis of its theoretical UV absorption spectrum and a comparison with that of C 60.|$|R
40|$|<b>Buckminsterfullerenes</b> {{have been}} {{conjugated}} to CdSe nanocrystals by exchanging trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO) ligands on the CdSe nanocrystals with C- 60 -bound dithiocarbarnate ligands. To improve solubility of the C- 60 -capped CdSe nanocrystals, a small molecular weight dithiocarbarnate ligand {{was used as}} the coligand in the ligand-exchange reaction. The as synthesized (C- 60) (8) -CdSe conjugates were purified by dialysis against ethanol and characterized by H- 1 NMR, UV-vis, and transmission electron microscopy. Photoelectrochemistry of a film cast from the (C 60) 8 -CdSe conjugate revealed a significantly enhanced photocurrent compared with the film of CdSe-TOPO nanocrystals as well as that Of C 60 alone, suggesting that our conjugation strategy is viable for efficient photoinduced charge separation, transport, and collection...|$|R
25|$|The {{discovery}} of <b>buckminsterfullerene</b> caused Kroto to postpone {{his dream of}} setting up an art and graphic design studio – {{he had been doing}} graphics semi-professionally for years. However, Kroto's graphic design work resulted in numerous posters, letterheads, logos, book/journal covers, medal design, etc. He produced artwork after receiving graphic awards in the Sunday Times Book Jacket Design competition (1964) and the Moet Hennesy/Louis Vuitton Science pour l'Art Prize (1994). Other notable graphical works include the design of the Nobel UK Stamp for Chemistry (2001) and features at the Royal Academy (London) Summer Exhibition (2004).|$|E
25|$|Fullerenes {{and carbon}} nanotubes, carbon {{compounds}} with spheroidal and tubular structures, have stimulated much {{research into the}} related field of materials science. The first fullerene was discovered in 1985 by Sir Harold W. Kroto of the United Kingdom and by Richard E. Smalley and Robert F. Curl, Jr., of the United States. Using a laser to vaporize graphite rods {{in an atmosphere of}} helium gas, these chemists and their assistants obtained cagelike molecules composed of 60 carbon atoms (C60) joined together by single and double bonds to form a hollow sphere with 12 pentagonal and 20 hexagonal faces—a design that resembles a football, or soccer ball. In 1996 the trio was awarded the Nobel Prize for their pioneering efforts. The C60 molecule was named <b>buckminsterfullerene</b> (or, more simply, the buckyball) after the American architect R. Buckminster Fuller, whose geodesic dome is constructed on the same structural principles.|$|E
500|$|Fullerenes are a {{synthetic}} crystalline formation with a graphite-like structure, but {{in place of}} hexagons, fullerenes are formed of pentagons (or even heptagons) of carbon atoms. The missing (or additional) atoms warp the sheets into spheres, ellipses, or cylinders. The properties of fullerenes (split into buckyballs, buckytubes, and nanobuds) {{have not yet been}} fully analyzed and represent an intense area of research in nanomaterials. The names [...] "fullerene" [...] and [...] "buckyball" [...] are given after Richard Buckminster Fuller, popularizer of geodesic domes, which resemble the structure of fullerenes. The buckyballs are fairly large molecules formed completely of carbon bonded trigonally, forming spheroids (the best-known and simplest is the soccerball-shaped C <b>buckminsterfullerene).</b> Carbon nanotubes are structurally similar to buckyballs, except that each atom is bonded trigonally in a curved sheet that forms a hollow cylinder. Nanobuds were first reported in 2007 and are hybrid bucky tube/buckyball materials (buckyballs are covalently bonded to the outer wall of a nanotube) that combine the properties of both in a single structure.|$|E
40|$|C 60 carboxyfullerene {{is a novel}} buckminsterfullerene-derived {{compound}} that behaves as a free-radical scavenger. In the present report, we investigated whether this drug exerts a protective activity against oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. Human {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMCs) were challenged by 2 -deoxy-D-ribose (dRib) or TNF-alpha plus cycloheximide as agents that trigger apoptosis by interfering with the redox status of cell and mitochondrial membrane potential, We found that carboxyfullerene was able to protect quiescent PBMCs from apoptosis caused either by 8 -deoxy-D-ribose or TNF-alpha plus cycloheximide by a mechanism partially involving the mitochondrial membrane potential integrity, known to be associated with early stages of apoptosis. These results represent the first indication for a target activity of <b>buckminsterfullerenes</b> on cells of the immune system and their mitochondria. (C) 2000 Academic Press...|$|R
40|$|This article {{describes}} patterns of scientific growth that emerge {{in response to}} major research accomplishments in instrumentation and the discovery of new matter. Using two Nobel Prize-winning contributions, the scanning tunneling microscope (STM) and the discovery of <b>Buckminsterfullerenes</b> (BUF), we examine the growth of follow-up research via citation networks at the author and subdiscipline level. A longitudinal network analysis suggests that structure, cohesiveness, and interdisciplinarity vary considerably {{with the type of}} breakthrough and over time. Scientific progress appears to be multifaceted, including not only theoretical advances but also the discovery of new instrumentation and new matter. In addition, we argue that scientific growth does not necessarily lead to the formation of new specialties or new subdisciplines. Rather, we observe the emergence of a research community formed at the intersection of subdisciplinary boundaries...|$|R
50|$|Tailoring the {{graphite}} {{sheet to}} obtain well defined nanometer-sized objects remains a challenge. However, {{by the close}} of the twentieth century, chemists were exploring methods to fabricate extremely small graphitic objects that could be considered single molecules. After studying the interstellar conditions under which carbon is known to form clusters, Richard Smalley's group (Rice University, Texas) set up an experiment in which graphite was vaporized via laser irradiation. Mass spectrometry revealed that clusters containing specific magic numbers of atoms were stable, especially those clusters of 60 atoms. Harry Kroto, an English chemist who assisted in the experiment, suggested a possible geometry for these clusters - atoms covalently bound with the exact symmetry of a soccer ball. Coined <b>buckminsterfullerenes,</b> buckyballs, or C60, the clusters retained some properties of graphite, such as conductivity. These objects were rapidly envisioned as possible building blocks for molecular electronics.|$|R
