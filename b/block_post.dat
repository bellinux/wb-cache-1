50|$|Niederschlottwitz was {{reclassified}} in 1999 {{after the}} extension of the second station track as a halt with <b>block</b> <b>post.</b> The elevated signal box served until the 2002 flood to protect the signal block and the neighbouring level crossing. The <b>block</b> <b>post</b> was not re-established after the flood and an automatic system is now used to secure the line.|$|E
50|$|Seddon {{railway station}} {{is located on}} the Werribee and Williamstown lines in Victoria, Australia. It serves the western Melbourne suburb of Seddon, opening on 10 December 1906, as a double line <b>block</b> <b>post</b> with a signal box, for the control of trains in the section from Footscray to Yarraville stations. The <b>block</b> <b>post</b> closed in 1912, but {{automatic}} signalling was not provided on the section until 1927.|$|E

50|$|The {{line was}} worked by train staff and ticket; the <b>block</b> <b>posts</b> intermediately were Scotsgap and Woodburn. The system was {{converted}} to electric train token in 1890 - 1891.|$|R

50|$|In December 2006, chair Pamela Taylor and {{executive}} director Ani Zonneveld resigned from the board, citing unreconcilable conflicts with board member Tarek Fatah. Soon after, Fatah, who controls PMU's e-mail discussion list, <b>blocked</b> <b>posting</b> by list members.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} years of the railway, block posts were local signal boxes manned with <b>block</b> <b>post</b> keepers. Today there are only a few of these classic, railway staff-operated block posts. Their {{function}} has been largely superseded by equipment that forms part of an automatic block signalling (Selbsttätigen Streckenblocks or Sbk) system or by a central <b>block</b> <b>post</b> in a station signal box at one end of the section between two stations.|$|E
50|$|The station {{opened with}} the line, {{and was a}} signal box and <b>block</b> <b>post,</b> using the {{telegraph}} instruments by 1879, with Winters instruments provided by 1890. A six lever frame was provided in 1927, for control of signals, until closed as a <b>block</b> <b>post</b> in 1993. The station was renamed Riddell in 1904, {{as part of a}} policy to adopt short station names, but was renamed to the full version in October 1976.|$|E
50|$|The {{signal box}} at Drouin was closed in February 1988, with the <b>block</b> <b>post</b> abolished, all fixed signals covered and lights extinguished. The {{interlocked}} signal frame was also abolished.|$|E
50|$|It was at Ridgmont {{that a new}} Marston Vale {{signalling}} {{control centre}} was built {{as part of the}} Bedford — Bletchley route modernisation in 2004. This centre replaced all the signal boxes and <b>block</b> <b>posts</b> (some contained within station buildings including Ridgmont) on the route.|$|R
50|$|This {{led to a}} {{proposal}} for the MDR to extend from Wimbledon to Sutton, and to quadruple the Putney to Wimbledon section which was already suffering from congestion. The idea was eventually dropped, but intermediate <b>block</b> <b>posts</b> were provided between Putney and Wimbledon to reduce section time and increase capacity.|$|R

50|$|Buckfastleigh had a {{crossing}} loop, but {{the loop}} line was for goods trains only {{and was not}} a running line. Staverton was an intermediate <b>block</b> <b>post</b> but not a staff station.|$|E

50|$|In Germany <b>block</b> <b>posts</b> {{are known}} as Blockstellen (abbreviation: Bk) and are defined as railway {{facilities}} on the open line that, {{as part of a}} block system, mark the end of a block section. They usually have a home signal in each direction and on each running line. They are mainly found where the distance between two railway stations is greater than average.|$|R
50|$|Originally, {{the railway}} had <b>block</b> <b>posts</b> at Faslane Yard, Shandon L.C., Belmore L.C. and Faslane Bay. The points and {{semaphore}} signals at each location were worked from ground frames, {{with the exception}} of Belmore, where a signal box was built to house the lever frame (comprising 7 levers) and gate wheel. The three block sections were worked by the absolute block system.|$|R
5000|$|Welford Park; {{originally}} also siding {{accessed by}} ground frame; in 1909 upgraded with a 312-foot passing loop and second platform, and <b>block</b> <b>post</b> provided; the USAF branch line {{left at the}} Newbury end of the station and turned north-east ...|$|E
50|$|In September 1987, {{the signal}} box was abolished, {{along with the}} abolishment of all signals, except for one post, the disestablishment of the station as a <b>block</b> <b>post,</b> and all points spiked normal, which were removed at a later date.|$|E
50|$|The station, {{which had}} {{up and down}} platforms, with small station {{building}} on the up side, was closed by CIÉ in November 1947, but it remained a signalling <b>block</b> <b>post.</b> The signal cabin at Straffan was closed however in 1976, and after which the redundant station buildings became derelict before finally been demolished in the mid 1980s.|$|E

50|$|After its {{closure to}} {{passenger}} trains, the goods facilities at Tuam {{continued to be}} heavily used, as the route remained a significant one for freight. The carriage and locomotive sheds were also used by a group called Westrail. This was a railway preservation group that operated trains between Athenry, Tuam and Claremorris until 1993, when Tuam station was closed as a <b>block</b> <b>post.</b>|$|E
50|$|The station did {{not have}} a passing loop being only a <b>block</b> <b>post</b> {{splitting}} the line into two sections. It had a goods yard, signal box, goods shed, and a level crossing with gates. The signal box near the level crossing was replaced by a signal box located on the platform in 1915. The signal box was renamed Dousland from Dousland Barn.|$|E
50|$|A list of signals, dated around 1899, showed South Geelong {{having two}} home signals and two starters. In March 1900, the Staff and Ticket, between the {{sections}} Geelong - Queenscliff Junction - Mount Moriac, {{was replaced by}} electric staff. However, the station appeared to retain a <b>block</b> <b>post</b> between the station and Geelong, apparently so that trains can wait at the station, instead of at Queenscliff Junction.|$|E
5000|$|North {{once tried}} to stop other people named [...] "Ryan North" [...] from using his name {{in a series of}} satirical emails. North once got himself in trouble with {{authorities}} by sending prank emails. In 2006, a group of teenage girls in Ravenna, Ohio were arrested after they created and distributed several cardboard boxes designed to look like elements of the video game Super Mario Brothers, inspired by a street art project initiated by Poster Child and following instructions for building the <b>blocks</b> <b>posted</b> on North's website.|$|R
50|$|A {{simple system}} used {{separable}} train staffs which fit together when intermediate <b>block</b> <b>posts</b> are closed, {{so that a}} driver receives the train staff for two or more consecutive sections from the first signalman. An alternative system employs special long-section token systems; when long section working is to be instituted, all the short section tokens must be in their respective instruments; by switching to the long-section method, tokens for the long section can then be obtained in the ordinary way. Obviously all the long-section tokens must be restored before the normal working can be resumed.|$|R
