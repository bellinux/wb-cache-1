The hardware design has a <b>Finger</b> <b>print</b> scanning sensor which is used to compare the <b>finger</b> <b>print</b> of the user with the pre-stored <b>finger</b> <b>print</b> of the user. During voting, both the <b>finger</b> <b>prints</b> are checked for matching and if it does not match, then an alert is given using buzzer. Keypad is used for selecting the voting preferences. LCD is used to display the corresponding data for each key to the user. Thus, illegal voting cannot be done since <b>finger</b> <b>print</b> is unique for each person. The voting process is carried out only if the <b>finger</b> <b>print</b> matches with the stored value...|$|R

Once the <b>finger</b> <b>print</b> image is enhanced at the required level, the pores are extracted based on segmentation of the <b>finger</b> <b>print</b> image by eliminating the <b>finger</b> <b>print</b> area above a threshold limit. The pores location and then inter-distances are computed and stored in a data base.

40|$|Fingerprint {{recognition}} {{is the most}} widely used biometric system for human identification. The noise is one kind of feature which disturbs the real <b>finger</b> <b>print</b> pattern and makes the identification process is not efficient. Therefore we need to eliminate the noise, and recover the original <b>finger</b> <b>print</b> from noises. In order to recover the original <b>finger</b> <b>print,</b> <b>finger</b> <b>print</b> image needs to be pre-processed. Pre-processing is a method of eliminating or reducing the noise presents in the <b>finger</b> <b>prints.</b> There are various techniques pre processing such as binarization, normalization, thinning. Another technique of pre-processing is the use of various filters. These filters are efficient and are also available to reduce noise. Enhancing <b>Finger</b> <b>print</b> is the method of improving the quality of the image by increasing contrast, brightness, sharpness etc. <b>Finger</b> <b>Print</b> Image is enhanced using various filters such as mean and median filters. In order to avoid disadvantages of existing filters fuzzy filter is proposed in which the general idea behind the filter is to average a pixel using other pixel values from its neighbourhood, but simultaneously to take care of important image structures like edges. The key idea behind the proposed filter is to distinguish between local variations due to noise and due to image structure. To achieve this, derivative a value that expresses the degree in which the derivative in a certain direction is small is determined for each direction corresponding to the neighbouring pixels of the processed pixel by a fuzzy rule...|$|R

40|$|<b>Finger</b> <b>print</b> {{recognition}} and matching {{will play a}} very pivotal role in forensic investigations. In this paper, we propose a novel method for <b>finger</b> <b>print</b> recognition. Its basic idea {{is to use a}} course to fine strategy based on Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) feature. To recognize a test sample, our method contains the three main steps: the first step identifies a certain number of <b>finger</b> <b>prints</b> from training samples, depending on the Horizontal Matching key points. If first steps verified successfully, we perform vertical SIFT Matching based on vertical key points. If first and second methods get verified successfully then it moves on to the third step. Here it verifies the <b>finger</b> <b>prints</b> by Histogram matching method. The first two steps, our method succeeds in greatly reducing the computational complexity, and avoiding the interference of those samples that may cause error recognition to a certain extent. The third step enhances the robustness of our method. This approach uses three way matching method, hence it achieves 98. 9 % accuracy. Experiments on different <b>finger</b> <b>prints</b> from standard database confirms that our method obtain high recognition accuracy and has a good robustness...|$|R
