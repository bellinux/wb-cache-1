5|$|April 8 through April 10. The Feast of the Three Days of the Writing of the Book of the Law. These {{three days}} are {{commemorative}} {{of the three}} days in the year 1904 during which Aleister Crowley wrote the Book of the Law. One chapter was written each day, the first being written on April 8, the second on April 9, and the third on April 10. Although there is no official way of celebrating any Thelemic holiday, this particular feast day is usually celebrated <b>by</b> <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> corresponding chapter {{on each of the}} three days, usually at noon.|$|E

He also learned rudimentary English skills <b>by</b> <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> Bible and novels by Charles Dickens.|$|E
5|$|Although he was {{not part}} of Nintendo at the time, Iwata {{assisted}} in the development of Pokémon Gold and Silver, which were released for the Game Boy Color in November1999, by creating a set of compression tools utilized for graphics in the games. While working as a go-between for Game Freak and Nintendo, he aided in the programming of Pokémon Stadium for the Nintendo 64 <b>by</b> <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> original coding in Pokémon Red and Green and porting the battle system into the new game in just one week. According to Tsunekazu Ishihara, the president of The Pokemon Company, Iwata was instrumental in bringing Pokémon to Western markets. While being president of HAL, he developed the plan for localization after reviewing the code for Red/Green, which was then completed by Teruki Murakawa, with the Western releases coming two years after their Japanese release. Additionally, he assisted Masahiro Sakurai in the development of Super Smash Bros. for the Nintendo 64.|$|E

5|$|During the campaign, {{both parties}} made similar {{proposals}} to reduce authoritarianism {{and the political}} influence of the military, and to maintain the Argentine claim in the Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute. Alfonsín denounced a pact {{between the military and}} the Peronist unions that sought an amnesty for the military. He maintained that the armed forced should be subject to the civilian government, and that unions should be regulated. He also proposed an investigation into the actions of the military during the Dirty War. He closed his campaign <b>by</b> <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> preamble of the constitution of Argentina. The last rally was at the Plaza de la República, and was attended by 400,000 people.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{the stereotypical}} {{portrayal}} of television angels, Castiel {{does not always}} help people, {{and is willing to}} kill innocents if needed. Collins originally read for the part of a demon, as series creator Eric Kripke did not want fans to find out that angels were being introduced to the series. Collins prepared for the role <b>by</b> <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> Book of Revelation, and based his portrayal on his younger brother. Critics and fans have responded highly favorably to the character. In response, the show's creators expanded his role in the series, upgrading him to a main cast member in the fifth and sixth seasons. After being a special guest star in the seventh and eighth seasons, Collins was upgraded once again to regular cast member status for the ninth, tenth and eleventh seasons.|$|E
5|$|<b>By</b> <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> book, Gray {{learns that}} Léone {{is a victim}} of a Vampyr. Vampyrs can force humans into submission. The village doctor visits Léone at the manor, and Gray recognizes him as the old man he saw in the castle. The doctor tells Gray that a blood {{transfusion}} is needed and Gray offers his blood to save Léone. Exhausted from blood loss, Gray sleeps. He wakes sensing danger and rushes to Léone, where he surprises the doctor as he is attempting to poison the girl. The doctor flees the manor, and Gray finds that Gisèle is gone. Gray follows the doctor back to the castle, where Gray has a vision of himself being buried alive. After the vision subsides, he rescues Gisèle but the doctor escapes. The old servant of the manor finds Gray's Vampyr book and discovers that a Vampyr can be defeated by driving an iron bar through its heart. The servant meets Gray at Marguerite Chopin's grave behind the village Chapel. They open the grave and find the old woman perfectly preserved. They hammer a large metal bar through her heart, killing her. The village doctor is hiding in an old mill, but finds himself locked in a chamber where flour sacks are filled. The old servant arrives and activates the mill's machinery, filling the chamber with flour and suffocating the doctor. The curse of the Vampyr is lifted and Léone suddenly recovers. Gisèle and Gray cross a foggy river by boat and find themselves in a bright clearing.|$|E

5|$|Gupte {{described}} his character as mercurial, and found playing him a physical delight. Gupte said his character keeps the frame unpredictable {{and that it}} provided him with a foil to express rage and anguish. He worked a lot on his characterisation and tried to bring in his own references from European and Japanese cinema. Chandan Roy Sanyal {{described his}} character Mikhail as provocative, mad, wicked and humorous. Subramnayam and Joshi, who played Lobo and Lele respectively, described their characters as the most corrupt policemen in their department at the Anti-Narcotics Bureau. They said that {{to prepare for the}} roles they followed the script and Bhardwaj's instructions to get the characters right. Mukherjee prepared for his role as Mujeeb <b>by</b> <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> script and understanding the characters, and discussing it with Bhardwaj. Dutta, who played Shumona Bengali criminal involved in fixing horse races and arms dealingsaid {{that he did not have}} much time to prepare for his role because he was given the script after he arrived in Mumbai, where Bhardwaj briefed him.|$|E
5|$|The {{producers}} considered Danny Denzongpa for {{the role}} of bandit chief Gabbar Singh, but he could not accept it as he was committed to act in Feroz Khan's Dharmatma (1975), under production at the same time. Amjad Khan, who was the second choice, prepared himself for the part <b>by</b> <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> book Abhishapta Chambal, which told of the exploits of Chambal dacoits. The book was written by Taroon Kumar Bhaduri, the father of fellow cast member Jaya Bhaduri. As cast members had read the script ahead of time, many were interested in playing different parts. Pran was considered {{for the role}} of Thakur Baldev Singh, but Sippy thought Sanjeev Kumar was a better choice. Initially, Dharmendra was also interested {{to play the role of}} Thakur. He eventually gave up the role when Sippy informed him that Sanjeev Kumar would play Veeru if that happened, and would be paired with Hema Malini, who Dharmendra was trying to woo. Dharmendra knew that Kumar was also interested in Malini. Sippy wanted Shatrughan Sinha to play the part of Jai, but there were already several big stars signed, and Amitabh Bachchan, who was not extremely popular yet, lobbied hard to get the part for himself.|$|E

25|$|Director Cosmatos {{stated that}} he's {{interested}} in social control mechanisms, our own personal, internal controls and how religion affects our consciousness and society.

25|$|Third-generation {{sequencing}} (also {{known as}} long-read sequencing) is {{a class of}} DNA sequencing methods currently under active development. Third generation sequencing works <b>by</b> <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> nucleotide sequences at the single molecule level, in contrast to existing methods that require breaking long strands of DNA into small segments then inferring nucleotide sequences by amplification and synthesis. Critical challenges exist in the engineering of the necessary molecular instruments for whole genome sequencing to make the technology commercially available.|$|E

25|$|In some cases, {{adding more}} memory {{can help to}} make a program run faster. For example, a {{filtering}} program will commonly read each line and filter and output that line immediately. This only uses enough memory for one line, but performance is typically poor, due to the latency of each disk read. Performance can be greatly improved <b>by</b> <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> entire file then writing the filtered result, though this uses much more memory. Caching the result is similarly effective, though also requiring larger memory use.|$|E
