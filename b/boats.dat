5|$|Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino (STT) of Trieste was {{selected}} for the contract to build eight vessels, ahead of one other tenderer. Despite the specifications of the contract being {{very close to the}} requirements for the coastal torpedo boat, the STT <b>boats</b> were classified as sea-going. The STT <b>boats</b> used Parsons turbines driving two propeller shafts. Another tender was requested for four more <b>boats,</b> but when Ganz & Danubius reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen <b>boats</b> were ordered from them. These <b>boats</b> were powered by AEG-Curtiss turbines, and had two funnels rather than the single funnel of the STT <b>boats.</b> The third contract went to Cantiere Navale Triestino (CNT), who used Melms-Pfenniger turbines, and their <b>boats</b> also had two funnels. The <b>boats</b> of all three groups used steam generated by two Yarrow water-tube boilers, one of which burned fuel oil and the other coal.|$|E
5|$|The <b>boats</b> were begun {{late in the}} {{war when}} {{shortages}} of skilled shipyard workers and materials were slowing construction of other <b>boats</b> under construction. As a result, none of the first four <b>boats</b> was ever launched or completed {{before the end of}} the war. U-107 was 35% complete at war's end, while U-108 was only 30% complete, respectively. Ganz Danubius had also begun stockpiling materials for U-109 and U-110 but had not started on these two <b>boats.</b> Although there is no specific mention of the fates of the pair of incomplete <b>boats</b> of the U-107 class, incomplete <b>boats</b> from other late-war classes were scrapped 1919–1920.|$|E
5|$|After many <b>boats</b> were wrecked {{and several}} hundred people died, the North-West Mounted Police (NWMP) {{introduced}} safety rules, vetting the <b>boats</b> carefully and forbidding women and children to travel through the rapids. Additional rules stated that any boat carrying passengers required a licensed pilot, typically costing $25 ($680), although some prospectors simply unpacked their <b>boats</b> and let them drift unmanned through the rapids {{with the intent of}} walking down to collect them on the other side. During the summer, a horse-powered rail-tramway was built by Norman Macaulay, capable of carrying <b>boats</b> and equipment through the canyon at $25 ($680) a time, removing the need for prospectors to navigate the rapids.|$|E

T5–T8 comprised the 3rd Torpedo Division located at Šibenik. On 8 April, the four <b>boats</b> of the 3rd Torpedo Division, along with other vessels, were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of Zadar on the Dalmatia coast. They were subjected to three Italian air attacks and, after the last one, sailed from the area of Zaton into Lake Prokljan, where they remained until 11 April. On 12 April, the 3rd Torpedo Division arrived at Milna on the island of Brač, and refused to follow orders to sail to the Bay of Kotor.

There was no sign of the other <b>boats,</b> and Rockwell, in the same boat with Kelly, was far from convinced that Kelly had found the correct island.

In addition, the city was building 13 ferry landings at a cost of $85 million, as well as a boat depot. One of these docks, in Astoria, was built privately as part of the Astoria Cove development. In September 2016, construction on 19 ferries began at two shipyards in Bayou La Batre, Alabama, and Jeanerette, Louisiana, with 200 full-time employees working on the <b>boats.</b> The contract with the two shipyards is unusual because shipbuilding contracts are usually with only one company.
