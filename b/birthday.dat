5|$|Eeyore's <b>Birthday</b> Party {{began in}} 1963 as a spring party and picnic for Department of English {{students}} at the University of Texas at Austin by Lloyd W. Birdwell, Jr. and other UT students. It was named for Eeyore, a chronically depressed donkey in A. A. Milne's Winnie-the-Pooh stories who, in one story, believes his friends have forgotten his <b>birthday</b> only to discover they have planned a surprise party for him. Despite its name, the event does not fall on the official <b>birthday</b> of the fictional character. The original event featured a trashcan full of lemonade, beer, honey sandwiches, a live, flower-draped donkey, and a may pole (in keeping with the event's proximity to May Day). For many years the party was a UT tradition, but subsequently the annual <b>Birthday</b> Party became a tradition in Austin's hippie subculture.|$|E

Field Marshal Erhard Milch told Speer that similar donations were required out of the Air Ministry's general fund. For his <b>birthday</b> in 1940, Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano decorated Göring with the coveted Collar of Annunziata. The award reduced him to tears.|$|E

5|$|Analysis of {{the letter}} {{preference}} data revealed a name-letter effect: an enhanced liking for letters in the participant's own name. Analysis of the number preference data revealed a birthday-number effect. For each number, the researchers first calculated the mean liking by participants {{who did not have}} that number in their <b>birthday.</b> These means served as a baseline. For each participant 50 relative liking scores were computed between the baseline of a number and the actual preference. The mean liking scores for different types of numbers showed that participants disproportionately preferred numbers in their <b>birthday.</b> The effect was stronger for higher numbers, over 12, than for lower numbers. The effect was weakest for males and their birth month (only a 0.03 difference from the mean), and strongest for females and the day of their <b>birthday</b> (0.77 difference with the mean). Overall, women showed a greater liking for the numbers in their <b>birthday</b> than men did.|$|E

50|$|With the {{separation}} of the orders of succession, the Dutch and Luxembourgish thrones split in 1890. The Nassau-Weilburg monarchs celebrated their official <b>birthdays</b> on their actual <b>birthdays.</b> In 1947, the day was declared the 'national holiday'. As both the then-reigning Charlotte and the heir apparent (and regent) Jean were born in January, it was feared that their actual <b>birthdays,</b> therefore the nation's holiday, would be marred by poor weather. Thus, on 23 December 1961, the date was fixed on 23 June by Grand Ducal decree.|$|R
