40|$|Skin {{tumors are}} tumors arising from {{keratinocyte}} and from adnexal structures. Immunohistochemistry is {{very helpful in}} diagnosis of difficult cases in epithelial skin neoplasms, especially basal cell carcinoma (BCC) which <b>is</b> <b>positive</b> for BerEP 4, a keratin marker, and mostly negative for epithelial membrane antigen (EMA). Squamous cell carcinoma cells <b>are</b> <b>positive</b> for EMA and cytokeratin, which are of higher molecular weight than those found in BCC. In contrast to BCC, trichoblastoma and trichoepithelioma are negative for androgen receptors. Of the malignant dermal spindle cell lesions, spindle cell squamous carcinoma <b>is</b> <b>positive</b> to 34 betaE 12, desmoplasmic melanoma <b>is</b> <b>positive</b> to S 100, and leiomyosarcoma <b>is</b> <b>positive</b> to desmin. Of the malignant pagetoid cells, Paget′s disease <b>is</b> <b>positive</b> to CK 7 and cam 5. 2, whereas the pagetoid variant of Bowen′s disease <b>is</b> <b>positive</b> to CK 5 / 6. Melanoma in-situ <b>is</b> <b>positive</b> to both S 100 and melan-A. Immunohistochemistry is an extremely valuable adjunct to standard morphologic diagnosis in diagnostic pathology. Diagnosis of epithelial tumor depends largely on morphological features but, in rare cases, immunohistochemical stains are needed for definitive diagnosis...|$|R

5|$|Persona began {{development}} {{after the release}} of Shin Megami Tensei If..., with the idea of creating a subseries around the positively received high school setting of If.... Multiple staff members from previous Megami Tensei titles were involved in development, including character designer Kazuma Kaneko, and director Kouji Okada. Multiple aspects of the story, including Personas and the character Philemon, were taken from Jungian psychology, while Kaneko's character designs were based on both staff members, and celebrities and fictional characters of the time. Reception to the game has generally <b>been</b> <b>positive,</b> with most praising its approach to the genre, while its navigation and localization were criticized. Its PSP port shared most points of praise with the original, along with the improved localization, but also drew negative comments for its by-then dated mechanics and graphics.|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} aimed at searching for the {{presence}} of circulating antibodies against frozen sections of human testis, ovary and trophoblast in patients that had spermatic cord torsion. Sixty-eight sera samples were studied. Nine patients (13. 2 %) <b>were</b> <b>positive</b> for organ specific anti-testis autoantibodies. Six patients <b>were</b> <b>positive</b> for antibodies against Leydig cells: five <b>were</b> <b>positive</b> only with the indirect immunofluorescence technique of complement fixing (ITT/CF), the sixth patient <b>was</b> <b>positive</b> only with the indirect immunofluorescence technique (ITT).

Eight of these patients were negative for antibodies against adrenal cortex while only one case <b>was</b> <b>positive</b> with indirect immunofluorescence technique both on adrenal cortex and Leydig cells. Human lyophilized testis absorbed the reactive antibodies against Leydig cells and germ line cells, while adrenal cortex and lyophilized testosterone were ineffective.
