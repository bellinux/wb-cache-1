To {{investigate}} the seismic behavior of {{autoclaved aerated concrete}} (AAC) <b>roof</b> <b>panels,</b> the bending experiment of 4 AAC slabs for estimating the deflection and moment capacity was made. All specimens were placed under a test frame using monotonically increasing load till failure. The experimental {{results indicated that the}} stiffness and load-carrying capacity of AAC panels can meet the requirements of the <b>roof</b> <b>panel.</b> Reinforced AAC <b>roof</b> <b>panels,</b> which serve as a substitute for normal one can be used efficiently to provide a structure‟s horizontal diaphragm system while supporting the necessary gravity loads. The study in this paper can provide a reliable experimental basis for further analysis and engineering application of AAC <b>roof</b> <b>panels</b> in the future...|$|R

40|$|In {{the recent}} years, {{due to the}} {{enforcement}} of new EU normative, the interest of all the car manufacturers in producing light-weight vehicles is progressively increased as the combustion engine optimization has already used all improvement margins they had. Base on this auto industry interest, composite materials have absorbed lots of attention due to their superior characteristics. In this paper, a finite element model has been developed, starting from the available Toyota Yaris model, for evaluating the response of vehicle in case of full frontal crash and measuring the static stiffness and modal analysis of vehicle body with specific focus on <b>roof</b> <b>panel</b> material solutions. These analyses will help to have a broad view to compare the stiffness contribution of composite <b>roof</b> <b>panel</b> in crash analysis. The <b>roof</b> <b>panel</b> modeling is carried out in both explicit and implicit finite element code LS-DYNA (for crash and stiffness analyses respectively) with three material solutions of steel (that being the normal production solution {{will be used as}} the reference), aluminum and composite with the same thickness and modified thickness. MAT 24 "Piecewise Linear Plasticity" is applied to model the steel and aluminum <b>roof</b> <b>panels</b> and MAT 54 "Enhanced Composite Damage" along with the Chang-Chang and strain based failure criteria is utilized to model the composite <b>roof</b> <b>panels.</b> Results of crash analysis for the determined sections reveal that, although composite solutions have lower longitudinal deformations and energy absorption due to their lower compressive stiffness, performance are very close to the traditional solutions. Therefore, composite materials constitute an interesting solution in respect to mass reduction. Results of stiffness analysis reveal that composite <b>roof</b> <b>panels</b> have acceptable effect on the total body stiffness values and modal frequencies in comparison with the steel and aluminum ones and can be a good substitute for the traditional solution...|$|R

50|$|With the {{introduction}} {{and production of}} the latest 911, the Type 991, Porsche {{decided to take the}} latest Targa in a different direction from that of the previous water-cooled Type 996/997 cars. The latest Targa was introduced in 2014 and unlike the Type 993/996/997 Targas, the new car has somewhat returned to its earliest Targa roots by the utilizing of a solid <b>roof</b> <b>panel</b> spanning over the front seats. However unlike the manual lift-out panels of earlier 911s, the Type 991 Targa's <b>roof</b> <b>panel</b> is mechanized for automated lift-away and storage under the rear glass roof, which itself is mechanized to lift {{up and out of the}} way as the <b>roof</b> <b>panel</b> is placed into its stowed position. The Type 991 Targa also brings back the styling feature of the 'Targa bar' that was perhaps the most obvious and overt design cue of the air-cooled generation Targas. But unlike the previous Targa hoops, the one used on the Type 991 is in sections, where the horizontal span member is a physically separate piece that itself is mechanized to lift off of its vertical supports in order to allow the solid <b>roof</b> <b>panel</b> and its motorized components to slide rearwards as the panel is being stored within the car.|$|R

40|$|Vehicle {{crashworthiness}} {{refers to}} proper designing {{of the vehicle}} structure {{to reduce the risk}} of death and injury during the vehicle accidents. In the recent years, due to the enforcement of new EU normative, the interest of all the car manufacturers in producing lightweight vehicles is progressively increased as the combustion engine optimization has already used most of the improvements they had and the residual ones are becoming more and more difficult and costly. Based on this auto industry's interest, lightweight materials such as composite have absorbed lots of attention due to their superior characteristic of high stiffness to weight ratio. In this thesis, efforts have been made to present a broad research on the light-weight design of vehicle <b>roof</b> <b>panel</b> for stiffness and crash analyses. The first part of the analyses belongs to the vehicle chassis static and dynamic stiffness analyses via the finite element code with the specific focus on substituting the steel <b>roof</b> <b>panel</b> with the lightweight materials of aluminum and composites. The structural response of the vehicle <b>roof</b> <b>panel,</b> made of different solutions, in full frontal crash with respect to NHTSA standard has been investigated at the second step. The effects of increasing the vehicle <b>roof</b> <b>panel</b> thickness at the both steps have been tested and compared for different solutions. At the third step an innovative design solution for the vehicle roof structure has been developed and tested in rollover crash analysis. In order to perform this task, After determining the performance of tubes made of steel, composite and composite foam-filled solutions under the three points bending test and proving the efficiency of composite-foam design; the same idea is implemented on the vehicle <b>roof</b> <b>panel</b> during the <b>roof</b> quasi-static crush test. Besides the composite solutions, the sandwich design consists of composite face-sheets and foam core are tested in the roof crushing test based on the FMVSS 216 standard. After assessment of the sandwich <b>roof</b> <b>panel</b> in crushing test, the geometrical optimization of the foam core is implemented to determine the optimum design with respect to vehicle strength-to-weight ratio and mass reduction percentages. Besides different foam core configurations that have been tested, the final optimization have been implemented using the foam core with various densities and also the optimum face-sheets thickness has been determined. At the last chapter, challenges of vehicle composite <b>roof</b> <b>panel</b> assembly have been discussed. Results in the case of stiffness and frontal crash analyses at step one and step two proved that although the composite solutions have lower energy absorption capacity in comparison with the steel one, they have large contribution to the weight reduction of the vehicle <b>roof</b> <b>panel</b> and still stays in the acceptable range of structural performance. Using the new design of sandwich solutions in roof crushing test have proved that while theses designs have reduced the vehicle <b>roof</b> <b>panel</b> weight by 68 %, they have the same structural performance as the steel solution and could be considered as interesting solutions. Evaluating the behavior of the vehicle roof structure made of different solutions with various configurations under distinct analyses of stiffness and crashworthiness will help to improve the vehicle roof structure performance...|$|R

40|$|The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) {{recommends}} that all fire departments immediately take the following actions {{to reduce the}} risk of fire fighters being injured or killed while operating on roofs that contain translucent corrugated roof panels: 1. Ensure that all fire fighters, company officers and chief officers are aware of and are trained to recognize translucent corrugated <b>roof</b> <b>panels.</b> 2. Establish policies and procedures to ensure that fire fighters do not walk or stand on translucent corrugated <b>roof</b> <b>panels.</b> 3. Ensure fire fighters immediately inform the incident commander and other fire fighters when translucent corrugated <b>roof</b> <b>panels</b> are identified. 4. Ensure fire fighters follow safe roof operating practices including sounding the roof, having enough ladders for safe exit and always wearing the proper PPE, including self-contained breathing apparatus. The NIOSH Fire Fighter Fatality Investigation and Prevention Program is currently investigating a July 15, 2015 fire fighter line-of-duty-death that illustrates the hazard to fire fighters when operating on roofs containing translucent corrugated panels. These panels are designed to transfer natural light and heat into a building's interior and in some cases may be painted or tinted to blend in with the existing <b>roof.</b> These <b>panels</b> are designed in a variety of shapes, sizes, and colors and may be difficult to recognize, especially at night. Preliminary findings indicate that these panels are typically not designed to be walked upon, will not support the weight of a fire fighter (with or without personal protective equipment and tools), and may degrade when exposed to UV, water and other chemicals. These <b>roof</b> <b>panels</b> can be found in a variety of buildings including, manufacturing facilities, warehouses, storage buildings, restaurants, carports, canopies, barns and covered walkways in both commercial and residential settings. Circumstances of the incident under investigation by NIOSH On June 28, 2015, at approximately 2130 hours, a 46 -year-old career fire fighter/engineer was seriously injured, and eventually died, when he fell through a translucent corrugated <b>roof</b> <b>panel</b> while his crew was searching the roof for fire extension from an exterior dumpster fire. The fire department was dispatched for a report of a multi-family commercial structure fire. The first arriving crews found a fire burning in a dumpster located against the exterior wall of a 300 feet x 60 feet, one-story, metal frame commercial building located in a warehouse district. The first arriving crews pulled the dumpster away from the building and quickly extinguished the fire using tank water. Scorch marks on the exterior wall near a window raised the possibility of fire extension inside the building. The incident commander directed crews to force entry into the building and search for fire extension and occupants. He also directed a truck company to ladder the roof and search for fire extension. Four fire fighters climbed onto the roof, where one used a thermal imager to check for signs of fire extension while the other three, including the fire fighter/engineer, sized up the roof conditions. While operating on the roof, the fire fighter/engineer stepped on a translucent corrugated <b>roof</b> <b>panel</b> and fell approximately 17 feet onto a concrete floor. The fire fighter was seriously injured and died 17 days later on July 15, 2015. This fire department experienced a similar incident in 2012 in which a translucent corrugated <b>roof</b> <b>panel</b> broke under the weight of a fire fighter who fortunately did not receive a serious injury. A NIOSH investigation report of this fatality providing additional details about the incident and recommendations for preventing falls through these types of <b>roof</b> <b>panels</b> will be available at a later date. NIOSH would like to bring this information to the attention of all U. S. fire departments; fire fighters; fire service trainers; building officials; local, city and state authorities having jurisdiction and building code organizations. Translucent corrugated <b>roof</b> <b>panels</b> are widely used across the United States. Fire departments should identify structures within their jurisdiction that have translucent corrugated <b>roof</b> <b>panels</b> and include this information in pre-incident plans. This information should be shared with mutual aid departments and added into the caution notes of CAD dispatch systems where possible. Incident commanders should strongly consider the risk benefit analysis of permitting rooftop operations on identified buildings. Fire fighters may not be aware of and may not fully appreciate the hazards and risks associated with these panels. Fire fighters should always inform the incident commander and other fire fighters when translucent corrugated <b>roof</b> <b>panels</b> are identified and should not walk or stand on them. Fire fighters should constantly sound the roof to gauge structural integrity and changes in roof construction. Translucent corrugated <b>roof</b> <b>panels</b> can be difficult to identify and seldom have frames or other features that identify their location. NIOSHTIC No 2004702...|$|R
