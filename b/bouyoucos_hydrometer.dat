40|$|Abstract—The two {{widely used}} methods {{base on the}} {{sedimentation}} principle (<b>Bouyoucos</b> <b>hydrometer</b> and International pipette) for particle-size analysis were comparatively evaluated on soils collected from various locations in Sudan savanna of Nigeria particularly from Sokoto and Zamfara States. The hydrometer method under-estimated the silt and over-estimated the clay content. Also, the hydrometer reading proved difficult and tended to submerge when floated for clay reading in the suspension of very sandy soils (900 g kg- 1 sand). Furthermore, {{the results from the}} two methods were validated by subjecting the data to USDA soil textural triangle to determine their textural class names. The outcome was that 91. 67 % of the experimental soils retained the same textural class names irrespective of the method. Thus, <b>Bouyoucos</b> <b>hydrometer</b> method may conveniently find a place in routine work in view of its simplicity, rapidity, and strong correlation with the pipette method.

Three soil samples per site (< 5  m from the plots) were collected by cutting soil with a knife and measured the volume. Each sample was dried at 105 °C over 3  days and weighed to calculate a bulk density and water content. Another sample per site was collected for CN, pH, and texture tests. The percentage of C, N contents of soil was analyzed at the Forest Soils Laboratory at the UAF School of Natural Resources and Extension. Soil pH was tested using a pH test indicator (General Hydroponics-USA, Sebastopol, CA, USA). Texture was defined by <b>Bouyoucos</b> <b>Hydrometer</b> Method. In addition to sampling, soil volumetric water content was measured using a Hydrosense soil water measurement system (Cambell Scientific Inc., North Logan, UT, USA).|$|E
30|$|The {{components}} of SPA for our study were SOC, N, SOM, pH values, EC, P, K, Fe, sand, silt, and clay. The chemical analyses of soil attributes were {{performed at the}} “MIT Soil and Water Testing Laboratory”, Aurangabad, Maharashtra, India. The SPAs were analyzed by standard laboratory methods. Soil particle size (soil textures) distributions were determined by the <b>Bouyoucos</b> <b>hydrometer</b> method (Bouyoucos 1927). The potassium dichromate method {{was used for the}} analysis of SOM content. Soil pH was determined in water with 1 : 2 (soil:water ratio) using a glass electrode pH meter (Eckert and Sims 1995) and EC in soil using a conductivity meter (Jackson 1973). The K concentrations of the soil extracts were calculated by a flame photometer (Jackson 1973). The SOC and N were determined by the Thermo Quest EA 1112 elemental analyzer.

The pH and texture of the soil were analyzed in 1 : 2.5 soil-to-water ratio suspensions using the <b>Bouyoucos</b> <b>hydrometer</b> method (Bouyoucos 1962). Electrical conductivity was determined using the sodium saturation ratio (Van Reeuwijk 1992). Soil OC concentration was determined according to the Walkley and Black (1934) method, and soil OM concentration was calculated by multiplying the OC concentration {{by a factor of}} 1.724 (Brady 1990). The concentration of TN was determined using the Kjeldahl method (Jackson 1970). Available P and exchangeable K, Ca, and Na were analyzed according to Olsen et al. (1954). CEC was analyzed using an ammonium acetate method (Van Reeuwijk 1992).|$|E
30|$|Soil {{physicochemical}} properties measured were pH, electrical conductivity, {{soil particle}} size distribution, organic carbon/organic matter, total nitrogen, ammonium, nitrate, available phosphorus, available potassium and exchangeable potassium. Soil pH and electrical conductivity were determined in a 1 : 1 soil to distilled water ratio (McKeague 1978; McLean 1982) using microprocessor pH Meter (Van London Phoenix Electrodes, USA). Particle size {{analysis of the}} soil was carried out using <b>Bouyoucos</b> <b>hydrometer</b> (POBEL, Spain) method modified by Day (1965). Soil organic carbon (SOC) was determined by a modified procedure by Walkley and Black (1934).

40|$|Abstract: The {{particle}} size distribution of soils, including clay content is of utmost importance {{in the field of}} Geotechnical Engineering. The hydrometer analysis is the most widely used technique for analyzing the {{particle size}} distribution of the fine grained fraction of soil. The various hydrometer test methods (internationally) generally vary mainly {{in the use of the}} prescribed dispersing agent. In addition, certain methods vary with the use of the prescribed hydrometer. The purpose of this study was to establish the optimum concentration and volume of the three dispersing agents (calgon, sodium pyrophosphate decahydrate and sodium tetra pyrophosphate) using the ASTM Hydrometer 152 H: E 100 (instead of the <b>Bouyoucos</b> <b>hydrometer</b> 152 H) for three soil classes, selected for their varying activity. The results indicated that the ASTM hydrometer 152 H: E 100 generally yielded lower results than hydrometer 152 H in terms of percentage fines, with the differences varying from 38 % to - 65 % for all the soils and the dispersing agents...|$|E
40|$|The {{adsorption}} of dicquat dibromide as {{affected by}} available soil moisture and concentration of diquat was studied on Blount silt loam soil in east central Indiana. The diquat under varying concentrations and soil moisture conditions was topically applied to twenty-seven, 1 / 2 meter square sample plots with the surface vegetation removed to expose bare soil. The soil {{texture of the}} research site was determined using the <b>Bouyoucos</b> <b>hydrometer</b> method. From the texture analysis, the highly adsorptive montmorillonite clay {{was determined to be}} the major adsorptive surfaces available to the diquat radical. With the montmorillonite clays being the major adsorptive surfaces, it was concluded that the applied diquat was completely adsorbed by the soil colloids. Using a modified Langlois-Stemp-Liska procedure for pesticide extraction and clean-up, the major effect of the herbicide concentrations and the soil moisture conditions on the adsorptive capacity of the soil colloids for the diquat radical was determined to be at the level of degrees of adsorption.

40|$|Abstract: Design and {{analysis}} of land-use management scenarios requires detail soil data bank including CEC, FC and PWP data. Although these parameters can be measured directly, their measurement is difficult and expensive. Pedotransfer Functions (PTFs) provide an alternative by estimating soil parameters from more readily available soil data. 125 soil samples were collected from different horizons of 32 soil profiles located in the Gorgan Province, North of Iran. Measured soil variables included texture (determined by <b>Bouyoucos</b> <b>hydrometer</b> method), organic carbon (determined Using Walkely and Black rapid titration), water percentage at field capacity and wilting point (determined using a pressure plate apparatus), water saturation percentage (determined using gravimetry method), Bulk density (determined using clod) and Cation exchange capacity (determined Using Bower method). Then, multiple linear regression and neural network model (feed-forward back-propagation network) were employed to develop a pedotransfer function for predicting soil parameters using easily measurable characteristics of clay, sand, silt, SP, Bd and organic carbon. The performance of the multiple linear regression and neural network model was evaluated using a test data set. Results showed that artificial neural network with two neurons in hidden layer had better performance in predicting soil properties than multivariate regression. In conclusion, {{the result of this}} study showed that training is very important in increasing the model accuracy of one region.

30|$|Soil {{particle}} size distribution was analyzed by the <b>Bouyoucos</b> <b>hydrometer</b> method (Day 1965). Soil bulk density was measured from three undisturbed soil samples collected using a core sampler following the procedure described by Jamison et al. (1950). The moisture retention at field capacity (FC) (−[*] 0.33  bar) and permanent welting point (PWP) (−[*] 15  bar) was determined using the pressure plate apparatus method (Gupta 2004). Available water holding capacity (AWHC) was calculated from the difference between moisture content at FC and PWP. Soil pH measured potentiometrically in H 2 O and 1  M KCl solution at the ratio of 1 : 2.5 for soil:water and soil:KCl solutions using a combined glass electrode pH meter (Van Reeuwijk 1992). The soil lime requirement (LR) was determined by Shoemaker, McLean and Pratt (SMP) single buffer procedure (Shoemaker et al. 1961). Cation exchange capacity (CEC) of the soils was determined by making use of the method suggested by Lavkulich (1981). Exchangeable calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), potassium (K), and sodium (Na) were determined by saturating the soil samples with 1  M NH 4 OAc solution at pH 7.0. Then, Ca and Mg were determined by using atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS) while exchangeable Na and K were measured by flame photometer from the same extract. Exchangeable acidity was determined by saturating the soil samples with 1  M KCl solution and titrating with 0.02  M NaOH as described by Rowell (1994).|$|E
40|$|Purpose of the Study: This {{project began}} as an ethological study of the Cliff Swallow colony (Hirundo pyrrhonota) nesting on Wohler Bridge, over the Russian River, in {{northern}} California. Its purpose was to compare their behavior with other colonies such as those studied by Emlen (1954) and Samuel (1971). It evolved in two directions. Detailed nest-building progress was recorded {{so it could be}} compared with observations of other colonies. Secondly, the textural composition of muds from Cliff Swallow nests was analyzed along with other northern California muds in an effort to determine if these Cliff Swallows actively discriminate in the selection of suitable mud with which to build their nests. Procedure: Weekly observations noted the nest-building progress of swallows at the Sonoma State University Ruben Salazar Library, while every other day the swallows nesting on the south-facing bridge support of Wohler Bridge were monitored. Nests at the Wohler Bridge colony were checked for the dates nest-building was initiated and completed, and detailed sequential illustrations were made of each stage in construction of the elaborate, gourd-shaped, mud nests of this species. Forty-six samples of dried mud from Cliff Swallow nests and nearby wet muds from five Key Locations as well as 21 samples of muds from 11 Secondary Locations were analyzed by several variations of the <b>Bouyoucos</b> <b>hydrometer</b> method to determine the relative percents of sand, silt, and clay in each sample. Results: The average construction time for all of the closely observed Wohler Bridge nests was 15. 1 days. Construction time for those nests that were started on bare cement averaged 19. 7 days, while those that were begun on old remains of nests (surviving from the previous year) took only 9. 7 days. Percentages of clay among nests, muds, and various test methods were remarkably uniform, ranging between 8...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Soil is a hardly {{renewable}} natural resource. Although soil degradation, {{caused by}} either human activities and natural processes {{is a relatively}} slow procedure, but its effects are long lasting and most often, irreversible in the time scale of man's life. Among the most significant soil contaminants resulting from both natural and human sources, heavy metals are more important due to their long- term toxicity effects. For evaluating soil's enrichment rate by heavy metals, a wide and full study of soils background values, including total and available fractions of heavy metal contents should be done. Zanjan province has some great mines and concentrating industries of lead and zinc especially in Angoran, Mahneshan. Unfortunately produced waste materials of these industries spread over the adjacent areas. Investigations showed that accumulation of some heavy metals in vegetables and crops planted in this region had occurred. Therefore, performing some investigations in these polluted areas and assessing pollution rate and heavy metals distribution in arable lands had prime importance. Our goals were: 1) determining the total and available amounts of Cu, Pb, Zn and Cd in the soils of arable lands in polluted areas of Zanjan city, 2) producing the distribution map for the metals mentioned above and 3) calculating pollution indices in the soils. Materials and Methods: The study area was in south west of Zanjan city. For soil sampling, a 1 Km by 1 Km grid defined in ArcGIS software on landuse layer and totally 144 points that placed on agricultural lands, due to our goals, were sampled. For sampling, in a 5 m radius around the point we collected some subsamples from depth of 0 - 15 cm, and after mixing the subsamples, finally a 1 Kg soil sample prepared {{and sent to the}} laboratory. Sampled soils were air dried and were passed through a 2 mm sieve. Soils organic matter (OM) content and texture were determined by Walkely-Black and <b>Bouyoucos</b> <b>hydrometer</b> methods, respectively. Soils pH were determined by glass/calomel electrode in saturation paste, EC by EC-meter in saturation paste extract, and calcium carbonate equivalent (lime) by reverse titration method. Total and available amounts of Zn, Cu, Cd and Pb were extracted by Aqua- Regia method (wet oxidation by chloridric acid and nitric acid with the 3 : 1 ratio) and by DTPA extracting solution, respectively. After extracting and filtering liquid samples, metal concentrations were measured by atomic adsorption method using GBC avanta P. Statistical analysis by SPSS and indices calculation by Excel were performed, and distribution maps were prepared by Inverse Distance Weighting method in ArcGIS software. For evaluating pollution rate, Geoaccumulation index, Enrichment factor and Availability Ratio indices were calculated and interpreted. Results and Discussion: The textures of soil samples were loam, clay loam and sandy loam. The OM contents of almost soils were less than 2 percent. Lime was less than 25 percent and acidity of soils were neutral to slightly alkaline. Soils salinity were less than 2 dS/m except a few samples. Accordingly, these soils were suitable for agriculture and there were no limitation due to evaluated properties. Median values for the total concentrations of Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn (extracted by Aqua Regia) were 0. 5, 22. 5, 14 and 82. 3 mg/Kg of soils, respectively, and for available fraction (extracted by DTPA) were 0. 1, 0. 9, 1. 6 and 3. 2 mg/Kg of soils that were much lower than measured total values. According to 90 th percentile of geoaccumulation index, at least 10 percent of samples had been polluted with Zn, Pb and Cd. Enrichment factor revealed no long term pollution. Availability ratios of Pb and Zn were relatively high, showing there exists unique and recent pollution source for them. All pollution indices showed positive correlations with OM content of soils (except for availability ratios of Cd, which had negative correlation). Therefore, OM content of soils were respect to control these indices. Geoaccumulation index of Zn, Cd and Pb, and availability ratios of Zn and Pb showed negative correlations with soil pH. Therefore, in some seasons of the year, their availabilities will increase in soil. Conclusion: The results showed that Cu content in soils were not in the critical limit but Cd, Pb and Zn content in soils were greater than standard levels and reclamation procedures for remedy of these soils must be done. The high values of the heavy metals in available fraction inthe soils increased the risk of bioaccumulation in microbial and biotic tissues. In areas where there are high content of available form of heavy metals in soils, it could be an index of new contamination in soils by heavy metals. According to geoaccumulation index of Cd, Zn and Pb, there are some contaminated points around waste depositition areas near Zanjan city. These points are in the direction that wind could effectively transport the particles of wastes to urban area. Enrichment factor (EF) showed that at least there were a few points polluted by Cd, Zn and Cu, although EF values were generally low. The leaked wastes of Zinc and lead industries had been spread in deposited areas caused difficulties in determining background values for the selected metals...|$|E
