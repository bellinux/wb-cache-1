5|$|Urinary {{catheterization}} {{increases the}} risk for urinary tract infections. The risk of <b>bacteriuria</b> (bacteria in the urine) is between three and six percent per day and prophylactic antibiotics are not effective in decreasing symptomatic infections. The risk of an associated infection can be decreased by catheterizing only when necessary, using aseptic technique for insertion, and maintaining unobstructed closed drainage of the catheter.|$|E
5|$|Urinary tract {{infections are}} more {{concerning}} in pregnancy {{due to the}} increased risk of kidney infections. During pregnancy, high progesterone levels elevate the risk of decreased muscle tone of the ureters and bladder, {{which leads to a}} greater likelihood of reflux, where urine flows back up the ureters and towards the kidneys. While pregnant women do not have an increased risk of asymptomatic <b>bacteriuria,</b> if <b>bacteriuria</b> is present they do have a 25–40% risk of a kidney infection. Thus if urine testing shows signs of an infection—even in the absence of symptoms—treatment is recommended. Cephalexin or nitrofurantoin are typically used because they are generally considered safe in pregnancy. A kidney infection during pregnancy may result in premature birth or pre-eclampsia (a state of high blood pressure and kidney dysfunction during pregnancy that can lead to seizures). Some women have UTIs that keep coming back in pregnancy and currently there is not enough research on how to best treat these infections.|$|E

If the urine contains significant bacteria but there are no symptoms, the condition is known as asymptomatic <b>bacteriuria.</b> If a {{urinary tract infection}} involves the upper tract, and the person has diabetes mellitus, is pregnant, is male, or immunocompromised, it is considered complicated. Otherwise if a woman is healthy and premenopausal it is considered uncomplicated. In children when a urinary tract infection is associated with a fever, it is deemed to be an upper urinary tract infection.|$|E

50|$|A {{number of}} {{maternal}} bacterial infections {{are associated with}} preterm birth including pyelonephritis, asymptomatic <b>bacteriuria,</b> pneumonia, and appendicitis. A review into giving antibiotics in pregnancy for asymptomatic <b>bacteriuria</b> (urine infection with no symptoms) found the research was of very low quality but that it did suggest that taking antibiotics reduced the numbers of preterm births and babies with low birth weight. Another review found that one dose of antibiotics did not seem as effective as a course of antibiotics but fewer women reported side effects from one dose.

50|$|A 2013 {{retrospective}} {{study at the}} Shaare Zedek Medical Center of patients with urinary tract infections (<b>bacteriuria)</b> caused by carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKp) showed {{no statistically significant difference}} in mortality rates from patients with <b>bacteriuria</b> caused by carbapenem-susceptible K. pneumoniae (CSKp). A 29% mortality rate was seen in patients with CRKp infection compared to a 25% mortality rate in patients with CSKp infections that produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL). Both mortality rates were considerably higher than that of patients with drug-susceptible urosepsis. Most patients in the study suffered from other illnesses, including dementia, immune compromise, renal failure, or diabetes mellitus. The main risk factor for death found by the study was being bedridden, which significantly increased the chance of death. This suggests that the deaths were due to reasons other than <b>bacteriuria.</b> Total length of hospitalization was somewhat longer in patients with CRKp infections (28 ± 33 days compared to 22 ± 28 days for patients with CSKp infection).|$|E
5000|$|Nevertheless, the NICE {{guideline}} [...] "Neonatal infection: antibiotics {{for prevention}} and treatment" [...] states: [...] "Intrapartum Antibiotic Prophylaxis {{should be offered}} if group B streptococcal colonisation, <b>bacteriuria</b> or infection are detected in the current pregnancy".|$|E

5000|$|Kidney {{transplant}} recipients, {{children with}} vesicoureteral reflux or others with structural abnormalities of the urinary tract, people with infected kidney stones {{and those who}} are having urological procedures might be more likely to benefit from treatment with antibiotics for asymptomatic <b>bacteriuria.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Screening for {{asymptomatic}} <b>bacteriuria</b> with {{urine culture}} and treatment with antibiotics is recommended during pregnancy, {{because there is}} some evidence that it reduces symptomatic urinary tract infections, low birth weight, and preterm delivery.

50|$|Additionally IAP is also {{recommended}} {{for women with}} intrapartum risk factors if their GBS carrier status is not known {{at the time of}} delivery, for women with GBS <b>bacteriuria</b> during their pregnancy, and for women who have had an infant with EOD previously.|$|E

50|$|Useful {{tests that}} may help in the {{determination}} of the cause include a urinalysis (usually normal in testicular torsion). Pyuria and <b>bacteriuria</b> (white blood cells and bacteria in the urine) in patients with acute scrotum suggests an infectious cause such as epididymitis or orchitis and specific testing for gonorrhea and chlamydia should be done. All people with chronic pain should be tested for gonorrhea and chlamydia.|$|E
50|$|Urethral {{syndrome}} is characterised {{by a set}} of symptoms typically associated with lower urinary tract infection, such as painful urination (dysuria) and frequency. It is a diagnosis of exclusion, made when there is no significant presence of <b>bacteriuria</b> with a conventional pathogen ruling out urinary tract infection, and when cystoscopy shows no inflammation of the bladder, ruling out interstitial cystitis and cystitis cystica. In women, vaginitus should also be ruled out.|$|E
5000|$|IAP is also {{recommended}} {{for women with}} intrapartum risk factors if their GBS carrier status is not known {{at the time of}} delivery, and for women with GBS <b>bacteriuria</b> during their pregnancy, and for women who have had an infant with GBS-EOD previously.The risk-based approach is, in general, less effective than the culture-based approach, [...] because in most cases, GBS-EOD develops among newborns who have been born to mothers without risk factors.|$|E
50|$|Per Infectious Disease Society of America guidelines, <b>bacteriuria</b> can be {{confirmed}} if a single bacterial species is isolated in a concentration greater than 100,000 colony forming units per millilitre of urine in clean-catch midstream urine specimens (one for men, two consecutive specimens with the same bacterium for women). For urine collected via bladder catheterization in men and women, a single urine specimen with greater than 100,000 colony forming units of a single species per millilitre is considered diagnostic. The threshold is also 100 colony forming units of a single species per millilitre for women displaying UTI symptoms.|$|E
50|$|The urine {{sediment}} of {{a patient}} with a S. saprophyticus urinary tract infection has a characteristic appearance under the microscope manifesting leukocytes, erythrocytes, and clumping due to cocci adhering to cellular elements. Chemical screening methods for <b>bacteriuria,</b> such as, urine nitrate and glucose do not always detect S. saprophyticus infection. This is because unlike Gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae urinary tract infections, S. saprophyticus does not reduce nitrate and has a longer generation time, thus does not consume glucose as rapidly. Even when such an infection occurs above {{the neck of the}} bladder, low numbers of colony-forming units (less than 105 cfu/ml) are often present.|$|E
50|$|Screening for {{asymptomatic}} <b>bacteriuria</b> {{followed by}} appropriate treatment reduces pyelonephritis {{and reduces the}} risk of preterm birth. Extensive studies have been carried out to determine if other forms of screening in low-risk women followed by appropriate intervention are beneficial, including: Screening for and treatment of Ureaplasma urealyticum, group B streptococcus, Trichomonas vaginalis, and bacterial vaginosis did not reduce the rate of preterm birth. Routine ultrasound examination of the length of the cervix identifies patients at risk, but cerclage is not proven useful, and the application of a progestogen is under study. Screening for the presence of fibronectin in vaginal secretions is not recommended at this time in women at low risk.|$|E

50|$|It {{is normal}} to find up to 3 (occasionally 5) leukocytes per high power field (40X) in a urine sample, with women having {{slightly}} higher results owing to vaginal contamination. Higher numbers indicate urinary infection. The urine test strip test for {{white blood cells}} detects leukocyte esterase, which is present in azurophilic granules of monocytes and granulocytes (neutrophilic, eosinophilic and basophilic). Bacteria, lymphocytes and epithelial cells from the genitourinary tract do not contain esterases. Neutrophil granulocytes are the leukocytes most commonly associated with urinary infections. A positive test for leukocyte esterase normally indicates the presence of bacteria and a positive nitrite test (although {{it is not always}} the case). Infections caused by Trichomonas, Chlamydia and yeasts produce leukocyturia without <b>bacteriuria.</b> The inflammation of the renal tissues (interstitial nephritis) can produce leukocyturia, in particular toxic interstitial nephritis with predominant eosinophils.|$|E
50|$|While it {{was true}} that the journal {{reflected}} Sanna’s intentions on including “applied” and “basic” research, nuances in the subject matter included in the journal’s first issues and later issues drastically changed. Specifically in the 1980s, the majority of the journals content followed a reductionist model of biomedical research; at the time, scientists followed this generalist approach to research because they believed in understanding disease at a microscopic level (especially when observing organs) to apply findings to many different cases. (Krieger 2011) For example, one article in the 1985 issue, “Prevalence of Asymptomatic <b>Bacteriuria</b> and Comparison between Different Screening Methods for its Detection in Infants”, relied on urine samples of 441 {{children between the ages of}} 3 to 36 months to detect urinary tract infections. (Goossens 1985) Other studies in the 1985 issue focused on using cultures and vector borne studies, attesting to the fact that the journal at its inception geared towards readers with a scientific background.|$|E
