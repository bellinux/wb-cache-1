50|$|Bold A and B Power Stations were coal fired, with {{a direct}} coal {{conveyor}} <b>belt</b> <b>link</b> from a washery at the colliery. This fed either directly to coal bunkers in both stations or to a stocking area. The extensive rail sidings were utilised for coal delivery, either from Bold Colliery or from other collieries via the main Liverpool to Manchester Lines. The coal from Bold Colliery was deep mined and therefore costly to recover. In later years, due to commercial reasons, the main coal supply became mostly by road from either Yorkshire or Scotland.|$|E

50|$|The AM-23 {{aircraft}} cannon is a gas-operated weapon with a vertically moving wedge breechblock. Two jointed chambering levers are pivoted {{from the}} actuating slide. The upper, longer lever {{is used to}} ram the cartridge from the <b>belt</b> <b>link</b> into the chamber. An extraction claw on its forward end is used to extract the fired cartridge case. The lower lever protrudes into the weapon housing and has a U-shaped recess on its lower end. As the actuating slide moves back and forth, a lug in the weapon housing is cammed into this recess to guide the chambering levers. The 12.7mm A-12.7 aircraft machine gun and the 23mm ZSU anti-aircraft gun are essentially identical in design and operation.|$|E

50|$|The rimmed 7.62×54mmR {{cartridges}} {{are set in}} a metal ammunition belt, and {{are held}} against the shoulder inside non disintegrating looped links, leaving the rim exposed at the rear. The belt is mounted from the right side into the feedway of the PK machine gun. The PK uses a non-reciprocating charging handle {{on the right side}} of the receiver to charge the gun. Since the PK uses a rimmed rifle cartridge and closed-link belts used for feeding, a two-stage feed mechanism with a preliminary extraction of a cartridge from a <b>belt</b> <b>link</b> was preferred over a direct ammunition feed design often used for rimmed cartridges. The PK machine gun is equipped with a lever-type feed mechanism, mounted on the feed cover and operated by the feed lever, mounted on the right wall of the receiver and wrapping around the bolt carrier with its feed pawl and roller. The PK feed mechanism pulls the rimmed 7.62×54mmR cartridges out from the back of the ammunition belt and drops the cartridges down into the feed way, allowing the bolt to strip and feed the cartridges into the chamber for firing.|$|E
50|$|The A-12.7 {{machine gun}} is a gas-operated weapon with a {{vertically}} moving wedge breechblock. On the actuating slide two pivoting, jointed chambering levers are mounted. Those chambering levers actually work like {{the arms of}} a praying mantis. The upper, longer lever is used to ram the cartridge from the <b>belt</b> <b>link</b> into the chamber. An extraction claw on its forward end is used to extract the fired cartridge case. The lower lever protrudes into the weapon housing and has a U-shaped recess on its lower end. As the actuating slide moves back and forth, a traverse lug in the weapon housing is cammed into this recess to guide the chambering levers. The A-12.7 aircraft machine gun has an electrical sear mechanism that is operated by a voltage of 26V. At the back plate a spring buffer is located. Ammunition may be fed from either the left or from the right side. A pneumatically operated charging mechanism {{on the left side of}} the receiver is used to charge the machine gun and to clear misfires. The cylindrical housing on the right side of the receiver contains the return spring of the actuating slide.|$|E
50|$|The K12 {{is based}} on the K3's design, layout, and {{function}} using a gas piston and rotating bolt. It is fed through a STANAG M13 disintegrating <b>belt</b> <b>link</b> and cannot accept a magazine. The cross-bolt type safety is the same as K3/Minimi, and the receiver is made from steel press with an aluminum alloy feed cover. Although similar in design, the receiver and other important parts are enlarged to accommodate the larger round. The K12 is somewhat heavy for the gun class at 12 kg, mainly because it has pistol grip, spade grip, and metal sliding stock all in one gun for the purpose of being quickly converted into a ground-fire machine gun by a dismounted operator; the spade grip can be removed by taking out two pins, removing the grip, and unfolding the stock which is similar in design to the FN Minimi’s Para version. Standard machine gun features are included like a folding (K3-style) bipod, quick change barrel, gas regulator, and (M240H-style) flash suppressor. It also has a folding ring sight for firing on helicopters with a folding ladder type sight for more accurate aiming. The sight is attached on a Mil-Std 1913 rail, which is also on the feed cover and both sides of the handguard. No laser or optical sight has yet been selected for use on the K12, but some kind of electro-optical accessories are expected in the near future.|$|E

5000|$|The LWMMG is {{designed}} {{to fill the gap}} between 7.62 mm and [...]50 BMG machine guns. The weapon uses the [...]338 Norma Magnum round, giving it greater lethality and double the range of the 7.62 NATO round. The LWMMG has a rate of fire of 500 rounds per minute, an effective range of 1,700 meters (1,860 yards), and a maximum range of 5,642 meters (6,170 yards). It weighs 24 pounds, making it only slightly heavier than the M240L, and 3 lb lighter than the M240B. The [...]338NM bullet has over [...] of muzzle energy and is four times more powerful than the 7.62 NATO at 1,000 meters. An individual round is twice as heavy (45.5 grams compared to 24 grams), as are each <b>belt</b> <b>link</b> (8 grams compared to 4 grams). For each weapon to fire for one minute, a belt of 500 [...]338NM rounds would weigh 37.6 kg, while a belt of 800 7.62 NATO rounds would weigh 34.4 kg. The LWMMG is operated by a gas-operated, long-stroke piston with a rotating bolt located under the barrel and fires from an open bolt. It uses “Short Recoil Impulse Averaging” technology, patented by General Dynamics and previously used on their XM806 machine gun, where the entire barrel, barrel extension, gas system, and bolt assembly recoil inside the outer housing. The LWMMG is equipped with a quick-change barrel, quad picatinny rails, collapsible stock, and can be used by dismounted troops or mounted on a platform.|$|E
5000|$|General Dynamics first {{realized}} the capability gap being experienced by U.S. forces in Afghanistan around 2010. In many cases, troops were on low ground and being engaged by PKM machine gun {{fire from the}} high ground, forcing them to return fire from where they were instead {{of being able to}} seek a better position. The M2 [...]50-caliber machine gun is too heavy for use by dismounted patrols, and rounds from an M240 begin to drift off target at 800 meters, especially when shooting upwards. At closer ranges, an M240 is accurate but does not have enough penetrating power against hard structures. The Precision Sniper Rifle competition going on at that time also showed the U.S. military was interested in infantry weapons with a 1,500-meter range. To achieve desired range capabilities, the [...]338-caliber was chosen, specifically the [...]338 Norma Magnum over the [...]338 Lapua Magnum for several reasons including greater barrel life and a less tapered case for better use in a <b>belt</b> <b>link.</b> At 1,000 yd, the 7.62 NATO's velocity drops to about 1,000 ft/s; at that range, the [...]338NM travels at 2,000 ft/s and out to 1,100 yd, the round is capable of defeating Level III armor. A machine gun was then designed around the concept with Short Recoil Impulse Averaging technology, uses available subsystem components to keep cost down, and has a broad view 6-power scope to enable point target engagement out to 1,000-1,200 meters. Development of prototypes was entirely company-funded and took 12 months. The LWMMG was first unveiled on 15 May 2012 at the Joint Armaments Conference in Seattle, Washington.|$|E
