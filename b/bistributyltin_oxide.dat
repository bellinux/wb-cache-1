40|$|Quaternary {{ammonium}} exchanged laponites (Quat-laponites) show selectivity in the adsorption of phenols and chlorinated phenols. Strong adsorbate-adsorbent {{interactions are}} indicated by adsorption isotherms. Adsorption of phenols and chlorinated phenols by Quat-smectites {{is greater than}} that by the Bi Quat-Smectites prepared in this study. It is thought that the quaternary ammonium exchanged smectite components of the Bi Quat-smectites {{interact with each other}} (adsorbent-adsorbent interactions) reducing the number of sites available for adsorbate-adsorbent interactions. Solidification/stabilisation studies of 2 -chlorophenol show that a blend of ground granulated blast furnace slag and ordinary Portland cement attenuates 2 -chlorophenol more effectively than ordinary Portland cement alone. Tetramethyl ammonium- (TMA-) and tetramethyl phosphonium- (TMP-) montmorillonites were exposed to solutions of phenol or chlorinated phenols. TMP- montmorillonite was the better adsorbent and preferentially adsorbed 4 -chlorophenol over phenol. Hydration of the interlayer cations occurs to a greater extent in the TMA-montmorillonite than the TMP-montmorillonite restricting interlayer adsorption. Contrary to that observed for phenols and chlorinated phenols, the Quat-smectites were ineffective as adsorbents for triphenyltin hydroxide and <b>bis(tributyltin)</b> <b>oxide</b> at room temperature. Under microwave conditions, only <b>bis(tributyltin)</b> <b>oxide</b> was adsorbed by the quaternary ammonium exchanged smectites. <b>Bis(tributyltin)</b> <b>oxide</b> was adsorbed from ethanol {{on the surface of the}} smectite clays at room temperature and under microwave conditions. The adsorbate-adsorbent interactions were weak. Adsorption is accompanied by conversion of <b>bis(tributyltin)</b> <b>oxide</b> to a different tin(IV) species and the release of sodium cations from the montmorillonite interlayer region. Attempts to introduce conditions suitable for charge transfer interactions between synthesised quaternary ammonium compounds and 2, 4, 6 -trichlorophenol are documented. Transition metal complex exchanged clays adsorb 2, 4, 6 -trichlorophenol and phenol. Strong adsorbate-adsorbent interactions (Type I isotherms) occur when the adsorbate is 2, 4, 6 -trichlorophenol and when the adsorbent is [Fe(bipy) 3] 2 + exchanged montmorillonite or [Co(bipy) 3] 3 + exchanged montmorillonite. The 2, 2 '-bipyridyl ligands of the adsorbents are electron rich and the 2, 4, 6 -trichlorophenol is electron deficient. This may have enhanced adsorbate-adsorbent interactions...|$|E

The air was sampled through glass fibre filters which were extracted either with methylisobutyl ketone and the BTBTO was determined in the extract by atomic absorption spectroscopy, or the filter was extracted with toluene followed by pyrolysis gas chromatography. The former method is preferable. THE ORGANIC tin compound <b>bis(tributyltin)</b> <b>oxide</b> (BTBTO) is used as a pesticide in the paint and textile industries.

Samples from uncontaminated open ocean areas served as clean-water controls. Bacteria were enriched in marine broth 2216 amended with 1 microgram of one {{of a set of}} chemicals selected for study per ml: nitrobenzene, dibutyl phthalate, m-cresol, o-cresol, 4 -nitroaniline, <b>bis(tributyltin)</b> <b>oxide,</b> and quinone. MICs of the chemicals were determined individually for all isolates. Bacterial isolates were evaluated for resistance to nine different antibiotics and for the presence of plasmid DNA. Treated sewage was found to contain large numbers of bacteria simultaneously possessing antibiotic resistance, chemical resistance, and multiple bands of plasmid DNA. Bacteria resistant to penicillin, erythromycin, nalidixic acid, ampicillin, m-cresol, quinone, and <b>bis(tributyltin)</b> <b>oxide</b> were detected in nearly all samples, but only sewage outfall confluence samples yielded bacterial isolates that were resistant to streptomycin. Bacteria resistant to a combination of antibiotics, including kanamycin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, and tetracycline, were isolated only from sewage effluent samples. It is concluded that bacterial isolates derived from toxic chemical wastes more frequently contain plasmid DNA and demonstrate antimicrobial resistance than do bacterial isolates from domestic sewage-impacted waters or from uncontaminated open ocean sites...|$|E
40|$|Other factors {{than the}} {{allergen}} itself {{may be of}} importance {{in the development of}} food allergy. This report describes the influence of the immunosuppressive compound <b>bis(tributyltin)</b> <b>oxide</b> (TBTO), present in the food chain, on the development of food allergy to peanut or ovalbumin in Brown Norway (BN) rats. To study these effects BN rats were sensitized to either 1 or 10 mg peanut or ovalbumin by daily oral gavage and the TBTO-groups were fed a diet containing 80 mg TBTO per kg diet. Co-exposure to TBTO not only resulted in decreased general immunologic parameters such as weights of mesenteric lymph nodes and Peyer's patches, lymphocyte proliferation rates in splenocytes, but also on allergic parameters. In the peanut allergen-model TBTO decreased allergen-specific Th 2 cytokine production by spleen cells, number of eosinophilic and basophilic granulocytes in the blood and production of mast cell protease II after oral food challenge. In the ovalbumin allergen-model TBTO decreased the number of eosinophilic and basophilic granulocytes, allergen-specific IgE and production of mast cell protease II after oral food challenge. The data imply that in the process of risk assessment of food allergy attention should be given to immunomodulating compounds present in the diet. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Also, the first nucleophilic oxide "O$ sp{ 2 -}$" and selenide "Se$ sp{ 2 -}$" transfer agents are reported. The tin atom thus {{serves as a}} general "group 16 (VIB) transfer agent". In the presence of crown ethers or ammonium salts, this process results {{in a new way}} to generate "naked" nucleophiles. Novel anhydrous fluorinating systems (CsF and crown ethers) involving solid-liquid phase transfer catalysis have been designed and studied. In addition, C-C bond forming reactions have been investigated by fluorodestannylation. As an extension of these results, fluorodegermanylation and fluorodeplumbylation reactions are reported. As a generalization, fluoride ion demetalates the whole group 14 for releasing nucleophilic species. Some pentacoordinated intermediates have been observed by $ sp{ 19 }$F and $ sp{ 119 }$Sn NMR spectroscopy in fluorodestannylation, thus confirming the model of nucleophilic substitution at tin and silicon. Mechanistic aspects are discussed along with a possible metal proximity effect in the enhancement of the nucleophilicity of an anion.

It has been found that, under suitable conditions, tributyltin compound is predominantly produced by the reaction of butyl iodide and zinc dust with dibutyltin diiodide, which is obtained easily by the direct reaction with tin and butyl iodide. 　A typical preparation of this compound was carried out as follows: Tinfoll (11. 9 g) was dissolved in butyl iodide (44. 1 g) in the presence of catalyst (butanol,cellosolve etc. 2. 4 g,) and the resulting solution was heated at I 45 ℃, under stirring for 3 hours, until tin was almost disappered.

40|$|The {{modes of}} action of <b>bis(tributyltin)</b> <b>oxide</b> (TBTO) doses between 1 X 10 (4) and 6 X 10 (7) {{molecules}} per cell {{on a single}} environmental isolate of Legionella pneumophila were studied by monitoring the following parameters: (i) growth, (ii) cell viability, (iii) 14 C-amino acid incorporation, (iv) 14 CO 2 production from 14 C-amino acids, (v) [3 H]uridine incorporation, (vi) [3 H]thymidine incorporation, (vii) oxygen consumption, (viii) cellular ATP levels, and (ix) adenylate energy charge. The amount of TBTO associated with the cells in these laboratory cultures was also compared with that remaining in the suspending medium. Most of the TBTO (68 to 88 %) {{was found to be}} associated with the cells. This result explained why the cellular responses which were measured did not correlate with the TBTO concentration, but rather with the dose of TBTO to which the cells were exposed. At the lower TBTO doses tested (10 (4) to 10 (7) molecules per cell) a log-normal relationship was observed between the reduction in growth rate and the TBTO concentration. At intermediate TBTO doses (ca. 10 (7) molecules per cell) growth stasis occurred, with nearly 100 % of the cells in these cultures remaining viable for at least 5 h after treatment. The cellular function which seemed to be primarily affected at these levels of TBTO was the energy conversion mechanism, since the decline in the rates of CO 2 production, oxygen consumption, and macromolecular synthesis was preceded by an immediate (within 1 min) drop in the intracellular levels of ATP and the adenylate energy charge. At the higher TBTO doses greater than 10 (7) molecules per cell) an initial, precipitous, drop in the number of viable cells was observed, which was followed by a further exponential reduction of viable cells in the treated culture. This dramatic increase in bactericidal activity with a slight increase in the TBTO dose indicated that the modes of bacteriostatic and bactericidal action of TBTO were different...|$|E
40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to {{investigate}} the effects of known environmental contaminants on defined behavioural variables in fish, and to discuss properties of these behavioural traits that make them useful as potential indicators of pollution. In studying the effects of pollution, the resulting biochemical and physiological alterations are more commonly measured. However, effects of pollution can manifest itself at all levels of biological organisation, including behaviour. In this respect, behaviour can be considered a valid biomarker of pollution in that it is expected to be both susceptible to pollution and of high ecological significance, as it influences the fitness of the affected individuals. This thesis is based on four individual studies, in which the threespine stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus was used as a model species. Results from these studies show that antipredator behaviour, feeding behaviour, shoaling behaviour, bottom-dwelling behaviour and reproductive behaviour are all sensitive to exposure to sublethal concentrations of defined environmentally relevant chemicals. The results showed that antipredator behaviour and fright response in threespine stickleback were impaired following exposure to sublethal concentrations of <b>bis(tributyltin)</b> <b>oxide</b> (TBTO). However, for some of the tested antipredator variables the effects were reversed after the ending of exposure. Further, it was shown that feeding motivation in fish exposed to butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP) and/or 2, 2 -bis(p-chlorophenyl) - 1, 1 -dichloroethylene (DDE) was increased in that exposed fish initiated feeding more often than the controls. Exposure to BBP also caused sticklebacks to aggregate into tight shoals and to spend more time {{at the bottom of the}} aquarium compared to the control fish. The reported significant differences between the controls and BBPexposed fish with respect to feeding and shoaling behaviour were shown even though the levels of BBP were below the analytical detection limit. Different suggested explanations, for example, too high detection limit, or degradation to its BBP metabolites are given to this result. 17 β-Oestradiol (E 2) exposed male sticklebacks started nest building later than non-exposed males, but there were no differences between exposed and control males with respect to the number of males that built nests. Further, the exposed males spent less time displaying paternal care compared to the control males, although there were no differences between the two groups in the number of performed courtship displays. Because of the significant effect upon some but not all reproductive behavioural traits, it was suggested that the different variables might vary in sensitivity, implying that a variety of variables should be studied in order to obtain a more reliable evaluation of the effects of pollution. Chemicals can cause deleterious effects at one or more levels of biological organisation, from biochemical, physiological, individual, population and through to the ecosystem levels. In contrast to the established hypothesis that a pollutant affects the different biological levels in an escalating timedependent pattern, starting at the biochemical level, it is here suggested that biomarkers at the biochemical, physiological and behavioural levels often will respond early and simultaneously in the same individual. Whereas some biochemical responses are specifically related to one class of exposure agents and thus may act as specific indicators of pollution, most behavioural traits may be altered in response to a variety of chemicals. One exception may be alterations in reproductive behaviour caused by endocrine disrupting chemicals, due to effects of the chemicals on hormones that result in immediate reproductive behavioural effects. In spite of the specific action of some biochemical biomarkers, they are often considered to be of little ecological relevance since many of them are not related to individual fitness. In this thesis, it is argued that behavioural variables can be employed as useful and reliable biomarkers of environmental contamination. It is also important to focus on behaviour to map and quantify the resposes. However, to reliably evaluate the effects of pollution, behavioural variables should be used in association with biochemical and physiological traits. Moreover, optimal combination of results from laboratory and field experiments would enhance the ecological relevance of the study.

40|$|Nuclear hormone receptors (NHRs) are ligand-activated transcriptions {{factors which}} transduce {{the effects of}} various hormones as well as {{nutritional}} and other environmental signals. They thus function to maintain physiological homeostasis by integrating the tissue expression of specific target genes to regulate a wealth of biological processes including reproduction, development, metabolism and environmental adaptation. Mounting evidence indicates NHRs are the target of endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs), exogenous chemicals, often of anthropogenic origin, which disrupt NHRs and thus the processes under their control. EDCs can interfere with NHR signalling by activating receptors (agonists), by inhibiting {{the actions of the}} receptor (antagonists), or by disrupting endogenous hormone synthesis, secretion, transport or metabolism. Much of the focus to date has been on the risk of EDCs to reproductive functions, via estrogen and androgen NHRs in humans, and also in aquatic organisms. However environmental pollutants also have the potential to interact with other NHRs, particularly in aquatic environments, and cause dysregulation of other critical physiological processes, including energy homeostasis, immune functions and the stress response. To address this possibility a reporter gene assay was developed, allowing the high-throughput screening of pollutants for their interactions with piscine NHRs with critical roles in energy homeostasis, stress reponse and immune functions, namely the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) and corticosteroid receptors (CRs) from European plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) and European flounder (Platichthys flesus), respectively. Complementary DNA (cDNA) sequences encoding the ligand-binding domains of PPARs and CRs, critical for receptor-ligand interactions and receptor activation, were ligated to the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of the yeast Gal 4 transcription activator protein to create experimental expression plasmid constructs. Co-transfection of these expression plasmids into the fathead minnow (FHM) cell line with an upstream-activating sequence (UAS) -firefly luciferase reporter gene plasmid increased luciferase expression in the presence of known PPAR and CR ligands. Several aquatic pollutants including pharmaceuticals, industrial by-products and biocides were tested for their potential to disrupt PPAR and CR functions by interacting with these receptors in an agonistic or antagonistic manner. Several fibrates, a group of pharmaceutical compounds used to treat dyslipidemia in humans by targeting the PPARs, were able to activate plaice Gal 4 -PPARα and Gal 4 -PPARβ in the reporter gene assay, indicative of an interaction with PPAR receptors in non-target species. Fibrates which did not activate Gal 4 -PPARα were able to inhibit the activation of Gal 4 -PPARα by the PPARα-specific agonist, Wy 14643, suggesting differential effects of fibrates on human and flounder PPARs. In addition some metabolites of widespread phthalate ester pollutants were also agonists of the Gal 4 -PPARα and Gal 4 -PPARβ constructs. The Gal 4 -PPARγ construct was unresponsive to almost all the compounds tested, including the mammalian PPARγ agonist, rosiglitazone. The exception to this was the phthalate metabolite monobenzylphthalate, which induced a small increase in firefly luciferase in Gal 4 -PPARγ transfected cells. All of the above effects required concentrations of at least 10 µM, which are unlikely to be encountered in the aquatic environment. In contrast <b>bis(tributyltin)</b> <b>oxide</b> (TBTO), a notorious environmental pollutant, inhibited Gal 4 -PPARα and Gal 4 -CR constructs at concentrations as low as 1 nM and 100 nM, respectively. These concentrations are lower than those reported in aquatic environments, or in fish tissues, making TBTO a candidate endocrine disruptor in fish by inhibiting PPARα and CR signalling. A European flounder cDNA microarray was used to investigate the trasnscriptional responses of flounder hepatocytes to TBTO (10 nM) exposure. Exposure to TBTO and Wy 14643, both alone and in combination, indicated a TBTO-driven downregulation of several potential PPARα-target genes with functions in the immune system, the proteasome, and lipid metabolism, although, based on mammalian comparisons, some potential PPARα-target genes were also upregulated, indicating differences in mammalian and fish PPAR-target genes or reflecting the complexity of organisms at a higher organisational level than cell-based assay systems. However, the microarray-based approach was useful in formulating further hypotheses about the effects of TBTO on PPARα signalling. Overall, these results indicate that exogenous chemicals entering the aquatic environment can interfere with NHRs with functions in energy homeostasis, immune functions and stress, in non-target organisms. The cell-based reporter gene assay is a useful tool for identifying potential endocrine disruptors which target PPARs and CRs and would be a useful method in a first tier testing approach, limiting the use of live animal models and enabling investigation into specific receptors which are targets of endocrine disrupting compounds. Although more work is required to confirm the physiological consequences of TBTO inhibition of PPARα, the results presented here indicate that organisms inhabiting TBTO-polluted environments may experience suppression of the immune system, an increase in non-functional or misfolded proteins through suppression of genes involved in the ubiquitin/proteasome system and a disruption in lipid homeostasis...|$|E
