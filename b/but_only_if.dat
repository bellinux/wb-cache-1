5|$|Characters {{throughout}} the film studios and movie sets will help Seymour on his quest with new objects and advice, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>if</b> he helps them first. Seymour's observations when collecting objects and sarcastic exchanges with other characters are communicated through speech bubbles. One {{example of a}} puzzle is the Frankenstein's monster which must be created by combining body parts in a specific location on the horror film set. Once the monster is completed it smashes {{through one of the}} set's walls, allowing Seymour to access the set next door.|$|E

However she also discovers {{that he had been}} watching her telepathically for some time and that she is not the first person to be brought here to provide companionship for him.|$|E

5|$|In October {{with the}} World Series {{approaching}} and Tancredo's team the Colorado Rockies representing the National League, {{he decided to}} offer a bet with fellow candidate Mitt Romney whose team the Boston Red Sox were representing the American League. Tancredo proposed that he would {{drop out of the}} race if Boston won <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>if</b> Romney agreed to drop out if Colorado won. Luckily for Tancredo, the Romney campaign turned down the bet and Boston won the world series.|$|E

In response to this threat, the Natchez seemed to promise to cede the land, wrote Dumont de Montigny, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>if</b> they were given two months to relocate their temple and graves.

5|$|Bart and Milhouse {{convince}} Comic Book Guy {{to publish}} a comic book he wrote titled Everyman, in which the title character can absorb superpowers from the characters of comic book he touches. The comic becomes an instant hit, and many Hollywood studios become interested in making it into a movie. Comic Book Guy agrees to let Everyman become a movie, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>if</b> he can pick the star. When Comic Book Guy sees Homer, he considers Homer perfect for the role, as he wants Everyman to be played by a middle-aged fat man. But the studio executives realize that audiences want a physically fit actor for the role, so they hire celebrity fitness trainer Lyle McCarthy to get Homer into shape. After a month, Homer becomes fit and the movie begins production.|$|E

5|$|In 1993, Enron {{established}} {{a joint venture}} in energy investments with CalPERS, the California state pension fund, called the Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI). In 1997, Skilling, serving as Chief Operating Officer (COO), asked CalPERS to join Enron in a separate investment. CalPERS {{was interested in the}} idea, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>if</b> it could be terminated as a partner in JEDI. However, Enron did not want to show any debt from assuming CalPERS' stake in JEDI on its balance sheet. Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Fastow developed the special purpose entity Chewco Investments limited partnership (L.P.) which raised debt guaranteed by Enron and was used to acquire CalPERS's joint venture stake for $383 million. Because of Fastow's organization of Chewco, JEDI's losses were kept off of Enron's balance sheet.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Dunst reprised {{her role}} as Mary Jane Watson in Spider-Man 3. In {{contrast}} to the previous two films' positive reviews, Spider-Man 3 received mixed reviews from critics. Nonetheless, with a total worldwide gross of $891million, it stands as the most commercially successful film in the series and Dunst's highest-grossing film {{to the end of}} 2008. Having initially signed on for three Spider-Man films, she revealed that she would do a fourth, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>if</b> Raimi and Maguire also returned. In January 2010, it was announced that the fourth film was cancelled and that the Spider-Man film series would be restarted, and therefore dropping Dunst, Maguire and Raimi from the franchise.|$|E
5|$|In Jötunheimr, the jötunn Þrymr {{sits on a}} barrow, {{plaiting}} golden collars for {{his female}} dogs, and trimming the manes of his horses. Þrymr sees Loki, and asks what could be amiss among the Æsir and the elves; why is Loki alone in Jötunheimr? Loki responds that he has bad news for both the elves and the Æsir—that Thor's hammer, Mjöllnir, is gone. Þrymr {{says that he has}} hidden Mjöllnir eight leagues beneath the earth, from which it will be retrieved, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>if</b> Freyja is brought to him as his wife. Loki flies off, the feather cloak whistling, away from Jötunheimr and back to the court of the gods.|$|E

5|$|Model's {{first order}} was that Falaise be defended, {{which did not}} impress his staff. However, he quickly changed his mind, convincing Hitler to authorize the {{immediate}} escape of the German Seventh Army and Panzer Group Eberbach—something that Kluge, with his limited political clout, {{had not been able}} to do. He was thus able to rescue a high proportion of the units involved, albeit at the cost of nearly all their armour and heavy materiel. When Hitler demanded that Paris be held, Model replied that he could do so, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>if</b> given an extra 200,000 men and several panzer divisions—an act that has been described as naïveté by some, and canny bargaining by others. The reinforcements were not forthcoming, and the city's liberation took place on 25 August. Meanwhile, Model fell back to the German border.|$|E
5|$|On {{the same}} day as Wedel arrived, 20 July, Saltykov {{established}} himself astride the Prussian communication line at the Oder, strengthening his already formidable position. This effectively cut any Prussian advance or reinforcement from Crossen (Krosno) or Frankfurt on the Oder. At this point, the Russians occupied the heights by Kay and additional high ground by Mosau (Mozów). A stream, the Eichmühlen Fliess, flowed in a swampy depression just to the east of the town. It could be crossed only at a single narrow point on the road east of Kay, directly opposite the Russian center; a second crossing could be made immediately south of Kay, which would permit an assault on the Russian right flank. This seemed reasonable to Wedel, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>if</b> the Russians were not fully deployed.|$|E
5|$|Option C is {{a concept}} in which the current X Division Champion may voluntarily vacate the {{championship}} {{in exchange for a}} World Heavyweight Championship match at that year's Destination X event.

Aries agreed to Hogan's terms, on the condition that the X Division Champion be given the same opportunity in future years. Aries would then relinquish the X Division Championship and successfully defeated Bobby Roode for the World title.|$|E

5|$|Recent {{governments have}} {{encouraged}} {{the formation of}} town and parish councils in unparished areas, and the Local Government and Rating Act 1997 gave local residents the right to demand {{the creation of a}} new civil parish.

The chairman of a town or city council is called a mayor. There are currently 28 civil parishes in the county with the status of a town, and one (Wells) with city status.

5|$|Scully goes to Agent Robert Comer, {{whom she}} was forced to shoot after his attempt on William's life, and uses the alien {{artifact}} to heal him. Comer explains that Josepho believes a physical manifestation of God exists inside the spacecraft. According to an ancient prophecy, William is destined to become the savior of humanity, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>if</b> Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) is still alive. If he dies, William will instead lead the Colonists. Comer claims that Mulder was supposedly killed by the cult in order for the aliens to successfully invade; he tried to kill William to prevent him from causing humanity's destruction. Suddenly, a nurse and the Toothpick Man (Alan Dale) arrive and ask Reyes and Scully to leave. Comer ends up alone with the Toothpick Man.|$|E
5|$|The Company {{suggested}} to the UK government {{that it might}} despatch 500 troopers from the Rhodesian Reserves to Europe {{to act as an}} all-Southern Rhodesian unit on the Western Front (in Belgium and France), but the War Office in London replied that such an expeditionary force would be more practically deployed in Africa, within the South African forces. When the Company relayed this idea south, the South Africans said they were happy to take the Southern Rhodesians, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>if</b> they enlisted independently in existing Union regiments. The Company found itself in the unusual position of having a prospective expeditionary force that nobody wanted. Unwilling to wait, some Southern Rhodesian would-be soldiers made their own way to England to join the British Army directly, as individuals or in groups. By the end of October 1914, about 300 were on their way.|$|E
