The squadron was to be supplemented by a Field Troop and by members posted from other units throughout the Army, bringing the squadron to a deployment strength of 275. A headquarters was to be formed, supporting the Chief Engineer at the UNTAG Military Headquarters. The total strength of the force was to <b>be</b> <b>over</b> 300 of all ranks, in what was known as Plan Witan.

5|$|By 1907, Londoners {{had seen}} the network of deep tube {{underground}} railways expand from the original C line of 1890 with its six stations to a network of seven lines serving more than 70 stations.

In several cases pre-opening predictions of passenger numbers had proven to <b>be</b> <b>over</b> optimistic. The reduced revenues generated from the lower numbers of passengers using the lines made it difficult for the operators to pay back the capital borrowed and pay dividends to shareholders.|$|E

5|$|By {{early spring}} of 1794, the {{situation}} in France was dire. With famine looming after {{the failure of the}} harvest and the blockade of French ports and trade, the French government was forced to look overseas for sustenance. Turning to France's colonies in the Americas, and the agricultural bounty of the United States, the National Convention gave orders for the formation of a large convoy of sailing vessels to gather at Hampton Roads in the Chesapeake Bay, where Admiral Vanstabel would wait for them. According to contemporary historian William James this conglomeration of ships was said to <b>be</b> <b>over</b> 350 strong, although he disputes this figure, citing the number as 117 (in addition to the French warships).|$|E
5|$|Combat in Final Fantasy is menu-based: {{the player}} selects an action {{from a list}} of options such as Attack, Magic, and Item.

Final Fantasy was the first game to show the player's characters {{on the right side of}} the screen and the enemies on the left side of the screen, as opposed to a first-person view.|$|E
5|$|Daisy re-strengthened into a Category2 {{later on}} October6, and peaked with winds of 110mph (175km/h). The outerbands of Daisy {{produced}} strong winds and heavy surf in Bermuda, but caused no damage. It weakened {{back to a}} Category1 again on October7. While passing offshore New England, the storm, combined with a nor'easter, produced flooding and strong winds. Two fatalities were {{directly related to the}} hurricane, and 24other people died in traffic related deaths, that were caused by slick roads from the heavy rain. Total damage in New England was estimated to <b>be</b> <b>over</b> $1.1million (1962USD). Early on October8, Daisy made landfall near Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, several hours before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone. In Atlantic Canada, the storm brought rough seas, causing coastal flooding and six fatalities in Nova Scotia.|$|E

5|$|Draught beer's {{environmental}} impact can be 68% lower than bottled beer due to packaging differences. A life cycle study of one beer brand, including grain production, brewing, bottling, distribution and waste management, {{shows that the}} CO2 emissions from a 6-pack of micro-brew beer is about 3 kilograms (6.6 pounds). The loss of natural habitat potential from the 6-pack of micro-brew beer {{is estimated to be}} 2.5 square metres (26 square feet). Downstream emissions from distribution, retail, storage and disposal of waste can <b>be</b> <b>over</b> 45% of a bottled micro-brew beer's CO2 emissions. Where legal, the use of a refillable jug, reusable bottle or other reusable containers to transport draught beer from a store or a bar, rather than buying pre-bottled beer, can reduce the {{environmental impact}} of beer consumption.|$|E
