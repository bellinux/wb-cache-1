40|$|The present {{investigation}} was mainly concerned with characteristics of autogeneous laser butt welding of 2 [*]mm thickness nonheat treatableAA 5052 -H 12,AA 5083 -H 12 and 2 [*]mm, 3 [*]mm thickness heat treatableAA 6061 -T 6 aluminum alloys. The effect of laser welding parameters, surface cleaning, filler wire addition, and <b>backing</b> <b>strip</b> on quality of laser welded joints was clarified using 5 [*]kW CO 2 laser machine. It {{was found that}} all the investigated alloys showed tendencies for porosity and solidification cracking, particularly, at high welding speed (≥ 4 [*]m/min). Porosity was prevented by accurate cleaning of the base metal prior to welding and optimizing the flow rate of argon shielding gas. Solidification cracking was avoided through two different approaches. The first one {{is based on the}} addition of filler metal as reported in other research works. The other new approach is concerned with autogeneous welding using a <b>backing</b> <b>strip</b> from the same base metal, and this could be applicable in production. Preventing solidification cracking in both cases was related mainly to a considerable decrease in the stress concentration at the weld metal center as a result of improving the fusion zone profile. The implementation of the new approach could help in producing weldments with a better quality due to the absence of the filler metal, which is known as a source for hydrogen-related porosity. It can also have a positive economic aspect concerning the manufacturing cost since welding is done without the addition of filler metal. Not only quality and economic positive aspects could be achieved, but also high productivity is another feature since high quality autogeneous weldments were produced with high welding speed, 6 [*]m/min. Hardness measurements and tensile test of AA 6061 alloy welds indicated a remarkable softening of the fusion zone due to dissolution of the strengthening precipitates, and this was recovered by aging treatment after welding. For alloys AA 5052 and AA 5083, softening of the fusion zone due to the loss of its work-hardened condition was much less in comparison with AA 6061 alloy...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In a welded structure, thick {{plates are}} joined by multi-pass welding in the butt joint. During the first pass of multi-pass welding, burn-through, lack of fusion, and {{incomplete}} penetration were readily found as weld defects. Accordingly, the backing condition should be carefully selected in welding of a thick plate, because improper backing conditions lead to weld defects. In the job site, a steel <b>backing</b> <b>strip</b> is usually adopted, although it reduces the fatigue strength. No backing conditions or removable backing is recommended to increase the fatigue strength, but selection of the proper backing and welding conditions is complicated. In this study, several backing methods, such as ceramic backing, water-cooled copper backing, and even the use of no backing, were investigated during GMA (Gas Metal Arc) welding of a thick steel plate. The {{gas metal arc welding}} conditions were established for each backing method, and the bead shape and mechanical properties were examined after welding...|$|E

40|$|International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) Correction Coil (CC) case, made of {{ultra-low}} carbon {{austenitic stainless}} steel 316 LN with 20 mm thickness, was designed in the outmost layer of the CC, and was used to protect the internal superconducting coil, resist the deformation effect caused by the powerful electromagnetic force and thermal stress during the operation process. These cases have characteristics of small cross-section, large dimension, and complex structure. They {{were divided into two}} parts for the convenience of the internal superconducting coil being inserted into the case, and they will be closure welded together after insertion. Thus, weld seam is located the whole perimeter of the case, which will decide the large quantity weld with the specific distribution caused by the geometric profile of the case. The distribution requires a specific welding system, aim at the CC case closure welding characteristic, should be developed to realize the field welding. The strict deformation requirement, temperature control of internal coil and full penetration with high welding quality brings the technology challenges to this closure welding. The welding system must be constructed and these key technologies must be solved using this welding tooling before the offcial production of CC. A fibre laser robotic welding system was developed for the case closure welding based on the research, scheme design and analysis in this thesis. The specific qualification experiments were carried out on this laser welding system according to technology challenges on the welding quality, temperature control and deformation. Firstly, according to the distribution of weld seam, the preliminary scheme designs of welding systems based on several different welding methods were carried out. It was found that the laser welding is identified as the most suitable welding method. Based on above, reasonable arrangement of robots and external rail, and simulation of robotic welding motion process were carried out in order to further optimize design and analysis. The simulation results show that there exist the dead zone where the robot arm can not doing the effective welding and the robotic welding workspace should be increased. A slip plate module for the welding robot was added to assist travel, after that, the robot was successful in covering all weld seams in all cases. Secondly, to complete this welding system, the welding fixture should be developed to support the welding platform, adjust the assembly tolerance and provide the rigid constrain to control the welding deformation, and electric control should be developed to integrate the welding system and increase its security and stability. A number of ground supports match with the C-type clamps were designed and special distributed aim at the geometric profile of case. The rotatable ground supports, which can provide two types of welding platform, were developed to meet the two different welding positions with arched and concave shape of SCC case. In order to provide the turn over function for SCC case, a welding tilter with tilter framework, single central axis, load-bearing jig was designed base on the good finite element analysis (FEA) result. In addition, the design requirements of the control system of the CC case laser welding were analyzed and the integrated control system was developed based on SIEMENS PLC system S 7 - 300. Thirdly, narrow gap multi-pass laser welding with hot wire was developed as the welding process for the case closure welding. The welded jointed with defects-free and good mechanical properties was achieved based on good optical system, reasonable groove structure and optimized welding procedure. In order to protect the internal superconducting coil, which is inside of the case, the <b>backing</b> <b>strip</b> was designed and welded by laser welding behind the case in the actual welding structure of the CC case. The temperature distribution of the welding process was simulated by FEA and measured by the thermocouples on a short sample. The FEA temperature distribution shows good agreement with the experimental measurement, the highest temperature of the inner face of case was 255 ℃, and the highest temperature record of surface of the internal coil was 59 ℃. The result shows the laser welding process will not harm the superconducting coil, and the welding process, based on the laser welding system, can meet the temperature control requirement. To study the welding deformation, a SCC model case was designed, fabricated and welded by the laser welding system. The principle of positioning welding before continuous welding, as well as segmented, skip, symmetry and repeated turn over, was developed to keep uniform heating of the model case. According to the detected results of welding deformation of the model case, the overall welding deformation was controlled below ± 2 mm. Satisfactory results of the welding deformation of the model case certify the reasonability of the welding structure, system and process of the CC case closure welding, and also provide technical support for the full scale CC case. In conclusion, this thesis study to develop a special robotic laser welding system to solve the CC case closure welding, and some key technologies were studied aim at the related engineering challenges...|$|E
