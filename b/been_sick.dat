He hoped to be appointed to the Custom House in Philadelphia with help from President Tyler's son Robert, an acquaintance of Poe's friend Frederick Thomas. Poe failed to show up for a meeting with Thomas to discuss the appointment in mid-September 1842, claiming to have <b>been</b> <b>sick,</b> though Thomas believed that he had been drunk. Though he was promised an appointment, all positions were filled by others.|$|E

Napoleon, who had <b>been</b> <b>sick</b> with a cold and was {{too far from the}} action to really observe what was going on, refused to send his subordinates reinforcements. He was hesitant to release his last reserve, the Imperial Guard, so far from France.|$|E
5|$|At age fifty-eight, Baldwin {{desired to}} satisfy his nature {{of being a}} pioneer again by moving to Kansas, which {{was at that time}} a territory. He arrived as the brunt of the {{fighting}} in the territory was ending. Upon his arrival, he founded Baldwin City and built the first college building in the territory, which became the foundation for Baker University. He was in Kansas only for a short time when tragedy struck. On August 30, 1858, John's son Milton died unexpectedly after having <b>been</b> <b>sick</b> for only three days. Within a couple years, he laid out a town, built a grist mill and a saw mill, and he turned over the town and college to the Methodist Conference and returned to Berea, although he continued to finance it.|$|E

5|$|Jonathan and Dio grow up {{and become}} friendlier, but Jonathan {{suspects}} ulterior motives when Dio acts very caring for George, who has <b>been</b> <b>sick</b> for an extended time. Learning that Dario had the same symptoms before he died, Jonathan suspects that Dio poisoned both of them; Dio plans to stop Jonathan from exposing this by killing him with the stone mask. When he tests the mask on a beggar beforehand, it instead turns the beggar into a vampire, who dies due to exposure to sunlight. While investigating the poison, Jonathan befriends the street thug Robert E. O. Speedwagon and learns that Dio acquired it from Wang Chan, a black market merchant. Jonathan confronts Dio, who uses George's blood and the mask to become a vampire. The Joestar estate burns to the ground during the ensuing battle, but Jonathan and Dio survive.|$|E
5|$|Having {{heard all}} of that, the brother took two pistols, poured more gunpowder, and {{sharpened}} the flints; {{he put the}} pistols into his belt, placed the knife between them, and slung a musket over his shoulder. He set forth. He passed through the dark forest; he came beneath the stair-like cliff; {{the moon and the}} stars were shining, so it was like a day; a silence all around him, pleasant; he sat down and lit his pipe. Before long a wisp of cloud showed from the direction of Mount Rumija; there came a roar and bluster, and everything happened as the sick man said. His hair rose so that three times he jammed his cap down on his head. Finally, three bulls fell down from the storm cloud and started to fight; all as it was said. He stabbed the pied bull in the neck with the knife; it staggered and fell; the light-haired bull got encouraged. Then he stabbed the dark-haired bull, and it slumped; the light-haired was finishing them off with its horns. This was not enough for him, and, fearing that the cut bulls could still rise up, he kept on striking them with the knife as long as there was a breath in their bodies. The storm cloud suddenly disappeared; together with it, the light-haired bull vanished. Again the moon and the stars shone; again a silence and blessedness. He was going back home as if flying; when he arrived he found his brother sitting by the hearth, placing logs on the fire, healthy as if he had never <b>been</b> <b>sick.</b>|$|E

25|$|In 1536 Lady Kingston {{is said to}} {{have played}} a role in Mary Tudor's {{reconciliation}} with her father, and in his life of Mary Tudor, historian David Loades states that Lady Kingston had charge of a joint household for Henry VIII's daughters, Mary and Elizabeth, from March 1538 until April 1539. A letter from her to Thomas Wriothesley on 3 January 1538 advises of Mary's illness ('My Lady's Grace has <b>been</b> <b>sick</b> ever since Christmas'). Even after she was discharged from that position, Lady Kingston's continuing relationship with the King's elder daughter is attested to by gifts from her listed in Mary Tudor's privy purse accounts, including gifts of £4 in May 1540 and a gold spoon in January 1544.|$|E
25|$|Robertson, who had <b>been</b> <b>sick</b> in bed, {{wrote to}} Haig (3 March) {{that he did}} not trust Nivelle. He {{continued}} to lobby the War Cabinet (“it was very unpleasant to listen to” wrote Spears) of the folly of leaving the British Army under French control, passing on Haig’s demand that he keep control of the British reserves, and advising that intelligence reports suggested preparations for large-scale German troop movements in Eastern Belgium. With War Cabinet opinion having turned against Lloyd George – who was also rebuked by the King – Robertson also then submitted a memorandum stating that the Calais Agreement was not to be a permanent arrangement, along with a “personal statement” so critical of Lloyd George that he refused to have it included in the minutes.|$|E

Having just concluded a three-year contract at an annual salary of $70,000, Ruth promptly rejected both the Yankees' initial proposal of $70,000 for one year and their 'final' offer of two years at seventy-five—the latter figure equalling the annual salary of then US President Herbert Hoover; instead, Ruth demanded at least $85,000 and three years. When asked why {{he thought he was}} [...] "worth more than the President of the United States," [...] Ruth responded: [...] "Say, if I hadn't <b>been</b> <b>sick</b> last summer, I'd have broken hell out of that home run record! Besides, the President gets a four-year contract. I'm only asking for three."

500|$|In 1975, the 48-year old Davis {{embarked}} on a three-week tour of Japan; between January 22 and February 8, he played 14 concerts in large-hall venues to capacity crowds and enthusiastic reviews. Japanese critic Keizo Takada said Davis was leading his [...] "magnificent and energetic" [...] band just as Duke Ellington had his orchestra: [...] "Miles must be the genius of managing men and bringing out their hidden talent." [...] Throughout the tour, he had <b>been</b> <b>sick</b> with pneumonia and a bleeding ulcer that grew worse, while his hip occasionally and unpredictably slipped out of its socket. Unable to work his trumpet's volume and effects pedals because of {{the pain in his}} legs, he would go down on his knees to press them with his hand during performances. To relieve his pain and perform, he used codeine and morphine, smoked, and drank large quantities of Heineken beer. On several occasions, Davis was able to play two concerts in one day, as he did on February 1 at the Festival Hall in Osaka. [...] "The Japanese people were very beautiful", Henderson recalled from the concerts. [...] "They came in with their suit and ties on and we proceeded to blow the roof off the suckers with a million amplifiers." ...|$|E
