He claimed that it was necessary to balance the budget as quickly as possible so as to maintain the stability of the economy. He suggested expenditure cuts in different sectors, including university funding.|$|E
25|$|Connecticut's {{dependence}} on the defense industry posed an economic challenge {{at the end of}} the Cold War. The resulting budget crisis helped elect Lowell Weicker as governor on a third-party ticket in 1990. Weicker's remedy was a state income tax which proved effective in <b>balancing</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget,</b> but only for the short-term. He did not run for a second term, in part because of this politically unpopular move.|$|E
25|$|Upon being {{appointed}} Prime Minister of Italy, Mussolini had to form {{a coalition}} government because the Fascists did not have control over the Italian parliament. Mussolini's coalition government initially pursued economically liberal policies {{under the direction of}} liberal finance minister Alberto De Stefani, a member of the Center Party, including <b>balancing</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> through deep cuts to the civil service. Initially, little drastic change in government policy had occurred and repressive police actions were limited.|$|E

25|$|Atwater: As to {{the whole}} Southern {{strategy}} that Harry S.

All that you need to do to keep the South is for Reagan to run in place on the issues that he's campaigned on since 1964, and that's fiscal conservatism, <b>balancing</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget,</b> cut taxes, you know, the whole cluster.|$|E
25|$|Roosevelt {{initially}} favored <b>balancing</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget,</b> {{but soon}} found himself running spending deficits to fund his numerous programs. Douglas, however—rejecting {{the distinction between}} a regular and emergency budget—resigned in 1934 and became {{an outspoken critic of}} the New Deal. Roosevelt strenuously opposed the Bonus Bill that would give World War I veterans a cash bonus. Congress finally passed it over his veto in 1936, and the Treasury distributed $1.5billion in cash as bonus welfare benefits to 4million veterans just before the 1936 election.|$|E
25|$|In Europe, right-wing {{populism}} {{often takes}} the form of distrust of the European Union and of politicians in general combined with anti-immigrant rhetoric and a call for a return to traditional, national values. In the United States, the Tea Party movement states that the core beliefs for membership are the primacy of individual liberties as defined in the Constitution, small federal government and respect for the rule of law. Some policy positions include an opposition to illegal immigration, a strong national military force, the right to individual gun ownership, cutting taxes, reducing government spending and <b>balancing</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget.</b>|$|E

Paul stated that Treasury Secretary James Baker should be removed from his office for the administration's monetary policy.|$|R
25|$|In the 1994 midterm elections, Republicans ran on a {{platform}} that included fiscal responsibility drafted by then-Congressman Newt Gingrich called the Contract with America, which advocated such things as <b>balancing</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget,</b> providing the president with a line-item veto, and welfare reform. After the elections gave the Republicans {{a majority in the}} House of Representatives, newly minted Speaker of the House Gingrich pushed aggressively for reduced government spending, which created a confrontation with the White House that climaxed in the 1995–1996 government shutdown. After Clinton's re-election in 1996, they were able to cooperate and pass the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, which lowered the top capital gains tax rate from 28% to 20% and the 15% rate to 10%.|$|E
25|$|After {{narrowly}} {{winning the}} Republican gubernatorial primary in 2002, Pawlenty won a three-way election for Governor of Minnesota, and was re-elected in 2006 {{by a margin}} of less than one percent. His campaign platform focused on <b>balancing</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> without raising taxes. During Pawlenty's governorship, he did not raise income taxes, but did enact targeted increases in sales tax and user fees. His administration advocated for numerous public works projects, including work on the Northstar Commuter Rail Line, and the construction of Target Field, a Major League Baseball stadium in Minneapolis. He signed a bill mandating 20% ethanol in gasoline by 2013. He cut health care costs in an attempt to balance the budget, and borrowed funds from the state's K-12 education and low income programs. He signed an executive order rejecting federal funds related to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. He also led worldwide trips for business leaders and trade delegations to explore trade opportunities. In the 2007–2008 term, he served as chairman of the National Governors Association.|$|E

500|$|In 1993, Kemp, Bennett, Kirkpatrick and {{financial}} backer Theodore Forstmann co-founded {{the free market}} advocacy group Empower America, which later merged with Citizens for a Sound Economy to form Freedom Works. [...] Empower America represented the populist wing of the party: while avoiding divisive issues such as abortion and gay rights, it promoted free markets and growth over <b>balancing</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> and cutting the deficit. He resigned as Co-Chairman of Freedom Works in March 2005 after the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) questioned his ties to Samir Vincent, a Northern Virginia oil trader implicated in the U.N. Oil-for-food scandal who pleaded guilty to four criminal charges, including illegally acting as an unregistered lobbyist of the Iraqi government of Saddam Hussein. Testimony about Kemp became prominent in the trial. Also, FBI informant Richard Fino tied Kemp to James Cosentino just weeks before the 1996 election.|$|E
500|$|Although Daniels {{had claimed}} to be {{reluctant}} to seek higher office, many media outlets, including Politico, The Weekly Standard, Forbes, The Washington Post, CNN, The Economist, and The Indianapolis Star began to speculate that Daniels may intend to seek the Republican nomination for president in 2012 after he joined the national debate on cap and trade legislation by penning a response in The Wall Street Journal to policies espoused by the Democratic-majority Congress and the White House in August 2010. The speculation has included Daniels' record of reforming government, reducing taxes, <b>balancing</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget,</b> and connecting with voters in Indiana. Despite his signing into law of bills that toughened drug enforcement, regulated abortion, and a defense of marriage act, he has angered some conservatives because of his call for a [...] "truce" [...] on social issues so the party can focus on fiscal issues. His [...] "willingness to consider tax increases to rectify a budget deficit" [...] has been another source of contention.|$|E
500|$|Although {{he did not}} {{campaign}} or advertise, Perot won a {{large share}} of the vote in both the Democratic and Republican primaries in Oregon and Washington in mid-May. In the Oregon primary, he was written-in by 13% of Democrats and 15% of Republicans. Exit polling showed Perot's favorability at or above that of Clinton and Bush in their respective party's primaries. At the end of May, Perot called on Bush to [...] "climb in the ring", claiming that the President was using surrogates to attack him. To strengthen his own team, Perot's campaign interviewed Jimmy Carter's 1976 campaign manager and White House Chief of Staff Hamilton Jordan and [...] Ronald Reagan's 1984 campaign manager Ed Rollins to fill a position in the campaign. Eventually, both were hired as co-campaign managers. On May 29, Perot ended his talk show hiatus after talking with Barbara Walters on 20/20. He discussed his three-part plan for <b>balancing</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget,</b> starting with a Congressional act to limit spending, followed by a cut in government waste, of which he would be more specific in coming weeks, and a reform of the existing tax system. During the interview, Perot also stated that he would avoid adding homosexuals to his cabinet to prevent [...] "a point of controversy with the American people".

2500|$|Internal {{reorganization}} {{was only}} one of several major changes during Wilson's tenure, foremost among them the [...] "New Look" [...] defense concept. Eisenhower had criticized the Truman policies during the 1952 campaign, arguing that they were reactive rather than positive and that they forced the United States to compete with the Soviet Union on terms laid down by the Soviets. The president entered office with strong convictions about the need to reorient the nation's security policy, convictions reflecting his interest in maintaining a staunch defense while cutting government expenditures and <b>balancing</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget.</b>|$|E
2500|$|When Congress adjourned in August, 1960, many of {{its members}} {{undoubtedly}} rushed home to campaign for reelection. [...] Bill Milliken was no exception.

2500|$|Specifically, {{during the}} first four years of the new regime under a multiparty {{coalition}} government, from 1922 to 1925, the Fascists had a generally laissez-faire economic policy under the Finance Minister Alberto De Stefani, a former stalwart leader in the Center Party. [...] Free competition was encouraged. De Stefani initially reduced taxes, regulations and trade restrictions on the whole. De Stefani reduced government expenditure and balanced the budget. Some previous legislation introduced by the Socialists, such as the inheritance tax, was repealed. During this period prosperity increased and by mid-1920s industrial production had passed its wartime peak. However, this was accompanied with inflation. Overall, this was a period when Fascist economic policy mostly followed classical liberal lines, with the added features of attempting to stimulate domestic production (rather than foreign trade) and <b>balancing</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget.</b>|$|E
