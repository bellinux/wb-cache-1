On the other hand, even closely spaced <b>bungalows</b> make for quite low-density neighborhoods, contributing to urban sprawl. In Australia, <b>bungalows</b> have broad verandas to shade the interior from intense sun. But as a result they are often excessively dark inside, requiring artificial light even in daytime.|$|R
