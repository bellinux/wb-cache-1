25|$|Dai pai dong, open-air {{restaurants}} in a <b>big</b> <b>tent,</b> is another classic restaurant type {{that appeared in}} Wan Chai. Despite the often unclean and uncomfortable eating conditions, many people are attracted to the freshly made steamed rice roll, congee and chow mein early in the morning. Due to urban renewal projects in recent years, most of these restaurants are fading away.|$|E
25|$|The {{nature of}} {{elections}} also varies between nations. In the United States, negative campaigning and character attacks {{are more common}} than elsewhere, potentially suppressing turnouts. The focus placed on {{get out the vote}} efforts and mass-marketing can have important effects on turnout. Partisanship is an important impetus to turnout, with the highly partisan more likely to vote. Turnout tends to be higher in nations where political allegiance is closely linked to class, ethnic, linguistic, or religious loyalties. Countries where multiparty systems have developed also tend to have higher turnouts. Nations with a party specifically geared towards the working class will tend to have higher turnouts among that class than in countries where voters have only <b>big</b> <b>tent</b> parties, which try to appeal to all the voters, to choose from.|$|E
25|$|In August 2007, it was {{announced}} that Domo TV would premiere on the U.S. channel Nickelodeon in autumn of that year. The American release was pushed back multiple times, with Viacom Media Networks postponing the premiere to 2008. The first channels to launch Domo TV were Nickelodeon's international networks in Europe, Latin America, Australia, and New Zealand. Beginning in October 2008, the program was aired on Nicktoons in the United States. A new short was aired every week for six months. The New York-based company <b>Big</b> <b>Tent</b> Entertainment, which had previously collaborated with Nickelodeon on Miffy and Friends, handled marketing Domo TV outside of Asia. After the series finished airing, Domo programs (including the television spots that the title character originated in) had been shown in over 170 regions. The series itself had been translated into 17 different languages for various Nick outlets.|$|E

25|$|The words ‘cognitive’ and ‘biology’ {{are also}} used {{together}} as {{the name of a}} category. The category of cognitive biology has no fixed content but, rather, the content varies with the user. If the content can only be recruited from cognitive science, then cognitive biology would seem limited to a selection of items in the main set of sciences included by the interdisciplinary concept—cognitive psychology, artificial intelligence, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and cognitive anthropology. These six separate sciences were allied “to bridge the gap between brain and mind” with an interdisciplinary approach in the mid-1970s. Participating scientists were concerned only with human cognition. As it gained momentum, the growth of cognitive science in subsequent decades seemed to offer a <b>big</b> <b>tent</b> to a variety of researchers. Some, for example, considered evolutionary epistemology a fellow-traveler. Others appropriated the keyword, as for example Donald Griffin in 1978, when he advocated the establishment of cognitive ethology.|$|E

The church has denied practising proselytism among Christian people. However, after criticism of its methods the church became more discreet and avoided insisting publicly on miraculous healings, although it continued to highlight evangelization. In particular, it decided to stop proselytizing in hospitals, to discontinue loudspeakers in the streets, and to reduce the frequency of evangelization under the [...] "big top".|$|E
500|$|Antonio Cafiero, who {{had been}} elected {{governor}} of Buenos Aires Province, led the renewal of the PJ, and was considered their most likely candidate for the presidency. Menem, on the other hand, {{was seen as a}} populist leader. Using a <b>big</b> <b>tent</b> approach, he got support from several unrelated political figures. As a result, he defeated Cafiero in the primary elections. He sought alliances with Bunge and Born, union leaders, former members of Montoneros, and the AAA, people from the church, [...] "Carapintadas", etc. He promised a [...] "revolution of production" [...] and huge wage increases; but it was not clear exactly which policies he was proposing. The rival candidate, Eduardo Angeloz, tried to point out the mistakes made by Menem and Alfonsín.

Michael Cragg of The Guardian found its [...] "sheer musical scope" [...] "spellbinding". AllMusic writer Andy Kellman praised Monáe's creativity {{and called it}} [...] "an extravagant 70-minute album involving more imagination, conceptual detail, and stylistic turnabouts than most gatefold prog rock epics". Barry Walters of Spin noted German Expressionism and Afrofuturism as conceptual elements on the album and stated [...] "She's venturing {{so far away from}} soul that she's come back around to it". Chicago Tribune writer Greg Kot called it [...] "an audacious, sometimes bewildering statement". Jon Pareles of The New York Times commented that [...] "Monáe gets away with most of her metamorphoses, and the sheer ambition is exhilarating even when she stretches too far". Matthew Cole from Slant Magazine described it as [...] "an elaborately performed and consummately freaky cyberpunk epic... so stylistically leftfield in terms of its sound". The A.V. Clubs Genevieve Koski wrote that [...] "Monáe’s inexhaustible swagger and singular style sell both the high-concept theatrics and the schizophrenic sonics". Pitchforks Matthew Perpetua called the album [...] "about as bold as mainstream music gets, marrying the world-building possibilities of the concept album to the <b>big</b> <b>tent</b> genre-mutating pop of Michael Jackson and Prince in their prime".

2500|$|However {{controversy}} and internal party division for Brown and the Ontario PCs he leads continues unabated {{heading into the}} Ontario election 2018, rogue Ontario Progressive Conservative nominee for candidacy in Carleton [...] Jay Tysick, and a disgruntled group of former FCP and Ontario pro-life social conservative organizers [...] freshly successful from the Pierre Lemieux, Brad Trost, and Andrew Scheer federal Conservative leadership campaigns, decided {{to take over the}} Ontario Alliance [...] brand [...] formerly held by its current leader [...] and former Ontario Reform Party deputy leader, ag critic, and 2003 and 2007 candidate of record for Bruce—Grey—Owen Sound Bill Cook [...] and his fellow Ontario Reformers in the summer of 2017.

Brown backed up his talk with action, when he kicked Carleton—Mississippi Mills MPP and former OLA president Jack MacLaren out of the party after negative disparaging comments about Francophone language rights, MacLaren subsequently left the Ontario Tory caucus to cross the floor in joining the fledgling Trillium Party to become its first member in the Ontario Legislature. In a bid to become more modern, diverse, and inclusive, Brown and the new Ontario PCs arguably have become more exclusive, aiming to gain more urban seats in Toronto and win power, by only representing openly fiscally conservative and socially liberal viewpoints, the party has inadvertently left out social conservatives, civil libertarians, and democratic reformers whom all of which previously represented a large faction of the fiscally conservative in the party too. Meanwhile, the Reformers in Ontario, left without a provincial political party again for 2018, seemingly have split up into various schisms internally, with some of its general membership joining the regional sovereignist Northern Ontario Party [...] to protest their lack of electoral representation as grassroots Rural and Northern Ontarians without a political voice at Queen's Park, while some of its rank-and-file leadership has created a grassroots advocacy committee being the Ontario Progressive Democratic Reform Association to pressure the other mainstream Big Three parties towards a Reform Ontario agenda throughout the upcoming election campaign.|$|E
