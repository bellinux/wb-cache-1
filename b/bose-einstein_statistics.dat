5|$|The modern view {{on this is}} that photons are, {{by virtue}} of their integer spin, bosons (as opposed to fermions with half-integer spin). By the spin-statistics theorem, all bosons obey <b>Bose–Einstein</b> <b>statistics</b> (whereas all fermions obey Fermi–Dirac statistics).|$|E
5|$|In 1924, Einstein {{received}} {{a description of}} a statistical model from Indian physicist Satyendra Nath Bose, based on a counting method that assumed that light could be understood as a gas of indistinguishable particles. Einstein noted that Bose's statistics applied to some atoms {{as well as to the}} proposed light particles, and submitted his translation of Bose's paper to the Zeitschrift für Physik. Einstein also published his own articles describing the model and its implications, among them the Bose–Einstein condensate phenomenon that some particulates should appear at very low temperatures. It was not until 1995 that the first such condensate was produced experimentally by Eric Allin Cornell and Carl Wieman using ultra-cooling equipment built at the NIST–JILA laboratory at the University of Colorado at Boulder. <b>Bose–Einstein</b> <b>statistics</b> are now used to describe the behaviors of any assembly of bosons. Einstein's sketches for this project may be seen in the Einstein Archive in the library of the Leiden University.|$|E

25|$|In quantum statistics, <b>Bose–Einstein</b> <b>statistics</b> (or more colloquially B–E statistics) {{is one of}} two {{possible}} ways in which a collection of non-interacting indistinguishable particles may occupy a set of available discrete energy states, at thermodynamic equilibrium. The aggregation of particles in the same state, which is a characteristic of particles obeying <b>Bose–Einstein</b> <b>statistics,</b> accounts for the cohesive streaming of laser light and the frictionless creeping of superfluid helium. The theory of this behaviour was developed (1924–25) by Satyendra Nath Bose, who recognized that a collection of identical and indistinguishable particles can be distributed in this way. The idea was later adopted and extended by Albert Einstein in collaboration with Bose.|$|E

50|$|Because the {{particles}} cannot exchange places, {{one might expect}} their behaviour to be fermionic, {{but it turns out}} that their behaviour differs from that of fermions in several important ways: {{the particles}} can all occupy the same momentum state which corresponds to neither <b>Bose-Einstein</b> nor Fermi-Dirac <b>statistics.</b> This is the phenomenon of bosonization which happens in 1+1 dimensions.|$|R
25|$|Bosons {{are one of}} the two {{fundamental}} classes of particles, the other being fermions. Bosons are characterized by <b>Bose–Einstein</b> <b>statistics</b> and all have integer spins. Bosons may be either elementary, like photons and gluons, or composite, like mesons.|$|E

25|$|The <b>Bose–Einstein</b> <b>statistics</b> {{apply only}} to those {{particles}} not limited to single occupancy of the same state—that is, particles that do not obey the Pauli exclusion principle restrictions.

25|$|An ideal Bose gas is a quantum-mechanical {{phase of}} matter, {{analogous}} to a classical ideal gas. It {{is composed of}} bosons, which have an integer value of spin, and obey <b>Bose–Einstein</b> <b>statistics.</b> The statistical mechanics of bosons were developed by Satyendra Nath Bose for photons, and extended to massive particles by Albert Einstein who realized that an ideal gas of bosons would form a condensate at a low enough temperature, unlike a classical ideal gas. This condensate {{is known as a}} Bose–Einstein condensate.|$|E
25|$|Bose's {{interpretation}} {{is now called}} <b>Bose–Einstein</b> <b>statistics.</b> This result derived by Bose laid the foundation of quantum statistics, and especially the revolutionary new philosophical conception of the indistinguishability of particles, as acknowledged by Einstein and Dirac. When Einstein met Bose face-to-face, he asked him whether he had been aware that he had invented {{a new type of}} statistics, and he very candidly said that no, he wasn't that familiar with Boltzmann's statistics and didn't realize that he was doing the calculations differently. He was equally candid with anyone who asked.|$|E

5000|$|In {{more than}} two dimensions, the spin-statistics theorem states that any multiparticle state of indistinguishable {{particles}} has to obey either <b>Bose-Einstein</b> or Fermi-Dirac <b>statistics.</b> For any d > 2, the Lie groups SO(d,1) (which generalizes the Lorentz group) and Poincaré(d,1) have Z2 as their first homotopy group. Because the cyclic group Z2 is composed of two elements, only two possibilities remain. (The details are more involved than that, {{but this is the}} crucial point.) ...|$|R
25|$|Absolute, or thermodynamic, {{temperature}} is conventionally measured in kelvins (Celsius-scaled increments) {{and in the}} Rankine scale (Fahrenheit-scaled increments) with increasing rarity. Absolute temperature measurement is uniquely determined by a multiplicative constant which specifies {{the size of the}} degree, so the ratios of two absolute temperatures, T2/T1, are the same in all scales. The most transparent definition of this standard comes from the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution. It can also be found in Fermi–Dirac statistics (for particles of half-integer spin) and <b>Bose–Einstein</b> <b>statistics</b> (for particles of integer spin). All of these define the relative numbers of particles in a system as decreasing exponential functions of energy (at the particle level) over kT, with k representing the Boltzmann constant and T representing the temperature observed at the macroscopic level.|$|E
25|$|Protium is a spin 1/2 {{subatomic}} particle {{and is therefore}} a fermion. Other fermions include neutrons, electrons, and the radioactive isotope tritium. Fermions are governed by Pauli's exclusion principle, where no two particles can have the same quantum number. However, bosons like deuterium and photons, are not bound by exclusion and multiple particles can occupy the same energy state. This fundamental difference in 1H and 2H manifests in many physical properties. Integer spin particles like deuterium follow <b>Bose-Einstein</b> <b>statistics</b> while fermions with half integer spins follow Fermi-Dirac statistics. Wave functions that describe multiple fermions must be antisymmetric with respect to swapping particles, while boson wave functions are symmetric. Because bosons are indistinguishable and can occupy the same state, collections of bosons behave very differently than fermions at colder temperatures. As bosons are cooled and relaxed to the lowest energy state, phenomena like superfluidity and superconductivity occur.|$|E

Dutta (1962) for the Nobel Prize in Physics, for {{his contribution to}} <b>Bose–Einstein</b> <b>statistics</b> and the unified field theory. For instance, Kedareswar Banerjee, head of the Physics Department, University of Allahabad, in a letter of 12 January 1956 wrote to the Nobel Committee as follows: “(1). He (Bose) made very outstanding contributions to Physics by developing the statistics known after his name as Bose statistics. In recent years this statistics {{is found to be}} of profound importance in the classifications of fundamental particles and has contributed immensely in the development of nuclear physics. (2). During the period from 1953 to date he has made a number of highly interesting contributions of far-reaching consequences on the subject of Einstein’s Unitary Field Theory.” Bose's work was evaluated by an expert of the Nobel Committee – Oskar Klein, who did not see his work worthy of a Nobel Prize.|$|E
40|$|This book {{deals with}} {{theoretical}} thermodynamics and the statistical physics of electron and particle gases.

To calculate the free energy, the Gibbs method is applied to ideal and non-ideal gases, and also to a crystalline solid. Considerable attention is paid to the Fermi-Dirac and <b>Bose-Einstein</b> quantum <b>statistics</b> and its application to different quantum gases, and electron gas in both metals and semiconductors is considered in a nonequilibrium state.

Examples of non-relativistic bosonic fields include those describing cold bosonic atoms, such as Helium-4.|$|R
