5|$|Throughout the mid-2000s, MIS schemes, {{including}} those of Great Southern, attracted increasing investment, driven by tax advantages. Tax benefits for investors that had <b>been</b> <b>due</b> to expire in June 2006 were extended in the Howard government's 2005 budget to June 2008, and Great Southern {{was one of the}} beneficiaries of the decision.|$|E
5|$|According to the behind-the-scenes {{documentary}} {{portions of}} the film's DVD, there were slight continuity problems during the filming of the fight. This {{was said to have}} <b>been</b> <b>due</b> to the fact that real punches were thrown by both Stallone and Tarver, resulting in some swelling and nosebleeds earlier than scripted. The DVD release features an alternate ending in which Rocky wins the fight.|$|E
50|$|A {{review of}} common factors {{research}} in 2008 suggested that 30% to 70% {{of the variance}} in therapy outcome <b>was</b> <b>due</b> to common factors. A summary of research in 2014 suggested that 11.5% of variance in therapy outcome <b>was</b> <b>due</b> to the common factor of goal consensus/collaboration, 9% <b>was</b> <b>due</b> to empathy, 7.5% <b>was</b> <b>due</b> to therapeutic alliance, 6.3% <b>was</b> <b>due</b> to positive regard/affirmation, 5.7% <b>was</b> <b>due</b> to congruence/genuineness, and 5% <b>was</b> <b>due</b> to therapist factors; in contrast, treatment method accounted for roughly 1% of outcome variance.|$|R

5|$|Ain't meaning didn't {{is widely}} {{considered}} a feature unique to African American Vernacular English, although {{it can be found}} in some dialects of Caribbean English as well. It may function not as a true variant of didn't, but as a creole-like tense-neutral negator (sometimes termed generic ain't). Its origin may have <b>been</b> <b>due</b> to approximation when early African Americans acquired English as a second language; {{it is also possible that}} early African Americans inherited this variation from colonial European-Americans, and later kept the variation when it largely passed out of wider usage. Ain't is rarely attested for the present-tense constructions do not or does not.|$|E
5|$|Berhtwald's {{period as}} {{archbishop}} {{coincided with the}} end of Wilfrid's long struggle to regain the Bishopric of York, and the two-year delay between Theodore's death and Berhtwald's election may have <b>been</b> <b>due</b> to efforts to select Wilfrid for Canterbury. After his election, Berhtwald went to Gaul for consecration and then presided over two councils that attempted to settle the Wilfrid issue, finally succeeding at the second council in 705. Berhtwald also was the recipient of the first surviving letter close in Western Europe.|$|E
5|$|By 1915 when Tolkien {{was writing}} his first elven poems, the words elf, fairy and gnome had many {{divergent}} and contradictory associations. Tolkien had been gently warned against {{using the term}} 'fairy', which John Garth supposes may have <b>been</b> <b>due</b> to the word becoming increasingly used to indicate homosexuality, although despite this warning Tolkien continued to use it.|$|E

5|$|Choughs can be locally {{threatened}} by the accumulation of pesticides and heavy metals in the mountain soils, heavy rain, shooting and other human disturbances, but a longer-term threat comes from global warming, which would cause the species' preferred Alpine climate zone to shift to higher, more restricted areas, or locally to disappear entirely. Fossils of both chough species {{were found in the}} mountains of the Canary Islands. The local extinction of the Alpine chough and the reduced range of red-billed chough in the islands may have <b>been</b> <b>due</b> to climate change or human activity.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being more}} popular than some men's {{football}} events (one match saw a 53,000 strong crowd), women's football in England suffered a blow in 1921 when The Football Association outlawed the playing of the game on Association members' pitches, {{on the grounds that}} the game (as played by women) was distasteful. Some speculated that this may have also <b>been</b> <b>due</b> to envy of the large crowds that women's matches attracted. This led to the formation of the English Ladies Football Association and play moved to rugby grounds.|$|E
5|$|During {{the decline}} of the Roman Empire and the Early Middle Ages, much of the quality {{breeding}} stock developed during the classical period was lost due to uncontrolled breeding and had to be built up again over the following centuries. In the west, this may have <b>been</b> <b>due</b> in part to the reliance of the British and Scandinavians on infantry-based warfare, where horses were only used for riding and pursuit.|$|E

He narrowly defeated Thomas partisan Michael Jones {{by a vote of}} 23–19. This may have <b>been</b> <b>due</b> to the influence of the powerful Secretary of State Elias Kane, a Thomas ally.|$|E
5|$|Gaddafi {{was ready}} now for an {{offensive}}. The decisive offensive began in June, when a 3,000-strong GUNT force invested Faya-Largeau, the main government stronghold in the North, which fell on 25 June. The GUNT force rapidly proceeded towards Koro Toro, Oum Chalouba and Abéché, assuming {{control of the}} main routes towards N'Djamena. Libya, while helping with recruiting, training, and providing the GUNT with heavy artillery, only committed a few thousand regular troops to the offensive, {{and most of these}} were artillery and logistic units. This may have <b>been</b> <b>due</b> to Gaddafi's desire that the conflict be read as a Chadian internal affair.|$|E
5|$|Gregarious German {{cockroaches}} show different behavior when {{reared in}} isolation from when reared in a group. In one study, isolated cockroaches {{were less likely to}} leave their shelters and explore, spent less time eating, interacted less with conspecifics when exposed to them, and took longer to recognize receptive females. Because these changes occurred in many contexts, the authors suggested them as constituting a behavioral syndrome. These effects might have <b>been</b> <b>due</b> either to reduced metabolic and developmental rates in isolated individuals or the fact that the isolated individuals hadn't had a training period to learn about what others were like via their antennae.|$|E

5|$|In 1857, Rodin {{submitted}} a clay {{model of a}} companion to the École des Beaux-Arts {{in an attempt to}} win entrance; he did not succeed, and two further applications were also denied. Given that entrance requirements at the Grande École were not particularly high, the rejections were considerable setbacks. Rodin's inability to gain entrance may have <b>been</b> <b>due</b> to the judges' Neoclassical tastes, while Rodin had been schooled in light, 18th-century sculpture. Leaving the Petite École in 1857, Rodin earned a living as a craftsman and ornamenter for most of the next two decades, producing decorative objects and architectural embellishments.|$|E

5|$|In Spain, the red-billed chough has {{recently}} expanded its range by utilising old buildings, with 1,175 breeding pairs in a mi) study area. These new breeding areas usually surround the original montane core areas. However, the populations with nest sites on buildings {{are threatened by}} human disturbance, persecution {{and the loss of}} old buildings. Fossils of both chough species were found in the mountains of the Canary Islands.

5|$|Its {{large size}} may have <b>been</b> <b>due</b> to climactic factors and the {{abundance}} of large prey items, {{and it may have}} also been influenced by the evolution of regional endothermy (mesothermy) which would have increased its metabolism. However, since the Otodontidae sharks are considered to have been ectotherms, and megalodon was a close relative to them, megalodon may have also been ectothermic. Contrary to this, the largest contemporary ectothermic sharks, such as the whale shark, are filter feeders, implying some metabolic constraints with a predatory lifestyle. That is to say, it is unlikely that megalodon was ectothermic.|$|E
