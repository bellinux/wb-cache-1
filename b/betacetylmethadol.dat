50|$|<b>Betacetylmethadol</b> is a {{synthetic}} opioid. It is a diastereoisomer of alphacetylmethadol (as well as levacetylmethadol). In the United States, <b>betacetylmethadol</b> is a Schedule I drug Narcotic under the Controlled Substances Act, with an ACSCN of 9607 and a 2 gramme manufacturing quota as of 2014.|$|E
50|$|Betamethadol (INN), or β-methadol, {{also known}} as betametadol, is a {{synthetic}} opioid analgesic. It is an isomer of dimepheptanol (methadol), the other being alphamethadol (α-methadol). Betamethadol is composed of two isomers itself, L-β-methadol, and D-β-methadol. Based on structure-activity relationships it can be inferred that both isomers {{are likely to be}} active as opioid analgesics, similarly to those of <b>betacetylmethadol</b> (β-acetylmethadol).|$|E
50|$|In the United States, {{acetylmethadol}} and {{its individual}} isomers are all Schedule I drugs under the Controlled Substances Act, except LAAM, which is Schedule II {{and was used}} clinically until 1993. Acetylmethadol has an ACSCN of 9601. The isomers have individual ACSCNs, which are as follows: Alphacetylmethadol 9603, <b>Betacetylmethadol</b> 9607, LAAM 9648. All of the above have annual manufacturing quotas of 2 grammes as of 2013, except LAAM, which is 4 grammes.|$|E
50|$|Acetylmethadol (INN), {{also known}} as methadyl acetate (USAN), is a {{synthetic}} opioid analgesic. It is a racemic mixture of alphacetylmethadol (α-acetylmethadol) and <b>betacetylmethadol</b> (β-acetylmethadol), which are in turn racemic mixtures of levacetylmethadol (LAAM; L-α-acetylmethadol) and D-α-acetylmethadol and L-β-acetylmethadol and D-β-acetylmethadol, respectively. Hence, acetylmethadol has four possible optical isomers. All of these isomers {{have been shown to}} partially or fully substitute for the discriminative stimulus effects of heroin in rats, and thus it can be inferred that, in addition to LAAM which is used clinically as such, they are all likely to be active opioid analgesics in humans.|$|E
