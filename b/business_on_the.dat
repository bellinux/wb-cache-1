5|$|In {{contrast}} to the Civil War, when hostilities sharply curtailed <b>business</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Old Bay Line, World War I doubled freight and passenger <b>business</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> line to the busy ports of Norfolk and the Hampton Roads area, with 107,664 passengers using the line in 1917. As a result of congestion on the nation's railroads and ports when the U.S. entered the war in April 1917, the Federal government established the wartime U.S. Railroad Administration (USRA) {{to take charge of}} railroads and steamship companies, including the Baltimore Steam Packet Company. The USRA directed the operations of the Old Bay Line and the rival Chesapeake line {{for the duration of the}} war and more than a year thereafter, until March 1, 1920.|$|E

5|$|Baseball {{has also}} {{inspired}} {{the creation of}} new cultural forms. Baseball cards were introduced in the late 19th century as trade cards. A typical example would feature an image of a baseball player on one side and advertising for a <b>business</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other. In the early 1900s they were produced widely as promotional items by tobacco and confectionery companies. The 1930s saw the popularization of the modern style of baseball card, with a player photograph accompanied on the rear by statistics and biographical data. Baseball cards—many of which are now prized collectibles—are the source of the much broader trading card industry, involving similar products for different sports and non-sports-related fields.|$|E

5|$|In 1799, a schoolhouse was {{constructed}} on West Creek near Benton. It {{was one of}} the first schoolhouses in the vicinity of Benton. During the 1864 elections, at least two Union soldiers were stationed on the creek, guarding the polling venues. A mill called the Thomas Mill was built on the creek in 1865 and remained operational in 1914, when it was owned by N.B. Cole. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, there was a timber-producing <b>business</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> creek, run by J. Harvey Creveling.|$|E
5|$|The second rule of privity, that a {{third party}} cannot claim {{benefits}} from a contract, was widely criticised by academics, members of the judiciary and legal professionals. One {{problem was that the}} rule made no exceptions for cases where it was obviously intended for the third party to claim a benefit, such as in Beswick v Beswick, where an uncle gave his nephew a <b>business,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> condition that the nephew would pay the uncle a certain amount per week, and in the event of the uncle's death, give a similar amount to his widow.|$|E
5|$|Importing {{horses for}} use as general {{transportation}} and in army cavalries of Indian kingdoms was a flourishing <b>business</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> western seaboard. The forests were harvested for rich woods such as teak which was exported through ports located {{in the area of}} present-day Kerala. Song dynasty records from China mention the presence of Indian merchants in ports of South China, indicating active trade with overseas kingdoms. South India exported textiles, spices, medicinal plants, precious stones, pottery, salt made from salt pans, jewels, gold, ivory, rhino horn, ebony, aloe wood, perfumes, sandalwood, camphor and condiments to China, Dhofar, Aden, and Siraf (the entryport to Egypt, Arabia and Persia). Architects (Vishwakarmas), sculptors, quarry workers, goldsmiths and other skilled craftsmen whose trade directly or indirectly related to temple construction were also prosperous due to the vigorous temple building activities.|$|E

5|$|In Beswick v Beswick {{an uncle}} gifted his nephew a <b>business,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{condition}} that the nephew {{would pay the}} uncle (Mr Beswick) a certain amount per week, and {{in the event of}} the uncle's death, give a similar amount to his widow (Mrs Beswick). When the uncle died the nephew refused to pay the widow the money required, arguing that as she was not party to the original agreement she could not benefit from it. The Court of Appeal under Lord Denning tried to use {{this as an opportunity to}} claim that the doctrine of privity was invalid, something the House of Lords rejected. However, the Lords did agree that Mrs Beswick could sue, not as a third party to the contract but as the executrix of her husband's estate. As executrix she would be acting as a representative of Mr Beswick, and the doctrine of privity would not apply.|$|E
5|$|Purvis {{was born}} on July 4, 1857, into a family of Scottish descent. His parents were Robert Raaf Purvis and Annie Silburn Marshall. His {{paternal}} grandfather, William Purvis, {{who worked as a}} trader and ship captain, had settled in the Dutch East Indies in the 1810s while it was still part of the British Empire. The family lived in many places including Dutch East Indies, Brussels, and London. Educated at Cheltenham College and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, Edward William Purvis served as a sub-lieutenant of the 70th (Surrey) Regiment of Foot in Bengal, where he learned Hindi, and later as a sub-lieutenant for the 31st (Huntingdonshire) Regiment of Foot in Chatham, Kent. Around 1879 he resigned his British Army post and traveled to the Hawaiian Islands, where his father and older brother Robert William Theodore Purvis had already settled, having arrived on December13, 1877; his brother Theodore had started a sugar plantation <b>business</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> island of Kauai. A distant cousin of theirs was William Herbert Purvis, known for introducing macadamia nuts to Hawaii.|$|E

50|$|From the post-Civil War period up to 1899, {{perhaps the}} {{predominant}} tension in California politics was {{the struggle between}} a controlling group of railroad companies and large <b>businesses,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> one hand, and small farmers and <b>businesses</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other.
