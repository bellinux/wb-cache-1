5|$|Dracula's Daughter was {{the last}} in the first cycle of Universal Horror films that reached back into the 1920s. Publicly, Universal {{said it was because}} a British ban on horror films would cut too deeply into the revenue such films could generate. In truth, the cycle was {{suspended}} <b>because,</b> <b>just</b> before filming on Dracula's Daughter had wrapped, the Laemmle family had lost control of Universal. Because of cost overruns on a number of pictures, Junior Laemmle was forced to borrow $1,000,000 on November 1, 1935. The money came from J. Cheever Cowdin, head of the Standard Capital Corporation, and from Charles R. Rogers. When the loan was called in March of the following year, Universal was unable to repay it. Standard assumed control of the studio on March 4, 1936 and Rogers replaced Junior as head of production. Rogers did not like horror films and he shut down production on them following the release of Dracula's Daughter to focus on fare like Deanna Durbin musicals. Universal would not return to the horror genre for three years, when it released Son of Frankenstein in 1939.|$|E
5|$|O'Brien {{completed}} a hat-trick of breaststroke doubles at the 1965 Australian Championships, {{but in a}} year with no international competition, he swam much slower times of 1min 11.1s and 2min 38.6s respectively. He {{completed a}} fourth consecutive medley relay win with New South Wales. At the 1966 Australian Championships, his times were again slower, at 1min 11.8s and 2min 41.6s respectively, more than 4% slower than his personal bests, {{but it was still}} enough to retain his titles and qualify for the 1966 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Kingston, Jamaica. Critics had written him off, <b>because</b> <b>just</b> six weeks before the competition, he was 16kg overweight. However, he returned to his peak form by the time the team reached Jamaica, where he won both breaststroke events with times of 1min 8.2s and 2min 29.3s respectively. His winning run in the 4100m medley relay came to an end when the Australians were disqualified for an illegal changeover.|$|E

5|$|Secretary Stanton ordered McClellan {{to report}} to Trenton, New Jersey, for further orders, {{although}} none were issued. As the war progressed, there were various calls to return McClellan to an important command, following the Union defeats at Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville, as Robert E. Lee moved north {{at the start of}} the Gettysburg Campaign, and as Jubal Early threatened Washington in 1864. When Ulysses S. Grant became general-in-chief, he discussed returning McClellan to an unspecified position. But all of these opportunities were impossible, given the opposition within the administration and the knowledge that McClellan posed a potential political threat. McClellan worked for months on a lengthy report describing his two major campaigns and his successes in organizing the Army, replying to his critics and justifying his actions by accusing the administration of undercutting him and denying him necessary reinforcements. The War Department was reluctant to publish his report <b>because,</b> <b>just</b> after completing it in October 1863, McClellan openly declared his entrance to the political stage as a Democrat.|$|E

25|$|By {{the end of}} the 18th century, {{a renewed}} {{interest}} in tobacco took hold. In turn, this meant more demand for tobacco from America again, and this meant a boom in increased slavery in the southern United States where tobacco was grown. Post American Revolution, tobacco skyrocketed in price. Wartime had a huge influence over the price of tobacco <b>because,</b> <b>just</b> prior to the Revolution, there was a small peak in price during the Seven Years' War when different cultures gained a desire for tobacco after fighting opponents who had been smoking it.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{limitation}} of the Sundarji doctrine was exposed on 13 December 2001, when five masked men attacked the Indian Parliament. Twelve people—including the five gunmen—were killed and 22 were injured. India suspected Kashmir based militant groups were behind this <b>because</b> <b>just</b> two months earlier, a similar assault {{was carried out by}} the Jaish-e-Mohammad on the Kashmir state assembly. India received credible evidence that Pakistani-sponsored militant groups Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad were behind the attack, prompting India to initiate Operation Parakram, the largest activation of its forces since the 1971 Bangladesh war.|$|E

[...] The {{decision to leave}} was driven by Columbia's promotion of By Your Side. According to band member Rich Robinson, [...] "That record was destined to fail <b>because...</b> <b>just</b> said, 'It's {{not going to do}} well... It's no use wasting time or money.'" [...] The band also was frustrated by the label's request for albums sounding similar to their first, 1990's Shake Your Money Maker.|$|E
500|$|After Lwaxana and Timicin {{spend an}} evening together, {{he tries to}} explain the custom of the Resolution. [...] He tells her that a fixed age had to be {{selected}} by the Kaelons <b>because</b> <b>just</b> randomly choosing a time to die would be heartless. Lwaxana finds the practice barbaric and refuses to accept the Kaelon tradition. [...] She tells Timicin how a Betazed woman on her planet successfully fought the tradition of wearing ornate wigs that contained live, captive birds. [...] It only took one courageous woman {{to step forward and}} end this cruel tradition. [...] Lwaxana also compares Timicin's plans to end his life with his research to save his star. If it is Timicin's time to die, Lwaxana argues, perhaps it is also time for his star to die as well, so why should he continue to try to prevent it? Timicin thinks about what Lwaxana has told him.|$|E
2500|$|To {{alleviate}} confusion, it {{is typical}} when publishing non-avoirdupois weights {{to mention the}} name of the system along with the unit.

It is <b>just</b> <b>because</b> {{he does not want to}} steal, because he does not covet his neighbour's goods, that he has captured the trick (oh, how we all long for it!), the trick of coveting his own goods. It is <b>just</b> <b>because</b> he does not want to commit adultery that he achieves the romance of sex; it is <b>just</b> <b>because</b> he loves one wife that he has a hundred honeymoons.

2500|$|While the theatre-going {{public may}} {{consider}} the Tony Awards {{to be the}} Oscars of live theatre, critics {{have suggested that the}} Tony Awards are primarily a promotional vehicle for a small number of large production companies and theatre owners in New York City.

[...] The producers [...] "accept the situation ... <b>because</b> <b>just</b> as much as actually winning a Tony, a performance that lands well with the viewing public can translate into big box-office sales."
