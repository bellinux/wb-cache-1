25|$|The Enhanced Mobility Package (EMP) option adds an uprated suspension, 4-wheel {{anti-lock}} brakes, a locking rear differential, <b>beadlock</b> tires, a {{tire pressure}} monitoring system and other upgrades. About 2,000 LSSV units {{have been sold}} to U.S. and international military and law enforcement organizations.|$|E
2500|$|Over the years, small {{incremental}} {{changes have}} been made to the Trail Teams Special Edition FJ Cruisers, such as changing the TRD alloy wheels to <b>beadlock</b> style TRD wheels on later years, and the availability of Toyota's CRAWL control feature as part of the Trail Teams package (2013 and 2014 automatic transmission only). The CRAWL control had been previously used on other 4-wheel drive vehicles from Toyota and Lexus to enhance off-road capabilities. Each year, the Trail Teams Special Edition is painted in one distinct color and is the only FJ variant (besides the TRD Special Edition units) offered in a monotone color scheme, rather than the traditional two-tone FJ Cruiser with the standard white painted roof (excluding standard production FJ Cruisers with the [...] "Iceberg White" [...] body). The Trail Teams variants are also the only FJ models to have body trim pieces blacked out from the factory including the mirrors, door handles, bumper caps, etc. Special design details also carry over to the interior such as color matched fabric inserts on the seats for specific years and special Trail Teams badges.|$|E
5000|$|An {{internal}} <b>beadlock</b> is {{very much}} like an inner tube within the tire that pushes the bead of the tire tight against the wheel. The internal <b>beadlock</b> is inflated via its own valve stem. The side of the <b>beadlock</b> closest to the tread, the [...] "case", has a layer of thick fabric, generally polyester, which keeps the <b>beadlock</b> from inflating too far up into the tire. This forces the sides into the tire which compresses the bead of the tire against the wheel.|$|E
50|$|Most {{standard}} <b>beadlocks</b> clamp {{only the}} outside bead {{because this is}} the side that comes unseated most often while off-roading.|$|R
50|$|Dodge Military trucks had {{the first}} <b>beadlocks,</b> called Combat Wheels; The 'combat wheels' were a divided-rim, that used a {{bolted-on}} retaining ring replacing the normal split ring wheels. They were designed for quick and easy tire replacement during combat, hence the name.|$|R
5000|$|Also {{referred}} to as [...] "simulated beadlocks". Streetlocks are a decorative element in which the wheel manufacturer casts or machines the appearance of bolt heads into the rim of a wheel. This provides the appearance of <b>beadlocks,</b> but no functional benefits beyond the internal bead seat common to automotive wheels.|$|R

50|$|A <b>beadlock</b> or bead lock is a {{mechanical}} device that secures the bead of a tire {{to the wheel}} of a vehicle. Tires and wheels are designed so that, when the tire is inflated, the tire pressure pushes the bead of the tire against the inside of the wheel rim so that the tire stays on the wheel and the two rotate together. In situations where tire pressure is insufficient to hold the bead of the tire in place, a <b>beadlock</b> is needed.|$|E
50|$|The Enhanced Mobility Package (EMP) option adds {{enhanced}} suspension, 4-wheel anti-lock brakes, a locking differential, on/off-road <b>beadlock</b> tires, a {{tire pressure}} monitoring system and other upgrades. About 2,000 LSSV units {{were sold to}} U.S. and international military and law enforcement organizations.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is common}} amongst drivers of {{off-road}} vehicles {{to decrease the}} air pressure in their tires. [...] This makes the tread of the tire spread out, creating more surface area for the tire's tread to grip the terrain. If the pressure is too low, {{there may not be}} enough pressure to keep the bead on the wheel, thus causing the bead to pop off the wheel; this {{is often referred to as}} [...] "losing a bead". <b>Beadlocks,</b> which clamp the bead on the wheel, are often used in this case.|$|R
50|$|Standard tires {{fitted to}} the MTVR are Michelin 1600 R20 XZL {{and with the}} {{exception}} of the MK36 wrecker variant, no spare is carried. Compensating for no spare is a runflat setting option on the CTIS. CTIS allows the driver to adjust tyre pressures to suit both payload and terrain conditions, from the driving seat. The two-piece bolt-together steel wheel rims are fitted with <b>beadlocks</b> for extreme low-pressure operations and tires will remain seated at pressures down to 10 psi. In the event that any one tire should fail totally, a limp-home facility allows for a second axle suspension unit to be raised and secured.|$|R
50|$|High {{traction}} {{is desired}} for tires for automobile dirt track racing, off-road racing, off-road vehicles, and off-road motorcycles, so their tread is therefore coarse. Nevertheless, some riders will lower the tire pressure {{to cause the}} tread to spread out and create a larger contact patch. This practice can create a safety hazard, as {{there may not be}} enough pressure to adequately secure the tire beads to the wheel. Reactive ground forces push a tire to one side or the other, especially the outside rear tire of a racing vehicle when it is turning in a corner of a track. This could cause a bead of the tire to come off the rim completely, or enough to cause partial loss of air. It is also possible for the tire to have more traction on the ground than there is friction between the tire and rim. In this case the wheel would slip around the tire beads without turning the tire. <b>Beadlocks,</b> of one form or another including adhesive, are therefore used to keep the beads of off-road tires firmly seated and prevent slip, even when inflation pressure is low.|$|R
50|$|Some {{off-road}} {{tires are}} designed to be used with low inflation pressure on difficult terrain, reducing their rigidity and allowing the tread to better conform to the terrain. Such a design may allow for use on a wider range of surfaces, but tubeless tires running under rated pressure run the risk of breaking their bead. A <b>beadlock</b> can be used to prevent this.|$|E
50|$|For {{motorcycle}} tires, {{a device}} {{similar to the}} internal <b>beadlock</b> of 4-wheel drive vehicles can be used. A special inner tube is inflated via its own valve stem to high pressure to push the bead of the tire tight against the wheel. Like the rim lock, this clamps both beads at once. The regular valve stem is used to inflate the tire to the desired pressure.|$|E
50|$|A common {{modification}} is to fit <b>beadlock</b> rims, {{which allow}} tire {{pressure to be}} lowered even further, without risking tire and rim separation. Upon entering the desert, {{it is common to}} meet with a pack of vehicles and a group leader before proceeding. The group leader then leads the pack through the stunts in single file. The main reason for this technique is to prevent vehicles from losing track of direction and getting lost.|$|E
5000|$|It {{included}} a 5.5 L V12 clean diesel engine with dual Garrett TR30R turbochargers rated [...] and 850 Nm, Xtrac six-speed sequential transmission, 9-inch rear axle, Fox Racing Shocks, KMC 17" [...] Custom Forged <b>Beadlock</b> wheels with BFGoodrich Baja KRT 37x13.5x17 tires, Lowrance 9200 GPS, Sparco Carbon Fiber Racing seats. It used mid-engine, {{rear wheel drive}} layout. The chassis and body were designed by Arciero Miller Racing and Volkswagen Design Center California respectively.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} styles of beadlocks. For 4-wheel drive vehicles, a ring {{with a number}} of bolts around the {{circumference}} is used to clamp the tire to the wheel. For motorcycles, a rim lock or bead stopper is a curved plate tightened by a single bolt. For both 4-wheel drive vehicles and motorcycles, a different style of <b>beadlock</b> can be used that is similar to an inner tube which is inflated to press the tire against the wheel.|$|E
50|$|The G63 AMG 6×6 is 5875 mm in length, 2110 mm {{in width}} and 2210 mm in height, having ground {{clearance}} of 460 mm and fording depth at 1000 mm. It has arch axles, almost {{similar to those}} fitted on Unimog vehicles. The vehicle was installed with 18-inch <b>beadlock</b> wheels wrapped with gummy 37-inch tires, 4196-mm wheelbase (front axle to rearmost axle) had 4105 kg of curb weight. The G63 AMG 6×6 could deliver 0-60 MPH in 7.8 seconds with a top speed limited to 100 MPH. It appears in the movie Beyond the Reach and also featured in Jurassic World.|$|E
5000|$|The race {{vehicles}} {{used at the}} King of the Hammers {{are known}} as Ultra 4 vehicles which are capable of speeds over 100 miles per hour for the desert sections, but still contain gear ratios of 100 to 1 or lower for technical rock crawling. This Ultra4 class is unlimited 4400, and every vehicle is custom fabricated by each team. Traditional design for the front drive-train is a straight axle design, but (IFS) or (Independent front suspension) is becoming a popular design for the high speeds achieved in the wide open plains of the desert. Most racers use highly modified engines that can have up to (800 hp). 40" [...] tires are common and racers use <b>beadlock</b> wheels.|$|E
50|$|A {{standard}} <b>beadlock</b> {{is designed}} to clamp the tire bead between an outer and an inner ring. The inner ring may be welded onto a standard wheel increasing wheel width by anywhere from 1½ to 2 inches or may be formed {{as part of the}} wheel when the wheel is made in the factory. The outer ring is then bolted onto the inner ring with the bead clamped between them. Anywhere between 16 and 32 bolts at around 10 ft·lbf are used around the circumference of the wheel to keep the clamp tight. The rings and bolts can cause problems with balancing the wheel and tire because all the added weight is on one side. This style is used exclusively for offroad use.|$|E
5000|$|A {{version of}} the G-Class CDI with five {{differential}} locks and six-wheel-drive, half a meter of ground clearance, twin-turbo V8 engine from G63 AMG, AMG SPEEDSHIFT PLUS 7G-TRONIC automatic transmission, increased ground clearance to 460 millimetres with diving depth increased to 1000 millimetres, 18-inch <b>beadlock</b> wheels, 37 x 12.5 x 18 inch all-terrain tyres, flared wheel arches in carbon fibre, rear load area with stainless-steel roll-over bar, four electrically adjustable, heated and ventilated individual seats, red or light brown exclusive [...] "designo" [...] leather interior upholstery, rear compartment with a special center console, the roof liner and pillars in Alcantara covering, rear panel trimmed in leather. The top speed is limited to 160 km/h and {{it is capable of}} reaching 100 km/h in around 7 seconds.|$|E
5000|$|Motorcycle tires use a {{different}} style of <b>beadlock,</b> {{also known as a}} rim lock or bead stopper. Motorcycle tire rim locks clamp both beads at once because the tire is narrow enough do this conveniently with one device, and also {{there is no such thing}} as an [...] "inside bead" [...] and [...] "outside bead" [...] on a motorcycle tire. A curved metal plate inside the tire presses both beads outward against the inside of the wheel rim to clamp both beads at once in one localized area. A threaded stem attached to the plate is placed through a hole in the [...] "well" [...] of the rim, with the plate inside the tire and the threaded stem on the outside. The rim lock is tightened using either a standard bolt that leaves the threads visible, or a special bolt that covers the threads. The threaded stem or special bolt is visible on the inner surface of the wheel and points towards the axle, just like the valve stem.|$|E

5000|$|In 2007 Bombardier renamed their {{all-terrain}} vehicle line {{of products}} Can-Am. Can-am Off-Road has seven models of ATVs, the Outlander, the Renegade, the Commander, The Maverick, the DS, the Traxter, the Quest, and the Rally. The Traxter and Quest ({{no longer in}} production) had two engine sizes 500cc and 650cc. The Rally (also no longer in production) was available with a 200cc engine. The Outlander is a utility style ATV available in multiple engine sizes, including 400cc and 450cc single cylinder and 500cc, 570cc, 650cc, 800cc, 850cc and 1000cc V-Twin engines. The Outlander MAX is available for 2-up riding and the Outlander X-MR is built specifically for mud riding. The Renegade is also available with multiple engine choices, a 500cc, 570cc, 800cc, 850cc or 1000cc V-Twin engine. The Renegade X-XC is a separate trim level built specifically for cross country racing. The Outlander 800R X-XC is {{a version of the}} Renegade with the same trim level for cross country racing and non-racing trail riding. The XT-P is the modern outlander XXC and features the XT package with front sway bar and <b>beadlock</b> wheels. The 1000cc engine was introduced into the quad classification in the 2012 model year for both the Outlander and the Renegade series. The DS has four engine choices, a 450cc, 250cc, 90cc and 70cc. A 650cc engine was once available but has since been discontinued. An [...] "X" [...] trim level is available for the DS-450 and the DS-90. The Commander is a SSV or Side by side introduced for 2010 with either 800cc or 1000cc engines. Commander has several trim levels, including XT, X and LTD (Limited) at the time the only engine option for the extra packages was the 1000. The XT had upgraded wheels, winch, front bumper and upgraded gauge and steering wheel. The X package had Bumpers, rock sliders, XT gauge and steering wheel, X package seats, and <b>beadlock</b> wheels. Commander Limited includes air ride suspension, an am/fm radio with four speakers, an iPod adapter,XT package and built-in touch screen GPS. All Can Am ATVs except the DS-70 and the DS-90 feature four-stroke Rotax engines. The maverick side by side was introduced {{to stand up to the}} commander's rival the Polaris RZR XP 900. The Maverick has an updated version of the commander's 1000cc V-Twin Rotax engine (1000R) this engine had a massive 101 horsepower. This was achieved by using high flow dynamics to increase exhaust and air flow. The maverick was a revolution into the horsepower triple digits. The maverick comes in 6 packages today (February 2014) Base, XRS, XRS DPS, XMR, X ds, and X ds Turbo.In the X ds lineup Can Am brought the first factory installed turbocharged engine to the industry. The turbo boosts the horsepower of the maverick from 101 horsepower to 121 horsepower.|$|E
5000|$|The Summit was {{introduced}} in early 2009 {{and is one of}} Traxxas' newest models. It is intended to be Traxxas' extreme terrain monster truck but is not a true rock crawler and does not fit into current Rock crawler classes. Many components are carried over from the E-Revo, including the chassis and major suspension and steering components, major transmission and drive line components, and the EVX-2 waterproof ESC with Low Voltage Detection. New components on the Summit included new 7 inch diameter [...] "Canyon AT" [...] soft all terrain style tires with soft foam inserts mounted on new 3.8 inch [...] "Geode" [...] <b>beadlock</b> style wheels, new front and rear remote locking differentials, new high articulation CV joints, Traxxas' new [...] "TQ4" [...] 4-channel transmitter, and a new 10 LED lighting system integrated into the bumpers with 4 white LEDs (for headlights) and 6 red LEDs (for tail lights). The Summit is powered by one of Traxxas' new [...] "Titan 775" [...] brushed 775 sized high torque fan-cooled motor. The transmission is a two-speed remote shifted unit with an ultra low ratio 70:1 first gear (for low speed climbing) and a 25:1 second gear (for higher speed off roading) Another feature is an integrated [...] "Exo-Cage" [...] external roll cage. Updates for 2010 included the TQ2.4 4-channel 2.4 GHz radio system. Updates for 2011 included Prographix-painted body, a 4-channel TQi 2.4 GHz radio system with available iPhone / iPod dock, and the addition of a version of the EVX-2 electronic speed control compatible with lithium-polymer batteries. A further revision in 2014 updated the radio to be compatible Traxxas Link Wireless Module which can be used with Android, iPhone, or iPod devices.|$|E
5000|$|Released in late 2009 the Traxxas Slash 4x4, a {{four-wheel drive}} one tenth scale short-course {{electric}} race truck and it features Traxxas' first all new one tenth scale platform since the Jato {{was introduced in}} 2005. Contrary to its name, the Slash 4x4 has almost no parts commonality with the two-wheel drive Slash, and the Slash VXL 1/16. The parts carried over from the two-wheel drive Slash to the Slash 4x4 are limited to the shocks, springs, and the rear drive shafts and axle carriers, otherwise, the Slash 4x4 is a completely new design from the ground up. Its central chassis is a semi rectangular unit molded from gray plastic featuring triangular reinforcements throughout. It also features a four-wheel independent unequal length double wishbone suspension with four oil filled coilover shocks and progressive rate springs in staggered lengths ("long" [...] up front; [...] "XXlong" [...] in back). The new suspension will also be capable of mounting front and rear sway bars (available as a Traxxas accessory). It is powered by the same [...] "Velineon 3500" [...] 10 turn 3500kV brushless motor and [...] "Velineon VXL-3S" [...] non-waterproof 320 (rated burst) amp brushless ESC as the two-wheel drive family VXL models. In February 2010 all versions of VXL systems were sold as waterproof, however the Slash 4x4 does not bear the VXL moniker like Traxxas' other Velineon powered models. The driveline design is very different than that featured on any other Traxxas model. The motor is mounted longitudinally in the M4 layout driving a spur gear that directly turns (no transmission), via a Revo spec slipper clutch, the main one piece hollow aluminum drive shaft. The drive shaft sends power {{to the front and}} rear viscous limited slip differentials, which send power to the wheels through plastic telescoping half shafts. The Slash 4x4 features a similar exterior appearance to the two-wheel drive Slash, including a similar short course style body, bumpers, nerf bars, and wheels. Other notable features include scale replica BFGoodrich Mud-Terrain T/A tires with white lettering, 2.2 inch satin chrome <b>beadlock</b> style [...] "SCT" [...] wheels, a new heavy duty ball bearing steering system, digital waterproof high torque steering servo, Traxxas high current connectors, 2.4Ghz radio system, and hex hardware used throughout. With the stock motor/ESC combo the claimed top speed is 35 to 65+MPH depending on the battery and gearing used. Traxxas also advertises the Castle Creations Mamba Monster Brushless system (featured on the E-Revo/E-Maxx Brushless Edition and available as a Traxxas accessory) as a direct [...] "drop in" [...] replacement for the stock Velineon system, and it is claimed to be capable of powering the Slash 4x4 to speeds in excess of 80MPH.|$|E
