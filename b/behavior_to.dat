5|$|A {{report in}} 1997 {{described}} use of sponges {{as a tool}} by bottlenose dolphins in Shark Bay in Western Australia. A dolphin will attach a marine sponge to its rostrum, which is presumably then used to protect it when searching for food in the sandy sea bottom. The behavior, known as sponging, has only been observed in this bay, and is almost exclusively shown by females. A study in 2005 concluded that mothers teach the <b>behavior</b> <b>to</b> their daughters, and that all the sponge-users are closely related, suggesting {{that it is a}} fairly recent innovation.|$|E
5|$|At {{least some}} wild {{bottlenose}} dolphins use tools. In Shark Bay, dolphins place a marine sponge on their rostrum, presumably {{to protect it}} when searching for food on the sandy sea bottom. This has only been observed in this bay (first in 1997), and is predominantly practiced by females. Sea otters are the only other known marine mammalian tool users. A 2005 study showed mothers most likely teach the <b>behavior</b> <b>to</b> their offspring, evincing culture (behavior learned from other species members).|$|E

Studies of brain function, such as memory and social behavior, often use rats and birds. For some species, behavioral research is combined with enrichment strategies for animals in captivity because it allows them to engage in a wider range of activities.|$|E
5|$|Farmers exploit {{flocking}} <b>behavior</b> <b>to</b> keep sheep {{together on}} unfenced pastures such as hill farming, {{and to move}} them more easily. For this purpose shepherds may use herding dogs in this effort, with a highly bred herding ability. Sheep are food-oriented, and association of humans with regular feeding often results in sheep soliciting people for food. Those who are moving sheep may exploit this behavior by leading sheep with buckets of feed.|$|E
5|$|Migration {{in birds}} is highly labile and is {{believed}} to have developed independently in many avian lineages. While it is agreed that the behavioral and physiological adaptations necessary for migration are under genetic control, some authors have argued that no genetic change is necessary for migratory <b>behavior</b> <b>to</b> develop in a sedentary species because the genetic framework for migratory behavior exists in nearly all avian lineages. This explains the rapid appearance of migratory behavior after the most recent glacial maximum.|$|E

5000|$|The {{ultimate}} attribution {{error is}} a systematic patterning of intergroup misattributions shaped {{in part by}} one's prejudices. Prejudiced individuals {{are more likely to}} attribute an outgroup member's negative <b>behaviors</b> <b>to</b> dispositional, internal (possibly genetically determined), causes. These same prejudiced individuals {{are also more likely to}} attribute outgroup member's positive behaviours to (a) [...] "exceptional case", (b) fluke or special advantage, (c) high levels of motivation, or (d) situational context causes. Through these explanations, a prejudiced individual may disassociate a positive behavior from an outgroup individual and their group. In comparison, one is more likely to attribute negative ingroup <b>behaviors</b> <b>to</b> external causes and positive ingroup <b>behaviors</b> <b>to</b> dispositional causes.|$|R
5|$|The {{individual}} animals need {{to express}} survival-promoting behaviors, such as seeking food, water, shelter, and a mate. The motivational {{system in the}} brain monitors {{the current state of}} satisfaction of these goals, and activates behaviors to meet any needs that arise. The motivational system works largely by a reward–punishment mechanism. When a particular behavior is followed by favorable consequences, the reward mechanism in the brain is activated, which induces structural changes inside the brain that cause the same <b>behavior</b> <b>to</b> be repeated later, whenever a similar situation arises. Conversely, when a behavior is followed by unfavorable consequences, the brain's punishment mechanism is activated, inducing structural changes that cause the <b>behavior</b> <b>to</b> be suppressed when similar situations arise in the future.|$|E
5|$|Genghis Khan was {{declared}} Khaghan in 1206. The Mongols had united under his leadership, and defeated the rival tribes of the steppes. In the same period, China {{was divided into}} three separate states. In the north, the Jurchen Jin dynasty controlled Manchuria and all of China north of the Huai River. The Tangut Western Xia ruled parts of the western China, while the Song Dynasty reigned over the south. The Mongols subjugated Western Xia in 1210. In that same year, the Mongols renounced their vassalage to the Jin. Hostilities between the Jin and Mongols had been building up. The Mongols coveted the prosperity of Jurchen territory. They may have also harbored a grudge against the Jin for assassinating Ambaghai, one of Genghis' predecessors, and for the Jin emperor Wanyan Yongji's rude <b>behavior</b> <b>to</b> Genghis when Wanyan Yongji was still a Jurchen prince.|$|E
5|$|In November 2009, Bieber {{collaborated with}} {{clothing}} retailer Urban <b>Behavior</b> <b>to</b> host the Urban Behavior Tour. It consisted of performances at five locations across five days. The first event {{was held on}} 1 November, at the Metropolis at Metrotown in Vancouver. The tour resumed on 3 November and continued through 6 November, during which dates he appeared at the West Edmonton Mall in Edmonton; the Centre Eaton in Montreal; the White Oaks Mall in London; and Vaughan Mills in Toronto. In December, Bieber traveled to Foxborough, Massachusetts and was featured as a guest performer for two dates of Taylor Swift's Fearless Tour. Bieber announced his My World Tour in March 2010, held in support of My World and his debut studio album My World 2.0. It started on 23 June at the XL Center in Hartford, Connecticut and concluded on 4 September at the Great Allentown Fair in Allentown, Pennsylvania. Bieber performed eighty-eight shows, sixty-seven of which became sold-out. In total, nearly 1.4 million tickets were sold, generating a revenue of over $53 million by its conclusion.|$|E

5|$|Kingdom Hearts is {{influenced}} by its parent franchise, Final Fantasy, and carries gameplay elements over into its own action-based, hack and slash system. The main battle party consists of three characters: Sora, Donald Duck, and Goofy. Sora is directly controlled by the player from a third person camera angle. All other party members are computer-controlled, though the player can customize their <b>behavior</b> <b>to</b> an extent through the pause menu. Donald and Goofy comprise the party in most areas, but nearly every level features a character who may replace them. For instance, Jack Skellington can join Sora's party in Halloween Town, but cannot accompany the player elsewhere. In some worlds, the party changes its appearance, has abilities unique to that world or both, can fly in Neverland, acquire aquatic forms in Atlantica which enable them to survive underwater, and gain Halloween costumes in Halloween Town {{to blend in with}} the locals.|$|E

She decides {{that she wants to}} buy her apartment and the one above her, and turn them into her dream home. When she learns that her neighbor, Brian (Nate Corddry), will not be bribed out of his apartment, she agrees to move in with him, seemingly to save money, hoping to drive him out with her behavior. At work, Liz is disgusted by her staff writer, Frank Rossitano (Judah Friedlander) peeing in bottles to stop global warming.

Lesbian relationships are also known in matrilineal societies in Ghana among the Akan people. In Lesotho, females engage in what is commonly considered sexual <b>behavior</b> <b>to</b> the Western world: they kiss, sleep together, rub genitals, participate in cunnilingus, and maintain their relationships with other females vigilantly. Since the people of Lesotho believe sex requires a penis, however, they do not consider their behavior sexual, nor label themselves lesbians.|$|E
50|$|People with {{obsessive-compulsive}} disorder (OCD) use safety <b>behaviors</b> <b>to</b> reduce their anxiety when obsessions arise. Common safety behaviors include washing hands {{more times than}} needed and avoiding potential contaminants by not shaking hands.

5|$|Of {{the many}} studies on behavior-based early {{intervention}} programs, most are case reports {{of up to}} five participants and typically examine a few problem behaviors such as self-injury, aggression, noncompliance, stereotypies, or spontaneous language; unintended side effects are largely ignored. Despite the popularity of social skills training, its effectiveness is not firmly established. A randomized controlled study of a model for training parents in problem behaviors in their children with AS showed that parents attending a one-day workshop or six individual lessons reported fewer behavioral problems, while parents receiving the individual lessons reported less intense behavioral problems in their AS children. Vocational training is important to teach job interview etiquette and workplace <b>behavior</b> <b>to</b> older children and adults with AS, and organization software and personal data assistants can improve the work and life management of people with AS.|$|E

5|$|Philosophy of {{psychology}} refers to {{issues at the}} theoretical foundations of modern psychology. Some of these issues are epistemological concerns about the methodology of psychological investigation. For example, is the best method for studying psychology to focus only on the response of <b>behavior</b> <b>to</b> external stimuli or should psychologists focus on mental perception and thought processes? If the latter, an important question is how the internal experiences of others can be measured. Self-reports of feelings and beliefs may not be reliable because, even in cases {{in which there is}} no apparent incentive for subjects to intentionally deceive in their answers, self-deception or selective memory may affect their responses. Then even in the case of accurate self-reports, how can responses be compared across individuals? Even if two individuals respond with the same answer on a Likert scale, they may be experiencing very different things.|$|E

5|$|Such a {{depiction}} {{is common}} in semitechnical and popular dinosaur literature. Robert T. Bakker has extended social <b>behavior</b> <b>to</b> parental care, and has interpreted shed allosaur teeth and chewed bones of large prey animals as evidence that adult allosaurs brought food to lairs for their young to eat until they were grown, and prevented other carnivores from scavenging on the food. However, there is actually little evidence of gregarious behavior in theropods, and social interactions {{with members of the}} same species would have included antagonistic encounters, as shown by injuries to gastralia and bite wounds to skulls (the pathologic lower jaw named Labrosaurus ferox is one such possible example). Such head-biting may have been a way to establish dominance in a pack or to settle territorial disputes.|$|E
5|$|Symbolic {{behavior}} is, perhaps, one of {{the most}} difficult aspects of modern human <b>behavior</b> <b>to</b> distinguish archaeologically. When searching for evidence of symbolic behavior in the MSA, there are three lines of evidence that can be considered: direct evidence reflecting concrete examples of symbols; indirect evidence reflecting behaviors that would have been used to convey symbolic thought; and technological evidence reflecting the tools and skills that would have been used to produce art. Direct evidence is difficult to find beyond 40ka, and indirect evidence is essentially intangible, thus technological evidence is the most fruitful of the three.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept for}} the episode {{developed}} from writer Jon Vitti {{coming up with}} a long list of bad things Bart would do for attention imagining the potential consequences. The only idea that developed into an interesting episode concept was Bart cheating on an IQ test. This idea was based on an incident from Vitti's childhood when a number of his classmates did not take an intelligence test seriously and suffered poor academic treatment because of it. Because Bart was already obviously unintelligent, Vitti reversed the problem for his episode. Vitti used all his memories of elementary school <b>behavior</b> <b>to</b> produce a draft script of 71 pages, substantially above the required length of about 45 pages.|$|E

40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{examined the}} relationship between prejudice and processing of Stereotypic information. Higher levels of prejudice were associated with greater attention to and more thorough encoding of stereotype-inconsistent than stereotype-consistent behaviors but only when processing capacity was plentiful (Experiments 1 and 3). High-prejudice participants attributed co nsistent <b>behaviors</b> <b>to</b> internal factors and inconsistent <b>behaviors</b> <b>to</b> external forces (Experiment 2). Together, these results suggest that high-prejudice people attend carefully <b>to</b> inconsistent <b>behaviors</b> <b>to</b> explain them away but only if they have sufficient resources to do so. Results also showed that low-prejudice but not high-prejudice participants formed individuated impressions by integrating the implications of the target's behaviors (i. e., individuating). High levels of prejudice appear to be associated with biased encoding and judgment processes that may serve to maintain stereotypes. Copyright 2005 by the American Psychological Association...|$|R
