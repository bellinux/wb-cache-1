5|$|The plates lie flat {{along the}} <b>back,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> shingle-like armor. This was Marsh's initial interpretation, {{which led to}} the name 'roof lizard'. As further and {{complete}} plates were found, their form showed they stood on edge, rather than lying flat.|$|E
5|$|Fans of the {{character}} set up campaigns to get Ford <b>back</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> main character later in season two or season three. They sent various petitions to the producers, cast and crew of Stargate Atlantis to change their minds. Fans of {{the character}} even put up a website under the name F.O.R.D., which in turn was also the name {{for one of the}} campaigns fighting for the revival {{of the character}}.|$|E

5|$|The {{great number}} of Russian horses {{captured}} as matériel during wartime became {{a threat to the}} Finnhorse's purebreeding: many Russian animals were stallions, {{and there was no way}} to ensure new owners would not crossbreed them with Finnhorses. For practical and political reasons, Soviet Russia would not accept these horses <b>back</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> part of Finland's massive war indemnity. Finnhorses however, were accepted as payment, and a total of 18000 animals were sold to Soviet Russia at low rates in 1947 and 1948. The best Finnhorses were not offered to the Soviets, however, and according to contemporary witnesses, many showy but otherwise useless horses ended up in Russia.|$|E
5|$|A {{week after}} being upset by LSU, Alabama {{returned}} to Bryant–Denny {{and began a}} three-game homestand to end the season by defeating long-time rival Mississippi State 30–10. The Crimson Tide took a 6–3 lead {{in the first quarter}} by trading field goals with the Bulldogs on a 36-yarder from Jeremy Shelley, a 24-yarder from Derek DePasquale and a 45-yarder from Cade Foster. In the second, Alabama reached the end zone {{for the first time on}} the evening after Greg McElroy hit Marquis Maze for a 45-yard touchdown reception and a 13–3 lead. After a punt on the next Bulldog series, an 80-yard Maze touchdown return was called <b>back</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of an illegal block on the play by Alex Watkins. On the next play, Mark Ingram took a short bubble screen pass from McElroy 78-yards for a 20–3 lead at the half.|$|E
5|$|After the Simpsons {{have left}} the museum, they head for Krusty Burger where they {{discover}} Krusty crying in a ball pit. Krusty is encouraged by them into making a comeback, and they inform him that they met an agent that can help him out. However, when they all go to Annie's office, Annie instantly recognizes Krusty and angrily slams the door before he {{gets a chance to}} enter. It is revealed that Annie was the one who discovered Krusty, became his first agent, and was responsible for his rise to success. They also had a romantic relationship together. However, once he achieved fame, Krusty fired Annie and replaced her with a more acclaimed agent, and as a result their relationship ended. Back in the present, he begs her to take him <b>back</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> client, and she eventually accepts.|$|E

5|$|Finn and Jake then {{attempt to}} find new homes. Initially {{they are unable to}} find a {{suitable}} home until they stumble upon a cave. They clean up the cave and hold a house-warming party, which Marceline crashes. She explains that the cave also belongs to her. Finn, having had enough starts a fight with Marceline, who grows into a huge demonic bat. After she seemingly kills Jake, Finn goes into a rage and violently punches Marceline, who promptly shape-shifts into her regular form and then kisses Finn on the cheek, making him blush. Jake—who was able to use his shape-shifting powers to save himself—runs over to Finn, and Marceline states that the fight they had was fun and {{that the two of them}} can have their old house <b>back,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> gift. Once Finn and Jake return to their old abode, they are promptly hypnotized by King Worm (voiced by Erik Estrada).|$|E
5|$|Fork-marked lemurs or fork-crowned lemurs are strepsirrhine primates; {{the four}} species {{comprise}} the genus Phaner. Like all lemurs, they are native to Madagascar, {{where they are}} found only in the west, north, and east sides of the island. They are named for the two black stripes which run up from the eyes, converge {{on the top of}} the head, and run down the <b>back</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> single black stripe. They were originally placed in the genus Lemur in 1839, later moved between the genera Cheirogaleus and Microcebus, and given their own genus in 1870 by John Edward Gray. Only one species (Phaner furcifer) was recognized, until three subspecies described in 1991 were promoted to species status in 2001. New species may yet be identified, particularly in northeast Madagascar.|$|E
5|$|Hardy gained {{attention}} for his high risk stunts in the TLC matches, making {{a name for}} himself {{as one of the most}} seemingly reckless and unorthodox WWF performers of his time. In 2001, Hardy received a push as a singles competitor, and he held the Intercontinental (defeating Triple H), Light Heavyweight (defeating Jerry Lynn) and Hardcore Championships (defeating Mike Awesome and Van Dam on two separate occasions). At the end of 2001, the Hardys began a storyline in which they began to fight, which led to Matt demanding a match at Vengeance, with Lita as the special guest referee. After Hardy beat Matt by pinfall at Vengeance, while Matt's foot was on the ropes, Hardy and Lita began feuding against Matt. In the middle of the feud, however, Hardy faced The Undertaker in a Hardcore Championship match and lost. After the match, The Undertaker was scripted to attack both Hardy and Lita, injuring them. On the next episode of SmackDown!, The Undertaker attacked Matt as well, also injuring him, in storyline. The Hardys and Lita were not seen again until the Royal Rumble, because WWF did not have another storyline for their characters. The Hardys later came <b>back</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> team, and there was never any mention of their previous storyline split.|$|E

5|$|He {{remained}} a starter with the Tigers {{to begin the}} 1956 season, but after struggling {{early in the season}} (he had a 1–3 record and a 6.12 ERA in his first four games) he was relegated to the bullpen. He spent most of the season in the bullpen, but due to injuries late in the season, Gromek was placed back in the starting rotation in August, getting a complete game win over the Senators in his first game <b>back</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> starter. He finished the season with a record of 8–6 and a 4.28 ERA in 40 games, 13 of them starts. Gromek was pulled in the third inning in his first start of 1957 and spent the rest of his tenure with the Tigers as a short-term reliever; in a May 2 game against the Red Sox, he was brought in solely to face one batter, Jackie Jensen. Due to arm trouble, he was released by the Tigers in August, and subsequently retired, finishing the year with a 6.08 ERA in 15 appearances.|$|E
5|$|Hsu {{described}} the localization {{work as a}} balancing act, and said that continuity and consistency was very important. To avoid situations where a small detail in one game is changed in localization, and then comes <b>back</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> major point in a sequel, Hsu avoided changing things unless necessary, such as when something in the original would not be understood by the target audience. One thing the localization team had {{to keep in mind}} was keeping the writing in-character: when substituting a Japanese joke with an English one, they had to consider whether it would be something that the character would say, and not simply that it was funny. They also worked towards having puns and references be appropriate for the dialogue, so that the dialogue still makes sense to players who do not get the reference or pun.|$|E
5|$|On {{his return}} to Britain in 1821, MacGregor claimed that King George Frederic Augustus of the Mosquito Coast in the Gulf of Honduras had created him Cazique of Poyais, which he {{described}} as a developed colony with an existing community of British settlers. When the British press reported on MacGregor's deception following the return of fewer than 50 survivors in late 1823, some of his victims leaped to his defence, insisting that the general had been let down by those whom he had {{put in charge of}} the emigration party. A French court tried MacGregor and three others for fraud in 1826 after he attempted a variation on the scheme there, but convicted only one of his associates. Acquitted, MacGregor attempted lesser Poyais schemes in London over the next decade. In 1838, he moved to Venezuela, where he was welcomed <b>back</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> hero. He died in Caracas in 1845, aged 58, and was buried with full military honours in Caracas Cathedral.|$|E

5|$|Phips {{arrived back}} in Boston {{in the summer}} of 1688 and was welcomed <b>back</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> hero. His wife seemed very happy to see him. He was celebrated in sermons and at the Harvard college {{commencement}} he was compared to Jason fetching the Golden Fleece. Andros and Randolph were not so happy to see him and it seems the feeling was mutual. Almost all of New England was unified in their opposition to Andros and Randolph. It is interesting to note here that Phips, despite having been captain of Randolph's gunship in '83-4, {{does not seem to have}} carried an association with Randolph in the minds of the people of Massachusetts Bay.|$|E
5|$|The character's backstory is {{explored}} {{throughout the}} sixth season of Desperate Housewives. Angela de Luca lived in New York City with her mother, Rose De Luca (Suzanne Costallos). At age eighteen, she {{dropped out of}} college, where she was enrolled as an engineering major, and joined a band of eco-terrorists, led by Patrick Logan (John Barrowman), with whom she became romantically involved. Patrick asked her to build a bomb {{that would be used}} against a corporate company. On November 10, 1991, the eco-terrorist group bombed a building that was supposedly empty; however, they unintentionally killed a man named Shawn. Angela sustained a large scar on her <b>back</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of the explosion. Consumed with guilt over having killed an innocent man, Angela agreed to run away with a private investigator (Jeffrey Nordling) who had been pursuing the terrorist group. Later, Angie discovered she was pregnant with Patrick's child. She and the private investigator raised Patrick's son as their own and moved several times, living under various aliases, in an attempt to evade both Patrick and the FBI.|$|E
5|$|Two months later, Whitney {{returns and}} she helps the Carters repair their new till. Johnny offers her {{the chance of}} moving back into the Vic, which Whitney accepts. Mick also offers her her old job <b>back</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> barmaid and Whitney accepts this too. However, Shirley warns Whitney {{to stay away from}} Mick and she tells Shirley that she cannot stop her from being at the Vic. In private, Whitney reveals to Mick that she is engaged to Woody and she shares the news with her family and friends. She asks Mick to give her away and he agrees. Mick struggles with Woody's presence, but agrees to get on with him for Whitney's sake and Whitney admits to Mick {{although}} she can't be with him, she loves him. Linda throws her out after she figures out she's the one Mick kissed and Whitney moves in with Stacey, Stacey's husband and Bianca's relative, Martin Fowler (James Bye) and their kids. Mick takes the rest of her stuff round and offers her £200 in lieu of lost wages but she tells him to keep his dirty money, annoyed with him revealing all.|$|E
