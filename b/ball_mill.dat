25|$|When the Basinghall Mining Syndicate {{took over}} the mine in 1936 all the old {{equipment}} in the mill was removed and a completely new electrically-powered plant was designed for high production rates. The entire output of the mine was crushed in a <b>ball</b> <b>mill</b> {{to the size of}} fine sand before being passed into a bank of froth flotation cells. In these, organic oils and acids caused the galena particles to become attached to rising air bubbles to form a grey foam which overflowed a weir at the top. These gave a good separation: concentrates averaged 75% galena and the waste tailings only 0.2% galena. The concentrate was dried, conveyed to ore-bins and then hand-loaded onto lorries for carriage to smelting mills at Ryton near Newcastle upon Tyne. However the <b>ball</b> <b>mill</b> was unable to cope with the high volumes of ore in the early 1940s. New concentrating tables were introduced. By the 1950s these processed 60% of the ore and produced concentrates of 82% galena. The remaining 40% of ore went to the <b>ball</b> <b>mill</b> and froth flotation plant.|$|E
25|$|Mining {{operations}} use crushers, commonly {{classified by}} {{the degree to which}} they fragment the starting material, with primary and secondary crushers handling coarse materials, and tertiary and quaternary crushers reducing ore particles to finer gradations. Each crusher is designed to work with a certain maximum size of raw material, and often delivers its output to a screening machine which sorts and directs the product for further processing. Typically, crushing stages are followed by milling stages if the materials need to be further reduced. Additionally rockbreakers are typically located next to a crusher to reduce oversize material too large for a crusher. Crushers are used to reduce particle size enough so that the material can be processed into finer particles in a grinder. A typical processing line at a mine might consist of a crusher followed by a SAG mill followed by a <b>ball</b> <b>mill.</b> In this context, the SAG mill and <b>ball</b> <b>mill</b> are considered grinders rather than crushers.|$|E
25|$|For {{the most}} {{powerful}} black powder, meal powder, a wood charcoal, is used. The best wood for the purpose is Pacific willow, but others such as alder or buckthorn can be used. In Great Britain between the 15th and 19th centuries charcoal from alder buckthorn was greatly prized for gunpowder manufacture; cottonwood {{was used by the}} American Confederate States. The ingredients are reduced in particle size and mixed as intimately as possible. Originally, this was with a mortar-and-pestle or a similarly operating stamping-mill, using copper, bronze or other non-sparking materials, until supplanted by the rotating <b>ball</b> <b>mill</b> principle with non-sparking bronze or lead. Historically, a marble or limestone edge runner mill, running on a limestone bed, was used in Great Britain; however, by the mid 19th century this had changed to either an iron-shod stone wheel or a cast iron wheel running on an iron bed. The mix was dampened with alcohol or water during grinding to prevent accidental ignition. This also helps the extremely soluble saltpeter to mix into the microscopic nooks and crannies of the very high surface-area charcoal.|$|E

40|$|A surfactant-assisted high-energy <b>ball</b> <b>milling</b> {{technique}} {{was employed to}} synthesize Nd 2 Fe 14 B/alpha-Fe nanoparticles and nanoflakes from melt-spun nanocrystalline powders. The microstructure evolution in <b>ball</b> <b>milling</b> process was investigated. In the beginning stage (0 - 4 h) of <b>ball</b> <b>milling,</b> raw powders were crushed into micrometre-sized particles. While flakes were mainly formed by reducing thickness of particles via peeling layer by layer along preferential planes in the late stage (8 - 16 h). The {{selected area electron diffraction}} and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy images show that preferential cleavage planes are basal planes. With <b>ball</b> <b>milling</b> proceeding, more and more defects were induced by <b>ball</b> <b>milling.</b> As a result, the coercivity and remanence decreased to 1. 6 kOe and 3. 2 kGs, respectively. After 16 h <b>ball</b> <b>milling,</b> the exchange decoupling occurred due to severe amorphorization. A weakly-textured nanocomposite magnet was fabricated after 12 h <b>ball</b> <b>milling</b> and the anisotropy in magnetic properties can be further improved by employing settling down process to select particle size and aligning particles in external field.

50|$|Aside from common {{ball mills}} {{there is a}} second type of <b>ball</b> <b>mill</b> called a {{planetary}} <b>ball</b> <b>mill.</b> Planetary ball mills are smaller than common ball mills and mainly used in laboratories for grinding sample material down to very small sizes. A planetary <b>ball</b> <b>mill</b> consists of at least one grinding jar which is arranged eccentrically on a so-called sun wheel. The direction of movement of the sun wheel is opposite to that of the grinding jars (ratio: 1:-2 or 1:-1 or else).The grinding balls in the grinding jars are subjected to superimposed rotational movements, the so-called Coriolis forces. The difference in speeds between the balls and grinding jars produces an interaction between frictional and impact forces, which releases high dynamic energies. The interplay between these forces produces the high and very effective degree of size reduction of the planetary <b>ball</b> <b>mill.</b>|$|E
