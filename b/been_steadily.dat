5|$|By 1957 {{the synagogue}} sanctuary, {{which had been}} {{designed}} for 350 families, had become too small to accommodate Temple Israel's over 1,100 member families. In addition, since the 1950s Memphis's Jewish community had <b>been</b> <b>steadily</b> moving from the downtown, where Temple Israel's Poplar Avenue building was located, to the eastern suburbs; by 1957 {{over half of the}} members, and three-quarters of those with children in the congregational school, lived there. School attendance increased rapidly, and the student body soon outgrew its 1951 building. The school had to split attendance in 1959, with the younger children attending on Saturday and the older ones on Sunday, and by 1961, 780 children were enrolled. In the early 1960s, Temple Israel began holding weekday classes at Beth Sholom, which was closer to most members.|$|E
5|$|Following the 25 June 1950 {{invasion}} of the Republic of Korea (South Korea) by its northern neighbor, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea), the United Nations decided to commit troops to the conflict on behalf of South Korea.

5|$|Innocent {{gave some}} dispensations as the crisis progressed.

The rules on burials and lay access to churches appear to have <b>been</b> <b>steadily</b> circumvented, at least unofficially. Although the interdict was a burden {{to much of the}} population, it did not result in rebellion against John. By 1213, though, John was increasingly worried about the threat of French invasion. Some contemporary chroniclers suggested that in January Philip II of France had been charged with deposing John on behalf of the papacy, although it appears that Innocent merely prepared secret letters in case Innocent needed to claim the credit if Philip did successfully invade England.|$|E

A low pressure area to its west over Cuba had <b>been</b> <b>steadily</b> intensifying and building toward the surface, and on October 9 it developed into a tropical depression; the cyclone became the dominant system, eventually becoming Marco, and Klaus dissipated {{under the influence of the}} system late on October 9.

U.S. forces in the Far East had <b>been</b> <b>steadily</b> decreasing {{since the end of}} World War II, five years earlier, and Shadrick's division was the closest to the warzone. Under the command of Major General William F. Dean, the division was understrength and most of its equipment was antiquated due to reductions in military spending. In spite of these deficiencies the division was ordered into South Korea, tasked with taking the initial shock of the North Korean advances until the rest of the Eighth United States Army could arrive and establish a defense.|$|E

However, in the late 15th century the Kaqchikel rebelled against their former K'iche' allies and founded a new kingdom to the southeast with Iximche as its capital. In the decades before the Spanish invasion the Kaqchikel kingdom had <b>been</b> <b>steadily</b> eroding the kingdom of the K'iche'.
