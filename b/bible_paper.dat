Greene's aim, as detailed in his Kickstarter campaign video, was to enhance the experience of reading biblical literature by giving the content a more novel-like form, omitting chapter and verse numbers and annotation, utilizing a sewn binding and opaque book paper (rather than <b>Bible</b> <b>paper),</b> and creating original typefaces optimized for legibilty, among other features.|$|E
50|$|President Arnold Maremont {{declared}} in January 1957 {{that it was}} possible the company could double its size within a year and intimated that other paper companies could be acquired. By 1958 the corporation was specializing in three areas of production: book papers, business papers and school supply papers. The Allied book paper lines then included grades from the thinnest <b>bible</b> <b>paper</b> to heavy book paper for novels. Business papers include forms, mimeo, duplication and offset for reproduction machines, bond, carbon insets and special coated papers for electrostatic office copiers. School supply papers include notebook filler, construction and drawing paper, pads, envelopes and reproduction and typing papers. Also in early 1957 Allied announced they would build a large new pulp mill {{on the north side of}} Cork St in Kalamazoo but this addition never occurred. Bryant Mills A and B continued to be used to de-ink waste paper for use as stock in the Kalamazoo paper mills. This use of recycled paper would cause huge problems for the corporation in future years. Included in the recycled paper was carbonless copy paper manufactured by the National Cash Register (NCR) Company and this paper contained toxic polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).|$|E

40|$|By {{investigating}} {{the language of}} neighbourliness and friendship in English translations of the Hebrew <b>bible,</b> the <b>paper</b> reflects on concepts derived from the bible and their significance in early modern English culture and thought. It shows how interpersonal relationships in the biblical text were understood by English translators within a world view shaped by their contemporary notions of community life. Protestant translators from Tyndales version to King Jamess not only drew on the original Hebrew and Greek, but also re-wrote key phrases in terms that spoke to the linguistic and cultural norms of their own society. These were further propagated in religious didactic literature and in secular text, spreading further the 'Anglicisation' of the Hebrew Bible...|$|R

40|$|The Bible {{has been}} the largest selling book title in the world. However, very little {{research}} of Bible binding techniques has been done. Most Bibles contain more than two thousand pages of <b>Bible</b> <b>paper.</b> Therefore, such books are usually thick and heavy. Thin bible papers provide very little strength for the joint.

The spine lining and endpaper reinforcement are two most important factors of joint construction. Loose back and tubular lining are techniques used to reinforce adhesion of the bookblock to the cover.

40|$|Economics {{is widely}} {{accused of being}} a portrayer of a dark and dismal image of human nature (i. e. its model of homo economicus as a self-interested, even selfish and {{opportunistic}} maximizer of its own gains). This paper argues that the model of homo economicus is not an empirical or prescriptive image of human nature but a useful, “heuristic”, methodical instrument for economic theorizing (in our case, for the economic study of religion that connects to the Hebrew <b>Bible).</b> The <b>paper</b> demonstrates that in generic, methodological perspective, the model of homo economicus compares well to similarly unrealistic, “dismal” models of human nature in other disciplines that study religion. I develop these arguments by focusing on selective stories from Genesis, especially the stories of Jacob.

40|$|This article extends prior {{work on the}} {{political}} theory of the Hebrew <b>Bible.</b> Previous <b>papers</b> presented the Garden of Eden story as a prolegomenon outlining concepts of legitimate authority; {{the stories of the}} Dark Age and the Flood as justifying the role of government and law in human society; the accounts of the Patriarchs as an exploration of patriarchal organization; and the early chapters of the book of Exodus as comparing and contrasting nomadism, dependency, slavery and nationhood as models of political organization. The present paper examines the biblical author’s ideas about selfgovernances as a step towards the achievement of nationhood. Key elements of selfgovernance are a population to be organized, a need for organization, a leader capable of performing the organizing task, and political action to establish the group’s autonomy. The author provides a remarkably sophisticated treatment of charismatic leadership and the tension between the leader’s personal and political identities. ...|$|R

2500|$|On December 15, 1884, {{the society}} was {{incorporated}} as Zion's Watch Tower Tract Society in Pennsylvania as a non-profit, non-stock corporation with Russell as president. The corporation {{was located in}} Allegheny, Pennsylvania.

The charter provided for a board of seven directors, three of who served as officers—a president, vice-president (initially William I. Mann) and secretary-treasurer (initially Maria Russell). The charter stipulated that the officers be chosen from the directors and be elected annually by ballot. Board members would hold office for life unless removed by a two-thirds vote by shareholders. Vacancies on the board resulting from death, resignation or removal would be filled by a majority vote of the remaining board members within 20 days; if such vacancies were not filled within 30 days an appointment could be made by the president, with the appointments lasting only until the next annual corporation meeting, when vacancies would be filled by election.|$|R
