50|$|In Paon’s {{contributions}} to the Donkey Kong franchise, K. Rool {{has been given a}} more cartoony appearance. His golden <b>belly</b> <b>plate</b> is now tan-colored skin, his tail has been removed, and his crown is much smaller. This incarnation of K. Rool also makes an appearance in Mario Super Sluggers for the Wii, wearing Maya king attire and wielding a green sceptre.|$|E
50|$|In {{his debut}} appearance, King K. Rool is {{depicted}} an obese Kremling {{who wears a}} red cape, golden wristbands, a golden <b>belly</b> <b>plate,</b> and a gold crown. He was designed by Steve Mayles, an artist that worked at Rare and brother of Rare designer Gregg Mayles. In later appearances, K. Rool’s attire changes depending on which persona he’s masquerading as. His aliases include Kaptain K. Rool, Baron K. Roolenstein, and King Krusha K. Rool. K. Rool has also been seen piloting a variety of vessels, including Gangplank Galleon, a large pirate ship in Donkey Kong Country, the Flying Kroc, a steampunk inspired flying machine in Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy’s Kong Quest, and the Knautilus, a fish-shaped submarine in Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong’s Double Trouble!.|$|E
5000|$|Completely harmless, and {{a member}} of the {{colubrid}} family, it is easily mistaken for other garter snake species. It has a greenish-black back with a distinctive bright-orange or red stripe down the center and yellowish stripes on either side of the body that extend through the second, third, and fourth rows of scales above the <b>belly</b> <b>plates.</b> [...] Adults range in length from 38 to 71 cm.|$|R
50|$|A steel {{footbridge}} carries walkers and cyclists {{across the}} concrete piers of the barrage on the Teesdale Way, {{part of the}} National Cycle Network.The footbridge consists of two parts, a steel footbridge across the concrete piers and a hydraulically operated single-leaf steel bascule across the lock to allow river craft to pass.Although the public cannot gain {{direct access to the}} barrage itself, the footbridge affords excellent views of the fish <b>belly</b> <b>plates</b> and hydraulics.|$|R
50|$|The {{concrete}} {{base of the}} barrage is 70 m wide, 32 m long, and 5 m thick; it is supported by five concrete piers.In between the piers are four 8 m tall, 50 tonne fish <b>belly</b> <b>plates</b> to control the flow of water, operated by 21 tonne hydraulic rams.The 600 ton road bridge is of a tubular steel arched viaduct design specified at 45 units of HB motorway loading.The bridge has eight welded tubular steel arches each 17.5 m wide with a 5 m rise but only the four central arches actually cross {{the waters of the}} river Tees.The arches are sprayed with green chlorinated rubber paint and are sealed against corrosion.Some 16,500 cubic metres of reinforced concrete and 650 tons of structural steel went into the building of the barrage.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{supposedly}} unique feature originally identified {{from the}} type specimen was {{the presence of}} armor <b>plating</b> on the <b>belly.</b> A large segment of {{what appeared to be}} the bone from a flat osteoderm covered the underside of the abdomen. This had a surface structure covered with small hexagonal and rhombic bumps. Such plates had never been found with other ankylosaurians, and it has been suggested that, if L. paradoxus was indeed aquatic, the <b>belly</b> <b>plates</b> may have protected it from predators attacking from below, as in modern turtles. Smaller triangular osteoderms were found on the shoulder, including a small shoulder spike. However, closer examination of the bumps seemed to suggest that they were not sculpted onto a single piece of bone, but instead resembled normal dinosaurian scales. The broken edges of the supposed plates, when studied in 2013 by paleontologist Victoria Arbour and colleagues, did not reveal any internal structure as would be expected from a piece of bone. Arbour and colleagues concluded that the [...] "belly plates" [...] were likely to be pieces of preserved skin.|$|R
50|$|Development {{started in}} 1941 under M.A.N., which took {{inspiration}} from their VK 30.02 design, creating {{an even more}} armoured, albeit smaller, vehicle, with 80mm sloped frontal armour (at the time the Panther prototype only had 60mm frontal armour). As the Panther project gained importance, Wa Pruef 6 decided to remove the VK 16.02 project from M.A.N. to help them meet deadlines for the Panther project, handing it to MIAG and Daimler-Benz, with competence on the hull to MIAG and on the turret and armament to Daimler-Benz.Two variants were initially being designed, a lighter one weighing 18-tons and a heavier one weighing 26-tons, but in June 1942 Hitler decided to only continue development on the heavier one, as he deemed protection from enemy anti-tank guns a priority.In July 1942 MIAG presented a more refined design that was accepted into production, which was planned to start in April 1943, with plans of 20 vehicles per month starting from October 1943.In a meeting on the 13 October 1943, Hitler was informed the lighter variant design was preferred by the troops, as it would better fit the reconnaissance role, while the heavier design had too similar characteristics to the Panther, with the only difference being the smaller gun. Hitler agreed to only develop the lighter variant.The final design had a combat loaded weight of 21.9 metric tons. The armor was 50 mm sloped at 50 degrees on the front, 30 mm on the sides and rear, 16mm deck and from 16 to 25 mm <b>belly</b> <b>plates.</b> The planned armament was the 5 cm Kw.K.39/1 L/60 cannon, the same that was used on late Pz IIIs. The engine was the Maybach HL 157 rated at 550 horsepower. In order to increase cross-country performance, the VK 1602 was fitted with 660 mm wide tracks, the same that were used on the Panther.|$|R
5000|$|It {{has been}} {{known for a long time}} that the shape, or arching, as well as the {{thickness}} of the wood and its physical qualities govern the sound of a violin. The sound and tone of the violin is determined by how the <b>belly</b> and back <b>plates</b> of the violin behave acoustically, according to modes or schemes of movement determined by German physicist Ernst Chladni. Patterns of the nodes (places of no movement) made by sand or glitter sprinkled on the plates with the plate vibrated at certain frequencies are called [...] "Chladni patterns", and are occasionally used by luthiers to verify their work before assembling the instrument. A scientific explanation includes a discussion of how the properties of the wood determine where the nodes occur, whether the plates move with end or diagonally opposite points rising together or in various mixed modes.|$|R
5000|$|T-62M (Ob'yekt 166M) (1983) - Extensive {{modernization}} of the T-62 with protection and mobility improvements and the [...] "Volna" [...] fire control system. It is {{fitted with a}} BDD appliqué armour package, an additional <b>belly</b> armour <b>plate</b> for anti-mine protection, 10 mm thick reinforced rubber side skirts and 10 mm thick anti-neutron liner. The BDD appliqué armour package was specially designed to defeat shaped charges (for example RPGs) and consists of an appliqué plate on the glacis and two horseshoe shaped blocks fitted {{to the front of}} the turret. The handrails around the turret have been removed to make space for the bra appliqué armour. Fastenings for four spare track chain links have been added on the side of the turret. The tank is fitted with RhKM tracks from the T-72 main battle tank and two additional shock absorbers on the first pair of roadwheels. The [...] "Volna" [...] fire control system was improved by fitting the KTD-2 (or KTD-1) laser rangefinder in an armoured box over the main armament. There is a new TShSM-41U gunner's sight, new commander's sight, [...] "Meteor-M1" [...] stabiliser, BV-62 ballistic computer and 9K116-2 [...] "Sheksna" [...] (NATO: AT-10 Stabber) guided missile unit with 1K13-BOM sight (it is both a night sight and ATGM launcher sight. However, it cannot be used for both functions simultaneously) which allows the tank to fire 9M117 Bastion ATGMs through its gun tube. The tank was fitted with a gun thermal sleeve, new radios, the R-173 radio set instead of R-123M and a new V-55U diesel engine developing 620 hp (462 kW). The ammunition load was increased by two rounds. Some are fitted with two clusters of four smoke grenade launchers each on the right rear of the turret. The US intelligence saw T-62M main battle tanks for the first time during the Soviet war in Afghanistan and they gave it the designation T-62E. There are a number of sub-variants of the T-62M, depending on how much of the modernization package the vehicle has installed.|$|R

50|$|When it was discovered, the 16.5 inch {{figure had}} been crushed flat {{by the weight}} of the soil above it and its inner wooden core had decomposed. This wooden core had been finely cut for the face and legs, but the body had been more roughly modelled. Woolley used wax to keep the pieces {{together}} as it was excavated, and the figure was gently pressed back into its original shape. The ram's head and legs are layered in gold leaf which had been hammered against the wood and stuck to it with a thin wash of bitumen, while its ears are copper but which are now green with verdigris. The horns and the fleece on its shoulders are of lapis lazuli, and the body's fleece is made of shell, attached to a thicker coat of bitumen. The figure's genitals are gold, while its <b>belly</b> was silver <b>plate,</b> now oxidised beyond restoration. The tree is also covered in gold leaf with gold flowers. The figure stands on a small rectangular base decorated with a mosaic of shell, red limestone and lapis lazuli. The figure was originally attached to the flowering shrub by silver chains around its fetlocks, but these chains have completely decayed. It is thought that the two figures originally faced each other as confronted animals, and that the tubes going up from their shoulders were used to support something, probably a bowl or similar object.|$|R
