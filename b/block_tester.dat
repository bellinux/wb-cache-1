40|$|This paper {{concerns}} the requirement analysis {{and implementation of}} a measurement instrument, which can identify the 3 -D magnetostriction strain. To measure magnetostriction, a high-accuracy magnetic flux density and strain measurement are required, while the mechanical stress in the sample is minimized. The full <b>block</b> <b>tester</b> is proposed as a measurement instrument. In this instrument, homogeneity of flux density within the measured sample and the strain measurement resolution are sufficient, but stress caused by magnetic forces is higher than required...|$|E
50|$|Measuring {{devices and}} {{instruments}} are categorized {{according to the}} physical quantities {{they are designed to}} measure. These vary internationally, e.g., NIST 150-2G in the U.S. and NABL-141 in India. Together, these standards cover instruments that measure various physical quantities such as electromagnetic radiation (RF probes), time and frequency (intervalometer), ionizing radiation (Geiger counter), light (light meter), mechanical quantities (limit switch, pressure gauge, pressure switch), and, thermodynamic or thermal properties (thermometer, temperature controller). The standard instrument for each test device varies accordingly, e.g., a dead weight tester for pressure gauge calibration and a dry <b>block</b> temperature <b>tester</b> for temperature gauge calibration.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The AK Block is a snow test {{developed}} {{and used by}} the Southeast Alaska Avalanche Center staff over a 20 -year period. It is a block sized to the tester’s weight and their ski or snowboard contact length, dug out on three sides. It is loaded {{in the same manner}} as the Rutschblock, but tests slab properties as well as shear strength. The AK Block can be done quickly by one person using a shovel, a tool to lay out the <b>tester’s</b> <b>block</b> width and length (tape, rule, or marked probe, cord, ski, snowboard, or pole), and skis or a board to load the block. It has a large sample area and gives direct sensory feedback. The sized block may allow direct comparison between <b>blocks</b> by <b>testers</b> of different weights. The first systematic testing of the AK Block, in the Chugach Mountains near Valdez, Alaska in the 2002 - 2003 winter and in the Coast Mountains near Juneau, Alaska in the 2003 - 2004 winter, is reported here. An unusually strong snowpack limited our data sample, so this is a preliminary report. The initial results are promising though, and we are recruiting other workers to help us gather more data...|$|R
40|$|Coverage testing techniques, such as {{statement}} and decision coverage, {{play a significant}} role in improving the quality of software systems. Constructing a thorough set of tests that yield high coverage, however, is often avery tedious, time consuming task. In this paper we present a technique to find a small subset of a program's statements and decisions with the property that covering the subset implies covering the rest. We introduce the notion of a mega block which is a set of basic blocks spanning multiple procedures with the property that one basic block in it is executed iff every basic block in it is executed. We also present an algorithm to construct a data structure called the global dominator graph showing dominator relationships among mega <b>blocks.</b> A <b>tester</b> only needs to create test cases that are aimed at executing one basic block from each of the leaf nodes in this directed acyclic graph. Every other basic block in the program will automatically be covered by the same test set...|$|R
40|$|Given {{samples from}} an unknown {{discrete}} distribution p, {{is it possible}} to distinguish whether p belongs to some class of distributions C versus p being far from every distribution in C? This fundamental question has received tremendous attention in statistics, focusing primarily on asymptotic analysis, as well as in information theory and theoretical computer science, where the emphasis has been on small sample size and computational complexity. Nevertheless, even for basic properties of discrete distributions such as monotonicity, independence, logconcavity, unimodality, and monotone-hazard rate, the optimal sample complexity is unknown. We provide a general approach via which we obtain sample-optimal and computationally efficient testers for all these distribution families. At the core of our approach is an algorithm which solves the following problem: Given samples from an unknown distribution p, and a known distribution q, are p and q close in x[superscript 2]-distance, or far in total variation distance? The optimality of our testers is established by providing matching lower bounds, up to constant factors. Finally, a necessary building <b>block</b> for our <b>testers</b> and an important byproduct of our work are the first known computationally efficient proper learners for discrete log-concave, monotone hazard rate distributions...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work is to {{determine}} the influence of technologically produced boron surface layers on the friction parameters in the sliding pairs under mixed friction conditions. The current boronizing processes allow obtaining surface layers of high hardness and high resistance to corrosion and wear, with low brittleness and no tendencies towards cracking However, the operation characteristics of these layers depend on the chemical composition, the structure of the surface layer, the method and parameters of their production, as well as any possible thermal treatment. The tribological evaluation included ion nitriding, powder-pack boronizing, laser boronizing, hardening and tempering surface layers and TiB 2 coating deposited on ring samples. The ring samples were made from 38 CrAlMo 5 - 10, 46 Cr 2 and 30 MnB 4 steel. Modified surface layers of ring samples were matched under test conditions with counter-sample made from AlSn 20 bearing alloy. Tested sliding pairs were lubricated 15 W/ 40 Lotos mineral engine oil. The tribological tests were conducted on a T- 05 <b>block</b> on ring <b>tester.</b> The applied steel surface layer modification with boron allow creating surface layers with pre-determined tribological characteristics required for the elements of kinematic sliding pairs operating under mixed friction conditions. Boronizing reduces the friction coefficient during the start-up of the frictional pair and the maximum start-up resistance level is similar to the levels of pairs with ion nitride surface layers...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} what effects a self-rewaard procedure involving the visualization of a pleasant scene had upon three operationally defined depressive behaviors. The three depressive behaviors were subjects' average self-confidence ratings, estimates of the rate of external reinforcement, and self-evaluations of their performance on a word association task. According to the self-reinforcement model of depression, a person becomes depressed as a result of a breakdown in any of the three stages, self-monitoring, self-evaluation, and self-reward of the self-reinforcement process. In an attempt to examine the role of self-rewards in modifying the three depressive behaviors, a high rate of self-rewarding behavior was used within a design previously utilized by Wener and Rehm (1975). Subjects in the self-reward treatment were hypothesized to manifest a statistical increase in the three depressive behaviors when compared to subjects in the no self-reward treatment. Furthermore, depressed subjects were hypothesized to be statistically lower on the three depressive behaviors than nondepressed subjects. Finally, no statistical difference on the three depressive behaviors was hypothesized when males were compared to females. Students in undergraduate psychology and general education courses at a Midwestern university were solicited as subjects for the study. A total of 380 students volunteered for the study and completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Based on their BDI scores, 96 subjects were selected with equal numbers of depressed and nondepressed, males and females. Just prior to the experimental procedure, subjects completed the BDI for a second time. Due to a shift in depression scores between initial and second presentations, 10 subjects were deleted from the study while another 11 subjects were deleted as a result of visualizing the self-rewarding scene when not requested thus changing the self-reward rate for the no self-reward treatment. The final sample size was 73. During the experimental procedure all subjects were asked to construct a pleasant scene based on their responses to the Reinforcement Survey Schedule while only the self-reward treatment subjects were requested to use the scene. After subjects gave a response to the cue word, they were asked how confident they were of their response. The other two dependent variables were obtained by asking, at the conclusion of the word association task, how well they felt they had done and how many times they were correct. Statistical processing of the data consisted of two, three-factor, non-orthogonal analyses of variance with the third factor (<b>tester)</b> <b>blocked.</b> All factors were reordered to determine their independent contribution. The first analysis eras multivariate in nature since both the average self-confidence rating and estimate of the rate of external reinforcement were used. The second analysis was univariate in nature since only self-evaluation was used. The use of a self-reward procedure involving the visualization of a pleasant scene was found to increase only subjects’ estimates of the rate of external reinforcement. No effects were found for average self-confidence ratings and self-evaluations. Thus, the self-reward procedure appeared to effect perceptions but not variables more centrally related to the self-concept, also, the self-reward procedure did not affect people in the same manner as external reinforcement. Depressed females had significantly lower self-confidence ratings and self-evaluations then nondepressed females, which lent support to the cognitive and self-reinforcement models of depression. Finally, as a result of a difference in depression levels between males and females, the validity of assuming males and females to express their depression in a similar manner was questioned.
