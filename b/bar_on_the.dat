5|$|The ruff has a {{distinctive}} gravy boat appearance, {{with a small}} head, medium-length bill, longish neck and pot-bellied body. It has long legs that are variable in colour but usually yellow or orange. In flight, it has a deeper, slower wing stroke than other waders of a similar size, and displays a thin, indistinct white <b>bar</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wing, and white ovals {{on the sides of}} the tail.|$|E
5|$|As {{the apex}} of the Canadian system of honours, the Victoria Cross is to be worn before all other Canadian decorations and {{insignia}} of orders, including the Order of Merit and the Order of Canada. It is worn as a medal, suspended from a medal <b>bar</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left chest, unless protocol calls for a ribbon bar, which consists of a crimson ribbon with a miniature bronze Victoria Cross at its centre. Should an individual receive multiple awards of the Victoria Cross, additional bronze medal bars are added to the ribbon and further miniatures are placed evenly on the ribbon bar, reflecting the number of crosses the wearer has earned.|$|E
5|$|In 2005 {{and after}} having been vacant for many years, a {{renovation}} began to convert the 10-story building into 96 loft condominiums, while adding two floors to the annex. In July 2008, the residents sued the <b>bar</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{first floor of the}} building for its noise pollution, resulting in the relocation of the bar in February 2009. Among the current and past owners of the building's loft condominiums are Dave Navarro, Jason Statham, Danny Masterson, and Charlize Theron.|$|E
5000|$|Like {{other members}} of the genus, it is {{distinctive}} for its striking colouration. The species is primarily black with two silvery transverse <b>bars</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> thorax and three silvery transverse <b>bars</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> abdomen. <b>The</b> silvery transverse <b>bars</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> abdomen are narrow, never reaching the discal setae.Antennae are inserted at two-thirds eye depth, and reach a little way beyond half the distance to the oral margin ...|$|R
50|$|The adult female {{is equally}} striking, with black-and-rufous-banded upperparts, and white underparts with some black <b>bars</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> chest and flanks. Young birds are duller than the adult {{of the same}} sex, have a brown and orange bill, and dusky <b>barring</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> underparts.|$|R
50|$|Trigonospila are strikingly {{patterned}} flies; primarily {{black with}} pearly whitish to golden transverse <b>bars</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> thorax and abdomen. There are two whitish <b>bars</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> thorax; one {{adjacent to the}} transverse suture, and the second adjacent to the scutellum. There {{may also be a}} white triangle <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tip of the scutellum, and the subscutellum is usually white. Abdominal colouration varies between species however it is typical that there are three whitish <b>bars</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> abdomen; one at the anterior margin of each the third, fourth, and fifth abdominal tergites. The width of these bars differs between species.|$|R
5|$|Although the LNC {{proposed}} {{to convert the}} cemetery branch line into a grand avenue running from Brookwood station through the cemetery, this never took place. The rails and sleepers of the branch were removed in around 1947, and the trackbed became a dirt road and footpath. The run-around loop and stub of the branch line west of Brookwood station remained operational as sidings, before being dismantled on 30 November 1964. After {{the closure of the}} branch line the buildings of the two cemetery stations remained open as refreshment kiosks, and were renamed North Bar and South <b>Bar.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> retirement in 1956 of a Mr and Mrs Dendy, who operated North Bar from 1948 to 1956 and lived in the station apartment, North station was abandoned, and demolished in the 1960s owing to dry rot. South Bar continued to operate as a refreshment kiosk.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, Double Tee Promotions {{acquired}} {{control of}} Roseland's operations. In December 1995, The Oregonian {{reported that the}} company and its president, David Leiken, would be purchasing and renovating the building over several months. Leiken founded Double Tee, which produces events throughout the Pacific Northwest and continues to manage Roseland, in 1972. The project, which included purchase of the building, new lounges and restrooms, and a ventilation system, was estimated to cost between $1.75million and $2million. The size of the street-level floor would also increased to accommodate an additional 350–440 guests, replacing a small club called the Garden. The renovation project ended in 1997; Leiken updated the building's facade and opened a nightclub and sports <b>bar</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lower level. Roseland remained open during the renovation, which reportedly cost around $2.5million.|$|E
5|$|The game's central {{location}} is the Mos Eisley Cantina, a spaceport <b>bar</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> planet Tatooine. At the counter, the player may use their Lego studs to purchase characters, vehicles, gameplay hints and extras, or activate cheat codes. In {{a small area}} outside the cantina, players may view collected vehicles. The game is broken into levels, which are accessed from the cantina; each film is represented by six levels, representing key locations and scenes in that film. The locations include Hoth, Bespin, Dagobah, Tatooine, the Death Star, and Endor. The game also features bonus levels. During levels, the player defeats enemies, builds objects out of Lego bricks and drives vehicles, Certain levels are played entirely while piloting vehicles, including a TIE fighter, a Snowspeeder, and the Millennium Falcon. Levels must first be played in Story Mode. This unlocks the next level {{as well as a}} Free Play mode for the recently completed level. Gameplay is identical in the two modes. However, Story Mode restricts playable characters to those followed in the film scenes the levels are based on, while Free Play offers all those unlocked. Levels can be replayed in either mode to collect studs and secret items.|$|E

5|$|Wear of the {{insignia}} is {{according to}} guidelines {{issued by the}} Chancellery of Honours, which stipulate that the badges be worn before most other national orders—that is, {{at the end of}} an individual's medal bar closest to the centre of the chest or at the wearer's neck—with only the Victoria Cross, the Cross of Valour, and the badge of the Order of Merit permitted to be worn before the badges of the Order of Canada. Those in the grades of Companion or Officer may wear their badges on a neck ribbon, while those in the Member group display their insignia suspended by a ribbon from a medal <b>bar</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left chest. Protocol originally followed the British tradition, wherein female appointees wore their Order of Canada emblem on a ribbon bow positioned on the left shoulder. These regulations were altered in 1997, and women may wear their insignia in either the traditional manner or in the same fashion as the men.|$|E
5|$|The game {{takes place}} within the fictional {{universe}} in which prior Traveller releases are also set. The most significant power in this universe is the human-dominated Imperium which predominates across thousands of inhabited solar systems. Bordering the regions controlled by the Imperium are other interstellar powers including the Zhodani Consulate. The Imperium and the Zhodani {{have a long history}} of tense relations and, as the game begins, rumors of another frontier war are circulating. Against this backdrop, a security agent working for Sharushid, a large corporation active throughout the Imperium, discovers that a company sub-sector chief named Konrad Kiefer is secretly aiding the Zhodani by smuggling arms across the border into the hands of dissidents in preparation for an uprising within the Imperium to be coordinated with a Zhodani attack. This security agent encounters five experienced adventurers in a <b>bar</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> planet Efate and entrusts them with evidence of Kiefer's treachery. These adventurers are tasked with delivering the evidence to a second Sharushid agent located in another solar system and ultimately with stopping Kiefer and his conspiracy against the Imperium. The player assumes control over the party just after the security agent entrusts it with the evidence against Kiefer.|$|E

25|$|The {{matrices}} have {{a pattern}} of teeth at the top, by which they hang from the distributor bar. Some of the teeth are cut away; which pattern of teeth is cut away depends on the character on the matrix; i.e.,which channel in the magazine it belongs in. Similarly, teeth are cut away along portions of the distributor bar. The <b>bar</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> elevator has all teeth, so it will hold any matrix (but not the space bands, which have no teeth at all).|$|E
