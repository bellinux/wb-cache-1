25|$|Assembling a {{comprehensive}} Jacques Brel discography is difficult, because his recordings {{have been released}} {{in so many different}} permutations, in different countries and in different formats. Furthermore, releases of Brel's recordings are sometimes known by different titles. This discography is restricted to Brel's original albums, as collected and reissued on 23 September 2003 in the sixteen CD box set of his work Boîte à <b>Bonbons,</b> plus the additional album Chansons ou Versions Inédites de Jeunesse, which was released {{for the first time as}} part of this box set. The titles listed here are the titles used in the box set. To mark the 25th anniversary of Brel's death, Barclay Records issued Comme quand on était beau (2003), a 3 volume DVD collection of Brel interviews and live performances as well as the compilation album Infiniment (2004). Both releases include five previously unpublished songs that Brel wrote in 1977: La Cathédrale, L'Amour est mort, Mai 40, Avec Élégance, and Sans Exigences.|$|E

2500|$|In January 1967, Brel {{finished}} recording {{songs for}} a new studio album, Jacques Brel 67, which was released later in the year. The album included [...] "Mon Enfance" [...] (My childhood), [...] "Fils de..." [...] (Sons of...), [...] "Les <b>bonbons</b> 67" [...] (The candies 67), and [...] "La Chanson des vieux amants" [...] (Song of the old lovers). In late January, he returned to Carnegie Hall and gave one final performance. While in New York, he went to see Man of La Mancha, a musical based on Cervantes's novel Don Quixote, at the ANTA Washington Square Theatre in Greenwich Village. Moved by the experience, he began planning a French language production of the musical for Europe. He returned to France in the spring and, on 16 May 1967, he gave his final concert performance in Roubaix in northern France.

2500|$|The Passage des Panoramas, {{opened at}} the very end of the 18th century, was a model for the new Parisian covered {{shopping}} street, where shoppers did not have to contend with the rain, lack of sidewalks, or traffic on the narrow streets. [...] At the entrance of the Passage on boulevard Montmartre was a café called Véron, next to a candy shop called A la duchesse de Courtlande which sold not only <b>bonbons</b> but also fresh peaches, cherries and grapes, even in winter. [...] Next door was a paper shop, Susse, with business cards and fine writing paper; [...] then the shop of a famous modiste, Mademoiselle Lapostolle, whose speciality was straw hats. [...] There were pastry shops, chocolate shops, shops selling coffee and tea, music, [...] counters for changing foreign currency, and many other speciality shops, and the panoramas themselves, large-scale realistic paintings of Paris, Toulon, Amsterdam, Naples, and other cities, to be viewed for a small price. [...] Unlike the dark streets outside, the Passage was brightly lit by gas lights, one of the first places in Paris so equipped.|$|E

2500|$|Brel himself {{occasionally}} included {{parts of}} his songs in Dutch, {{one of the three}} official languages of Belgium, as in [...] "Marieke". He also recorded eight other Dutch versions of songs, such as [...] "Mijn vlakke land" [...] ("Le plat Pays"), [...] "Laat Me Niet Alleen" [...] ("Ne me quitte pas"), [...] "Rosa", [...] "De Burgerij" [...] ("Les Bourgeois"), and [...] "De Nuttelozen van de Nacht" [...] ("Les paumés du petit matin"). Brel also recorded two obscure singles in Dutch, [...] "De apen" [...] ("Les Singes") and [...] "Men vergeet niets" [...] ("On n'oublie rien"), which were included in the 16-CD box set Boîte à <b>Bonbons</b> by Barclay. So far unreleased is the song [...] "Als men niets dan liefde heeft" [...] ("Quand on n’a que l’amour"). [...] "Marieke" [...] was translated by Brel himself. Since his own command of Dutch was poor, most of Brel's later Dutch interpretations were translated by Ernst van Altena, with Brel's cooperation, and are generally considered to be relatively true to the original French and poetic. [...] "De Apen" [...] was translated by Eric Franssen. [...] "Men vergeet niets" [...] was translated by well known Flemish artist Will Ferdy. [...] Popular singers from the Netherlands singing Brel's songs in Dutch have been Liesbeth List, Jan Mesdag and Jeroen Willems.|$|E
