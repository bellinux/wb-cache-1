5|$|The bulk {{properties}} of astatine {{are not known}} with any certainty. Research is limited by its short half-life, which prevents the creation of weighable quantities. A visible piece of astatine would immediately vaporize itself because of the heat generated by its intense radioactivity. It remains to <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>if,</b> with sufficient cooling, a macroscopic quantity of astatine could be deposited as a thin film. Astatine is usually classified as either a nonmetal or a metalloid; metal formation has also been predicted.|$|E
5|$|Twin helical strands {{form the}} DNA backbone. Another double helix {{may be found}} tracing the spaces, or grooves, between the strands. These voids are {{adjacent}} to the base pairs and may provide a binding site. As the strands are not symmetrically located with respect to each other, the grooves are unequally sized. One groove, the major groove, is 22Å wide and the other, the minor groove, is 12Å wide. The width of the major groove means that {{the edges of the}} bases are more accessible in the major groove than in the minor groove. As a result, proteins such as transcription factors that can bind to specific sequences in double-stranded DNA usually make contact with the sides of the bases exposed in the major groove. This situation varies in unusual conformations of DNA within the cell (see below), but the major and minor grooves are always named to reflect the differences in size that would <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>if</b> the DNA is twisted back into the ordinary B form.|$|E

The initial radioactivity would be dominated by the 24Na activity (half-life 15 h) but with increasing time the 239Np (half-life 2.4 d after formation from parent 239U with half-life 24 min) and finally the 60Co activity (5.3 yr) would predominate.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} stage which is called non-proliferative {{diabetic}} retinopathy (NPDR) there are no symptoms, the signs are not visible to the eye and patients will have 20/20 vision.

25|$|However, {{there were}} supporters. Medwin's book was well {{received}} by several eminent writers, including Sir Samuel Egerton Brydges, who included in his edition of Edward Phillips' Theatrum Petarum Anglicanorum {{a memoir of}} Shelley, written by Medwin. Leigh Hunt, as might be expected, took a more tolerant view of Medwin in Lord Byron and his Contemporaries (1828), and {{since the publication of}} Byron's letters in Thomas Moore's biography(1830/31) and Lady Blessington's Conversations(1832–33), Medwin's recollections of Byron have come to <b>be</b> <b>seen,</b> <b>if</b> not always faithful in detail, as an essentially accurate portrayal.|$|E

25|$|However, {{there is}} still no {{certainty}} as to how judges will apply their powers of judicial review when an error of material fact has been committed.

Hence, it still remains to <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>if</b> the courts in Singapore will adopt the four requirements that were laid down in E v. Home Secretary. One view is that there is little reason for the courts to reject these requirements, given that Fong Thin Choo cited Tameside with approval, and E v. Home Secretary was based upon this case.|$|E
25|$|Peer-to-peer sexual {{harassment}} is {{three times more likely}} than perpetration by teachers or other school faculty. Sexual harassment between peers may also be a result of students trying to conform to expected gender norms created by society. It can also be used as a tool for gender policing. For example, this could <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>if</b> a male is exhibiting behavior not seen to peers as being masculine, so others may label him with homophobic slurs in order to reinforce gender conformity through a form of nonphysical {{sexual harassment}}. Students may exhibit, accept, or tolerate this conforming behavior as to not cause rifts in peer groups.|$|E
25|$|Feedback from consumers. In 2010 WASREB {{and local}} {{utilities}} helped to establish Water and Sanitation Action Groups (WAGs) consisting of citizen volunteers in Kisumu, Kakagemam, Nairobi and Mombasa {{to provide a}} forum for dialogue and for feedback from consumers. Consumer complained about inaccurate billing and metering, pipe bursts, illegal connections, poor workmanship on installations, vandalism, overcharging and corruption.

25|$|While {{this reform}} was {{eventually}} accomplished, other challenges must be surmounted. Mexico's shale {{oil and gas}} development close to the US border is hampered by the activities of organized criminal groups that include the theft of pipeline products and the extortion to companies in the extractive industries, along with lack of adequate infrastructure; overall, this {{has resulted in the}} low economic competitiveness of Mexico's shales in comparison with those across the border in the United States soil. It remains to <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>if</b> the awaited Mexican energy reform will overcome these drawbacks. Owing to Mexico's weak rule of law and poor success in previous major industry reforms, the legal changes brought about might as well end up worsening the drawbacks in the energy sector and namely {{in the development of the}} country's shale resources.|$|E
25|$|Chemical {{recycling}} of PET will become cost-efficient only applying high capacity recycling lines {{of more than}} 50,000 tons/year. Such lines could only <b>be</b> <b>seen,</b> <b>if</b> at all, within the production sites of very large polyester producers. Several attempts of industrial magnitude to establish such chemical recycling plants {{have been made in}} the past but without resounding success. Even the promising chemical recycling in Japan has not become an industrial breakthrough so far. The two reasons for this are: at first, the difficulty of consistent and continuous waste bottles sourcing in such a huge amount at one single site, and, at second, the steadily increased prices and price volatility of collected bottles. The prices of baled bottles increased for instance between the years 2000 and 2008 from about 50 Euro/ton to over 500 Euro/ton in 2008.|$|E
25|$|Tests for {{inflammation}} (C-reactive {{protein and}} the erythrocyte sedimentation rate) are typically elevated, and abnormal liver enzymes may <b>be</b> <b>seen.</b> <b>If</b> the kidneys are involved, tests of renal function (such as urea and creatinine) are elevated. The {{complete blood count}} may show particularly high numbers of a type of white blood cell known as eosinophils (more than 0.5 billion per liter); this occurs in only 60-80% of cases, so normal eosinophil counts do {{not rule out the}} diagnosis. Examination of the urine may show red blood cells (occasionally in casts as seen under the microscope) and increased levels of protein; in a third of the cases with kidney involvement, eosinophils can also be detected in the urine. If vasculitis is suspected, complement levels may be determined as reduced levels are often encountered in vasculitis; complement is a group of proteins that forms part of the innate immune system. Complement levels are frequently reduced in cholesterol embolism, limiting the use of this test in the distinction between vasculitis and cholesterol embolism.|$|E
30|$|The LOEC {{is defined}} as the lowest {{treatment}} concentration at which an effect <b>was</b> <b>seen,</b> for example, reproduction differed statistically significantly from the control group.

We, therefore, used LOEC values instead of NOEC values.|$|R

25|$|Gastric impactions are {{relatively}} rare, and occur when food is not cleared {{at the appropriate}} rate. It is most commonly associated with ingestion of foods that swell after eating or feeds that are coarse (bedding or poor quality roughage), poor dental care, poor mastication, inadequate drinking, ingestion of a foreign object, and alterations in the normal function of the stomach. Persimmons, which form a sticky gel in the stomach, and haylage, have both been associated with it, as has wheat, barley, mesquite beans, and beet pulp. Horses usually show signs of mild colic that is chronic, unresponsive to analgesics, and may include signs such as dysphagia, ptyalism, bruxism, fever, and lethargy, although severe colic signs may occur. Signs of shock may <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>if</b> gastric rupture has occurred. Usually, the impaction must be quite large before it presents symptoms, and may be diagnosed via gastroscopy or ultrasound, although rectal examinations are unhelpful. Persimmon impaction is treated with infusions of Coca-Cola. Other gastric impactions are often resolves with enteral fluids. Quick treatment generally produces a favorable prognosis.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} unanswered {{question is}} whether such rare variants exist because of chance mutations, population founder events and maintenance by processes such as drift, or whether there is any selective advantage involved in their maintenance and spread. An {{example of such a}} rare variant effect was recently discovered among Samoan islanders. Among the islanders the variant is extremely common, but in other populations it is extremely rare or absent. The variant predisposes to obesity but strangely is protective against type 2 diabetes. Based on cell studies it was suggested the variant may protect individuals against periods of 'famine' and there is also evidence that it has been under positive selection. The most likely scenario then is that this rare variant was established in the islanders by a founder effect among a small initial colonising population, and was able to spread because of a selective advantage it conferred within that small group. Hence, in small populations under particular environmental conditions it may be feasible that the 'thrifty gene' idea is correct. It remains to <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>if</b> rare variants that fill the gap in the missing heritability estimates are also 'thrifty genes' or if they are rare chance events sustained by drift, as implicated for the common variants currently linked to obesity and type 2 diabetes.|$|E
25|$|Hosking's {{search for}} a {{thoughtful}} and appropriate design for the three rose windows of the chapel, {{may also have been}} influenced partly by the St. Procopius basilica which incorporates a rare example of the use of a naturalistic ten-part rose window. All wild roses have five petals and five sepals or multiples of this number, as do theor fruit. Similarly a lime, orange or lemon which belong to the Roseaceae family will also normally show ten fruit segments, as can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>if</b> cut in half. The adoption of a botanical rose window introduced an element of classical learning and reason rather than the tendency of gothic towards the more elaborate and supernatural. Its choice would also have suited the horticulturalist and scientist George Loddiges who was on the design team for he saw the 'hand of the Creator' in the beautiful natural designs of botanical species and varieties. His multi-part work, 'The Botanical Cabinet' took a distinctly more religious view of botany than competitor's illustrated works such as Curtis' Botanical Magazine and was noted for its piety. Near to the chapel with its splendid botanical rose windows George Loddiges laid out a special rosarium to bring attention to this rich and diverse plan family. The botanical rose windows would also have suited George Collison for his ancestral town was Beverley in Yorkshire, where he would have been familiar with the widespread use of the White Rose of York as a symbol and have seen it reproduced, taking up the theme of the rose, in the rare ten-part botanical rose windows of Beverley Minster.|$|E
