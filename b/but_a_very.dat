5|$|In adult house sparrows, annual {{survival}} is 45–65%. After fledging {{and leaving the}} care of their parents, young sparrows have a high mortality rate, which lessens {{as they grow older}} and more experienced. Only about 20–25% of birds hatched survive to their first breeding season. The oldest known wild house sparrow lived for nearly two decades; it was found dead 19years and 9months after it was ringed in Denmark. The oldest recorded captive house sparrow lived for 23years. The typical ratio of males to females in a population is uncertain due to problems in collecting data, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> slight preponderance of males at all ages is usual.|$|E
5|$|Mutations in germ-line DNA (i.e., DNA of {{the sperm}} or egg, which {{manifest}} in the offspring). These occur spontaneously, or are triggered by environmental radiation or mutagenic chemicals. A recently discovered mechanism, {{which is likely to}} be more important than the others combined, is infections with viruses, which integrate their DNA into their hosts. Organisms do not want to mutate: mutation just happens. Most of the mutations are harmful or lethal to the offspring, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> small minority turn out to be advantageous, as novel proteins get produced that serve new functions.|$|E
5|$|Rudel {{was born}} on 2 July 1916 in Konradswaldau, in Prussia. He was the third child of Lutheran {{minister}} Johannes Rudel. As a boy, Rudel was a poor scholar, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> keen sportsman. Rudel attended the humanities oriented Gymnasium, in Lauban. He joined the Hitler Youth in 1933. After graduating with Abitur in 1936, he participated in the compulsory Reich Labour Service (RAD). Following the labour service, Rudel joined the Luftwaffe where he began his military career as an air reconnaissance pilot.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} of nymphs into adults can take months; {{the time period}} depends on food availability, temperature, and {{the general population of}} the colony. Since nymphs are unable to feed themselves, workers must feed them, but workers also take part in the social life of the colony and have certain other tasks to accomplish such as foraging, building or maintaining the nest or tending to the queen. Pheromones regulate the caste system in termite colonies, preventing all <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> few of the termites from becoming fertile queens.|$|E

She continued to collaborate with Jay on his second and third albums after his triumphant self-titled debut, and co-wrote songs for other pop performers, such as Leehom Wang, Vanness Wu, Show Luo and Gigi Leung. Her lyric work is much praised for its clever and straightforward simplicity.|$|E

It is published each April, just {{before the start of the}} English domestic cricket season. Since 2003 the woodcut has been replaced as the main feature of the front cover by a photograph of a current cricketer, but still appears albeit in a much reduced size.|$|E
25|$|Born into {{a wealthy}} and {{powerful}} Anglo-Irish Protestant landowning family, {{he entered the}} House of Commons in 1875. He was a land reform agitator, and became leader of the Home Rule League in 1880, insisting on operating independently of the Liberals, and winning great influence by his balancing of constitutional, radical, and economic issues, and by his skillful use of parliamentary procedure. He was imprisoned in Kilmainham Gaol in 1882 <b>but,</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> capable negotiator, was released when he renounced violent extra-Parliamentary action. That same year he reformed the Home Rule League as the Irish Parliamentary Party, which he controlled minutely as Britain's first disciplined democratic party.|$|E

25|$|This process {{continues}} {{until the}} whole skein is wound. The time to skein yarn on a niddy-noddy {{depends on the}} yardage, and thus how many wraps need to be made. A larger niddy-noddy can speed up the skeining, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> large one can be bulky, and thus slow down {{the time to do}} one wrap. At this point, the skein is secured by loose figure eight knots between each crossbar. This can be done with scrap yarn, or with slip knots {{from the end of the}} skein. In either case, loosely securing each end with a slip knot makes it easier to find the ends in the finished skein. Generally 4 or more knots are tied.|$|E
25|$|These {{cautions}} being duly observed, I {{do not see}} how {{any person}} can devote himself too entirely {{to the cause of}} the Apostolical Church in these realms. There may be, as far as he knows, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> few to sympathise with him. He may have to wait long, and very likely pass out of this world before he see any abatement in the triumph of disorder and irreligion. But, if he be consistent, he possesses, to the utmost, the personal consolations of a good Christian: and as a true Churchman, he has that encouragement, which no other cause in the world can impart in the same degree:—he is calmly, soberly, demonstrably, SURE, that, sooner or later, HIS WILL BE THE WINNING SIDE, and that the victory will be complete, universal, eternal.|$|E
25|$|The Roman Period was {{the time}} when the {{majority}} of extant works of Greek prose fiction were composed. The ancient Greek novels Leucippe and Clitophon by Achilles Tatius and Daphnis and Chloe by Longus were both probably written during the early second century AD. Daphnis and Chloe, by far the most famous of the five surviving ancient Greek romance novels, is a nostalgic tale of two young lovers growing up in an idealized pastoral environment on the Greek island of Lesbos. The Wonders Beyond Thule by Antonius Diogenes may have also been written during the early second century AD, although scholars are unsure of its exact date. The Wonders Beyond Thule has not survived in its complete form, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> lengthy summary of it written by Photios I of Constantinople has survived. The Ephesian Tale by Xenophon of Ephesus was probably written during the late second century AD.|$|E

25|$|In 1984, McCarthy {{was back}} as joint-coach of the Cork senior hurling {{team with the}} Rev. Michael O'Brien. It {{was the second time}} that he was coach of his native county. That year McCarthy helped guide Cork to their third Munster title in succession. The provincial final win over Tipperary was truly {{remarkable}} given the fact that Cork were trailing by four points with four minutes to go and ended up winning the game by four points. This victory allowed Cork to advance directly to the centenary year All-Ireland final. Offaly provided the opposition on that occasion in a very special championship decider at Semple Stadium in Thurles. It was their first meeting {{in the history of the}} championship, however, Cork were the favourites. A 3–16 to 1–12 victory gave McCarthy's Cork a reasonably easy <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> special victory nonetheless.|$|E
25|$|This Benchmark was post-peer {{reviewed}} and significantly expanded. The new set is diverse {{in terms of}} the biological functions it represents, with complexes that involve G-proteins and receptor extracellular domains, as well as antigen/antibody, enzyme/inhibitor, and enzyme/substrate complexes. It is also diverse {{in terms of the}} partners' affinity for each other, with Kd ranging between 10−5 and 10−14 M. Nine pairs of entries represent closely related complexes that have a similar structure, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> different affinity, each pair comprising a cognate and a noncognate assembly. The unbound structures of the component proteins being available, conformation changes can be assessed. They are significant in most of the complexes, and large movements or disorder-to-order transitions are frequently observed. The set may be used to benchmark biophysical models aiming to relate affinity to structure in protein–protein interactions, taking into account the reactants and the conformation changes that accompany the association reaction, instead of just the final product.|$|E
25|$|New Orleans and St. Louis {{joined the}} United States and grew rapidly; entirely new cities were begun at Pittsburgh, Marietta, Cincinnati, Louisville, Lexington, Nashville and points west. The {{coming of the}} {{steamboat}} after 1810 made upstream traffic economical on major rivers, especially the Hudson, Ohio, Mississippi, Illinois, Missouri, Tennessee, and Cumberland rivers. Historian Richard Wade has {{emphasized the importance of}} the new cities in the Westward expansion in settlement of the farmlands. They were the transportation centers, and nodes for migration and financing of the westward expansion. The newly opened regions had few roads, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> good river system in which everything flowed downstream to New Orleans. With the coming of the steamboat after 1815, it became possible to move merchandise imported from the Northeast and from Europe upstream to new settlements. The opening of the Erie Canal made Buffalo the jumping off point for the lake transportation system that made important cities out of Cleveland, Detroit, and especially Chicago.|$|E
