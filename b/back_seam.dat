2500|$|White House {{officials}} initially {{claimed that}} the bulge was a [...] "wrinkle in the fabric," [...] and that Bush was not wearing a bullet-proof vest, as many conjectured. Bush's tailor later said that the bulge {{was nothing more than}} a pucker along the jacket's <b>back</b> <b>seam,</b> according to the Seattle Times. After the election, unidentified sources in the Secret Service told The Hill that Bush had been wearing a bullet-proof vest and that campaign handlers had not admitted it earlier for security reasons.|$|E
50|$|A center <b>back</b> <b>seam</b> or <b>back</b> <b>seam</b> runs {{vertically}} {{down the}} center-back of a garment. It {{can be used}} to create anatomical shaping to the back portion of a garment particularly through the waist area and hips. It can also be used for styling and functional purposes involving pleats, vents, flare toward the hem or for back closures such as buttoned plackets or zippers.|$|E
50|$|Double-weave jackets {{designed}} for competition usually display a prominent seam that {{runs down the}} back of the jacket, joining two halves of fabric. Starting in the late nineties, some manufacturers made this overlapping part very wide, in effect doubling the fabric thickness for a large section of the back. This blocked the opponent from gripping there, which in 2005 caused the International Judo Federation to ban fighting in international competitions using a judogi with <b>back</b> <b>seam</b> area wider than 3 cm (a little more than one inch). Wider designs could still be permitted in local competitions depending on national rules. Single-weave jackets usually have no <b>back</b> <b>seam,</b> or a narrow one which only joins two fabric sections without interfering with grips.|$|E
50|$|A side-back seam {{runs from}} the armscye to the waist, and fits the garment to the curve below the {{shoulder}} blades. Side-back seams may be used instead of, or in combination with, side and center <b>back</b> <b>seams.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Thigh highs are {{now most}} often {{produced}} on circular machines that eliminate <b>back</b> <b>seams</b> by knitting tubes that are then [...] "set" [...] {{to the shape}} of the leg. While the first circular machines produced sheer stockings with a reinforced heel pocket, modern machines have eliminated this, offering a better fit regardless of the wearer's shoe size.|$|R
50|$|Members of the Diplomatic Service wore Court Uniform: ambassadors' coats wore 1st class civil uniform, {{but with}} {{additional}} embroidery on the sleeves and <b>back</b> <b>seams.</b> High commissioners for Dominions in London wore 1st class uniform. The High Commissioner for Southern Rhodesia, and Agents-General for Australian states wore 2nd class uniform. The King's or Queen's Foreign Service Messengers {{were entitled to}} 5th class court uniform (upgraded to 4th class in 1929) and also wore a distinctive greyhound badge.|$|R
50|$|In {{clothing}} construction, seams {{are classified}} by their type (plain, lapped, abutted, or French seams) and {{position in the}} finished garment (center <b>back</b> <b>seam,</b> inseam, side seam). Seams are finished {{with a variety of}} techniques to prevent raveling of raw fabric edges and to neaten the inside of garments.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{version has}} nine ribbon bows called [...] "butterflies" [...] {{attached}} {{to the back of}} the skull cap (three running vertically down the <b>back</b> <b>seam,</b> two vertically eitherside further towards the sides and one eitherside at the sides of the skull) in addition to the above. This cap is worn during the mourning of the monarch, a member of the royal family or the university chancellor.|$|E
50|$|In New Zealand and Australia, sheep shearers' moccasins are {{constructed}} of a synthetic, cream-colored felt, with a <b>back</b> <b>seam</b> and {{gathered at the}} top of the rounded toe. These moccasins are laced in the front, and the lacing is covered with a flap fastened with a buckle at the shoe's outer side. The fastener arrangement prevents the shearer's handpiece comb from catching in the laces. Shearers' moccasins protect the feet, grip wooden floors well, and absorb sweat.|$|E
5000|$|Ambassadors wore '1st class' court uniform, with {{additional}} gold embroidery on the sleeve and <b>back</b> <b>seams.</b> More junior officers wore different classes of uniform with simplified braiding on cuffs and collars only, as specified for their rank or appointment, (the classes of uniform were differentiated by varying widths of gold embroidery). Members of the Consular Service wore court uniforms with silver braiding according to rank, {{in contrast to}} the gold of diplomatic officers. The King's or Queen's Foreign Service Messengers were entitled to 5th class court uniform, upgraded to 4th class in 1929.|$|R

50|$|The zipper was {{initially}} popularized as a fastener for men's trousers. Though at first opposed on women's clothes {{due to the}} suggestiveness of speedy undressing, it ultimately became popular on women's clothing, particularly dresses, in the late 1930s, for their convenience over hook and eye fasteners, buttons and snap fasteners, hence the now obsolete term zipperback dress. Zippers are typically placed at the <b>back</b> <b>seam</b> of a dress. Some such garments may sport decorative buttons, lacing or mock closures at the front, but actually open at the back.|$|E
5000|$|In Britain, {{clothing}} was strictly rationed, {{with a system}} of [...] "points", and the Board of Trade issued regulations for [...] "Utility Clothes" [...] in 1941. In America the War Production Board issued its Regulation L85 on March 8, 1942, specifying restrictions for every item of women's clothing. Because the military used so much green and brown dye, manufacturers used more red dye in clothing. Easily laddered stockings were a particular concern in Britain; women were forced to either paint them on (including the <b>back</b> <b>seam)</b> or to join the WRNS, who continued to issue them, in a cunning aid to recruitment. Later in the war, American soldiers became a source of the new nylon stockings.|$|E
5000|$|According to this 1570s account, which Cecil {{noted as}} an 'Exhortation to the Lords of Council against the Hamiltons,' {{from that time}} forth Finnart was in disfavour. The reasons for Finnart's {{execution}} remain unclear and some recent writers, such as Jamie Cameron doubt that his role and significance was as pivotal {{as the author of}} the 'Exhortation' suggests. Some evidence suggests that Finnart was not unambiguously an ally of the Douglases. Letters written by Douglas agents following James V's journey in France in October 1536 (and intercepted by the English) reported that Finnart was not in favour and that the king had said to John Drummond of Milnab when they were aboard ship; [...] "If I would but once look merely upon the earl of Angus, Sir James would droop; for by the wounds of God, for all Sir James' bragging, the earl of Angus and he never met but Sir James turned ever the <b>back</b> <b>seams</b> of his hose." ...|$|R

5000|$|The Federal cavalry {{generally}} {{fought with}} sabres; {{at any rate}} they carried them, and Mosby used {{to say they were}} as useless against a skillfully handled revolver as the wooden swords of harlequins. As the Mosby tactics became better known, scouting parties from the Northern army began to develop an affection for the pistol, with increasing success I might add. In stubborn fights I have seen the men on both sides sit on their restless horses and re-load their pistols under a galling fire. This was not a custom, however; someone generally ran to cover after the revolvers were emptied. We both did this a good many times but, I believe, without bragging at the expense of truth, that we saw the <b>back</b> <b>seams</b> of the enemy's jackets oftener than they saw ours[...] [...] Revolvers in the hands of Mosby's men were as effective in surprise engagements as a whole line of light ordnance {{in the hands of the}} enemy. This was largely because Mosby admonished his men never to fire a shot until the eyes of the other fellow were visible. It was no uncommon thing for one of our men to gallop by a tree at full tilt, and put three bullets in its trunk in succession. This sort of shooting left the enemy with a good many empty saddles after an engagement.|$|R
50|$|Fond of {{the grand}} gesture, Himber could be as generous as he was unpredictable. A wearer of brightly {{patterned}} sportcoats, he once complained that a friend's coat was too loud and promptly tore out the <b>back</b> <b>seam.</b> Before the astonished friend could object, Himber steered him into a clothier's shop where an exact copy of the coat was waiting - paid for ahead of time by Himber himself. A portly yet youthful-looking man with flaming red hair, Himber frequently lied about his age, giving birth dates of 1902, 1904, 1907, and 1909 at various times. He married only in his forties, to prominent model Nina McDougall, {{with whom he had}} a son. Their acrimonious divorce was the talk of New York tabloids a decade later.|$|E
50|$|The {{trousers}} for suspenders have buttons {{in order}} to attach the leather tabs; these may be either on the outside, traditionally, or inside of trousers {{that do not have}} belt loops. With belt loops, buttons would be sewn {{on the inside of the}} waistband. Such trousers might also have a high back in the fishtail shape, though this is not as common now; This style may also have an additional adjustable strap at the back, as well as the two side adjusters placed on most belt-less trousers. Buttons should be placed about 3 to 3.5 in apart, an equal distance from the <b>back</b> <b>seam.</b> At the front, the first button should be set over the main pleat or crease, the second button again about 3 to 3.5 in apart. It is important to place the buttons in the correct position, as trousers with suspenders should be slightly loose to hang correctly.|$|E
50|$|The {{jacket was}} modeled after a {{civilian}} windbreaker design, and was constructed of an olive drab shade 3 cotton poplin outer shell with an olive drab wool flannel lining, with shell color on new jackets was a pale pea-green color, but faded fairly quickly with heavy use and sun {{exposure to the}} more common beige-green. The jacket had a front zipper front closure with a buttoned storm flap. The jacket also had buttons at the collar for closing the lapels to warm the neck region, as well as buttoned adjusting tabs {{on each side of}} the waist and at the cuffs to seal in body heat, and buttoned shoulder epaulets. There were two front slash pockets and a notched lapel collar. Earlier models of the jacket (M-38 Parsons jacket) do not have the shoulder epaulets, but the two front slash pockets had buttoned pocket flaps and a thinner half-belt <b>back</b> <b>seam.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Möbius strip {{has several}} curious properties. A line drawn {{starting}} from the seam down the middle meets <b>back</b> at the <b>seam,</b> but at the other side. If continued, the line meets the starting point, and is double {{the length of the}} original strip. This single continuous curve demonstrates that the Möbius strip has only one boundary.|$|R

50|$|At {{about this}} time, {{cross-measure}} drifts were also being driven {{down to the}} underlying Piper seam {{to the south of}} the pit-bottom and a new face was headed out. This face advanced below the earlier workings in the Deep Hard until it had reached a position beyond their final working point. Near to the pit-bottom, the Piper seam was separated from the Deep Hard by about 10yds but as the face moved out, the distance decreased until they were separated by only a short distance. At this point short drifts were driven up into the Deep Hard and new faces were then opened out <b>back</b> in this <b>seam</b> and within a short distance they were working a combined thickness of coal of about 2 - 2.5 m. Two other faces had been opened out closer to the pit-bottom in the Piper, but no further development took place in that seam except for a parallel one running back towards the pit-bottom.|$|R

Biographical Note: Born in Bruenn, Austria-Hungary (now Brno, Czech Republic) in 1896, Norbert Troller served as a soldier in World War I, spending time as a prisoner-of-war in Italy. After the war he studied architecture in Brno and Vienna and worked as an architect in Brno until the German occupation of Czechoslovakia. He was deported to Theresienstadt in 1942, where he worked as an architect for the Jewish self-adminstration of the camp, and produced works of art as well. In 1944 he was imprisoned by the Gestapo, and was sent to Auschwitz later that year. After liberation, he lived briefly in Cracow, and then reopened his architectural business in Prague and Brno. He emigrated to the United States in 1948 and worked for the National Jewish Welfare Board in New York designing Jewish community centers, before opening his own practice. He died in 1981. updatedDigital imag...|$|R
