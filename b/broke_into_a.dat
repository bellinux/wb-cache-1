5|$|After {{the band}} had walked offstage, {{in a move}} {{described}} by NME as the most meaningful of the concert, the audience faced the troops in the stadium and <b>broke</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> spontaneous round of applause, which quickly turned into an ovation—an act which the soldiers mimicked in turn.|$|E
5|$|Convictions of {{computer}} crimes, or hacking, began {{as early as}} 1983 with the case of The 414s from the 414 area code in Milwaukee. In that case, six teenagers <b>broke</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> number of high-profile computer systems, including Los Alamos National Laboratory, Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and Security Pacific Bank. On May 1, 1983, one of the 414s, Gerald Wondra, was sentenced to two years of probation.|$|E

5|$|Andersen {{was accused}} of crimes on several {{occasions}} in the post-war years, but was most often acquitted in court. Amongst the crimes {{of which he was}} charged but acquitted in court was the theft of building materials in 1954. Another time he was tricked into lending his car to two people who <b>broke</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> goldsmith's shop in Tønsberg. Strongly intoxicated {{at the time of the}} crime, he was charged but fully acquitted. In 1955 he was, however, convicted and sentenced to 36days in prison for selling 30bottles of denatured alcohol, alcohol that was supposed to have been used at his factory.|$|E
5|$|Suicide {{rates in}} Germany {{increased}} {{as the war}} drew to a close, particularly {{in areas where the}} Red Army was advancing. More than a thousand people (out of a population of around 16,000) committed suicide in Demmin on and around 1 May 1945 as the 65th Army of 2nd Belorussian Front first <b>broke</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> distillery and then rampaged through the town, committing mass rapes, arbitrarily executing civilians and setting fire to buildings. High numbers of suicides took place in many other locations, including Neubrandenburg (600 dead), Stolp in Pommern (1,000 dead) and Berlin, where at least 7,057 people committed suicide in 1945.|$|E
5|$|The {{crossing}} of the Saint Lawrence by the American troops was observed by Quebec militia, who alerted British troops at Trois-Rivières. A local farmer led the Americans into a swamp, enabling the British to land additional forces in the village, and to establish positions behind the American army. After a brief exchange between an established British line and American troops emerging from the swamp, the Americans <b>broke</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> somewhat disorganized retreat. As some avenues of retreat were cut off, the British took a sizable number of prisoners, including General Thompson and much of his staff.|$|E

5|$|The {{incident}} {{began when}} five armed {{members of the}} United Red Army (URA), following a bloody purge that left 14 {{members of the group}} plus one bystander dead, <b>broke</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> holiday lodge below Mount Asama, taking the wife of the lodge-keeper as a hostage. A standoff between police and the URA radicals took place, lasting ten days. The lodge was a natural fortress, solidly constructed of thick concrete on a steep hillside with only one entrance, which, along with their guns, enabled the hostage-takers to keep police at a distance.|$|E
5|$|When Chandler was 14, {{he began}} {{stealing}} cars and was arrested 20times as a juvenile. As an adult, {{he was charged}} with a variety of crimes, including possession of counterfeit money, loitering and prowling, burglary, kidnapping, and armed robbery. He was also accused of masturbating while peering inside a woman's window. In one incident, Chandler and an accomplice <b>broke</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> Florida couple's home, held them at gunpoint, and robbed them. Chandler told his accomplice to tie up the man with speaker wire and took the woman into the bedroom, where he made her strip to her underwear, tied her up, and rubbed the barrel of his revolver across her stomach.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 29 April, a party of Noongar <b>broke</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> Fremantle store to steal flour and were shot at by the {{caretaker}} Peter Chidlow. Domjum, a brother of Yagan, was badly injured and died in jail a few days later. The rest of the party moved from Fremantle to Preston Point, where Yagan reportedly vowed vengeance for the death. Between 50 and 60 Noongar gathered at Bull Creek, where they met a party of settlers who were loading carts with provisions. Later that day, the group ambushed the lead cart, killing two settlers, Tom and John Velvick. Tribal law required only a single death for vengeance. Some historians have speculated that the Velvicks were targeted because they had previously been convicted for assaulting Aboriginal people and coloured seamen. Alexandra Hasluck has also argued that stealing provisions was an important motive in the attack, but this has been refuted elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|When Hillyar's {{squadron}} {{arrived at}} Port Louis, Captain Schomberg immediately assumed command {{and led the}} squadron out again on 14 May, following the French eastwards. Heading straight for Tamatave, the only resupply point between Bourbon and the Cape of Good Hope, Schomberg rapidly gained on the French and when dawn broke on 20 May the French were {{within sight of the}} harbour. During the day, both commanders were frustrated by light winds and periods of calm in which none of the ships were able to move. Roquebert completed resupplying his ships at 12:00 and pulled away from the harbour in battle line, Clorinde followed by Renommée and Néréide while the British, although initially intending to form a line with Astraea at its head, gradually <b>broke</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> loose formation created by the vagaries of the wind.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{unsuccessful}} searches {{were carried out}} in Cabo Rojo by an urban militia led by Captain Carlos de Espada, and additional searches were made in San Germán. On May 23, 1824, the Mayagüez military commander prepared two vessels {{and sent them to}} Pedernales in response to reported sightings of Cofresí. Rivas and the military captain of Mayagüez, Cayetano Castillo y Picado, boarded a ship commanded by Sergeant Sebastián Bausá. Sailor Pedro Alacán, best known as the grandfather of Ramón Emeterio Betances and a neighbor of Cofresí, was captain of the second schooner. The expedition failed, only finding a military deserter named Manuel Fernández de Córdova. Also known as Manuel Navarro, Fernández was connected to Cofresí through Lucas Branstan (a merchant from Trieste who was involved in Bonne Sophie incident). In the meantime, the pirates fled toward southern Puerto Rico. Poorly supplied after his hasty retreat, Cofresí docked at Jobos Bay on June 2, 1824; about a dozen pirates invaded the hacienda of Francisco Antonio Ortiz, stealing his cattle. The group then <b>broke</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> second estate, owned by Jacinto Texidor, stole plantains and resupplied their ship. It is now believed that Juan José Mateu gave the pirates refuge in one of his haciendas, near Jobos Bay. The next day the news reached Guayama mayor Francisco Brenes, who quickly contacted the military and requested operations by land and sea. He was told that there were not enough weapons in the municipality for a mission of that scale. Brenes then requested supplies from Patillas, which rushed him twenty guns.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, Stanford University student Bill Pitts, {{who had a}} hobby of {{exploring}} the steam tunnels and buildings of the campus, <b>broke</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> building he found {{out to be the}} location of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Project, which held a DEC PDP-6 time-sharing computer system with 20 Teletype consoles connected to it. Fascinated by the computer and having taken several introductory computer classes, Pitts convinced the head of the project, Lester Earnest, to let him use the computer after hours. Soon, Pitts had ceased going to classes, instead spending his nights in the computer lab interacting with the graduate and postgraduate students and playing Spacewar on the PDP-6. Pitts often played against Hugh Tuck, a student at California Polytechnic State University who was a friend from high school. During one Spacewar session that took place, depending on the source, between 1966 and 1969, Tuck remarked that a coin-operated version of the game would be very successful. Such a device was still unfeasible due to the cost of computers, and the pair did not pursue the project. In 1971, however, Pitts, who by then had graduated and was working at Lockheed as a PDP-10 programmer, learned of the 1970 DEC PDP-11, which was sold for around US$14,000. While this was still too high for a commercially viable product, as most electronic games in arcades cost around US$1,000 at the time, Tuck and Pitts felt it was low enough to build a prototype to determine interest and optimal per-game pricing.|$|E

5|$|In 737, Asad {{launched}} a campaign into the principality of Khuttal, whose rulers had supported the Turgesh and Harith's rebellion. Asad was initially successful, but the Khuttalan regent, Ibn al-Sa'iji, called upon the Turgesh for aid. While the Muslim army was scattered pillaging, the Turgesh khagan Suluk brought his army, allegedly 50,000 strong, from his capital Tokmok into Khuttal within 17 days. Ibn al-Sa'iji, who tried to play both sides off against each other, informed Asad of the Turgesh expedition only shortly before its arrival. Asad had time enough to send ahead his heavy baggage train, laden with the plunder and captives from Khuttal, back south {{under the command of}} Ibrahim ibn Asim al-'Uqayli, accompanied by the contingent from the allied principality of al-Saghaniyan. Asad with the main Muslim army remained behind, but at the arrival of the Turgesh host, Asad's troops <b>broke</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> headlong flight for the Oxus, which they managed to reach just ahead of the Turgesh. The crossing of the river was a confused affair, as Asad ordered each of his soldiers to carry across one of the sheep the army had brought with it as provisions. In the end, the sheep had to be abandoned as the pursuing Turgesh attacked the Arab rearguard, composed of the Azdi and Tamimi tribal contingents, on the north bank. As the rear guard was thrown back, Asad's army hurried to cross the river in panic.|$|E
5|$|In August 1997, Carl Doyle and {{his wife}} Catherine Doyle were stabbed to death in Ballintubber, Co Roscommon by Mark Nash, a 25-year-old {{resident}} of Drumcondra in North Dublin. During his interview with the gardaí, he said that about three months prior to his arrest, as he was walking to Stoneybatter, he <b>broke</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> house through the back, and had stabbed two women in their sleep. In his statement, {{there were at least}} two aspects of the crime scene that were not known to the public at the time. Nash later retracted his confession. Nash's confession caused some consternation amongst the gardaí, as Dean Lyons had been charged at that point and was on remand awaiting trial. Two camps emerged within the gardaí, one which believed that Nash's confession threw doubt on Lyons' guilt, the other which believed that Lyons was the murderer. On 27 August 1997, the Garda Commissioner appointed Assistant Commissioner James McHugh to carry out a review of the available evidence. He released a preliminary report on 10 September 1997, and an interim report on 9 January 1998; while these reports did not come to a conclusion about Lyons' guilt, they did raise a number of doubts about his testimony.|$|E
25|$|The {{day before}} the first murder, he {{attempted}} to surrender to police. Telephone records confirmed that Sampson had called the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). As a fugitive who was facing bank robbery charges in North Carolina, Sampson could have been taken into custody. The call was accidentally disconnected by an FBI clerk, and no action was taken. After the murders, Sampson <b>broke</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> house in Vermont. After his arrest he confessed to the murders. He subsequently pleaded guilty.|$|E

25|$|During an open team {{practice}} {{before the}} 2002 World Cup, Ljungberg <b>broke</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> fight with teammate Olof Mellberg after a robust tackle from the latter. Ljungberg pushed Mellberg {{right in front}} of the world press and Mellberg responded by grabbing at Ljungberg's jersey top at throat level before the two wrestled on the ground. The two of them were quickly separated by shocked teammates and the team practice was immediately cancelled to deal with the public relations disaster. Within hours, video footage of the fight flooded the media and internet.|$|E
