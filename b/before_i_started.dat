It was initially thought to be Shankar's pet project Robot revived with a new title, but this was later proven not to be correct. Shankar said the film was his [...] "dream project" [...] and disclosed {{that it would be}} a racy, fantasy-thriller. When questioned on how the idea behind the film had come to him, the director revealed, [...] "The seeds of all my movies were sown when I was young, long <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> making movies. So many things disturbed me, and these stayed with me. Those were the seeds. I make films based on them." ...|$|E

He explained: [...] "I went out and bought all the music I grew up on that I didn't already have and spent three months listening to only that. Only stuff from <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> making records, so it was pre-1989—Waylon, Willie, Buck Owens, Haggard, Don Williams, Jim Croce. And what I discovered was a simplicity in song that I had moved away from. It was quite an emotional journey because these were all the songs that moved me and inspired me to do what I've been doing ever since." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1983, Baker {{published}} an autobiography titled Baby Doll: An Autobiography, which detailed {{her life and}} career as an actress and revealed the issues with Paramount and Warner Bros. that had led her to move to Europe in the 1970s and pursue a career in Italian films. Baker said to Regis Philbin, when he interviewed her for Lifetime Television in 1986, that she [...] "didn't want to write an autobiography... but I wanted to write, and I knew {{that would be the}} easiest thing to get published." [...] She further commented to Philbin on her writing, saying: [...] "I think I always wanted to write, but I was a little self-conscious about it. I never had a formal education, and I've always had such a respect for writing. While I could go out and say, even <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> to act, 'Yes, I'm an actress,' I couldn't really say 'I'm a writer.'" [...] In spite of Baker's misgivings, Baby Doll: An Autobiography was well received. She later wrote two other books, To Africa with Love (1986), detailing her time spent in Africa, and a novel titled A Roman Tale (1987).|$|E

This is evident on [...] "Déjà Vu", which utilizes bass guitar, conga, hi-hat, horns and the 808 drum; it also features rap vocals by Jay-Z.

[...] The album's second single [...] "Ring the Alarm" [...] is noted {{for the use of}} a siren in its melody. It was called a song that [...] "shows a harder edge to Beyoncé'ss sound".

The song [...] "advises women who have partners with straying eyes to put on sexy dresses and grind on other guys in the club to regain their affections." [...] Meanwhile, the use of the [...] "uh-huh huh huh" [...] vocals and brassy stabs in the song [...] "Green Light" [...] is a direct echo to [...] "Crazy in Love", according to Peter Robinson of The Guardian.|$|E

Billy came along about 6 months after this and actually made it a bit less noisy. He's very calming like that is Billy.
