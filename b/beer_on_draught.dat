50|$|The brewery {{was founded}} in December 2002 in Toronto by Steve Abrams, Jeff Cooper and Michael Duggan. The brewery was named after its {{original}} location at 55 Mill Street in the historic Distillery District, the former industrial complex occupied by spirits maker Gooderham and Worts. In early 2006, all large-scale brewing was moved to a bigger facility in Scarborough, Ontario, and the Distillery District location reopened in October, 2006 as a brewpub. The brewpub features 14 Mill Street <b>beers</b> <b>on</b> <b>draught,</b> including seasonal and other special/one-off releases.

5000|$|Chimay Dorée (Golden), 4.8% ABV ale, brewed {{from very}} similar {{ingredients}} as the Red, but paler and spiced differently.

The monks themselves drink this variety rather than the stronger three. It is unusual for bottles of the Chimay Dorée to be available outside the Abbey or local inn and those that do are from unofficial sources. However, from 2013, a limited quantity of this <b>beer</b> was sold <b>on</b> <b>draught</b> in the United Kingdom, at 19 Fuller's pubs and in Italy, where only 50 pubs sell this variety of beer, as well as in 330 ml bottles in some export markets.|$|R
