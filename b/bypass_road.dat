25|$|The Cold War {{expansion}} of the base in the early 1950s coincided with the Korean War and the rise in nuclear tensions with the Soviet Union.

40|$|As the United States {{evolved into}} an {{automotive}} society {{over the course}} of the 20 th century, downtown streets became increasingly clogged with congestion as they were forced to accommodate both through traffic and local trips. A solution emerged in the form of <b>bypass</b> <b>roads</b> that were intended to divert through traffic and trucks around downtown areas and restore good access to local businesses. Just how well <b>bypass</b> <b>roads</b> have succeeded in achieving those purposes has been the subject of a host of studies in other states. But those studies have focused primarily on rural bypasses where the impacts are relatively easy to isolate. The purpose of this study, conducted by the Alan M. Voorhees Transportation Center for the New Jersey Department of Transportation, is to evaluate the before and after impacts of <b>bypass</b> <b>roads</b> in the suburban environment of New Jersey where the impacts are embedded in a broader regional context and have ramifications for regional traffic flows, land use, and economic and social development, as well as interjurisdictional relations. Those for and against building <b>bypass</b> <b>roads</b> essentially agree on the impacts; where they differ is on the consequences. Proponents contend that diverting through traffic...|$|R

25|$|The city is {{surrounded}} on four sides by the Judean Desert and {{is linked to}} Jerusalem and the Tel Aviv Metropolitan Area via Highway 1. Due to its strategic location between {{the northern and southern}} parts of the West Bank, Palestinians see this {{as a threat to the}} territorial continuity of a future Palestinian state. This claim is disputed by mayor Benny Kashriel, who claims that continuity would be attained by circling Ma'ale Adumim to the east. Israeli drivers use a <b>bypass</b> <b>road</b> that exits the city to the west, entering Jerusalem through the French Hill Junction or a tunnel that goes under Mt. Scopus. These routes were built in the wake of the First and Second Intifadas when Palestinian militants shot at motorists and cars were stoned. The previous road passed through al-Eizariya and Abu Dis.|$|E
25|$|The land {{developed}} as Columbus {{was bought by}} General John Tipton and Luke Bonesteel in 1820. Tipton built a log cabin on Mount Tipton, a small hill overlooking White River and the surrounding flat, heavily forested and swampy valley. It held wetlands of the river. The town was first known as Tiptonia, {{named in honor of}} Tipton. The town's name was changed to Columbus on March 20, 1821. General Tipton was upset by the name change and decided to leave the newly founded town. He later was appointed as the highway commissioner for the State of Indiana and was assigned to building a highway from Indianapolis, Indiana to Louisville, Kentucky. When the road reached Columbus, Tipton constructed the first <b>bypass</b> <b>road</b> ever built; it detoured south around the west side of Columbus en route to Seymour.|$|E

25|$|A <b>bypass</b> <b>road</b> for Ormskirk and Burscough {{respectively}} {{was first}} proposed {{as part of}} James Drake's 1949 Road Plan for Lancashire, described as an all-purpose road but later {{considered to be a}} potential motorway by 1958 and given the designation of A59(M). By 1963, Lancashire County Council had dropped the plans for a motorway of this nature, instead deciding to focus later efforts during the mid-1970s on proposing a scheme to improve the A59 link between Liverpool and Preston. This proposal was at the time considered to potentially become the M59 Motorway, with investigations into all practical options being considered, however the motorway was ultimately never constructed. A map published by Lancashire County Council and dated 1974 shows the suggested route of the motorway, starting at the missing M58 motorway junction 2 and continuing north-bound towards Blackpool along the alignment of the A59.|$|E
25|$|The salvage yard, {{which was}} {{situated}} near Noels Pond on , was finished to partial occupancy {{by the fall}} of 1954 and completed in 1955. Thirty Butler Buildings (prefabricated steel) were located on the property. The machinery which constructed the <b>bypass</b> <b>road</b> was buried {{at the end of the}} property when it became over used and obsolete in 1959/1960, under the supervision of Warrant Officer Ebb Higdon, Company A. They were later dug up to be sold for scrap but were found to be useless and reburied. This equipment had come up from Florida in Liberty ships, with the battalion in 1953. In 1986, when this information was made available to the town of Stephenville via a series of articles in the Georgian newspaper, several doubters and curiosity seekers, armed with metal detectors, swarmed over the site and located the buried equipment.|$|E
25|$|State Route 229 {{was also}} defined in 1941, {{connecting}} SR-210 near Alta to SR-152 (now SR-190) near Brighton along a proposed roadway. The definition of SR-210 was changed in 1969 to absorb this mountainous route, but in 1994 it was truncated back to Alta, the extension having not been constructed. Also in 1969, {{the west end}} was changed again, beginning at SR-152 {{near the mouth of}} Big Cottonwood Canyon and following Wasatch Boulevard to the Little Cottonwood Canyon turnoff. The Alta <b>Bypass</b> <b>Road</b> was added to SR-210 in 1975, providing an alternate route when snow slides close the main roadway. A final extension on the west end was made in 1987, continuing north on Wasatch Boulevard and northwest on a then-proposed limited access extension of 6200 South to I-215. However, a year later, this instead became part of the recently-formed SR-190 so that SR-210 would not have to be remileposted.|$|E

50|$|In the Republic of Ireland, {{motorway}} {{and national}} road numbering {{is quite different}} from the UK convention. Since the passage of the Roads Act 1993, all motorways are part of, or form, national primary roads. These routes are numbered in series, (usually, radiating anti-clockwise from Dublin, starting with the N1/M1) using numbers from 1 to 33 (and, separately from the series, 50). Motorways use the number of the route of which they form part, with an M prefix rather than N for national road (or in theory, rather than R for regional road). In most cases, the motorway has been built as a <b>bypass</b> of a <b>road</b> previously forming the national road (e.g. the M7 <b>bypassing</b> <b>roads</b> previously forming the N7)—the <b>bypassed</b> <b>roads</b> are reclassified as regional roads, although updated signposting may not be provided for some time, and adherence to signage colour conventions is lax (regional roads have black-on-white directional signage, national routes use white-on-green).|$|R
