5|$|In 2003, Chia mooted {{the idea}} that Singaporeans {{should be able to}} <b>borrow</b> from their own Central Provident Fund (CPF) savings to tide over periods of {{financial}} difficulty. His rationale was that if individuals could <b>borrow</b> from their own CPF accounts to buy depreciating property and money-losing stocks, there was no reason why they {{should not be allowed to}} do so to pay for bills. Dr. Ong Seh Hong, MP for Aljunied GRC, opposed the view, stating that it was important and for the good of Singapore that Singaporeans were independent individuals who could assume the risks and successes of their investments and be self-sufficient.|$|E

In his evaluation John O'Reilly asks why Wilson sent Gooding back with the two Americans; surely Burnham and Ingram, both seasoned scouts, were enough? Gooding writes in his account that Wilson originally only asked Burnham to ride to Forbes, and that Captain Judd suggested to Wilson that Burnham should take two men with him. The Chief of Scouts requested Ingram, and <b>Borrow</b> asked Gooding to go too. Burnham also says that <b>Borrow</b> sent Gooding.|$|E

The cost of <b>borrowing</b> corporate bonds {{is comparable to the}} cost of <b>borrowing</b> stock, between 10 and 20 basis points per year. Factors that increase <b>borrowing</b> costs are loan size, percentage of inventory lent, rating, and borrower identity. Trading strategies based on cost or amount of <b>borrowing</b> do not yield excess returns. Bonds with corresponding CDS contracts are more actively lent than those without. Finally, the 2007 Credit Crunch did not affect average <b>borrowing</b> cost or loan volume, but increased <b>borrowing</b> cost variance. ...|$|R

On February 15, President Obama approved Henry's request for federal assistance in Carter, Logan and Oklahoma counties. A disaster recovery center {{was set up by}} the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) on February20.

40|$|In this paper, three recent {{morphological}} {{processes are}} studied, i. e. blending, libfixing and clipping. These processes have only just recently become productive in the prestigious global languages of English and/or French. As a result, the speakers of less prestigious and distant languages have <b>borrowed</b> instances {{of these processes}} in their own languages, re-analyzed the <b>borrowed</b> forms and, consequently, introduced the processes underlying these borrowings into their own languages. In this way the grammar of the <b>borrowing</b> languages is influenced by global language contact. The most obvious result of contact between languages is the <b>borrowing</b> of lexical items, but <b>borrowing</b> of non-lexical structural features also occurs. According to Thomason’s (2001 : 70) <b>borrowing</b> scale, the <b>borrowing</b> of content words occurs in situations of casual contact, but as the intensity of this contact increases, more and more categories of lexical items can be <b>borrowed</b> and structural <b>borrowing</b> may also occur...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between Handel's <b>borrowing</b> practice and his {{creation of a new}} genre [...] -the English Biblical oratorio. It focuses on the types of <b>borrowing,</b> the genres Handel <b>borrowed</b> from, and the use of self-borrowing vs. <b>borrowing</b> from other composers. A comprehensive list of borrowings discovered in Handel's Biblical oratorios (Appendix A) allows the patterns in Handel's <b>borrowing</b> practice and the evolution of the genre to be revealed and discussed. Chapter One provides {{a review of the literature}} on Handel's <b>borrowing</b> in general and the historical roots of Handel's Biblical oratorios. Chapter Two looks at the scholarly treatment of Handel's <b>borrowing,</b> and goes on to discuss specific musical examples of three <b>borrowing</b> types: Type I (reuse), Type II (rework), and Type III (new work). The final chapter identifies <b>borrowing</b> patterns that emerge in Handel's early, middle, and late Biblical oratorios. The <b>borrowing</b> type shifts from Type I to Type III, whereas the genres <b>borrowed</b> from change from sacred choral works to secular operas. Self-borrowings dominate in his early oratorios, drastically decrease in the middle period, and increase again in the late period...|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} of Québec academic libraries’ direct reciprocal <b>borrowing</b> statistics from 2005 to 2010 {{reveals that the}} physical distance separating universities {{plays an important role}} in determining the amount of direct reciprocal <b>borrowing</b> activity conducted between institutions. Significant statistical correlations were also seen between the amount of direct reciprocal borrowing/lending as well as institution size and library collection size. Given their proximity, Montréal-area libraries have a higher ratio of direct reciprocal <b>borrowing</b> activity compared to interlibrary loan consortial <b>borrowing</b> activity, whereas libraries located outside of Montréal have higher interlibrary loan activity compared to direct reciprocal <b>borrowing.</b> It was found that institutions’ net lender and borrower status can shift depending on whether one is looking at direct reciprocal <b>borrowing</b> versus interlibrary loan activity. An exploratory social network {{analysis of}} direct reciprocal <b>borrowing</b> amongst Québec academic libraries was performed, and it affirmed the important role of physical distance in determining direct reciprocal <b>borrowing</b> activity.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how net income, non－performing loans, and operational fixed－assets of main bank {{are associated with}} the agency costs of <b>borrowing</b> firms. Results {{of this study indicate that}} the association between non－performing loans and the agency costs of <b>borrowing</b> firms is statistically positive and the association between operational fixed－assets and agency costs of <b>borrowing</b> firms is statistically negative. This implies that non－performing loans and operational fixed－assets of main bank are significantly associated with the agency costs of <b>borrowing</b> firms. Specifically, non－performing loans increase the agency costs of <b>borrowing</b> firms, whereas operational－fixed assets decrease the agency costs of <b>borrowing</b> firms. These results suggest that non－performing loans and operational fixed－assets are significantly associated with not only banks themselves but also the agency costs of <b>borrowing</b> firms.
