30|$|The <b>biosorbent</b> dosage is an {{important}} parameter because this determines the capacity of a <b>biosorbent</b> for a given initial concentration. The biosorption efficiency for Cu(II), Ni(II), Zn(II) and pb(II) ions {{as a function of}} <b>biosorbent</b> dosage was investigated. The percentage of the metal biosorption steeply increases with the <b>biosorbent</b> loading up to 0.5  g/ 0.1  L. This result {{can be explained by the}} fact that the biosorption sites remain unsaturated during the biosorption reaction, whereas the number of sites available for biosorption site increases by increasing the <b>biosorbent</b> dose. The maximum biosorption was attained at <b>biosorbent</b> dosage, 0.5  g/ 0.1 L. Therefore, the optimum <b>biosorbent</b> dosage was taken as 0.5  g/ 0.1 L for further experiments. This can be explained by when the <b>biosorbent</b> ratio is small, the active sites for binding metal ions on the surface of Sjp is less, so the biosorption efficiency is low. As the <b>biosorbent</b> dose increased, more active sites to bind metal ions, thus it results an increase in the biosorption efficiency until saturation.|$|R

[...] However, an extensive body of research has found that a wide variety of commonly discarded waste including eggshells, bones, peat, fungi, seaweed, yeast and carrot peels [...] can efficiently remove toxic heavy metal ions from contaminated water. Ions from metals like mercury can react in the environment to form harmful compounds like methylmercury, a compound known to be toxic in humans. In addition, adsorbing biomass, or <b>biosorbents,</b> can also remove other harmful metals like: arsenic, lead, cadmium, cobalt, chromium and uranium. [...] Biosorption may be used as an environmentally friendly filtering technique. Chitosan is among the biological adsorbents used for heavy metals removal without negative environmental impacts.|$|E

40|$|Pleurotus ostreatus spent {{mushroom}} substrate compost (PSMC) is {{an agricultural}} waste from mushroom cultivation farms. The potential of PSMC as <b>biosorbent</b> for heavy metal biosorption {{in batch mode}} was explored in this study. The optimization and evaluation of washing pretreatment in <b>biosorbent</b> preparation, advanced characterisation of <b>biosorbent,</b> optimization of biosorption, evaluation of existing models, application of <b>biosorbent</b> and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) modeling were investigated. Parameters of 20 g/L <b>biosorbent</b> concentration, two hours immersion time and three cycles of washing pre-treatment were determined as the optimized washing pretreatment conditions in <b>biosorbent</b> preparation. Besides effectively remove contaminants, this new approach not only increased heavy metal biosorption efficiency but also exhibited good repeatability and reproducibility for Ni(II) biosorption efficiency and different batches <b>biosorbent</b> respectively. Results from advanced characterization indicated that PSMC <b>biosorbent</b> has surface area of 5. 5544 x 10 - 1 m 2 /g. The basic component of PSMC is lignocelluloses while minor components are chitin and protein. Carboxyl, hydroxyl and amide functional groups of these components {{were involved in the}} heavy metal biosorption process. Heavy metal biosorption process is complex and involved several simultaneous mechanisms including ion exchange, chemisorptions and complexation. An adopted approach using the experimental design of TORCHIA 13 C ssNMR was applied in <b>biosorbent</b> advanced characterisation analysis. It has ascertained that complexation occurred through lignin-Pb(II) complexes. In order to shorten the time to obtain reliable results and reduced the usage of <b>biosorbent,</b> another adopted approach using half saturation constant concentration was established for optimization of heavy metal biosorption. The half saturation constant <b>biosorbent</b> was found to be at 0. 08 g for Pb(II) and 0. 7 g for both Cu(II) and Ni(II). In single, bi- and multi-heavy metal iii biosorption, the selectivity of <b>biosorbent</b> followed the order of Pb(II), Ni(II) and finally Cu(II). This observation corresponded to the descending order of heavy metal electronegativity. Experimental data are well fitted to Langmuir isotherm, pseudo second-order kinetic and thermodynamic models (r 2 > 0. 88). These data fittings indicate that heavy metal biosorption is a monolayer, not uni-molecular and spontaneous exothermic reaction. Chemisorptions act as rate limiting step in heavy metal biosorption. For application of <b>biosorbent</b> in treatment of automobile wastewater containing Ni(II), a lower biosorption efficiency was observed when compared to single heavy metal solution due to competition of cations and protons for the similar binding sites.

Biosorption equilibrium isotherms are plotted for malathion uptake capacity (Qe) against residual malathion concentration (Ce) in solution. The Qe versus Ce sorption isotherms relationship is expressed mathematically by Langmuir and Freundlich models. The removal of malathion using <b>biosorbents</b> Achyranthes aspera (Uthareni) and Phyllanthus niruri (Nela usiri) from spiked river water samples are found to be 94 % and 96 % respectively. The developed eco-friendly potential <b>biosorbents</b> indicate that the present method can be successfully applied for the quantitative determination and removal of malathion from real water samples...|$|E

In this study synthetic water was used to determine the optimum conditions for Cd (II) removal from synthetic water using the <b>biosorbent</b> as first stage of the study. The effect of <b>biosorbent</b> dosage and particle size, contact time, and pH as well as the initial concentration of Cd (II) was studied.

40|$|The ash of C. polygonoides (locally called balanza) was {{collected}} from Lakki Marwat, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan, and was utilized as <b>biosorbent</b> for methylene blue (MB) removal from aqueous solution. The ash {{was used as}} <b>biosorbent</b> without any physical or chemical treatment. The <b>biosorbent</b> was characterized by using various techniques such as Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The particle size and surface area were measured using particle size analyzer and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller equation (BET), respectively. The SEM and BET results expressed that the adsorbent has porous nature. Effects of various conditions such as initial concentration of methylene blue (MB), initial pH, contact time, dosage of <b>biosorbent,</b> and stirring rate were also investigated for the adsorption process. The rate of the adsorption of MB on biomass sample was fast, and equilibrium has been achieved within 1 hour. The kinetics of MB adsorption on <b>biosorbent</b> was studied by pseudo-first- and pseudo-second-order kinetic models and the pseudo-second-order has better mathematical fit with correlation coefficient value (R 2) of 0. 999.

30|$|For the {{purification}} of alcohols {{derived from}} microbial fermentations, extensive processing is required. Adsorption {{is described as}} one of the most cost-effective and efficient techniques for the separation of water and purification of alcohols. Biobased sorbents (called <b>biosorbents)</b> are advantageous for dehydration of alcohols as they can be developed from cost-effective feedstocks such as waste agricultural biomass or byproducts, have adsorption capacities at par with chemical adsorbents, and can be safely disposed. Alternatively, the spent adsorbents can be reused for fuel or energy production. Agricultural byproducts are low cost and abundantly available materials containing cellulose, hemicellulose, proteins, and lignin as their constituents. <b>Biosorbents</b> have the capability to adsorb water by the polar interaction of their hydroxyl, carboxyl, carbonyl, and amine groups with water molecules. The pore size distribution and thermal stability of <b>biosorbents</b> are also industrially relevant features. They are a promising option to be used in industries for dehydration of alcohols. This paper reviews adsorptive purification of bioalcohols with a focus on using <b>biosorbents,</b> and describes their structure, global availability, water adsorption mechanism, and the use of <b>biosorbents</b> in liquid phase and vapor phase adsorption systems for the purification of ethanol, butanol, and other higher alcohols.|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of sorbents {{that can be}} added to the soil to immobilize pollutants is an area of great interest because of its growing demand. We intend to get <b>biosorbents</b> by interaction of two natural clays (SWy and CTI) and a synthetic hydrotalcite (HT) and its calcination product (HT 500) with the washing water of a natural agro-residue from the olive oil production process. Those <b>biosorbents</b> try to emulate the organo-mineral complexes that can be found or formed in soil, for their use to increase the retention and decrease the mobility of organic pollutants in soils. This process of interaction was previously checked to be beneficial by itself to remove the soluble organic matter (SOM) of the olive mill waste and its toxicity for plants, which represents an additional environmental advantage. Four <b>biosorbents</b> were prepared and the adsorption of diverse contaminants (three herbicides:diuron, terbuthylazine and terbutryn and an organic pollutant: dibenzofuran) was measured. The in situ formation of those <b>biosorbents</b> was tested by previously mixing the clays with the soil,and thereafter the contaminant is added in solution of olive mill waste SOM.

A novel approach of using the half-saturation concentration of <b>biosorbent</b> to rapidly determine the uptake, kinetics and mechanism of biosorption was employed together with cost per unit uptake analysis to determine the {{potential of}} this <b>biosorbent.</b> Fifty per cent nickel (II) biosorption was obtained at a half-saturation constant of 0. 7 g <b>biosorbent</b> concentration, initial pH {{in the range of}} 4 – 8, 10 min contact time, 50 mL 50 mg/L nickel (II) initial concentration. The experimental data were well fitted with the Langmuir isotherm model and the maximum nickel (II) biosorption was 3. 04 mg/g. The results corresponded well to a second pseudo order kinetic model with the coefficient of determination value of 0. 9999. Based on FTIR analysis, the general alkyl, hydroxyl or amino, aliphatic alcohol and carbonyl functional groups of <b>biosorbent</b> were involved in the biosorption process. Therefore, biosorption of nickel (II) must involve several mechanisms simultaneously such as physical adsorption, chemisorption and ion exchange. Cost comparison for PSMC with Amberlite IRC- 86 ion exchange resin indicates that the <b>biosorbent</b> {{has the potential to be}} developed into a cost effective and environmentally friendly treatment system...|$|R
