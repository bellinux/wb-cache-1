50|$|A {{month after}} the premiere of Beat the Devil, DirecTV began airing the entire series in half-hour loops for five weeks, {{on one of the}} <b>blank</b> {{satellite}} <b>channels</b> the system offered. The films were a success and, as a result, DirecTV considered using <b>blank</b> <b>channels</b> to air other companies' ads.|$|R
50|$|For {{monopulse}} radar, {{signal processing}} is identical {{for the main}} lobe and sidelobe <b>blanking</b> <b>channels.</b> This identifies if the object location is in the main lobe {{or if it is}} offset above, below, left or right of the antenna beam.|$|R
30|$|The binding {{kinetics}} between RXRα-LBD and N- 6 {{was analyzed}} at 25 °C on a BIAcore T 200 machine with CM 5 chips (GE Healthcare). PBSP {{was used for}} all measurements. A <b>blank</b> <b>channel</b> was used as negative control. About 10, 000 response units of RXRα-LBD were immobilized on the chip. When the data collection was finished in each cycle, the sensor surface was regenerated with Glycine-HCl 2.5. A series of concentrations of N- 6 ranging from 3.125 to 100  μmol/L were applied for experiment. Sensograms were fit globally with BIAcore T 200 analysis using 1 : 1 Langumuir binding mode.|$|R
5000|$|The Third Wave was an {{experimental}} social movement created by California high school history teacher Ron Jones {{to explain how}} the German population could accept the actions of the Nazi regime during the Second World War. While he taught his students about Nazi Germany during his [...] "Contemporary World History" [...] class, Jones found it difficult {{to explain how the}} German people could accept the actions of the Nazis, and decided to create a social movement as a demonstration of the appeal of fascism. Over the course of five days, Jones conducted a series of exercises in his classroom emphasizing discipline and community, intended to model certain characteristics of the Nazi movement. As the movement grew outside his class and began to number in the hundreds, Jones began to feel that the movement had spiraled out of control. He convinced the students to attend a rally where he claimed the announcement of a Third Wave presidential candidate would be televised. Upon their arrival, the students were presented with a <b>blank</b> <b>channel.</b> Jones told his students of {{the true nature of the}} movement as an experiment in fascism, and presented to them a short film discussing the actions of Nazi Germany.|$|R
50|$|On 4 August 2009, Arsenal TV {{was removed}} from Virgin Media channel 542 and {{replaced}} with an on-screen slate citing that Arsenal TV had ceased broadcasting. On 6 August 2009, Arsenal TV went <b>blank</b> on Sky <b>channel</b> 435, after carrying a similar on-screen closure message during the channel's downtime since 4 August. It was then removed from the Sky EPG on 7 August 2009.|$|R
50|$|KPFT also {{broadcasts}} its signal live {{on their}} HD-1 channel (64k) and related alternate programming on HD-2. Notably, its HD-2 channel {{was home to}} student-run college radio station KTRU but after it signed on a new LPFM on the 96.1 frequency in southwest Houston in October 2015 (it now relies solely on internet streaming to reach listeners outside of that area), KTRU abandoned the HD-2 channel of KPFT, which subsequently fell silent. The now <b>blank</b> HD-2 <b>channel</b> was soon replaced with the programming of the HD-3 channel, which was shut down. Radio Maria Hispana (Houston) the local unit of Radio Maria USA, airs Spanish-language programming for the Hispanic Catholic community on KPFT's subcarrier.|$|R
40|$|In radio astronomy, {{the radio}} {{spectrum}} {{is used to}} detect weak emission from celestial sources. By spectral averaging, noise estimation is reduced and weak sources can be de-tected. However, more and more observations are polluted by man-made radio frequency interferences (RFI). The im-pact of these RFI on spectral measurement ranges from total saturation to tiny distortions of the data. To some extent, the final spectral estimation can be preserved by <b>blanking</b> in-fected <b>channels</b> in real time. With this aim in view, a com-plete real time processing line has been implemented {{on a set of}} FPGA and DSP. The current functionalities of the sys-tem are high dynamic range (at least 70 dB), band selection facilities (from 875 kHz to 14 MHz), high spectral resolu-tion through polyphase filter bank (up to 8192 channels with 49152 coefficients) and real time time-frequency blanking with a robust threshold detector. 1...|$|R

The impact of these RFIs on power spectral measurement ranges from total saturation to subtle distortions of the data.

This receiver has been used to reobserve the IIIWZ 35 astronomical source which has been scrambled by a strong satellite RFI for several years.|$|R
50|$|Some {{channels}} {{were not}} launched on 1 September 1993, but were added later; including QVC which launched on 1 October 1993, and VH1 which launched on 1 October 1994. When VH1 Germany launched in 1995, VideoCrypt decoders would <b>blank</b> out the <b>channel</b> to UK viewers and {{prevent them from}} watching the German channel free. Nick at Nite, although {{part of the original}} Multichannels plan, did not launch. Sky Soap and Sky Travel also launched on 3 October 1994 as part of the package. The launch of Astra 1D allowed Sky to expand the multichannels package further, including the launch of Sky's pay-per-view Box Office channels in January 1997.|$|R
30|$|Two 16 -mer {{peptides}} {{corresponding to}} the human (CGNRWHEGYRQTPREDS) and mouse (CQNGWQGKNPPTPSEDS) forms of the CD 44 v 6 antigen used to generate AbD 15179 were produced by peptide synthesis (Elim Biopharmaceuticals, Hayward, CA, USA). The peptide antigens were individually conjugated to bovine serum albumin (BSA) through N-terminal cysteine residues. Purified recombinant CD 44 v 3 - 10 (see [28] for details) and the two carrier-conjugated peptides were immobilized on a ProteOn XPR 36 general layer medium biosensor chip (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) using amine coupling. This yielded immobilization levels of approximately 1, 000 (CD 44 isoform) and 300 (BSA-peptides) response units, respectively. A CD 44 isoform that lacks the v 6 region (CD 44 v 3 - 10 Δv 6) was included as a negative control in one channel. Dilution series of AbD 15179 (0.6 to 50 nM) were injected at 25 °C with a flow rate of 50  μl/min. PBS containing 0.05 % Tween 20 (pH  7.4) was used as running buffer, and the surfaces were regenerated using 10  mM HCl. The chimeric anti-CD 44 v 6 monoclonal antibody U 36 [30] {{was used as a}} positive control. Binding curves were normalized using a <b>blank</b> ligand <b>channel</b> and a parallel buffer injection prior to fitting to a 1 : 1 Langmuir isotherm using the ProteOn manager software version 3.1. 0.6 (Bio-Rad).|$|R
40|$|Summary This {{pamphlet}} {{provides guidance}} on conducting the five types of training analyses: needs, mission, collective task, job, and individual task analysis.

S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) activities and The Army School System (TASS) Training Battalions responsible for managing or performing Training Development (TD) or TD-related functions, including evaluation/quality assurance of the training, products, and institutions that present the training. It also applies to non-TRADOC agencies/organizations having Memorandums of Understanding, Memorandums of Agreement, and contracts for developing training or training products for TRADOC and TASS agencies and organizations.
