40|$|The species {{composition}} of by-catch was {{studied in the}} Spanish Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) fishery, developed in the NAFO Regulatory Area in Div. 3 L, 3 M and 3 NO, for the period 1991 – 94. Of the 17 species occurring in the catches, two groups were identified as the more and less frequent species. The more frequent species with an annual yield of about 5 kg/hr were roughhead grenadier, roundnose grenadier, skate, American plaice, redfish, witch flounder and <b>blue</b> <b>antimora.</b> Analyzing the data {{on a monthly basis}} revealed some species such as grenadiers, skate and American plaice, particularly in Div. 3 N, did not change much while other species had increased yields in recent years. The characteristic species of the demersal fisheries (skate, American plaice) showed a wide bathymetric distribution. The transfer of effort southwards to Div. 3 NO in recent years, mainly in the case of small vessels, has meant variation in the composition and relative abundance of by-catch in this fleet. The proportion of each by-catch species was highly variable. Skate, American plaice, witch flounder and grenadiers were caught most frequently in both fleets. In the large vessels, however, <b>blue</b> <b>antimora,</b> redfish and roundnose grenadier were more frequent than in the small vessels. The length distribution in the discarded proportion was analyzed for the two grenadiers, skate and <b>blue</b> <b>antimora.</b> In general, the length distribution of the proportion discarded showed a wide range...|$|R
40|$|The depth‑distribution of {{the main}} deep‑sea fish species in Divisions 3 LMN of the NAFO Regula-tory Area is {{analysed}} using data from a longline survey carried out between 708 and 3 028 m depths in 1996. The {{results indicate that the}} most commercially important deep-sea species, Greenland halibut and roughhead grenadier, were only distributed up to 2 000 m depth. Below this depth another deep-sea species, the armed grenadier, replaced Greenland halibut and roughhead grenadier. The species which showed the widest depth‑distribution were <b>blue</b> <b>antimora,</b> smalleyed rabbitfish and skates (700 m to about 3 000 m). Two species, the roughhead grenadier and the <b>blue</b> <b>antimora,</b> made up more than 60 % of the catch in weight. Depth was the factor which most influenced the distribution of the species, af-fecting both yield and mean length of the catch. Mean length of the catch increased with depth in the majority of species. The yield of all species combined increased with depth between 700 and 1 500 m, where it reached a mean yield of 536 kg per 1 430 hooks. Below this depth the yield diminished.

40|$|The {{efficient}} {{investment of}} resources and effort into conservation strategies depends on the accurate identification of management units. At the same time, understanding the processes by which population structure evolves requires {{an understanding of the}} conditions under which panmixia may exist. Here, we study a species with an unusual, apparently sex-biased pattern of distribution, and test the hypothesis that distribution processes associated with this pattern (for example, congregating at a single dominant spawning site or periodic mixing during reproduction) could lead to panmixia over a large geographic range. Using 13 microsatellite markers, we compared 393 <b>blue</b> <b>hake</b> (<b>Antimora</b> rostrata) from 11 sample sites across a geographic range of over 3000 [*]km, and found no evidence of population structure. We estimated current effective population size and found it to be large (∼ 15 [*] 000) across the sampled area. In addition, we used simulation models to test expectations about demographic correlation among populations and our ability to detect relevant levels of gene flow. All data were consistent with the interpretation of long-range panmixia...|$|R
40|$|Seasonal time-series of {{temperature}} and salinity around Iceland have been collected, with repeat observations at stations, {{since the start}} of the 1970 s. After fairly cold years during the early 1990 s, a reversal occurred during the mid- 1990 s and the period from 1996 to 2010 was one with warmer, more saline water in shelf seas around Iceland. Temperatures and salinities have been frequently above the long-term mean in the waters to the south and west of the country, and these conditions have also influenced the shelf area north of the country. Marked changes have also been observed in the distribution of many fish species during this warm period. Southern commercial species have extended farther north (e. g. haddock, monkfish, mackerel), a northern species is retreating (capelin), rare species and vagrants have been observed more frequently (e. g. greater fork beard, <b>blue</b> <b>antimora,</b> snake pipefish, sea lamprey, Ray’s bream), and 31 species, from both shelf and oceanic waters, have been recorded for the first time since 1996. The most obvious explanation for these changes in the ecosystem has to be the warming of 1 – 28 C in the waters south and west of Iceland during the past 15 years...|$|R
50|$|A 2006 {{study by}} Canadian {{scientists}} has found five species of deep-sea fish - <b>blue</b> <b>hake,</b> spiny eel - {{to be on}} the verge of extinction due to the shift of commercial fishing from continental shelves to the slopes of the continental shelves, down to depths of 1600 meters. The slow reproduction of these fish - they reach sexual maturity at about the same age as human beings - is one of the main reasons that they cannot recover from the excessive fishing.|$|R
50|$|The blue grenadier, hoki, <b>blue</b> <b>hake,</b> New Zealand whiptail, whiptail or whiptail hake, Macruronus novaezelandiae, is a merluccid hake of {{the family}} Merlucciidae found around {{southern}} Australia and New Zealand at depths of between 10 and 1000 m. It feeds in midwater on small squids, crustaceans, and fish. Its length is between 60 and 120 cm. It is a slender, silvery fish similar in appearance to the gemfish. The meat of the fish is white and almost always sold in filets.|$|R
40|$|We {{deployed}} 2 porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) carcasses at bathyal depth (2555 to 2710 m) in the Porcupine Seabight, NE Atlantic {{for periods}} of 1 wk and 6 mo respectively. Consumption rates of 0. 085 and 0. 078 kg h– 1 {{were similar to}} those observed at abyssal depths in the Atlantic, and 1 order of magnitude slower than at bathyal depth in the Pacific. A distinct succession of scavenging species was observed at both carcasses: the abyssal grenadier Coryphaenoides armatus and the cusk eel Spectrunculus grandis numerically dominated the initial phase of carcass consumption and, once the bulk of the soft tissue had been removed (by Day 15), were succeeded by the squat lobster Munidopsis crassa. The <b>blue</b> <b>hake</b> <b>Antimora</b> rostrata and amphipod numbers were unexpectedly low, and consumption was attributed largely to direct feeding by C. armatus. The interaction of a crustacean prey species (M. crassa) and cephalopod predator (Benthoctopus sp.) was observed for the first time, revealing that large food falls also attract secondary predators that do not utilise the food fall directly. The staying time of a single parasitised C. armatus (18 h) greatly exceeded previous estimates (≤ 8 h). This study describes the first large food fall to be monitored at high frequency over a 6 mo period, and the first observations of a large food fall at bathyal depth in the NE Atlantic. It enables direct comparison with similarly sized food falls at abyssal depth, much larger megacarrion falls, and similar studies differing in geographic location, in particular those carried out under Pacific whale migration corridors...|$|R
40|$|Data from EU-Spain (Instituto Español de Oceanografía) {{bottom trawl}} surveys in the NAFO Regulatory Area (2002 – 2011) were {{analyzed}} to examine {{patterns on the}} South of Grand Banks (NAFO Div. 3 NO) of groundfish assemblage structure and diversity in relation to depth. The 1160 hauls from the slope surveys spanned between 38 and 1460 m in depth. We focused on the 28 most abundant species, which made up 92. 6 % of the catch in terms of biomass. Assemblage structure was strongly correlated with depth. For the most part, changes in assemblages seem to be fairly continuous, although there were more abrupt changes at 300 m. Five assemblages were identified. Two shallow assemblages {{were found in the}} shelf. Assemblage I (Shallow) comprises the strata with depths lesser than 150 and include yellowtail flounder (Limanda ferruginea), American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides), Northern sand lance (Ammodytes dubius), moustache sculpin (Triglops murrayi), capelin (Mallotus villosus) and web sculpin (Hemitripterus americanus). Assemblage II (Shallow) includes the strata with depths between 151 and 300 m and comprises Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), American angler (Lophius americanus), wolfish (Anarichas lupus) and thorny skate (Amblyraja radiata). Assemblage III (Intermediate) contains the depth strata between 301 and 600 m. Redfish (Sebastes spp.), spotted wolfish (Anarhichas minor), Arctic eelpout (Lycodes reticulatus), Northern wolfish (Anarhichas denticulatus), white hake (Urophycis tenuis), witch flounder (Glyptocephalus cynoglossus) and longfin hake (Phycis chesteri) were included in the intermediate assemblage. Finally, we found two deep clusters: Assemblage IV (Deep) contains the depths between 601 and 1000 m, and Assemblage V (Deep) the depth strata greater than 1001 m. Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides), marlin-spike (Nezumia bairdii), roughhead grenadier (Macrourus berglax) and spinytail skate (Bathyraja spinicauda) formed Assemblage IV. Snubnosed spiny eel (Notacanthus chemnitzii), <b>blue</b> <b>antimora</b> (Antimora rostrata), Northern cutthroat eel (Syphanobranchus kaupii), roundnose grenadier (Coryphaenoides rupestris), black dogfish (Centroscyllium fabricii), Arctic skate (Amblyraja hyperborean) and longnose chimera (Harriotta raleighana) made up the deepest assemblage. Despite dramatic changes in biomass and abundance of the species in the area, the boundaries and composition of the assemblages seem to be similar to the period before the collapse. Although some changes were evident, the main ones were replacements of the dominant species in several assemblages and bathymetric range extension of distribution of some species. Yellowtail flounder appears to be the dominant species in the shallowest assemblage instead of Atlantic cod and American plaice that were dominant in the period before the collapse in the area; redfish is the dominant species in the second shallow and intermediate assemblages. Diversity appears inversely related to biomass in the different assemblages. Despite the fishing effort in the deep waters of the Grand Banks, the overall pattern of demersal fish assemblages remains similar over time. This pattern is similar in other Atlantic areas; it indicates that changes in the fish populations in Northwest Atlantic have been produced on a large scale and are not limited to specific areas...|$|R
40|$|Data {{from the}} EU (Spain-Portugal) bottom trawl surveys in the Division 3 M of the NAFO Regulatory Area (2004 - 2013) were {{analyzed}} to examine patterns on this zone of groundfish assemblage structure and diversity {{in relation to}} depth. 1699 hauls between 129 and 1460 m in depth were carried out. We focused on the 29 most abundant species, which made up 87. 5 % of the catch in terms of biomass. Assemblage structure was strongly correlated with depth. For the most part, changes in assemblages seem to be fairly continuous, although there were more abrupt changes at 600 m. Three main assemblages were identified. A shallow assemblage {{was found in the}} shelf. Assemblage I (Shallow) comprises the strata with depths lesser than 250 m and include American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides), witch flounder (Glyptocephalus cynoglossus) and Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). Assemblage II (Intermediate) includes the strata with depths between 251 and 600 m and comprises Acadian redfish (Sebastes fasciatus), Arctic eelpout (Lycodes reticulates), thorny skate (Amblyraja radiata), longfin hake (Phycis chesteri), deepwater redfish (Sebastes mentella), spinytail skate (Bathyraja spinicauda) and Northern wolffish (Anarichas denticulatus). Three species are present in the two first assemblages: Atlantic wolffish (Anarichas lupus), golden redfish (Sebastes marinus) and spotted wolffish (Anarichas minor). Assemblage III (Deep) contains the depth strata greater than 601 m. Marlin-spike (Nezumia bairdii), scaly dragonfish (Stomias boa), Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides), sloane’s viperfish (Chaulonius sloani), black dogfish (Centroscyllium fabricii), Snubnosed spiny eel (Notacanthus chemitzii), roughhead grenadier (Macrourus berglax), roundnose grenadier (Coryphaenoides rupestris), <b>blue</b> <b>antimora</b> (Antimora rostrata), threadfin rockling (Gaidropsarus ensis), bean’s sawtoothed eel (Serrivomer beanii), Northern cutthroat eel (Syphanobranchus kaupii), lanternfish (Lampanyctus sp), vahls’s eelpout (Lycodes vahlii), Arctic skate (Amblyraja hyperborea) and Demon catshark (Apristurus sp) formed Assemblage III. Despite dramatic changes in biomass and abundance of the species in the area, the boundaries and composition of the assemblages seem to be similar to the period before the collapse. Extending depth range to 1460 m, no another boundaries were found. Although some changes were evident, the main ones were replacements of the dominant species in several assemblages and bathymetric range extension of distribution of some species. Acadian redfish and golden redfish appear to be the dominant species in the shallowest assemblage instead of Atlantic cod that were dominant in the period before the collapse in the area; redfish is the dominant species in the second shallow and intermediate assemblages. Diversity appears inversely related to biomass in the different assemblages. Despite the collapse in some species and the permanent fishing activity target to the North Shrimp (Pandalus borealis), redfish (Sebastes spp) and Greenland halibut, the overall pattern of demersal fish assemblages remains similar over time. This pattern is similar in other Atlantic areas; it indicates that changes in the fish populations in Northwest Atlantic have been produced on a large scale and are not limited to specific areas...|$|R

40|$|Skin {{and muscle}} from 43 {{bottlenose}} dolphins (38 juveniles/adults, 5 calves) stranded in NW Spain were analysed {{to determine whether}} stable isotope ratios (δ 13 C and δ 15 N) {{could be used to}} assess dietary variation, habitat segregation and population substructure. Results were compared with published stomach contents data. Stable isotope ratios from 17 known prey species were also determined. Isotope ratios of the main prey (<b>blue</b> whiting, <b>hake)</b> varied significantly in relation to fish body size. Dolphin calves showed significant heavy isotope enrichments compared to adult females. Excluding calves, δ 15 N decreased with increasing dolphin body size, probably related to an ontogenetic shift in diet towards species at lower trophic levels, e. g. on blue whiting as suggested by stomach content results. Bottlenose dolphins were divided into two putative populations (North, South) based on previous genetic studies, and values of δ 13 C and δ 15 N differed significantly between these two groups, confirming the existence of population structuring...|$|R

PTB 2 shows a seasonal pattern related to the reproductive cycle of mackerel off the Cantabrian coast in the Bay of Biscay.

40|$|Quasi-synoptic {{surveys of}} the European {{continental}} shelf edge have been conducted since the spring of 1994 by participants in the Shelf Edge Fisheries Oceanography Study (SEFOS). The purpose of the surveys is primarily to address questions concerning the eastern boundary current raised by fishery biologists, as the eastern boundary or slope current is intimately involved in the life history of many important European commercial fish species, such as mackerel, horse mackerel, <b>blue</b> whiting and <b>hake.</b> In all 21 sections were defined crossing the shelf edge from Portugal to Norway. The majority of these were occupied {{by a number of}} European laboratories between March and June 1994. Sections across the shelf edge have been used to examine the location and characteristics of the current in the different observational regions. Diagrams of t-S have been employed to describe the water masses involved in the slope current.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{different}} factors (spawning biomass, environmental conditions) on recruitment {{is a subject}} of great importance {{in the management of}} fisheries, recovery plans and scenario exploration. In this study, recently proposed supervised classification techniques, tested by the machine-learning community, are applied to forecast the recruitment of seven fish species of North East Atlantic (anchovy, sardine, mackerel, horse mackerel, <b>hake,</b> <b>blue</b> whiting and albacore), using spawning, environmental and climatic data. In addition, the use of the probabilistic flexible naive Bayes classifier (FNBC) is proposed as modelling approach in order to reduce uncertainty for fisheries management purposes. Those improvements aim is to improve probability estimations of each possible outcome (low, medium and high recruitment) based in kernel density estimation, which is crucial for informed management decision making with high uncertainty. Finally, a comparison between goodness-of-fit and generalization power is provided, in order to assess the reliability of the final forecasting models. It is found that in most cases the proposed methodology provides useful information for management whereas the case of horse mackerel {{is an example of the}} limitations of the approach. The proposed improvements allow for a better probabilistic estimation of the different scenarios, i. e. to reduce the uncertainty in the provided forecasts...|$|R
40|$|A partir del buidatge exhaustiu dels fulls de subhasta del peix i de les fitxes tècniques de les embarcacions de la Confraria del Port de Llançà, es fa una anàlisi cronològica qualitativa i quantitativa dels darrers vint anys de pesca. La flota, inicialment constituïda per barques d'arrossegament i de pesca artesanal (palangre petit i tresmail), ha anat evolucionant, i ha quedat bàsicament constituïda actualment pel ròssec i el palangre de fons, que ha substituit progressivament la pesca artesanal. Les pesqueries, notablement multiespecífiques els primers anys, van donar pas, bàsicament amb la incorporació del radar, a una pesca molt més selectiva, dominada essencialment per la captura de lluç entre els anys 1980 i 1985. La progressiva incorporació del palangre de fons fa que a partir del 1986 es tendeixi novament cap a una captura més multiespecífica, perd amb canvis qualitatius importants en la composició d'espècies capturades en relació amb els primers anysA {{fisheries}} chronological {{analysis of}} the Llançà fishing port (Costa Brava, Lyon Gulf) is presented in this study. Data were collected from the purchase slips and the files of fleet performance indicators, archived by the 'Fisherman's Society of Llancà fishing port', {{during the period from}} 1977 to 1996. In the first years of this period, Llancà's fleet was composed basically of bottom trawl vessels and artisanal fishing boats (inshore longline and gill net). A progressive evolution has finished now with a clear substitution of the artisanal fishery by a offshore longline fleet. Due to radar's joint, multispecies fisheries observed in early years become single-species fisheries during 1980 and 1985, dominated by hake catches. Successive increases in the number of offshore longline vessels since 1986, has again produced a tendency to multispecies fisheries but with important changes in the species composition of the catches refered to in the early years. Between 1977 and 1979 the most commonly species caught were <b>hake</b> and <b>blue</b> whiting. From 1980 to 1985 the blue whiting disappeared of the fishery and the hake became the most important, followed by angler fish. In this period two species disappeared: gilthead seabream and ray.
