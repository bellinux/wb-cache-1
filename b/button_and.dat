5|$|Häkkinen {{began to}} pull away from Trulli. Although Button tried to pass Trulli on the fourth lap at the Bus Stop chicane, he ran wide and lost third {{position}} to Michael Schumacher. On that lap, Alesi was the first driver to pit for dry tyres. By the beginning of the fifth lap Häkkinen increased his lead over Trulli to ten seconds, ahead of Michael Schumacher, <b>Button</b> <b>and</b> Coulthard. Button attempted to overtake Trulli around the outside of the Bus Stop chicane, but left the inside open for Schumacher to pass him for third place. Schumacher then took second place from Trulli at La Source. Button attempted to follow Schumacher down the inside, but made contact with the latter. Trulli was sent into a spin, becoming the first retirement of the race. Button lost two positions to Coulthard and Ralf Schumacher in the incident. On the next lap Michael and Ralf Schumacher were the first leaders to pit for dry tyres, as Alesi began setting faster lap times than the front-runners. Häkkinen made a pit stop from the lead on lap seven, followed by <b>Button,</b> <b>and</b> re-emerged ahead of Coulthard to retain the lead. Coulthard made his pit stop on the following lap, re-emerging in ninth position.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} {{practice}} session, Alonso set the fastest lap {{of the day}} with a time of 1:39.283; Red Bull drivers Vettel and Webber finished with the second and third-fastest times. Rosberg was fourth, ahead of Hamilton and Kubica. Massa, Adrian Sutil, <b>Button</b> <b>and</b> Barrichello followed in the top-ten. Massa caused the session to be disrupted after spinning in the fourth corner and narrowly avoided making contact with the barrier. The session was red-flagged to allow Massa's car to be removed from the centre of the track to be taken to the pit lane. Timo Glock's lost the use of his car's fifth gear and pulled {{over to the side of}} the track at turn twelve which prematurely ended his running. Vitaly Petrov spun at the exit of turn 14 and reversed his car to rejoin the circuit, avoiding the need for a red-flag. Vettel was the fastest driver in the final practice session with a lap of 1:38.052; Webber was third-fastest. Kubica separated the two Red Bull drivers in second, with Sutil fourth. Alonso was fifth-fastest, and Barrichello was sixth. Vitantonio Liuzzi, Massa, <b>Button</b> <b>and</b> Hamilton rounded out the top ten.|$|E
5|$|Joust is an arcade game {{developed}} by Williams Electronics and released in 1982. While {{not the first}} game to feature two-player cooperative play, Joust was more successful than its predecessors and popularized the concept. The player uses a <b>button</b> <b>and</b> joystick to control a knight riding a flying ostrich. The object is to progress through levels by defeating groups of enemy knights riding buzzards.|$|E

However, they discover the reset <b>button</b> <b>and</b> attempt to enter the code. As they reach it, Schwartz appears and attempts to stop them, but he in turn is stopped by Cerberus. Cerberus helps Kip and Medly, having learned that he too is a rogue and had false memories implanted by the corporation to make him believe {{that he had a}} life outside Planet B. The code is activated and the button is pressed, resetting the whole of Planet B.|$|E
5|$|Magnussen made {{a second}} pit {{stop at the}} end of lap 16 for a {{steering-wheel}} change. On lap 17 Ricciardo went to the outside of Massa on the S-curves and moved inside, passing Massa to move into sixth. Rosberg was informed by team radio that more rain was expected within eight minutes. Vettel overtook Bottas around the outside for fourth place on the next lap. Bottas fell to fifth on the 19th lap, when Ricciardo passed him around the outside on the S-curves. Vettel began to reduce the time deficit to third-place <b>Button,</b> <b>and</b> Ricciardo was driving at a speed similar to his teammate. Bottas was caught by his Williams teammate Massa, who pulled away from Hülkenberg (who went off the track at the second turn). Both Red Bull drivers were the fastest by lap 21, but were 13 seconds behind <b>Button</b> <b>and</b> a further five seconds behind Rosberg (who, despite running off the track at 130R corner, had a shrinking one-second advantage over Hamilton). A dry line began to emerge by this time as some drivers drove through standing water to keep their tyre temperatures down.|$|E

5|$|The basic close combat from {{previous}} installments has been heavily refined and expanded into the CQC system. When unarmed or using a one-handed weapon, Snake can grab opponents {{and put them}} in a chokehold, at which point a variety of actions can be performed, such as choking the enemy unconscious, slitting the enemy's throat, or interrogating them at knifepoint to obtain information. The context, pressure applied to the <b>button,</b> <b>and</b> movement of the analog stick determine the action performed.|$|E
5|$|The chipset {{brought a}} 1066MHz system bus, use of DDR3 system memory, and {{integrated}} Nvidia GeForce 9400M graphics. Other changes include a display which uses LED backlights (replacing the fluorescent tube backlights {{used in the}} previous model) and arsenic-free glass, a new Mini DisplayPort (replacing the polycarbonate MacBook's mini-DVI port), a multi-touch glass trackpad which also acts as the mouse <b>button,</b> <b>and</b> {{the removal of the}} FireWire 400 port (thus it doesn't support Target Disk Mode, used for data transfers or operating system repairs without booting the system).|$|E

5|$|Absolutely. There's a {{song called}} 'Army of Me,' {{which is sort of}} a 'Fighter 2.0.' There is a new {{generation}} of fans from a younger demographic that might not have been with me all the way but that watch me on the show now. I feel like every generation should be able to enjoy and have their piece of 'Fighter' within. This time, the way it musically came together it just felt right for this time and this generation. There's {{always going to be a}} fighter in me getting through some obstacle and some hurdle. All these 6-year-olds who know me from pushing my <b>button</b> <b>and</b> turning around in a big red chair who weren't around for the actual 'Fighter,' this is my chance to recharge it, rejuvenate it and do something modernized for them.|$|E
5|$|Championship leader Michael Schumacher {{started from}} pole {{position}} alongside Jordan driver Jarno Trulli. The race was aborted {{due to a}} software glitch in the starting procedure and Jenson <b>Button</b> <b>and</b> Pedro de la Rosa collided which started a traffic jam. At the second start, Michael Schumacher maintained his lead into the first corner. After {{the second round of}} pit stops, Michael Schumacher's exhaust broke causing a left rear suspension failure and his retirement from the race. Coulthard, in second place, became the new race leader on lap 57. Coulthard maintained his lead throughout the remainder of the race and secured his second victory of the season, with Barrichello a further 15.8 seconds back.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the rain}} that had fallen, the drivers went out on track on {{intermediate}} tyres {{at the beginning of}} Q3. On these tyres, Hamilton set the fastest time, followed by <b>Button</b> <b>and</b> Ricciardo. The track dried quickly however, and soon the cars returned to the pit lane to switch to slick tyres. Hülkenberg twice set the fastest time, but was beaten to pole position by Hamilton. Rosberg went faster as well, but lost his second place on the grid to Hülkenberg due to his five-place grid penalty. Vettel went fourth fastest, but was relegated as well, handing third on the grid to Button, who had set the fifth fastest time. Räikkönen, Ricciardo, Valtteri Bottas, Verstappen and Felipe Massa rounded up the top ten. It was Hülkenberg's second front row start of his career, the first having been his pole position at the 2010 Brazilian Grand Prix.|$|E
