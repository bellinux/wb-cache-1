The flow {{structures}} and their interactions <b>behind</b> side-by-side <b>cylinders</b> of unequal diameters at small gap ratios are studied by dye-flow visualization and particle image velocimetry at Reynolds number 1000. The whole-field mean and fluctuating velocity distributions and evolutions in the wakes are studied by the particle image velocimetry. As the gap ratio decreases, the mutual {{interaction of the}} wakes <b>behind</b> side-by-side <b>cylinders</b> pushes the recirculation region <b>behind</b> the large <b>cylinder</b> farther downstream {{at the expense of}} deterioration of the wake <b>behind</b> small <b>cylinder.</b> This change is important and may be relevant to the applications of passive flow control strategy...|$|R

40|$|The flow characteristics, mutual {{interactions}} and downstream evolutions of the wakes <b>behind</b> the sideby-side <b>cylinders</b> of unequal diameter are illustrated by flow visualization and Laser Doppler Anemometry. All the experiments are {{conducted in a}} recirculating water channel at Reynolds number 600. The gapratio is 0. 75 and the diameter ratio is 2. 0. Periodic excitations are applied to the large cylinder with constantexcitation amplitude. Within the excitation frequency range studied, the wake behind the large cylinderexperiences the primary and the one third sub-harmonics lock-on; whereas the wakes <b>behind</b> thesmall <b>cylinder</b> are not locked-on. For the wake <b>behind</b> the large <b>cylinder</b> experiencing the primary lockon,the gap flow becomes unbiased and the gap vortices are observed to interact and shed alternately intothe wake <b>behind</b> each <b>cylinder</b> in synchronization with the excitation frequency (the natural vortex sheddingfrequency of large cylinder). The synchronized flow patterns exist only in the near wake region; inthe downstream region, only one wider wake dominated by the excitation frequency is detected.

To correlate data at different Reynolds numbers and to discriminate turbulent wakes from laminar wakes, a linearized theory for the laminar far wake was developed, which included the effects of axial pressure gradient.

40|$|The lock-on characteristics, the {{detailed}} interactions and downstream evolutions of the wakes <b>behind</b> side-by-side <b>cylinders</b> of unequal diameter (D/d = 2), spaced by a gap ratio 0. 75 (G/D = 0. 75), are investigated at Reynolds number 600 by the dye flow visualization, laser Doppler anemometry (LDA) and particle image velocimeter (PIV) velocity measurements. The lock-on frequency bands are studied by LDA and PIV at Reynolds number 2, 000. The D, d and G are the diameters of the large, the small cylinders {{and the net}} gap between two cylinders, respectively. Periodic excitations, in form of rotary oscillation about the cylinder center, are applied to the large cylinder with the same amplitude. It is found that while the large cylinder is excited, two lock-on frequency bands of the wake <b>behind</b> the large <b>cylinder</b> are detected. These two lock-on frequency bands correspond to the primary and the one-third sub-harmonic lock-on of the wake <b>behind</b> large <b>cylinder,</b> respectively. These two lockon frequency bands distribute symmetrically about the fundamental and the third superharmonic of the natural shedding frequency <b>behind</b> a single <b>cylinder</b> at the same Reynolds number. The left-shifted frequency band (1. 8 B fe/fos B 2. 0) is not considered as a locked-on frequency band because the phase difference between two excitation frequencies across fe/fos = 2. 0 vary significantly. While the wake <b>behind</b> the large <b>cylinder</b> is locked-on at fe/ 3 (or fos), the gap flow becomes unbiased {{and the frequency of}} the wake <b>behind</b> small <b>cylinder</b> remains around the natural shedding frequency. Thus, the frequency band of 3. 0 B fe/fos B 3. 22 is also not locked-on because the phase difference in the narrow wake excited at fe/fos = 2. 93 and 3. 07 changes significantly. Note fe and fos denote the excitation frequency and the natural shedding frequency behind a single large cylinder, respectively...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study was conducted}} on heat transfer from slightly heated circular cylinders in cross flow. Emphasis {{was placed on the}} combined influence of the scale of free-stream turbulence and the diameter of the cylinder on the rate of heat transfer at the rear stagnation point. By using a hot-wire anemometer, spectrum analysis of the anemometer signal with a Fourier analyzer is employed to investigate the separated shear layer formed <b>behind</b> the circular <b>cylinder.</b> The Nusselt number at the rear stagnation point varies with the scale ratio of turbulence and cylinder diameter, although the Reynolds number is the same. Corresponding streamwise profile of the separated shear layer is also influenced. The laminar-to-turbulent transition region moves in the streamwise direction because of a variation of the scale ratio. It was discovered that the heat transfer characteristics <b>behind</b> <b>cylinders</b> are affected by the scale ratio, and are closely related to the streamwise movement of the region of transition to turbulence in the separated shear layer...|$|R

The frequencies of the cylinder have been changed from 10 to 30 Hz. When a cylinder has been oscillated normal to the uniform flow direction, the width of the wake <b>behind</b> the <b>cylinder</b> becomes large.

40|$|At Reynolds numbers below 10 ^ 4 {{the inner}} viscous wake <b>behind</b> <b>cylinders</b> at Mach 6 is entirely laminar. At these low Reynolds numbers the outer wake {{caused by the}} bow shock becomes {{transitional}} thousands of diameters downstream. Flowfield measurements (Part I) indicated strong deviations from the behavior of laminar steady flow from a certain point on, suggesting a division into linear and nonlinear wake instability regions. Fluctuation measurements confirm this supposition at four Reynolds numbers. Wake instabilities were investigated experimentally up to a distance of 12, 000 dimeters <b>behind</b> the <b>cylinder</b> in a Reynolds number range of 200 to 4, 000. Additional measurements were performed in the regime where both inner and outer wake instabilities occur. In the linear region close correspondence with linear inviscid stability theory was found. The nonlinear instability region is a long stretched-out region {{in comparison with the}} wake at low speeds behind a flat plate.

The LES results revealed that for T/d= 3, the formation of symmetrical wakes <b>behind</b> the <b>cylinders</b> was observed. Two distinct vortex streets propagated downstream. However, for T/d= 1. 7, owing to the close proximity of the two cylinders, the gap flow between the cylinders was deflected, forming one narrow and one wide wake <b>behind</b> the <b>cylinders.</b> It was also succinctly revealed that the gap flow deflection {{has a tendency to}} "flip", changing over from one side to another by being deflected upwards at a specific instance and downwards at later time.

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of wake structures <b>behind</b> two square <b>cylinders</b> arranged {{side by side}} were investigated experimentally, using particle image velocimetry (PIV), fiber laser Doppler velocimetry (FLDV), and flow visualization technique. The Reynolds number (Re), based on the free stream velocity (U 0) and the width of square cylinder (H), varies from 2500 to 8000, and the net gap ration (δ=G/H, G is the net gap between two cylinders) changes from 0 to 3. 0. Based upon the experimental results corresponding to different net gap ratios for Re= 3500, {{it is found that}} the gap flow patterns can be classified into four categories. These categories are defined as (1) gap flow without deflection: the axis of gap flow is parallel to the central axis between two cylinders, and the mean flow field is symmetric with respect to the central axis; (2) intermittently switching gap flow: the gap flow deflects either to the upper or to the lower cylinder intermittently, and the narrow wake is formed <b>behind</b> the <b>cylinder</b> to which the gap flow deflects and the wide wake appears <b>behind</b> the other <b>cylinder</b> correspondingly; (3) bistably deflected gap flow: the gap flow bistably biases wither upward or downward; (4) weak gap flow in switching motion: the wake can be regarded as the one <b>behind</b> a rectangular <b>cylinder</b> which has the length 2 times of the width of each cylinder. Furthermore, in order to illustrate the flow {{characteristics of}} these four categories, the distribution of velocity vector, the evolutions of vortex shedding frequency in the wakes of two square cylinders, the formation lengths <b>behind</b> two <b>cylinders,</b> and the characteristics of the gap flow are all addressed in detail. 本研究係利用光纖雷射杜普勒測速儀(FLDV) 與質點影像測速儀(PIV) 等兩套精密且非接觸式之流場定量量測系統，並配合流場可視化之定性觀測方法，探討並列雙方柱尾流流場之特性。文中針對雷諾數Re(=U 0 ．H/v，其中U 0 為自由流流速，H為方柱邊，v為流體運動黏滯度) = 2500 ~ 8000 、淨間距比δ(=G/H，其中G為雙方柱淨間距) = 0 ~ 3. 0 條件，分析並列雙方柱尾流場與間隙流型態及特性上之變化。為了解其流場之細部特性，特以Re= 3500 條件下，經由全域速度場與其時序列訊號之對應關係，對流場形態的變化?入分析判斷，並對流場中瞬時與平均速度場分佈、上(下) 柱體後方迴流區長度、及渦流脫離頻率進行詳細探討。由實際結果顯示，在此雷諾數下，其流場特性存在著間距效應。即同一雷諾數條件下，隨著δ遞減存在四種同之流場型態，分別為(1) 間隙流呈穩定不偏向;間隙流朝雙柱間之中心軸向而不偏向上柱或下柱，且上(下) 柱尾流場有幾近同相位與異相位脫離現象。由平均速度場結果分析顯示，上下雙柱之尾流場相對於雙柱間之中心軸向係呈現上下幾近相互對稱之特性;(2) 間隙流呈不穩定搖擺;間隙流間歇性偏向上柱或下柱之搖擺事件乃為隨機發生，且隨著偏向的變化，於柱體後方所形成窄域或寬域尾流場亦隨之交互改變;(3) 間隙流呈穩定偏向;於雙柱後方分別形成窄域或寬域之尾流場，且間隙流固定偏向上柱與固定偏固下柱時的平均速度場經由鏡射比對後具有幾乎相互對稱之雙安定特性;(4) 間隙流呈不穩定搖擺但作用微弱;其尾流場可視為寬長比為幾近 2. 0 之矩柱尾流場。此外，若任雷諾數增加之情形下，此四種流場型態會在δ較小時發生...|$|R
40|$|Two {{different}} air-water interfacial flows are studied including plunging wave {{breaking and}} flow past a vertical surface-piercing circular cylinder using complementary CFDShip-Iowa version 6 including Cartesian grid solver and orthogonal curvilinear grid solver. The plunging wave-breaking process for impulsive flow over a bump {{in a shallow}} water flume has been simulated using the exact experimental initial and boundary conditions. The overall plunging wave breaking process is described with major wave breaking events identified: jet plunge, oblique splash and vertical jet. These major events repeat up to four times before entering the chaotic breaking. The simulations show a similar time line as the experiments consisting of startup, steep wave formation, plunging wave, and chaotic wave breaking swept downstream time phases. Detailed wave breaking processes, including wave profile at maximum height, first plunge, entrapped air bubble trajectories and diameters, kinetic, potential, and total energy, and bottom pressures are discussed along with the experimental results. The simulations show differences and similarities with other experimental and computational studies for wave breaking in deep water and sloping beaches. The geometry and conditions {{in the present study}} are relevant to ship hydrodynamics since it includes effects of wave-body interactions and wave breaking direction is opposite to the mean flow. Large-eddy simulation with the Lagrangian dynamic subgrid-scale model has been performed to study the flow past a surface-piercing circular cylinder for Re and Fr effect. The flow features near the air-water interface show significant changes with different Reynolds numbers from sub-critical to critical regime. It is shown that the interface makes the separation point more delayed for all regime of Re. Remarkably reduced separated region below the interface is observed for critical Re regime and it is responsible for much reduced wake and recirculation region <b>behind</b> the <b>cylinder</b> and it recovers in the deep flow. At different Fr, significant changes are shown on the air-water interface structures. At lower Fr, relatively smaller bow waves are observed in front of the cylinder with Kelvin waves <b>behind</b> the <b>cylinder</b> and small amount of free-surface roughness and turbulence are also seen in the wake region. For higher Fr, the bow wave increases remarkably with the larger wake region and deeper depression and it breaks with similar features of plunging breakers. Much more small air-water interface structures including splashes and bubbles are observed <b>behind</b> the <b>cylinder.</b> It is hard to distinguish the Kelvin waves <b>behind</b> the <b>cylinder</b> due to much larger free-surface oscillations and turbulence.

40|$|Fishes may exploit {{environmental}} vortices to save in {{the cost}} of locomotion. Previous work has investigated fish refuging <b>behind</b> a single <b>cylinder</b> in current, a behavior termed the K?rm?n gait. However, current-swept habitats often contain aggregations of physical objects, and it is unclear how the complex hydrodynamics shed from multiple structures affect refuging in fish. To begin to address this, we investigated how the flow fields produced by two D-shaped cylinders arranged in tandem affect the ability of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) to K?rm?n gait. We altered the spacing of the two cylinders from l/D of 0. 7 to 2. 7 (where l=downstream spacing of cylinders and D=cylinder diameter) and recorded the kinematics of trout swimming <b>behind</b> the <b>cylinders</b> with high-speed video at Re= 10, 000 ? 55, 000.
