40|$|Past {{studies in}} our {{laboratory}} {{have shown that}} silica (a-quartz) particle exposure of a mouse alveolar macrophage cell line (MH-S) elicits mitochondrial depolarization and caspase 3 and 9 activation, contributing to apoptosis. However, cellular pathways leading to these outcomes have not been extensively investigated. Initial stu-dies revealed that silica exposure elicits lysosomalpermeability after 1 h, as evidenced by leakage of FITC-conjugated dextran and acri-dine orange. We next evaluated a role for the lysosomal acidic com-partment in apoptosis. Cells pretreated with the lysosomotropic weak base ammonium chloride, to increase lysosomal pH, showed decreased caspase activation and apoptotic DNA fragmentation. MH-S cells pretreated with pepstatin A, an inhibitor of lysosomal cathepsin D, showed decreased caspase 9 and 3 activation {{as well as a}} decreased percentage of cells that became apoptotic. DNA frag-mentationandcaspase 9 and 3 activationwerealsodecreased in cells pretreatedwith despiramine, an inhibitor of lysosomal acidic sphin-gomyelinase. Silica pretreated with aluminum lactate (to <b>blunt</b> <b>surface</b> active sites) reduced caspase activation and apoptosis. Although aluminum lactate–treated silica still induced lysosomal permeability (by FITC–dextran leakage), one measure of lysosome integrity and function suggested a reduction in the extent and/or nature of lysosomal injury (by acridine orange retention). A role for reactive oxygen species (ROS) was investigated to explore another pathway for silica-induced apoptosis in addition to lysosomal enzymes; however, no role for ROS was apparent. Thus, following silica exposure, lysosomal injury precedes apoptosis, and the apop-totic signaling pathway includes cathepsin D and acidic sphingo-myelinase.

40|$|Various {{traumatic}} {{events such as}} automobile accidents, structure fires, or terrorist attacks result in traumatic and thermal injury. Fire is a destructive force that can alter or destroy evidence, and thermal alterations have negative effects on forensic and anthropological recovery and analysis. Blunt force trauma is particularly difficult to analyze because of the multiple ways in which this trauma appears on a body and the variety of objects that can impact and fracture a bone or the variety of ways a body can impact a <b>blunt</b> <b>surface.</b> As fire is a common way to cover up a crime and blunt force trauma {{is used as a}} means to kill or injure an individual, it is necessary to understand the differences between these two types of fractures that can present together on bone. The present study was performed to determine the amount of survivability of traumatic fracture patterns in remains that have been exposed to a burning event. The sample used for this investigation was composed of twenty limbs (forty long bones) from five full-grown, domestic, female sheep (Ovis aries) obtained from a farm in Connecticut. Thirty specimens were traumatized with the head of an Estwing ball peen hammer and ten were left as controls. After specimens were subjected to blunt force trauma, each was radiographed using Computed Tomography. They were then placed in a small structure, 8 ' x 8 ', that was constructed to simulate the conditions of a house fire. Each post-burn bone was analyzed based on a number of characteristics. A trauma score of " 1 " no trauma, " 2 " ambiguous, and " 3 " traumatic fractures were given based on these observations. CT scans were examined after bone samples had been analyzed. Again, each specimen's CT scan was given a trauma score (" 1 " no trauma, " 2 " ambiguous, and " 3 " traumatic fractures). Results from the bone analysis on the 30 traumatized and burned specimens revealed that 15 did not have trauma, 2 were ambiguous (i. e., they may have trauma but traumatic characteristics were not distinct), and 13 presented with distinguishable traumatic injury. Comminuted was the most prominent type of fracture, and the next most common fracture was oblique. The majority of traumatic injury was found on the middle portion of the bone. CT examination showed that 12 specimens had suffered traumatic injury. The two analyses were compared and showed an agreement of 83. 3 % between the trauma scores. Results show that differentiation of traumatic and thermally induced fractures is possible using various fracture characteristics as well as taphonomic indicators to determine the sequence of events...|$|E

In recent years, many studies were conducted to evaluate human safety during collisions with a robot.

For improving collision safety, these parameters may be varied reasonably.

In this thesis, the robot pose is optimized such that the effective robot mass is minimized while following a nominal trajectory. This is done by exploiting the robot’s redundant degrees of freedom.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a design study for a pressure based Flush airdata system (FADS) on the Hypersonic Air Launched Option (HALO) Vehicle. The analysis will demonstrate {{the feasibility of}} using a pressure based airdata system for the HALO and provide measurement uncertainty estimates along a candidate trajectory. The HALO is a conceived as a man-rated vehicle to be air launched from an SR- 71 platform and is proposed as a testbed for an airbreathing hydrogen scramjet. A feasibility study has been performed and indicates that the proposed trajectory is possible with minimal modifications to the existing SR 71 vehicle. The mission consists of launching the HALO {{off the top of}} an SR- 71 at Mach 3 and 80, 000 ft. A rocket motor is then used to accelerate the vehicle to the test condition. After the scramjet test is completed the vehicle will glide to a lakebed runway landing. This option provides reusability of the vehicle and scramjet engine. The HALO design will also allow for various scramjet engine and flowpath designs to be flight tested. For the HALO flights, measurements of freestream airdata are considered to be a mission critical to perform gain scheduling and trajectory optimization. One approach taken to obtaining airdata involves measurement of certain parameters such as external atmospheric winds, temperature, etc to estimate the airdata quantities. This study takes an alternate approach. Here the feasibility of obtaining airdata using a pressure-based flush airdata system (FADS) methods is assessed. The analysis, although it is performed using the HALO configuration and trajectory, is generally applicable to other hypersonic vehicles. The method to be presented offers the distinct advantage of inferring total pressure, Mach number, and flow incidence angles, without stagnating the freestream flow. This approach allows for airdata measurements to be made using <b>blunt</b> <b>surfaces</b> and significantly diminishes the heating load at the sensor. In the FADS concept a matrix of flush ports is placed {{in the vicinity of the}} aircraft nose, and the airdata are inferred indirectly from the measured pressures...|$|R

40|$|Presented are {{the results}} of {{numerical}} simulations of hypersonic flow about blunt cones and hemispherical nose configurations for reentry velocities of 7. 5 and 10 km/s. Cone half angles 0, 5, and 10 deg are considered at zero angle of incidence; however, the focus is for the 5 deg cone. The body size and altitude ranges considered (70 to 110 km) are such that the flow is in the transitional regime. Translational, thermodynamic, and chemical nonequilibrium effects are considered in the numerical simulation by utilizing the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method of Bird. The DSMC results are compared with those obtained with viscous shock-layer and Navier-Stokes methods. Comparisons between the DSMC and continuum calculations show the altitude range where differences in flowfield structure and surface quantities become significant.

40|$|The {{emerging}} {{and competitive}} {{environment in the}} space technology requires the improvements in the capability of aerodynamic vehicles. This leads to the analysis in drag reduction of the vehicle along with the minimized heat transfer rate. Using forward facing solid aerospike is the simplest way among the existing drag reduction methodologies for hypersonic blunt cone bodies. But the flow oscillations associated with this aerospike {{makes it difficult to}} implement. When analyzing this flow, it can be understood that this oscillating flow can be compared to conical cavity flow. Therefore in the spiked flows, it is decided to implement the technique used in reducing the flow oscillation of the cavities. Based on this method the shallow conical cavity flow generated by the aerospike fixed ahead of a 120 o blunt cone body is fissured as multiple cavities by so many disks formed from 10 o cone. Now the deep conical cavities had the length to mean depth ratio of unity; this suppresses the unnecessary oscillations of the shallow cavity. The total length of the telescopic aerospike is fixed as 100 mm. And one another conical tip plain aerospike of same length is designed for comparing the telescopic spike’s performance at hypersonic flow Mach numbers of 5. 75 and 7. 9. A three component force balance system capable of measuring drag, lift and pitching moment is designed and mounted internally into the skirt of the model. Drag measurement is done for without spike, conical tip plain spiked and telescopic spiked blunt cone body. The three configurations are tested at different angles of attack from 0 to 10 degree with a step of 2. A discrete iterative deconvolution methodology is implemented in this research work for obtaining the clean drag history from the noisy drag accelerometer signal. The drag results showed the drag reduction when compared to the without spike blunt cone body. When comparing to the plain spiked, the telescopic spiked blunt cone body has lesser drag at higher angles of attack. Heat transfer measurements are done over the <b>blunt</b> cone <b>surface</b> using the Platinum thin film gauges formed over the Macor substrate. These results and the flow visualization give better understanding of the flow and the heat flux rate caused by the flow. The enhancement in the heat flux rate over the <b>blunt</b> cone <b>surface</b> is due to the shock interaction. And in recirculation region the heat flux rate is very much lesser when compared to without spike blunt cone body. It is observed that the shock interaction in the windward side is coming closer towards the nose of the blunt cone as the angle of attack increases and the oscillation of the oblique shock also decreases. Schlieren visualization showed that there is dispersion in the oblique shock, particularly in the leeward side. In the telescopic spike there are multiple shocks generated from each and every disk which coalesces together to form a single oblique shock. And the effect of the shock generated by the telescopic spike is stronger than the effect of the shock generated by the conical tip plain spike...|$|R

First, we newly developed an experimental setup for fatigue crack propagation experiments of the freestanding Cu films inside a vacuum chamber of a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM). Fatigue crack propagation experiments were conducted in ambient air and vacuum environment of the FESEM chamber (˜ 10 - 4 Pa) under load-control conditions with constant maximum stress and at a stress ratio R of 0. 1. In situ FESEM observations of fatigue crack propagation confirmed that preceding intrusions/extrusions were formed ahead of the fatigue crack tip, and the fatigue crack then propagated preferentially through these intrusions/extrusions in the lower stress intensity factor range (ΔK). In the higher ΔK, the fatigue crack propagated in tensile fracture mode. These mechanisms of fatigue crack propagation {{were similar to those}} in air. The relationships between fatigue crack propagation rate (da/dN) and stress intensity factor range (ΔK) in both environments were roughly within a narrow band in the region of ΔK ≳ 4 — 5 MPam 1 / 2. On the other hand, da/dN in vacuum became smaller than that in air in the region of ΔK ≲ 4 — 5 MPam 1 / 2.

40|$|Heparin-induced {{endothelial cell}} cytoskeletal reorganization: A {{potential}} mechanism for vascular relaxation. We have previously shown that heparin given subcutaneously {{on a daily}} basis lowers blood pressure in hypertensive rat models, and that this blood pressure lowering effect is endothelium-dependent. The present study describes the effects of heparin on endothelial cell (EC) apical surface structures and cytoskeletal elements, namely, actin and vimentin as well as EC proliferative activity. The EC line (CRL 1998) was cultured, treated with different concentrations of heparin (0, 50, 100, 500 U/ml) for 4, 24 or 48 hours, and fixed for scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and immunofluorescence microscopy (IFM) studies. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and flow cytometric analysis were performed on EC monolayers treated with different concentrations of heparin for quantitative detection of actin and vimentin. By SEM study the cell surface showed generalized smoothing as a result of <b>blunting</b> of <b>surface</b> microvilli with increasing time of exposure and dosage of heparin. By IFM study, the detectable actin signal within ECs became progressively reduced in both its cellular distribution and the apparent number of cells that remained reactive. By 48 hr/ 500 U heparin, the actin signal was almost undetectable. Vimentin showed a moderate reduction in the cellular distribution of labeling. Quantitatively, actin was significantly reduced after the 24 hour treatment with a higher dose of heparin (500 U/ml), from a baseline optical density (OD) of 1. 12 ± 0. 060 to 0. 866 ± 0. 008 (P < 0. 0027). After 48 hours of treatment at both 100 U/ml and 500 Usol;ml heparin, actin was significantly reduced from a baseline OD of 1. 347 ± 0. 063 to 1. 090 ± 0. 039 (P < 0. 0039) and 0. 844 ± 0. 074 (P < 0. 008), respectively. However, vimentin was significantly reduced only after 48 hours of treatment with a high dose of heparin (500 U/ml), from baseline OD 1. 82 ± 0. 052 to 1. 41 ± 0. 004 (P < 0. 002). The flow cytometric findings were virtually identical to the ELISA data for actin and vimentin. These qualitative and quantitative changes in actin and vimentin are consistent with apparent smoothing and relaxation of the EC's apical surface. Labeling with the cell cycle marker MIB- 1 (monoclonal antibody Ki- 67), showed a progressive reduction in the observed intensity in heparin treated cells with substantially fewer cells being positive. After a 48 hour treatment with heparin (500 U/ml), most ECs displayed only dim labeling of the nucleolus. This finding is consistent with an antiproliferative effect. Overall, these findings are additive to our previous observations, and demonstrate that heparin causes EC cytoskeletal reorganization which is a potential mechanism for vascular relaxation...|$|R

The standard deviation of the pressure signals showed initial peaked distribution, with the maximum standard deviation point corresponding to the location of the separation line at Mach number 3. 0 to 5. 0. At Mach 2. 0 the maximum standard deviation point was found to occur significantly upstream of the separation line. The intermittency distributions of the separation shock wave motion were found to be self-similar profiles for all Mach numbers. The intermittent region length was found to increase with Mach number and decrease with interaction sweepback angle. For Mach numbers 3. 0 to 5. 0 the separation line was found to correspond to high intermittencies or equivalently to the downstream locus of the separation shock wave motion. The Mach 2. 0 tests, however, showed that the intermittent region occurs significantly upstream of the separation line. Power spectral densities measured in the intermittent regions were found to have self-similar frequency distributions when compared as functions of a Strouhal number for all Mach numbers and interaction sweepback angles. The maximum zero-crossing frequencies were found to correspond with the peak frequencies in the power spectra measured in the intermittent region...|$|R
