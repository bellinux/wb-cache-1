40|$|Abstract. Local {{variations}} in boundary shear stress acting on bed-surface particles control patterns of bed load transport and channel evolution during varying stream discharges. At the reach scale a channel adjusts to imposed {{water and sediment}} supply through mutual interactions among channel form, local grain size, and local flow dynamics that govern <b>bed</b> <b>mobility.</b> In order to explore these adjustments, we used a numerical flow model to examine relations between model-predicted local boundary shear stress (� j) and measured surface particle size (D 50) at bank-full discharge in six gravel-bed, alternate-bar channels with widely differing annual sediment yields. Values of �j and D 50 were poorly correlated such that small areas conveyed large proportions of the total bed load, especially in sediment-poor channels with low mobility. Sediment-rich channels had greater areas of full mobility; sediment-poor channels had greater areas of partial mobility; and both types had significant areas that were essentially immobile. Two reachmean mobility parameters (Shields stress and Q*) correlated reasonably well with sediment supply. Values which can be practicably obtained from carefully measured mean hydraulic variables and particle size would provide first-order assessments of <b>bed</b> <b>mobility</b> that would broadly distinguish the channels in this study according to their sediment yield and <b>bed</b> <b>mobility.</b> 1...|$|E

40|$|The {{proposed}} {{distinction between}} meandering and braided river channel patterns, {{on the basis}} of bankfull specific stream Žpower and bed material size, is analysed and rejected. Only by using regime-based estimates of channel widths rather than. actual widths has discrimination been achieved, and it is argued that this procedure is unacceptable. An alternative is to explore the patterning processes underlying the marked pattern scatter on bankfull stream powerrbed material size plots. Of the five sets of patterning processes, large-scale bedform development and stability is seen as especially important for meandering and braiding. For graÕel-bed riÕers, bedforms developed at around or above bankfull stage appear important for pattern generation, with braiding relating to higher excess shear stress and Froude number. There seems to be an upper threshold to both meandering and braiding which is achieved at extreme discharges and steep gradients, as on steep alluvial fans, rather than for the rivers with available flow data here considered. For sand-bed riÕers with greater excess shear stress, the equivalent upper plane bed threshold may occur below bankfull, with <b>bed</b> material <b>mobility</b> and bedform modification occurring over a wider range of sub-bankfull discharges. Sand-bed channel margin outlines appear to be less perturbed by bedform effects than gravel bed planforms, and they may have naturally straight or sinuous planforms.

40|$|Objective: Symptomatic {{pulmonary}} embolism (PE) {{has been associated}} with high morbidity and mortality. However, data on the clinical impact of AsPE on patients with known deep vein thrombosis (DVT) are limited in literature. Methods: Patients treated in our institution for symptomatic DVT without any symptoms or signs of PE were prospectively included in this study. The diagnosis of DVT was verified using colored Duplex ultrasonography based on international guidelines. All patients underwent a thorax-computed angiography in order to detect cases with AsPE. Basic characteris- tics of all patients and major outcomes were compared between patients with DVT and no PE and patients with DVT plus AsPE. Mean follow-up was 3 +/- 0. 32 years. Results: AsPE was detected overall in 39 patients (32 %). The majority (37 %) of patients reported long-lasting <b>bed</b> rest/im- <b>mobility,</b> 15 % had a neoplasia, although 32 % of patients did not have any typical DVT risk factor. There was no difference regarding age, gender, location of thrombosis or typical risk factors. Basic serum parameters did not differ between the two groups, either. However, more patients with PE showed d-dimer values of < 5 mg/l compared to patients with DVT only (p= 0. 017). Deaths from all causes and total days of initial hospitalization did not differ between the two groups. However, AsPE was found to be a risk factor both for new symptomatic PE (RR = 5. 675, CI 95 % [1. 592 and ndash; 20. 233], p = 0. 0074) as well as readmission to hospital (RR = 2. 736, CI 95 % [1. 523 and ndash; 4. 915], p = 0. 0008). Conclusions: AsPE occurs frequently in patients with symptomatic DVT, although neither typical risk factors nor the lo- cation of DVT seem to be associated with its presence.

40|$|Hyporheic flow {{in streams}} has {{typically}} been studied separately from geomorphic processes. We investigated interactions between <b>bed</b> <b>mobility</b> and dynamic hyporheic storage of solutes and fine particles in a sand-bed stream before, during, {{and after a}} flood. A conservatively transported solute tracer (bromide) and a fine particles tracer (5 μm latex particles), a surrogate for fine particulate organic matter, were co-injected during base flow. The tracers were differentially stored, with fine particles penetrating more shallowly in hyporheic flow and retained more efficiently due to {{the high rate of}} particle filtration in bed sediment compared to solute. Tracer injections lasted 3. 5 h after which we released a small flood from an upstream dam one hour later. Due to shallower storage in the bed, fine particles were rapidly entrained during the rising limb of the flood hydrograph. Rather than being flushed by the flood, we observed that solutes were stored longer due to expansion of hyporheic flow paths beneath the temporarily enlarged bedforms. Three important timescales determined the fate of solutes and fine particles: (1) flood duration, (2) relaxation time of flood-enlarged bedforms back to base flow dimensions, and (3) resulting adjustments and lag times of hyporheic flow. Recurrent transitions between these timescales explain why we observed a peak accumulation of natural particulate organic matter between 2 and 4 cm deep in the bed, i. e., below the scour layer of mobile bedforms but above the maximum depth of particle filtration in hyporheic flow paths. Thus, physical interactions between <b>bed</b> <b>mobility</b> and hyporheic transport influence how organic matter is stored in the bed and how long it is retained, which affects decomposition rate and metabolism of this southeastern Coastal Plain stream. In summary we found that dynamic interactions between hyporheic flow, <b>bed</b> <b>mobility,</b> and flow variation had strong but differential influences on base flow retention and flood mobilization of solutes and fine particulates.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new technique}} to compute open boundary conditions for fully-coupled hydro-morphodynamical numerical solvers based on the Non-Linear Shallow Water and the Exner equations. These conditions allow the generation of incident signals and the absorption of reflected ones, {{taking into account the}} bed evolution at the boundary. They use the approximations for linear waves in shallow water and are based on the solution of the Riemann Equations. The proposed technique is implemented in the fully-coupled hydro-morphodynamical numerical model of Briganti et al. (2012 a). Firstly, the generation and absorption of single monochromatic waves are studied to quantify the error after the reflected wave exited the domain. In all cases the error is always small, giving evidence of the effectiveness of the new seaward boundary conditions. Furthermore, the propagation and reflection of a monochromatic wave train over a mobile bed are considered. Both flow evolution and bed change are not affected by spurious oscillations when long sequences of waves are tested. Additionally, a very low <b>mobility</b> <b>bed</b> is considered to simulate a ‘virtually fixed’ bed and new boundary condition results consistently converge to those for the hydrodynamic only case. Finally, the reflection of a uniform bore over a mobile bed is studied. For this case the Rankine–Hugoniot conditions provide an analytical solution. It is apparent that the adopted linear approximations produce errors in the velocity estimates. Nevertheless, the conditions perform reasonably well even in this demanding non-linear case...|$|R

40|$|Understanding {{causes of}} dune irregularity, {{especially}} dune trough scour, {{is important for}} the modeling of vertical sorting of sediment mixtures in morphological models of rivers with sediment mixtures. Sediment in dunes is generally sorted in a fining-upward manner, which affects the sediment transport composition depending on the scour depth distribution of the dunes. Why dunes become more irregular and develop deep scour holes in some conditions is only partially understood. Moreover, there is a feedback between vertical sorting and dune irregularity. In gravelly sands, erosion-resistant coarse layers may form that decrease or inhibit dune trough scour. The causes of dune irregularity and the feedback by coarse sediment layers are explored in experiments and are demonstrated to be related partly to the upstream sediment boundary condition determined by the experimental setup: sediment feeding or recirculating. Sediment recirculation flumes promote fining of the transported sediment and formation of a less or immobile gravel lag layer in the dune troughs. Sediment feed flumes may force the transported sediment at the flume entry to be equal to the <b>bed</b> sediment (equal <b>mobility</b> condition) and hence allow no lag layer formation. Experiments show that the dune trough scour in recirculation is less deep than in feed flumes, and the vertical sorting and transport sediment composition are different. The experiments also indicate that dune irregularity in feed flumes is related to dimensionless shear stress similarly as in uniform sediments. Interpretation of experiments of dune dynamics in sediment mixtures should therefore account for differences in the upstream sediment supply condition. More in general, it is hypothesized that the upstream sediment supply condition (resembling either recirculation or feed flumes) in rivers may affect dune and vertical sorting dynamic...|$|R

Focusing on one aspect of transferring, rising from supine to sitting position, we devised a set of <b>bed</b> <b>mobility</b> tasks to test key arm, leg, and trunk movements that likely contribute to successful rising from bed. Healthy young controls (YC, n= 22, mean age 23), and older adults (aged 60 and over) either resid-ing independently in congregate housing (CH, n= 29, mean age 84) or undergoing rehabilitation in a skilled nursing facility (SNF, mean age 77) were assessed in the time to rise from supine to sitting and in the ability or inability to perform 16 other <b>bed</b> <b>mobility</b> tasks. Trunk function-related tasks, specifi-cally those requiring trunk elevation and trunk balance, were most difficult for the SNF, followed by CH, and then YC. Tasks focusing on trunk flexion strength (sit up arms crossed, bilater-al heel raise) and lateral trunk strength/balance were the most difficult for both SNF and CH, although there was minimal dif-ference in the percent unable to complete each task. The major CH-SNF differences occurred in trunk elevation tasks where the upper limb was important in facilitating trunk elevation (sit This material is based upon work supported by the Office of Research an...|$|E

40|$|Background/purpose – Stroke is {{a leading}} cause of death in the United States. About 795, 000 people have a stroke each year in the United States. Functional Electrical Stimulation cycling is a method of using {{electrical}} stimulation therapy while cycling on a stationary cycle to improve motor and sensory pathways to improve functional outcomes. The case study quantitatively evaluates the extent that the use of FES cycling may improve functional outcomes in stroke patients with hemiplegia or hemiparesis. Case Description – A 53 -year-old male who was initially admitted to a local hospital with a chief complaint of severe headache, left facial weakness, left-sided hemiweakness and slurred speech after hitting his head from a fall in his home. His exam was significant for NIH stroke scale of 16, initial blood pressure of 193 / 117 mm Hg, and a diagnostic CT positive for stroke. The patient was transferred for a neurosurgery consult to a 2 nd local hospital. Imaging showed a large ischemic hemispheric stroke in the perfusion territory of the right middle cerebral artery affecting the basal ganglia, frontal, parietal, temporal lobe. Outcomes and Discussion – At the time of discharge the patient remained a fall risk with a Berg Balance score of 5 / 56, was impulsive, and had decreased safety awareness and decreased cognition. He still needed moderate assistance with <b>bed</b> <b>mobility,</b> transfers, sit to stand task and ambulation. The patient did not meet any of his long-term goals including <b>bed</b> <b>mobility,</b> transfers, gait ambulation or wheel chair ambulation...|$|E
40|$|Mobile bed scaling (for scales {{smaller than}} 1 : 1) {{does not allow}} for ideal {{similarity}} between all nondimensional parameters. This leads to an exaggerated presence of one process over another or the development of scale effects. The complexity of the surf zone makes it especially difficult to separate and quantify the effect of sediment scaling on each individual process. As a result, the impact of sediment scaling on the holistic morphodynamic process is poorly understood. Profiles were obtained at TU Delft (scale 1 : 10) following the testing regime used during the SANDS project. This set made use of density and diameter scaled sediment (?s = 1200 kg/m 3 and d 50 = 0. 52 mm); scaled according to the bed load model of Henriquez, Reniers et al. (2008). The set used for analysis here includes the Hannover (prototype scale 1 : 1) and Deltares (Froude scale 1 : 6) profiles obtained during SANDS. The present work looks to extend what is currently known about the impact of sediment scaling on nearshore transport processes. Three main objectives are identified: 1) Showing profile development and inferred transport rates, compare nondimensional parameters across the nearshore and surf zone; 2) Identify how spatial variance of dominate hydrodynamic and sediment transport regimes across the surf zone are influenced by the subsequent scaling; 3) Explain morphological differences due to scaling by observing the small scale transport process. Analysis of the profiles showed a marked degree of geometrical similarity between all three facilities. More specifically, the development of a bar-trough system and subsequent offshore migration. The transport rates were, however, divergent. Compared to Hannover, the transport rates at Deltares were low where conversely TU Delft was high. Using ideal scaling theories as a basis, the cross shore distribution of the nondimensional parameters at TU Delft suggested that both sediment <b>mobility</b> and near <b>bed</b> suspension were similar with prototype. However, due to a large fall velocity, the Dean number was underestimated. From the use of Froude scaling at Deltares, the nondimensional parameters suggested that neither near bed nor suspended load transport regimes were reproduced correctly. This can mostly be attributed to the rippled bed state and reduced Shields value. A simple depth and time averaged model was also used to decompose the sediment concentrations. These concentrations were used to check consistency of the nondimensional parameter agreement with the manifestation of the physical process. Inconsistent with the nondimensional results, TU Delft showed that near <b>bed</b> sediment <b>mobility</b> and suspension was high. It is believed this led to the exaggerated sediment fluxes. Concentrations at Deltares suggest the rippled bed introduced a thinned boundary layer which caused decreased sediment mobility and the decreased sediment fluxes.

40|$|International audienceImmobility in <b>bed</b> and {{decreased}} <b>mobility</b> cause adaptations to most human body systems. The effect of immobility on fat accumulation in hemopoietic bone marrow {{has never been}} measured prospectively. The reversibility of marrow fat accumulation and the effects on hemopoiesis are not known. In the present study, 24 healthy women (age: 25 - 40 yr) underwent - 6 degrees head-down bed rest for 60 days. We used MRI to noninvasively measure the lumbar vertebral fat fraction at various time points. We also measured hemoglobin, erythropoietin, reticulocytes, leukocytes, platelet count, peripheral fat mass, leptin, cortisol, and C-reactive protein during bed rest and for 1 yr after bed rest ended. Compared with baseline, the mean (+/-SE) fat fraction was increased after 60 days of bed rest (+ 2. 5 +/- 1. 1 %, P< 0. 05); the increase persisted 1 yr after the resumption of regular activities (+ 2. 3 +/- 0. 8 %, P< 0. 05). Mean hemoglobin levels were significantly decreased 6 days after bed rest ended (- 1. 36 +/- 0. 20 g/dl, P< 0. 05) but had recovered at 1 yr, with significantly lower mean circulating erythropoietin levels (- 3. 8 +/- 1. 2 mU/ml, P< 0. 05). Mean numbers of neutrophils and lymphocytes remained significantly elevated at 1 yr (+ 617 +/- 218 neutrophils/microl and + 498 +/- 112 lymphocytes/microl, both P< 0. 05). These results constitute direct evidence that bed rest irreversibly accelerated fat accumulation in hemopoietic bone marrow. The 2. 5 % increase in fat fraction after 60 days of bed rest was 25 -fold larger than expected from historical ambulatory controls. Sixty days of bed rest accelerated by 4 yr the normal bone marrow involution. Bed rest and marrow adiposity were associated with hemopoietic stimulation. One year after subjects returned to normal activities, hemoglobin levels were maintained, with 43 % lower circulating erythropoietin levels, and leukocytes remained significantly elevated across lineages. Lack of mobility alters hemopoiesis, possibly through marrow fat accumulation, with potentially wide-ranging clinical consequences...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Extended-duration low-molecular-weight heparin {{has been}} shown to prevent venous {{thromboembolism}} (VTE) in high-risk surgical patients. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of extended-duration enoxaparin thromboprophylaxis in acutely ill medical patients. DESIGN: Randomized, parallel, placebo-controlled trial. Randomization was computer-generated. Allocation was centralized. Patients, caregivers, and outcome assessors were blinded to group assignment. (ClinicalTrials. gov registration number: NCT 00077753) SETTING: 370 sites in 20 countries across North and South America, Europe, and Asia. PATIENTS: Acutely ill medical patients 40 years or older with recently reduced <b>mobility</b> (<b>bed</b> rest or sedentary without [level 1] or with [level 2] bathroom privileges). Eligibility criteria for patients with level 2 immobility were amended to include only those who had additional VTE risk factors (age > 75 years, history of VTE, or active or previous cancer) after interim analyses suggested lower-than-expected VTE rates. INTERVENTION: Enoxaparin, 40 mg/d subcutaneously (2975 patients), or placebo (2988 patients), for 28 +/- 4 days after receiving open-label enoxaparin for an initial 10 +/- 4 days. MEASUREMENTS: Incidence of VTE up to day 28 and of major bleeding events up to 48 hours after the last study treatment dose. RESULTs: Extended-duration enoxaparin reduced VTE incidence compared with placebo (2. 5 % vs. 4 %; absolute risk difference favoring enoxaparin, - 1. 53 % [95. 8 % CI, - 2. 54 % to - 0. 52 %]). Enoxaparin increased major bleeding events (0. 8 % vs. 0. 3 %; absolute risk difference favoring placebo, 0. 51 % [95 % CI, 0. 12 % to 0. 89 %]). The benefits of extended-duration enoxaparin seemed to be restricted to women, patients older than 75 years, and those with level 1 immobility. LIMITATION: Estimates of efficacy and safety for the overall trial population are difficult to interpret because of the change in eligibility criteria during the trial. CONCLUSION: Use of extended-duration enoxaparin reduces VTE more than it increases major bleeding events in acutely ill medical patients with level 1 immobility, those older than 75 years, and women.
