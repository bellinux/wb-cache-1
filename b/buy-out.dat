40|$|In the mid- 1980 s, many UK {{venture capitalists}} {{developed}} investments in management buy-ins {{as an extension}} of their successful interest in the related area of management <b>buy-outs.</b> This paper presents the results of the first survey of the performance effects of a representative sample of 59 management buy-ins. The study reveals substantial restructuring following management buy-ins and also indicates that the performance levels after the buy-in are likely not to meet those originally intended. Extensive changes in product portfolios are reported. Management changes appear to be highly significant. Performance seems to be below that found in studies of management <b>buy-outs</b> and the extent of changes occurring appears to be considerably greater than in <b>buy-outs.</b> There seems in general to have been an underestimation of the extent of likely problems at the time the investment was being appraised, as indicated by the importance of "skeleton in the cupboard" type problems which subsequently emerged.

With the recent degradation of the UK economy, we can rightly assume that these types of highly leverage transactions have been enduring issues to service their substantial debt.

Following the approaches of recent papers on Leveraged <b>buy-outs,</b> we compare the adjusted performance of this specific form of leveraged <b>buy-outs</b> to the performance of similar transactions conducted in the early 2000 s and the performance of comparable public companies.

5|$|After {{a disappointing}} 2007–08 season, Senators' {{management}} promised change, {{and in the}} off-season fulfilled that promise with changes both in coaching and on-ice personnel. On June 13, 2008, the Senators named Craig Hartsburg, who had been {{head coach of the}} OHL's Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds, as the new head coach, signing him to a three-year contract. The Senators also named Curtis Hunt, formerly of the Regina Pats, as assistant coach. On the player side, the first change was the <b>buy-out</b> of troubled goaltender Ray Emery's contract following a difficult season. Long-time Senator Wade Redden left via free-agency, and 2007–08 trade acquisitions Mike Commodore, Cory Stillman and Martin Lapointe were not re-signed. Brian McGrattan and Andrej Meszaros were traded, Meszaros following a contract dispute. From the free agent market, the Senators signed goaltender Alex Auld, defenceman Jason Smith, and agitating forward Jarkko Ruutu. In exchange for Meszaros, defencemen Filip Kuba, Alexandre Picard and a 2009 first-round draft pick (later dealt for defenceman Chris Campoli) were acquired from the Tampa Bay Lightning.|$|E
5|$|After the hot start, a {{prolonged}} slump through January and February occurred {{during which the}} Senators won only seven of 21 games, and Murray fired Head Coach Paddock and Assistant Coach Ron Low on February 27, 2008, taking over the coaching duties himself. After the coaching switch, team performance improved but did not match {{the performance of the}} beginning of the season. A playoff spot was in doubt until the Senators' last game of the season, a loss to Boston, but the team qualified due to the Carolina Hurricanes losing. After all other games were played, the team ended up as the seventh seed and faced the Pittsburgh Penguins in the opening round, a repeat of the 2007 Eastern Conference Quarterfinals. The Senators lost the series four games to none, the third time they were swept in a first-round series. The result, after going to the Finals the previous season, led to speculation by the media that the team would make a large change in personnel before next season, including the <b>buy-out</b> of Ray Emery and the Senators not re-signing their free agents.|$|E
40|$|This paper adds {{to growing}} {{interest}} in public to private <b>buy-outs</b> and mechanisms to ensure bid success. Using a unique, hand-collected dataset of 155 public to private <b>buy-outs</b> we provide {{one of the first}} examinations of the determinants of irrevocable commitments. Irrevocable commitments involve undertakings given by existing shareholders to agree to sell their shares to the bidder before the bid to take the company private is announced. We find that, for management <b>buy-outs,</b> the level of irrevocable commitments is increased by the bid premium, the reputation of the private equity backer and board shareholdings. The level of irrevocable commitments is reduced by rumours of a takeover bid and bid value. We therefore find evidence that management and private equity firms' activity prior to the bid's announcement can have an important impact on the process of going private.

40|$|From the mid- 1980 s many UK venture capitalists, as an {{extension}} to their involvement in management <b>buy-outs,</b> made investments in management buy-ins where they backed new managers to purchase equity stakes in an existing company. This Thesis analyses the corporate restructuring and entrepreneurial influences behind buy-ins taking note of turnaround and venture capital influences. It draws on general buy-in characteristics from a database of 750 management buy-ins {{and the results of}} a representative questionnaire survey of 59 management buy-ins (mailed in February 1990) and backed by individual case studies. It is hypothesised that management buy-ins are a distinctive corporate restructuring form and have major differences with management <b>buy-outs.</b> Buy-ins are shown to be significantly different from <b>buy-outs</b> in terms of source, activity and realisation; {{they are more likely to}} be bought from a private source and to end up in receivership. Financing structures are more conservative but not on a statistically significant basis. Buy-in teams are smaller than in <b>buy-outs,</b> frequently have initial skills gaps, and in a minority of cases are led by second time entrepreneurs. The target company is normally identified through informal networks. Buy-ins are followed by a significantly higher degree of action in financial, product and marketing areas than <b>Buy-outs</b> and other restructuring processes such as turnarounds. Compared to US LBOs more attention is paid to working asset management with little unbundling of fixed assets and higher capital expenditure. Team Leaders are shown to be mainly opportunist in terms of entrepreneurial typology with a minority craftsmen and, unexpectedly, a few mainly motivated by push factors. This is in contrast to <b>buy-outs</b> where a typology is developed showing a preponderance of craftsmen. Overall performance after buy-in was below original Business Plan but heavily influenced by adverse economic and financial conditions. Different types of Team Leaders were not associated with significant differences in performance although opportunists were more likely to be acquisitive. Contrary to the principles of corporate restructuring, discriminant analysis showed equity ratchets and higher rates of leverage being negative influences on profitability. Case studies showed ineffective monitoring and control by some venture capitalists. Buy-ins of privately owned companies where there are particular problems of information assymetery and those bought in the late 1980 s where unrealistically high prices may have been paid for the target company were poor performers. Among entrepreneur related variables, the team's knowledge of each other was an important positive influence but education was negative...|$|R
