They are invisible during occultations because they have negligible optical depth, though they are bright in forward-scattered light. Voyager 2s images of forward-scattered light revealed the existence of bright dust bands between the λ and δ rings, between the η and β rings, and between the α ring and ring 4. Many of these bands were detected again in 2003–2004 by the Keck Telescope and during the 2007 ring-plane crossing event in <b>backscattered</b> light, but their precise locations and relative brightnesses were different from during the Voyager observations. The normal optical depth of the dust bands is about 10−5 or less. The dust particle size distribution is thought to obey a power law with the index p=2.5±0.5.|$|E

An opposite conclusion of absent <b>backscattering</b> was reached in a recent work [H. -Y. Xie et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 116, 086603 (2016) ] for the "local" model of the <b>backscattering</b> field and interactions. Motivated to resolve this potential controversy, in the present work, we study <b>backscattering</b> effects employing fermionic perturbation theory and considering quite general forms of the <b>backscattering</b> field and electron interactions. We discover that <b>backscattering</b> effects are crucially sensitive to the locality properties of the <b>backscattering</b> field and electron interactions, to the symmetry of the latter, {{as well as to the}} presence or absence of the cutoff of the electron spectrum. We find that <b>backscattering</b> is indeed absent under the following assumptions: (i) local <b>backscattering</b> field; (ii. a) local or (ii. b) SU(2) -symmetric interactions; (iii) absent cutoff of the edge-state spectrum. However, violation of any of these conditions leads to <b>backscattering.</b> This also reconciles with the results based on the bosonization technique. We calculate the associated <b>backscattering</b> current, establish its low-bias scaling behavior, and predict a crossover between two different scaling regimes. The main implication of our findings is that <b>backscattering</b> of some magnitude is inevitable in a real system, although could be quite suppressed for nearly local <b>backscattering</b> field and interactions.

Background. Myocardial integrated ultrasound <b>backscatter</b> changes in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; however, it is unknown whether ultrasound myocardial tissue characterization may be useful in differentiating hypertrophic cardiomyopathy from hypertensive hypertrophy. Methods. Calibrated myocardial integrated <b>backscatter</b> and its transmural gradient were measured in the septum and posterior wall in 31 normal subjects, 13 patients with hypertensive hypertrophy and 22 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The gradient in integrated <b>backscatter</b> was determined as the ratio of calibrated integrated <b>backscatter</b> in the endocardial half to that in the epicardial half of the myocardium. Results. Cyclic variation of integrated <b>backscatter</b> was smaller and calibrated myocardial integrated <b>backscatter</b> higher in patients with hypertrophied hearts than in normal subjects, but {{there were no significant differences}} in either integrated <b>backscatter</b> measure between patients with hypertensive hypertrophy and those with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

Processing of the angular <b>backscatter</b> data using the 'NRGCOR' software was made for 29 locations comprising different geological provinces like: carbonate mounds, buried mounds, seafloor channels, and inter-channel areas. A detailed methodology is developed to produce a map of angle-invariant (normalized) <b>backscatter</b> data by correcting the local angular <b>backscatter</b> values. The present paper involves detailed processing steps and related technical aspects of the normalization approach. The presented angle-invariant <b>backscatter</b> map possesses 12 dB dynamic range in terms of grey scale. A clear distinction is seen between the mound dominated northern area (Belgica province) and the Gollum channel seafloor {{at the southern end}} of the site. Qualitative analyses of the calculated mean <b>backscatter</b> values i. e., grey scale levels, utilizing angle-invariant <b>backscatter</b> data generally indicate <b>backscatter</b> values are highest (lighter grey scale) in the mound areas followed by buried mounds. The <b>backscatter</b> values are lowest in the inter-channel areas (lowest grey scale level). Moderate <b>backscatter</b> values (medium grey level) are observed from the Gollum and Kings channel data, and significant variability within the channel seafloor provinces. The segmentation of the channel seafloor provinces are made based on the computed grey scale levels for further analyses based on the angular <b>backscatter</b> strength.

The presence of a hail spike in the reflectivity pattern is an important clue. It is an area of weak reflectivity extending away from the radar immediately behind a thunderstorm with hail. It is caused by radiation from the radar bouncing from hailstone to hailstone or the ground before being reflected back to the radar. The time delay between the <b>backscattered</b> radiation from the storm and the one with multiple paths causes the reflectivity from the hail to appear to come from a farther range than the actual storm.

Low-voltage SEM is typically conducted in an FEG-SEM because field emission guns (FEG) are capable of producing high primary electron brightness and small spot size even at low accelerating potentials.

40|$|Graduation date: 2009 The {{inherent}} {{and apparent}} optical properties of different ocean regimes {{are the basis}} for all optical remote sensing of the ocean. Ecological information derived from remote sensors therefore relies on having a detailed understanding of how particulate <b>backscattering</b> and absorption contribute to the bulk optical signal. The absorption characteristics of oceanic particles, e. g. phytoplankton and marine bacteria, organic detritus, and minerogenic particles, have been well characterized, {{and there are several}} ways to determine their contribution to bulk signals. In contrast, the <b>backscattering</b> properties of marine particles are not well understood, and indeed there is still some uncertainty regarding the dominant sources of <b>backscattering</b> in the ocean. Recent advances in optical instrumentation now permit laboratory and in situ examination of the spectral <b>backscattering</b> properties of marine particles, and we use these new tools to improve the characterization of <b>backscattering</b> in the ocean. We first investigated the ratio of <b>backscattering</b> to total scattering across a wide range of oceanic environments and particle types. The spectral dependency of the particulate <b>backscattering</b> ratio (backscattering/scattering in all directions) is relevant in the fields of ocean color inversion, light field modeling, and inferring particle properties from optical measurements. Aside from theoretical predictions for spherical, homogeneous particles, we have had very limited data showing the actual in situ spectral variability of the particulate <b>backscattering</b> ratio. Our analysis of five data sets from different ocean regimes revealed no spectral dependence of the particulate <b>backscattering</b> ratio within our measurement certainty. We did find however, that different particle populations demonstrated qualitative differences in the <b>backscattering</b> ratio. In an effort to better understand the variability that we observed in in situ <b>backscattering,</b> we investigated the spectral <b>backscattering</b> properties of thirteen species of marine phytoplankton using laboratory cultures. Theoretical analysis has shown that the <b>backscattering</b> coefficient and <b>backscattering</b> ratio may be influenced by particle size, shape, composition, and internal structure.
