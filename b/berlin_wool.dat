25|$|Unlike woven carpets, {{embroidery}} carpets' are not {{formed on}} a loom. Their pattern is {{established by the}} application of stitches to a cloth (often linen) base. The tent stitch and the cross stitch {{are two of the}} most common. Embroidered carpets were traditionally made by royal and aristocratic women in the home, but there has been some commercial manufacture since steel needles were introduced (earlier needles were made of bone) and linen weaving improved in the 16th century. Mary, Queen of Scots, is known to have been an avid embroiderer. 16th century designs usually involve scrolling vines and regional flowers (for example, the Bradford carpet). They often incorporate animal heraldry and the coat of arms of the maker. Production continued through the 19th century. Victorian embroidered carpet compositions include highly illusionistic, 3-dimensional flowers. Patterns for tiled carpets made of a number of squares, called <b>Berlin</b> <b>wool</b> work, were introduced in Germany in 1804, and became extremely popular in England in the 1830s. Embroidered carpets can also include other features such as a pattern of shapes, or they can even tell a story.|$|E
500|$|Canvaswork, {{in which}} thread is {{stitched}} through a foundation fabric, and surface embroidery, {{in which the}} majority of the thread sits on top of the fabric, exist side-by-side in the English tradition, coming in and out of fashion over the years. [...] In the 19th century, the craze for <b>Berlin</b> <b>wool</b> work, a canvaswork style using brightly coloured wool, contrasts with art needlework, associated with the Arts and Crafts Movement, which attempted to resurrect the artistic and expressive styles of medieval surface embroidery {{under the influence of the}} Gothic Revival and the Pre-Raphaelites.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, canvaswork in tent or petit point stitch again became popular. [...] The new fashion, using printed {{patterns}} and coloured tapestry wools imported from Berlin, was called <b>Berlin</b> <b>wool</b> work. Patterns and wool for Berlin work appeared in London in 1831. Berlin work was stitched to hand-coloured or charted patterns, leaving {{little room for}} individual expression, and was so popular that [...] "Berlin work" [...] became synonymous with [...] "canvaswork". [...] Its chief characteristic was intricate three-dimensional looks created by careful shading. [...] By mid-century, Berlin work was executed in bright colours {{made possible by the}} new synthetic dyes. [...] Berlin work was very durable and was made into furniture covers, cushions, bags, and slippers as well as for embroidered [...] "copies" [...] of popular paintings. The craze for Berlin work peaked around 1850 and died out in the 1870s, under the influence of a competing aesthetic that would become known as art needlework.|$|E

The building was later neglected and in the 1960s hardly noticed. In 1973 scaffolding, which had been erected for several years, was removed to reveal a refurbished building and a new exterior colour scheme of brown and creams. The architect Paul Pearn of Plymouth concluded, that these were the original colours after stripping layers of paint from the elaborate mouldings which were mainly of coade stone. The building was fully restored under the ownership of the Landmark Trust.|$|R

Now she sat crying all evening with this one on her lap; she gave up her daily walk to the <b>Berlin</b> <b>wool</b> shop, with all its romantic possibilities; at the clatter of the tea-things she would start apprehensively; she had let a red shawl lie for two days in the blue-and-white room.|$|E

So he hired a saddle-horse from [...] "The Magpie" [...] and started after breakfast on the morning after his arrival. In his unheroic days he would have walked,--as he had done, scores of times, over the whole distance from Guestwick to Allington. But now, in these grander days, he thought about his boots and the mud, and the formal appearance of the thing. [...] "Ah dear," [...] he said, to himself, as the nag walked slowly out of the town, [...] "it used to be better with me in the old days.

After {{engaging}} a room at the hotel, which I can assure you was the most unpleasant part of the business, for they seemed to be altogether unaccustomed to the arrival of young ladies unattended, I went into the town. It is not much of a place, and after making some little purchases and inquiring at several places, I heard of a maiden lady of that name. The woman who told me of her was communicative. 'She has just had a great piece of luck,' she said. 'About ten months back a nephew, whom everyone had supposed to have been lost at sea, came home with a great fortune, and they say that he has behaved most handsomely to her. She has always bought her <b>Berlin</b> <b>wool</b> and such things here, and she has spent three or four times as much since he came home as she did before, and I know from a neighbor, of whom she is a customer, that the yards and yards of flannel that she buys for making up into petticoats for poor children is wonderful. Do you know her, miss?' I said that I did not know her personally, but that some friends of mine, knowing that I was going to Stowmarket, had asked me to inquire if Miss Simcoe was still alive. I said casually that I might call and see her, and so got her address.|$|E
6000|$|Sometimes {{the aunts}} worked; {{sometimes}} Lady Barbara played and sang. They wanted Kate {{to sit up}} {{as they did with}} fancy work, and she had a bunch of flowers in <b>Berlin</b> <b>wool</b> which {{she was supposed to be}} grounding; but she much disliked it, and seldom set three stitches when her aunts' eyes were not upon her. Lady Jane was a great worker, and tried to teach her some pretty stitches; but though she began by liking to sit by the soft gentle aunt, she was so clumsy a pupil, that Lady Barbara declared that her sister must not be worried, and put a stop to the lessons. So Kate sometimes read, or dawdled over her grounding; or when Aunt Barbara was singing, she would nestle up to her other aunt, and go off into some dreamy fancy of growing up, getting home to the Wardours, or having them to live with her at her own home; or even of a great revolution, in which, after the pattern of the French nobility, she should have to maintain Aunt Jane by the labour of her hands! What was to become of Aunt Barbara was uncertain; perhaps she was to be in prison, and Kate to bring food to her in a little basket every day; or else she was to run away: but Aunt Jane was to live in a nice little lodging, with no one to wait on her but her dear little niece, who was to paint beautiful screens for her livelihood, and make her coffee with her own hands. Poor Lady Jane! ...|$|E

Can they all be {{dispersed}} over the face of the country, seeking the unfortunate Strolling Manager who decamped from the mouldy little Theatre last week, in the beginning of his season (as his play-bills testify), repentantly resolved to bring him back, and feed him, and be entertained? Or, can they all be gathered to their fathers in the two old churchyards near to the High Street - retirement into which churchyards appears to be a mere ceremony, there is so very little life outside their confines, and such small discernible difference between being buried alive in the town, and buried dead in the town tombs? Over the way, opposite to the staring blank bow windows of the Dodo, are a little ironmonger's shop, a little tailor's shop (with a picture of the Fashions in the small window and a bandy-legged baby on the pavement staring at it) - a watchmakers shop, where all the clocks and watches must be stopped, I am sure, for they could never have the courage to go, with the town in general, and the Dodo in particular, looking at them.

6000|$|Now I often {{wonder what}} I have {{inherited}} from this old minister. I must suppose, indeed, {{that he was}} fond of preaching sermons, and so am I, though I never heard it maintained that either of us loved to hear them. He sought health in his youth in the Isle of Wight, and I have sought it in both hemispheres; but whereas he found and kept it, I am still on the quest. He was a great lover of Shakespeare, whom he read aloud, I have been told, with taste; well, I love my Shakespeare also and am persuaded I can read him well, though I own I never have been told so. He made embroidery, designing his own patterns; and in that kind of work I never made anything but a kettle-holder in <b>Berlin</b> <b>wool,</b> and an odd garter of knitting, which was as black as the chimney before I had done with it. He loved port, and nuts, and porter; and so do I, but they agreed better with my grandfather, which seems to me a breach of contract. He had chalk-stones in his fingers; and these, in good time, I may possibly inherit, but I would much rather have inherited his noble presence. Try as I please, I cannot join myself on with the reverend doctor; and all the while, no doubt, and even as I write the phrase, he moves in my blood, and whispers words to me, and sits efficient in the very knot and centre of my being. In his garden, as I played there, I learned the love of mills--or had I an ancestor a miller?--and a kindness for the neighbourhood of graves, as homely things not without their poetry--or had I an ancestor a sexton? But what of the garden where he played himself?--for that, too, was a scene of my education. Some part of me played there in the eighteenth century, and ran races under the green avenue at Pilrig; some part of me trudged up Leith Walk, which was still a country place, and sat on the High School benches, and was thrashed, perhaps, by Dr. Adam. The house where I spent my youth was not yet thought upon; but we made holiday parties among the cornfields on its site, and ate strawberries and cream near by at a gardener's. All this I had forgotten; only my grandfather remembered and once reminded me. I have forgotten, too, how we grew up, and took orders, and went to our first Ayrshire parish, {{and fell in love with}} and married a daughter of Burns's Dr. Smith--"Smith opens out his cauld harangues." [...] I have forgotten, but I was there all the same, and heard stories of Burns at first hand.|$|E

50|$|<b>Berlin</b> <b>wool</b> work {{patterns}} were {{first published in}} Berlin, Germany, early in the 19th century. The first <b>Berlin</b> <b>wool</b> {{patterns were}} printed {{in black and white}} on grid paper and then hand-coloured. Previously, the stitcher was expected to draw the outlines on the canvas and then stitch following the colours on the pattern. Counted stitch patterns on charted paper, similar to modern cross-stitch patterns, made it easier to execute the designs, because {{there was no need for}} translating the patterns into actual wool colours by the stitchers themselves. They were published mostly as single sheets which made them affordable for the masses.|$|E
50|$|While {{similar to}} counted thread {{in regards to}} technique, in canvas work or needlepoint, threads are {{stitched}} through a fabric mesh to create a dense pattern that completely covers the foundation fabric. Examples of canvas work include bargello and <b>Berlin</b> <b>wool</b> work.|$|E
5000|$|Cross {{stitches}} were {{typical of}} 16th century canvas work, {{falling out of}} fashion in favor of tent stitch {{toward the end of}} the century. [...] Canvas work in cross stitch became popular again in the mid-19th century with the <b>Berlin</b> <b>wool</b> work craze.|$|E
5000|$|Canvas is {{a popular}} base fabric for {{embroidery}} such as cross-stitch and <b>Berlin</b> <b>wool</b> work.

5000|$|Many {{sorts of}} wood {{were used for}} the various colours; about 40 were in regular use.

50|$|In {{the late}} 1880s, {{the demand for}} <b>Berlin</b> <b>wool</b> work {{decreased}} dramatically, largely because the tastes had changed, but Berlin work publishers failed to accommodate new tastes. Other, less opulent styles of embroidery became more popular, such as the art needlework advocated by William Morris and his Arts and Crafts movement.|$|E
50|$|Further {{development}} of needlepoint was influenced in the 17th century by Bargello {{and in the}} 19th century by shaded <b>Berlin</b> <b>wool</b> work in brightly colored wool yarn. Upholstered furniture became fashionable in the 17th century, and this prompted the {{development of}} a more durable material to serve as a foundation for the embroidered works of art.|$|E
50|$|Before KPM Berlin {{was founded}} two {{attempts}} {{had already been}} made to establish a porcelain manufactory in Berlin.In 1751 the <b>Berlin</b> <b>wool</b> manufacturer Wilhelm Caspar Wegely was granted the royal privilege {{to set up a}} porcelain manufactory in Berlin.

The store expanded again by adding a new stationery and fancy goods department at 14-26 Old Christchurch Road, and moving into the new art of photography.|$|E
50|$|<b>Berlin</b> <b>wool</b> {{work and}} similar petit point stitchery resembles the heavily shaded, opulent styles of cross-stitch, and {{sometimes}} also used charted patterns on paper.Cross-stitch is often {{combined with other}} popular forms of embroidery, such as Hardanger embroidery or blackwork embroidery. Cross-stitch may also be combined with other work, such as canvaswork or drawn thread work. Beadwork and other embellishments such as paillettes, charms, small buttons and specialty threads of various kinds may also be used.|$|E
50|$|Multicoloured, shaded, painting-like {{patterns}} as we {{know them}} today are a fairly modern development, deriving from similar shaded patterns of <b>Berlin</b> <b>wool</b> work of the mid-nineteenth century. Besides designs created expressly for cross stitch, there are software programs that convert a photograph or a fine art image into a chart suitable for stitching. One stunning example of this is in the cross stitched reproduction of the Sistine Chapel charted and stitched by Joanna Lopianowski-Roberts.|$|E

50|$|Artist and {{designer}} William Morris {{is credited with}} {{the resurrection of the}} techniques of freehand surface embroidery based on English embroidery styles of the Middle Ages through the eighteenth century, developing the retro-style which would be termed art needlework.

5000|$|May Morris was an {{influential}} embroideress and designer, although her contributions are often overshadowed {{by those of}} her father, a towering figure in the Arts and Crafts movement. William Morris is credited with the resurrection of free-form embroidery in the style which would be termed art needlework. Art needlework emphasized freehand stitching and delicate shading in silk thread thought to encourage self-expression in the needleworker in sharp contrast with the brightly coloured <b>Berlin</b> <b>wool</b> work needlepoint and its [...] "paint by numbers" [...] aesthetic which had gripped much of home embroidery in the mid-19th century.|$|E
50|$|<b>Berlin</b> <b>wool</b> {{work is a}} {{style of}} {{embroidery}} similar to today's needlepoint. It was typically executed with wool yarn on canvas. It is usually worked in a single stitch, such as cross stitch or tent stitch although Beeton's book of Needlework (1870) describes 15 different stitches for use in Berlin work. It was traditionally stitched in many colours and hues, producing intricate three-dimensional looks by careful shading. The design of such embroidery {{was made possible by}} the great progresses made in dyeing in the 1830s, especially by the discovery of aniline dyes which produced bright colors.|$|E
