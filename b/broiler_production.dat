40|$|Effects of the Substitution of Groundnut Cake by Conventional Cottonseed Kernel on <b>Broilers</b> <b>Production</b> in Senegal.

Actual monthly production, processing, and marketing costs for the 14 months were obtained from seven instate <b>broiler</b> <b>production</b> firms whose annual <b>broiler</b> <b>production</b> represented approximately 250 million birds or 40 % of Georgia's total 1983 production. Feed conversion rates varied by. 1 kg or less of feed/kg of body weight from a high of 2. 03 in February 1983 to a low of 1. 93 in September 1983. This amounted to a cost difference of 10. 1 <j:/kg (4. 58 <j:/lb). Feed efficiency cost rates indicated that <b>broiler</b> <b>production</b> efficiencies were more adversely affected in Georgia by winter temperatures than summer tempera-tures. The PIK program and the summer drought were unexpected events that increased costs to the Georgia broiler industry. Estimated costs from January 1983 through September 1983 were $ 33. 3 million from the PIK program, $ 6. 5 million from the summer drought, and $ 1. 25 million from heat wave damage.

The study analyzed the countryâ€™s <b>broiler</b> <b>production</b> system and compared it with regional <b>broiler</b> <b>production.</b> The analysis was done to determine the measures of distortions in the local broiler industry and the competitiveness of <b>broiler</b> <b>production</b> in Zimbabwe given that the local broiler industry was protected from regional competition through import restrictions before the STERP. The main tool of analysis was the Policy Analysis Matrix (PAM). The PAM was used to analyse the private and social profitability of <b>broiler</b> <b>production</b> and the effects of distortions in domestic prices. Indicators of comparative advantage and measures of distortions were used in the analysis. Data were collected by survey of retail prices of inputs and output to construct the budgets whilst international prices were obtained from the internet and converted to the US dollar equivalent using the prevailing official exchange rates. The data were collected between March and July 2011. The quantities of inputs used in production were obtained from key industry players as well as the Ministry of Agriculture. In analysing the relationship between world prices and domestic prices for output and inputs, the Nominal Protection Coefficient (NPC) was used to see the extent of protection in the sector. From the analysis, the NPC on output was found to be 1. 38, indicating that domestic broiler meat prices are 38 percent higher than world prices. On inputs used, the research indicated an NPCI of 1. 264, implying that domestic prices are 26. 4 percent higher than social prices.
