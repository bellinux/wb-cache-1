5|$|Defining {{exactly what}} {{section of a}} DNA {{sequence}} comprises a gene is difficult. Regulatory regions of a gene such as enhancers do not necessarily have to <b>be</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> coding sequence on the linear molecule because the intervening DNA can be looped out to bring the gene and its regulatory region into proximity. Similarly, a gene's introns can be much larger than its exons. Regulatory regions can even be on entirely different chromosomes and operate in trans to allow regulatory regions on one chromosome to {{come in contact with}} target genes on another chromosome.|$|E
5|$|However, nuclear DNA {{sequence}} comparisons {{reported in}} 2017 suggest that Tapanuli orangutans diverged from Sumatran orangutans about 3.4 million years ago. Tapanuli orangutans diverged from Bornean orangutans, much later, about 670,000 years ago. Orangutans travelled from Sumatra to Borneo as the islands were connected by land bridges {{as parts of}} Sundaland during recent glacial periods when sea levels were much lower. The present range of Tapanuli orangutans is thought to <b>be</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> point where ancestral orangutans first entered what is now Indonesia from mainland Asia.|$|E

5|$|In 2012, {{the federal}} {{government}} accounted for about 29% of the jobs in Washington, D.C. This is thought to immunize Washington to national economic downturns because {{the federal government}} continues operations even during recessions.

5|$|Once food {{leaves the}} crop, it passes to the midgut (element 13 in {{numbered}} diagram), {{also known as}} the mesenteron, where the majority of digestion takes place. Microscopic projections from the midgut wall, called microvilli, increase the surface area of the wall and allow more nutrients to be absorbed; they tend to <b>be</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> origin of the midgut. In some insects, the role of the microvilli and where they are located may vary. For example, specialized microvilli producing digestive enzymes may more likely be {{near the end of the}} midgut, and absorption near the origin or beginning of the midgut.|$|E
5|$|Since Gliese 581c has {{not been}} {{detected}} directly, there are no measurements of its radius. Furthermore, the radial velocity method used to detect it only puts a lower limit on the planet's mass, which means theoretical models of planetary radius and structure can only be of limited use. However, assuming a random orientation of the planet's orbit, the true mass is likely to <b>be</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> measured minimum mass.|$|E

5|$|Kenney {{informed}} Whitehead of {{the proposed}} convoy date, and warned him about the usual Japanese pre-convoy air attack. He also urged that flying hours be cut back so as {{to allow for a}} large strike on the convoy, and instructed him to move forward as many aircraft as possible so that they could <b>be</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nearby captured airfields around Dobodura, where they would not be subject to the vagaries of weather over the Owen Stanley Range. Kenney flew up to Port Moresby on 26 February, where he met with Whitehead. The two generals inspected fighter and bomber units in the area, and agreed to attack the Japanese convoy in the Vitiaz Strait. Kenney returned to Brisbane on 28 February.|$|E
5|$|Longfellow {{returned}} to the United States in 1836 and took up the professorship at Harvard. He was required to live in Cambridge to <b>be</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> campus and, therefore, rented rooms at the Craigie House {{in the spring of}} 1837. The home was built in 1759 and was the headquarters of George Washington during the Siege of Boston beginning in July 1775. Elizabeth Craigie owned the home, the widow of Andrew Craigie, and she rented rooms on the second floor. Previous boarders included Jared Sparks, Edward Everett, and Joseph Emerson Worcester. It is preserved today as the Longfellow House–Washington's Headquarters National Historic Site.|$|E
5|$|Shirley Williams's {{political}} career (the House of Commons regularly sat until 10 pm) {{meant that the}} couple {{spent a lot of}} time apart. They bought a house in Furneux Pelham, Hertfordshire, near the border with north Cambridgeshire, while she lived in Phillimore Place during the week to <b>be</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Houses of Parliament. Sunday was often the only day they were together. The differences in their personal values– he was an atheist, she a Catholic– placed a further strain on their relationship. It reached breaking point in 1970 when Williams formed a relationship with Patricia Law Skinner, a commissioning editor for Cambridge University Press and wife of the historian Quentin Skinner. She had approached Williams to write the opposing view of utilitarianism for Utilitarianism: For and Against with J. J. C. Smart (1973), and they had fallen in love.|$|E

5|$|Hammond's {{performances}} {{earned him}} selection for the M.C.C. winter {{tour of the}} West Indies in the 1925–26 season. At that time, such tours were popular with amateur cricketers, who were often chosen for social rather than cricketing reasons. The touring party contained only eight professionals, who were expected to {{do most of the}} bowling and provide the cricketing quality. The West Indies team did not have Test status, so no official internationals were scheduled, but a series of representative matches against a West Indian team were played. Rain disrupted much of the cricket, but Hammond enjoyed the experience. In first-class matches, he scored 732 runs at an average of 48.80, with two hundreds and two fifties, and took 20 wickets at an average of 28.65. He scored 238 not out in the first representative game against a West Indies side. Following the tour, he won praise from Warner and the captain of the M.C.C. team, Freddie Calthorpe, and was believed to <b>be</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> full England side.|$|E
5|$|In his 1962 Ph.D. thesis, Clayton Ray {{considered}} O.hammondi to be {{most closely}} related to Megalomys, which includes giant rats from the Caribbean, and classified it {{as a member of}} the subgenus Megalomys of genus Oryzomys. In 1970, Hershkovitz treated the species in another publication and noted that his name Macruroryzomys was a nomen nudum ("naked name") because he had not explicitly mentioned characters differentiating it from other taxa in his 1948 publication. Nevertheless, he did not do anything to rectify the situation, and Macruroryzomys remains a nomen nudum. Hershkovitz rejected any relationship between O.hammondi and Nectomys or O.aphrastus and instead argued that O.hammondi was closely similar to Megalomys and may <b>be</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ancestor of Megalomys. In 1982, Steadman and Ray mentioned the animal in passing under the name Macruroryzomys hammondi and reaffirmed its relationship to Megalomys. In the 2005 third edition of Mammal Species of the World, Guy Musser and Michael Carleton listed O.hammondi as an Oryzomys of obscure affinities, but suggested that it may be related to Megalomys.|$|E
5|$|Prior to enclosure, Low Fell was {{predominantly}} {{inhabited by}} {{a small number of}} tinkers and hawkers but after enclosure the character of the suburb changed rapidly as people moved to <b>be</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> new turnpike road. Although neighbouring Sheriff Hill thrived through an influx of heavy industry, built upon a colliery and pottery particularly, by 1827 new allotment owners on Low Fell had spent heavily to improve land so that sod cottages were a rarity and the last remaining pit heaps had been removed. The result was that numerous wealthy individuals were drawn to the area and it was this influx which helped shape and grow the early settlement, as opposed to the more usual means of growth allied to work and industry. The 1880s were a decade of considerable building in the village, fueled by the completion of a tramway with nearby Gateshead in 1883 and this brought some light industry to the area; in the same year Mawson & Swan built their dry plate works in Kells Lane and this proved to be the first of several light industries to locate in that area. These smaller industries, allied to several farms in the Dryden Road area of the village (Dryden Farm, Orchard Cottage Dairy Farm and Derwent Crook Farm all survived in this area until the Second World War), generated a small economy in an area where inhabitants had built and settled predominantly to escape the dirt and grime of industrial Tyneside.|$|E
