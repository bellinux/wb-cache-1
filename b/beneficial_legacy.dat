5000|$|The {{result of}} the {{emergence}} of the [...] "outside the will" [...] theory has been seen with respect to witnesses to the will. Section 15 of the Wills Act states that any person [...] "attesting the execution of any will to whom or to whose wife or husband any <b>beneficial</b> <b>legacy...</b> shall be thereby given or made, such legacy... shall, so far only as concerns such person attesting the execution of such will, or the wife or husband of such person, or any person claiming under such person or wife or husband, be utterly null and void". In Re Young, an attesting witness was the beneficiary of a secret trust. The court decided that [...] "the Wills Act 1837 {{had nothing to do with}} it" [...] and the secret trust valid. The effect of the Wills Act 1968 has been to allow the trustee of a half-secret trust to attest the will and this may also apply to the fully secret trust.|$|E
40|$|Two {{decades after}} the end of central planning, we {{investigate}} {{the extent to which the}} advantages bequeathed by planning in terms of high investment in physical infrastructure and human capital compensated for the costs in allocative inefficiency and weak incentives for innovation. We assemble and analyse three separate types of evidence. First, we find that countries that were initially relatively poor prior to planning benefited more, as measured by long-run GDP per capita levels, from infrastructure and human capital than they suffered from weak market incentives. For initially relatively rich countries the opposite is true. Second, using various measures of physical stocks of infrastructure and human capital we show that at the end of planning, formerly planned countries had substantially different endowments from their contemporaneous market economy counterparts. However, these differences were much more important for poor than for rich countries. Finally, we use firm-level data to measure the cost of a wide range of constraints on firm performance, and we show that after more than a decade of transition in 2002 – 05, poor ex-planned economies differ much more from their market counterparts, in respect to both good and bad aspects of the planning legacy, than do relatively rich ones. However, the persistent <b>beneficial</b> <b>legacy</b> effects disappeared under the pressure of strong growth in the formerly planned economies in the run-up to the global financial crisis...|$|E
3000|$|In 2005, London {{was chosen}} as the 2012 Olympic city, beating Paris, Moscow, Madrid, and New York, after four rounds of voting (IOC 2015; IOC [...] 2017). For {{the first time in the}} history of Olympics, the British capital was the first hosting city with a {{comprehensive}} legacy plan that was already in execution before the staging of the Games (Chappelet 2008). Indeed, in 2003, the Olympic Committee amended its charter to include an additional statement in its mission that focused on the generation of <b>beneficial</b> <b>legacies</b> for hosting cities. Since 2003, all bidding cities are required to have a legacy plan in their candidacy files, explaining post event usage for sports facilities and long-term plans for the areas involved in the Games (Chappelet 2008).|$|R
30|$|To conclude, {{there are}} ways to {{optimise}} the Olympic budget and foster <b>beneficial</b> <b>legacies,</b> and some of them were at least partially utilized in London. For example, the use of temporary facilities that are dismantled just after the event is very helpful, as it helps in avoiding white elephants and maintenance costs. Also, privileging a spread event, by using sports clusters that include already existing venues, is a successful strategy. Private funding and sponsorship should be utilized more and more to cover part of the costs. Plan well ahead a legacy plan instead of retrofitting after the event, {{as in the case of}} London, is extremely helpful in avoiding delays and unnecessary costs of reconversion. Also, linking the event to the city master plan, by using the Olympics to trigger and foster the regeneration or redevelopment of entire urban areas can help in prioritizing the budget and reduce the gap between the total Olympic budget and the costs of the legacies.|$|R
40|$|The term ‘legacy effect’—a {{memory of}} a {{treatment}} which pro-duces benefits long after the cessation of the intervention—was adopted {{for the first time}} to describe the benefits of early and strict control of diabetes on cardiovascular complications. The search for a similar effect for early treatment of immune-mediated renal diseases, interrupting some self-amplification loops of the pathogenetical immunological mechanisms and leaving a perma-nent memory, is fascinating. Some recent reports suggest a long-term <b>beneficial</b> or <b>legacy</b> effect of early treatment of IgA nephro-pathy after a randomized controlled trial (RCT) using mycophe-nolate mofetil, methylprednisolone pulses or steroid/ immunosuppressive multiple therapy, or prolonged steroid doses associated with tonsillectomy. Long-lasting effects of treatments are more likely to be achieved in early stages of IgA nephropathy...|$|R
40|$|After {{the end of}} the 2002 Olympic Winter Games, {{the city}} of Salt Lake faces the {{difficult}} challenge to keep its status as a world city, an attractive destination for tourists and an active, promising place for the locals. Salt Lake has received international acclaim for the ability to stage a very successful edition of the Games. This success has particular merit considering the difficult political circumstances leading to and surrounding the Olympic period. However, such a valuable achievement is no guarantee of a provision of <b>legacies</b> <b>beneficial</b> for the host citizens and regional neighbours in the long-term. This paper argues that a way to ensure the sustainability of hosting major sporting events is to ground them on cultural elements that are representative and distinctive of the host community. The argument is based on the research undertaken by Garcia (2001) to support the claim that the marketing of sports events can be maximised through cultural and arts extensions. The paper is also a complement to claims by Hall (2002 in press) that the success of great sports events should not be measured solely in economic terms but also considering its social impacts at length. The Olympic Games are seen as an event with great potential for social and cultural legacies thanks to its being rooted on an idiosyncratic tradition of symbols and rituals. Nevertheless, this symbology has been often transferred from one host-city to the next without major attention being paid to the particular character of the place, or by constraining any sense of locality into token gestures. A commitment towards framing sporting excellence and Olympic symbols within cultura...|$|R
