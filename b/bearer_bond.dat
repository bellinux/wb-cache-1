The Continental dollar was a zero-interest <b>bearer</b> <b>bond,</b> not a pure fiat currency. The public was promised redemption at face value in specie at fixed future dates. When time-discounting (rational bond pricing) is separated from depreciation, little depreciation occurred before 1779.

Because these new dates were not fiscally feasible, Congress’ commitment to the Continental dollar lost credibility. Depreciation and collapse followed shortly thereafter. ...|$|E
