The test load must be applied to some part of the sample and transferred through the sample to the bond.

This study reports laboratory enamel microshear bond strengths of a self-etching priming and three all-in-one systems and also evaluates two different microshear <b>bond</b> <b>test</b> methods. Methods: One hundred and nineteen enamel specimens were bonded (0. 8 mm diameter) with either Clearfil Protect Bond (Kuraray), Xeno III (Dentsply), G Bond (GC) or One-Up Bond F (Tokuyama) using Palfique Estelite resin composite and stored in 37 °C water for seven days. The microshear <b>bond</b> <b>test</b> method used either a blade or wire to apply the shear stress. Results were analysed with one-way ANOVA and post hoc (Tukey) multiple comparison analysis. Results: Clearfil Protect Bond demonstrated higher and more consistent bond strengths than Xeno III, G Bond or One-Up Bond F. The wire method showed much greater reliability in results, with a coefficient of variation half that of the blade method.

40|$|Synopsis: Limited {{information}} {{is known about}} the effects of environmental conditions during installation on quality and performance of the bond between carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) reinforcement and substrate material. This research study investigates the effect of surface moisture, relative humidity and temperature on the bond strength between concrete and CFRP reinforcement. Three test methods including a surface pull-off <b>bond</b> <b>test,</b> a surface shear-torsion <b>bond</b> <b>test,</b> and a flexural test were used to evaluate the bond performance of the FRP fabric under various installation conditions. Test results revealed that the high surface moisture content, extreme humidity and extreme low temperature can be detrimental to bond strength. Although the high temperature improved the bond strength, it is not recommended because of decreased set-time and saturant workability. Based on the results presented in this paper, a maximum allowable limit on surface moisture content, relative humidity, and temperature of 4. 3 %, 82 %, and 90 oF, respectively, at installation is recommended...|$|E

Results obtained from both the direct tensile <b>bond</b> <b>test</b> and flexural <b>bond</b> <b>test</b> indicate that the addition of polyacrylic ester and silica fumes improves the bond strength significantly, and the enhancement is more obvious with polyacrylic ester paste as interfacial adhesives.

In order to assess the influence of geometrical and mechanical properties of the adhesive on the debonding load, parametric analyses have been carried out by means of some selected bond strength models. The effectiveness of these models has been also checked by means of comparisons with experimental debonding loads collected from technical literature. The second objective of the paper is the comparison of the bond behavior of FRP-steel and FRP-concrete joints in order to identify the role of the adhesive on the bond behavior separately from the concrete. The comparison is aimed to assess bond laws for FRP-concrete joints taking into account the only nonlinearities of the adhesive and to model the concrete as a nonlinear material.

40|$|Abstract. The {{increased}} use of carbon fibre reinforced plastics (CFRP) and the constant urge for lighter structures make of adhesive bonding an assembly technology with a great potential for high-loaded structures in the aeronautic industry. A prerequisite for such an application is that the bond quality of the adhesive joint can be controlled in a non destructive way. Non-destructive testing (NDT) methods exist for the characterisation of defects like pores, delamination or debonding in adhesive bonds. However, these NDT methods for conventional “defectoscopy ” do not allow {{the evaluation of the}} adhesion strength of an adhesive bond, what currently prevents a wider use of this assembly technology. Laser Proof Tests in the opposite have been identified as high potential techniques to assess the bond mechanical performance in a non-destructive way (provided the bond has the required level of performance), by simulating a precise tensile effort with shock wave at the bondline-substrate interface. This paper presents a study of the laser adhesion test from CNRS PPrime institute on the targeted application of adhesive <b>bond</b> <b>test.</b> CFRP bonded samples are prepared in a specific way and characterised by NDT techniques to assess the absence of any detectable defect. Their bond strength is evaluated by mechanical destructive tests. Further on, the bonded samples are tested by Laser adhesion test to evaluate the power and settings of the laser technique required for the <b>bond</b> <b>test.</b> All results are then correlated to estimate what key parameters shall be readjusted. 1...|$|E

Several types of end anchoring devices have been proposed, especially for concrete elements, but for none of them design indications for predicting the increase in failure load have been suggested so far.

To assess the performance and reliability of small-scale testing on near-surface mounted (NSM) FRP strengthening systems, an experimental program was carried out {{on a series of}} nine NSM FRP strengthening systems (bars and strips), in the framework of an international round robin testing (RRT). Eleven laboratories and seven manufacturers and suppliers participated in this extensive international exercise, which regarded both NSM and EBR FRP strengthening systems.

The results show no significant influence of the concrete strength on both failure modes and loads. On the other hand, axial stiffness and surface treatment of the FRP NSM systems strongly affect both the bond strength and the parameters identifying the bond laws.
