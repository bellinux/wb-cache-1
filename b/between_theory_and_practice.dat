5|$|Unlike unique {{sciences}} such as mathematics, the perspective, activity, or {{discipline of}} design is not {{brought to a}} generally accepted common denominator. The historical beginnings of design are complex {{and the nature of}} design is still the subject of ongoing discussion. In design, there are strong differentiations <b>between</b> <b>theory</b> <b>and</b> <b>practice.</b> The fluid nature of the theory allows the designer to operate without being constrained by a rigid structure. In practice, decisions are often referred to as intuition. In his Classification of Design (1976), Gorb divided design into three different classes. Design management operates in and across all three classes: product (e.g. industrial design, packaging design, service design), information (e.g. graphic design, branding, media design, web design), and environment (e.g. retail design, exhibition design, interior design).|$|E

2500|$|Like elsewhere, in India too anti-idealists and materialists took {{practice}} {{as the main}} criterion of truth. Nyaya-Vaisheshikas were most outspoken in this regard, [...] "after a knowledge is proved true in practice, there remains {{no doubt about the}} proof; hence the question of proving does not arise". On the other hand, the idealists believed in complete separation <b>between</b> <b>theory</b> <b>and</b> <b>practice.</b> They adhered to, in the words of Kumarila Bhatta, the principle of bahyartha-sunyatva (the unreality of the objects of knowledge), which, according to Debiprasad Chattopadhyaya, formed [...] "the real pivot of idealism throughout its Indian career".|$|E

2500|$|The {{formation}} of a College for engineering, or technical university, was quite a difficult project, as the entire subject of engineering education was obscure. A small number of colleges had commenced this, such as Stevens Institute of Technology in New Jersey and Harvard, Yale, and RPI in New York; MIT and Cornell were just being founded. The University of Pennsylvania opened a small school in 1852, for mining and materials, but which had closed {{at the onset of}} the Civil War. As W. Ross Yates notes: [...] "No one knew with certainty how many years a course [...] in engineering should take, or even what branches of engineering should be included within a university. The relationship <b>between</b> <b>theory</b> <b>and</b> <b>practice</b> was hazy." [...] A statement made years later by industrialist and Lehigh Trustee Eckley B.

60|$|On the whole, it was {{a society}} such as has seldom met together; nor, perhaps, could it {{reasonably}} be expected to hold together long. Persons of marked individuality--crooked sticks, as some of us might be called--are not exactly the easiest to bind up into a fagot. But, so long as our union should subsist, a man of intellect and feeling, with a free nature in him, might have sought far and near without finding so many points of attraction as would allure him hitherward. We were of all creeds and opinions, and generally tolerant of all, on every imaginable subject. Our bond, it seems to me, was not affirmative, but negative. We had individually found {{one thing or another}} to quarrel with in our past life, and were pretty well agreed as to the inexpediency of lumbering along with the old system any further. As to what should be substituted, there was much less unanimity. We did not greatly care--at least, I never did--for the written constitution under which our millennium had commenced. My hope was, that, <b>between</b> <b>theory</b> <b>and</b> <b>practice,</b> a true and available mode of life might be struck out; and that, even should we ultimately fail, the months or years spent in the trial would not have been wasted, either as regarded passing enjoyment, or the experience which makes men wise.|$|E

40|$|Some recent {{developments}} in democratic theory have combined with practical concerns to challenge traditional understandings of political inclusion by extending this to the non-human realm. This article demonstrates the dynamic relationship <b>between</b> the <b>theory</b> <b>and</b> <b>practice</b> of inclusion by examining two projects: a resolution to grant certain rights to great apes passed by the Spanish parliament in 2008, and Bruno Latour's attempt to define a new politics based on complex assemblages of humans and non-humans. The choice of these projects is not incidental: the former has an explicitly practical intent while the latter is more theoretically focused. Both are interesting in and of themselves, but {{the point here is}} to explore what each can tell us about the interdependence <b>between</b> the <b>theory</b> <b>and</b> <b>practice</b> of inclusion. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{argues that}} {{the debate over the}} {{relationship}} <b>between</b> <b>Theory</b> <b>and</b> political <b>practice</b> has reached a dead-end in IR. Most scholars taking part in this debate based their claims on meta-theoretical assumptions, which explains the inability to settle the debate. This logic not only discouraged empirical enquiries, but also undermined reflexivity. Instead, this thesis calls for the translation of these meta-theoretical assumptions into a methodology and into methods to produce empirical knowledge by which to explore the relationships <b>between</b> <b>Theory</b> <b>and</b> political <b>practice</b> on specific issues. To this end, the thesis investigates relationships between American IR academic discourse and senior officials discourse and their effects on US foreign policy towards Iran between 1998 and 2014. The thesis provides a typology to map and to assess the gaps in the debate over the relationship <b>between</b> <b>Theory</b> <b>and</b> political <b>practice</b> in IR. This typology is composed of four ideal-types: Theory to political practice, Theory vs. political practice, <b>Theory</b> as political <b>practice</b> <b>and</b> <b>practice</b> to political practice. The thesis also translates meta-theoretical assumptions drawn from Wittgenstein and Foucault into a methodology to generate empirical knowledge on specific relationships <b>between</b> <b>Theory</b> <b>and</b> political <b>practice.</b> This methodology enables to trace an evolving system of thoughts expressed in the <b>Theory</b> <b>and</b> political <b>practice</b> of the Iranian nuclear crisis and to expose what this system does to US society and foreign policy. Three elements compose this system: the certainty of democratic teleology, the certainty of uncertainty and the certainty of smart power. The thesis claims that IR knowledge production on Iran mostly acted as symbolic knowledge morphing uncertainties about Iran into certainties for US governmental power. Only then could senior officials produce a judgement against Iran and implement disciplinary measures in the form of sanctions, covert actions, and military threats...|$|R
