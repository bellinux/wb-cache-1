40|$|For silage production, {{high bulk}} density (BD) is {{critical}} to minimize aerobic deterioration facilitated by oxygen intrusion. To precisely assess packing quality for bunker silos, there is a desire to visualize the BD distribution within the silage. In this study, a penetrometer-based mapping system was developed. The data processing included filtering of the penetration friction component (PFC) out of the penetration resistance (PR), transfer of the corrected penetration resistance (PRc) to BD, incorporation of Kriged interpolation for data expansion and map generation. The experiment was conducted in a maize <b>bunker</b> <b>silo</b> (width: 8 m, middle height: 3 m). The BD distributions near the <b>bunker</b> <b>silo</b> face were represented using two map groups, one related to horizontal- {{and the other to}} vertical-density distribution patterns. We also presented a comparison between the map-based BD results and core sampling data. Agreement between the two measurement approaches (RMSE = 19. 175 kg·m− 3) demonstrates that the developed penetrometer mapping system may be beneficial for rapid assessment of aerobic deterioration potential in bunker silos...|$|E
40|$|LCA of Silage – {{comparison}} of Tower silo, <b>Bunker</b> <b>silo</b> and Round-bales The {{purpose of this}} study was to investigate the differences in environmental impact from three types of silage (silage from tower silo, <b>bunker</b> <b>silo</b> and round-bales) used in Swedish dairy production. The silage was studied from ley cultivation, via harvesting and silage making up to and including delivery at the feeding table. The environmental impact categories studied were: energy use, global warming potential (GWP), acidification potential (AP) and eutrophication potential (EP). The results showed only small differences between the studied silage alternatives, with round-bale silage as the most energy efficient and tower silage as the least contributing to GWP, AP and EP. Ley cultivation was the dominant source to GWP, AP and EP for all alternatives. For energy use, the subsequent silage handling chain was more important, including a surprisingly high energy use for producing silage agents. A sensitivity analysis indicated that losses can have a large impact on the environmental outcome of silage production, and that the systems therefore should be optimized to reduce losses...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to evaluate the effects of dry matter (DM) content and three different storage systems on the quality of alfalfa ensiled on commercial farms. Alfalfa silage samples were collected from 21 <b>bunker</b> <b>silos,</b> 20 silos that limited oxygen infiltration, and 19 tower silos on 43 commercial dairy farms. Storage system and DM content were confounded because silages from <b>bunker</b> <b>silos</b> generally were wetter than silages from O 2 -limiting and tower silos. There was no effect of storage system on crude protein content of the silages. However, silage from <b>bunker</b> <b>silos</b> had higher concentrations of nonprotein N, NH 3 N, and acid detergent insoluble N than did silages from the other two storage systems. The proportion of total N in neutral detergent insoluble N minus acid detergent insoluble N was greatest in silage from O 2 -limiting silos. Fiber components were affected by storage system; silage from <b>bunker</b> <b>silos</b> had the greatest concentration of acid detergent fiber and neutral detergent fiber. Concentrations of acid detergent fiber and neutral detergent fiber were higher in wetter silages from <b>bunker</b> <b>silos,</b> but DM content did not influence fiber content of silages from O 2 -limiting and tower silos. Concentrations of total organic acids, acetic acid, and butyric acid were highest in silages from <b>bunker</b> <b>silos.</b> The general effects of DM on the quality of silages obtained from commercial dairy farms were similar to results obtained from laboratory-scale silos...|$|R

40|$|An {{efficient}} feed {{management is}} important for a sustainable and economic agricultural production. One of the main points for improving the efficiency is the reduction of feed losses. In the present investigation the dry matter (DM) losses of grass, lucerne and maize silages in farm scaled <b>bunker</b> <b>silos</b> were analysed. The method of determining DM losses was the total-in versus total-out DM mass flow of the silos, including the determination of DM content and other silage parameters via manual sampling. The results taken from 48 silos showed on average for all investigated crops 9 – 12 % of DM losses. Density and feed out rate showed a negative correlation to DM losses in maize silages. According to the applied method for determining DM losses on farm scale, a guideline of 8 % can be suggested for maximum DM losses in <b>bunker</b> <b>silos</b> for grass and maize silages.

The objective {{of this study was}} to determine those practices or factors most correlated with <b>bunker</b> <b>silo</b> density. Density was measured in 175 bunker silos across Wisconsin using core samples collected at chest height (1. 13 m, 3. 70 ft, on average) across the feed-out face. Silo filling practices were surveyed and correlated with density. Most silages sampled were alfalfa or corn. Dry matter densities ranged from 106 to 434 kg/m 3 (6. 6 to 27. 1 lb/ft 3). The core densities were correlated with the height of silage above the core, indicating the effect of selfcompaction. To adjust for this, all densities were corrected for the median depth below the surface (2. 16 m or 7. 09 ft) using the equations of Pitt (1983) for density with height for the center of tower silos. The adjusted dry matter densities were most strongly correlated with how thinly a load was spread (L), tractor weight (W), packing time per tonne as-fed (T), and dry matter content (D). These four factors were combined into a packing factor [W (TD) 1 / 2 L – 1] that explained 18. 2 % of the variation in dry matter density. Additional factors such as the use of dual wheels, etc. did not significantly improve the prediction of dry matter density.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to characterize the nutritive value of corn silage made on intensive dairy farms and demonstrate the nutritional variations between silages located at the top and {{at the center of a}} <b>bunker</b> <b>silo.</b> Thirty-two dairy farms were visited in four Brazilian states. One corn <b>bunker</b> <b>silo</b> of each farm was chosen and samples were collected from the top and center parts. The nutritive value, fermentation end-products, and microbial counts were assessed. The predicted milk was determined by Milk 2006 spreadsheet. The mean, standard deviation, maximum, minimum, and 95 % confidence interval of all data were calculated. The ash, neutral detergent fiber (NDF), starch, in vitro NDF, and dry matter (DM) digestibility data were compared with reference value. Both statistical procedures were performed through the PROC MEANS of SAS. The mean values found at the center for NDF, starch, total digestible nutrients (TDN- 1 x), and estimated milk were 503 g kg− 1 DM, 308 g kg− 1 DM, 583 g kg− 1, and 1, 124 kg t− 1, respectively. The top silages presented a mean TDN- 1 x and predicted milk of 559 g kg− 1 and 1046 kg t− 1, respectively. For NDF digestibility and starch concentration, 53. 1 % and 62. 5 % of the center samples presented a value equal to or above the reference value (500 g kg− 1 and 300 g kg− 1 DM for NDF digestibility and starch concentration, respectively). Overall, the corn silage produced on intensive dairy farms in Brazil has satisfactory nutritive value, especially in terms of starch concentration. Some parameters, such as the concentration of fiber and its digestibility, should be improved. This study also shows that a silo may contain two different types of silage: top and center.

40|$|Silage {{is today}} a common feed for {{different}} animals. A general way of storing silage is in <b>bunker</b> <b>silos</b> covered with polyethylene film.

Another purpose of the study was therefore to investigate some alternative edible covering materials that can come to replace the polyethylene film in the future.

With reference to the Italian situation, {{in the last years}} about 10 % of the overall maize area is earmarked to biogas production causing a changing in its harvesting operations.

40|$|Preface. This {{report is}} a product of the Cornell “open burning group, ” which formed in Winter 2002 to assess the extent and {{environmental}} health significance of open burning of household wastes and agricultural plastics in New York State (NYS), and begin work towards reducing these practices in order to protect public health and the environment. The report focuses on disposal of agricultural plastics—rather than on the household waste stream—for reasons that include the importance of agriculture in NY and the role of Cornell’s College of Agriculture and Life Sciences in working with NYS agriculture and the environment. Background and rationale. Plastics (LDPE, HDPE, polystyrene resins) have become ubiquitous in agriculture: In dairy farming they are used as silage bags, <b>bunker</b> <b>silo</b> covers, bale wraps and twines; in nurseries and ornamental horticulture they are used as hoophouse covers, trays and containers; in fruit and vegetable production, as row covers and mulch films. Plastic pesticide containers are used in all sectors of agriculture. Increasingly, plastics are substituted for the longer lasting materials previously used in agriculture (e. g., silage bags in place of concrete silos, plastic hoop houses in place of glass green houses) because of production efficiency and economics. More than half the plastics are disposed by burning onfarm, with most of the remainder buried or dumped on-farm. Due to inefficiencies of open combustion, emissions from open burning are much greater per mass of material burned than emissions from controlled incineration (e. g., 20 times as much dioxin, 40 times as much particulate matter). These emissions pose risks to human health...|$|E
40|$|This project {{involved}} an experiment conducted using a 550 -ton capacity drive-over pile of whole-plant corn silage. The main effects compared were: packing the final forage {{surface with a}} loader or crawler, delay or immediate sealing, and covering with standard plastic or an oxygen barrier film. Numerous {{studies have shown that}} the absence of oxygen in silage stored in a <b>bunker</b> <b>silo</b> or pile is crucial for proper fermentation and to ensure the highest quality silage at feed out. When oxygen is allowed to permeate through the covering material, it leads to visible spoilage. This trial showed that the oxygen barrier film reduced organic matter loss in the outer 18 inches of the pile and there was less visible spoilage compared to the silage covered with the standard plastic (8. 3 percent difference in OM loss). When the crawler was used to pack the final surface compared to the loader, there was less organic matter loss in the outer layer of the pile (5. 3 percent difference). By delaying 24 hours to seal the pile, the data showed that organic matter loss increased compared to sealing immediately (3. 3 percent difference) as more oxygen was allowed to permeate the outer layer of forage, which prolonged the aerobic phase and slowed the fermentation process. Silage packed with the crawler, sealed immediately, and covered with oxygen barrier film had higher nutritional quality in the outer 0 to 18 inches of the pile than silage packed with the loader, delay sealed, and covered with standard plastic...|$|E

To better {{understand}} and predict silage density in <b>bunker</b> <b>silos,</b> chopped whole-plant corn {{was placed in}} layers of 0. 15, 0. 30, 0. 45, and 0. 60 m in a 482 - � 584 -mm rectangular container simulating the footprint of a tractor tire. Pressure between 20 and 80 kPa {{was applied to the}} forage by a platen. The total time of compaction varied between 1 and 10 s. A total of 25 tests were conducted with crop dry matter (DM) content ranging between 33 % and 44 %. The pre-compressed density of the first layer (0. 30 m high) averaged 95 kg DM/m 3. The highest compressed density ranged between 169 and 261 kg DM/m 3 with an average of 216 kg DM/m 3. After releasing pressure, the relaxed density of the first layer ranged between 117 and 153 kg DM/m 3 with an average of 131 kg DM/m 3. After six layers, the average relaxed density became 185 kg DM/m 3, a density 14 % lower than the average highest compressed density. A logarithmic model fit the data very well (R 2 � 0. 93 in 24 out of 25 tests), indicating that density increased continually as the number of layers increased. Model parameters were significantly affected by pressure, layer thickness, and crop processing while time of compaction had a small effect. DM content was not significant. A model based on extrapolation of laboratory results is proposed to predict density for deep <b>bunker</b> <b>silos,</b> but field data are required to validate the model under such conditions.

40|$|Silage is {{a common}} way of storing and feeding forage in the United States. There are 4 phases (aerobic, anaerobic, stable, and feedout) that silage undergoes. The most {{critical}} phases to manage to minimize nutritive losses are when the silage is going from an aerobic to an anaerobic environment and at feedout. The first important step in achieving silage of high nutritive value is to harvest at the proper maturity and moisture level. Alfalfa should be harvested between mid bud and one-tenth bloom, and corn should be harvested between one-half and two-thirds milkline. The type of silo (pile, bunker, bag, or upright) {{has an impact on}} silage DM lost during storage. Bunker silos and piles usually have higher silage DM loss than bag and upright silos primarily because there is a greater amount of surface area exposed to oxygen. Limited research suggests that the nutritive value of high DM corn silage (~ 38 %) can be preserved better (increased milk production) in a bagged silo system compared to a <b>bunker</b> <b>silo.</b> Filling bunker silos rapidly using the progressive wedge technique has been shown to improve the nutritive value of silage. Covering bunker silos with polyethylene plastic also improves the amount of silage DM recovered and the nutritive value of both hay crop and corn silage. During the feedout phase it is important to feed approximately 5 inches or more from the silo face each day to minimize losses in quality that occur when silage is exposed to oxygen...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} harvesting systems and presents conclusions on selection of machines for harvesting silage for dairy cows. Achieving {{a high quality}} cut of forage requires a high machine capacity and harvesting {{must be carried out}} at the optimal time with respect to plant growth stage. Therefore calculation of timeliness costs, which are determined by the time and capacity of harvesting, formed {{an important part of the}} study. These calculations require timeliness factors that describe the losses for each day by which harvest is delayed after the date of maximum economic crop value. The timeliness factors were calculated for each cut from data on changes in yield and quality of cuts during the harvest period. Harvesting cost calculations were based on a precision chop forage trailer, a precision chop forage harvester with separate transport trailers and a round baler with integral wrapping. Cost calculations were carried out for three different sizes of machine chain (small (S), medium (M) and large (L)) for each harvest system. The operations included were mowingconditioning, harvesting in the field, transport to storage and loading and packing into a <b>bunker</b> <b>silo.</b> Harvesting costs included the cost of machines, labour and timeliness. In addition, ensiling costs such as bale plastic and the investment, interest and maintenance cost for the <b>bunker</b> <b>silo</b> or the storage area for round bales were included when comparing the harvesting systems. Calculations were made for a three-cut system in conventional (CONV) and organic (ORG) forage production in southern Sweden (Gss) and central Sweden (Ss). When timeliness costs were not considered there was a risk of too low a harvest capacity being chosen. The effect of including timeliness costs when calculating harvesting costs increased with the forage area harvested, since a larger forage area increased the duration of harvest. Table S 1 shows harvesting and ensiling costs with 1 km transport distance for 70 hectares of forage in conventional production and 90 hectares in organic production in central Sweden. At short transport distances (1 km), the precision chop forage trailer and the precision chop forage harvester with separate transport trailers had similar harvesting and ensiling costs, while those for round baling were somewhat higher. The precision chop forage harvester with 2 or 3 transport trailers resulted in the lowest costs at 2 - 7 km transport distance. At longer transport distances (> 7 km), the round baler was the cheapest of the harvesting systems studied here. As regards machine capacity, it is clear from Figure S 1 that to minimise harvesting costs the smallest machine chain should be used for forage areas less than 60 ha, whereas when the forage area exceeds 90 ha the largest machine chain should be chosen. In the 60 - 90 ha forage area range, there was little difference in costs between the S, M and L machine chains. For harvest with round bales only the size of the mower-conditioner varied between the machine chains and the largest machine chain had the lowest harvest costs for all forage areas. Machine cooperatives are a good way to lower harvesting costs since for smaller forage areas in particular, increased annual use of the machines decreases the machine costs and allows larger machines to be used to greater capacity. To avoid high timeliness costs it is important that cuts are performed at the optimal time...|$|E
40|$|Lameness and {{subacute}} ruminal acidosis (SARA) both {{appear to}} be very prevalent throughout the US dairy industry. Reduced ruminal efficiency, liver and lung abscesses, and laminitis are all thought to be re-lated to SARA. Both the nutritionist and dairy manag-ers {{are responsible for the}} delivery and consumption of a ration that is likely to produce a ruminally healthy pH. Nutritionists should consider the expected amount of physically effective neutral detergent fiber provided by ration ingredients, along with their expected rumi-nal fermentabilities and resultant microbial acid pro-duction. Environmental conditions, such as heat stress, overcrowding, and uncomfortable stalls, which may al-ter feed intake patterns and animal behavior, should also be considered in ration formulation. Additional amounts of physically effective neutral detergent fiber, and/or a reduction in ruminal nonstructural carbohy-drate availability, may be warranted during times of increased animal stress. Higher levels of intake may also predispose the rumen to SARA, since salivary buffer secretion may not adequately compensate for additional acid production. Forage drymatter should be determined twice weekly, or more frequently if results vary by more than 5 percent of the dry matter value. Ration variability can be further reduced by premixing individual forages, or at least attempting to make each loader bucket of feed a uniform mix obtained from the entire height or face of the <b>bunker</b> <b>silo.</b> Ingredient se-quencing and mixing time should be standardized on a given dairy.

Dry matter (DM) and organic matter (OM) losses, {{fermentation}} characteristics, in-situ DM digestibility, and temperatures were measured at 10, 20, and 30 {{inches from the}} original silage surface. Sealing the exposed surface increased DM and OM recoveries and improved fermentation quality and nutritive value in both crops, regardless of depth. The unsealed corn silages were much hotter within the top 3 ft than sealed silages, indicating aerobic losses. As expected, the unsealed silages from both crops deteriorated severely i n the top 20 inches. Placing a roof over the unsealed silos increased the silage DM content at all three depths, but did not consistently improve the storage efficiency or silage quality of either crop...|$|R
5000|$|Silos are {{potentially}} hazardous: deaths may {{occur in the}} process of filling and maintaining them, and several safety precautions are necessary. There is a risk of injury by machinery or from falls. When a silo is filled, fine dust particles in the air can become explosive because of their large aggregate surface area. Also, fermentation presents respiratory hazards. The ensiling process produces [...] "silo gas" [...] during {{the early stages of the}} fermentation process. Silage gas contains nitric oxide (NO), which will react with oxygen (O2) in the air to form nitrogen dioxide (NO2), which is toxic. Lack of oxygen inside the silo can cause asphyxiation. Molds that grow when air reaches cured silage can cause organic dust toxic syndrome. Collapsing silage from large <b>bunker</b> <b>silos</b> has caused deaths. Silage itself poses no special danger.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. A {{laboratory}} apparatus {{was developed}} to simulate pressure, time of compaction, and layer thickness as applied in a <b>bunker</b> <b>silo.</b> Chopped alfalfa or orchardgrass was placed in layers of 0. 15, 0. 30, and 0. 45 m in a 482 - × 584 -mm rectangular container simulating the footprint of a tractor tire. Pressure between 20 and 80 kPa {{was applied to the}} forage by a platen. The total time of compaction varied between 2 and 10 s. A total of 23 tests (17 with alfalfa, 3 with grass, and 3 with mixed alfalfa-grass) were conducted; dry matter (DM) concentration ranged between 20 % and 54 %. The pre-compressed density of the first layer (0. 30 m high) averaged 72 and 55 kg DM/m 3 for alfalfa and grass, respectively. The highest compressed density ranged between 138 and 339 kg DM/m 3 with an average of 220 kg DM/m 3. After releasing pressure, the relaxed density of the first, uppermost layer ranged between 81 and 152 kg DM/m 3 with an average of 127 kg DM/m 3. After six layers, the average relaxed density was 181 kg DM/m 3, 18 % lower than the average highest compressed density. As successive layers were added, the cumulative DM density increased according to a logarithmic model. The model suggested that density would continually increase, slowly but without reaching a plateau, as the silo height increased. Within the experimental range, parameters of the logarithmic model were significantly affected by pressure, DM content, crop species and chop length, but not by layer thickness or time of compaction. More laboratory data are needed to understand interactions between the variables while field validation is necessary to extrapolate results to deep bunker silos. Keywords.

40|$|The {{national}} {{guidelines for}} design of silage <b>bunker</b> <b>silo</b> walls {{are not available}} today. The present calculation and design is based on previously issued guidelines. These were elaborated {{to be used in}} designing silo wall heights of maximum 3 m. There are reasons to believe that these guidelines overestimate the forces and pressures, mainly from silage juice, that are occurring especially for silo walls > 3 m. This could result in over-sizing, material waste and increased investment costs. The aim of the project is to determine silage physical properties of importance for the horizontal wall pressure and evaluate maximum silage juice level of silos with a wall height of 3 m or more. The data will form a basis for new national design guidelines and a revised Swedish Standard. The ultimate goal is to lower the investment costs for silage bunker silos. A pressure profile was acquired by means of transducers mounted on a “ladder rack” placed vertically along the inside silo wall. The pressure on the transducers was recorded by a data acquisition system displaying static and total load (pressures imposed by silage matter and compacting tractor). The silage juice levels were measured by slotted 16 mm steel pipes placed vertically along the silo walls. The level inside the pipe was determined by a measuring stick. Additionally the juice level could be registered in one of the legs of the “ladder rack”. Silage juice level measurement were carried out during two seasons, all together in 24 silos, while pressure profiles were measured during 10 grass and maize harvests in one season, with approximately 400 pressure profiles at each harvest. The static loads were recorded with no tractor present and total loads as a tractor was passing in front of the transducer racks. The difference between the static and the total load was defined as the dynamic load. Preliminary results show that the silage juice level can vary considerably between harvests within the farm due to weather conditions and geographic location in Sweden. Mean of peak levels was approximately 40...|$|E
40|$|The {{immature}} {{stages of}} the stable fly, Stomoxys calcitrans (L.) and house fly, Musca domestica L., were monitored in ten potential breeding materials found outside cattle feedlot pens. Samples were taken over a three year period. Samples were also taken from piles of grass clippings in urban suburban areas over a two year period. Samples taken along the back fence and along the perimeter of sewage lagoons produced few immature {{stages of the}} house fly or stable fly. Very few stable fly larvae were collected from the silage in bunker silos or haylage. The stable flies were most consistently produced in samples from the runoff ditch. Largest numbers of stable flies were collected in samples from grass clippings, spilled silage, silage {{at the base of}} the <b>bunker</b> <b>silo</b> and spilled silage. The immature stages of the house fly were rarely collected from piled manure and grass. Spilled grain, haylage, and spilled grain produced large numbers of house fly immatures. ^ Although these two species develop in similar habitats, they were collected together in only 3 % of the samples collected. Differences in the physical parameters of the materials and a seasonal separation of the two species may be an explanation. ^ Adult stable flies were monitored during three winters at two, four, and 13 locations with Alsynite fiberglass traps and by examination of the interiors of buildings. No stable flies were found inside buildings during the winter. Adult stable flies were consistently caught on Alsynite traps at one location during two winters and at two other locations during one winter. Distribution and physiological age of these flies indicate that they emerged from pupae that had developed at or near the location where they were captured. Potential breeding sites were examined. A few third instars were found in silage in midwinter, but silage should nor be considered a major source for overwintering stable flies. ...|$|E
40|$|Silage is an {{important}} feed ingredient for dairy cattle. Dairy producers must strive to deliver high quality forage in an economical manner to the cows. The “most economical manner ” may not necessarily mean the lowest cost per ton of silage fed. It refers to {{the economics of the}} silage after accounting for the impact it might have on milk production (income) along with costs associated with producing, harvesting, storing, and feeding the silage. The lowest cost per ton should only be the goal if a milk-production-per-ton-adjustment has been made. The objective {{of this paper is to}} develop a framework for comparing the economics of three different types of silage storage structures.

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the results of}} a study on the possibilities to estimate the density of grass en maize silages for calculation of the fodder stock more accurately than the current table values. During ensiling the amount of crop of 104 grass silage clamps, 42 maize silage clamps and 108 big bales (54 round and 54 square) were weighted and after ensiling the dimensions were measured and the chemical composition was analysed. For round and square bales a new regression formula was derived, which estimates the density more accurate than the current table values. It is recommended to calculate the density of round en square bales with the following formula: Density (kg/m 3) = 994. 81 - 0. 5335 x dry matter content (g/kg) - 1. 196 x crude fibre content (g/kg ds). For grass en maize silage in clamps and <b>bunker</b> <b>silo’s</b> no new model could be derived which estimated the density more accurately than the current table values...|$|R
