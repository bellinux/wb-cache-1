5|$|Heart tissue, {{like all}} {{cells in the}} body, needs to <b>be</b> <b>supplied</b> with oxygen, {{nutrients}} {{and a way of}} removing metabolic wastes. This is achieved by the coronary circulation, which includes arteries, veins, and lymphatic vessels. Blood flow through the coronary vessels occurs in peaks and troughs relating to the heart muscle's relaxation or contraction.|$|E
5|$|Power was to <b>be</b> <b>supplied</b> by {{all three}} engines offered to A330-200 and A330-300 with lower gross weight. Airbus also {{considered}} {{using the new}} Engine Alliance GP7000 engine for the A330-300HGW, {{which would have been}} the engine's first twinjet application. The −300HGW was to enter airline service in 2004. However, the -300HGW programme was not launched and quietly disappeared.|$|E

5|$|Steering may <b>be</b> <b>supplied</b> by a rider or, {{under certain}} circumstances, by the bike itself. This self-stability is {{generated}} {{by a combination of}} several effects that depend on the geometry, mass distribution, and forward speed of the bike. Tires, suspension, steering damping, and frame flex can also influence it, especially in motorcycles.|$|E
5|$|After the two-car draft style {{dominated}} the 2011Budweiser Shootout, NASCAR reduced the front grille opening to 50square inches and the overflow valve for the cooling system would <b>be</b> <b>supplied</b> by NASCAR and set at 33pounds per square inch. Also, high speeds {{in the race}} caused NASCAR {{to reduce the size}} of the restrictor plate by 1/64-inch, with the expectations of cutting 10horsepower from the engines.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively dsRNA can <b>be</b> <b>supplied</b> without genetic engineering. One {{approach}} is to add them to irrigation water. The molecules are absorbed into the plants' vascular system and poison insects feeding on them. Another approach involves spraying dsRNA like a conventional pesticide. This would allow faster adaptation to resistance. Such approaches would require low cost sources of dsRNAs that do not currently exist.|$|E

5|$|Ark Royal and {{the ships}} of Force H {{returned}} to Gibraltar on 29 May 1941. Despite the boost in Allied morale from {{the sinking of}} the battleship Bismarck, the war in the Mediterranean was going against the Allies. Greece and Crete had fallen to the Axis Powers, and the Afrika Korps was preparing to launch a final push into Egypt. Malta remained an important stronghold in the Mediterranean, but was coming under increased pressure from Italian and German air attacks, and could no longer <b>be</b> <b>supplied</b> from the east since the fall of Crete.|$|E
5|$|Bloomsbury {{invested}} £10million in {{an attempt}} to keep the book's contents secure until 21 July, the release date. Arthur Levine, U.S. editor of the Harry Potter series, denied distributing any copies of Deathly Hallows in advance for press review, but two U.S. papers published early reviews anyway. There was speculation that some shops would break the embargo and distribute copies of the book early, as the penalty imposed for previous instalments—that the distributor would not <b>be</b> <b>supplied</b> with any further copies of the series—would no longer be a deterrent.|$|E
5|$|Following a lost {{vote in the}} Scottish Parliament, the SNP-led {{minority}} Scottish Government {{agreed to}} continue the line {{from the airport to}} Leith on condition that no more public money would <b>be</b> <b>supplied.</b> A report by Audit Scotland, commissioned by the Scottish Government, confirmed that the cost projections were sound. The cost of the scheme in 2003 was estimated at £498 million, £375 million in funding from the Scottish Government and £45 million from Edinburgh Council.|$|E

5|$|Helium is commercially {{available}} in either liquid or gaseous form. As a liquid, it can <b>be</b> <b>supplied</b> in small insulated containers called dewars which hold {{as much as}} 1,000 liters of helium, or in large ISO containers which have nominal capacities as large as 42m3 (around 11,000 U.S. gallons). In gaseous form, small quantities of helium are supplied in high-pressure cylinders holding as much as 8m3 (approx. 282 standard cubic feet), while large quantities of high-pressure gas are supplied in tube trailers which have capacities {{of as much as}} 4,860m3 (approx. 172,000 standard cubic feet).|$|E
5|$|Spain's {{worldwide}} {{military activities}} between the 14th and 17th centuries called for {{large numbers of}} horses, more than could <b>be</b> <b>supplied</b> by native Spanish mares. Spanish custom also called for mounted troops to ride stallions, never mares or geldings. Due to these factors, Spanish stallions were crossed with local mares in many countries, adding Spanish bloodlines wherever they went, especially to other European breeds.|$|E
5|$|Surface {{supplied}} divers may <b>be</b> <b>supplied</b> with a {{gas mixture}} suitable for accelerated decompression by connecting a {{supply to the}} surface gas panel and connecting it through the valve system to the divers. This allows accelerated decompression, usually on oxygen, {{which can be used}} to a maximum depth of 20ft (6m) in water for scuba and 30ft (9m) on surface supply. Surface supplied heliox bounce divers will be provided with mixtures suitable for their current depth, and the mixture may be changed several times during descent and ascent from great depths.|$|E

5|$|Ten more {{locomotives}} {{were ordered}} by the SECR from Ashford works in June 1920, and to speed delivery the construction of frames, cylinders and side tanks was subcontracted to the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich. However, further severe delays at Ashford caused by the backlog of repair work meant that the boilers had to <b>be</b> <b>supplied</b> by the North British Locomotive Company. Construction of these locomotives had not begun by 1 January 1923, when the Railways Act 1921 merged the SECR with other railways in southern England to form the Southern Railway.|$|E
5|$|The T48 {{originated}} from an Anglo-American requirement for a self-propelled 6-pounder anti-tank gun. The requirement {{was met by}} emplacing a 57mm gun M1 – the U.S. production version of the British Ordnance QF 6-pounder – {{in the rear of}} an M3 Half-track. The first production batch was ordered in April 1942. The Americans dropped their requirements because of the design of another tank destroyer, the M10. Afterwards, it was intended solely to <b>be</b> <b>supplied</b> overseas {{under the terms of the}} Lend-Lease Program; the T48 was never officially type-classified.|$|E

5|$|The player acts as {{pilot for}} a cargo ship, {{performing}} space runs for various corporations. The ship is a flat platform {{made up of}} hexagonal tiles. The player places weapons and modules on the tiles in order to defend the ship from enemies and hazards. Different structures have varying placement requirements, or may require more than one tile to be placed. For example, most weapons must be placed facing outward into empty space, while some require power to <b>be</b> <b>supplied</b> by an adjacent power source.|$|E
5|$|To {{allow the}} Sa'iqa company to perform its landing, the Port Said Sector was to <b>be</b> <b>supplied</b> 24 assault dinghies. Only ten were {{received}} however, and on October 3, Second Army informed Khalid {{that there were}} no more dinghies available, and {{that he would have to}} improvise. Khalid resorted to renting two fishing boats. Consequently, the Sa'iqa company was tasked with simply isolating the fort; no attack from the east would be carried out.|$|E
5|$|A third band of crusaders reached Nyitra (Nitra, Slovakia) {{and began}} plundering the region. These were soon routed by the locals. A fourth army came to Moson {{in the middle}} of June. Coloman did not allow them to leave the region, either because he had learnt of their {{troublesome}} behavior during their journey, or he had realized that their movement across Hungary could jeopardize the stability of the local economy. To seize food and wine, the crusaders made frequent pillaging raids against the nearby settlements. Coloman decided to attack them, but the commanders of the army convinced him to persuade the crusaders to surrender their weapons and money, promising them that they would <b>be</b> <b>supplied</b> with food during their journey. After the crusaders were disarmed, Coloman's troops attacked and massacred them near Pannonhalma in early July.|$|E
