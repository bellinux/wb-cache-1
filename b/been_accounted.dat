5|$|After a {{bill that}} would have {{provided}} funds to protect the site failed, then-President Lyndon B. Johnson signed an Executive Order that authorized funding for the Army Corps of Engineers to build a levee around the site to protect it from the imminent flooding caused by construction of the Lower Monumental Dam. Late that year, Daugherty left the dig, leaving Fryxell to lead the project. Once the Lower Monumental Dam was closed in February 1969, within three days, the site was completely underwater, due to the seepage of thick layers of gravel that had not <b>been</b> <b>accounted</b> for. However, as the site was being flooded, the excavation team laid down plastic sheeting topped with gravel in the hopes of being able to return to the dig in the future.|$|E
5|$|By 13 January, {{all of the}} French fleet had <b>been</b> <b>accounted</b> for {{except the}} small brig Mutine, which was blown {{all the way to}} Santa Cruz and was {{captured}} there in July, and the 74-gun Droits de l'Homme. Droits de l'Homme had been among the ships under Bouvet in Bantry Bay and then with those that carried on to the Shannon, but as the fleet broke up she became separated. With provisions running low and landings still impossible, Captain Jean-Baptiste Raymond de Lacrosse determined to return to France independently. Progress was slow as Droits de l'Homme was overloaded with 1,300 men, including 800 soldiers under General Jean Humbert. She was further delayed when she encountered and captured a small British privateer named Cumberland. As a result, La Crosse had only reached Ushant by 13 January, where he encountered the same fog that had enabled Révolution and Fraternité to reach safety.|$|E
5|$|The table below {{details the}} {{population}} change since 1801, including the percentage change {{since the last}} census 10 years earlier. Although Trafford was formed as a Metropolitan Borough in 1974, figures have been generated by combining data from the towns, villages, and civil parishes that would later be constituent parts of Trafford. The greatest percentage change in the population occurred between 1851 and 1871, and {{was a result of}} the construction of the Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway in 1849. The decrease by 7.7% in Trafford's population since the 1971 census mirrors the trend for Greater Manchester, although on a smaller scale; this has <b>been</b> <b>accounted</b> for by the decline of Greater Manchester's industries, particularly those in Manchester and Salford but including those in Trafford, and residents leaving to seek new jobs.|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{was inspired by}} students’ readiness to <b>be</b> <b>Accounting</b> teachers with the rapid progress {{of science and technology}} and also free-market for workers. The objective {{of the study was to}} test the influence of Accounting learning based on SAK IFRS and self-efficacy toward students’ readiness to <b>be</b> <b>Accounting</b> teachers. The population of the research <b>were</b> <b>Accounting</b> education students in classess of 2010 until 2012. Thus, it used proportionate stratified random sampling. The respondents were 85 students in class 2010, 123 students in class 2011 and 154 students in class 2012. Then, the data were analyzed by percentage descriptive and doubled linear regression. The result of regression analysis showed that 1) Accounting learning based on SAK IFRS and self-efficacy contibuted positively and significantly for 52. 4 % toward students’ readiness to <b>be</b> <b>Accounting</b> students, 2) there was a positive and significant influence of Accounting learning based on SAK IFRS for 26. 2 % toward students’ readiness to <b>be</b> <b>Accounting</b> teachers, 3) there was a positive and significant influence of self-efficacy for 16. 32 % toward students’ readiness to <b>be</b> <b>Accounting</b> teachers.

Additionally, six Cuban schooners carrying 150 crew members in all sheltered off Anclote Key late on September17 and rode out the storm.

25|$|Due to its {{attraction}} to feces and carrion, S. haemorrhoidalis has <b>been</b> <b>accounted</b> for as a dipteran species that {{may serve as}} a mechanical vector for disease, especially if it intrudes homes. The family Sarcophagidae is particularly attracted to human food and filth. Bacteria can be transferred physically from the fly’s body, legs, or proboscis, to an animal, human food, or open sores. S. haemorrhoidalis has also been found to carry polio virus. During a 1914 polio epidemic, samples of the virus were collected from S. haemorrhoidalis, among other dipterans. The sample was used to infect a monkey with polio, showing that it was an active virus. However, there is still no conclusive evidence {{as to whether or not}} this species actually transmits diseases to humans or animals.|$|E
25|$|By {{the last}} week of December 1796 the fleet was in full retreat, having failed to land a single soldier in Ireland. Several ships were wrecked or foundered in heavy seas, and a British frigate {{squadron}} based at Cork managed to seize a number of lone frigates and transports during {{the first two weeks of}} January. The main British fleet, although ordered to intercept the invasion force, made little progress and did not arrive in the Western Approaches until 13 January, by which time all except three French ships had <b>been</b> <b>accounted</b> for. Two, including the flagship Fraternité, were chased by the British fleet, eventually reaching safety at Rochefort. The third, the ship of the line Droits de l'Homme, was intercepted by two British frigates led by Captain Sir Edward Pellew and destroyed in a running action that cost the lives of over 1,000 Frenchmen.|$|E
25|$|The next {{operation}} for the regiment was in Normandy, France with the 6th Airborne Division. The 8th and 9th Battalions, {{along with the}} 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion, from the (3rd Parachute Brigade) and the 7th, 12th and 13th Battalions of the (5th Parachute Brigade) were involved. The mission was Operation Tonga, capturing bridges over the River Orne and Caen Canal, and destroying the Merville Gun Battery and several other bridges to prevent the Germans reaching the landing beaches. The 7th Battalion had so many missing that, by 03:00, only around 40 percent of the battalion had <b>been</b> <b>accounted</b> for. They did, however, manage to reinforce the glider troops of 2nd Battalion, Oxford and Bucks Light Infantry from the 6th Airlanding Brigade that had captured the Caen and Orne bridges in Operation Deadstick and held them until relieved by the 3rd Infantry Division. The 12th and 13th Battalions also had about 40 percent of their men go missing. The 12th had to capture the village of Le Bas de Ranville, whilst the 13th {{was to take the}} town of Ranville. Both battalions then helped secure the area around the captured bridges until relieved. Only about 150 men of the 9th Battalion had assembled when they launched their assault on the Merville Gun Battery. Their attack on the battery was successful, but with heavy casualties: 50 dead and 25 wounded. The 8th Battalion had to destroy two bridges near Bures and a third by Troarn. All bridges were destroyed and the battalion numbering around 190 men dug in around Troarn. The paras held the left flank of the invasion area until going onto the offensive on the night of 16/17 August. In nine days, they advanced to the mouth of the River Seine, capturing over 1,000 German prisoners. On 27 August, the division was withdrawn from the front line and embarked for England in September. The division's casualties were 821 killed, 2,709 wounded and 927 missing.|$|E
