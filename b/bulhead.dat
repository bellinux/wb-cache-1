50|$|The Crockett is {{substantially}} {{the same as}} she was built. Apart from the installation of a radar unit two deck manholes were added, a <b>bulhead</b> was removed in the engine room, and a stove may {{have been removed from}} the foc'sle. The hold was not used during the Ward family's tenure, as it was considered too smelly. Oysters were stored on deck in baskets, as many as 2200 bushels at a time, with ten to twelve tons of granite ballast below.|$|E
5000|$|The William B. Tennison {{was built}} as a nine-log sailing bugeye, using pitch pine logs, 9 in thick at the keel and {{tapering}} to 6 in at the outer edges. She is 60.5 ft long on deck and has a beam of 17.5 ft with a draft of 4.5 ft.The hullform is flat-bottomed with rounded chines, and is sharp at each end. Framing and planking are built up above the logs for freeboard, using oak frames at approximate 30 in centers. A <b>bulhead</b> separates the foc'sle from the hold. A second blunkhead was added when she was converted to power between the hold and the engine compartment. At {{the same time the}} centerboard trunk was removed. A [...] "patent stern" [...] was added to square the deck above the sharp stern and add working space. A portion of the rudder has been cut away to allow for a propeller.|$|E
40|$|A {{filterable}} agent, designated I 3 p ~ {{was isolated}} from homogenized juvenile oyster tissue inoculated on to bluegill fry (BF- 2) cell cultures. The oysters {{were from a}} hatchery on Long Island Sound, New York. Successive passages resulted in progressive cytopathic effects (c. p. e.) consisting of discrete plaques containing large syncytia seen within 2 to 3 days in cultures held at I 5 °C. The agent was concentrated from supernatant fluids by ultracentrifugation. Negative stained preparations examined by electron microscopy revealed icosahedral particles with a mean diam. of 79 nm. Virus replication in tissue culture occurred at both I 5 and 23 °C. Susceptible fish cells {{in addition to the}} BF- 2 included brown <b>bu!lhead,</b> Atlantic salmon, guppy embryo'and walleye fry lines. Limited c. p. e, occurred in Atlantic salmon heart cells while rainbow trout gonad, rainbow trout spleen and fathead minnow cells were refractory to cytopathic changes. Biochemical nd physical characteristics uggested the 13 P 2 virus belonged to the family Reoviridae. The possibility hat this virus is a known reovirus, present only as a contaminant, was ruled out on the basis of serological results and failure of avian or mammalian cells to support its growth, The I 3 p 2 agent may be an undescribed virus. Further investigations concerning the identity of this virus and its capabilities as a pathogen i fish and shellfish are under way...|$|E
