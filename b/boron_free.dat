Her test solution concentrations were as low as 5 ppm (parts per million). Everyone coming into the glasshouse had first to wash their hands even if they weren't going to handle the plants. [...] By 1923 she had published the proof that boron was essential to the healthy growth of broad beans. [...] Dr Hugh Nicol commented [...] "It is not given to everyone to found a minor industry with her first piece of research, yet this, in effect, happened in her case...the agricultural consumption of boron compounds attained considerable dimension". [...] Warington went on to produce papers on other micronutrients including molybdenum and manganese.Warington also worked with Brenchley on the Rothamsted Classical Experiments: Broadbalk (winter wheat study started 1843) and Park Grass (started 1856), where from 1921 they carried out field surveys of weeds. Warington tested the germination of weed seeds, demonstrating that most species had an optimal germination period during the year.|$|E

Therefore, {{the objective of the}} present investigation is to seek the correlation between CSL fraction and creep resistance of modified 9 Cr– 1 Mo steel (P 91) with and without boron addition. Results showed that CSL fraction increases with increase in heat treatment temperature and this increase is more prominent in boron containing modified 9 Cr– 1 Mo steel. Creep test results show the increase in creep rupture life with increase in CSL fraction for both the base metals; but this increase is more in boron containing steel than the <b>boron</b> <b>free</b> steel.

The results so obtained clearly show that <b>free</b> <b>boron</b> plus <b>free</b> carbon additions lead to the higher densification rates. This favourable behaviour with regards to the densification kinetics is accompanied by the absence of any abnormal grain growth. At the opposite, boron carbide additions do not significantly raise the densification kinetic after SPS treatment of SiC in comparison to pure silicon carbide. In this case, TEM investigations point out the formation of a borosilicate vitreous phase due to the dissolution process of B 4 C in contact with a native superficial silica layer surrounding the SiC grains.

40|$|Abstract The {{effect of}} boron on {{microstructure}} and creep deformation behavior {{has been investigated}} for a tempered martensitic 9 Cr- 3 WVNb steel with emphasis {{on the role of}} <b>boron</b> <b>free</b> from boron nitrides. Creep tests were carried out at 650 o C for up to about 3 x 10 4 h, using specimens of 10 mm in gauge diameter and 50 mm in gauge length.

This stabilizes martensitic microstructure during creep and retards the onset of acceleration creep, resulting in a decrease in minimum creep rate and an increase in creep life.

Polar ligands suitable for use in homogeneous catalysis in aqueous/organic systems were synthesised, as were ligands incorporating a boron atom in an intramolecular Lewis acid-Lewis base interaction with the phosphorus atom. A malonate moiety was readily incorporated into a phosphorus starting material, and derivatives were obtained by reduction of the ester groups. The polar diol products were reacted with 1, 4 -butanesultone which made them water soluble and thus ideal for biphasic catalysis. Wittig chemistry was employed to introduce alkenes of varying electronic nature into a phosphorus-containing aldehyde starting material. The catalysed hydroboration reaction making use of diboron reagents was used to introduce a boron functionality into the resulting a, n-unsaturated ester phosphine I igands. All of the ligands produced were tested in transition metal-catalysed reactions, namely the Heck reaction, the Suzuki reaction, the Stille reaction, the carboxymethylation reaction and the hydroformylation reaction. The polar and water soluble ligands all showed comparable or improved yields to the standard benchmark triphenylphosphine ligand in organic, biphasic and ionic liquid media. The electronic nature of the alkene ligands largely dictated the activities observed in the Heck, Suzuki and Stille reactions. The electron rich ligands showed improved activities in the Heck reaction, while the electron poor ligands showed improved activities in the Suzuki reaction.

Three different polymers were synthesized to complex boron. One was derived from N-meth-yl-D-glucamine (P 1). Two others were derived from iminodipropyleneglycol (P 2 and P 2 G). Operating parameters such as the boron/polymer ratio (0. 01 – 1), pH value (7 – 10), and polymer type (P 1, P 2, and P 2 G) were assessed. An increase of the pH value led to increased boron retention. As well, a decreased loading value enhanced retention. A maximum retention of 90. 1 % exceeded the highest values reported in the literature under similar conditions. The permeate flux remained constant at ≈ 20 L/m 2 h, and operation was unaffected by classic problems such as fouling.

However, none apart from hydrofluoric acid formed chelates with formation constants comparable to those of micronutrient metal chelates like diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA). Moreover, most chelating substances had deleterious side effects which reduced their possible use in water culture: many of the compounds are substrates for bacterial growth, some are harmful to handle, and others are toxic to plants or humans. Borosilicate glass; was tested in a laboratory experiment but found to release boron too slowly into solution to maintain constant boron concentration in solution even when very finely ground. Current investigations centre around the use of a boron-specific resin, which strongly complexes H 3 BO 3 on its N-methyl glucamine functional groups. The boron sorption capacity of the resin varied from 2. 2 to 5. 0 mg B g- 1 resin. Boron saturated resin maintained an equilibrium solution boron concentration of 46 ut M when added at the rate of 2 g of resin to 1 L of <b>boron</b> <b>free</b> triple deionised water. Plants grown in complete nutrient solution with boron saturated resin added at 1 g per litre of nutrient solution grew as well as plants grown in conventional nutrient solution containing 9. 2 ut M boron and their shoots contained adequate boron concentrations for growth. There was no evidence that the resin had effects on plant growth other than in releasing and equilibrating boron concentration in the nutrient solution...|$|E
40|$|Detergent {{formulations}} commonly contain proteases to efficiently remove proteinaceous stains from textiles in {{the washing}} {{process and to}} boost the washing performance. However, nature has evolved enzymes {{for millions of years}} towards the catalysis of specific reactions in distinct natural reaction environments. Therefore an adaptation via protein engineering is required to meet industrial needs. Three major challenges (pH-dependent activity, inhibition and production of proteases) for an efficient implementation of proteases into detergent formulations were investigated in this work. A novel rational design strategy to reengineer the surface charge of Bacillus gibsonii alkaline protease (BgAP) in order to adapt the pH dependent activity and thermal resistance was developed. Out of 113 possible surface amino acids 18 (11 Asn and 7 Gln) residues of BgAP were selected and evaluated based on three proposed selection criteria. Amino acid substitutions meeting all criteria resulted in five out of eight cases in up to 1. 5 -times increased proteolytic activity and a dramatically shifted pH-profile towards higher activity at lower pH (range of 8. 5 - 10. 0). Variant N 253 DQ 256 E showed twice the specific activity of wild type BgAP at pH 8. 5 and its thermal resistance was increased by 2. 4 °C. Furthermore a subtilisin protease was engineered for the first time towards increased inhibition by the <b>boron</b> <b>free</b> inhibitor benzylmalonic acid. Benzylmalonic acid combined with the engineered Bacillus lentus alkaline protease (BLAP) variant V 8 is capable to replace the industrial standard boric acid and derivates from liquid detergent formulations. Computational docking analyses provided molecular explanations for the increased inhibition of BLAP towards benzylmalonic acid. Variant V 8 [S 160 G Q 185 R] was identified after two rounds of directed evolution and showed a ~ 9 times increased inhibition compared to BLAP parent. With the random mutagenesis of vector backbones a further promising application of directed evolution to increase protease production was developed (epMEGAWHOP). The epMEGAWHOP method with subsequent screening for variants with increased protease production offers a rapid and straight forward strategy to increase recombinant protein production levels. In particular a ~ 4 -times increased production of subtilisin Carlsberg with B. subtilis DB 104 was achieved, resulting from a randomly mutated vector backbone library...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2014 The {{elimination}} of soluble boron creates several advantages for Small Modular Reactor (SMR) operation. Most of these advantages are realized through significant core simplification (removal of pipes, pumping, and purification systems), {{the removal of}} the corrosive effects of soluble boron, and from improved safety effects. However, removing soluble boron creates its own set of specific challenges that must be overcome. Traditional pressurized water reactors employ soluble boron for uniform power suppression throughout the core. Thus any boron-free SMR design requires increased dependence on control rods and burnable poisons, where both are discrete neutron absorbers that locally impact the core where they are inserted. Since control rods are partially inserted, their presence negatively impacts the axial power profile and this distortion creates undesirable power peaks, leading to a reduced operating margin and a significant economic burden. Thus, the main challenge in any <b>boron</b> <b>free</b> design concerns excess reactivity suppression and active reactivity control while maintaining a proper axial power profile and reduced power peaks. The goal of the feasibility study is to investigate the physical effects of removing soluble boron, and to investigate and identify an effective strategy for containing power peaks in a boron-free SMR. Studsvik's CASMO- 4 E was employed to solve 2 -D Transport equation for infinite lattice analysis, and SIMULATE- 3 K was employed to solve 3 -D nodal diffusion equation for full core analysis. The study identified improved reactivity feedback mechanisms associated with the removal of soluble boron, arising from a softened neutron flux and a decreased production of plutonium. An analysis of strategies for soluble boron-free operation that involved axially grading burnable poisons and U²³⁵ enrichment percentages was found unable to be able to control the axial power profile throughout core lifetime. The inherent limitations in the lifetime of burnable poisons resulted in an inability to control the axial power profile through middle and end of cycle. Investigations of additional strategies involving an advanced control rod algorithm produced significantly improved results that met the prescribed criteria for success. The advanced control rod algorithm is thus recognized as a viable strategy for boron-free operation for SMRs...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} direct current field on a powder-packed {{boriding}} process on a {{martensitic stainless steel}} AISI 420 have been investigated at a temperature of 900 ◦C for about 2 − 6 hr. A powder-packed boriding process without direct current field (conventional powder-packed boriding process, PB) is a reference {{as compared to the}} powder-packed boriding process with applied current densities (PB-DC) of 60 - 170 mA/cm 2. The microstructure and the presence of boride layers of PB and PB-DC were characterized using optical microscope and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The hardness values of the boride layer were measured by Vickers microhardness tester. Experimental results show that the direct current filed can enhance the decomposition and chemical reaction in the boriding agent and also drive active <b>free</b> <b>boron</b> ions as well as atoms to diffuse toward the cathode. Therefore, a boron concentration around the specimen at the cathode of PB-DC is higher than that at the anode as well as PB (as a reference). As a consequence, higher boride layer thickness of PB-DC was detected. The double-phase boride layer (FeB and Fe 2 B) on borided martensitic stainless steel AISI 420 was found both PB and PB-DC. The hardness of the boride layer of about 1800 − 2000 HV can be observed...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} a {{considerable}} debate {{about the nature of}} the short range atomic order in vitreous B 2 O 3. Some authorities state that it is not possible to build a model of glassy boron oxide of the correct density containing a large number of six-membered rings which also fits experimental diffraction data, but recent computer simulations appear to overrule that view. To discover which view is correct I use empirical potential structure refinement (EPSR) on existing neutron and x-ray diffraction data to build two models of vitreous B 2 O 3. One of these consists only of single boron and oxygen atoms arranged in a network to reproduce the diffraction data as close as possible. This model has less than 10 % of boron atoms in boroxol rings. The second is made up of an equimolar mixture of B 3 O 3 hexagonal ring "molecules"and BO 3 triangular molecules, with no <b>free</b> <b>boron</b> or oxygen atoms. This second model therefore has 75 % of the boron atoms in boroxol rings. It is found that both models give closely similar diffraction patterns, suggesting the diffraction data in this case are not sensitive to the number of boroxol rings present in the structure. This reinforces recent Raman, ab initio, and NMR claims that the percentage of boroxol rings in this material may be as high as 75 %. The findings of this study probably explain why some interpretations based on different simulation techniques only find a small fraction of boroxol rings. The results also highlight the power of EPSR to extract accurate atomistic representations of amorphous structures, provided adequate supplementary data (such as Raman and NMR in this case) are available...|$|R
40|$|The {{reactions}} of <b>boron</b> halides with <b>free</b> base porphyrins under conditions where partial hydrolysis of the boron halides can occur give diboron porphyrin complexes containing BOB moieties {{in which each}} boron is bonded to two porphyrin nitrogen atoms. BF₃·OEt₂ with H₂(por) gives B₂OF₂(por) (por = tpp, ttp, tpClpp, oep) which has an asymmetric structure in which one boron lies in the porphyrin plane (Bip) while the other lies above it (Boop). BCl₃·MeCN with H₂(por) gives B₂O₂(BCl₃) ₂(por) which contains a four-membered B₂O₂ ring and is stable only {{in the presence of}} excess BCl₃. BBr₃ with Li₂(tpClpp) gives the dicationic complex [B₂O(tpClpp) ]²⁺ as its [BBr₄]⁻ salt, and is the first example of a boron porphyrin containing three-coordinate boron to be structurally characterised. B₂O₂(BCl₃) ₂(por) can be chromatographed on basic alumina to give the hydroxyboron complex B₂O(OH) ₂(por), which is deduced from its NMR spectra and DFT calculations to have a structure analogous to B₂OF₂(por). The OH protons are shifted upfield to near δ - 4 (Boop-OH) and - 10 (Bip-OH) by the diamagnetic porphyrin ring current. The reaction of either B₂O₂(BCl₃) ₂(por) or B₂O(OH) ₂(por) (por = ttp, tpClpp) with alcohols (ROH, R = Et, 4 -C₆H₄CH₃) gives B₂O(OR) ₂(por), which can in turn be converted to B₂O(OR) (OH) (por) by repeated chromatography. The reaction of PhBCl₂ with H₂(por) (por = ttp, tpClpp) gives B₂O(Ph) (OH) (por) which has been characterised by spectroscopy in concert with DFT calculations. It is a further example of the B₂OF₂(por) structural type, in which the phenyl group is coordinated to the out-of-plane boron and the OH group to the in-plane boron, as are its derivatives B₂O(Ph) (X) (tpClpp) (X = F, OEt).
