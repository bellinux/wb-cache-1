40|$|Secondary forests have {{recently}} reached a notable importance {{in terms of}} extension, increasing the forest area in central Europe, and opening new questions about their management. In the Italian pre-Alpine region ash-lime and ash-sycamore forests cover more than 150. 000 hectares. Usually these new forests occupy private lands abandoned after agricultural practices. These forests are generally left to natural evolution or managed as coppice for firewood production. To address possible uses of ash timber from secondary forests, we carried out a physical and mechanical characterization on logs from two study areas in north-eastern Italy. The timber characteristics of two ash stands, aged 37 and 60 years, have been obtained analysing 35 plant stems. We calculated wood density at 12 % moisture content, wood basic density, radial and tangential shrinkage, the ratio between tangential and radial shrinkage and module of rupture and module of elasticity. Presence of <b>black</b> <b>heart</b> was estimated <b>in</b> the transverse area on each tested sample. Results show that timber obtained from the two studied stands present good mechanic and physic properties suitable for saw-timber and veneer uses. The high presences of <b>black</b> <b>heart,</b> especially <b>in</b> the older stand, modify wood physical properties and undervalue strongly the timber for aesthetical applications. A different forestry approach {{has been applied to}} obtain trunks of commercial dimension in shorter rotation (< 70 years), reducing in this way the incidence of <b>black</b> <b>heart.</b> Single tree oriented silviculture could be an interesting management able to increase diametric growth and to produce trunks of 60 cm in less of 70 years, decreasing the presence of <b>black</b> <b>heart</b> <b>in</b> the stems...|$|R

The book {{is set in a}} slightly altered historical England—during the reign of King James III—in the early 19th century, and follows the adventures of Simon, an orphan whose plans to study painting in London are derailed by high adventure. Aiken was inspired to create an atmosphere of important events having already transpired offstage (which was helped by the fact that {{a great deal of the}} beginning had to be left out due to length), and also included an involved [...] "Dickensian plot" [...] which she believed to complement the habit many children have of rereading or having a book reread to them.|$|R

The album received fairly positive reviews, as they sighted it was fairly fresh, catchy, and fun, {{with a mix of}} sounds from [...] "garage rock" [...] to [...] "murky grunge...that has a lot in common with Soundgarden or early Pearl Jam." [...] Lewis described the album as [...] "good old fashioned rock n' roll", and later stated that they [...] "didn't take much risks recording the album". Led by lead single [...] "Beautiful Night" [...] (which charted at #24 on Billboard Mainstream Rock Charts) and follow-up single [...] "Shadow", the band received national recognition, touring with bands like Velvet Revolver, Papa Roach and Finger Eleven.|$|R
60|$|Fortune showed itself strangely {{favourable}} to {{the plans}} of Nahoon and Nanea. One of the Zulu captain's perplexities was {{as to how}} he should lull the suspicions and evade the vigilance of his own companions, who together with himself had been detailed by the king to assist Hadden in his hunting and to guard against his escape. As it chanced, however, {{on the day after}} the incident of the visit of Maputa, a messenger arrived from no less a person than the great military Induna, Tvingwayo ka Marolo, who afterwards commanded the Zulu army at Isandhlwana, ordering these men to return to their regiment, the Umcityu Corps, which was to be placed upon full war footing. Accordingly Nahoon sent them, saying that he himself would follow with <b>Black</b> <b>Heart</b> <b>in</b> the course of a few days, as at present the white man was not sufficiently recovered from his hurts to allow of his travelling fast and far. So the soldiers went, doubting nothing.|$|R

40|$|Radishes with <b>black</b> <b>hearts</b> {{will lose}} edible value and cause food safety problems, {{so it is}} {{important}} to detect and remove the defective ones before processing and consumption. A hyperspectral transmittance imaging system with 420 wavelengths was developed to capture images from white radishes. A successive-projections algorithm (SPA) was applied with 10 wavelengths selected to distinguish defective radishes with <b>black</b> <b>hearts</b> from normal samples. Pearson linear correlation coefficients were calculated to further refine the set of wavelengths with 4 wavelengths determined. Four chemometric classifiers were developed for classification of normal and defective radishes, using 420, 10 and 4 wavelengths as input variables. The overall classifying accuracy based on the four classifiers were 95. 6 %– 100 %. The highest classification with 100 % was obtained with a back propagation artificial neural network (BPANN) for both calibration and prediction using 420 and 10 wavelengths. Overall accuracies of 98. 4 % and 97. 8 % were obtained for calibration and prediction, respectively, with Fisher's linear discriminant analysis (FLDA) based on 4 wavelengths, and was better than the other three classifiers. This indicated that the developed hyperspectral transmittance imaging was suitable for <b>black</b> <b>heart</b> detection <b>in</b> white radishes with the optimal wavelengths, which has potential for fast on-line discrimination before food processing or reaching storage shelves...|$|R
