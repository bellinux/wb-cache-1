Other elements used as pigments include antimony, arsenic, beryllium, calcium, lithium, selenium, and sulphur.|$|E
30|$|The {{presence}} of barium and absence {{of lead in}} these samples is notable. It suggests that Bauer likely used <b>barium</b> <b>white</b> (barium sulphate, barytes, blanc fixe, constant white, permanent white) {{as a replacement for}} lead white or as a transparent extender for his coloured pigments. Rejected by oil painters due to its lack of opacity in oil, <b>barium</b> <b>white</b> found favour with watercolourists {{in the late eighteenth century}} [24]. It is notable that James Sowerby, the London engraver who printed Bauer’s paintings for the published Flora Graeca lists it in his book on colours in 1809 [39]. Indeed, the use of <b>barium</b> <b>white</b> remain almost entirely limited to watercolour until the 1820 s, when it began to be used as an adulterant in the production of lead white [40]. Harley [24] notes that <b>barium</b> <b>white</b> was first described as an artists’ pigment by Scheele in 1775, although it was certainly in use sporadically since the sixteenth century.|$|E
30|$|In this project, fifteen pigment {{samples taken}} from the wall {{painting}} on the pilgrimage-corridor at the Jokhang Monastery in Tibet were analyzed using Raman spectroscopy, XRF, PLM, and SEM-EDS. The results show that azurite, malachite, red lead, cinnabar, mars red, orpiment, gold, calcite, magnesium carbonate, <b>barium</b> <b>white,</b> especially modern synthetic Ultramarine blue, emerald green, chrome yellow and lithopone were applied as single or mixture pigments.|$|E
50|$|Barium {{hydroxide}} are {{chemical compounds}} with the chemical formula Ba(OH)2(H2O)x. The monohydrate (x =1) {{is known as}} baryta, or baryta-water, {{it is one of}} the principal compounds of <b>barium.</b> This <b>white</b> granular monohydrate is the usual commercial form.|$|R
30|$|The {{reference}} set {{was based}} on readily available paints from other studies containing mixtures {{of different types of}} titanium white, titanium white mixed with zinc <b>white,</b> <b>barium</b> sulfate or calcium carbonate [16, 18], as well as combinations of single-pigment layers (unpublished study). The dataset was extended with several crucial samples including layer combinations and mixtures with lead white and a calibration set for the Ba-L/Ti-K deconvolution. The reference samples were painted either on Melinex or on modern prepared canvas board and attached with double-sided tape to a Perspex board for pXRF analysis to limit background detection.|$|R
40|$|The {{spectral}} reflectance {{of snow in}} the range of 0. 60 to 2. 50 microns wavelengths was studied in a cold laboratory using natural snow and simulated preparations of snow. A <b>white</b> <b>barium</b> sulfate powder was used as the standard for comparison. The high reflectance (usually nearly 100 %) of fresh natural snow in visible wavelengths declines rapidly at wavelengths longer than the visible, as the spectral absorption coefficients of ice increase. Aging snow becomes only somewhat less reflective than fresh snow in the visible region and usually retains a reflectance greater than 80 %. In the near infrared, aging snow tends to become considerably less reflective than fresh snow...|$|R
30|$|Knowledge about {{pigments}} {{applied in}} ancient wall paintings {{is of great}} importance in art conservation and art history. In this study, fifteen pigment samples from the wall painting on the pilgrimage-corridor at the Jokhang Monastery in Lhasa, Tibet were analyzed, using different techniques, including X-ray fluorescence (XRF), Raman microspectroscopy (Raman), polarized light microscopy (PLM), and scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (SEM-EDS). It is found that azurite, malachite, red lead, cinnabar, mars red, orpiment, gold, calcite, magnesium carbonate, <b>barium</b> <b>white,</b> especially modern synthetic Ultramarine blue, emerald green, chrome yellow and lithopone were used as colorants on plaster. This result suggests that the wall painting may have been executed after the 1850 s, mostly in about the 1900 s.|$|E
30|$|While both zinc and barium {{are both}} present in white paint layers, the barium exists as large {{discrete}} particles {{and not as}} an intimate co-precipitate with the zinc, {{as would be expected}} for the presence of lithopone, which is ZnS co-precipitated with BaSO 4 rather than ZnO. Furthermore, the Raman spectra collected in the white paint layers do not show evidence of lithopone peaks. <b>Barium</b> <b>white</b> has Raman bands at 453, 461, 616, 647, and 988  cm− 1. Zinc white has Raman bands at 331, 383, and 438  cm− 1. Lithopone has bands at 216, 276, and 342  cm− 1 that were not observed in the white paint spectra. As a result, both from a morphological and spectroscopic perspective, lithopone is not present in the white paints of The Blue Room.|$|E
3000|$|White Pigments Chalk (White Lime), White {{lead and}} Zinc White. Chalk {{is one of}} the forms of calcium {{carbonate}} (CaCO 3). It has been extensively used in paintings. Chalk is found with limestone deposits and has been used as pigment from very early times. In India, conch shell white was favoured by artists and is believed to have special properties. White lead (PbCO 3) is a complex salt containing both carbonate and hydroxide. It was formerly used as an ingredient in lead paint. It occurs in nature as the mineral Cerussite. However, normally white lead is prepared artificially. Zinc white (ZnO) (Safeda in Hindi) is another important pigment used in painting. Archaeological evidence dates back to the use of zinc white as pigments in India before it was introduced in Europe. Other white pigments are Talc, <b>Barium</b> <b>White</b> and Titanium White. Titanium White is titanium dioxide (TiO 2), used in textiles as delustrants.|$|E
50|$|Both ISO 13803 and ASTM E430 method B {{require a}} {{separate}} measurement of luminous reﬂectance, Y, to calculate compensated haze.

Luminous reflectance measurements, Y, are required on both the sample material and a reference white; ISO 13803 details the use of a BaSO4 standard - <b>Barium</b> sulphate, a <b>white</b> crystalline solid having a white opaque appearance and high density as this material is a good substitute for a perfectly reflecting diffusor as defined under ISO 7724-2.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{presents a}} new semi-automatic model for converting raw AggieAir™ footprints in visible and near-infrared (NIR) bands into reflectance images. AggieAir, a new {{unmanned aerial vehicle}} (UAV) platform, is flown autonomously using pre-programmed flight plans at low altitudes to limit atmospheric effects. The UAV acquires high-resolution, multispectral images and has a flight duration of about 30 minutes. The sensors on board are twin cameras with duplicate settings and automatic mode disabled. A <b>white</b> <b>Barium</b> Sulfate (BaSO 4) panel is used for reflectance calibration and in situ irradiance measurements. The spatial resolution of the imagery is 25 cm; the radiometric resolution is 8 -bit. The raw images are mosaicked and orthorectified and the model converts their digital numbers (DN) to reflectance values. Imagery, acquired around local solar noon over wetlands on the Great Salt Lake, Utah, is used to illustrate the results. The model generates high quality images {{and the results are}} good. The reflectance values of vegetation in the NIR, Green and Red bands extracted at the test locations are consistent. The image processing, reflectance calculations, accuracy issues, with the proposed method are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Objective The {{dimensions}} and relationships of the periodontal structures are vital in various dental specialties. Paper describes a simple, novel, noninvasive and a promising technique which illustrates and validates {{the possibility of}} radiographically visualizing and metrically assessing oral hard and soft tissues of the periodontium. Materials and Methods A total of 14 periodontally healthy, dentate subjects with no severe crowding, rotation, or spacing in the maxilla, and no history of palatal disease or surgery participated in this study. Maxillary impression of the patient made using additional polyvinyl impression material. Maxillary CBCT images of the patients with the barium incorporated denture base in place were obtained using Carestream CS 3 D 9300 C machine with the FOV of 5 X 10 cm at 90 Kvp, 6. 3 mA, scanning time 8 secs and angle of rotation 270 degrees. Analysis was done using CS 3 D Dental Imaging Software. Results A strong correlation in the measurements of thickness of the palatal masticatory mucosa by both methods (r= 0. 90; p< 0. 01). Mean palatal masticatory mucosa thickness was 2. 74 mm (range: 2. 0 to 6. 03 mm) on CBCT and on physical measurements it {{was found to be}} 2. 6 mm (range: 2. 0 to 5. 03 mm). Conclusion <b>Barium</b> sulphate dry, <b>white,</b> chalky powder, appears white (radio-opaque) on the X-ray film. Its applications in medicine include barium meal a diagnostic test used to detect abnormalities of the esophagus, stomach and small bowel using X-ray imaging.

40|$|This {{case study}} {{illustrates}} the analytical characterization of 12 academic nude paintings by Veloso Salgado, made between 1883 and 1893. The study {{was done with}} in situ methods (infrared reflectography and EDXRF) and benchtop equipment (Raman and FTIR microscopes and SEM-EDS). Infrared reflectography revealed underdrawings, painting style, execution method and retouched/restored areas. Analytical techniques allowed the identification of gypsum, lead white, <b>barium</b> <b>white,</b> zinc white, yellow ochre, chrome yellow, zinc yellow, vermilion, synthetic ultramarine blue, cerulean blue, Prussian blue, viridian, green earth, Paris green, red ochre, raw umber and lamp black. These results provide valuable information on Salgado’s palette and his artistic production technique and allow the distinction between palettes used in Lisbon and Paris and consequently, technical interchanges between both Academies. Finally, this study intends to start a systematic analytical study of the Faculty of Fine Arts’ collection, allowing the characterization of many other authors and their influences {{for the development of}} painting methodology in this Academy...|$|E
30|$|It {{is worth}} noting that among the various {{commercial}} names used for these three naphthol compounds, many contain the term ‘scarlet’, as reported in the Colour Index [11]. Sukaretto, the Japanese transliteration of ‘scarlet’, has been attested in an article published in 1890 on the newspaper Yomiuri shinbun, in which the author laments the drop in the quality of woodblock printing caused by the introduction of the new synthetic colorants [34]. In 1894 the same word is recorded by Koizumi Eijirō, who describes it as “a red dye made of naphthol (nafusōru), with truly many varieties, of which here are a few with their names and chemical formulas” [35]. Naphthol reds were also very common inks in the early phases of chromolithography (ca. 1890 – 1920) [36 – 38]. In lithographic inks the colorant is usually mixed with a ‘varnish’ and several additives to improve the overall quality of the material. The strong fluorescent background which characterizes the Raman spectra of the naphthol reds collected from the prints, {{as can be seen in}} Fig.  5 A-a and B-a, could be ascribed to the intrinsic complexity of the ink mixture [32, 36, 37]. Furthermore, the consistent detection of Ba in the XRF analysis in the area where naphthol red was detected by micro-Raman points to the use of <b>barium</b> <b>white</b> (BaSO 4), a common ingredient of lithographic inks as an extender or as a substrate of the lake pigment, as attested in the past [37]. Barium is most likely to be present as BaSO 4, used as extender, since the high sensitivity to water of the red areas points toward the use of the material as a free colorant instead of the lake pigment. The presence of the Raman peak of barite, at around 987  cm− 1, in some prints seems to confirm this hypothesis. Since <b>barium</b> <b>white</b> is an inexpensive pigment and produces inferior extenders, it was sometime used in cheaper grades of ink. It was also used in gloss white, a 25 % alumina hydrate— 75 % BaSO 4 mixture, which produces a semi-opaque extender [36].|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the analytical characterisation {{of a series}} of paintings authored by Giorgio Marini (1836 - 1905) from the Museum of Évora. Marini was an Italian painter who lived in Portugal in the 19 th century. He was a very prolific painter and his works, most of them portraits commissioned by urban and rural bourgeois and noble elites, are dispersed all over the country. The general good conservation state of most paintings prevented the collection of micro-samples for detailed study. Hence, material identification of the painting materials was performed primarily by XRF, given its non-destructive and non-invasive nature, and it was complemented when possible by auxiliary techniques optical microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and SEM-EDX. Pigments and fillers such as yellow and red ochre, lead white, zinc white, <b>barium</b> <b>white,</b> chrome yellow and green chrome are among the identified pigments. This is the first time the palette used by Giorgio Marini was identified, helping to characterised the pigments used by foreign painters during the 19 th century in Portuga...|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} this study was {{analytical}} investigations of Egyptian paintings, mainly Coptic icons and Islamic wooden ceilings, dating from 1300 - 1900 using multiinstrumental techniques. Twenty three Coptic icons and three wooden ceilings dated from different periods and painted by different painters in case of icons were examined. The materials used including pigments, media, varnishes, ground layers and gold layers. The surface stratigraphy of paint samples, their layered structured and the composition of materials used in each layer were analysed. Variations in painting techniques, pigments palettes, paint media and varnishes applied in Egyptian paintings according to painters, time and type of paintings were revealed. A total of twenty-eight organic and inorganic pigments were identified in this study, of which nine have never been previously included {{as a part of the}} Egyptian pigment palettes, namely; smalt, lapis lazuli, indigo, pararealgar, Prussian blue, chrome yellow, barium yellow, <b>barium</b> <b>white</b> and hydromagnesite. The identification of hydromagnesite, which has never been to date considered as a pigment either in Egypt or elsewhere and the identification of smalt from the mid- 14 th century, whose reported earliest large scale use was in the 16 th century. Two types of resins were identified as a constituent of the oil/resin varnish applied on Coptic icons of which Venice turpentine has been identified for the first time as an ingredient of Egyptian varnishes. The identification of mosaic gold in an 18 th C. icon, a novel usage of dammar resin and the multilayered structure of the white ground layers were revealed.

40|$|U tekstu se donose rezultati istraživanja provedenih tijekom konzervator-sko-restauratorskih radova na dosad neobjavljenoj kopiji znamenite slike Paola Vero-nesea Otmica Europeiz Duždeve palače u Veneciji. Slika se danas čuva u Povijesnom i pomorskom muzeju Hrvatskog primorja u Rijeci, no muzejski inventari bilježe da potječe iz zbirke baruna Georga Hütterotta koja je bila smještena na otoku Sv. Andrije kod Rovinja. Multidisciplinarnost tima kemičara-analitičara, povjesničara umjetnosti i konzervatora-restauratora omogućila je pouzdanije odgovore na pitanja o tehnologiji i vremenu nastanke slike, odnosu kopije prema izvorniku i drugim kopijama iz 18. i 19. stoljeća te optimalan odabir restauratorskih postupaka i materijala. The paper brings forth {{results of}} a {{multidisciplinary}} research {{carried out in the}} course of conservation work on a copy of the painting by Paolo Veronese, The Rape of Europafrom the Doge’s Palace in Venice. The as yet unpublished copy is nowadays kept at the Maritime and History Museum of the Croatian Littoral in Rijeka. Mu-seum inventory books, however, reveal that it originated from the collection of Baron Georg Hütterottt, which used to be housed on the islet of St. Andrew, just off Rovinj. Laboratory investigations of the painting were carried out as part of the conservation procedure, aimed at exa-mining the chemical composition of the materials used, identifying the pigments and determining the sequence of paint coats in the painted layer of the original, as well as the relation of a subsequently added and painted piece of canvas {{to the rest of the}} composition. The information obtained was most valuable in establishing the time-frame from when the painting had originated to when its format was enlarged. We were able to identify: gypsum and traces of chalk in the preparation, lead white, <b>barium</b> <b>white,</b> Prussian blue and red ochre as well as dark earth pigments in the painted layers. A description is given of the laboratory, analytical methods: microanalysis of the chemical compounds using a scanning electron micros-cope, SEM/EDS and FT-IR micro-spectroscopy. By corre-lating the visual characteristics of the copy from Rijeka with the information on the pigments used, obtained by laboratory analyses, it was possible to date the paintingfrom the end of the 19 th to the first decades of the 19 th century, to the time when Veronese’s original was returned from Paris, reviving the public’s interest in this renowned piece of the Venetian cinquecentoart. The enlarging of the right-hand portion of the composition, albeit later in date and inferior in execution, followed soon after the painting had originated. The added portion was now folded and preserved, using a specially constructed stretcher frame, but only the original copy of the composition was presen-ted, matching the Veronese’s original. The multidisciplinary character of the team, made up of analytical chemists, art historians and conservators, pro-vided us with more reliable answers as to the technology and dating of the painting, the relation of the copy to the original and other 18 th- and 19 th-century copies, as well as the most favourable choice of conservation procedures and materials. The copy from Rijeka was put in the context of European artistic practice of repeating and citing notable paintings, and questions were raised as to the relation between the original, the copy and the facsimile, which is an ongoing issue to this day...|$|E
