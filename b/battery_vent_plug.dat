Injection molding part {{which is used}} in battery for the venting purpose is modeled and analyzed to determine the parting surface, gating systems. Injection molding parts conduct mold flow analysis to determine the feasibility, and the die gating system and the injection molding process are optimized. Thus, high projection quality products are obtained. To permeate this, the use of Computer aided design (CAD) and Computer aided engineering (CAE) application assisted in design and establish the most optimal parting surface and gating system. This research was conducted by implementing the use of CAD/CAE tools to produce an optimal mold design using Pro/E and Moldflow ® applications.

Only by applying force with his knee was he able to get the latch to lock, but he noticed that the <b>vent</b> <b>plug</b> (see below) was not entirely closed.

50|$|New {{designs are}} drawn using 3D cad software. From the 3D design, {{two-dimensional}} flat sections are created {{to become the}} precision-cut frames (internal Rib-like structures perpendicular to the mid-line from nose to tail) and keel (known as stringer in a foam surfboard). Then bookmatched wood is selected that blends {{together to form a}} unique pattern on the deck and bottom of the board. The keel and frames are then drilled with holes to further reduce the weight. The constructed frames and keel define the overall shape and size of the board. The installation of fins and fin-boxes (for removable fins) is aided by a builder's laser to ensure that fins are placed, canted and toed-in symmetrically. The hollow and watertight nature of these boards require the installation of a <b>vent</b> <b>plug</b> to equalize internal and external pressure that changes due to temperature variation and to changes in atmospheric pressure which, without the vent, would cause air pressure inside the board to increase.|$|R

40|$|Two {{incidents}} {{concerning the}} contamination of copper-conductor surfaces associated with uninterruptible power systems (UPS) were recently observed. Valve-regulated lead/acid (VRLA) batteries {{used in the}} UPSs for backup powering were diagnosed as a possible source of the contamination. One of the VRLA batteries from the UPS unit was subjected to overcharge in the laboratory, to simulate the incident. Overcharge currents greater than 10 A, coupled with battery temperatures over 60 degrees C, can cause a VRLA battery to release significant amounts of hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide. Under extreme conditions, hazardous levels of hydrogen sulfide could be generated. We conclude that the contamination was due to copper sulfide, Cu 2 S, and copper oxide, Cu 2 O, formed on copper surfaces {{as a consequence of}} hydrogen sulfide evolution and the high humidity inside the UPS enclosure resulting from <b>battery</b> <b>venting...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} shear rate during {{membrane}} fabrication {{on the performance}} of membrane-assisted lead acid battery has been investigated. The application of lead acid battery normally faces the problem of water decomposition. This phenomenon is due to the factor of charge-discharge reaction in the battery and heat accumulation caused by hot tropical climate and heat generated from engine compartment. Gas separation membranes were prepared through dry-wet phase inversion method using various polysulfone concentrations and different shear rates.

40|$|At mature andesitic volcanoes, magma {{can reach}} the surface through the same path for several eruptions thus forming a {{volcanic}} conduit. Because of degassing, cooling, and crystallization, magma viscosity increase in {{the upper part of}} the conduit may induce the formation of a viscous plug. We conducted numerical simulations to quantify the deformation field caused by this plug emplacement and evolution. Stress continuity between Newtonian magma flow and elastic crust is considered. Plug emplacement causes a ground inflation correlated to a decrease of the magma discharge rate. A parametric study shows that surface displacements depend on three dimensionless numbers: the conduit aspect ratio (radius/length), the length ratio between the plug and the conduit, and the viscosity contrast between the plug and the magma column. Larger displacements are obtained for high-viscosity plugs emplaced in large aspect ratio conduits. We find that only tiltmeters or GPS located close to the vent (a few hundred meters) might record the plug emplacement. At immediate proximity of the <b>vent,</b> <b>plug</b> emplacement might even dominate the deformation signal over dome growth or magma reservoir pressurization effects. For given plug thicknesses and viscosity profiles, our model explains well the amplitude of tilt variations (from 1 to 25 mu rad) measured at Montserrat and Mt. St. Helens. We also demonstrate that at Montserrat, even if most of the tilt signal is due to shear stress induced by magma flow, pressurization beneath the plug accounts for 20 % of the signal...|$|R
40|$|In {{the absence}} of stress-concentrating flaws such as microfractures, {{vesicular}} glassy materials can withstand gas pressures within vesicles in excess of 100 MPa; however, vesicles within such materials are known to decrepitate explosively at much lower internal gas pressures, both in natural systems and in the laboratory. Here we present a model that quantitatively predicts the generation of microfractures in vesicle walls during cooling. Cooling of gas-bearing vesicles in glassy rock has little effect on water solubility in the glass, but leads to a rapid decrease in gas pressure in the vesicles. The drop in pressure causes disequilibrium between {{the water in the}} glass and in the vesicle. Dehydration of the glass in a diffusive boundary layer around the vesicle leads to elastic shrinkage. The resulting strain generates large tensile tangential stresses which can exceed the strength of the glass, causing microfracturing. Such microfractures present a possible means by which glassy rock surrounding vesicles could be weakened enough to permit explosive decrepitation at low pore vapor pressures. The results have implications wherever hydrous vesicular glasses are formed. For example rocks formed in shallow subvolcanic intrusions or <b>vent</b> <b>plugs</b> may spontaneously disintegrate with explosive emission of vapor; glassy submarine lavas spontaneously decrepitate upon dredging from the ocean floor (''popping rock''); vesicular glasses produced in laboratory experiments investigating vapor-melt phase equilibria have been observed to contain abundant fractures surrounding vesicles and to dehydrate at anomalously high rates...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} carried out to develop a Maintenance Free Tropicalized Lead Acid Battery enhanced by membrane technology, to overcome problems such as lost of electrolyte, spilt of battery acid onto the battery compartment, and other associated enviamential problems. Asymmetric gas separation membranes were fabricated using polysulfone polymer and solvent. Polymer and solvent concentration were varied with the range of 9. 5 % to 30 % and 90. 5 % to 70 % respectively. The produced membranes were then incorporated into the Lead Acid <b>Battery</b> <b>vent</b> holes that have been designed in this study. Results showed that when the battery was charged at 13. 2 V (2. 2 V per cell) over period of 168 hours at 26 oC ± 2 oC the electrolyte losses is indistinctive, but with charging rate at 14. 4 V (used by Proton Car) the loss of electrolyte is fall below permitable level with the same parameter. Heat simulation test was concurrently carried out at temperature of 26 oC ± 2 oC over period of 168 hours without charging, the electrolyte loss was undistinguished but when the battery was simulated under hot bath condition at 82 oC ± 2 oC the loss is 1. 6 kg over the initial weight of 12. 8 kg...|$|R

50|$|The {{cargo door}} design flaw, and the {{consequences}} of a resulting in-flight decompression, had been noted by Convair engineer Dan Applegate in a 1972 memo. The memo was written after American Airlines Flight 96, another DC-10 experienced a rear cargo door failure identical to the one that occurred on Flight 981, also causing an explosive decompression. Fortunately, even though the pilot's ability to control Flight 96 was compromised by some severed underfloor cables in the blown-out section of the plane, they were able to land in Detroit without further injuries. The NTSB's investigation into Flight 96 determined that baggage handlers forced the locking handle closed, and the latches did not engaged fully because of an electrical problem. The incident investigators discovered that the rod connecting the pins to the handle was weak enough that it could be bent with repeated operation and force, allowing the baggage handler to close the handle with his knee even when the pins interfered with the torque tube flanges. The <b>vent</b> <b>plug</b> and cockpit light were operated by the handle or the locking pins, not the latches, so when the handle was stowed, both of these warning devices indicated that the door was properly closed. In the case of Flight 96, the plane was able to make a safe emergency landing because not all of the underfloor cables were severed, thus allowing the pilots limited control. This greatly contrasted with Flight 981, where all of the underfloor cables were severed in the decompression and the pilots lost complete control of the plane.|$|R
50|$|Volcanic {{activity}} {{also played}} a role in the formation of the range. Eruptions of lava formed volcanic cones whose <b>vents</b> were eventually <b>plugged</b> with hardening magma. These hardened cores are called volcanic plugs. In the case of the Mandara Mountains, the plugs were much more erosion-resistant than the exterior of the cones, which wore away over time. Eventually, only the plugs remained, forming the stark, needle-like spires such as Kapsiki Peak that the range is known for.|$|R

Circular hills with steep sides are also frequent in this area, which are probably the remains of small <b>plugged</b> <b>vents.</b> However, as the remaining mountain is roughly symmetrical, most of the activity must have occurred at the central plug.|$|R
40|$|Several {{thousand}} 55 -gallon drums of residue {{material from}} past plutonium processing operations are being stored at the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site (RFETS). This stored material awaits stabilization, packaging for shipment to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant for disposal, or packaging for shipment to other DOE sites for processing. Each of these drums is {{fitted with a}} vent filter to prevent accumulation of hydrogen or other flammable gases. A filter-monitoring program was developed to assure that these vent filters continue to function properly. Nuclear Filter Technology Model 012 and 013 filters {{are being used to}} vent the drums. A simple filter test device has been developed at RFETS for monitoring these vent filters. This test device consists of a cup that sits over the filter and seals to the drum lid, a pressure gauge, a flow meter, and a hand pump. If the flow rate through the filter at 1 -inch water column is less than 35 ml/min, the filter is considered plugged, and the filter is changed. During its first year, the vent-monitoring program has led to discovery of 14 <b>plugged</b> <b>vent</b> filters. These <b>plugged</b> filters were found on drums containing dry combustibles, wet combustibles, and Ful Flo filters.

50|$|This {{sedimentary}} deposition {{was followed}} by a period of volcanic eruptions which produced a series of basaltic lavas, some of which are now found near Kelso. The summit rocks of Rubers Law were formed within a volcanic vent. There is a small area of volcanic agglomerate, formed in the vent by an explosive eruption of magma from the volcano. The rest of the summit rocks are microgabbro (previously known as dolerite), the remains of a volcanic plug formed from magma which solidified within the <b>vent.</b> Another microgabbro <b>plug</b> is located among the trees of Denholmhill Wood, 2 km north of the summit.|$|R
40|$|Thermally {{activated}} batteries use an epoxy for encapsulation of {{the electrical}} feedthroughs in the header of the battery. When the thermal battery is thermally abused, the encapsulant can pyrolyze and generate large internal pressures. This causes the <b>battery</b> to <b>vent</b> in extreme cases. The {{nature of these}} gases has never been adequately documented. Therefore, a study was undertaken to address this deficiency. The pyrolysis of various encapsulants that have been used, or are being considered for use, in thermally activated batteries was studied over a temperature range of 155 to 455 C. The composition of the pyrolysis decomposition products was determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GS/MS). This determination is helpful in assessing the potential environmental and health effect for personnel exposed to such gases.

50|$|Alternately if moving sink to {{an island}} sink, install the P-trap below {{the floor of the}} island and vent {{off the top of the}} drain. Attach toward the trap and reverse 180 degrees so any water in the vent flows down the drain. Slope drain down, slope vent up, and attach to {{existing}} vent from previous existing fixture that is now abandoned. Patch previously existing drain to become vent. In Canada, the national plumbing code requires that the minimum trap arm be at least 2 times the pipe diameter, (e.g. 1.25 inch pipe needs a 2.5-inch trap arm, 1.5 pipe needs a 3-inch trap arm etc.) and that the vent pipe be one size larger than the drain that it serves, also a cleanout is required on both the vent and the drain. The reason for this is in the event of a plugged sink, the waste water will back up and go down the <b>vent,</b> possibly <b>plugging</b> the <b>vent</b> (as it is under the countertop), and a clean-out would permit the cleaning of the pipes.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Four {{trials were}} {{conducted}} to determine whether conventional solid or elevated wire mesh floor-ing, during transport and holding of broilers prior to slaughter, influenced the number of bacteria recovered from feathered and defeathered carcasses. After 4 h off feed, 7 -wk-old broilers were placed at commercial density into a modified commercial transport dump-coop on ei-ther fiberglass sheeting or 2. 54 × 2. 54 cm wire mesh floor-ing that allowed feces to fall through. Broilers were trans-ported for 1 h and then held for 13 h under a covered shed before processing. Broilers were killed by electrocu-tion, and the <b>vents</b> were <b>plugged</b> to prevent escape of feces. External carcass rinses were obtained twice (from the same carcass) from eight broilers per flooring treat-ment per trial, before scalding and defeathering and again after defeathering and removal {{of the head and}} feet.

40|$|Strombolian eruptions are {{characterized}} by low-energy explosive activity, which may repeat, at fairly regular intervals, {{for long periods of}} time. Explosions at the vent are thought to result from the arrival of discrete slugs of magmatic gas that have risen through the magmatic plumbing system. We develop a one dimensional, analytical model of gas slug rise in a volcanic conduit which we use to investigate the controls on the dynamics of Strombolian eruptions. We consider a partially-filled, cylindrical conduit containing degassed magma, that is initially in magma-static equilibrium with a constant pressure magma reservoir at depth. We introduce a slug of gas {{at the base of the}} conduit and consider the temporal evolution of the pressure distribution in the conduit, and the motion of the magma above and below the slug, as the slug rises, decompresses, and expands isothermally. We validate our model against published data for gas slugs rising and decompressing in a vertical pipe [James et al., 2008, Geological Society of London, Special Publications 307, 147 - 167] by imposing the condition of zero magma-flux at the base of the conduit, and constant pressure at the top; we find excellent agreement. If we impose the more geologically-sound condition of constant pressure at the base of the conduit, we can consider two scenarios of volcanological relevance: 1) <b>Vent</b> <b>plugged</b> with cooler, more-viscous magma. In this case, as the slug rises and expands beneath the plug, it pushes the degassed magma below it down the conduit, consequently, magma re-enters the chamber from the base of the conduit. The slug reaches the viscous plug at the top of the conduit with a significant over-pressure; this may be sufficient to disrupt the plug, causing a Strombolian explosion, or the gas may percolate away. Fresh magma then moves up from the chamber, into the conduit to restore magma-static equilibrium. 2) Open vent. As the slug rises and expands, the volume of magma held in the falling-film that encircles the slug increases. Since this film is supported viscously by the conduit walls, it does not contribute to the magma-static pressure at the base of the conduit which, therefore, decreases, causing fresh magma to flow upwards. Fresh magma entering the base of the conduit may cause a new slug to form, either through decompression and exsolution, or by tapping a gas-rich layer at an asperity, or at the chamber roof. In either case, scenario 1 (<b>plugged</b> <b>vent)</b> will lead to periodic, Strombolian eruption, whilst scenario 2 (open vent) will lead to sustained eruption at higher discharge rate. A noteworthy feature of the model is that the conduit is recharged with fresh magma following slug rise, even if no magma is erupted at the surface. We apply our model to the case of Stromboli, and compare model output with monitoring observations. We find that the most important parameters controlling eruption style and vigour are magma viscosity, mass of gas in the slug, and the ratio of slug radius to conduit radius. Our findings potentially impact the dangerous transition from ‘touristic’ Strombolian activity to more-hazardous paroxysmal activity...|$|R
