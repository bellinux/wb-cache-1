We also consider the case of a finite Negative Binomial mixture and a finite Pareto mixture updating the posterior mean.

40|$|The use of <b>bonus-malus</b> <b>systems</b> in {{compulsory}} liability {{automobile insurance}} is a worldwide applied method for premium pricing. If certain assumptions hold, like the conditional Poisson {{distribution of the}} policyholders claim number, then an interesting task is to evaluate the so called claims frequency of the individuals. Here we introduce 3 techniques, two {{is based on the}} bonus-malus class, and the third based on claims history. The article is devoted to choose the method, which fits to the frequency parameters the best for certain input parameters. For measuring the goodness-of-fit we will use scores, similar to better known divergence measures. The detailed method is also suitable to compare <b>bonus-malus</b> <b>systems</b> in the sense that how much information they contain about drivers...|$|R

2500|$|Since 2008 France has a <b>bonus-malus</b> <b>system</b> {{offering}} a financial incentive, or bonus, {{for the purchase}} of cars with low carbon emissions, and a fee, or malus, {{for the purchase of}} high-emission vehicles.

The malus penalty applies to all vehicles registered after 1 January 2008, and is added at the time of registration.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} <b>bonus-malus</b> <b>systems</b> with {{different}} claim types and varying deductibles. The premium relativities are softened for the policyholders {{who are in}} the malus zone and these policyholders are subject to per claim deductibles depending on their levels in the bonus-malus scale and the types of the reported claims. We introduce such <b>bonus-malus</b> <b>systems</b> and study their basic properties. In particular, we investigate when it is possible to introduce varying deductibles, what restrictions we have and how we can do this. Moreover, we deal with the special case where varying deductibles are applied to the claims reported by policyholders occupying the highest level in the bonus-malus scale and consider two allocation principles for the deductibles. Finally, numerical illustrations are presented. Comment: Published at [URL] in the Modern Stochastics: Theory and Applications ([URL] by VTeX ([URL]...|$|R

50|$|Bonus {{usually is}} a {{discount}} in the premium which is given on {{the renewal of}} the policy if no claim {{is made in the}} previous year. Malus is an increase in the premium if there is a claim in the previous year. <b>Bonus-malus</b> <b>systems</b> are very common in vehicle insurance.

50|$|There {{is a basic}} {{question}} under <b>Bonus-malus</b> <b>system</b> based on insurance customer’s point of view, that is, “Should an insurance customer carry an incurred loss himself, or should he make a claim to the insurance company?”. Hence, an insurance customer prefers to choose self-financing an occurred loss by carrying a small loss himself {{in order to avoid}} an increased future premium, instead of financing the loss by compensation from the insurance company. This strategy is called bonus hunger of the insurance customer. In this strategy, the insurance customer prefers the most profitable financial alternative, after a loss occurrence. A well-designed <b>bonus-malus</b> <b>system</b> must take bonus hunger into consideration.|$|E

50|$|The only measure {{actually}} {{implemented in}} 2008 was the <b>bonus-malus</b> <b>system</b> on new vehicles, establishing penalties for purchasers {{of the most}} polluting vehicles and instead introducing a bonus for the least polluting cars.

It is common practice for airlines and aircraft ground handling to have contracts based on a <b>bonus-malus</b> <b>system,</b> penalising the causative agent for delays caused. Delay code properties cover nine category sets for delay. Each category set can be described using either a two digit number code or a two letter alpha code; most airlines use the numeric format but some prefer the alpha.

40|$|Abstract: In this {{communication}} we {{show how}} the generalized Poisson Pascal (G. P. P.) distribution may {{be a very good}} choice when trying to model claim counts. This is a very critical step in the modeling process of an experience rating scheme such as <b>Bonus-Malus</b> <b>Systems</b> (BMS), for any conclusion will depend on this early choice. Neither parametric models like the negative binomial or Poisson mixed by Inverse Gaussian, nor nonparametric ones like the good risk-bad risk model are enough to model real world. The application of the G. P. P. may be of a great help when trying to model claim counts with a high skewness, as was indicated in Panjer, Willmot (1992) and Klugman, Panjer, Willmot (1998). The difficulty to overcome when using it is the numerical handling of stable distributions...|$|R

This paper examines the evolution of market shares and claim frequencies in a two-company market, when one insurer breaks off the existing stability by introducing a super-discount class in its BMS. Several assumptions concerning policyholders and insurers behavior are tested. Diffusion theory is used to model the spread of the information concerning the new BMS among prospective customers. A wide variety of market outcomes results: one company may take over the market or the two may survive with equal or unequal market shares, each specializing in a specific niche of the market. Before engaging in an aggressive competitive behavior, insurers should consequently be reasonably confident in their assumptions concerning the reactions of their policyholders to the new BMS...|$|R
