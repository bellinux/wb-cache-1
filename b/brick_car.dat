5000|$|The {{workshops}} had a main carshed, with tracks {{leading into}} it {{at both the}} east (Richmond) and west (Flinders Street) ends. The <b>brick</b> <b>car</b> shed was 109 metres wide, 122 to 183 metres long depending of the section, and {{was designed to be}} expanded to a uniform width of 305 metres. The car shed was divided into three separate sections: ...|$|E
50|$|The Rensselaer and Saratoga Railroad: Green Island Shops {{were two}} {{historic}} buildings and one historic structure located at Green Island, Albany County, New York. The buildings {{were built in}} 1871 by the Rensselaer and Saratoga Railroad. They are: the three-story, five-bay, <b>brick</b> <b>car</b> shop building measuring approximately 100 by 300 ft; the one-story, semicircular, brick roundhouse; and the 40 ft octagonal water tower. The shops remained in operation into the late 1930s.|$|E
5000|$|Ordered by Spreckles, with {{guidance}} by William Clayton, {{and design}} by Homer MacNutt and Abel A. Butterworth, 24 Arts & Crafts style streetcars (to {{be known as}} the 'Class 1' streetcar) are delivered to San Diego in 1912. The following year, construction of a new <b>brick</b> <b>car</b> barn located at Adams Avenue and Florida Street is completed.

25|$|Violence {{continued}} in Over-the-Rhine and Downtown {{for the next}} three days. Rioters threw <b>bricks</b> through <b>car</b> windows, targeted and beat white motorists, smashed storefronts and looted businesses, set dozens of fires throughout the city, shot at police, and more. Main Street was targeted by rioters, according to some of the businesses there. Of those who were arrested for rioting, 70% were not residents of Over-the-Rhine, and 86% were African-American males. The total cost of damage to the city was at least $13.7 million.|$|R
50|$|The Train Stations {{was built}} by Rhodes, Curry and Co. of Amherst, Nova Scotia, which was a {{significant}} business in the industrial, commercial, and architectural history of Nova Scotia. It {{had a reputation for}} quality of workmanship and craftsmanship, and was instrumental in the commercial development and expansion of Nova Scotia’s turn-of-the-century economy. The company, which also made <b>bricks,</b> rail <b>cars,</b> and doors and sashes, was the contractor and builder of a number of grand homes and business {{in the late nineteenth and}} early twentieth century.|$|R
50|$|The <b>brick</b> home {{features}} <b>car</b> shelters on {{the front}} and side, a modern detail during the 1910s. In addition to the home, a wash house, smokehouse, garage, and four entrance pillars are located on the property. According to family tradition, Sunnyside was used as a hospital during the Spanish flu epidemic of 1918.|$|R
5000|$|There are two {{principal}} depot {{buildings in the}} district. The [...] "Camden Depot" [...] stands on John Street, and the [...] "Tower Depot", now {{little more than a}} pair of crenellated towers, stands on Mary Street. These two buildings were completed in 1850, and in the area between, two warehouses were built in the following decade. The depots and one of the warehouses are architecturally distinguished by their Gothic Revival features, which are not frequently found on railroad infrastructure. The Tower Depot, which was the railroad's original passenger depot, was only used until 1853, when a through depot was built near Line Street. In 1857 the large <b>brick</b> Italianate <b>car</b> shop was built adjacent to the main railroad line just north of Line Street.|$|R
50|$|Rioters {{attacked}} LaPota's {{liquor store}} first. After police arrived with firefighters with high pressure hoses, the rioters shifted focus to attack passing motorists. They threw rocks, bottles, stones, and <b>bricks,</b> breaking <b>car</b> windows and windshields, and hurting drivers and passengers. State police fired small arms {{over their heads}} as they advanced on the rioters. Authorities called to the scene 225 police officers from local, county, and state departments. Sheriff Richard B. Ogilvie, future Governor of Illinois, instructed police to broadcast over loudspeakers: “If you shoot, we’re going to fire back.” According to Ogilvie, the riot began around 8 p.m. and was over by 2 a.m. 1000 people {{were involved in the}} protest and riot. 37 people were injured, and 25 people were arrested and booked at the Harvey, Illinois police station.|$|R

5000|$|His {{masterpiece}} is the Ellis County Courthouse in Waxahachie, {{which has}} become the icon of the town-square, late Victorian Era genre. The massive building tapers to 134 feet {{at the peak of}} the central clock tower, atop a vast roof punctuated by dormers. It took two million <b>bricks,</b> [...] "160 <b>car</b> loads of Texas granite, 100 car loads of Pecos red sand stone, used in trimming the building, and 14 cars of iron". The pyramidal mass is softened by decorations such as carved faces of people and animals (apparently by the accomplished artisan Harry Herley) as well as multi-colored stones and bricks, and metal eagles perched on spirelets above the roof.|$|R

50|$|Nathan refuses {{point blank}} to accept Declan's offer so he sets {{about finding a}} new buyer. After a few weeks, he finally finds a buyer and celebrates in The Woolpack by {{drinking}} {{a glass of champagne}} with barmaid Alicia Gallagher (Natalie Anderson), Leyla's sister. Ryan tries to start an argument with Nathan and after he insults Alicia, Nathan defends her and squares up to Ryan. Ryan leaves the pub and throws a <b>brick</b> through Nathan's <b>car</b> window. Nathan then attacks Ryan and Maisie is forced to separate them. Alicia then leaves after Leyla and Davids tell her what Nathan is really like. The buyer comes to look at Home Farm, and then subsequently reduces her offer. Nathan is furious and refuses to accept, but after Maisie begs him to reconsider, he does so and signs the paperwork. When he introduces the buyer to Declan, he is outraged to discover that he has been tricked when it is revealed that the buyer is Declan's ex-wife Ella Hart (Corrinne Wicks). Nathan refuses to let Declan have Home Farm but knows that he is unable to do anything as the deeds have been signed over.|$|R
40|$|Measured {{insertion}} losses due to {{the ground}} effects associated with low configurations of loosely stacked household <b>bricks</b> on a <b>car</b> park are reported. A particularly successful design has {{the form of a}} two brick high square lattice which is found to offer a similar insertion loss to regularly-spaced parallel wall arrays of the same height but twice the total width. Part of the insertion loss {{due to the}} roughness configurations is the result of transfer of incident sound energy to surface waves which can be reduced by introducing wall absorption or material absorption in the form, for example, of shallow gravel layer. Predicted finite length effects have been explored using a Pseudo-Spectral Time Domain Method, which models the complete 3 D roughness profile. It is concluded from measurements and predictions that the lattice design has less dependence on azimuthal source-receiver angle than parallel wall configurations. These predictions are supported by measurements of level difference spectra as a function of azimuthal angle. A 2 D Boundary Element Method gives predictions that agree well with data for parallel wall arrays up to 16 m long and it is used to investigate the potential insertion loss of longer configurations up to 0. 3 m high. It has been found possible also to make predictions of the insertion loss due to infinitely long 3 D lattices using the 2 D BEM with the lattice represented by the surface impedance derived from fitting short range data with a slit-pore impedance model. The insertion losses of recessed configurations are predicted to be approximately 3 dB less than those of embossed configurations of the same size. Outdoor experiments also show that pathways can be made through such roughness configurations without significantly affecting their insertion loss. It is concluded that artificial roughness configurations could achieve substantial noise reduction along surface transport corridors without breaking line of sight between source and receiver, thereby proving useful alternatives to noise barriers...|$|R
50|$|Jane cannot {{deal with}} her guilt as she watches Carol fall apart over Max's arrest, and begins helping her by aiding her look for a {{solicitor}} and helping her search for Cora, who has been missing for months. Jane tells Carol she knows that Max did not kill Lucy, leading to Carol becoming suspicious. Jane is adamant that {{she is going to}} confess to Carol that Bobby killed Lucy, however Ian persuades her not to. After Bobby attempts to throw a <b>brick</b> through Max's <b>car</b> windscreen, Cindy shouts at him at home, leading to him pushing her over; she lands where Jane found Lucy dead {{on the night of the}} murder. When Abi and Carol find Cora, Jane decides she will tell Carol that Bobby killed Lucy, but when Cora says she saw Abi and Max cleaning Lucy's blood off the car lot floor after she died, Abi admits that Max and Lucy argued there and that the evidence is stacked strongly against Max. Back at the Beale household, Cindy—believing that Ian and Jane have told Carol and Abi the truth—tells her boyfriend and Carol's grandson Liam Butcher (James Forde) that Bobby killed Lucy. Cindy learns that Ian and Jane did not tell Carol, and Ian persuades Liam not to reveal the secret, arranging for Cindy and Liam to move to Devon permanently. Cindy and Liam decide not to leave Walford, and Liam attempts to call the police on Bobby, but Ian states that he and Cindy could go to prison for perverting the course of justice. Liam blackmails Ian and Jane into giving him £100,000 to leave permanently, saying he will go to Germany to live with his father, but Liam eventually agrees to leave without payment. Jane tells Ian that she intends for all the Beales to move away from Walford, but instead, Liam and Cindy leave together without Jane and the others.|$|R
