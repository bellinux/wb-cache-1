5|$|Initially most Luftwaffe fighter wings {{consisted}} of three groups (Gruppe), which were the equivalent of USAAF groups or RAF Wings. Groups were identified using Roman numerals, followed by the unit number; e.g. I./JG 1. In 1942 JG 1 was the first unit to <b>be</b> <b>expanded</b> to incorporate a fourth group. Partly {{as a result of}} JG 1's expansion, other Luftwaffe fighter wings incorporated a fourth group from mid-1943.|$|E

5|$|The {{facility}} features architecture {{intended to}} evoke {{a sense of}} calm. It was constructed with a central courtyard {{and a number of}} windows overlooking it, as well as nature-related artwork and architecture. There are also separate hallways for staff and visitors {{in order to make the}} interior appear less crowded. The hospital also features a substantial amount of parking and a shuttle service to the entrance. Miami Valley Hospital South was constructed with future expansion in mind. Two of the five floors in the patient wing are empty and can be filled adding 24 beds each. A third hallway can be added to the wing which will add 60 beds, and the maternity ward can also <b>be</b> <b>expanded</b> with a second floor to add 12 beds, which means the facility could <b>be</b> <b>expanded</b> to 180 beds.|$|E
5|$|Brenton came up {{with the}} idea to show an episode dealing with a Muslim hero set out to stop a group of Islamic terrorists. Brenton and the {{producers}} researched elements of Islam in order to provide a balanced view towards the religion, as well as the nature of the plot and to show Muslims in the episode who oppose the extremists among their religion. Although much of the episode was set in Birmingham, it was filmed entirely in London. The episode sees the introduction of regular character Ruth Evershed (Nicola Walker), and the return of Christine Dale (Megan Dodds), who first appeared in the first episode and returned so that the character's role can <b>be</b> <b>expanded.</b>|$|E
5|$|Each of the valid Band1 {{permutations}} can <b>be</b> <b>expanded</b> (completed) into {{a specific}} number of solutions with the Band2,3 permutations. By {{virtue of their}} similarity, each member of an equivalence class {{will have the same}} number of completions. Consequently, we only need to construct the solutions for one member of each equivalence class and then multiply the number of solutions {{by the size of the}} equivalence class. We are still left with the task of identifying and calculating the size of each equivalence class. Further progress requires the dexterous application of computational techniques to catalogue (classify and count) the permutations into equivalence classes.|$|E
50|$|List and Execute {{forms of}} XDAP are supported, whereby a {{prototype}} form, called the List Form, <b>is</b> <b>expanded</b> as data, and a functional form, called the Execute Form, <b>is</b> <b>expanded</b> as instructions.

The use of List and Execute Forms facilitates the development of re-enterable programs.|$|R

5|$|Group 3 is a {{group of}} {{elements}} in the periodic table. This group, like other d-block groups, should contain four elements, but it is not agreed what elements belong in the group. Scandium (Sc) and yttrium (Y) are always included, but the other two spaces are usually occupied by lanthanum (La) and actinium (Ac), or by lutetium (Lu) and lawrencium (Lr); less frequently, it is considered the group should <b>be</b> <b>expanded</b> to 32 elements (with all the lanthanides and actinides included) or contracted to contain only scandium and yttrium. When the group is understood to contain all of the lanthanides, its trivial name is the rare-earth metals.|$|E
5|$|Highway 82 {{was now a}} four-lane road all the {{way from}} Glenwood Springs to Aspen. But that traffic still had to narrow to two lanes to cross the Maroon Creek Bridge at the latter city's western boundary. The old bridge, listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1985, was {{functionally}} obsolete and structurally deficient. Cracks and other damage were forcing temporary closures of the bridge to trucks. Over 100 years old by that point, the oldest bridge in use on a Colorado highway, it could not <b>be</b> <b>expanded</b> any further.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to {{problems with the}} terminal building, both the airport's location and surrounding infrastructure were {{the subject of much}} complaint as well. For one, although some 1,700 cars visited the airport daily, the parking lot had only 129 slots, and could not <b>be</b> <b>expanded</b> any further. The airport complex likewise was located directly alongside major city thoroughfares, in particular the city's main highway, the Tomas Confesor Highway, which complicated the flow of traffic in and around the area. At one point, the ATO, which was already having difficulty managing vehicular traffic around the airport, proposed banning cargo and delivery trucks from passing through the road in front of the terminal building. However, the city government did not respond.|$|E

5|$|On February 8, 2013, NBC {{announced}} that the episode would <b>be</b> <b>expanded</b> to fill a one-hour television block, although it still counts as one official episode. The episode received largely positive reviews, although many were critical of the episode's extended length, which they argued felt padded. The episode was viewed by 4.06 million viewers and received a 2/6 percent rating among adults {{between the ages of}} 18 and 49. The episode ranked third in its timeslot, and it was the highest-rated NBC series of the night.|$|E
5|$|River otter, beaver, nutria, mink, weasel, red fox, deer, elk, coyotes, raccoons, {{and rabbits}} {{make up a}} portion of the {{terrestrial}} animals. Other wildlife includes painted turtles, frogs, salamanders, crawfish, fish, and alligator lizards. The refuge is one of only ten national wildlife refuges in the United States located in an urban area. Groups have suggested that the refuge <b>be</b> <b>expanded</b> {{all the way to the}} Willamette River to provide a greenway through a heavily populated area. The Tualatin's floodplain is the largest of any of the Willamette River’s tributaries.|$|E
5|$|Since the College of Cardinals {{is a small}} body, {{there have}} been {{proposals}} that the electorate should <b>be</b> <b>expanded.</b> Proposed reforms include a plan to replace the College of Cardinals as the electoral body with the Synod of Bishops, which includes many more members. Under present procedure, however, the Synod may only meet when called by the pope. Universi Dominici gregis explicitly provides that even if a synod or an ecumenical council is in session {{at the time of}} a pope's death, it may not perform the election. Upon the pope's death, either body's proceedings are suspended, to be resumed only upon the order of the new pope.|$|E
