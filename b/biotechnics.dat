5000|$|It {{is true that}} Mumford's writing {{privileges}} {{the term}} [...] "biotechnics" [...] more than the [...] "biotechnic society." [...] The reason is clear in the last sentence of The Pentagon of Power where he writes, [...] "for {{those of us who}} have thrown off the myth of the machine, the next move is ours: for the gates of the technocratic prison will open automatically, despite their rusty ancient hinges, as soon as we choose to walk out." [...] Mumford believed that the <b>biotechnic</b> society was a desideratum—one that should guide his contemporaries as they walked out the doors of their megatechnic confines (he also calls them [...] "coffins"). Thus he ends his narrative, as he well understood, at the beginning of another one: the possible revolution that gives rise to a <b>biotechnic</b> society, a quiet revolution, for Mumford, one that would arise from the <b>biotechnic</b> consciousness and actions of individuals. Mumford was an avid reader of Alfred North Whitehead's philosophy of the organism.|$|R

5000|$|Most of the dyes {{commonly}} used in microscopy are available as BSC-certified stains.

These standards are published in the Commission's journal <b>Biotechnic</b> & Histochemistry. Many dyes are inconsistent in composition from one supplier to another. The use of BSC-certified stains eliminates a source of unexpected results.|$|R
5000|$|Mumford {{used the}} term <b>biotechnics</b> in the later {{sections}} of The Pentagon of Power, written in 1970. The term sits well alongside his early characterization of [...] "organic humanism," [...] in that <b>biotechnics</b> represent the concrete form of technique that appeals to an organic humanist. When Mumford described <b>biotechnics,</b> automotive and industrial pollution had become dominant technological concerns, along with the fear of nuclear annihilation. Mumford recognized, however, that technology had even earlier produced a plethora of hazards, {{and that it would}} do so into the future. For Mumford, human hazards are rooted in a power-oriented technology that does not adequately respect and accommodate the essential nature of humanity. Effectively, Mumford is stating, as others would later state explicitly, that contemporary human life, understood in its ecological sense, is out of balance, because the technical parts of its ecology (guns, bombs, cars, drugs) have spiralled out of control, driven by forces peculiar to them rather than constrained by the needs of the species that created them. He believed that <b>biotechnics</b> was the emerging answer, then, the only hope that could be set out against the problem of megatechnics, an answer that, he believed, was already beginning to assert itself in his time.|$|E

5000|$|The Biological Stain Commission is an {{organization}} certifying scientific stains. The BSC is a 94-year-old organization well known to many thousands of scientists, worldwide but especially in N America, who buy certified dyes for staining of microscopic preparations or for making up selective culture media for bacteria. Manufacturers and other vendors submit samples from their batches of dyes to the BSC's independent laboratory in Rochester NY. The BSC's certification label on a bottle of dye indicates that the contents are from a batch that passed the tests for chemical purity and for efficacy as a biological stain. These tests are published (Penney et al. 2002a). Changes to tests and additions {{to the list of}} stains eligible for certification are published {{from time to time in}} <b>Biotechnic</b> & Histochemistry and are summarized on the Commission's web site.|$|R
50|$|In Mumford's understanding, {{the various}} {{technologies}} that {{arose in the}} megatechnic context have brought unintended and harmful side effects along with the obvious benefits they have bequeathed to us. He points out, for example, {{that the development of}} money (as a technology) created, as a side effect, a context for irrational accumulation of excess because it eliminated the burdensome aspects of object-wealth by making wealth abstract. In those eras when wealth was not abstract, plenitude had functioned as the organizing principle around its acquisition (i.e., wealth, measured in grains, lands, animals, to the point that one is satisfied, but not saddled with it). Money, which allows wealth to be conceived as pure quantity instead of quality, is an example of megatechnics, one which can spiral out of control. If Mumford is right in this conceptualization, historians and economists should be able to trace a relationship between the still-increasing abstraction of wealth and radical transformations with respect to wealth's distribution and role. And, indeed, it does appear that, alongside its many benefits, the movement toward electronic money has stimulated forms of economic stress and exploitation not yet fully understood and not yet come to their conclusion. A technology for distributing resources that was less given to abstract hoarding would be more suitable to a <b>biotechnic</b> conception of living.|$|R
5000|$|Mumford {{was deeply}} {{concerned}} with the relationship between technics and bioviability. The latter term, not used by Mumford, characterizes an area's capability to support life up through its levels of complexity. Before the advent of technology, most areas of the planet were bioviable at some level or other; however, where certain forms of technology advance rapidly, bioviability decreases dramatically. Slag heaps, poisoned waters, parking lots, and concrete cities, for example, are extremely limited {{in terms of their}} bioviability, illustrated in the somewhat startling 1943 novel title A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, and non-bioviable regions are common to cinema in the form of dystopias (e.g., Bladerunner). Mumford did not believe it was necessary for bioviability to collapse as technics advanced, however, because he held it was possible to create technologies that functioned in an ecologically responsible manner, and he called that sort of technology <b>biotechnics.</b> Mumford believed that biotechnic consciousness (and possibly even community) was emerging as a later stage in the evolution of Darwinian thinking about the nature of human life. He believed this was the sort of technics needed to shake off the suicidal drive of [...] "megatechnics." [...] While Mumford recognized an ecological consciousness that traces back to the earliest communities, he regarded emerging <b>biotechnics</b> as a product of neo-Darwinian consciousness, as a post-industrial form of thinking, one that refuses to look away from the mutually-influencing relationship between the state of the living organism and the state of its environment. In Mumford's mind, the society organized around <b>biotechnics</b> would restrain its technology for the sake of that integral relationship.|$|E

5000|$|The {{genesis of}} Shantha <b>Biotechnics,</b> Ltd. {{can be traced}} back to the {{initiatives}} of Dr.K.I.Varaprasad Reddy and Khalil Ahmed. Varaprasad and Ahmed established the company in 1993 to produce cost-effective drugs to reach the common man at an affordable price, while maintaining International standards in quality. [...] The project originated as an R&D outfit at the Osmania University under the industry-university interactive programme in 1993, and later operated out of the Center for Cellular and Molecular Biology until an independent R&D facility was built.|$|E

Later {{in the same year}} Indian vaccine manufacturer Shantha <b>Biotechnics</b> was acquired for $784 million In October Sanofi-Aventis announced that it would lay off about 1,700 US employees (about 25% of its US workforce) due to restructuring triggered by growing generic competition and other factors, and that the company would focus its US operations on diabetes, atrial fibrillation and oncology.|$|E
5000|$|Alongside the {{limiting}} effect of satisfaction amidst plenitude, {{the pursuit of}} technological advance would also be limited by its potentially negative effects upon the organism. Thus, in a biotechnic society, the quality of air, the quality of food, the quality of water, these would all be significant concerns that could limit any technological ambitions threatening to them. The anticipated negative value of noise, radiation, smog, noxious chemicals, and other technical by-products would significantly constrain {{the introduction of new}} technical innovation. In Mumford's words, a biotechnic society would direct itself toward [...] "qualitative richness, amplitude, spaciousness, and freedom from quantitative pressures and crowding. Self-regulation, self-correction, and self-propulsion are as much an integral property of organisms as nutrition, reproduction, growth, and repair." [...] The biotechnic society would pursue balance, wholeness, and completeness; and this is what those individuals in pursuit of <b>biotechnics</b> would do as well.|$|E
30|$|CdS NPs were {{synthesized}} by the sonochemical method using a sonochemical bath at room temperature. The {{procedure for}} {{the preparation of}} CdS NPs is as follows. 0.1  M cadmium acetate was mixed with 0.1  M sodium sulfide and {{an equal amount of}} tryptophan was used as the chelating agent. The chelating agent concentration {{plays an important role in}} controlling the size of NPs. After mixing all the three constituents in the conical flask, it was kept in a sonochemical bath (ultrasonic power 50  Watts, model no. 1.5 L 50 H, <b>Biotechnics,</b> India) at room temperature. Different concentrations of tryptophan, viz., (a) 0.1  M, (b) 0.2  M and (c) 0.3  M were used. Then the individual solutions were exposed to ultrasound irradiation for 60  min. After the irradiation, the yellow color suspension that formed was centrifuged to get the precipitate out and washed several times with double-distilled water and ethanol to remove the unreacted reagents. Finally, the product was dried in an oven at 80  °C for 6  h and analyzed further.|$|E
40|$|Background: Although the World Health Organization had {{recommended}} {{that every child}} be vaccinated for Hepatitis B by the early 1980 s, large multinational pharmaceutical companies held monopolies on the recombinant Hepatitis B vaccine. At a price as high as USD$ 23 a dose, most Indians families could not afford vaccination. Shantha <b>Biotechnics,</b> a pioneering Indian biotechnology company founded in 1993, saw an unmet need domestically, and developed novel processes for manufacturing Hepatitis B vaccine to reduce prices to less than $ 1 /dose. Further expansion enabled low-cost mass vaccination globally through organizations such as UNICEF. In 2009, Shantha sold over 120 million doses of vaccines. The company was recently acquired by Sanofi-Aventis at a valuation of USD$ 784 million. Methods: The case study and grounded research method was used to illustrate how the globalization of healthcare R&D is enabling private sector companies such as Shantha to address access to essential medicines. Sources including interviews, literature analysis, and on-site observations were combined to conduct a robust examination of Shantha’s evolution as a major provider of vaccines for global health indications. Results: Shantha’s ability to become a significant global vaccine manufacturer and achieve international valuation and market success {{appears to have been}} made possible by focusing first on the local health needs of India.

40|$|This work {{examines}} {{the relation between}} the natural and the artificial, and between living and technics, in the philosophy of Gilbert Simondon. One of the attractions of Simondon’s thought is that he attempts to think technology {{from the perspective of a}} general theory of the living and of the human qua living. Nevertheless, there are certain problems that the Simondonian perspective cannot effectively engage with, such as the techno-genesis of the human and the problem of <b>biotechnics.</b> This article aims at analyzing the philosophy of technology from the point of view of individuation. All those scholars who have commented on Simondon’s philosophy of technology have concentrated exclusively on The Mode of Existence of Technical Objects. Nevertheless, this article will show that the Simondonian philosophy of artefacts must be read in the context of his philosophy of the living. This means that The Mode of Existence of Technical Objects must be examined in conjunction with his magnum opus, Individuation in the Light of the Notions of Form and of Information, like a continuous argument. In this manner, certain problems emerge: in particular, a certain framework that approaches the problem of concepts like “human”, “living” and “technology” from the perspective of already constituted individuals. 12 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Background Oral cholera {{vaccines}} {{represent a}} new eff ective tool to fi ght cholera and are licensed as two-dose regimens with 2 – 4 weeks between doses. Evidence {{from previous studies}} suggests that a single dose of oral cholera vaccine might provide substantial direct protection against cholera. During a cholera outbreak in May, 2015, in Juba, South Sudan, the Ministry of Health, Médecins Sans Frontières, and partners engaged in the fi rst fi eld deployment of a single dose of oral cholera vaccine to enhance the outbreak response. We did a vaccine eff ectiveness study in conjunction with this large public health intervention. Methods We did a case-cohort study, combining information on the vaccination status and disease outcomes from a random cohort recruited from throughout the city of Juba with that from all the cases detected. Eligible cases were those aged 1 year or older on the fi rst day of the vaccination campaign who sought care for diarrhoea at all three cholera treatment centres and seven rehydration posts throughout Juba. Confi rmed cases were suspected cases who tested positive to PCR for Vibrio cholerae O 1. We estimated the short-term protection (direct and indirect) conferred by one dose of cholera vaccine (Shanchol, Shantha <b>Biotechnics,</b> Hyderabad, India). Findings Between Aug 9, 2015, and Sept 29, 2015, we enrolled 87 individuals with suspected cholera, and an 898 -person cohort from throughout Juba. Of the 87 individuals with suspected cholera, 34 were classifi ed as cholera positive, 52 as cholera negative, and one had indeterminate results. Of the 858 cohort members who completed a follow-up visit, none developed clinical cholera during follow-up. The unadjusted single-dose vaccine eff ectiveness was 80 · 2...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: Genevac B, a new {{indigenous}} recombinant hepatitis B vaccine {{was evaluated}} for its immunogenicity and safety {{in comparison with}} Engerix B (Smithkline Beecham Biologicals, Belgium) and Shanvac B (Shantha <b>Biotechnics,</b> India) in healthy adult volunteers. METHODS: While 240 study subjects {{were included in the}} Genevac B group, 80 each were the subjects for Engerix B and Shanvac B. A three dose regimen of 0, 1, 2 months was adopted with 20 gm dosage uniformly in all the three groups. Vaccinees were assessed during prevaccination, followup and post vaccination periods for clinical, haematological, biochemical and immunological parameters for safety and immunogenicity. RESULTS: Successful follow-up in all parameters for four months could be achieved in 92. 5 &#x 0025; (222 / 240) for Genevac B study subjects and the same was 85 &#x 0025; (68 / 80) and 80 &#x 0025; (64 / 80) for Engerix B and Shanvac B respectively. While 100 &#x 0025; seroconversion was observed in all the three groups, the rate of seroprotectivity was 99. 5 &#x 0025; by Genevac B, 98. 5 &#x 0025; by Engerix B and 98. 4 &#x 0025; for Shanvac B. However the difference was not statistically significant (p> 0. 05). The GMT values of anti HBs after one month of completion of the vaccination were 735. 50, 718. 23 and 662. 20 mIU/mL respectively. No systemic reaction was either seen or reported by the volunteers during the vaccination process of Genevac B and other two vaccines. Clinical, haematological and biochemical safety parameters remained within normal limits throughout the study period. CONCLUSION: The study confirms that Genevac B, the new recombinant Hepatitis B vaccine has the acceptable international standards of safety and immunogenicity...|$|E
40|$|In vitro {{estradiol}} (E 2) {{production by}} bovine granulosa cells was evaluated under several culture conditions, {{which included the}} presence or absence of fetal bovine serum (FBS; 2. 5 and 10 %), serum substitutes (1 % Nutridoma [Boehringer-Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN], 2 % UltroSer G [IBF <b>Biotechnics,</b> Villenue-la Garenne, France]), selenium (Se; 10 ng/ml), lipoprotein (0. 25 % Excyte/ml), 02 concentration (5 and 20 %), and two attachment factors (Pronectin F and PepTite- 2000). Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium:Ham's F- 12 medium (1 : 1 mixture) containing 1 iM androstenedione, 1 gIg/ml insulin, and 0. 1 % BSA was the basal medium evaluated. The optimum conditions determined were the basal medium in 5 % 02. These conditions were then used to ascertain whether or not E 2 production by granulosa cells varied with respect to location of cells within a follicle. Follicular fluid was aspirated and centrifuged to obtain granulosa cells expected to be primarily luminal and cumulus cells. Follicles were then bisected, and remaining mural granulosa cells were removed by scraping the follicle wall with a fine plastic loop. Aspirated granulosa cells secreted more (p < 0. 01) E 2 than scraped cells. Production of E 2 during Days 0 to 2 of culture by aspirated (0. 15 ± 0. 05 ng/tIg DNA) and scraped (0. 02 ± 0. 01 ng/tpg DNA) granulosa cells from small follicles (< 8 mm) was less than that by aspirated (6. 30 ± 2. 20 ng/pig DNA) and scraped cells (1. 90 ± 1. 00 ng/pig DNA) from large follicles (2 8 mm). During Days 2 to 4 of culture when compared to Days 0 to 2, E, production increased for aspirated (but not scraped) granulosa cells from small follicles (0. 66 ± 0. 23 ng/tlg DNA)).
