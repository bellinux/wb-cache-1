25|$|On 7 February 2011, the {{redesign}} was rolled {{out to the}} remainder of the Gawker sites. The launch was troubled due to server issues. Kotaku.com and io9.com failed to load, displaying links, but no main content, and opening different posts in different tabs did not work, either. The new look emphasised images and de-emphasised the reverse chronological ordering of posts that was typical of blogs. The biggest change was the two-panel layout, consisting of one <b>big</b> <b>story,</b> and a list of headlines on the right. This was seen as an effort to increase the engagement of site visitors, by making the user experience more like that of television. The site redesign also allowed for users to create their own discussion pages, on Gawker's Kinja. Many commenters largely disliked the new design, which was in part attributed to lack of familiarity.|$|E
25|$|Lauda's {{injuries}} {{kept him}} out of the following two races, allowing Hunt to close the gap in the championship chase. At Zandvoort, Hunt overtook Ronnie Peterson on the 12th lap and resisted pressure from John Watson to win. At the Italian Grand Prix, the <b>big</b> <b>story</b> was Lauda's miraculous return from his Nürburgring accident. At a circuit that should have suited Hunt's car, the Texaco fuel McLaren were using was tested and although apparently legal, their cars, and those of the Penske team, were judged to contain a higher octane level than allowed. Subsequently, both teams were forced to start {{from the rear of the}} grid. While trying to make his way up the field, Hunt spun off, while a returning Lauda finished fourth. At the next round in Canada, Hunt found out that he had been disqualified from the British Grand Prix and Lauda had been awarded the victory and thus received three additional points. A furious Hunt drove a very hard race at the challenging Mosport Park circuit and won. And at the penultimate round in the United States at the daunting Watkins Glen track, Hunt started from pole and took victory after a close battle with Jody Scheckter.|$|E

Jennings did {{much of the work}} himself, including life-sized models of fairy tales. The park, originally separate from Idlewild, opened in 1956. Story Book Forest featured many attractions such as a pirate ship, a castle, and many live storybook characters. The entrance to the Forest is a giant storybook which reads [...] "Here is the Land of Once Upon a Time ...

Goldsman directed the episodes, his first such credit since the season premiere. He explained the finale in a January 2010 interview with Entertainment Weekly: [...] "We're {{trying to do the}} last two episodes as a singular event, a little bit more movie-like. It's really one <b>big</b> <b>story.</b> We're approaching it like a mini-feature. It'll have a singular narrative drive." [...] They originally intended for the two parts to air on the same night, but Fox told them it would be shown on two nights, a week apart. The episodes first aired in the United States on May 13 and May 20, 2010. The writers, finding the script to be easily divisible, ended the first episode with William Bell and Olivia meeting outside Fauxlivia's apartment, and began the second with Bell helping Walter escape from the hospital.|$|E

Windsor had previously never taken {{more than two weeks}} leave annually during her eight years on the show, as Peggy was considered such a central character to the series. Windsor's absence was originally only supposed to be a year long. She stated at the time: [...] "This has been a very hard decision for me to make because I'm so happy here on EastEnders but it's been a long time without a proper break. I just feel some time off would be good for me and for the character too." [...] Louise Berridge, then EastEnders executive producer, commented: [...] "Barbara has been an absolute trouper for more than eight years on this show.

[...] The Chicago Tribune Eric Zorn, watching Glee for the first time, deemed the episode [...] "deliriously, deliciously bad", deriding the casting of young adult actors as teenagers, the [...] "one-dimensional stock characters" [...] and the [...] "kitschy plots".

500|$|Maulbetsch's {{breakthrough}} came on October 31, 1914, {{in front}} of 30,000fans at Harvard. [...] The game {{was one of the}} most anticipated matches of the year. [...] A special train brought Michigan fans to Cambridge, Massachusetts, and hundreds of Michigan alumni from the East were on hand as [...] "reinforcements." [...] Though Harvard prevailed, 7–0, Maulbetsch was the <b>big</b> <b>story</b> in papers across the country. [...] Writers from Ring Lardner to Damon Runyon told the story of Maulbetsch's performance. [...] Lardner said: [...] "If anyone tells you the East plays the best brand of football, Maulbetsch shot that theory full of holes." [...] According to Runyon, the Wolverines used [...] "the mighty Maulbetsch as their battering ram", and he [...] "gained enough ground against Harvard to bury a German army corps." [...] Football writer Frank G. Menke said: [...] "No westerner ever created half the stir in the east as did this Michigander [...] [...] [...] His peculiar, baffling style of attack, backed by phenomenal strength almost always earned for him gains of 5 to 20yards every time he was called upon to carry the ball." [...] Another writer noted Maulbetsch's skill as a [...] "line breaker" [...] as he [...] "carried the ball repeatedly through the Harvard line and into the secondary defense with bullet-like rushes that upset tackler after tackler." [...] Maulbetsch was responsible for four-fifths of Michigan's ground gains, and on several occasions his dives reportedly [...] "had so much power that he dove right through a double line of crimson players and went sprawling on the ground twelve to twenty feet clear of the double line." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Inside Soap, Kirkwood said that Anthony and Tyler would bring a new element to EastEnders, [...] "There's been no shortage of brilliant and sexy women in EastEnders {{over the past few}} years and it was about time there were some blokes to join them. Tony and Matt are great actors, and the fact that they're easy on the eye is a great advantage". [...] "What the brothers bring is romance and fun, because that's something we've been a little short-changed on in EastEnders recently. The Moons are a very interesting family to work with– they're all big characters. It's a great new era for that clan". Kirkwood added that [...] "there is more to the pair than meets the eye" [...] saying that there [...] "are a couple of buried secrets between Eddie and his sons" [...] confirming it will be [...] "a <b>big</b> <b>story</b> for the summer". He finished, [...] "there'll be consequences for all concerned". Kirkwood later added, [...] "What I hope we've created in Tyler and Anthony are blokes you might see in the pub on a Friday night with an appetite for life– and for women." [...] When Anthony was introduced, it was revealed that he was a gambling addict. Of this, Lapinskas said, [...] "it's a great thing that our executive producer Bryan Kirkwood and the EastEnders team came up with for Anthony– that he does have this gambling problem and various insecurities connected with it. It adds some more depth to the character and it's brilliant when we can explore that. With every topic and every storyline that crops up, I think Anthony's background will always have an effect and impact on it. That's really nice to play." ...|$|E
500|$|In September 2014, {{talking about}} whether {{the ending of the}} season would also be a {{satisfying}} end to the series, Bell said [...] "we're not thinking of it as a series finale as much as a season finale ... I think we have some momentum coming in [...] and I think we pick up on it. I'm optimistic that we can keep the plane in the air a little longer." [...] He also talked {{about whether the}} themes of family and connectedness from the first season would be re-explored in the second, saying [...] "What we always look for are the human elements in the <b>big</b> <b>story.</b> That's what television does well, it makes you care about people, and whether it's literal family or anytime you have a team of people working together, it takes on some sort of family metaphor." [...] Bell reiterated the idea of family following the end of the season, saying [...] "In many ways, the whole metaphor {{at the heart of the}} show is family—you've got Coulson and May and then a bunch of younger people, and it allows us to play out different dynamics; literally, this season, we had Skye's biological parents versus her surrogate parents. And at the same time, we had Skye growing up. We had her going from a slightly sulky hacker season one to training to become an agent to becoming our first full-fledged superhero and so as we grow up, we separate from our parents... In our minds, her mom wasn't a villain so much; she was an antagonist, but if you look at why she feels the way she does, Jiaying really earned that position." [...] Discussing the reveal that Skye is actually Daisy Johnson, Maurissa Tancharoen explained thatJohnson is a character that we always liked. We always knew there was a potential to evolve Skye into something else. It took a little bit of time, but we were happy when we were able to land on Daisy Johnson, and actually have that work in our mythology. But as with everything that we do on the show, we pull from the properties, and we do our own spin to it. So we are kind of merging a few concepts and storylines. We've spent a season and a half with Skye. We've seen her evolve as a person, we've grown to like her as a person, we've seen her evolve as an agent. And now, finally bringing her to her origin story—I think there's just a lot more emotional weight to it, because you already know her as just Skye, and now she will have this ability that she may not understand, that she may not want ... We're going to focus on Skye, and how that affects the people around her, and how the relationships may shift. Because we've seen through the course of our series so far; we've spoken about how S.H.I.E.L.D. treats gifteds or views them, and they're categorized, things like that. What does that mean when one of your own is now considered someone with an ability? How do you categorize her?Whedon elaborated that [...] "We're going to walk her through the steps of discovering what this really means, and coming to terms with it. All that stuff is really interesting to us, and in television, because we have time to explore, we can take her origin on all sorts of different paths." [...] Additionally, Whedon talked about how the character would be referred to on the show after the reveal, saying, [...] "She's still Skye, because she thinks she's Skye. I think her dad thinks she's Daisy, and we'll see if she ever gets to the point where she believes that that's something that she would want to call herself. But right now, she has her own identity." ...|$|E

40|$|<b>Big</b> <b>Stories,</b> Small Towns is a {{transmedia}} documentary project (www. bigstories. com. au). The project {{seeks to}} describe multi-layered communities and explore complex relations between people, social backgrounds, technology and place. The project is based around filmmakers living in residence {{in a small}} town and creating stories focussed on local people caring for and creating their community. Since 2008 residencies have been undertaken in 13 towns – mainly in Australia and the Asia Pacific. In 2014 and 2015 the <b>Big</b> <b>Stories</b> team led by Martin Potter and Sabahan filmmaker Nadira Ilana ran film and photography workshops in Kampung Bongkud (Bongkud Village). Bongkud and Namaus Villages are in the Raunau district in Sabah, Malaysia approximately 140 km from the state's capital city of Kota Kinabalu and 20 km from Mount Kinabalu. Bongkud-Namaus is an ethnic Dusun community that is predominantly Christian with a Muslim minority. The primary language spoken is a Ranau dialect of Dusun. The two villages bonded in the 1970 s when villagers from Namaus moved over to Bongkud Village in need of farmlands. The villagers of Bongkud and Namaus are mostly involved with agriculture - subsistence farming, palm oil and market gardens. Some locals work for Camp Bongkud, a subsidiary of Camps International, a UK-based voluntourism company. The <b>Big</b> <b>Stories</b> team assisted locals in producing films and images with a focus on their Dusun heritage, relationships and dreams. The world premiere for <b>Big</b> <b>Stories</b> in Bongkud-Namaus took place on the 12 th of March 2016 in Bongkud Village and was an all day cultural celebration of Dusun culture, which saw over 1, 000 people attend. The project released a Malaysia specific domain: www. bigstories. com. my - the first <b>Big</b> <b>Stories</b> Co. town to receive its own country specific domain. Between June 2016 and November 2016 there were over 30, 000 visits to the <b>Big</b> <b>Stories</b> site.
