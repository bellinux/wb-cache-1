40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of using reduced flange plates (RFPs) or rib plates for seismic response of steel moment connections was investigated through cyclic testing of six full-scale specimens. The first scheme utilized RFPs {{to connect the}} <b>beam</b> <b>flanges</b> to the column, without any direct connection of the beam flange to the column. Plastic hinges were forced to form in the RFPs instead of the steel beam due to strong beam-weak RFPs, so the weakened moment connection eliminated buckling of the beam and reduced cost of repairing after earthquakes. The second scheme was to strengthen a connection, which was removed from an existing 33 -story steel building, by welding rib plates between the column face and inner side of the <b>beam</b> <b>flanges.</b> Test results of the weakened connections showed that (1) the connections developed beam plastic moment and reach more than an interstory drift of 4 % without strength degradation, (2) the RFP was effective in dissipating energy before buckling, and (3) no buckling of the beam was observed. Test results of the strengthened connection showed that the rib plates significantly reduced the beam flange strain by 75 % compared to a non-retrofitted steel moment connection. Both types of connection specimens were modeled using the non-linear finite element computer program ABAQUS to perform a correlation study...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{monotonic}} and cyclic finite element (FE) analyses are presented {{for the development}} of an I-beam-to-CHS column steel moment joint for seismic actions. The development process for the final joint details includes: (1) eliminating two identified structural deficiencies of distortion in column web panel and strain concentrations in the external diaphragms; (2) creating a multi-fuse energy dissipation mechanism; (3) devising a joint to delay onset of beam yielding. Two external diaphragm collar plates are welded to the circumference of the CHS column for connection to <b>beam</b> <b>flanges.</b> Various collar ring widths are examined for these horizontal diaphragms and a width (based on achieving full strength of the <b>beam</b> <b>flanges)</b> is found to produce an acceptable web panel performance. Different types of stiffener geometries in the connection region are then trialed to eliminate strain concentrations in the diaphragms. Two pairs of triangular diaphragm stiffeners are found to provide the desired performance. In order to produce a multi-fuse energy dissipation mechanism, tapered cover plates (TCPs) equipped with vertical stiffeners (VSs) are integrated into the joint. Oversized web holes of 4 – 10 mm are required to enable inelastic deformation for an overall joint rotation of 60 – 100 mrad, without undesirable web distortion. Further FE analyses are used to design the TCPs and VSs so they can be replaceable link post-seismic actions. For the final joint detailing it is shown that 6 mm oversized holes for the TCPs will delay the occurrence of yielding in the beam until the joint rotation is 70 mrad...|$|E

Different methods are investigated for predicting the capacity of the flange. The first assumes a uniform stress distribution resulting in bending of the flange. This is adequate for timber posts, but not as accurate at the second more elaborate method which accounts for an interaction between flange bending and post compression strength, found to be effective for timber posts.

Regardless of different web attachment details in RBS-B and RBS-W connections current design procedures (FEMA 350) assumes that they could develop plastic moment of the beam gross section. In current design procedures, RBS-B connections should provide the sufficient strength that can reach the plastic moment capacity of the connected beam. However, some experimental researches reported that the beams in RBS-B connections fractured before the connection reached its plastic moment capacity. Such undesirable fracture shows that RBS-B connections have less strength than RBS-W connections. And if RBS-B connections designed in current design procedures, it might fail in a brittle manner and not satisfy SMRF due to undesirable fracture.

Stiffening plate is welded at top of the flange while downhand welding and high strength friction grip bolts are used for the top <b>beam</b> <b>flange</b> and the <b>beam</b> web, respectively. The connection reduces the construction period and costs. In this paper, monotonic and reversed cyclic loading tests were conducted on three full-scale specimens of this innovative joint, to investigate its load-bearing capacity, energy-dissipating capacity and failure modes. The results indicate that the joint has high load-bearing capacity and great ductility. The failure mode is due to the slippage of flange bolts as well as the gap development between the two flange plates.
