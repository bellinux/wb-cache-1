Here we analyse these simulations in more detail {{in an effort to}} identify the physical mechanism that leads to the formation of anti-truncations (Type-III profiles). We find that orbital resonances with a central <b>bar</b> <b>drive</b> stellar orbits from circular orbits with small semi-major axes to rather eccentric orbits with large semi-major axes. These orbits then form a disk-like configuration with high radial dispersion and rotation far below the circular velocity. This will manifest itself in photometry as an antitruncated (Type-III) outer stellar disk. Whether such outer disks &# 8211; with qualitatively new dynamics &# 8211; exist in nature can be tested by future observations...|$|E

40|$|The {{existence}} of a classical bulge in disk galaxies holds important clue to the assembly history of galaxies. Finding observational evidence of very low mass classical bulges particularly in barred galaxies including our Milky Way, is a challenging task as the <b>bar</b> <b>driven</b> secular evolution might bring significant dynamical change to these bulges alongside the stellar disk. Using high-resolution N-body simulation, we show that if a cool stellar disk is assembled around a non-rotating low-mass classical bulge, the disk rapidly grows a strong bar within a few rotation time scales. Later, the <b>bar</b> <b>driven</b> secular process transform the initial classical bulge into a flattened rotating stellar system whose central part also have grown a bar-like component rotating {{in sync with the}} disk bar. During this time, a boxy/peanut (hereafter, B/P) bulge is formed via the buckling instability of the disk bar and the vertical extent of this B/P bulge being slightly higher than that of the classical bulge, it encompasses the whole classical bulge. The resulting composite bulge appears to be both photometrically and kinematically identical to a B/P bulge without any obvious signature of the classical component. Our analysis suggest that many barred galaxies in the local universe might be hiding such low-mass classical bulges. We suggest that stellar population and chemodynamical analysis might be required in establishing the evidence for such low-mass classical bulges.

40|$|An {{analysis}} of the star cluster population in a low-luminosity early type galaxy, NGC 2328, is presented. The clusters are found in a tight star-forming nuclear spiral/ring pattern and we also identify a bar from structural 2 D decomposition. These massive clusters are forming very efficiently in the circum-nuclear environment, they are young, possibly all less than 30 Myr of age. The clusters indicate an azimuthal age gradient, consistent with a "pearls-on-a-string" formation scenario suggesting <b>bar</b> <b>driven</b> gas inflow. The cluster mass function has a robust down-turn at low masses at all age bins. Assuming clusters are born with a power-law distribution, this indicates extremely rapid disruption at time-scales of just several Myr.

40|$|The {{structure}} {{and evolution of}} the stellar velocity ellipsoid {{plays an important role}} in shaping galaxies undergoing <b>bar</b> <b>driven</b> secular evolution and the eventual formation of a boxy/peanut bulge such as present in the Milky Way. Using collisionless N-body simulations, we show that during the formation of such a boxy/peanut bulge, the meridional shear stress of stars, which can be measured by the meridional tilt of the velocity ellipsoid, reaches a characteristic peak in its time evolution. It is shown that the onset of a bar buckling instability is closely connected to the maximum meridional tilt of the stellar velocity ellipsoid. Our findings bring new insight to this complex gravitational instability of the bar which complements the buckling instability studies based on orbital models. We briefly discuss the observed diagnostics of the stellar velocity ellipsoid during such a phenomenon. Comment: 10 pages, 16 Figures, accepted by the Ap...|$|R

Detailed solutions are obtained for continuous bars with an excitation frequency less than, and then greater than, the fundamental free-vibration frequency.

It is concluded that when more than two different constrained arcs characterize the optimal solution, the continuum approach may be impractical, and finite-element approximations may offer the only alternative...|$|R

Consequently, in the CN region, gravitational instabilities can only grow at high gas densities and on short timescales, explaining in part why powerful starbursts reside there.

40|$|Recently, Buta etal. (2009) {{examined}} the question "Do <b>Bars</b> <b>Drive</b> Spiral Density Waves?", an idea supported by theoretical studies {{and also from}} a preliminary observational analysis Block etal (2004). They estimated maximum bar strengths Q_b, maximum spiral strengths Q_s, and maximum m= 2 arm contrasts A_ 2 s for 23 galaxies with deep AAT K_s-band images. These were combined with previously published Q_b and Q_s values for 147 galaxies from the OSUBSGS sample and with the 12 galaxies from Block etal(2004). Weak correlation between Q_b and Q_s was confirmed for the combined sample, whereas the AAT subset alone showed no significant correlations between Q_b and Q_s, nor between Q_b and A_ 2 s. A similar negative result was obtained in Durbala etal. (2009) for 46 galaxies. Based on these studies, {{the answer to the}} above question remains uncertain. Here we use a novel approach, and show that although the correlation between the maximum bar and spiral parameters is weak, these parameters do correlate when compared locally. For the OSUBSGS sample a statistically significant correlation is found between the local spiral amplitude, and the forcing due to the bar's potential at the same distance, out to 1. 6 bar radii (the typical bar perturbation is then of the order of a few percent). Also for the sample of 23 AAT galaxies we find a significant correlation between local parameters out to 1. 4 bar radii.

40|$|We present {{high-quality}} fluid dynamical {{simulations of}} isothermal gas flows in a rotating barred potential. We {{show that a}} large quantity of gas is driven right into the nucleus of a model galaxy when the potential lacks a central mass concentration, but the inflow stalls at a nuclear ring in comparison simulations that include a central massive object. The radius of the nuclear gas ring increases linearly with {{the mass of the}} central object. We argue that <b>bars</b> <b>drive</b> gas right into the nucleus {{in the early stages of}} disk galaxy formation, where a nuclear star cluster and perhaps a massive black hole could be created. The process is self-limiting, however, because inflow stalls at a nuclear ring once the mass of gas and stars in the nucleus exceeds ~ 1 % of the disk mass, which shuts off rapid growth of the black hole. We briefly discuss the relevance of these results to the seeding of massive black holes in galaxies, the merger model for quasar evolution, and the existence of massive black holes in disk galaxies that lack a significant classical bulge.

The analysis of optical and far [...] infrared images allows us to identify a clear spatial correlation between stellar bars and the cold-gas distribution mapped by the warm dust emission. We find that the infrared counterparts of optically identified bars are either bar [...] like structures or dead central regions in which star formation is strongly suppressed. Similar morphologies are found in the distribution of star formation directly traced by Hα maps. The sizes of such optical and infrared structures correlate remarkably well, hinting at a causal connection.

40|$|Systems of bars in x with {{intermediate}} hinge, {{also called}} SLE (scissor like elements), {{are suitable for}} the adaptability approach {{from the perspective of}} structural mobility. They are the starting point for new solutions: transformable M-SLE. It has been proved possible to obtain different formal alternatives with a single structural solution, by making modifications to add a DOF (degree of freedom) to the SLE base unit. In this research a new transformable typology is studied: telescopic bars, articulated in x. This proposal, based on the new MP-SLE (modified prismatic SLE) typology, combines two mechanisms of transformation: the scissor system with telescopic bars.

40|$|<b>Bar</b> <b>driven</b> secular {{evolution}} plays a {{key role}} in changing the morphology and kinematics of disk galaxies, leading to the formation of rapidly rotating boxy/peanut bulges. If these disk galaxies also hosted a preexisting classical bulge, how would the secular evolution influence the classical bulge, and also the observational properties. We first study the co-evolution of a bar and a preexisting non-rotating low-mass classical bulge such as might be present in galaxies like the Milky Way. It is shown with N-body simulations that during the secular evolution, such a bulge can gain significant angular momentum emitted by the bar through resonant and stochastic orbits. Thereby it transforms into a cylindrically rotating, anisotropic and triaxial object, embedded in the fast rotating boxy bulge that forms via disk instability (Saha et al. 2012). The composite boxy/peanut bulge also rotates cylindrically. We then show that the growth of the bar depends only slightly on the rotation properties of the preexisting classical bulge. For the initially rotating small classical bulge, cylindrical rotation in the resulting composite boxy/peanut bulge extends to lower heights (Saha & Gerhard 2012). More massive classical bulges also gain angular momentum emitted by the bar, inducing surprisingly large rotational support within about 4 Gyrs (Saha et al. in prep).
