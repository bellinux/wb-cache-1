5000|$|Amaryllis (...) is {{the only}} genus in the {{subtribe}} Amaryllidinae (tribe Amaryllideae). It is a small genus of flowering bulbs, with two species. The better known of the two, Amaryllis belladonna, {{is a native of}} the Western Cape region of South Africa, particularly the rocky southwest area between the Olifants River Valley to Knysna. For many years there was confusion among botanists over the generic names Amaryllis and Hippeastrum, one result of which is that the common name [...] "amaryllis" [...] is mainly used for cultivars of the genus Hippeastrum, widely sold in the winter months for their ability to bloom indoors. Plants of the genus Amaryllis are known as <b>belladonna</b> <b>lily,</b> Jersey lily, naked lady, amarillo, Easter lily in Southern Australia or, in South Africa, March lily due to its propensity to flower around March. This is one of numerous genera with the common name [...] "lily" [...] due to their flower shape and growth habit. However, they are only distantly related to the true lily, Lilium.|$|E

Seven blossoms can be seen, and portions of the two stalks.; "This group consists of one deciduous plant, A. belladonna (Belladonna Lily; Naked Lady Lily), which is native to southern Africa and has been naturalized {{in some areas of}} the U. S. This plant grows from a true bulb to 2 or 3 feet high. It produces long, slender leaves in the spring, which die back in early summer. Then, in late summer, 2 - to 3 -foot, red tinged stalks arise each bearing up to a dozen, aromatic blossoms. The 4 - to 6 -inch, trumpet-shaped flowers may be white, red, rosy red, or pink and are excellent as cut flowers, lasting for about a week. *Note that <b>Belladonna</b> <b>Lilies</b> are poisonous if eaten.

Bidwill worked with both native and exotic plants, and in 1843, he released his first hybrid, which was a hybrid between two Australian plants - Hibiscus splendens and H. heterophyllus - which he named ‘Hibiscus Sydneyi’. The hybrid <b>belladonna</b> <b>lilies</b> derived from Amaryllis belladonna and Brunsvigia spp., which are now grown all over the world, were first raised by him in 1841.|$|R

Verlorenvlei is renowned for its prolific birdlife, indigenous fynbos, flora and fauna, potato farms and unspoiled nature. During the flower season, July - September, a kaleidoscopic carpet of sweet-smelling wildflowers springs to life. Among many others, daisies, chinckerenchees, <b>belladonna</b> <b>lilies,</b> arum and Pink Afrikaner (red lily), also called the Sandveld Lily, can be seen.|$|R
50|$|Amaryllis <b>belladonna,</b> (Jersey <b>lily,</b> belladonna-lily, naked-lady-lily, March lily) is a {{plant species}} native to Cape Province in South Africa but widely {{cultivated}} {{as a very}} popular ornamental. It is reportedly naturalized in many places: Corsica, Portugal, the Azores, Madeira, the Canary Islands, Zaire, Ascension Island, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Chile, California, Texas, Louisiana, and the Juan Fernández Islands.|$|R

Nor have the upper heights been wholly bared.

In Theocritus’ Idylls, Amaryllis was {{wandering}} in the woods, and the Roman poet Virgil wrote of her as a singer that appeared in the Eclogue. The nymph Amaryllis and her story inspired the name of the (Christmas) flower Amaryllis that is known today. In English, the flower is also called <b>belladonna</b> or Jersey <b>Lily.</b>|$|R
