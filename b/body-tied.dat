The ON/OFF current ratio of the p+-Ge/n-Si and n+-Ge/p-Si heterojunction was> 107 and> 106, respectively. The OFF current density was extremely low at < 10 μA/cm 2 for the p+-Ge/n-Si formed with different implantation energies of 10 ∼ 40 KeV and ∼ 20 μA/cm 2 for the n+-Ge/p-Si with different implantation energies of 20 ∼ 50 KeV at a reverse bias of |V R | = ± 1 V, respectively. Both p and n-Ge channel multifin field-effect transistors (FinFETs) were formed by a mesa structure using these p+-Ge/n-Si and n+-Ge/p-Si heterojunctions. A high-κ /metal gate stack was employed. The <b>body-tied</b> Ge multifin FinFET with a fin width (WFin) of ∼ 40 nm, and the channel length (LChannel) was 150 nm for p-FinFET and of 110 nm for n-FinFET, exhibiting a driving current of 174 μA/μm at VG = − 2 V and 102 μA/μm at VG = 2 V, respectively. This is the first experimental demonstration of a <b>body-tied</b> high mobility Ge channel multifin FinFET using a top-down approach.

The influence of both structures in Double-Gate Vertical MOSFET (DG VMOS) will affect the device performance. For this purpose, both device structures, <b>body-tied</b> and floating-body DG VMOS have been developed and analytically compared by using Silvaco TCAD simulation tools. The simulations made for various substrate concentrations, Nsub(9 × 1017, 5 × 1017 and 1 × 1017 cm- 3) to be varied with different channel length, Lg (90, 50, and 30 nm). The electrical characteristic and SCEs of Threshold Voltage, Vth, Drain Induced Barrier Lowering (DIBL), Sub-threshold Swing (SS), and Current Ratio (Ion/Ioff) for both proposed device structures were investigated. According to TCAD simulation results, these respective results have been achieved, 20 mV/V of DIBL, and more than 107 Ion/Ioff current ratio. The excellent subthreshold swing (~ 60 mV/dec) of the BT DGVMOS device is also attractive and it offers better electrical characteristics and thus improves the short channel effects (SCEs) compared to the FB DGVMOS device.

40|$|Body-contacts (BC) {{partially}} depleted (PD) silicon-on-insulator (SOI) MOSFETs {{suffer from}} a loss of body potential control at frequencies higher than several hundreds of MHz due to the high value of the body resistance (R/sub be/) in currently available PD SOI technologies.

40|$|Abstract: We {{present an}} input/output block (IOB) array {{used in the}} radiation-hardened SRAM-based field-programmable gate array (FPGA) VS 1000, which is {{designed}} and fabricated with a 0. 5 m partially depleted silicon-on-insulator (SOI) logic process at the CETC 58 th Institute. Corresponding with {{the characteristics of the}} FPGA, each IOB includes a local routing pool and two IO cells composed of a signal path circuit, configurable input/output buffers and an ESD protection network. A boundary-scan path circuit can be used between the pro-grammable buffers and the input/output circuit or as a transparent circuit when the IOB is applied in different modes. Programmable IO buffers can be used at TTL/CMOS standard levels. The local routing pool enhances the flexibility and routability of the connection between the IOB array and the core logic. Radiation-hardened designs, including A-type and H-type <b>body-tied</b> transistors and special D-type registers, improve the anti-radiation performance. The ESD protection network, which provides a high-impulse discharge path on a pad, prevents the breakdown of the core logic caused by the immense current. These design strategies facilitate the design of FPGAs with different ca-pacities or architectures to form a series of FPGAs. The functionality and performance of the IOB array is proved after a functional test. The radiation test indicates that the proposed VS 1000 chip with an IOB array has a total dose tolerance of 100 krad(Si), a dose survivability rate of 1. 5 1011 rad(Si) /s, and a neutron fluence immunity of 1 1014 n/cm 2.

30|$|One way of {{increasing}} the response speed of semiconductor devices and reducing their power consumption {{is to use a}} semiconductor with a high-carrier mobility. Examples of such materials include Ge as well as its alloys and compounds. However, when a structure is formed by stacking a layer of a semiconductor material on top of a substrate of a different semiconductor, problems may arise. For example, the difference in the lattice sizes of the semiconductor substrate and the overlying layer of a different semiconductor material may cause dislocations, which may have an adverse effect on device performance. Conventionally, in order to fabricate Ge-based semiconductor devices that include a Si substrate, a thicker buffer layer or sacrificial layer (e.g., a Si/Ge buffer layer) is formed on the silicon substrate. Subsequently, a Ge epitaxial layer is grown on the Si/Ge buffer layer. Next, anisotropic and isotropic etching processes are performed sequentially to remove a part of the buffer layer and retain the Ge epitaxial layer. VLSI devices must show a high drive current, low off-state leakage current, and low supply voltage, in order to ensure high performance, including low standby power consumption and reduced dynamic power dissipation. Currently, strain-enhanced mobility, high-k/metal gate, and three-dimensional (3 D) device architecture at the 22  nm node [1] are some of the technologies being used for the continuous scaling of complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) devices with a Si channel. In addition to characteristics such as high mobility, new device architectures such as those of gate-all-around (GAA) [2] and ultrathin-body field-effect transistors (FETs) [3] are needed to improve electrostatic control in the sub- 10  nm nodes. Ge-based GAA pFETs [4] and nFETs [5] with inversion-mode (INV) operation have been demonstrated. However, junction formation in Ge INV devices is a critical issue owing to the low dopant solubility, rapid dopant diffusion, and low thermal budget. To solve these issues, junction-less (JL) devices [6] that use a heavy doped channel with the same carrier type as that of the source/drain (S/D) regions have been suggested as alternatives. However, the rapid scaling of transistors requires the development of new and more effective devices that can catch up with modern transistors. In recent years, JL-FETs {{have been found to be}} promising as next-generation transistors. The JL-FET is basically a resistor in which the mobile carrier density can be controlled by the gate. In the ON state, a large body current exists, owing to the relatively high doping concentration in the channel region; the surface accumulation current is added to this current The level of doping in the JL-FET needs to be high in order to achieve a suitable current drive, while the device cross-section needs to be small enough such that the device can be turned off. However, in the case of highly doped JL-FETs, the carriers undergo significant impurity scattering, owing to which the drive current is significantly degraded [7]. Furthermore, JL-FETs have the advantages of being simple to fabricate and have high charge mobility and low gate capacitance, in contrast to INV devices [8 – 12]. Recently, double-gate [13] and <b>body-tied</b> tri-gate [14] Ge JL-FET pMOSFETs were demonstrated on germanium-on-insulator substrates and bulk Si, respectively.|$|E
40|$|Energy {{harvesting}} {{and functional}} reconfigurability are necessary features {{in order to}} simultaneously achieve longer operating lifetimes and versatility in application for many next generation electronic systems. The presented research incorporates capabilities that not only enable applications to self-power from ambience but also permit change in functionality based on real-time application requirements. Currently, many applications are battery powered with custom hardware, which severely confines the application platform. Moreover, maintenance and upgrades are prohibitively expensive, {{particularly in the case}} of remote locations with limited accessibility. For harsh environments like Space or the battlefield, apart from features such as low power and reconfigurability, robust circuit design is also essential to withstand the effects of radiation and noise. The proposed research implements the Subthreshold Radhard Reconfigurable (SRR) architecture that collectively addresses these three design requirements: (1) radiation hardness with Single Event Upset (SEU) immune circuits, (2) self-powering with subthreshold voltage operation, and (3) functional adaptability with a programmable processing element. The proposed architecture is a unique solution – well suited for the next generation systems that can simultaneously harvest energy from ambience, reconfigure based on immediate application requirements, and provide robust operation even in harsh environments. ^ In the course of the SRR design, that combined reconfigurability, subthreshold and robust operation novel subthreshold optimized circuits were proposed and evaluated for the first time. The proposed circuits include: (1) a Modified Sense Amplifier C 2 MOS Flip-Flop (MOSAC FF), which enables SEU/SET (Single Event Transient) resilience with 50 % reduced power and 20 % better SET critical charge (Qcrit) values compared to the best existing design, (2) <b>Body-Tied</b> Level Shifter, which provides 13 % increased performance, and (3) Charge Pump, which provides 15 % increased output voltage gain at subthreshold voltages when compared to existing designs. These proposed novel circuits, in a design competition sponsored by DARPA, were awarded fabrication at Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Lincoln Laboratory (MITLL), which provides the first ever CMOS technology specifically optimized for subthreshold operation. ^ The functional verification of the proposed architecture is performed by configuring the design as a 16 -bit Multiply Accumulate (MAC) unit using 45 nm IBM- 12 SOI fully depleted transistor model in HSPICE. For comparison purposes, two designs were considered: (1) the Application Specific MAC (ASMAC) design employing adaptive body-bias supply; and (2) an off-the-shelf commercial Xilinx Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) configured to function as 16 -bit MAC. The ASMAC design reported better power consumption values than the proposed design but lacked application flexibility and design robustness. Similarly, in comparison to the proposed design, the commercial FPGA provided application flexibility and substantial performance, at the expense of several orders of increased power consumption. Furthermore, the FPGA implementation lacked radiation hardness and depended on a dedicated traditional power supply. The proposed architecture was not as power efficient as the ASMAC; however, the slight increase in power is a necessary trade-off when considering the additional features provided, which include robustness, ultra-low power operation, and application adaptability. Consequently the proposed design is apt for applications requiring self-powering, versatile application, and operation in harsh environments. ...|$|E
