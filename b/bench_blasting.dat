40|$|Ground {{vibrations}} {{originating from}} <b>bench</b> <b>blasting</b> may cause damage to slopes, structures, and underground workings {{in close proximity}} to an operating open-pit mine. It is important to monitor and predict ground vibration levels induced by blasting and to take measures to reduce their hazardous effects. The aims of this paper are to determine the weaker protection objects by comparatively studying <b>bench</b> <b>blasting</b> induced vibrations obtained at surface and in an underground tunnel in an open-pit mine and thus to seek vibration control methods to protect engineering objects at the site. Vibrations arising from measurement devices at surface and in an underground tunnel at the Zijinshan Open-Pit Mine were obtained. Comparative analysis of the peak particle velocities shows that, in the greatest majority of cases, surface values are higher than underground values for the same vibration distance. The transmission laws of surface and underground vibrations were established {{depending on the type of}} rock mass, the explosive charge, and the distance. Compared with the Chinese Safety Regulations for Blasting (GB 6722 - 2014), the <b>bench</b> <b>blasting</b> induced vibrations would not currently cause damage to the underground tunnel.

40|$|A Study on Ground Vibration Due to Rock Blasting at Metal Quarry Ground vibration, {{air blast}} and fly-rock are {{unavoidable}} {{environmental impacts of}} rock blasting.

This paper focuses on the influences of initiation position on <b>bench</b> <b>blasting</b> in order to improve blasting effects. The numerical simulations of <b>bench</b> <b>blasting</b> at different initiation points (top, middle, and bottom) are implemented based on secondary development of LS-DYNA with a tensile-compressive damage model. The damage spatial distribution characteristics of different initiation points are compared. The outlines of rock foundation and boulder areas are analyzed with the damage threshold of critical breakage that is ascertained by acoustic characteristic of damage rock mass. Results of the numerical simulations demonstrate that different initiation points make a great influence on the stress and energy distribution in blasting process and induce different blasting effects. Middle initiation turns out to be the best initiation to increase the flatness of the floor and decrease the oversize boulder ratio simultaneously, which will increase the damage areas of the bottom and top regions and give a better blasting effect. Field experiment in Baihetan Station was carried out to validate conclusions of numerical simulation. Research could provide a good reference for the improvement of rock blasting...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{protective}} layer (PL) is commonly reserved above foundation surface {{to protect the}} underlying rock mass during dam foundation excavation. In China, the PL of dam foundation is conventionally subdivided into two or three thin layers and excavated with the shallow-hole blasting method, even by pneumatic pick method in case of soft rock mass. The aforementioned layered excavation of the PL delays {{the construction of the}} whole project. After nearly 30 -year practices, several safe and efficient methods for the PL excavation of dam foundation are gradually developed. They include shallow-hole <b>bench</b> <b>blasting</b> with cushion material (SBC) {{at the bottom of the}} hole, and horizontal smooth blasting (HSB). The PL is even cancelled on the condition that horizontal pre-split technique is employed during dam foundation excavation. This paper introduces the aforementioned two PL excavation methods (shallow-hole blasting and <b>bench</b> <b>blasting)</b> and horizontal pre-split technique of dam foundation without {{protective layer}} (HPP). The basic principles of blasting method, blasting geometry, charge structure, drill-and-blast parameters of typical projects are examined. Meanwhile, the merits and limitations of each method are compared. Engineering practices in China show that HSB is basically the optimal method for dam foundation PL excavation in terms of foundation damage control and rapid construction. Some new problems for dam foundation PL excavation arising, such as strong unloading and relaxation phenomenon that encountered in the gorge region of southwest China, are needed to be addressed; and the corresponding countermeasures are discussed as well...|$|E
40|$|A {{discrete}} element {{computer program}} named DMC{_}BLAST (Distinct Motion Code) {{has been under}} development since 1987 for modeling rock blasting. This program employs explicit time integration and uses spherical or cylindrical elements that are represented as circles in 2 -D. DMC{_}BLAST calculations compare favorably with data from actual <b>bench</b> <b>blasts.</b> The blast modeling capabilities of DMC{_}BLAST have been expanded to include independently dipping geologic layers, top surface, bottom surface and pit floor. The pit can also now be defined using coordinates based on the toe of the bench. A method for modeling decked explosives has been developed which allows accurate treatment of the inert materials (stemming) in the explosive column and approximate treatment of different explosives in the same blasthole. A DMC{_}BLAST user can specify decking through a specific geologic layer with either inert material or a different explosive. Another new feature of DMC{_}BLAST is specification of an uplift angle which is the angle between the normal to the blasthole and a vector defining the direction of explosive loading on particles adjacent to the blasthole. A buffer (choke) blast capability has been added for situations where previously blasted material is adjacent to the free face of the bench preventing any significant lateral motion during the blast...|$|R
40|$|Under all {{circumstances}} "Industrial Blasting" {{needs to}} be carried out without inflicting disastrous affects on the neighbourhood. If it is carried out considering engineering properties of rock mass being blasted and with the proper quantification of blastability of explosives blasting can be done without inflicting any adverse affects caused by ground vibrations, ecological damage and also maintaining air blast overpressure below human tolerance levels. It is widely recognized that two aspects such as structural damage and human response are the ones which merit particular attention in surface mine and construction blasting. Under such circumstances blasting has {{to be carried out}} in a well designed manner. The affect of engineering geological properties of rock mass in blast designs and the role of quarry factor in blasting are discussed in this paper. The paper also describes the importance of the establishment of site constants for quarries.

40|$|In this {{twenty-first century}} surface mining {{activities}} contribute around 90 % of the mineral production in our country. This milestone is achieved through {{the deployment of}} high capacity excavation machineries- earth moving machines, large hole drilling machines, etc. As these machineries involve high investment, effective utilization is a must for higher production. But their performance depends upon the fragmentation size, which in turn depends upon the Blast Design. Thus Blast design contributes {{a major role in}} reducing cost and increasing production. Due to varying geological conditions as well as rock properties, there exists multiple approaches for the design of blasting operations. Those suffer from many drawbacks as inaccurate assumptions in rock mass characteristics, rick analysis not included, inadequate data bank, etc. Veronoi design is a new method to calculate and analyze some of the parameters of <b>bench</b> <b>blast.</b> An analytical solution for row and blasthole spacing is first calculated based on explosive charge maximization.

40|$|Present study {{concentrates}} {{primarily on}} radial crack propagation by the explosive gas {{pressure and the}} associated fracture formation, and on estimating the effects of natural discontinuities on rock fragmentation in <b>bench</b> <b>blasting.</b> Boundary element and finite element methods coupled with fracture mechanics theories are used to study the crack propagation. Fractal geometry principles are used to study the effect of natural discontinuities. Predicted stresses from conventional <b>bench</b> <b>blasting</b> model without any radial crack differ little from those around a pressurized hole in an infinite medium. Contrary to field observations, the radially symmetric stress field predicts a thin failed zone concentric with the hole. A loading rate dependent model, developed considering microflaws, suggest only long micro fractures become the radial cracks. The biaxial compression zone {{at the side of}} a radial crack suppresses smaller cracks. Other cracks can grow beyond this zone. Some die as the cracks become pressurized. Tensile σ₃ outside this zone peaks near the crack tip. A biaxial tension zone forms ahead of the crack tip. A multicrack model of <b>bench</b> <b>blasting</b> is developed. Biaxial compression zone forms near the hole. σ₃ is tensile outside this zone and peaks near the crack tips. Numerous tensile fractures form in these regions. Tensile fractures continue to form with radial crack growth and existing fractures grow in sliding. Stress redistribution around the fractures produces second and lower order fractures. These fractures break rock between the radial cracks. Pressurization of radial cracks is essential to propagate them for longer distances and to form associated fractures for further breakage of burden. The beam bending model produces unrealistically large burden displacement. The equivalent cavity hypothesis correctly estimates the stresses beyond the radial cracks but ignores the radial crack propagation and the associated breakage. It predicts a failed region concentric with the hole. The effect of natural discontinuities on fragmentation is determined by comparing the Schuhmann size distribution curves of the blasted fragments and the in-situ blocks. In-situ block and after blast fragments sizes, measured from photographs, are fractal which is analogous to Schuhmann Distribution. Exploiting the fractal characteristics eliminates the problems associated with size determination. Automated data reduction processes can make this method very powerful for routine monitoring and design optimization of blasts. Discontinuity pattern, fracture density, block density, fault structure, and microcracks in laboratory specimens are also fractal. Fractal behavior at microscale (10 ⁻⁶ m) to megascale (10 ⁵ m) implies Self-similar rock fracture formation. The fractal dimension {{may be related to the}} applied stress field...|$|E

40|$|A {{geometrical}} {{model for the}} rock crushed zone around a cylindrical charge is developed. The model is used to obtain empirical relationships between the scaled crushed zone diameter and some dimensionless ratios of explosive and rock properties. The ratios are velocity ratio, characteristic impedance ratio, medium stress ratio, and detonation pressure ratio. The empirical relations for granite, salt, and limestone in combination {{with a variety of}} explosives show that the scaled crushed zone diameter increases at a decreasing rate with increasing dimensionless ratios. The shape of the wave fronts around a cylindrical charge detonating in rock has been constructed for velocity ratios ranging from infinity to less than one. The shape of the wave front is not planar in the range of dimensions used in full scale <b>bench</b> <b>blasting.</b> The shape of the wave front is cylindrical in the middle and spherical at the top and bottom for infinite velocity ratio; sphero-conical for velocity ratios greater than one; spherical for velocity ratios ≤ 1. Quasi-static finite element models for a blasthole in a full scale <b>bench</b> <b>blasting</b> are analyzed using a 2 -D finite element program written by the author. The models include a model neglecting radial cracks, models considering pressurized and non-pressurized radial cracks around the blasthole, and a model using an equivalent cavity to replace the pressurized radial cracks. Displacement fields, stress fields, and strain energy density distribution are studied. The analyses show that including radial cracks increases the levels of the strain energy density contours and the magnitudes of the displacement and stress fields several fold. The equivalent cavity gives much lower levels of strain energy contours and gives lower displacement and stress field magnitudes than those produced by the pressurized radial cracks. The scaled areas of the strain energy density contours increase at a decreasing rate with increasing the blasthole internal pressure and with increasing the ratio of the compressive strength to the tensile strength. These contour areas decrease at a decreasing rate with increasing tensile strength...|$|E
40|$|The {{extraction}} of minerals from surface mines and quarries can produce significant fugitive dust emissions {{as a result of}} site activities such as blasting, road haulage, loading, crushing and stockpiling. If uncontrolled, these emissions can present serious environmental, health, safety and operational issues impacting both site personnel and the wider community. The dispersion of pollutant emissions within the atmosphere is principally determined by the background wind systems characterized by the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). This paper presents an overview of the construction and solution of a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model to replicate the development of the internal ventilation regime within a surface quarry excavation due to the presence of a neutral ABL above this excavation. This model was then used to study the dispersion and deposition of fugitive mineral dust particles generated during rock blasting operations. The paths of the mineral particles were modelled using Lagrangian particle tracking. Particles of four size fractions were released from five blast locations for eight different wind directions.

In spite of the best efforts to introduce mechanization in the opencast mines, blasting continue to dominate the production. Beside the production in open cast mining blasting and vibration also cause environmental problem. In <b>bench</b> <b>blast</b> design, not only the technical and economic aspects, such as block size, uniformity and cost, but also the elimination of environmental problems resulting from ground vibration, air blast and fly rock {{should be taken into}} consideration.

Odisha is rich in iron ore deposit and the mines invariably need blasting for loosen the rock mass. These are frequent complaints from the people surrounding the zone about adverse effect of blasting. This study is an attempt to evaluate same of those aspects. Two active iron ore mine have been considered for the analysis of ground vibration, air over pressure, flyrock as well as fragmentation parameters.

In this investigation the utility of those approaches are evaluated. It was observed that the two region Koira and Daitarido not confirm strongly to the five approaches. Artificial neural network is a technique that is gain wide acceptance even in heterogeneous condition. This study also finds that the prediction by ground vibration, air over pressure and fly rock by ANN would be better alternative. Model equation has also been developed with ANN approach.

This program employs explicit time integration and uses spherical or cylindrical elements that are represented as circles in two dimensions. DMC_BLAST calculations compare favorably with data from actual <b>bench</b> <b>blasts</b> (Preece et al, 1993). Coal seam chilling refers to the shattering of {{a significant portion of}} the coal leaving unusable fines. It is also refereed to as coal damage. Chilling is caused during a blast by a combination of explosive shock energy and movement of the adjacent rock. Chilling can be minimized by leaving a buffer zone between the bottom of the blastholes and the coal seam or by changing the blast design to decrease the powder factor or by a combination of both. Blast design in coal mine cast blasting is usually a compromise between coal damage and rock fragmentation and movement (heave). In this paper the damage to coal seams from rock movement is examined using the discrete element computer code DMC_BLAST. A rock material strength option has been incorporated into DMC_BLAST by placing bonds/links between the spherical particles used to model the rock. These bonds tie the particles together but can be broken when the tensile, compressive or shear stress in the bond exceeds the defined strength. This capability has been applied to predict coal seam damage, particularly at the toe of a cast blast where drag forces exerted by movement of the overlying rock can adversely effect the top of the coal at the bench face. A simulation of coal mine cast blasting has been performed with special attention being paid to the strength of the coal and its behavior at t he bench face during movement of the overlying material...|$|R

This program employs explicit time integration and uses spherical or cylindrical elements that are represented as circles in two dimensions (2 -D). DMC{underscore}BLAST calculations compare favorably with data from actual <b>bench</b> <b>blasts</b> (Preece et al, 1993). Buffer Choke blasting is commonly used in surface gold mines to break the rock and dilate it sufficiently for ease of digging, with the assumption of insignificant horizontal movement. The blast designs usually call for relatively shallow holes benches ({lt} 11 m) with small blastholes (approx. 165 mm), small burdens and spacings ({lt} 5 m), often with 50 % {{or more of the}} hole stemmed. Control of blast-induced horizontal movement is desired because the ore is assayed in place from the blasthole drill cuttings and digging polygons of ore and waste are laid out before the blast. Horizontal movement at the ore waste boundary can result in dilution of the ore or loss of ore with the waste. The discrete element computer program DMC{underscore}BLAST has been employed to study spatial variation of horizontal rock motion during buffer choke blasting. Patterns of rock motion can be recognized from the discrete element simulations that would be difficult or impossible to recognize in the field (Preece, Tidman and Chung, 1997). Techniques have been developed to calculate ore waste and dilution from the horizontal movement predicted by DMC{underscore}BLAST. Four DMC{underscore}BLAST simulations of buffer blasting have been performed. The blasts are identical except that the burden and spacing are systematically varied which also changes the powder factor. Predictions of ore waste or dilution are made for each burden in the blast, assuming no horizontal movement, to illustrate the spatial variation observed...|$|R

It {{is a part of}} a related project of the Swedish blasting research center named “Model for <b>bench</b> <b>blasting</b> in open pits” and the field tests took place in Boliden’s Aitik copper mine in Gällivare. The goal of this thesis work was to measure the difference in fragmentation caused due to increased specific charge. In order to achieve this, one bench i. e. bench 5162, was divided into two blasting domains. One domain was charged with the normal specific charge used for <b>bench</b> <b>blasting</b> in the mine which is approximately 1 to 1. 1 kg/cu. m., while the other domain had a slightly elevated specific charge close to 1. 35 kg/cu. m [...] A combination of optical methods and lab sieving tests was used to evaluate the fragment size distribution of the blasted material in each blasting domain. The software used {{for the purposes of this}} investigation is “Split Desktop”. Over 250 images of truck – loads were acquired during the loading period of the material, from which, 60 were picked according to a quality criterion formulated and analyzed with the afore-mentioned software suite. In addition to the image analysis, four samples were taken from the muck pile, two from each blasting domain and they were sent for sieving in an accredited laboratory. A compilation of image analysis and laboratory sieving data was used in an attempt to describe the fragment size distribution curve for the material within each blasting domain with the use of the Swebrec function incorporated in the KCO model. The results were satisfactory with the Swebrec function obtaining a fit better than 0. 999 for both domains. Included in the field work was detailed monitoring of the drilling and charging parameters. The results, along with additional information provided by the mine personnel, were used in order to obtain the fragment size distribution estimation of different theoretical models for each blasting domain. For the last part of the investigation, a crusher model for the mine’s primary crusher was made available and its ability to reproduce the fragment size distribution of crushed rock was tested for feeds from different theoretical models.

40|$|In the Mining Industry, Rock Blasting can be {{considered}} as the first phase of comminution. The downstream phases of comminution are mechanical, and consist in consecutive stages of crushing and milling for grain size reduction. The total energy of mechanical comminution depends on grain size and on the resistance of the material to grindability. Usually, the first is quantified by the grains size distribution or one of its KPIs (such as the diameters X 50 or X 80), while the latter by the Working Index (WI), representing the amount of energy necessary {{to reduce the size of}} grains of a determined amount of material to the desired equivalent diameter (usually expressed in kWh/t). It is widely recognized that it is possible to manage the output of a blast in terms of grain size distribution varying specific charge (Powder Factor, P. F.) and charge distribution; specific algorithms such as the KUZ-RAM or the SWEBREC have been created to predict such output. Also, Katzabanis et al. have demonstrated how higher P. Fs. weaken the blasted material by creating micro-fractures that reduce its WI. This paper focuses on a related aspect: the influence of charge distribution on the specific comminution energy in crushing and milling. Small-scale blasts have been performed on 14 limestone blocks with different P. Fs. and charge distribution. For every P. F., charges have been designed to simulate concentraded and distributed geometries. Concentrated charges simulate open-cast blasts with large-diameter holes, with large burdens and spacings. Distributed charges simulate <b>bench</b> <b>blasts</b> with small-diameter holes and reduced burden and spacing. Three control blocks have been fragmented by mechanical means for comparison. For every sample has been determined the grain size distribution, the Crushing Specific Energy and the WI in ball mill. Results confirm the existence of precise correlations between charge distributions and the specific energy of mechanical comminution in crushing and milling. It is finally discussed the opportunity of adjusting charge diameters and distributions in open-cast blasts to improve the output of the comminutions circuit...|$|R
40|$|During recent years, the Australian coal {{industry}} has increasingly used large walking draglines {{as the dominant}} waste removal equipment in open cut coal mines. Because {{of the nature of}} the coal formations, dragline operations in Australian coal mining situations are quite complex and draglines are frequently used in applications beyond their normal capabilities. With the current trend to increasing dragline sizes in most of the Australian coal mines, the draglines become the highest capital investment item in these mines. It is therefore necessary to give detailed attention to the optimising operating procedures of the dragline. Dragline productivity and its stripping capabilities are directly affected by the selection of digging method, strip layout and pit geometry. Every mine has a unique combination of geological conditions. The operating methods that work well at one mine may not necessarily work at another site. Selection of an optimal stripping method, strip layout and pit geometry for a given dragline must be considered with respect to the geological conditions of the mines. With increasing geological complexity of Australian strip mines, it is becoming more important to use sophisticated techniques such as computerised mine planning methods to assist in optimising the dragline operations. A computerised dragline simulation model (CADSIM) has been developed for use in selection of optimum strategies for a dragline operation. The procedure developed links with a geological ore body model to develop a geological database for simulation. CADSIM model can be used in selection the most cost effective dragline digging method. A specific simulation language, 2 ̆ 2 DSLX 2 ̆ 2, was used to program seven common and innovative dragline methods currently used in Australian open cut mines. The DSLX language uses predefined functions to build strip geometry, working <b>benches,</b> <b>blast</b> profiles and spoil piles. The outputs from CADSIM model in form of volumetric, swing angles and hoist distances data were then aggregated with dragline specifications and site time study data to compare productivity and costs of the selected digging methods. The results of two case studies showed that this procedure lends itself to the 2 ̆ 2 optimum 2 ̆ 2 solution for dragline mine planning and design problems for a given coal deposit...|$|R
40|$|Blast-induced {{fragmentation}} plays {{a leading}} role on mining efficiency, hence many {{studies have been conducted}} {{in order to understand the}} mechanisms behind rock breakage and to improve the fragmentation. This report presents the results from field tests conducted at the Aitik mine belonging to Boliden Mineral AB in Sweden, which is part of a project called Vinnova. The project aims to evaluate the effects of short delay time blasting on fragmentation and other post-blast parameters which influence the comminution process, e. g. swelling and crushing. A total number of 6 benches were assigned for trials with different inter-hole delay times. Two of the <b>benches</b> were <b>blasted</b> with pyrotechnic Nonel caps and were used as references for further comparisons. Two <b>benches</b> were <b>blasted</b> with 1 ms of inter-hole delay time by use of electronic detonators. Two other <b>benches</b> were also <b>blasted</b> by electronic detonators, but with 3 ms and 6 ms of inter-hole delay time respectively. MWD (Measure While Drilling) system was used to log and analyze the drilling process in order to investigate the penetration rate and specific energy of drilling, which represent the hardness of the rock. GPS (Global Positioning System) and RTK (Real time Kinematic System) were used for measurements of benches’ swelling. The blasts were also filmed using a high-speed camera. Image analysis with Split-Desktop software was used to analyze the fragmentation of the rock after blasts. A series of images was shot from trucks carrying the ore and was later analyzed to obtain the fragmentation for each bench. Minestar integrated operation and mobile equipment management system was used to log the data from the fleet in the mine. The data were later used together with the crusher energy consumption logs to evaluate the energy efficiency of the crushing process for the ore from each bench. The tests showed that the inter-hole delay time of 3 ms resulted in the finest fragmentation among all benches; all examined values i. e. x 50, x 80 and xmax showed improvements upon other benches. However, the crushing energy of the ore from this trial was the highest among all. Two trials with 1 ms inter-hole delay time did not result in any significant variation compared to reference benches. The difference in x 50 values were ignorable, the same is true for crushing energy of the mentioned trials. The bench with inter-hole delay time of 6 ms resulted in the lowest crushing energy among other trials. However, the bench gave more boulders and coarser fragmentation compared to reference benches. Altogether, the results did not lead to any solid conclusion regarding the effect of the short delay times on fragmentation. Such ambiguity might be resulted by various sources of errors in data acquisition and analysis, as well as uncertainties regarding geology of the test area. In order to investigate the effect of delay times on blast results, more trials with more detailed data acquisition method is necessary. Godkänd; 2013; 20130429 (nikpet...|$|R

40|$|Measurement while {{drilling}} (MWD) {{techniques can}} provide a useful tool to aid drill and blast engineers in open cut mining. By avoiding time consuming tasks such as scan-lines and rock sample collection for laboratory tests, MWD techniques can not only save time but also improve {{the reliability of the}} blast design by providing the drill and blast engineer with the information specially tailored for use. While most mines use a standard blast pattern and charge per blasthole, based on a single rock factor for the entire <b>bench</b> or <b>blast</b> region, information derived from the MWD parameters can improve the blast design by providing more accurate rock properties for each individual blasthole. From this, decisions can be made on the most appropriate type and amount of explosive charge to place in a per blasthole or to optimise the inter-hole timing detonation time of different decks and blastholes. Where real-time calculations are feasible, the system could extend the present blast design even be used to determine the placement of subsequent holes towards a more appropriate blasthole pattern design like asymmetrical blasting...|$|R
40|$|This paper probed {{into the}} whole height <b>bench</b> cast <b>blasting</b> process and {{described}} the influence factors from 3 major perspectives: natural geological, blasting scheming and factitious ones, and selected the throwing rate which was generally accepted in the cast blasting field to assess the blasting performance. Then a novel GA-SVM model was constructed to analyze the real collected explosion data from open pit mining, and verified in a certain open-pit. Also the MIV method was employed to analyze the influence factor at each input factor. The study indicate that: (1) the presented GA-SVM model performs more robust and accurate than other artificial intelligence models such as BP, RBF, GRNN and GA-BP, which has a more stable prediction accuracy of 83. 75 %. Moreover, due to the ubiquitous paradigm of the presented approach, it provides a single, unified approach to evaluating other blasting performance {{factors such as the}} longest thrown distance and loose coefficient etc; (2) for this certain open pit which maintains a steady lithological character and design parameters, the bench height, explosive specific charge possess a positive correlation coefficient with the throwing rate, while line of least resistance, the slope angle and the profile width perform the opposite...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} {{the results of}} research aimed to monitor, predict and minimize the ground vibrations induced by blasting in an open pit limestone quarry in Italy. Data on 135 vibrations taken from 18 production blasts and 2 signature blasts were examined, including {{the effects of the}} <b>bench</b> orientations. <b>Blast</b> vibrations at the quarry were monitored for approximately three months. The blast vibration magnitudes and frequencies and their effects were analysed by both the conventional PPV concept and a software that is able to predict the vibration amplitudes of a production blast at the target sites by modelling signature blast data. The results have been rated and classifi ed considering the peak particle velocities (PPV) measured in a number of critical areas near the quarry. A comparative analysis between the results predicted by the software and actual blast results was carried out. The benefi ts of the software were then highlighted, proving able to predict ground vibrations induced by blasting more reliably than the conventional site laws. Finally, based on the results, some arrangements were provided for two bench geometries employed at the quarry site...|$|R
40|$|A {{case study}} is {{presented}} that relates statistical descriptions of joint sets to the distribution of local wedge failures along {{the crest of a}} catch bench at the Yellowstone Talc Mine. The fracture sets and bench width were mapped by teams of geological engineering students from Montana Tech under the direction of Dr. Mary MacLaughlin. The students analyzed the fracture data, conducted physical property tests, and used a beta version of a NIOSH program Bwedge to predict the distribution of surviving bench widths. In the course of this analysis the students developed evidence of software performance issues that, unfortunately, frustrated their analysis. These have now been addressed and a full analysis completed. The analysis confirms the validity of the student mapping program and provides insight into the effects of blasting and excavation practices on the bench. It also provides a tool for exploring the pattern of bench crest failure that would result from variations in both <b>bench</b> geometry and <b>blasting</b> practices...|$|R
30|$|The {{optimization}} {{is achieved}} by considering the entire mining system {{instead of focusing on}} a single subsystem. By this way, the relationship among the interrelated subsystems in open-cast mining operations is considered in the optimization model. The methodology was applied in an open-cast coal mine. The evolutionary algorithm was used in the optimization of the fragmentation size and hole diameter. The results of the case study show that the total mining cost is reduced $ 26, 641 for the bench which corresponds a 16.8 % decrease for one mining bench. If the usage of this methodology is extended to the other <b>blasting</b> <b>benches</b> throughout the mine, the total gain increases. Furthermore, the results of the sensitivity analysis show that the total mining cost highly depends on the unit cost of haul trucks, explosive cost and electricity price. The unit cost of loaders and drilling machines does not {{have a significant effect on}} the total mining cost.|$|R
40|$|The Advanced Concepts Group of Sandia National Laboratories {{hosted a}} workshop, ''FOILFest: Community Enabled Security'', on July 18 - 21, 2005, in Albuquerque, NM. This was a {{far-reaching}} {{look into the}} future of physical protection consisting {{of a series of}} structured brainstorming sessions focused on preventing and foiling attacks on public places and soft targets such as airports, shopping malls, hotels, and public events. These facilities are difficult to protect using traditional security devices since they could easily be pushed out of business through the addition of arduous and expensive security measures. The idea behind this Fest was to explore how the public, which is vital to the function of these institutions, can be leveraged as part of a physical protection system. The workshop considered procedures, space design, and approaches for building community through technology. The workshop explored ways to make the ''good guys'' in public places feel safe and be vigilant while making potential perpetrators of harm feel exposed and convinced that they will not succeed. Participants in the Fest included operators of public places, social scientists, technology experts, representatives of government agencies including DHS and the intelligence community, writers and media experts. Many innovative ideas were explored during the fest with most of the time spent on airports, including consideration of the local airport, the Albuquerque Sunport. Some provocative ideas included: (1) sniffers installed in passage areas like revolving door, escalators, (2) a ''jumbotron'' showing current camera shots in the public space, (3) transparent portal screeners allowing viewing of the screening, (4) a layered open/funnel/open/funnel design where open spaces are used to encourage a sense of ''communitas'' and take advantage of citizen ''sensing'' and funnels are technological tunnels of sensors (the tunnels of truth), (5) curved <b>benches</b> with <b>blast</b> proof walls or backs, (6) making it easy for the public to report, even if not sure/''non-event'' (e. g. ''I'm uncomfortable'') and processing those reports in aggregate not individually, (7) transforming the resident working population into a part-time undercover security/sensor force through more innovative training and (8) adding ambassadors/security that engage in unexpected conversation with the public. The group recommended that we take actions to pursue the following ideas next: (a) A concept for a mobile sensor transport (JMP); (b) Conduct a follow-on workshop; (c) Conduct social experiments/activities to see how people would react to the concepts related to community and security; (d) Explore further aesthetically pleasing, blast-resistance seating areas; and (e) The Art of Freedom (an educational, multi-media campaign) ...|$|R
