Girls attend school less regularly than <b>boys</b> <b>do</b> because of cultural attitudes, domestic duties, early marriage, pregnancy, and sexual harassment. Although attendance rates are higher in the south, a disproportionate number of teachers are stationed there, leaving northern schools chronically understaffed.|$|E

We walked up the middle of the {{principal}} street, and these vermin surrounded us on all sides, and glared upon us; and every moment excited couples shot ahead of the procession to get a good look back, just as village <b>boys</b> <b>do</b> when they accompany the elephant on his advertising trip from street to street.|$|E
25|$|When {{comparing}} the sexual self-concepts of adolescent girls and boys, {{researchers found that}} boys experienced lower sexual self-esteem and higher sexual anxiety. The boys stated they were less able to refuse or resist sex at a greater rate than the girls reported having difficulty with this. The authors state {{that this may be}} because society places so much emphasis on teaching girls how to be resistant towards sex, that boys don’t learn these skills and are less able to use them when they want to say no to sex. They also explain how society’s stereotype that boys are always ready to desire sex and be aroused may contribute to the fact that many boys may not feel comfortable resisting sex, because it is something society tells them they should want. Because society expects adolescent boys to be assertive, dominant and in control, they are limited in how they feel it is appropriate to act within a romantic relationship. Many boys feel lower self-esteem when they can’t attain these hyper-masculine ideals that society says they should. Additionally, there is not much guidance on how boys should act within relationships and many <b>boys</b> <b>do</b> not know how to retain their masculinity while being authentic and reciprocating affection in their relationships. This difficult dilemma is called the double-edged sword of masculinity by some researchers.|$|E

The boys actively try to court Ms. Ellen, but Chef (having beaten them to it) warns them she is a lesbian and thus only likes other lesbians. The <b>boys</b> <b>do</b> not realise what this means and try to become lesbians {{in order to attract}} Ms. Ellen. Meanwhile, Mr. Garrison's nose job makes him a [...] "hot and sexy" [...] man, with his face resembling David Hasselhoff, and he decides to quit teaching to pursue women. Stan wins the dinner (much to Wendy's dismay), but finds out that Ms. Ellen has no intention of making love with him. Wendy however sees them through the window and leaves distraught.

The boys become inadvertently trapped in the novel for decades, though time basically stands still for them.

2500|$|Another {{study found}} that it was not {{uncommon}} for adolescent girls in relationships to report they felt little desire to engage in sexual activity when they were in relationships. However, many girls engaged in sexual activity even if they did not desire it, in order to avoid what they think might place strains on their relationships. The researcher states that this may be because of society's pressure on girls to be [...] "good girls"; the pressure to be [...] "good" [...] may make adolescent girls think they are not supposed to feel desire like <b>boys</b> <b>do.</b> Even when girls said they did feel sexual desire, they said that they felt like they were not supposed to, and often tried to cover up their feelings. This {{is an example of how}} societal expectations about gender can impact adolescent sexual functioning.|$|E
2500|$|In the Indian sociocultural milieu {{girls have}} less access to parental love, schools, {{opportunities}} for self-development {{and freedom of}} movement than <b>boys</b> <b>do.</b> It {{has been argued that}} they may rebel against this lack of access or seek out affection through physical relationships with boys. [...] While the data reflects trends to support this theory, it is inconclusive. [...] The freedom to communicate with adolescent boys was restricted for girls regardless of whether they lived in an urban or rural setting, and regardless of whether they went to school or not. [...] More urban girls than rural girls discussed sex with their friends. [...] Those who did not may have felt [...] "the subject of sexuality in itself is considered an 'adult issue' and a taboo or it may be that some respondents were wary of revealing such personal information." ...|$|E

2500|$|Football is {{the most}} popular women's sport in the country. [...] In schools, girls and <b>boys</b> <b>do</b> not play mixed {{football}} in Somalia. [...] On the adult level, there are 450 teams, 8 of which are available to women to play as mixed gendered teams and 6 which are women only. In 2000, there were 280 registered female players on the junior and senior levels. [...] This data was not kept from 2001 to 2004. [...] In 2005, there were 1,435 registered female players but in 2006, the number dropped dramatically to 220. This can be contrasted to futsal where there were 175 registered female footballers and 440 unregistered footballers in 2006. In 2005, football was seen as a way to potentially help rebuild the country, with the concept having support from Somali women living abroad. Women from Djibouti have been working to help Somali play football. [...] Muslim extremists inside the country have made it difficult for women to play because of restrictions on what women can do. Inside Somalia, women have been completely prohibited from playing any sport. Rights to broadcast the 2011 Women's World Cup in the country were bought by Al Jazeera, despite the government having banned people from watching the men's competition in 2006 which resulted in several deaths.|$|E
2500|$|Through ethnographic {{research}} {{in a high}} school setting, CJ Pascoe examines how American high school boys use the term fag. Pascoe's work suggests that boys in high school use the fag epithet as a way to assert their own masculinity, by claiming that another boy is less masculine; this, in their eyes, makes him a fag, and its usage suggests that it is less about sexual orientation and more about gender. One-third of the boys in Pascoe's study claimed that they would not call a homosexual peer a fag; fag is used in this setting as a form of gender policing, in which boys ridicule others who fail at masculinity, heterosexual prowess, or strength. Because <b>boys</b> <b>do</b> not want to be labeled a fag, they hurl the insult at another person. The fag identity does not constitute a static identity attached to the boy receiving the insult. Rather, fag is a fluid identity that boys strive to avoid, often by naming another as the fag. As Pascoe asserts, [...] " [...] is fluid enough that boys police their behaviors out of fear of having the fag identity permanently adhere and definitive enough so that boys recognize a fag behavior and strive to avoid it". Pascoe's study reports that gender policing is most common among white boys, while black boys are more concerned with [...] "acting" [...] black. The black youth in Pascoe's study often ridiculed one another for [...] "acting white", and did not express gender policing to the same degree as white boys.|$|E
