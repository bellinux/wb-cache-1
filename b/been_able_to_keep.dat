Though Engel had not <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the show from being named Saved by the Bell, {{he was determined to}} prevent the phrase from showing up in the theme. He gave explicit orders to his team of composers that he would not accept any theme that referenced the title, and the group agreed to leave out the phrase.|$|E
25|$|The joining {{of the two}} crowns {{deprived}} Portugal of {{a separate}} foreign policy, with King Phillip II's enemies becoming Portugal's enemies as well. War with the Dutch led to attacks on most of Portugal's far-flung trading network in and around Asia, including Ceylon (modern Sri Lanka), and Goa, as well as attacks upon her commercial interests in Japan, Africa (especially Mina), and South America. Even though the Portuguese {{had never been able}} to capture the entire island of Ceylon, they had <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the coastal regions under their control for a considerable time before the coming of the Dutch in war. Portugal's South American colony, Brazil, was partially conquered by both France and the United Provinces.|$|E

When lately north of the Arkansas, some young Cheyennes were fired upon and then the fight began.

But we all want peace, and I would be glad to move all my people down this way; I could then keep them all quietly near camp. My camp is now on the Washita, 40 miles east of the Antelope Hills, and I have there about 180 lodges. I speak only for my own people; I cannot speak nor control the Cheyennes north of the Arkansas.|$|E

25|$|To {{moderate}} the damage, {{there have been}} {{both public and private}} reforestation efforts. In 2005, forty families worked to plant 1,000 new trees in the Bosque de Tlalpan as part of an annual event sponsored by ecological associations such as Cultura Integral Forestal and Ciencia Cultura y Bosques. This annual event takes place in early July during the beginning of the rainy season and has been repeated for over twenty years. The event was initially sponsored by the Cultura Integral Forestal, made up of principally ex employees of the Loreto y Peña Pobre paper factory. Replanting efforts are focused on the main mountains of the Bosque de Tlalpan as well as the Tenantongo Valley in the same forest, planting mostly holm oak and ash trees. The annual effort has reforested over 1,500 hectares, using seeds encased in a clay ball designed to protect the seed and allow its germination. However, reforestation efforts have not <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> up with the deforestation of much of the borough.|$|E

There is Bob Strange, the Third Master, a bureaucrat unpopular with the pupils who has been trying for years to get rid of Straitley and force him into early retirement ("Young blood is cheaper."). There are the members of the German department ("Teutons", according to the old Latin master), among them Geoff and Penny ("League of") Nations, a married couple described by Straitley as hypocrites and sycophants.

25|$|Meanwhile, Henry {{goes to the}} Jolly Roger {{to recruit}} Hook and finds that the pirate is now {{employed}} by Captain Blackbeard. With this new Hook lacking in bravery, Henry has {{to take care of}} Blackbeard himself, before telling Hook that he must help him rescue his mother, Emma, from the tower. Henry and Hook sail to the tower and proceed to knock out the dark guard on duty. When Henry reaches Emma at the top, he is surprised to find that she has <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> her memories as part of a cruel curse. As the trio escape on the ship, Emma, while getting to know Hook, explains that the guard they knocked out was none other than Lily, who has the ability to transform into a dragon. Emma and Hook are able to shoot her down into the ocean with a cannon before she attacks. When they make a pit stop at a village, the three are caught by Snow and Charming, whom Lily had informed of their location. Since Snow does not acknowledge Emma as her daughter, she plans to kill both Emma and Henry. Hook, with no experience wielding a sword, tries to defend them. He battles Charming, and surprisingly defeats him by disarming him. After Hook is distracted, Charming is able to sneak upon him and fatally stab him in front of Emma.|$|E

500|$|The Roman main charge {{would likely}} have been preceded by harassing attacks by the light cavalry. The mounted archers would execute what the Romans knew as the [...] "Parthian attack": ride up to within range of the enemy, loose a volley of arrows, then hastily retreat, using the arrow {{distance}} to escape pursuit. This could be repeated several times, causing significant casualties and, ideally, enticing the enemy into a premature and disorganised charge. However, in this case, the German cavalry would have been prevented from charging as their interspersed infantry support would not have <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> up—most likely, they awaited the Roman cavalry at the halt, or moved forward slowly.|$|E

500|$|The Manfred Symphony {{would cost}} Tchaikovsky more time, effort and soul-searching than {{anything}} else he would write, even the Pathetique Symphony. It also became the longest, most complex work he had written up to that point, and though it owes an obvious debt to Berlioz due to its program, Tchaikovsky {{was still able to}} make the theme of Manfred his own. Near the end of seven months of intensive effort, in late September 1885, he wrote Balakirev, [...] "Never in my life, believe me, have I labored so long and hard, and felt so drained by my efforts.

500|$|Thomas was {{described}} by her doctor George Henry Rudd as [...] "a small, well-dressed lady" [...] who was about fifty-four years old. Elliot O'Donnell, summing up contemporary accounts {{in his introduction to}} a transcript of Webster's trial, said that Thomas had an [...] "excitable temperament" [...] and was regarded by her neighbours as eccentric. She frequently travelled, leaving her friends and relatives unaware of her whereabouts for weeks or months at a time. She {{was a member of the}} lower middle class and as such was not wealthy, but she habitually dressed up and wore jewellery to give the impression of prosperity. Her desire to employ a live-in domestic servant probably had as much to do with status as with practicality. However, she had a reputation for being a harsh employer and her irregular habits meant that she had difficulty finding and retaining servants. Before 1879, she had only <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> one maid for any length of time.|$|E

If you don't cry watching this episode, there's a tiny little rock where your heart should be." [...] On a similar list, TV Line ranked the episode third, only behind [...] "A Trip to the Dentist" [...] and [...] "Pilot". Give Me My Remote also ranked the episode as {{the best of the}} series, writing, [...] "If I had to pick a single episode to represent the show, this would be it. The actual plot of this episode was compelling, fast-paced, and the twist at the end was shocking." [...] The reviewer went on to praise Kristen Bell's performance and the less action-heavy parts of the episode.|$|E

[...] He and his son, Carlton, backed out in May 2000, preferring to take their chances at trial due to the likelihood of light punishment for first-time offenders.

Father Brown is perpetually correcting the incorrect vision of the bewildered folks {{at the scene of the}} crime and wandering off at the end with the criminal to exercise his priestly role of recognition and repentance. For example, in the story [...] "The Flying Stars", Father Brown entreats the character Flambeau to give up his life of crime: [...] "There is still youth and honour and humour in you; don't fancy they will last in that trade.

An echo of this may be found in the description of Field by John Dunmore Lang as a [...] "weak silly man who fancied himself a poet born". Sir Thomas Brisbane, writing to Earl Bathurst in January 1824, stated that Field [...] "had embraced every opportunity of falsely and foully slandering me and my government". But Brisbane could be irascible if he thought his honour or dignity was touched, and his first ground of complaint appears to have been that [...] "during his first two years in the colony, Field had never once entered Government House". However, word was already on the way to Brisbane that Field had been recalled, and Lamb, writing at the end of 1824, mentions that [...] "Barron Field is come home from Sydney.
