5|$|The tag team {{championship}} match came next, {{which saw}} the Beverly Brothers (Beau and <b>Blake)</b> attack the Natural Disasters (Earthquake and Typhoon) before the bell.

Typhoon recovered and clotheslined both opponents {{but was unable to}} tag in Earthquake. Later, Typhoon tried to tag again, but Beau distracted Earthquake; while the referee's back was turned, The Beverlys' manager, The Genius handed <b>Blake</b> a metal scroll, which <b>Blake</b> used to hit Typhoon. Typhoon recovered, however, and Earthquake entered the ring and controlled the remainder of the match. He performed a powerslam on Beau before pinning him with an Earthquake splash.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} amend and extend Keri Davies’s essay on <b>Blake’s</b> mother {{published}} in Blake/An Illustrated Quarterly in 1999. There, he established that <b>Blake’s</b> mother Catherine’s true maiden name was Wright, and that Thomas Armitage, her first husband, {{was born in}} Royston, Yorkshire in 1722, the son of Richard Armitage of Cudworth. Davies also produced evidence that contradicted E. P. Thompson’s Muggletonian hypothesis, and speculated upon the identity of <b>Blake’s</b> maternal grandparents. We now link <b>Blake’s</b> mother to a very different religious community, providing further evidence about her first marriage, and correcting the assumptions Davies made in identifying <b>Blake’s</b> grandparents. These latest discoveries about <b>Blake’s</b> mother disclose her place of birth (Walkeringham, Nottinghamshire), the names of her parents and siblings, and her association with the Moravian sect. Documentary and autographic records in the archive of the distinctive and exceptional eighteenth-century Moravian church, some dating from many years before the poet was born, are a vivid indicator of how much of our thinking about <b>Blake’s</b> life and early influences might need to be revised and rewritten in the future...|$|R
