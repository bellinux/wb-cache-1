40|$|Blood is {{the most}} {{important}} <b>by-product</b> <b>of</b> <b>slaughtering.</b> It consists predominantly of protein and water and is a valuable protein resource. The protein content in blood from domestic meat animals is equivalent to 6 - 7 % of the lean meat content in the carcass. Regarding the nutritionally valuable composition of blood and the large amounts of slaughterhouse blood, utilization of blood seems to be reasonable. A requirement for blood utilized in human consumption is its hygienic collection. Coagulation of freshly drawn blood is prevented by the addition of sodium citrate. Centrifugation of the treated blood yields a thickblood fraction (red cell fraction) and a light coloured plasma fraction. Blood plasma is used as food additive in meat industry. Thickblood which contains the major portion of the protein content (60 - 70 wt%) cannot be used for human nutrition because of its dark red colour. The intense red colour caused by the hemoglobin content of blood is aesthetically objectionable to a majority of the world's population when considering this product as a potential foodstuff. Therefore a decolorization treatment must be performed in order to remove the heme pigment from the globin moiety. If the protein preparation is used as food additive, heme should be removed almost completely because of its catalytic activity which leads to autoxidation processes of lipids...|$|R

Information sources related to the utilization of goatskin as a raw material for food packaging are still lacking. One of type of food packaging that environmental friendly was edible film. One of the advantages of edible film as the packaging material is can be consumed along with the product, so that no waste. Edible films need to be developing as an effort to create an environment zero waste. In the formation, process of edible film requires a precise formulation in order to form a mass that is able to function properly. Edible film formation influenced by the type and composition of the constituent materials. One of using collagen as an edible film today is as a packaging in the meat industry (Wang et al., 2015). The use of whey protein combined with glycerol also been developed as a packaging material (Perez et al., 2016). During this time, the manufacture of edible film comes from of starch, whereas, the basic ingredient of the protein has not been widely used. Edible films of three types of material (glycerol, starch and gum nuts) developed as a composite packaging material for fruit products (Saberi et al., 2016). The use of essential oils incorporated to carrageenan as material for edible film developed by Soni et al. (2015) as the packaging material in the chicken patties product. Edible films are one of packaging products that environmental friendly. Edible films can produce from the <b>by-products</b> <b>of</b> the <b>slaughtering</b> <b>of</b> livestock locally. Edible films used as materials packaging of foodstuff to protect food products of contamination of air, light, lipid, dissolved substances and microorganisms. One of the main advantages of edible film packaging is a natural character, so it can consume together with such food products. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the properties of edible film that produced from a combination of collagen extracts from glycerol as a plasticizer.

40|$|Abstract Background Numerous models, of {{variable}} quality, exist to impart the complex skills {{required to perform}} vascular anastomosis. These models differ {{with regard to the}} kinds of materials used, as well as their sizes, the time needed for their preparation, their availability, and the associated costs. The present study describes a bench model that uses formalin-fixed porcine aorta, and its evaluation by young surgical residents during a recent skills course. Findings The aortic segments used were a <b>by-product</b> <b>of</b> <b>slaughtering.</b> They were fixed and stored after harvesting for eventual use. Ten young surgical residents participated, and each performed one end-to-side vascular anastomosis. The evaluation was a questionnaire maintaining anonymity of the participant containing questions addressing particular aspects of the model and the experiences of the trainee, along with their ratings concerning the need for a training course to learn vascular anastomosis techniques. The scoring on the survey was done using a global 6 -point rating scale (Likert Scale). In addition, we ranked the present model by reviewing the current literature for models that address vascular anastomosis skills. The trainees who participated were within their first two years of training (1. 25 ± 0. 46). A strong agreement in terms of the necessity of training for vascular anastomosis techniques was evident among the participating trainees (5. 90 ± 0. 32), who had only few prior manual experiences (total number 1. 50 ± 0. 53). The query revealed a strong agreement that porcine aorta is a suitable model that fits the needs for training vascular anastomosis skills (5. 70 ± 0. 48). Only a few bench models designed to teach surgical residents vascular anastomosis techniques were available in the literature. Conclusions The preparatory and financial resources needed to perform anastomosis skills training using porcine aorta are few. The presented bench model appears to be appropriate for learning vascular anastomosis skills, as rated by the surgical trainees themselves. </p...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a theoretical model of livestock and meat exports from Upper Volta. The model is depicted graphically, showing {{the existence of}} jointly-determined unique equilibrium levels of live-animal and meat exports given costs and relevant demands for meat and offals. The model shows how conditions leading to {{a greater proportion of}} meat to live-animal exports are self-braking because of the interrelationship of domestic and export markets and explains the observation of declining meat exports in periods of rising prices. The cause of this phenomenon is shown to be the price <b>of</b> non-tradable <b>by-products</b> <b>of</b> cattle <b>slaughtered</b> in Upper Volta for export as meat. The paper examines the impact of a series of exogenous effects on meat exports. The most important policy conclusion is that exogenous changes favoring either mode of export tend to be restricted in their effect by the self-braking nature of the system. The greatest likelihood for promoting increased meat exports from Upper Volta appears to be increasing the capacity to process and export offals and decreasing the transportation costs of meat relative to live animals...|$|R
40|$|Methane is {{produced}} during the anaerobic degradation of greaves and rinds, two <b>by-products</b> <b>of</b> pig <b>slaughter</b> and meat-processing industry. However, although values of 914 ± 37 and 664 ± 35 m 3 CH 4 ton- 1 waste (wet weight) respectively were obtained, the degradation rate in batch assays {{was slow and}} lasted between 25 and 30 days. Therefore, {{in order to assess}} the potential increase in the biodegradation rate and biodegradability of these substrates, physical (temperature), chemical (alkali) and enzymatic (lipase) pre-treatments were tested. Partial hydrolysis was achieved for all the conditions applied but the efficiency was higher in alkaline and enzymatic treatments. These conditions produced hydrolysates with higher soluble+colloidal COD, long-chain fatty acids and ammonia concentrations, comparatively with the other treatments applied. Enzymatic hydrolysis increased 14 % the methane production potential of the rinds, and this increase was even higher (80 %) when rinds were thermally treated before addition of the enzyme. With all other pre-treatments, anaerobic biodegradability of both wastes was not improved comparatively to the raw materials. Alkaline conditions induced a severe decreased (89 %) of rinds’ biodegradability. Enzymatic pre-treatment appears to be a promising strategy for increasing methane production from meat-processing wastes...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis {{study was}} carried out to assess the energy {{recovery}} potential from organic industrial <b>by-products</b> <b>of</b> a cattle <b>slaughtering</b> facility. There are several processes to convert organic material to energy; the technology {{of interest in this}} study was anaerobic digestion, the biological conversion of degradable organic material into methane. The scenario was initially confined to a full scale cattle slaughtering facility processing 3. 28 % <b>of</b> heads <b>slaughtered</b> in Ireland. The methane potential of dissolved air flotation sludge, paunch, soft offal as well as a mixed waste stream (combination of individual waste streams) was determined through a series of biochemical methane potential assays under mesophilic conditions. The methane potential of the characterised waste streams ranged from 49. 5 to 650. 9  mLCH 4  gVS− 1. The potential energy recovery from the mixed waste stream resulted in the prospective subsidy of 100 % of the energy demands <b>of</b> the <b>slaughtering</b> facility as well as the energy demands for the production of the biogas. When investigating the impact of energy recovery from the entire sector the potential energy recovery equated to 1. 63 % of the final energy demands of the Irish industrial sector. This could potentially increase the RES in Ireland from 7. 8 % to 8. 13 % contributing to both RES-E and RES-H...|$|R
40|$|Blood, a {{valuable}} <b>by-product</b> <b>of</b> livestock <b>slaughter,</b> has numerous food, industrial, and pharmaceutical uses. Physical and rheological properties, including apparent viscosity, density, surface tension, thermal conductivity, and specific heat, {{are needed for}} the design of transport processes and by-product applications such as spray drying, blending, and extrusion. Information about these properties for slaughter by-products, however, is not currently available. Consequently, the objective {{of this study was to}} determine these properties for anticoagulated swine blood, blood plasma, and red blood cells between 5 and 35 °C. The plasma in this study was enriched with hemoglobin from the red cells as a result of the rupture of red cells during frozen storage of the blood. These fluids all exhibited a pseudoplastic behavior which was affected by both shear rate and temperature; a nonlinear regression model which accounted for both factors was then determined for each fluid. In addition, these fluids all had density values 1. 0 to 6. 3 % higher, and surface tension values 20. 7 to 33. 0 % lower, than the respective values for water at temperatures between 5 and 35 °C. Thermal conductivity results were 42. 0 to 57. 0 % lower, and specific heat results were 9. 0 to 17. 4 % lower, than the respective values for water at each temperature.
