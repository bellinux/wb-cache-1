5|$|There {{are several}} {{technologies}} in use {{to achieve the}} flashing effect. These include flashing a light bulb or LED, flashing or rotating halogen, and strobe lights, which are usually brighter than incandescent lights. Each of these can <b>be</b> <b>programmed</b> <b>to</b> flash singly or in groups, and can <b>be</b> <b>programmed</b> <b>to</b> flash in patterns (such as a left -> right pattern for use when the ambulance is parked on the left hand side of the road, indicating to other road users that they should move to the right (away from the ambulance)). Incandescent and LED lights may also <b>be</b> <b>programmed</b> <b>to</b> burn steadily, without flashing, which is required in some provinces.|$|E
5|$|Emergency lights may be {{housed in}} special fittings, {{such as in}} a lightbar, or may be hidden in a host light (such as a headlamp) by {{drilling}} {{a hole in the}} host light's reflector and inserting the emergency light. These hidden lights may not be apparent until they are activated. Additionally, some of the standard lights fitted to an ambulance (e.g. headlamps, tail lamps) may <b>be</b> <b>programmed</b> <b>to</b> flash. Flashing headlights (typically the high beams, flashed alternately) are known as a wig-wag.|$|E
5|$|For {{the shot}} of the levitating truck, which {{was used in the}} film to {{demonstrate}} the strange phenomena brought on by the coming of the alignment of the worlds, filmmakers attached a cement truck to a large hydraulic rig, which could <b>be</b> <b>programmed</b> <b>to</b> change speed and movement. In order to create Algrim's transformation into Kurse, Double Negative morphed live action performances of Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as both Algrim and Kurse. Double Negative then added in smoke and lava-like effects.|$|E

5|$|Of {{the moons}} {{discovered}} by the Voyager2 imaging team, only Puck was discovered early enough that the probe could <b>be</b> <b>programmed</b> <b>to</b> image it in some detail. Images showed that Puck has a shape of a slightly prolate spheroid (ratio between axes is 0.97±0.04). Its surface is heavily cratered and is grey in color. There are three named craters {{on the surface of}} Puck, the largest being about 45km in diameter. Observations with the Hubble Space Telescope and large terrestrial telescopes found water-ice absorption features in the spectrum of Puck.|$|E
5|$|A {{wind energy}} {{penetration}} figure {{can be specified}} for different duration of time, but is often quoted annually. To obtain 100% from wind annually requires substantial long term storage or substantial interconnection to other systems which may already have substantial storage. On a monthly, weekly, daily, or hourly basis—or less—wind might supply as much as or more than 100% of current use, with the rest stored or exported. Seasonal industry might then take advantage of high wind and low usage times such as at night when wind output can exceed normal demand. Such industry might include production of silicon, aluminum, steel, or of natural gas, and hydrogen, and using future long term storage to facilitate 100% energy from variable renewable energy. Homes can also <b>be</b> <b>programmed</b> <b>to</b> accept extra electric power on demand, for example by remotely turning up water heater thermostats.|$|E

25|$|Alumni {{members of}} the former Bounders Fraternity raised nearly $30,000 in {{donations}} {{for the purchase of}} a Van Bergen 49-bell carillon. The Bounder Bells was dedicated on the UMKC campus in May 1989. The carillon is located in the tower of the Swinney Recreation Center. The bells controlled by an electronic keyboard, and they ring on the hour. The bells can also can <b>be</b> <b>programmed</b> <b>to</b> play melodies.|$|E

25|$|Robby the Robot in Forbidden Planet (1956) has a {{hierarchical}} command structure which keeps him from harming humans, even when ordered to do so, as such orders cause a conflict and lock-up {{very much in}} the manner of Asimov's robots.

Asimov was delighted with Robby and noted that Robby appeared to <b>be</b> <b>programmed</b> <b>to</b> follow his Three Laws.|$|E
25|$|Auditory repellents are {{commonly}} used in both agricultural and aviation contexts. Devices such as propane exploders (cannons), pyrotechnics, and bioacoustics are frequently deployed on airports. Propane exploders are capable of creating noises of approximately 130 decibels (Wildlife Control Supplies). They can <b>be</b> <b>programmed</b> <b>to</b> fire at designated intervals, can be remote controlled, or motion activated. Due to their stationary and often predictable nature, wildlife quickly become habituated to propane cannons. Lethal control {{may be used to}} extend the effectiveness of propane exploders (Washburn et al. 2006).|$|E
25|$|The Monroe Epic {{programmable}} calculator {{came on the}} market in 1967. A large, printing, desk-top unit, with an attached floor-standing logic tower, it could <b>be</b> <b>programmed</b> <b>to</b> perform many computer-like functions. However, the only branch instruction was an implied unconditional branch (GOTO) {{at the end of the}} operation stack, returning the program to its starting instruction. Thus, it was not possible to include any conditional branch (IF-THEN-ELSE) logic. During this era, the absence of the conditional branch was sometimes used to distinguish a {{programmable calculator}} from a computer.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, diving {{stores were}} finding a purely {{economic}} reason to offer nitrox: {{not only was}} an entire new course and certification needed to use it, but instead of cheap or free tank fills with compressed air, dive shops found they could charge premium amounts of money for custom-gas blending of nitrox to their ordinary, moderately experienced divers. With the new dive computers which could <b>be</b> <b>programmed</b> <b>to</b> allow for the longer bottom-times and shorter residual nitrogen times that nitrox gave, the incentive for the sport diver to use the gas increased. An intersection of economics and scientific validity had occurred.|$|E
25|$|A bank {{might be}} {{interested}} in minimizing the amount of money it borrows overnight from a central bank. Interbank transfers must be communicated and arranged through automation by a set time each business day. The failure of any vital communication could cost the bank large sums in interest charged by the central bank. A BAM solution would <b>be</b> <b>programmed</b> <b>to</b> become aware of each message and await confirmation. Failure to receive confirmation within a reasonable amount of time would be grounds for the BAM solution to raise an alarm that would set in motion manual intervention to investigate the cause of the delay and to push the problem toward resolution before it becomes costly.|$|E
25|$|LC-MS {{is widely}} used {{in the field of}} {{bioanalysis}} and is specially involved in pharmacokinetic studies of pharmaceuticals. Pharmacokinetic studies are needed to determine how quickly a drug will be cleared from the body organs and the hepatic blood flow. MS analyzers are useful in these studies because of their shorter analysis time, and higher sensitivity and specificity compared to UV detectors commonly attached to HPLC systems. One major advantage is the use of tandem MS-MS, where the detector may <b>be</b> <b>programmed</b> <b>to</b> select certain ions to fragment. The measured quantity is the sum of molecule fragments chosen by the operator. As long as there are no interferences or ion suppression, the LC separation can be quite quick.|$|E

25|$|In December 2008, the CTO of Blitz Games {{announced}} that it would bring stereoscopic 3D gaming and movie viewing to Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 with its own technology. This was first demonstrated publicly on PS3 using Sony's own technology in January 2009 at the Consumer Electronics Show. Journalists were shown Wipeout HD and Gran Turismo 5 Prologue in 3D as a demonstration of how the technology might work if it is implemented in the future. Firmware update 3.30 officially allowed PS3 titles to be played in 3D, requiring a compatible display for use. System software update 3.50 prepared it for 3D films. While the game itself must <b>be</b> <b>programmed</b> <b>to</b> take advantage of the 3D technology, titles may be patched to add in the functionality retroactively. Titles with such patches include Wipeout HD, Pain, and Super Stardust HD.|$|E
25|$|Parallel hybrids, such as Honda's Insight, Civic, and Accord hybrids, can {{simultaneously}} {{transmit power}} to their drive wheels from two distinct sources—for example, an {{internal combustion engine}} and a battery-powered electric drive. Although most parallel hybrids incorporate an electric motor between the vehicle's engine and transmission, a parallel hybrid can also use its engine to drive one of the vehicle's axles, while its electric motor drives the other axle and/or a generator used for recharging the batteries. This type is called a road-coupled hybrid. The Audi Duo plug-in hybrid concept car {{is an example of}} this type of parallel hybrid architecture. Parallel hybrids can <b>be</b> <b>programmed</b> <b>to</b> use the electric motor to substitute for the ICE at lower power demands as well as to substantially increase the power available to a smaller ICE, both of which substantially increase fuel economy compared to a simple ICE vehicle.|$|E
25|$|ENIAC could <b>be</b> <b>programmed</b> <b>to</b> perform complex {{sequences}} of operations, including loops, branches, and subroutines. However, {{instead of the}} stored program computers that exist today, ENIAC was just a large collection of arithmetic machines, which had programs hard coded into the machines with function tables that each contained 1200 ten way switches. The task of taking a problem and mapping it onto the machine was complex, and usually took weeks. Due {{to the complexity of}} mapping programs onto the machine, programs were only changed after huge numbers of tests of the current program. After the program was figured out on paper, the process of getting the program into ENIAC by manipulating its switches and cables could take days. This was followed by a period of verification and debugging, aided by the ability to execute the program step by step. A programming tutorial for the modulo function using an ENIAC simulator gives an impression of what a program on the ENIAC looked like.|$|E
