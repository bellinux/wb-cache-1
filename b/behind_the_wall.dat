The program also depicts the two-year conflict between The Fifth Estate and CSC to broadcast more footage of the last days of Ashley Smith.|$|E
5|$|A {{reconnaissance}} {{party of}} 30 men was sent {{out from behind}} the third stone wall to see if the British would try and flank the American position. The party ran into the British, who had continued to advance, and they fell back to the stone wall. The Americans <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> fired one volley before Glover gave the order to retreat. The Americans retreated across a bridge over the Hutchinson stream, their retreat covered by the 150 men of the 14th Continentals who engaged in an artillery duel with the British. Howe camped on a hill {{on the opposite side of}} the stream but made no attempt to cross the stream.|$|E

5|$|The {{infantry}} {{scrambled to}} their feet and rushed forward while the sappers hurried to break down the sides of the antitank ditch with picks and shovels. They advanced on a series of posts held by the 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the Italian 115th Infantry Regiment. Posts 49 and 47 were rapidly overrun, as was Post 46 in the second line beyond. Within half an hour Post 48 had also fallen and another company had taken Posts 45 and 44. The two remaining companies now advanced beyond these positions towards a low stone wall as artillery fire began to fall along the broken wire. The Italians fought from <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> until the Australians were inside it, attacking with hand grenades and bayonets. The two companies succeeded in taking 400 prisoners.|$|E
5|$|The rain {{continued}} {{throughout the}} second session, so most teams concentrated on their wet weather setups {{in preparation for}} a wet race. About halfway through the session the No. 7 Peugeot in the hands of Marc Gené missed the turn at Arnage and hit a tire barrier. The car was unable to return to the pits and was taken <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> by the marshals. This was soon followed by the No. 73 Luc Alphand Corvette missing the same turn as well, but it continued on without significant damage. The No. 70 PSI Corvette had a minor accident in the last five minutes of the session, bringing out the only red flag of the day and ending all of qualifying.|$|E
25|$|Unless {{the wall}} is {{designed}} to retain water, It {{is important to have}} proper drainage <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> in order to limit the pressure to the wall's design value. Drainage materials will reduce or eliminate the hydrostatic pressure and improve the stability of the material <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> Drystone retaining walls are normally self-draining.|$|E

25|$|In 1900, the Iron Tower {{was to be}} torn down, but {{was saved}} by the Mainz Association of Antiquities (Mainzer Altertumsverein) and in 1905 became the {{property}} of the city.

25|$|After 1890, {{apart from}} continual {{improvements}} to the Fort's guns and their emplacements {{and the construction of}} search-light apertures, little development took place within the Fort until World War I from 1914-18. Around 1915, substantial development occurred along the northern boundary of the parade ground which involved the removal of an old shrapnel mound from <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> and the erection of a number of timber barracks and mess buildings.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} consideration in proper design and installation of retaining walls {{is to recognize}} and counteract the tendency of the retained material to move downslope due to gravity. This creates lateral earth pressure <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> which depends on the {{angle of internal friction}} (phi) and the cohesive strength (c) of the retained material, as well as the direction and magnitude of movement the retaining structure undergoes.|$|E

25|$|Lateral earth {{pressures}} are zero {{at the top}} of the wall and – in homogenous ground – increase proportionally to a maximum value at the lowest depth. Earth pressures will push the wall forward or overturn it if not properly addressed. Also, any groundwater <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> that is not dissipated by a drainage system causes hydrostatic pressure on the wall. The total pressure or thrust may be assumed to act at one-third from the lowest depth for lengthwise stretches of uniform height.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} week at Bristol, while running 5th, leader Denny Hamlin was wrecked by Kevin Harvick while racing for the lead, which then sent Hamlin's {{car into the}} inside wall. Hamlin's car then slid right back {{up in front of}} the No. 88 and slammed into the left-side door of the car, and the contact was bad enough to send Earnhardt <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> and suffer a 39th-place finish. This was his second DNF of the year, after the early exit in the spring Texas race.|$|E
25|$|At Bristol in August, Busch {{started on}} the outside row and led 54 laps early, before a loose wheel caused him to go <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> {{resulting}} in a 31st-place finish, 26 laps down. However, he bounced back over the following two weeks, with a fourth-place finish at Atlanta. The following week at Richmond, Busch started second and {{had one of the}} strongest cars of the night, ultimately finishing second to Carl Edwards. This also marked Furniture Row Racing's first ever appearance in the Chase.|$|E

25|$|Despite finding {{neither the}} {{specific}} wires {{that caused the}} short circuit (the usual cause of arcing sounds and the likely cause of the breaker trips) nor the origin point of the fire that later consumed the plane, investigators determined that a short circuit likely sparked and ignited surrounding materials (such as insulation blankets) that sustained and propagated a fire <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> of the lavatory, with the plane's outer skin serving as a conduit for smoke to seep in through the seams in the interior panels and collect near {{the apex of the}} cabin.|$|E
25|$|<b>Behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> {{of the old}} Vaults (see section 4.3 above), {{set back}} from the street, are two well known Leith restaurants. Aside from their reputations for good food, both have capitalised on their unique {{historic}} location. Anfora Wine Bar (v) has its dining room within a space originally designed for claret tasting and still lit by candlelight and decorated with fine plasterwork. Upstairs, in the same building, The Scotch Malt Whisky Society (iv) has its restaurant. As the society {{is devoted to the}} bottling and sale of single malt whisky, the continuation of the Vaults' historic merchant associations with the alcohol trade seem assured for the present.|$|E
25|$|Brockie {{was killed}} at Ypres in 1915, but a {{simmering}} controversy broke out between Churchill and Haldane {{until his death}} in 1950 as to the exact events of that night. Haldane claimed that the party had again agreed to defer their escape, but that Churchill had then gone over the wall by himself. Churchill's account describes him waiting <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> {{for more than an hour}} for the others to join him, and then a discussion between them through the wall, where the others told him the sentry was suspicious and they could not escape. Haldane agreed a conversation took place, but not how Churchill had come to be on the other side of the wall while they had not.|$|E

25|$|Inside the New House {{the downstairs}} {{consists}} of a main kitchen and a secondary kitchen (scullery) with pantry. It also includes a living room, although as the main room of the house, most meals would have been eaten in the main kitchen, equipped with an early range, boiler and hot air oven. Upstairs is a main bedroom and a second bedroom for children; to the rear (i.e. the colder, north side), are bedrooms for a servant and the servant lad respectively. Above the kitchen (for transferred warmth) is a grain and fleece store, with attached bacon loft, a narrow space <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> where bacon or hams, usually salted first, would be hung to be smoked by the kitchen fire (entering through a small door in the chimney).|$|E
25|$|Seven races later, Sacks {{was able}} to drive the No. 49 car owned by 1966 NASCAR Rookie of the Year James Hylton. Before the Firecracker 400, DiGard Motorsports asked Sacks to drive their R car. Sacks {{qualified}} ninth and defeated pole-sitter Bill Elliott to earn his only NASCAR Winston Cup Series victory. The win {{was considered to be}} one of NASCAR's biggest upsets, as Sacks's car was only scheduled to run a set number of laps before going <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> to make changes, but his car kept competing for the win, therefore DiGard decided to let Sacks race as normal. After DiGard's regular driver Bobby Allison quit the team days after the race, the team let Sacks finish the season in their regular car. The next year, Sacks found himself running a limited schedule as DiGard slowly went bankrupt.|$|E
