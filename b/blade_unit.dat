40|$|The {{grape family}} (Vitaceae) {{is a large}} group of plants {{consisting}} of approximately 900 species. Cultivated grapes (Vitis vinifera L.) are the most famous species in the Vitaceae family because of their economic importance in both fruit and wine production. In the U. S. alone, 7. 4 million tons of grapes were produced in 2010 (www. nass. usda. gov) equating to approximately $ 162 billion annually (www. ngwi. org), {{making it one of the}} most economically important fruit crops in the country. It is generally supported, through molecular analyses, that Vitaceae is a sister to all other Rosids, a related group comprising over one fourth of the world’s flowering plants (Ren et al., 2007). This large group was found to have split from the rest of the flowering plants very early in plant evolution (Wang et al., 2007). Thus, a better understanding of the biology of grapes has the potential to improve our understanding of the biology of other rosid crops such as legumes (e. g. soybeans), fruit crops (e. g. apples), and oilseed crops (e. g. canola). The genus Ampelopsis, a member of the Vitaceae (grape) family, encompasses species that exhibit a wide range of mature leaf shape that vary from simple (undivided single blade) to compound (subdivided multiple <b>blade</b> <b>unit).</b> The purpose of this study was to investigate the involvement of KNOX-genes, specifically KNOX 1 (Knotted 1 -like homeobox), in the development of Ampelopsis, and how this gene controls leaf morphology. Since virtually nothing is known about leaf development in the genus Ampelopsis, and Vitaceae as a whole, five species with various leaf shapes (simple, lobed, dissected and compound) were selected for the study: Ampelopsis aconitifolia, Ampelopsis arborea, Ampelopsis cordata, Ampelopsis glandulosa, and Ampelopsis humulifolia. Immunolocalizations of Knotted 1 (KN 1) antibody on paraffin sections of Ampelopsis shoot apical meristems were used to locate KNOX 1 proteins. We found that during simple leaf development, KNOX 1 was required for the initiation of leaf primordia in the shoot apical meristem, but was downregulated after emerging from the apex allowing the blade to remain undivided. However, in the compound-leafed species, KNOX 1 expression persisted into young developing leaves to form leaflets, therefore, playing a role in leaf compounding. Overall, by assessing the role of KNOX genes and its regulation on leaf morphology, our study begins to assess how leaf shape separated into distinct groups within this genus during leaf evolution as well as give us clues into the evolutionary history of the ancestral leaf form...|$|E

2500|$|On 28 June 1943, {{the first}} Tempest Mk.II, LA602, flew {{powered by a}} Centaurus IV (2,520hp/1,879kW) driving a four-blade propeller. LA602 {{initially}} flew with a Typhoon-type fin and rudder unit. This {{was followed by the}} second, LA607, which was completed with the enlarged dorsal fin and first flew on 18 September 1943: LA607 was assigned to engine development. The first major problem experienced during the first few flights was serious engine vibrations, which were cured by replacing the rigid, eight-point engine mountings with six-point rubber-packed shock mounts. In a further attempt to alleviate engine vibration, the four blade propeller was replaced with a five blade unit; eventually, a finely balanced four <b>bladed</b> <b>unit</b> was settled on. Problems were also experienced with engine overheating, poor crankshaft lubrication, exhaust malfunctions and reduction-gear seizures. Because of these problems, and because of the decision to [...] "tropicalise" [...] all Tempest IIs for service in the South-East Asian theatre, production was delayed.|$|R

This tailwheel was to be modified several times on the prototype, including using twin tailwheels each smaller than the single wheel which was later standardised.

Undercarriage fairings had now been fitted to the legs. Although the propeller was still the fixed-pitch, wooden <b>bladed</b> <b>unit</b> the pitch had been changed in an attempt to increase the top speed. Several different types of propeller unit were to be fitted to the prototype.
