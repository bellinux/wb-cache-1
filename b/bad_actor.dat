In fact, given the normal amount of the more {{painstaking}} type of direction, {{it is entirely possible}} that Mr. Wiggle-hips could develop into a really competent actor. As long, however, as he can continue to attract audiences in present proportions there's little need in worrying with drama schools." [...] Allrovi rated the movie with four stars out of five, stating: [...] "The film's highlight is a brief exchange of fisticuffs between Elvis and Walter Matthau.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedWe develop a classification system for U. S. Navy consumable items {{to give the}} Naval Supply Systems Command (NAVSUP) a better position for advocacy regarding these assets. The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) {{is responsible for the}} procurement, storage, and distribution of the Navy's consumable assets. Its inventory system is highly dynamic, and items may be requisitioned for long periods without undue delay followed by sudden, unexpected shortages that directly affect Navy combat readiness. We propose a new metric, customer time limit (CTL), which normalizes the requisition fulfillment time according to priority level and the physical location of the customer. Using this metric, we essentially classify inventory items as problematical with respect to two different criteria: whether the median CTL exceeds a nominal threshold, and whether CTL exhibits an increasing trend. To apply this classification, nonparametric statistical methods are used based on consumable requisition data for calendar years 2013 through 2015, resulting in three categories: NSNs at Risk, <b>Bad</b> <b>Actors,</b> or <b>Bad</b> <b>Actors</b> with Trend. Collectively, we find that NSNs at Risk and <b>Bad</b> <b>Actors</b> with Trend constitute approximately 1 % in both U. S. Navy consumable item population and annual consumable expenditure ($ 19 million out of $ 1. 9 billion purchased), and that <b>Bad</b> <b>Actors</b> comprise approximately 2 % of U. S. Navy consumable item population and 7 % of annual consumable expenditure ($ 140 million out of $ 1. 9 billion purchased). Lieutenant Commander, Supply Corps, United States Nav...|$|R

He was not a <b>bad</b> <b>actor,</b> and those who saw him and made reports as to his conduct {{on the following day}} declared that he had apparently been quite indifferent to the disagreeable incidents of his position. But his indifference had been mere acting. His careless manner with his wife had been all assumed. Selfish as he was, void as he was of all principle, utterly unmanly and even unconscious of the worth of manliness, still he was alive to the opinions of others. He thought that the world was wrong to condemn him,--that the world did not understand the facts of his case, and that the world generally would have done as he had done in similar circumstances. He did not know that there was such a quality as honesty, nor did he understand what the word meant. But he did know that some men, an unfortunate class, became subject to evil report from others who were more successful, and he was aware that he had become one of those unfortunates. Nor could he see any remedy for his position. It was all blank and black before him. It may be doubted whether he got much instruction or amusement from the pages of the magazine which he turned.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose an {{architecture}} for using crossorganization information sharing to identify {{members of a group}} of hosts enslaved for malicious purposes on the Internet. We root our system in so-called "detectives" [...] - savvy network monitors like sophisticated intrusion detection systems or honeyfarms that have a deep understanding of malicious behavior. We augment information from these detectives with observations from a large array of "witnesses" that are already in-place at many locations in the network. These witnesses are not savvy enough to understand that a particular behavior is malicious, but their simple factual observations can be shared with a detective in order to form a broad picture of a group of <b>bad</b> <b>actors.</b> A key aspect of the system is the design of a lightweight mechanism to reliably share enough information between detectives and witnesses to form an understanding of a group of <b>bad</b> <b>actors</b> without sharing more information than necessary, in order to address privacy and competitive concerns...|$|R

60|$|Many years ago, {{while yet}} Fancy claimed that right in me which Fact has since, to my no small loss, so {{successfully}} disputed, I pleased myself with imagining {{the play of}} Hamlet published under some alias, and {{as the work of}} a new candidate in literature. Then I played, as the children say, that it came in regular course before some well-meaning doer of criticisms, who had never read the original, (no very wild assumption, as things go,) and endeavored to conceive the kind of way in which he would be likely to take it. I put myself in his place, and tried to write such a perfunctory notice as I thought would be likely, in filling his column, to satisfy his conscience. But it was a tour de force quite beyond my power to execute without grimace. I could not arrive at that artistic absorption in my own conception which would enable me to be natural, and found myself, like a <b>bad</b> <b>actor,</b> continually betraying my self-consciousness by my very endeavor to hide it under caricature. The path of Nature is indeed a narrow one, and it is only the immortals that seek it, and, when they find it, do not find themselves cramped therein. My result was a dead failure,--satire instead of comedy. I could not shake off that strange accumulation which we call self, and report honestly what I saw and felt even to myself, much less to others.|$|E
6000|$|But Diderot {{knew well}} enough that Chardin's kindly {{principle}} might easily be carried too far. In general, he said, criticism displeases me; it supposes so little talent. [...] "What a foolish occupation, that of incessantly hindering ourselves from taking pleasure, or else making ourselves blush {{for the pleasure}} that we have taken! And that is the occupation of criticism!"[37] Yet in one case he writes a score of pages of critical dialogue, in which the chief interlocutor is a painter who avenges his own failure by stringent attacks {{on the work of}} happier rivals of the year. And speaking in his own proper person, Diderot knows how to dismiss incompetence with the right word, sometimes of scorn, more often of good-natured remonstrance. Bad painters, a Parrocel, a Brenet, fare as ill at his hands as they deserved to do. He remarks incidentally that the condition of the bad painter and the <b>bad</b> <b>actor</b> is worse than that of the bad man of letters: the painter hears with his own ears the expressions of contempt for his talent, and the hisses of the audience go straight to the ears of the actor, whereas the author has the comfort of going to his grave without a suspicion that you have cried out at every page: [...] "The fool, the animal, the jackass!" [...] and have at length flung his book into a corner. There is nothing to prevent the worst author, as he sits alone in his library, and reads himself over and over again, from congratulating himself on being the originator of a host of rare and felicitous ideas.[38] ...|$|E
60|$|I {{suggest that}} diplomatists of the internationalist school should spend {{some of their}} money on staging farces and comedies of cross-purposes, founded on the curious and {{prevalent}} idea that England and America have the same language. I know, of course, that we both inherit the glorious tongue of Shakespeare, {{not to mention the}} tune of the musical glasses; but there have been moments when I thought that if we spoke Greek and they spoke Latin we might understand each other better. For Greek and Latin are at least fixed, while American at least is still very fluid. I do not know the American language, and therefore I do not claim to distinguish between the American language and the American slang. But I know that highly theatrical developments might follow on taking the words as part of the English slang or the English language. I have already given the example of calling a person 'a regular guy,' which in the States is a graceful expression of respect and esteem, but which on the stage, properly handled, might surely lead the way towards a divorce or duel or something lively. Sometimes coincidence merely clinches a mistake, as it so often clinches a misprint. Every proof-reader knows that the worst misprint is not that which makes nonsense but that which makes sense; not that which is obviously wrong but that which is hideously right. He who has essayed to write 'he got the book,' and has found it rendered mysteriously as 'he got the boob' is pensively resigned. It is when it is rendered quite lucidly as 'he got the boot' that he is moved to a more passionate mood of regret. I have had conversations in which this sort of accident would have wholly misled me, if another accident had not come to the rescue. An American friend of mine was telling me of his adventures as a cinema-producer down in the south-west where real Red Indians were procurable. He said that certain Indians were 'very bad actors.' It passed for me as a very ordinary remark on a very ordinary or natural deficiency. It would hardly seem a crushing criticism to say that some wild Arab chieftain was not very good at imitating a farmyard; or that the Grand Llama of Thibet was rather clumsy at making paper boats. But the remark might be natural in a man travelling in paper boats, or touring with an invisible farmyard for his menagerie. As my friend was a cinema-producer, I supposed he meant that the Indians were bad cinema actors. But the phrase has really a high and austere moral meaning, which my levity had wholly missed. A <b>bad</b> <b>actor</b> means a man whose actions are bad or morally reprehensible. So that I might have embraced a Red Indian who was dripping with gore, or covered with atrocious crimes, imagining there was nothing the matter with him beyond a mistaken choice of the theatrical profession. Surely there are here the elements of a play, not to mention a cinema play. Surely a New England village maiden might find herself among the wigwams {{in the power of the}} formidable and fiendish 'Little Blue Bison,' merely through her mistaken sympathy with his financial failure as a Film Star. The notion gives me glimpses of all sorts of dissolving views of primeval forests and flamboyant theatres; but this impulse of irrelevant theatrical production must be curbed. There is one example, however, of this complication of language actually used in contrary senses, about which the same figure can be used to illustrate a more serious fact.|$|E

40|$|For-profit social {{entrepreneurship}} is a steadily growing movement. As {{part of this}} movement, numerous states have enacted legislation authorizing the incorporation of benefit corporations, a new for-profit corporate form. In addition to generating profit for shareholders, benefit corporations must “create” a “public benefit. ” The mandate that a for-profit corporation pursue a humanitarian cause in addition to generating profit is {{a significant departure from}} shareholder primacy: the maxim that the sole purpose of a corporation is to generate return on investment for its shareholders. Although this legislation is a necessary and progressive evolution in corporate law, the current benefit corporation form lacks meaningful accountability and oversight mechanisms. It does little to deter <b>bad</b> <b>actors</b> from taking advantage of socially conscious consumers willing to pay a premium for ethically sourced goods and services by incorporating and operating sham benefit corporations. This Note argues for amending benefit corporation legislation to allow state attorneys general to oversee the creation of public benefits.
