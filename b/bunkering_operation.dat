40|$|This study {{presents}} {{the design of}} a novel boil-off gas (BOG) re-liquefaction technology using a BOG recondenser system. The BOG recondenser system targets the liquefied natural gas (LNG) <b>bunkering</b> <b>operation,</b> in which the BOG phase transition occurs in a pressure vessel instead of a heat exchanger. The BOG that is generated during LNG <b>bunkering</b> <b>operation</b> is characterized as an intermittent flow with various peak loads. The system was designed to temporarily store the transient BOG inflow, condense it with subcooled LNG and store the condensed liquid. The superiority of the system was verified by comparing it with the most extensively employed conventional re-liquefaction system in terms of consumption energy and via an exergy analysis. Static simulations were conducted for three compositions; the results indicated that the proposed system provided 0 to 6. 9 % higher efficiencies. The exergy analysis indicates that the useful work of the conventional system is 24. 9 %, and the useful work of the proposed system is 26. 0 %. Process dynamic simulations of six cases were also performed to verify the behaviour of the BOG recondenser system. The results show that the pressure of the holdup in the recondenser vessel increased during the BOG inflow mode and decreased during the initialization mode. The maximum pressure of one of the bunkering cases was 3. 45 bar. The system encountered a challenge during repetitive operations due to overpressurizing of the BOG recondenser vessel...|$|E
40|$|The {{environmental}} and economical advantages of using LNG as marine fuel {{have been recognized}} by the industry. In response to increasing demand, construction of LNG bunkering infrastructure is under rapid development. Several ports are preparing to supply LNG, but uncertainties concerning the bunkering process and operational safety still exist. Recently, much {{work has been done}} to standardize LNG bunkering solutions, including a launch of an ISO guideline and a Recommended Practice (RP) by DNV. One of the main topics of these documents and of international discussion is operational safety and the establishment of safety zones around the operations. High risk is particularly associated with &# 147;vulnerable objects&# 148; (i. e. third parties, like ferry passengers) {{in the vicinity of the}} <b>bunkering</b> <b>operation.</b> Ferries are currently the main LNG fuel consumer and some ferries have passengers on at all times. Current regulations do not allow passenger presence during bunkering. This limitation reduces the functionality and competitiveness of LNG, and has proved to be problematic for ferry companies. The goal of this thesis is to establish probabilistic safety zones for a generic ship-to-ship (STS) bunkering case. Threats to vulnerable objects and the associated likelihood, in the event of an LNG leak, is identified. The specific purpose is to determine whether acceptable safety levels for passengers are present onboard a ferry performing LNG bunkering operations. This study will assess the risks involved and calculate safety zones through an established probabilistic approach, known as Quantitative Risk Assessment (QRA) methodology. This method includes frequency and consequence calculations of possible Loss of Containment (LOC) scenarios. The acceptable risk level for third parties per <b>bunkering</b> <b>operation</b> is assessed against the widely used criteria of 10 E- 06. Based on the contour results provided by PHASTRisk (the DNV risk analysis software tool), it is clearly demonstrated that passenger safety can be maintained during bunkering operations. This study concludes that there is no unreasoning risk in allowing passenger presence during bunkering. Passenger safety issues should consequently not limit the application of LNG as fuel for ferries. </p...|$|E

40|$|LNG is {{becoming}} a common fuel for shipping. With an increasing demand for bunkering possibilities, bunkering vessels for LNG are being built. This report {{is based on the}} theory that a ship-to-ship <b>bunkering</b> <b>operation</b> and a conventional loading/discharging operation at a terminal are different and require different skills from the staff on board. The main questions this report tries to answer is whether the safety risks of the different operations differ and what specific educational demands are placed on those working on board bunkering vessels for LNG and gas tankers for LNG. Today, there is a regulatory framework that both vessel types shall obey, the IGC Code. In addition to the IGC Code, {{there are a variety of}} local rules and guidelines relating to the various operations. We want to see if there is need for a type-specific training for staff who work on board bunkering vessels. A triangulating approach has been the method used during the process. The background section has largely been based on a literature review of previous works and scientific articles relating to the subject. In the discussion and result chapters we have then been able to both verify and question our findings in the background chapter, using information taken from interviews and observations. The result shows that the operations bunkering ship-to-ship vs. loading/unloading at a terminal does not differ in any significant way. The operations are not significantly affected by the size of the ship. However, the result shows that there are in fact different safety hazards onboard the different ships that co-relates with their differences in design, systems, purpose, and the vessels operational pattern. Training requirements do not differ between the two ship types. The report shows that both systems on board the vessels, as well as risks during operations differ. Thus pointing out that further training and education for staff working onboard bunkering vessels is advised...|$|E
40|$|LNG {{shipping}} is tracking {{back to the}} 1950 s, and has {{for more}} than half a century been finding promising. It is not until the last years LNG has been taken into commercial shipping as a fuel, and more widely considered a future main source of energy. This is due to important factors such as shale gas production together with increasing oil prices and pressure for green fuel by states and authorities. Within the new 10 year period, several key harbor areas will have strict limitations in term of fuel being used by the ships. There are various technical solutions on the market to reduce the emissions from an oil fueled engine. However, as the oil price is predicted to further increase a change of energy source could be profitable. LNG has a lower energy density than fuel oil and requires also tank isolation to keep it at - 163 °C. Together with limitations in where it can be installed in the vessel from the class societies makes it less energy dense as similar amounts of bunker oil. This is considered one of the main disadvantages for it to be used in ships. As found, there are solutions that can be used in order to overcome the downside of LNG being less energy dense than fuel oil. This can be as I have found, to either increase the number of bunkering operations, the governments can install offshore bunkering stations, and one can either take space from cargo decks, redesign ship volumes, or add configurations for removable LNG tanks onboard, used when sailing longer distances. Ongoing development in membrane tanks will also increase the energy density, together with changes in the classification societies rules and regulations. From studying the ship operation pattern and engine loads, I found that the consumption of fuel oil compared to fuel oil volumes is relatively low. Today, the vessels have a capacity of sailing for about 2 months without bunkering. Still, I have seen and experienced that a <b>bunkering</b> <b>operation</b> is not an issue, and only requires some additional planning. On this basis and picture of the general arrangement and stability data I have found different solutions that will have different effects depending on several factors, such as future fuel price and operational pattern. In the lean burn gas solution, the design would have to take a volume of 1. 500 [m 3] from the cargo space to be able to reach between the longest sea stretches, being from Japan to South America. The cost of lost opportunity will depend highly of the degree of utilization of deck 1. As long as it is under 65 %, there will be no cost of lost opportunity. Utilization over this will give an added cost, depending of the freight rates and utilization degree. I found that this solution actually would be profitable as long as LNG is about 10 % cheaper than HFO for assumptions regarding operation profile and the mentioned utilization and rates. Since the LNG 2 -stroke engine is significantly decreasing in efficiency below 60 - 70 % load, it is likely to be beneficial with shaft generators installed. The size of the main engine would again depend on load and operation. Another solution is to add extra fuel tanks when crossing the pacific. This will not result in a cost of lost opportunity if the vessel is sailing in other trades. This concept would also be easily loaded and discharged as the tanks can be rolled on and off, with the ramp supporting 150 tons. The other solution I found is that the existing bunker tank volume included in Höeghs ships is sufficient for the vessel to operate on a dual fuel configuration, with more than 400 tons LNG and 675 tons HFO onboard. If it is possible to add HFO in the volume underneath the LNG-tanks, the total volumes of the two fuels could be 500 tons LNG and 1900 tons of fuel oil. The dual fuel engines are said to be 4 % less efficient from statement from engine makers, when operation on HFO mode compared to a pure diesel engine. In conclusion, the dual fuel design is profitable if the LNG costs are between MDO and HFO-price, and the design will also add values that might also give motivation behind the choice, such as redundancy in the fuel system and a lower climate footprint. If the LNG price is lower than HFO, a purely LNG solution is found to be most likely economical. </p...|$|E

40|$|With rising oil prices, {{there is}} growing {{interest}} in more accurate measurement during transfers of marine fuel oil, whether {{for the purposes of}} environmental monitoring or for validating custody transfer. Air entrainment is a common problem in marine fuel transfer (<b>bunkering)</b> <b>operations,</b> which can induce measurement errors in many metering technologies. The latest generation of Coriolis mass flow meters is able to operate in both single- and two-phase (oil-air) flow conditions. Witnessed trials have taken place at the National Engineering Laboratory in the UK using a large (200 mm diameter) Coriolis flowmeter. The accuracies of the mass flow and density measurements were assessed for steady single-phase and two-phase flow on high and low viscosity oils. Meter accuracy was further assessed over a series of simulated <b>bunkering</b> <b>operations,</b> in which the meter started and finished empty of oil, with periods of both single and two-phase operation.
