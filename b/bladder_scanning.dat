Objectives. Normal and neoplastic human tissues have different electromagnetic properties. This study aimed to determine the diagnostic accuracy of noninvasive electromagnetic detection of bladder cancer (BC) by the tissue-resonance interaction method (TRIM-prob). Patients and Methods. Consecutive patients were referred for cystoscopy because of (i) microscopic or gross hematuria and/or irritative voiding symptoms and (ii) bladder ultrasounds and urinary cytology findings negative or just suspicious of malignancy. Patients were first submitted to TRIM-prob <b>bladder</b> <b>scanning</b> by a single investigator and then to cystoscopy by another investigator blind to TRIM-prob data. Results. In 125 evaluated patients cystoscopy was positive for BC in 47 and negative in the remaining 78; conversely, TRIM-prob bladder scanningwas positive for BC in 53 and negative in 72. In particular, TRIM-prob scanning yielded 7 false positives and only one false negative; therefore, its overall sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and diagnostic accuracy were 97. 9 %, 89. 9 %, 86. 8 %, 98. 6 %, and 93. 6 %, respectively. Conclusions. TRIM-prob <b>bladder</b> <b>scanning</b> was a simple and quite accurate method for non-invasive electromagnetic detection of BC. If the elevated positive and negative predictive values will be replicated in further well-designed studies, {{it could be used}} to screen asymptomatic patients at high risk of BC. 1...|$|E
40|$|Background and purpose: Achieving daily {{consistent}} bladder {{volume is}} acknowledged as challenging for patients undergoing radiotherapy to the cervix or endometrium. We investigated if {{use of an}} ultrasound bladder volume scanner (BioCon- 700) improves bladder reproducibility when used during an active volume correction protocol. Materials and methods: During our method-comparison study, prospectively recruited patients (n= 20) followed a fluid-loading protocol to achieve acceptable bladder volume. Bladder ultrasound was performed daily to verify planned volume, with patients actively correcting volumes outside a planned range up {{to a maximum of}} three times. Using the Bland–Altman method, we compared mean ultrasound readings (USMean) with mean cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) volumes (CBCTMean). We also conducted staff focus groups exploring issues encountered during implementation of <b>bladder</b> <b>scanning.</b> Results: Comparing USMean with CBCTMean produced a mean of the differences − 10 ± 49 · 92 mL (1 SD), demonstrating that bladder volume scanning is equivalent to our standard measure for the stated confidence levels. The cohort mean bladder volume decrease from week 1 to 5 was only 8 · 4 %. Mean USMean was 323 mL, mean CBCTMean was 313 mL. Staff experience with the scanner overall was positive. Conclusions: The BioCon- 700 is suitable for the purpose of daily pre-treatment volume verification, facilitating daily assessment and modification of bladder volume, resulting in reproducible treatment volumes...|$|E

40|$|During cystoscopy, the {{urologist}} manually steers a cyst scope {{inside a}} patient's bladder to visually inspect the inner surface. Cystoscopies are performed {{as part of}} surveillance for bladder cancer, making it the most expensive cancer to treat over a patient's lifetime. An automated <b>bladder</b> <b>scanning</b> system has been devised to reduce workload and cost by relieving the urologist from performing surveillance. Presented here is a proof-of-concept apparatus that controls the motion of a miniature flexible endoscope. Image-based feedback is used to adjust the endoscope's movement so that captured images overlap with one another, ensuring that the entire inner surface of the bladder is imaged. Within a bladder phantom, the apparatus adaptively created and followed a spherical scan pattern comprised of 13 individual latitudes and 508 captured images, while accepting between 60 % and 90 % image overlap between adjacent images. The elapsed time and number of captured images were sensitive to the apparatus's placement within the phantom and the acceptable image overlap percentage range. A mosaic of captured images was generated to validate comprehensive surveillance. Overall, a robotically controlled endoscope {{used in conjunction with}} image-based feedback may permit fully automated and comprehensive bladder surveillance to be conducted without direct clinician oversight.

This paper will demonstrate how partnership working with a local NHS trust {{has led to a}} change in philosophy in both the HEI and NHS trust in the development of skills for student nurses and how this equips them for the workplace they are entering. Trust partners and local HEI have developed a framework of learning, called SimBubbles 4 healthcare. These ‘bubbles’ are learning opportunities that aim to challenge current thinking in learning. It had been noted that the local trust required staff to undergo a pack before commencement of skills, which may have already been gained elsewhere. These skills are sometimes seen as advanced or extended, however, the authors sought to challenge this by embedding skills within a framework. The project took 180 adult student nurses in their final year and taught them the theoretical components of cannulation and phlebotomy, on completion of this element, they were invited to the clinical skills suite to demonstrate competence in implementing this skill in the safe environment of the skills suite on manikins. The third part of this process was allowing students who met other trust and HEI agreed criteria to undergo the skills in the clinical setting. This resulted in around 80 students who were deemed competent to carry out this task in practice. This has resulted in a reduction in education required in the local trust on qualification and has even been seen as satisfactory for other trusts where students procured jobs. The development of the SimBubbles 4 healthcare has already been developed in a similar project for trust staff for training in using the new observations documentation released in 2014 and further SimBubbles are being planned for male catheterisation and <b>bladder</b> <b>scanning.</b> The SimBubble attempts to utilise simulation to enhance the theoretical elements of learning to enhance and develop safe practice...|$|E
40|$|Infection by Proteus mirabilis can seriously {{complicate the}} care of {{patients}} undergoing long-term indwelling bladder catheterisation. The urease-producing bacteria colonize the catheter surfaces forming extensive biofilm communities and are capable of generating ammonia from urea and elevating the pH of the urine and biofilm. Under these conditions crystals of calcium and magnesium phosphates form in the urine and within the bacterial biofilm on the indwelling device leading to its encrustation and blockage. Urine can leak around {{the outside of the}} blocked catheter and patients become incontinent. Alternatively, urine is retained within the bladder, causing painful distension of the bladder. Reflux of infected urine to the kidneys can lead to serious symptomatic episodes such as pyelonephritis, septicaemia and endotoxic shock. All available types of indwelling catheter are vulnerable to this problem and currently there are no effective procedures available for its control. While the basic mechanism has been established for catheter encrustation we still need to know more about some of the fundamental aspects of the process. Little is known about the early events and the precise mechanisms which P. mirabilis uses to colonize catheter surfaces. The factors that control the rate at which crystalline biofilm forms on the catheters are also unknown. The aims of this study were to establish the sequence of events {{in the early stages of}} crystalline P. mirabilis biofilm formation on the range of currently available catheters for use with patients to determine the role of Mannose-Resistant Proteus-hkc fimbriae (MR/P fimbriae) in P. mirabilis crystalline biofilm formation on catheters to investigate how the pH at which calcium and magnesium phosphates precipitate from urine, the nucleation pH (pHn) can be manipulated and to determine the effect of this parameter on the rate of catheter encrustation. Using a laboratory model of the catheterised <b>bladder,</b> <b>scanning</b> electron microscopy and X-ray microanalysis, the initial stages of P. mirabilis crystalline biofilm development was observed on catheter surfaces. All-silicone, silicone-coated latex, hydrogel-coated latex and hydrogel/silver-coated latex catheters rapidly acquired a microcrystalline 'foundation layer' comprised predominantly of calcium phosphate, upon which, P. mirabilis crystalline biofilm subsequently developed. A similar 'foundation layer' was observed on the encrusted surfaces of hydrogel/silver-coated catheters removed from long-term catheterised patients. The catheters impregnated with nitrofurazone briefly delayed the onset of crystalline biofilm formation, while all-silicone and hydrogel-coated latex catheters inflated with triclosan (3 mg/ml in Na 2 C 03) were able to maintain acidic urine pH and prevent crystalline biofilm development for the 7 day experimental period. There is evidence that MR/P fimbriae are involved in initiating infection in non-catheterised urinary tracts. The role of these adhesins in crystalline biofilm formation on indwelling catheters however, has not been investigated. Using bladder models infected with a wild type P. mirabilis strain able to express MR/P fimbriae and its derived MR/P-negative mutant, time to catheter blockage experiments and scanning electron microscopy revealed that MR/P fimbriae were not essential for P. mirabilis colonization of catheter surfaces or the development of crystalline P. mirabilis biofilm. Although the wild type and mutant strain initiated biofilm formation in different ways both rapidly blocked all-silicone catheters with crystalline material. The overriding factor in catheter blockage was the generation of alkaline urine, raising the pH above that at which crystalline formations develop. Previously it has been demonstrated that the pHn of human urine can be elevated by dilution and by increasing its citrate content. In the present study the effect of dilution and adding citrate on the pHn of artificial was assessed. Furthermore, the effect on the rate of encrustation on all-silicone catheters was examined in laboratory models supplied with these urines and infected with urease-positive P. mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri and Proteus vulgaris. The pHn of urine could be elevated from pH 6. 7 in neat urine to pH 8. 4 in urine diluted to 1 : 6. When neat, 1 : 1, 1 : 2 and 1 : 3 diluted urines were supplied to bladder models significant increases in catheter lifespan were recorded at each ascending dilution. Increasing the citrate content of the 1 : 1 diluted urine from 0 to 3. 0 g/L citrate elevated the pHn from pH 7 to pH 9. 1. Scanning electron microscopy of catheter sections revealed crystalline material in the biofilms could be virtually eliminated for at least 7 days in models supplied with urine with pHns of >pH 8. 5. Time to catheter blockage experiments showed the rate of catheter encrustation became significantly reduced as the pHn of urine increased. Catheters in models supplied with urine containing citrate concentrations of 1. 5 mg/ml (pHn > 8. 4) or more drained freely for the whole 7 -day experimental period.

So, {{the aim of this}} study was to evaluate the effectiveness of protocol-based full bladder maintenance by assessing bladder volume variation using an ultrasound bladder scanner to maintain bladder volume. From March 2011 to May 2011, twenty consecutive rectal cancer patients receiving external beam RT participated in this prospective study. Protocol-based full bladder maintenance consisted of education, training and continuous biofeedback by measuring bladder volume. Bladder volume was measured by <b>bladder</b> <b>scan</b> immediately before simulation CT scan and before each treatment three times weekly during the RT period. The relative bladder volume change was calculated. Intra-patient bladder volume variations were quantified using interquartile range (IQR) of relative bladder volume change in each patient. We compared intra-patient bladder volume variations obtained (n= 20) with data from our previous study patients (n= 20) performing self-controlled maintenance without protocol. Bladder volumes measured by <b>bladder</b> <b>scan</b> highly correlated with those on simulation CT scan (R= 0. 87, p< 0. 001). Patients from this study showed lower median IQR of relative bladder volume change compared to patients of self-controlled maintenance from our previous study, although it was not statistically significant (median 32. 56 % vs. 42. 19 %, p= 0. 058). Upon logistic regression, the IQR of relative bladder volume change was significantly related to protocol-based maintenance [relative risk 1. 045, 95 % confidence intervals (CI) 1. 004 - 1. 087, p= 0. 033]. Protocol-based maintenance included significantly more patients with an IQR of relative bladder volume change less than 37 % than self-controlled maintenance (p= 0. 025).

40|$|AbstractObjectiveThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the relationship between the prostatic urethral angle (PUA) and the peak urinary flow rate (Qmax), as well as the severity of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in men with benign prostate hyperplasia. Materials and methodsThe records of first-visit male patients with LUTS in the outpatient department of our institution were obtained. A transrectal ultrasound was performed on these patients after a detailed physical examination and medical history taking were performed. The International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) of the patients, the prostate size, the length of intravesical prostatic protrusion (IPP), and the PUA were evaluated. The patients also underwent uroflowmetry and <b>bladder</b> <b>scan</b> for residual urine. ResultsA total of 227 patients were included in this study. The mean PUA was 44. 58  ±  12. 87 °. The mean prostate volume was 39. 39  ±  19. 79  mL, and the mean IPP was 4. 82  ±  6. 82  mm. After utilizing multivariate linear regression analysis, PUA was independently associated with IPSS (p <  0. 001) and Qmax (p <  0. 001). However, prostate volume and IPP were not associated with the above clinical items. None of the prostatic parameters were associated with the amount of postvoiding residual urine. ConclusionPUA has a remarkable correlation with Qmax and IPSS in men with LUTS. As PUA increased, IPSS also increased, and urinary flow rate decreased, exhibiting an inverse relationship...|$|R
40|$|This study aims to {{determine}} the prevalence of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and level of awareness among male outpatients in Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre (UKMMC). A questionnaire consisting of demographic data, questions related to knowledge, attitude and practice on BPH and the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) was used for this study. Uroflowmetry and <b>bladder</b> <b>scan</b> were {{used to evaluate the}} function of the urinary tract and severity of BPH. Urine dipstick was done for glycosuria, proteinuria and haematuria. A total of 220 respondents were surveyed. The prevalence of moderately and severely symptomatic LUTS was 42. 7 %. The most commonly reported LUTS were nocturia (78. 2 %), frequency (58. 2 %) and incomplete emptying (44. 6 %). The prevalence of glycosuria, proteinuria and haematuria were 23. 6 %, 11. 4 % and 1. 8 % respectively. There was a significant association between increasing age with the severity of LUTS (p= 0. 005). Out of 102 respondents with voided urine volume greater than 150 mL, there was a significant decrease in maximum (Qmax) (p= 0. 039) and average (Qave) urine flow rates with every 10 years increase of age (p= 0. 001). The majority of respondents (59. 5 %) have heard of BPH before. Over 78. 2 % of the respondents would seek medical attention if they have LUTS with 15. 9 % saying they would seek traditional treatment. In conclusion, the prevalence of LUTS was high and the level of awareness was satisfactory...|$|R
40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} bladder wall thickness (BWT) and ultrasound estimated bladder weight (UEBW) values in healthy population with a portative ultrasound device and their relationship with demographic parameters. Materials and Methods: The study was carried out in Neurorehabilitation Clinic of Ege University Hospital. Ninety-five subjects (48 women and 47 men) aged between 18 and 56 were included in the study. BWT and UEBW were determined non-invasively with a portative ultrasound device; <b>Bladder</b> <b>Scan</b> BVM 6500 (Verathon Inc., WA, USA) at a frequency of 3. 7 MHz at functional bladder capacity. These values were compared by gender, and their relation was assessed with age, body mass index (BMI) and parity. Results: Mean BWT was 2. 0 ± 0. 4 mm and UEBW was 44. 6 ± 8. 3 g at a mean volume of 338. 0 ± 82. 1 ml. Although higher results were obtained in men at higher bladder volumes, the results did not differ significantly by gender. Correlation analyses revealed statistically significant correlation between UEBW and age (r = 0. 32). BWT was negatively correlated with volume (r = - 0. 50) and bladder surface area (r = - 0. 57). Also, statistically significant correlations were observed between UEBW and volume (r = 0. 36), bladder surface area (r = 0. 48) and BWT (r = 0. 25). Conclusion: Determined values of BWT and UEBW in healthy population are estimated with portative ultrasound devices, which are future promising, for their convenient, easy, non-invasive, time-efficient hand-held use for screening...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: {{the virtual}} {{cystoscopy}} {{and the color}} Doppler examinations are good modalities in assessment of the urinary bladder neoplasms. This study is done to assess the accuracy of CTVC and color Doppler ultrasound in detection of the urinary bladder neoplasms. Patients and methods: The examination was done between June 2010 and December 2012 on 60 patients known or suspected to have urinary bladder neoplasm. They were examined using CTVC and color Doppler ultrasound. <b>Bladder</b> <b>scanned</b> using multislice CT at a slice thickness of 1 mm. The data were transferred to a workstation for interactive navigation. Findings obtained from CTVC and ultrasound were compared with results from conventional cystoscopy and with pathological findings. Results: By the conventional cystoscopy; the 43 patients in the group A showed 53 lesions. There were (35 / 43 patients) with single lesion while there were (8 / 43 patients) more than one lesion. While the other 17 patients in group B showed 11 patient with no focal lesions and 6 patients with 6 focal lesions. By virtual cystoscopy; 56 lesions were detected in both groups; 51 plus 5 lesions in group A and B respectively. There were 3 false negative lesions with a failure rate of 3 / 56. By ultrasound; 56 lesions were detected in both groups; 53 plus 3 lesions respectively. So in virtual cystoscopy and ultrasound the results were as follows: positive predictive values: 100 %; negative predictive value: 78. 6 %; sensitivity: 94. 9 %; specificity: 100 %Conclusion: Although the definitive diagnosis of some suspected urinary bladder tumors is only possible with conventional cystoscopy and biopsy, CTVC and color Doppler ultrasound are a minimally or non-invasive techniques which provide beneficial information about urinary bladder lesion...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} how {{the effect}} of acupuncture treatment in recurrent cystitis relates to Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) diagnostic categories and physiologic measurements. Setting/location: Two private acupuncture clinics in Bergen, Norway. Measurements were carried out in Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen. Design and subjects: Ninety-eight (98) cystitis-prone women {{were randomly assigned to}} acupuncture treatment or no treatment. Main effect parameter was number of cystitis during 6 months observation time. Residual urine was measured with an automatic <b>Bladder</b> <b>Scan</b> 2500 (Diagnostic Ultrasound Corporation, Bothell, WA) at baseline, 2, 4 and 6 months. Results: Twenty-two (22) patients had Spleen yang/qi xu (Sp), 18 Kidney yang/qi xu (Kid), and 18 Liver qi stagnation (Liv). Of the Kid group, 78 % were free of cystitis (irrespective of bacteri-uria) during the observation period compared to 45 % in the Sp group, 44 % in the Liv group (p # 0. 05, Kid versus Sp and Liv), and 17 % in the nontreated group (p # 0. 01, versus all treated pa-tients). One sixth as many episodes of acute cystitis occurred in the Kid group compared to the nontreated group (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 5 0. 15, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 05 – 0. 42, p # 0. 001). Similarly, we found IRR 5 0. 49 (0. 25 – 0. 83) in the Sp group and IRR 5 0. 42 (0. 21 – 0. 80) in the Liv group. Subanalyzing for cystitis with detected bacteriuria yielded comparable results. Kid patients significantly reduced their residual urine from baseline to 6 months (36. 4 mL ver-sus 12. 9 mL, p # 0. 05). The reduction was less and nonsignificant in Sp and Liv groups (31. 5 mL versus 22. 2 mL, 36. 4 mL versus 16. 7 mL, respectively). Residual urine remained unchanged among nontreated patients. Conclusion: Our findings show a better acupuncture treatment effect on Kidney yang/qi xu than on other TCM syndromes found in women with recurrent cystitis. This has practical im-plications, and highlights the need for considering different TCM diagnostic categories in acupuncture research. 65...|$|R
