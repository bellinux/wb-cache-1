5|$|Bush {{met with}} Roosevelt and his vice president, Henry Wallace, on October 9, 1941, and <b>briefed</b> {{them on the}} S-1 Section's progress.

5|$|In July 1940, Britain {{had offered}} to give the United States access to its {{scientific}} research, and the Tizard Mission's John Cockcroft <b>briefed</b> American scientists on British developments. He discovered that the American project was smaller than the British, and not as far advanced. As part of the scientific exchange, the Maud Committee's findings were conveyed to the United States. Oliphant, one of the Maud Committee's members, flew to the United States in late August 1941, and discovered that vital information had not reached key American physicists. He met the Uranium Committee, and visited Berkeley, California, where he spoke persuasively to Ernest O. Lawrence, who was sufficiently impressed to commence his own research into uranium at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory. Lawrence in turn spoke to James B. Conant, Arthur H. Compton and George B. Pegram. Oliphant's mission was a success; key American physicists {{became aware of the}} potential power of an atomic bomb. Armed with British data, Vannevar Bush, the director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), <b>briefed</b> Roosevelt and Vice President Henry A. Wallace in a meeting at the White House on 9 October 1941.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Initial <b>briefs</b> (programs) were {{examined}} {{in order to obtain}} an overview of current practice in documenting the <b>briefing</b> process for new health care buildings in Sweden. Methodology: An audit instrument was developed and used to examine <b>briefs</b> for the content and quality of information and to determine whether and to what extent the information was comprehensive and patient oriented. Findings: The results indicate that few strategic <b>briefs</b> make use of evidence to support their statements. Moreover, few <b>briefs</b> had an explicitly patient-focused goal for the project or measurable outcomes. Implication for practice: This new audit approach can be applied in various organisations and over time to improve the <b>briefing</b> process and create clearer goals and guidelines. Originality/value: The present study contributes with an audit of written <b>briefs.</b> The question of whether the use of <b>briefing</b> and a systematic <b>brief</b> make a significant contribution to the high quality of design solutions remains unanswered, as is also the case of whether the <b>brief,</b> in general, reflects the <b>briefing</b> process. Despite the recent focus on improving the quality of the <b>briefing</b> process, {{there is a lack of}} knowledge concerning the documentation resulting from the <b>briefing</b> process. Studies are needed that employ different approaches in order to accept or reject the assumption that the <b>briefs</b> are an accurate reflection of the <b>briefing</b> process...|$|R

Glider pilot commander Staff Sergeant Jim Wallwork told Howard that with a full load of men, ammunition, assault boats and engineers' stores his gliders would be dangerously overloaded.

5|$|Captain Joseph Miceli, {{assigned}} by the Navy to lead the technical investigation into the explosion, had supervised the preparation of powder and shells used in Iowa's 16-inch guns.
