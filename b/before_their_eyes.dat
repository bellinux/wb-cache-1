Men are destined {{to live on the}} stage of the world. A public education suits them: it early places <b>before</b> <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> all the scenes of life: only the proportions are different. The paternal home is better for the education of women; they have less need to learn to deal with the interests of others, than to accustom themselves to a calm and secluded life.|$|E
5|$|Gisele meets Pierre {{the next}} day when she is picking up a {{painting}} where he spots odd behavior in her such as writing with the wrong hand, which leads him to return to her castle to investigate further.

Lorette is sent home and Inspector Chantal reveals that Giselle confessed to the crimes and died shortly after.|$|E
5|$|This was {{reinforced}} by the internal dissention that was prominent in Milan. Crime and mob violence were rampant, and the harsh but empty measures against it only served to further divide the populace. Members of the government were filled with suspicion against one another. In an attempt to resolve the situation, the podestà was given absolute power. Financial problems were also grave; fines, confiscations, and a state lottery were instituted to try to alleviate the deficit. Moreover, Guelph aristocrats continued to be regularly elected over the Ghibellines, and began to make the Republic far less democratic. Carlo Gonzaga, Captain of the People, lived luxuriously as an autocrat with his will as law. He was supported by Giovanni Appiani and Giovanni Ossona, tradesmen-turned-politicians, who were prominent in government affairs. Gonzaga began replacing his officials with his unambitious supporters, and the Ghibellines saw the ideals of their Republic crumbling <b>before</b> <b>their</b> <b>eyes.</b> Lampugnano and his Ghibelline friends conspired against Gonzaga and the Guelph regime, but were exposed by a letter intercepted by Gonzaga from Lampugnano to his friend Bossi. Gonzaga kept this knowledge secret, knowing that Lampugnano and Bossi {{were two of the}} most influential citizens since the formation of the Republic, but {{with the support of the}} vengeful Guelph Captains and Defenders conspired to have them slain. Lampugnano and Bossi were sent as envoys to Frederick III in February 1449, but on the road were caught and imprisoned. Lampugnano was beheaded without a trial, and Bossi was tortured until he gave the names of his fellow conspirators. Following the execution of the leaders there was a massacre of leading Ghibellines within the city, from which only a few, such as Vitaliano Borromeo, escaped to safety in Arona, Piedmont and elsewhere. The heads of the slain were placed upon pikes in the Piazza of the Broletto.|$|E

It was said that 'The Black Man' offered a price for your soul, while the 'White Woman' would tempt you to dance with her.

500|$|In {{the climax}} of the novel, Ayesha takes the two men to see the Pillar of Fire, passing through the ruined city of Kôr {{into the heart of the}} ancient volcano. She is {{determined}} that Leo should bathe in the fire to become immortal and remain with her forever, and that together they can become the immortal and all-powerful rulers of the world. After a perilous journey, they come to a great cavern, but at the last Leo doubts the safety of entering the flame. To allay his fears, Ayesha steps into the Spirit of Life, but with this second immersion, the life-preserving power is lost and Ayesha begins to revert to her true age. Holly speculates that it may be that a second exposure undoes the effects of the previous or the Spirit of Life spews death on occasion. <b>Before</b> <b>their</b> <b>eyes,</b> Ayesha withers away in the fire, and her body shrinks. The sight is so shocking that Job dies in fright. Before dying, She tells Leo, [...] "Forget me not. I shall come again!" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{outcome was}} never in doubt. [...] The jury found all the {{defendants}} guilty, and the Lord Chief Justice Sir John Popham pronounced them guilty of high treason. [...] The Attorney General Sir Edward Coke told the court {{that each of the}} condemned would be drawn backwards to his death, by a horse, his head near the ground. [...] They were to be [...] "put to death halfway between heaven and earth as unworthy of both". [...] Their genitals would be cut off and burnt <b>before</b> <b>their</b> <b>eyes,</b> and their bowels and hearts removed.

[...] Fawkes's and Tresham's testimony regarding the Spanish treason was read aloud, as well as confessions related specifically to the Gunpowder Plot. [...] The last piece of evidence offered was a conversation between Fawkes and Wintour, who had been kept in adjacent cells. [...] The two men apparently thought they had been speaking in private, but their conversation was intercepted by a government spy. [...] When the prisoners were allowed to speak, Fawkes explained his not guilty plea as ignorance of certain aspects of the indictment.|$|E

When Marle volunteers to be teleported, her pendant interferes with the device and creates a time portal into which she is drawn. [...] After Crono and Lucca separately recreate the portal and find themselves in AD 600, they find Marle only to see her vanish <b>before</b> <b>their</b> <b>eyes.</b> Lucca realizes that this time period's kingdom has mistaken Marle for an ancestor of hers who had been kidnapped, thus putting off the recovery effort for her ancestor and creating a grandfather paradox. Crono and Lucca, {{with the help of}} Frog, restore history to normal by recovering the kidnapped queen. After the three part ways with Frog and return to the present, Crono is arrested on charges of kidnapping the princess and sentenced to death by the current chancellor of Guardia. Lucca and Marle help Crono to flee, haphazardly using another time portal to escape their pursuers. This portal lands them in AD 2300, where they learn that an advanced civilization has been wiped out by a giant creature known as Lavos that appeared in 1999. The three vow {{to find a way to}} prevent the future destruction of their world. After meeting and repairing Robo, Crono and his friends find Gaspar, an old sage at the End of Time, who helps them acquire magical powers and travel through time by way of several pillars of light.|$|E
