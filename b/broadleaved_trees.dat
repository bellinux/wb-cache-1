25|$|Meripilus giganteus is a polypore fungus in {{the family}} Meripilaceae.

This bracket fungus, {{commonly known as the}} giant polypore or black-staining polypore, is often found in large clumps at the base of trees, although fruiting bodies are sometimes found some distance away from the trunk, parasitizing the roots. M. giganteus has a circumboreal distribution in the northern Hemisphere, and is widely distributed in Europe. In the field, it is recognizable by the large, multi-capped fruiting body, as well as its pore surface that quickly darkens black when bruised or injured.|$|E

25|$|As with coppicing, only {{species with}} {{vigorous}} epicormic growth {{may be made}} into pollards. In these species (which include many <b>broadleaved</b> <b>trees</b> but few conifers), removal of the main apical stems releases the growth of many dormant buds under the bark on {{the lower part of}} the tree. Trees without this growth will, of course, die without their leaves and branches. Some smaller tree species do not readily form pollards, because cutting the main stem stimulates growth from the base, effectively forming a coppice stool instead. Examples of trees that do well as pollards include broadleaves such as beeches (Fagus), oaks (Quercus), maples (Acer), black locust or false acacia (Robinia pseudoacacia), hornbeams (Carpinus), lindens and limes (Tilia), planes (Platanus), horse chestnuts (Aesculus), mulberries (Morus), redbud (Cercis canadensis), tree of heaven (Ailanthus altissima), willows (Salix), and a few conifers, such as yews (Taxus).|$|E

This paper illustrates a tree-oriented silviculture approach with an application in a Turkey oak coppice stand in Central Italy. This silvicultural approach has been developed in the last decades in France, Germany, Switzerland. The rationale behind the tree-oriented approach is to select a number of target sporadic tree species with valuable timber and to support their growth through repeated thinning from above. We tested the effectiveness of this silviculture approach as an alternative to customary coppice management in Italy, which is traditionally focused on the dominant tree species and does not consider valuable <b>broadleaved</b> <b>tree</b> species.

Red deer (Cervus elaphus), roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and wild boar (Sus scrofa) had a large impact on regeneration dynamics, as was established by comparing 20 pairs of fenced and unfenced plots (40 m x 40 m) during a 10 -year period. A fivefold reduction of total herbivore biomass to 500 kg per kmr, resulted in a strong increase of shrub and tree sapling numbers in all vegetation types.

40|$|Reforestation of {{agricultural}} land in many European countries has progressed {{more slowly than}} anticipated. Many years’ fertilization has caused an accumulation of nutrients in the top soil layer. Phosphorus (P) {{has proven to be}} particularly persistent and elevated concentrations in soil and vegetation are found up to thousands of years after agricultural abandonment. This persistently elevated bioavailable P is a paradox for ecosystem recovery in post-agricultural forests: on one hand, higher P bioavailability stimulates stand productivity and tree growth but, on the other hand, it limits the development of typical forest plant communities (Baeten et al. in press) and associated organisms. Limitation of bioavailable P seems to be a necessity for the recovery of species-rich target communities and for the conservation of endangered species (Wassen et al. 2005). Reforestation {{of agricultural}} land results in a decrease in soil pH with increasing forest age, but the extent and rate of soil acidification differs highly between tree species. Gymnosperm tree species are often contrasted to angiosperms because of their acidifying impact on soils. We will present data showing that rapid (within 2 decades) changes in soil properties can also occur beneath different <b>broadleaved</b> <b>tree</b> species. Ca concentra¬tions in leaf litter seem to be the driving factor for differences between species: tree species with higher litter Ca concentrations such as Populus and Fraxinus support a significantly higher soil pH, base saturation degree and lower quantities of bioavailable aluminum compared to the Ca-poor Fagus and Quercus species. Tilia and Prunus trees are intermediate between these ‘soil preservers’ and ‘soil acidifiers’. Furthermore, tree species have a major influence on the short-term and long-term bioavailability of P. Below ‘soil acidifiers’ we found significantly higher bioavailable and slowly cycling P fractions compared to ‘soil preservers’ which mainly retained P in less soluble pools. To date, there are no integrated studies on the long-term effect of different <b>broadleaved</b> <b>tree</b> species on soil properties in general and the bioavailability of P through soil acidification in particular. Most studies evaluating the bioavailability of P use extraction methods that only provide short-term dose-response insights into the readily available P pool for plants and soil microbes. However, for studying the role of P in recovering (semi) natural ecosystems, it is much more relevant to gain insight into time-scales extending a single growing season (Richter et al. 2006) and to include more slowly cycling P fractions. We discuss six common garden experiments in which <b>broadleaved</b> <b>tree</b> species have been planted on loamy agricultural soil for between 5 and 35 years. We argue that vegetation choice can be an important driver of regional biogeochemistry and biodiversity...|$|R
