Modern enthusiasts rediscovering Moringa call it the Miracle tree because of its many uses. In Africa its leaves are used in medicine and in cooking, and, latterly, as dietary supplements for AIDS/HIV patients; in India its pods are preferred; its oil was used in Egypt 3, 000 years ago in perfume, and in Jamaica 200 years ago in cooking. The water cleansing qualities of its dirt-gathering (coagulant) powdered seeds have been known for centuries in Sudan, India and Indonesia. Encouraging its use and expanding its cultivation from family farms to plantation scale were the major topics of a workshop on the 'Development potential for Moringa products' held in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, from 29 October to 2 November 2001. Organised by the plant resources network PROPAGE, in collaboration with CTA and four other partners, it was attended by more than 100 practitioners from public and private bodies from five continents. A productive workshop it was too (though perhaps not a miracle) with 22 practical proposals for research on genetic improvement, intensive cultivation, uses in fruit storage, improved oil extraction and market development.

Species of yeast from genus of Saccharomyses, e. g. Saccharomyses serivisae is wellknown as microorganism that can ferment sugar (glucose) into alchohol and CO 2. This natural process as well happen in aren sap, so that this substance potencially using as a swollen agent of bread or cake dough. This research objective is to recognize the effectiveness of aren sap as a swollen agent of bread dough. Fermentation duration of bread dough was one hour by using swollen agent of fresh, 10 hours old and 20 hours old of aren sap.
