40|$|The {{problem of}} heat losses from open liquid filled tanks {{is as old}} as {{industry}} itself. This paper will present the advantages of using an insulating blanket of hollow plastic spheres as a mechanism to conserve this type of industrial energy loss. FIRST: The theory of a floating <b>ball</b> <b>blanket</b> will be covered. Claims on the effectiveness of a <b>ball</b> <b>blanket</b> will be substantiated by results obtained from independent testing laboratories. Slides and graphs of these results, as well as photographs of industrial applications will be presented. NEXT: Attention will be given to specific industries in which open tank energy loss is common. Metal finishing, chemical manufacturing, power generation, sewage/wastewater, and food manufacturing will be highlighted. Other benefits obtainable from floating ball blankets, such as evaporation control and odor control will be briefly discussed. Questions and answers of specific interest from conference attendees will be answered following the presentation. Various methods are available to industry to reduce open tank heating losses. I will present information on the use of an insulating blanket of floating balls to conserve on these open tank heating losses. Where test results are referred to, please keep in mind that these tests were conducted by Capricorn Chemicals Corporation on ALLPLAS type floating ball blankets. ALLPLAS balls are patented by Capricorn Chemicals Corporation...|$|E

The terrier sits on top of the crest with a <b>ball</b> on a <b>blanket</b> of blue and white stripes. The Terriers was introduced to the badge shortly after [...] "The Terriers" [...] was adopted as the nickname and mascot of the club.|$|R

You and your {{people may not}} touch us, but there's other redskins about, and I wouldn't give a beaver's skin for our sculps ef we were to take the back trail to the {{settlements}} without arms in our hands. Besides that, we've among us {{the father of the}} gal who was stole far away off from Lake Champlain, and a relative of hers whose parents you've killed down on the lake. Ef we were to agree to give up our arms, it stands to reason it aint likely they'd agree to give up the gals. No, no, chief; your terms aren't reasonable. But I tell ye what we will do; ef you'll give us your word that neither you nor your tribe'll molest us in our retreat we'll go back to the settlements, and 'll engage that, when we get back there, we'll send you nine of the best rifles money can buy, with plenty of powder and <b>ball,</b> and <b>blankets</b> and such like." ...|$|R
