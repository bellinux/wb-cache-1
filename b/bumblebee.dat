5|$|The world's first <b>bumblebee</b> {{sanctuary}} {{was established}} at Vane Farm in the Loch Leven National Nature Reserve in Scotland in 2008. In 2011, London's Natural History Museum led {{the establishment of}} an International Union for the Conservation of Nature <b>Bumblebee</b> Specialist Group, chaired by Dr. Paul H. Williams, to assess the threat status of <b>bumblebee</b> species worldwide using Red List criteria.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bumblebee</b> is {{the name}} of a {{prominent}} character in the Transformers franchise. His name denotes his black-on-yellow vehicle paint job, directly referencing the bee genus because of its black and yellow stripes. <b>Bumblebee</b> is also the name of an automotive racing stripe that wraps around the grill instead of down the centre of the vehicle; it can be found mainly on Chevrolet Camaros (which happens to be the Transformers Autobot's most popular vehicle mode).|$|E
50|$|In 2013 the {{parasite}} was identified, {{along with several}} others, to be infecting <b>bumblebees</b> imported into the UK and potentially in <b>bumblebees</b> imported around Europe. In 2014 {{the parasite}} was identified {{to be present in}} a large numbers of <b>bumblebees</b> in England. This prevalence was greatest in <b>bumblebees</b> which foraged close to farms using commercial (imported) <b>bumblebees.</b> Whilst it's not clear if this pattern is a result of parasite spillover, {{it is clear that the}} prevalence in England is far greater than previously detected.|$|R
40|$|<b>Bumblebees</b> are {{important}} pollinators of many crops and wild flowers {{and there are}} both conservation and economic reasons for taking action {{to assess the impact}} of pesticides on <b>bumblebees.</b> Pesticide risk assessments for honeybees are based on hazard ratios which rely on application rates and toxicity data and are unlikely to be appropriate for <b>bumblebees.</b> <b>Bumblebees</b> are active at different times and on different crop species and are, therefore, likely to have different exposure profiles. Unlike honeybees, deaths of <b>bumblebees</b> due to pesticides are unlikely to be reported, since the bees are not kept domestically and will die in small numbers. This paper highlights the differences in the potential risk posed by pesticides to <b>bumblebees</b> from that of honeybees. This is based on their exposure through use of crops and flowering weeds and on available data on toxicity of pesticides. This information is also intended as a source document for information on the foraging behavior and phenology of <b>bumblebees</b> for use in risk assessment for pesticides...|$|R

5|$|Sam and {{his high}} school crush Mikaela Banes are rescued from Barricade and Frenzy by the Camaro who {{turns out to be}} Autobot scout <b>Bumblebee,</b> but he is mute and has to {{communicate}} through his car radio. Previously sending a beacon to his fellow Autobots, <b>Bumblebee</b> takes Sam and Mikaela to meet the new arrivals – Optimus, Jazz, Ironhide, and Ratchet. Optimus explains the details of their situation, revealing that if Megatron gained the AllSpark he would transform Earth’s machinery into a new army and exterminate mankind. Sam, Mikaela, and the Autobots travel to Sam’s house to retrieve the glasses, but the teenagers are captured by agents of Sector Seven, a top secret government branch, led by Seymour Simmons. The Autobots stop the agents, but they call for backup, who take Sam, Mikaela, and <b>Bumblebee</b> into custody, while Optimus obtains the glasses, and uses them to locate the Allspark.|$|E
5|$|The Autobot {{campaign}} {{starts with}} Zeta Prime, {{leader of the}} Autobots, being reported dead by scout <b>Bumblebee</b> who personally informs Optimus of this. Optimus then decides to temporarily take the mantle of leadership. Optimus, <b>Bumblebee,</b> and Optimus' friend Ratchet lead a defensive campaign to protect their home city of Iacon. The trio activate the city's defense guns and reactivate the communication grid. They then travel to the Decagon Plaza where the three Autobots battle the former Autobot Starscream and after severely wounding him, they force him to retreat.|$|E

50|$|Since cuckoo <b>bumblebees</b> do {{not need}} to supply {{resources}} to their young, they do not tend to forage as aggressively or industriously as worker and queen <b>bumblebees.</b> Before entering a nest, cuckoo <b>bumblebees</b> bees tend to behave similar to male bumblebees—drinking nectar until full and then resting until hungry again.|$|R

5|$|A <b>bumblebee</b> (also written bumble bee) is {{a member}} of the genus Bombus, part of Apidae, one of the bee families. This genus is the only extant group in the tribe Bombini, though a few extinct related genera (e.g., Calyptapis) are known from fossils. Over 250 species of <b>bumblebee</b> are known. They are found {{primarily}} in higher altitudes or latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere, although they are also found in South America where a few lowland tropical species have been identified. European bumblebees have also been introduced to New Zealand and Tasmania. The brood parasitic or cuckoo bumblebees have sometimes been classified as a subgenus or genus, Psithyrus, but are now usually treated as members of Bombus.|$|E
5|$|According to 20th-century folklore, {{the laws}} of {{aerodynamics}} prove the <b>bumblebee</b> should be incapable of flight, as {{it does not have}} the capacity (in terms of wing size or beats per second) to achieve flight with the degree of wing loading necessary.|$|E
5|$|Back in Shanghai, Optimus takes {{down the}} colossal Decepticon known as Devastator, and {{retrieves}} {{a piece of}} Cybertronian technology unearthed by Devastator. Optimus and Ironhide find that <b>Bumblebee</b> is missing, and they learn {{that he has been}} taken by Starscream. Megatron reveals himself to the Autobots, and challenges Optimus to one final fight. Meanwhile, <b>Bumblebee</b> is released by Jetfire, who has been taken captive by the Decepticons. Optimus and Megatron battle, ending with Optimus close to death. Jetfire places Optimus's body in an escape pod, where Optimus's eyes light up, revealing that he is still clinging to life. Starscream and Megatron take the last piece of Cybertronian technology.|$|E
5|$|Pollen {{is removed}} from flowers {{deliberately}} or incidentally by <b>bumblebees.</b> Incidental removal occurs when <b>bumblebees</b> {{come in contact with}} the anthers of a flower while collecting nectar. When it enters a flower, the <b>bumblebee's</b> body hairs receive a dusting of pollen from the anthers. In queens and workers this is then groomed into the corbiculae (pollen baskets) on the hind legs where it can be seen as bulging masses that may contain as many as a million pollen grains. Male <b>bumblebees</b> do not have corbiculae and do not purposively collect pollen. <b>Bumblebees</b> are also capable of buzz pollination, in which they dislodge pollen from the anthers by creating a resonant vibration with their flight muscles.|$|R
500|$|The chill-coma {{temperature}} {{in relation to}} flying insects is the temperature at which flight muscles cannot be activated. Compared to honey bees and carpenter bees, <b>bumblebees</b> have the lowest chill-coma temperature. Of the <b>bumblebees</b> Bombus bimaculatus has the lowest at [...] However, <b>bumblebees</b> have been seen to fly in colder ambient temperatures. This discrepancy is likely because the chill-coma temperature was determined by tests done in a laboratory setting. However, <b>bumblebees</b> live in insulated shelters and can shiver to warm up before venturing into the cold.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide a ready means of {{identifying}} <b>bumblebees</b> found in Nebraska. It is for both amateur and professional entomologists. Included are an annotated list of the <b>bumblebees</b> found in Nebraska, artificial keys for species determination, a glossary for those not acquainted with the terminology used in the keys, a list of flower preferences and biological notes pertaining to <b>bumblebees</b> in Nebraska. The keys for identification include a few species of <b>bumblebees</b> which have not yet been collected in Nebraska but which may occur in the state...|$|R
5|$|Kitti's hog-nosed bat (Craseonycteris thonglongyai), {{also known}} as the <b>bumblebee</b> bat, is a {{vulnerable}} species of bat and the only extant member of the family Craseonycteridae. It occurs in western Thailand and southeast Myanmar, where it occupies limestone caves along rivers.|$|E
5|$|Nest size {{depends on}} species of <b>bumblebee.</b> Most form colonies of between 50 and 400 individuals, but colonies have been {{documented}} as small as ~20 individuals and as large as 1700. These nests are small compared to honeybee hives, which hold about 50,000 bees. Many species nest underground, choosing old rodent burrows or sheltered places, and avoiding places that receive direct sunlight {{that could result in}} overheating. Other species make nests above ground, whether in thick grass or in holes in trees. A <b>bumblebee</b> nest is not organised into hexagonal combs like that of a honeybee; the cells are instead clustered together untidily. The workers remove dead bees or larvae from the nest and deposit them outside the nest entrance, helping to prevent disease. Nests in temperate regions last only for a single season and do not survive the winter.|$|E
5|$|The {{department}} of entomology has done several studies in apiculture, chemical ecology, horticultural pollination, and the behavior of honeybee and <b>bumblebee</b> colonies. Although some research {{was done in the}} apiary yards, the majority of data had to be collected with higher numbers of colonies at different experimental stations.|$|E
50|$|Records of nectar robbing {{in nature}} date {{back at least}} to 1793 when German naturalist Christian Konrad Sprengel {{observed}} <b>bumblebees</b> perforating flowers. Charles Darwin observed <b>bumblebees</b> stealing nectar from flowers in 1859.|$|R
40|$|Flying insects {{frequently}} navigate through environments {{of different}} complexity. In this study, buff-tailed <b>bumblebees</b> (Bombus terrestris L.) {{were trained to}} fly along tunnels of different widths, from 60 to 240 cm. In tunnel widths of 60 and 120 cm, <b>bumblebees</b> control their lateral position by balancing the magnitude of translational optic flow experienced in the lateral visual field of each eye. In wider tunnels, <b>bumblebees</b> use translational optic flow cues in the ventral visual field to control their lateral position and to steer along straight tracks. Our results also suggest that <b>bumblebees</b> prefer to fly over surfaces that provide strong ventral optic flow cues, rather than over featureless ones. Together, these strategies allow <b>bumblebees</b> {{to minimize the risk}} of collision and to maintain relatively straight flight paths in a broad range of environments...|$|R
40|$|Competitive {{ability of}} {{transgenic}} oilseed rape transformed with a pea lectin gene was estimated by comparisons of its performance when grown {{in a mixture}} with its non-transgenic counterpart and when grown singly, with and without pollen beetles present. The experiments were carried out in cages, once with <b>bumblebees</b> as pollinators and once without. In the absence of herbivory but {{with the presence of}} <b>bumblebees,</b> singly grown plant lines without lectin generally performed better than lines with lectin. Pollen beetles affected plant growth and reproduction, but there were no consistent differences between the lectin and non-lectin plant lines indicating that the transgenic trait did not protect plants from pest attack. Herbivory reduced the number of seeds when <b>bumblebees</b> were present. In the absence of <b>bumblebees,</b> however, plants produced more seeds with pollen beetles than without, indicating that some pollination was carried out by the beetles. Efficient pollination affected the competitive abilities of the lines; lectin lines were more competitive with <b>bumblebees</b> present and the reverse was true when <b>bumblebees</b> were absent. In the presence of <b>bumblebees,</b> lectin lines gained from being grown mixed with its non-transgenic counterpart. Because the transgenic plants expressed pea lectin in developing pollen it is possible that pollen quality in those plants was reduced, which may explain why the lectin lines had an advantage over non-lectin lines when exchange of pollen between the two plant types was facilitated by <b>bumblebees...</b>|$|R
5|$|A second {{accident}} {{occurred on}} October 11, 2010, in Washington, D.C. While filming a chase scene at 3rd Street and Maryland Avenue, SW, a Metropolitan Police K9 Unit SUV accidentally rammed the Camaro that portrays <b>Bumblebee</b> in the film. The area {{had been closed}} off by the Washington, D.C., police, and it is unclear why the SUV was there. Both drivers were uninjured, but the Camaro was severely damaged.|$|E
5|$|Apples are self-incompatible; {{they must}} cross-pollinate to develop fruit. During the {{flowering}} each season, apple growers often utilize pollinators to carry pollen. Honey bees are most commonly used. Orchard mason bees {{are also used}} as supplemental pollinators in commercial orchards. <b>Bumblebee</b> queens are sometimes present in orchards, but not usually in enough quantity to be significant pollinators.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bumblebee</b> {{conservation}} {{is in its}} infancy {{in many parts of}} the world, but with the realization of the important part they play in pollination of crops, efforts are being made to manage farmland better. Enhancing the wild bee population can be done by the planting of wildflower strips, and in New Zealand, bee nesting boxes have achieved some success, perhaps because there are few burrowing mammals to provide potential nesting sites in that country.|$|E
40|$|Chemical {{substances}} {{are transferred}} between <b>bumblebees</b> {{of the species}} Bombus terrestris during their mating behavior. These substances are present mainly on the cuticle. The aim of this thesis was to identify and quantitatify differences {{in the amount of}} the compounds among defined groups of <b>bumblebees</b> - mated, non-mated and attempting to mate. Cuticular extracts were obtained by washing of the whole <b>bumblebees</b> bodies in hexane. These extracts were analyzed by using a two-dimensional gas chromatography with the time of fly mass spectrometr (GCxGC-TOF/MS). Cuticular hydrocarbons were identified and semi-quantified. Double bounds locations were determined in heptacosene and nonacosene. Five compounds were differed in the examined groups - β-springene, α-springene, dihydrofarnesyl-oleate, palmityl-palmitate and palmityl- palmitoleate. By comparing of the amount of these compounds differences between defined groups of <b>bumblebees</b> were determined. Analysis of the cutilar extracts showed that mated and non-mated <b>bumblebees</b> can be distinguished. Furthermore, there were statistically significant differences in the amounts of identified compounds in all defined groups of <b>bumblebees.</b> Key words: two-dimensional gas chromatography, Bombus terrestris, cutilar extrac...|$|R
5|$|<b>Bumblebees,</b> {{despite their}} ability to sting, are eaten by certain predators. Nests may be dug up by badgers and eaten whole, {{including}} any adults present. Adults are preyed upon by robber flies and beewolves in North America. In Europe, birds including bee-eaters and shrikes capture adult <b>bumblebees</b> on the wing; smaller birds such as great tits also occasionally learn to take <b>bumblebees,</b> while camouflaged crab spiders catch them as they visit flowers.|$|R
40|$|<b>Bumblebees</b> (Bombus spp.) and honeybees, Apis mellifera, both use odour cues {{deposited}} on flowers by previous visitors {{to improve their}} foraging efficiency. Short-lived repellent scents are used to avoid probing flowers that have recently been depleted of nectar and/or pollen, and longer-term attractant scents to indicate particularly rewarding flowers. Previous {{research has indicated that}} <b>bumblebees</b> avoid flowers recently visited by themselves, conspecifics and congeners, while honeybees avoid flowers visited by themselves or conspecifics only. We found that both <b>bumblebees</b> and honeybees also avoided flowers previously visited by each other when foraging on Melilotus officinalis, that is, <b>bumblebees</b> avoided flowers recently visited by honeybees and vice versa. Twenty-four hours after a visit, this effect had worn off. Honeybees visited flowers that had been visited 24 h previously more often than flowers that had never been visited. The same was not true for <b>bumblebees,</b> suggesting that foraging honeybees were also using long-term attractant scent marks, whilst <b>bumblebees</b> were not. Flowers previously visited by conspecifics were repellent to <b>bumblebees</b> and honeybees for ca. 40 min. During this time, nectar replenished in flowers. Honeybees were previously thought to use a volatile chemical (2 - heptanone) as a repellent forage-marking scent. We suggest that they may be using a less volatile chemical odour to detect whether flowers have recently been visited, possibly in addition to 2 -heptanone...|$|R
5|$|Bumblebees are {{parasitised}} by tracheal mites, Locustacarus buchneri; protozoans including Crithidia bombi and Apicystis bombi; and microsporidians including Nosema bombi and Nosema ceranae. The tree <b>bumblebee</b> B. hypnorum {{has spread}} into the United Kingdom despite hosting {{high levels of}} a nematode that normally interferes with queen bees' attempts to establish colonies. Deformed wing virus {{has been found to}} affect 11% of bumblebees in Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|Insects {{recorded}} visiting white-flowered plants {{include the}} Australian painted lady (Vanessa kershawi) and yellow admiral (V. itea), {{as well as}} bees. Field work in southern Tasmania showed that the introduced <b>bumblebee</b> (Bombus terrestris) sometimes robbed nectar by piercing {{the base of the}} tube. This then allowed honeybees (Apis mellifera) to retrieve nectar the same way. Epacris impressa is host to the scale insect Lecanodiaspis microcribraria.|$|E
5|$|Many {{bumblebees}} {{are social}} insects that form colonies {{with a single}} queen. The colonies are smaller than those of honey bees, growing to as few as 50 individuals in a nest. Female bumblebees can sting repeatedly, but generally ignore humans and other animals. Cuckoo bumblebees do not make nests; their queens aggressively invade the nests of other <b>bumblebee</b> species, kill the resident queens and then lay their own eggs, which are cared for by the resident workers.|$|E
5|$|Like their {{relatives}} the honeybees, <b>bumblebees</b> feed on nectar, using their long hairy tongues to lap up the liquid; the proboscis is folded under the head during flight. <b>Bumblebees</b> gather nectar {{to add to}} the stores in the nest, and pollen to feed their young. They forage using colour and spatial relationships to identify flowers to feed from. Some <b>bumblebees</b> rob nectar, making a hole near the base of a flower to access the nectar while avoiding pollen transfer. <b>Bumblebees</b> are important agricultural pollinators, so their decline in Europe, North America, and Asia is a cause for concern. The decline has been caused by habitat loss, the mechanisation of agriculture, and pesticides.|$|R
50|$|Apicystis bombi is {{a species}} of {{parasitic}} alveolates in the phylum Apicomplexa. It infects bees, especially <b>bumblebees.</b> It {{is believed to have}} a cosmopolitan distribution in <b>bumblebees</b> and a sporadic occurrence in honey bees, and causes disease symptoms in nonresistant bee species.|$|R
50|$|Its main hosts are <b>bumblebees</b> of the {{subgenus}} Thoracobombus such as Bombus pascuorum (common carder bee). In continental Europe, it also parasitizes nests of brown-banded carder bees (Bombus humilis) {{and early}} <b>bumblebees</b> (Bombus pratorum; although {{the latter is}} a Pyrobombus, not a Thoracobombus).|$|R
