50|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} aspects of Throughput Accounting is the relevance of the information it produces. Throughput Accounting reports what currently happens in business functions such as operations, distribution and marketing. It does not rely solely on GAAP's financial accounting reports (that still need to be verified by external auditors) and is thus relevant to current decisions made by management that affect the business now and in the future. Throughput Accounting is used in Critical Chain Project Management (CCPM), Drum <b>Buffer</b> <b>Rope</b> (DBR)—in businesses that are internally constrained, in Simplified Drum <b>Buffer</b> <b>Rope</b> (S-DBR) —in businesses that are externally constrained (particularly where the lack of customer orders denotes a market constraint), as well as in strategy, planning and tactics, etc.|$|E
5000|$|While {{originally}} {{focused on}} manufacturing and logistics, TOC has expanded lately into sales management and marketing. Its role is explicitly acknowledged {{in the field}} of sales process engineering. [...] For effective sales management one can apply Drum <b>Buffer</b> <b>Rope</b> to the sales process similar to the way it is applied to operations (see Reengineering the Sales Process book reference below). This technique is appropriate when your constraint is in the sales process itself or you just want an effective sales management technique and includes the topics of funnel management and conversion rates.|$|E

In doing so, this research contributes in two ways. For practitioners, this research is the first to show how S-DBR methodology can be utilised to improve the performance of labour relations. For academicians, this research is one of only a few to address the how questions of S-DBR use in a service context...|$|E
40|$|This article {{describes}} how {{finite capacity scheduling}} techniques were applied in an ERP environment. Finite capacity techniques were first introduced in the 1980 ’s and were brought to prominence by Eli Goldratt who developed ‘OPT’, arguably the first APS (Advanced Planning System), and wrote “The Goal”. Many companies have used the techniques of bottleneck theory to improve their business performance with or without APS software. However, the adoption of JIT and subsequent adoption of lean techniques especially in industries such as automotive where efficiencies are gained from levelled scheduling of common components, with little variation in standard times, has meant that finite capacity scheduling has {{lost some of its}} previous favour. THE ‘DRUM <b>BUFFER</b> <b>ROPE</b> SYSTEM’ The ‘drum <b>buffer</b> <b>rope</b> system ’ is an analogous title, which attempts to explain the concept of synchronised manufacturing ie. moving material quickly and smoothly through the various resources in a manufacturing system in concert with demand. The analogy used is a troop of soldiers on a forced march. In any troop of soldiers there are some that march faster than others. Were there no controls in place, the soldiers would spread apart, analogous to increasing inventory. If the slowest soldier {{is in the middle of}} the troop, then the soldiers following him will always be on his heels. The gaps therefore will spread in front of the slowest soldier. By linking the slowest soldier (in the middle of the troop) with a ‘rope ’ to the soldier at the front of the troop, the length of rope chosen will determine the size of this gap. The troop is then forced to march at the pace of a ‘drum ’ beating a pace no faster than the maximum pace of the slowest soldier: the ‘drum ’ beat is analogous to the rate of customer demand and the whole troop can walk no faster than the slowest soldier. In summary the ‘drum <b>buffer</b> <b>rope</b> ’ system attempts to optimise the whole manufacturing system by balancing the flow through a manufacturing system rather than the traditional approach of optimising each individual workstation to balance their various capacities. The outcome is resources only produce what is needed, when it is needed, rather than creating unnecessary work in progress. Moreover unlike the Just-in-Time system, bottleneck operations are protected from disruption with a planned level of work in progress (length of rope) ...|$|E
40|$|The article {{deals with}} {{design of the}} {{logistic}} principles enabling an enterprise to create a strategy flexible in terms of business and marketing and stable and steady in terms of manufacturing. In {{order to create a}} strategy model the following principles can be applied: shortening the period of capacity planning combined with flexible planning, SYNCRO – MRP (Material Required Planning) principle, the application of forecasting in capacity planning, creation with partners of one of the cooperation forms such as supply chain, demand chain, lean supply chain, agile supply chain, leagile supply chain, and using the DBR (Drum <b>Buffer</b> <b>Rope),</b> APS (Advanced Planning System) and SCP (Supply Chain Planning) systems.

40|$|This paper aims to {{introduce}} System Dynamics (SD) in applying Drum <b>Buffer</b> <b>Rope</b> (DBR) methodology of Theory of Constraints (TOC) in a three-stage flow shop system {{that produces a}} single product. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, although {{there are a lot of}} TOC applications using discrete simulation in production scheduling with DBR methodology, there are not any TOC application of DBR methodology in production scheduling using System Dynamics. We firstly present a conceptual model of the production planning and control and raw material procurement processes of a flow shop, based on the concept of the Capacity Constraint Resource (CCR), which is the corner stone of the TOC philosophy. Then, we present the stock and flow diagram of the system under study. According to the results of an illustrative example, it reveals that the driving force of the production and raw materials procurement processes of the flow shop is its CCR schedule. The system response to pulse and wavy changes in demand is examined as well. Moreover, by means of the simulation results, the efficiency of DBR production scheduling approach is contrasted with the well known anchoring and adjustment approach of Sterman...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays steel {{manufacturing}} pays {{a critical}} attention to on-time delivery and inventory reduction. In our study, we propose a heuristic algorithm {{to solve the}} hybrid flow shop scheduling problem (HFSP) considering reducing total tardiness and inventory time. In order to achieve a feasible solution in limited computational time, the algorithm is based on Three-zone Buffer Management (TZBM) approach. TZBM approach combines the Drum <b>Buffer</b> <b>Rope</b> (DBR) method proposed in theory of constraints (TOC), with a contract net protocol in multi-agent system (MAS). The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is shown by simulation results comparing with the results obtained by a Tabu search (TS) algorithm. In the production field, a shipment buffer is set between the due date and the shipping {{time in order to}} avoid possible late shipment. The size of shipment buffer is always decided according to the experience of a system operator who has responsibility to draw up a production schedule. Wherein, an operator needs to take a decision considering trade-off between on-time delivery and inventory reduction. Therefore, a new interactive decision support system is proposed which is based on the two-stage TZBM approach. The operator needs to make his/her judgment whether an optimal solution shown by the system is preferable or not, then to change the trade-off between the two conflicting objectives. The system needs to compute another optimal solution according to judgment given by the operator. Under the result of numerical experiments, to integrate the experience of operators with the computational intelligence of systems proves to be an effective scheduling method...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to evaluate Demand Driven Material Requirements Planning (DDMRP) in the context of improving the performance of a printing ink manufacturing company. The main issues the company is facing include poor due-date performance, stock levels not corresponding to the actual market needs and overall system instability leading to inefficiencies. The research evaluates the assumption underpinning Material Requirements Planning (MRP) and the Theory of Constraints (TOC) before considering their integration to meet the requirements of this company, with particular reference to a recent development entitled DDMRP. Design/methodology/approach – Case research was used to establish the underlying issues through semi-structured interviews, observation, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) data and questionnaires. This analysis was then compared with the assumption underpinning generic TOC solutions before conducting a simulated evaluation to compare past ERP decision making with DDMRP. Findings – DDMRP is shown to embody the concepts of buffer aggregation and buffer management within the context of dependent demand planning, effectively integrating MRP and TOC. The underlying production planning and control issues of the company were found to be consistent with the literature associated with the limitations of MRP and a good fit for the core issues traditionally addressed through TOC applications such as Drum <b>Buffer</b> <b>Rope</b> (DBR). The integration of this aggregated buffer management approach with MRP dependent demand within DDMRP provided further enhancements applicable to the company. This evaluation involved simulation, which shows the merits of DDMRP in the area of standardization of production-relevant decision-making and stock adjustment towards improving availability shown by roughly 45 % reduction of high and low inventory alerts and a 95 % reduction of stock outs over the period in focus. However, it is acknowledged that the improved simulated performance was not fully attributable to the adoption of DDMRP concepts. Research limitations/implications – The document uses a selection of relevant pieces of the literature from the areas of MRP/ERP, continuous improvement and DDMRP that have the potential to be supportive for assessing DDMRP as a performance improving methodology. However, since the amount of literature available on DDMRP is very limited, a comparison of the results with others’ findings is not possible. Furthermore, the primary data used originates from one specific company only. The resulting case study approach is therefore limited to a single case, which might limit the generalizability of the findings to an extent. However, since many companies are suffering from MRP shortcomings and TOC ideas like buffer management or dynamic buffers have been proven to deliver promising results in many applications, at least an assumption of a certain degree of generalizability could be justified. Further research needs to verify if the findings are replicable in comparable scenarios. Originality/value – DDMRP is a new commercial development that has not previously been the subject of a research study. The value {{of this research is}} in evaluating the key features of this planning and control system using real company data. By doing this, {{it is one of the}} first published projects in this area...|$|E
