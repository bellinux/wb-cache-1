25|$|Reaction 3 {{describes}} the hydration of olivine with water only to yield serpentine and Mg(OH)2 (brucite). Serpentine is stable at high pH {{in the presence}} of brucite like calcium silicate hydrate, (C-S-H) phases formed along with portlandite (Ca(OH)2) in hardened Portland cement paste after the hydration of <b>belite</b> (Ca2SiO4), the artificial calcium equivalent of forsterite.|$|E
25|$|Portland cement is {{the most}} common type of cement in general usage. It is a basic {{ingredient}} of concrete, mortar and many plasters. British masonry worker Joseph Aspdin patented Portland cement in 1824. It was named because of the similarity of its color to Portland limestone, quarried from the English Isle of Portland and used extensively in London architecture. It consists of a mixture of calcium silicates (alite, <b>belite),</b> aluminates and ferrites - compounds which combine calcium, silicon, aluminium and iron in forms which will react with water. Portland cement and similar materials are made by heating limestone (a source of calcium) with clay or shale (a source of silicon, aluminium and iron) and grinding this product (called clinker) with a source of sulfate (most commonly gypsum).|$|E
25|$|Work {{began on}} the {{southern}} approach road in July 1972 by Clugston Construction of Scunthorpe. The 2.5km approach road to the A1077 junction, by Costain Civil Engineering began in September 1976. It included a 320m span from the southern anchorage of seven pre-stressed concrete box sections, and the A1077 junction, costing £4.25million. Work on the bridge substructure (foundations) began in March 1973. To reduce heat of hydration in the concrete, which produces calcium silicate hydrate from <b>belite,</b> as much as 60% of the Portland cement was replaced with ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBS). It took longer to build the southern anchorage due to a diaphragm wall design due to not enough shallow bedrock. The main southern approach roads from Barton to the M180 motorway junction at Barnetby {{were built in the}} late 1970s by Clugston Construction of Scunthorpe, opening in 1978.|$|E

[...] A <b>Belite</b> was [...] "mauled" [...] by an artificial bear claw with the damage being limited to the fabric skin of the rear fuselage and vertical stabilizer.

2500|$|Setting {{time and}} [...] "early strength" [...] are {{important}} characteristics of cements. Hydraulic limes, [...] "natural" [...] cements, and [...] "artificial" [...] cements all rely upon their <b>belite</b> content for strength development. <b>Belite</b> develops strength slowly. Because they were burned at temperatures below , they contained no alite, {{which is responsible}} for early strength in modern cements. The first cement to consistently contain alite was made by William Aspdin in the early 1840s: This was what we call today [...] "modern" [...] Portland cement. Because of the air of mystery with which William Aspdin surrounded his product, others (e.g., Vicat and Johnson) have claimed precedence in this invention, but recent analysis of both his concrete and raw cement have shown that William Aspdin's product made at Northfleet, Kent was a true alite-based cement. However, Aspdin's methods were [...] "rule-of-thumb": Vicat is responsible for establishing the chemical basis of these cements, and Johnson established the importance of sintering the mix in the kiln.|$|E
2500|$|... "Natural" [...] cements {{correspond}} to certain cements of the pre-Portland era, produced by burning argillaceous limestones at moderate temperatures. The level of clay {{components in the}} limestone (around 30–35%) is such that large amounts of <b>belite</b> (the low-early strength, high-late strength mineral in Portland cement) are formed without the formation of excessive amounts of free lime. As with any natural material, such cements have highly variable properties.|$|E
2500|$|Clinkers make up {{more than}} 90% of the cement, along with a limited amount of calcium sulfate (which {{controls}} the set time), and up to 5% minor constituents (fillers) as allowed by various standards. Clinkers are nodules (diameters, [...] ) of a sintered material that is produced when a raw mixture of predetermined composition is heated to high temperature. The key chemical reaction which defines Portland cement from other hydraulic limes occurs at these high temperatures (>) and is when the <b>belite</b> (Ca2SiO4) combines with calcium oxide (CaO) to form alite (Ca3SiO5).|$|E
2500|$|Portland {{cement clinker}} {{is made by}} heating, in a cement kiln, a mixture of raw {{materials}} to a calcining temperature of above [...] and then a fusion temperature, which is about [...] for modern cements, to sinter the materials into clinker. The materials in cement clinker are alite, <b>belite,</b> tri-calcium aluminate, and tetra-calcium alumino ferrite. The aluminium, iron, and magnesium oxides are present as a flux allowing the calcium silicates to form at a lower temperature, and contribute little to the strength. For special cements, such as Low Heat (LH) and Sulfate Resistant (SR) types, {{it is necessary to}} limit the amount of tricalcium aluminate (3CaO·Al2O3) formed. The major raw material for the clinker-making is usually limestone (CaCO3) mixed with a second material containing clay as source of alumino-silicate. Normally, an impure limestone which contains clay or SiO2 is used. The CaCO3 content of these limestones can be as low as 80%. Secondary raw materials (materials in the raw mix other than limestone) depend on the purity of the limestone. Some of the materials used are clay, shale, sand, iron ore, bauxite, fly ash, and slag. When a cement kiln is fired by coal, the ash of the coal acts as a secondary raw material.|$|E

50|$|One {{reason why}} the carbon {{emissions}} are so high is because cement has to be heated to very high temperatures in order for clinker to form. A major culprit of this is alite (Ca3SiO5), a mineral in concrete that cures within hours of pouring and is therefore responsible for much of its initial strength. However, alite also has to be heated to 1,500 °C in the clinker-forming process. Some research suggests that alite can {{be replaced by a}} different mineral, such as <b>belite</b> (Ca2SiO4). <b>Belite</b> is also a mineral already used in concrete. It has a roasting temperature of 1,200 °C, which is significantly lower than that of alite. Furthermore, <b>belite</b> is actually stronger once concrete cures. However, <b>belite</b> takes on the order of days or months to set completely, which leaves concrete weak for an unacceptably long time. Current research is focusing on finding possible impurity additives, like magnesium, that might speed up the curing process. It is also worthwhile to consider that <b>belite</b> takes more energy to grind, which may make its full life impact similar to or even higher than alite.|$|E

5000|$|The rapid {{reaction}} of <b>belite</b> hydration {{in the setting}} of cement is formally [...] "chemically analogue" [...] to the slow natural hydration of forsterite (the magnesium end-member of olivine) leading to the formation of serpentine and brucite in nature.
