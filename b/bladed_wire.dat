2500|$|Later when <b>bladed</b> <b>wires</b> were {{developed}} the pile loops were severed on {{withdrawal of the}} <b>blade</b> <b>wires</b> to produce a carpet known as Wilton. after this development the loom {{became known as the}} Wilton loom, and in modern usage the designation wilton applies to both cut-pile and loop-pile carpets made in this loom.

50|$|A saw {{is a tool}} {{consisting}} of a tough <b>blade,</b> <b>wire,</b> or chain with a hard toothed edge. It is used to cut through material, very often wood. The cut is made by placing the toothed edge against the material and moving it forcefully forth and less forcefully back or continuously forward. This force may be applied by hand, or powered by steam, water, electricity or other power source. An abrasive saw has a powered circular blade designed to cut through metal.|$|R

An electric sabre has a socket, which is generally a 2-prong or bayonet foil socket with the two contacts shorted together. The electric sabre also has insulation on the pommel and on the inside of the guard to prevent an electrical connection between the sabre and the lamé. This is undesirable because it effectively extends the lamé onto the sabre, causing any blade contact to be registered as a valid touch.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} the type {{synthesis}} {{of freedom and}} constraint elements for design of general flexure mechanisms. As {{an important step in}} the conceptual design stage, the goal of type synthesis is to qualitatively determine the topology or connectivity of flexure elements and rigid bodies in a mechanism. The synthesis procedure presented here is based on a recently emerging screw theory based approach for flexure mechanisms. We first categorize a list of commonly used atomic flexure primitives including <b>blades,</b> <b>wires,</b> notches and bellow springs etc. We then derive their twist and wrench matrices that mathematically represent their freedom and constraint spaces. The synthesis procedure rigorously follows screw algebra. Freedom elements including R-joints and P-joints are defined as basic motion elements that allow a single rotation or a single translation. By using parallel structures of these flexure primitives, eleven designs of R-joints and eight designs of P-joints are systematically synthesized. As a duality, constraint elements including P-constraints and R-constraints remove a single translation or rotation. In contract to freedom elements, we synthesized serial chains of flexure primitives and obtained six designs of P-constraints and three designs of R-constraints. These freedom and constraint elements form a catalogue of basic building blocks for designing more complex flexure mechanisms. At last we utilize four design examples to demonstrate how to synthesize hybrid structures with serial and parallel combination of these elements...|$|R

40|$|Background: Recent {{advances}} in enamel and dentine adhesive technology {{have resulted in}} the emergence of many new adhesive systems. Self-etching bonding systems do not require a separate etching step and the newest systems are the "all-in-one" systems which combine etching, priming and bonding into a single application. This study reports laboratory enamel microshear bond strengths of a self-etching priming and three all-in-one systems and also evaluates two different microshear bond test methods. Methods: One hundred and nineteen enamel specimens were bonded (0. 8 mm diameter) with either Clearfil Protect Bond (Kuraray), Xeno III (Dentsply), G Bond (GC) or One-Up Bond F (Tokuyama) using Palfique Estelite resin composite and stored in 37 °C water for seven days. The microshear bond test method used either a <b>blade</b> or <b>wire</b> to apply the shear stress. Results were analysed with one-way ANOVA and post hoc (Tukey) multiple comparison analysis. Results: Clearfil Protect Bond demonstrated higher and more consistent bond strengths than Xeno III, G Bond or One-Up Bond F. The wire method showed much greater reliability in results, with a coefficient of variation half that of the blade method. Conclusions: All-in-one adhesives seem to be less reliable than the two-step self-etching priming adhesive when bonding to enamel. Test method can significantly affect results in the microshear bond test method. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

50|$|Several {{different}} emitter configurations {{have been}} used for FD emitters, such as single tips, sharp <b>blades</b> and thin <b>wires.</b> Single metal tips can be made from etching wires either by periodically dipping them into molten salts or by electrolysis in aqueous solutions. Compared to other emitter types, the single tips have the advantage that they can reach the highest field strengths. In addition, well-defined geometric shape of a single tip allows accurate calculation of the potential distribution in the space between the tip and the counter electrode. For blades used as emitters, their ruggedness under the high electric field is one of their advantages. Different thin wires were also used as emitters, such as platinum wires and tungsten wires. Platinum wires are fragile, and tungsten wires are much more stable than platinum wires. Among those emitters, carbon-microneedles tungsten wires are the most widely used emitters in FD mass spectrometry.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A “ribbon ” is {{a surface}} traced out by {{sweeping}} a constant width line segment along a spatial curve. We consider {{the problem of}} planning multiple disjoint and collision-free ribbons of finite thickness along curvature and torsion constrained curves in 3 D space. This problem is motivated {{by the need to}} route multiple smooth channels through a 3 D printed structure for a healthcare applica-tion and is relevant to other applications such as defining cooling channels inside turbine <b>blades,</b> routing <b>wires</b> and cables, and planning trajectories for formations of aerial vehicles. We show that this problem is equivalent to planning motions for a rigid body, the cross-section of the ribbon, along a spatial curve such that the rigid body is oriented along the unit binormal to the curve defined according to the Frenet-Serret frame. We present a two stage approach. In the first stage, we use sampling-based rapidly exploring random trees (RRTs) to generate fea-sible curvature and torsion constrained ribbons. In the second stage, we locally optimize the curvature and torsion along each ribbon using sequential quadratic programming (SQP). We evaluate this approach for a clinically motivated ap-plication: planning multiple channels inside 3 D printed implants to temporarily insert high-dose radioactive sources to reach and cover tumors for intracavitary brachytherapy treatment. Constraints on the curvature and torsion avoid disconti-nuities (kinks) in the ribbons which would prevent insertion. In our experiments, our approach achieves an improvement of 46 % in coverage of tumor volumes as compared to an earlier approach that generates each channel in isolation. ...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{extend the}} {{principles}} of the freedom and constraint topologies (FACT) synthesis approach such that designers can analyze and synthesize serial flexure elements—not to be confused with serial flexure systems. Unlike serial systems, serial ele-ments do not possess intermediate rigid bodies within their geometry and thus avoid the negative effects of unnecessary mass and underconstrained bodies that generate uncon-trolled vibrations. Furthermore, in comparison with other common parallel flexure ele-ments such as <b>wire,</b> <b>blade,</b> and living hinge flexures, serial elements can be used within flexure systems to achieve (i) a larger variety of kinematics, (ii) more dynamic and elasto-mechanic versatility, and (iii) greater ranges of motion. Here, we utilize {{the principles of}} FACT to intuitively guide designers in visualizing a multiplicity of serial flexure element geometries that can achieve any desired set of degrees of freedom (DOFs). Using this approach, designers can rapidly generate a host of new serial flexure elements for syn-thesizing advanced flexure systems. Thirty seven serial flexure elements are provided as examples, and three flexure systems that consist of some of these elements are synthesized as case studies. [DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 4028727...|$|R

The problems confronting a turbine designer arc blade and shaft vibrations, bending and centrifugal stresses, torsional analyses {{as well as}} optimal designing {{with respect to the}} requirement of attaining high efficiencies. With the help of advanced technologies, the steam turbine industry has reached a level where both reliability and high efficiencies are achieved. Better scaling properties achieved through the use of shrouded bladings with sealing strips on stator and rotor rows, as well as perfect damping of the blades by means of individual shrouding members fitted to the shorter <b>blades</b> and damping <b>wires</b> mounted on the longer blades are among some of the outstanding improvements made to achieve these goals. These changes have been incorporated in more than 120 turbines which are in operation and not a single blade failure has yet been reported.

A quick replacement with spare parts is also a remarkable advantage...|$|R
