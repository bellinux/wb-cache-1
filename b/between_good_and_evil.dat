5|$|Artemis Fowl has {{a number}} of {{underlying}} themes, but the most essential of these are greed and the conflict <b>between</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>evil.</b>|$|E
5|$|Baldur's Gate II {{is set in}} {{the year}} 1369 DR (Dale Reckoning), and thus takes place not long after the Time of Troubles (1358 DR), when the Tablets of Fate, {{powerful}} magic items which maintain a balance <b>between</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>evil,</b> were stolen. Lord Ao, the Overdeity, forced the gods to become mortal until the Tablets were found; some gods died while in this mortal state.|$|E
5|$|Set in Shandong, {{the story}} {{revolves}} around a Chinese scholar, Wang, who becomes infatuated by a demon in disguise as {{a beautiful young}} maiden. They develop a romantic relationship which goes awry after Wang discovers her true identity. Thereafter, a Taoist priest's skills are put {{to the task of}} exorcising the demon; a fight <b>between</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>evil</b> ensues.|$|E
50|$|It {{is after}} this {{that the story}} takes a new turn; Abubacker escapes from death and a battle ensues <b>between</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> the <b>evil</b> forces.|$|R
5000|$|The Wesleyan Anthology of Science Fiction {{described}} Fourth Mansions as [...] "a cartoonishly oneiric conflict <b>between</b> cosmic <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>evil</b> {{that draws}} on the mystic visions of Saint Theresa of Avila".|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, {{the ghost}} (Mammootty, {{in his other}} role) appears, becomes {{friendly}} {{with the kids and}} takes a more stylish shape of Jimmy. Thanks to the ghost, Ancy realizes that Jimmy was innocent in the whole issue. Now the battle <b>between</b> the <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>evil.</b>|$|R
5|$|The War of Souls trilogy {{begins as}} a strange storm courses through Krynn, heralding the War of Souls. The {{end of the war}} brings the return of the gods, Takhisis's death, and the {{departure}} of Paladine as head of the good gods {{in order to maintain the}} balance <b>between</b> <b>Good</b> <b>and</b> <b>Evil.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{common theme}} in the fantasy genre is the battle <b>between</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>evil,</b> which Martin rejects for not {{mirroring}} the real world. Attracted to gray characters, Martin instead endorses William Faulkner's view that only the human heart in conflict with itself was worth writing about. Martin explores the questions of redemption and character change in the Ice and Fire series. The multiple viewpoint structure allows characters to be explored from many sides, such that the supposed villains can provide their viewpoint.|$|E
5|$|The Smallville {{incarnation}} of the character is first introduced as a morally ambiguous character, who walks a fine line <b>between</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>evil.</b> Lex is an inquisitive person, {{and it is that}} curiosity that drives him to attain as much power as possible as the series progresses—it will ultimately lead him to being Clark's greatest enemy. Michael Rosenbaum has been nominated for and won a Saturn Award and a Teen Choice Award for his portrayal of Lex Luthor on Smallville. After seven seasons as a series regular, Michael Rosenbaum left the show, but reprised the role for the two-hour series finale.|$|E
50|$|Aside {{from the}} alignment, {{there is little}} {{difference}} <b>between</b> <b>good</b> liches <b>and</b> <b>evil</b> liches. They have much the same abilities and characteristics, although a few have additional abilities. Good liches, for example do not exude the aura of fear <b>evil</b> liches do <b>and</b> clerics (i.e. priests) interact with them differently.|$|R
50|$|Chaos and Order {{have been}} {{fighting}} a never-ending battle for aeons, characterized by an endless cycle of reversals for domination {{back and forth between}} the two sides. Originally, the struggle was depicted <b>between</b> <b>Good</b> (Order) <b>and</b> <b>Evil</b> (Chaos). However, later interpretations cast it as a struggle between stagnation (Order) and anarchy (Chaos).|$|R
5000|$|Sinister {{forces have}} their eye on Christina, believing {{it is the}} girl's destiny, as the [...] "child of darkness", to [...] "bring world to its knees". Christina is the Antichrist, the child of Satan. The {{resulting}} tension <b>between</b> the <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>evil</b> aspects of the girl's nature provides the basis {{for much of the}} show's conflict and suspense.|$|R
5|$|According to {{the epic}} poem Mahabharata, Krishna becomes Arjuna's charioteer for the Kurukshetra War, {{but on the}} {{condition}} that he personally will not raise any weapon. Upon arrival at the battlefield, and seeing that the enemies are his family, his grandfather, and his cousins and loved ones, Arjuna is moved and says his heart will not allow him to fight and kill others. He would rather renounce the kingdom and put down his Gandiv (Arjuna's bow). Krishna then advises him about the nature of life, ethics, and morality when one is faced with a war <b>between</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>evil,</b> the impermanence of matter, the permanence of the soul and the good, duties and responsibilities, the nature of true peace and bliss and the different types of yoga to reach this state of bliss and inner liberation. This conversation between Krishna and Arjuna is presented as a discourse called the Bhagavad Gita.|$|E
5|$|The {{challenges}} and quests {{were developed to}} keep players occupied while playing through the story. Molyeux told Leach about the ways {{of good and evil}} and the system's reflection of the player's behaviour, and provided him with a digital copy of the Bible with instructions to study the concepts due to their connection with gods and men. Leach decided to supplement the idea of evil with mischief, as he thought being completely evil by annoying or killing followers was senseless. Molyneux wanted a conflict <b>between</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>evil,</b> and for the enemy gods to have the opposite alignment to the player. As a method of introducing the player to miracles and combat, a god whose alignment {{is the same as the}} player's was added.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the studio's history, many {{projects}}—including Futureblight, Dwarves, Aliens: Crucible, and Stormlands—were cancelled. Due {{to having}} so many projects cancelled, the company entered a severe financial crisis in 2012. As a result, Obsidian decided to crowdfund their next game, Pillars of Eternity, a role-playing game played from an isometric perspective, which ultimately became a success and saved the studio from closure. The team's focus then changed from developing licensed titles to creating original games {{based on the}} studio's own intellectual property. Obsidian has developed {{a close relationship with}} another studio that was founded by ex-Interplay Entertainment employees, inXile Entertainment. The company's latest games are Tyranny, a role-playing game set in a world where the war <b>between</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>evil</b> has been fought with evil coming out on top, and Armored Warfare, a massively multiplayer online game with a focus on controlling tanks.|$|E
2500|$|The {{title of}} the album, (somewhat of a {{surprise}} for many coming from a Muslim) refers to the various Food and Liquor stores in Chicago neighborhoods. It also refers to the [...] "constant tug of war <b>between</b> <b>good</b> (food) <b>and</b> <b>evil</b> (liquor)". The title is a philosophy that Fiasco believes about human nature. He went on to elaborate: ...|$|R
50|$|The {{story is}} an epic quest without its basic elements: the group, the aim, the battles, a clear {{separation}} <b>between</b> the <b>good</b> <b>and</b> the <b>evil,</b> a strong protagonist who decides what to do.|$|R
40|$|How {{very strange}} {{it seems that}} the {{majority}} of minds still believe in distinctions _ yes, distinctions while experiencing life, and, even more absurd and unethical, distinction after life. Can it be that after being submitted to the distinctions between race, color, creed, religion, and position while on earth that we, must go on through eternity, that endless span of existence, still making a distinction <b>between</b> supposedly <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>evil...</b>|$|R
5|$|Use of {{insanity}} {{as a concept}} dates from 1324, and its criminal application was used until the late 16th century in an almost identical way. The defence, if successful, either allowed the defendant to return home or led to him being incarcerated until he was granted a royal pardon; after 1542, a defendant who became insane prior to the trial could not be tried for any crime, {{up to and including}} high treason. During the 18th century the test to determine insanity became extremely narrow, with defendants required to prove that they could not distinguish <b>between</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>evil</b> and that they suffered from a mental disease which made them incapable of understanding the consequences of their actions. The current wording comes from the M'Naghten Rules, based on the trial of Daniel M'Naghten in 1843.|$|E
5|$|While {{the last}} three Fire Emblem titles had used a similar setting, with Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light and Mystery of the Emblem both being set on the {{continent}} of Archanea, Kaga wanted to create something new for his next title. This was for two reasons: he wanted {{to move beyond the}} confines of Archanea, and also wanted to try his hand at a large-scale historical drama. Similar to other Fire Emblem titles, the setting drew inspiration from Medieval Europe. The story's inspiration changed, drawing from Norse and Celtic mythology as opposed to the elements from Classical mythology used by earlier titles. Similar to Mystery of the Emblem, the story was split into two halves, with the first half acting as an introduction for Seliph's quest. The story's main theme was how the stupidity of humans could forge history. The focus shifted away from the characters to the overall world of Jugdral, intended to show the scale of the conflict and make it seem like history in the making. While the backstory of Jugdral featured a clearly defined battle <b>between</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>evil,</b> the main story's distinction <b>between</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>evil</b> was blurred, exemplified by the descendants of the Twelve Crusaders being on opposing sides rather than united. A stated example was Alvis, whose conquests were driven by a wish to end discrimination against Loptyr descendants. Due to this, Kaga did not create a storyline focused on poetic justice and morality, instead aiming for a more realistic scenario. This realism also prompted the inclusion of elements such as patricide and incest, which had occurred in history but were not typically included in gaming narratives at the time. The story originally had three acts rather than two. The missing act would have covered the period {{between the first and second}} act, which put a more overt focus on the themes of patricide and incest. Due to time constraints, this third act needed to be cut. In a later interview, Kaga felt that the focus on narrative weakened the gameplay.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Black finds a {{group of}} obelisks in the woods. He is about to examine one when Beebe appears, chased by dogs. The Old Man also arrives, and Black asks him to call off his dogs. The Old Man denies the dogs are his, but they retreat regardless. Black then sees that the obelisks all bear an ouroboros, {{the symbol of the}} Millennium Group. He visits the Old Man's home, where the two speak about the Group and its symbolism, and the coming millennium. The Old Man then brings Black to a {{clearing}} full of the wild dogs, where the latter realizes they are embodiments of the evil in the world. He approaches them as stands his ground, being struck by several visions as he does so. The Old Man then explains that the world's balance <b>between</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>evil</b> is being lost as the millennium approaches, and that Beebe's home, built on sacred ground, {{is one of the many}} small things upsetting this balance.|$|E
50|$|Because {{of knowing}} Mou Naam of the Fung tribe, the Wargod Ming Dou {{knows how to}} read the book, so the Wargod Saam-ngaan of the Three-Eyes tribe {{has been trying to}} kill Mou Naam. This is the start of the battle <b>between</b> the <b>Good</b> <b>and</b> <b>Evil</b> Wargods. This is a truth that even a deity can not change - no one can change, because the nature of life is this: that <b>Good</b> <b>and</b> <b>Evil</b> always coexist, <b>and</b> when a {{conflict}} is resolved, other conflicts appear.|$|R
50|$|The film {{features}} the musical score by Arjun Janya, cinematography by Sugnaan and lyrics by Yogaraj Bhat and Vijay. The film story {{revolves around the}} concept of Black magic and Human sacrifice with the battle <b>between</b> the <b>good</b> <b>and</b> the <b>evil.</b>|$|R

But all his plans are altered when Mohini’s spirit comes back to earth. Eventually it is a clash between the two - the fight <b>between</b> the <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>evil.</b>|$|R

25|$|Galán {{was largely}} {{influenced}} by Pierre Teilhard de Chardin's ideas and Nikos Kazantzakis's books. His father Mario {{described him as}} a person fascinated with spirituality, a man with integrity, an individual struggle for knowing one's self <b>between</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>evil</b> and that the effort to achieve it consisted in the main objective in life, not only individually, but collectively.|$|E

These beliefs were elaborated on both early and late in life, and Tolkien sought to bring them consistently in line with his views on evil in the real world; in contrast to widespread critical reception of Tolkien's works as somehow depicting, or even fondly imagining, a binary clash <b>between</b> absolute <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>evil.</b>|$|R
