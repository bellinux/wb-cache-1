40|$|Recent {{changes in}} {{manufacturing}} {{have resulted in}} nickel-hydrogen batteries that fail prematurely by electrical shorting, This failure {{is believed to be}} a result of a blistering problem in the nickel electrodes. In this study the bending properties of nickel electrodes are investigated in an attempt to correlate the bending properties of the electrode with its propensity to blister. Nickel electrodes from three different <b>batches</b> of <b>material</b> were <b>tested</b> in both the as-received and impregnated forms. The effects of specimen curvature and position within the electrode on the bending strength were studied, and within-electrode and batch-to-batch variations were addressed. Two color-imaging techniques were employed to differentiate between the phases within the electrodes. These techniques aided in distinguishing the relative amounts of nickel hyroxide surface loading on each electrode, thereby relating surface loading to bend strength. Bend strength was found to increase with the amount of surface loading...|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} leg of the project the major thrust has been on the {{assembly}} process using the conductive adhesive, viz., the optimization of the process conditions and the bonding equipment. The past at this point is deemed optimum in terms of the three basic properties: adhesion, screenability and conductivity. The reliability and wafer level screening is proven reproducibly over several experiment constituting assembly of more than one part. Using the optimum paste the authors have provided an uninterrupted supply of reproducible (optimum) paste. By tweaking the compounding conditions a first-level scale-up was successfully achieved. The initial 30 g batch to Endicott is increased to as high as 300 g batches with similar properties. The large <b>batch</b> <b>material</b> is shown to behave similar to the small <b>batch</b> <b>materials.</b> Also, it has been essential to do large wafer level studies: Endicott has scaled up their screening from 5 inch wafer to 8 inch wafer...|$|R

A contactless pure bending mode is realized through the relative rotations of two clamps that are mounted on frictionless sliders. The proposed generic device allows for large rotations, cyclic loading, reversed loading, creep testing, relaxation testing and is well-suited to test different classes of materials. On top of the classical benefits for <b>materials</b> <b>testing</b> through bending, a few illustrative examples are given that emphasize the potential of this bending instrument for particular <b>material</b> <b>tests...</b>|$|R
