30|$|The {{application}} of the problem that is considered for applying and testing the framework is of environmental origin. The importance of such problems and their nature will be briefly pointed out. In environmental domain, decision-making is frequently related to waste management among others. Especially, the problem that is considered {{in this study is}} the <b>landfill</b> <b>waste</b> location selection problem. The fact that selection of the site for <b>landfill</b> of <b>wastes</b> is a fundamental activity for each region. Having an impact on the environment requires analyses to choose the most optimal location for <b>landfill</b> <b>waste.</b> Hence, the region that is considered in this case study is Casablanca, which is the most populated and important industrial region in Morocco where there exists four candidate locations for <b>landfill</b> <b>wastes.</b>|$|R

40|$|Modern Canadian {{hospitals}} are large generators of <b>landfilled</b> <b>waste.</b> However, {{much of the}} waste disposed of by hospitals is divertible.

Environmental issues are gaining awareness among businesses in other sectors, but are not commonly addressed in hospitals, where patient care takes priority over the environment. While specific, recommended waste reduction initiatives tailored to hospital operations have been widely published, information on how to implement these initiatives is lacking. The results from this research yielded a significant decrease in <b>landfilled</b> <b>waste,</b> a notable increase in recycled items, and a significant decrease in waste hauling costs, indicating that the HEMF was a success. The proposed HEMF can be implemented by other hospitals to improve their waste management...|$|R

Some opponents of recycling argued that state support for recycling may be more financially expensive in the short term than alternatives such as landfill; recycling efforts in New York City cost $57 million per year in 2002. To refute this argument people pointed out that the benefits to society from recycling compensate for any difference in cost. <b>Landfilling</b> <b>waste</b> is an inefficient use of resources, contributes to global warming through the release of methane into the atmosphere when unharvested or incompletely harvested, and by the pollution of groundwater and waterways. The long term financial costs of remediating pollution caused by <b>landfilling</b> <b>waste</b> are often not taken into consideration.|$|R

Supervisory of the landfill was originally not allow scavengers to collect <b>waste</b> in the <b>landfill</b> {{because they can be}} exposed to sharp objects and disease. Over time, the scavengers eventually left to work at the landfill. Number of scavengers in TPA Terjun today is 500 people. The role of scavengers at the landfill is still unknown whether it can help reduce <b>landfill</b> <b>waste</b> in the <b>landfill.</b> This research is a descriptive research with quantitative analysis. The goal is {{to find out what the}} role of a scavenger in the management of <b>waste</b> in the <b>landfill.</b> The sample size observed was 30 people. The research result shows that the volume of waste that goes into TPA Terjun every day was 3. 868, 57 m 3 while the amount of waste that can be managed by scavengers every day is 89, 02 m 3. Thus, the volume of <b>landfill</b> <b>waste</b> left in TPA Terjun every day was 3. 779, 55 m 3.
