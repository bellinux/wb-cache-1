5|$|ATC {{maintained}} normal {{two-way radio}} {{contact with the}} Embraer up until 15:51, when the last successful radio exchange with the Embraer was made on VHF frequency 125.05MHz with <b>Brasilia</b> Center. At that point the Embraer was just approaching the <b>Brasilia</b> VOR. The Embraer overflew the <b>Brasilia</b> VOR at 15:55, four minutes later, and proceeded northwest-bound along UZ6. At 16:02, seven minutes after crossing the <b>Brasilia</b> VOR, secondary radar contact was lost with the Embraer, thus stopping the display of the Embraer's reported altitude (Mode C) on the controller's radar screen.|$|E
5|$|No {{attempt was}} made by either the Embraer or <b>Brasilia</b> Center to contact each other from 15:51 until 16:26 when, 24 minutes after the loss of {{secondary}} radar contact, <b>Brasilia</b> Center called the Embraer and received no reply.|$|E
5|$|<b>Brasilia</b> Center then unsuccessfully {{attempted}} {{to contact the}} Embraer six more times, between 16:30 and 16:34. At 16:30 the Embraer's primary radar target became intermittent, and disappeared completely from the radar screen by 16:38, eight minutes later. <b>Brasilia</b> Center unsuccessfully {{attempted to}} effect a handoff of the Embraer to Amazonic Center at 16:53, by calling the Embraer in the blind.|$|E
50|$|The {{effect of}} the codeshare {{termination}} with WestAir and Mesa was immediate. The termination put 87 (21 Jetstreams, 29 <b>Brasilias,</b> and 37 Beech 1900s) of Mesa's 184 aircraft out of service or 47% of its total aircraft. Mesa took immediate steps, parking the Jetstreams and <b>Brasilias.</b> It sold 10 <b>Brasilias</b> to Skywest. Mesa exercised the option to purchase 16 additional CRJs and traded in the remaining <b>Brasilias</b> to Bombardier for CRJs. Mesa sold 24 Beech 1900s to Great Lakes, and returned the remaining Beech 1900s to Beechcraft/Raytheon. WestAir ceased operations in 1998.|$|R

5|$|The Embraer, on {{the other}} hand, started calling <b>Brasilia</b> Center, also unsuccessfully, from 16:48 and {{continued}} with twelve more unsuccessful attempts until 16:53. Some limited contact was made at that point, but the Embraer was unable to copy the Amazonic Center frequencies. The Embraer then continued its attempts to reach <b>Brasilia</b> Center, seven more times until the collision.|$|E

5|$|Rio de Janeiro {{planned to}} {{organize}} the Games {{at a cost of}} USD 14.4billion, being able to hold all sport events (excepting football) inside the city. There will be 30 competition venues in four Olympic zones—Barra, Copacabana, Deodoro, and Maracanã—apart from venues for golf and rugby union, which were added to the Olympic program after the election.

5|$|Norsk Air was {{the second}} airline in Europe to order the <b>Brasilia,</b> after Air Excel. Three were financed with loans from Banco de Brasil and the last was leased. With the {{introduction}} of the Brasilias in 1986, the airline started a route from Sandefjord to Trondheim Airport, Værnes. From 1985 to 1986, the airline's costs doubled, but not their income. In 1987, Terje Røsjode, former bank chief for Christiania Bank in Sandefjord, took over as managing director. The Brasilias had state-of-art technology, and although airlines purchase new aircraft to reduce their maintenance costs, this was not the reality for Norsk Air because they did not have sufficient competence to maintain the aircraft. In particular, they lacked sufficient electronic expertise, due to the increase of electronic components in the aircraft. All the other aircraft were sold.|$|E
5|$|On 6 June 2014, Pogba {{was named}} in France's squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. On 15 June, {{he started in}} central midfield in the team's first World Cup fixture – a 3–0 victory over Honduras – {{suffering}} a foul from Wilson Palacios {{which led to a}} red card for the Honduran and a penalty kick, which was converted by Karim Benzema to give France the lead. He appeared as a substitute in the team's second match, assisting a goal for Benzema in a 5–2 victory of Switzerland. In the round of 16, Pogba scored a 79th minute opening goal and was named man of the match by FIFA as Les Bleus defeated Nigeria 2–0 in <b>Brasília.</b> On 13 July 2014, Pogba was named the tournament's Best Young Player.|$|E
5|$|The site of Canberra was {{selected}} for {{the location of the}} nation's capital in 1908 as a compromise between rivals Sydney and Melbourne, Australia's two largest cities. It is unusual among Australian cities, being an entirely planned city outside of any state, similar to Washington, D.C. in the United States, or <b>Brasília</b> in Brazil. Following an international contest for the city's design, a blueprint by American architects Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony Griffin {{was selected}} and construction commenced in 1913. The Griffins' plan featured geometric motifs such as circles, hexagons and triangles, and was centred on axes aligned with significant topographical landmarks in the Australian Capital Territory.|$|E

5|$|Rio de Janeiro {{proposed}} to hold all sporting events {{within the city}} limits—apart from the football (soccer) tournaments which would {{be held in the}} cities of Belo Horizonte, <b>Brasília,</b> Salvador and São Paulo—making the Games more compact and technically feasible. The competition venues will be located in four Olympic zones—Barra, Copacabana, Deodoro, and Maracanã—and divided in seven Olympic clusters—Barra, Copacabana, Deodoro, Flamengo, João Havelange, Lagoa and Maracanã—with four Olympic precincts—Maracanã, Olympic Park, Riocentro and X Park. The Olympic and Paralympic Village, the International Broadcast Centre (IBC) and the Main Press Centre (MPC) will be located at the Barra zone, which is the core of the project and includes the largest number of competition venues. A television tower will be built at the IBC/MPC complex to complement broadcasting operations and provide panoramic studios. There will be a media-exclusive hotel within the complex, accessible directly from the IBC/MPC. The Olympic and Paralympic Village complex will include an Olympic Village Training Center, an Olympic Village Park, an Olympic Beach and direct access to the Olympic Park, in addition to the 8,856 rooms to accommodate over 17,770 athletes and team officials, including accredited additional officials.|$|E
