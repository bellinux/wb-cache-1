5|$|The <b>black-footed</b> <b>ferret</b> (Mustela nigripes) became extirpated in Canada in 1937. Between the 1950s and 1981, it was {{suspected}} {{to be entirely}} extinct until a wild population was discovered in 1981 in Wyoming. The swift fox and sea otter both were extirpated in Canada in the 1930s, but were successfully reintroduced {{in the beginning of}} the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Since {{opening in}} 1962, the zoo {{has focused on}} animal {{conservation}} efforts. Programs at the Phoenix Zoo include captive breeding for reintroduction (for instance the Arabian oryx, <b>black-footed</b> <b>ferret,</b> Mexican wolf, Ramsey Canyon leopard frog, and thick-billed parrot, sanctuary for animals that are no longer breeding (for instance the African painted dogs at the zoo), and rescue and rehabilitation (for instance lead poisoning treatments for the California condor).|$|E
25|$|Based on 86 <b>black-footed</b> <b>ferret</b> scats {{found near}} Meeteetse, Wyoming, 87% of <b>black-footed</b> <b>ferret</b> diet was {{composed}} of white-tailed prairie dogs. Other food items included deer mice, sagebrush voles, meadow voles, mountain cottontails, and white-tailed jackrabbits. Water is obtained through consumption of prey.|$|E
50|$|Meeteetse {{was where}} the last known wild {{population}} of <b>black-footed</b> <b>ferrets</b> was discovered in 1981. All <b>black-footed</b> <b>ferrets</b> today are descended from these animals.|$|R
25|$|Given an obligate-dependence of <b>black-footed</b> <b>ferrets</b> on prairie dogs, <b>black-footed</b> <b>ferrets</b> are {{extremely}} vulnerable to prairie dog habitat loss. Habitat loss results from agriculture, livestock use, and other development.|$|R
25|$|<b>Black-footed</b> <b>ferrets</b> are {{susceptible}} to numerous diseases. They are fatally susceptible to canine distemper virus, introduced by striped skunks, common raccoons, red foxes, coyotes, and American badgers. A short-term vaccine for canine distemper is available for captive <b>black-footed</b> <b>ferrets,</b> but no protection is available for young born in the wild. <b>Black-footed</b> <b>ferrets</b> are also susceptible to rabies, tularemia, and human influenza. They can directly contract sylvatic plague (Yersinia pestis), and epidemics in prairie dog towns may completely destroy the ferrets' prey base.|$|R
25|$|The <b>black-footed</b> <b>ferret</b> {{is roughly}} the size of a mink, and differs from the European polecat by the greater {{contrast}} between its dark limbs and pale body and the shorter length of its black tail-tip. In contrast, differences between the <b>black-footed</b> <b>ferret</b> and the steppe polecat of Asia are slight, {{to the point where the}} two species were once thought to be conspecific. The only noticeable differences between the <b>black-footed</b> <b>ferret</b> and the steppe polecat are the former's much shorter and coarser fur, larger ears, and longer postmolar extension of the palate.|$|E

25|$|The <b>black-footed</b> <b>ferret</b> is solitary, {{except when}} {{breeding}} or raising litters. It is nocturnal and primarily hunts for sleeping prairie dogs in their burrows. It is most active above ground from dusk to midnight and 4 a.m. to mid-morning. Aboveground activity is greatest during {{late summer and}} early autumn when juveniles become independent. Climate generally does not limit <b>black-footed</b> <b>ferret</b> activity, but it may remain inactive inside burrows for up to 6 {{days at a time}} during winter.|$|E
25|$|Oil {{and natural}} gas {{exploration}} and extraction can have detrimental impacts on prairie dogs and <b>black-footed</b> <b>ferrets.</b> Seismic activity collapses prairie dog burrows. Other problems include potential leakages and spills, increased roads and fences, increased vehicle traffic and human presence, and an increased number of raptor perching sites on power poles. Traps set for coyotes, American mink, and other animals may harm <b>black-footed</b> <b>ferrets.</b>|$|R
25|$|Predators of <b>black-footed</b> <b>ferrets</b> include golden eagles, great horned owls, coyotes, American badgers, bobcats, prairie falcons, {{ferruginous}} hawks, and prairie rattlesnakes.|$|R

25|$|Historical {{habitats}} of the <b>black-footed</b> <b>ferret</b> included shortgrass prairie, mixed-grass prairie, desert grassland, shrub steppe, sagebrush steppe, mountain grassland, and semi-arid grassland. Black-footed ferrets use {{prairie dog}} burrows for raising young, avoiding predators, and thermal cover. Six <b>black-footed</b> <b>ferret</b> nests found near Mellette County, South Dakota, {{were lined with}} buffalo grass, prairie threeawn, sixweeks grass, and cheatgrass. High densities of prairie dog burrows provide {{the greatest amount of}} cover for black-footed ferrets. Black-tailed prairie dog colonies contain a greater burrow density per acre than white-tailed prairie dog colonies, and may be more suitable for the recovery of black-footed ferrets. The type of prairie dog burrow may be important for occupancy by black-footed ferrets. <b>Black-footed</b> <b>ferret</b> litters near Meeteetse, Wyoming, were associated with mounded white-tailed prairie dog burrows, which are less common than non-mounded burrows. Mounded burrows contain multiple entrances and probably have a deep and extensive burrow system that protects kits. However, black-footed ferrets used non-mounded prairie dog burrows (64%) more often than mounded burrows (30%) near Meeteetse, Wyoming.|$|E
25|$|Up to 90% of the black-footed ferret's diet is {{composed}} of prairie dogs. The diet of the <b>black-footed</b> <b>ferret</b> varies depending on geographic location. In western Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, and Montana, black-footed ferrets historically associated with white-tailed prairie dogs and were forced to find alternate prey when white-tailed prairie dogs entered their four-month hibernation cycle. In Wyoming, alternate prey items consumed during white-tailed prairie dog hibernation included voles (Microtus spp.) and mice (Peromyscus spp. and Mus spp.) found near streams. In South Dakota, black-footed ferrets associate with black-tailed prairie dogs. Because black-tailed prairie dogs do not hibernate, little seasonal change in <b>black-footed</b> <b>ferret</b> diet is necessary.|$|E
25|$|Like {{its close}} cousin, the Asian steppe polecat (with {{which it was}} {{once thought to be}} conspecific), the <b>black-footed</b> <b>ferret</b> {{represents}} a more progressive form than the European polecat in the direction of carnivory. The black-footed ferret's most likely ancestor was Mustela stromeri (from which the European and steppe polecat are also derived), which originated in Europe during the Middle Pleistocene. Molecular evidence indicates that the steppe polecat and <b>black-footed</b> <b>ferret</b> diverged from Mustela stromeri sometime between 500,000 and 2,000,000 years ago, perhaps in Beringia. The species appeared in the Great Basin and the Rockies by 750,000 years ago. The oldest recorded fossil find originates from Cathedral Cave, White Pine County, Nevada, and dates back to 750,000–950,000 years ago. Prairie dog fossils have been found in six sites where ferrets are yielded, thus indicating that the association between the two species is an old one. Anecdotal observations and 42% of examined fossil records indicated that any substantial colony of medium- to large-sized colonial ground squirrels, such as Richardson's ground squirrels, may provide a sufficient prey base and a source of burrows for black-footed ferrets. This suggests that the <b>black-footed</b> <b>ferret</b> and prairie dogs did not historically have an obligate predator-prey relationship. The species has likely always been rare, and the modern <b>black-footed</b> <b>ferret</b> represents a relic population. A reported occurrence of the species is from a late Illinoian deposit in Clay County, Nebraska, and is further recorded from Sangamonian deposits in Nebraska and Medicine Hat. Fossils have also been found in Alaska dating from the Pleistocene.|$|E

50|$|Predators include badgers, wolves, coyotes, bobcats, <b>black-footed</b> <b>ferrets,</b> weasels, golden eagles {{and large}} hawks. Humans also affect prairie dog populations; for example, some ranchers {{implement}} poisoning programs to eliminate them.|$|R
50|$|Some of {{the species}} kept here are, American bison, hooded cranes, red-crowned cranes, white-naped crane, maned wolves, cheetahs, a mariana crow, <b>black-footed</b> <b>ferrets,</b> persian onagers, Hartmann's {{mountain}} zebras and scimitar-horned oryxs.|$|R
25|$|For a time, the <b>black-footed</b> <b>ferret</b> was {{harvested}} for the fur trade, {{with the}} American Fur Company having received 86 ferret skins from Pratt, Chouteau, and Company of St. Louis {{in the late}} 1830s. During {{the early years of}} predator control, <b>black-footed</b> <b>ferret</b> carcasses were likely discarded, as their fur was of low value. This likely continued after the passing of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, for fear of reprisals. The large drop in <b>black-footed</b> <b>ferret</b> numbers began during the 1800s through to the 1900s, as prairie dog numbers declined because of control programs and the conversion of prairies to croplands. Sylvatic plague, a disease caused by Yersinia pestis introduced into North America, also contributed to the prairie dog die-off, though ferret numbers declined proportionately more than their prey, thus indicating other factors may have been responsible. Plague was first detected in South Dakota in a coyote in 2004, and then in ~50,000 acres of prairie dogs on Pine Ridge Reservation in 2005. Thereafter 7,000 acres of prairie dog colonies were treated with insecticide (DeltaDust) and 1,000 acres of <b>black-footed</b> <b>ferret</b> habitat were prophylactically dusted in Conata Basin in 2006–2007. Nevertheless, plague was proven in ferrets in May 2008. Since then each year 12,000 acres of their Conata Basin habitat is dusted and about 50–150 ferrets are immunized with plague vaccine. Inbreeding depression may have also contributed, as studies on black-footed ferrets from Meeteetse, Wyoming revealed low levels of genetic variation. Canine distemper devastated the Meeteetse ferret population in 1985. A live virus vaccine originally made for domestic ferrets killed large numbers of black-footed ferrets, thus indicating that the species is especially susceptible to distemper.|$|E
25|$|Associated {{with the}} irradication {{program of the}} prairie dog (gopher) in the 1930s was the {{dramatic}} decline in population of the <b>black-footed</b> <b>ferret</b> (Mustela nigripes) which relied on the prairie dog as its main source of food. The lowered population was hastened as the natural habitat of the ferret was also being taken over by agricultural machinery and practices.|$|E
25|$|In Mellette County, South Dakota, black-tailed {{prairie dog}} remains {{occurred}} in 91% of 82 <b>black-footed</b> <b>ferret</b> scats. Mouse remains occurred in 26% of scats. Mouse remains could not be identified to species; however, deer mice, northern grasshopper mice, and house mice were captured in snap-trap surveys. Potential prey items included thirteen-lined ground squirrels, plains pocket gophers, mountain cottontails, upland sandpipers, horned larks, and western meadowlarks.|$|E
50|$|Franc {{died from}} a gunshot in 1903 under still mysterious circumstances. The Pitchfork Ranch remains active, and {{is known for its}} {{wildlife}} conservations efforts. In 1981, a colony of <b>black-footed</b> <b>ferrets,</b> an animal previously thought to be extinct, was discovered on the ranch.|$|R
50|$|Animals that {{commonly}} carry plague {{bacteria are}} largely rodents and Leporidae, but carnivores sometimes also become infected by their prey. Prey animals {{are not immune}} to the disease, and outbreaks of various strains of plague, such as sylvatic plague, have on occasion devastated populations of black-tailed prairie dogs and <b>black-footed</b> <b>ferrets.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Intercolony {{dispersal}} of juvenile <b>black-footed</b> <b>ferrets</b> occurs {{several months after}} birth, from early September to early November. Dispersal distances may be short or long. Near Meeteetse, Wyoming, 9 juvenile males and 3 juvenile females dispersed [...] following litter breakup. Four juvenile females dispersed a short distance (<) but remained on their natal area.|$|R
25|$|Mammals {{are found}} in every area of Utah. Non-predatory larger mammals include the wood bison, elk, moose, {{mountain}} goat, mule deer, pronghorn, and multiple types of bighorn sheep. Non-predatory small mammals include muskrat, and nutria. Predatory mammals include the brown and black bear, cougar, Canada lynx, bobcat, fox (gray, red, and kit), coyote, badger, gray wolf, <b>black-footed</b> <b>ferret,</b> mink, stoat, long-tailed weasel, raccoon, and otter.|$|E
25|$|The <b>black-footed</b> <b>ferret</b> is {{an example}} of a species which {{benefits}} from strong reproductive science. A captive-breeding program was initiated in 1987, capturing 18 living individuals and using artificial insemination. This is one of the first examples of assisted reproduction contributing to conservation of an endangered species in nature. The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service (USFWS), state and tribal agencies, private landowners, conservation groups, and North American zoos, have actively reintroduced ferrets back into the wild since 1991. Beginning in Shirley Basin in Eastern Wyoming, reintroduction expanded to Montana, 6 sites in South Dakota in 1994, Arizona, Utah, Colorado, Saskatchewan, Canada and Chihuahua, Mexico. The Toronto Zoo has bred hundreds, most of which were released into the wild. Several episodes of Zoo Diaries show aspects of the tightly controlled breeding. In May 2000, the Canadian Species at Risk Act listed the <b>black-footed</b> <b>ferret</b> as being an extirpated species in Canada. A population of 35 animals was released into Grasslands National Park in southern Saskatchewan on October 2, 2009, and a litter of newborn kits was observed in July 2010. Reintroduction sites have experienced multiple years of reproduction from released individuals.|$|E
25|$|Ecologists {{consider}} this rodent to be a keystone species. They {{are an important}} prey species, being the primary diet in prairie species such as the <b>black-footed</b> <b>ferret,</b> swift fox, golden eagle, American badger, and ferruginous hawk. Other species, such as the mountain plover and the burrowing owl, also rely on prairie dog burrows for nesting areas. Even grazing species, such as plains bison, pronghorn, and mule deer have shown a proclivity for grazing on the same land used by prairie dogs.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} predators of black-tailed prairie dogs are coyotes (Canis latrans), American badgers (Taxidea taxus), bobcats (Lynx rufus), golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos), {{ferruginous}} hawks (Buteo regalis), red-tailed hawks (Buteo jamaicensis), and prairie rattlesnakes (Crotalus viridis). Although now very rare, <b>black-footed</b> <b>ferrets</b> (Mustela nigripes) {{were once a}} major predator of the black-tailed prairie dog.|$|R
50|$|Because <b>black-footed</b> <b>ferrets</b> prey on black-tailed prairie dogs, wild ferret populations also {{fall victim}} to sylvatic plague. An {{outbreak}} can kill nearly 100% of ferrets in a population, and surviving ferrets commonly face starvation because the prairie dogs are their main prey. Spray-and-vaccinate campaigns have aimed at preventing {{the spread of the}} plague among these animals.|$|R
50|$|Intercolony {{dispersal}} of juvenile <b>black-footed</b> <b>ferrets</b> occurs {{several months after}} birth, from early September to early November. Dispersal distances may be short or long. Near Meeteetse, Wyoming, 9 juvenile males and 3 juvenile females dispersed 1 to 4 mi following litter breakup. Four juvenile females dispersed a short distance (<0.2 mi) but remained on their natal area.|$|R
25|$|The {{reproductive}} {{physiology of}} the <b>black-footed</b> <b>ferret</b> {{is similar to}} that of the European polecat and the steppe polecat. It is probably polygynous, based on data collected from home range sizes, skewed sex ratios, and sexual dimorphism. Mating occurs in February and March. When a male and female in estrus encounter each other, the male sniffs the genital region of the female, but does not mount her until after a few hours have elapsed, which is contrast to the more violent behavior displayed by the male European polecat. During copulation, the male grasps the female by the nape of the neck, with the copulatory tie lasting from 1.5–3 hours. Unlike other mustelids, the <b>black-footed</b> <b>ferret</b> is a habitat specialist with low reproductive rates. In captivity, gestation of black-footed ferrets lasts 42–45 days. Litter size ranges from 1–5 kits. Kits are born in May and June in prairie dog burrows. Kits are altricial and are raised by their mother for several months after birth. Kits first emerge above ground in July, at 6 weeks old. They are then separated into individual prairie dog burrows around their mother's burrow. Kits reach adult weight and become independent several months following birth, from late August to October. Sexual maturity occurs at one year of age.|$|E
25|$|The <b>black-footed</b> <b>ferret</b> {{has a long}} {{slender body}} with black {{outlines}} such as the feet, ears, parts of the face and its tail. The forehead is arched and broad, and the muzzle is short. It has few whiskers, and its ears are triangular, short, erect and broad at the base. The neck is long and the legs short and stout. The toes are armed with sharp, very slightly arched claws. The feet on both surfaces are covered in hair, even to the soles, thus concealing the claws. It combines several physical features common in both members of the subgenus Gale (least, short-tailed and long-tailed weasels) and Putorius (European and steppe polecats). Its skull resembles that of polecats in its size, massiveness {{and the development of}} its ridges and depressions, though it is distinguished by the extreme degree of constriction behind the orbits where the width of the cranium is much less than that of the muzzle. Though similar in size to polecats, its attenuate body, long neck, very short legs, slim tail, large orbicular ears and close-set pelage is much closer in conformation to weasels and stoats. The dentition of the <b>black-footed</b> <b>ferret</b> closely resembles that of the European and steppe polecat, though the back lower molar is vestigial, with a hemispherical crown which is too small and weak to develop the little cusps which are more apparent in polecats.|$|E
25|$|Every year, {{thousands}} {{of cases of}} the plague are still reported to the World Health Organization, although, with proper treatment, the prognosis for victims is now much better. A five- to six-fold increase in cases occurred in Asia {{during the time of}} the Vietnam War, possibly due to the disruption of ecosystems and closer proximity between people and animals. The Plague is now commonly found in sub-Saharan Africa and Madagascar, areas which now account for over 95% of reported cases. The plague also has a detrimental effect on non-human mammals. In the United States, mammals such as the black-tailed prairie dog and the endangered <b>black-footed</b> <b>ferret</b> are under threat.|$|E
