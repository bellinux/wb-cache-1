5|$|Cerebral veins drain deoxygenated <b>blood</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> brain. The {{brain has}} two main {{networks}} of veins: an exterior or superficial network, {{on the surface}} of the cerebrum that has three branches, and an interior network. These two networks communicate via anastomosing (joining) veins. The veins of the brain drain into larger cavities the dural venous sinuses usually situated between the dura mater and the covering of the skull. <b>Blood</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> cerebellum and midbrain drains into the great cerebral vein. <b>Blood</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> medulla and pons of the brainstem have a variable pattern of drainage, either into the spinal veins or into adjacent cerebral veins.|$|E
5|$|Frogs have three-chambered hearts, {{a feature}} they share with lizards. Oxygenated <b>blood</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> lungs and de-oxygenated <b>blood</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> respiring tissues enter the heart through {{separate}} atria. When these chambers contract, the two blood streams pass into a common ventricle before being pumped via a spiral valve {{to the appropriate}} vessel, the aorta for oxygenated blood and pulmonary artery for deoxygenated blood. The ventricle is partially divided into narrow cavities which minimizes the mixing of {{the two types of}} blood. These features enable frogs to have a higher metabolic rate and be more active than would otherwise be possible.|$|E
5|$|Attention will {{be focused}} on the {{direction}} of the blood flow in both of the venous systems, and in the perforator veins, as well as being focused on shunt detection. A shunting of <b>blood</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> thigh veins back into the lower leg veins will give a reflux situation. The veins most often found to be incompetent are the saphenous veins and the perforators communicating with the deep veins of the thigh.|$|E
50|$|The visceral pleura {{receives}} its <b>blood</b> supply <b>from</b> <b>the</b> bronchial circulation, {{which also}} supplies the lungs. The parietal pleura receives its <b>blood</b> supply <b>from</b> <b>the</b> intercostal arteries, which also supply the overlying body wall.|$|R

50|$|The {{origin of}} blood can be {{identified}} by observing its color. Bright-red, foamy <b>blood</b> comes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> respiratory tract, whereas dark-red, coffee-colored <b>blood</b> comes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> gastrointestinal tract. Sometimes hemoptysis may be rust-colored.The {{most common cause of}} minor hemoptysis is bronchitis.|$|R
5|$|Bivalves {{have an open}} {{circulatory system}} that bathes the organs in hemolymph. The heart has three chambers: two {{auricles}} receiving <b>blood</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> gills, and a single ventricle. The ventricle is muscular and pumps hemolymph into the aorta, {{and then to the}} rest of the body. Some bivalves have a single aorta, but most also have a second, usually smaller, aorta serving the hind parts of the animal.|$|E
5|$|Blood {{from here}} drains {{into the left}} and right {{transverse}} sinuses. These then drain into the sigmoid sinuses, which receive <b>blood</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> cavernous sinus and superior and inferior petrosal sinuses. The sigmoid drains into the large internal jugular veins.|$|E
5|$|Cerebral venous sinus {{thrombosis}} (CVST) is {{the presence}} of acute thrombosis (a blood clot) in the dural venous sinuses, which drain <b>blood</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> brain. Symptoms may include headache, abnormal vision, any of the symptoms of stroke such as weakness of the face and limbs {{on one side of the}} body, and seizures. The diagnosis is usually by computed tomography (CT/CAT scan) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) employing radiocontrast to demonstrate obstruction of the venous sinuses by thrombus.|$|E

5|$|In birds, {{the main}} arteries taking blood {{away from the}} heart {{originate}} from the right aortic arch (or pharyngeal arch), unlike in the mammals where the left aortic arch forms {{this part of the}} aorta. The postcava receives <b>blood</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> limbs via the renal portal system. Unlike in mammals, the circulating red blood cells in birds retain their nucleus.|$|E
5|$|Many {{blood vessels}} serve the {{esophagus}}, with blood supply varying along its course. The upper {{parts of the}} esophagus and the upper esophageal sphincter receive <b>blood</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> inferior thyroid artery, {{the parts of the}} esophagus in the thorax from the bronchial arteries and branches directly from the thoracic aorta, and the lower parts of the esophagus and the lower esophageal sphincter receive <b>blood</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> left gastric artery and the left inferior phrenic artery. The venous drainage also differs along the course of the esophagus. The upper and middle parts of the esophagus drain into the azygos and hemiazygos veins, and <b>blood</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> lower part drains into the left gastric vein. All these veins drain into the superior vena cava, {{with the exception of the}} left gastric vein, which is a branch of the portal vein. Lymphatically, the upper third of the esophagus drains into the deep cervical lymph nodes, the middle into the superior and posterior mediastinal lymph nodes, and the lower esophagus into the gastric and celiac lymph nodes. This is similar to the lymphatic drainage of the abdominal structures that arise from the foregut, which all drain into the celiac nodes.|$|E

Xander enters Giles' {{apartment}} as Spike, his mouth wet with blood, {{bends down to}} pick up something that he dropped in front of the sofa where Anya sleeps. Inferring that Spike bit and drank from Anya, Xander pummels him ferociously until Anya wakes and stops him; excited that he fought to defend her, Anya gestures that they should go have sex.|$|E

5|$|The {{blood in}} the deep {{part of the brain}} drains, through a venous plexus into the {{cavernous}} sinus at the front, and the superior and inferior petrosal sinuses at the sides, and the inferior sagittal sinus at the back. Blood drains from the outer brain into the large superior saggital sinus, which rests in the midline on top of the brain. Blood from here joins with <b>blood</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> straight sinus at the confluence of sinuses.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} IIH is not known. The Monro-Kellie rule {{states that the}} {{intracranial}} pressure {{is determined by the}} amount of brain tissue, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood inside the bony cranial vault. Three theories therefore exist as to why the pressure might be raised in IIH: an excess of CSF production, increased volume of blood or brain tissue, or obstruction of the veins that drain <b>blood</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> brain.|$|E
5|$|The {{superior}} parathyroid glands {{receive their}} <b>blood</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> inferior thyroid arteries. The inferior parathyroid glands receive a variable blood supply, {{from either the}} ascending branch of the inferior thyroid arteries or the thyroid ima artery. The inferior thyroid artery arises from the subclavian arteries.|$|E

5|$|A heart {{condition}} uncommon to the breed is tetralogy of Fallot, {{which is more}} common in the Keeshond and English Bulldog breeds relatively. It is actually a combination of up to four conditions, including the previously mentioned pulmonary valve stenosis, with a secondary condition of right ventricular hypertrophy. The other conditions are ventricular septal defect which is a defect or hole in the wall of the heart between the two ventricles and the aorta which carries the <b>blood</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> left to {{the right side of the}} heart can be mis-positioned. The effect on the dog depends on the severity of the condition, and can range from a heart murmur through to reduced activity levels to death. Symptoms in puppies are generally a failure to grow and a reduced tolerance for exercise. Active treatment is effective in around 50% of cases.|$|E
5|$|As in all arthropods, the chelicerate {{body has}} a very small coelom {{restricted}} to small areas round the reproductive and excretory systems. The main body cavity is a hemocoel that runs most {{of the length of}} the body and through which blood flows, driven by a tubular heart that collects <b>blood</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> rear and pumps it forward. Although arteries direct the blood to specific parts of the body, they have open ends rather than joining directly to veins, and chelicerates therefore have open circulatory systems as is typical for arthropods.|$|E
5|$|Besides English {{translation}} and localization, the international version of Kingdom Hearts II {{differs from the}} original Japanese version {{in the content of}} gameplay and several scenes. The Hydra boss in the Hercules-themed world Olympus Coliseum had its green <b>blood</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> original Japanese version (which was taken from the film) changed into black and purple smoke in the English version. In one cutscene, Hercules fights the Hydra and uses his sword on its head, which eventually releases green blood from its mouth in the Japanese version; this was later changed into drool in the English version. There is also a scene in Disney Castle where, after chasing Donald around for missing a date, Daisy Duck pounds him on the backside in the Japanese version, whereas she merely tells him off inaudibly in the English version.|$|E

5|$|During sexual arousal, the {{clitoris}} and {{the whole}} of the genitalia engorge and change color as the erectile tissues fill with blood (vasocongestion), and the individual experiences vaginal contractions. The ischiocavernosus and bulbocavernosus muscles, which insert into the corpora cavernosa, contract and compress the dorsal vein of the clitoris (the only vein that drains the <b>blood</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> spaces in the corpora cavernosa) and the arterial blood continues a steady flow and, having no way to drain out, fills the venous spaces until they become turgid and engorged with blood. This is what leads to clitoral erection.|$|E
5|$|Fish have a {{closed-loop}} circulatory system. The heart pumps {{the blood}} in a single loop throughout the body. In most fish, the heart consists of four parts, including two chambers and an entrance and exit. The first part is the sinus venosus, a thin-walled sac that collects <b>blood</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> fish's veins before allowing it to flow to the second part, the atrium, which is a large muscular chamber. The atrium serves as a one-way antechamber, sends blood to the third part, ventricle. The ventricle is another thick-walled, muscular chamber and it pumps the blood, first to the fourth part, bulbus arteriosus, a large tube, and then out of the heart. The bulbus arteriosus connects to the aorta, through which blood flows to the gills for oxygenation.|$|E
5|$|In some instances, lumbar {{puncture}} {{may be required}} {{if there is a}} suspicion that the symptoms might be caused by other problems (meningitis or subarachnoid hemorrhage). This is the examination of the cerebrospinal fluid that envelops the brain and the spinal cord; the sample is obtained with a needle that is passed under local anesthetic into the spine. In pituitary apoplexy the results are typically normal, although abnormalities may be detected if <b>blood</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> pituitary has entered the subarachnoid space. If there is remaining doubt about the possibility of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), a magnetic resonance angiogram (MRI with a contrast agent) may be required to identify aneurysms of the brain blood vessels, {{the most common cause of}} SAH.|$|E
