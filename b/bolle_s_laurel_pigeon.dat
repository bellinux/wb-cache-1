The abundance of predators, estimated by bait consumption, showed a similar seasonal pattern, while fruit availability decreased over time from the first to third period.

50|$|Pigeons can breed {{from their}} first year, and nesting occurs {{throughout}} the year, although mainly from February to June. The displays {{are similar to those}} of the common wood pigeon; the male climbs quickly in flight, gives a loud wing-clap, and then glides down with his wings and tail spread. The display may be repeated two or three times before the bird returns to a perch. On the ground the male performs a bowing display with his neck inflated to show off the iridescent neck patches; meanwhile, the tail is raised, fanned, then closed again. This display is usually accompanied by calling. The nest is a typical pigeon construction, a flimsy structure of twigs and grasses usually placed high in the floor of canyon walls with lots of vegetation. Nestled among the crevices in rocks, in gullies of the hills. The usual clutch has a white egg one smooth white egg.

40|$|The diet of the endemic Madeira <b>Laurel</b> <b>Pigeon</b> Columba trocaz in {{agricultural}} and forest areas of Madeira Island was studied in 1997 {{by means of}} microhistological analysis of 157 faecal samples, 94 from two of the ma{{in agricultural}} zones and 63 from a laurel forest. Cabbage {{was the most important}} component of the diet in agricultural areas, representing more than 54 % of the optical fields analysed. Samples collected further from the forest contained a higher proportion of cabbage. Native fruits did not figure highly in the samples collected from agricultural areas and crop plants did not appear in the forest samples, suggesting a degree of dietary separation and that some individuals may concen-trate on crops. Madeira <b>Laurel</b> <b>Pigeon</b> is normally a highly frugivorous species and fruit availability is relatively high in winter when the birds go to agricultural areas to feed. This suggests {{that it is not a}} shortage of natural foods that causes them to leave the forest. The unpopularity of the pigeon as a result of its pest status is the main threat to its existence.

50|$|The Atlantic archipelagos of the Canaries, Azores, and Madeira have a {{volcanic}} origin {{and they have}} never been part of a continent.

50|$|The <b>laurel</b> <b>pigeon</b> is {{exclusively}} herbivorous. Nearly 60% of its diet is fruit, {{with most}} of the rest being leaves, and just 1% is flowers. The fruits of Til, Azores Laurel and Persea indica, and the fruits and leaves of small-leaved holly are the most frequently detected food items. Most seeds pass through the digestive system intact, apart from those of Azores Laurel, which are usually damaged. Fruit is the main component of the diet when it is readily available in autumn and winter, and leaves are consumed in spring and summer when fruits are scarce. In one study, 27% of the leaves consumed came from native trees, especially Small-leaved Holly, 61% from herbs and shrubs, and nearly 10% from introduced trees, mainly apples and peaches. This pigeon will feed in agricultural areas, where cabbage is the most commonly taken crop plant.|$|R

The largest subpopulation is found on La Palma, where it occurs across much of the northern half of the island.

It has recently also been recorded on El Hierro; however, breeding there has not yet been confirmed3,4. Although the species was recently suspected to be declining on Tenerife.

50|$|It is a {{resident}} breeder {{in the mountain}} laurisilva forest zone. Bolle's pigeon builds a stick nest in a tree, laying one white egg. Columba bollii occurs on Tenerife particularly at Anaga and Teno, La Palma in a restricted area of the north-east), La Gomera in Garajonay National Park with some birds outside the park, and El Hierro where it occurs in Golfo and Sabinosa in the Canary Islands, Spain. It may formerly have occurred on Gran Canaria, as bones {{similar to those of}} a <b>laurel</b> <b>pigeon</b> have been found and there is a possible sight record from the late 19th century. It was common in the past, but disappeared from many areas owing to clearance of laurel forest in the islands. More recently the rate of laurel forest clearance has been slowed or stopped. Population estimates for the species are 1,160-1,315 birds in 1980, 6,000 individuals in 2001, and 5,000-20,000 most recently. Whether these figures reveal genuine population increases is unclear, but the area of occupied territory appears to be expanding and despite several potential threats the population is at least stable, probably increasing.|$|R
