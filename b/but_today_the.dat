5|$|Navenby was {{originally}} an agricultural village, with most people {{living off the}} land or trading goods in the local market. Statistics show that, in 1841, 48% of villagers worked in agriculture, <b>but</b> <b>today</b> <b>the</b> majority of villagers, 67%, are employed in the service industry and most commute to work away from Navenby. The village does, however, offer limited work opportunities, with the High Street lined with shops, fast-food stores and public houses. A doctors' surgery, building society and residential care home are based in the village, although the post office closed in January 2011.|$|E
5|$|The main {{entrance}} to the castle would have involved crossing a stone bridge between the two easterly ditch bridge towers and the main gatehouse; little remains of the bridge towers today and a timber entrance way to the gatehouse replaces the bridge. A water gate overlooks a protected stairway of 127 steps that runs down {{to the foot of}} the cliffs. In the 13th century, the sea came up close to the stairway, allowing resupply by sea, <b>but</b> <b>today</b> <b>the</b> sea has retreated significantly, making it more difficult to envisage the concept in its original setting.|$|E
5|$|In the past, jackals {{competed with}} tigers and leopards, feeding on {{the remains of}} their kills and, in one case, on a dead tiger. Leopards once hunted jackals, <b>but</b> <b>today</b> <b>the</b> tiger is extinct in the jackal's range, and the leopard is rare. The jackal's {{competitors}} are the red fox, wolf, jungle cat, forest wildcat, and raccoon in the Caucasus, and the steppe wildcat in Central Asia. Wolves dominate jackals, and jackals dominate foxes. In Europe, the range of wolves and jackals is mutually exclusive, with jackals abandoning their territory {{with the arrival of}} a wolf pack. One experiment used loudspeakers to broadcast the calls of jackals, and this attracted wolves at a trotting pace to chase away the perceived competitors. Dogs responded to these calls in the same way while barking aggressively. Unleashed dogs have been observed to immediately chase away jackals when the jackals were detected. The jackal's recent expansion throughout eastern and western Europe has been attributed to the extermination of the local wolf populations. The present diffusion of the jackal into the northern Adriatic hinterland is in areas where the wolf is absent or very rare.|$|E

5|$|Of the 22 {{species of}} {{albatross}} recognised by the IUCN, all {{are listed as}} at some level of concern; 3 species are Critically Endangered, 5 species are Endangered, 7 species are Near Threatened, and 7 species are Vulnerable. Numbers of albatrosses have declined in the past due to harvesting for feathers, <b>but</b> <b>today</b> <b>the</b> albatrosses are threatened by introduced species, such as rats and feral cats that attack eggs, chicks and nesting adults; by pollution; by a serious decline in fish stocks in many regions largely due to overfishing; and by longline fishing. Longline fisheries pose the greatest threat, as feeding birds are attracted to the bait, become hooked on the lines, and drown. Identified stakeholders such as governments, conservation organisations {{and people in the}} fishing industry are all working toward reducing this bycatch.|$|E
5|$|The Ch'olan {{languages}} were formerly widespread {{throughout the}} Maya area, <b>but</b> <b>today</b> <b>the</b> language with most speakers is Ch'ol, spoken by 130,000 in Chiapas. Its closest relative, the Chontal Maya language, is spoken by 55,000 {{in the state}} of Tabasco. Another related language, now endangered, is Ch'orti', which is spoken by 30,000 in Guatemala. It was previously also spoken in extreme west of Honduras and El Salvador, but the Salvadorian variant is now extinct and the Honduran one is considered moribund. Ch'olti', a sister language of Ch'orti', is also extinct. Ch'olan languages are believed to be the most conservative in vocabulary and phonology, and are closely related to the language of the Classic-era inscriptions found in the Central Lowlands. They may have served as prestige languages, coexisting with other dialects in some areas. This assumption provides a plausible explanation for the geographical distance between the Ch'orti' zone and the areas where Ch'ol and Chontal are spoken.|$|E
5|$|The addax inhabits arid regions, semideserts {{and sandy}} and stony deserts. They even occur in {{extremely}} arid areas, {{with less than}} 100mm annual rainfall. They also inhabit deserts with tussock grasses (Stipagrostis species) and succulent thorn scrub Cornulaca. Formerly, the addax was widespread in the Sahelo-Saharan region of Africa, west of the Nile Valley and all countries sharing the Sahara Desert; <b>but</b> <b>today</b> <b>the</b> only known self-sustaining population {{is present in the}} Termit Massif Reserve (Niger). However, there are reports of sightings from the eastern Air Mountains (Niger) and Bodélé (Chad). Rare nomads may be seen in north Niger, southern Algeria and Libya; and the antelope is rumoured to be present along the Mali/Mauritania border, though there are no confirmed sightings. The addax was once abundant in North Africa, native to Chad, Mauritania and Niger. It is extinct in Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Sudan and western Sahara. It has been reintroduced in Morocco and Tunisia.|$|E

5|$|Trafalgar Day {{is marked}} on 21 October each {{year with a}} service held in the cathedral to honour Lord Nelson who {{attended}} the school as a boarding pupil from 1768 to 1769 under the headship of Edmond Simmons. Following the service the entire school gathers at Nelson's statue in the Close where there is the laying of wreaths accompanied by the Last Post. Each year a concert is held {{in recognition of the}} Dyers' which takes place in St James Garlickhythe, London or the school chapel. A House Music choral and instrumental competition takes place each year between the houses and culminates in an event in St Andrews Hall. Since 1915 there has been an annual race called the Cup Run, a successor of the game of hare and hounds which was a popular activity at the school. The six or seven mile course was originally near Trowse, <b>but</b> <b>today</b> <b>the</b> event is held at Mousehold Heath in Norwich. Sports day, first held in June 1861, occurs in Trinity term each year.|$|E

25|$|Solar cells produce {{direct current}} {{electricity}} from sunlight {{which can be}} used to power equipment or to recharge a battery. The first practical application of photovoltaics was to power orbiting satellites and other spacecraft, <b>but</b> <b>today</b> <b>the</b> majority of photovoltaic modules are used for grid connected power generation. In this case an inverter is required to convert the DC to AC. There is a smaller market for off-grid power for remote dwellings, boats, recreational vehicles, electric cars, roadside emergency telephones, remote sensing, and cathodic protection of pipelines.|$|E

25|$|It is {{difficult}} to discern the original purpose of lanterns in connection to the festival, but {{it is certain that}} lanterns were not used in conjunction with moon-worship prior to the Tang dynasty. Traditionally, the lantern has been used to symbolize fertility, and functioned mainly as a toy and decoration. <b>But</b> <b>today</b> <b>the</b> lantern has come to symbolize the festival itself. In the old days, lanterns were made in the image of natural things, myths, and local cultures. Over time, a greater variety of lanterns could be found as local cultures became influenced by their neighbors.|$|E
25|$|A {{bank holiday}} is a colloquial {{term for a}} public holiday in the United Kingdom, some Commonwealth countries, Hong Kong and the Republic of Ireland.

The first official bank holidays were the four days named in the Bank Holidays Act 1871, <b>but</b> <b>today</b> <b>the</b> term is colloquially used for Good Friday and Christmas Day which were already public holidays under common law and therefore not official bank holidays in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.|$|E
