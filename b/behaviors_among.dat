Each kick, groom, tilt of the ear, or other contact with another horse is a means of communicating.

25|$|Consistent {{with the}} {{expectations}} of the male warrior hypothesis, several studies have shown more ethnocentric and xenophobic beliefs and <b>behaviors</b> <b>among</b> men (compared to women), including the more frequent use of dehumanizing speech to describe outgroup members; stronger identification with their groups; greater cooperation when faced with competition from another group; a greater desire to engage in war when presented with images of attractive (but not unattractive) members of the opposite sex; greater overall rates of male-male competition and violence (as shown in violent crime and homicide statistics); and larger body size correlating with quicker anger responses.|$|E
25|$|In {{the dark}} habitat, {{certain types of}} {{displays}} are reduced in cavefish, but in other cases they have become stronger, shifting from displays that are aimed at being seen to displays aimed at being felt via water movement. For example, during the courtship of the cave form of the Mexican tetra the pair produce turbulence through exaggerated gill and mouth movements, allowing them to detect each other. Breeding <b>behaviors</b> <b>among</b> cavefish vary extensively, and there are both species that are egg-layers and ovoviparous species that give birth to live young. Uniquely among fish, the genus Amblyopsis brood their eggs in the gill chambers (somewhat like mouthbrooders).|$|E

40|$|Objective: This {{integrative}} review aims {{to summarize}} {{and identify the}} current literature related to health <b>behavior</b> <b>among</b> Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T 2 DM) Patients and its factors. Methods: An integrative review was undertaken using literature published between 2000 and 2013, based on CINAHL, Springer link, PubMed, Science Direct and Google Scholar. Results: Twenty-two articles were selected based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. This review indicated {{a wide range of}} factors influencing health <b>behavior</b> <b>among</b> T 2 DM patients including predisposing factors (socioeconomic, knowledge, stress management, and health belief), reinforcing factor (family support), and enabling factor (health service). Conclusion: Family support, socioeconomic and knowledge are the significant major factors of health <b>behavior</b> <b>among</b> T 2 DM patients. However, the others factors such as stress management, health belief and health service are also the important factors for T 2 DM patient’s health behaviors. Therefore, these factors should be considered for development of appropriate interventions to promote health <b>behavior</b> <b>among</b> T 2 DM patients at community. ...|$|R
500|$|However much {{planning}} an extraterrestrial civilization may do before contacting humanity, the humans may experience great shock and terror on their arrival, especially {{as they would}} lack any understanding of the contacting civilization. Ben Finney compares the situation {{to that of the}} tribespeople of New Guinea, an island that was settled fifty thousand years ago during the last glacial period but saw little {{contact with the outside world}} until the arrival of European colonial powers in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The huge difference between the indigenous stone-age society and the Europeans' technical civilization caused unexpected <b>behaviors</b> <b>among</b> the native populations known as cargo cults: to coax the gods into bringing them the technology that the Europeans possessed, the natives created wooden [...] "radio stations" [...] and [...] "airstrips" [...] as a form of sympathetic magic. Finney argues that humanity may misunderstand the true meaning of an extraterrestrial transmission to Earth, much as the people of New Guinea could not understand the source of modern goods and technologies. He concludes that the results of extraterrestrial contact will become known over the long term with rigorous study, rather than as fast, sharp events briefly making newspaper headlines.|$|E
2500|$|Latin {{had such}} a wealth of words for men outside the {{masculine}} norm that some scholars argue {{for the existence of}} a homosexual subculture at Rome; that is, although the noun [...] "homosexual" [...] has no straightforward equivalent in Latin, literary sources reveal a pattern of <b>behaviors</b> <b>among</b> a minority of free men that indicate same-sex preference or orientation. Plautus mentions a street known for male prostitutes. Public baths are also referred to as a place to find sexual partners. Juvenal states that such men scratched their heads with a finger to identify themselves.|$|E
2500|$|Addams' {{construction}} of womanhood involved daughterhood, sexuality, wifehood, and motherhood. In {{both of her}} autobiographical volumes, Twenty Years at Hull-House (1910) and The Second Twenty Years at Hull-House (1930), Addams's gender constructions parallel the Progressive-Era ideology she championed. In A New Conscience and an Ancient Evil (1912) she dissected the social pathology of sex slavery, prostitution and other sexual <b>behaviors</b> <b>among</b> working class women in American industrial centers during 1890-1910. Addams's autobiographical persona manifests her ideology and supports her popularized public activist persona as the [...] "Mother of Social Work," [...] {{in the sense that}} she represents herself as a celibate matron, who served the suffering immigrant masses through Hull-House, as if they were her own children. Although not a mother herself, Addams became the [...] "mother to the nation," [...] identified with motherhood in the sense of protective care of her people.|$|E

2500|$|Because most {{research}} on anal intercourse addresses {{men who have}} sex with men, little data exists on the prevalence of anal intercourse among heterosexual couples. In Kimberly R. McBride's 2010 clinical review on heterosexual anal intercourse and other forms of anal sexual activity, it is suggested that changing norms may affect the frequency of heterosexual anal sex. McBride and her colleagues investigated the prevalence of non-intercourse anal sex <b>behaviors</b> <b>among</b> a sample of men (n=1,299) and women (n=1,919) compared to anal intercourse experience and found that 51% of men and 43% of women had participated in at least one act of oral–anal sex, manual–anal sex, or anal sex toy use. The report states the majority of men (n=631) and women (n=856) who reported heterosexual anal intercourse in the past 12 months were in exclusive, monogamous relationships: 69% and 73%, respectively. The review added that because [...] "relatively little attention [...] given to anal intercourse and other anal sexual behaviors between heterosexual partners", this means that it is [...] "quite rare" [...] to have research [...] "that specifically differentiates the anus as a sexual organ or addresses anal sexual function or dysfunction as legitimate topics. As a result, we do not know the extent to which anal intercourse differs qualitatively from coitus." ...|$|E

Risky behavior {{is considered one of}} the most pressing of current social problems. Of particular concern is the increase in delinquency among young people. Given the significant social concern surrounding the problem of youth delinquency, it is reasonable for policy makers, academics and citizens to ask what might cause misbehavior. The methodology of this paper is based on studying and analyzing the topic of risky <b>behavior</b> <b>among</b> youths by clarifying the concept, introducing its classification and identifying its determinants depending on the literature review on different models that explain risky <b>behavior</b> <b>among</b> youths. Additionally, a designed questionnaire is used in order to identify the classification and the determinants of risky behavior, particularly drug use, in Egypt...|$|R
