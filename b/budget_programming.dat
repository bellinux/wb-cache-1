The present {{study was designed to}} evaluate the responses of Taiwanese hospitals to a new global <b>budget</b> <b>program</b> implemented in 2002. Methods Using data obtained from the Bureau of National Health Insurance (NHI) and two nationwide surveys conducted before and after the global <b>budget</b> <b>program,</b> changes in the length of stay, treatment intensity, insurance claims, and out-of-pocket fees were compared in 2002 and 2004. The analysis was conducted using the Generalized Estimating Equations (GEEs) method. Results Regression models revealed that implementation of the global budget was followed by a 7 % increase in length of stay and a 15 % {{increase in the number of}} prescribed procedures and medications per admission. The claim expenses increased by 14 %, and out-of-pocket fees per admission increased by 6 %. Among the hospitals, no coalition action was found during the study period. Conclusions In the present study, it appears that hospitals attempted to increase per-case expense claims to protect their reimbursement from possible discounts under a global budget cap. How Taiwanese hospitals respond to this challenge in the future deserves continued, long-term observation. Global budget Health insurance Hospital Taiwan...|$|R
40|$|This {{cumulative}} dissertation presents 5 {{contributions that}} deliver novel insights on development issues and investment strategies in Africa. Chapter II and IV {{focus on the}} analysis of potential impacts of public health expenditures on productivity and hence future growth. In particular, chapter II provides an empirical analysis {{of the impact of}} public health expenditures on farmer’s productivity using the Tanzania case study. Likewise, I investigate the potential impact of out-of-pocket health expenditures on agricultural productivity and poverty in Chapter III and IV, respectively. Beyond public spending, private expenditures, especially out-of-pocket health expenditures, also have an impact on productivity, although having an impoverishing effect on households and constraining the productivity generating process when they became catastrophic. The issue on the impoverishment of out-of-pocket health expenditures is largely discussed in chapter III, which additionally used a conditional mixed process to estimate their determinants. Both chapter II and IV emphasize the need for greater investment in the non-agricultural health sector in order to both meet the social demand and generate productivity growth. Chapter V provides the second major contribution to this dissertation by analyzing the policy-growth linkages in addition to the growth-poverty linkages. It provides a method that identifies the key sectors and key policy programs by considering the cost issue of generating growth that is often overlooked. This method combines empirical and expert survey data to estimate a Policy Impact Function and uses Senegal as a case study. Beyond all the identification of economic and political solutions, the implementation of the budget allocation between the different sectors and the different policy programs is a crucial point in achieving targeted growth and poverty reduction. Chapter VI analyzes the impact of a Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) – a multi-year <b>budget</b> <b>programming</b> tool - in Africa, with a special focus in Senegal...|$|E

The motivation behind this discussion was to seek a better understanding and familiarity with each of the various approaches to budgeting. None of them, however, can be regarded as a complete solution to budget problems. Each approach carries both strengths and weaknesses and thus cannot be applied indiscriminately to any given situation or financial environment. A solution for any budget problem depends on the nature of the organization affected and hence would require a thorough assessment of its operating environment before being carried out...|$|R
