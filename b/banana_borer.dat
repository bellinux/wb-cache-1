40|$|ABSTRACT: In this study, we {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} Cosmopolites sordidus (Coleoptera: Dryophthoridae) infestation among different banana genotypes {{in a commercial}} banana orchard {{over the course of}} 30 months. <b>Banana</b> root <b>borer</b> infestation was compared in 20 banana genotypes, including five varieties and 15 hybrids. Overall, we observed that 94. 17 % of pest infestation cases occurred in the cortex region, and only 5. 83 % occurred in the central cylinder. Genotypes least sensitive to infestation were the Prata Anã (AAB) and Pacovan (AAB) varieties, where no damage was recorded. Among the hybrid genotypes, PV 9401 and BRS Fhia 18 showed intermediate levels of sensitivity, while BRS Tropical hybrids (AAAB), PA 9401 (AAAB), BRS Vitoria (AAAB), YB 4203 (AAAB), and Bucaneiro (AAAA) were the most sensitive to attack by <b>banana</b> root <b>borer.</b> This study demonstrated that the infestation of the <b>banana</b> root <b>borer</b> varies according <b>banana</b> plant genotype, and the utilization of less susceptible genotypes could reduce infestation rates of C. sordidus...|$|R

40|$|Among {{the species}} of <b>banana</b> <b>borers,</b> black weevil (Cosmopolites sordidus) {{is the most}} {{economically}} important pest in Costa Rica and worldwide. The control of C. sordidus in intensive production systems is mainly based on application of insecticides; therefore the search for biological alternatives, {{such as the use}} of entomopathogenic nematodes (EPN), is needed. The susceptibility of Cosmopolites sordidus to Heterorhabditis atacamensis CIANE 07 was evaluated. The effect of inoculating H. atacamensis on larvae and adults of C. sordidus, in vitro and in artificially infected corms, was evaluated. Larvae inoculated with EPN had a mortality of 88 % on the second day and 100 % on the third day; no mortality was observed in adults. The treatments of 100, 500 and 1000 IJ. larvae- 1 showed statistically significant differences from the control and theLD 50 was 52 IJ. larvae- 1. When the larvae were placed within the corms the LD 50 increased to 375 IJ. larvae- 1. The results indicate that the strain H. atacamensis CIA-NE 07 is capable of locating and infecting weevil larvae within the banana corm and reach infection levels over 80 %, 10 days after inoculation at doses of 1000 and 2000 IJ. larvae- 1. The entomopathogenic nematodes are a viable alternative to be considered in the Integrated Pest Management programs of black weevil, in crops such us banana and plantain...|$|R

In a field trial, 21 of 24 treated plants survived. All of 18 treated plants survived in a greenhouse trial. An additional group of 18 plants all survived in a greenhouse following a treatment of 43. 3 °C for 3. 5 hours. Control plants for the three groups exhibited reduced survival. All of the 75 eggs and 160 adult weevils tested died. Post-treatment dissections of heavily infested corms yielded larval (n = 725) and pupal (n = 28) mortalities of 99. 9 % and 96. 4 %, respectively.

40|$|The <b>banana</b> {{pseudostem}} <b>borer</b> Odoiporus longicollis (Oliv.) is {{the most}} serious pest of banana plantation in Manipur. The present study on the anatomy and histomorphology of alimentary tract of adult weevil is one of the striking scientific aspects as the stage has to propagate the pests race. The digestive tract is tubular and coiled structure having 39 - 42 mm in length measuring almost double the length of the body (measuring 18 - 22 mm long). The tract is divisible into Stomodaeum or foregut measuring 9 - 11 mm. in length, Mesenteron or Midgut is 20 - 22 mm in length and Proctodaeum or Hindgut measuring 10 - 11 mm in length. These parts are well demarcated by the presence of distinct grooves. Stomodaeum has pharynx, oesophagus, crop and stomodaeum valve having the histological layers like lumen,inner intimal layer, outer intimal, epithelium, basement membrane, musculatures; Mesenteron possees anterior voluminous, middle tubular and posterior with regenerative crypts with histological layers of lumen, peritrophic membrane, epithelium, basement membrane and the last proctodaeum has pylorus, Ilium, Colon and rectum with histological layers namely lumen, intima, epithelium, basement membrane and muscularis repectively...|$|R
40|$|International audiencePersistent organic {{pollutants}} {{have not been}} conclusively associated with length of gestation or with preterm birth. Chlordecone is an organochlorine pesticide that has been extensively used to control the <b>banana</b> root <b>borer</b> population in the French West Indies. Data from the Timoun Mother-Child Cohort Study conducted in Guadeloupe between 2004 and 2007 were {{used to examine the}} associations of chlordecone concentrations in maternal plasma with the length of gestation and the rate preterm birth in 818 pregnant women. Data were analyzed using multivariate linear regression for length of gestation and a Cox model for preterm birth. The median plasma chlordecone concentration was 0. 39 µg/L (interquartile range, 0. 18 - 0. 83). No correlation was observed with plasma concentrations of p,p'-dichlorodiphenyl dichloroethene (ρ = 0. 017) or polychlorinated biphenyl 153 (ρ = - 0. 016), the other main organochlorine compounds detected. A 1 -log 10 increase in chlordecone concentration was associated with a decreased length of gestation (- 0. 27 weeks; 95 % confidence interval: - 0. 50, - 0. 03) and an increased risk of preterm birth (60 %; 95 % confidence interval: 10, 130). These associations may result from the estrogen-like and progestin-like properties of chlordecone. These results are of public health relevance because of the prolonged persistence of chlordecone in the environment and the high background rate of preterm births in this population...|$|R
40|$|International audienceChlordecone is a {{persistent}} organochlorine pesticide {{that was used}} in the French West Indies until the early 1990 s for <b>banana</b> weevil <b>borer</b> control. Human exposure to this chemical in this area still occurs nowadays due to consumption of contaminated food. Although adverse effects on neurodevelopment, including tremors and memory deficits, have been documented in experimental studies conducted with rodents exposed during the gestational and neonatal periods, no study has been conducted yet to determine if chlordecone alters child development. This study examines the relation of gestational and postnatal exposure to chlordecone to infant development at 18 months of age in a birth-cohort of Guadeloupean children. In a prospective longitudinal study conducted in Guadeloupe (Timoun mother-child cohort study), exposure to chlordecone was measured at birth from an umbilical cord blood sample (n= 141) and from a breast milk sample collected at 3 months postpartum (n= 75). Toddlers were assessed using an adapted version of the Ages and Stages Questionnaire. Higher chlordecone concentrations in cord blood were associated with poorer fine motor scores. When analyses were conducted separately for boys and girls, this effect was only observed among boys. These results suggest that prenatal exposure to chlordecone is associated with specific impairments in fine motor function in boys, and add to the growing evidence that exposure to organochlorine pesticides early in life impairs child development...|$|R
40|$|The <b>banana</b> weevil <b>borer</b> (Cosmopolites sordidus) is {{the main}} pest of banana crops, causing {{significant}} losses in productivity, being recommended control by chemical insecticides which cause several environmental impacts. On the other hand, entomopathogenic nematodes can be {{an alternative to the}} pest control, mainly because of their habits. Thus, this study aimed at evaluating isolated entomopathogenic nematodes under laboratory conditions and also their interaction with a chemical insecticide (carbofuran), aiming at their use for the weevil borer control. Sixteen Sterinernematidae and Heterorhabditidae isolates were evaluated, applied over the banana tree pseudo stem (100 JIs/cm²) and they were compared to one another concerning mortality caused in adults individual of C. sordidus. The most infective isolates were subjected to in vivo multiplication at the host Galleria mellonella and interaction with the insecticide carbofuran, including in this case, viability and infectivity analysis of the entomopathogenic nematodes exposed to the product, as well as the effect of the insecticide on the symbiotic bacteria of the entomopathogenic nematodes. The experiments at this stage were conducted in completely randomized design and the data were subjected to ANOVA, with application of the Tukey test (p < 0. 05). The most virulent isolates were IBCBn 24 and IBCBn 40 (respectively 33. 3 % and 36. 7 % of confirmed mortality), which also showed high multiplication in corpses. The insecticide did not affect the viability of the isolate, but it really harmed its infectivity, although it did not affect the development of the symbiotic bacterium...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBackground Chlordecone is a {{persistent}} organochlorine insecticide with well-defined estrogenic properties. It was intensively {{used in the}} French West Indies until 1993 to control the <b>banana</b> root <b>borer.</b> Because of the long-term contamination of soils and water, the population is currently exposed to chlordecone through food consumption. Chlordecone {{has been found in}} the blood of pregnant women and in cord blood. It {{has been shown to be}} an endocrine-disrupting chemical and exposure during pregnancy may affect fetal growth. Objectives The objective of our study was to examine the association between prenatal exposure to chlordecone and fetal growth based on the TIMOUN birth cohort conducted in Guadeloupe, with a focus on the potential modification of this relationship by maternal body mass index (BMI) and gestational weight gain (GWG). Methods Chlordecone was determined in cord plasma at birth in 593 babies. Birth weight was the indicator of fetal growth. Maternal pre-pregnancy BMI and GWG were determined. Adherence to GWG recommendations of the US Institute of Medicine based on maternal pre-pregnancy BMI was assessed. Birth weight was analyzed relative to cord blood chlordecone levels using linear and non-linear regression models. Results Overall chlordecone in cord blood was not associated with birth weight, but we found an interaction between chlordecone exposure with GWG and adherence to GWG recommendations. After stratification by GWG, we found a significant U-shaped association between birth weight and chlordecone exposure, within the upper quartiles of GWG or excessive GWG. Conclusion Chlordecone exposure may affect fetal growth, particularly when excessive GWG is present. © 2016 Elsevier Inc...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: The {{insecticide}} chlordecone was extensively {{used in the}} French West Indies {{to control}} <b>banana</b> root <b>borer.</b> Its persistence in soils {{has led to the}} widespread pollution of the environment, and human beings are still exposed to this chemical. Chlordecone has been shown to impair neurological and behavioural functions in rodents when exposed gestationally or neonatally. OBJECTIVES: The aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate the impact of prenatal and postnatal exposure to chlordecone on the cognitive, visual, and motor development of 7 -month-old infants from Guadeloupe. METHODS: Infants were tested at 7 months (n= 153). Visual recognition memory and processing speed were assessed with the Fagan Tests of Infant Intelligence (FTII), visual acuity with the Teller Acuity Card, and fine motor development with the Brunet-Lezine. Samples of cord blood and breast milk at 3 months (n= 88) were analyzed for chlordecone concentrations. Postnatal exposure was determined through breast feeding and frequency of contaminated food consumption by the infants. RESULTS: Cord chlordecone concentrations in tertiles were associated with reduced novelty preference on the FTII in the highly exposed group (β=- 0. 19, p= 0. 02). Postnatal exposure through contaminated food consumption was marginally related to reduced novelty preference (β=- 0. 14, p= 0. 07), and longer processing speed (β= 0. 16, p= 0. 07). Detectable levels of chlordecone in cord blood were associated with higher risk of obtaining low scores on the fine motor development scale (OR= 1. 25, p< 0. 01). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that pre- and postnatal low chronic exposure to chlordecone is associated with negative effects on cognitive and motor development during infancy...|$|R
40|$|Several {{important}} pests {{that attack}} fruit in the South Pacific region are being controlled with biological agents instead of chemical sprays. In some cases this {{will mean that}} fruit exports, previously banned because of chemical residues, can soon be resumed. Fruit-piercing moths cause widespread damage to fruit in Western Samoa and Fiji. There is a local parasite of the moth, {{but because it is}} not very effective, another parasite has been imported. Now the two parasites are giving good control. In Papua New Guinea the banana skipper, a butterfly whose larvae defoliate banana plants, is now being attacked by parasitic wasps. The release of these wasps was made only after extensive trials, because there is also a near relative of the banana skipper in Papua New Guinea, which is beautiful but harmless. Scientists wanted to make certain that the parasitic wasps would not attack these harmless butterflies. Extensive tests by the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) showed that the parasitic wasps were specific to the pest butterfly. Their release was therefore permitted and it seems that they are already having an effect on the banana skipper population. Scientists from ACIAR are also developing ways of using nematodes to attack and kin pests. In Tonga they are testing 35 different strains of nematodes against the <b>banana</b> weevil <b>borer.</b> One strain of nematode is proving particularly effective. ACIAR has been extending its biological control work to include control of weeds such as the giant sensitive plant (Mimosa in visa) and water hyacinth.
