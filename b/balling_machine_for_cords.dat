50|$|The most {{commonly}} used instruments <b>for</b> <b>cord</b> cutting include a sickle, knife, bamboo stick, and razor. These instruments are rarely washed thoroughly before and after being implemented. If placental delivery is not occurring, some methods used to remove the placenta include procedures that require internal manipulation. This can be anything from pulling on the umbilical cord to inducing choking or vomiting in the mother. Once the placenta is removed and cut, mustard oil and turmeric are often used <b>for</b> <b>cord</b> dressing. Depending on the ethnic backgrounds, different customs are applied for the disposal of the placenta. Some believe that if the placenta touches the soil, or if an animal eats the placenta, the child will fall ill. So many tend to bury the placenta or throw it into thick bamboo bushes.|$|R

40|$|In {{the market}} for cutting tools there are not {{specific}} tools <b>for</b> <b>machining</b> polymers, where the main difficulty is chip control. Cutting tools are only available <b>for</b> <b>machining</b> metals. In this study, tests were performed turning nylon, {{with the use of}} standard carbide tools, in order to identify tool geometries and cutting parameters able to perform the machining of the material, controlling the chip in the best way possible. The comparison criterion used was the chips formation, since usually for nylon, occurs on continuous tape. The tools that have the best results were the TNMG 160408 -PF, used <b>for</b> <b>machining</b> steel with the following cutting parameters: cutting speed of 450 m/min, depth of cut of 2. 0 mm and advancement of 0. 35 mm/rev; whose chip formed long tubular long tangle, and the tool CCGT- 120408 <b>BAL,</b> <b>for</b> the <b>machining</b> of aluminum, with the same depth and advancement parameters, but with cutting speeds of 600 m/min and 750 m/min, providing chip formation of fragmente...|$|R

50|$|Ngunyi then uses electoral {{demographics}} {{to build}} what, on examination, {{was described as}} a house of cards. The Jubilee Alliance, he argued, begins with such a large numerical advantage the effort needed to secure an electoral victory is infinitesimally small. He argue Jubilee should win the presidential election in the first round. This inevitable victory comes from the Jubilee Coalition’s “bankable” ethnic vote of 6.2 Million (or 43.2% of the total vote). This number is basically a totting up of the registered GEMA and the Kalenjin voters. On that same ethnic logic, Mutahi reckons that CORD Coalition startsoff with 19.2% of the vote or 2.74 million votes. <b>For</b> <b>CORD</b> to win, he says, they need to double their support. Or as he puts it, <b>for</b> <b>CORD</b> to catch up with Jubilee, it must multiply each of its Kamba and Luo vote by 2.3. Virtually impossible is the implication.|$|R
