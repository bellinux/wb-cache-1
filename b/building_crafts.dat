5000|$|The Venice Charter and its {{subsequent}} interpretations have attracted criticism, especially {{by those who}} perceive it was built upon the Modernist biases of its creators. Professor of architecture Samir Younés has written: [...] "The Charter’s abhorrence of restoration and reconstruction - with its implicit fear of [...] "false history" [...] - reflects the Modernist theory of historical determinism, rather than {{the idea of a}} living architectural tradition. Major advances over the last 40 years in traditional design fluency and <b>building</b> <b>crafts</b> skills have undercut and outmoded many of the assumptions implicit in the Venice Charter. As a result, many now believe that visual harmony, aesthetic balance and the essential character of a place are of greater importance than abstract Modernist theories." ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I {{am trying to}} analyse the state of {{traditional}} <b>building</b> <b>craft</b> skills in Sweden today. The need of traditional skills and knowledge {{have been on the}} agenda the last years. Sweden ratified the UNESCO Convention for the safeguarding of the Intangeble Cultural heritage in 2003, the challenges of building a sustinible future and the manitanance of our whole built cultural heritage are central reasons. During 2010 and 2011 I was through my work involved in two substantial inventories with the aim of mapping the national situation of craft skills. One inventorie was conducted as a number of seminars arranged all over the country inviting craftsmen and people who work with restaurations to discuss the need for knowledge and what is already provided for. The other inventorie was a survey that was e-mailed to 1 440 persons working in crafts and restaurations ask of their need of traning and their oppinion of other persons need of traning and knowledge. Together with a review of the existing craft schools and educational programs in <b>building</b> <b>craft</b> skills I have been able to identify a number of skills that are in decline or in some cases already forgotten. But I can also distinguish areas where the knowledge exists and the interest increases.
