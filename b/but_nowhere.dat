5|$|The time-line for Salamis is {{difficult}} to establish with any certainty. Herodotus presents the battle as though it occurred directly after the capture of Athens, <b>but</b> <b>nowhere</b> explicitly states as much. If Thermopylae/Artemisium occurred in September, then {{this may be the}} case, but it is probably more likely that the Persians spent two or three weeks capturing Athens, refitting the fleet, and resupplying. Clearly though, at some point after capturing Athens, Xerxes held a council of war with the Persian fleet; Herodotus says this occurred at Phalerum. Artemisia, queen of Halicarnassus and commander of its naval squadron in Xerxes's fleet, tried to convince him to wait for the Allies to surrender believing that battle in the straits of Salamis was an unnecessary risk. Nevertheless, Xerxes and his chief advisor Mardonius pressed for an attack.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the high}} regard held for {{dominion}} troops {{as a result of}} their exploits in France during the war they were specifically targeted for recruitment. Indeed, some 400 to 500 men of the Australian Imperial Force (AIF)—who were in England awaiting repatriation to Australia following the end of the war—initially indicated a willingness to join, <b>but</b> <b>nowhere</b> near as many actually enlisted. All Australians who volunteered were discharged from the AIF and re-enlisted in the British army as private soldiers for a period of one year. This was necessary because the dominions had already indicated that they were not interested in providing forces for the intervention. Ultimately about 150 Australians enlisted to serve in the NRRF, most of them recruited by Major Harry Harcourt. The Australians mainly served in the 45th Battalion and the 201st Machine Gun Battalion under Sadlier-Jackson, although some may also have served in the 46th Battalion. Despite being enlisted in the British Army the Australians wore uniforms of the AIF and were formed into two mainly Australian companies in the 45th Battalion.|$|E

According to King, the Gospel of Mary shows that she was an influential figure, a prominent disciple and leader of one wing of the early Christian movement that promoted women's leadership.|$|E

World War I created demands for American agricultural products, and CAC established new food production committees, information services and cultivation projects to help improve food production and conservation in Colorado. World War I also drew men from campus to Europe's battlefields. In June 1916, the National Defense Act created the Reserve Officers Training Corps. A few months later CAC applied to establish an ROTC unit in Fort Collins and resurrected a defunct National Guard unit on campus.|$|E

Political instability in thirteenth-century Italy forced the papal court to move to several different locations. Destinations included Viterbo, Orvieto, and Perugia. The popes brought the Roman Curia with them, and the College of Cardinals met in the city where the last pope had died to hold papal elections. Host cities enjoyed a boost to their prestige and certain economic advantages, but the municipal authorities risked being subsumed into the administration of the Papal States if they allowed the pope to overstay his welcome.|$|E

25|$|In {{agreement}} {{with a call}} from three vacant churches of Oxford, Paynesville and Elizabeth, Alabama, Loughridge preached six months; soon afterward, Loughridge was appointed by the Presbyterian board for foreign missions to visit the Creek Indians, west of Arkansas, {{to find out whether}} or not {{they would be willing to}} allow a preaching and mission school on their lands. Loughridge set out on horse-back, November 2, 1841, from Eutaw, and rode about six hundred miles. On December 6 he met the chiefs of the Creek (Muskogee) Nation, and brought the matter before them. Loughridge had to wait about three weeks for the council to meet to consider his proposal; While there he took time visiting several parts of the nation; there was not a missionary in the whole nation, nor was there an institution of learning in all the land, except a little government school which pretended to be taught by a man who was afterwards proved to be a counterfeiter. When the council met they told Loughridge that they did not want preaching, because it broke up their old customs, their busks, ball-plays and dances; but they did want him to come and establish a school. He informed them that he was a preacher, and unless they allowed him to preach to the people he would not come help them. After long conference, they finally decided that if he would establish a school they would allow him to preach at the school-house, <b>but</b> <b>nowhere</b> else; after significant uncertainty Loughridge agreed to these terms; and mounting his horse he returned to Alabama to prepare for the move to Indian Territory. After some delay in getting ready, he returned by steamer, and arrived, with his young wife, in the nation, at the Verdigris landing, February 5, 1843.|$|E

[...] Dutch public TV channel Nederland 2's daily news programme Netwerk reported that numerous American supporters of Israel financially supported Wilders' Party for Freedom (PVV) and openly approved of his message towards Islam and Islamic terrorism. Wilders told an audience during the report that [...] "We [...] are all Israel".

500|$|In Andrew Hickey's opinion, the [...] "bad press" [...] {{attached}} to [...] "Piggies" [...] is unjustified, given that Harrison's [...] "attitude of 'look at those squares with their boring lives'" [...] was commonplace among rock musicians in the 1960s. Hickey {{adds that the}} track contains one of its composer's best vocal performances and deems the song to be [...] "quite a fun little grotesquerie – a caricature, yes, <b>but</b> <b>nowhere</b> near as mean-spirited as its detractors would claim". Reviewing Harrison's career in a 2002 issue of Goldmine magazine, Dave Thompson termed [...] "Piggies" [...] "whimsically foreboding" [...] and grouped it with late-period Beatles songs such as [...] "Something" [...] and [...] "Long, Long, Long" [...] that anticipated Harrison's successes as a solo artist after the group's break-up in 1970. Tim Riley describes the song's narrative as [...] "smug anti-elitism outdone only by the dourness of John's 'Glass Onion' and 'Sexy Sadie'". With regard to George Martin's contention that The Beatles should have been edited down to a single disc, however, he views [...] "Piggies" [...] {{as one of the}} White Album [...] "essentials" [...] contributed by Harrison, along with [...] "While My Guitar Gently Weeps" [...] and [...] "Savoy Truffle".|$|E

500|$|Richard Armitage plays series protagonist John Porter. Porter {{served with}} the SAS until he was {{discharged}} after he spared {{the life of a}} boy who was believed to have subsequently killed two soldiers in his unit following a rescue operation the night before the Iraq invasion. He is brought back into service by Section 20 seven years later. He is married to Diane, and has a daughter, Alexandra. Armitage described Porter as a [...] "damaged hero", and [...] "sort of like Lucas North, only on some kind of go-faster drug." [...] In order to fit into the role, Armitage had to [...] "bulk up for the role," [...] and performed a lot of training for about ten weeks in the UK, and then flew to Johannesburg the day after filming the eighth series of Spooks wrapped up, where he proceeded with more training. He was trained from [...] "how to hold a gun to how you can run through a door without getting your head blown off." [...] Armitage had not trained as hard as in the past; the intensity of such training almost made him pass out after the first workout, stating [...] "filming Spooks is demanding, <b>but</b> <b>nowhere</b> near as physical as this." [...] Armitage performed most of his own stunts.|$|E
500|$|The finale {{brings out}} Haydn's playfulness. The sound effect that predominates is unison bariolage, a {{technique}} heard for instance {{at the very}} opening: [...] the first violinist fingers the note A on the D string, then bows {{in a way that}} rapidly alternates playing this fingered A with the identically-pitched A on the adjacent open (unfingered) A string. The resulting strange pulsating effect is the consequence of an open string having a quite distinct timbre (louder, more ringing) from a fingered one. Haydn employed unison bariolage in a number of his works (such as the [...] "Farewell" [...] Symphony), <b>but</b> <b>nowhere</b> is it employed as obsessively as in the Opus 50 No. 6 finale. The sound of unison bariolage has reminded some listeners of a croaking frog, and is what earned the quartet its nickname. But the movement is no mere auditory joke. It contains important thematic connections to the earlier movements that, aside from the explicit segues between movements, result in a significant degree of cyclic integration. The most important thematic connection is that the closing-phrase opening of the first movement reappears in the finale in a modified form: it no longer stands alone, but as the second part of an eight-measure phrase that forms the movement's secondary theme. Presented in this context, the ambiguity inherent in its appearance in the first movement is resolved.|$|E
500|$|Becky Bain of {{the website}} Idolator viewed [...] "Love On Top" [...] as [...] "joyful tune {{that doubles as}} a throwback to a simpler time" [...] and added that Beyoncé's energy is [...] "infectious". Conrad Tao of Sputnikmusic showed high favoritism towards [...] "Love On Top", writing: [...] " [...] as she forces herself into a rarely used high range, she sets for a perfect {{catharsis}} for the burgeoning sexual passions of the album's first two thirds", and describing the outcome as [...] "absolutely magnificent". Melinda Newman of HitFix commented [...] "the soulful, exuberant, mid-tempo finger snapper, 'Love On Top' is deliciously sunny and sweet." [...] James Reed of The Boston Globe wrote that [...] "Love on Top' sounds like the pretty young thing of Michael Jackson's 'P.Y.T.' grew up to make a sequel to that 1983 hit." [...] Similarly, Joanne Dorken of MTV UK who described [...] "Love On Top" [...] as [...] "scream 'classic disco', catchy, [...] more uptempo and differing {{from the rest of the}} album", concluded that the song shows Beyoncé's versatility and that it is [...] "very Jackson 5". Ben Cardew of Music Week stated that [...] "Love On Top" [...] is summery and [...] "laidback, rather than massively immediate". However, he added that it proves to be a grower as it [...] "ratchets up the key changes on the final third", further writing that Beyoncé's voice sounds [...] "particularly impressive". A mixed review came from Adam Markovitz of Entertainment Weekly, who compared Beyoncé's work on [...] "Love On Top" [...] to that of past idols such as Luther Vandross and Diana Ross, but felt the tone overshadowed her style, stating [...] "she gets lost in her idols' polyester-swathed shadows." [...] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times noted that the song was [...] "slinky <b>but</b> <b>nowhere</b> near sexy" [...] adding that it sounds like a song young Brandy Norwood would release.|$|E
