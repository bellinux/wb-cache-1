The 1975 match at Laurel Valley Golf Club was similar with the United States winning 21–11. The format changed again in 1977, as matches were reduced by nearly a third leaving 20 points available. The changed requested by Great Britain & Ireland did little to change the outcome, as the United States won 12½–7½. Golfers from continental Europe were allowed to compete {{for the first time in}} 1979. There was another change to the format, the first two days now consisted of eight foursomes and fourballs, with twelve singles matches on the final day. Again, the changes had little effect on the outcome as the United States won 17–11.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Hybrid imaging systems, {{consisting}} of fluoroscopy and echocardiography, are increasingly selected for intra-operative support of minimally invasive cardiac interventions. Intracardiac echocardiograpy (ICE) is an emerging modality {{with the promise}} of removing sedation or general anesthesia associated with transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). We introduce a novel 6 degrees of freedom (DoF) pose estimation ap-proach for catheters (equipped with radiopaque ball markers) in single X-Ray fluoroscopy projection and investigate the method’s application to a prototype ICE catheter. Machine learning based catheter detection is implemented in a Bayesian hypothesis fusion framework, followed by refinement of <b>ball</b> <b>marker</b> locations through template matching. Marker correspondence and 3 D pose estimation are solved through iterative op-timization. The method registers the ICE volume to the C-arm coordinate system. Experiments are performed on synthetic and porcine in-vivo data. Target registration error (TRE), defined in the echo cone, is the basis of our preliminary evaluation. The method reached 8. 06 ± 7. 2 mm TRE on 703 cases. Potential uses of our hybrid system include structural heart disease interventions and electrophysiologycal mapping or catheter ablation pro-cedures. ...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} cephalometric {{study on}} the accuracy of independently locating eight landmarks and the subsequent effects on the maxillary (ILs/NL) and mandibular (ILi/ML) incisor angulation was carried out on 30 dry skulls. The true location of each landmark was marked with a steel ball glued onto the skulls. Two additional steel balls were used as reference markers. A purpose-designed skullholder was made to assure a firm and reproducible positioning of the skulls in the cephalostat. Six series of cephalograms were recorded. One reference series with all the steel balls, four series each with a single steel <b>ball</b> <b>marker</b> removed, one at a time, from each jaw and one series with all the steel ball markers removed, except the reference markers. The combined method error in relocating and replacing the steel ball markers, repositioning the skulls into the skull holder, and digitizing, was low. From the first series, the true position of the palane (NL), the maxillary incisor line (ILs), the mandibular plane (ML) and the mandibular incisor line (ILi) were assessed. From series 2 to 5, each of the landmarks without the steel ball markers was estimated. The accuracy of each landmark was then assessed relative to the true cephalometric plane and its perpendicular. On average, the accuracy was high for all the landmarks except posterior nasal spine (PNS), which was estimated 1. 2 mm too far anteriorly (p< 0. 05). The standard deviations of {{the accuracy of the}} dental and skeletal landmarks were similar, being 1. 4 to 2. 4 mm.

40|$|Introduction The Oxford Unicompartmental Knee Replacement (UKR) has {{a mobile}} bearing, {{which is known}} to reduce the wear rate and {{reproduce}} normal knee kinematics. The design of the bearing has a fully congruent spherical surface on the femoral side and a at fully congruent surface on the tibial side. Unfortunately {{a small number of}} ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) bearings have fractured after several years (average 17 years) in vivo. The fractured bearings all showed signs of wear and impingement, indicating surgical technique may be to blame. In almost all cases the fracture was transverse across the centre of the bearing; these fractures were examined in a previous study [1]. In phase I and phase II Oxford UKR designs, the bearing had two embedded metal marker wires to help assess the position of the bearing on post-operative radiographs. This has been replaced by <b>marker</b> <b>balls</b> in the current, phase III, design. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to examine whether there may be a mechanical cause for the characteristic pattern of fracture observed. Patients & Methods A simplied parametric model of a phase I bearing was created, in which the marker wire position could be varied or replaced with <b>marker</b> <b>balls.</b> Finite element analyses (FEA) were performed explicitly (ABAQUS, Simulia), a symmetric quarter model was examined. The load applied was 2. 4 kN and was applied in one loading-unloading step sinusoidally over 1 second. A J 2 plasticity model was used for the UHMWPE, the marker wires were modelled as linear elastic titanium and the femoral and tibial surfaces as rigid bodies. Results In models where the marker wire was near to the centre of the bearing, a line of tensile stresses were observed in the same pattern as the fractures. A reduction in the tensile stress was found when the marker wires were replaced by <b>marker</b> <b>balls.</b> Discussion/Conclusion These results indicate that the position and presence of the marker wire may be the cause of the typical fracture pattern observed in the fractured bearings. In the phase III component design, the posterior marker wires were replaced by two <b>marker</b> <b>balls,</b> after this a reduced incidence of bearing fracture was observed. Changing the marker wire to <b>marker</b> <b>balls</b> in the polyethylene bearing signicantly reduces the tensile stresses within the bearing, thereby reducing the fracture risk.

It will be ideal to build a CT-MRI combined model to take advantage of complementary information of each modality. This study evaluated the accuracy of the combined femoral model in terms of anatomical inspection. Methods Six normal porcine femora (180 ± 10 days, 3 lefts and 3 rights) with <b>ball</b> <b>markers</b> were scanned by CT and MRI. The 3 D/ 3 D registration was performed by two methods, i. e. the landmark-based 3 points-to- 3 points and the surface matching using the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm. The matching accuracy of the combined model was evaluated with statistical global deviation and locally measure anatomical contour-based deviation. Statistical analysis to assess any significant difference between accuracies of those two methods was performed using univariate repeated measures ANOVA with the Turkey post hoc test. Results This study revealed that the local 2 D contour-based measurement of matching deviation was 0. 5 ± 0. 3 mm in the femoral condyle, and in the middle femoral shaft. The global 3 D contour matching deviation of the landmark-based matching was 1. 1 ± 0. 3 mm, but local 2 D contour deviation through anatomical inspection was much larger as much as 3. 0 ± 1. 8 mm. Conclusion Even with human-factor derived errors accumulated from segmentation of MRI images, and limited image quality, the matching accuracy of CT-&-MRI combined 3 D models was 0. 5 ± 0. 3 mm in terms of local anatomical inspection. </p...|$|R
40|$|Cases of {{fractured}} mobile unicompartmental knee bearings {{have recently}} been reported. The {{purpose of this study}} was to understand the mechanics behind these fractures and to examine the influence of different design modifications. A parametric finite element model was used to examine the influence of different geometrical factors on the stresses within the bearing. Crack initiation occurred clinically in the centre of the bearing; this correlated with the position of the maximum von Mises stress. Tensile stresses, thought to propagate the fatigue crack, were maximal at the medial-lateral sides of the bearing, and the tensile vectors were normal to the fracture direction observed clinically. Fully congruent femoral articulation on the bearing, use of a thicker bearing size, and minimising wear of the component reduced the risk of fracture. For example, an unworn 6. 5 -mm-thick bearing (no clinical fractures reported) had 21. 6 % lower medial-lateral tensile stress compared to an unworn 3. 5 mm bearing (five clinical fractures reported). In turn, an unworn 3. 5 mm bearing had 34. 3 % lower tensile stress compared to a 3. 5 mm bearing after 1. 9 mm wear (average linear wear reported for clinically fractured bearings). The fracture risk was also reduced when the radio-opaque marker wire was positioned further from the centre of the bearing, and when <b>marker</b> <b>balls</b> were used instead of marker wires (19 % reduction in tensile stress in some regions). These results indicate the importance of minimising component wear; the data also support the current component design which uses posterior <b>marker</b> <b>balls</b> instead of <b>marker</b> wires, and the continuing use of a congruous femoral component...|$|R

Recently, the Dolphin Workstation Imaging System introduced to the dental profession a non-radiographic system, called the DigiGraph Workstation which may be an alternative to cephalometric radiography. The aims of this study were to compare the validity and reproducibility of cephalometric measurements obtained from the DigiGraph Workstation with conventional cephalometric radiographs. The sample consisted of 30 human dry skulls. Two replicated sets of lateral cephalograms were obtained with steel <b>ball</b> <b>markers</b> placed at the majority of the cephalometric landmarks. Duplicate tracings prepared from each radiograph were digitized to obtain cephalometric measurements using the computer software, Dentofacial Planner. For the DigiGraph Workstation, double sonic digitizations were repeated twice for each skull, on two occasions. Fifteen angular and one linear measurements were obtained from both methods and these findings compared using ANOVA, paired t-tests and F-tests. All, except one, cephalometric measurement showed {{significant differences between the two}} methods (P < 0. 0001). The DigiGraph Workstation consistently produced higher values in 11 measurements (mean differences + 0. 5 to + 15. 7 degrees or mm) and lower values in four measurements (mean differences - 0. 2 to - 3. 5 degrees). The standard deviations of the differences between readings of both methods were large (0. 4 - 5. 8 degrees or mm). The reproducibility of the DigiGraph Workstation measurements was lower than that of the radiographic measurements. The method error of the DigiGraph Workstation ranged from 7 to 70 per cent, while that of radiographic tracings was less than 2 per cent.

Previous studies have {{attempted}} to use this technique to analyse anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) graft constructs, and more recently, the movement of soft tissue as a precursor to RSA follow up of rotator cuff repairs. These methods were either prone to large amounts of marker migration, deemed unsuitable for in vivo use or, where alternative markers such as stainless steel sutures were used, lost the inherent accuracy that makes RSA an attractive tool in the first place.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: A {{small number}} of unicompartmental knee bearing {{fractures}} have been observed after several years in vivo (mean 17 y). The design of the bearing has a fully congruent spherical surface on the femoral side and a flat fully congruent surface on the tibial side. The fractured bearings all showed signs of wear and impingement, indicating poor surgical technique [1]. In early designs, the bearing had two embedded metal marker wires to help assess {{the position of the}} bearing on post-operative radiographs; the posterior wire has now been replaced by two balls. OBJECTIVES: To assess the influence of the radio-opaque marker wire position on the tensile stresses within the bearing and examine whether the replacement of the <b>marker</b> wire with <b>balls</b> reduced the stresses. METHODS: A simplified parametric model of a Phase I bearing was created in which the marker wire position could be varied or replaced with <b>marker</b> <b>balls.</b> Finite element analyses (FEA) were performed explicitly (ABAQUS, Simulia). The loading used for the model represented a worst-case scenario, and used a maximum load of 2400 N, based upon an 82 kg patient during walking (3 x body weight). The femoral component was modelled as a rigid body and the a non-linear J 2 - plasticity model was used the represent the material behaviour of the bearing. RESULTS: The FEA models demonstrated high tensile stresses transversely across the bearing when posterior marker wire was included; these stresses increased the closer the wire was to the centre and reduced significantly when replaced with <b>marker</b> <b>balls.</b> The contact pressure on the spherical surface has both horizontal as well as vertical components; these, in combination with the position and presence of the marker wire, may lead to the tensile stresses and the typical fracture pattern observed in the fractured bearings.

It is fast enough to be easily combined with another real-time tracking engine. In contrast to popular tracking techniques based on recognition of planar fiducial markers it offers robustness to partial occlusion, which eases handling and manipulation. Furthermore, while using <b>balls</b> as <b>markers</b> a proper haptic feedback and visual metaphor is provided. The exemplary use of our technique {{in the context of}} two AR applications indicates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

25|$|During the play-the-ball it is {{customary}} for {{a player}} from the defending team to stand {{directly in front of}} the player playing the <b>ball,</b> called the <b>marker.</b> If no marker is present, the tackled player may tap the ball on his boot to start the next play, instead of the normally required play-the-ball. As the tap is faster to perform than the play-the-ball, giving great advantage to the attack, there is almost always a marker. Usually the person who tackled the player becomes a marker because he is the closest to the tackled player. There may be a maximum of two markers for each play-the-ball, the second standing behind the first.|$|R
