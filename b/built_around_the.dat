5|$|Because Exmoor was a royal forest, i.e. {{a hunting}} reserve, it was {{unpopulated}} in Medieval times. The first {{house on the}} moor was only built at Simonsbath in 1654. It {{was not until the}} 19th century that farms were <b>built</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> moor.|$|E
5|$|By 1241, the Gran Castello or Cittadella on Gozo was {{definitely}} fortified, although a settlement {{on the hill}} had existed since the Bronze Age. The city's fortifications were improved over the years, and the northern walls {{of the city that}} still stand today were <b>built</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> 15th century by the Crown of Aragon.|$|E

5|$|In 2004, {{authorities}} found a 53-year-old {{man and his}} 12-year-old daughter {{living in}} the park in a tarp-covered structure stocked with encyclopedias for homeschooling. They told police they {{had been living in}} the park for four years. My Abandonment, a novel by Peter Rock, tells a story <b>built</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> incident.|$|E
5|$|Llyweyln married {{another of}} his daughters, Margaret, to Reginald's nephew, John de Braose, and in 1220 Llyweyln gave him Gower and Loughor Castle, which John appears to have set about repairing. As part of this work, a stone curtain wall was <b>built</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> castle. This {{included}} a sally port {{on the north side}} of the castle.|$|E
5|$|The castle was redeveloped in {{the second}} half of the 16th century, {{probably}} by the Praters: the windows were enlarged to let in more light; a grand staircase was built in one of the towers; a Catholic altar was installed, and a revetment, or terrace, was <b>built</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> inside of the moat, leaving it 25 feet (7.6 m) wide.|$|E
50|$|Kessel {{lies between}} two rivers: the Kleine Nete {{in the north}} and the Grote Nete in the south. It borders with Emblem, Nijlen, Bevel, Berlaar and Lier. Although Kessel is a fairly small town, it has 2 {{separate}} town centres, Kessel-Dorp, which is <b>built</b> up <b>around</b> <b>the</b> town square, and Kessel-station, which is <b>built</b> up <b>around</b> <b>the</b> train station.|$|R
50|$|Beauchief abbey {{farm was}} <b>built</b> <b>around</b> 1700. <b>The</b> farm, {{as well as}} its pond, fed the monks.|$|R

5|$|The new fort {{was quite}} small by eighteenth century standards, {{and it was}} more similar to a large redoubt than a fort. Despite this, its design was {{considered}} to be revolutionary, since {{it was one of the}} earliest polygonal forts to be <b>built</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> world. Fort Tigné was also the last major fortification built by the Order of Saint John.|$|E
5|$|A {{new line}} to Rodeløkka was opened on 3 January 1955. The bus {{operation}} {{had been more}} expensive than the tram, and a double track line was built from Carl Berners plass through Dælenenggata to Rodeløkka. The balloon loop was <b>built</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> block of Dælenengata, Fagerheimgata, Marstrandgata and Københavngata. The line was connected to the old Rodeløkka Line with a triangular loop in Københavngata. On 23 April 1961, all traffic on the Rodeløkka Line was terminated. The tracks were removed between 1962 and 1964.|$|E
5|$|A {{wall was}} <b>built</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> monastery in 1803 and, {{fourteen}} years later, the Church of Surb Khach (Holy Cross) was completely renovated and {{converted into a}} depository of manuscripts by archbishop Galust. In 1832, Tamur pasha of Van robbed the monastery's treasures and strangled the father Mktrich vardapet Gaghatatsi to death. In 1849, Gabriel vardapet Shiroyan restored the Church of Sion, which had been destroyed by an earthquake, and converted it into a wheat warehouse.|$|E

5|$|As bishop, Burnell had a wall <b>built</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> cathedral at Wells, {{which helped}} {{to improve the}} {{security}} of the cathedral and its outlying buildings. He left the court each year at Lent, when he returned to his diocese and attended to its affairs. Peckham appointed Burnell to be his deputy when the archbishop went to Wales in 1282. It was probably Burnell who suggested a compromise in 1285 over the jurisdictions of the royal and ecclesiastical courts, which allowed royal officials to return cases involving only religious matters to the church courts.|$|E
5|$|Before long, it {{was noted}} that there were {{discrepancies}} between Audisio's original story published in L'Unità, subsequent versions that he provided and the versions of events provided by others. Although his account most probably is <b>built</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> facts, it was certainly embellished. The discrepancies and obvious exaggerations, coupled with the belief that the Communist Party had selected him to claim responsibility for their own political purposes, led some in Italy to believe that his story was wholly or largely untrue.|$|E
5|$|Charles R. Forbes, the {{energetic}} {{director of the}} Veterans' Bureau, sought to consolidate control of veterans' hospitals and their construction in his bureau. At the start of Harding's presidency, this power was vested in the Treasury Department. The politically-powerful American Legion backed Forbes and denigrated those who opposed him, like Secretary Mellon, and in April 1922, Harding agreed to transfer control to the Veterans' Bureau. Forbes' main task was to ensure that new hospitals were <b>built</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> country to help the 300,000 wounded World War I veterans.|$|E

5|$|During mid- to late-1943 the Home Fleet, the Royal Navy's main {{striking}} force {{stationed in the}} United Kingdom, was augmented by two forces of United States Navy warships to replace British ships dispatched to the Mediterranean and Pacific. These reinforcements were considered necessary {{to ensure that the}} fleet remained able to counter the German battle group based in Norway, which was <b>built</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> battleships Tirpitz and Scharnhorst, and the heavy cruiser Lützow.|$|E
5|$|Fort Tanjong Katong was {{designed}} and built in 1879 by Henry Edward McCallum, who was the Colonial Engineer and Architect of the Singapore History Museum on Stamford Road. The fort reflected the British concerns that other European powers such as the Netherlands and Russia, might attack the strategically located colony founded by Sir Stamford Raffles of the British East India Company in 1819. On the island of Sentosa, Fort Siloso, Fort Connaught and Fort Serapong were <b>built</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> same time as Fort Tanjong Katong, to guard the western and eastern entrances to the New Harbour (now Keppel Harbour).|$|E
5|$|Fulfordgate did not {{initially}} have any covered stands, and the dressing rooms consisted {{of an old}} army hut, before open stands were bought from York Race Committee. The ground was gradually built up and improved, and covered accommodation was available after two years. In 1927, new turnstiles were installed and stronger fencing was <b>built</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> pitch, which {{made it more difficult}} for spectators to surmount it and access the pitch. Nine-tier terracing replaced the old banking behind one of the goals, the covered Popular Stand was extended to hold 1,000 supporters and there a small seated stand was erected.|$|E
50|$|The chancel and nave were <b>built</b> <b>around</b> 1300. <b>The</b> {{two stage}} west tower, with its battlemented parapet, was added around 1400.|$|R
50|$|Other listed {{buildings}} in North Elmsall include The Old Hall, {{thought to be}} <b>built</b> in <b>around</b> <b>the</b> 17th century or earlier and Lodge Farmhouse, <b>built</b> <b>around</b> 1800, and its nearby coach house and barn.|$|R
50|$|The Village of Farnham was {{incorporated}} in 1892, having been <b>built</b> up <b>around</b> <b>the</b> Lake Shore Railroad.|$|R
5|$|In the {{following}} years, more towers were <b>built</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> islands. The first group, the Wignacourt towers, were built between 1610 and 1620. Six {{of these were}} built, and they were more than just watchtowers as they formed significant strongpoints intended to protect vulnerable sections of the coast from attack. Of the six towers, one collapsed in around 1715 and another was demolished in 1888. The other four towers survive to this day.|$|E
5|$|Mount Bailey {{heads the}} Mount Bailey chain, which {{consists}} of the mountain and smaller cinder cones trending north. Similarly to its neighbor Mount Thielsen, it is a shield volcano with precipitous summit slopes, and the two are almost equal in appearance. <b>Built</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> same time as Rodley Butte, according to morphological study, the current volcano {{is no more than}} 100,000 years old, and formed relatively close to Diamond Peak's current cone. Despite its similarity to Rodley Butte, both in age and original composition, Bailey switched from erupting basaltic andesite to pure andesite (silicon dioxide).|$|E
5|$|Norman {{government}} under William {{was similar to}} the government that had existed under earlier dukes. It was a fairly simple administrative system, <b>built</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> ducal household, which consisted of a group of officers including stewards, butlers, and marshalls. The duke travelled constantly around the duchy, confirming charters and collecting revenues. Most of the income came from the ducal lands, as well as from tolls and a few taxes. This income was collected by the chamber, one of the household departments.|$|E
