40|$|The severe fouling {{common in}} food {{processing}} puts high demands on equipment cleaning. Adsorption of the protein <b>betalactoglobulin</b> to solid surfaces and its subsequent removal were followed using in situ ellipsometry. Most experiments {{were done in}} a stirred cuvette. Additionally, a flow cell was designed, which was employed in some work. The characteristics of the surface were shown to influence protein adsorption and removal. While differences between chromium oxide and stainless steel were small, methylated silica showed significantly different adsorption, desorption during rinsing and cleanability. Near the <b>betalactoglobulin</b> denaturation temperature, rapid multilayer build-up was observed, {{and the importance of}} the bare surface properties appeared to decrease. On metal oxides, a lag phase preceded the build-up, while on methylated silica an initial phase of slower adsorption was seen. Prolonged adsorption times gave less desorption during rinsing from metal oxides. For methylated silica, increasing the <b>betalactoglobulin</b> residence time on the surface led to lower removal by the anionic surfactant SDS. Increasing the NaOH concentration gave enhanced cleaning rates and better cleanability of the stainless steel. Combining SDS with NaOH resulted in improved cleaning compared to if using the individual components. Adsorption and removal at high temperature resulted in lower cleanability compared to at room temperature, due to heat-induced alterations in the protein. No correlation was found between the bulk composition or the surface finish of the stainless steel and the fouling tendency or the cleanability. Differences in NaOH-induced protein removal were striking between surfaces subjected to different pretreatments. Passivated surfaces were less cleanable than surfaces pretreated with strong alkali or plasma-cleaned. After repeated fouling and cleaning without renewed pretreatment, differences decreased. While the cleanability of alkali-precleaned surfaces decreased when reused, changes for passivated surfaces were smaller. The initial <b>betalactoglobulin</b> adsorption in turbulent flow was found to be kinetically controlled. At the laminar flow rate, results indicated effects of both mass transport limitations and adsorption kinetics. No significant influence on rinsing or cleaning was evident, and effects on the amounts adsorbed were small. All NaOH concentrations tested caused significant protein removal, and the performance of the two highest concentrations was comparable...|$|E
40|$|The {{first part}} of {{dissertation}} consists of development of a QSAR model for 229 mutagenic aromatic amines and a QSPR model of partial molar volumes of amino acids. A common procedure for QSAR analysis consist of data selection (generally sets of homologous series of compounds and their corresponding biological activities), tabulation of trial physicochemical or molecular structural descriptors, followed by a multilinear statistical analysis to derive a statistically valid QSAR correlation of the activity data making use of {{a subset of the}} trial descriptors. A final important step is cross-validation to assess the putative predictive (rather than just correlative) capabilities of the derived QSAR model equation. The results of a very successful elementary QSA(/P) R studies using substituent indicator variables, coupled with calculated theoretical parameters for the compounds in the work outlined above are presented. ^ The second part of the dissertation illustrates that <b>betalactoglobulin</b> and human serum albumin {{can be used as a}} vehicle to improve the bioavailability of curcumin and it’s derivatives. Curcumin a major component of Indian spice turmeric (Curcuma longa), possesses diverse anti-inflammatory, antitumour and antioxidant properties. Several studies have confirmed that curcumin can reduce the oxidative/nitrosative stress and there by decrease the neuronal attrition. But the bioavailability of curcumin is poor and has raised several concerns regarding limited clinical impact. The aim of this study was to find molecules similar to curcumin which can assist in decreasing nitrosative stress and possess enhanced bioavailability. Here, we examined the use of beta-lactoglobulin as a vehicle to transport molecules to the gut. Curcumin analogs were searched from Zinc database and 6457 compounds were selected for the study. These compounds were docked to <b>betalactoglobulin</b> using Glide to find the best fit ligands. Our findings indicated four compounds that have better binding to <b>betalactoglobulin</b> and efficient NOx (free radical) scavenging activity. ...|$|E

In the Der p 1 model, the authors documented at the IgG level an epitope specificity that differed between patients with lung cancer (preferential specificity for cryptic epitopes) and healthy control subjects and patients with mite allergy.

40|$|To {{assess whether}} dietary antigens {{play a role}} in {{inflammatory}} bowel disease, 26 monozygotic twin pairs with inflammatory bowel disease and 52 healthy controls were investigated for serum antibodies (IgA, IgG, IgM) against ovalbumin, <b>betalactoglobulin,</b> gliadin, whole yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and yeast cell wall mannan. The twins were made up of five pairs concordant and nine pairs discordant for Crohn's disease, and two pairs concordant and 10 pairs discordant for ulcerative colitis. Two patients with Crohn's disease had a slight increase in disease activity, the others were in clinical remission. Two striking observations were made: first, individuals with ulcerative colitis were indistinguishable from healthy twins, and controls except for the response to gliadin. Both healthy and diseased twins had higher IgA levels to gliadin than controls. Second, twins who had developed Crohn's disease displayed higher antibody titres towards yeast cell wall mannan in particular, but also to whole yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) of all antibody types (IgA, IgG, and IgM). In contrast, the response to gliadin, ovalbumin, and <b>betalactoglobulin</b> did not differ from healthy twins and was even lower than in the controls. The results argue against an increased systemic antigen presentation caused by an impaired mucosal barrier in the inflammatory bowel disease. Rather, they suggest that yeast cell wall material [...] that is, mannan, or some antigen rich in mannose and cross reacting with mannan, may play an aetiological role in Crohn's disease, but not in ulcerative colitis. The increases in IgA and IgM, as well as IgG suggest that local and systemic immune systems are selectively activated by antigen(s) present in the cell wall of baker's yeast...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} {{humoral immunity}} in coeliac disease {{as expressed in}} serum (systemic immunity), and in saliva, jejunal aspirate, and whole gut lavage fluid (mucosal immunity). The aims were to define features of the secretory immune response (IgA and IgM concentrations and antibody values to gliadin and other food proteins measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)) in active disease and remission, and to establish whether secretions obtained by relatively non-invasive techniques (saliva and gut lavage fluid) {{can be used for}} indirect measurements of events in the jejunum. Serum, saliva, and jejunal aspirate from 26 adults with untreated coeliac disease, 22 treated patients, and 28 immunologically normal control subjects were studied, together with intestinal secretions obtained by gut lavage from 15 untreated and 19 treated patients with coeliac disease and 25 control subjects. Jejunal aspirate IgA and IgM and gut lavage fluid IgM concentrations were significantly raised in patients with untreated coeliac disease; the lavage fluid IgM concentration remained higher in patients with treated coeliac disease than in controls. Serum and salivary immunoglobulin concentrations were similar in the three groups. Patients with untreated coeliac disease had higher values of antibodies to gliadin compared with treated patients and control subjects in all body fluids tested; these were predominantly of IgA and IgG classes in serum, and of IgA and IgM classes in jejunal aspirate and gut lavage fluid. Values of salivary IgA antibodies to gliadin were significantly higher in untreated coeliacs, though antibody values were generally low, with a large overlap between coeliac disease patients and control subjects. In treated patients, with proved histological recovery on gluten free diet, serum IgA antigliadin antibody values fell to control values, though serum IgG antigliadin antibody values remained moderately raised. In contrast, there was persistence of secretory antigliadin antibodies in treated patients (particularly IgM antibody) in both jejunal aspirate and gut lavage fluid. Antibody responses to <b>betalactoglobulin</b> and ovalbumin were similar to those for gliadin, including persistence of high intestinal antibody values in patients with treated coeliac disease. There was a positive correlation between antibody values in jejunal aspirate and gut lavage fluid, but not between saliva and jejunal aspirate; thus salivary antibodies do not reflect intestinal humoral immunity...|$|E
40|$|Whey is a {{byproduct}} of cheese, curd and casein manufacture and as {{an excellent source of}} proteins, vitamins, minerals and lactose can be used in wide range of industrial production. If treated as waste material without further processing, it can have negative impact on the environment. Main components of whey are water (93 % of total volume), lactose (70 to 72 % of dry matter), whey protein (8 to 10 % solids), and minerals (12 to 15 % solids). Of the minerals, most abundant are magnesium, phosphorus, calcium, potassium, sodium, zinc, and their salts which are passed to whey from milk. Predominantly represented vitamins are water-soluble vitamins (B 1, B 2, B 12, B 6, and C) from which the vitamins B 2, B 12 and C are bound to the whey proteins. The most abundant whey proteins are <b>betalactoglobulin,</b> alfa lactalbumin, GMP (glycomacropeptide), bovine serum albumin, immunoglobulins, lactoferrin and lactoperoxidase. For each of these proteins have been demonstrated or at least implied, unique functional, nutritional or nutraceutical properties. The aim of the thesis was to compile a literature review focused on the possibility of using whey from the production of cheese and curd as raw materials for the manufacture of various types of beverages and monitoring the effect of the addition of various flavor components and whey proteins on the sensory quality of the drink prepared from fresh sour whey. The hypothesis of this work was that flavored whey drinks made from acid whey supplemented with whey protein have a higher sensory quality score than flavored drinks without the addition of whey protein and that whey drinks flavored with mango flavour are more acceptable by consumers they are able to mask undesirable off-tastes of sour whey better than flavor peaches, cherries and black currants. In all specimens, the effect of 8 different recipes and flavors of peaches, cherries, mango and blackcurrant on the final sensory quality and acceptability to consumers was observed. It was found that the best rated drinks were of cherry and mango flavors. Beverages with the addition of mango juice were able to reliably mask natural off-taste of whey, which supports the hypothesis about the appropriateness of using this flavor. Drinks with peach flavor were evaluated to be of the worst senzory quality. As of the best sensory quality were evaluated drinks flavored with cherry flavor, which reached the best overall evaluation. In all variants of formulas was observed that drinks with added WPC achieved better overall evaluation than similar variations without addition of WPC. Statistically significant results of this finding, however, were observed only in the context of mango flavors...|$|E
40|$|A alergia ao leite de vaca é uma condição, até o momento, sem uma solução satisfatória. Dentre as proteínas do leite, a beta-lactoglobulina é uma das mais alergênicas pelo fato de não ser produzida pelo ser humano e sua pouca digestibilidade, mas pouco se sabe sobre a alergenicidade das proteínas bioprocessadas pela indústria de laticínios como a beta-lactoglobulina polimerizada. O objetivo deste trabalho é estudar imunorreatividade da beta-lactoglobulina polimerizada e compará-la com a beta-lactoglobulina nativa. Utilizou-se a polimerização induzida pela {{transglutaminase}} em presença de cisteína e a polimerização induzida pelo aquecimento. Cinco grupos de pacientes (dois grupos intolerantes e três grupos tolerantes) provenientes de duas clínicas de características distintas foram estudados segundo a apresentação dos sintomas e submetidos a testes cutâneo-alérgicos e a ensaios analíticos para pesquisa de IgE específica contra a beta-lactoglobulina, assim como avaliação da imunorreatividade mediada por células por testes de enfrentamento ex vivo, monitorados por testes de inibição da aderência leucocitária. Foram realizados testes cutâneos pareados com beta-lactoglobulina nativa e polimerizada em 56 adultos com hipersensibilidade problemática ao leite de vaca previamente diagnosticados como intolerantes à lactose. Realizou-se pesquisa de IgE específica contra a beta-lactoglobulina por ImmunoCAP e imunoblote. Um grupo de 20 indivíduos tolerantes ao leite de vaca e com ausência de IgE contra beta-lactoglobulina detectável por ImmunoCAP e testes cutâneo-alérgicos negativos foram selecionados como controle da técnica do imunoblote. Os resultados mostraram que a detecção analítica por imunoblote de anticorpos da classe IgE é significativamente mais sensível quando se utiliza a beta-lactoglobulina polimerizada no imunoensaio do que quando se utiliza o monômero de betalactoglobulina. Os resultados mostraram que a dosagem de IgE por imunoCAP abaixo dos limites de detecção, ou o teste cutâneo-alérgico não reagente, não descartam a possibilidade de hipersensibilidade mediada por IgE como demonstrado pelo imunoblote. Foram realizados testes cutâneos pareados com beta-lactoglobulina nativa e polimerizada em 22 crianças sintomáticas, com diagnóstico de alergia à betalactoglobulina mediada por IgE, confirmado por ImmunoCAP. Um grupo controle pareado de 22 crianças assintomáticas com IgE específica para beta-lactoglobulina não detectável por ImmunoCAP foi estabelecido para comparação da técnica dos testes cutâneo-alérgicos. Os resultados mostraram nos dois grupos que as reações cutâneas para os testes realizados com a beta-lactoglobulina polimerizada foram significantemente menores que as reações dos testes realizados com a beta-lactoglobulina nativa. A imunorreatividade mediada por células contra a beta-lactoglobulina nativa e contra a beta-lactoglobulina polimerizada pela transglutaminase foi estudada em 49 indivíduos atópicos através de testes pareados de enfrentamento antigênico ex vivo monitorado pelo teste de inibição da aderência leucocitária. Os resultados mostraram que a imunorreatividade mediada por células contra a beta-lactoglobulina nativa não é significantemente diferente da observada contra a betalactoglobulina polimerizada pela transglutaminase quando o enfrentamento ex vivo é monitorado pelo teste de inibição da aderência leucocitária. A polimerização é um método promissor para a indução de imunotolerância às proteínas alimentares, uma vez que diminui a imunorreatividade in vivo e não destrói os epítopos alergênicos como demonstrado nos ensaios {{in vitro}} e ex vivo. Cow's milk allergy is a debilitating condition of difficult diagnosis and, until the moment, without a definitive solution {{that can be}} presented to the patient by the medical attendant. Amongst the dozens of proteins of the cow's milk, the beta-lactoglobulin (Bos d 5) is one of most allergenic for {{the fact that it is}} not produced by the human being and because of its hard digestibility. The allergenicity of beta-lactoglobulin in human beings is a subject well studied but little is known about the allergenicity of bioprocessed proteins as the polymerized beta-lactoglobulin. The objective of the present work is to study the immunoreactivity of the polymerized beta-lactoglobulin and to compare it with the immunoreactivity of the native beta-lactoglobulin in patients with and without clinical diagnosis of hypersensitivity/intolerance to cow's milk. It was used thermically induced polymerization and polymerization induced by transglutaminase in presence of cystein. Five groups of patients (two intolerant groups and three tolerant groups) proceeding from two clinics of distinct characteristics had been studied according to presentation of the symptoms and submitted to allergic cutaneous tests and immunoassays for research of specific-IgE against beta-lactoglobulin, as well evaluation of cell-mediated immunoreactivity by challenge tests monitored by Leukocyte Adherence Inhibition Test. Side to side cutaneous tests with native and polymerized beta-lactoglobulin in 56 adults with problematic hypersensitivity to cow's milk previously diagnosed as intolerants to the lactose had been carried through, as well research of specific-IgE against <b>betalactoglobulin</b> by ImmunoCAP and immunoblot. A control group of 20 subjects tolerant to cow's milk people with absence of specific-IgE against beta-lactoglobulin (detectable by ImmunoCAP or by allergic skin tests) had been selected for control of the technique of immunoblot. The results had shown that the analytical detection by immunoblot of specific-IgE is significantly more sensible when the polymerized beta-lactoglobulin is used in the immunoassay instead of the beta-lactoglobulin monomer. The results had shown that the research of specific-IgE by ImmunoCAP below of the detection limits, or the absence of cutaneous reactivity does not discard the possibility of IgE-mediated hypersensitivity as demonstrated by immunoblot. Side to side cutaneous tests with native and polymerized beta-lactoglobulin had been carried through in 22 symptomatic children, with confirmed by ImmunoCAP diagnosis of IgE-mediated allergy to beta-lactoglobulin. A matched control group of 22 asymptomatic children with not detectable specific-IgE for beta-lactoglobulin by ImmunoCAP was established for comparison of the technique of the skin tests. The results had shown that the cutaneous reactions carried through with the polymerized beta-lactoglobulin had been significantly lesser that the reactions of the cutaneous reactions carried through with the native beta-lactoglobulin. The cell-mediated immunoreactivity was studied on 49 atopic subjects by paired ex vivo allergen challenges monitored by the leukocyte adherence inhibition test. The results did not shown significant difference between the immunoreactivity against native versus polymerized beta-lactoglobulin. The polymerization of proteic antigens is a promising study model to be further investigated as a potential tool for the therapeutic induction of immune tolerance to alimentary proteins, because it decreases the in vivo immunoreactivity and does not destroy the allergenic epitopes as demonstrated by the in vitro and ex vivo assays...|$|E
