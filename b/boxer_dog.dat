40|$|Background: <b>Boxer</b> <b>dogs</b> are {{reported}} to be predisposed to arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), but the natural history has not been well characterized and inconsistent diagnostic criteria have been applied to identify affected dogs. Echocardiographic examination findings are unremarkable in many affected <b>Boxer</b> <b>dogs,</b> and in these dogs, 24 -hour ambulatory ECG (Holter) monitoring often is used for diagnostic and prognostic purposes, despite limited information available relating Holter findings to outcome. Hypothesis/Objectives: Boxers with complex ventricular arrhythmias at initial presentation will have shorter survival times. The objective {{was to investigate the}} prognostic value of Holter monitoring in <b>Boxer</b> <b>dogs.</b> Animals: One hundred and twenty-two <b>Boxer</b> <b>dogs</b> seen at 3 university referral hospitals. Methods: Retrospective study. Survival times were obtained for <b>Boxer</b> <b>dogs</b> evaluated by echocardiography and a 24 -hour Holter ECG. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to estimate the median survival time and Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to identify variables independently associated with cardiac mortality. Results: Outcome data were obtained for 122 / 163 dogs meeting the inclusion criteria. Of the 70 dogs that had died, 45 were considered to have suffered cardiac-related deaths. Median survival was significantly longer in dogs with a left ventricular systolic diameter (LVIDs)  &# 8804;  35  mm compared with those with LVIDs &# 62;  35  mm (P &# 60; . 001). Multivariable analysis in dogs with LVIDs &# 8804;  35  mm showed that the presence of ventricular tachycardia, age &# 62; 4. 5  years, and male sex were independent predictors of cardiac mortality.

40|$|Objective: To {{retrospectively}} {{review and}} describe the incidence of complications associated with tibial tuberosity advancement (TTA) surgical procedures {{in a group of}} <b>Boxer</b> <b>dogs</b> (n = 36 stifles) and compare the data with a non-Boxer control population (n = 271 stifles). Methods: Retrospective analysis of medical records to identify all dogs that underwent TTA surgery due to cranial cruciate ligament disease. These records were categorized into two groups: <b>Boxer</b> <b>dogs</b> and non-Boxer dogs (controls – all other breeds). Results: Of the 307 stifles included, 69 complications were reported in 58 joints. The complication rate differed significantly for <b>Boxer</b> <b>dogs</b> (16 / 36 stifles) and non-Boxer dogs (42 / 271 stifles), corresponding to an odds ratio of 5. 8 (confidence interval: 1. 96 – 17. 02; p-value &# 60; 0. 001). <b>Boxer</b> <b>dogs</b> were more likely to undergo revision surgery and to develop multiple complications. The incidence of tibial tuberosity fractures requiring surgical repair (2 / 36 versus 1 / 271) and incisional infections requiring antibiotic treatment (three in each group) was significantly higher in the Boxer group. Clinical significance: <b>Boxer</b> <b>dogs</b> had more major and multiple complications after TTA surgery than the control non-Boxer group; these complications included higher rates of revision surgery, tibial tuberosity fractures requiring stabilization, and infection related complications. The pertinence and value of breed-specific recommendations for cranial cruciate ligament disease appears to be a subject worthy of further investigation...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Historically, histiocytic {{ulcerative}} (HUC) (or granulomatous) colitis of <b>Boxer</b> <b>dogs</b> {{was considered}} an idiopathic immune-mediated disease with a poor prognosis. Recent reports of dramatic responses to enrofloxacin and the discovery of invasive Escherichia coli within the colonic mucosa of affected <b>Boxer</b> <b>dogs</b> support an infectious etiology. HYPOTHESIS: Invasive E. coli is associated with colonic inflammation in <b>Boxer</b> <b>dogs</b> with HUC, and eradication of intramucosal E. coli correlates with clinical and histologic remission. ANIMALS: Seven <b>Boxer</b> <b>dogs</b> with HUC. METHODS: Prospective case series. Colonic biopsies were obtained at initial evaluation in 7 dogs, and in 5 dogs after treatment with enrofloxacin. Biopsies were evaluated by standardized histopathology, and {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH) with probes to eubacteria and E. coli. RESULTS: Intramucosal E. coli was present in colonic biopsies of 7 / 7 Boxers with HUC. Clinical response was noted in all dogs within 2 weeks of enrofloxacin (7 + or - 3. 06 mg/kg q 24 h, for 9. 5 + or - 3. 98 weeks) and was sustained in 6 dogs (median disease-free interval to date of 47 months, range 17 - 62). FISH was negative for E. coli in 4 / 5 dogs after enrofloxacin. E. coli resistant to enrofloxacin were present in the FISH-positive dog that relapsed. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The correlation between clinical remission and the eradication of mucosally invasive E. coli during treatment with enrofloxacin supports the causal involvement of E. coli in the development of HUC in susceptible <b>Boxer</b> <b>dogs.</b> A poor response to enrofloxacin treatment might be due to colonization with enrofloxacin-resistant E. coli...|$|R

50|$|Canine {{degenerative}} myelopathy, {{also known}} as chronic degenerative radiculomyelopathy, is an incurable, progressive disease of the canine spinal cord that is similar in many ways to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Onset is typically {{after the age of}} 7 years and it is seen most frequently in the German shepherd dog, Pembroke Welsh corgi, and <b>boxer</b> <b>dog,</b> though the disorder is strongly associated with a gene mutation in SOD1 that has been found in 43 breeds as of 2008, including the wire fox terrier, Chesapeake Bay retriever, Rhodesian ridgeback, and Cardigan Welsh corgi. Progressive weakness and incoordination of the rear limbs are often the first signs seen in affected dogs, with progression over time to complete paralysis. Myelin is an insulating sheath around neurons in the spinal cord. One proposed cause of degenerative myelopathy is that the immune system attacks this sheath, breaking it down. This results in a loss of communication between nerves in lower body of the animal and the brain.|$|E

50|$|The Bullenbeisser became extinct by {{crossbreeding}} {{rather than}} by a decadence of the breed, as happened with the Old Time Bulldog, for instance. The size of the Bull Biters varied from about 40 to 70 cm by 1850; the smaller lived from what today is Netherlands and Belgium, and the bigger, in Germany. In the late 1870s, German breeders Roberth, Konig, and Hopner used the dog {{to create a new}} breed, today called the Boxer. Some 30 Bullenbeissers were already crossed by the Boxer Kennel Club of Germany at 1900 in with Bulldogs brought from the British Isles. The blood composition was 50/50 at that time, however, the German owners started crossing their dogs with all kinds of Bulldogs and Boxers, which produced an undistinguishable breed after World War II. One reason why such quantity of German blood was used to create the <b>Boxer</b> <b>dog</b> was the wish to eliminate the excessive white colour of the breed, and the necessity of producing thousands of dogs {{for one of the most}} popular breeds in the world.|$|E

He then proceeds to send various animals up to disturb Porky's sleep and makes Porky pay {{a certain amount of}} money to get rid of them, and he slowly tries to increase the fees as each new animal causes problems. It initially starts with a mouse eating celery and disrupting Porky's sleep, the extermination by cat of which is $5. The cat, which refuses to leave the bed, is then eliminated by a <b>boxer</b> <b>dog</b> by fee of $10 which repeatedly box-punches Porky after Daffy sounds a boxing bell. The dog is then evicted by a $26 lion which tries to eat Porky; the lion is eradicated by an elephant for a $72 fee; the elephant engulfs the whole room, which Daffy for $666, is exterminated off by the celery-eating mouse thus causing the whole loop to repeat. Eventually, Porky gets fed up and decides to leave without paying Daffy the initial room fee. In response to Porky's [...] "deadbeat" [...] behavior, Daffy holds Porky's baggage which has blasting powder in it, which Porky deliberately sets off shortly after he starts his car (the exhaust pipe lighting the powder leaking from the briefcase) and Daffy walks inside the motel.

Aiming to evaluate the efficacy of clinical managements on the rate of healing of indolent ulcers, a retrospective study was conducted (1997 - 2008). Results demonstrated that proteinase inhibitors were the most often prescribed medication, and its administration did not interfere on the healing rate, as well as observed in dogs that received 1 % atropine, antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs. Healing was delayed in dogs administered orally with vitamin C, but the healing process was faster on those dogs that went through corneal debridement/cauterization. In conclusion, to know {{the various types of}} treatments seems to be fundamental for the rapid resolution of the disease.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The aim of {{the present}} study was to assess heart rate {{variability}} (HRV) in <b>Boxer</b> <b>dogs</b> affected by arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC). Fourteen <b>Boxer</b> <b>dogs</b> classified as affected and 28 classified as unaffected were included in a prospective case-control study. Dogs underwent 24 -hour ambulatory ECG and were classified as affected (> 1, 000 VPCs/ 24 hours) or unaffected (< 20 VPCs/ 24 hours) by ARVC based on the number of ventricular arrhythmias. HRV was assessed using 24 -h Holter ECG monitoring; the studied parameters were SDNN, SDANN, SDNNIDX, rMSSD and pNN 50. Data were submitted to logarithmic transformation and HRV parameters were compared between groups and correlated according to the disease status, number and severity of ventricular arrhythmias using Student&# 8217;s t test, linear regression and Spearman&# 8217;s test. There was no interaction between the HRV parameters and the number and severity of ventricular arrhythmias. SDNNlog (2. 35 ± 0. 14 vs. 2. 46 ± 0. 12, P= 0. 01), SDNNIDXlog (2. 18 ± 0. 14 vs. 2. 24 ± 0. 10, P= 0. 002) and pNN 50 log (1. 47 ± 0. 19 vs. 1. 64 ± 0. 13, P= 0. 002) were significantly lower in the affected group compared with the unaffected. According to this study, HRV are different in a population of <b>Boxers</b> <b>dogs</b> affected by ARVC compared to a population of unaffected dogs, and these differences are not consequences of low cardiac output caused by ventricular arrhythmias since animals that had higher number and complexity of arrhythmias were not those who had lower values of HRV...|$|R
40|$|O {{principal}} objetivo deste estudo foi propor um padrão normal da monitorização eletrocardiográfica dinâmica em cães das raças Doberman, Boxer e Cocker Spaniel (10 animais de cada raça), possibilitando sua utilização como meio de diagnóstico precoce em cães com cardiomiopatia dilatada. O número de complexos QRS foi maior nos cães Cocker Spaniel. Os batimentos ectópicos ventriculares foram mais freqüentes nos da raça Boxer, entretanto as três raças apresentaram menos de 1 % de batimentos ectópicos supraventriculares em relação ao total de batimentos. As freqüências cardíacas mínima, média e máxima foram mais altas na raça Cocker Spaniel. Essa raça permaneceu em taquicardia (freqüência igual ou superior a 120 bpm) por maior tempo do que as outras duas raças e em bradicardia (freqüência igual ou menor a 50 bpm) por menor tempo, além de apresentar menor quantidade e pausas mais curtas. A variação da freqüência cardíaca demonstrou ser um padrão entre esses animais: na raça Cocker Spaniel, o número de contrações ectópicas isoladas supraventriculares e ventriculares foi inferior a 50 por monitorição de 24 horas; na Boxer, foi inferior a 50 por 24 horas; as assistolias ou pausas maiores do que dois segundos foram freqüentes nas raças Boxer e Doberman e ausentes na Cocker Spaniel; comumente as pausas duraram mais do que três segundos; não se observaram alterações do segmento ST nas três raças. The normal {{pattern for}} dynamic eletrocardiographic monitoring of Doberman, Boxer and Cocker Spaniel dogs, enhancing earlier diagnostic of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) was studied. For this, {{the technique of}} 24 -hour electrocardiographic monitoring was standardized in 10 animals of each referred breeds. QRS complexes were more frequent in Cocker Spaniel than in Doberman and <b>Boxer</b> <b>dogs.</b> Ventricular premature beats were more common in <b>Boxer</b> <b>dogs</b> than {{in the other two}} breeds; however, all of then presented less than 1 % of supraventricular ectopic beats in relation to the total of beatings. Cocker Spaniel dogs manifested the highest minimum, average and maximum heart rates and remained with heart rates equal or greater than 120 bpm longer than Doberman and <b>Boxer</b> <b>dogs</b> otherwise, Cocker Spaniel dogs remained more time than dogs of the other two breeds with heart rate equal or lower than 50 bpm. Cocker Spaniel dogs demonstrated, besides less frequently, shorter pauses than Doberman and <b>Boxer</b> <b>dogs</b> did. It was concluded that: a) clinically normal dogs of the studied breeds showed an evident variation of the heart rate; b) the isolate ectopic supraventricular and ventricular contraction were less than 50 during a 24 -hour period of monitorization; c) in <b>Boxer</b> <b>dogs,</b> the number of isolated ectopic ventricular beats was less than 50 during a period of 24 hours; d) the periods of assistolia or pauses bigger than two seconds were frequent in <b>Boxer</b> and Doberman <b>dogs</b> and absent in Cocker Spaniel dogs; e) these pauses were commonly greater than three seconds; f) alterations of ST segment were not observed in clinically normal dogs of the three breeds studied...|$|R
