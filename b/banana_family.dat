40|$|Whole-genome duplications (WGDs) are {{widespread}} in plants, and three lineage-specific WGDs {{occurred in the}} banana (Musa acuminata) genome. Here, we analysed the impact of WGDs {{on the evolution of}} <b>banana</b> gene <b>families</b> involved in ethylene biosynthesis and signalling, a key pathway for banana fruit ripening. Banana ethylene pathway genes were identified using comparative genomics approaches and their duplication modes and expression profiles were analysed. Seven out of 10 <b>banana</b> ethylene gene <b>families</b> evolved through WGD and four of them (1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylate synthase (ACS), ethylene-insensitive 3 -like (EIL), ethylene- insensitive 3 -binding F-box (EBF) and ethylene response factor (ERF)) were preferentially retained. Banana orthologues of AtEIN 3 and AtEIL 1, two major genes for ethylene signalling in Arabidopsis, were particularly expanded. This expansion was paralleled by that of EBF genes which are responsible for control of EIL protein levels. Gene expression profiles in banana fruits suggested functional redundancy for several MaEBF and MaEIL genes derived from WGD and subfunctionalization for some of them. We propose that EIL and EBF genes were co-retained after WGD in banana to maintain balanced control of EIL protein levels and thus avoid detrimental effects of constitutive ethylene signalling. In the course of evolution, subfunctionalization was favoured to promote finer control of ethylene signalling. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

50|$|When many Council {{members were}} arrested in the late 1960s, <b>Banana</b> and his <b>family</b> fled to the United States and did not return until 1975.

50|$|Musa yunnanensis, {{commonly}} known as either Yunnan banana or wild forest banana, is a recently described plant in the <b>banana</b> and plantain <b>family</b> native to Yunnan in southern China. The type specimen was collected in 2005 in Xishuangbanna (an autonomous prefecture bordering on Indochina), at an elevation c.&thinsp;1,150 meters. Although M. yunnanesis grows in montane tropical forest, it is both shade and frost tolerant, and sensitive to direct sunlight, and so is essentially an understory plant. Individuals typically reach about 5&thinsp;-&thinsp;5.25 meters in height at maturation. Bark on pseudostems is coated in wax that is white with a bluish cast. The upper surface of the leaves are also bluish, though their undersides are red hued.|$|R
50|$|Trade {{disputes}} and attendant job fears have sometimes strained the special relationship. The United States {{has been accused}} of pursuing an aggressive trade policy, using or ignoring WTO rules; the aspects of this causing most difficulty to the United Kingdom have been a successful challenge to the protection of small <b>family</b> <b>banana</b> farmers in the West Indies from large US corporations such as the American Financial Group, and high tariffs on British steel products. In 2002, Blair denounced Bush's imposition of tariffs on steel as 'unacceptable, unjustified and wrong', but although Britain's biggest steelmaker, Corus, called for protection from dumping by developing nations, the Confederation of British Industry urged the government not to start a 'tit-for-tat'.|$|R
5000|$|Education in Dominica is {{compulsory}} {{from ages}} 5 to 16.

Primary school attendance rates were unavailable for Dominica as of 2001. Poor physical conditions in many primary schools {{affect the quality of}} education, while some schools are overcrowded, limiting access to primary education, particularly for children living in urban areas around the capital. Poverty and work on <b>family</b> <b>banana</b> farms during the harvest season can affect school attendance, but other employment does not pull minors out of school.

50|$|Ravenala is a genus of {{flowering}} plants {{with a single}} species, Ravenala madagascariensis, commonly known as traveller's tree or traveller's palm, from Madagascar.

The genus is closely related to the southern African genus Strelitzia and the South American genus Phenakospermum. Some older classifications include these genera in the <b>banana</b> <b>family</b> (Musaceae). Although it is usually considered to be a single species, four different forms have been distinguished.|$|E
40|$|A bar-and-joint {{framework}} is a finite {{set of points}} to-gether with specified distances between selected pairs. In rigidity theory we seek to understand when the re-maining pairwise distances are also fixed. If there exists a pair of points which move relative to one another while maintaining the given distance constraints, the frame-work is flexible; otherwise, it is rigid. Counting conditions due to Maxwell give a neces-sary combinatorial criterion for generic minimal bar-and-joint rigidity in all dimensions. Laman showed that these conditions are also sufficient for frameworks in R 2. However, the flexible “double banana ” shows that Maxwell’s conditions are not sufficient to guaran-tee rigidity in R 3. We present a generalization of the double <b>banana</b> to a <b>family</b> of hyperbananas. In dimen-sions 3 and higher, these are (infinitesimally) flexible, providing counterexamples to the natural generalization of Laman’s theorem. ...|$|R
40|$|The homedodomain zipper family (HD-ZIP) of {{transcription}} {{factors is}} present only in plants and plays {{important role in}} the regulation of plant-specific processes. The subfamily IV of HDZ transcription factors (HD-ZIP IV) has primarily been implicated in the regulation of epidermal structure development. Though this gene family is present in all lineages of land plants, members of this gene family have not been identified in banana, {{which is one of the}} major staple fruit crops. In the present work, we identified 21 HDZIV genes in banana by the computational analysis of banana genome resource. Our analysis suggested that these genes putatively encode proteins having all the characteristic domains of HDZIV transcription factors. The phylogenetic analysis of the <b>banana</b> HDZIV <b>family</b> genes further confirmed that after separation from a common ancestor, the banana and poales lineages might have followed distinct evolutionary paths. Further, we conclude that segmental duplication played a major role in the evolution of banana HDZIV genes. All the identified banana HDZIV genes expresses in different banana tissue, however at varying levels. The transcript levels of some of the banana HDZIV genes were also detected in banana fruit pulp, suggesting their putative role in fruit attributes. A large number of genes of this family showed modulated expression under drought and salinity stress. Taken together, the present work lays a foundation for elucidation of functional aspects of the banana HDZIV genes and for their possible use in the banana improvement programs...|$|R

During his early childhood his parents were a part of the Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement, a German splinter group that broke away from the Seventh-day Adventist Church in the World War I era over military service and conscription. They rejoined the mainstream church when he was 10. According to Schwarz, this background gave him a disposition that was skeptical towards church leadership; although this assertion was removed when Floyd Greenleaf revised Schwarz' work. [...] As a youth he ran a large <b>family</b> <b>banana</b> plantation (near the location of what would become the tropical fruit theme park), and later sugar cane and banana plantations deep in the Queensland jungle. He spent his personal time doing study and research into theology.|$|R
