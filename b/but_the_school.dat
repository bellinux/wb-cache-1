5|$|Demand {{for tickets}} by Alabama fans {{was so great}} that the Alabama ticket office accidentally {{oversold}} its allotment of tickets. The office neglected to limit purchases on the forms sent to season-ticket holders, and the office received more than 25,000 orders for its 12,500-ticket allotment. An additional 2,000 tickets were given to Alabama, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>school</b> still had to send out more than 10,000 refunds. Alabama's athletics director was heavily criticized for overselling the ticket allotment and for limiting ticket distribution to fans who had contributed large amounts of money to the athletics department. A group of fans disgruntled at the ticket distribution process eventually levied a class-action lawsuit against the athletic director, claiming contract violations.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{the school}} settled in England in 1794 and the Society of Jesus was officially re-established in Britain in 1803. Stonyhurst {{remained}} {{the headquarters of}} the English Province until the middle of the century; by 1851, a third of the Province's Jesuits were based there. Until the 1920s, Jesuit priests were trained on site in what is today the preparatory school. There was a drop in vocations after World War I and the seminary was closed. The number of Jesuits teaching at Stonyhurst fell to a third of the staff within a decade. Since then, the Jesuit presence has been in decline, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>school</b> continues to place Catholicism and Jesuit philosophy at its core under the guidance of a Jesuit-led chaplaincy team and the involvement of the Jesuits in its governance.|$|E

25|$|On March 15, 1920, {{the first}} day of the blizzard, the school {{dismissed}} its students early to enable them to go home before the storm arrived. Many of the students, like the Miner children, were used to driving to and from school with a horse and buggy, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>school</b> teacher had a rule that no child was permitted to drive home in bad weather without permission from a parent. William Miner, who was worried about the blizzard conditions, rode the two miles to the school on a saddle horse to escort his children home.|$|E

25|$|The PC {{campaign}} was formally launched on September 3.
