5|$|Although {{setting the}} state budget is a {{legislative}} function in many states, Kentucky governors are required by statute to present a proposed biennial budget to the General Assembly for approval shortly after the beginning of its even-year sessions. The governor's budget has often been approved with few changes, but since the Republicans {{took control of the}} state senate {{for the first time in}} 1999, approval has become a much more contentious process. The General Assembly failed to pass a budget before the end of its session in both 2002 and 2004. In both cases, the state operated under an executive spending plan drafted by the governor until the legislature could re-convene and pass a budget. In 2005 the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled that the governor had no authority to expend funds without legislative approval, and that if legislators failed to pass a <b>budget</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> future, only expenditures explicitly authorized in the state constitution could be made.|$|E
5|$|Leopold viewed {{a strong}} {{military}} {{as the key}} to maintaining Belgian independence against France and, after the Franco-Prussian War, an expansionist Germany. After cutting the defense <b>budget</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1860s, the government was advised by a military commission to increase the size of the army and to abolish the system of Remplacement, whereby rich Belgians selected for military service by lot could pay for a substitute to take their place. Leopold II personally lobbied successive governments to implement the findings of the report and institute a fundamental reform of the army. Reform was opposed by both the Liberal and Catholic Parties, which viewed the army with suspicion and Remplacement as a key civil right. In a move supported only by the socialists, Remplacement was abolished in 1909. This was the last legal document signed before Leopold's death. Under the new system, one son per family would be liable for military service regardless of social class but the total size of the military remained the same.|$|E
5|$|On 13 August 2012, Fuller {{signed for}} League Two side Barnet on a free transfer, along with Gillingham team-mate Curtis Weston.

Barnet started the 2012–13 season poorly, failing to win any of their first 12 league matches and were ultimately relegated to the Conference on goal difference after finishing in 23rd place. Barnet's relegation required manager Edgar Davids to release a number of players as an austerity measure to accommodate the fact that the club would be operating on a smaller wage <b>budget</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2013–14 season, and it was announced on 22 May 2013 that Fuller would be released along with 12 other players.|$|E

5|$|Two decades later, Phoenix was {{the subject}} of discussions about the city <b>budget.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> late 1970s, the fireboat's annual {{operating}} expenses were about $1.2million. Mayor George Moscone met with the San Francisco Port Commission in 1977 to determine whether Phoenix would be refurbished, replaced, or scrapped with no replacement. An improvement bond was passed in November 1977 to build a new fireboat. Local naval architects Morris Guralnick Associates submitted a design in 1980 to replace Phoenix, but the estimated construction costs far exceeded the bond. Instead, Mayor Dianne Feinstein redirected the funds to refurbish Phoenix in 1981–1982.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Olympic Committee (AOC, {{formerly}} the Australian Olympic Federation) is the peak body responsible for Australia's participation at the Olympics. Aside from funding the participation at the Olympics, the AOC provides {{money for the}} training and preparation of athletes. This occurs through their funding of the OWIA, grants for athletes to travel overseas to compete {{and the provision of}} monetary awards to athletes and their coaches if they win medals at World Cup events or World Championships in the lead up to the Olympics. The funding of the OWIA by the AOC varies by year, but hovers between AUD500,000 and 1,000,000, with a higher <b>budget</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> years immediately before an Olympics. Through the Australian Sports Commission, the federal government also sponsors OWIA, contributing {{more than half a million}} dollars a year. In 2009, the OWIA lobbied the government for an increase in its annual budget from AUD2.1m to AUD29.4m, a fraction of the AUD132m spent by Canada—the host of the 2010 Olympics. In contrast, the current funding for the Summer Olympics team is AUD128m per annum and the AOC asked for an increase of AUD108m annually in 2009. Australia aimed to win two medals in 2010, something that was achieved, and which Chesterman touted as justification for further funding to maintain and increase rankings in the face of growing expenditure by other countries.|$|E
5|$|Though Patton had ambitions {{to enact}} {{education}} reform {{early in his}} administration, his financial adviser, James R. Ramsey, convinced him to propose a conservative <b>budget</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first legislative session. The two developed a plan to modernize the state government, making it more efficient. State employees were leery of increased efficiency, believing it was a code word for cutting state jobs. Patton dispelled this notion by promising no involuntary layoffs. Patton also anticipated difficulty persuading legislators to invest an estimated $100million in equipment and processes to realize improved efficiency. However, when economists projected a budget surplus for 1996, Patton agreed to invest half of it in capital projects in exchange for using the other half for measures to improve government efficiency. Patton formed an Office for Technology and made improvements in the compatibility and interoperability of the state's computer systems that were recommended by his son, Chris. Investments of $23.3million yielded a return of $300million in state revenue. By the time Patton's efficiency program was fully implemented, the state was realizing an annual return of 75cents for every dollar initially invested.|$|E
