The polymer is known as Kraton and is used for shoe soles and adhesives. Owing to the microfine structure, the transmission electron microscope or TEM was needed to examine the structure. The butadiene matrix was stained with osmium tetroxide to provide contrast in the image. The material was made by living polymerization so that the blocks are almost monodisperse, so helping to create a very regular microstructure. The molecular weight of the polystyrene blocks in the main picture is 102,000; the inset picture has a molecular weight of 91,000, producing slightly smaller domains. The spacing between domains has been confirmed by small-angle X-ray scattering, a technique which gives information about microstructure.Since most polymers are incompatible with one another, forming a <b>block</b> <b>polymer</b> will usually result in phase separation, and the principle has been widely exploited since {{the introduction of the}} SBS block polymers, especially where one of the block is highly crystalline.

The PDMS-b-PMMA-b-PHFBMA copolymer used in the study contains siloxane and fluorinated segments and belongs to ABC non-amphiphilic triblock copolymers, which proves that the asymmetric ABC non-amphiphilic triblock copolymers can also self-assemble in a dilute solution to serve as a template, or "nanoreactors".

40|$|A {{ruthenium}} meso-tetra[4 -(vinylbenzoxy) benzyl]porphyrin catalyst {{with four}} meso-polymerizable side chains was synthesized in three steps from commercially available starting materials. The polymerizable side chains allowed {{the incorporation of}} this complex in various types of highly cross-linked mesoporous co-polymers. Core-shell microspheres were prepared in a two-step precipitation polymerization procedure. The porous shell contains the Ru-catalyst and divinylbenzene while the dense core is constituted only of divinylbenzene. A <b>block</b> <b>polymer</b> and molecularly imprinted polymers containing the Ru-catalyst were prepared by co-polymerization with ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate. The imprinted polymers were prepared {{in the presence of}} primary amines as templates, which create a free substrate pocket next to the catalytically active center upon removal of the template. All polymers displayed high catalytic activity for the oxidation of alcohols and alkanes to the corresponding ketones with 2, 6 -dichloropyridine-N-oxide as the oxidant. A comparison of the catalytic activity of the Ru-catalyst, the <b>block</b> <b>polymer</b> and the imprinted polymer was made. While the homogeneous Ru-catalyst showed no activity, the <b>block</b> <b>polymer</b> was moderately active and the imprinted polymer displayed the highest activity. The increase of activity of the <b>block</b> <b>polymer</b> compared to the homogeneous Ru-catalyst {{can be explained by the}} site-isolation effect which prevents the irreversible dimerisation of the ruthenium porphyrin catalysts upon oxidation. The further increase of activity displayed by the imprinted polymer can be attributed to the free substrate pocket next to the active site which allows a better access of the substrates to the ruthenium center. With the polymer imprinted with 1 -adamantylamine, a substrate selectivity of 1. 4 in favor of 2 -adamantanol was observed for the oxidation of 2 -adamantanol in competition with 2 -octanol. However, with the other polymer imprinted with aminodiphenylmethane no such selectivity was recorded. It was possible to modulate both the activity and the selectivity of the <b>block</b> <b>polymer</b> using a fluorous solvent, perfluoromethylcyclohexane (PFMC). A large increase of catalytic activity was measured upon use of PFMC as a reaction co-solvent. Some substrate selectivity was also observed for substrates with different polarities.

40|$|Epps, Thomas H. Block {{polymers}} have garnered significant {{attention in}} the past few decades due to their ability to self-assemble into a boundless array of structures such as spheres, cylinders, gyroid, and lamellae. The sizes of the periodical structures typically are ~ 5 â 100 nm, making them ideal for emerging nanotechnologies, such as nanolithography, nanotemplating, nanoporous membranes, and photonics devices. Many of these applications require thin film geometries, in which the block polymers form well-ordered nanostructures and precisely controlled domain orientations. Understanding the factors that affect thin film phase behavior and being able to control the nanostructures, domain orientation, and domain ordering in thin film is essential to realizing the full potential of these unique materials. In this dissertation, I describe significant efforts to manipulate the <b>block</b> <b>polymer</b> thin film structures, direct the nanostructure ordering, and understand the connection between the macromolecular molecular structures and the <b>block</b> <b>polymer</b> properties. First, substrate surface modification with chlorosilane was employed to manipulate the nanostructure of poly(styrene- b-isoprene-b-styrene) (SIS) thin films. A morphological transformation from parallel cylinders to hexagonally perforated lamellae (HPL) was identified, in a high-throughput fashion, using gradient methods. The gradient methods are highly adaptable for the possible universal manipulation of thin film nanostructures. Second, rastering solvent vapor annealing â soft shear method was developed and demonstrated as a simple, yet highly effective method to achieve macroscopic alignment of SIS cylinders. This method substantially improves on previous approaches by using simple instrumentation to unlock an array of alignment patterns with a variety of self-assembling polymers and provides feasibility and flexibility for practical industrial production. Next, the interfacial mixing characteristics of tapered <b>block</b> <b>polymer</b> were explored quantitatively for the first time, and the tapered interfacial modification has led to unique and diverse self-assembly behavior and properties.

The results provide useful insights for the future design and optimization of <b>block</b> <b>polymer</b> structures for high efficiency energy storage devices.
