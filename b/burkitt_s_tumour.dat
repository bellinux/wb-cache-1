40|$|A Masters Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Master of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Who am I? I investigate this question, using graphic inventories and written narratives as autoethnographic method to document social selves. I utilise Ian <b>Burkitt</b> <b>s</b> theoretical discussion of social selves, but draw on my own experiences {{of the home and}} the family to represent and display social individuality as auto ethnography. I suggest that social and historical relationships are not separate from the self and I argue that the self is formed in daily social relations with others, which can be documented through drawing and writing. I use autoethonography to employ a practice that creates works through narrative and inventory. I use a practice-led methodology to frame my use of autoethnography as a method of creating art practice through narratives and inventories The body of the thesis is structured in three sections. Situating Practice (Chapters One- Three, which establish my theoretical parameters) and Inventories and Narratives (Chapters Four-Nine, which record my domestic spaces, such as cupboards, and narrate my family interactions and activities). My social relations are remembered as behaviours, which constitute self-knowledge and are accessed through material culture in objects. In positioning my relations with spaces and objects I refer to artists such as Mark Dion, Michael Landy and Rachel Whiteread. The Findings section of the thesis discusses the application of <b>Burkitt</b> <b>s</b> social selves as a form of art practice. I conclude that written narratives and graphic inventories can change the display of social selves and the practise of creating them; by showing and telling is an attempt to answer the question Who am I?...|$|R

In {{a subset}} of 13 / 20 tumours, telomerase activity was evaluated by the telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP). The CGH data were compared with the CGH results of ten stage 1 and 2 (stage 1 / 2) and 22 stage 3 and 4 (stage 3 / 4) neuroblastomas. A total of 17 / 20 stage 4 s neuroblastomas did not progress clinically, whereas tumour progression with lethal outcome occurred in 3 / 20 cases. The CGH data of clinically non-progressing stage 4 <b>s</b> <b>tumours</b> revealed {{a high rate of}} whole-chromosome aberrations (73. 4 %) with an overrepresentation of mainly chromosomes 2, 6, 7, 12, 13, 17, 18 and an underrepresentation of mainly chromosomes 3, 4, 11, 14. MYCN amplification or 1 p deletion was observed in only 1 / 27 or 2 / 17 clinically non-progressing stage 4 <b>s</b> <b>tumours</b> respectively, whereas all three progressive stage 4 s neuroblastomas showed MYCN amplification, 1 p deletion and, in 2 / 3 cases, distal 17 q gains.

In contrast, 4 <b>s</b> <b>tumours</b> with lethal outcome revealed elevated telomerase activity levels.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:Normal B-cells in the {{germinal}} center (GC) may {{be exposed to}} both tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) and Fas-L. Whether abrogation of TRAIL apoptosis is a feature in the genesis of B cell lymphomas of GC-phenotype is not known. We assessed {{the integrity of the}} TRAIL pathway in Fas-resistant and Fas-sensitive <b>Burkitt</b> <b>s</b> lymphomas (BLs). DESIGN AND METHODS:Expression of TRAIL receptors was determined by flow cytometry and Western blots. The extent of apoptosis following exposure to TRAIL was measured by annexin-V/propidium iodide dual staining. The integrity of the Fas and TRAIL apoptotic pathways was determined by Western blotting to assess cleavage of downstream caspases. Western blot analyses were used to determine the expression of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins and the profile of expression was correlated with response to TRAIL and CH 11. RESULTS:Our results demonstrate that BL expresses both functional and decoy TRAIL receptors. BLs with a functional Fas pathway retained sensitivity to TRAIL: Frequent and compound loss of expression of pro-apoptotic proteins can be identified in BLs resistant to Fas. However, loss of Bax, Bak and Bcl-Xs did not compromise sensitivity to TRAIL: INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS:Our results indicate that BLs frequently retain sensitivity to the TRAIL pathway. These results underscore the utility of TRAIL-based therapeutic strategies in the treatment of those B-cell lymphomas that may have compromised expression of several pro-apoptotic proteins.

We found {{increased levels of}} a spliced FKBP 5 variant in the PBMCs of 124 patients with melanoma. This variant encodes for an unknown isoform (FKBP 51 s). We hypothesized that FKBP 51 <b>s</b> resulted from <b>tumour</b> interaction with immune cells, through PDL- 1 /PD- 1. To address this issue, we performed melanoma/PBMC cocultures. Furthermore, the immunohistochemistry of 76 melanoma specimens served to investigate whether FKBP 51 <b>s</b> stained <b>tumour</b> infiltrating lymphocytes. Our results showed that PBMCs expressed FKBP 51 s when cocultured with melanoma. Tumour PDL- 1 knockdown or anti-PD- 1 reduced FKBP 51 s expression in cocultured PBMCs. IHC showed a strong FKBP 51 <b>s</b> signal in <b>tumour</b> infiltrating lymphocytes, and lymphocytes of the invasion front of the tumour, along with melanoma PDL- 1 expression. When overexpressed in melanoma, FKBP 51 s facilitated PDL- 1 expression on the cell surface.

40|$|In {{order to}} assess the effect of in vitro models on the {{expression}} of key genes known to be implicated in the development or progression of cancer, we quantified by real-time quantitative PCR the expression of 28 key genes in three bladder cancer tissue specimens and in their derived cell lines, studied either as one-dimensional single cell suspensions, two-dimensional monolayers or three-dimensional spheroids. Global analysis of gene expression profiles showed that in vitro models had a dramatic impact upon gene expression. Remarkably, quantitative differences in gene expression of 2 - 63 -fold were observed in 24 out of 28 genes among the cell models. In addition, we observed that the in vitro model which most closely mimicked in vivo mRNA phenotype varied with both the gene and the patient.

40|$|Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a {{ubiquitous}} human herpesvirus {{involved in}} the pathogenesis of {{a wide spectrum of}} malignant and non-malignant diseases. In healthy EBV carriers, the virus is believed to infect two major cellular targets - B lymphocytes and epithelial cells. While EBV latency is established predominantly, if not exclusively, in B-lymphocytes, virus replication can take place both in B cells and epithelial cells. Lytic replication ensures virus transmission to new carriers and replenishes the cellular reservoirs of virus persistence. The generally asymptomatic and harmless persistence of EBV relies on a tightly controlled immune response and distinct modes of virus/cell interactions observed at different stages of EBV life cycle. The aim of this thesis was to characterize the mutual influence of the host immune system and EBV at the replicative stage of virus infection. We showed that EBV enters monocytes and inhibits their differentiation into dendritic cells (DCs) without the need of viral gene expression. The sensitivity of the cells to virus-induced apoptosis progressively decreases along the process of DC maturation and is strongly dependent on the cell type in which the virus replicated before infecting DC precursors, since epithelial-cells derived viruses exhibited a significantly stronger pro-apoptotic activity than their B cell-derived counterparts. The capacity of the virus to suppress DC development might help in delaying the establishment of EBV specific immunity before the pool of infected B cells reaches the size sufficient for long-term virus persistence. During virus replication, both B cells and epithelial cells may escape recognition by cytotoxic CD 8 + T cells through downregulation of MHC class I molecules. Our work demonstrated that MHC class I heavy-chain and beta 2 m mRNA and protein synthesis are inhibited during EBV replication. Several other characteristic changes observed in the MHC class I processing and presentation pathway during the lytic cycle were recapitulated by chemical inhibition of protein synthesis. These results were recently confirmed by others and the viral protein responsible for host-cell global protein synthesis shutdown was shown to be encoded by the BGLF 5 open reading frame of the EBV genome. Triggering of receptors of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily participates both in determining the fate of B-lymphocytes during the process of their differentiation and in immunologic clearance of virus infected targets. Initiation of EBV lytic cycle counteracted sensitization to death induced by TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) that resulted from B-cell receptor (BCR) triggering in <b>Burkitt</b> <b>s</b> lymphoma cells. Differential modulation of death-transmitting and decoy TRAIL receptors was associated with sensitization to TRAIL in response to BCR-triggering or protection from TRAIL by EBV lytic cycle. Interference with TRAIL-mediated checkpoints in B-cell differentiation may account for the involvement of EBV in autoimmune diseases. Decreased sensitivity to TRAIL may also protect EBV infected cells from recognition by CTL and NK-cells. B-cell homeostasis is severely perturbed during malaria infection. We showed that the CIDR 1 á domain of P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP 1), a multiadhesive protein expressed during the erythrocytic phase of the parasite life cycle, binds to B cells and induces EBV replication. This might partly explain the increased EBV viral load during malaria infection and the increased risk of B cell immortalization in the ontogenesis of endemic <b>Burkitt</b> <b>s</b> lymphoma. Results presented in this thesis strengthen the notion that EBV replication actively modulates the functioning of the immune system at different levels through complex interactions of viral products with several types of cells and contributes to immune suppression, autoimmunity and tumorogenesis through a number of mechanisms whose details require further characterization. Research lines defined by this work may lead to new approaches towards management of EBV associated diseases...|$|R
40|$|Observations of non-random {{maternal}} 11 p allele loss in Wilms 2 ̆ 7 tumour (WT) have implied {{the possible}} involvement of an imprinted 11 p locus in WT aetiology. A proposed 11 p 13 Wilms 2 ̆ 7 tumour gene, WT 1, {{has recently been}} isolated and encodes a zinc finger DNA-binding protein, the 32 ̆ 7 untranslated region of which contains a polymorphic dinucleotide repeat (CA repeat) motif. We have exploited this transcribed CA repeat to examine the allelic expression pattern of WT 1 and thereby determine whether transcriptional imprinting of this gene occurs. DNA and reverse-transcribed RNA from tumours and normal tissue were subjected to the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using radiolabelled primers flanking the CA repeat.

Our study examined the role of nimotuzumab and cetuximab both, the two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to EGFR, as radiosensitisers in a murine glioma model in vivo. Co-administration of both the antibodies with radiation increased the radiosensitivity of U 87 MG, resulting in a significant delay of subcutaneous (<b>s.</b> c.) <b>tumour</b> growth. Furthermore, the addition of antibodies to the radiation decreased brain tumour sizes and is inhibited by 40 – 80 % the increased tumour cell invasion provoked by radiotherapy, although promoted tumour cell apoptosis.

These results were encouraging, and showed the superiority of combined treatment of mAbs to EGFR and radiation over each single therapy against glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), confirming the role of these drugs as radiosensitisers in human GBM.

Neuroblastomas, ganglioneuromas and phaeochromocytomas with significant concentrations of NPY-like immunoreactivity were investigated for different molecular forms of NPY and for significance of proNPY processing. Gel-permeation chromatography identified intact NPY (1 – 36) in all tumours, whereas proNPY (69 amino acids) was detected only in control adrenal tissue and malignant neuroblastomas. Purification of NPY-like immunoreactivity in tumour extracts and structural characterization revealed that both NPY (1 – 36) and the truncated form NPY (3 – 36) was present. The degree of processing of proNPY to NPY in tumour tissue was lower in advanced neuroblastomas with regional or metastatic spread (stage 3 and 4) (n = 6), (41 %, 12 – 100 %, median, range), compared to the less aggressive stage 1, 2 and 4 <b>S</b> <b>tumours</b> (n = 12), (93 %; 69 – 100 %), (P = 0. 012). ProNPY processing of less than 50 % was correlated with poor clinical outcome (P = 0. 004). MYCN oncogene amplification was also correlated to a low degree of proNPY processing (P = 0. 025). In summary, a low degree of proNPY processing was correlated to clinical advanced stage and poor outcome in neuroblastomas.

Methods: A total of 69 patients who received only RT in daily 3 Gy were included in this study. Grade 3 RP was defined as an RP event. The cumulative incidence of RP was estimated and the correlations of the development of RP with the potential predictors were determined. Results: The cumulative incidence of events was 17. 1 % at 12 months. By univariate analy-sis, all clinical factors [age, performance status, weight loss, pre-RT forced expiratory volume in 1 <b>s,</b> <b>tumour</b> location, stage, RT dose and clinical target volume] were not associated with the risk of Grade 3 RP; however, all dosimetric factors [V 5 – 50 and mean lung dose (MLD) ] closely correlated with the development of RP. The receiver-operative characteristics (ROC) analysis revealed that MLD was the best predictors of Grade 3 RP (area under curve ROC 0. 937). By multivariate analysis, MLD was the only significant factor to be predictive of RP risk: the probability of Grade 3 RP was 3. 7 % when MLD 16. 1 Gy and 78. 4 % when MLD. 16. 1 Gy.

The results give additional experimental support to the clinical interest in early adjuvant therapy of micrometastases, and sequential combined modality therapy for larger tumours...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} {{experimental}} {{studies have demonstrated}} significant responses of <b>s.</b> c. solid <b>tumours</b> to flavone acetic acid (FAA). Clinical studies to date have been disappointing, with no objective responses being seen. The present study demonstrated that the tumour site {{is important for the}} anti-tumour action of FAA against two transplantable adenocarcinoma lines (MAC) in NMRI mice. Responses were achievable only when the <b>tumours</b> were implanted <b>s.</b> c. Ascitic or systemic tumours did not respond to FAA. Experimentally achievable plasma levels of FAA were not sufficient to induce significant cell kills in either MAC 15 A or MAC 26 cell lines in vitro. A poor correlation exists between in vitro and in vivo responses, as the clonogenic assay could not predict the response of the solid MAC <b>tumours</b> grown <b>s.</b> c. The in vitro data indicated that the length of exposure to FAA was important, with long exposure times being necessary for cytotoxicity to develop, in these tumour cell lines. These studies imply that more than one mechanism is involved, and {{it is likely that the}} activity of FAA against <b>s.</b> c. <b>tumours</b> relies at least in part on a specific biological feature of tumours in this site. However, it may still be possible to achieve systemic tumour cell kill in vivo by increasing drug-exposure times...|$|R

40|$|Human tumours which {{grow and}} {{metastasize}} in immunodeficient animals {{are amenable to}} controlled investigation of human tumour metastasis {{in the presence of}} the original tumour inoculum. In previous reports (Ware et al., 1982, 1984), we described a unique human prostate carcinoma subline, l-LN-PC- 3 -lA, which consistently metastasizes from a subcutaneous (s. c.) site to both regional and distant lymph nodes in tumour-excised adult athymic nude mice. These tumour cells also form multiple lung micrometastases in 30 - 50 % of tumour-excised mice (Ware et al., 1984). We have used this model system to address two basic questions concerning spontaneous metastasis of the human prostate carcinoma subline 1 -LN-PC- 3 -lA growing subcutaneously in adult nude mice: (i) What are the characteristics of metastasis by these cells {{in the presence of the}} original <b>s.</b> c. <b>tumour,</b> and (ii) Is the size of the <b>s.</b> c. <b>tumour</b> a significant determinant of lymphatic metastasis in this experimental system? Male athymic nude mice (nu/nu) (BALB/ cAnBOM), 6 - 8 weeks old, were used in all experiments. Specific pathogen-free mice were obtained from two sources. Groups 1 and 2 were purchased from Harlan-Sprague Dawley (Indianapolis, Indiana). These mice were received from the supplier at the age of 4 - 5 weeks and allowed to acclimatize for 2 more weeks in a barrier facility prior to any experimentation. Groups 3 and 4 were obtained from the breeding colony of athymic nude mice maintained by the Urology Research Laboratories, Duke University Medical Center. All of these mice (groups 1, 2, 3 and 4) were provided with sterile food, water, bedding and cages, and maintained in an isolated barrier facility with strict access limitations. Heterozygous (nu/+) mice were maintained under the same conditions as the experimental animals to act as additional monitors for microbial contamination. No evidence o...|$|R
40|$|N-l-leucyl-doxorubicin and vinblastine-isoleucinate can be {{considered}} as relatively non-toxic prodrugs from doxorubicin and vinblastine, respectively. A comparative analysis was carried out of the anti-tumour activity of the four compounds as well as vintriptol in four human ovarian cancer xenografts different in histology, growth rate and chemosensitivity. Injections were given i. v. weekly twice into mice bearing well-established <b>s.</b> c. <b>tumours.</b> At equitoxic doses, the amount of drug administered for N-l-leucyl-doxorubicin and vinblastine-isoleucinate was respectively 3 -fold and 2 -fold higher than the doses of the parent compound. N-l-leucyl-doxorubicin induced a growth inhibition > 50 % in three out of four human ovarian cancer lines. The anti-tumour effects obtained were significantly better (P 50 %.

40|$|Developing {{non-invasive}} diagnostic {{tools in}} the field of head and neck oncology has been a challenge. Analysis of circulating tumour derivatives in a patient 2 ̆ 7 s blood has been explored in other solid cancers. This includes analysis of circulating tumour DNA, intact circulating tumour cells (CTCs) and exosomes. These circulating tumour derivatives provide avenues of investigation which can be representative of a patient 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> primary <b>tumour</b> signature and can be assessed from a patient 2 ̆ 7 s blood sample. In advanced stage cancer patients, these tumour derivatives are found in higher amounts, attributed to higher cellular turnover (apoptosis, autophagy), lysed CTCs and sloughing from necrotic tumours.

40|$|Summary. -Experiments were {{conducted}} {{to determine whether the}} histological pattern of tumour growth of hormone-responsive MCF- 7 human mammary adenocarcinoma varied in different tissues of athymic mice. Tumours in the uterus following intrauterine injection were rapidly proliferating and highly invasive. Tumours injected intracerebrally were also highly invasive. In contrast, <b>s.</b> c. <b>tumours</b> and those which arose in the lung following intrapleural injection, grew as small localized nodules without evidence of aggressive invasion of surrounding tissues. These findings indicate that selective implantation of human tumours in athymic mice can be used to develop different models of tumour growth and aggressiveness. THERE HAS BEEN a continuing effort to develop new models of clinical neoplasia using human tumours xenografted into athymic mice. Historically, almost all these attempts have involved the subcutaneum as the site of tumour implantation...|$|R
40|$|Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a {{ubiquitous}} γ-herpes virus with dual cell tropism {{for human}} B-lymphocytes and epithelial cells. EBV infection {{is linked to}} several malignancies such as <b>Burkitt</b> <b>s</b> lymphoma (BL) and nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). In vitro EBV is a potent transforming virus that converts resting B-lymphocytes into indefinitely proliferating lymphoblastoid cells (LCLs). The overall {{aim of this study}} was to develop and utilize bioinformatics methods to dissect the molecular mechanisms by which EBV modulates the cellular environment. EBV is a large DNA virus that encodes about 100 open reading frames (ORFs) expressed at various times during infection. Using established sequence search methods such as patterns and hidden Markov models (HMM), we have identified catalytic domains of ubiquitin specific proteases (deubiquitinating enzymes, DUBs) in a limited number of EBV ORFs. The DUB activity of three high scoring candidates: BPLF 1, BSLF 1 and BXLF 1, was confirmed by functional and mutational analysis (Paper-I). EBV establishes distinct programs of viral gene expression in latently infected and malignant cells. The EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA) - 1 is expressed in all EBV carrying proliferating cells. EBNA- 1 has been associated with the induction of cellular oxidative stress due to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and DNA damage. To search for the cellular genes involved in these effects we used gene expression data sets from public databases. By analyzing the expression of genes involved in ROS metabolism in EBV positive and negative Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) cell lines and lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) we found that the NADPH oxidase (NOX) - 2 is induced in cells expressing EBNA- 1. Activation of the NOX 2 gene by EBNA- 1 is associated with the induction and/or maintenance of genomic instability, a critical step in malignant transformation (Paper-II). The expression of EBNA- 1 is associated with a global rearrangement of cellular transcription. To investigate the primary and secondary targets of this transcriptional effect we have analyzed the gene expression profiles of stable and inducible EBNA- 1 expressing cells. Functional analysis of the regulated transcripts revealed that EBNA- 1 influences the expression of genes involved in the maintenance of chromatin architecture. Several subunits of chromatin remodeling complexes were down-regulated on EBNA- 1 expression (Paper-III). Microarray analysis and systems biology approaches were implemented to investigate the cellular pathways modulated by tripeptidyl peptidase II (TPPII) a cellular protein that is highly expressed in BL cells and participates in the induction of the malignant phenotype. Comparison of the gene expression profiles of control and TPPII knockdown BL cells and systems level analysis of differentially regulated genes demonstrated that the MAPK signaling pathway is selectively inactivated by TPPII knockdown (Paper-IV). In summary, this work demonstrated the potential of bioinformatics tools and highthroughput genomic approaches in identifying the novel strategies of EBV...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} human bronchial-carcinoma xenografts (3 small-cell anaplastic, 2 large-cell anaplastic and 3 adenocarcinomas) {{established}} in immune-suppressed mice {{were treated with}} combination chemotherapy based on clinical regimes. Xenograft response was assessed by the in situ endpoint of growth delay in <b>s.</b> c. <b>tumours.</b> Dose-response relationships of 3 triple-drug combinations and their component agents were explored, allowing the relative contributions of single agents in each combination to be assessed. The results demonstrate that the effects produced in the xenografts were generally consistent with clinical experience. Procarbazine, cyclophosphamide and CCNU stood out as the most effective drugs in small cell carcinoma, but were ineffective in the other histological types. These was some evidence for individuality of therapeutic response among the grafts, supporting the case for incorporating panels of histologically similar xenografts into primary drug-screening programmes to complement existing syngeneic rodent tumour systems...|$|R
