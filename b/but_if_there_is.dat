5|$|Typically, {{if there}} is little wind shear, the storm will rapidly enter the dissipating stage and 'rain itself out', <b>but,</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> {{sufficient}} change in wind speed and/or direction, the downdraft will {{be separated from the}} updraft, and the storm may become a supercell, where the mature stage can sustain itself for several hours.|$|E

25|$|An {{alternative}} {{or perhaps}} complementary proposal {{is that the}} right anterior insular regulates {{the interaction between the}} salience of the selective attention created to achieve a task (the dorsal attention system) and the salience of arousal created to keep focused upon the relevant part of the environment (ventral attention system). This regulation of salience might be particularly important during challenging tasks where attention might fatigue and so cause careless mistakes <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> too much arousal it risks creating poor performance by turning into anxiety.|$|E
25|$|Ankle weights {{provide a}} large lever arm {{for a small}} amount of weight and are very {{effective}} at correcting head-down trim problems, but the addition of mass to the feet increases the work of propulsion significantly. This may not be noticed on a relaxed dive, where {{there is no need to}} swim far or fast, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> an emergency and the diver needs to swim hard, ankle weights will be a significant handicap, particularly if the diver is marginally fit for the conditions.|$|E

25|$|For {{very high}} temperatures, the {{magnetization}} is zero, {{as it is}} at infinite temperature. To see this, note that if spin A has only a small correlation ε with spin B, and B is only weakly correlated with C, but C is otherwise independent of A, the amount of correlation of A and C goes like ε2. For two spins separated by distance L, the amount of correlation goes as εL <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> more than one path by which the correlations can travel, this amount is enhanced {{by the number of}} paths.|$|E
25|$|The fall of soviet-style {{communism}} in 1989 elated the cultural world, {{but the experience}} hasn't been an easy one due to problems in the transition period and {{the adoption of a}} free market economy. The discontinuation of state and political control of culture brought about the long dreamt freedom of expression, but, at the same time, the state subsidies also stopped and Romania's culture was seriously affected by the side-effects of the incipient, still very imperfect, free market economy and by inadequate material resources. Culture has had to cope with a variety of problems, one of them being a shift in people's interest towards other areas such as the press and television. The search for a new cultural policy, relying on decentralisation, seems to prevail now. People speak about a crisis of culture in this country, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a crisis of culture, it is only at an institutional level.|$|E

25|$|Classically, Fermat's {{principle}} can {{be considered}} as a mathematical consequence of Huygens' principle. Indeed, of all secondary waves (along all possible paths) the waves with the extrema (stationary) paths contribute most due to constructive interference. Suppose that light waves propagate from A to B by all possible routes ABj, unrestricted initially by rules of geometrical or physical optics. The various optical paths ABj will vary by amounts greatly in excess of one wavelength, and so the waves arriving at B will have a large range of phases and will tend to interfere destructively. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a shortest route AB0, and the optical path varies smoothly through it, then a considerable number of neighboring routes close to AB0 will have optical paths differing from AB0 by second-order amounts only and will therefore interfere constructively. Waves along and close to this shortest route will thus dominate and AB0 will be the route along which the light is seen to travel.|$|E
500|$|In comparison, {{there was}} more active {{judicial}} engagement with international law in Nguyen Tuong Van v. Public Prosecutor (2005), {{as opposed to the}} decisive disapproval in Chan Hiang Leng Colin. In Nguyen Tuong Van, the Court of Appeal commented that a [...] "clearly and firmly established" [...] rule of customary international law can be adopted by the courts, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a conflict between such a rule and a domestic statute, the latter takes precedence. The Court analysed whether there was an established international norm against execution by hanging before deciding if should be applied in Singapore, revealing a more open-minded approach to international law.|$|E
500|$|The {{bombing was}} {{condemned}} by British Prime Minister John Major and his government, by the opposition, and by {{individual members of}} parliament (MPs) as a [...] "sickening", [...] "callous" [...] and [...] "barbaric" [...] terrorist attack. Early on, Major stated that, [...] "This explosion looks like {{the work of the}} IRA. It is the work of a few fanatics and... causes absolute revulsion in Ireland as it does here". Sinn Féin was criticised by Taoiseach John Bruton for being [...] "struck mute" [...] on the attack in the immediate aftermath. Bruton described the bombing as [...] "a {{slap in the face to}} people who've been trying, against perhaps their better instincts, to give Sinn Féin a chance to show that they could persuade the IRA to reinstate the ceasefire". [...] The President of the United States, Bill Clinton, stated he was [...] "deeply outraged by the bomb explosion" [...] and joined Bruton and Major in [...] "utterly condemning this brutal and cowardly act of terrorism". Sinn Féin President, Gerry Adams, stated that he was [...] "shocked and saddened" [...] by the bombing. He insisted that his party was committed to achieving a peace settlement and argued [...] "it is sheer folly to return to the old agenda of excluding Sinn Féin and seeking to isolate republicans". On 20 June 1996, the IRA claimed responsibility for the bombing, and stated that it [...] "sincerely regretted" [...] causing injury to civilians. The IRA statement continued:The British Government has spent the last 22 months since August '94 trying to force the surrender of IRA weapons and the defeat of the republican struggle. We are still prepared to enhance the democratic peace process [...] <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> to be a lasting peace [...] then the British Government must put the democratic rights of all of the people of Ireland before its own party political self interest.|$|E
