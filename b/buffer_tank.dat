50|$|Buffer tanks {{store the}} hot water the biomass {{appliance}} generates and circulates it around the heating system. Sometimes referred to as 'thermal stores', they are crucial for the efficient operation of all biomass boilers where the system loading fluctuates rapidly, or the volume {{of water in the}} complete hydraulic system is relatively small. Using a suitably sized buffer vessel prevents rapid cycling of the boiler when the loading is below the minimum boiler output. Rapid cycling of the boiler causes a large increase in harmful emissions such as Carbon monoxide, dust, and NOx, greatly reduces boiler efficiency and increases electrical consumption of the unit. In addition, service and maintenance requirements will be increased as parts are stressed by rapid heating and cooling cycles. Although most boilers claim to be able to turn down to 30% of nominal output, in the real world this is often not achievable due to differences in the fuel from the 'ideal' or test fuel. A suitably sized <b>buffer</b> <b>tank</b> should therefore be considered where the loading of the boiler drops below 50% of the nominal output - in other words unless the biomass component is purely base load, the system should include a <b>buffer</b> <b>tank.</b> In any case where the secondary system does not contain sufficient water for safe removal of residual heat from the biomass boiler irrespective of the loading conditions, the system must include a suitably sized <b>buffer</b> <b>tank.</b> The residual heat from a biomass unit varies greatly depending on the boiler design and the thermal mass of the combustion chamber. light weight, fast response boilers require only 10ltr/kW, while industrial wet wood units with very high thermal mass require 40ltr/kW.|$|E

50|$|A {{combined}} {{storage tank}} combines {{hot water storage}} both for heating support and drinking water heating in a larger tank. As a result, warm water, typically from solar thermal energy, is stored temporarily for both purposes for later consumption. Breaks in sunshine can thus be bridged without any additional heating, depending on the heating requirement and storage size. This generally takes up less space than two individual <b>buffer</b> <b>tanks</b> and thermal losses are thereby reduced. These storage tanks are mostly insulated {{on the outside and}} designed for the lowest possible heat losses. Usually, it is a tank-in-tank system, that is, a two-compartment system arranged one inside the other. It is thus a combined <b>buffer</b> storage <b>tank</b> with a heat exchange plate in between.

The purpose of using <b>buffer</b> <b>tanks</b> is to increase the availability either by separating production units from each other or by minimizing flow variations. However, the methods for achieving this goal is not trivial, and depend on the specific characteristics of the problem.

We conducted an empirical study based on remotely sensed data and field observations from an enhanced oil recovery (EOR) site in China. Geostatistical analysis and general linear model regression were performed to detect the impact of fugitive CO 2 emission from oil <b>buffer</b> <b>tanks.</b> Results show that the emitted CO 2 resulted in CO 2 enrichment about 25 - 100 m away from the <b>buffer</b> <b>tanks.</b> The spatial pattern and semivariogram parameters of normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI) in the CCS core operating area had not been altered significantly. The CO 2 concentration is not a statistically significant explanatory factor for the variation of wheat growth in the present CCS-EOR site that located in Gaoqing County in the east of China. The impact of fugitive CO 2 emission on wheat growth appears limited because of the instability and rapid diffusion of emitted CO 2. However, we emphasize that these results were extracted from the in-situ monitoring that characterized by macro-level and short term. Long-term biology-based study at a micro-level is imperative for further understanding and determining the environmental impact of fugitive CO 2 emission.

40|$|Controllability is {{the ability}} of a process to achieve {{acceptable}} performance, and in this thesis we use controllability analysis in the design of <b>buffer</b> <b>tanks,</b> feedforward controllers, and multivariable controllers such as model predictive control (MPC). There is still an increasing pressure on the process industry, both from competitors (prize and quality) and the society (safety and pollution), and one important contribution is a smooth and stable production. Thus, it is important to dampen the effect of uncontrolled variations (disturbances) that the process may experience. The process itself often dampens high-frequency disturbances, and feedback controllers are installed to handle the low-frequency part of the disturbances, including at steady state if integral action is applied. However, there may be an intermediate frequency range where neither of these two dampens the disturbances sufficiently. In {{the first part of this}} thesis we present methods for the design of <b>buffer</b> <b>tanks</b> based on this idea. Both mixing tanks for quality disturbances and surge tanks with “slow” level control for flow-rate variations are addressed. Neutralization is usually performed in one or several mixing tanks, and we give recommendations for tank sizes and the number of tanks. With local PI or PID control, we recommend equal tanks, and give a simple formula for the total volume. We also give recommendations for design of <b>buffer</b> <b>tanks</b> for other types of processes. We propose first to determine the required transfer function to achieve the required performance, and thereafter to find a physical realization of this transfer function. Alternatively, if measurements of the disturbances are available, one may apply feedforward control to handle the intermediate frequency range. Feedforward control is based mainly on a model, and we study the effect of model errors on the performance. We define feedforward sensitivities. For some model classes we provide rules for when the feedforward controller is effective, and we also design robust controllers such as μ -optimal feedforward controllers. Multivariable controllers, such as model predictive control (MPC), may use both feedforward and feedback control, and the differences between these two also manifest themselves in a multivariable controller. We use the class of serial processes to gain insight into how a multivariable controller works. For one specific MPC we develop a state space formulation of the controller and its state estimator under the assumption that no constraints are active. Thus, for example the gains of each channel of the MPC (from measurements to the control inputs) can be found, which gives further insight into to the controller. Both a neutralization process example and an experiment are used to illustrate the ideas. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R

In this situation, the datacentre receives water of a certain temperature and all the heat generated by the IT equipment is delivered to another user with this water circuit. This means that the facility does not only reject the heat, but also the water which contains the heat to allow an external party to transport and use the warmed-up liquid. This results in a complete lack of cooling installations and the datacentre effectively acts like a large water heater. Water flows into the datacentre and comes out at high temperatures.|$|R

Waste heat is recovered and stored in a large mass of native bedrock which is penetrated by a cluster of 140 heat exchanger equipped boreholes (155mm diameter) that are 150m deep. This store is used for heating an adjacent factory as needed, even months later. An example of using STES to recover and utilize natural heat that otherwise would be wasted is the Drake Landing Solar Community in Alberta, Canada.

5000|$|In Eve Online, tanking can be {{achieved}} by all ships, some more effectively than others however. Two main types of tanking exist, shield by the Caldari and Minmatar, and armor by the Amarr and Gallente. Each type can be maximized through a combination of bonuses from skillbook training, implants, ship modules, and support from other players' ship modules. Due to limited ship module capacity, it is best to focus on one area of tanking to save module slots for increasing damage dealt and/or a ships other functions. For example, a shield tank ship will have greater hit points in shields and low hit points in armor. Speed tanking is another form of tanking where one moves so fast that any damage dealt to the ship's health is minimized or negligible or so that any attacks fail to hit the ship. Spider tanking is a combined effort by defending ships repairing each other during combat via remote repair modules. Spider tanks are able to withstand targets that deal very high damage yet to also maintain high damage dealt. Logistics ships, or [...] "logis", keep tanks alive in combat by [...] "transferring" [...] shield or armor health via use of their own capacitor energy. Typical types of tanking decrease the amount of damage taken or increase the effective health pool (which in the case of shield tanking also increases passive health regeneration), and use repair modules to repair incoming damage. Increasing one's resistances is typically the best when use of repairing modules/logis {{will be part of the}} tank, whereas a <b>buffer</b> <b>tank</b> of high health works better for tanking during fast paced engagements like PvP.|$|E
50|$|Purified Air is {{supplied}} {{in the gap}} between the water surface and the top of the Super-Kamiokande tank. The air purification system contains three compressors, a <b>buffer</b> <b>tank,</b> dryers, filters, and activated charcoal filters. A total of 8 m3 of activated charcoal is used. The last 50 L of charcoal is cooled to −40 °C to increase removal efficiency for radon. Typical flow rates, dew point, and residual radon concentration are 18 m3/h, −65 °C (@+1 kg/cm2), and a few mBq m−3, respectively. Typical radon concentration in the dome air is measured to be 40 Bq m−3. Radon levels in the mine tunnel air, near the tank cavity dome, typically reach 2000-3000 Bq m−3 during the warm season, from May until October, while from November to April the radon level is approximately 100-300 Bq m−3. This variation is due to the chimney effect in the ventilation pattern of the mine tunnel system; in cold seasons, fresh air flows into the Atotsu tunnel entrance that is a relatively short path through exposed rock before reaching the experimental area, while in the summer, air flows out the tunnel, drawing radon-rich air from deep within the mine past the experimental area.In order to keep radon levels in the dome area and water purification system below 100 Bq m−3, fresh air is continually pumped at approximately 10 m3/min from outside the mine which generates a slight over-pressure in the Super-Kamiokande experimental area to minimize the entry of ambient mine air. A “Radon Hut” (Rn Hut) was constructed near the Atotsu tunnel entrance to house equipment for the dome air system: a 40 hp air pump with 10 m^3 min−1 /15 PSI pump capacity, air dehumidifier, carbon filter tanks, and control electronics. In autumn 1997, an extended intake air pipe was installed at a location approximately 25 m above the Atotsu tunnel entrance. This low level satisfies that goals of air quality so that carbon filter regeneration operations would no longer be required.|$|E

Since our model does not consider events shorter than a heart beat, capacitive and inductive effects due to blood inertia and vessel elasticity are neglected: we thus considered that the pulmonary and systemic circuits are only resistive. Since our aim is to reproduce the cardiac remodeling due to a long-term disease, the vasoconstriction and vasodilation were also neglected and, consequently, the pulmonary and systemic resistances only change at a low rate. Atria are not described in our model which therefore only considers a two-cavity heart, meaning that atria only {{play the role of}} <b>buffer</b> <b>tanks</b> when the ventricular pressure is small enough to allow the blood release in ventricular cavities during ventricular filling.

40|$|Summary. The {{concentrated}} {{sodium sulfate}} solution is formed during {{the processing of}} waste battery scrap. A promising way to further treatment of the concentrated salt solution could be the conversion of these salts into acid and bases by electrodialysis, that can be reused in the same technical process cycle. For carrying out the process of conversion of salts into the corresponding acid and base several cells schemes with different combinations of cation, anion and bipolar membranes are used. At this article a comparative analysis of these cells is carried out. In the cells there were used the membranes МC- 40, МА- 41 and МB- 2 I. Acid and base solutions with higher concentration may be obtained {{during the process of}} electrodialysis in the circulation mode, when a predetermined amount of salt in the closed loop is run through a set of membranes to obtain the desired concentration of the product. The disadvantages of this method are the high cost of <b>buffer</b> <b>tanks</b> and the need to work with small volumes of treated solutions.

In collaboration with the Process Industrial Centre at Lund University and Perstorp AB, this study aims to model utility disturbances in manufacturing sites. Utilities are services or equipment necessary for the production in one or several of the areas that a site consists of. The goal of the modelling is to minimise economic losses related to utility disturbances. Manufacturing sites can be mapped as area networks with interdependent areas, <b>buffer</b> <b>tanks</b> and utilities that have defined capabilities. In this study a general method for modelling area networks as mixed integer linear programs (MILP) have been presented. If the utility disturbances length and scope are unknown {{it is possible to}} use stochastic programming in the model, which would enable minimisation of losses by optimising over a number of scenarios, or guesses, of how a disturbance will unfold. To demonstrate how a site can be represented by a MILP-model, an area network corresponding to a part of the Perstorp AB Stenungsund site has been modelled.
