60|$|Before {{we begin}} to {{consider}} the laws and constitutions of the Saxons, let us take {{a view of the}} state of the country from whence they are derived, as it is portrayed in ancient writers. This view will be the <b>best</b> <b>comment</b> on their institutions. Let us represent to ourselves a people without learning, without arts, without industry, solely pleased and occupied with war, neglecting agriculture, abhorring cities, and seeking their livelihood only from pasturage and hunting through a boundless range of morasses and forests. Such a people must necessarily be united to each other by very feeble bonds; their ideas of government will necessarily be imperfect, their freedom and their love of freedom great. From these dispositions it must happen, of course, that the intention of investing one person or a few with the whole powers of government, and the notion of deputed authority or representation, are ideas that never could have entered their imaginations. When, therefore, amongst such a people any resolution of consequence was to be taken, there was no way of effecting it but by bringing together the whole body of the nation, that every individual might consent to the law, and each reciprocally bind the other to the observation of it. This polity, if so it may be called, subsists still in all its simplicity in Poland.|$|E
60|$|We are {{thankful for}} a {{commentator}} at last who passes dry-shod over the turbide onde of inappreciative criticism, and, quietly waving aside the thick atmosphere which has gathered {{about the character}} of Dante both as man and poet, opens for us his City of Doom with the divining-rod of reverential study. Miss Rossetti comes commended to our interest, not only {{as one of a}} family which seems to hold genius by the tenure of gavelkind, but as having a special claim by inheritance to a love and understanding of Dante. She writes English with a purity that has in it something of feminine softness with no lack of vigor or precision. Her lithe mind winds itself with surprising grace through the metaphysical and other intricacies of her subject. She brings to her work the refined enthusiasm of a cultivated woman and the penetration of sympathy. She has chosen the better way (in which Germany took the lead) of interpreting Dante out of himself, the pure spring from which, and from which alone, he drew his inspiration, and not from muddy Fra Alberico or Abbate Giovacchino, from stupid visions of Saint Paul or voyages of Saint Brandan. She has written by far the <b>best</b> <b>comment</b> that has appeared in English, and we should say the best that has been done in England, were it not for her father's Comento analitico, for excepting which her filial piety will thank us. Students of Dante in the original will be grateful to her for many suggestive hints, and those who read him in English will find in her volume a travelling map in which the principal points and their connections are clearly set down. In what we shall say of Dante we shall endeavor only to supplement her interpretation with such side-lights as may have been furnished us by twenty years of assiduous study. Dante's thought is multiform, and, like certain street signs, once common, presents a different image according to the point of view. Let us consider briefly what was the plan of the Divina Commedia and Dante's aim in writing it, which, if not to justify, was at least to illustrate, for warning and example, the ways of God to man. The higher intention of the poem was to set forth the results of sin, or unwisdom, and of virtue, or wisdom, in this life, and consequently in the life to come, which is but the continuation and fulfilment of this. The scene accordingly is the spiritual world, of which we are as truly denizens now as hereafter. The poem is a diary of the human soul in its journey upwards from error through repentance to atonement with God. To make it apprehensible by those whom it was meant to teach, nay, from its very nature as a poem, and not a treatise of abstract morality, it must set forth everything by means of sensible types and images.|$|E

Machine translation, after an initial period of high hopes, and some large claims, was cast into outer darkness in 1966 by funding agencies who saw little return for their money. Reviewing twenty five years of artificial intelligence research in his presidential address to the American Association for Artificial Intelligence in 1985, Woody Bledsoe, one of the long-standing leaders of the field, though in areas quite outside language, said of those who attempted machine translation in the fifties and sixties: [...] "They may have failed, but they were right to try; we have learned so much from their attempts to do something so difficult".|$|E

40|$|In Scotland, {{as many of}} MacTalla’s {{readers are}} aware, {{there was a man}} known as Simple Archie, who was always ready to open his mouth and speak, and too often it wouldn’t be quite the <b>best</b> <b>comment</b> that he would make. For fear of earning his enmity, {{everybody}} wanted to keep on his right side. A neighbour of his once took a great fancy to a beautiful, young girl living nearby. In the midst of the rest of their conversation, he asked her to marry him but she wouldn’t have him: like many a woman before and after her, she expected to find someone better. Whether she would have done so or not as she then was, something unfortunate happened that lessened her chances. A goat had struck her in the eye with its horn, wounding her so badly that she lost it completely. Dear Archie knew all {{the ins and outs of}} what happened. Whether anybody else wanted her or not, she didn’t marry. Although she had only one eye, Donald would be satisfied with her as she was; finally, he offered himself to her again, and she was delighted to have him this time. They made a big, joyful wedding and Simple Archie got an invitation; I’m sure he knew full well that it was his silence they wanted, not his company. The bridegroom was distributing drams of whisky, and coming to Archie, he said to him: "Here, drink a toast to the bride and groom. " Archie grasped the glass and rising to his feet, he said: "I’m drinking this to the good health of the goat who won for you a good wife and for me a good wedding"...|$|E
