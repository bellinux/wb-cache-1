40|$|The current {{syllabus}} lack sufficiency <b>of</b> <b>fraud</b> {{education in}} areas <b>of</b> auditing, <b>fraud</b> examination and forensic accounting {{in the current}} accounting curriculum. This paper seeks to analyze the relationship between final year accouting students’ perceived coverage <b>of</b> <b>fraud</b> education and the overall sufficiency of the three areas in higher-learning institutions. Learning objectives {{were used to determine}} the sufficiency <b>of</b> <b>fraud</b> education in current accounting curriculum and a brief comparison between different higher learning institutions in Malaysia, students with and without internship experience, and test of ethical conduct was performed. Findings include insufficient coverage in the areas <b>of</b> <b>fraud</b> examination and forensic accounting but not auditing and that the students’ perceived coverage <b>of</b> <b>fraud</b> education depends on the sufficiency <b>of</b> <b>fraud</b> examination and forensic accounting areas. The paper only tested the perception aspect of students and results may differ depending on student’s aptitude in learning. This study provides valuable input to redesigning the current accounting curriculum to expose students to fraud-based learning environment and also incorporating forensic accounting courses. It seeks to regain society’s confidence in the accounting profession through improved fraud detection. The research will add value to the accounting education offered to undergraduates as very little prior research has been done to provide insights in students’ (end-user) perception <b>of</b> <b>fraud</b> education...|$|R

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{correlates}} of white-collar victimization, and even less {{is known about}} white-collar crime reporting. In this article, the extent to which predictors <b>of</b> <b>fraud</b> victimization are the same as the predictors <b>of</b> <b>fraud</b> reporting is examined. Using a national sample <b>of</b> <b>fraud</b> victims, these findings were consistent with prior research in that involvement in risky behaviors and age were found to be important predictors <b>of</b> <b>fraud</b> victimization. Additionally, the specific factors that are influential in predicting fraud victimization appear to vary across offense type. Unfortunately, little was revealed regarding the predictors of the official reporting <b>of</b> <b>fraud</b> victimizations. Future research needs to further unravel the importance of risky behavior in both victimization and reporting, as well as to focus on a broader array of white-collar crimes. ...|$|R
