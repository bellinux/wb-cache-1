5|$|Scott {{had decided}} on a mixed {{transport}} strategy, relying on contributions from dogs, motor sledges and ponies. He appointed Cecil Meares {{to take charge of}} the dog teams, and recruited Shackleton's former motor specialist, Bernard Day, to run the motor sledges. Oates would <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ponies, but as he could not join the expedition until May 1910, Scott instructed Meares, who knew nothing of horses, to buy them—with unfortunate consequences for their quality and performance.|$|E
5|$|Arundel {{joined the}} {{opposition}} {{at an early}} point, and {{did not attend the}} Stamford parliament in July 1309, where Gaveston's return was negotiated. After Gaveston returned, his behaviour became even more offensive, and opposition towards him grew. In addition to this, there was great discontent with Edward II's failure to follow up his father's Scottish campaigns. On 16 March 1310, the king had to agree to the appointment of a committee known as the Lords Ordainers, who were to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reform of the royal government. Arundel was one of eight earls among the twenty-one Ordainers.|$|E

5|$|On 1 September 1944, Tibbets {{reported}} to Colorado Springs Army Airfield, {{the headquarters of}} the Second Air Force, where he met with its commander, Major General Uzal Ent, and three representatives of the Manhattan Project, Lieutenant Colonel John Lansdale Jr., Captain William S. Parsons, and Norman F. Ramsey Jr., who briefed him on the project. Tibbets was told that he would <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 509th Composite Group, a fully self-contained organization of about 1,800 men, which would have 15 B-29s and a high priority for all kinds of military stores. Ent gave Tibbets a choice of three possible bases: Great Bend Army Airfield, Kansas; Mountain Home Army Airfield, Idaho; or Wendover Army Air Field, Utah. Tibbets selected Wendover for its remoteness.|$|E
5|$|By 1310 the {{relationship}} between Edward II and his earls had deteriorated {{to the point where}} a committee of earls took control of government from the king. The earls disobeyed a royal order not to carry arms to parliament, and in full military attire presented a demand to the king for the appointment of a commission of reform. At the heart of the deteriorating situation was the peers' opinion of Edward II's relationship with Piers Gaveston, and his reputedly outrageous behavior. On 16 March 1310, the king agreed to the appointment of Ordainers, who were to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reform of the royal household. John of Brittany was one of eight earls appointed to this committee of21, referred to as the Lords Ordainers. He was among the Ordainers considered loyal to Edward II and was also by this time one of the older remaining earls.|$|E
5|$|Carpenter was not {{the first}} person asked to oversee the comic; Mark Verheiden, who co-wrote the one-off comic, was {{originally}} intended to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bimonthly series. Verheiden's commitment to the TV series kept him from working on the comic books, so he asked Carpenter if he would take them on. Although the comic-book series was intended to expand on the TV series, there was an occasional continuity overlap because of differences in production schedule between the comic and the series. In one instance, the comic book showed Clark robbing an ATM and the season-three premiere showed him robbing multiple ATMs. The comic-book series tied into the TV series, the Chloe Chronicles webisodes and Smallville-related webpages, with cast and crew interviews and information on the episodes' production. The comic-book series ended in January 2005, with no comics published until the Season Eleven series debut.|$|E

5|$|Following Taboo Tuesday, Evolution (Triple H, Ric Flair and Batista) {{were put}} in charge of Raw, after Eric Bischoff took the night off, {{following}} his match the night before. Triple H granted Flair the match of his choice; Flair wanted a rematch against Randy Orton, as he lost a steel cage match to Orton the previous night. Orton accepted Flair's challenge, with a stipulation that if he defeated Flair he would get an opportunity to face Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship at the November pay-per-view Survivor Series. Orton did not receive the opportunity, as he lost to Flair. On the November 1 episode of Raw, Bischoff scheduled a traditional 8-man elimination tag team match involving Team Orton (Randy Orton, Chris Jericho, Maven and Chris Benoit) facing off against Team Triple H (Triple H, Batista, Edge and Gene Snitsky) at Survivor Series. The winning team would be granted absolute control of running the show for a month, and the winning members would all get a week to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> program.

5|$|On 12November 1945, at {{the first}} general meeting of army leadership, General Sudirman– {{the leader of the}} Fifth Division in Purwokerto, who had two years {{military}} experience and was 23 years younger than Oerip– was elected leader of the army following two deadlocked votes. In the third round, Oerip had 21votes to Sudirman's 22. Divisional commanders from Sumatra, who had voted unanimously, swayed the vote in Sudirman's favour; Oerip had lost votes because some of the division leaders distrusted his history with the KNIL and the oath he had taken to the Dutch motherland upon graduation. Although Sudirman was surprised at his selection and offered to surrender the leadership position to Oerip, the meeting did not allow it; Oerip himself was glad to no longer <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> army. Sudirman kept Oerip, by then a lieutenant general, to serve as chief of staff under him. While Sudirman remained unconfirmed, Oerip remained de jure leader; however, the Indonesian journalist Salim Said writes that Oerip's orders were at times unintelligible owing to the leader's poor command of Indonesian and often ignored unless approved by Sudirman.|$|E
5|$|On July 20, 400 hastily {{assembled}} US Army recruits {{arrived in}} Okinawa aboard the USS Walker. The inexperienced soldiers {{were assigned to}} the 29th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Infantry Division, a command that was preparing other battalions to move into Korea and to relieve the other units of the 24th Infantry Division. The new formations, now consisting mostly of soldiers who had no combat experience and grouped into two battalions, were immediately sent into Pusan. The headquarters of the regiment remained behind to form a new regiment. This regiment would originally <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> defense of Okinawa but would later be rushed into Korea. The two battalions landed in Pusan on July 21 and {{were assigned to the}} 19th Infantry Regiment, 24th Infantry Division, but they retained their designations as the 1st and 3rd Battalions of the 29th Infantry Regiment. Instead of being given time to train and prepare to enter the front lines, the battalions were immediately sent to the regiment's sector at Chinju. By July 22 the units were on the front lines with new equipment. The equipment, fresh from production lines, was not prepared for combat, despite promises from several commanders that the unit would be given time to do so.|$|E

5|$|The subpoenas are {{handed out}} in the hearing over Bartlet's {{concealment}} of his multiple sclerosis. The special prosecutor, Clement Rollins (Pryor), appears to be both fair and responsible, but C.J. believes the White House will be better served {{in the public eye}} if investigated by a partisan agent. She therefore decides—against the strong objections of White House counsel Oliver Babish—to present Rollins as an ally of the administration, thereby forcing Congress to take control over the investigation. Meanwhile Donna, unwittingly, becomes entangled in potential problems over the hearings. Ainsley Hayes sets her up on a date with the Republican House Government Oversight Committee counsel Clifford Calley, but even though the date seems to go well, Calley then leaves her quite abruptly {{in the middle of the}} street. Donna later realizes the reason: his congressional committee is the one that will <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> investigation, and a relationship between the two could constitute a conflict of interest.|$|E
5|$|In January 1944, Eichelberger was {{informed}} that he would <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> next operation, a landing at Hansa Bay with the 24th and 41st Infantry Divisions. However, in March this was cancelled in favor of Operation Reckless, a landing by the same force at Hollandia. The operation meant leapfrogging the Japanese defenses at Hansa Bay, but was risky because it was outside the range of land-based air cover. Cover was instead provided by aircraft carriers of the United States Pacific Fleet, but {{this meant that the}} operation had to adhere to a strict timetable. Hoping to avoid a repeat of Buna, Eichelberger meticulously planned the operation, and implemented a thorough training program that emphasized physical fitness, individual initiative, small unit tactics and amphibious warfare. The operation went well, mainly because surprise was achieved and few Japanese were present in the area. However, poor topographical intelligence led to an inability to clear some beaches due to their being backed by swamps. Supplies piled up on the beaches, with fuel and ammunition being stored together in some instances. On 23 April a single Japanese plane ignited a fuel dump, which caused a fire that resulted in 124 casualties and the loss of 60 per cent of the ammunition stockpile. An appalled Krueger felt that Eichelberger had been let down by his staff, and offered to transfer Byers to an assistant division commander's post, but Eichelberger turned down the offer.|$|E
5|$|When news of {{the siege}} reached Spain, Philip IV gave orders to {{assemble}} a relief fleet. Second-hand goods were purchased in the Netherlands and extraordinary levies were carried out across the country. The command of the expedition was entrusted to the Portuguese loyalist Miguel de Noronha, Count of Linhares, who was Captain General of the Galleys of the Mediterranean, and therefore supreme commander of the Spanish naval forces of this sea. He received orders to sail to Orbetello in command of 22 men-of-war of the Silver fleet and the Dunkirk squadron; the later providing 8 frigates. At least 3,300 soldiers were brought aboard these ships for the relief. Linhares' second in command was Admiral General Francisco Díaz de Pimienta, who displeased by his always secondary role, had recently resigned, claiming ill health. While Pimienta would <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sailing ships, Linhares would do so with the galleys. Once at sea, the Spanish fleet was joined off the Sardinian Cape Carbonara by 18 galleys from the squadrons of Naples, Sardinia, Genoa, and Sicily, which drove up its strength to 22 galleons and frigates and 30 galleys. Grand Admiral Jean Armand de Maillé-Brézé, Admiral de Maille Brézé, in the meantime, could be reinforced by the divisions of Montade and Saint-Tropez, {{and was able to}} oppose Linhares and Pimienta with 24 sailing ships and 20 galleys.|$|E
