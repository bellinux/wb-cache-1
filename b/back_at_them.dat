25|$|Apparently {{dizzy and}} disoriented, Tunney grabbed {{on to the}} ring's top rope with his left hand. Dempsey, who used to stand over opponents and rush right <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> after they got up, looked down on Tunney. Referee Dave Barry ordered Dempsey into a neutral corner to no avail; Dempsey just stood there, observing his opponent. This gave Tunney {{precious}} seconds to recuperate. By the time Dempsey finally walked to a neutral corner, Tunney had been down for around 3 to 8 seconds. Barry could not start to count on Tunney until Dempsey reached the neutral corner, {{but he was still}} able to count to nine before Tunney got up. Some believe that if Dempsey had responded to the referee's orders in time, he would have likely regained the world Heavyweight crown with a seventh round knockout of Tunney. The validity of this argument has been debated even to this day. In the fight film, a clock was superimposed that recorded Tunney's time on the floor as 13 seconds, from the moment he fell until he got up. Because of this delay, it became known as The Long Count Fight.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{intensity}} of the shootout, the Federal Police called for ground and air reinforcements, including a Black Hawk helicopter with additional troops. Initially, 41 Federal Police officers participated in the confrontation. However, they called for 60 more officers to join them in the operation. The gunmen managed to shoot and hit the helicopter at least three times with AK-47s and AR-15s. However, the troops shot <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> and the gunmen were not able to use their grenade-launchers and machine guns, which had the capability of shooting down the helicopter. The gunmen that were hiding in one of the property's warehouses were killed by the helicopter's artillery. Some of them managed to run away from the warehouse and attempted to shoot at the helicopter, but they were neutralized in open field. The night shift gunmen who were sleeping also joined the confrontation but were also killed in the exchange. The Federal Police believed that at least 60 or 70 organized crime members participated in the shootout, but that some of them managed to escape. In total, Michaocán authorities concluded that at least 2,000 shots were fired during the gunfight after they recovered the fired bullets from the crime scene. Over 1,000 more unused ammunition were found in the gunmen's possession.|$|E

500|$|Homer and {{the others}} are placed on a nuclear {{submarine}}. When the captain goes to check on a problem in the torpedo hatch, Homer is left in charge. An enemy submarine approaches, and Homer gives the order to fire a torpedo. However, the captain is in the torpedo tube and is fired at the other submarine. The other sub fires <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> and Homer gives the order to retreat. The submarine ends up in Russian waters and is seen by the United States government as an attempt to defect. This event creates a political schism between the USA and Russia, leading to the revelation that the Soviet Union in fact never truly dissolved. Out of nowhere the Berlin Wall rises from the ground, Soviet troops and tanks take their positions and Vladimir Lenin rises from Lenin's tomb in Moscow à la Frankenstein's Monster [...] "to crush capitalism", all set to Alexander Borodin's 'Boyar chorus' from Prince Igor. Nuclear war is anticipated until the US Navy drops depth charges on Homer's sub, aiming either to destroy it or force it to surface. The consequent explosion causes a pinhole leak in the submarine's hull. Homer uses Bart's earring to plug the leak and saves the submarine.|$|E

2500|$|At {{this point}} of the battle {{it is clear that}} Caesar's {{opposition}} had little hope of survival. They were being pushed closer and closer into a dense pack that was being surrounded by Caesars men who were using projectile weapons to pick off their remaining forces. Using [...] peltats (a light infantry man) equipped with slings and javelins {{and with the help of}} archers, they unleashed a barrage of missiles at the closely packed Nervii. The last of them fought with ferocity and courage for they were continuing to retaliate with their spears and catching the Romans javelins and throwing them <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>them.</b> The Nervii hadn't used any other projectile type weapon except for the spear. The Nervii warriors fought to the last, standing on the bodies of their slain comrades, and throwing the Romans’ own spears <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>them.</b> [...] Eventually the few remaining Nervii broke and fled the field. [...] Caesar’s opinion of the Nervii was that they had shown great fighting spirit in carrying an attack forward so vigorously on to difficult ground and in continuing to fight stubbornly when the tide of battle turned irretrievably against them. Caesar talks of a grimly inspiring image of the last of the Nervii who were atop a mound of corpses of their own warriors and shouting in defiance towards the Romans, fighting till their last breath. He goes on to say that they had outstanding courage, for they launched a surprise attack, crossed a river up its banks then rushed on to attack all with A fighting spirit. He glorifies his victory by stating how well his army did without having to be ordered to launch a counterattack. It was most probable that his soldiers had experienced veteranism that they were able to hold off their onslaught. Still he mitigated his losses by not including how many casualties he suffered or that they were in serious danger of losing. In his account of this battle in his book [...] "the Conquest of Gaul" [...] he gives a biased information of what actually happened in the battle but it remains one of the only primary sources during that time. And since it was written by him much is unknown of the Nervii's side of the battle, like how Bodougnats ( [...] the leader of the Nervii) ordered his men into battle.|$|E
