A further contribution of ¥800,000 in 2007 enabled the newspaper to upgrade its aging equipment; new equipment they purchased included a hectography machine, a scanner, industrial staplers and paper cutting machines, a <b>blade</b> <b>sharpener,</b> three digital cameras, two digital video cameras, nine computers, two multifunction printers, a laser printer, and two fax machines.|$|E
50|$|Founded by the American {{inventor}} Albert J. Dremel in 1932, {{the company}} is located in Racine, Wisconsin. Albert J. Dremel held 55 patents across {{a wide range of}} inventions, including the electric eraser, electric fish scaler, electric shoe polisher, electric screwdriver, power sanders, scroll saws, a device to keep tabs on chicken's egg production and first design of the now standard walk behind rotary lawn mower. His first product released within the company was with an electric razor <b>blade</b> <b>sharpener.</b> This success was soon brought to a halt after popularity of cheap, disposable razors came into effect. This then forced Albert J. Dremel to come up with his next invention, seen as the most important of his career - the high speed rotary tool, later named the Dremel Multitool. Compact, lightweight and versatile, this invention was successful in the hobby and craft market.|$|E

50|$|Unlike prism <b>sharpeners,</b> linear <b>blade</b> <b>sharpeners</b> do not rotate {{relative}} to the pencil being sharpened, and {{may be viewed as}} just a special form of knife, with a mechanical guide for increased safety and convenience. Some models use replaceable shaving razor blades, while others have permanently-fitted <b>blades.</b> Linear <b>blade</b> <b>sharpeners</b> may require more skill, but they allow one to sharpen the tip of the pencil into any desired shape and angle of taper, whereas prism sharpeners have a fixed sharpening angle and produce circular symmetry.|$|R
50|$|While most linear <b>blade</b> <b>sharpeners</b> {{are simple}} and {{directly}} hand operated, some devices {{in the past}} were crank operated, using mechanisms to convert crank rotation into linear motion.|$|R
5000|$|Besides {{producing}} one of Baltimore's favorite {{brands of}} ice cream, it {{played a major}} role in the development of the nation's ice cream business. Many important pioneering industry innovations were developed over the next 50 years in this building, including new kinds of packaging; the <b>blade</b> <b>sharpener,</b> which produced smoother ice cream; and fast freezing, which allowed ice cream to be frozen with a liquid cream texture. The adjoining building at 1107 East Fayette Street, built in the 1920s as part of the Hendler Creamery complex, is also significant, notably in the creation of one of the nation's first ice cream delivery systems by refrigerated truck. As the Maryland Historical Society noted in a blog posting, The Velvet Kind: The Sweet Story of Hendlers Creamery, [...] "The ice cream was virtually everywhere in Maryland, as it was distributed to over 400 stores at the company’s peak, which kept the production lines humming. The factory ran six days a week with vanilla ice cream being made almost everyday. Vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry were production mainstays, but the creamery dabbled in more exotic flavors as well. Hutzler's department store sold several varieties, including ginger and peppermint. For the Southern Hotel, [...] Hendlers supplied a tomato sorbet which was served as a side dish rather than dessert. The eggnog ice cream was produced each year at Christmas time. Hendler made with real rum, was a major hit. The factory also cranked out other holiday-themed products, such as an Independence Day treat made with vanilla, strawberry, and blueberry ice creams and a Mother’s Day cake topped with a silk screen of James McNeill Whistler’s portrait of his mother." ...|$|E

To look at the process chronologically, view the images in numerical order (Turning Oars 001 — Turning Oars 072). Terry Learned provided the description for this image. This image provides a close-up view of the three blades in the cutter head. Here Terry Learned polishes the seven-inch blades. Blades in this size aren 2 ̆ 7 t available for purchase, so Learned uses old planer blades from a planer mill and cuts them down to seven inches.

40|$|An {{electronically-controlled}} meat butchering {{machine has}} a quick-change cutting tool in a grip {{at the end}} of a manipularot arm. The blade (6) and holder are powered by a drive unit linked to a moment sensor measuring device (3), The blade is also linked to a blade-changer unit attached to the drive (5). The novelty is that: (a) a turning unit (4) is incorporated between the power sensor (3) and the blade (6) drive (5); (b) the turning unit (4) is a passive following device; (c) the turning unit (4) extended axis of rotation (8) runs outside of the blade centre towards the blade (6) cutting edge (9); (d) the blade-changing unit (10) consists of two or more blade-holders (11); (e) each blade holder (11) is positioned facing a cutter-arrester system (12); (f) the blade-holder (11) can be moved with respect to the cutter-arrester system (12); (g) each blade-holder (11) is connected to a blade cleaning system; (h) each blade holder may be linked to a <b>blade</b> <b>sharpener.</b> USE- The machine contin ues meat butchering operations with the installed blade, while the previously-used blade is being sharpened and cleaned. ADVANTAGE - The degree of manual intervention and associated labour costs of skilled butchers is minimised. Blades can be changed at frequent intervals, maximising output and quality of the cutting operation...|$|E
40|$|The hereby {{presented}} thesis pursues the occupations of puppeteers, gymnasts, vendors, <b>blade</b> <b>sharpeners</b> {{and changes}} of life strategies of itinerant lineages between the late 18 th and early 20 th Centuries. Above all, {{the research was}} anchored at various registers - firstly comprising registry offices, censuses, registers of homestead participants or residence applications. These were supplemented by the then public press, remembrances of contemporaries and other sources. The historical and demographical analyses based upon genealogical outputs were the dominant methodological background, the subject of which primarily became the characteristics of itinerant individuals and their place within society. The author also inquired into their ethnic origins and specific ways of earning one´s living. The pivot of this treatise, nonetheless, was to reveal true historical circumstances having once brought into life a number of widespread clan legends. Neither marriage strategies were omitted as they provided proof of certain behavioural patterns of both the itinerant and settled individuals. Last but not the least, {{attention was paid to}} the sojourn and life en route within this roving peripheral community, the presupposed uniqueness of which was fully proved in every respect...|$|R

40|$|The {{presence}} of an airway foreign body is potentially life threatening. It is well recognized that airway foreign bodies located in the central tracheobronchial tree may dislodge and move during the removal procedure. We report a case of an unusual airway foreign body (<b>sharpener</b> <b>blade)</b> that migrated preoperatively from one main bronchus to the other. A sharpener is a device for sharpening a pencil’s writing point. Case Report A 5 -year-old male child was referred to our institute with his-tory suggestive of <b>sharpener</b> <b>blade</b> aspiration for 14 hours. On examination, there was no evident cyanosis or respiratory distress. On chest auscultation, air entry {{on the right side}} was diminished as compared with the left side. No other added sounds were present. However, a chest x-ray posteroanterior view, available with the patient, revealed a radio opaque for-eign body in the region of the left main bronchus (Figure 1). This prompted us to have a repeat chest x-ray chest done...|$|R
50|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, a honing steel (or butcher's steel or {{sharpening}} steel) does not sharpen knives, but instead straightens the <b>blade,</b> while a <b>sharpener</b> sharpens the <b>blade.</b> A honing steel is a rod {{made of steel}} or ceramic, generally about 30 cm long (although can be longer) and 6 mm to 12 mm (¼ to ½ inch) thick. It is used to hone a knife blade after sharpening in order to restore the edge and improve cutting ability.|$|R
50|$|Any {{number of}} wind {{measurements}} or navigation calculations could {{be carried out}} on the compass face using the wind gauge bar. This was normally stowed folded {{against the back of}} the height bar, but could be rotated down and to the rear to lie over the compass. The cursor slid along the wind bar, allowing the bomb aimer to measure different airspeeds or times. A small scale on the cursor allowed for the conversion of indicated air speed to true air speed, which differs depending on altitude. A small ring on the right side of the cursor was used to accurately place markings on the compass using the grease pencil. A holder for the pencil and a <b>sharpener</b> <b>blade</b> were attached on the left side of the case.|$|R
5000|$|After nine hours, Roland Sundahl {{was found}} guilty of first-degree murder. He was sentenced to death. Upon hearing the sentence, he put {{his head in his hands}} and wept. Motions for a new trial and a Nebraska Supreme Court appeal were made. They both failed, so Sundahl's legal counsel filed for a stay of the sentence, then a {{rehearing}} in the case. Finally, an appeal was made to the U.S. Supreme Court. All three failed. While awaiting the decision on commutation from the state prison board, Sundahl attempted suicide while in prison by cutting his wrists with a pencil <b>sharpener</b> <b>blade,</b> hidden in his Bible. The blade was hidden by Sundahl cutting a small hole into several pages, and directly above the hole, he underlined, [...] "He maketh me to lie down in green pastures; he leadeth me beside the still waters." [...] Subsequent to the suicide attempt, he was put under 24-hour suicide watch.|$|R
50|$|The <b>blade</b> {{inside the}} <b>sharpener</b> shaves {{the wood and}} {{graphite}} tip of the pencil, while the shavings emerge through a slot along the blade edge. It {{is important that the}} cylindrical alignment hole closely fit the diameter of the pencil, to keep the pencil from wobbling, which would cause stepped or lurching cut-depths and point breakage. Another important feature is a larger clearance hole {{at the end of the}} cone allowing sections of the pencil lead which break away to be removed with only minor inconvenience. Prism sharpeners can be bare or enclosed in a container to collect the shavings, while some enclosed sharpeners may be harder to clear in the event of a blockage. A few prism sharpeners are hand-cranked, rotating the cutting blade instead of rotating the pencil. Moderate care is needed to not break the tip of the pencil being sharpened, requiring the pencil to be sharpened again. However, because pencils may have different standard diameters in different nations, imported sharpeners may have non-standard-sized alignment guide-holes, making sharpening attempts difficult. If the alignment hole is too small, the pencil cannot be inserted, while if it is too large, the tip of the pencil repeatedly will break off. Prism sharpeners may be right- or left-handed, requiring clockwise or counter-clockwise rotation of the pencil being sharpened.|$|R
