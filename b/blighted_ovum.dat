There are many fertilized eggs that never implant and are [...] "simply washed away" [...] after conception, though this can be answered by the fact that not every child becomes an adult; organisms die at various developmental stages. Therefore, within the fertilization view, these objects may be recognized as malformations of the fertilized sperm and egg.

40|$|Background: Anembryonic {{gestation}} (<b>blighted</b> <b>ovum)</b> is {{the most}} common identifiable pathology in the first trimester of pregnancy, always leads to miscarriage. Early pregnancy failures from <b>blighted</b> <b>ovum</b> are often due to chromosomal abnormalities and a poor quality of sperm or egg. Oxidative stresses as a factor of disturbance balance between the production of free radicals and antioxidant defenses is involved in the pathogenesis of many diseases, including mouth and throat cancer and cardiovascular disease. Catalase is one of the defensive systems against damages caused by oxidative stress in human. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the activity of salivary catalase in women with <b>blighted</b> <b>ovum</b> and women with history of normal pregnancy. Methods: This case-control study was performed on 34 patient women with <b>blighted</b> <b>ovum</b> and 34 healthy women as a control group. The study was performed in biochemistry laboratory at the University of Guilan from October 2015 to July 2015. The age range was 20 - 44 years and 18 - 45 years in patient and control groups, respectively. Unstimulated saliva samples were collected using spitting method. Catalase activity was measured by evaluating the constant rate of hydrogen peroxide decomposition in patient and control groups. Results: The patient group matched with healthy subjects in average age and having no other diseases history. The biochemical enzymatic assays indicate that the average catalase activities of saliva in patient and control groups were 14. 47 ± 3. 8 and 16. 42 ± 3. 48, respectively. Therefore, the catalase activity was significantly reduced in patient group as compared to the control group (P= 0. 03). Conclusion: The obtained results suggested that oxidative stress plays an important role in the pathogenesis of <b>blighted</b> <b>ovum.</b> Therefore, determination the activity of other antioxidant enzymes, in addition to catalse, may be used as a marker for diagnosis of <b>blighted</b> <b>ovum.</b> More studies with larger studied-population is recommended to confidently comment on the results of this study...|$|E
40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo assess {{differences}} in the surface anatomy of the gestational sac and endometrium in cases of <b>blighted</b> <b>ovum</b> and viable pregnancies using flexible hysteroscopy. MethodsThis was an observational case-control study. Seventeen patients with asymptomatic <b>blighted</b> <b>ovum</b> at gestational ages of 8 - 13 weeks and 32 women with viable pregnancy at 6 - 12 weeks of gestation were recruited. Subjects at 8 - 10 weeks of gestation in both groups were matched for comparison. The gross surface anatomy of the gestational sac and the endometrium was assessed and compared between the two groups. ResultsIn the viable pregnancy group, the gestational sac was either round (84. 4 %, 27 / 32) or ellipsoid and slightly creased (15. 6 %, 5 / 32). In the <b>blighted</b> <b>ovum</b> group, the sac appeared collapsed and wrinkled (58. 8 %, 10 / 17), small for gestational age (11. 8 %, 2 / 17), {{a combination of the}} two (17. 6 %, 3 / 17), or round and normal (11. 8 %, 2 / 17). In general, the sac in subjects with <b>blighted</b> <b>ovum</b> tended to have various degrees of loss in surface tension, collapse in shape, decrease in sac size, and dark blue color at the sac dome compared with the sac in viable pregnancies. ConclusionsThe anatomic alterations of the gestational sac reflect impending sac necrosis and abortion in early-stage pregnancy loss.

40|$|Background: <b>Blighted</b> <b>ovum</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} common reasons for {{abortion}} during the first three months of pregnancy. Manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) is an important antioxidant enzyme in the human immune system. The gene is located on 6 q 25 chromosome and acts on mitochondrial matrix. In the case of mutation or inactivity of this enzyme, mitochondrial and nuclear DNA will severely be destructed. The most common polymorphism of its gene is Val 16 Ala. Objective: The aim was to investigate a possible mutation in pregnant women who had abortion during the first trimester of pregnancy due to <b>blighted</b> <b>ovum.</b> Materials and Methods: In this case-control study, 34 women were entered as the case and control groups, respectively. Genome DNA was extracted from saliva samples and its genotype was determined using Tetra-primer amplification refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction technique. Results: In the case group, 16 (48 %) cases had Val/Val genotype, 17 (50 %) were heterozygote and had Val/Ala genotype, and 1 (2 %) had Ala/Ala genotype. Among controls, 7 (22 %) items had Val/Val genotype, 6 (17 %) had Val/Ala genotype, and 21 (61 %) had Ala/Ala genotype. The frequency of TT, CT, and CC genotypes was 48 %, 50 %, and 2 % in case group and 22 %, 17 %, and 61 % in control group, respectively. Statistical analysis revealed a significant relationship between Val 16 Ala polymorphism of MnSOD gene and <b>blighted</b> <b>ovum</b> (p= 0. 0003).

40|$|Background: Chromosomal {{disorders}} {{are the most}} common cause of first trimester spontaneous abortion. Among the human chromosomes, chromosome no. 9 was the most common structural chromosomal variant and it is not thought to be of any functional importance, which often considers as a normal variation in structural polymorphisms, nevertheless there are some studies which claim that there is an association between heteromorphism of chromosome no. 9 and some pregnancy complication. Case: To postulate any correlation between chromosome no. 9 heteromorphism and recurrent abortion, chromosomal analysis was performed on the basis of G-banding technique at high resolution for a couple with the history of 4 ultrasound diagnosed <b>blighted</b> <b>ovum</b> and Chromosome constitution appeared with chromosome no. 9 heteromorphism in all 30 metaphases screened for both partners (9 p 11 -q 13). Conclusion: Observation of reproductive failure in couples with heteromorohic pattern of chromosome no. 9 suggests that, although the heteromorphism of chromosome no. 9 is not a rare condition which often consider as a normal variation with no evidence of any phenotypic effect of patient, nevertheless it seems as if the location of heteromorphic region maybe interfere with meiotic events like the phenomenon of crossing over or miotic segregation of fertilized egg that eventually lead to the development of fertilized eggs with chromosomal abnormalities leading to the possibility of anemberyonic pregnancy, therefore chromosomal analysis for detecting of chromosome no. 9 heteromorphism for couples with the history of ultrasound diagnosed <b>blighted</b> <b>ovum</b> will be strongly suggeste...|$|E

Pregnancy was diagnosed between day 12 and 21 of buserelin administration. Analysis of serum luteinizing hormone on day 12 showed that pituitary desensitization occurred in conjunction with increasing production of ovarian steroid hormones. Serum concentra-tions of human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) were < 10 IU/ 1 on day 1 of buserelin administration for seven of the eight patients. The serum concentration of HCG on day 12 showed a median value of 722 IU/ 1 (range 14. 6 - 798 IU/ 1). Five of the eight patients were given HCG support (10 000 IU) following the diagnosis of pregnancy—three of these patients have ongoing pregnancies and the remaining two had blighted ova on scan. Of the remaining three patients, one had a singleton pregnancy which miscarried at 9 weeks, one had a <b>blighted</b> <b>ovum</b> on scan and bled per vagina shortly after this, and one bled per vagina prior to a scan being carried out. Our results show that pregnancy can occur during pituitary desensitization with buserelin, despite patients being counselled not to have unprotected intercourse in the cycle during which administration commences. An HCG assay on day 1 of buserelin administration is not helpful. Pregnancy should be suspected when ovarian steroid production persists despite complete pituitary down-regulation.

Gestational age ranged from the 6 th to the 12 th week. Three blood flow values were calculated, the pulsatility index, the resistance index and the peak systolic velocity. Results were compared between the two groups. Results: Of the 46 patients affected by uterine bleeding, 18 had an incomplete miscarriage, eight had a <b>blighted</b> <b>ovum,</b> five had a missed miscarriage and 15 continued their pregnancy until term and delivered liveborn infants.

40|$|The main {{problems}} in threatened early pregnancy are diagnostic ones. Due to {{the prevalence of}} the serious chromosomal anoma-lies in the tissues of spontaneous abortions the primary mea-sure in the prognostic evaluation is the reliable differentia-tion between viable and non-viable pregnancies äs early äs possible. Biochemical methods Blood progesterone (P) and estradiol (Ep) {{during the first few}} weeks of pregnancy are mainly produced By corpus luteum. After the sixth week of amenorrhea, however, the function of the corpus luteum is decreasing and the P and Ep production is delivered more from the trophoblastic tissue. Thus from the 6 th- 7 th week onwards, the P and Ep levels reflect the hor-monal capacity of trophoblastic tissue in the placenta.

40|$|Background: Iodine {{deficiency}} {{during pregnancy}} might {{be associated with}} reduced intelligence quotient (IQ) score in offspring. We assessed the effect of iodine supplementation in mildly iodine-deficient pregnant women on neurodevelopment of their offspring in areas where schoolchildren were iodine sufficient. Methods: In this randomised, placebo-controlled trial, pregnant women in Bangalore, India, and Bangkok, Thailand, were randomly assigned (1 : 1) to receive 200 μg iodine orally once a day or placebo until delivery. Randomisation was done with a computer-generated sequence and stratified by site. Co-primary outcomes were verbal and performance IQ scores on the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence Third Edition (WPPSI-III) and the global executive composite score from the Behaviour Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Preschool Version (BRIEF-P) in the children at age 5 - 6 years. The trial was double-blinded; some unmasking took place at age 2 years for an interim analysis, but participants and nearly all investigators remained masked to group assignment until age 5 - 6 years. Analysis was by intention to treat using mixed-effects models. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT 00791466. Findings: Between Nov 18, 2008, and March 12, 2011, 832 women entered the trial at a mean gestational age of 10 · 7 weeks (SD 2 · 7); median urinary iodine concentration was 131 μg/L (IQR 81 - 213). Mean compliance with supplementation was 87 %, assessed by monthly tablet counts. 313 children (iodine group, n= 159; placebo group, n= 154) were analysed for verbal and performance IQ with WPPSI-III and 315 (iodine group, n= 159; placebo group, n= 156) for overall executive function with BRIEF-P. Mean WPPSI-III scores for verbal IQ were 89 · 5 (SD 9 · 8) in the iodine group and 90 · 2 (9 · 8) {{in the placebo group}} (difference - 0 · 7, 95 % CI - 2 · 9 to 1 · 5; p= 0 · 77), and for performance IQ were 97 · 5 (12 · 5) in the iodine group and 99 · 1 (13 · 4) in the placebo group (difference - 1 · 6, - 4 · 5 to 1 · 3; p= 0 · 44). The mean BRIEF-P global executive composite score was 90 · 6 (26 · 2) in the iodine group and 91 · 5 (27 · 0) in the placebo group (difference - 0 · 9, - 6 · 8 to 5 · 0; p= 0 · 74). The frequency of adverse events did not differ between groups during gestation or at delivery: 24 women in the iodine group and 28 in the placebo group reported adverse events (iodine group: abortion, n= 20; <b>blighted</b> <b>ovum,</b> and n= 2; intrauterine death, n= 2; placebo group: abortion, n= 22; <b>blighted</b> <b>ovum,</b> n= 1; intrauterine death, n= 2; early neonatal death, n= 1; and neonatal death, n= 2). Interpretation: Daily iodine supplementation in mildly iodine-deficient pregnant women had no effect on child neurodevelopment at age 5 - 6 years.

40|$|Objective: The {{purposes}} of this study were to evaluate the potential for testicular sperm extraction (TESE) from azoospermic patients with non-mosaic Klinefelter's syndrome and to determine the outcome of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) using the extracted testicular sperm sample. Materials and Methods: Fourteen couples suffering from primary infertility in which the male partner had the azoospermic non-mosaic 47,XXY karyotype (Klinefelter's syndrome) participated in this study. All of the women underwent controlled ovarian hyperstimulation. Open testis biopsies were conducted 1 day prior to or on the day of oocyte retrieval. Motile sperm, extracted from the biopsied tissues in a wet preparation, were used for ICSI. The outcome of ICSI was evaluated from the fertilization rate, embryo-cleavage rate, clinical pregnancy rate, and chromosomal status of resultant fetuses or delivered babies. Results: Sperm retrieval was successful in eight of 14 patients (sperm retrieval rate, 57 %). In total, 118 mature oocytes were injected with extracted motile spermatozoa. This resulted in the production of 70 fertilized oocytes (fertilization rate, 59 %) and 67 embryos (cleavage rate, 96 %). Among the eight women who underwent embryo transfer, six achieved clinical pregnancies (clinical pregnancy rate, 75 %). The outcome of these pregnancies included one <b>blighted</b> <b>ovum</b> and the birth of four male and five female healthy babies. The live delivery rate was 62. 5 %. All of these babies were chromosomally and physiologically normal. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that azoospermic patients suffering from non-mosaic Klinefelter's syndrome can father their own genetic offspring when the TESE procedure is combined with ICSI and embryo transfer techniques...|$|E
40|$|Background: Considering {{that there}} is no general {{agreement}} on use of misoprostol as the best method for the termination of pregnancy in first trimester, this study aimed to compare the vaginal ultrasonography and serum Î²-hCG in the confirming of a complete abortion. Materials and Methods: This study was performed on 133 patients with a missed abortion or the <b>blighted</b> <b>ovum</b> diagnosed by vaginal ultrasonography, and a 12 week gestational sac admitted to Shabih-Khani hospital of Kashan in 2010. The patients' serum Î²-hCG levels were measured. They were assessed for the tissue discharge (abortion) after taking one or two doses of vaginal misoprostol suppositories and the oral contraceptive pills prescribed after confirming the abortion. Then vaginal ultrasonography and the serum Î²-hCG measurement were performed to diagnose the complete abortion in the second and fourth weeks of pregnancy. Results: Among 133 patients, a complete abortion was diagnosed for 116 (87. 2) and 80 cases (60. 15) based on Î²-hCG level and vaginal ultrasonography, respectively in the second week of pregnancy. In other cases, a complete abortion was diagnosed using both Î²-hCG level and vaginal ultrasonography in the fourth week. Therefore, Î²-hCG level was more effective (98. 75) than the vaginal ultrasonography to diagnose a complete abortion in the second week of pregnancy. The accordance between the two methods was 0. 327 {{at the end of the}} second week of pregnancy. Conclusion: The measurement of Î²-hCG level and vaginal ultrasonography are equally effective to confirm a complete abortion. Hence, to diagnose the complete abortion, determining the Î²-hCG level followed by clinical examination is recommended...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{develop a}} {{reliable}} method for collecting information on reproductive outcome in an occupational setting; and {{to investigate the}} health of children born to medical radiographers. METHODS: The study population comprised 6730 members of the College of Radiographers who were, {{at the time of}} survey; aged between 30 and 64 years, on the current membership file of the College, and were resident in Britain. RESULTS: The postal method developed proved to be reliable, with around 87 % of questionnaires being returned. The observed frequencies of reproductive events were broadly in line with findings from other studies: of the 9208 pregnancies reported, 83 % were livebirths, 12 % were miscarriages (gestational age or = 20 weeks), and 1 % were other rarer spontaneous adverse events (ectopic pregnancy, <b>blighted</b> <b>ovum,</b> and hydatidiform mole). There was little difference between {{men and women in the}} frequency of adverse reproductive events reported, with the exception that male radiographers reported fewer medical terminations, the proportions being 3. 1 % and 1. 4 % for women and men respectively. Among children, the overall risks of major congenital malformation (RR 1. 0, 95 %CI 0. 9 - 1. 2), chromosomal anomaly (RR 1. 4, 95 %CI 0. 8 - 2. 3), and cancer (RR 1. 2 95 %CI 0. 7 - 2. 0) were as expected based on general population rates. Borderline excesses of chromosomal anomalies other than Down's syndrome in the children of female radiographers (RR 3. 9, 95 %CI 1. 3 - 9. 0, based on five observations), and cancer in the children of male radiographers (RR 2. 7, 95 %CI 0. 9 - 6. 5, based on five observations) were noted. The numbers on which these risks are based are small and the findings should be interpreted cautiously. CONCLUSIONS: The postal methods developed for obtaining information about reproductive events and child health proved to be reliable in men, as well as in women. Overall, the findings for medical radiographers are reassuring. Dose-response relations could not, however, be examined as long term dose records of radiographers are not routinely kept in an accessible form...|$|E
