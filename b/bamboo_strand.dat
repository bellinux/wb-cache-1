50|$|Dan Smith and James Fong founded Smith & Fong in 1989 as a design/manufacturer of art-craft quality bamboo pieces. The company's puzzle boxes, trays and tea {{canisters}} {{were sold}} at Gump's in San Francisco, the New York Museum of Modern Art, the Chicago Art Institute and other boutiques and retailers nationwide. Four years later Smith & Fong converted a Chinese tea-processing plant to produce bamboo flooring and {{worked out a}} distribution agreement with a Bay Area-based flooring distributor. Under the name Plyboo, Smith & Fong was the first company to bring bamboo flooring to the US market. The first product was an amber flat-grain flooring that is still in stock today. In 1996 Angus Stocks joined Smith & Fong as an equity partner. The company leased its own space and took possession of its inventory. A second color of bamboo flooring (natural) was added, and the company introduced architectural-grade bamboo plywood to the marketplace. Smith & Fong incorporated in 1997 and spent {{the remainder of the}} 1990s adding more bamboo flooring and plywood options to its Plyboo offerings. In 2000 the company launched <b>bamboo</b> <b>strand</b> flooring; in 2001 Smith & Fong introduced coconut palm plywood and flooring under the Durapalm brand, and bamboo plywood production moved to a 4’x8’ dimension.|$|E

Three layered boards {{were made from}} bamboo and water hyacinth which <b>bamboo</b> <b>strand</b> was used as face/back layer, and water hyacinth strand was used as core layer.

40|$|Self-assembly of {{colloidal}} spheres is {{the most}} frequently used method for structural colors, but the chroma of the structural colors is usually so low that people cannot observe it under natural conditions. This paper presents a facile method for fabrications of vivid structural colors by doping carbon black into the self-assembly of colloidal polymer spheres and nanosilica particles. This approach can generate very gorgeous structural colors which can be very easily seen under natural conditions. The fabrication conditions for the self-assembly of composite dispersions of polymer/silica/carbon black were optimized to obtain colloidal crystals with vivid colors. Thus, robust mechanical properties, large-scale, and brilliant structural colors can guarantee the obtained crystal films to find practical applications, which are demonstrated {{by the fact that the}} successful applications of structural colors beautify the original simple and tedious surface of <b>bamboo</b> <b>strand</b> board (BSB) ...|$|E
40|$|Frictional co-efficient, impact quality; {{dielectric}} {{quality and}} compound resistance examination of bamboo/glass strands strengthened epoxy half breed composites were considered. Two distinctive crossover composites, for example, treated and untreated bamboo filaments were manufactured {{and impact of}} soluble base treatment of the <b>bamboo</b> <b>strands</b> on these properties were additionally concentrated on. It was watched that, effect quality and frictional co-proficient properties of the half and half composites increment with expansion in glass fiber content. These properties observed to be higher when salt treated bamboo filaments were utilized {{as a part of}} the half breed composites. It is watched that, concoction resistance was fundamentally increments for all chemicals with the exception of carbon tetrachloride. The disposal of nebulous hemi-cellulose with salt treatment prompting higher crystallinity of the bamboo filaments with antacid treatment may in charge of these perceptions. The impact of salt treatment on the holding between glass/bamboo composites was additionally concentrated on. Checking electron magnifying lens (SEM) were additionally directed on the cross segments of broke surfaces with a specific end goal to rate the execution crossover composites were likewise conferred bear natural products...|$|R
40|$|Thermal {{conductivity}} {{measurements of}} various engineered bamboo products, including laminated <b>bamboo,</b> <b>bamboo</b> oriented <b>strand</b> board, laminated <b>bamboo</b> esterilla sheet and bamboo veneer board, using the transient plane source (TPS) technique on a Hot DiskTM Thermal Constants Analyser. The materials were obtained as 10 - 20 mm thick panels, 200 - 400 mm square. The fibre orientation and layer configuration (including relative {{thickness of the}} layers) of the different products is presented in Table 1, and qualitatively visible in Fig. 2 of the published paper. For the products used here, laminated bamboo and bamboo veneer board are comprised of Moso bamboo (Phyllostachys pubescens), while <b>bamboo</b> oriented <b>strand</b> board and laminated bamboo esterilla sheet of Guadua (Guadua angustifolia). Some of the products were also obtained with environmental-protective treatments and external, micro-thickness coatings, as is necessary when using the products for exterior use. The volumetric composition, in terms of solid cell wall material, air and polymer matrix, is also estimated for the various products. Finally, considering bamboo and wood composites as three-phase composites, the trend between thermal conducitvity and density is modelled using various composite structure-property relations, including the Rule of Mixtures, Halpin-Tsai equations, C-S and E-S models. A template for the modelling is also presented. This work {{was supported by the}} EPSRC [grant number EP/K 023403 / 1], Leverhulme Trust and Newton Trust...|$|R

30|$|As a {{promising}} wood substitute, bamboo’s structural forms {{in which it}} can be used are limited due to the diameter of the bamboo culm and the low rigidity of the bamboo. To solve these problems, modern industrial bamboo materials appeared in different forms, such as Glubam [1, 2], parallel <b>bamboo</b> <b>strand</b> lumber (PBSL) [3, 4], laminated bamboo lumber (LBL) [5 – 10], and so on. Bamboo tubes can be disassembled into bamboo filament bundles by passing them through a roller press crusher and then gluing it together with adhesive to form certifiable structural members. The composite material is called PBSL [3, 4]. As for LBL [5 – 10], original bamboo tubes can be disassembled into thin flat laminae first and then laminated together with adhesive to form certifiable structural members. Both the cross section and length can be controlled freely in the factory, and thus, LBL is competitive with commonly used building materials, whilst also having renewable characteristics.|$|E
30|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of density and layer structure on the mechanical properties and dimensional stability of strandboard manufactured from moso bamboo (Phyllostachys pubescens). The strandboard was fabricated in a laboratory at five densities and three different structures including a randomly oriented homogenous board, a unidirectionally oriented homogenous board, and a three-layered board with a cross-oriented core layer (BOSB). <b>Bamboo</b> <b>strand</b> alignment distribution could be predicted using the von Mises distribution function. Bending properties increased with increasing density and were affected by layer structure. The modulus of rupture (MOR) of the threelayered board in the parallel direction increased remarkably compared with the random board MOR; in the perpendicular direction, it exhibited less strength reduction. Elastic properties of the three-layered board could be predicted using elastic constants of the unidirectional board. Internal bond strength (IB) was greatly affected by density, but the layer structure effect did not appear in IB. Linear expansion per unit moisture change ranged from 0.017 to 0.022 for random and three-layered boards; these values are comparable with or lower than values for commercial board.|$|E
40|$|It is {{the first}} time to {{fabricate}} and apply responsive colloidal crystal (CC) films on biocomposite material - <b>bamboo</b> <b>strand</b> board (BSB). The responsive film can be easily prepared directly through the self-assembly of soft colloidal polymer spheres containing hydrophilic monomers at ambient pressure and temperature without complicate equipment. In this approach, soft colloidal polymer spheres are synthesized by emulsion polymerization using polymerizable emulsifier. Then, the polymer latex is loaded onto the surface of BSB. The colloidal polymer spheres can directly self-assemble into a robust and transparent colloidal crystal (CC) film on BSB. Neither soft matrix nor posttreatment is needed. Compared with the traditional responsive CC, the polymer film on BSB not only had sensitive response behaviors but also had good reversibility and mechanical strength, which would provide a new method for fabrication and application of responsive CC. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Searching for {{materials}} to provide proper housing with less emission and low energy becomes an urgent demand with the ever-growing population. Bamboo {{has gained a}} reputation as an ecofriendly, highly renewable source of material. Parallel <b>Strand</b> <b>Bamboo</b> (PSB) is a new biocomposite made of bamboo strips which has superiority performances than wood products. It has attracted considerable interests as a sustainable alternative for more traditional building materials. But the mechanical performance study of PSB as construction materials is still inadequate. Also, the structural behavior of PSB is not quite understood as conventional construction materials, which results in the difficulties to predict the performances of PSB structural members. To achieve this purpose, 4 -point bending experiments for PSB beams were carried out. The flexural performances, mode of failure in bending, and the damage mechanism of PSB beams were investigated in this paper...|$|R
30|$|To {{evaluate}} the mechanical performance under two eccentric compression directions, 80 laminated bamboo lumber (LBL) column specimens were tested and analysed. Mechanical properties along two directions were compared. Bamboo nodes and drill hole {{are two main}} failure reasons for the specimens under two eccentric directions. More crack layers appeared for radial eccentric direction group specimens due to the layer structure. No matter which eccentric directions they are, the lateral deflection curves {{are close to the}} sine line, and the strain across the cross section of the LBL column for each specimen is basically linear throughout the loading process, following standard normal section bending theory. The mechanical properties for two directions are similar with each other and could follow the same design rules. Although the mechanical properties are similar for both LBL columns and parallel <b>bamboo</b> <b>strand</b> lumber (PBSL) columns as a whole, there are still some clear performance differences between the two kinds of materials. Combined all the test data under two eccentric directions, an equation for calculating the radial eccentricity influencing coefficient φ_e of LBL columns is proposed. The calculation results obtained from the equations give a good agreement with the test results.|$|E
