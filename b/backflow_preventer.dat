50|$|A {{more complex}} valve that accomplishes {{much the same}} purpose is the <b>backflow</b> <b>preventer.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Every {{potable water}} system that {{supplies}} a fixture or tank {{that is not}} subject to pressures above atmospheric shall be protected against back-siphonage by a <b>backflow</b> <b>preventer.</b>|$|E
50|$|Back {{pressure}} can force an undesirable contaminant to enter potable water piping. Sources of back pressure may be boilers, heat exchanging equipment, power washing equipment, fire sprinklers, or pumps {{in the water}} distribution system. In some cases {{there may be an}} almost continuous risk of overcoming the static water pressure in the piping. To reduce the risk of contamination, a <b>backflow</b> <b>preventer</b> can be fitted. A <b>backflow</b> <b>preventer</b> is also important when potentially toxic chemicals are used, for instance for commercial/industrial descaling of boilers, or when chemical bleaches are used for residential power washing.|$|E
50|$|<b>Backflow</b> <b>preventers</b> are {{categorized}} {{into three}} groupings, an Assembly, a Device or a Method. With {{the exception of}} elimination, these are the only ways one can control backflow from taking place.|$|R
50|$|Whenever a {{flexible}} hose {{is connected to}} a drinkable water supply, the spigot or tap should be fitted with an approved backflow prevention device, to prevent contaminated water from being siphoned back, {{in the event of}} a pressure drop. Many water suppliers require this, and plumbing code may legally require permanently installed <b>backflow</b> <b>preventers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|...A {{significant}} amount of corrosion of fences is due to landscaper tools scratching fence coatings and irrigation sprinklers spraying these damaged fences. Recycled water typically has a higher salt content than potable drinking water, meaning {{that it is more}} corrosive than regular tap water. The same risk from damage and water spray exists for above ground piping and <b>backflow</b> <b>preventers.</b> Fiber glass covers, cages, and concrete footings have worked well to keep tools at an arm’s length. Even the location where your roof drain splashes down can matter. Drainage from a home’s roof valley can fall directly down onto a gas meter causing it’s piping to corrode at an accelerated rate reaching 50% wall thickness within 4 years. It is the same effect as a splash zone in the ocean or in a pool which has a lot of oxygen and agitation that can remove material as it corrodes.|$|R
5000|$|Where a hose bibb is {{installed}} outside a building, inside a garage, or {{where there is}} an identifiable risk of contamination, the potable water system shall be protected against backflow by a <b>backflow</b> <b>preventer.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A <b>backflow</b> <b>preventer</b> {{deals with}} {{protecting}} your potable water source from being contaminated by a reverse flow of foul water (ex: isolating your toilet's flush cistern and water supply from the toilet bowl water itself).|$|E
50|$|Backflow {{means the}} {{undesirable}} reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable water supply; a <b>backflow</b> <b>preventer</b> {{is designed to}} keep this from happening. Points at which a potable water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they must be carefully designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common location for a <b>backflow</b> <b>preventer</b> is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.|$|E
40|$|The {{stagnation}} {{of water}} in two of four hospital hot-water storage tanks found to contain Legionella pneumophila was reduced by keeping the two tanks continually on-line for 1 year. L. pneumophila colony counts in these two tanks fell quickly to low levels, whereas the organisms persisted in the two tanks that were not in use. L. pneumophila continued to be isolated from 50 to 100 % of the hospital showerheads which were sampled during this period. We also examined aerators and other hospital faucet fixtures which obstruct water flow. L. pneumophila was isolated from 22 of 30 faucet aerators and 2 of 16 vacuum breakers but not from 26 nonobstructed faucets or 6 <b>backflow</b> <b>preventers.</b> Over a 7 -month period, after nine faucet aerators were sterilized, 10 of 60 surveillance cultures revealed L. pneumophila, despite the inability to isolate the organism from the potable-water tanks in use. These data suggest that prevention of stagnation in hot-water tanks may be effective in reducing L. pneumophila concentrations in potable-water systems serving high-risk populations. We have also shown that faucet aerators, by providing a surface for L. pneumophila to colonize, can become secondary reservoirs for the organism in hospital plumbing...|$|R
5000|$|Where a {{potable water}} supply is {{connected}} to a boiler, tank, cooling jacket, lawn sprinkler system or other device where a non-potable fluid may be under pressure that is above atmospheric or the water outlet may be submerged in the non-potable fluid, the water supply shall be protected against backflow by a <b>backflow</b> <b>preventer.</b>|$|E
50|$|Most US jurisdictions now require bibcocks to have {{a vacuum}} breaker or <b>backflow</b> <b>preventer,</b> so that water cannot return through the bibcock from the hose. This {{prevents}} contamination of the building or public water system {{should there be a}} pressure drop. In the UK, water regulations require a double check valve; this is often incorporated within the body of the tap itself.|$|E
50|$|Alternatively, a {{specialized}} <b>backflow</b> <b>preventer</b> valve may be installed at strategic {{locations in the}} plumbing system wherever {{there is a risk}} of contaminated fluids entering the water supply pipes. These valves are used where there is not sufficient vertical clearance or physical space to install an air gap, or when pressurized operation or other factors rule out use of an air gap. Because these valves use moving parts, they are often required to be inspected or tested periodically.|$|E
5000|$|Sometimes {{called a}} check valve or a <b>backflow</b> <b>preventer,</b> a {{chemigation}} valve is an apparatus designed to protect water supplies from agricultural chemicals used during chemigation, the application of chemicals such as fertilizers and pesticides through irrigation water. [...] Most chemigation valves consist of a spring-loaded check valve, a low pressure drain, an air and vacuum relief valve, and an injection port for introducing the chemicals downstream of the check valve. Many chemigation valves also have a 4-inch inspection port so that a person can reach inside and feel if the check valve is still functional. Some governments {{require the use of}} two chemigation valves installed in series if hazardous chemicals are to be injected.|$|E

40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{part of the}} thesis deals with the hydraulics of heating systems. The aim of the project is a design of the heating and hot water preparation system for an apartment building. The building has 6 above-ground floors and 2 underground floors. Two different options of heating systems were designed, comparison and results are presented in the thesis. In the first case the heat source during the winter season and for water heating, where chosen two gas condensing boilers, situated in separated room on the second underground floor. In the second case, each apartment has its own gas condensing boiler. The experimental {{part of the project}} deals with measurements of pressure losses in water armatures used in heating systems. The aim of this part is the determination of coefficients of added resistance for uncontrolled elements, which are normally presented as tabular value. In thesis are presented results for a ball valve, <b>backflow</b> <b>preventer,</b> filter, for slide valve and thermostatic valve. Measurements for thermostatic valve where done with different settings and results are compared with parameters listed in the datasheet...|$|E
