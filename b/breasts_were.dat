5|$|Upgrading of {{the plant}} {{occurred}} several times. The Kesteven and Holland engines were overhauled in 1881 and 1883 respectively. Flow into the wheel pits was restricted by the provision of shuttles, and rising <b>breasts</b> <b>were</b> fitted on the outflow, so that the height at which the water was discharged could be varied as the water level in Vernatt's drain varied. Five new boilers, which could supply either engine, were fitted in 1883, and {{had been replaced by}} five more some time before 1928, for the new boilers failed in that year. The Kesteven engine had its scoop wheel removed, although the rest {{of the plant}} was not scrapped until 1952.|$|E
25|$|In the 14th century, necklines were lowered, {{clothes were}} {{tightened}} and <b>breasts</b> <b>were</b> once again flaunted. It {{was during the}} Renaissance period that the corset was born. <b>Breasts</b> <b>were</b> pushed up, pushed together and molded into firm protruding decorations that emphasized breasts to the maximum. In 1450, Agnès Sorel, mistress to Charles VII of France, is credited with starting a fashion when she wore deep low square décolleté gowns with fully bared breasts in the French court. Other aristocratic women of the time who were painted with breasts exposed included Simonetta Vespucci, whose portrait with exposed breasts was painted by Piero di Cosimo in c.1480.|$|E

40|$|The <b>breast</b> <b>is</b> an {{integral}} part of both the female and the male body. Its evolutionary role is the feeding of offspring, although in males it has no function and can be considered an atavistic remnant. <b>Breasts</b> <b>are</b> not essential for life as one can live without them, and in the present era they are not essential for the feeding of newborns since the advent of bottle feeding. However, <b>breasts</b> <b>are</b> important for the completeness of the body image and for sexuality, as well as typifying masculinity and femininity. Surgery of the <b>breasts</b> may <b>be</b> required in the case of disease or because the patient wishes to improve the body image or reverse the sequelae of disease. In this thesis different aspects of plastic surgery of the <b>breast</b> <b>are</b> explored. In the first two parts the female <b>breast</b> <b>is</b> approached from the aspects of breast reduction and breast augmentation. The third part focuses on an often overlooked issue, namely the male breast. The fourth part presents cases of breast reduction, augmentation and reconstruction in which out-of-the-box solutions were implemented...|$|R

25|$|During the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars, any garment {{associated}} with the aristocracy was frowned upon, including those with visible décolletage. The <b>breasts</b> <b>were</b> often supported by a tie below the bust, and extant bust-support garments ranged from soft stays to wrap-front items similar to sports bras. In 1814, the court and the corset returned.|$|E
25|$|In European pre-historic societies, {{sculptures of}} female figures with {{pronounced}} or highly exaggerated <b>breasts</b> <b>were</b> common. A typical {{example is the}} so-called Venus of Willendorf, one of many Paleolithic Venus figurines with ample hips and bosom.

25|$|In October 1932, the S.H. Camp and Company {{were the}} first to measure cup size by the letters of the alphabet, A, B, C, and D, though the letters {{represented}} how pendulous the <b>breasts</b> <b>were</b> and not their volume. Camp's advertising in the February 1933 issue of Corset and Underwear Review featured letter-labeled profiles of breasts. Cup sizes A through D were not intended to be used for larger-breasted women.|$|E
25|$|For women's dress, {{the day to}} day outfit of {{the skirt}} and jacket style were {{practical}} and tactful, recalling the working class woman. Women's fashions followed classical ideals, and tightly laced corsets were temporarily abandoned {{in favor of a}} high-waisted, natural figure. This natural figure was emphasized by being able to see the body beneath the clothing. Visible <b>breasts</b> <b>were</b> part of this classical look, and some characterized the breasts in fashion as solely aesthetic and sexual.|$|E
50|$|The base of each <b>breast</b> <b>is</b> {{attached}} to the chest by the deep fascia over the pectoralis major muscles. The space between the breast and the pectoralis major muscle, called retromammary space, gives mobility to the <b>breast.</b> Some <b>breasts</b> <b>are</b> mounted high upon the chest wall, are of rounded shape, and project almost horizontally from the chest. These features are common to girls {{and women in the}} early stages of thelarchic development (the sprouting of the breasts). In the high-breast configuration, the dome-shaped and the cone-shaped <b>breast</b> <b>is</b> affixed to the chest at the base, and weight is evenly distributed over the base area. In the low-breast configuration, a proportion of the <b>breast</b> weight <b>is</b> supported by the chest, against which rests the lower surface of the <b>breast,</b> thus <b>is</b> formed the inframammary fold (IMF). Because the base is deeply affixed to the chest, the weight of the <b>breast</b> <b>is</b> distributed over a greater area. This reduces the weight-bearing strain upon the chest, shoulder, and back muscles that bear the weight of the bust.|$|R
50|$|<b>Breast</b> abscesses <b>are</b> non-cancerous {{pockets of}} {{infection}} within the <b>breast.</b> They can <b>be</b> quite painful and cause the skin over the breast to turn red or feel hot or solid.

25|$|Generally, in the Middle Ages the <b>breasts</b> <b>were</b> {{minimized}} in {{dresses with}} straight bodices, full skirts and high necklines, designed primarily for function rather than emphasis on form. Late medieval dresses are fitted precisely and snugly {{to the body}} and function as breast support. Depictions of women in 14th- and 15th-century art show a high, rounded breast silhouette on women old and young, full-busted and small. This look is not possible without support. The 15th-century ideal form was small-breasted and full-figured, symbolizing abundance of fertility.|$|E
25|$|In February 1997 at the Brit Awards, Halliwell's Union Jack {{dress from}} the Spice Girls' live {{performance}} {{made all the}} front pages the next day. During the ceremony, Halliwell's <b>breasts</b> <b>were</b> exposed twice, causing controversy. In the same year, nude glamour shots of Halliwell taken earlier in her career were released, causing some scandal. According to the group's official documentary Giving You Everything, {{the rest of the}} group had been fully aware of Halliwell's glamour modelling past, but the photos still created friction inside the group when they were published.|$|E
25|$|With this Classical style {{came the}} {{willingness}} to expose the breast. With the new iconography of the Revolution {{as well as a}} change in emphasis on maternal breast-feeding, the chemise dress became a sign of the new egalitarian society. The style was simple and appropriate for the comfort of a pregnant or nursing woman as the <b>breasts</b> <b>were</b> emphasized and their availability was heightened. Maternity became fashionable and it was not uncommon for women to walk around with their breasts exposed. Some women took the “fashionable maternity” a step further and wore a “six-month pad” under their dress to appear pregnant.|$|E

25|$|In 1931 {{the family}} {{returned}} to San Francisco. Arnautoff's first significant work after returning was a mural {{on the wall}} of his studio, which he opened to the public. Shortly afterward, he completed his first mural commission, for the Palo Alto Medical Clinic in Palo Alto (where he had been a patient) in August of 1932. The unveiling of this mural caused a traffic jam and some controversy, in part because the mural showed a doctor examining a female patient whose bare <b>breasts</b> <b>were</b> at eye-level. Like his other works in the Bay Area, the murals were frescoes.|$|E
25|$|Yet in his research, McDonough {{also notes}} that Meyer's female {{characters}} were limited in how powerful they could appear; often the female lead is raped (Up! and Lorna) or brutally murdered (Beyond the Valley of the Dolls, Supervixens, Lorna and Blacksnake). While Russ Meyer may have championed powerful woman characters, he also forced them into violent and terrifying situations, making them prove their physical and mental strength against tremendous odds. He also ensured that women's <b>breasts</b> <b>were</b> at least semi-exposed during these ordeals for comic or erotic effect. Furthermore, according to frequent collaborator and longtime lover Kitten Natividad, Meyer's love of dominant women extended to his personal life, and he was almost always in a tumultuous relationship.|$|E
25|$|The <b>breasts</b> <b>were</b> {{contoured}} by layering the fat grafts {{into different}} levels within the breast, until achieving the desired breast form. The fat-graft injection technique allows the plastic surgeon precise control in accurately contouring the breastfrom the chest {{wall to the}} breast-skin envelopewith subcutaneous fat grafts to the superficial planes of the breast. This greater degree of breast sculpting is unlike the global augmentation realised with a breast implant emplaced below the breast or below the pectoralis major muscle, respectively expanding the retromammary space and the retropectoral space. The greatest proportion of the grafted fat usually is infiltrated to the pectoralis major muscle, then to the retropectoral space, and to the prepectoral space, (before and behind the pectoralis major muscle). Moreover, although fat grafting to the breast parenchyma usually is minimal, it is performed to increase the degree of projection of the bust.|$|E

25|$|Almost {{one year}} later, on July 5, 1968, the {{partially}} decomposed, mutilated {{body of a}} 20-year-old art student named Joan Elspeth Schell was found by construction workers on an Ann Arbor roadside. She had been raped, then stabbed 25 times with a knife estimated to have measured four inches in length. Several of these wounds had punctured her lungs, liver and carotid artery, with one additional wound inflicted behind her left ear fracturing her skull. In addition, her throat had been slashed, and her miniskirt then tied around her neck. Although Schell {{had been dead for}} several days, her entire lower body was in a remarkably preserved condition, whereas her head, shoulders and <b>breasts</b> <b>were</b> in an advanced state of decomposition, leading the pathologist to conclude her body had been stored in a naturally cool environment, but with the upper third of her body exposed to natural heat.|$|E
25|$|In 1978, on the RAI show C'era due Volte, her <b>breasts</b> <b>were</b> {{the first}} to be bared live on Italian TV. Staller {{appeared}} in her first hardcore pornographic film, Telefono rosso (Red telephone) in 1983. She produced the film together with Schicchi's company Diva Futura. Her memoirs were published as Confessioni erotiche di Cicciolina (Erotic confessions of Cicciolina) by Olympia Press of Milan in 1987. That same year she appeared in , called The Rise and Fall of the Roman Empress in the United States, co-starring John Holmes. The film would later create a furor when it was revealed that Holmes had tested positive for HIV prior to appearing in it. Staller has appeared nude in Playboy's editions in several countries. Her first Playboy appearance was in Argentina in March 1988. Other appearances for the magazine were in the U.S. (September 1990), Hungary (June 2005), Serbia (July 2005) and Mexico (September 2005).|$|E
25|$|During the 16th century, women's fashions with exposed <b>breasts</b> <b>were</b> {{common in}} society, from queens to common prostitutes, and {{emulated}} by all classes.

Low square décolleté styles were popular in England in the 17th century and even Queen Mary II and Henrietta Maria, wife of Charles I of England, were depicted with fully bared breasts; and architect Inigo Jones designed a masque costume for Henrietta Maria that fully revealed both of her breasts. During the fashions of the period 1795–1820, many women wore dresses that bared necks, bosoms and shoulders. Anne of Austria was known for wearing, along with female members of her court, very tight bodice and corsets that forced breasts together to make deeper cleavages, very low necklines that exposed breasts visible almost in entirety above the areola and pendants lying on the cleavage to highlight it.|$|E
