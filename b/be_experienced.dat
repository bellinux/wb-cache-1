5|$|Coatbridge is {{the home}} of 'Scotland's Noisiest Museum', Summerlee Heritage Park, which {{contains}} an insight into the life in industrial Coatbridge. A row of 1900s-1980s cottages, a working tram line and a real coal mine can all <b>be</b> <b>experienced</b> on site. The park is situated on the remains of one of Coatbridge's historic blast furnaces.|$|E
5|$|The {{pressure}} {{around the}} brain may rise, causing papilledema (swelling of the optic disc) which may <b>be</b> <b>experienced</b> as visual obscurations. In severely raised intracranial pressure, {{the level of}} consciousness is decreased, the blood pressure rises, the heart rate falls and the patient assumes an abnormal posture.|$|E
5|$|The {{series was}} shot using 35mm film. Warren {{said this was}} chosen over high-definition cameras due to the low light levels that would <b>be</b> <b>experienced</b> when filming in a world without {{electricity}} and during an autumn filming period, and over Super 16 due to high-definition transmission requirements.|$|E
5000|$|In phenomenology, empathy {{describes}} {{the experience of}} something from the other's viewpoint, without confusion between self and other. This draws on the sense of agency. In the most basic sense, this <b>is</b> the <b>experience</b> of the other's body and, in this sense, it <b>is</b> an <b>experience</b> of [...] "my body over there". In most other respects, however, the <b>experience</b> <b>is</b> modified so that what <b>is</b> <b>experienced</b> <b>is</b> <b>experienced</b> as being the other's experience; in <b>experiencing</b> empathy, what <b>is</b> <b>experienced</b> <b>is</b> not [...] "my" [...] experience, even though I <b>experience</b> it. Empathy <b>is</b> also {{considered to be the}} condition of intersubjectivity and, as such, the source of the constitution of objectivity.|$|R

30|$|For {{the second}} experiment, having already {{established}} that OT {{can serve as}} a reliable online proxy in healthy participants, we focused more directly on the categorical denials that disownership experiences occur. This time participants were advised as regards the phenomena under investigation and instructed to indicate OT for both ownership and disownership experiences. Again, ownership and disownership <b>were</b> <b>experienced</b> more quickly when stroking was synchronous than when it was not, and the more quickly ownership <b>was</b> <b>experienced</b> the more quickly disownership <b>was</b> <b>experienced.</b> Furthermore, rapidity of onset for both correlated with the experienced strength of the illusions. Thus, consistent with our conjecture, it seems that for standard versions of the RHI ownership and disownership might be intrinsically related: the degree to which ownership <b>is</b> <b>experienced</b> for the rubber hand, disownership <b>is</b> <b>experienced</b> for the biological hand. When the OT and the questionnaire data were conjoined, they augmented support for the view that disownership experiences do occur.|$|R
5|$|Three-quarters {{of people}} with LEMS also have {{disruption}} of the autonomic nervous system. This may <b>be</b> <b>experienced</b> as a dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, impaired sweating, and orthostatic hypotension (falls in blood pressure on standing, potentially leading to blackouts). Some report a metallic taste in the mouth.|$|E
5|$|Decompression {{sickness}} (DCS; {{also known}} as divers' disease, the bends or caisson disease) describes a condition arising from dissolved gases coming out of solution into bubbles inside the body on depressurisation. DCS most commonly refers to problems arising from underwater diving decompression (i.e., during ascent), but may <b>be</b> <b>experienced</b> in other depressurisation events such as emerging from a caisson, flying in an unpressurised aircraft at altitude, and extravehicular activity from spacecraft. DCS and arterial gas embolism are collectively referred to as decompression illness.|$|E
5|$|Each {{class is}} managed {{by one of}} eleven {{academic}} departments. Nine departments will <b>be</b> <b>experienced</b> by students {{before the end of}} their senior year, as one or more of their classes are mandatory for graduation. The other two departments are specialized courses; one involves the Culinary Arts, while the other involves a precollegiate form of ROTC. This system of Professional Learning Communities was designed by Illinois's former Adlai E. Stevenson High School principal, Richard Du Four.|$|E
50|$|If the {{production}} function contains only one input, then the output elasticity {{is also an}} indicator of the degree of returns to scale. If the coefficient of output elasticity is greater than 1, then production <b>is</b> <b>experiencing</b> increasing returns to scale. If the coefficient is less than 1, then production <b>is</b> <b>experiencing</b> decreasing returns to scale. If the coefficient is 1, then production <b>is</b> <b>experiencing</b> constant returns to scale. Note that returns to scale may change as the level of production changes.|$|R

5|$|Engine {{starting}} {{was achieved}} {{by a combination of}} compressed air and a hand-turned magneto; however, starting problems were encountered during pre-race testing at Calshot due to moisture in the air and water contamination of the fuel. A complicated test procedure was devised to ensure clean fuel for competition flights since more than 0.3% water content made it unusable. As expected, minor engine failures continued to <b>be</b> <b>experienced,</b> and to counter this engines and parts were transported at high speed between Derby and Calshot using an adapted Rolls-Royce Phantom I motor car. Travelling mostly after dark, this vehicle became known as the Phantom of The Night.|$|E
5|$|In 1942 Coastal Command's {{problems}} did not abate. Experienced {{crews were}} siphoned off to Malta, to undertake ASO against German and Italian shipping in the Mediterranean. Hudson, Blenheim and Beaufighter squadrons had shortfalls of 69, 28 and 20 aircrews by January 1942. The leftover crews, some 75 percent, were {{far off the}} 200 operational hours considered for a pilot to <b>be</b> <b>experienced.</b> Efficiency fell among squadrons. The mixing of experienced crews and the inexperienced damaged morale and accident rates increased.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the mining}} {{companies}} {{felt that the}} expected recovery {{would result in a}} labor shortage and challenge economic recovery. The government believed that if copper prices fell in the future, similar effects would <b>be</b> <b>experienced.</b> The colonial administration implemented two schemes to maintain the relationship of urban workers with their rural homelands. Health-service expenditures by rural relatives of urban workers were borne by the government, and the rural male migration of the working population was reduced.|$|E

5|$|The {{first section}} of the M54 was opened in 1975, then named the A5 Wellington bypass (bypassing one of the {{existing}} towns which formed part of Telford), but renumbered the M54 in 1983 when the motorway was extended. The bypass removed traffic from the heavily congested route through the urbanised areas of Oakengates and Wellington, and removed one of the country's most notorious bottlenecks at the Bucks Head crossroads, in Wellington; delays of up to six hours could <b>be</b> <b>experienced</b> in the summer months.|$|E
5|$|Aarhus {{has a large}} {{variety of}} {{restaurants}} and eateries offering food from cultures all over the world, especially Mediterranean and Asian, but also international gourmet cuisine, traditional Danish food and New Nordic Cuisine. Among the oldest restaurants are Rådhuscafeen (lit. The City Hall Café), opened in 1924, serving a menu of traditional Danish meals, and Peter Gift from 1906, a tavern with a broad beer selection and a menu of smørrebrød and other Danish dishes. In Aarhus, New Nordic can <b>be</b> <b>experienced</b> at Kähler Villa Dining, Hærværk and Domestic, but local produce can be had at many places, especially at the twice-weekly food markets in Frederiksbjerg. Arhus and the Central Denmark Region was selected as European Region of Gastronomy in 2017.|$|E
5|$|As {{the player}} makes choices {{throughout}} the game, the gameplay's plot is revealed. Besides affecting dialogue and story developments, {{the outcome of}} entire scenes (and in some cases, the outcome of scenes several chapters later) can be manipulated {{to a certain extent}} based on player choices. These choices are typically moral decisions made through Jodie's dialogue options, interventions with various characters, success or failure in her combat scenes, or psychic actions that the player chooses to have Aiden perform. Examples of choice-based outcomes are the chapter titled The Party, where the player is given the choice of unleashing brutal revenge toward a group of bullies or simply running away, and the chapter titled The Embassy, where the player can either engage in psychic information retrieval or can jeopardize the mission by forcing one of the guards to commit suicide. Choices also determine the finale of Beyond: Two Souls, as any number of possible plot endings can <b>be</b> <b>experienced</b> by the player.|$|E

5|$|Early in the storm's development, {{forecasting}} Erika's {{motion was}} difficult, with a persistent leftward bias in official forecasts. In response to Erika's threat, {{the government of}} Saint Martin first issued a tropical storm warning late on September 4. The next day, the respective governments of Antigua, Montserrat, Barbuda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Anguilla, Dominica, Guadeloupe, and Saint Barthélemy issued tropical storm warnings for their islands. When Erika's motion resulted in a path that would take it closer to the islands, all of the aforementioned islands excluding Guadeloupe upgraded the tropical storm warning to a hurricane warning. In addition, a hurricane watch was issued for the British and United States Virgin Islands, as well as Puerto Rico. In public advisories, the National Hurricane Center stated tropical storm conditions were likely to <b>be</b> <b>experienced</b> in the Azores. Early forecasts anticipated {{a threat to the}} island of Bermuda.|$|E
5|$|He awaited {{execution}} of his sentence at the Union Correctional Institution. Shortly {{after the trial}} and conviction, his wife Debra filed for divorce and their marriage was formally dissolved a year later. Chandler was no longer allowed to see his daughter Whitney, and, in accordance with his ex-wife's wishes, he {{was not allowed to}} see later photographs of her. In July 2008, Chandler was on Florida's short list of executions. Profiling experts speculated that Chandler may have killed previously, {{based on the belief that}} a first-time killer would not <b>be</b> <b>experienced,</b> or bold enough, to abduct and kill three women at once. Chandler remained a suspect in the 1982 murder of a woman found floating off Anna Maria Island until 2011, when the body was identified as 29-year-old Amy Hurst and her husband was arrested and charged with her murder. Chandler was never charged with another murder. All of his appeals of his 1994 conviction were denied; his last was in May 2007.|$|E
5|$|Many mental states seem to <b>be</b> <b>experienced</b> subjectively in {{different}} ways by different individuals. And it is characteristic of a mental state that it has some experiential quality, e.g. of pain, that it hurts. However, the sensation of pain between two individuals may not be identical, since {{no one has a}} perfect way to measure how much something hurts or of describing exactly how it feels to hurt. Philosophers and scientists therefore ask where these experiences come from. The existence of cerebral events, in and of themselves, cannot explain why they are accompanied by these corresponding qualitative experiences. The puzzle of why many cerebral processes occur with an accompanying experiential aspect in consciousness seems impossible to explain.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} symptom of IIH is headache, which occurs {{in almost all}} (92–94%) cases. It is {{characteristically}} worse in the morning, generalized in character and throbbing in nature. It {{may be associated with}} nausea and vomiting. The headache can be made worse by any activity that further increases the intracranial pressure, such as coughing and sneezing. The pain may also <b>be</b> <b>experienced</b> in the neck and shoulders. Many have pulsatile tinnitus, a whooshing sensation in one or both ears (64–87%); this sound is synchronous with the pulse. Various other symptoms, such as numbness of the extremities, generalized weakness, loss of smell, and loss of coordination, are reported more rarely; none are specific for IIH. In children, numerous nonspecific signs and symptoms may be present.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} and religious status spurred growth so in 1477 the defensive earthen ramparts, ringing the town since the Viking age, were abandoned to accommodate expansion. Parts of the ramparts {{are still in}} existence today and can <b>be</b> <b>experienced</b> as steep slopes at the riverside and they have also survived in some place names of the inner city, including the streets of Volden (The Rampart) and Graven (The Moat). Aarhus grew {{to become one of}} the largest cities in the country by the early 16thcentury. In 1657, octroi was imposed in larger Danish cities which changed the layout and face of Aarhus over the following decades. Wooden city walls were erected to prevent smuggling, with gates and toll booths on the major thoroughfares, Mejlgade and Studsgade. The city gates funnelled most traffic through a few streets where merchant quarters were built.|$|E
5|$|The {{story begins}} {{branching}} into different timelines that can <b>be</b> <b>experienced</b> in any order, {{depending on the}} choices made by the player.

Depending on the given timeline, the characters also discover either the murdered body of an old woman or antimatter bombs. The other participants' backstories are explored: Luna is a humanoid robot, tasked with maintaining the Nonary Game; K was raised by Zero Sr. inside of the facility; Tenmyouji willingly joined the game, together with his adopted grandson Quark, after being promised a chance to find a certain woman; Alice and Clover are government secret agents tasked with stopping the religious cult Free the Soul; and Dio is a member of Free the Soul.|$|E
