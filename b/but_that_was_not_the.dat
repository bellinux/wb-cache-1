25|$|On April 1, 2016 just as {{the show}} {{finished}} airing, a post on the BT Toronto's Facebook page was made in regards to Jennifer Valentyne not {{being a part of}} the show anymore. With it being April Fool's Day many people thinking this was a joke <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> case. Kevin and Dina both addressed this over Twitter confirming that this was in fact true to fans asking. Later that evening, on Jennifer's Facebook page she released a statement confirming that it was in fact true. BT decided to eliminate all Live Eye's across the country to give fans more of what they wanted. Many offered love and support over various social media accounts including Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to Jennifer {{and the rest of the}} BT crew.|$|E

(In {{the work}} of Hecke and Heilbronn, the only L-functions that occur are those {{attached}} to imaginary quadratic characters, {{and it is only}} for those L-functions that GRH is true or GRH is false is intended; a failure of GRH for the L-function of a cubic Dirichlet character would, strictly speaking, mean GRH is false, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> kind of failure of GRH that Heilbronn had in mind, so his assumption was more restricted than simply GRH is false.) ...|$|E
2500|$|On 19 January 2009, Bellamy {{completed}} his move to Manchester City on a four-and-a-half-year deal {{for an undisclosed}} fee believed to be around ¬£14 million On signing for the club his new manager Mark Hughes stated, [...] "I'm sure Craig will be excellent for us, I think people will soon see why I wanted {{to bring him to}} the club. The fee that gets mentioned is invariably the wrong figure, it keeps being quoted as ¬£19million, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> price we paid for him." [...] This took his career total of transfers to ¬£47m. Bellamy became the second major signing by Manchester City of the transfer window after Wayne Bridge from Chelsea.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1930s active {{hydrogen}} {{was found}} to be hydrogen with hydrogen sulfide contamination, and scientists stopped believing in triatomic hydrogen. Quantum mechanical calculations showed that neutral H3 was unstable but that ionised H3+ could exist. [...] When the concept of isotopes [...] came along, people such as Bohr then thought there may be an eka-hydrogen with atomic weight 3. [...] This idea was later proven with the existence of tritium, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> explanation of why molecular weight 3 was observed in mass spectrometers. J. J. Thomson later believed that the molecular weight 3 molecule he observed was Hydrogen deuteride. In the Orion nebula lines were observed that were attributed to nebulium which could have been the new element eka-hydrogen, especially when its atomic weight was calculated as near 3. [...] Later this was shown to be ionised nitrogen and oxygen.|$|E
2500|$|In August 2009, Clinton {{embarked}} on her longest trip yet, {{to a number}} of stops in Africa. On August 10, 2009, at a public event in Kinshasa, a Congolese student asked her what her husband, [...] "Mr Clinton", thought of a Chinese trade deal with the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Clinton looked irritated at the question and replied, [...] "Wait, {{you want me to tell}} you what my husband thinks? My husband is not the secretary of state, I am. So you ask my opinion, I will tell you my opinion. I am not going to be channeling my husband." [...] The incident was played in newsrooms around the world. Clinton aides suggested there might have been a mistranslation, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> case; however the student had later apologized to her, saying he had meant to ask what [...] "Mr Obama" [...] thought.|$|E
2500|$|... ‚Äò‚Ä¶ Gladstone {{had made}} a great mistake in giving the country back after Majuba before having {{defeated}} the Boers. [...] The Boers throughout South Africa had a vague aspiration for a great republic throughout South Africa and Gladstone had by his action encouraged this aspiration in them. [...] The British Government knew of this but had always remained sitting still, but in his [...] opinion the time had now come to make an end of this ‚Äòby striking a blow‚Äô. [...] When he [...] left London he was instructed that England would be satisfied if the South African Republic should become a richer Orange Free State; <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> intention of the South African Republic, to play a humble role. [...] She would {{have nothing to do}} with the paramount influence of England but had always tried to play a role among the nations and had, with a view to that, always coquetted with the European powers. [...] In his [...] opinion the time had come to make an end of all this by showing the Boers that England was master in South Africa.‚Äô ...|$|E

25|$|This <b>is</b> a book <b>that</b> contradicts {{itself a}} hundred times; <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a {{criticism}} of it, because its author thinks contradictions are a sign of intellectual ferment and vitality. This <b>is</b> a book <b>that</b> systematically distorts and selects historical evidence; <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a criticism, because its author thinks <b>that</b> all interpretations <b>are</b> biased, and she regards it as her duty {{to pick and choose}} her facts to favor her own brand of politics. This is a book full of vaporous, French-intellectual prose that makes Teilhard de Chardin sound like Ernest Hemingway by comparison; <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a criticism, because the author likes that sort of prose and has taken lessons in how to write it, and she thinks that plain, homely speech is part of a conspiracy to oppress the poor.|$|R
2500|$|With Roadmaster being a {{completely}} new model, and with Buick having totally restyled its entire line for 1936, {{one might have expected}} only modest changes for 1937. <b>But</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> case. Buick was the only GM car, along with the Chevrolet Standard, to retain its basic 1934 styling for 1935, so the 1936 re-style merely caught Buick up {{with the rest of the}} GM marques. [...] For 1937, Buick moved to newly re-styled bodies along with all other GM cars. The Roadmaster gained a divided grille with horizontal bars. The center section of the grille was painted to match the body of the car. Fenders became squared off and the headlight shells were gracefully streamlined. Overall height fell by [...] without sacrificing interior room. A new carburetor and revised camshaft raised engine horsepower to 130. The engine also received a new intake manifold, oil pump, cooling system and a quieter overhead valve mechanism. A formal sedan, featuring a roll-down glass partition between the front and rear compartments, was added to the Roadmaster line for $1,641, of which 452 were sold. The price of the sedan was raised to $1,518, and that of the phaeton to $1,856, or by 21 percent and 19 percent respectively. Nevertheless, overall Roadmaster sales increased to 16,129.|$|E
2500|$|While the bus {{was leaving}} San Fernando, the bus driver saw at a {{distance}} that there were several trucks blocking the highway up ahead, {{and that there were}} several men wearing ski-masks and holding AR-15s. The gunmen ordered the bus to stop, and the bus driver obeyed. The cartel members approached the bus pointing their guns and yelling, [...] "Open the door, asshole! Move, you son of a bitch, unless you want me to shoot you dead." [...] The chauffeur, trembling, opened the door for the gunmen, who quickly stormed the bus as soon as the door was opened. [...] "You are all fucked," [...] yelled one of the gunmen to the people on board; the passengers were frightened, and some of them cried, thinking it was simply a regular armed robbery. <b>But</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> case this time. The cartel members then ordered the bus driver to drive the bus deep into a dirt road for about ten kilometers before reaching a plain area, [...] "in the middle of nowhere." [...] In the area there were about twenty luxurious trucks and three passenger buses, some of them with bullet holes, flat tires, and broken windows. The driver was then ordered to stop the bus, and all the men were then told to descend from the vehicle. They were asked to form a line, and the cartel members began to organize them from youngest to oldest and from strongest to weakest. Those who looked old or weak were separated from the group, tied from their feet, and then taken elsewhere. Those who were left were ordered to take off their shirts and remain where they were. A man wearing black military uniform, a bulletproof vest, and a kit belt was called from the trucks that were parked nearby. All of the triggermen referred to him as Commander 40, better known as Miguel Trevi√±o Morales, one of the top leaders of Los Zetas. The man approached the passengers that were lined up in front of him, and said in an energetic voice: [...] "Let's see, assholes. Who wants to live?" [...] But no one answered. One teenager accidentally wet himself out of nervousness, and Commander 40 killed him with a shot to the head. Trevi√±o Morales then yelled: [...] "I will ask all of you one more time. Who the fuck wants to live?" [...] All of the men raised their hands. [...] "Good. We will test your abilities to see how capable you are. If you make it, you'll survive; if you do not, you're fucked." [...] Commander 40 then asked his henchmen to bring the bats and clubs, and each of the passengers was given one. He then said, [...] "Look, each of you will get in pairs and beat the shit out of each other. Those who survive will work for Los Zetas, those who don't, well, they're fucked." [...] All of the passengers were shocked at the order the individual in front of them gave them. Everyone got their bats and clubs, joined up as a pair, and stared at their partners nervously. Trevi√±o Morales then said: [...] "Now beat the shit out of each other." ...|$|E
