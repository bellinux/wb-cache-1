40|$|The tensile {{strength}} of composite plates with unidirectional cords {{depends on the}} way the load is distributed within the matrix by the cords. Of particular interest is the effect of a <b>broken</b> <b>edge</b> cord or a number of in-line fractured edge cords on the breaking strength of the plate when it is subjected to axial loading. This paper describes a model for estimating the maximum allowable number of broken tensile members in a bonded composite plate before catastro-phic failure occurs. The model has application to the analysis of steel-cord and Kevlar-cord elastomer belts containing <b>broken</b> <b>edge</b> cords as the result of impact damage. ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{his actions}} became swift--and Yaqui seldom moved swiftly. The fact {{impressed}} Gale. The Indian searched the level floor under the shelf. He gathered up handfuls of small black stones, and thrust them at Gale. Their weight made Gale start, {{and then he}} trembled. The Indian's next move was {{to pick up a}} piece of weathered rock and throw it against the wall. It broke. He snatched up parts, and showed the <b>broken</b> <b>edges</b> to Gale. They contained yellow steaks, dull glints, faint tracings of green. It was gold.|$|E
60|$|There were peaks like castles, spires {{like the}} fretted {{stonework}} of Indian minarets, {{wrought by the}} hand of nature out of an awful cold purity, and mountains which resembled nothing I had ever seen or dreamed of, banded white with <b>broken</b> <b>edges</b> of green by winding glaciers; while sombered forests, every trunk in which the surveyor said exceeded two hundred feet in height, were wrapped about their knees. It was a scene of plutonic grandeur, weirdly impressive under {{the first of the}} light, with a stamp upon it of unearthly glory, and we drew in our breath when a great peak behind us glowed for a moment rosy red and then faded into saffron, just before a long shaft of radiance turned the whiteness on its shoulders into incandescence.|$|E
60|$|The beds which {{present the}} most {{definite}} appearances of abrupt fracture, {{are those of}} that grey or black limestone above described (Chap. x. ยง 4), formed {{into a number of}} thin layers or leaves, commonly separated by filmy spreadings of calcareous sand, hard when dry, but easily softened by moisture; the whole, considered as a mass, easily friable, though particular beds may be very thick and hard. Imagine a layer of such substance, three or four thousand feet thick, broken with a sharp crash through the middle, and one piece of it thrown up as in Fig. 11. It is evident that the first result of such a shock would be a complete shattering of the consistence of the <b>broken</b> <b>edges,</b> and that these would fall, some on the instant, and others tottering and crumbling away from time to time, until the cliff had got in some degree settled into a tenable form. The fallen fragments would lie in a confused heap at the bottom, hiding perhaps one half of its height, as in Fig. 12; the top of it, wrought into somewhat less ragged shape, would thenceforth submit itself only to the gradual influences of time and storm.|$|E

6000|$|It must be allowed, at starting, {{that time}} enough has elapsed, and events enough have happened, since our {{supposed}} mud began first to become slate, to allow of many and strange transformations. For these slates {{are found in}} the oldest beds of rocks, save one series, in the known world; and it is notorious that the older and lower the beds in which the slates are found, the better, that is, the more perfectly elaborate, is the slate. The best slates of Snowdon--I must confine myself to the district which I know personally--{{are found in the}} so-called [...] "Cambrian" [...] beds. Below these beds but one series of beds is as yet known in the world, called the [...] "Laurentian." [...] They occur, to a thickness of some eighty thousand feet, in Labrador, Canada, and the Adirondack mountains of New York: but their representatives in Europe are, as far as is known only {{to be found in the}} north-west highlands of Scotland, and in the island of Lewis, which consists entirely of them. And it is to be remembered, as a proof of their inconceivable antiquity, that they have been upheaved and shifted long before the Cambrian rocks were laid down [...] "unconformably" [...] on their worn and <b>broken</b> <b>edges.</b>|$|E
60|$|But here what accentuates this arid {{freshness}} is the fragmentary look of {{the continual}} reconstruction and change. The strong daylight finds everywhere the <b>broken</b> <b>edges</b> of things, {{and the sort of}} hues we see in newly-turned earth or the white sections of trees. And it is in this respect that the local colour can literally be taken as local character. For New York considered in itself is primarily a place of unrest, and those who sincerely love it, as many do, love it for the romance of its restlessness. A man almost looks at a building as he passes to wonder whether it will be there when he comes back from his walk; and the doubt is part of an indescribable notion, as of a white nightmare of daylight, which is increased by the very numbering of the streets, with its tangle of numerals which at first makes an English head reel. The detail is merely a symbol; and when he is used to it he can see that it is, like the most humdrum human customs, both worse and better than his own. '271 West 52nd Street' is the easiest of all addresses to find, but the hardest of all addresses to remember. He who is, like myself, so constituted as necessarily to lose any piece of paper he has particular reason to preserve, will find himself wishing the place were called 'Pine Crest' or 'Heather Crag' like any unobtrusive villa in Streatham. But his sense of some sort of incalculable calculations, as of the vision of a mad mathematician, is rooted in a more real impression. His first feeling that his head is turning round is due to something really dizzy in the movement of a life that turns dizzily like a wheel. If there be in the modern mind something paradoxical that can find peace in change, it is here that it has indeed built its habitation or rather is still building and unbuilding it. One might fancy that it changes in everything and that nothing endures but its invisible name; and even its name, as I have said, seems to make a boast of novelty.|$|E
6000|$|... ยง 4. Accordingly, these slaty coherents, being usually {{composed}} of many elements imperfectly united, are {{also for the}} most part grey, black, or dull purple; those which are purest and hardest verging most upon purple, and some of them in certain lights displaying, on their smooth sides, very beautiful zones and changeful spaces of grey, russet, and obscure blue. But even this beauty is strictly connected with their preservation of such firmness of form as properly belongs to them; it is seen chiefly on their even and silky surfaces; less, in comparison, upon their <b>broken</b> <b>edges,</b> and is lost altogether when they are reduced to powder. They then form a dull grey dust, or, with moisture, a black slime, of great value as a vegetative earth, but of intense ugliness when it occurs in extended spaces in mountain scenery. And thus the slaty coherents are often employed to form those landscapes of which the purpose appears to be to impress us with a sense of horror and pain, as a foil to neighboring scenes of extreme beauty. There are many spots among the inferior ridges of the Alps, such as the Col de Ferret, the Col d'Anterne, and the associated ranges of the Buet, which, though commanding prospects of great nobleness, are themselves very nearly types of all that is most painful to the human mind. Vast wastes of mountain ground, covered here and there with dull grey grass, or moss, but breaking continually into black banks of shattered slate, all glistening and sodden with slow tricklings of clogged, incapable streams; the snow water oozing through them in a cold sweat, and spreading itself in creeping stains among their dust; ever and anon a shaking here and there, and a handful or two of their particles or flakes trembling down, one sees not why, into more total dissolution, leaving a few jagged teeth, like the edges of knives eaten away by vinegar, projecting through the half-dislodged mass from the inner rock, keen enough to cut the hand or foot that rests on them, yet crumbling as they wound, and soon sinking again into the smooth, slippery, glutinous heap, looking like a beach of black scales of dead fish, cast ashore from a poisonous sea, and sloping away into foul ravines, branched down immeasurable slopes of barrenness, where the winds howl and wander continually, and the snow lies in wasted and sorrowful fields, covered with sooty dust, that collects in streaks and stains at the bottom of all its thawing ripples. I know no other scenes so appalling as these in storm, or so woful in sunshine.|$|E

60|$|In {{that form}} at least I see him, and no revival {{of those years}} so puts to me the {{interesting}} question, so often aimlessly returned upon in later life, {{of the amount of}} truth in this or that case of young confidence in a glory to come--for another than one's self; of the likelihood of the wonders so flatteringly forecast. Many of our estimates were monstrous magnifications--though doing us even at that more good than harm; so that one isn't even sure that the happiest histories were to have been those of the least liberal mistakes. I like at any rate to think of our easy overstrainings--the possible flaw in many of which was not indeed to be put to the proof. That was the case for the general, and for every particular, impression of Will Temple, thanks to his early death in battle--at Chancellorsville, 1863; he having, among the quickened forces of the time, and his father's record helping him, leaped to a captaincy in the regular Army; but I cling to the idea that the siftings and sortings of life, had he remained subject to them, would still have left him the lustre that blinds and subdues. I even do more, at this hour; I ask myself, while his appearance and my personal feeling about it live for me again, what possible aftertime could have kept up the pitch of my sentiment--aftertime either of his or of mine. Blest beyond others, I think as we look back, the admirations, even the fondest (and which indeed were not of their nature fond?) that were not to know to their cost the inevitable test or strain; they are almost the only ones, of the true high pitch, that, without <b>broken</b> <b>edges</b> or other tatters to show, fold themselves away entire and secure, even as rare lengths of precious old stuff, in the scented chest of our savings. So great misadventure have too often known at all events certain of those that were to come to trial. The others are the residual, those we must keep when we can, so to be sure at least of a few, sacrificing as many possible mistakes and misproportions as need be to pay but for two or three of them. There could be no mistake about Gus Barker, who threw himself into the fray, that is into the cavalry saddle, as he might into a match at baseball (football being then undreamt of), and my last reminiscence of whom is the sight of him, on a brief leave for a farewell to his Harvard classmates after he had got his commission, crossing with two or three companions the expanse of Harvard Square that faced the old Law School, of which I found myself for that year (1862-63) a singularly alien member. I was afterwards sharply to regret the accident by which I on that occasion missed speech of him; but my present vision of his charming latent agility, which any motion showed, of his bright-coloured wagging head and of the large gaiety of the young smile that made his handsome teeth shine out, is after all the years but the more happily uneffaced. The point of all which connections, however, is that they somehow managed to make in the parental view no straight links for us with the matter-of-course of college. There were accidents too by the aid of which they failed of this the more easily. It comes to me that, for my own part, I thought of William at the time as having, or rather as so much more than having, already graduated; the effect of contact with his mind and talk, with the free play of his spirit and the irrepressible brush of his humour, couldn't have been greater had he carried off fifty honours. I felt in him such authority, so perpetually quickened a state of intellect and character, that the detail or the literal side of the question never so much as came up for me: I must have made out that to plenty of graduates, or of the graduating, nothing in the nature of such appearances attached. I think of our father moreover as no less affected by a like impression; so extremely, so immensely disposed do I see him to generalise his eldest son's gifts as by the largest, fondest synthesis, and not so much proceed upon them in any one direction as proceed from them, as it were, in all.|$|E

50|$|Three {{distinct}} benthic communities {{occur on}} the Crown reef, depending on topography, sediment cover and wave energy.The large shallow areas of the shoal have the highest abundance of zooxanthellate hard corals,the encrusting zooxanthellate sponge, Suberites kelleri and the hard corals Stylophora pistillata and Pocillopora spp., which appear to be tolerant of the high energy environment. This community has the lowest abundance of red foliose algae and occupies the reef top, inshore and offshore slopes of the northern, middle and southern regions at depths from 10 to 14 m.A second community inhabits the steep edges of the shoal and has larger proportion of Polychaetes, the soft coral Eleutherobia aurea, and the sponge Spheciospongia globularis. This is the only community in which Suberites kelleri is absent. This community covers the high to medium relief inshore and offshore walls and <b>broken</b> <b>edges</b> of the middle and northern regions in the 14 to 20m (46 to 66ft) depth range.A third community lives deeper on the shoal and is dominated by coralline and red foliose algae.

5000|$|The {{constant}} {{motion of}} the ribs in the flail segment {{at the site of}} the fracture is extremely painful, and, untreated, the sharp <b>broken</b> <b>edges</b> of the ribs are likely to eventually puncture the pleural sac and lung, possibly causing a pneumothorax. The concern about [...] "mediastinal flutter" [...] (the shift of the mediastinum with paradoxical diaphragm movement) does not appear to be merited. Pulmonary contusions are commonly associated with flail chest and that can lead to respiratory failure. This is due to the paradoxical motions of the chest wall from the fragments interrupting normal breathing and chest movement. Typical paradoxical motion is associated with stiff lungs, which requires extra work for normal breathing, and increased lung resistance, which makes air flow difficult. The respiratory failure from the flail chest requires mechanical ventilation and a longer stay in an intensive care unit. It is the damage to the lungs from the flail segment that is life-threatening.|$|E

50|$|In his {{restoration}} of the sculpture, the royal sculptor Franรงois Girardon, to make the sculpture more definitely a Venus, added some attributes: the apple in the right hand - as won in the Judgement of Paris - and the mirror in the left. The discovery in 1911 of a cast made of the sculpture as it had first been restored only sufficiently to reassemble, before Girardon was commissioned to improve it, demonstrated the extent of Girardon's transformative restorations, which included refinishing the surfaces, slimming {{the figure in the}} process. That the result is as much Girardon as Greco-Roman keeps the sculpture in the storerooms of the Louvre. The head, though its <b>broken</b> <b>edges</b> do not directly join with the torso except for one point of contact, belongs with the body - an important point, since it is the only sculpture of this particular model that retains its head, and the head is Praxitelean, comparable to his Aphrodite of Cnidus.

5000|$|Another {{supposedly}} unique feature originally identified {{from the}} type specimen was {{the presence of}} armor plating on the belly. A large segment of {{what appeared to be}} the bone from a flat osteoderm covered the underside of the abdomen. This had a surface structure covered with small hexagonal and rhombic bumps. Such plates had never been found with other ankylosaurians, and it has been suggested that, if L. paradoxus was indeed aquatic, the belly plates may have protected it from predators attacking from below, as in modern turtles. Smaller triangular osteoderms were found on the shoulder, including a small shoulder spike. However, closer examination of the bumps seemed to suggest that they were not sculpted onto a single piece of bone, but instead resembled normal dinosaurian scales. The <b>broken</b> <b>edges</b> of the supposed plates, when studied in 2013 by paleontologist Victoria Arbour and colleagues, did not reveal any internal structure as would be expected from a piece of bone.

The nail heads are 18 mm in diameter and have a pin length of 27 mm. Three figure-eight shaped bronze fittings of 41 mm length, 15 mm width and thicknesses of 2 mm with line ornaments wearing a gold metal insert at the waist. The gold plate was fixed by two fine incisions in the bronze fitting and then folded on the reverse. Two rectangular bronze plates of 38 mm in length, 7 mm in width and about 1.8 mm thickness are entirely covered with gold foil and bent around the edges for fixation. Furthermore, there are five rectangular fitting plates whose <b>broken</b> <b>edges</b> were put together. It is most likely that some of their fragments are still missing.
