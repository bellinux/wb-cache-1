2500|$|The Chillingham cattle {{are related}} to White Park cattle, {{in the sense that}} the Chillingham herd has contributed to the White Park, though there has been no gene flow the other way. [...] Chillingham cattle are small, with upright horns in both males and females. [...] Bulls weigh around 300kg, cows about 280kg. They are white with {{coloured}} ears (they may also have some colour on feet, nose and around the eyes). In the case of Chillingham cattle, the ear-colour is red [...] in most White Park animals the ears are black (which is genetically dominant over red in cattle). Chillingham cattle are of generally primitive conformation while White Parks are of classical British <b>beef</b> <b>conformation.</b>|$|E

BOHUSLÁVEK Czech University of Agriculture in Prague, Technical faculty, Czech Republic ABSTRACT: Using a device (based on a 4 -electrode method) for measuring the values of biological tissue impedance at 2 and 120 kHz, the impedance of 293 beef carcasses was identified during the current operation of a high-performance, modern abattoir line. An adapter with variable distance of needle electrodes and a computer-controlled measuring process enabled a fast impedance scanning process. The values recorded by measurements (impedance – imp 2, 120 (kHz); warm carcass weight – CW; distance of measuring electrodes – D) and the values subsequently derived were estimated as inde-pendent variables, and subsequently their correlation to the estimated commercial classification values (conformation, fatness) was ascertained. The measurements revealed a relationship (r = 0. 8) between conformation and impedance at the frequency of 120 kHz; and a high correlation between “electric volume ” (D 2 /imp 120) at the frequency of 120 kHz and the warm carcass weight (CW), expressed by the correlation coefficient r = 0. 827. Using a stepwise regression analysis, regression formulas for conformation estimation were sought for, and the best model with the coefficient of correlation/ determination (r = 0. 867 /r 2 = 0. 752) was found for the following independent variables: imp 2, D 2 /imp 120, CW and D. The calculated correlation coefficients (r) are lower than those obtained by former measurements using individually inserted electrodes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background <b>Beef</b> carcass <b>conformation</b> and {{fat cover}} scores are {{measured}} by subjective grading performed by trained technicians. The discrete {{nature of these}} scores is {{taken into account in}} genetic evaluations using a threshold model, which assumes an underlying continuous distribution called liability that can be modelled by different methods. Methods Five threshold models were compared in this study: three threshold linear models, one including slaughterhouse and sex effects, along with other systematic effects, with homogeneous thresholds and two extensions with heterogeneous thresholds that vary across slaughterhouses and across slaughterhouse and sex and a generalised linear model with reverse extreme value errors. For this last model, the underlying variable followed a Weibull distribution and was both a log-linear model and a grouped data model. The fifth model was an extension of grouped data models with score-dependent effects in order to allow for heterogeneous thresholds that vary across slaughterhouse and sex. Goodness-of-fit of these models was tested using the bootstrap methodology. Field data included 2, 539 carcasses of the Bruna dels Pirineus beef cattle breed. Results Differences in carcass conformation and fat cover scores among slaughterhouses could not be totally captured by a systematic slaughterhouse effect, as fitted in the threshold linear model with homogeneous thresholds, and different thresholds per slaughterhouse were estimated using a slaughterhouse-specific threshold model. This model fixed most of the deficiencies when stratification by slaughterhouse was done, but it still failed to correctly fit frequencies stratified by sex, especially for fat cover, as 5 of the 8 current percentages were not included within the bootstrap interval. This indicates that scoring varied with sex and a specific sex per slaughterhouse threshold linear model should be used in order to guarantee the goodness-of-fit of the genetic evaluation model. This was also observed in grouped data models that avoided fitting deficiencies when slaughterhouse and sex effects were score-dependent. Conclusions Both threshold linear models and grouped data models can guarantee the goodness-of-fit of the genetic evaluation for carcass conformation and fat cover, but our results highlight the need for specific thresholds by sex and slaughterhouse in order to avoid fitting deficiencies. </p...|$|R
