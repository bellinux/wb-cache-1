There are several access points along the river {{suitable}} for canoeing, and the river has been paddled as far up as Bruton, <b>but</b> <b>above</b> West Lydford only after recent rain. There are public footpaths alongside many stretches of the river. There are also areas of the river that serve as desirable spots for wild swimming.|$|E
5|$|<b>But</b> <b>above</b> all Mario Vargas Llosa {{uses the}} fictional Urania to {{facilitate}} the novel's attempt at remembering the regime. The novel opens and closes with Urania's story, effectively framing the narrative {{in the terms of}} remembering the past and understanding its legacy in the present. In addition, because of her academic study {{of the history of the}} Trujillo regime, Urania is also confronting the memory of the regime for the country as a whole. This is in keeping with one purpose of the book, which is to ensure that the atrocities of the dictatorship and the dangers of absolute power will be remembered by a new generation.|$|E
5|$|Early {{shooting}} {{put more}} {{focus on the}} pool playing, but during filming Rossen {{made the decision to}} place more emphasis on the love story between Newman and Laurie's characters. Despite the change in emphasis, Rossen still used the various pool games to show the strengthening of Eddie's character and the evolution of his relationship to Bert and Sarah, through the positioning of the characters in the frame. For example, when Eddie is playing Findley, Eddie is positioned below Bert in a two shot <b>but</b> <b>above</b> Findley while still below Bert in a three shot. When Sarah enters the room, she is below Eddie in two shot while in a three shot Eddie is still below Bert. When Eddie is kneeling over Sarah's body, Bert again appears above him but Eddie attacks Bert, ending up on top of him. Eddie finally appears above Bert in two shot when Eddie returns to beat Fats.|$|E

5|$|House {{prices in}} Weymouth and Portland are {{relatively}} high by UK standards, yet around {{average for the}} south of England—the average price of a detached house in 2010 was £303,622; semi-detached and terraced houses were cheaper, at £204,647 and £203,207 respectively, and an apartment or maisonette cost £155,056. The crime rate in Weymouth of 7.6 burglaries per 1000 households is {{lower than that of}} England and Wales (11.6 per 1000), <b>but</b> <b>above</b> that of Dorset (3.6 per 1000). Unemployment levels are low, particularly in summer, at 2.5% of the economically active population in July 2011, compared to the UK average of 7.7%.|$|E
5|$|However, {{he left a}} still greater {{legacy to}} the city of Glasgow. At some point between the years 1175 and 1178, Jocelin {{obtained}} from King William a grant of burghal status for the settlement of Glasgow, with a market every Thursday. The grant of a market was the first ever official grant of a weekly market to a burgh. Moreover, between 1189 and 1195, King William granted the burgh an annual fair, a fair still in existence today, increasing Glasgow's status as an important settlement. As well as new revenues for the bishop, the rights entailed by Glasgow's new burghal status and market privileges brought new people to the settlement, one of the first of whom was one Ranulf de Haddington, a former burghess of Haddington. The new settlement was laid out (probably {{under the influence of the}} burgh of Haddington) around Glasgow Cross, down the hill from the cathedral and old fort of Glasgow, <b>but</b> <b>above</b> the flood level of the River Clyde.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, PSA {{decided that}} their new small Talbot {{would also be}} based on the 104 rather than the Horizon. Keeping the common {{underpinnings}} allowed the new model, known internally as project C15 (later renamed to T15 to reflect the brand change from Chrysler to Talbot) to be launched in 1981, in time to replace the Sunbeam when Linwood would close. In order not to create too much internal competition, a wheelbase between the 3 door and 5 door versions of the 104 was chosen. This made the projected model slot in size slightly below popular superminis such as the Ford Fiesta, <b>but</b> <b>above</b> the city cars, including the about-to-be-launched Austin Metro.|$|E

5|$|The Bhagavata Purana {{describes}} Naraka as {{beneath the}} earth: between the seven realms {{of the underworld}} (Patala) and the Garbhodaka Ocean, which is {{the bottom of the}} universe. It is located in the South of the universe. Pitrloka, where the dead ancestors (Pitrs) headed by Agniṣvāttā reside, is also located in this region. Yama, the Lord of Naraka, resides in this realm with his assistants. The Devi Bhagavata Purana mentions that Naraka is the southern part of universe, below the earth <b>but</b> <b>above</b> Patala. The Vishnu Purana mentions that it is located below the cosmic waters {{at the bottom of the}} universe. The Hindu epics too agree that Naraka is located in the South, the direction which is governed by Yama and is often associated with Death. Pitrloka is considered as the capital of Yama, from where Yama delivers his justice.|$|E
5|$|The western slopes fall {{smoothly}} to {{the head}} of Thirlmere reservoir, and the tiny church at Wythburn. There are rougher areas, High and Comb Crags in particular, but these do little to change the overall impression of high moorland. The lower slopes have been planted with conifers as part of the Thirlmere Forest, <b>but</b> <b>above</b> this is a sense of wide open space. Nethermost Pike's toehold on the valley is shifted a little to the south, relative to its position on the ridge. This is because Whelpside and Birkside Gills, its boundary streams, both run south-west, rather than flowing straight down the slope.|$|E
5|$|Poorly {{developed}} handicraft {{and limited}} resources for metal working {{are characteristic of}} the communities of all early Slavic cultures. There were no major iron production centers, but metal founding techniques were known; among the metal objects occasionally found are iron knives and hooks, as well as bronze decorative items (as {{can be found in}} 7th-century finds in Haćki, Bielsk Podlaski County, a site of one of the earliest fortified settlements). The inventories of the typical small open settlements also normally include various utensils made of stone, horn and clay (including weights used for weaving). The settlements were arranged as clusters of cabins along river or stream valleys, <b>but</b> <b>above</b> their flood levels, they were usually irregular and typically faced south. The wooden frame or pillar-supported square houses covered with a straw roof had each sides of 2.5 to 4.5 meters in length. Fertile lowlands were sought, but also forested areas with diversified plant and animal environment to provide additional sustenance. The settlements were self-sufficient; the early Slavs functioned without significant long-distance trade. Potter's wheels were used from the turn of the 7th century on. Some villages larger than a few homes have been discovered in the Kraków-Nowa Huta region from the 6th to 9th century, for example a complex of 11 settlements on the left bank of the Vistula in the direction of Igołomia. The original furnishings of Slavic huts are difficult to determine, because equipment was often made of perishable materials such as wood, leather or fabrics. Free- standing clay dome stoves for bread baking have been found on some locations. Another large 6th– to 9th-century settlement complex existed in the vicinity of Głogów in Silesia.|$|E
