50|$|The <b>bit</b> <b>masks</b> can be {{manipulated}} efficiently with Boolean operations. For example, two fragment <b>bit</b> <b>masks</b> can be added together to determine the overlap between them. The A-buffer algorithm saves {{only a small amount}} of additional information with each fragment. For example. It includes the fragment's z extent, but no information about which part of the fragment is associated with these z values. Thus, the algorithm must make assumptions about the sub-pixel geometry in cases in which fragment <b>bit</b> <b>masks</b> overlap in z.|$|R

40|$|Everyone who {{is willing}} to {{generated}} high quality images is faced with aliasing problems. Prefiltering of the image is a recognized method to soften the symptoms of aliasing. One simple filter is the integration of the visible intensities over the area of a pixel. An exact pixel integrater has to clip all polygons found in a pixel against each other and the pixel window. Pixel <b>bit</b> <b>masks</b> is a convenient approximation to represent the visible area of polygons at a subpixel level. These masks reduces the full polygon clipping to simple boolean exclusive- or operations. The efficient generation of such pixel <b>bit</b> <b>masks</b> {{plays an important role in}} the time performance of the synthesis process. The idea of pixel <b>bit</b> <b>masks</b> is not new, but exploiting the point-to-point coherence of scanlines, it was possible to improve the performance over the original algorithm...|$|R
50|$|Another {{example is}} a <b>bit</b> <b>mask</b> and shift {{function}} operating on color values stored as integers say in the form RGB that swaps R and B, resulting in form BGR.f(f(RGB))=RGB, f(f(BGR))=BGR.|$|E

50|$|The main {{advantage}} of mask ROM is its cost. Per <b>bit,</b> <b>mask</b> ROM is more compact {{than any other}} kind of semiconductor memory.

50|$|SGRAM (Synchronous {{graphics}} RAM) {{a specialized}} type of SDRAM made for graphics adaptors (video cards). It can perform graphics-related operations such as <b>bit</b> <b>masking</b> and block write, and can open two pages of memory at once.|$|R

50|$|Each {{device is}} given its Device Keys and a 31-bit number d called the device number.For each Device Key, {{there is an}} {{associated}} number denoted the path number, the “u” <b>bit</b> <b>mask,</b> and the “v” <b>bit</b> <b>mask.</b> The path number denotes the position in the tree associated with the Device Key. This path number defines a path from the root to that node in the tree.The “u” and “v” masks {{are used in the}} subset difference tree process. They are always a single sequence of 1-bits followed by a single sequence of 0-bits. The bit masks indicate “don’t care” bits in the path number; if a bit is 0 in the mask, the corresponding bit in the path number is “don’t care”. The deeper the position of a node in the tree, the shorter the sequence of 0-bits in the mask associated to that node.|$|E
50|$|Carpenter's A-buffer {{algorithm}} addresses {{this problem}} by approximating Catmull's per-pixel object-precision area sampling with per-pixel image-precision operation performed on a sub-pixel grid. Polygons are first processed in scan-line order by clipping them to each square pixel they cover. This result in list of clipped polygon fragments corresponding to each square pixel. Each fragment have 4 by 8 <b>bit</b> <b>mask</b> of parts of the pixel it covers.|$|E
5000|$|Microsoft {{does not}} {{disallow}} {{the presence of}} a valid alpha channel <b>bit</b> <b>mask</b> in BITMAPV4HEADER and BITMAPV5HEADER for 1bpp, 4bpp and 8bpp indexed color images, which indicates that the color table entries can also specify an alpha component using the 8.8.8.0-8.0-8 format via the RGBQUAD.rgbReserved member. However, some versions of Microsoft's documentation disallow this feature by stating that the RGBQUAD.rgbReserved member [...] "must be zero".|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} resolve the {{ambiguity}} of which bits define which samples, the DIB headers provide certain defaults as well as specific BITFIELDS, which are <b>bit</b> <b>masks</b> that define the membership of particular group of bits in a pixel to a particular channel.

50|$|The bit-mask for a {{fragment}} {{is computed by}} xoring together masks representing each of the fragment's edges. When all polygons intersecting a pixel have been processed, the area-weighted average of {{the colors of the}} pixel's visible surfaces is obtained by selecting fragments in depth-sorted order and using their <b>bit</b> <b>masks</b> to clip those of farther fragments.|$|R
50|$|An {{affinity}} mask is a <b>bit</b> <b>mask</b> indicating what processor(s) {{a thread}} or process should be run {{on by the}} scheduler of an operating system. Setting the affinity mask for certain processes running under Windows can be useful as there are several system processes (especially on domain controllers) that are restricted to the first CPU / Core. So, excluding the first CPU might lead to better application performance.|$|E
50|$|The sample fields {{defined by}} the BITFIELDS bit masks have to be {{contiguous}} and non-overlapping, but {{the order of the}} sample fields is arbitrary. The most ubiquitous field order is: Alpha, Blue, Green, Red (MSB to LSB). The red, green and blue bit masks are valid only when the Compression member of the DIB header is set to BI_BITFIELDS. The alpha <b>bit</b> <b>mask</b> is valid whenever it is present in the DIB header or when the Compression member of the DIB header is set to BI_ALPHABITFIELDS (Windows CE only).|$|E
50|$|The value {{returned}} by querying a selector code is 32 bits, whose meaning {{depends on the}} selector. Some selectors define this as a version code, while others {{use it as a}} <b>bit</b> <b>mask</b> of available capabilities. Some subsystems define both types of selectors, allowing querying of both the version number and the capabilities. Some even use a Gestalt selector to pass the address of a shared block of data, or even the address of code that could be called. Since the piece of code that installed a Gestalt selector could either install a simple static value or a callback that Gestalt would invoke every time somebody queried the selector, it was possible for the value returned to vary dynamically from call to call, to reflect information about {{the current state of the}} subsystem.|$|E

5000|$|Because {{the result}} 0010 is non-zero, {{we know the}} second bit in the {{original}} pattern was set. This is often called <b>bit</b> <b>masking.</b> (By analogy, the use of masking tape covers, or masks, portions {{that should not be}} altered or portions that are not of interest. In this case, the 0 values <b>mask</b> the <b>bits</b> that are not of interest.) ...|$|R
50|$|The Traffic {{indication}} {{map information}} element is covered under section 7.3.2.6 of 802.11-1999 standard. The IEEE 802.11 standards {{chose to use}} a bitmap to indicate to any sleeping listening stations if the Access Point (AP) has any buffered frames present for it. Because stations should listen {{to at least one}} beacon before the listen interval, the AP periodically sends this bitmap on its beacons as an information element. The <b>bit</b> <b>mask</b> is called the Traffic Indication Map and consists of 2008 bits, each bit representing the Association Id (AID) of a station. For example, the TIM information element allows you to transfer 1 byte up to the entire 251 bytes (2008 bits) of the TIM, you are allowed to transmit a smaller TIM bitmap as it is expected that only a few number of stations will be asleep. Because of this the bitmap values passed in the TIM information element is called a partial virtual bitmap. To allow you to transmit only a partial bitmap you must make use of the bitmap control and length fields of the TIM information element.|$|E
5000|$|The 2200 Series {{architecture}} provides many registers. Base registers logically {{contain a}} virtual address that {{points to a}} word in a code or data bank (segment). They may point {{to the beginning of}} the bank or to any word within the bank. Index registers are used by instructions to modify the offset of the specified or assumed base register. Simple arithmetic (add, subtract) may be performed on all index registers. In addition, index registers consist of a lower offset portion and an upper increment portion. An instruction may both use the offset value in an index register as part of an address and specify that the increment is to be added to the offset. This allows loops to be accomplished with fewer instructions as incrementing the index by the step size can be accomplished without a separate instruction. Arithmetic registers allow the full set of computational instructions including all floating point operations. Some of those instructions work on adjacent pairs of registers to perform double-precision operations. There are no even-odd constraints. Any two registers may be used as a double-precision value. Four of the arithmetic registers are also index registers (the sets overlap - index register X12 is arithmetic register A0). This allows the full range of calculations to be performed on indexes without having to move the results. The rest of the registers, known as R registers, are used as fast temporary storage and for certain special functions. R1 holds the repeat count for those instructions that may be repeated (block transfer, execute repeated, etc.). R2 holds a <b>bit</b> <b>mask</b> for a few instructions that perform a bitwise logical operation in addition to some other functions (e.g., masked load upper) ...|$|E
40|$|External {{correction}} of analog-to-digital converters is con-sidered. First, a dynamic correction scheme is proposed to comprise bit-masking.
