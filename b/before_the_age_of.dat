5|$|The {{hospitalization}} {{rate for}} hyperparathyroidism in the United States in 1999 was 8.0 out of 100,000. The disease has a definite tendency to affect younger individuals, typically appearing <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> 40, with {{a study in}} 1922 reporting that 70% of cases display symptoms <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> 20, and 85% before 35. Primary hyperparathyoidism, as well as OFC, {{is more common in}} Asiatic countries. Before treatment for hyperparathyroidism improved in the 1950s, half of those diagnosed with hyperparathyroidism saw it progress into OFC.|$|E
5|$|A fairly {{comprehensive}} demographic {{study was}} done by historian John Demos for his seminal 1970 work on the Pilgrims A Little Commonwealth. He reports that the colony's average household grew from 7.8 children per family for first-generation families to 8.6 children for second-generation families, and to 9.3 for third-generation families. Child mortality also decreased over this time, with 7.2 children born to first-generation families living until their 21st birthday. That number increased to 7.9 children by the third generation. Life expectancy was higher for men than for women. Of the men who survived {{until the age of}} 21, the average life expectancy was 69.2 years. Over 55 percent of these men lived past 70; less than 15 percent died <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> 50. For women, the numbers are much lower, owing to the difficulties inherent in childbearing. The average life expectancy of women at the age of 21 was only 62.4 years. Of these women, less than 45 percent lived past 70, and about 30 percent died <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> 50.|$|E

5|$|Within nations, it is {{more common}} in higher {{socioeconomic}} groups. Males and females are affected in an equal ratio, and the peak age of onset between 10 and 19 years. About 80% of people with aphthous stomatitis first developed the condition <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> 30. There have been reports of ethnic variation. For example, in the United States, aphthous stomatitis may be three times more common in white-skinned people than black-skinned people.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the fifth}} edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), Tourette’s may be {{diagnosed}} when a person exhibits both multiple motor and one or more vocal tics over the period of a year; the motor and vocal tics need not be concurrent. The onset must have occurred <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> 18, and cannot {{be attributed to the}} effects of another condition or substance (such as cocaine). Hence, other medical conditions that include tics or tic-like movements—such as autism or other causes of tourettism—must be ruled out before conferring a Tourette's diagnosis. Since 2000, the DSM has recognized that clinicians see patients who meet all the other criteria for Tourette's, but do not have distress or impairment.|$|E

5|$|<b>Before</b> <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> the bucentaurs, it is {{probable}} that for ceremonies in the Venetian Lagoon the doge was simply assigned a small galley from the Venetian fleet. As Venice's wealth increased due to its naval power, plans were made for a special ship to be built. This is evidenced by the promissioni – sacramental pledges spoken by the doges when they were sworn into office – of Reniero Zeno of 1252, Lorenzo Tiepolo of 1268 and Giovanni Soranzo of 1312 which mention the construction of a bucentaur in the Arsenale shipyard and naval depot.|$|E
5|$|From early on, {{children}} also assume that language {{is designed for}} communication. Infants treat communication as a cooperative process. Specifically, infants observe the principles of conventionality and contrast. According to conventionality, infants believe that for a particular meaning that they wish to convey, there is a term {{that everyone in the}} community would expect to be used. According to contrast, infants act according to the notion that differences in form mark differences in meaning. Children's attention to conventionality and contrast is demonstrated in their language use, even <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> 2 years; they direct their early words towards adult targets, repair mispronunciations quickly if possible, ask for words to relate to the world around them, and maintain contrast in their own word use.|$|E

Many older workers would like to continue to work but face various obstacles to doing so.

CED's report, New Opportunities for Older Workers, addresses these and other issues and recommends reforms in public policies and business practices...|$|R
5|$|Horses, {{particularly}} colts, {{sometimes are}} physically capable of reproduction at about 18months, but domesticated horses are rarely allowed to breed <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> three, especially females. Horses {{four years old}} are considered mature, although the skeleton normally continues to develop {{until the age of}} six; maturation also depends on the horse's size, breed, sex, and quality of care. Larger horses have larger bones; therefore, not only do the bones take longer to form bone tissue, but the epiphyseal plates are larger and take longer to convert from cartilage to bone. These plates convert after the other parts of the bones, and are crucial to development.|$|E
5|$|Often, castles {{constructed}} <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> gunpowder were {{incapable of}} using guns as their wall-walks were too narrow. A {{solution to this}} was to pull down {{the top of a}} tower and to fill the lower part with the rubble to provide a surface for the guns to fire from. Lowering the defences in this way had the effect of making them easier to scale with ladders. A more popular alternative defence, which avoided damaging the castle, was to establish bulwarks beyond the castle's defences. These could be built from earth or stone and were used to mount weapons.|$|E
5|$|Ornstein was {{the first}} {{important}} composer to make extensive use of the tone cluster. As a pianist, he was considered a world-class talent. By the mid-1920s, he had walked away from his fame and soon disappeared from popular memory. Though he gave his last public concert <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> forty, he continued writing music for another half-century and beyond. Largely forgotten for decades, he was rediscovered in the mid-1970s. Ornstein completed his eighth and final piano sonata in September 1990 {{at the age of}} ninety-four, making him the oldest published composer in history (a mark since passed by Elliott Carter).|$|E

5|$|Pancreatic cancer rarely occurs <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> 40, {{and more}} than half of cases of {{pancreatic}} adenocarcinoma occur in those over 70. Risk factors for pancreatic cancer include tobacco smoking, obesity, diabetes, and certain rare genetic conditions. About 25% of cases are linked to smoking, and 5–10% are linked to inherited genes. Pancreatic cancer is usually diagnosed by a combination of medical imaging techniques such as ultrasound or computed tomography, blood tests, and examination of tissue samples (biopsy). The disease is divided into stages, from early (stageI) to late (stageIV). Screening the general population has not been found to be effective.|$|E
5|$|Reactive {{attachment}} disorder {{first made}} its appearance in standard nosologies of psychological disorders in DSM-III, 1980, following {{an accumulation of}} evidence on institutionalized children. The criteria included a requirement of onset <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> 8 months and was equated with failure to thrive. Both these features were dropped in DSM-III-R, 1987. Instead, onset was changed to being within the first 5 years {{of life and the}} disorder itself was divided into two subcategories, inhibited and disinhibited. These changes resulted from further research on maltreated and institutionalized children and remain in the current version, DSM-IV, 1994, and its 2000 text revision, DSM-IV-TR, as well as in ICD-10, 1992. Both nosologies focus on young children who are not merely at increased risk for subsequent disorders but are already exhibiting clinical disturbance.|$|E
