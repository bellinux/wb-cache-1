25|$|Heidegger himself, who is {{supposed}} to have broken with Husserl, bases his hermeneutics on an account of time that not only parallels Husserl's account in many ways but seems to have been arrived at through the same phenomenological method as was used by Husserl.... The differences between Husserl and Heidegger are significant, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not see how much it is the case that Husserlian phenomenology provides the framework for Heidegger's approach, {{we will not be able}} to appreciate the exact nature of Heidegger's project in Being and Time or why he left it unfinished.|$|E

It was well received and contained five tracks, [...] "Dom som försvann" [...] (Those Who Disappeared) becoming the radio single and having a video recorded. The EP made No.1 in Sweden and remained on the charts for 33 weeks.|$|E

40|$|It is well at {{the outset}} to attempt a {{definition}} of terms. But the task of adequately defining most literary forms {{is not an easy}} one. Professor W. P. Ker, dealing with the “ballad” before the British Academy got around the difficulty neatly by saying: “In spite of Socrates and his logic, we may venture to say, in answer to the question ‘What is a ballad? - A ballad is The Milldams of Binnorie and Sir Patrick Spens and The Douglas Tragedy and Lord Randal and Childe Maurice, and things of that sort. ” Taking a cue from the professor, we might say of satire: “Satire is The Modest Proposal, The Beggar’s Opera, The Dunciad, The Letters of Junius, Erewhon, Don Juan, Holy Willie’s Prayer, Point Counterpoint, and things of that sort. ” <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did,</b> <b>we</b> would miss a lot of interesting opinions put down by the writers of “things of that sort” - writers who aimed in poetry and prose to “shoot folly as it flies” - even though some of them have perhaps unconsciously satirized themselves by falling in their conduct far short of their own high-minded code bf satire [ [...] . ...|$|R

60|$|It is objected here, that <b>we</b> <b>do</b> {{not find}} in the Scripture that the Men and Women of either Race were at that Time {{forbidden}} intermarrying with one another; and it is true, that literally it is not forbid; <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not search rather to make doubts than to explain them, we might suppose it was forbidden by some particular Command at that Time; seeing we may reasonably allow every Thing to be forbidden, which they are tax'd with a Crime in committing; and as the Sons of God taking them Wives as they thought fit to choose, tho' from among the Daughters of the cursed Race, is there charg'd upon them as a general Depravation, and a great Crime; and for which, 'tis said, GOD even repented {{that he had made}} them, we need go no farther to satisfy our selves that it was certainly forbidden.|$|R

40|$|The borders between great empires {{are often}} {{populated}} {{by the most}} interesting ethnic groups. Similarly, the interfaces between two forms of bulk matter are responsible {{for some of the}} most unexpected actions" - Pierre Gilles de Gennes (Nobel Laureate in Physics, 1991) Water is all around us. On a wet day we need coats to keep us dry, windscreen wipers so we can see and reservoirs to collect water to drink. There are few things more essential for life. Nature controls water in a myriad of ways. The Lotus leaf cleanses itself of dust when it rains, a beetle in the desert collects drinking water from an early morning fog, some spiders walk on water and others breathe underwater. We understand so little of how to mimic the adaptations to water that Nature has evolved, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did,</b> <b>we</b> could use this natural resource so much better. In this tale of two surfaces, the solid and the liquid, I will begin in the garden with its soil, plants, ponds and insects. I will touch upon frying pans, clothes and watches. As the journey progresses into the laboratory, we will begin to understand how the interactions at the interface between water and a solid are vital to so many processes. At journey's end, we will glimpse a future prospect of such variety, from better clothes to miniature bio-chemical factories on the size of a credit card, all made possible by a simple understanding of water...|$|R
