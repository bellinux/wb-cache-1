5|$|Tacitus' major {{historical}} works, including The Histories and Agricola's biography, {{were all}} written and published under Domitian's successors Nerva (96–98) and Trajan (98–117).

His views on Domitian survive through brief comments in its first five <b>books,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> short but highly negative characterization in Agricola in which he severely criticizes Domitian's military endeavours. Nevertheless, Tacitus admits his debt to the Flavians with regard to his own public career.|$|E
