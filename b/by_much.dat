5|$|Fluorosurfactants {{are small}} organofluorine {{molecules}} used for repelling water and stains. Although expensive (comparable to pharmaceuticals at $200–2000 per kilogram), they yielded over $1 {{billion in annual}} revenues by 2006; Scotchgard alone generated over $300 million in 2000. Fluorosurfactants are a minority in the overall surfactant market, most of which is taken up <b>by</b> <b>much</b> cheaper hydrocarbon-based products. Applications in paints are burdened by compounding costs; this use was valued at only $100 million in 2006.|$|E

5|$|After the Oppenheimer controversy, Teller became ostracized <b>by</b> <b>much</b> of the {{scientific}} community, but was still quite welcome in the government and military science circles. Along with his traditional advocacy for nuclear energy development, a strong nuclear arsenal, and a vigorous nuclear testing program, he had helped to develop nuclear reactor safety standards as {{the chair of the}} Reactor Safeguard Committee of the AEC in the late 1940s, and in the late 1950s headed an effort at General Atomics which designed research reactors in which a nuclear meltdown would be impossible. The TRIGA (Training, Research, Isotopes, General Atomic) has been built and used in hundreds of hospitals and universities worldwide for medical isotope production and research.|$|E

As the sea level changed following the Pliocene era, vegetation was laid down which was later converted into peat. The peak of the peat formation took place in swamp conditions around 6,000years ago, although in some areas it continued into medieval times.|$|E

Glastonbury Tor is composed of Upper Lias Sand. The Poldens and the Isle of Wedmore are composed of Blue Lias and Marl, while the Mendips are largely Carboniferous limestone. Although sea level changes since the Pliocene led to changes in sea level and the laying down of vegetation, the peak of the peat formation took place in swamp conditions around 6,000years ago, although in some areas it continued into medieval times.|$|E
5|$|As in {{many other}} ISSF events, the target for air pistol was reduced in size in 1989, also {{lowering}} the scores (although not <b>by</b> <b>much),</b> and thereby resetting all records. The development after this shows a contrast to that of air rifle shooting: whereas in air rifle the winning score of the 1989 World Championships would not have reached the final 17 years later, the same result increase has not occurred in air pistol, and Sergei Pyzhianov's world record of 593 points, set in the first World Cup Final with the new targets, remained unbeaten for almost 20 years.|$|E

High-resolution Galileo images showed the bright patches to be predominately located on elevated surface features: crater rims, scarps, ridges and knobs. They are likely to be thin water frost deposits. Dark material usually lies in the lowlands surrounding and mantling bright features and appears to be smooth. It often forms patches up to 5km across within the crater floors and in the intercrater depressions.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{and estimates}} a dynamic general equilibrium overlapping generations model of career decisions. The model is fit to data on life cycle employment, schooling and occupation decisions, and on life cycle labor earnings, {{within and between}} cohorts observed in the US between 1968 and 1993. ^ Based on the estimates of the model, the impact of cohort size on skill prices and, consequently, on career decisions is assessed. Compared to a baseline case in which cohort size increased at a steady (average) rate and the fertility process was stationary, {{it is found that}} the male baby bust generations born in the 1930 s and 1940 s faced higher skill prices (<b>by</b> as <b>much</b> as 2. 0 %), completed college at a higher rate (<b>by</b> as <b>much</b> as 0. 3 percentage points) and worked more over the lifetime (<b>by</b> as <b>much</b> as 0. 1 years). In contrast, the males from the baby boom generations born in the 1950 s and 1960 s faced lower skill prices (<b>by</b> as <b>much</b> as 1. 5 %), completed college at a lower rate (<b>by</b> as <b>much</b> as 1. 0 percentage points) and worked less over the lifetime (<b>by</b> as <b>much</b> as 0. 1 years). The impact of cohort size is found to differ across gender due to the differential impact of fertility on the value of home production: unlike males, the female baby bust generations completed college at a lower rate (<b>by</b> as <b>much</b> as 1. 5 percentage points) and worked less over the lifetime (<b>by</b> as <b>much</b> as 0. 5 years) while the female baby boom generations completed college at a lower rate (<b>by</b> as <b>much</b> as 1. 5 percentage points) and worked more over the lifetime (<b>by</b> as <b>much</b> as 0. 2 years). ^ A tuition subsidy experiment is also performed both in a general equilibrium setting in which skill prices are endogenous and in a partial equilibrium setting with fixed skill prices. Based on the estimated model, a 1 % increase in tuition is predicted to reduce college enrollment rates by 1. 27 % in partial equilibrium, consistent with previous estimates, and by 1. 05 % in the general equilibrium case. Thus, for this policy experiment, the partial equilibrium analysis of schooling choice would not differ significantly from the general equilibrium analysis. ...|$|R

5|$|Crowley {{decided to}} climb Kangchenjunga in the Himalayas of Nepal, widely {{recognised}} as the world's most treacherous mountain. Assembling a team consisting of Jacot-Guillarmod, Charles Adolphe Reymond, Alexis Pache, and Alcesti C. Rigo de Righi, the expedition was marred <b>by</b> <b>much</b> argument between Crowley and the others, {{who thought that}} he was reckless. They eventually mutinied against Crowley's control, with the other climbers heading back down the mountain as nightfall approached despite Crowley's warnings that it was too dangerous. Subsequently, Pache and several porters were killed in an accident, something for which Crowley was widely blamed by the mountaineering community.|$|E
5|$|During his lifetime, Takechi's {{innovations}} {{and contributions}} to Japanese theater {{in general and}} to kabuki specifically were influential for decades. His theoretical work, {{as well as his}} mentoring of several important stars, helped bring about a rebirth in kabuki after World War II. His contributions to cinema were much more controversial. Considered a dilettante outsider <b>by</b> <b>much</b> of the film industry, and suspected of racism and nationalism by others, his work was nevertheless defended by the younger generation of filmmakers such as Seijun Suzuki and Nagisa Oshima. Though his films are today unknown to most Japanese filmgoers, through his career-long fight against censorship, the taboos which his films helped break, and the creative freedom which he helped enable, he remains an important figure in Japanese cinema.|$|E

The leading {{margins of the}} disc are very gently convex, and converge on a blunt, broadly triangular snout. The eyes are small and immediately followed <b>by</b> <b>much</b> larger spiracles. The widely spaced nostrils are long and narrow; between them is a short, skirt-shaped curtain of skin with a fringed posterior margin. The modestly sized mouth has an evenly arched lower jaw, prominent grooves at the corners, and 5–7 papillae (nipple-like structures) on the floor. Additional, tiny papillae are scattered on the nasal curtain and outside the lower jaw. The teeth are arranged with a quincunx pattern into flattened surfaces; each tooth is small and blunt, with a roughly diamond-shaped base. There are 45–55 tooth rows in either jaw. The pelvic fins are somewhat large and rounded at the tips.|$|E

5|$|Houphouët-Boigny was a {{participant}} in the November 1960 Congo Crisis, a period of political upheaval and conflict in Congo-Kinshasa. The Ivorian leader supported President Joseph Kasa-Vubu, an opponent of Lumumba, and followed France in supporting the controversial Congolese Prime Minister Moise Tshombe. Tshombe, disliked <b>by</b> <b>much</b> of Africa, was passionately defended by Houphouët-Boigny and was even invited into OCAM in May 1965. After the overthrow of Kasa-Vubu by General Mobutu in November 1965, the Ivorian president supported, in 1967, a plan proposed by the French secret service which aimed to bring the deposed Congolese leader back into power. The operation was a failure. In response, Houphouët-Boigny decided to boycott the fourth annual summit of the OAU held in September 1967 in Kinshasa.|$|E

The tiny Toungoo was now the only ethnic Burman-led kingdom, and one surrounded <b>by</b> <b>much</b> larger kingdoms. Fortunately for Toungoo, the Confederation was distracted by internal leadership disputes, and Hanthawaddy, then the most powerful kingdom of all post-Pagan kingdoms, was weakly led.

5|$|In {{the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries, a {{significant}} number of lynchings occurred in the Southern United States, primarily of African Americans in the states of Georgia, Mississippi, and Texas. Between 1890 and 1920, about 3,000 African Americans were killed by lynch mobs, usually after whites were the victims of crimes purportedly committed by blacks. Supporters of lynching justified the practice as a way to assert dominance over African Americans, to whom they attributed a criminal nature. Lynching also provided a sense of white solidarity in a culture with changing demographics and power structures. Although lynching was tolerated <b>by</b> <b>much</b> of southern society, opponents of the practice emerged, including some religious leaders and the nascent National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).|$|E
