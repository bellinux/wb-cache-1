5|$|While it yet {{remains to}} be seen if there are principally more stable isotopes, there has not any theoretical, let alone practical, {{suggestion}} this could <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b> <b>In</b> a 2012 calculation by the JINR, it was suggested that the half-lives of all dubnium isotopes, synthesized or not, would not significantly exceed a day.|$|E
5|$|Species that {{do need to}} swim {{continuously}} {{to breathe}} go through {{a process known as}} sleep swimming, in which the shark is essentially unconscious. It is known from experiments conducted on the spiny dogfish that its spinal cord, rather than its brain, coordinates swimming, so spiny dogfish can continue to swim while sleeping, and this also may <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> larger shark species.|$|E
5|$|The {{experience}} of being entertained {{has come to be}} strongly associated with amusement, so that one common understanding of the idea is fun and laughter, although many entertainments have a serious purpose. This may <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> the various forms of ceremony, celebration, religious festival, or satire for example. Hence, there is the possibility that what appears as entertainment may also be a means of achieving insight or intellectual growth.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} Medieval period, British kingship was not {{inherited}} {{in a direct}} line from previous kings, as would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> the late Middle Ages. There were instead a number of candidates for kingship, who usually needed {{to be a member}} of a particular dynasty and to claim descent from a particular ancestor. Kingship could be multi-layered and very fluid. The Pictish kings of Fortriu were probably acting as overlords of other Pictish kings for much of this period and occasionally were able to assert an overlordship over non-Pictish kings, but occasionally themselves had to acknowledge the overlordship of external rulers, both Anglian and British. Such relationships may have placed obligations to pay tribute or to supply armed forces. After a victory, sub-kings may have received rewards in return for this service. Interaction with and intermarriage into the ruling families of subject kingdoms may have opened the way to absorption of such sub-kingdoms and, although there might be later overturnings of these mergers, it is likely that a complex process by which kingship was gradually monopolised by a handful of the most powerful dynasties was taking place.|$|E
5|$|People {{receiving}} dimercaprol need to {{be assessed}} for peanut allergies since the commercial formulation contains peanut oil. Calcium EDTA is also effective if administered four hours after the administration of dimercaprol. Administering dimercaprol, DMSA (Succimer), or DMPS prior to calcium EDTA is necessary to prevent the redistribution of lead into the central nervous system. Dimercaprol used alone may also redistribute lead to the brain and testes. An adverse side effect of calcium EDTA is renal toxicity. Succimer (DMSA) is the preferred agent in mild to moderate lead poisoning cases. This may <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> instances where children have a blood lead level >25μg/dL. The most reported adverse side effect for succimer is gastrointestinal disturbances. It {{is also important to}} note that chelation therapy only lowers blood lead levels and may not prevent the lead-induced cognitive problems associated with lower lead levels in tissue. This may be because of the inability of these agents to remove sufficient amounts of lead from tissue or inability to reverse preexisting damage.|$|E
5|$|The {{artifact}} shows {{a number}} of idiosyncrasies that raise questions concerning its authenticity. The numbering systems used in the codex conflict. The Maya bar-and-dot system is used to mark units, but the central Mexican dot system is used to mark multiples of twenty (for example by using 11 dots instead of 2 bars and a dot, as would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> the bar-and-dot system where a bar indicates 5 and a dot indicates 1). Some bar-and-dot numbers are placed within a cartouche decorated with a knot at the top. The only other instance of such a cartouche being used with numbers is in the Dresden Codex, where the cartouche has a very specific function, indicating a negative date count from the zero year of the great cycle of the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar (roughly equivalent to the function of BC in the Gregorian calendar). In the Grolier Codex, where the numbers mark intervals between stations of Venus, {{the use of this}} cartouche appears meaningless, although it is suggested that it means that the codex may be read both from the front and from the back.|$|E
25|$|Nations {{regulate}} arbitration {{through a}} variety of laws. The main body of law applicable to arbitration is normally contained either in the national Private International Law Act (as <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> Switzerland) or in a separate law on arbitration (as <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> England and Jordan). In addition to this, a number of national procedural laws may also contain provisions relating to arbitration.|$|R

5|$|The most {{significant}} {{cause of death}} in temperate areas is likely to be starvation, particularly over the autumn and winter period when first year birds are still perfecting their hunting skills. In northern and upland areas, there is some correlation between mortality in older birds and adverse weather, deep-lying snow and prolonged low temperatures. Collision with road vehicles is another cause of mortality, and may result when birds forage on mown verges. Some of these birds are in poor condition and may have been less able to evade oncoming vehicles than fit individuals would have been. Historically, many deaths were caused by the use of pesticides, and this may still <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> some parts of the world. Collisions with power-lines kill some birds and shooting accounts for others, especially in Mediterranean regions.|$|E

25|$|Donor {{coordination}} in Lebanon is {{the responsibility}} of a donor coordination unit in the Ministry of Finance, which itself is supported by UNDP.

25|$|Females {{are very}} {{unlikely}} to express clinical signs.

25|$|There {{were many}} {{different}} types of inquisitions depending on the location and methods; historians have generally classified them into the episcopal inquisition and the papal inquisition. All major medieval inquisitions were decentralized, and each tribunal worked independently. Authority rested with local officials based on guidelines from the Holy See, but there was no central top-down authority running the inquisitions, as would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> post-medieval inquisitions.|$|E

25|$|Later {{examples}} of the Italianate style in England tend to {{take the form of}} Palladian-style building often enhanced by a belvedere tower complete with Renaissance-type balustrading at the roof level.
