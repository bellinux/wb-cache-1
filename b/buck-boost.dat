5000|$|A <b>buck-boost</b> {{transformer}} {{is a type}} of transformer used to {{make adjustments}} to the voltage applied to alternating current equipment. [...] <b>Buck-boost</b> connections are used in several places such as uninterruptible power supply (UPS) units for computers and in the tanning bed industry.|$|E
5000|$|The basic {{principle}} of the inverting <b>buck-boost</b> converter is fairly simple (see figure 2): ...|$|E

5000|$|Compared to {{the buck}} and boost converters, the {{characteristics}} of the inverting <b>buck-boost</b> converter are mainly: ...|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Fig 3: Waveforms {{of current}} and voltage in a <b>buck-boost</b> {{converter}} operating in continuous mode.|$|E
50|$|It can be {{seen that}} this {{relation}} is the same as that obtained for the <b>buck-boost</b> converter.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Fig 5: Evolution of the {{normalized}} {{output voltage}} with the normalized output current in a <b>buck-boost</b> converter.|$|E
5000|$|The {{output voltage}} is {{typically}} {{of the same}} polarity of the input, and can be lower or higher than the input. Such a non-inverting <b>buck-boost</b> converter may use a single inductor which is used for both the buck inductor mode and the boost inductor mode, using switches instead of diodes, sometimes called a [...] "four-switch <b>buck-boost</b> converter", it may use multiple inductors but only a single switch as in the SEPIC and Ćuk topologies.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Fig 6: Evolution of {{the output}} voltage of a <b>buck-boost</b> {{converter}} with the duty cycle when the parasitic {{resistance of the}} inductor increases.|$|E
50|$|A SEPIC is {{essentially}} a boost converter followed by a <b>buck-boost</b> converter, therefore it {{is similar to a}} traditional <b>buck-boost</b> converter, but has advantages of having non-inverted output (the output has the same voltage polarity as the input), using a series capacitor to couple energy from the input to the output (and thus can respond more gracefully to a short-circuit output), and being capable of true shutdown: when the switch is turned off, its output drops to 0 V, following a fairly hefty transient dump of charge.|$|E
50|$|Two {{different}} topologies {{are called}} <b>buck-boost</b> converter.Both {{of them can}} produce a range of output voltages, ranging from much larger (in absolute magnitude) than the input voltage, down to almost zero.|$|E
50|$|The buck, boost, and <b>buck-boost</b> topologies are all {{strongly}} related. Input, {{output and}} ground come together at one point. One {{of the three}} passes through an inductor on the way, while the other two pass through switches. One of the two switches must be active (e.g., a transistor), while the other can be a diode. Sometimes, the topology can be changed simply by re-labeling the connections. A 12 V input, 5 V output buck converter {{can be converted to}} a 7 V input, −5 V output <b>buck-boost</b> by grounding the output and taking the output from the ground pin.|$|E
5000|$|Like the <b>buck-boost</b> converter, the SEPIC has a {{pulsating}} output current. The similar Ćuk converter {{does not}} have this disadvantage, but it can only have negative output polarity, unless the isolated Ćuk converter is used.|$|E
50|$|A Z-source {{inverter}} {{is a type}} {{of power}} inverter, a circuit that converts direct current to alternating current. It functions as a <b>buck-boost</b> inverter without making use of DC-DC converter bridge due to its unique circuit topology.|$|E
50|$|Other DC-DC {{converter}} topologies {{that can}} produce output voltage magnitude either greater than or less than the input voltage magnitude include the boost-buck converter topologies (the split-pi, the Ćuk converter, the SEPIC, etc.) and the <b>buck-boost</b> converter topologies.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Buck-boost</b> {{transformers}} may be {{used for}} electrical equipment where the amount of buck or boost is fixed. For example, a fixed boost would be used when connecting equipment rated for 230 V AC to a 208 V power source.|$|E
5000|$|The {{schematic}} of a {{flyback converter}} {{can be seen}} in Fig. 1. It is equivalent to that of a <b>buck-boost</b> converter, with the inductor split to form a transformer. Therefore, the operating principle of both converters is very similar: ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>buck-boost</b> {{converter}} {{is a type}} of DC-to-DC converter {{that has}} an output voltage magnitude that is either greater than or less than the input voltage magnitude. It is equivalent to a flyback converter using a single inductor instead of a transformer.|$|E
50|$|<b>Buck-boost</b> {{transformers}} {{can be used}} {{to power}} low voltage circuits including control, lighting circuits, or applications that require 12, 16, 24, 32 or 48 volts, consistent with the design's secondaries. The transformer is connected as an isolating transformer and the nameplate kVA rating is the transformer’s capacity.|$|E
50|$|As {{with other}} {{converters}} (buck converter, boost converter, <b>buck-boost</b> converter) the Ćuk converter can either operate in continuous or discontinuous current mode. However, unlike these converters, {{it can also}} operate in discontinuous voltage mode (the voltage across the capacitor drops to zero during the commutation cycle).|$|E
5000|$|Active PFC {{is the use}} {{of power}} {{electronics}} to change the waveform of current drawn by a load to improve the power factor. [...] Some types of the active PFC are buck, boost, <b>buck-boost</b> and synchronous condenser. Active power factor correction can be single-stage or multi-stage.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Fig. 2: The two {{operating}} {{states of}} a <b>buck-boost</b> converter: When the switch is turned on, the input voltage source supplies current to the inductor, and the capacitor supplies current to the resistor (output load). When the switch is opened, the inductor supplies current to the load via the diode D.|$|E
50|$|Similar to the <b>buck-boost</b> {{converter}} with inverting topology, {{the output}} voltage of non-isolated Ćuk is typically also inverting, {{and can be}} lower or higher than the input. It uses a capacitor as its main energy-storage component, unlike most other types of converters which use an inductor. It is named after Slobodan Ćuk of the California Institute of Technology, who first presented the design.|$|E
50|$|All {{transformers}} operate {{only with}} alternating current. Transformers change only voltage and current, not frequency. Equipment that uses synchronous motors will operate {{at a different}} speed if operated at other than the design frequency. Some equipment is marked on its nameplate to run at either 50 Hz or 60 Hz, and would need only the voltage adjusted with a <b>buck-boost</b> transformer to produce the rated output voltage.|$|E
50|$|From {{the above}} {{expression}} {{it can be}} seen that the polarity of the output voltage is always negative (because the duty cycle goes from 0 to 1), and that its absolute value increases with D, theoretically up to minus infinity when D approaches 1. Apart from the polarity, this converter is either step-up (a boost converter) or step-down (a buck converter). Thus it is named a <b>buck-boost</b> converter.|$|E
50|$|Units {{are rated}} in volt-amperes (most commonly, kilo-volt amperes KVA) (or more rarely, amperes) and are rated for {{a percent of}} voltage drop or rise. For example, a <b>buck-boost</b> {{transformer}} rated at 10% boost will raise a supplied voltage of 208 V AC to 229 V AC. A rating of 10% buck will yield the result of 209 V AC if the actual incoming supplied voltage is 230 V AC.|$|E
50|$|The line-interactive UPS {{is similar}} in {{operation}} to a standby UPS, but {{with the addition of}} a multi-tap variable-voltage autotransformer. This is a special type of transformer that can add or subtract powered coils of wire, thereby increasing or decreasing the magnetic field and the output voltage of the transformer. This may also be performed by a <b>buck-boost</b> transformer which is distinct from an autotransformer, since the former may be wired to provide galvanic isolation.|$|E
50|$|The flyback {{converter}} {{is used in}} both AC/DC and DC/DC conversion with galvanic isolation between the input and any outputs. The {{flyback converter}} is a <b>buck-boost</b> converter with the inductor split to form a transformer, so that the voltage ratios are multiplied with an additional advantage of isolation. When driving for example a plasma lamp or a voltage multiplier the rectifying diode of the boost converter is left out and the device is called a flyback transformer.|$|E
50|$|The 4-switch {{converter}} {{combines the}} buck and boost converters. It can operate {{in either the}} buck or the boost mode. In either mode, only one switch controls the duty cycle, another is for commutation and must be operated inversely to the former one, and the remaining two switches are in a fixed position. A 2-switch <b>buck-boost</b> converter can be built with two diodes, but upgrading the diodes to FET transistor switches doesn't cost much extra while due to lower voltage drop the efficiency improves.|$|E
50|$|Simpler, non-isolated power {{supplies}} contain an inductor {{instead of a}} transformer. This type includes boost converters, buck converters, and the <b>buck-boost</b> converters. These belong to the simplest class of single input, single output converters which use one inductor and one active switch. The buck converter reduces the input voltage {{in direct proportion to}} the ratio of conductive time to the total switching period, called the duty cycle. For example an ideal buck converter with a 10 V input operating at a 50% duty cycle will produce an average output voltage of 5 V. A feedback control loop is employed to regulate the output voltage by varying the duty cycle to compensate for variations in input voltage. The output voltage of a boost converter is always greater than the input voltage and the <b>buck-boost</b> output voltage is inverted but can be greater than, equal to, or less than the magnitude of its input voltage. There are many variations and extensions to this class of converters but these three form the basis of almost all isolated and non-isolated DC to DC converters. By adding a second inductor the Ćuk and SEPIC converters can be implemented, or, by adding additional active switches, various bridge converters can be realized.|$|E
50|$|This is {{the latest}} {{technology}} of voltage regulation to provide real-time control of voltage fluctuation, sag, surge and also to control other power quality issues such as spikes and EMI/RFI electrical noises. This uses an IGBT regulator engine generating pulse width modulated (PWM) AC voltage at high switching frequency. This AC PWM wave is superimposed on the main incoming wave through a <b>buck-boost</b> transformer, to provide precisely regulated AC voltage. The regulation in this technology is instantaneous, thus making it suitable for electronic machines which need precise regulated power.|$|E
50|$|Equipment is {{typically}} labeled with its voltage rating, and may advertise {{the amount of}} tolerance it will accept before degraded performance or damage can be expected. A unit that requires 230 V AC with a tolerance of 5% will not require a <b>buck-boost</b> transformer if the branch circuit (under load) is between 219 V AC and 241 V AC. Measurement should be made while the circuit is loaded, as the voltage can drop several volts compared to the open measurement. The transformer must be rated to carry the full load current {{or it may be}} damaged.|$|E
5000|$|Like {{the buck}} and boost converters, the {{operation}} of the <b>buck-boost</b> is best understood in terms of the inductor's [...] "reluctance" [...] to allow rapid change in current. From the initial state in which nothing is charged and the switch is open, the current through the inductor is zero. When the switch is first closed, the blocking diode prevents current from flowing into the right hand side of the circuit, so it must all flow through the inductor. However, since the inductor doesn't like rapid current change, it will initially keep the current low by dropping most of the voltage provided by the source. Over time, the inductor will allow the current to slowly increase by decreasing its voltage drop. Also during this time, the inductor will store energy {{in the form of a}} magnetic field.|$|E
50|$|A {{push-pull}} converter {{is a type}} of DC-to-DC converter, a switching converter {{that uses}} a transformer to change the voltage of a DC power supply. The distinguishing feature of a push-pull converter is that the transformer primary is supplied with current from the input line by pairs of transistors in a symmetrical push-pull circuit. The transistors are alternately switched on and off, periodically reversing the current in the transformer. Therefore current is drawn from the line during both halves of the switching cycle. This contrasts with <b>buck-boost</b> converters, in which the input current is supplied by a single transistor which is switched on and off, so current is only drawn from the line during half the switching cycle. During the other half the output power is supplied by energy stored in inductors or capacitors in the power supply. Push-pull converters have steadier input current, create less noise on the input line, and are more efficient in higher power applications.|$|E
