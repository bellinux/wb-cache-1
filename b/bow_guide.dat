50|$|Bow Guiding {{is where}} two guides {{are in the}} boat, one in the stern {{and one in the}} bow. This can be done in a stern rigged boat, or a raft where both guides are paddle guiding. It is usually only done over short {{stretches}} of whitewater that require a lot of maneuvering for safe passage. Bow guides use techniques such as 'spearing' through large waves, and bow draws to quickly change the direction of the boat. Unlike stern guides the <b>bow</b> <b>guide</b> will never pry with their paddle, instead they will change the orientation of their hands to maintain a power grip in both directions.|$|E
5000|$|The bow {{and arrow}} sign uses {{the curve of the}} appendiceal orifice to point toward the {{direction}} of the ileocecal valve, {{as if it were a}} <b>bow</b> <b>guiding</b> an arrow. The colonoscope can be passed in this direction in order to enter the terminal ileum. [...] This is used as one of two identifiable landmarks of the colon (the other being the anus), and signifies that the entire colon has been visualized.|$|R

60|$|The boat {{which had}} caused so much angry {{discussion}} {{among the men}} of the cave had by this time neared the beach, and one of the crew stood up in the <b>bow</b> to <b>guide</b> her into the narrow cove, which formed but a slight protection, even in calm weather, against the violence of that surf which never ceases to grind at the hard rocks of West Cornwall. At length they effected a landing, and the crew, consisting of nine men armed with pistols and cutlasses, hurried up to the cliffs and searched for the entrance to the cavern.|$|R
50|$|The school derives {{its name}} from the Greek goddess Artemis, called Diana in later Roman myth, classically {{depicted}} taking aim with her <b>bow</b> and arrow, <b>guided</b> by the moon. In addition to being a skilled hunter, Artemis was also traditionally a protectress of girls and women, teaching girls in her protection to be self-sufficient and strong before rejoining society.|$|R
50|$|Upon {{the death}} of a father, his first-born son and {{daughter}} lead the rituals involved in his funeral. The son, at this point, puts on his father's cap and tunic. A tribal elder, carrying the dead man's <b>bow,</b> ritually <b>guides</b> the son to his father's granary and shows him the inside. After his father's death the son is considered a mature man for the purposes of ritual, and it is his responsibility to make sacrifices to the ancestors, chief among them being his own father, who being recently dead is held to act as an intermediary between those still living and the more remote ancestors.|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{numerical}} simulations {{are conducted}} {{to investigate the}} effects of <b>bowed</b> outlet <b>guide</b> vanes (OGVs) on endwall heat transfer and aerodynamic performance. Both on- and off-design conditions are studied. For bowed vanes, the bowed angle varies from 10 degrees to 40 degrees and the normalized bowed height ranges from 0. 1 to 0. 3. Results are included for Nusselt number distributions on the endwall, the energy losses, the yaw angles, and near-wall flow structures. For the convenience of comparison, the straight vane is also studied as a baseline. It is found that the bowed vanes can effectively reduce the endwall heat transfer. Among the tested parameters, a bowed angle of 40 degrees and a normalized bowed height of 0. 3 provide the best-controlled heat transfer for both the on- and off-design conditions. However, the bowed vanes have different effects on the energy losses and the yaw angles depending on the operating conditions. For the on-design condition with the inlet angle of 30 degrees (the incidence angle is 0 degrees) and the off-design condition with the inlet angle of 0 degrees, the bowed vanes do not significantly increase the energy losses and yaw angles, whereas for the off-design condition with the inlet angle of - 30 degrees, significant changes are observed...|$|R
50|$|The Church was {{originally}} built {{sometime in the}} 12th century. The story relates {{that there is one}} night when a group of sailors tried to navigate back to Iceland in a storm. The southern coast of Iceland is notorious for its hidden reefs and rough coast. The distressed sailors prayed to God for a safe return and vowed to build a church wherever they landed. When they ended their prayer an angel, seemingly made of light, appeared before their <b>bow.</b> The angel <b>guided</b> them through the rough surfs and led the crew into a bay for safe landing. The sailors, making good on the promise, built a wooden church at the site and named it Strandarkirkja. The bay nearby is named Angel's Bay (Engilsv√≠k in Icelandic) to commemorate the incident. Many miracles have been attributed to Strandarkirkja and {{there was a time when}} it was one of the richest churches in Iceland from the donations of Icelanders coming from all over the country in hopes of having their prayers and wishes realized.|$|R
60|$|The party {{which was}} to land {{consisted}} of Sergeant Dunham, his daughter, and the Pathfinder. Accustomed to the canoe, Mabel took her seat in the centre with great steadiness, her father {{was placed in the}} <b>bows,</b> while the <b>guide</b> assumed the office of conductor, by steering in the stern. There was little need of impelling the canoe by means of the paddle, for the rollers sent it forward at moments with a violence that set every effort to govern its movements at defiance. More than once, before the shore was reached, Mabel repented of her temerity, but Pathfinder encouraged her, and really manifested so much self-possession, coolness, and strength of arm himself, that even a female might have hesitated about owning all her apprehensions. Our heroine was no coward; and while she felt the novelty of her situation, in landing through a surf, she also experienced a fair proportion of its wild delight. At moments, indeed, her heart was in her mouth, as the bubble of a boat floated on the very crest of a foaming breaker, appearing to skim the water like a swallow, and then she flushed and laughed, as, left by the glancing element, they appeared to linger behind as if ashamed of having been outdone in the headlong race. A few minutes sufficed for this excitement; for though the distance between the cutter and the land considerably exceeded a quarter of a mile, the intermediate space was passed in a very few minutes.|$|R
