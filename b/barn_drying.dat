40|$|BACKGROUND [...] A {{previous}} study showed {{there to be}} fewer microorganisms (especially thermophilic actinomycetes) on farms with artificial <b>barn</b> <b>drying</b> of fodder than on those using traditional storage methods. A cross sectional study was performed to see whether <b>barn</b> <b>drying</b> provides protection against respiratory problems in dairy farmers. METHODS [...] The respiratory symptoms and function {{of a group of}} 123 farmers with daily exposure to cattle foddering from farms which had had a <b>barn</b> <b>drying</b> system {{for at least three years}} were compared with those of a representative sample of 274 farmers working in farms with traditional storage in five districts in the Doubs region of France. RESULTS [...] Both groups were comparable for mean age, weight, height, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, past history of respiratory disease, history of allergy, geographical location of the farm, and length of exposure. Retrospectively estimated exposure to fodder was greater in the group using a <b>barn</b> <b>drying</b> system than in the group working with traditional storage. Acute symptoms at exposure (rhinitis, eye irritation, dry cough, asthma symptoms) and chronic symptoms all tended to be less frequent in the <b>barn</b> <b>drying</b> group, although not individually significantly so. Mean (SD) respiratory function parameters were higher in the <b>barn</b> <b>drying</b> group than in the traditional group: % vital capacity (VC) 104 (14) v 102 (15); % forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) 99 (14) v 94 (18); % FEV 1 /VC 96 (11) v 92 (16); % forced mid expiratory flow (FEF 25 - 75) 87 (24) v 79 (25). CONCLUSION [...] The results of this cross sectional study suggest that <b>barn</b> <b>drying</b> of fodder may protect respiratory function in dairy farmers...|$|E
40|$|Airborne {{contamination}} by thermophilic actinomycetes, micromycetes and Gram negative bacteria {{was determined}} on 34 dairy farms {{and related to}} fodder drying and storage methods. Eighteen farms had a <b>barn</b> <b>drying</b> system, eight with additional heating; the remaining 16 had traditional fodder storage methods. Three air samples were obtained for each farm with a six stage Andersen sampler. The thermophilic actinomycetes were identified as Streptomyces and the dominant micromycetes as Aspergillus spp; there was no relation between the levels of these organisms. There were fewer thermophilic actinomycete colonies per Petri dish (stage 5 on the Anderson sampler) on farms with <b>barn</b> <b>drying</b> than on those with traditional storage (median (range) 7 (0 - 2628) and 56 (4 - 2628) respectively). The three farms where no thermophilic actinomycetes were found had <b>barn</b> <b>drying</b> with heating and the four most modern farms had lower thermophilic actinomycete colony counts than the others (median (range) 3 (0 - 10) and 48 (0 - 2628)). The level of thermophilic actinomycetes and, to a lesser degree, of micromycetes was higher where the farmer had farmer's lung. Thermophilic actinomycetes of the genus Streptomyces are probably the antigens associated with farmer's lung in the Doubs, and modern farms with <b>barn</b> <b>drying</b> and heating furnish some protection against this disease...|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} of ventilated barn hay {{results in a}} high quality fodder for ruminants. Nevertheless, this production method is still a niche in Germany even it is found in organic farming. Reasons are the few publications about required investments of the needed technology for hay drying in the barn. This article provides investment and energy costs for different drying techniques: for box hay drying three different farm sizes were compared, for bale hay drying only one farm size is calculated. Bale hay drying demands more power and investment cost as box hay drying of loose hay. Bale drying {{is more complicated than}} <b>barn</b> <b>drying</b> in that the number of bale drying locations in a barn is a limiting factor to throughput, as is also the drying of densely packed bales. <b>Barn</b> <b>drying</b> is above all practical on farms where hay is the only forage on offer. Its particular advantage is the large amounts of crop that can be dried at the same time. Bale drying tends to be applied more on farms that want their forage partly as grass silage and partly as barn-dried hay...|$|E

40|$|A {{model of}} the hay {{production}} and utilization system was developed and validated. The model is primarily aimed at analyzing machinery dimensioning and management problems with a high accuracy. The model consists of several sub-models of growth, field operations, management, field drying, <b>barn</b> <b>drying,</b> field losses and conservation losses. The validation procedure included validation of certain sub-models {{as well as of}} the model as a whole. It was demonstrated that the resolution of the model is generally satisfactory for thoroughly analyzing complex problems related to planning of hay harvesting machinery systems and management...|$|E
40|$|Because of the {{interactions}} between machinery, biological material, weather and management, many problems related to hay-making can not be properly analyzed unless the entire hay production and utilization process is considered. The only way of covering all {{of this process is}} to use a calculation model which includes the whole process. It was found that the models available was not readily available for Swedish conditions, but would have to be modified. To some extent their resolutions were also lower than the one aimed at in this project. The hay production and utilization system was modelled as three models being parts of the integrated model of hay production and utilization, a growth model, a harvesting model and a hay-to-milk conversion model. The harvesting model consists of a model of field operations and management, a field drying model and a <b>barn</b> <b>drying</b> model. It is also complemented with models of field losses (shatter losses, respiration losses, leaching losses) and a field loss model. The model of field operations and management was designed as a discrete-event driven simulation program. It was developed using Simula, an object-oriented programming language, and DEMOS, a package for discrete modelling on Simula. The field operations model uses a statistical capacity calculation model rather than a detailed simulation model of the movements of field machinery. The management model concerns itself only with the general behaviour of the manager, leaving open the decision process for the application in question. The growth model used was adopted from Torssell et al (1982). In addition to simulating the dry matter growth, it also calculates the protein and energy content using a "quality" model described in Torssell et al (1983). The field drying model was adopted from Thompson (1981). This is a multi-layer model based primarily on meteorological laws. The <b>barn</b> <b>drying</b> model was developed earlier in this project by Jonasson (1983), further developed by Sundberg (1985). In adapting it to the integrated model, the resolution has been significantly improved. A hay-to-milk conversion model based on Linear Programming has been developed. Due to the fast development on the fodder ration calculation methods, this model is however not currently being used. Most of the models being parts of the integrated model was already validated. The field drying model was however calibrated and validated against Swedish experimental field drying data, resulting in a very good agreement between simulated and experimental values. The integrated model was also validated as a whole, using data from the hay harvesting at a real farm in 1981. The results of these were mixed. The growth model did underestimate the growth rate significantly, probably due to an unusually high nitrogen mineralization rate of the soil. The field operations and management model was instructed to follow the known behaviour of the real farmers as closely as possible, which it did quite well. The field drying model could not be evaluated in this validation due to lack of data. The <b>barn</b> <b>drying</b> model, finally, seemed to predict the drying process in the two barn dryers quite well, but the data available was insufficient to confirm such a conclusion. The integrated model is useful for analyzing a large class of problems requiring that the entire hay production and utilization process is considered. Its complexity however results in the model being useful primarily for research problems, whereas the extension service needs simpler tools...|$|E

40|$|Koekompas is an {{instrument}} to investigate risks on farms to prevent disease and to optimize the environment for the cows {{and the production of}} milk. The transition period is a hazardous period for cows for developing metabolic and/or infectious diseases. The following performance indicators (PI’s) are associated with transition cows: feed dry cows, water dry cows, body condition score (BSC), disease incidence of endometritis, retained fetal membranes, metabolic diseases and housing. Koekompas reports from 76 farms were collected and analyzed for trends in data and for relations between PI’s. From the current PI’s and reports one cannot get a complete impression about the transition cows, because the PI’s are not specifically split out for transition cows. The PI incidence of metabolic diseases included both ketosis and hypocalcemia although their pathogenesis and thus their preventive strategy differs.

50|$|On {{the shores}} of Aydingkol Lake, reeds, tamarisks, saxauls, {{as well as other}} shrubs and weeds can be found. Away from sources of water, the Turpan Basin is not covered by vegetation. Consequently, {{agriculture}} is limited to oasis and depends on a sophisticated irrigation system known as the Karez System. The irrigation water comes from the surrounding mountain ranges, in particular from the annual melting of the snow. The Karez System consists of wells, underground channels, ground canals, and small reservoirs, which use the natural slope of the terrain to sustain the water flow and guide the water right to the plants while minimizing evaporation all along the way. The historical record of the system extends back to the Han Dynasty. The number of Karez systems in the area is slightly below 1,000 and the total length of the canals is about 5,000 km in length. The Karez System is therefore considered as one of the three great ancient projects in China along with the Great Wall and the Grand Canal. Recently, development of groundwater through tubewells has led to a general fall in water tables, and many karez systems have failed. Farming in the Turpan Basin is particularly famous for its fruit. Because of the dry and hot conditions, the fruits grown in the depression have very high concentrations of sugar. They are traditionally processed by drying in open <b>drying</b> <b>barns.</b> The cultivated fruit include: mulberry, peach, apricot, apple, pomegranate, pear, fig, walnut, as well as grapes, watermelons and muskmelons. Among the fruit, the grapes stand out: more than 100 varieties of grape are cultivated in the area and it accounts for 90% of China's seedless grape crop. Other specialty agricultural products of the region are Donghu Hami melons and long-staple cotton.|$|R
