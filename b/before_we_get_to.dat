500|$|In September 2015, after Marvel Studios was {{integrated}} into The Walt Disney Studios with Feige reporting to Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan Horn instead of Marvel Entertainment CEO Isaac Perlmutter, {{it was reported}} that the studios' creative committee would have [...] "nominal" [...] input on the films moving forward, though would continue to consult on Marvel Television productions, which remained under Perlmutter's control. All key film decisions going forward will be made by Feige, D'Esposito and Victoria Alonso. At the end of the month, on how much story is developed for future films of the universe, Feige said there are [...] "broad strokes" [...] though sometime [...] "super-specific things. But for the most part, in broad strokes that are broad enough and loose enough that, if through the development of four of five movies <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the culmination ... we still have room to sway and to move and to go and to surprise ourselves in places that we end up. So that all the movies, hopefully when they're finished, will feel like they're all interconnected and meant to be and planned far ahead, but really can live and breathe enough as individual movies to be satisfying each and of themselves." [...] The studio also has various contingency plans for the direction of all of their films, in the event they are unable to secure a certain actor to reprise a role, or re-acquire the film rights to a character, such as was done in February 2015 with Spider-Man.|$|E
2500|$|We can {{demonstrate}} {{there must be}} at least two people in London with the same number of hairs on their heads as follows. Since a typical human head has an average of around 150,000 hairs, {{it is reasonable to assume}} (as an upper bound) that no one has more than 1,000,000 hairs on their head [...] holes). There are more than 1,000,000 people in London ( [...] is bigger than 1million items). Assigning a pigeonhole to each number of hairs on a person's head, and assign people to pigeonholes according to the number of hairs on their head, there {{must be at least}} two people assigned to the same pigeonhole by the 1,000,001st assignment (because they have the same number of hairs on their heads) (or, [...] ). For the average case (...) with the constraint: fewest overlaps, there will be at most one person assigned to every pigeonhole and the 150,001st person assigned to the same pigeonhole as someone else. In the absence of this constraint, there may be empty pigeonholes because the [...] "collision" [...] happens <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the 150,001st person. The principle just proves the existence of an overlap; it says nothing of the number of overlaps (which falls under the subject of probability distribution).|$|E

6000|$|... "We {{are in a}} run of bad luck," [...] said Dick. [...] "I {{really believe}} we will {{have all sorts of}} trouble <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> back <b>to</b> the United States." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No racing to-day!" [...] warned Jack. [...] "You {{save your}} breath, Andy. We expect to skate and tramp {{a good many}} miles to-day <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> back <b>to</b> the school." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I guess it'll be twelve o'clock <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> {{anything}} <b>to</b> eat," [...] answered Mrs. Basswood, with a smile. [...] "I {{think this}} would be just an ideal spot to rest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's the old shanty passing away," [...] said Stacy complacently. [...] "I reckon there won't be {{much left}} of it <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> Boomville." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Bully for you, Harry! I reckon {{that would}} {{give us a chance}} anyhow. That is, if we ain't cut off <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the wood." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I’m sure I wish I was {{off this}} dreadful ship," [...] said Mrs. Fillson nervously. [...] "Nothing but unpleasantness. How long <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> Summercove, Cap’n Bunnett?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And the man may {{be caught}} <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> back <b>to</b> Oak Hall," [...] said Roger. He {{crossed the room}} and peered into a closet. [...] "Has anybody seen my {{baseball}} shoes?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We can't {{reach him}} with that! He'll be burnt up <b>before</b> <b>we</b> can <b>get</b> <b>to</b> him. [...] See, the flames are already {{coming out of}} the window beside him!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Didn’t get the chance. The car was crowded, and <b>before</b> <b>we</b> could <b>get</b> <b>to</b> Jasniff and Merwell {{they saw}} us, {{ran down the}} aisle the other way, and got off.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have eaten}} worse," [...] Frank said carelessly, [...] "and don't care if I never eat better. How {{long do you}} suppose we shall be <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> New Orleans?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't {{know the}} lakes, Master Cap, {{or you would}} not say that. <b>Before</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the Thousand Islands, you will have other notions of what natur' has done in this wilderness." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} settled that point, {{or at least}} there is another to settle <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> X----. Is this Miss Zenobie" [...] (Zoraide, {{interposed}} I)--"well, Zoraide--is she really married to Pelet?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Ten of us {{ran down}} to stop them, with Richard, Earl Osbern's nephew, at their head. The villains {{got to the}} top of the Rech-dike, and made a stand, and <b>before</b> <b>we</b> could <b>get</b> <b>to</b> them--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The boys won't let {{the yacht}} go down," [...] {{answered}} Dora. [...] "They {{are all good}} sailors, and Captain Jerry must know all about handling this craft. But {{we may have a}} very bad time of it <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> back <b>to</b> Santa Barbara." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{should never}} have been let come nearer than Ratisbon! The victory [...] at Echmuhl was fatal for us. O Echmuhl, Echmuhl! I believe he will [...] {{overtake}} us <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> Buda.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{going to}} be tough lines <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> Farley's," [...] he said to himself; [...] "but I ought to hold out {{if for no other reason}} than to clear Sam beyond a doubt." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then, you {{can keep}} an eye on these baskets. If any of the beasts makes an {{alarming}} noise, send to my room, the second, forward, port side. Look me up <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> Montreal." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “‘Then {{they stopped}} firing and the horns {{in the temple}} blew again. ‘Come away— for Gord’s sake come away!’ says Billy Fish. ‘They’ll send runners out to all the villages <b>before</b> ever <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> Bashkai.

6000|$|... "You'll need it all <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> Pine.... Now, I'll ride up on {{top with}} the boys an' eat my supper. It'll be dark, presently, an' we'll stop often to listen. But don't be scared." ...|$|E
60|$|He. What's the good? There's a cloud on Elysium Hill, {{and that}} means it's foggy all down the Mall. We'll go on. It'll blow away <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the Convent, perhaps. 'Jove! It is chilly.|$|E

6000|$|... "We {{must make}} the best of what {{vacation}} is left <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> down <b>to</b> the grind again," [...] remarked the senator's son, and the next day the matter was talked over, with the result that the automobile trip to Shady Glen Falls was proposed and decided upon. All had started out in the best of spirits, never dreaming of the trouble that was in store for them.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sure ye are right," [...] O'Grady said, warmly, [...] "and {{we are a}} set of omadhouns. You have {{sense in}} your head, Terence, {{and there is no}} gainsaying you.

6000|$|... “Won’t do,” objected Moran; “we won’t be well armed {{until we}} know just what those other boxes in the strong-room contain. <b>Before</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> a chance <b>to</b> find out, I’ve an idea our enemy himself will make a move.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall be}} obliged {{if you will}} {{go up to the}} foretop, Hardy, and con the brig in; but mind you, come down <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the white water. You may as well send Mr. Eden down." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{that is a}} comfort. It was {{bad enough}} for that short distance. It would be {{something}} awful if {{it had to be}} kept up for a fortnight. How long shall we be <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> Irkoutsk?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, sir--I {{never saw}} such a place. There's no getting {{anything}} done. I think your honor had better {{step into the}} house and get something to eat; {{it will be a long}} while <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> Fundy." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You and Jerry {{might be}} able to, Tom, for you have got hold of two first-rate ponies; but the Indians' are {{nothing out of the}} way, and our ponies ain't in it with you; besides, they and the pack-horses have all been doing hard work for the last week with none too much food, and many of the 'Rappahoes will be on fresh horses.

2500|$|Sontag {{became aware}} of her {{bisexuality}} during her early teens and at 15 wrote in her diary, [...] "I feel I have lesbian tendencies (how reluctantly I write this)".
