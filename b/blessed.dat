Tintin and Haddock travel on to the Horn of the Yak.|$|E

50|$|Contrary to {{the usual}} pattern of making a <b>blessing</b> before the commandment, the <b>blessing</b> for {{relieving}} one's bodily needs and the <b>blessing</b> for ritually rinsing the hands are both recited afterwards. In the former case, it is forbidden to recite any <b>blessing</b> while one feels one's need, and so the <b>blessing</b> is postponed. In the latter case, one may also not recite the <b>blessing</b> beforehand since clean hands are a prerequisite for reciting the <b>blessing.</b> Even if one is certain that one's hands are clean (for example, at the Rabbinically-instituted rinsing before breaking bread), one still recites the <b>blessing</b> afterwards to avoid confusion.|$|R
