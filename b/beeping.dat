5|$|The family disapproves of {{his first}} few inventions, {{including}} a make-up shotgun, electric hammer, alarm that never stops <b>beeping,</b> and reclining chair with a built-in toilet, making Homer more depressed. However, they like one particular invention, a chair with two hinged legs on the back, {{making it impossible to}} tip over backwards. Homer is encouraged until he notices his poster of Edison shows him sitting in the same type of chair. Bart points out that the chair is not featured on a list of Edison's inventions, meaning he never told anyone of this invention.|$|E
5|$|A major concept used in {{the series}} {{was the idea of}} a running clock. This {{initially}} came from Joel Surnow, who wanted the audience to always know what time it was in the show's fictional timeline. This was done by an on-screen digital clock that appears before and after commercial breaks, and a smaller clock also appears at other points in the narrative. The time shown is the in-universe time of the story. When the running clock is shown full screen, an alternating pulsating <b>beeping</b> noise (like the kind seen on a time bomb) for each second can usually be heard. On rare occasions, a silent clock is used. This usually follows the death of a major character or an otherwise dramatic event.|$|E
5|$|Gotcha is an arcade game {{developed}} by Atari and released in October 1973. It {{was the fourth}} game by the company, after the 1972 Pong, which {{marked the beginning of}} the commercial video game industry, and the 1973 Space Race and Pong Doubles. In the game, two players move through a maze, which continually changes over time. One player, the Pursuer, attempts to catch the other, the Pursued; if they do, a point is scored, and the players reset positions. The game emits an electronic <b>beeping</b> sound, which increases in pace as the Pursuer gets closer to the Pursued, and each game lasts a set amount of time.|$|E

The repairman knew his friend did not own a camper, and it would even strike Justice J. Raymond Paris at Reyat's 1991 trial as an odd use for a timer.|$|E
25|$|The Qbot is a {{handheld}} device which park guests can rent for the day. On the device, users can select an amusement ride {{they wish to}} queue for and the device will add them to a virtual queue. The Qbot device will notify users once their virtual queue time has elapsed through vibration and <b>beeping.</b> In 2011, the Qband was introduced for use at water parks. The device, which is similar in size and shape to a watch, functions similarly to the Qbot. Currently the Qband is used at waterparks around the world including: Six Flags Hurricane Harbor, Splish Splash, Wet'nWild Sydney, Raging Waters San Dimas. The Qsmart requires users to have a smartphone which they can use to join virtual queues in a similar method to the Qbot. It replaced the Q-txt product which allowed any mobile phone to register a spot in virtual queues.|$|E

500|$|Elgato {{manufactures}} {{and markets}} a smart-key system. The system {{comes with a}} small 10-gram device that is placed on a key ring, in a purse, inside a car, or somewhere else. Then it communicates with an Elgato app on an iOS device. If it is set up for keys, the app will alert the user when they are 10 meters away from their keys, indicating {{that they may have}} forgotten them. It takes advantage of the [...] "Smart Bluetooth" [...] Apple implemented in iOS 7. A review in TheNextWeb said it was [...] "money well spent" [...] and worked [...] "exactly as described", but that the <b>beeping</b> of the device could be louder and users will still need to supplement it with the Find my Phone app. A review in Macworld gave it 4 out of 5 stars.|$|E
500|$|The {{music and}} sound effects {{received}} similar praise. GameSpot {{pointed out that}} [...] "explosions erupt with lots of satisfying, floor-rattling bass, lasers ping nicely, flamethrowers emit appropriate rumbling whooshes, and there's plenty of ambient <b>beeping,</b> hissing, and mechanical humming". Game Revolution praised the graphics for their [...] "modeling, colored lighting, incredible special effects, wonderful animation, [...] sheer overall feel". Victor Lucas of Electric Playground stated similar pros, but also admitted that the game's hardware requirements were relatively high. Criticism was leveled at the game's story. GameSpot considered it not compelling, while Jason Cross, writing for Computer Games Magazine, felt that it [...] "really doesn't {{have much to do}} with actual gameplay". PC Gamer reviewer Stephen Poole also criticized the Guide-Bot's efficiency, remarking that sometimes it can get lost or trapped while leading the player to a destination.|$|E
500|$|Music {{remained}} {{an important element}} in establishing the atmosphere of Halloween III. Just as in Halloween and Halloween II, there was no symphonic score. Much of the music was composed to solicit [...] "false startles" [...] from the audience. The soundtrack was composed by John Carpenter and Alan Howarth, who had also worked on the score for Halloween II. The score of Halloween III differed greatly from the familiar main theme of the original and its first sequel. Carpenter replaced the familiar piano melody with a slower, electronic theme played on a synthesizer with <b>beeping</b> tonalities. Howarth explains how he and Carpenter composed the music for the third film:The music style of John Carpenter and myself has further evolved in this film soundtrack by working exclusively with synthesizers to produce our music. This has led to a certain procedural routine. The film is first transferred to a time coded video tape and synchronized to a 24 track master audio recorder; then while watching the film we compose the music to these visual images. The entire process goes quite rapidly and has 'instant gratification', allowing us to evaluate the score in synch to the picture. This is quite an invaluable asset.|$|E

500|$|Gotcha is a two-player maze game {{in which}} one player {{attempts}} to catch the other. The maze is composed of a repeating pattern of elements set in multiple columns on the screen. The [...] "Pursuer" [...] is represented by a square, while the [...] "Pursued" [...] is identified by a plus sign. As the Pursuer gets closer to the Pursued, an electronic <b>beeping</b> sound plays at an increasing rate until the Pursuer reaches the Pursued. Whenever the Pursued is caught, the Pursuer scores a point, the maze disappears for a brief moment, and the Pursuer is moved to a random position {{on the right side}} of the screen. There is no score for the Pursued, so determining who won is left to the players. The maze itself is continually changing, with two invisible lines half a screen apart scanning down the maze and overwriting maze elements. Above the maze is the Pursuer's score and the time elapsed in the game. Each game is for a set period of time. When time runs out, the game enters attract mode, where the score resets and the square and plus sign begin bouncing around the maze in a diagonal pattern as the maze continues to change. Each game costs a quarter. The time per round is adjustable per machine over a range from 30 seconds to 2 minutes.|$|E
2500|$|The common {{infected}} encountered {{during the}} game are fast and agile, weak individually, but may be overwhelming in numbers. They display a special attraction to high-pitched alarm-type sounds, such as the <b>beeping</b> device attached to pipe bombs and car alarms. Common infected will often chase down the source of these noises while ignoring lower-pitched, but much louder sounds such as gunfire. They occasionally attack in masses referred to in-game as a [...] "horde".|$|E

At the site where the falling light supposedly crashed, a <b>beeping</b> transponder from a C-141 aircraft was found according to investigating Col. Mooy.|$|E
2500|$|In 1993, Nash left WCW, {{signing a}} {{contract}} with the WWF at the request of Shawn Michaels. He was given the stage name of Diesel, with the character given the nickname [...] "Big Daddy Cool". For the role, Nash grew long hair, taking on the appearance of a typical cocky biker thug, Diesel sported black sunglasses and leather garments. The name of Diesel, suggested by Shane McMahon, was a play on the fact that Nash was from Detroit, known famously as [...] "The Motor City". To play off of his character's name, Nash's initial entrance music was a simple series of truck engine noises along with loud horns <b>beeping.</b>|$|E

The four {{characters}} parodied famous characters including Superman, Wonder Woman, Batman, and Aquaman, and came with their own narrator. Aspects of Super Friends were parodied such as randomly pressing <b>beeping</b> buttons (that flash in an equally random pattern) on any computer module, invisible vehicles (somehow the Power Pals could see {{a dent in the}} invisible rocket and could be seen from the outside, since only the rocket is invisible), the perceived uselessness of Aquaman parody Wet Willy's ability to talk to fish and powerlessness outside of water and near-instantaneous travel to distant galaxies.|$|E
