5|$|In 1861, Wickliffe {{was again}} {{elected to the}} U.S. House, serving a single term. He tried to avert the Civil War by serving as a {{delegate}} to both the 1861 Peace Conference and the Border States Convention. After war was declared, he sided with the Union cause. In 1863, he again sought the office of governor, <b>but</b> <b>federal</b> military forces interfered with the election, resulting in a landslide victory for Thomas E. Bramlette. Later in life, Wickliffe was crippled in a carriage accident and also went completely blind. He died on October 31, 1869, while visiting his daughter in Maryland.|$|E

The project has had many difficulties and was highly contested by the non-local public, the Western Shoshone peoples, and many politicians. The Government Accountability Office stated that the closure was for political, not technical or safety reasons.|$|E
5|$|In , (1872) the Supreme Court {{heard another}} Civil Rights Act case {{relating}} to federal courts in Kentucky. John Blyew and George Kennard were white men visiting the cabin {{of a black}} family, the Fosters. Blyew apparently became angry with sixteen-year-old Richard Foster and hit him twice {{in the head with}} an ax. Blyew and Kennard killed Richard's parents, Sallie and Jack Foster, and his blind grandmother, Lucy Armstrong. They severely wounded the Fosters' two young daughters. Kentucky courts would not allow the Foster children to testify against Blyew and Kennard. <b>But</b> <b>federal</b> courts, authorized by the Civil Rights Act, found Blyew and Kennard guilty of murder. When the Supreme Court took the case, they ruled (5–2) that the Foster children did not have standing in federal courts because only living people could take advantage of the Act. In doing so, the Courts effectively ruled that Thirteenth Amendment did not permit a federal remedy in murder cases. Swayne and Joseph P. Bradley dissented, maintaining that in order to have meaningful effects, the Thirteenth Amendment would have to address systemic racial oppression.|$|E

25|$|The Army proved wholly {{unable to}} stem the violence. Not only were units being transferred, <b>but</b> <b>federal</b> law and {{numerous}} treaties barred the Army from attacking Indians in the Indian Territories. Although many Indians, such as the Cherokee, were trying to farm and live as settlers, the Comanche and Kiowa continued to live {{in that part of}} the Indian Territories which was traditionally the Comancheria, while raiding into Texas.|$|E
25|$|On November 23, 1963, the Tigers and Gamecocks {{were set}} to play the annual rivalry on live {{national}} TV. However, the assassination of President John F.

Clemson won the game 24–20.|$|E
25|$|Ontario police {{sergeant}} Jeff Quon, {{along with other}} officers and those they were exchanging messages with, had sued the city, their superiors and the pager service provider in federal court.

Their defense was that a superior officer had promised the pager messages themselves would not be audited if the officers reimbursed the city for fees it incurred when they exceeded a monthly character limit.|$|E

25|$|The Supreme Court {{balances}} several {{pressures to}} maintain its roles in national government. It seeks to be a co-equal branch of government, but its decrees must be enforceable. The Court seeks to minimize situations where it asserts itself superior to either President or Congress, <b>but</b> <b>federal</b> officers must be held accountable. The Supreme Court assumes power to declare acts of Congress as unconstitutional but it self-limits its passing on constitutional questions. But the Court's guidance on basic problems of life and governance in a democracy is most effective when American political life reinforce its rulings.|$|E
25|$|Ninety {{percent of}} voters voted yes, and the {{overwhelming}} support gave the Federal Government a clear mandate to implement policies to benefit Aboriginal people. A lot of misconceptions have arisen as to the outcomes of the referendum, some {{as a result of}} it taking on a symbolic meaning during a period of increasing Aboriginal self-confidence. It was some five years before any real change occurred {{as a result of the}} referendum, <b>but</b> <b>federal</b> legislation has since been enacted covering land rights, discriminatory practices, financial assistance, and preservation of cultural heritage.|$|E
25|$|Second, Reed {{helped to}} {{successfully}} defend the administration's gold policy, saving the nation's monetary policy as well. Deflation {{had caused the}} value of the United States dollar to fall nearly 60 percent. <b>But</b> <b>federal</b> law still permitted Americans and foreign citizens to redeem paper money and coins in gold at the its pre-Depression value, causing a run on the gold reserves of the United States. Taking the United States off the gold standard would stop the run. It would also further devalue the dollar, making American goods less expensive and more attractive to foreign buyers. In a series of moves, Roosevelt took the nation off the gold standard in March and April 1933, causing the dollar's value to sink. But additional deflation was needed. One way to do this was to raise the price of gold, <b>but</b> <b>federal</b> law required the Treasury to buy gold at its high, pre-Depression price. President Roosevelt asked the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to buy gold above the market price to further devalue the dollar. Although Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau, Jr. believed the government lacked the authority to buy gold, Reed joined with Treasury general counsel Herman Oliphant to provide critical legal support for the plan.|$|E

25|$|Eventually, {{all three}} {{defendants}} pleaded guilty. Rivera Lopez {{admitted that he}} had urged Escudero Aponte to set the fire and had made statements to the effect that a fire should be set, but did not admit any involvement in shielding him from view as he lit the sterno. In its plea agreements with Rivera Lopez and Jimenez Rivera, the government agreed to recommend sentences of 25 and 24 years, respectively. At the plea hearing, the government made the promised recommendations, <b>but</b> <b>federal</b> judge José A. Fusté sentenced Rivera Lopez to 99 years in prison and Jimenez Rivera to 75 years.|$|E
25|$|Although Meles and his {{administration}} claimed they preferred a united <b>but</b> <b>federal</b> state that included the Eritrean state, since Meles' TPLF fought together with EPLF, Meles originally left the decision of independence to the Eritrean citizens {{in the hope that}} the independence referendum would vote against secession, according to Time magazine's 1991 analysis. However, after the EPLF secured their borders when Mengistu's regime fell, and after the majority of Eritreans voted for independence on 24 May 1993, Isaias Afewerki became the leader of Eritrea. Many people in the Meles administration, as well as opposition parties were angry over the decision to grant Eritrea its independence.|$|E
25|$|As the day wore on, counter-battery {{fire from}} Fort Pulaski were {{gradually}} silenced as their guns were either dismounted or rendered unserviceable. Two of the Federal 10-inch columbiads jumped backwards off their carriages. The 13-inch mortars placed less than 10% rounds on target. <b>But</b> <b>Federal</b> fire proved effective from Parrott's, James rifles, and working columbiad guns. There ensued a lull from the Fort, but the Confederate gunners re-opened an energetic counter battery duel {{that required the}} Parrotts {{to give up their}} wall assignment and concentrate on the working Confederate guns until they were re-silenced. By nightfall the wall at the southeast corner had been breached. Under periodic harassing bombardment throughout the hours of darkness, Olmstead's garrison put several guns back into service.|$|E

25|$|Yearly {{passenger}} {{levels on}} Canada's passenger trains peaked at 60 million during World War II. Following the war {{the growth of}} air travel and the personal automobile caused significant loss of mode share for Canada's passenger train operators. By the 1960s {{it was obvious to}} both Canadian National Railway (CN) and the Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) that passenger trains were no longer economically viable. The CP sought to divest itself of its trains <b>but</b> <b>federal</b> government regulators and politicians balked, forcing the CP to maintain a minimal service through the 1970s, with the government subsidizing up to 80% of losses. CN, being a Crown corporation at that time, was encouraged by the federal government and political interests to invest in passenger trains. Innovative marketing schemes such as Red, White, and Blue fares, new equipment such as scenic dome cars and rail diesel cars, and services such as Rapido and the UAC TurboTrain trains temporarily increased numbers of passengers, reversing previous declines.|$|E
25|$|During the trial, Taylor {{received}} {{a series of}} anonymous letters from a person claiming to be an officer who worked with Burge. The anonymous letters asserted that what happened to Wilson {{was part of a}} decades-old pattern of police torture, led by Burge, that victimized African-American detainees. These letters led Taylor and his colleagues to other alleged torture victims, <b>but</b> <b>federal</b> court trial Judge Brian Barnett Duff did not permit the jury to hear this evidence; he held Taylor and Haas in contempt of court. After eight weeks of trial, the jury was unable to reach a verdict. The case was retried later in the year. After a second trial that lasted eight weeks, an all-white jury found Burge not guilty, but the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the verdict, based on ?. Eventually Wilson was awarded more than $1 million in attorney's fees and $100,000 in damages; the $100,000 went to the estate of the officers who were killed in 1982.|$|E
25|$|However, Lynchburg {{lost its}} battle for an interstate highway. In the late 1950s, {{interested}} citizens, including Virginia Senator Mosby G. Perrow, Jr., asked {{the federal government}} to change its long-planned route for the interstate highway now known as I-64 between Clifton Forge and Richmond. Since the 1940s, maps of the federal interstate highway system planned a northern route, missing the manufacturing centers at Lynchburg and Roanoke, <b>but</b> <b>federal</b> officials assured Virginia that the state would decide the route. Although initially favoring that northern route, Virginia's State Highway Commission eventually supported a southern route from Richmond via US-360 and US-460, which connected Lynchburg and Roanoke via US-220 from Roanoke to Clifton Forge, then continued west following US-60 into West Virginia. However, in July 1961 Governor Lindsay Almond and US Secretary of Commerce Luther Hodges announced that the route would not be changed. Thus Lynchburg became the only city with a population in excess of 50,000 (at the time) not served by an interstate.|$|E
