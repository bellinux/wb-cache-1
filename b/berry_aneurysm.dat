50|$|The term {{infected}} intracranial aneurysm {{lacks the}} properties of complete definition because {{it refers to the}} initial process that affects the arterial wall and to aneurysms found to have bacteria in their walls at the time of excision(Table 87-1, Patient 3; see Case Report 9, Fig. 87-9), but not to the processes of focal dilatation or subsequent aneurysm formation and enlargement. It also accurately describes the congenital or <b>berry</b> <b>aneurysm</b> that has become secondarily infected. The terms septic aneurysm and septic embolism and septic arteritis are also commonly used. However, the word septic refers to infection involving the blood stream and is not really descriptive of the aneurysm themselves.|$|E

40|$|Intracranial aneurysms in {{children}} are very rare and {{differ from those}} in adults in several ways. Posterior cerebral artery (peA) aneurysms are among the least common of intracranial aneurysms and little is known of their presentation and prognosis. Two cases of peA aneurysms {{in children}} are reported, and 21 other cases of peA aneurysms in patients 20 {{years of age or}} younger are reviewed. peA aneurysms in children have a marked male predominance and are usually large, symptomatic, and tend to occur proximal or distal to the circle of Willis. Diagnostic computed tomography may be warranted earlier in children than in adults with similar symptoms referable to intracranial abnormalities because children {{are more likely to have}} an organic cause for such symptoms. Cerebral aneurysms in children are rare [1 - 7], and the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) is infrequently involved by aneurysms regardless of age [8, 9]. We report two cases of PCA aneurysms in children under 5 years of age.

40|$|Although {{families}} with several members suffering a cerebral haemorrhage {{have been reported}} previously, {{a family history of}} this stroke sub-type has not yet been firmly established as a risk factor for the disease.

By using established incidence rates for cerebral haemorrhage in the population, the probability of five such unrelated events arising in any family of similar size and longevity was calculated to be 4. 9 x 10 (- 10). This family strengthens the case that an underlying genetic susceptibility does exist for a proportion of patients who have a cerebral haemorrhage.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Coil {{embolization}} of <b>berry</b> <b>aneurysms</b> is {{a relatively}} new treatment whose long-term efficacy has yet to be established. The purpose of this study was, first, to attempt to identify factors that might be important in predicting success both at the time of treatment and at the time of follow-up angiography, and, second, to study changes in the aneurysm between treatment and follow-up to determine the frequency of these changes. METHODS: The pretreatment, posttreatment, and follow-up angiograms of the first 63 an-eurysms (in 58 patients) treated at our institution between June 1992 and April 1995 were analyzed, and the percentage of occlusion of each aneurysm was calculated. The size of any rest was noted for the posttreatment and follow-up angiograms. Treatment success was defined as a residue of less than 2 mm. Aneurysms were said to have changed if the percentage of occlusion had altered by more than 2. 5 % or if the difference in rest size was greater than 0. 25 mm. Possible factors influencing primary and follow-up success rates were correlated against these calculations. RESULTS: Success rates at treatment and follow-up were 71 % and 65 %, respectively. No change occurred in 41 % of aneurysms, and 20 % had a decrease in size of the residue. Twenty...|$|R
40|$|Arteriosclerosis is {{a general}} term for atherosclerosis, Monckeberg {{arteriosclerosis}} and arteriolosclerosis, all of which involve sclerosis of blood vessels. Atherosclerosis is a progressive disease characterized by the formation of atheromas and fibrous plaques in the intima. Plaques, which may be stable or unstable, are complicated by ulceration, hemorrhage and calcification. Unstable plaques are more cellular and tend to hemorrhage. The pathogenesis of atherosclerosis is still uncertain, but reaction to injury formulation theory is widely accepted. Monckeberg arteriosclerosis is characterized by medial calcification, which does not obstruct arterial flow. Arteriolosclerosis is characterized by hyaline thickening or proliferative change in small arteries, which are usually associated with hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Aneurysms are abnormal dilatations of blood vessels, and are of several types. <b>Berry</b> <b>aneurysms</b> are small saccular lesions most often seen {{in the circle of}} Willis, but are unrelated to atherosclerosis. A dissecting aneurysm is a longitudinal intraluminal tear, usually in the walls of the ascending aorta. Cystic medial necrosis is a major cause of dissection, which is associated with Marfan syndrome. Connective tissue defects are typical of Marfan 2 ̆ 7 s syndrome. Vasculitis is classified by vessel size. Necrotizing arthritis is usually mediated by immune mechanisms, particularly immune complex depositions...|$|R
40|$|Summary: We {{present a}} case of an {{aneurysm}} of an azygos pericallosal artery diagnosed on conventional MR imaging and MR angiography, and confirmed with conventional angiography and at surgical exploration. Index terms: Arteries, Callosal (pericallosal); Aneurysm, mag-netic resonance The azygos pericallosal artery represents a rare anatomic variant where only a single enlarged pericallosal artery is present {{instead of the usual}} two. The azygos pericallosal artery divides in the region of the genu of the corpus callosum, send-ing out branches to supply the mesial surfaces of both cerebral hemispheres. Although rare, with a reported incidence of between 0. 2 % and 4 % (1 - 3), its greatest significance rests in the high fre-quency of <b>berry</b> <b>aneurysms</b> noted to occur at its bifurcation. Case Report A 41 -year-old woman with no significant history of past medical or psychological problems presented to medical attention complaining of a single episode of right body (face, arm, leg) weakness and numbness that lasted for 1 hr and then resolved. These symptoms may have been associated with an anxiety attack. At the time of her neurologic evaluation, her physical examination and labo-ratory blood analyses were noted to be unremarkable.
