5|$|Solar water {{disinfection}} (SODIS) involves exposing water-filled plastic polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles to sunlight for several hours. Exposure times {{vary depending on}} weather and climate from a minimum of six hours to two days during fully overcast conditions. It is recommended <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Health</b> Organization as a viable method for household water treatment and safe storage. Over two million people in developing countries use this method for their daily drinking water.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{emergence}} of MDR-TB, surgery has been re-introduced for certain cases of TB infections. It involves removal of infected chest cavities ("bullae") in the lungs {{to reduce the number of}} bacteria and to increase exposure of the remaining bacteria to antibiotics in the bloodstream. Hopes of completely eliminating TB were ended with the rise of drug-resistant strains in the 1980s. The subsequent resurgence of tuberculosis resulted in the declaration of a global health emergency <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Health</b> Organization in 1993.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{widespread}} use of poliovirus vaccine in the mid-1950s, the incidence of poliomyelitis declined dramatically in many industrialized countries. A global effort to eradicate polio began in 1988, led <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Health</b> Organization, UNICEF, and The Rotary Foundation. These efforts have reduced the number of annual diagnosed cases by 99.9 percent; from an estimated 350,000 cases in 1988 to a low of 483 cases in 2001, after which it remained at a level of about 1,000 - 2000 cases per year for a number of years. In 2015, cases decreased to 98 and further decreased in 2016 to 37 wild cases and 5 circulating vaccine-derived cases.|$|E

5|$|Hypothyroidism may be {{prevented}} {{in a population}} by adding iodine to commonly used foods. This public health measure has eliminated endemic childhood hypothyroidism in countries where it was once common. In addition to promoting the consumption of iodine-rich foods such as dairy and fish, many countries with moderate iodine deficiency have implemented universal salt iodization (USI). Encouraged <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Health</b> Organization, 130 countries now have USI, and 70% of the world's population are receiving iodized salt. In some countries, iodized salt is added to bread. Despite this, iodine deficiency has reappeared in some Western countries {{as a result of}} attempts to reduce salt intake.|$|E
5|$|The WHO Model List of Essential Medicines (EML), {{published}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Health</b> Organization (WHO), {{contains the}} medications {{considered to be}} most effective and safe to meet the most important needs in a health system. The list is frequently used by countries to help develop their own local lists of essential medicine. As of 2016, more than 155 countries have created national lists of essential medicines based on the World Health Organization's model list. This includes countries in both the developed and developing world.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{development}} of vaccines in the mid-1950s, mass vaccination campaigns took place in many countries. In the US, after a campaign promoted by the March of Dimes, the annual number of polio cases fell dramatically; the last outbreak was in 1979. In 1988 the World Health Organisation along with others launched the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, and by 1994 the Americas were declared {{to be free of}} disease, followed by the Pacific region in 2000 and Europe in 2003. At the end of 2012, only 223 cases were reported <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Health</b> Organisation. Mainly poliovirus type 1 infections, 122 occurred in Nigeria, one in Chad, 58 in Pakistan and 37 in Afghanistan. Vaccination teams often face danger; seven vaccinators were murdered in Pakistan and nine in Nigeria at the beginning of 2013. In Pakistan, the campaign was further hampered by the murder on 26 February 2013 of a police officer who was providing security.|$|E

5|$|Frequent {{hand washing}} {{reduces the risk}} of viral spread. Wearing a {{surgical}} mask is also useful. Yearly vaccinations against influenza are recommended <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Health</b> Organization for those at high risk. The vaccine is usually effective against three or four types of influenza. It is usually well tolerated. A vaccine made for one year may not be useful in the following year, since the virus evolves rapidly. Antiviral drugs such as the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir, among others, have been used to treat influenza. Their benefits in those who are otherwise healthy {{do not appear to be}} greater than their risks. No benefit has been found in those with other health problems.|$|E
5|$|The {{infection}} {{has been}} preventable by vaccination since 1982. Vaccination is recommended <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Health</b> Organization {{in the first}} day of life if possible. Two or three more doses are required at a later time for full effect. This vaccine works about 95% of the time. About 180 countries gave the vaccine as part of national programs as of 2006. It is also recommended that all blood be tested for hepatitis B before transfusion and condoms be used to prevent infection. During an initial infection, care is based on the symptoms that a person has. In those who develop chronic disease, antiviral medication such as tenofovir or interferon may be useful; however, these drugs are expensive. Liver transplantation is sometimes used for cirrhosis.|$|E
5|$|Balaji Sadasivan {{was born}} on 11 July 1955 in Singapore, the son of Indian immigrants. A student at Raffles Institution, Siglap Secondary School (1969–1971) and National Junior College (1972–1973), he {{subsequently}} studied medicine at the University of Singapore. In his second year, he won an essay competition organised <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Health</b> Organization (WHO) and received the opportunity to attend a healthcare workshop in Minamata, Japan, where he learned about the devastating effects of Minamata disease, a neurological syndrome caused by severe mercury poisoning. This led him to specialise in neurosurgery later on, which was not a popular discipline at the time. In 1979, Sadasivan graduated with a Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (M.B.B.S.), {{and two years later}} embarked on further studies at the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow, becoming a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons (F.R.C.S.) in 1984. He trained at the Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, Michigan, between 1985 and 1990, obtaining a diploma from the American Board of Neurology Surgery and becoming a fellow at Harvard University in 1990. He also worked at Brigham and Women's Hospital, a teaching affiliate of Harvard, and at the Children's Hospital Boston in Boston, Massachusetts. In 1997, he obtained a Bachelor of Laws (LL.B. (Hons.)) from the University of London.|$|E

5|$|Further funds {{came from}} the United States Agency for International Development, which offered US$25,000 by mid-January. The French Polynesian {{assembly}} in Tahiti also provided US$770,000 worth of relief supplies and aid. The main industry of Tonga, tourism, was devastated by the storm as no tourists were allowed {{to travel to the}} region for at least two weeks after Waka's passage. The Government of Tonga requested a total of US$39.2million in international aid, most of which was dedicated to rehabilitation of infrastructure. Medical supplies and personnel were later deployed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Health</b> Organization. In early March, a relief fund based on donations was set up by the United Methodist Committee on Relief to provide US$210,000 for 30 families impacted by the storm. About 180 people were given assistance in rebuilding their homes by the Church World Service later that month. As food shortages became severe in April, emergency supplies were sent to the outlying Niuas islands of Tonga. In May, US$5.85million was approved for emergency funds by the World Bank to assist in infrastructural rehabilitation.|$|E
5|$|Other {{tests are}} {{sometimes}} {{used for the}} detection of alcohol dependence, such as the Alcohol Dependence Data Questionnaire, which is a more sensitive diagnostic test than the CAGE questionnaire. It helps distinguish a diagnosis of alcohol dependence from one of heavy alcohol use. The Michigan Alcohol Screening Test (MAST) is a screening tool for alcoholism widely used by courts to determine the appropriate sentencing for people convicted of alcohol-related offenses, driving under the influence being the most common. The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), a screening questionnaire developed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Health</b> Organization, is unique in that it has been validated in six countries and is used internationally. Like the CAGE questionnaire, it uses a simple set of questions – a high score earning a deeper investigation. The Paddington Alcohol Test (PAT) was designed to screen for alcohol-related problems amongst those attending Accident and Emergency departments. It concords well with the AUDIT questionnaire but is administered in a fifth of the time. Certain blood tests may also indicate possible alcoholism.|$|E
5|$|Rolling {{stock on}} the New York City Subway {{produces}} {{high levels of}} noise that exceed guidelines set <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Health</b> Organization and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. In 2006, Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health found noise levels averaged 95 decibel (dB) inside subway cars and 94dB on platforms. Daily exposure to noise at such levels {{for as little as}} 30 minutes can lead to hearing loss. Noise on one in 10 platforms exceeded 100dB. Under WHO and EPA guidelines, noise exposure at that level is limited to 1.5 minutes. A subsequent study by Columbia and the University of Washington found higher average noise levels in the subway (80.4dB) than on commuter trains including Port Authority Trans-Hudson (PATH) (79.4dB), Metro-North (75.1dB) and Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) (74.9dB). Since the decibel scale is a logarithmic scale, sound at 95dB is 10 times more intense than at 85dB, 100 times more intense than at 75dB, and so forth. In the second study, peak subway noise registered at 102.1dB.|$|E

5|$|Several {{recent studies}} attempt {{to examine the}} effects of chronic low-dose {{manganese}} overexposure on child development. The earliest study was conducted in the Chinese province of Shanxi. Drinking water there had been contaminated through improper sewage irrigation and contained 240–350µg Mn/L. Although Mn concentrations at or below 300µg Mn/L were considered safe at the time of the study by the US EPA and 400µg Mn/L <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Health</b> Organization, the 92 children sampled (between 11 and 13 years of age) from this province displayed lower performance on tests of manual dexterity and rapidity, short-term memory, and visual identification, compared to children from an uncontaminated area. More recently, a study of 10-year-old children in Bangladesh showed a relationship between Mn concentration in well water and diminished IQ scores. A third study conducted in Quebec examined school children between the ages of 6 and 15 living in homes that received water from a well containing 610µg Mn/L; controls lived in homes that received water from a 160µg Mn/L well. Children in the experimental group showed increased hyperactive and oppositional behavior.|$|E
5|$|The various health {{problems}} associated with long-term alcohol consumption are generally perceived as detrimental to society, for example, money due to lost labor-hours, medical costs due to injuries due to drunkenness and organ damage from long-term use, and secondary treatment costs, such as the costs of rehabilitation facilities and detoxification centers. Alcohol use is a major contributing factor for head injuries, motor vehicle accidents (due to drunk driving), domestic violence, and assaults. Beyond the financial costs that alcohol consumption imposes, there are also significant social costs to both the alcoholic and their family and friends. For instance, alcohol consumption by a pregnant woman can lead to fetal alcohol syndrome, an incurable and damaging condition. Estimates of the economic costs of alcohol abuse, collected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Health</b> Organization, vary from one to six percent of a country's GDP. One Australian estimate pegged alcohol's social costs at 24% of all drug abuse costs; a similar Canadian study concluded alcohol's share was 41%. One study quantified {{the cost to the}} UK of all forms of alcohol misuse in 2001 as £18.5–20 billion. All economic costs in the United States in 2006 have been estimated at $223.5 billion.|$|E
