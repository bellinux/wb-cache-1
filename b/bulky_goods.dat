5000|$|Ammonium {{bicarbonate}} {{is used in}} {{the food}} industry as a raising agent for flat baked goods, such as cookies and crackers, and in China in steamed buns and Chinese almond cookies. It was commonly used in the home before modern day baking powder was made available. In China it is called edible or food-grade [...] "smelly powder". Many baking cookbooks (especially from Scandinavian countries) may still refer to it as hartshorn or hornsalt [...] (e.g., FI: [...] "hirvensarvisuola", NO: [...] "hjortetakksalt", DK: [...] "hjortetakssalt", SE: [...] "hjorthornssalt", [...] "salt of hart's horn", DE: [...] "Hirschhornsalz"). Although there is a slight smell of ammonia during baking, this quickly dissipates, leaving no taste. It is used in, for example, Swedish [...] "drömmar" [...] biscuits and Danish Christmas biscuits (Hjortetakssalt), and German Lebkuchen. In many cases it may be substituted with baking soda or baking powder or a combination of both, depending on the recipe composition and leavening requirements. Compared to baking soda or potash, hartshorn has the advantage of producing more gas for the same amount of agent, and of not leaving any salty or soapy taste in the finished product, as it completely decomposes into water and gaseous products that evaporate during baking. It cannot be used for moist, <b>bulky</b> baked <b>goods</b> however, such as normal bread or cakes, since some ammonia will be trapped inside and will cause an unpleasant taste.|$|R

Results are shown on synthetic scenes under different conditions and on some scenes generated from images. Lastly, we initiate discussion on varying quality levels in IBR and show a way to create representations using DIs with different trade-offs between model size and rendering quality.

For all treatments, life table estimates of survival at I and 2 years were only 10 % and 4 % respectively. Although the results of chemotherapy for malignant melanoma vary between institutions {{and according to the}} criteria used to evaluate response, it is well recognised that its efficacy is disappointing. In order to improve on these results, several possible avenues have been open for exploration. First the dosage of drugs can be escalated. Using this approach, we have used high dose melphalan (HDM) and high dose BCNU (HDBCNU) with autologous bone marro...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the effect of {{cyclical}} and structural factors on the decline of maquiladora employment. In addition to the US industrial production, the cyclical factors examined are relative Mexican US wages, the Mexican exchange rate relative to the US, and US foreign direct investment (FDI). The paper also explores the effect of competition from China, a structural effect, on the decline of maquiladora employment. Design/methodology/approach – A vector error correction (VEC) model of maquila employment for the period 1980 - 2002 is estimated and controlled for US industrial production, FDI flows, relative wage rates of Mexico and USA. To empirically investigate the structural differences of lower costs in Mexico vs China a seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) is estimated across three sectors: apparel and textile, electronic, and transportation. Findings – From the VEC maquila employment model it is found that, in addition to the strong effect of US industrial production on the maquila employment, there exist significant short- and long-run effects of Mexico US exchange rate and Mexican wages relative to USA on maquila employment. The sectoral (SUR) model shows that competition from China has a bigger adverse effect on relatively labor-intensive good and commodities which are cheaper to transport (such as textiles) over more <b>bulky</b> transportation <b>goods.</b> The transportation sector has a location advantage, though is more sensitive to the cyclical fluctuations in the US industrial production. Research limitations/implications – Future research should investigate the role of USA and world FDI exclusively into Mexico and maquiladora sector. Practical implications – Well designed controls, output choice, and location advantage are important for the growth and viability of small scale manufacturing industries. Originality/value – The VEC model for maquila employment and the SUR framework across main maquila sectors is the first to account for wages, exchange rate, and FDI in addition to the US industrial production in understanding the decline in maquiladora employment.

40|$|Glutathione (GSH) plays a {{critical}} role in many cellular processes, including the metabolism and detoxification of oxidants, metals, and other reactive electrophilic compounds of both endogenous and exogenous origin. Because the liver is a major site of GSH and glutathione S-conjugate biosynthesis and export, significant effort has been devoted to characterizing liver cell sinusoidal and canalicular membrane transporters for these compounds. Glutathione S-conjugates synthesized in the liver are secreted preferentially into bile, and recent studies in isolated canalicular membrane vesicles indicate that there are multiple transport mechanisms for these conjugates, including those that are energized by ATP hydrolysis and those that may be driven by the electrochemical gradient. Glutathione S-conjugates that are relatively hydrophobic or have a <b>bulky</b> S-substituent are <b>good</b> substrates for the canalicular ATP-dependent transporter mrp 2 (multidrug resistance-associated protein 2, also called cMOAT, the canalicular multispecific organic anion transporter, or cMrp, the canalicular isoform of mrp). In contrast with the glutathione S-conjugates, hepatic GSH is released into both blood and bile. GSH transport across both of these membrane domains is of low affinity and is energized by the electrochemical potential. Recent reports describe two candidate GSH transport proteins for the canalicular and sinusoidal membranes (RcGshT and RsGshT, respectively); however, some concerns have been raised regarding these studies. Additional work is needed to characterize GSH transporters at the functional and molecular level...|$|R
