5|$|In February 2011, Marvel Comics {{launched}} the eight-issue digital comic Captain America: First Vengeance, {{on the same}} day as the first trailer aired. Written by Fred Van Lente and featuring a rotation of artists, the story is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Each of the eight issues focuses on a specific character from the movie, heroes and villains alike, and what <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> point where the movie begins.|$|E
5|$|The Beatles members John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, Stuart Sutcliffe and Pete Best {{regularly}} {{performed at}} different clubs in Hamburg, Northern Germany, {{during the period}} from August 1960 to December 1962; a chapter in the group's history which honed their performance skills, widened their reputation, and led to their first recording, which <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> attention of Brian Epstein.|$|E
5|$|The National Science Foundation (NSF) funded an extremophile {{sampling}} {{expedition to}} Lōʻihi in 1999. Microbial mats surrounded the 160°C vents, and included a novel jelly-like organism. Samples were collected for study at NSF's Marine Bioproducts Engineering Center (MarBEC). In 2001, PiscesV collected {{samples of the}} organisms and <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> surface for study.|$|E

5|$|Quest left South Georgia on 18 January, heading {{south-east}} {{towards the}} South Sandwich Islands. There {{was a heavy}} swell, such that the overladen ship frequently dipped its gunwales below the waves, filling the waist with water. As they proceeded, Wild wrote that Quest rolled like a log, leaked and required regular pumping, was heavy on coal consumption, and was slow. All these factors led him to change his plan {{at the end of}} January. Bouvet Island was abandoned in favour of a more southerly course that <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> edge of the pack ice on 4 February.|$|E
5|$|The koala is {{featured}} in the Dreamtime stories and mythology of indigenous Australians. The Tharawal people believed that the animal helped row the boat that <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> continent. Another myth tells of how a tribe killed a koala and used its long intestines to create a bridge for people {{from other parts of}} the world. This narrative highlights the koala's status as a game animal and the length of its intestines. Several stories tell of how the koala lost its tail. In one, a kangaroo cuts it off to punish the koala for being lazy and greedy. Tribes in both Queensland and Victoria regarded the koala as a wise animal and sought its advice. Bidjara-speaking people credited the koala for turning barren lands into lush forests. The animal is also depicted in rock carvings, though not as much as some other species.|$|E
5|$|UCF got {{the ball}} to start the game at their nine-yard line after a penalty on the kickoff return, and their junior quarterback Blake Bortles orchestrated an {{efficient}} drive in which he converted two third downs and was 6/7 passing for 65 yards and a 4-yard touchdown pass to Storm Johnson. Penn State took over and got two first downs, the latter of which as a fourth down conversion, before a 44-yard pass to Allen Robinson immediately followed by a 6-yard touchdown run by Zach Zwinak to tie the game. Penn State moved the ball on their next drive, but ultimately turned the ball over on downs giving UCF good field position, with which they ran a two play drive culminating with a 58-yard touchdown run by Johnson to make it 14–7 UCF. Penn State's special teams responded with a 44-yard kickoff return by Geno Lewis, but their offense went three-and-out, and though they punted the ball deep into UCF territory, the Knights marched down the field with a strong running game and scored another touchdown to go up 21–7. On Penn State's ensuing drive, Sam Ficken kicked a career-long 47-yard field goal. UCF got some decent yardage on their next drive, but Bortles threw his first interception since October 27, 2012 with 1:17 in the half, but they ran down the clock and Ficken missed his first field goal attempt of the season, a 57-yard try as time expired. At the half, UCF had 290 total yards including 170 rushing yards, compared to 220 total yards for Penn State with only 89 rushing yards. Penn State {{got the ball}} to start the second half, but punted on their first drive. UCF responded with a touchdown via a 25-yard pass. Penn State came right back with a touchdown of their own. UCF's ensuing drive <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> one yard line, but Penn State held them to a field goal, making the score 31–17. Zwinak rushed for his third touchdown of the game on Penn State's next drive, and Shawn Moffitt kicked his second field goal of the game. Penn State drove 51 yards on their next drive before Zwinak lost a fumble with 5:43 remaining in the game. UCF went three-and-out, and on their punt, the snap went over the punter's head, and Penn State got the ball at the UCF 25. Penn State took advantage, scoring on a 5-yard touchdown pass to Allen Robinson with 57 seconds left. Penn State needed to regain possession of the ball after the score, and failed to do so, so ultimately UCF held on to win by three.|$|E

25|$|The Inspiral Carpets {{were formed}} in Oldham in 1986. The line-up was Clint Boon (organ), Stephen Holt (vocals – Tom Hingley would not join {{up until the}} {{beginning}} of 1989), Graham Lambert (guitar), Martyn Walsh (bass) and Craig Gill (drums). They released a flexi-disc a year later, and in 1988 the Planecrash EP (on their own Cow Records) <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> attention of John Peel.|$|E
25|$|Controversy also existed {{over how}} the missing reports came to light. Chief Thompson claimed that he {{independently}} reviewed all the key documents in the case, realized the reports' importance, and <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> attenion of the inspector general. But the inspector general's office said it {{sent a letter to}} Thompson demanding the reports, and only then were they turned over. Speculation that DCFEMS purposefully withheld the reports rose when City Council member Phil Mendelson alleged that he requested the reports in January 2006 and the department never delivered them.|$|E
25|$|In April 1914, McClellan {{took part}} in the United States {{occupation}} of Veracruz, Mexico, following the Tampico Affair earlier that month. McClellan sailed from Galveston, Texas with a destroyer escort and three other transports carrying a total of 4,000 troops, arriving off Veracruz on the 27th. After a brief battle, U.S. forces established control of the port and remained in occupation for six months. The incident precipitated a considerable worsening of relations between the two countries, and is said to have <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> brink of all-out war.|$|E

25|$|In {{the last}} {{session of the}} second day, Kartik took four wickets, and despite six double-digit scores Essex {{completed}} the day on 134 for 6, only leading by 61 runs. Sajid Mahmood then took two {{on the third day}} to finish Essex off for 227, setting Lancashire 155 to win, and a 106-run opening stand between Mark Chilton and Iain Sutcliffe <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> brink. Two wickets from Kaneria did not stop them, as Law hit an unbeaten 13 to power on to an eight-wicket victory, Sutcliffe ending with 80 not out as Lancashire won by eight wickets.|$|E
25|$|Following their arduous journey, {{the pair}} of no-longer-neophyte photographers {{returned}} to Paris and made prints from their 18x24 cm negatives which were made using a waxed-paper process. Having developed the negatives, each man kept a personal album of the prints. The young Hunt showed his to the German naturalist and explorer Alexander von Humboldt, who <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> attention of the King of Prussia, and Hunt made a formal gift of 11 prints to Karl Richard Lepsius, the German founder {{of the study of}} ancient Egyptology. Baker left his album with a New York dealer to discern commercial interest in the prints.|$|E
25|$|The {{chairman}} of the trust {{at that time was}} P. W. Gledhill, a trustee from 1924 until his death in 1962 and whose enthusiasm for the project left many visible marks on the cemetery. Gledhill rescued endangered monuments of all sorts and <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cemetery, where they contribute to the landscape. These include the Erskineville water fountain, a longitude and latitude marker on a plinth made out of salvaged pieces of Camperdown Villa, and the pediment from the Maritime Services Board building dating from the 1850s. In the 1960s the gateposts of the entrance were set further apart, and new gates were installed in memory of Gledhill.|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} World War II, {{competing}} Russian, British, and US {{military and}} scientific crews raced to capture technology and trained personnel from the German rocket program at Peenemünde. Russia and Britain had some success, but the United States benefited the most. The US captured {{a large number of}} German rocket scientists, including von Braun, and <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United States as part of Operation Paperclip. In America, the same rockets that were designed to rain down on Britain were used instead by scientists as research vehicles for developing the new technology further. The V-2 evolved into the American Redstone rocket, used in the early space program.|$|E
25|$|During {{the fall}} of Troy, Helen's role is ambiguous. In Virgil's Aeneid, Deiphobus gives an account of Helen's treacherous stance: when the Trojan Horse was {{admitted}} into the city, she feigned Bacchic rites, leading a chorus of Trojan women, and, holding a torch among them, she signaled to the Greeks from the city's central tower. In Odyssey, however, Homer narrates a different story: Helen circled the Horse three times, and she imitated {{the voices of the}} Greek women left behind at home—she thus tortured the men inside (including Odysseus and Menelaus) with the memory of their loved ones, and <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> brink of destruction.* Hughes, Helen of Troy, 220; Suzuki, Metamorphoses of Helen, 99–100.|$|E
25|$|A Welshman {{of noble}} birth, Saint Petroc was educated in Ireland. He {{set out in}} a small boat with a few followers. In a type of peregrinatio, they let God {{determine}} their course. The winds and tides <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Padstow estuary. Kevin of Glendalough was a student of Petroc. Saint Endelienta {{was the daughter of}} the Welsh king Brychan. She also travelled to Cornwall to evangelize the locals. Her brother Nectan of Hartland worked in Devon. Saint Piran is the patron saint of tin miners. An Irishman, he is said to have floated across to Cornwall after being thrown into the sea tied to a millstone. He has been identified on occasion with Ciarán of Saigir.|$|E

50|$|Canon Fronsac wines {{were very}} {{famous in the}} 17th and 18th century, when the Duke of Richelieu <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> {{repeatedly}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> court of the King of France, over time reserving the whole harvest of Canon Fronsac wine for the nobility.|$|R
25|$|Fourier {{used the}} work of Laplace and Lagrange to solve the heat {{equation}} by separation of variables in his famous 1822 book Théorie analytique de la chaleur. Sturm developed Fourier's ideas further and <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> attention of Cauchy, who combined them with his own ideas and arrived {{at the fact that}} real symmetric matrices have real eigenvalues. This was extended by Hermite in 1855 to what are now called Hermitian matrices. Around the same time, Brioschi proved that the eigenvalues of orthogonal matrices lie on the unit circle, and Clebsch found the corresponding result for skew-symmetric matrices. Finally, Weierstrass clarified an important aspect in the stability theory started by Laplace by realizing that defective matrices can cause instability.|$|E
25|$|Roquentin's {{difficulties}} as {{arising from}} man's inherent existential condition. His seemingly special circumstances (returning from travel, reclusiveness), which {{goes beyond the}} mere indication of his very real depression, are supposed to induce in him (and in the reader) a state that makes one more receptive to noticing an existential situation that everyone has, but may not be sensitive enough to let become noticeable. Roquentin undergoes a strange metaphysical experience that estranges him from the world. His problems are not merely a result of personal insanity, without larger significance. Rather, like {{the characters in the}} Dostoevsky and Rilke novels, they are victims of larger ideological, social, and existential forces that have <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> brink of insanity. Sartre's point in Nausea is to comment on our universal reaction to these common external problems.|$|E
25|$|When New England {{author and}} Indian-rights activist Helen Hunt Jackson toured the Indian villages of Southern California in 1883, she was {{appalled by the}} racism of the Anglos living there. She wrote that they treated Indians worse than animals, hunted them for sport, robbed them of their farmlands, and <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> edge of extermination. While Indians were {{depicted}} by whites as lazy and shiftless, she found most {{of them to be}} hard-working craftsmen and farmers. Jackson's tour inspired her to write her 1884 novel, Ramona, which she hoped would give a human face to the atrocities and indignities suffered by the Indians in California. And it did. The novel was enormously successful, inspiring four movies and a yearly pageant in Hemet, California. Many of the Indian villages of Southern California survived because of her efforts, including Morongo, Cahuilla, Soboba, Temecula, Pechanga, and Warner Hot Springs.|$|E
50|$|In 1953, Nagy {{traveled}} to Germany {{to examine a}} unique precast concrete manufacturing machine called a Hollowcore extruder. Though damaged by a World War II bomb, Nagy purchased the extruder and its patents and <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United States.|$|R
