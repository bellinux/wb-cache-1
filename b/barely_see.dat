One day on the beach, Anna asks if he would like to swim with her and her friends. Nemo insults her friends and they <b>barely</b> <b>see</b> each other again.|$|E
25|$|Hardwick {{successfully}} {{defended his}} title against Black Canadian boxer Sonny Jones at the Valley Arena in Holyoke, Massachusetts on November 15, 1937, in a bout refereed by former world heavyweight champ Jack Sharkey. Hardwick scored a technical knock {{out in the}} sixth round of their 15-round bout. He had devastated Jones in the third with a right to his jaw and opened a cut over Sonny's left eye with another right. Eventually, Sharkey stopped the fight as Jones could <b>barely</b> <b>see.</b>|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of 21 January 1807 Galatea was {{off the coast of}} Venezuela when she sighted a sail {{steering}} for La Guaira. Galatea approached and identified the vessel as a man-of-war; she then change her course, heading for Barcelona, Anzoátegui, which lay some 160 miles to the east. By noon Galatea was becalmed; {{at the same time a}} slight breeze enabled Galateas quarry to continue on her way. Two hours later lookouts could <b>barely</b> <b>see</b> her highest sails above the horizon.|$|E

25|$|The south {{church is}} a square room surmounted by a dome, and {{surrounded}} by two deambulatoria, an esonarthex and a parekklesion (added later). The north deambulatorium is the south parekklesion of the north church. This multiplication of spaces around {{the central part of}} the church is typical of the late Palaiologian architecture: the reason of that was the need for more space for tombs, monuments erected to benefactors of the church, etc. The central room is divided from the aisles by a triple arcade. During the mass the believers were confined in the deambulatoria, which were shallow and dark, and could <b>barely</b> <b>see</b> what happened in {{the central part of the}} church.|$|E
25|$|In her day-to-day life, {{when things}} are too boring or upsetting, Selma slips into daydreams or perhaps a trance-like state where she imagines the {{ordinary}} circumstances and individuals around her have erupted into elaborate musical theater numbers. These songs use some sort of real-life noise (from factory machines buzzing {{to the sound of}} a flag rapping against a flag pole in the wind) as an underlying rhythm. Unfortunately, Selma slips into one such trance while working at the factory. Soon Jeff and Cvalda begin to realize that Selma can <b>barely</b> <b>see</b> at all. Additionally, Bill reveals to Selma that his materialistic wife Linda spends more than his salary, there is no money left from his inheritance, and he is behind in payments and the bank is going to take his house. He asks Selma for a loan, but she declines. He regrets telling Selma his secret. To comfort Bill, Selma reveals her secret blindness, hoping that together they can keep each other's secret. Bill then hides in the corner of Selma's home, knowing she can't see him, and watches as she puts some money in her kitchen tin.|$|E
500|$|Director of {{photography}} Bill Roe later {{stated that he}} borrowed motifs from Steven Soderbergh's 2000 film Traffic {{for some of the}} shots. In addition, before filming, he decided to do various test shots to get the lighting right. The crew ended up shooting [...] "exteriors three, four stops over what you should shoot it at", resulting in very washed out outdoor scenes. Roe and his crew had a hard time developing the various lighting contrasts for the episode. When talking about the episode, Roe said: [...] "it was really dark so we had this huge contrast of lighting. It was dark and warm and brown. When you go inside, you can <b>barely</b> <b>see</b> things, but when you're outside, it's just blaring." [...] To create the Mexican town featured in the episode, scenes were filmed at a small town located outside of Los Angeles. A matte of the town's background and blue sky were then cut and a faux Mexican background was added. In addition, Mat Beck was given a flyer, and he duplicated it, making several strings of posters that did not exist when the shots were filmed.|$|E

25|$|Tics {{must also}} be {{distinguished}} from fasciculations. Small twitches of the upper or lower eyelid, for example, are not tics, {{because they do not}} involve a whole muscle. They are twitches of a few muscle fibre bundles, which can be felt but <b>barely</b> <b>seen.</b>|$|R

6000|$|The sound {{steadily}} approached them. Nasmyth {{found something}} mysterious and rather eerie in it, {{and he was}} on the whole relieved when a dark figure materialized among the trees near by. He could <b>barely</b> <b>see</b> it, but Lisle called out sharply: ...|$|E
60|$|For {{several moments}} she listened. There {{was no sound}} from the great house, whose outline she could <b>barely</b> <b>see</b> but whose long row of lights {{stretched}} out behind her. She turned her head and looked along the grass-grown lane beyond the gate. There {{was no one in}} sight--no sound. She lifted the latch and passed through.|$|E

It is small truly, so small that I can <b>barely</b> <b>see</b> it, nevertheless it is not {{more than half a}} bow-shot off. Do you object to make that your mark?" ...|$|E
60|$|They {{turned back}} towards {{the door of the}} hut, Gallwey a few paces behind the trooper, who thrust the door open. Gallwey could <b>barely</b> <b>see</b> him, for they were in the deep shadow of the trees. Just after Standish strolled in, there came the sound of a scuffle out of the darkness. Then there was a crash, a cry, and the thud of a heavy fall.|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{will examine}} how Marchant's works {{interrogate}} the totalities {{of class and}} gender with fragments lifted from the artist's autobiographical frame. It will attempt to show how her temporary, minimal and <b>barely</b> <b>seen</b> interventions oppose the visibility of much public art and create powerful discursive spaces {{about the nature of}} place...|$|R
50|$|It {{was on one}} of her rounds on 41st Street, in December 1873, that {{a tenant}} of a {{building}} approached Wheeler and spoke of a family, the Connollys, that once resided there. They apparently had with them a little daughter that was <b>barely</b> <b>seen</b> but her screams and the mother’s, Mary Connolly, brutality, were often heard.|$|R
6000|$|... "No chance, I fear, of our ever meeting again," [...] remarked the mate, as he cast a wistful {{look at the}} {{southern}} horizon where the sail of the long-boat could be <b>barely</b> <b>seen</b> like the wing of a sea-gull. [...] "Your lot has been cast with us, Mr Brooke, so you'll {{have to make the}} best of it." ...|$|R
60|$|Slagg was right. After the {{planking}} {{had been}} secured and the rope refastened, those unfortunates {{found themselves in}} an unenviable position. The gale had indeed abated somewhat, though the heaving of the great waves was little less tremendous, but the night had settled down {{into a state of}} pitchy darkness, so that they could <b>barely</b> <b>see</b> each other's faces, while the seas continually washed over them, obliging them {{to hold on to the}} ropes for fear of being washed away.|$|E
60|$|Once {{the hero}} was thrown headlong on a rock, and so {{severely}} bruised {{that he lost}} hold of the rope, and when swept off again was left foundering in the foam. His comrades could <b>barely</b> <b>see</b> that {{something had happened to}} him, and a loud cry of consternation arose when they felt the line run light and slack. But our hero caught it again, and the cry was changed to a cheer as they ran him out to the vessel's side.|$|E
60|$|That whisper {{takes the}} voice Of a Spirit's compassionings Close, but invisible, And throws me under a spell At the {{kindling}} vision it brings; And {{for a moment}} I rejoice, And believe in transcendent things That would mould from this muddy earth A spot for the splendid birth Of everlasting lives, Whereto no night arrives; And this gaunt gray gallery A tabernacle of worth On this drab-aired afternoon, When you can <b>barely</b> <b>see</b> Across its hazed lacune If opposite aught there be Of fleshed humanity Wherewith I may commune; Or if the voice so near Be a soul's voice floating here.|$|E
500|$|Photographs of Baker {{are unique}} among nuclear {{detonation}} pictures. The searing, blinding flash that usually obscures the target area took place underwater and was <b>barely</b> <b>seen.</b> The clear image of {{ships in the}} foreground and background gives a sense of scale. The large Wilson cloud and the vertical water column are distinctive Baker shot features. One picture shows a mark where the 27,000-ton battleship [...] was.|$|R

50|$|Wider {{events are}} <b>barely</b> <b>seen,</b> though they {{obviously}} have an influence. In 1986, when {{the play was}} written, Nelson Mandela was still in prison. By 1993, when the film was released, he was free but the future was still very uncertain. Bopha says little about such matters. This is a conflict in a small township involving people of which the outside world would not have heard.|$|R
60|$|Bad though things looked {{when there}} was light enough {{to enable them to}} see the rush of the black clouds overhead, the bursts of the driving spray and the tumultuous heavings of the wild sea, it was inconceivably worse when the {{darkness}} settled down so thick that they could <b>barely</b> <b>see</b> each other's faces, and the steering had to be done more by feeling, as it were, than sight. Gaff took the helm during the greater part of the night, and the other two baled incessantly; but the gale increased so much that the water at last came in faster than it could be thrown out, and they expected to be swamped every instant.|$|E
60|$|At this Charley cast off, and Yellow Handkerchief sent {{one of his}} men {{forward to}} haul in the line. In the {{gathering}} darkness I {{could just make out}} the mouth of San Rafael Creek, {{and by the time we}} entered it I could <b>barely</b> <b>see</b> its banks. The Reindeer was fully five minutes astern, and we continued to leave her astern as we beat up the narrow, winding channel. With Charley behind us, it seemed I had little to fear from my five prisoners; but the darkness prevented my keeping a sharp eye on them, so I transferred my revolver from my trousers pocket to the side pocket of my coat, where I could more quickly put my hand on it.|$|E
60|$|Daylight {{found them}} far below Tagish Post. At nine o 'clock Sunday morning {{they could hear}} the Flora {{whistling}} her departure. And when, at ten o'clock, they dragged themselves in to the Post, they could just <b>barely</b> <b>see</b> the Flora's smoke far to the southward. It was a pair of worn-out tatterdemalions that Captain Jones of the Mounted Police welcomed and fed, and he afterward averred that they possessed two of the most tremendous appetites he had ever observed. They lay down and slept in their wet rags by the stove. At the end of two hours Churchill got up, carried Bondell's grip, which he had used for a pillow, down to the canoe, kicked Antonsen awake, and started in pursuit of the Flora.|$|E
