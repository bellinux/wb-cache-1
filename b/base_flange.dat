Decorative bell jars were made of thin glass, with more care being taken regarding their optical clarity, {{and they did not}} have a thickened <b>base</b> <b>flange.</b> For this reason, they are not suitable for vacuum use and would usually fail if pumped down.|$|E
30|$|To {{accommodate}} {{extremely high}} temperatures and seldom corrosive and hostile reservoir fluids, the wellhead assembly {{has to be}} diligently selected. The choice should be a compromise between wellhead quality, cost, and safety requirements. All wellhead implemented into geothermal wells have to follow API and ASME regulations. The wellheads used for both IDDP projects were ANSI class 1500 master valves with ANSI class 2500 flanges, whereas the wellhead employed for the recent Venelle- 2 project was API class 10, 000 rating (Bertani et al. 2018; Friðleifsson and Elders 2017; Friðleifsson et al. 2017). In the Venelle- 2 well, the <b>base</b> <b>flange</b> was realized with high corrosion resistance material. In both mentioned projects, steel cladding was realized on {{some parts of the}} surface valves and spools potentially exposed to aggressive reservoir fluids.|$|E
40|$|The authors propose an {{engineering}} solution for a wheel pair with a counter-flange that satisfies the existing standards of {{vertical and horizontal}} dynamics and the movement stability index. An improved profile of a rail wheel with a counter-flange is developed. It provides additional contact in the horizontal plane in the situation of transverse vibrations of the wheel pair against the rail track, adds to carriage stability and increases the wheel’s resistance to derailment when passing a curved part of the tracks or when rails deflect due to force interaction. The wheel pair profile is stabilized with an additional running track and counter-flange that prevents derailment when <b>base</b> <b>flange</b> of the wheel rolls onto the working surface of the rail or {{when there is a}} way spacer due to rail spring deformation. The proposed design of the wheel pair is covered by an Ukrainian utility model patent. ...|$|E

The work is focused on the theoretical background of the square tubes, circular tubes and inverbucktube performance under impact with the purpose of design of a novel optimized structure. The main system under consideration is based on the patent US 2008 / 0185851 A 1 and includes a <b>base</b> <b>flange</b> with elongated crush boxes and back straps for stabilization of the crush boxes with the purpose of improvement of the energy-absorbing functionality. The modelling of this system is carried out applying both a theoretical approach and finite element analysis concentrating on the energy absorbing abilities of the crumple zones. The optimization process is validated under dynamic and quasi-static loading conditions whilst considering various modes of deformation and stress distribution along the tubular components. Energy absorbing behaviour of the crush-cans is studied concentrating on their geometrical properties and their diamond or concertina modes of deformation. Moreover, structures made of different materials, steel, aluminium and polymer composites are considered for the material effect analysis and optimization through their combination. Optimization of the crush-can behaviour is done within the limits of the frontal impact scenario with the purpose of improvement of the structural performance in the Euro NCAP tests...|$|E

40|$|Recent low damage {{studies have}} been made on beam-to-column joints and braces. However, if there is {{significant}} yielding damage at the column bases, even with no upper structure damage, then the whole structure may need replacement. Therefore, {{there is a need}} to develop low damage base connections. This paper presents experimental tests of columns connected to base plate by weak axis aligned asymmetric friction connection (WAFC base) to evaluate if it performs as a low damage connection. Cyclic tests are conducted in-plane about the strong axis, and out-of-plane with and without applied axial force to drift ratios as high as 4 %. Observations from the experimental tests demonstrate that this type of base connection can tolerate high levels of drift without any significant damage at the <b>base.</b> Some <b>flange</b> compressive yielding occurs especially when the column was subjected to axial force. Generally, no major damage happened which interrupt the performance of the column and the base connection, and it can be categorized as a low-damage connection. Also, the presented analytical model for estimation of WAFC performance provides a reasonable estimation of the experimental results...|$|R

The data indicated that the problem was due to the operating speed being near the pump-motor system mechanical natural frequency, which resulted in excessive vibration levels on the motors and pump impellers. The mechanical natural frequency was very sensitive to the effective stiffness of the connections between the concrete, baseplates, pump <b>base</b> and motor <b>flange.</b> Tests were conducted to evaluate {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} lowering the natural frequency below the running speed and raising the natural frequency above the running speed.

40|$|This {{paper is}} about the laser {{measurements}} {{as part of the}} research on the distribution of a certain amount of steel over the flanges and the web of an I-shaped plate girder to achieve the maximum bending moment resistance [1]. In many steel structures standard hot-rolled sections are used. These sections are divided into specific types in Europe and similar profiles in the USA. The range of hot-rolled sections is limited and therefore fabricated plate girders are used. Double symmetric I-shaped plate girders are built up with steel plates for the top and bottom flange and the web, welded together to a cross-section. Using this type of plate girders, a high degree of optimisation of material use is possible by using different plate thicknesses and widths for the flanges and thickness and height for the web. In the thesis the main topic for optimisation is the bending moment resistance of a plate girder. The maximum bending moment resistance appears for plate girders with a lot of material in the flanges and with a large web height. The web thickness has to be as small as possible and so the web slenderness has to be as large as possible. The limitation of the web slenderness is according to the Eurocode and the American standard <b>based</b> on <b>flange</b> induced buckling. The web of cross-section class 4 buckles and this buckling is during experiments measured by lasers. This paper gives an overview {{of the results of the}} laser measurements. Based on these measurements, it is concluded that flange induce buckling is not a limitation for the web slenderness. High web slenderness can be applied and the bending moment resistance increases enormously and the stiffness increases even more. Because of this, the use of HSS becomes of high interest.

40|$|An {{appropriate}} flange tightening {{methods for}} small bore and low rating piping flange joints are clarified {{to improve the}} sealing performance of the bolted flange joints and the workability of flange tightening work. It is said that lubricant on the screw of the bolts and the nut-seating surface can minimize the variability of axial force acting on flange bolts, while this process might {{make it harder to}} tight the bolts uniformly especially for small bore low rating flanges. So, in this paper the appropriate condition to apply lubricant is clarified by a series of bolt tightening tests and sealing tests results. On the other hand, for the bolted flanges applying spiral wound gaskets, measuring the gasket compress dimensions help us to prevent uneven tightening balance and to perform the appropriate tightening work. Appropriate gasket compress dimensions are also clarified to ensure the sealing performance for the <b>flanges</b> <b>based</b> on the sealing tests results. Based on these test results, recommended flange-tightening methods have been summarized as an instruction and tightening work procedure to improve the sealing performance of the bolted flanges and the workability of flange tightening work...|$|R
40|$|Distortional {{buckling}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important buckling modes of the steel-concrete composite girder under negative moment. In this study, the equivalent lateral and torsional restraints of the bottom flange of a steel-concrete composite girder under negative moments due to variable axial forces are thoroughly investigated. The results show that there is a coupling effect between the applied forces and the lateral and torsional restraint of the bottom <b>flange.</b> <b>Based</b> on the calculation formula of lateral and torsional restraints, the critical buckling stress of I-steel-concrete composite girders and steel-concrete composite box girders under variable axial force is obtained. The critical bending moment of the steel-concrete composite girders can be further calculated. Compared to the traditional calculation methods of elastic foundation beam, the paper introduces an improved method, which considers coupling effect of the external loads and the foundation spring constraints of the bottom flange. Fifteen examples of the steel-concrete composite girders in different conditions are calculated. The calculation results show a good match between the hand calculation and the ANSYS finite element method, which validated that the analytic calculation method proposed in this paper is practical...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} paper is a {{preliminary}} assessment and critical discussion of full-scale experimental test results recently obtained for hybrid steel-glass beams composed of a laminated glass web and steel <b>flanges,</b> <b>based</b> on the analytical Möhler method. As known, the structural response of this typology of hybrid solutions markedly depends on the stiffness and resistance of all its components, and specifically the connection, which act as a flexible shear bonding layer between the glass web and the steel flanges. Therefore, the appropriate mechanical calibration of the component materials is mandatory for accurate calculations. In order to fully characterize the used adhesive, push-out shear tests and simple shear tests were performed on small specimens. The results obtained from these small specimens are then implemented as main input mechanical parameters for the analytical model, so that this latter {{could be applied to}} the full-scale tests in view of comparative analyses. As shown, due to accurate estimation of the main mechanical properties of the adhesive layers, the presented analytical method provides rather accurate results for the examined full-scale hybrid beams, hence suggesting its application for practical calculations and pre-design considerations...|$|R
40|$|Automating {{the process}} of {{automotive}} weather strip assembly has been a challenge to production engineers for years. In fact, a recent publication concluded that this process is too difficult to automate. At the IPA a robot tool for flexible automation of the weather strip assembly process has been developed. In close cooperation with Opel AG, weather strip supplier Mesnel S. A. in France, assembly system manufacturers Kuka, and Thyssen Nothelfer, a prototype assembly cell {{has been set up}} at IPA. The assembly system consists of a pick-up station supplying the weather strip seals, a sophisticated insertion tool, and an industrial robot (Fanuc S- 420 F). The basic function of the robot tool is very similar to the manual operation. The tool combines gripping, guiding and hammering functions. It uses open guides with pneumatic fingers to pickup and guide the seal, and a pneumatic hammer to drive the seal onto the <b>flange.</b> <b>Based</b> on a thorough analysis of significant process parameters, the cycle time of the seal assembly could be halved compared with manual operation. Extensive tests have proven a process reliability of close to 99 %. Integration of a four robot weather strip assembly system into the final assembly line at Opel's plant in Rüsselsheim is in progress...|$|R
40|$|Cold-formed steel {{structural}} members are used extensively in building construction, {{with a common}} application being wind load bearing steel studs. The studs frame into horizontal steel track members {{at the top and}} bottom of the wall assembly, with the stud-to-track connection typically being made with self-drilling screws or welds. The wall studs are designed to carry lateral loads only and must be checked for web crippling at the end reactions. While a design expression currently exists for the single stud-to-track connection, there is no similar design expression for multiple jamb stud members. An experimental investigation was carried out, consisting of 94 jamb stud assembly tests subjected to end-one-flange loading. The stud-to-track connections consisted of single C-section studs located at the end of a track simulating a door opening, and a built-up jamb made up of two studs simulating framing at either a window or door opening. The members were attached to the track with self-drilling screws. The research objective was to determine the failure modes and develop a design expression for these structural assemblies. The scope of the experimental investigation covered the following range of parameters: i) 	Stud and track depths of 92 mm and 152 mm; ii) 	Stud and track thickness (0. 84 mm, 1. 12 mm, 1. 52 mm and 1. 91 mm); iii) 	Configuration of jamb studs (back-to-back, toe-to-toe and single); iv) 	Location of jamb studs in the track (interior and end); v) 	Screw size (# 8, # 10 and # 12); vi) 	Screw location (both flanges and single <b>flange).</b> <b>Based</b> on the findings of this investigation, design expressions are proposed to predict the capacity of this connection for two limit states: web crippling of the jamb stud; and, punch-through of the track. The web crippling design expression was taken from the North American Specification for the Design of Cold-Formed Steel Structural Members [AISI 2007 a; CSA 2007] with new coefficients developed from the test data of the jamb stud-to-track assemblies. A new design expression is also proposed for the track punch-through failure mode, which differs from the approach currently used in the North American Standard for Cold-Formed Steel Framing – Wall Stud Design [AISI 2007 b]. A proposal is also recommended to revise the wording in the North American Standard for Cold-Formed Steel Framing – Wall Stud Design [AISI 2007 b] to include provisions for the design of jamb studs based on the results of this research...|$|R
