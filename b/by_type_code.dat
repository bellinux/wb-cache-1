40|$|Abstract — Precise range {{measurement}} by time-of-flight sonar {{is important for}} underwater positioning, oceanography (tomography) and marine geology (geodesy). This paper reports on the design spread-spectrum codes for {{range measurement}} {{in a variety of}} important underwater environments. Direct sequence spreadspectrum (DSSS) signal processing has many advantages over continuous wave techniques for time-of-flight range estimation: improved precision, extended effective range, increased robustness to ambient or jamming noise, increased update rate and simultaneous multi-user through multi-access channel signaling. Design of appropriate DSSS codes requires matching the code parameter to the acoustic operating environment to maximize system performance. We consider four canonical ocean environments: a laboratory test-tank, the littoral zone, the short range deep water horizontal channel and vehicle-to-vehicle communication. The characteristics of these acoustic channel models directly influence the code design to maximize range estimate performance. We parameterize the design choices for DSSS <b>codes</b> <b>by</b> <b>code</b> <b>type,</b> <b>code</b> length, carrier frequency, and chip rate. The paper concludes with experimental results for spreadspectrum range estimation in a laboratory test tank and on an operation ROV in deep water. I...|$|R

Drift {{is very much like}} its predecessor, featuring seven new courses to race on, new cars to drive with, and a new soundtrack. Like its predecessor, it features customizable add-ons to the player's car, like N2O (nitrous oxide), spoilers (for speed), decals, tires (for traction), and engines (for acceleration), and players use the money they've earned from races. Unlike the first game and its spinoff, it has a new status system; the players can view their car and upgrades. New cars include the Ford GT, 2005 Ford Mustang, Dodge Viper, Dodge Challenger, Saleen S7, Mazda RX-8, Mazda RX-7, Pontiac Solstice, 2009 Chevrolet Camaro and 1967 Ford Mustang. Nissan Skyline GT-R and Nissan 350Z were the only cars kept for the game. All other cars from its predecessor were taken out.

The platform collapsed and fell about 30 metres killing 14 young people and injuring others.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Ready-to-eat meals sold by food outlets {{that are}} {{accessible}} {{to the general public}} are an important target for public health intervention. We conducted a systematic review {{to assess the impact of}} such interventions. METHODS: Studies of any design and duration that included any consumer-level or food-outlet-level before-and-after data were included. RESULTS: Thirty studies describing 34 interventions were categorized <b>by</b> <b>type</b> and <b>coded</b> against the Nuffield intervention ladder: restrict choice[*]=[*]trans fat law (n[*]=[*] 1), changing pre-packed children's meal content (n[*]=[*] 1) and food outlet award schemes (n[*]=[*] 2); guide choice[*]=[*]price increases for unhealthier choices (n[*]=[*] 1), incentive (contingent reward) (n[*]=[*] 1) and price decreases for healthier choices (n[*]=[*] 2); enable choice[*]=[*]signposting (highlighting healthier/unhealthier options) (n[*]=[*] 10) and telemarketing (offering support for the provision of healthier options to businesses via telephone) (n[*]=[*] 2); and provide information[*]=[*]calorie labelling law (n[*]=[*] 12), voluntary nutrient labelling (n[*]=[*] 1) and personalized receipts (n[*]=[*] 1). Most interventions were aimed at adults in US fast food chains and assessed customer-level outcomes. More 'intrusive' interventions that restricted or guided choice generally showed a positive impact on food-outlet-level and customer-level outcomes. However, interventions that simply provided information or enabled choice had a negligible impact. CONCLUSION: Interventions to promote healthier ready-to-eat meals sold by food outlets should restrict choice or guide choice through incentives/disincentives.

50|$|The {{practice}} {{started in}} 1948 included letter indicating the vehicle type and model series; letters L, and gradually replaced by B, were used with bus chassis, although sometimes these applications were fitted with lorry cabins and superstructures. L-model buses {{can be distinguished}} by two-digit model series codes; later L made a return to Sisu model names in lorries, but with three-digit model numbers. Since 1970 the engine configuration of bus chassis was indicated with a second letter: BE meant front engined, BK middle engined and BT rear engined chassis. Conventional cabin lorries were K, U, UM, UP, L, LP, LM, LV and R. Lorries with forward control cabin were KB, M, MS, A, AH, AS, MA, MI and MK. Terminal tractor and mobile crane chassis models started with letter T. The model numbers were not consecutively running; many numbers were jumped over, {{as some of the}} numbers were used for configurations which only existed on paper.
