500|$|Computer Gaming Worlds Allen Greenberg in 1992 {{described}} it as [...] "an ambitious project" [...] but [...] "not without its share of problems." [...] He praised the game's [...] "enjoyable story and well-crafted puzzles", but disliked its [...] "robotic" [...] controls and [...] "confusing" [...] perspectives, and stated that [...] "far more impressive sounds and pictures have been produced for other dungeon games". He summarized the game as [...] "an enjoyable challenge with a unique game-playing engine to back it up." [...] Scorpia was also positive, stating that despite flaws [...] "Ultima Underworld is an impressive first product. The meticulous construction of a real-world dungeon environment is outstanding. [...] may be a dungeon trek, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> the dungeon trek of the future". In 1993 she praised the [...] "superb graphics" [...] of [...] "a definite must for game players". [...] The magazine later awarded the game [...] "Role-Playing Game of the Year". Computer Shopper enjoyed its storyline and characters, and believed that the game [...] "makes {{you feel as if}} you've entered a virtual reality". Despite describing its interface as [...] "not truly intuitive", the reviewer finished by calling the game [...] "addictive" [...] and [...] "a fine value". The Chicago Tribune awarded it Best Game of the Year, and called it [...] "an amazing triumph of the imagination" [...] and [...] "the creme de la creme of dungeon epics".|$|E

2500|$|Furthermore, {{there also}} exists in Gujarati a plural marker -ઓ (o). Unlike the English plural [...] {{it is not}} mandatory, and may be left unexpressed if {{plurality}} is already expressed in some other way: by explicit numbering, agreement, or the above declensional system (as {{is the case with}} nominative marked masculines and neuters). And yet despite the declensional system, ઓ (o) often gets tacked onto nominative marked masculine and neuter plurals anyway. This redundancy is called the double plural. Historically, the origin of this suffix is murky, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> morphological rather than lexical. It is new (18th century) and it is not attested in Old Gujarati, Middle Gujarati, and Old Western Rajasthani literature. It may simply be the case that it spread from an unrepresented dialect.|$|E

2500|$|The manuscripts {{give the}} title of the work as Vita Cypriani ("The Life of Cyprian"), while Jerome (see above) {{referred}} to it as Vita et passio Cypriani ("Life and martyrdom of Cyprian"). Jerome's reference may not be intended as a title; <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> the case that the book is clearly divided into two parts, one concerned with Cyprian's life, one with the events leading up to his martyrdom. [...] In the preface to the work, Pontius expresses regret there were detailed accounts of the martyrdoms of lay Christians, but none of a bishop like Cyprian who had so much worth narrating even without the martyrdom (1, 2). Chapters 3 to 10 relate Cyprian's activities from the time of his conversion, while chapters 11-19 describe proceedings before two different proconsuls, their judgements and Cyprian's final martyrdom.|$|E
2500|$|... "The real {{difficulty}} of the stunt lay not in the leap itself, since she had practiced this with the train stationary and it clearly presented no difficulties, but in the timing. What such stunts require is an inbuilt awareness {{of the speed of}} the moving object. During the course of a leap where a moving object is concerned, the spatial relationship between take-off point and landing point changes. It is quite possible to imagine a leap from a static take-off point on to the roof of a moving train in which the stuntman aims to land halfway along a carriage roof yet in fact-because of the speed of the train-lands in the gap between two carriages. It seems that in such a leap the safest place to aim at is the gap itself At least in that way one can guarantee to miss it. Helen Gibson had this sensitivity to spatial relationships between objects in motion, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> not a gift shared by all stuntmen."
