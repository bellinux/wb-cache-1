5|$|In {{uncomplicated}} cases, UTIs {{are treated}} with a short course of antibiotics such as nitrofurantoin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Resistance {{to many of the}} antibiotics used to treat this condition is increasing. In complicated cases, a longer course or intravenous antibiotics may <b>be</b> <b>needed.</b> If symptoms do not improve in two or three days, further diagnostic testing may <b>be</b> <b>needed.</b> Phenazopyridine may help with symptoms. In those who have bacteria or white blood cells in their urine but have no symptoms, antibiotics are generally not needed, although during pregnancy is an exception. In those with frequent infections, a short course of antibiotics may be taken as soon as symptoms begin or long-term antibiotics may be used as a preventative measure.|$|E
5|$|Order Paleonemertea. Comprises 100 marine species. Their body wall has outer {{circular}} {{and inner}} length-wise muscles. In addition, Carinoma tremaphoros has circular and inner length-wise {{muscles in the}} epidermis; the extra muscle layers seem to <b>be</b> <b>needed</b> for burrowing by peristalsis.|$|E

5|$|A £40 million {{contract}} to build 27 Urbos 3 trams, sufficient for phase 1a and (unbuilt) 1b lines, {{was awarded to}} CAF.

5|$|Although {{the airport}} is capable of {{handling}} Boeing 767 aircraft, for large numbers of these aircraft, significant investment would <b>be</b> <b>needed.</b> Consequently, the largest aircraft regularly flying to the airport are Boeing 757. The main problem at {{the airport is}} the lack of ramp space, with just two parking positions for large aircraft. As a result, El Al operates regular shuttle flights to Ben Gurion International Airport carrying passengers from around the world on 757s and 737s.|$|E
5|$|An August 1944 study {{anticipated}} that the ships would carry four early warning radars, including height-finders, four surface search radars and eight gunnery/fire-control radars. Historian David Hobbs wrote that they would mount Type 960 early warning, Type 982 intercept, Type 983 height-finding and Type 293M target indication radars. In addition a number of gunnery radars would also <b>be</b> <b>needed.</b>|$|E

5|$|Compartment {{syndrome}} is a clinical diagnosis, i.e., no diagnostic test conclusively proves its presence or absence, but direct {{measurement of the}} pressure in a fascial compartment, {{and the difference between}} this pressure and the blood pressure, may be used to assess its severity. High pressures in the compartment and a small difference between compartment pressure and blood pressure indicate that the blood supply is likely to be insufficient, and that surgical intervention may <b>be</b> <b>needed.</b>|$|E
5|$|Eruptions {{would likely}} {{continue}} {{for a period}} of time, followed by years of decreasing secondary activity. The solidifying lava would occasionally collapse portions of the volcano to create pyroclastic flows. Rubble on the flanks of the volcano and in valleys would occasionally be released to form debris flows. Major construction would <b>be</b> <b>needed</b> to repair the community of Squamish and Highway 99.|$|E

5|$|In 1952, Alan Turing (1912–1954), {{better known}} {{for his work on}} {{computing}} and codebreaking, wrote The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis, an analysis of the mechanisms that would <b>be</b> <b>needed</b> to create patterns in living organisms, in the process called morphogenesis. He predicted oscillating chemical reactions, in particular the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction. These activator-inhibitor mechanisms can, Turing suggested, generate patterns of stripes and spots in animals, and contribute to the spiral patterns seen in plant phyllotaxis.|$|E
5|$|In February 1965 the Army asked Bell to {{consider}} different deployment concepts under the Nth Country study. This examined {{what sort of}} system would <b>be</b> <b>needed</b> to provide protection against an unsophisticated attack with {{a limited number of}} warheads. Using Zeus EX, a few bases could provide coverage for the entire US. The system would be unable to deal with large numbers of warheads, but that was not a concern for a system that would only be tasked with beating off small attacks.|$|E
5|$|In June 2009, the National Trust {{announced}} plans to reclad the monument {{at a cost of}} £4 million. The painted fence was replaced by an open wire fence in 2010, aiding visibility, but still denying public access {{to the base of the}} monument. Survey work in 2010 showed the extent of cracks in the stonework. In 2013 it was announced that further funding would <b>be</b> <b>needed</b> for the restoration project.

During the previous year, Macdonald had met with potential railway financiers such as Hugh Allan and considerable financial discussion took place. Nevertheless, the greatest political problem Macdonald faced was the Washington treaty, which had not yet been debated in Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Internal {{cleaning}} of diving cylinders {{may be required}} to remove contaminants or to allow effective visual inspection. Cleaning methods should remove contaminants and corrosion products without undue removal of structural metal. Chemical cleaning using solvents, detergents and pickling agents may be used depending on the contaminant and cylinder material. Tumbling with abrasive media may <b>be</b> <b>needed</b> for heavy contamination, particularly of heavy corrosion products.|$|E
