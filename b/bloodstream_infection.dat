40|$|ObjectivesPostoperative <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infections</b> are a {{major source}} of {{morbidity}} and increased health care costs. In adults, mediastinitis {{has been described as a}} risk factor for <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infections.</b> The objectives of this retrospective cohort study were to determine the incidence and to identify risk factors for postoperative <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infections</b> among children after median sternotomy in an urban tertiary care children’s hospital. MethodsFor this study, 192 patients were randomly selected from among all patients undergoing median sternotomy between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 2003. ResultsNinety-eight (51 %) of the 192 eligible patients were male. The median patient age was 5. 4 months (interquartile range: 1 day– 41. 5 years). <b>Bloodstream</b> <b>infections</b> occurred in 12 (6. 3 %; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 3. 3 %– 10. 7 %) patients within the first 30 days after median sternotomy. <b>Bloodstream</b> <b>infections</b> developed a median of 11 days (range: 3 – 29 days) after median sternotomy. Gram-negative bacilli caused 6 (50 %) of the 12 <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infections.</b> Specific causes of <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infections</b> included Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 3), coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 3), Pseudomonas fluorescens-putida (n = 2), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 2), Serratia marcescens (n = 1), and Candida albicans (n = 1). Multivariable analysis revealed that the development of mediastinitis (odds ratio [OR], 28. 16; 95 % CI, 3. 37 – 235. 22) and the requirement for postoperative extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (OR, 12. 52; 95 % CI, 2. 99 – 52. 41) were associated with <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infections</b> after median sternotomy. ConclusionsPostoperative <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infections</b> occurred in 6. 3 % of children undergoing median sternotomy. Postoperative mediastinitis and the requirement for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation were risk factors for <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infections</b> after median sternotomy.

This {{case control study}} involved a total of 22 patients with confirmed <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infections</b> and 44 concurrent controls from an intensive care unit in Western Australia. We aimed to assess whether eosinopenia and C-reactive protein are useful markers of <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infections</b> in {{critically ill}} patients. The patients with <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infections</b> had a more severe disease and a longer length of intensive care unit (10. 7 vs 4. 0 days, P= 0. 001) and hospital stay (40. 9 vs 17. 9 days, P= 0. 015) than the controls. Univariate analyses showed that C-reactive protein (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0. 847, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 721 to 0. 973), eosinophil counts (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0. 849, 95 % CI 0. 738 to 0. 961) and fibrinogen concentrations (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0. 730, 95 % CI 0. 578 to 0. 882) were significant markers of <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infections.</b> C-reactive protein concentration was, however, the only significant predictor in the multivariate analysis (odds ratio 1. 21 per 10 mg/l increment, 95 % CI 1. 01 to 1. 39, P= 0. 007).

A total of 4 094 very low birth weight infants with microbiology confirmed primary <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infections</b> were included in the analysis. The crude case fatality risk was 5. 7 %. The Cox proportional hazard regression analysis with adjustment for available risk factors revealed that microbiology confirmed primary <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infections</b> caused by Klebsiella spp. (HR 3. 17 CI 95 1. 69 - 5. 95), Enterobacter spp. (HR 3. 42 CI 95 1. 86 - 6. 27), Escherichia coli (HR 3. 32 CI 95 1. 84 - 6. 00) and Serratia spp. (HR 3. 30 CI 95 1. 44 - 7. 57) were associated with significantly higher case fatality risk compared to Staphylococcus aureus. After adjusting, case fatality risk of Candida albicans causing microbiology confirmed primary <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infections</b> was not higher than that of S. aureus. In very low birth weight infants, <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infections</b> caused by gram negative pathogens have an increased case fatality risk compared to <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infections</b> caused by gram positive pathogens.

The incidence of nosocomial S. aureus <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infections</b> was 0. 11 per 1, 000 days of hospitalization. The prevalence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains, of which 13 % were nonmultiresistant MRSA (NORSA), was 33 %, and this percentage was stable over the 4 years. In contrast, the prevalence of S. aureus strains susceptible to methicillin but resistant to quinolones or susceptible to methicillin but multiresistant to antibiotics (EMSSA strains) increased from 4 % in 2000 to 23 % in 2003.

Results: Klebsiella spp. <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infections</b> were diagnosed in 49 of the 10, 258 patients hospitalized in our center between January 1, 2003 and December 31, 2007 (overall incidence, 4. 7 per 1, 000 admissions). Twenty-eight cases and 21 control subjects were included in the study. The mean age of patients was 23. 3 ± 34. 9 months (2 days- 18 years) and 59. 2 % were male. Malignancy (32. 7 %) was the most common underlying disease in the patients with Klebsiella spp. <b>bloodstream</b> <b>infections.</b> The prevalence of ESBL-producing isolates among Klebsiella spp. was found to be 57. 1 %.
