The human body generates about 100 W of metabolic heat that must be carried away to maintain a core body temperature near 37°C, which implies that sustained wet <b>bulb</b> <b>temperatures</b> above 35°C can result in lethal hyperthermia. Today, the summer temperature varies widely over the Earth's surface, but wet bulb temperature is more narrowly confined by the effect of humidity, with the most common value of approximately 26–27°C and the highest approximately of 31°C. A warming of 10–12°C would put most of today's world population in regions with a wetbulb temperature above 35°C. Given the 20°C warming that occurs with 4.8 times current CO2 levels, such a climate forcing would produce intolerable climatic conditions even if the true climate sensitivity is significantly less than the Russell sensitivity, or, if the Russell sensitivity is accurate, the CO2 forcing required to produce intolerable conditions for humans is less than this amount.|$|E

50|$|Assuming {{constant}} pressure, sigma heat {{is solely}} {{a function of}} the wet bulb temperature of the air. For this reason, humidity need not be taken into account unless dry-bulb temperature measurements are used. Like sigma heat, the wet bulb temperature is not directly affected by the temperature of any condensed water vapor (liquid water), and it varies only when there is a net energy change to the system. In contrast, the dry bulb temperature can vary even for processes where there is no such net energy change. This difference may be understood by examining evaporative cooling. During evaporative cooling, all energy lost from air molecules as sensible heat is gained as latent heat by water molecules evaporating into that air. With no net energy gained or lost from the now more humid air, sigma heat remains unchanged. In keeping with this, the wet bulb temperature also remains unchanged, as its reading already represented the maximum possible amount of evaporative cooling. The dry bulb temperature however is in conflict with the sigma heat since it decreases during such evaporative cooling. This is why measurements of sigma heat which use dry <b>bulb</b> <b>temperatures</b> must also take into account the humidity of the air.|$|E

30|$|A {{method of}} {{converting}} hot air into a cool breeze using {{the process of}} evaporating water is the evaporative cooling. By evaporating water, energy is taken from {{the air and the}} temperature is reduced. The natural process of water evaporation along with an air-moving system is utilised by evaporative coolers to generate effective cooling. Two temperatures are vital when dealing with evaporative cooling systems such as dry <b>bulb</b> <b>temperature</b> and wet <b>bulb</b> <b>temperature.</b> If the dry <b>bulb</b> <b>temperature</b> and wet <b>bulb</b> <b>temperature</b> are 35 °C and 15 °C, respectively, the maximum drop in temperature due to evaporative cooling would theoretically be 20 °C. The cooling effect due to perspiration on the human skin is an example of evaporative cooling. In hot and humid climates, the cooling effect is less because of the high moisture content of the surrounding air. The four major factors that affect the rate of evaporation are relative humidity, air temperatures, air movement and surface area. There are two general methods of evaporative cooling: direct and indirect.|$|R

Of the climatic elements which affect the human body, the most important one is wet <b>bulb</b> <b>temperature.</b> The body 2 ̆ 7 s response to wet <b>bulb</b> <b>temperature</b> is affected by the rates of conduction, convection, and radiation heat away from the body, and by cooling due to evaporation at the skin surface and in the respiratory tracts.
