5|$|Although {{the plans}} were officially shelved, locals {{continued}} {{to work with the}} idea of a road connecting Averøy with the mainland. The toll company Atlanterhavsveien AS was established in 1970. Arne Rettedal, who was Minister of Local Government and Regional Development in the early 1980s, proposed that job creation funds could be allocated to road projects. The proposal was approved in 1983, after it had <b>been</b> <b>supported</b> <b>by</b> the municipalities of Averøy, Eide and Fræna. Construction started as a municipal road project on 1 August 1983, but progressed slowly. From 1 July 1986, the Norwegian Public Roads Administration took over the project, speeding up construction and allowing it to open on 7 July 1989. During construction, the area was hit by 12 hurricanes. The opening of the road allowed the Tøvik–Ørjavik Ferry to be terminated.|$|E
5|$|Attalea {{is a large}} genus of palms {{native to}} Mexico, the Caribbean, Central and South America. This pinnately leaved, non-spiny genus {{includes}} both small palms lacking an aboveground stem and large trees. The genus has a complicated taxonomic history, and has often been split into four or five genera based on differences in the male flowers. Since the genera can only be distinguished {{on the basis of}} their male flowers, the existence of intermediate flower types and the existence of hybrids between different genera has been used as an argument for keeping them all in the same genus. This has <b>been</b> <b>supported</b> <b>by</b> a recent molecular phylogeny.|$|E
5|$|Beirut {{was first}} {{mentioned}} in {{writing as a}} major {{center for the study}} of law in the 239 works of Gregory Thaumaturgus, the bishop of Neo-Caesarea. Other early written sources do not mention when the law school was established, and the date is much debated among modern historians and scholars. Edward Gibbon suggested its founding may have been directed by locally born Emperor Alexander Severus, who reigned during A.D. 222–235; this hypothesis had <b>been</b> <b>supported</b> <b>by</b> Gilles Ménage, a late 17th-century French scholar. Italian jurist Scipione Gentili, however, attributed the school's foundation to Augustus, while 19th-century German theologian Karl Hase advocated its establishment shortly after the victory at Actium (31BC). Adolf Friedrich Rudorff dated it to the reign of Hadrian, while Franz Peter Bremer suggested that it opened around 200, based on Thaumaturgus.|$|E

5|$|Eventually, {{tensions}} faded, but {{a bigger}} decision awaited Robert Breckinridge in 1828. He {{was chosen to}} sit on a committee that would draft Kentucky's response to the Nullification Crisis. Because much of South Carolina's reasoning for their actions was based on the logic of the Kentucky Resolutions, which had <b>been</b> <b>supported</b> <b>by</b> Senator John Breckinridge, Robert Breckinridge now had to determine whether he should support the words of his late father or refute them. In the end, his Unionist sympathies overrode his sense of loyalty to his father; he sided with the committee's majority in condemning South Carolina's actions.|$|E
5|$|From 1000 onwards, {{references}} to castles in texts such as charters increased greatly. Historians have interpreted this {{as evidence of}} a sudden {{increase in the number}} of castles in Europe around this time; this has <b>been</b> <b>supported</b> <b>by</b> archaeological investigation which has dated the construction of castle sites through the examination of ceramics. The increase in Italy began in the 950s, with numbers of castles increasing by a factor of three to five every 50years, whereas in other parts of Europe such as France and Spain the growth was slower. In 950 Provence was home to 12castles, by 1000 this figure had risen to 30, and by 1030 it was over 100. Although the increase was slower in Spain, the 1020s saw a particular growth in the number of castles in the region, particularly in contested border areas between Christian and Muslim.|$|E

A small landing stage is being proposed to enable access to the pools from river craft.|$|E
