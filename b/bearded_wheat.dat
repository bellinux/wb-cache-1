40|$|Graduation date: 1981 The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to evaluate the effects of site potential, season and plant part on percent crude protein, percent digestibility of dry matter and yield of cereal residues. Three cereal types, club wheat (Triticum aestivum) tall, <b>bearded</b> <b>wheat</b> (T. aestivum), and barley Hordeum vulgare) were examined. Stress conditions more than actual site potential produced higher crude protein levels. Stress was usually the result of low soil moisture, though an interaction of soil moisture conditions and fertilization were believed to also be important. When fertilizer treatments were held constant for both high and low potential sites, crude protein levels in all three cereals were higher on the low potential sites. Prior to fall rains, crude protein in the leaves of club wheat and barley on the low potential sites ranged as high as 8 and 9 percent. Club and barley leaves on the high potential sites had only 2. 2 and 3. 4 percent crude protein, respectively. When only the high potential site was fertilized, as in barley in 1978 and <b>bearded</b> <b>wheat</b> in 1977 and 1978, crude protein levels on the high potential site were equal to or greater than those on the low potential site. The effect of season on crude protein levels in leaves and culms was important only when a high initial protein content was observed. Crude protein levels exceeding 6 percent decreased rapidly with the onset of fall precipitation. Crude protein levels were consistently higher in leaves as compared to culms in all cereal types, when averaged across site potentials and sampling dates. Crude protein levels ranged from 1. 2 to 2. 1 percent in culms and 3. 0 to 4. 1 percent in leaves. Percent in vitro dry matter digestibility in leaves, culms and chaff was usually not affected by site potential or plant part. However, season consistently affected the digestibility of leaves and culms. In most cases digestibility decreased over time, with the greatest decrease occurring at the second sampling date. This indicated a rapid loss of soluble carbohydrates once the rains began. Stubble yield was, except in two instances, significantly affected by site potential. Leaf, culm and total (leaves + culms) production was greater on the high potential sites. Yields of standing stubble on high potential sites averaged 700 kg/ha more than on low potential sites. Leaf/culm ratios were consistently higher on the low potential sites. Though not actually sampled, leaf availability was noted to decrease dramatically over the season...|$|E
40|$|Two {{methods of}} crop {{improvement}} {{are open to}} the plant breeder. Pure-line selection, which might be mentioned first, deals with the natural variability in plant populations. Thru selection, isolation, and comparative yield tests superior individuals are located. Nothing, however, can be added which the plant does not already have. Here hybridization provides a new starting point. Increased variation, new combination of characters, and thus greater opportunities are provided for improvement. The present investigation has for its purpose a study of the latter phase of this subject. In certain parts of Utah the straw from dry-land wheat is used for feeding of cattle and horses. Turkey, the chief variety grown, is bearded in character. Some stockmen claim that the beards are not a disadvantage in feeding, but the majority of feeders favor straw free from this disagreeable feature. Heading and threshing outfits also make considerable complaint when handling Turkey. In fact, certain outfits have experienced difficulty in keeping men on Turkey jobs if any other work could be obtained. Yet, in spite of this fact, Turkey continues to be the predominating variety because of better quality which is reflected in the prices, and in addition higher-yielding power. So in contemplation of this situation it was deemed advisable to attempt crossing Turkey and others of the Crimean group with other winter wheats somewhat lower in quality and yielding power, yet having the desirable character of beardlessness. The <b>bearded</b> <b>wheats,</b> Turkey, Armavir, Beloglina, and Kharkov, were selected for the qualities of high yield, good milling, and drought resistance. Kofod and Gold Coin were chosen for the character of beardlessness. The aim in making the crosses was to determine the possibility of combining the desirable characters of these wheat types in single individual plants. While detailed genetic data were taken of the F 1 and F 2 plants, this work was only incidental to the main reason given for the crossing, except as it was of value in predicting and interpreting results...|$|R

40|$|Bowman, Jacob L. White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) are overabundant in {{many areas}} of the country and {{increased}} deer numbers have caused damage to agronomic crops to increase. Winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) is a commonly grown crop and food source for white-tailed deer on the Delmarva Peninsula. The effect of deer browsing on corn and soybean yields has been documented, but research is lacking on the effect of deer browsing on wheat yield. In 2007 - 2009, I investigated the effect of browse timing and wheat type (bearded and unbearded) on wheat yield in Delaware. I placed 1680, 4. 4 m 2 plots in the middle of 10 m distance classes starting from the forested edge out to 60 m. In 2007, I systematically assigned 1 of 2 treatments (i. e., no protection or protected at planting) to the plots. In 2008 - 2009, I added a third treatment: protected prior to heading. After head emergence, I conducted weekly browse surveys on all unprotected plots to determine browse rates. I collected weekly biomass samples to estimate the amount of wheat biomass removed by deer. I harvested a 1 m 2 area in the middle of each plot to determine the deer impact on yield. I also tested if browsing affects the test weight of wheat during 2008 and 2009. Browsing increased in intensity as head development progressed with most browsing occurring on the unbearded wheat. I found no interaction between wheat and treatment (P > 0. 10) during the study. Unprotected plots yielded 195 kg/ha more wheat then protected plots in 2007 (P = 0. 08). I found no difference between treatments for 2008 and 2009 (P = 0. 38). <b>Bearded</b> <b>wheat</b> yielded 379 kg/ha higher in 2007 and 399 kg/ha higher in 2008 and 2009 than unbearded wheat (P < 0. 001). I found no difference in test weight among treatments (P = 0. 42) or between wheat types (P = 0. 997) in 2008 and 2009. My browse surveys demonstrated avoidance of bearding but the overall browsing was not intense enough to reduce yield. My results differed from past research documenting a reduction in yield but the lower deer density (~ 15 deer/km 2) on my study area was the likely cause of the difference.

40|$|Vlachos, Dionisios G. Computational fluid {{dynamics}} (CFD) simulations {{are used to}} simulate stacks of different sizes {{in order to understand}} nonlinear effects which arise in scale-out of microchemical systems. As an example process, syngas production from methane is studied using a multifunctional, parallel plate reactor with alternating combustion and steam reforming channels. A scale-out strategy is proposed which creates larger stacks from a base-unit. Stacks are evaluated in terms of efficiency, maximum wall temperature and stability under external heat loss for both high and moderate wall thermal conductivities. We find that smaller stacks are unstable under laboratory heat loss conditions. Stacks with high wall thermal conductivities are more stable than those with moderate wall conductivities under our conditions. At high heat loss coefficients, significant transverse thermal gradients exist between interior and edge channels of the stacks that result in significant loss of efficiency. A transition from all ignited to some ignited and extinguished and finally to all extinguished channels is discovered as criticality is approached in moderate size stacks. Microsystems provide one to three orders of magnitude larger volumetric and gravimetric throughputs than conventional technology irrespective of model uncertainty, and such intensification is central to portable and distributed processing. They exhibit energy efficiency that is a strong function of size and heat loss but can outperform conventional processing under many conditions. However, they result in higher cost per unit syngas volume unless system optimization is carried out. Stability improvement techniques such as different reactor sizes, reducing wall thermal conductivity, increasing the Pt catalyst loading and burning hydrogen rather than methane in the outermost channels are investigated. To simulate fuel-lean hydrogen combustion in a computationally efficient manner, a single step rate expression for hydrogen combustion on Pt is derived from a previously published microkinetic model. The most effective means for improving stability is found to be combusting hydrogen or increasing the Pt catalyst loading in the outermost combustion channel.
