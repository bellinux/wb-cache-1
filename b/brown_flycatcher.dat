50|$|The African broadbill is a boldly streaked, largely <b>brown,</b> stocky <b>flycatcher</b> like bird. They have dark crowns {{which are}} {{black in the}} males and grey in the females of the eastern {{subspecies}} and blackish in both sexes of the subspecies S.c. meinertzhageni. The upperparts are mainly olive-brown with black streaks, the bases of the feathers on the lower back and rump are white and are hidden when the bird is at rest. The underparts are buff or creamy-white with black streaks on the flanks and the breast. There is subspecific variation with S.c. meinertzhageni and S.c. suahelicus being whiter below with thicker streaks than, for example S.c. mefianus. It measures 12-14 cm in length and in South Africa males weighed 21-26.9g and females 17.4-27.5 g.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, parts of Tamarack Swamp, {{such as the}} {{southern}} part {{have been affected by}} logging and development. Logging was done as late as the 1940s, when Hicks Jennings cut down the only remaining virgin spruce in Tamarack Swamp. By 1947, the tamarack and black spruce trees in the wetland were significantly less healthy than they had been around 1900. The bird species olive-sided <b>flycatcher,</b> <b>brown</b> creeper, and winter wren have become extinct in the wetland since 1925. A report from the late 1940s mentioned that pitcher plants in the wetland.|$|R
50|$|The dusky long-tailed cuckoo {{is often}} found in the {{undergrowth}} or mid-canopy. It eats caterpillars, ants, beetles, spiders, snails and seeds and joins mixed-species foraging flocks. Pairs often call from treetops. Its calls include hu hee wheeu {{and a series of}} notes that accelerates and then slows and descends. The calls in Lower Guinea are faster than in Upper Guinea. This cuckoo is a brood parasite. The blue-headed crested <b>flycatcher,</b> <b>brown</b> illadopsis and possibly the forest robin have been observed as hosts. Its breeding may be associated with the wet season.|$|R

50|$|The Asian <b>brown</b> <b>flycatcher</b> (Muscicapa dauurica) {{is a small}} {{passerine}} bird in the flycatcher family Muscicapidae. The word Muscicapa {{comes from}} the Latin musca, a fly and capere, to catch. The specific dauurica refers to Dauria, an area of south-eastern Siberia named after a local nomadic tribe.|$|E
50|$|The {{region has}} given {{its name to}} various animal species {{including}} Daurian hedgehog, and the following birds: Asian <b>brown</b> <b>flycatcher</b> (Muscicapa daurica), Daurian jackdaw, Daurian partridge, Daurian redstart, Daurian starling, Daurian shrike and the red-rumped swallow (Hirundo daurica). The Mongolian wild ass (Equus hemionus hemionus) is regionally extinct from the region.|$|E
50|$|It is 13 to 14 cm long. The upperparts are {{plain and}} dark grey-brown {{apart from a}} pale wingbar and pale edging to the tertial feathers. The breast and flanks have a {{variable}} amount of streaky dark grey-brown. This is unlike the similar Asian <b>brown</b> <b>flycatcher</b> which has rather plain pale underparts and the grey-streaked flycatcher which is white below with distinct grey streaks.|$|E
50|$|Dark-sided flycatchers have a pale submoustachial stripe {{and a dark}} {{malar stripe}} which {{outlines}} the white throat and half-collar. The centre of the lower breast and belly is white while the undertail-coverts are white with dark centres to the feathers. The bill is short and dark and the feet are black. The eye is large and has a whitish ring around it. The wings are long with a longer primary projection than the Asian <b>brown</b> <b>flycatcher.</b>|$|E
50|$|Many {{rare species}} of bird {{have been found}} on the island, and it is {{probably}} the best place in western Europe to see skulking Siberian passerines such as Pechora pipit, lanceolated warbler and Pallas's grasshopper warbler. In spring 2008 a calandra lark was identified in April, and in May a Caspian plover was observed, only the fourth such record for the UK. On 6 June a citril finch was found and identified by islander Tommy Hyndman, a first record for Britain. September was highlighted by <b>brown</b> <b>flycatcher,</b> red-flanked bluetail and Siberian thrush.|$|E
5000|$|On 3 October 2007 a first winter <b>brown</b> <b>flycatcher</b> was {{discovered}} at Flamborough Head, East Riding of Yorkshire which attracted hundreds of birdwatchers during its stay which lasted until dusk {{of the following}} day. [...] This looks set {{to become the first}} accepted record. A previous record, on Fair Isle, on 1-2 July 1992 [...] was regarded by the BOURC as not definitely of wild origin. [...] A bird had also been claimed on Holy Island, Northumberland on 9 September 1956, but the identification was not accepted with beyond doubt.|$|E
50|$|Avifauna of {{the reserve}} {{exhibits}} {{a high degree of}} variety and endemicity. Some of the noteworthy species include mountain hawk-eagle, Sri Lanka junglefowl, Sri Lanka wood pigeon, jungle nightjar, Sri Lanka blue magpie, yellow-eared bulbul, brown-capped babbler, orange-billed babbler, dull-blue flycatcher, Sri Lanka bush warbler, Sri Lanka whistling thrush, spot-winged thrush, common blackbird, and Sri Lanka white-eye. All five species of bird which are strictly endemic to this ecoregion are present in the reserve. Common birds are scarlet minivet, small minivet, black bulbul, Sri Lanka scimitar babbler, grey-headed canary-flycatcher, pied bushchat, and Sri Lanka scaly thrush. Indian pitta, Asian <b>brown</b> <b>flycatcher,</b> Kashmir flycatcher, Indian blue robin, pied thrush, black-throated munia, and large-billed leaf warbler are amongst the large number of migratory species.|$|E
50|$|The brown-breasted flycatcher is 13-14 cm {{in length}} and weighs between 10-14 g. The overall colour of the upperparts is olive brown. Some of the feather shafts are darker. The upper tail coverts are {{brighter}} rufous as are {{the edges of the}} flight feathers. The tail feathers have rufous on the outer webs. The lores are pale and the eye ring is conspicuous. The chin and throat are white while the breast and sides of the body are pale brown. The middle of the body to the vent is buffy white. Submoustachial stripes are faint but mark the boundary of the pale chin while the legs and lower mandible are pale flesh coloured. The most similar species is the Asian <b>brown</b> <b>flycatcher,</b> which has black rather than pale legs. It was named by Layard after Muttu, his servant who brought him the specimen.|$|E

50|$|When {{different}} kinds of birds have the same adaptations, such similarities are not necessaily indicative of any familial relationship between bird species. Rather, they {{are the result of}} convergent evolution. Consider, for example, the marked resemblance in body size, shape, and coloration between flycatchers of several families, though these species are not closely related: the Asian <b>brown</b> <b>flycatcher</b> (of the Muscicapidae or Old World flycatcher family), Acadian flycatcher (of the Tyrannidae or tyrant flycatcher family) of the New World, and slaty monarch (of the Monarchidae or monarch flycatcher family), endemic to Fiji. All three use flycatching to acquire some or all of their food. But these three families belong to separate branches of the evolutionary tree of songbirds, which diverged in two branching events some 60 and 90 million years ago and continued to evolve independently {{in different parts of the}} world. Likewise, the similarities of swifts and swallows once led naturalists to conclude they were related, but it is now established that they are unrelated, and that the same lifestyle has led to the same adaptations.|$|E
50|$|Literature on {{historical}} records of birdlife {{of the region}} is very scanty. Forsyth's (1889) casual remarks indicated that several species like black-headed yellow bulbul (Pycnonotus melanicterus), painted spurfowl (Galloperdix lunulata), lesser adjutant (Leptoptilos javanicus), and Indian golden-backed three-toed woodpecker (Dinopium javanense) which are now found only in small restricted areas were apparently quite common and widespread around late 19th century. The recent rediscovery of the forest spotted owlet (Heteroglaux blewitti), endemic to Central Indian Highlands after about 114 years (Rasmussen 1998), underscores the significance of more avifaunal studies in the region for conservation planning. The forests of central India are {{also one of the}} few known refuges for several globally threatened and restricted-range species like Malabar pied hornbill (Anthracoceros coronatus), spotted grey creeper (Salpornis spilonotus), white-bellied minivet (Pericrocotus erythropygius), Asian <b>brown</b> <b>flycatcher</b> (Muscicapa dauurica) and green munia (Amandava formosa) (Ali & Ripley, 1983). A recent survey on breeding birds of Central Indian Highlands by Wildlife Institute of India (Jayapal et al., 2005) has added several new breeding records and range-extensions like crested goshawk (Accipiter trivirgatus), Oriental scops owl (Otus sunia), spot-bellied eagle owl (Bubo nipalensis), drongo-cuckoo (Surniculus lugubris), ashy drongo (Dicrurus leucophaeus), and striated grassbird (Megalurus palustris).|$|E
