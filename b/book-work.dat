40|$|Recent {{exhibitions}} have redefined conceptualism as {{a global}} movement that emerged alongside locally situated experiences of national liberation movements, New Left social activism and countercultural world-making. This thesis proposes an art historical term, “conceptual nationalisms,” as {{a contribution to the}} historicization of conceptualism as the movement emerged in Canada and Québec. The term retrospectively describes <b>book-works</b> and magazines produced by an overlapping artistic and literary neo-avant-garde, which evince the symbolic value of print media forms during the post-Centennial period (1967 - 1974). As funding for the arts increased and converged with labour policy in this period, the relationship between state ideology and a conceptualist critique of the art object as a commodity became intrinsically intertwined. Many conceptual <b>book-works</b> and artists’ magazines were produced alongside publications issued by literary small presses, as such, this thesis also recognizes parallels taking place between the linguistic turn in conceptual art and literary movements such as concrete, visual and sound poetry that emphasize the materiality of the signifier in language. This thesis introduces three primary case studies: Roy Kenzie Kiyooka’s "Transcanada Letters" (Talonbooks, 1975); the Image Bank "International Image Exchange Directory" (Talonbooks, 1972), which parallels the publication of the first three issues of General Idea’s "File" magazine (1972 - 1989); and a utopian “linguistic space” produced {{in the early days of}} Véhicule Art gallery, with reference to several publications including the magazine, "Médiart" (1971 - 1973), "Quebec underground, 1962 - 1972 (Éditions Médiart, 1973), and Bill Vazan’s "Contacts" (Véhicule Press, 1973). I also refer to two foundational works: Joyce Wieland’s "True Patriot Love/Véritable amour patriotique" (National Gallery of Canada, 1971) and Michael Ondaatje’s long poem, "The Collected Works of Billy the Kid: Left-Handed Poems (House of Anansi, 1970). These case studies draw from a wide range of interdisciplinary thinkers including art historians, theorists of utopian thought and the creation of counterpublics, and scholars of literature and print culture, with particular reference to the national publics documented through the encyclopedic "History of the Book in Canada" project. Combining visual analysis, bibliographic and archival methods with research-creation, this thesis argues that works of conceptual nationalisms arise from countercultural social scenes where a politics of eros challenged fixed identity dispositions imposed through media, both domestic and imported. Invoking the affective state Herbert Marcuse described at the time as, “polymorphous perversity,” these case studies disidentify with a sense of nationhood based in shared language, blood or territory, relying instead upon the psychological drive of libido as a universalizing biological trait. The visual symbols underpinning national identity are simultaneously internalized and reinvested with an erotic ambiguity that manifests as Romantic irony and self-parody. Borrowing from Marshall McLuhan’s media theory, one could say that these case studies use communications media to produce a “counter-environment” within the nation. As works of conceptual nationalism, they reflexively engage an aesthetic transformation of the social imaginary that constitutes a nation-state...|$|R

We strongly recommend the student to do this with the actual bones at hand-- they may be cleared very easily in a well-boiled rabbit. This recommendation may appear superfluous to some readers, but, as a matter of fact, the marked proclivity of the average schoolmaster for mere <b>book-work</b> has put such a stamp on study, that, in nine cases out of ten, a student, unless he is expressly instructed to the contrary, will go to the tortuous, and possibly inexact, descriptions of a book for a knowledge of things that lie at his very finger-tips. We have not written, this chapter to give a complete knowledge of the skeleton, but simply as an aid in the actual examination of the bones.|$|E
60|$|At present, {{young men}} {{come to the}} medical schools without a {{conception}} of even the elements of physical science; they learn, for the first time, that there are such sciences as physics, chemistry, and physiology, and are introduced to anatomy as a new thing. It may be safely said that, with {{a large proportion of}} medical students, much of the first session is wasted in learning how to learn--in familiarising themselves with utterly strange conceptions, and in awakening their dormant and wholly untrained powers of observation and of manipulation. It is difficult to over-estimate the magnitude of the obstacles which are thrown in the way of scientific training by the existing system of school education. Not only are men trained in mere <b>book-work,</b> ignorant of what observation means, but the habit of learning from books alone begets a disgust of observation. The book-learned student will rather trust to what he sees in a book than to the witness of his own eyes.|$|E

Forster asked if I had any objection to his giving him lessons. It {{is the first time that}} I ever heard of such a request, and to allow it would be contrary to all idea of discipline; still, a lad of that sort deserves encouragement, and I will talk with the padre concerning him. He is one of the most good-natured of men, and I think he would not mind giving a quarter of an hour a day to this boy, after he has dismissed the midshipmen from their studies. Of course he must do the same work as the other boys, and no distinction must be made between them.” ...|$|E
60|$|Many schools, {{both public}} and private, have now adopted--in most cases unconsciously--many of Spencer's more {{detailed}} suggestions. The laboratory method of instruction, for example, now common for scientific subjects in good schools, is an application of his doctrines of concrete illustration, training in the accurate use of the senses, and subordination of <b>book-work.</b> Many schools realise, too, that learning by heart and, in general, memorising from books {{are not the only}} means of storing the mind of a child. They should make parts of a sound education, but should not be used to the exclusion of learning through eye, ear, and hand. Spencer pointed out with much elaboration that children acquire in their early years a vast amount of information exclusively through the incessant use of their senses. To-day teachers know this fact, and realise much better than the teachers of fifty years ago did, that all through the school and college period the pupils should be getting a large part of their new knowledge through the careful application of their own powers of observation, aided, indeed, by books and pictures which record the observations, old and new, of other people. The young human being, unlike the puppy or the kitten, is not confined to the use of his own senses as sources of information and discovery; but can enjoy the fruits of a prodigious width and depth of observation acquired by preceding generations and adult members of his own generation. A recent illustration of this extension of the method of observation in teaching to observations made by other people is the new method of giving moral instruction to school children through photographs of actual scenes which illustrate both good morals and bad, the exhibition of the photographs being accompanied by a running oral comment from the teacher. In this kind of moral instruction it seems to be possible to interest all kinds of children, both civilised and barbarous, both ill-bred and well-bred. The teaching comes through the eye, for the children themselves observe intently the pictures which the lantern throws on the screen; but the striking scenes thus put before them probably lie in most instances quite outside the region of their own experiences.|$|E

One month India lay as still and peaceful, to all appearance, as Surrey or Kent; the next there were two hundred {{thousand}} black devils let loose, and the country was a perfect hell. Of course you know all about it, gentlemen,--a deal more than I do, very like, since reading is not in my line. I only know what I saw with my own eyes. Our plantation was {{at a place called}} Muttra, near the border of the Northwest Provinces. Night after night the whole sky was alight with the burning bungalows, and day after day we had small companies of Europeans passing through our estate with their wives and children, on their way to Agra, where were the nearest troops. Mr. Abelwhite was an obstinate man. He had it in his head that the affair had been exaggerated, and that it would blow over as suddenly as it had sprung up. There he sat on his veranda, drinking whiskey-pegs and smoking cheroots, while the country was in a blaze about him. Of course we stuck by him, I and Dawson, who, with his wife, used to do the <b>book-work</b> and the managing. Well, one fine day the crash came. I had been away on a distant plantation, and was riding slowly home in the evening, when my eye fell upon something all huddled together {{at the bottom of a}} steep nullah. I rode down to see what it was, and the cold struck through my heart when I found it was Dawson's wife, all cut into ribbons, and half eaten by jackals and native dogs. A little further up the road Dawson himself was lying on his face, quite dead, with an empty revolver in his hand and four Sepoys lying across each other in front of him. I reined up my horse, wondering which way I should turn, but at that moment I saw thick smoke curling up from Abelwhite's bungalow and the flames beginning to burst through the roof. I knew then that I could do my employer no good, but would only throw my own life away if I meddled in the matter. From where I stood I could see hundreds of the black fiends, with their red coats still on their backs, dancing and howling round the burning house. Some of them pointed at me, and a couple of bullets sang past my head; so I broke away across the paddy-fields, and found myself late at night safe within the walls at Agra.|$|E

In this {{paper we discuss}} the technology behind the user interface. 1 Introduction HERA is an equational reasoning assistant. It assists the user by taking requests for actions to be performed on partially complete proofs. Typical requests that the user might make include: ffl Use this specific lemma, on this specific sub-expression. ffl Perform case analysis on a formula, splitting it into a set of formulas. ffl Specify a new lemma to prove. ffl Request {{a reminder of the}} exact form of a lemma. HERA itself looks after the <b>book-work,</b> like what lemmas remain unproven, performing ff-conversions, etc. A first prototype of HERA was constructed with a straightforward ascii interface.

The exhibition continued to explore themes of ‘animality’ – previously developed in The Institute of Beasts – but this time in a more expansive physical environment using large-scale neon and sound. The Stag and Hound focused more on disturbing taxonomies by providing an elaborate ‘forest’ of signs, approaches, methods and materials, deliberately tripping up linear narratives and interpretations. The exhibition was open to the public for 12 weeks, including a six week open residency period during which time one or both artists, Dutton and Swindells, were present. During the exhibition the artists launched their book ‘The Institute of Beasts’, published by Site Gallery and distributed by Cornerhouse books ISBN 978 1 899926 13...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper was}} given at IMPACT 7 International Multi Disciplinary Printmaking: Intersections and Counterpoints conference {{organised}} and hosted by MONASH University, Melbourne, Australia. The paper {{is due to}} be published by Monash University Publishing. Bullen’s research interests centre around drawing as a form of meditative inquiry into colour as light, silence, time and perception, in which print media and the ‘artist’ book have a pivotal position. In this practice drawing (and printmaking as an extension of drawing) is reduced to the fundamental activity of making one mark after another, in both intuitive and predetermined sequences. In recent drawings colour is activated by a concentrated series of dots (almost like pixels in a digitised image) of colour pencil. When viewed from a distance, they dissolve, producing a fluctuating surface of indeterminate colour. This commentary focuses on a collaborative project between Bullen and the composer Jamie Crofts, which centres on a limited edition <b>book-work</b> which seeks to assimilate different disciplines, in this case, drawing, music and print media, as a means to examine aural and visual liminality. The project investigates the relationship between composition, notation, drawing, music and silence, as well as the importance of accuracy and inaccuracy of the human hand, resulting in fluctuations in touch and pulse. A shared interest in repetition and near – repetition allows for the possibility of variable permutation of small units, in which the interactive act of opening and turning pages adds a sequential and temporal dimension. The book incorporates screen-printed score, image, and contains a CD of mp 3 s and data. The paper will also discuss the nature of a collaborative practice between artist and composer, and artist/composer and printer/designer. It also addresses a concern to positioni print as an extension of drawing, and as a means of extending its field through the vehicle of the artist’s book and collaborative practice. Bullen’s reductive abstraction invites a slowing down of visual perception and the attentive nature of compositional processes connect to ideas of contemplative practice that run counter to a society fixated by speed...|$|E
