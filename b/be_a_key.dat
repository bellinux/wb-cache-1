5|$|As {{a form of}} Western esotericism, the New Age has antecedents {{that stretch}} back to {{southern}} Europe in Late Antiquity. Following the Age of Enlightenment in 18th century Europe, new esoteric ideas developed {{in response to the}} development of scientific rationality. This new esoteric trend is termed occultism by scholars, and it was this occultism which would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> factor {{in the development of the}} worldview from which the New Age emerged.|$|E

5|$|Three warrant {{officers}} survived: the gunner and carpenter were spared {{because they}} were considered useful to the ship, and Southcott the master was spared so he could navigate. Southcott lived to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> witness, along with Casey, who was also spared, and their eyewitness accounts and testimony were key to the trials {{of many of the}} mutineers. Three petty officers joined the mutiny, one midshipman, Surgeon's Mate Cronin, and Master's Mate Turner.|$|E
5|$|During the Anarchy (1135–1153) rival {{factions of}} King Stephen and the Empress Matilda contested the kingdom and Worcestershire proved to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> battleground. The first attack on Worcester itself {{occurred}} in late 1139 when an Angevin army from Gloucestershire assaulted the city. After {{an attempt to}} take the castle {{on the south side}} of the city, the Gloucester forces entered from the north, looting and burning. Worcester became a base for Stephen's forces for a period, before joining the Empress's faction. In response, Stephen first stormed and burnt the city in 1148, and then attacked it again in 1150, shortly before the end of the conflict. From the accounts of these sieges, it appears that Worcester still lacked substantial walls during this period.|$|E

5|$|James {{continued}} to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> defensive player for the Browns in 1949, {{when the team}} won another AAFC championship behind a staunch defense and an offense led by quarterback Otto Graham and fullback Marion Motley. The AAFC dissolved after the season, however, and the Browns moved to the NFL. Cleveland's first year in the NFL {{was the best of}} James's career: he intercepted nine passes, setting a club record that stood until 1978. The team finished the season with a 10–2 record and beat the Los Angeles Rams to win the NFL championship. James made an interception in the game. He also held the ball for placekicker Lou Groza on the game-winning field goal with under a minute to play.|$|E
5|$|Massachusetts was {{an early}} center of the Transcendentalist movement, which {{emphasized}} intuition, emotion, human individuality and a deeper connection with nature. Ralph Waldo Emerson, {{who was born in}} Boston but spent much of his later life in Concord, largely created the philosophy with his 1836 work Nature, and continued to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> figure in the movement for the remainder of his life. Emerson's friend, Henry David Thoreau, who was also involved in Transcendentalism, recorded his year spent alone in a small cabin at nearby Walden Pond in the 1854 work Walden; or, Life in the Woods.|$|E
5|$|The American robin is a known {{reservoir}} (carrier) for West Nile virus. While crows and jays {{are often}} the first noticed deaths in an area with West Nile virus, the American robin is suspected to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> host, and holds a larger responsibility for the transmission of the virus to humans. This is because, while crows and jays die quickly from the virus, the American robin survives the virus longer, hence spreading it to more mosquitoes, which then transmit the virus to humans and other species.|$|E

5|$|The {{outlook for}} the {{upcoming}} 1915 Vanderbilt football season was not promising. The Commodores were coming off a losing record of 2–8, the first under head coach Dan McGugin, and the second in the school's 25 years of playing football. Additionally, only 10 experienced players {{from the previous year}} were returning to the team. Despite the one-platoon system with players featuring on offense, defense, and special teams used in 1915, this meant inexperienced freshmen would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> to the team's success.|$|E
5|$|Various studios {{rejected}} the project, until Glimcher persuaded Tom Pollock, chairman of Universal Studios, to financially back the film {{on a low}} budget. Before production could begin however, Pollock insisted that footage from the television series I Love Lucy <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> part of the film. Following Lucille Ball's death in 1989, Glimcher was unable to secure the rights to use footage for the film. After Universal cancelled production of The Mambo Kings, the project moved to Warner Bros. Glimcher met with the studio's president Terry Semel, who introduced him to producer Arnon Milchan. Milchan agreed to co-finance the film through his production company Regency Enterprises and the French-based film studio Le Studio Canal+. The film was allocated a budget of $15.5 million.|$|E
5|$|In January 2014, Pogba {{was named}} by The Guardian {{as one of}} the ten most {{promising}} young players in Europe. On 20 February, Pogba scored his first goal in UEFA club competitions as Juventus defeated Trabzonspor 2–0 at home in the first leg of the round of 32 of the 2013–14 UEFA Europa League. On 14 April, Pogba produced an assist in Juventus's 2–0 win over Udinese, the same team that Pogba scored two magnificent goals against in the previous season. Later that week, Pogba scored the only goal in Juventus's 1–0 win over Bologna. Pogba was also named the man of the match for his performance. Pogba would prove to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> player for the club that season, breaking into the starting line-up, and making more appearances (51) for the club than any other player across all competitions that season, also scoring 9 goals. He finished the season by winning his second consecutive Serie A title under manager Antonio Conte, and reaching the semi-finals of the Europa League.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1130s {{a period of}} civil war– the Anarchy– broke out in England, in which the rival factions of King Stephen and the Empress Matilda contested the kingdom; Worcestershire proved to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> battleground in the war. The first attack on Worcester itself {{occurred}} in late 1139, when an Angevin army from Gloucestershire assaulted the city; after an attempt to take the castle {{on the south side}} of the city, the Gloucester forces entered from the north, looting and burning the city. As a result, Walter de Beauchamp chose to side with Matilda. Worcester became a base for Stephen's forces for a period, with Stephen replacing Walter as the constable with Waleron de Beaumont, before the city and castle were reclaimed for the Empress by Robert of Gloucester. In response, Stephen first stormed and burnt the city in 1148, and then attacked it again in 1150, shortly before the end of the conflict. Two neighbouring siege castles were built by Stephen as part of these operations, designed to contain Worcester Castle itself, one at Henwick Hill the other at Red Hill. After the conflict, Walter was finally reaffirmed as the constable of Worcester Castle by Henry II, the Empress's son.|$|E
5|$|Jason starts {{work with}} an NGO in Thailand, having left his wife and {{children}} in Canada and abandoned a lucrative job at his father-in-law's legal firm. He communicates with his wife Ali over Skype. Jason's first task is to find witnesses to or survivors from a human-trafficking incident and then to shut down the brothels into which they have been trafficked; his boss Marta sends him into the brothels as she cannot enter herself. His specific focus is an Asia-wide brothel ring's trafficking of girls into Bangkok for prostitution as part of the child sex tourism industry. An abandoned storage truck has been discovered containing the bodies of dead sex workers. Attempting to build a legal case against the brothel ring, Jason pays to see prostitutes in the hope that one of them witnessed the incident. The first prostitute he sees is Number 18, whose attempts to seduce him make him uneasy. Thinking Number 18 could <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> witness, he tries to persuade her to testify. The other prostitutes Jason encounters are too afraid to give evidence. Number 18 answers some of Jason's questions about where she is from, where she has worked, and how long she has been working, but only on the condition that Jason pay 100 baht for each response. She reveals that she has been prostituted in Thailand and Malaysia.|$|E
5|$|Reading is {{considered}} to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> element of vocabulary development in school-age children. Before children are able to read on their own, children can learn from others reading to them. Learning vocabulary from these experiences includes using context, as well as explicit explanations of words and/or events in the story. This may be done using illustrations in the book to guide explanation and provide a visual reference or comparisons, usually to prior knowledge and past experiences. Interactions between the adult and the child often include the child's repetition of the new word back to the adult. When a child begins to learn to read, their print vocabulary and oral vocabulary {{tend to be the}} same, as children use their vocabulary knowledge to match verbal forms of words with written forms. These two forms of vocabulary are usually equal up until grade 3. Because written language is much more diverse than spoken language, print vocabulary begins to expand beyond oral vocabulary. By age 10, children's vocabulary development through reading moves away from learning concrete words to learning abstract words.|$|E

5|$|Sexual {{intercourse}} is {{the major}} mode of HIV transmission. Both X4 and R5 HIV {{are present in the}} seminal fluid, which is passed from a male to his sexual partner. The virions can then infect numerous cellular targets and disseminate into the whole organism. However, a selection process leads to a predominant transmission of the R5 virus through this pathway. In patients infected with subtype B HIV-1, there is often a co-receptor switch in late-stage disease and T-tropic variants appear that can infect a variety of T cells through CXCR4. These variants then replicate more aggressively with heightened virulence that causes rapid T cell depletion, immune system collapse, and opportunistic infections that mark the advent of AIDS. Thus, during the course of infection, viral adaptation to the use of CXCR4 instead of CCR5 may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> step in the progression to AIDS. A number of studies with subtype B-infected individuals have determined that between 40 and 50 percent of AIDS patients can harbour viruses of the SI and, it is presumed, the X4 phenotypes.|$|E
5|$|Since tool use is {{considered}} to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> feature of primate intelligence, the apparent lack of this behavior in wild lemurs, {{as well as the}} lack of non-food object play, has helped reinforce the perception that lemurs are less intelligent than their simian cousins. However, another study at the Myakka City Lemur Reserve examined the representation of tool functionality in both the ring-tailed lemur and the common brown lemur and discovered that, like monkeys, they used tools with functional properties (e.g., tool orientation or ease of use) instead of tools with nonfunctional features (e.g., color or texture). Although the ring-tailed lemur may not use tools in the wild, it can not only be trained to use a tool, but will preferentially select tools based on their functional qualities. Therefore, the conceptual competence to use a tool may have been present in the common primate ancestor, even though the use of tools may not have appeared until much later.|$|E
5|$|The Eagles' {{defense was}} ranked {{eighth in the}} nation in terms of total defense, {{allowing}} an average of 277 yards per game. The Eagles led the country in interceptions, recording 25 {{during the course of the}} regular season. The Eagles also were ranked among the top 10 in run defense, pass-efficiency defense, and No. 14 in scoring defense. That strong defensive effort was led by linebacker Mark Herzlich, who was selected as the ACC's defensive player of the year for the 2008 season. Herzlich led the Eagles in tackles with 98—fifth among all Division I players—and interceptions, with 6. He was forecast to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> player during the ACC Championship Game. Defensive tackle B. J. Raji recorded 33 tackles (11 for loss) and a team-high 7 sacks, part of a defense that allowed an average of just 87.3 rushing yards per game.|$|E
