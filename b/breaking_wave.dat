5|$|Leon of the Table D'hote is a 1910 American silent short comedy {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film follows Leon, a waiter at a table d'hote restaurant who {{is in love with}} Rosa, a French cashier at the same restaurant. Leon goes on vacation and poses as a foreign noble, attracts the interest of Violet Hope's mother as a suitable candidate to marry her daughter. While at the beach, Leon is knocked over by a <b>breaking</b> <b>wave</b> and Violet rescues him, earning Leon's gratitude. Rosa arrives after tracking Leon down and forces him to confess and return to the restaurant. Violet's mother then allows her daughter to marry the man of her choice. No cast or staff credits are known for the production. The film was released on October 4, 1910, and was met with praise by the reviewer of The New York Dramatic Mirror. The film is presumed lost.|$|E

40|$|The {{turbulence}} {{generated by}} microscale <b>breaking</b> <b>waves</b> beneath the air-water interface is simulated numerically. The {{goal of this}} study is to improve our understanding of the physical processes governing the transfer of gases across the ocean surface. The model predictions will ultimately be used to aid the development of a new parameterization of air-sea gas transfer that accounts for microscale <b>wave</b> <b>breaking.</b> Our specific objective is to quantitatively assess the hypothesis that microscale <b>wave</b> <b>breaking</b> is an important factor in the global air-sea flux of carbon dioxide. Microscale <b>breaking</b> <b>waves</b> are small scale <b>breaking</b> <b>waves</b> for which surface tension is sufficiently strong to prevent air entrainment. They are about 10 to 50 cm in length and a few centimeters in height. In the ocean microscale <b>breaking</b> <b>waves</b> occur much more frequently than white caps. Laboratory investigations have shown that at wind speeds from 4 to 10 m·s- 1 microscale <b>wave</b> <b>breaking</b> is the dominant physical mechanism that controls the rate of heat, momentum and gas transfer across the air-water interface [Zappa et al. 2001, Siddiqui et al. 2004]. <b>Wave</b> <b>breaking</b> provides a mechanism for the injection of both kinetic energy and momentum from air to water.

25|$|There are {{two main}} types of {{artificial}} waves that exist today. One being artificial or stationary waves which simulate a moving, <b>breaking</b> <b>wave</b> by pumping a layer of water against a smooth structure mimicking {{the shape of a}} <b>breaking</b> <b>wave.</b> Because of the velocity of the rushing water the wave and the surfer can remain stationary while the water rushes by under the surfboard. Artificial waves of this kind provide the opportunity to try surfing and learn its basics in a moderately small and controlled environment near or far from locations with natural surf.|$|E
25|$|Surfers' {{skills are}} tested by {{their ability to}} control their board in {{difficult}} conditions, riding challenging waves, and executing maneuvers such as strong turns and cutbacks (turning board back to the <b>breaking</b> <b>wave)</b> and carving (a series of strong back-to-back maneuvers). More advanced skills include the floater (riding {{on top of the}} breaking curl of the wave), and off the lip (banking off the <b>breaking</b> <b>wave).</b> A newer addition to surfing is the progression of the air whereby a surfer propels off the wave entirely up into the air, and then successfully lands the board back on the wave.|$|E
25|$|The {{parameters}} <b>breaking</b> <b>wave</b> height, wave peel angle (α), {{and wave}} breaking intensity, and wave section length {{are important because}} they are standardized by past oceanographers who researched surfing; these parameters {{have been used to}} create a guide that matches the type of wave formed and the skill level of surfer.|$|E

40|$|Breaking waves {{dissipate}} energy, transfer momentum {{from the}} wind to surface currents and breaking enhances the transfer of gas and mass across the air-sea interface. Breaking waves {{are believed to be}} the dominant source of sea surface sound at frequencies greater than 500 Hz and the presence of <b>breaking</b> <b>waves</b> on the ocean surface has been shown to enhance the scattering of microwave radiation. Previous studies have shown that <b>breaking</b> <b>waves</b> can be detected by measuring the microwave backscatter and acoustic radiation from <b>breaking</b> <b>waves.</b> However, these techniques have not yet proven effective for studying the dynamics of breaking. The primary motivation for the research presented in this thesis was to determine whether measurements of the sound generated by <b>breaking</b> <b>waves</b> could be used to quantitatively study the dynamics of the breaking process. Laboratory measurements of the microwave backscatter and acoustic radiation from two-dimensional <b>breaking</b> <b>waves</b> are described in Chapter 2.

40|$|An {{experimental}} method for simultaneously measuring the velocity fields {{on the air}} and water side of unsteady <b>breaking</b> <b>waves</b> is presented. The method is applied to <b>breaking</b> <b>waves</b> to investigate the physics of the air and water flow fields to further our knowledge of the impact of <b>wave</b> <b>breaking</b> on air-sea interaction. The method includes a novel technique for seeding the air flow such that the air velocity can be resolved in the absence of wind. Low density particles which have large Stokes drag and ability to respond to high frequency flow fluctuations are used to seed the air flow. Multi-camera, multi-laser particle image velocimetry (PIV) setups are applied to small-scale shoaling <b>breaking</b> <b>waves,</b> yielding fully time-resolved velocity fields. The surface tension of the fluid is altered and controlled to form both spilling and plunging <b>breaking</b> <b>waves.</b> Application of the developed {{experimental method}} to these <b>breaking</b> <b>waves</b> reveals interesting flow physics in the air and water.

The NZ yacht Swuzzlebubble VIII was rolled 360 degrees by a <b>breaking</b> <b>wave,</b> turtled, dismasted and swamped. On deck crew harnessed on were all recovered. The crew then cut the rig off, put out a No 3 headsil as a sea anchor and bailed her out while other yachts stood nearby. They managed to start the engine and motored into Eden. Meanwhile, Prime Factor of Adelaide came off a big wave at speed when the mast and the main bulkhead to which it was fastened pulled {{straight out of the}} deck of the boat and disappeared over the side. Two crew members of Advantaged were injured when the yacht capsized, snapping the mast off at the base, four crew were flung overboard but quickly recovered.

40|$|Surge waves {{resulting}} from dam breaks {{have been responsible}} for numerous losses. Modern predictions of dam <b>break</b> <b>wave</b> rely too often on numerical predictions, validated with limited data sets. Despite a few studies, there has been a lack of basic theoretical and physical studies for the past 40 years. Current knowledge of dam <b>break</b> <b>wave</b> surging down rough surfaces remains rudimentary, while there is still some arguments of the flow fundamentals. The present work is focused on simple solutions of the dam <b>break</b> <b>wave</b> problem using the Saint-Venant equations and the method of characteristics. Analytical solutions are developed for an instantaneous dam break with a semi-infinite reservoir in a wide rectangular channel. After a review of well-known solutions, further ideal-fluid flow solutions are detailed. These include ideal dam <b>break</b> <b>wave</b> flow on horizontal and sloping channels, with or without initial flow motion. The effect of the presence of water in the downstream channel is discussed. New analytical solutions of dam <b>break</b> <b>wave</b> of real fluids are developed for turbulent flow (Section 4.) and laminar flow motion (Section 5.). These simple theoretical developments include the <b>break</b> <b>wave</b> in horizontal channels with bed friction, dam <b>break</b> <b>wave</b> with initial flow motion, and dam <b>break</b> <b>waves</b> on flat slope channels with bed friction and initial flow motion. The analytical results were validated by successful comparisons between theoretical results and several experimental data sets obtained in large-size facilities. Later the analytical results are applied to three different turbulent flow situations: a dam break, the swash zone, and a tsunami runup. The advantages of the present developments are five-fold. First the theoretical results yield simple explicit analytical expressions of the dam <b>break</b> <b>wave</b> with flow resistance. The theoretical results compare well with experimental data and with more advanced theoretical solutions. They include both laminar and turbulent flow motion. Second the developments are simple, and they yield nice pedagogical applications of the Saint-Venant equations and method of characteristics that are wellsuited to undergraduate teaching of hydraulic engineering. Third the analytical solutions may be used to validate numerical solutions of the method of characteristics applied to the dam <b>break</b> <b>wave</b> problem. Fourth the development is applied {{to a wide range of}} flow conditions, including the effects of bed slope and initial flow motion. This yields a wide range of practical applications. Fifth the simplicity of the equations may allow the extension of the method to more complex fluids (e. g. non-Newtonian fluids).

40|$|Abstract—The {{microwave}} backscattering of the {{sea surface}} is investigated with the wedge-shaped <b>breaking</b> <b>waves</b> for the super events at low grazing angles (LGA). According {{to the relationship between}} the <b>wave</b> <b>breaking</b> and the whitecap, the finite three-dimensional wedges are utilized to approximately model the <b>breaking</b> <b>waves,</b> of which the spatial distribution is simulated with whitecap coverage. The phase-modified two-scale method (TSM) and method of equivalent currents (MEC) are used to calculate the surface and volume scattering of sea surface and <b>breaking</b> <b>waves</b> respectively. The sea spikes in LGA are observed by this model, and the strong directionality is caused by the breakers. Considering the Bragg phase velocity, orbital motion of facets and wind drift, the Doppler spectrum is simulated with the time series of sea clutter. Included the <b>breaking</b> <b>waves,</b> the scattering model indicates that the enhanced non-Bragg scattering leads to the extended Doppler spectrum width. The numerical results agree with the measured data well at LGA.
