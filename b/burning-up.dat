6000|$|There, readers, {{there is}} the next {{milestone}} for you, in the History of Mankind! That universal <b>Burning-up,</b> as in hell-fire, of Human Shams. The oath of Twenty-five Million men, which has since become that of all men whatsoever, [...] "Rather than live longer under lies, we will die!"--that is the New Act in World-History. New Act,--or, we may call it New PART; Drama of World-History, Part Third. If Part SECOND was 1,800 years ago, this I reckon will be Part THIRD. This is the truly celestial-infernal Event: the strangest we have seen for a thousand years. Celestial in one part; in the other, infernal. For it is withal the breaking out of universal mankind into Anarchy, into the faith and practice of NO-Government,--that is to say (if you will be candid), into unappeasable Revolt against Sham-Governors and Sham-Teachers,--which I do charitably define to be a Search, most unconscious, yet in deadly earnest, for true Governors and Teachers. That is the one fact of World-History worth dwelling on at this day; and Friedrich cannot {{be said to have}} had much hand farther in that.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, {{the people}} I was with----!' he rejoined; and his tone {{appeared}} to signify that such people {{would always have}} to come off as they could. He asked {{if there were no}} cold drinks in the house, no lemonade, no iced syrups; in such weather something of that sort ought always to be kept going. When his mother remarked that surely at the club they were going he went on, 'Oh, yes, I had various things there; but you know I have walked down the hill since. One should have something at either end. May I ring and see?' He rang while Mrs. Nettlepoint observed that with the people they had in the house--an establishment reduced naturally at such a moment to its simplest expression (they were <b>burning-up</b> candle-ends and there were no luxuries) she would not answer for the service. The matter ended in the old lady's going out of the room in quest of syrup with the female domestic who had appeared in response to the bell and in whom Jasper's appeal aroused no visible intelligence.|$|E
60|$|Fancy a man, moreover, recommending {{his fellow}} men {{to believe in}} God, that so Chartism might abate, and the Manchester Operatives be got to spin peaceably! The idea is more distracted than any placard-pole seen {{hitherto}} in a public thoroughfare of men! My friend, if thou ever do come to believe in God, thou wilt find all Chartism, Manchester riot, Parliamentary incompetence, Ministries of Windbag, and the wildest Social Dissolutions, and the <b>burning-up</b> of this entire Planet, a most small matter in comparison. Brother, this Planet, I find, is but an inconsiderable sand-grain in the continents of Being: this Planet's poor temporary interests, thy interests and my interests there, when I look fixedly into that eternal Light-Sea and Flame-Sea with its eternal interests, dwindle literally into Nothing; my speech of it is--silence for the while. I will as soon think of making Galaxies and Star-Systems to guide little herring-vessels by, as of preaching Religion that the Constable may continue possible. O my Advanced-Liberal friend, this new second progress, of proceeding 'to invent God,' is a very strange one! Jacobinism unfolded into Saint-Simonism bodes innumerable blessed things; but the thing itself might draw tears from a Stoic!--As for me, some twelve or thirteen New Religions, heavy Packets, most of them unfranked, having arrived here from {{various parts of the}} world, in a space of six calendar months, I have instructed my invaluable friend the Stamped Postman to introduce no more of them, if the charge exceed one penny.|$|E
60|$|There were bits of Anarchies before, {{little and}} greater: but till that of France in 1789, {{there was none}} long memorable; all were pygmies in comparison, and not worth {{mentioning}} separately. In 1772 the Anarchy of Poland, which had been a considerable Anarchy for about three hundred years, got itself extinguished,--what we may call extinguished;--decisive surgery being then first exercised upon it: an Anarchy put in the sure way of extinction. In 1775, again, there began, over seas, another Anarchy much more considerable,--little dreaming that IT could be called an Anarchy; on the contrary, calling itself Liberty, Rights of Man; and singing boundless Io-Paeans to itself, as is common in such cases; an Anarchy which has been challenging the Universe to show the like ever since. And which has, at last, flamed up as an independent Phenomenon, unexampled in the hideously SUICIDAL way;--and does need much to get burnt out, that matters may begin anew on truer conditions. But neither the PARTITION OF POLAND nor the AMERICAN WAR OF INDEPENDENCE have much general importance, or, except as precursors of 1789, are worth dwelling on in History. From us here, so far as Friedrich is concerned with them, they may deserve some transient mention, more or less: but World-History, eager {{to be at the}} general Funeral-pile and ultimate <b>Burning-up</b> of Shams in this poor World, will have less and less to say of small tragedies and premonitory symptoms.|$|E
40|$|The {{point of}} this bachelor’s thesis is to {{characterize}} different types of nuclear fuels and their behaviour {{during the process of}} <b>burning-up.</b> Futher, basic types of nuclear reactors are mentioned, as well as their history and different kinds of nuclear fuels used in these reactors. Then there are pieces of information about fuel cycles and fuel <b>burning-up.</b> Furthermore, the thesis concentrates on the changes, which happen in the nuclear fuel during the process of <b>burning-up,</b> such as swelling and cracking. In its other parts, this bachelor’s thesis deals with fission products, mainly gas fission products are mentioned here. At the end of this thesis, a simple model of nuclear fuel <b>burning-up</b> is created. This model follows concentration of izotopes of uranium and plutonium during fuel <b>burning-up...</b>|$|E
40|$|An accelerator-driven {{subcritical}} reactor functions well in incinerating high-level radiotoxic waste (HLW) as well {{as providing}} energy. China {{is on his way to}} establish such a facility to transmutate the annual 1000 tons of HLW. A neutronic analysis has been performed for a reference core with a special task of burning minor actinides 237 Np, 241 Am, 243 Am and 244 Cm. Instant operation parameters are determined, including neutron energy spectra, thermal power distribution and transmutation validation. <b>Burning-up</b> analysis is carried out to further confirm the incineration efficiency. The core parameters optimized in this work will be applied to simulate in-core fuel behavior in future research. Comment: This paper has been withdrawn by the author since it is outdate...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{evaluates the}} length-dependence {{of a number}} of space environmental accelerations, both orbital and angular. Many non-gravitational effects accelerate a smaller body more than a larger body, thanks to ratios such as area-to-mass that vary inversely with characteristic length. This research studies these accelerations, and the corresponding dynamics, with an interest in applying the results to methods of propellant-free spacecraft propulsion. After surveying space environmental accelerations, the analysis focuses on three particular cases: solar radiation pressure, aerodynamic drag, and the Lorentz force. Each of these accelerations has an explicit dependence on length-scaling, such that millimeter-scale bodies experience characteristically larger magnitudes of acceleration than typical spacecraft. For the case of solar-radiation pressure, a flat integrated circuit is considered as a low-cost, feasible solar sail with passive, locally and/or globally stable attitude control. The modified orbital and attitude dynamics are considered for heliocentric, geocentric, and three-body orbits. For aerodynamic drag, a similar thin-plate integrated circuit bus is considered for atmospheric re-entry. Here, the spacecraft's cross-sectional area-to-mass ratio drives the magnitude of drag. So, small bodies can remove orbital kinetic energy very efficiently. Further, length-scaling laws for thermodynamics and fluid mechanics show that a very small spacecraft can even survive the intense re-entry thermal environment without <b>burning-up</b> or requiring active control. Research on the Lorentz force has found that an orbiting body with an electrostatic charge can interact with a planetary magnetic field and experience a force. In this case, the driving parameter is the electrostatic charge-to-mass ratio, a quantity that depends on the inverse square of characteristic length. This analysis presents a proposal for a small spacecraft that can demonstrate the Lorentz force in Earth orbit. A sample low charge-to-mass mission is proposed, wherein the Lorentz force is considered for Jovian capture and orbit circularization. The Lorentz force is also evaluated in relation to the so-called Earth Flyby Anomaly, in which an unknown acceleration affected the orbit of six spacecraft as they were executing Earth gravity assists. This research finds that the Lorentz force cannot be associated with the unknown acceleration, in spite of having similar characteristics...|$|E
