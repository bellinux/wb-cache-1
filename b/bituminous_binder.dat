The term 'surface course' is sometimes used, however this term is slightly different {{as it can be}} used to describe very thin surface layers such as chip seal.

There are various different types of flexible pavement wearing course, suitable for different situations. Stone mastic asphalt is a type of flexible pavement wearing course which is typically used for heavily trafficked roads.|$|E

40|$|Fatigue {{cracking}} of bituminous mixtures {{is closely}} related to the loss of ductility produced by the stiffening of the <b>bituminous</b> <b>binder.</b> The main two factors that cause the asphalt binder to lose its ductility are aging and exposure to low temperatures. However, most of the tests designed to evaluate the fatigue behavior of bituminous mixtures are very time consuming, and make unpractical those studies that try to evaluate the influence of many variables. In this research project a strain sweep test was used to analyze the influence of aging, test temperature and <b>bituminous</b> <b>binder</b> type on the fatigue behavior of a continuously graded mixture. As expected, the mixture with SBS polymer modified binder retained more ductility at low temperatures, while the mixture with crumb rubber modified binder had the highest stiffness modulus.

40|$|In the Shell Pavement Design Method (SPDM), {{the effect}} of the <b>bituminous</b> <b>binder</b> on {{permanent}} deformation is modelled via a relation between the stiffness of the asphaltic mix and its <b>bituminous</b> <b>binder</b> under long loading time conditions. Stiffness relationships obtained from accelerated testing in the Laboratory Test Track (LTT) are considered to be representative for rutting behaviour in practice, but these tests are laborious. Previously, such relations were determined by static creep experiments, which {{turned out not to be}} suitable for modified binders. The aim of the study is to identify other laboratory tests and conditions from which the stiffness relationships correlate or preferably match the LTT relationships. Alternative tests investigated are the Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP) repetitive simple shear test at constant height, unconfined dynamic creep test and triaxial tests. These tests were applied to dense-graded asphaltic concrete containing different type of bitumens: standard bitumens, multi-grade bitumens (MULTIPHALTE-type) and polymer modified bitumen of the CARIPHALTE-type. Stiffness relationships derived from the SHRP shear test (Repetitive Simple Shear Test at Constant Height- RSCH) and the unconfined dynamic creep test practically coincide, indicating that essentially the same stiffness relationship is obtained from both tests. Moreover, the stiffness relations derived from these tests were found to be in line with the relations obtained from accelerated pavement deformation tests in the Laboratory Test Track (LTT). In other words these small scale laboratory tests are considered to be suitable to provide stiffness relationships required by the Shell Pavement Design rutting calculation method. J.

40|$|The {{necessity}} for safer wearing courses drove, {{in the last}} years, many researchers to bring to perfection the development of draining and noise reducing asphalt pavements. This kind of bituminous road surface, indeed, can significantly reduce the risks for users in case of rainfalls, thanks to the rapid superficial water removal, the reduction of noise due to vehicle movement being also involved, {{as well as an}} overall improvement in the grip performances. During this research, the Authors compared the mechanical and superficial performances of two draining and noise reducing bituminous pavements laid in the city of Potenza, thanks to the help of the Provincial Administration. In particular, a typical draining wearing course was considered, the overall performances being compared to the corresponding characteristics of an innovative twin-layer made of two bituminous layers one on the other. The grading curve of both road typologies were chosen in order to fulfil the requirements of the sieve analysis of SITEB (Italian Association of Bitumen Workers).

40|$|One of {{the main}} distresses {{affecting}} asphalt pavements is rutting, which originates from the accumulation of permanent deformation caused by traffic loading.

In addition we have used artificial neural networks for modeling relationship between different parameters and air voids content in asphalt mixtures and voids content {{in a mixture of}} aggregate.

Then, it has allowed describing the corresponding curves of complex modulus versus the set stress and the rest period at different conditioning times of samples.
