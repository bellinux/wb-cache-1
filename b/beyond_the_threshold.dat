The brief, anonymously published work describes a vibration referred to as thanato-auric waves, which the machine electrically generates by combining three infrasonic sine waves (3Hz, 9Hz and 0.56Hz) with concomitant tape loops of unspecified spoken text (two <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>threshold</b> of decipherability, and two beneath the threshold).|$|E

Because of their nature, they are incapable of contacting or having any power in either the Supernal or Fallen World, and as such they require agents to grant them potency. Gulmoth are the entities that normally reside in the Abyss until summoned either by catastrophic Paradox or deliberate summoning by insane or desperate mages, existing only {{for a time in}} the Fallen World to further the Abyss' overall goal of destroying the cosmos. Acamoth are those Abyssal beings that have somehow become trapped in the cosmos, and offer mages pacts in return for using their souls as vessels to mentally journey back to their home - a proposition that deeply threatens their sanity.|$|E
500|$|The {{album is}} {{primarily}} a heavy metal record, and contains some of the heaviest material the band has ever recorded. It also contains songs which have been ascribed to various sub-genres, such as punk rock, gothic rock, EBM, industrial, glam rock and blues. Manson {{has said that the}} album is a departure from the band's previous records, and that it was inspired by the work of acts he listened to before forming Marilyn Manson: namely Killing Joke, Joy Division, Revolting Cocks, Bauhaus and The Birthday Party. He also revealed that the band employed the hypersonic effect during recording, whereby they altered the frequencies of sound effects to <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>threshold</b> of conscious human hearing. He explained that this was done to [...] "meddle with people's reactions" [...] to the album—and hoped it would make listeners feel nauseous.|$|E

40|$|Air {{temperature}} thresholds are {{investigated and}} proposed for acceptable comfort in air-conditioned buildings. Using the ASHRAE database of field {{studies in which}} acceptability votes were obtained from occupants, it is shown that within <b>the</b> <b>thresholds,</b> <b>the</b> acceptability is indistinguishable. Therefore, there is little gain from conditioning spaces to an “optimum” air temperature and a significant energy savings. However <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>thresholds,</b> {{there is a significant}} drop-off in acceptability. Ideally, air-conditioning would be used only when the environmental conditions are <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>thresholds.</b> <b>The</b> use of ceiling fans or personal environmental control systems broadens <b>the</b> <b>threshold</b> range. Thresholds are determined for both air-conditioned and ventilation-cooled buildings in the database. The equally-acceptable range between <b>the</b> <b>thresholds</b> is 8 – 10 K wide in both types of buildings. It is possible that a perception of reduced air quality in warm environments could impose an upper temperature threshold. Perceived air quality (PAQ) is examined in two laboratory studies done at air temperatures from 18 - 30 deg C. PAQ is seen to be closely correlated to thermal comfort rather than temperature; as long as thermal comfort is maintained by the air movement, PAQ will be acceptable. Relationships between temperature thresholds and productivity, operating setpoints, and energy use are also discussed...|$|R
30|$|Ball radius The {{quality of}} the reconstructed surface depends heavily on the ball radius. Increasing the ball radius causes loss of details and {{creation}} of holes in the reconstructed surface (Figs.  25, 26). Computation time also increase with increase in ball radius value, {{up to a certain}} <b>threshold</b> radius. After <b>the</b> <b>thresholding</b> ball radius, increase in the radius causes the computation time to decrease exponentially, although the reconstruction quality goes down drastically as we go <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>thresholding</b> ball radius (Figs.  27, 28). A slightly larger ball radius is generally preferred in case of noisy and low density point clouds.|$|R
500|$|The crew {{realised}} {{that the}} aircraft would {{not last long}} enough to enable a landing back on 28L, and declared a Mayday. Davis cleared the aircraft to land on runway 05R, which was [...] long. He also instructed two other aircraft to perform a go-around, as runway 05R crossed runway 28R, which they were due to land on and Davis {{did not know whether}} Flight 712 would be able to stop before reaching that runway. The crew accepted Davis's offer of runway 05R, even though it was much shorter and not equipped with ILS. Taylor was able to safely land the aircraft on 05R, using wheel brakes and reversing the outboard engines' thrust to halt the aircraft. [...] The aircraft touched down about [...] <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>threshold</b> and stopped in [...] [...] Taylor asked Davis for permission to evacuate, but the cabin crew were already opening the emergency doors. The flight crew started the fire drill, but the port wing exploded before this could be completed. As a result, the fire shut off handles were not pulled, and the booster pumps and electrical supply were left switched on. Due to the short period of time between the Mayday being declared at 15:29 and the aircraft landing at 15:31, {{there was no time for}} the emergency services to lay a carpet of foam, which was standard practice at the time.|$|E
2500|$|As {{editor of}} Convorbiri Literare, Tzigara also entered a polemic {{with a younger}} Maiorescu disciple, the critic and novelist Eugen Lovinescu. At the root of this debate stood Lovinescu's book on Mite Kremnitz and her affair with {{national}} poet (and Junimist herald) Mihai Eminescu. Joining in with other conservatives who accused Lovinescu of being a [...] "pornographer", Tzigara claimed to defend Eminescu's image from the book's impiety. Lovinescu offered his replies in the daily Adevărul, accusing Tzigara of [...] "literary incompetence", and deploring the decline of Convorbiri <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>threshold</b> of professionalism: [...] "if, under previous directions, the magazine steered away from its stated mission , the deviance was at least made in an honorable direction, {{that is to say}} in the direction of history writing; the scientific seriousness of its two former directors had made it possible for Convorbiri to have valid contributions in areas other than literature." [...] In reaction to claims of irreverence, he derided his adversary's artistic expertise as being about [...] "Easter eggs", and defended his narrative as a sample of respect for Eminescu's life and legacy.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{destabilizing}} fields on the roll instability (RI) threshold for shear flow {{and on the}} homogeneous instability (HI) threshold for plane Poiseuille flow of nematic HBAB (μ 3 > 0) is studied {{on the basis of}} the continuum theory of nematics for flow cells of infinite lateral width. It turns out that the critical shear rate and wave vector at RI threshold decrease with increasing destabilizing field but do not approach zero at the Freedericksz transition. However calculations show that <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> Freedericksz <b>threshold</b> HI may be favourable over a range of destabilizing field with shear in the stabilizing role. For plane Poiseuille flow a similar analysis points to the existence of a HI <b>threshold</b> in <b>the</b> presence of destabilizing field <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> Freedericksz <b>threshold</b> again with shear acting as a stabilizing field.

30|$|Videomicroscopic bedside {{techniques}} have allowed direct visualization of microvascular flow, {{especially at the}} sublingual mucosa [25]. Microcirculatory flow or density abnormalities have been described and linked to bad outcome during septic shock [26, 27]. Microcirculatory dysfunction with microvascular shunting could contribute to the genesis of hyperlactatemia in selected patients [12]. We recently demonstrated a significant correlation between hyperlactatemia and microcirculatory derangements in a large series of septic shock patients [14]. Interestingly, {{the majority of our}} patients exhibited significant microcirculatory abnormalities, irrespective of the status of lactate clearance. The median 6 -hour values of proportion of perfused vessels, MFI, and PVD among microcirculatory parameters are well <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>thresholds</b> associated with morbidity or mortality in previous studies [1, 2].

5000|$|The viable system {{theory of}} Schwarz is more {{directed}} towards the explicit examination of issues of complexity than {{is that of}} Beer. The theory begins {{with the idea of}} dissipative systems. While all isolated systems conserve energy, in non-isolated systems, one can distinguish between conservative systems (in which the kinetic energy is conserved) and dissipative systems (where the total kinetic and potential energy is conserved, but where part of the energy is changed in form and lost). If dissipated systems are far from equilibrium they [...] "try" [...] to recover equilibrium so quickly that they form dissipative structures to accelerate the process. Dissipative systems can create structured spots where entropy locally decreases and so negentropy locally increases to generate order and organisation. Dissipative systems involve far-from-equilibrium process that are inherently dynamically unstable, though they survive through the creation of order that is <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>thresholds</b> of instability.|$|R
