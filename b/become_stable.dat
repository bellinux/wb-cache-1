5|$|Punctuated {{equilibrium}} (also called punctuated equilibria) is {{a theory}} in evolutionary biology which proposes that once species appear in the fossil record they will <b>become</b> <b>stable,</b> showing little evolutionary change {{for most of their}} geological history. This state is called stasis. When significant evolutionary change occurs, the theory proposes that it is generally restricted to rare and geologically rapid events of branching speciation called cladogenesis. Cladogenesis is the process by which a species splits into two distinct species, rather than one species gradually transforming into another.|$|E

25|$|When the surfer is at wave speed, the surfer must quickly pop up, stay low, {{and stay}} {{toward the front}} of the wave to <b>become</b> <b>stable</b> and prevent falling as the wave steepens. The {{acceleration}} is less toward the front than toward the back. The physics behind the surfing of the wave involves the horizontal acceleration force (Fsinθ) and the vertical force (Fcosθ=mg). Therefore, the surfer should lean forward to gain more speed, and lean on back foot to brake. Also, to increase the length of the ride of the wave, the surfer should travel parallel to the wave crest.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{academic}} work {{has suggested that}} the castle was built around 1100, after the surrounding region of Somerset had <b>become</b> <b>stable</b> in the years following the Norman invasion of England and the subsequent Anglo-Saxon rebellion against Norman rule. The location Down End was strategically well placed, as the nearby Parrett is an important tidal river, essential for trade during the early medieval period. The de Columbers were probably responsible for building the castle, which also enjoyed a good defensive position on a natural ridge, protected by several nearby streams; the family also built nearby Stowey Castle. Norman and later pottery and iron objects were found during excavations in 1908; these match those found at the nearby castle of Neroche, also built around 1100.|$|E
500|$|On {{the day it}} {{was first}} tested the water was allowed to flow in, but one of the arches began to buckle under the weight. Brindley, {{overcome}} with anxiety, retired to his bed at the Bishop Blaize tavern in nearby Stretford. Gilbert, realising that Brindley had placed too much weight {{on the sides of the}} arch, removed the clay and laid layers of straw and freshly puddled clay; when the water was allowed to flow in again the masonry held firm. According to a statement by Francis Egerton, 8th Earl of Bridgewater printed in 1820, his uncle, the duke, had told him that there was a distortion of one of the arches, and that Gilbert had addressed the problem by placing [...] more weight on the crown of the arch and less on the haunches. The arch was then covered with straw and allowed to stand until the following spring, when the mortar was set and the arch had <b>become</b> <b>stable,</b> but its curve remained irregular.|$|E

The code compiles into a shared library, libfdk-aac. An open-source command-line interface front-end to the libfdk-aac encoder exists, called fdkaac. The current version is 0.6.3.

2500|$|The book {{is set in}} a post-apocalyptic world, {{ravaged by}} a [...] "Sixty Minute War", which caused massive {{geological}} upheaval. To escape the earthquakes, volcanoes, and other instabilities, a Nomad leader called Nikola Quercus installed huge engines and wheels on London, and enabled it to dismantle (or eat) other cities for resources. The technology rapidly spread, and evolved into what is known as [...] "Municipal Darwinism". Although the planet has since <b>become</b> <b>stable,</b> Municipal Darwinism has spread to most of the world except for Asia and parts of Africa. Much technological and scientific knowledge was lost during the war. Because scientific progress has almost completely halted, [...] "Old Tech" [...] is highly prized and recovered by scavengers and archaeologists. Europe, some of Asia, North Africa, Antarctica, and the Arctic are dominated by Traction Cities, whereas North America was so ravaged by the war that it is often identified as [...] "the dead continent", {{and the rest of the}} world is the stronghold of the Anti-Traction League, which seeks to keep cities from moving and thus stop the intense consumption of the planet's remaining resources.|$|E
2500|$|Retrograde amnesia is {{inability}} to recall memories before onset of amnesia. One {{may be able}} to encode new memories after the incident. Retrograde is usually caused by head trauma or brain damage to parts of the brain besides the hippocampus. The hippocampus is responsible for encoding new memory. Episodic memory {{is more likely to be}} affected than semantic memory. The damage is usually caused by head trauma, cerebrovascular accident, stroke, tumor, hypoxia, encephalitis, or chronic alcoholism. [...] People suffering from retrograde amnesia are more likely to remember general knowledge rather than specifics. Recent memories are less likely to be recovered, but older memories will be easier to recall due to strengthening over time. Retrograde amnesia is usually temporary and can be treated by exposing them to memories from the loss. Another type of consolidation (process by which memories <b>become</b> <b>stable</b> in the brain) occurs over much longer periods of time/days, weeks, months and years and likely involves transfer of information from the hippocampus to more permanent storage site in the cortex. The operation of this longer-term consolidation process is seen in the retrograde amnesia of patients with hippocampal damage who can recall memories from childhood relatively normally, but are impaired when recalling experiences that occurred just a few years prior to the time they became amnesic.

50|$|Addition of solute {{to form a}} {{solution}} stabilizes the solvent in the liquid phase, and lowers the solvent chemical potential so that solvent molecules have less tendency {{to move to the}} gas or solid phases. As a result, liquid solutions slightly above the solvent boiling point at a given pressure <b>become</b> <b>stable,</b> which means that the boiling point increases. Similarly, liquid solutions slightly below the solvent freezing point <b>become</b> <b>stable</b> meaning that the freezing point decreases. Both the boiling point elevation and the freezing point depression are proportional to the lowering of vapor pressure in a dilute solution.|$|E
