One important point that I believe has been demon-strated but not commented on is that, with some exceptions, agar cultures are better than <b>broth</b> <b>cultures</b> for the recovery of fastidious bacteria. This point was best demonstrated by Scythes et al. (6) in their evaluation of 10 broth media. Suspensions of laboratory-grown bacteria were made and inoculated into broth.

40|$|Standard {{methods for}} the methyl red (MR) test are not {{practical}} for routine use in clinical laboratories {{because of the}} necessarily prolonged incubation period. When read after overnight incubation, the usual MR test is often equivocal or falsely positive. The present study demonstrates the importance of standardizing the total volume of broth, {{the size of the}} vessel in which the cultures are incubated, and the density of the inoculum. In very small volumes of <b>broth,</b> <b>cultures</b> are better exposed to atmospheric oxygen, and thus MR-negative organisms tend to revert the initial acidic pH much more quickly than in deeper, large-volume <b>broth</b> <b>cultures.</b> In the proposed technique, a single colony was inoculated into a 0. 5 -ml amount of MR-Voges Proskauer (VP) broth (13 - by 100 -mm tube), and, after 18 to 24 hr at 37 C, one drop of MR was added. With this technique, the <b>broth</b> <b>cultures</b> produced either a definite red (positive) or yellow (negative) color, whereas various shades of orange were frequently observed when larger volumes of broth were tested after only 1 to 2 days of incubation.

Elimination of these multiple reactions caused by blood would permit rapid identification of group B streptococci in pregnant women. Vaginal <b>broth</b> <b>cultures</b> were examined to determine the cause of multiple reactions with slide coagglutination and to eliminate them from the testing procedure. Of 245 maternal <b>broth</b> <b>cultures,</b> 135 (55 %) yielded multiple reactions when tested by coagglutination. Such reactions were either eliminated or greatly diminished by heating the broth sample to 90 degrees C for 10 min.

40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the ability of}} a PCR assay to identify Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) from positive BACTEC® 12 B <b>broth</b> <b>cultures.</b> A total of 107 sputum samples were processed and inoculated into Ogawa slants and BACTEC® 12 B vials.

40|$|A microcolony {{technique}} {{has been demonstrated}} as being useful for the rapid determination of the viabilities of single cells of Myocbacterium fortuitum. Cultures of M. fortuitum grown to early logarithmic phase in broth were treated with the sputum digestant N-acetyl-L-cysteine-sodium hydroxide (NALC-NaOH) for periods of 10 to 40 s. After growth for three generations (7. 5 h) on agar films, viabilities were determined by counting under a phase contrast microscope. The viable mycobacteria grew into microcolonies that exhibited extensive branching, whereas the nonviable mycobacteria remained as single cells. Sputum was mixed with some <b>broth</b> <b>cultures</b> before treatment to stimulate the digestion process in a clinical laboratory. When <b>broth</b> <b>cultures</b> were treated with sputum digestant for 40 s, only 2. 8 % of the cells remained viable.

5000|$|The Kauffman-White {{classification}} scheme {{is the basis}} for naming the manifold serovars of Salmonella. To date, more than 2600 different serotypes have been identified. A Salmonella serotype is determined by the unique combination of reactions of cell surface antigens. The [...] "O" [...] antigen is determined by the outermost portion of the Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the [...] "H" [...] antigen is based on the flagellar (protein) antigens. There are two species of Salmonella: Salmonella bongori and Salmonella enterica. Salmonella enterica can be subdivided into six subspecies.The process to identify the serovar of the bacterium consists of finding the formula of cell antigens which represent the variations of the bacteria. First of all, the use of the agglutination method on slides is required {{in order to get the}} antigen formula. The agglutination between the antigen and the antibody is made with a specific antisera, which reacts with the antigen to produce a mass. The antigen O is tested with a bacterial suspension from an agar plate whereas the antigen H is tested with a bacterial suspension from a <b>broth</b> <b>culture.</b> The scheme is used to classify the serovar depending on its antigen formula obtained with the reaction of the agglutination.|$|E
40|$|Non-specific {{reactions}} in agglutination tests have long provided {{trouble for the}} bacteriologist. One of the chief offenders has been spontaneous agglutination. The pseudo-reactions obtained in the serologic agglutination of the obligate anaerobes Clostridium paraputrificum (1934) and Clostridium capitovalis (1935), how-ever, were not considered as due to spontaneous agglutination, but rather to the acid produced in the glucose <b>broth</b> <b>cultures</b> used. When the acid was eliminated {{it was easy to}} differentiate, these species on the basis of agglutination.

It was found, however, that a constituent of the broth was also a con-tributing factor. The relation of these serum-broth-acid re-actions to the acid agglutinations described by Michaelis (1911) was also studied. I. THE pH VALUES OF NON-SPECIFIC AGGLUTINATION WITH BROTH CULTURES OF CL.
