Specimens were 8 -foot high and 16 -foot long, double-sided with ” gypsum wallboard. Test variables included: fastener type and spacing, loading protocol, top-of-wall boundary condition, method of attaching the wallboard to the top sill, wall opening layout, innovative construction methods, influence of door and floor <b>trim,</b> and <b>repair</b> strategies. Instrumentation measured applied load, lateral deflection {{at the top of}} the wall, lateral deflection at the bottom of the wall, shear distortion of the piers, and uplift at the door trimmers. Findings include a distinct change in strength for walls built with various fastener types and wall penetration layouts. Damage patterns begin with the initiation of cracks at the wall penetrations and cracking of the paint over a few fastener heads, usually initiating at drift levels near 0. 25 %. Maximum loads are sustained at drifts of approximately 1 to 1. 5 %. At this point, one of two failure modes initiates. The first failure mode seen was loosening of the wallboard from the framing by pulling fastener heads through the back of the wallboard. The second failure mode included failure of the taped wall joints and racking movement of the individual wallboar...|$|R
40|$|Cattle leather with {{vertical}} fiber hide defect (VFHD) breaks when stretched and, consequently, is {{not suitable}} for production of shoe uppers.

2500|$|Following {{a public}} meeting on 22 July 1976, the Nottingham Canal Society was formed, {{with a view}} to {{preserving}} {{what was left of the}} canal, and to reinstating navigation between Langley Mill and Coventry Lane, Nottingham. They hoped to prevent further sections of the canal from being filled in, and to ensure that any plans for open-cast mining would include provision to reinstate the line of the canal afterwards. Also in 1976, children from Fernwood Junior School, Wollaton, created a nature trail along the bed of the canal near Wollaton colliery, and Browtowe Council announced that they were hoping to buy [...] of the canal for £7,350. The canal society began holding working parties to <b>trim</b> hedges, <b>repair</b> bridges, and mend the canal banks from April 1977, once ownership had passed from British Waterways to Browtowe Council. They also campaigned for the Awsworth Bypass, which was scheduled to be built in 1980, to include navigable headroom where it crossed the canal. A breach of the canal occurred in 1978, when part of the embankment at Trowell, near to the M1 motorway, slipped. It was repaired by the society, with some labour supplied by one of the local prisons, and machinery supplied by the Waterway Recovery Group. Bridge restoration work was carried out on the swing bridge at Bailey Grove, Eastwood and on Tinsley Road bridge, but in early 1979, Nottinghamshire County Council declared that the cost of a navigable bridge on the Awsworth Bypass would be £428,000. As that amount of money was not available, there would be no navigable culvert, and as that effectively prevented the canal reopening for navigation, the canal society was wound up soon afterwards.|$|R

Suddenly he found a Brahmin priest nearby. He came to pluck the flowers but on seeing Sage Narada he refrained from doing it.

The man told that an evil Brahmin daily comes and showers the Shivling with champa flowers. Lord Shiva is pleased with this act and due to His blessings the Brahmin has become very powerful in the King’s court and now harasses poor people.The Sage Narada went to Lord Shiva and asked why he is helping the bad man. Shiva told that I cannot deny a devotee who worships me with Champaka flowers.Sage Narada went back to the Champaka tree and cursed it for lying to him. He said that the champa flowers will never be accepted in worship of Lord Shiva. He also cursed the evil Brahmin to be born as demon and will attain only moksha when Lord Ram kills him.|$|R
40|$|In this study, we {{constructed}} tissue-engineered cartilage using allogeneic cancellous {{bone matrix}} gelatin (BMG) as a scaffold. Allogeneic BMG was prepared by sequential defatting, demineralization and denaturation. Isolated rabbit chondrocytes were seeded onto allogeneic cancellous BMG, and cell–BMG constructs were harvested after 1, 3 and 6 weeks for evaluation by hematoxylin and eosin staining for overall morphology, toluidine blue for extracellular matrix (ECM) proteoglycans, immunohistochemical staining for collagen type II and a {{transmission electron microscope}} for examining cellular microstructure on BMG. The prepared BMG was highly porous with mechanical strength adjustable by duration of demineralization and was easily <b>trimmed</b> for tissue <b>repair.</b> Cancellous BMG showed favorable porosity for cell habitation and metabolism material exchange with larger pore sizes (100 – 500 µm) than in cortical BMG (5 – 15 µm), allowing cell penetration.

Rich and evenly distributed cartilage ECM proteoglycans and collagen type II were observed around chondrocytes {{on the surface and}} inside the pores throughout the cancellous BMG.

5000|$|The {{acetabular}} labrum is a fibrous structure, which {{surrounds the}} femoral head. It forms a seal to the hip joint, although its true function is poorly understood. Recent evidence {{has demonstrated that}} this hydraulic seal is vital for maintaining stability of the {{ball and socket joint}} [...] and reducing contact pressures of the femur to the acetabulum. The labrum has also been shown to have a nerve supply and as such may cause pain if damaged. The underside of the labrum is continuous with the acetabular articular cartilage so any compressive forces that affect the labrum may also cause articular cartilage damage, particularly at the junction between the two, the chondrolabral junction. The labrum may be damaged or torn as part of an underlying process, such as FAI or dysplasia (shallow hip socket), or may be injured directly by a traumatic event. Depending on the type of tear, the labrum may be either <b>trimmed</b> (debrided) or <b>repaired.</b> Removing or debriding the labrum is becoming less popular as the latest research shows that results are more predictable in the long term if the labrum can be repaired. Various techniques are available for labral repair, mainly using anchors, which may be used to re-stabilise the labrum against the underlying bone, allowing it to heal in position.|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{increasing}} acceptance {{of the concept of}} femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) in sports medicine during the last decade, hip arthroscopy has evolved to a frequently performed standardized procedure and FAI to probably one of the main indications for hip arthroscopy (HAS). The diagnosis of FAI can be confirmed before arthroscopy; a painful and diminished internal rotation of the hip and characteristic findings on X-rays and MR Imaging are key. Open surgical dislocation of the hip still must be considered the golden standard for treating this condition; nevertheless, arthroscopic techniques allowing treating Off-Set pathologies in-between the posterosuperior and inferomedial retinaculum, acetabular rim <b>trimming</b> and even <b>repair</b> of the labrum are well described. Our own investigations using MR imaging after arthroscopy show that compared to open surgical dislocation the same quality of correction can be achieved within this sector. The advantages of the arthroscopic procedure are, in addition to the cosmetic aspect, the trochanteric osteotomy with consecutive eventual screw removal, which becomes unnecessary, shorter hospital stay and shorter rehabilitation time. The main limitations of HAS concern pathologies outside the sector in between the posterosuperior and anteroinferior retinaculum, which often are not well achievable, the consecutive risk of residual impingement, the very high technical skills necessary (for example for labral repair), and the potential of iatrogenic damage to cartilage. Therefore some morphological constellations still are contraindications for HAS and treated by open surgical dislocation in our hands...|$|R
