5|$|The main {{tension between}} {{fisheries}} {{science and the}} fishing industry {{is that the two}} groups have different views on the resiliency of fisheries to intensive fishing. In places such as Scotland, Newfoundland, and Alaska the fishing industry is a major employer, so governments are predisposed to support it. On the other hand, scientists and conservationists push for stringent protection, warning that many stocks could <b>be</b> <b>wiped</b> <b>out</b> within fifty years.|$|E
5|$|The 1942 Papuan {{campaign}} {{threw up}} {{a host of}} serious medical problems. The poor diet, mainly caused by the difficulty of supply by air or over jungle tracks, caused malnutrition and vitamin deficiencies. Poor hygiene led to dysentery. Malaria was hyperendemic, and when Fairley and Mackerras visited Papua in June 1942 they found high rates of infection among the troops even before the fighting had begun. At Milne Bay the incidence was so high in September 1942 {{that it looked like}} the garrison would <b>be</b> <b>wiped</b> <b>out</b> in a matter of months. The biggest killer, though, was typhus. Of the 2,839 soldiers who came down with it, 257 (9 percent) died. It fell to Burston promulgate the policies and practices that diminished the danger from disease and allowed the Australian Army to fight in New Guinea.|$|E

5|$|The {{game is a}} turn-based {{strategy}} {{focuses on}} the invasion and land battles of Iwo Jima. The player commands the United States Marine Corps against the Imperial Japanese Army, who are occupying the islands {{as part of the}} Pacific Ocean theatre of World War II. The game is menu-based and only allows the player to use four command functions; move, attack, land and pass. Depending on the difficulty set, the game lasts 32 to 36 turns and can only be won by eliminating all Japanese forces from the island before the final turn ends. During the game, the enemy may fortify their positions, launch air strikes against the United States Navy fleet or may perform suicide attacks if their unit is about to <b>be</b> <b>wiped</b> <b>out.</b> The player also has the ability to order air strikes against the enemy, if weather permits.|$|E
5|$|The Enterprise then learns of {{an unmarked}} vessel {{approaching}} Haven. Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) recognizes it as Tarellian, {{a race that}} they had thought to <b>be</b> <b>wiped</b> <b>out</b> by a highly lethal and contagious virus. When they contact the ship, they find a handful of Tarellian refugees that have been travelling at sub-light speeds to Haven in hopes of finding an isolated location to live {{out the rest of}} their lives in peace. Picard insists they cannot go to the planet for fear of spreading the virus, and has the Tarellian vessel placed in a tractor beam. Wyatt recognizes one of the Tarellians, Ariana (Danitza Kingsley), from his dreams, and she too recognizes Wyatt. Wyatt tells Dr. Crusher (Gates McFadden) that he will transport some medical supplies to them, but transports himself along with the supplies. When the crew discovers this, Wyatt's parents demand Picard bring Wyatt back to the Enterprise, but Picard insists that he cannot return, as Wyatt would now carry the Tarellian virus. Wyatt promises his parents, Troi, and the rest of the crew that he knew that this would be destiny, and is happy to try to help cure the Tarellian virus. Wyatt convinces the Tarellians to leave Haven and search for help elsewhere. Picard orders the tractor beam to be dropped and allows the vessel to depart the system.|$|E

25|$|The Chinese command, {{which had}} already lost 20,000 men, and a {{quantity}} of arms and ammunition, now asked for terms.

But Maha Thiha Thura, who oversaw the annihilation of Ming Rui's army at the battle of Maymyo in 1768, realized that another wipe-out would merely stiffen the resolve of the Chinese government.|$|E
25|$|Sin is not {{viewed by}} the Orthodox as a stain on the soul that needs to <b>be</b> <b>wiped</b> <b>out,</b> or a legal {{transgression}} that must be set right by a punitive sentence, {{but rather as a}} mistake made by the individual with the opportunity for spiritual growth and development. An act of Penance (epitemia), if the spiritual guide requires it, is never formulaic, but rather is directed toward the individual and their particular problem, as a means of establishing {{a deeper understanding of the}} mistake made, and how to effect its cure. Because full participatory membership is granted to infants, it is not unusual for even small children to confess; though the scope of their culpability is far less than an older child, still their opportunity for spiritual growth remains the same.|$|E
25|$|Enjoying {{the results}} of one's labour while alive is kriyaman; death before {{enjoyment}} produces sanchita karma or accumulated labour. Enjoying accumulated karma after rebirth is prarbdha. By virtue of sadhana, the effects of kriyaman and sanchita can <b>be</b> <b>wiped</b> <b>out</b> during a life {{but it is not}} possible to erase prarbdha. A person possessed with worldly ambitions is sure to continue the endless journey of birth and death. Jivatma leaves the gross body to travel in the spirit world or pret lok (ghost world). After undergoing karmic effects, it returns to the physical world with a body for the fulfillment of desires from its prior incarnation. How it moves from one world to another is a mystery. Yogis can perceive the mystery and tell the past sanskar of jiva.|$|E

25|$|Perhaps {{they have}} written exhaustively on this topic, {{and their work}} did not reach us. There are many sciences. There have been {{numerous}} sages among the nations of mankind.

25|$|In 2006 Palestinian {{legislative}} elections Hamas won {{a majority}} in the Palestinian Legislative Council, prompting the United States and many European countries to cut off all funds to the Hamas and the Palestinian Authority insisting that the Hamas must recognize Israel, renounce violence and accept previous peace pacts. Israel refused to negotiate with Hamas, since Hamas never renounced its beliefs that Israel has no right to exist and that the entire State of Israel is an illegal occupation which must <b>be</b> <b>wiped</b> <b>out.</b> EU countries and the United States threatened an economic boycott if Hamas will not recognize Israel's existence, not renounce terrorism and shall support the peace agreements signed between the PLO and Israel in the past. Hamas officials have openly stated that the organization does not recognize Israel's right to exist, even though the organization expressed openness to hold a long-term truce. Hamas is considered by Israel and many other countries to be a terrorist organization and therefore not entitled to participate in formal peace negotiations.|$|E
25|$|Pelagic whalers in the 19th century hunted {{large numbers}} of right whales along the coasts of Kamchatka and in the Sea of Okhotsk. The latter area is a large sea, ice covered most of the year, entirely in Russian waters. Due to Russian {{restrictions}} on access, little was known about whales in this sea. Soviet scientists indicated that historically two groups of right whales existed within western North Pacific that migrate along different side of Japanese Archipelago and each group had unique characteristics in distribution patterns due to geographical factors; the Okhotsk group which was distributed in more coastal waters with higher densities of congregations, and the Pacific group which have been distributed on far broader ranges and more was more oceanic (offshore). Of these, the Okhotsk group were regarded to <b>be</b> <b>wiped</b> <b>out</b> much earlier than the Pacific group because of geographical and distribution characteristics that eased whalers to hunt the targets, and this indication corresponds with the extreme rarity or virtual extinction of right whales in Sea of Japan or East China and South China Sea today.|$|E

25|$|However, most {{contemporary}} authors credit Daniel Khazzoom for the re-emergence of the rebound {{effect in the}} research literature. Although Khazzoom {{did not use the}} term, he raised {{the idea that there is}} a less than one-to-one correlation between gains in energy efficiency and reductions in energy use, because of a change in the 'price content' of energy in the provision of the final consumer product. His study was based on energy efficiency gains in home appliances, but the principle applies throughout the economy. A commonly studied example is that of a more fuel-efficient car. As each kilometre of travel becomes cheaper, there will be an increase in driving speed and/or kilometres driven, as long as the price elasticity of demand for car travel is not zero. Other examples might include the growth in garden lighting after the introduction of energy-saving compact fluorescent lamps or the increasing size of houses driven partly by higher fuel efficiency in home heating technologies. If the rebound effect is larger than 100%, all gains from the increased fuel efficiency would <b>be</b> <b>wiped</b> <b>out</b> by increases in demand (the Jevons paradox).|$|E
500|$|These games {{raised the}} profile of {{paraplegic}} (spinal cord and polio) athletes in Australia, particularly Western Australia. The Chairman of the Organising Committee, Hugh Leslie, who had lost a leg in World War Two, gave a speech aimed to change public perceptions about disabilities by addressing the power of language. These Games, he told the audience, ‘were designed {{to prove to the}} public that the person who was bodily handicapped was not a cripple, and he hoped that that horrible word would eventually <b>be</b> <b>wiped</b> <b>out</b> of use.
