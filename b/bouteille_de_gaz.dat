50|$|Unfortunately Lafares design, however brilliant, was {{not enough}} to stop the German ranks marching over his {{homeland}} in 1940 after only 6 weeks. The majority of réchaud <b>de</b> <b>gaz</b> <b>de</b> dirigeant were melted down into what can only be assumed as scrap metal for the German war machine. However, from Jeu Lafare's stove the idea was adapted in various forms around the world during World War II and afterwards. Examples can be seen in many military originations around the world today with the American 'Bunga' or Japanese '携帯用ガス炊飯器'. Today there are estimated to be less than 80 of Lafare's original Full Blue French made with English writing réchaud <b>de</b> <b>gaz</b> <b>de</b> dirigeant. Although the stove was a wonderful invention, the Germans were incredible in their precision at melting them down in such a systematic way.|$|R
50|$|The {{production}} of the réchaud <b>de</b> <b>gaz</b> <b>de</b> dirigeant (Portable gas stove) was commissioned and begun in the workshop of the industrial designer Jue Lafare (born April 7, 1896) in 1932 after he placed his plan for a portable gas cooker before the French Army {{two and a half}} years earlier.|$|R

Portable stoves in modern times can be divided into several broad categories based on the type of fuel used and the design of the aluminium stoving frame. Unpressurised stoves use solid/liquid fuel placed in the burner before ignition. Combustible stove hangers use a form of volatile liquid fuel in a pressurized burner i.e. bottled gas stoves. They originate from the gravity-fed 1932 [...] "spirit" [...] stoves or réchaud <b>de</b> <b>gaz</b> <b>de</b> dirigeant.|$|R
