40|$|<b>Black</b> <b>soldier</b> fly (Hermetia illucens) larvae are a {{promising}} {{source of protein}} and lipid for animal feeds. The nutritional composition of the BSF larvae depend partly on {{the composition of the}} feeding medium. The BSF lipid profile in part mimics the feeding media lipid profile, and micronutrients, like minerals and vitamins, can readily accumulate in <b>black</b> <b>soldier</b> fly larvae. However, investigative studies on bioconversion and accumulation of nutrients from media to <b>black</b> <b>soldier</b> fly larvae are scarce. Here we show that inclusion of the brown algae Ascophyllum nodosum in the substrate for <b>black</b> <b>soldier</b> fly larvae can introduce valuable nutrients, commonly associated with the marine environment, into the larvae. The omega- 3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (20 : 5 n- 3), iodine and vitamin E concentrations increased in the larvae when more seaweed was included in the diet. When the feeding media consisted of more than 50 % seaweed, the larvae experienced poorer growth, lower nutrient retention and lower lipid levels, compared to a pure plant based feeding medium. Our results confirm the plasticity of the nutritional make-up of <b>black</b> <b>soldier</b> fly larvae, allowing it to accumulate both lipid- and water-soluble compounds. A broader understanding of the effect of the composition of the feeding media on the larvae composition can help to tailor <b>black</b> <b>soldier</b> fly larvae into a nutrient profile more suited for specific feed or food purposes...|$|R

5|$|The Houston riot of 1917 {{disturbed}} Du Bois {{and was a}} major setback {{to efforts}} to permit African Americans to become military officers.

A military court martial was held, and 19 of the soldiers were hung, and 67 others were imprisoned. In spite of the Houston riot, Du Bois and others successfully pressed the Army to accept the officers trained at Spingarn's camp, resulting in over 600 black officers joining the Army in October 1917.|$|E
5|$|The US Army's basic wartime racial policy, {{established}} in 1937, dictated that both whites and African Americans {{were to be}} inducted into the Army in equal proportions and strength, but that they were to be assigned to segregated units. <b>Black</b> <b>soldiers</b> could be led by white officers, but not vice versa, and unit composition was to be strictly controlled by the War Department. The mix of combat and support service units was, in theory, to be roughly equal between both groups. This caused tension between the Department and operational commanders, with the latter generally unwilling to provide places for black combat units. In practice, almost all combat units in the pre-war period were white.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The <b>black</b> <b>soldier</b> fly, Hermetia illucens (L.), {{is thought}} to colonize corpses 20 – 30 days postmortem. However, recent {{observations}} indicate {{this might not be}} true for all cases. Therefore, we conducted a study examining colonization by the <b>black</b> <b>soldier</b> fly and other Diptera on pig carrion in a plowed field in southern Georgia from 20 September through 21 February. Our data indicate <b>black</b> <b>soldier</b> flies could colonize a corpse within the first week after death. Knowing this information could prevent a serious mistake in estimating the time at which a corpse is colonized by this species. This study also represents the first record of Chrysomya rufifacies in Georgia...|$|R

5|$|When the war ended, Du Bois {{traveled}} to Europe in 1919 {{to attend the}} first Pan-African Congress and to interview African-American soldiers for a planned book on their experiences in World War I. He was trailed by U.S. agents who were searching for evidence of treasonous activities. Du Bois discovered {{that the vast majority}} of black American soldiers were relegated to menial labor as stevedores and laborers. Some units were armed, and one in particular, the 92nd Division (the Buffalo soldiers), engaged in combat. Du Bois discovered widespread racism in the Army, and concluded that the Army command discouraged African Americans from joining the Army, discredited the accomplishments of <b>black</b> <b>soldiers,</b> and promoted bigotry.|$|E

5|$|Erika Hügel-Marshall {{was born}} on 13 March 1947, {{the child of a}} Bavarian woman and an African-American soldier, Eddie Marshall, who had {{returned}} to the US before her birth. Her parents had met just after the end of World War II, after a relaxation of laws forbidding military personnel from interacting with civilians. According to her, <b>black</b> <b>soldiers</b> treated native German children well, distributing food and clothing, but her parents generally met in secret due to racist remarks from others. In November 1946 her father returned to the US after an illness. By that time, both of them knew that her mother was pregnant, but she did not know he was leaving until after he was already gone. A year after Ika's birth, her mother married a German and a half-sister was born the following year. Her mother and grandmother loved her and treated her like any other child, despite social disapproval. She was close to her half-sister, but her step-father was distant toward her.|$|E

Having the requisite qualifications, Robinson and several other <b>black</b> <b>soldiers</b> applied for admission to an Officer Candidate School (OCS) then located at Fort Riley. Although the Army's initial July 1941 guidelines for OCS had been drafted as race neutral, few black applicants were admitted into OCS until after subsequent directives by Army leadership. As a result, the applications of Robinson and his colleagues were delayed for several months. After protests by heavyweight boxing champion Joe Louis (then stationed at Fort Riley) and the help of Truman Gibson (then an assistant civilian aide to the Secretary of War), the men were accepted into OCS. The experience led to a personal friendship between Robinson and Louis. Upon finishing OCS, Robinson was commissioned as a second lieutenant in January 1943. Shortly afterward, Robinson and Isum were formally engaged.|$|E
5|$|Proportional {{to white}} population, Southern Rhodesia had contributed more {{personnel}} to the British {{armed forces in}} World War I {{than any of the}} Empire's dominions or colonies, and more than Britain itself. About 40% of white males in the colony, 5,716 men, put on uniform, with 1,720 doing so as commissioned officers. Black Southern Rhodesians were represented by the 2,507 soldiers who made up the Rhodesia Native Regiment, the roughly 350 who joined the British East Africa Transport Corps, British South Africa Police Mobile Column and South African Native Labour Corps, and the few dozen black scouts who served with the 1st and 2nd Rhodesia Regiments in South-West and East Africa. Southern Rhodesians killed in action or on operational duty numbered over 800, counting all races together—more than 700 of the colony's white servicemen died, while the Rhodesia Native Regiment's <b>black</b> <b>soldiers</b> suffered 146 fatalities.|$|E
5|$|Rather than {{deploying}} Belgian troops {{against the}} mutineers as Janssens had wished, Lumumba dismissed him and renamed the Force Publique the Armée Nationale Congolaise (ANC).

At the same time, Joseph-Désiré Mobutu, an ex-sergeant-major and close personal aide of Lumumba, became Lundula's deputy as army chief of staff. The government attempted to stop the revolt—Lumumba and Kasa-Vubu intervened personally at Léopoldville and Thysville and persuaded the mutineers to lay down their arms—but in most of the country the mutiny intensified. White officers and civilians were attacked, white-owned properties were looted and white women were raped. The Belgian government became deeply concerned by the situation, particularly when white civilians began entering neighbouring countries as refugees.|$|E

40|$|<b>Black</b> <b>soldier</b> flies, Hermetia illucens (L.) (Diptera: Stratiomyidae), {{typically}} feed on decaying {{organic matter}} {{but have been}} explored as a possible means of alternate protein production, either for food for humans directly or as feed for animals that are raised for human food. If cultivation of these animals is to become as widespread and efficient as traditional livestock, processes for production {{of these and other}} insects must be refined. In this study, <b>black</b> <b>soldier</b> fly larvae were fed six different diets including the Gainesville diet (control), and five different mixtures of sorghum and cowpea. Effects on life history traits of the <b>black</b> <b>soldier</b> fly and nutritional content of prepupae were observed. <b>Black</b> <b>soldier</b> flies were able to successfully complete larval development on all tested diets. There were subtle but discernable differences in development rates based on diet, particularly the diets containing a higher percentage of sorghum. In general, larvae reared on the sorghum diets, which were lower in protein, developed slower (3 - 9 days longer from hatching to prepupal stage) than those on the cowpea diets, which were higher in protein. Diet treatment did not consistently influence size (weight or length) of prepupae. Diets did not influence lipid content in prepupae. Higher protein diets translated to higher protein content of prepupae in both trials. Lower protein diets resulted in higher gross energy content of prepupae in both trials. However, in addition to protein, lipid, vitamins, and minerals also differed between diet treatments. This study provides further evidence of the viability of <b>black</b> <b>soldier</b> flies for protein production...|$|R

5|$|Two calamities in {{the autumn}} of 1906 shocked African Americans, and they contributed to {{strengthening}} support for Du Bois's struggle for civil rights to prevail over Booker T.

Many of the discharged soldiers had served for 20 years and were near retirement. Second, in September, riots broke out in Atlanta, precipitated by unfounded allegations of black men assaulting white women. This was a catalyst for racial tensions based on a job shortage and employers playing black workers against white workers. Ten thousand whites rampaged through Atlanta, beating every black person they could find, resulting in over 25 deaths. In the aftermath of the 1906 violence, Du Bois urged blacks to withdraw their support from the Republican Party, because Republicans Roosevelt and William Howard Taft did not sufficiently support blacks. Most African Americans had been loyal to the Republican Party since the time of Abraham Lincoln.|$|E
