5|$|After the {{initiation}} of Operation Rolling Thunder, the sustained aerial campaign against North Vietnam that had begun on 5 March 1965, the <b>Barrel</b> <b>Roll</b> area of operations was divided on 3 April. <b>Barrel</b> <b>Roll</b> was {{to continue in the}} northeast while the southern portion of the area, where interdiction missions against the Ho Chi Minh trail were paramount, was redesignated Tiger Hound. Command and control of that area was handed over to the American commander in Saigon, General William C. Westmoreland.|$|E
5|$|Continuous U.S. {{air support}} for <b>Barrel</b> <b>Roll</b> {{operations}} {{was provided by}} the aircraft of the 602nd and 606th Special Operations Squadrons, elements of the 56th Air Commando Wing (as of 8 April 1967 the 56th Special Operations Wing), based at Nakhon Phanom Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand. On 25 October 1967, they were joined by the 22nd Special Operations Squadron. Pre-planned airstrikes in the <b>Barrel</b> <b>Roll</b> area were rare. Until 1968, most U.S. jet fighter-bomber sorties only occurred when aircraft were returning to Thailand from Rolling Thunder missions carrying unexpended ordnance loads. They would then be directed to targets in northeastern Laos.|$|E
5|$|An off-duty Northwest Airlines {{pilot who}} {{observed}} the crash told newspapers {{that he believed}} that the airliner had been struck by lightning. Some local farmers said that the plane seemed to <b>barrel</b> <b>roll,</b> but also observed that while rainfall was significant, winds were relatively light.|$|E

5|$|Systematic U.S. aerial {{operations}} against the Ho Chi Minh Trail had begun on 14 December 1964 with Operation <b>Barrel</b> <b>Roll.</b> With {{the onset of}} Operation Rolling Thunder, the strategic aerial bombardment of North Vietnam in April 1965, the U.S. also expanded its interdiction effort in Laos by dividing the <b>Barrel</b> <b>Roll</b> area into two sections on 3 April. The former operation would continue in northeastern Laos while Operation Steel Tiger was initiated in the southern panhandle. The American headquarters in Saigon requested, and received, authorization to control bombing in the area adjacent to South Vietnam's northern provinces in Operation Tiger Hound on 3 December 1965.|$|E
5|$|Operation <b>Barrel</b> <b>Roll</b> was a covert, Top Secret, U.S. Air Force 2nd Air Division (later the Seventh Air Force) and U.S. Navy Task Force 77, interdiction {{and close}} air support {{campaign}} conducted in the Kingdom of Laos between 14 December 1964 and 29 March 1973 concurrent with the Vietnam War.|$|E
5|$|Iron Rattler {{is located}} in the Western-themed Crackaxle Canyon area of Fiesta Texas, sitting next to the Road Runner Express and The Gully Washer. It is Rocky Mountain Construction's second {{installation}} of I-Box track, and the first to feature a <b>barrel</b> <b>roll</b> inversion. Iron Rattler operates with two Rattler-themed trains manufactured by Gerstlauer. Each train is made up of six cars which seat riders in two rows of two. Riders are restrained {{through the use of a}} lap bar and a seat belt.|$|E

The renovation would be performed by Rocky Mountain Construction and would feature the I-Box steel track on some of the original wooden coaster supports, Rattler-themed trains supplied by Gerstlauer, and a <b>barrel</b> <b>roll.</b> The new ride would open for the 2013 season.|$|E
5|$|To replace Lima Site 85, Vang Pao moved against Moung Son and Na Khang, where a {{new site}} was erected in July. During July and August, the Hmong forces were {{assisted}} by 742 U.S. airstrikes, while another 450 others were conducted throughout the <b>Barrel</b> <b>Roll</b> area. 1968 had {{proved to be}} {{a turning point in the}} conflict, with North Vietnamese forces displaying unprecedented determination in maintaining pressure against Royal forces, regardless of the weather cycles.|$|E
5|$|At a 29 March 1965 Southeast Asia Coordinating Committee {{meeting at}} Udon Thani, Thailand {{attended}} by Ambassador Sullivan, {{representatives from the}} 2nd Air Division, MACV, and Air America, responsibilities within the <b>Barrel</b> <b>Roll</b> operational area were ironed out. Command {{and control of the}} air program would remain in the ambassador's hands. Operational control of U.S. air assets devolved from the commander-in-chief, Pacific Forces (CINCPAC) in Honolulu through his air deputy at Pacific Air Forces or PACAF, to the 2nd Air Division (after 1 April 1966, the Seventh Air Force). Targets could be requested by the Royal Lao government, the CIA, or by MACV.|$|E

50|$|The {{fact that}} fewer {{supports}} are needed means steel roller coasters {{have made a}} large variety of features possible, such as loops, <b>barrel</b> <b>rolls,</b> corkscrews, zero-G rolls and beyond 90Â° drops.|$|R

5|$|For the U.S. Air Force, {{this success}} was {{achieved}} by conducting a shoestring operation, one that was fourth in priority for American air assets behind operations in South Vietnam, Operation Rolling Thunder, and Steel Tiger. After the close-out of aerial operations over North Vietnam, <b>Barrel</b> <b>Roll</b> still remained in last place. During its existence the campaign had utilized an average of only {{ten percent of the}} Air Force's tactical air effort in Southeast Asia. During the 1972 Nguyen Hue PAVN offensive, the number of airstrikes over northern Laos was reduced to only five percent of the total.|$|E
5|$|Northern Laos, however, was {{not going}} to be a {{priority}} for the Americans. It was decided at the Honolulu Executive Conference of April 1965 that U.S. aircraft could be used for interdiction in Laos only after close air support needs were met in South Vietnam. General Westmoreland was also granted veto power over bombing, interdiction, and reconnaissance programs outside territorial South Vietnam. That decision placed <b>Barrel</b> <b>Roll</b> behind South Vietnam, Rolling Thunder, and Steel Tiger in order of precedence. Only an estimated two percent of the total U.S. aerial effort in Southeast Asia was going to be utilized in northern Laos.|$|E
5|$|On 12 December 1964, <b>Barrel</b> <b>Roll</b> was {{approved}} by Souvanna Phouma. The program originally consisted of only two U.S bombing sorties per week that were to be conducted {{by no more than}} four aircraft in each strike. Due {{to the nature of the}} American agreement with the Thai government (most U.S. strike aircraft flew from bases in Thailand), the aircraft had to first fly to South Vietnam, land, and then take off again for Laos. By 24 December, six armed reconnaissance missions were being conducted per day, but the hoped for reaction from Hanoi did not materialize.|$|E
50|$|The {{race was}} marked by a {{grinding}} crash involving Rusty Wallace who was spun out by Michael Waltrip on the backstretch and sent Wallace {{on a series of}} horrific <b>barrel</b> <b>rolls</b> in the grass. He was uninjured although.|$|R
5000|$|In air combat maneuvering, {{historically}} {{known as}} dogfighting, the term [...] "barrel roll" [...] may refer {{to one of}} many maneuvers. These maneuvers are often simply called <b>barrel</b> <b>rolls,</b> but many fall {{into the category of}} [...] "displacement rolls." ...|$|R

5|$|The Ravens were {{volunteer}} Air Force {{officers who}} already had 500 flying hours (six months) as FACs in South Vietnam and who would serve six-month tours in Laos. There were {{always going to be}} shortages of both personnel and aircraft in the new program. Only six Ravens were assigned between 1966 and 1968 to control the ever-expanding amounts of U.S. airpower being utilized in Laos. Even {{at the height of the}} program, when they would control one-third to two-thirds of the tactical air strikes in the <b>Barrel</b> <b>Roll</b> area, there were never more than 22 Ravens.|$|E
5|$|The communists {{were not}} through with Phou Pha Thi. The {{combined}} TACAN/TSQ-81 site was, by January, controlling 55 percent of Rolling Thunder strikes in northern North Vietnam and 20 {{percent of the}} strikes in the <b>Barrel</b> <b>Roll</b> area. On 11 March, Lima Site 85 was struck by an attack spearheaded by the sappers of the 41st Dac Cong Battalion {{and supported by the}} 923rd PAVN Infantry Battalion and the site was quickly overrun. Five of the Air Force technicians manning the site managed to escape, but 11 more were never heard from again and were carried as missing in action.|$|E
5|$|Although airpower {{was to be}} a {{major factor}} in the defense of Lima Site 85, it could not be applied without {{limitations}} and restrictions. The defense of Lima Site 85 was not the sole focus of limited air resources at the time. During this period, the 1968 Tet Offensive was underway in South Vietnam, the Marine outpost at Khe Sanh was under siege, and there existed an unprecedented flow of enemy logistical traffic which had to be interdicted. Lima Site 85 had provided direction to about a quarter of the USAF missions over North Vietnam and <b>Barrel</b> <b>Roll</b> from November1967 to 11March1968. No other facility existed to provide a similar coverage over these areas. While this loss was a serious blow to the USAF air effort, it was not crippling.|$|E
5000|$|The Falcon LS {{features}} a 46 in wide cabin, a ballistic parachute, and wings {{that can be}} removed in 15 minutes for ground transport or storage.

25|$|Barnstormers {{performed}} {{a variety of}} stunts, with some specializing as stunt pilots or aerialists. Stunt pilots {{performed a}} variety of aerobatic maneuvers, including spins, dives, loop-the-loops and <b>barrel</b> <b>rolls,</b> while aerialists performed feats of wing walking, stunt parachuting, midair plane transfers, or even playing tennis, target shooting, and dancing on the plane's wings.|$|R
2500|$|DeLay was a {{constant}} aviation promoter through staging exhibitions (including barnstorming) and through performing aviation firsts for the movies. Some of his airshow expertise included the nose dive, ghost dive, Immelmann turn, <b>barrel</b> <b>rolls,</b> tail spins, multiple loop-the-loops, mock battles, racing, and flying fireworks. DeLay pioneered several aviation firsts for the motion pictures. (details in the next section) ...|$|R
5|$|<b>Barrel</b> <b>Roll</b> {{was one of}} {{the most}} closely held secrets and one of the most unknown {{components}} of the American military commitment in Southeast Asia. Due to the ostensible neutrality of Laos, guaranteed by the Geneva Conference of 1954 and 1962, both the U.S. and North Vietnam strove to maintain the secrecy of their operations and only slowly escalated military actions there. As much as both parties would have liked to have publicized their enemy's own alleged violation of the accords, both had more to gain by keeping their own roles quiet. Regardless, by the end of the conflict in 1975, Laos emerged from nine years of war just as devastated as any of the other Asian participants in the Vietnam War.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{withdrawal}} of U.S. forces under the policy of Vietnamization, from 1 November 1968 until 23 February 1973, <b>Barrel</b> <b>Roll</b> competed for a share of diminishing U.S tactical air assets. In December 1968, approximately 700 American strike aircraft had been available in-theater. By the spring of 1972, that number had fallen to 313. On 18 July, the Nakhon Phanom-based 22nd Special Operations Squadron was disbanded. Its sister squadron, the 602nd Special Operations Squadron, closed out on 20 December, leaving only the 1st Special Operations Squadron at Nakhon Phanom to support Royal Laotian ground operations. The RLAF attempted {{to make up for}} the diminishing number of American sorties. During 1968 the Laotians flew 10,000 strike sorties. During 1970 through 1972 that number increased to over 30,000 in each year.|$|E
5|$|The Victor {{has been}} {{described}} as an agile aircraft, atypical for a large bomber aircraft; in 1958, a Victor had performed several loops and a <b>barrel</b> <b>roll</b> during practices for a display flight at Farnborough Airshow. Manoeuvrability was greatly enabled by the light controls, quick response of the aircraft, and the design of certain flight surfaces such as the infinitely-variable tail-mounted airbrake. The Victor was designed for flight at high subsonic speeds, although multiple instances have occurred in which the sound barrier was broken. During development of the Victor B.2, the RAF had stressed the concept of tactical manoeuvrability, which led to much effort in development being given to increasing the aircraft's height and range performance.|$|E
50|$|Flock and Goldsmith both {{received}} {{serious injuries}} in the crash. Fonty Flock spun and slid to {{a stop on the}} backstretch. Bobby Myers slammed into him, immediately followed by Paul Goldsmith. The crash seriously injured Goldsmith, ended Flock's career, and killed Myers. He then flipped side over side and <b>barrel</b> <b>rolled.</b> Myers died from his Injuries.|$|R
50|$|Christopher Bell {{moved into}} the truck {{full-time}} for 2016. Bell {{was involved in a}} violent crash {{near the end of the}} season opener at Daytona. His truck gripped the track, causing the truck to go on two wheels before it launched into the air and <b>barrel</b> <b>rolled</b> multiple times. He was credited with a 16th-place finish.|$|R
50|$|After four months, Clapper {{began to}} train in {{twin-engine}} supersonic jets called the T-38 Talons. The T-38 had tandem seating, flew very fast, and was extremely maneuverable. Clapper learned to fly aerobatics, including loops, aileron <b>rolls,</b> Immelmans, and <b>barrel</b> <b>rolls</b> in the T-38. He also was trained and became qualified to fly under Instrument Flight Rules (IFR).|$|R
