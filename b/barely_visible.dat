5|$|Albrecht Goštautas (Olbracht Gasztołd), Chancellor of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and voivode of Vilnius, is <b>barely</b> <b>visible</b> in the {{top right}} of the painting. His {{presence}} in the painting is intended to symbolize {{the wisdom of the}} king as a legislator.|$|E
5|$|While the {{perianth}} may point forwards, in {{some species}} such as N. cyclamineus it is folded back (reflexed, see illustration, left), while in some other {{species such as}} N. bulbocodium (Table I), it is reduced to a few <b>barely</b> <b>visible</b> pointed segments with a prominent corona.|$|E
5|$|A small {{offering}} chapel is adjoining {{the eastern}} side of the main pyramid and is <b>barely</b> <b>visible</b> today. It consisted of a central two pillared room with a large quartzite false door and two narrow chambers on the sides. Like the mortuary temple, the chapel was floored with black basalt. Its walls however were made of Tura limestone and granite and were adorned with fine reliefs of offering scenes.|$|E

50|$|The bald parrot is a medium-small, overall green parrot with a bald, brownish-orange head. As {{several other}} members of the genus Pyrilia, it has red underwing coverts that <b>barely</b> are <b>visible</b> when perched, but highly {{conspicuous}} in flight.|$|R
50|$|ECOWAS was <b>barely</b> more <b>visible</b> in {{the second}} African Innovation Outlook, with just six {{countries}} contributing data {{on research and development}} out of 19 across the continent: Burkina Faso, Cabo Verde, Ghana, Mali, Senegal and Togo. Nigeria was totally absent and only Ghana and Senegal provided a full set of data for all four performance sectors.|$|R
5|$|Ganymede is {{composed}} primarily of silicate rock and water ice, and a salt-water ocean {{is believed to}} exist nearly 200km below Ganymede's surface, sandwiched between layers of ice. The metallic core of Ganymede suggests a greater heat {{at some time in}} its past than had previously been proposed. The surface is a mix of two types of terrain—highly cratered dark regions and younger, but still ancient, regions with a large array of grooves and ridges. Ganymede has a high number of craters, but many are gone or <b>barely</b> <b>visible</b> due to its icy crust forming over them. The satellite has a thin oxygen atmosphere that includes O, O2, and possibly O3 (ozone), and some atomic hydrogen.|$|E
5|$|The first curium {{samples were}} <b>barely</b> <b>visible,</b> and were {{identified}} by their radioactivity. Louis Werner and Isadore Perlman created the first substantial sample of 30µg curium-242 hydroxide at the University of California in 1947 by bombarding americium-241 with neutrons. Macroscopic amounts of curium(III) fluoride were obtained in 1950 by W. W. T. Crane, J. C. Wallmann and B. B. Cunningham. Its magnetic susceptibility {{was very close to}} that of GdF3 providing the first experimental evidence for the +3 valence of curium in its compounds. Curium metal was produced only in 1951 by reduction of CmF3 with barium.|$|E
5|$|The volcano has two {{fields of}} fumaroles (<) {{in the area}} between Uturunku's two summits and has caused {{hydrothermal}} alteration of country rock. These fumaroles form visible clouds of steam. This heat may have been replenished from the APVC melt generating zone or survived since the last eruption of the volcano. Fumarolic activity is distinct enough to be visible from ASTER satellite image but <b>barely</b> <b>visible</b> from the ground. The temperature of the hotspot has been relatively constant in contrast to Lascar. The presence of lava flows overlying moraines, which indicate post-glacial activity, is controversial; the summit lava flows have been glaciated.|$|E
50|$|Terrestrial solar eclipses, on {{the other}} hand, {{would not be as}} {{spectacular}} for lunar observers because the Moon's umbra nearly tapers out at the Earth's surface. A blurry dark patch would <b>barely</b> be <b>visible.</b> The effect would be comparable to the shadow of a golf ball cast by sunlight on an object 4.572 m away. Lunar observers with telescopes might be able to discern the umbral shadow as a black spot {{at the center of a}} less dark region (penumbra) traveling across the full Earth's disk.|$|R

60|$|Suddenly Granet's fingers {{dug into}} his shoulder. From {{out of that}} pall of velvet {{darkness}} which hung below the clouds, came for a single moment a vision of violet light. It rose apparently from nowhere, it passed away into space. It was <b>visible</b> <b>barely</b> for five seconds, then it had gone. Granet spoke with a little sob.|$|R
5|$|The {{discovery}} of americium and curium in 1944 was {{closely related to}} the Manhattan Project; the results were confidential and declassified only in 1945. Seaborg leaked the synthesis of the elements 95 and 96 on the U.S. radio show for children Quiz Kids five days before the official presentation at an American Chemical Society meeting on 11 November 1945, when one of the listeners asked whether any new transuranium element beside plutonium and neptunium had been discovered during the war. After the {{discovery of}} americium isotopes 241Am and 242Am, their production and compounds were patented listing only Seaborg as the inventor. The initial americium samples weighed a few micrograms; they were <b>barely</b> <b>visible</b> and were identified by their radioactivity. The first substantial amounts of metallic americium weighing 40–200 micrograms were not prepared until 1951 by reduction of americium(III) fluoride with barium metal in high vacuum at 1100°C.|$|E
5|$|The star HR 6958, {{also known}} as MV Serpentis, is an Alpha2 Canum Venaticorum {{variable}} that is faintly {{visible to the naked}} eye. The star's metal abundance is ten times higher than the Sun for most metals at the iron peak and up to 1,000 times more for heavier elements. It has also been found to contain excess silicon. <b>Barely</b> <b>visible</b> to the naked eye is HD 172365, a likely post-blue straggler in the open cluster IC 4756 that contains a large excess of lithium. HD 172189, also located in IC 4756, is an Algol variable eclipsing binary with a 5.70 day period. The primary star in the system is also a Delta Scuti variable, undergoing multiple pulsation frequencies, which, combined with the eclipses, causes the system to vary by around a tenth of a magnitude.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{original}} monuments in Jordan, and perhaps in the Hellenistic period in the Near East, is the village of Iraq Al-Amir in the valley of Wadi Al-Sir, southwest of Amman, which is home to Qasr Al-Abd (Castle of the Slave). Other nearby ruins include a village, an isolated house and a fountain, {{all of which are}} <b>barely</b> <b>visible</b> today due to the damage brought by a major earthquake that hit the region in the year 362. Qasr Al-Abd {{is believed to have been}} built by Hyrcanus of Jerusalem, who was the head of the powerful Tobiad family. Shortly after he began the construction of that large building, in 170 BC upon returning from a military campaign in Egypt, Antiochus IV conquered Jerusalem, ransacked a temple where the treasure of Hyrcanus was kept and appeared determined to attack Hyrcanus. Upon hearing this, Hyrcanus committed suicide, leaving his palace in Philadelphia uncompleted. The Tobiads fought the Arab Nabateans for twenty years until they lost the city to them. After losing Philadelphia, we no longer hear of the Tobiad family in written sources.|$|E
500|$|Built from Portland stone, the {{memorial}} is sited against the ramparts {{of the city}} walls. It consists of a single, [...] obelisk rising from a three-tiered pedestal set into the rear portion of a three-sided screen wall. The wall creates a recess, sheltering a Stone of Remembrance. The two flanking sides terminate with urn-shaped finials; the ends of each wall are decorated with a laurel wreath in relief carving; {{the inside of the}} walls is further decorated with laurel swags below the urns. The rear wall bears further relief swags to either side of the obelisk; the North Eastern Railway Company's coat of arms is engraved on the pedestal of the obelisk, just above the level of the screen wall, which is surrounded by another laurel wreath. The obelisk rises above the screen wall to a total height of [...] The Stone of Remembrance is a monolith in the shape of an altar, [...] long and curved so slightly as to <b>barely</b> be <b>visible</b> to the naked eye; it is deliberately devoid of any decoration besides the inscription [...] "THEIR NAME LIVETH FOR EVERMORE".|$|R
500|$|Two stone flags—painted in {{the form}} of the Union Flag and the flags of the Royal Navy (the White Ensign), Merchant Navy (the Red Ensign), and Royal Air Force (the RAF Ensign)—appear to hang from each obelisk, draping around the cornices; each flag is surmounted by gold wreaths. Lutyens first {{proposed}} stone flags for use on the Cenotaph on Whitehall, but the proposal was rejected in favour of fabric flags (though they were used on several other memorials, including Rochdale Cenotaph and the Arch of Remembrance in Leicester). The stone is a monolith (carved from a single piece of rock), curved so slightly as to <b>barely</b> be <b>visible</b> to the naked eye, [...] long and devoid of any decoration beyond the inscriptions. Unusually, the Stone of Remembrance is inscribed on both faces. The east face bears the inscription Lutyens chose for all his Stones of Remembrance: [...] "THEIR NAME LIVETH / FOR EVERMORE", as suggested by Rudyard Kipling, truncated from a verse in the Book of Ecclesiastes; the west face is inscribed [...] "THE SOULS OF THE RIGHTEOUS / ARE IN THE HANDS OF GOD", from The Wisdom of Solomon.|$|R

5|$|The {{skull of}} Nemegtomaia was deep, narrow, and short (compared {{to the rest}} of the body), and reached 179mm (7in) in length. It had a {{well-developed}} crest, formed by the nasal and premaxilla bones (mainly the latter) of the snout. The nearly vertical front margin of the crest formed an almost 90degree angle with the upper margin of the skull. Compared to other oviraptorids, the nasal processes (projections) of the premaxillae were <b>barely</b> <b>visible</b> when viewed from above (where they connected with the nasal bones on the highest points of the crest). The crest extended hindwards and down, forming a round arch at the highest point. The diameter of the orbit (eye opening) was 52mm (2in); the eyes looked large due to the shortness of the skull. The antorbital cavity in front of the eye consisted of two fenestrae (openings); a large antorbital fenestra at the back, and a small maxillary fenestra at the front. Nemegtomaia was distinct from other oviraptorids in that the frontal bone on the midline of the skull was about 25% the length of the parietal bone from front to back. The nares (external nostrils) were relatively small and placed high on the skull.|$|E

25|$|The {{condition}} of the frescoes is variable; some parts are well-preserved whilst others are missing completely, or <b>barely</b> <b>visible.</b> Much of the painted area has been pitted to provide a key for the subsequent plastering-over (see the lower area {{in the middle of}} the Presentation scene).|$|E
50|$|The {{underwater}} {{museum is}} {{to benefit the}} protection of the coral reefs. Artificial reefs are usually created by sunken ships and other objects that have fallen {{to the bottom of the}} ocean floor. The statues are a new technique and material for coral to grow on, a means for art to save the oceans. As the statues were made with pH-neutral cement, coral, seaweed, and algae are able to grow and develop better than on an old ship. Stable structures with a stable base are known to be ideal surfaces for artificial reefs. The statues also have holes in them, which allow marine wildlife to colonize and feed off the coral. Coral reefs will increase, but so will marine life. After only a short time under the water, the statues began to be transformed by nature. In time, all the statues will be covered and their figures will <b>barely</b> be <b>visible</b> The museum also benefits the community by attracting tourists. One local guide expressed concern to a reporter that the statues will themselves be damaged, but the museum is planned to grow and to repair itself.|$|R

60|$|A small torch or nut-candle {{which he}} lighted and {{set on a}} bracket on the wall gave out a faint {{flickering}} light, which <b>barely</b> rendered darkness <b>visible,</b> and from its position threw parts of the chamber into deepest gloom. It looked not unlike what we suppose would be the laboratory of an alchemist of the olden time, and McCoy himself, with his eager yet frowning visage, a native-made hat slouched over his brows, {{and a piece of}} native cloth thrown over his shoulders like a plaid, was no bad representative of an old doctor toiling for the secrets that turn base metal into gold, and old age into youth--secrets, by the way, which have been lying open to man's hand for centuries in the Word of God.|$|R
25|$|One of {{the faintest}} constellations {{in the night}} sky, Mensa boasts no bright stars. Its {{brightest}} star, Alpha Mensae is <b>barely</b> <b>visible</b> in suburban skies.

The long and slim limbs of Pliohippus reveal a quick-footed steppe animal.|$|E
5000|$|Manchester's war {{memorial}} is a cenotaph, {{flanked by}} twin obelisks, and a Stone of Remembrance, all in Portland stone on a raised coved platform. The memorial covers {{an area of}} approximately 93 ft by 53 ft. The cenotaph is 42 ft high made from 160 LT of Portland stone. The pylon is surmounted by a sculpture of an unknown soldier, partially covered by his greatcoat, lying on a catafalque. The pylon rises from the base in diminishing stages, narrowing as it rises. Below the catafalque, {{on the front and}} rear, are moulded swords and imperial crowns, and to the sides are Manchester's coat of arms surrounded by laurel wreaths. The cenotaph bears inscriptions below the coat of arms: [...] "TO THE HONOURED MEMORY OF THOSE WHO GAVE THEIR LIVES FOR THEIR COUNTRY" [...] (on the north-west side) and [...] "O LORD GOD OF OUR FATHERS KEEP THIS/FOREVER IN THE IMAGINATION OF THE THOUGHTS OF THE HEART OF THY PEOPLE" [...] (on the south east). Identical, 23 ft high obelisks stand either side of the cenotaph and the Stone of Remembrance is set in front. The stone, a monolith in the shape of an altar, is 12 ft long and curved so slightly as to <b>barely</b> be <b>visible</b> (entasis); it is devoid of decoration and inscribed, [...] "THEIR NAME LIVETH FOR EVERMORE".|$|R
6000|$|Human art {{could have}} done no more in the {{delineation}} of her superhuman beauty. The same ethereal figure which stood before me the preceding night upon {{the steps of the}} Ducal Palace, stood before me once again. But in the expression of the countenance, which was beaming all over with smiles, there still lurked (incomprehensible anomaly!) that fitful stain of melancholy which will ever be found inseparable from the perfection of the beautiful. Her right arm lay folded over her bosom. With her left she pointed downward to a curiously fashioned vase. One small, fairy foot, alone <b>visible,</b> <b>barely</b> touched the earth; and, scarcely discernible in the brilliant atmosphere which seemed to encircle and enshrine her loveliness, floated a pair of the most delicately imagined wings. My glance fell from the painting to the figure of my friend, and the vigorous words of Chapman's Bussy D'Ambois, quivered instinctively upon my lips: ...|$|R
60|$|These {{people are}} very fond of music and dancing, and it would astonish a European to visit one of their assemblies. We enter a gloomy palm-leaf hut, in which two or three very dim lamps <b>barely</b> render {{darkness}} <b>visible.</b> The floor is of black sandy earth, the roof hid in a smoky impenetrable blackness; two or three benches stand against the walls, and the orchestra consists of a fiddle, a fife, a drum, and a triangle. There is plenty of company, consisting {{of young men and}} women, all very neatly dressed in white and black--a true Portuguese habit. Quadrilles, waltzes, polkas, and mazurkas are danced with great vigour and much skill. The refreshments are muddy coffee and a few sweetmeats. Dancing is kept up for hours, and all is conducted with much decorum and propriety. A party of this kind meets about once a week, the principal inhabitants taking it by turns, and all who please come in without much ceremony.|$|R
25|$|Despite {{the recent}} gains, investors remain wary of making {{placements}} in second-tier {{initial public offerings}} (IPOs). Purchasers of new issues were disappointed after prices fell in numerous medium-sized companies that made offerings in 1996 and 1997. IPO activity in Mexico remains tepid and the market for second-tier IPOs is <b>barely</b> <b>visible.</b> There were three IPOs in 2005.|$|E
25|$|Mini in canal (MIC) or {{completely}} in canal (CIC) aids {{are generally not}} visible unless the viewer looks directly into the wearer's ear. These aids are intended for mild to moderately severe losses. CICs are usually not recommended for people with good low-frequency hearing, as the occlusion effect is much more noticeable. Completely-in-the-canal hearing aids fit tightly deep in the ear. It <b>barely</b> <b>visible.</b> Being small, it {{will not have a}} directional microphone, and its small batteries will have a short life, and the batteries and controls may be difficult to manage. Its position in the ear prevents wind noise and makes it easier to use phones without feedback. In-the-canal hearing aids are placed deep in the ear canal. They are <b>barely</b> <b>visible.</b> Larger versions of these can have directional microphones. Being in the canal, {{they are less likely to}} cause a plugged feeling. These models are easier to manipulate than the smaller completely in-the-canal models but still have the drawbacks of being rather small.|$|E
25|$|The {{house is}} built on a steep {{hillside}} in the Hollywood Hills {{at a time when}} the hills did not have the rich foliage present today. At the time of its construction, Storer House is said to have resembled a Pompeiian villa.

5000|$|On every {{screen that}} {{actually}} provided 72 PPI, each graphical element (such {{as a character}} of text) would be rendered at a size [...] larger than it [...] "should" [...] be, thereby allowing a person to sit a comfortable distance from the screen. However, larger graphical elements meant less screen space was available for programs to draw; indeed, although the default 720-pixel wide mode of a Hercules mono graphics adaptor (the one-time gold standard for high resolution PC graphics) - or a [...] "tweaked" [...] VGA adaptor - provided an apparent 7.5-inch page width at this resolution, the more common and color-capable display adaptors of the time all provided a 640-pixel wide image in their high resolution modes, enough for a bare 6.67 inches at 100% zoom (and <b>barely</b> any greater <b>visible</b> page height - a maximum of 5 inches, versus 4.75). Consequently, the default margins in Microsoft Word were set, and still remain at 1 full inch {{on all sides of}} the page, keeping the [...] "text width" [...] for standard size printer paper within visible limits; despite most computer monitors now being both larger and finer-pitched, and printer paper transports having become more sophisticated, the Mac-standard half-inch borders remain listed in Word 2010's page layout presets as the [...] "narrow" [...] option (versus the 1-inch default).|$|R
25|$|In AD 81 the Senate built {{a triple}} arch honoring Titus at the {{semi-circular}} {{end of the}} Circus, to replace or augment a former processional entrance. The emperor Domitian built a new, multi-storey palace on the Palatine, connected somehow to the Circus; he likely watched the games in autocratic style, from high above and <b>barely</b> <b>visible</b> to those below.
