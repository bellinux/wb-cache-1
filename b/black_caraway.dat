Forty white male albino rats of the Winster strain weighing between 125 and 215 g were used. Diabetes was induced in the experimental rats with alloxan (70 mg kg - 1) body weight. Five rats were randomly assigned into each group (Group I - VIII). Group I rats served as the normal control, Group II served as the caraway control, whereas, Group III rats served as the diabetic control. Groups IV to VIII were the test groups. The test group rats were administered different doses of the <b>black</b> <b>caraway</b> oil thus; 5, 10, 20, 40 and 80 mg kg - 1 body weight, respectively. The experiment lasted {{for a period of}} 10 weeks. The blood glucose and serum creatinine levels in the different groups were assayed. There was a statistically significant increase (p< 0. 0001) in the levels of blood glucose and serum creatinine in the diabetic control (Group III). These levels were significantly reduced by the administration of 10 mg kg - 1 wet weight of the <b>black</b> <b>caraway</b> oil group (Group V) compared to the diabetic control (Group III) and the other treatment groups (Groups IV, VI-VIII).

40|$|This study {{determined}} antioxidant {{effects and}} sensory attributes of individual ingredients (<b>black</b> pepper, <b>caraway,</b> cardamom, chili powder, cinnamon, cloves, coriander, cumin, fennel, ginger, nutmeg, salt, star anise) of an Indian spice blend (garam masala) in cooked ground beef. Thiobarbituric acid (TBA) values were measured {{as an indicator}} of rancidity for cooked samples on 1 -, 8 -, or 15 -d refrigerated storage. Cooked samples were evaluated by a trained panel (n= 13) for the intensity of rancid odor/flavor, beef flavor, and spice flavor and correlated with TBA values of same day samples. We also investigated possible additive effects between spice antioxidants and iron binding (type II) antioxidants on lipid oxidation by measuring TBA values. All spices had antioxidant effects on cooked ground beef, compared to controls. Among spices, cloves were the most effective in controlling lipid oxidation, with TBA values of 0. 75, after 15 -d refrigerated storage. All spices at their recommended levels lowered rancid odor and flavor in cooked ground beef, compared to controls. As expected, most spices also imparted distinctive flavors to cooked ground beef. There was a positive correlation (0. 77) between TBA values on 15 -d refrigerated storage and rancid odor/flavor. Type II antioxidants (iron-binding phosphate compounds) were more effective than individual type I antioxidants (spices and butylated hydroxytoluene; BHT) for maintenance of low TBA values in cooked ground beef during storage. Additive effects were observed with rosemary + milk mineral or sodium tripolyphosphate (STP) compared to rosemary alone...|$|R

Forty white male albino rats of the winster strain weighing between 125 - 215 g were used. They were divided into eight groups. Diabetes was induced in the experimental rats with alloxan (70 mg kg - 1 body weight). Group 1 rats served as the normal control, group II served as the caraway control whereas group III served as the diabetic control. Groups IV to VIII were the test groups. They were administered various doses of caraway oil ranging from 5, 10, 20, 40 and 80 mg kg - 1 body weight respectively. The experiment lasted {{for a period of}} 10 weeks. The following liver enzymes were assayed: Aspartate Amino Transferase (ASAT), Alanine Amino Transferase (ALAT) and alkaline phosphatase. Histopathology was also done for the liver.

40|$|Background: Exposure to {{environmental}} toxins such as organophosphates poses a great {{threat to the}} health of the public. In this work, we investigated the effects of continuous exposure to dichlorvos (DDVP) on kidney function and hematological parameters, and the possible antidote activity of Nigella sativa oil (NSO). Methods: This research was conducted in 2016, at The Animal Holding and Research Laboratory of Faculty Basic Medical Sciences, University of Ilorin, Ilorin, Nigeria. Twenty-four Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups, six rats each. The four groups received: 1. phosphate buffer solution as controls, 2. DDVP, 3. DDVP+NSO and 4. NSO alone. After 2 wk of treatment, blood samples were collected and hematological profile (RBC, Hb), erythrocyte indices (MCV, MCH, MCHC, and Plt), renal function parameters (albumin, urea, total protein, chloride, sodium, and potassium ions) and nonspecific immune response (WBC) were measured. Results: Rat exposed to DDVP showed red blood cell count, hemoglobin, packed cell volume, albumin, and total protein levels was reduced from control, while white blood cell count and urea significantly increased as compared to controls, the change in K+ level was not significant. NSO maintained optimal levels of red blood cell count, hemoglobin, packed cell volume, albumin, white blood cell count, and urea, indicative of its protective effect against hemo-, immuno- and nephrotoxicity of DDVP. Conclusion: N. sativa (<b>Black</b> <b>Caraway)</b> oil might be a potential antidote in hematotoxicity, immunosuppression and renal dysfunction in organophosphate poisoning, especially dichlorvos. The protective effect of NSO against dichlorvos toxicity can be attributed to its antioxidant capacity. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{study shows}} {{the effects of}} spices, and their {{phenolic}} and flavonoid compounds, on prostate cell lines (PNT 1 A, 22 RV 1 and PC 3). The results of an MTT assay on extracts from eight spices revealed the strongest inhibitory effects were from <b>black</b> pepper and <b>caraway</b> seed extracts. The strongest inhibitory effect on prostatic cells was observed after the application of extracts of spices in concentration of 12. 5 mg·mL 1. An LC/MS analysis identified that the most abundant phenolic and flavonoid compounds in black pepper are 3, 4 -dihydroxybenzaldehyde and naringenin chalcone, while the most abundant phenolic and flavonoid compounds in caraway seeds are neochlorogenic acid and apigenin. Using an MTT assay for the phenolic and flavonoid compounds from spices, we identified the IC 50 value of ~ 1 mmol·L 1 PNT 1 A. The scratch test demonstrated that the most potent inhibitory effect on PNT 1 A, 22 RV 1 and PC 3 cells is from the naringenin chalcone contained in black pepper.

40|$|Abstract Background Thymoquinone (TQ) is a {{compound}} extracted from <b>Black</b> <b>Caraway</b> seeds of Nigella Sativa and is active against various cancers. Cisplatin (CDDP) {{is the most}} active chemotherapeutic agent in Lung Cancer. Here we report activity of TQ against {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell lines alone and in combination with Cisplatin (CDDP). Methods For proliferation MTT assay, cell viability trypan blue assay and for apoptosis Annexin-V FITC assay were used in NCI-H 460 and NCI-H 146 cell lines. Inhibition of invasion by TQ was assessed using Matrigel assay and its affect on release of various cytokines was determined using RayBio Human Cytokine detection kit. Mouse xenograft model using NCI-H 460 was used to determine in vivo activity of TQ and CDDP. Inhibition of LPS induced NF-κB expression by TQ was determined using transgenic mice expressing a luciferase reporter. Results TQ was able to inhibit cell proliferation, reduce cell viability and induce apoptosis. TQ at 100 μM and CDDP at 5 μM inhibited cell proliferation by nearly 90 % and the combination showed synergism. TQ was able to induced apoptosis in both NCI-H 460 and NCI-H 146 cell lines. TQ also appears to affect the extracellular environment inhibiting invasion and reducing the production of two cytokines ENA- 78 and Gro-alpha which are involved in neo-angiogenesis. Using a mouse xenograft model we were able to demonstrate that combination of TQ and CDDP was well tolerated and significantly reduced tumor volume and tumor weight without additional toxicity to the mice. In the combination arms (TQ 5 mg/kg/Cis 2. 5 mg/kg) tumor volume was reduced by 59 % and (TQ 20 mg/kg/Cis 2. 5 mg/kg) by 79 % as compared to control which is consistent with in vitro data. TQ down regulated NF-κB expression which may explain its various cellular activities and this activity may prove useful in overcoming CDDP resistance from over expression of NF-κB. Conclusions Thus TQ and CDDP appear to be an active therapeutic combination in lung cancer. </p...|$|E
