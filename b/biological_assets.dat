On the other hand, the outlook of international accounting standards is also outlined, seeing the animals as a <b>biological</b> <b>asset</b> with regard to their specific qualities.

As {{one of the}} most widely-used energy resources worldwide, natural gas has a large daily trading volume. In order to hedge the risk of natural gas spot markets, a large number of hedging strategies can be used, especially with the rapid development of natural gas derivatives markets. These hedging instruments include natural gas futures and options, as well as Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) prices that are related to natural gas stock prices. The volatility spillover effect is the delayed effect of a returns shock in one physical, <b>biological</b> or financial <b>asset</b> on the subsequent volatility or co-volatility of another physical, <b>biological</b> or financial <b>asset.</b> Investigating volatility spillovers within and across energy and financial markets is a crucial aspect of constructing optimal dynamic hedging strategies.

The objects of this research are all agricultural companies listed in BEI which are divided into 4 sub-sectors: Plantations, Food Crops, Fishery, and Other Sub-sector. From this research, it is known that PT Provident Agro Tbk is the only company that uses the fair value method for the biological assets; whereas all the other companies chose to use cost method for their various <b>biological</b> <b>assets.</b> However, besides PT Provident Agro, there are 4 other companies which already try to determine the fair value of the <b>biological</b> <b>assets</b> though the <b>biological</b> <b>assets</b> are still recorded at costs in the financial statement. The biggest challenge in applying IAS 41 in Indonesia is the inexistence of the active market which makes it difficult for the Company to determine the appropriate fair value. As a result, the service of independent appraisers is needed to determine the fair value. Using independent appraisers will create costs for the companies and thus, they perceive the costs of determining the biological assets’ fair value are bigger than the benefit. Moreover, since the other companies do not use the fair value, they do not feel the urgency to apply the fair value method as well...|$|E

Within the project, the specific impacts of feral camels on waterholes were assessed throughout the KPALT. We found that aquatic macroinvertebrate biodiversity was significantly lower at camel-accessible sites, and fewer aquatic taxa considered 'sensitive' to habitat degradation were found at sites when or after camels were present. Water quality at camel-accessible sites was also significantly poorer (e. g. more turbid) than at sites inaccessible to camels. These results, in combination with emerging research and anecdotal evidence, suggest that large feral herbivores, such as feral camels and feral horses, are the main immediate threat to many waterbodies in central Australia. Management of large feral herbivores will be a key component in efforts to maintain and improve the health of waterbodies in central Australia, especially those not afforded protection within the national park system...|$|R
40|$|This paper uses panel {{data from}} Bangladesh, Ethiopia, and Malawi {{to examine the}} impacts of {{disasters}} on dynamic human capital production. Our empirical results show that accumulation of biological human capital prior to a disaster helps children maintain investments during the post-disaster period. Biological human capital formed in early childhood (for example, good long-term nutritional status) helps insure resilience to disasters by protecting schooling investments and outcomes, even though disasters have negative impacts on the actual investments (for example, by destroying schools). In Bangladesh, children with more biological human capital are less adversely affected by flood, {{and the rate of}} investment increases with the initial human capital stock during the post-disaster recovery process. In Ethiopia and Malawi, where droughts are relatively frequent, repeated drought exposure reduces schooling investments in some cases, with larger negative impacts seen among children who embody less <b>biological</b> human capital. <b>Asset</b> holdings prior to disaster (especially intellectual human capital stock in the household) also help maintain schooling investments to at least the same degree as the stock of human capital accumulated in the children prior to the disaster. Our results suggest that as the frequency of natural disasters increases due to global warming, the insurance value of investments in child nutrition will increase. Public investments in child nutrition therefore have the potential to effectively protect long-term human capital formation among children who are vulnerable to natural disasters.

The following modern forms of chemical safety in the Russian Federation were considered: state reserve’s system, target program financing, state social insurance. The separate issue tackles the obligatory civil liability insurance for owners of dangerous objects. For improvement of the existing insurance protection system against emergency situations, risks were analyzed (shared on exogenous and endogenous). Among the exogenous risks including natural and climatic conditions of a region, its geographical arrangement, economic specialization, the seismic and terrorist risks were chosen and approaches to its solution were suggested. In endogenous risks’ group, the special focus is on wear and tear and obsolescence of hazardous chemical and <b>biological</b> object’s fixed <b>assets.</b> In case of high risk of an incident, it is suggested to increase in extent of insurance protection through self-insurance, a mutual insurance {{in the form of}} the organization of societies of a mutual insurance or the self-regulating organizations, and also development of voluntary insurance of a civil liability, both the owner of hazardous object, and regions of the Russian Federation and municipalities.
