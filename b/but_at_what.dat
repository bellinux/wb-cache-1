25|$|Burges was {{descended from}} the Burges or Bruges family of Batcombe, Somerset, was {{probably}} born in 1589. He was a son of Robert Burges (d. 1626) of Stanton Drew, Somerset and Alice Benbrick. Burges had brothers James and John, who remained at Stanton Drew, and a sister Hester who married Samuel Sherman of Dedham, Essex. In 1611 he was entered at Oxford, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> college is unknown. He was transferred to Wadham College, Oxford, and graduated B.A. on 5 July 1615, and thence migrated to Lincoln College, Oxford, {{of which he was}} a member when he graduated M.A. on 20 April 1618. He must have taken orders before graduation, if it be true that on 21 Dec. 1613 he obtained the vicarage of Watford, Hertfordshire, on the presentation of Sir Charles Morison. On 16 Jan. 1626 he was allowed to hold, along with Watford, the rectory of St. Magnus, London Bridge. This latter he resigned in 1641, his successor being admitted on 20 July. Soon after the accession of Charles I he was made one of the king's chaplains in ordinary, and on 16 June 1627 he was made B.D. and D.D. by his university.|$|E

But {{now there is no}} {{bitterness}} in my thought of him, only a great sadness for all that has been... he succeeded in his quest and gained his objective, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> a cost and with what a difference from what he had imagined." [...] Jinnah was buried on 12 September 1948 amid official mourning in both India and Pakistan; a million people gathered for his funeral. Indian Governor-General Rajagopalachari cancelled an official reception that day in honour of the late leader. Today, Jinnah rests in a large marble mausoleum, Mazar-e-Quaid, in Karachi.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, the {{decision}} to extend an amnesty to the mutineer sailors engendered much criticism from Brazil's upper classes. As historian Zachary Morgan put it, [...] "for the elite, {{the intention of the}} naval renovation itself was to fix their institution, propelling Brazil to the front of a South American arms race, and to make their navy competitive with that of any Western nation. Instead, enlisted men had used those very ships to humiliate the naval elite. The ships were saved, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> cost?" [...] These sailors were given shore leave on the day the revolt ended (26 November). In the next days, the ships were disarmed to prevent a recurrence of events, and the rebels were discharged from the navy as threats to the service's discipline—nearly 1,300 of them, a drop so drastic that the Brazilian Navy was forced to pay for Portuguese merchant crewmen to fill the gaps. The government later claimed that over 1,000 of the dismissed sailors were given tickets to their home states {{to get them out of}} the capital.|$|E
500|$|In July 1938, White {{represented}} Australia at an inter-governmental {{conference on}} Jewish refugees held at Évian, France, {{to discuss the}} growing numbers of Jewish emigrants seeking to leave Germany and occupied territories. [...] He expressed remorse after listening to stories from refugees during the conference, but ultimately hedged his offer of support, saying that, [...] "As we have no real racial problem, we are not desirous of importing one by encouraging any scheme of large-scale foreign migration". [...] Australia {{would go on to}} accept 15,000 refugees over three years. White's reaction to the Australian government's support for the Munich Agreement was to diarise: [...] "I think we should hang our heads that we did not stand up to the bully of Europe... It may yet mean peace <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> price?" [...] He called for stronger preparations at home in case of war, including the introduction of conscription. On 8November 1938, he resigned his portfolio, having discovered that Joseph Lyons had established an inner cabinet from which he was excluded. Lyons' response in parliament to White's resignation publicly highlighted the divisions in the UAP. White stood for the UAP's leadership after Lyons' death the following year but was eliminated early in the balloting, and Robert Menzies eventually became leader.|$|E

2500|$|Tall (6ft 2½ in; 189cm), lanky and handsome, Scott {{displayed}} an easygoing {{charm and}} courtly Southern drawl {{in his early}} films that helped offset his limitations as an actor, where he was frequently found to be stiff or [...] "lumbering". As he matured, however, Scott's acting improved while his features became burnished and leathery, turning him into the ideal [...] "strong, silent" [...] type of stoic hero. The BFI Companion to the Western noted:In his earlier Westerns... the Scott persona is debonair, easy-going, graceful, though with the necessary hint of steel. As he matures into his fifties his roles change. Increasingly Scott becomes {{the man who has}} seen it all, who has suffered pain, loss, and hardship, and who has now achieved (<b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> cost?) a stoic calm proof against vicissitude.|$|E

40|$|Most interpreters {{think that}} for Leibniz, {{teleology}} is goodness-directedness. Explaining a monadic action teleologically, according to them, simply means explaining {{it in terms of}} the goodness of the state at which the agent aims. On some interpretations, the goodness at issue is always apparent goodness: an action is end-directed iff it aims <b>at</b> <b>what</b> appears good to the agent. On other interpretations, the goodness at issue is only sometimes apparent goodness and at other times merely objective goodness: some actions do not aim <b>at</b> <b>what</b> appears good to the agent, <b>but</b> merely <b>at</b> <b>what</b> is objectively good—that is, <b>at</b> <b>what</b> God knows to be good—and that is sufficient for teleology. My paper, on the other hand, argues that both of these interpretations are mistaken. Monadic teleology, I contend, does not have to consist in striving for the good; neither goodness nor God is required to make monadic actions teleological...|$|R
