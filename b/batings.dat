50|$|Baku {{massacre}} survivor Emma Bagdasarova (currently US citizen) {{gave the}} following account:When the <b>batings</b> began, my cousin was beaten on a tram. They tied {{his both hands}} to the railings and began to beat. When he called us, we came home, he was half dead... He was all bandaged. The police did nothing, as I knew they were even helping with the beating... Soon we got a call and {{were told that they}} would come to kill us at night.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{examines}} the circumstances {{which led to}} the collapse of <b>Batings</b> Plc at the end of February 1995. The analysis is based upon two official reports of investigations in London and Singapore. Annual reports and financial statements of <b>Batings</b> are also drawn upon. Each of the official reports is examined critically for an understanding of activities within Barings and the conduct of markets. Monitoring and supervision are scrutinised. The implications of the collapse are treated in terms of operational risk, corporate governance {{and the role of the}} supervisory authorities with the last-mentioned bearing also upon international co-operation. ...|$|E

40|$|Credit {{ratings have}} contributed to the current {{financial}} crisis. Proposals to regulate credit rating agencies focus on micro-prudential issues and aim at reducing conflicts of interest and increasing transparency and competition. In contrast, this paper argues that macro-prudential regulation is necessary to address the systemic risk inherent to ratings. The paper illustrates how financial markets have increasingly relied on ratings. It shows how downgrades have led to systemic market losses and increased illiquidity. The paper suggests the use of <b>‘ratings</b> maps’ and stress-tests to assess the systemic risk of ratings, and increased capital or liquidity buffers to manage such risk. ...|$|R
40|$|In banking, {{economic}} capital is {{commonly referred to}} as the level of capital a financial institution needs to hold in order to achieve or maintain its target external credit rating. From a risk management perspective, pricing loan assets based on {{economic capital}} is preferred to regulatory capital for its ability to better capture the unique risks and cash flows associated with an exposure. Using a loan pricing model based on economic capital we examine the impact of ratings on loan price and show how financial institutions can engage in <b>'ratings</b> arbitrage' to target higher external credit ratings without having to increase capital levels by manipulating loss given default data. The potential implications for regulatory authorities of such arbitrage are also discussed. Economic capital Loan pricing Loss given default Ratings arbitrage...|$|R
40|$|Media ratings {{systems have}} {{provided}} an economic foundation for advertiser-supported media. Consequently, {{the nature of}} the audience measurement process affects the structure and behaviour of media companies and regulators alike. So when the techniques and technologies of the ratings change, these changes can have ‘a significant effect on the economics of media industries (because these changes can affect advertiser behaviour), the relative economic health of various segments of the media industry, and {{the nature of the}} content that media organizations provide’ (Napoli, 2003 : p. 65). Although changes to the <b>‘ratings</b> convention’ governing audience measurement can be disruptive, these changes are driven by the inevitable gap between the measured audience and the actual audience for a service or programmes. With the advent of a more diverse and fragmented media environment and audience groups increasingly demographically defined, this gap has become even more evident, with the validity of ratings as currency for buying and selling media being challenged in the United States. Napoli (2003) suggests that this is leading to a decline in quality and value of the ‘audience product’ – data on who is watching when – because of changes in technology and audiences. The provision of reliable thirdparty syndicated and customized audience measurement technology for the production of ratings, however, remains essential to good media management nationally and internationally...|$|R
