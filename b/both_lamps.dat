40|$|BACKGROUND: Buruli ulcer (BU) {{caused by}} Mycobacterium ulcerans (M. ulcerans) {{has emerged as}} an {{important}} public health problem in several rural communities in sub-Saharan Africa. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment are important in preventing disfiguring complications associated with late stages of the disease progression. Presently there is no simple and rapid test that is appropriate for early diagnosis and use in the low-resource settings where M. ulcerans is most prevalent. METHODOLOGY: We compared conventional and pocket warmer loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) methods (using a heat block and a pocket warmer respectively as heat source for amplification reaction) {{for the detection of}} M. ulcerans in clinical specimens. The effect of purified and crude DNA preparations on the detection rate of the LAMP assays were also investigated and compared with that of IS 2404 PCR, a reference assay for the detection of M. ulcerans. Thirty clinical specimens from suspected BU cases were examined by LAMP and IS 2404 PCR. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The lower detection limit of <b>both</b> <b>LAMP</b> methods at 60 °C was 300 copies of IS 2404 and 30 copies of IS 2404 for the conventional LAMP at 65 °C. When purified DNA extracts were used, <b>both</b> the conventional <b>LAMP</b> and IS 2404 PCR concordantly detected 21 positive cases, while the pocket warmer LAMP detected 19 cases. Nine of 30 samples were positive by <b>both</b> the <b>LAMP</b> assays as well as IS 2404 PCR when crude extracts of clinical specimens were used. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: The LAMP method {{can be used as a}} simple and rapid test for the detection of M. ulcerans in clinical specimens. However, obtaining purified DNA, as well as generating isothermal conditions, remains a major challenge for the use of the LAMP method under field conditions.

40|$|BackgroundPorcine circovirus type 2 (PCV 2) {{is one of}} {{the major}} swine viral {{diseases}} and has caused significant economic loss to pig producers. PCV 2 has been divided into two major genotypes: PCV 2 a, PCV 2 b. A loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method was developed for the detection and differentiation of PCV 2 a and PCV 2 b in clinical samples. MethodsLAMP-specific primer sets were designed based on six PCV 2 a and six PCV 2 b reference isolates. To determine the analytical specificity of LAMP, DNA samples extracted from 36 porcine virus isolates were tested by LAMP, including eight PCV 2 a, 11 PCV 2 b, four PCV type 1, two porcine parvovirus, three pseudorabies virus, and eight porcine reproductive and respiratory virus. To evaluate the analytical sensitivity of the assay, 10 -fold serial dilutions of PCV 2 a and PCV 2 b recombinant plasmids were performed to prepare the dilutions at concentration from 106 to 1 copy(ies) /μL, and each dilution was tested by <b>both</b> <b>LAMP</b> and nested polymerase chain reaction (nested PCR). A total of 168 clinical samples were analyzed by <b>both</b> <b>LAMP</b> and nested PCR, and the relative sensitivity and specificity of LAMP compared to nested PCR were calculated. ResultsUsing different primer sets of LAMP, LAMP could be completed within 50 minutes. This method was found to be highly analytically specific for PCV 2 a and PCV 2 b; only the target gene was detected without cross-reaction. The analytical sensitivity of LAMP for PCV 2 a and PCV 2 b were 10 copies/μL, demonstrating analytical sensitivity comparable to that obtained using nested PCR. In addition, the sensitivity and specificity of LAMP relative to those of nested PCR were 97. 7 % and 100. 0 %, respectively. The percentage of observed agreement was 98. 2 %, and the κ statistic was 0. 949.

40|$|August 2004 "Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 18 - 20) This analytical study {{evaluated the}} advantages and disadvantages of several curvelighting strategies that involved moving one or both low beams by various amounts. Two curve radii were examined (80 m and 240 m) for both curve directions (left and right). Recent market-weighted median U. S. and ECE tungsten-halogen low beam patterns, and a recent median U. S. HID beam pattern were used. Seven lateral positions were of interest, corresponding to the lane of travel and the left adjacent lane, and additional lanes of travel to the left and right or off-road objects. The dependent variable was the maximum distance of 3 -lux illumination (combined from <b>both</b> <b>lamps)</b> at a plane 0. 25 m above the roadway. The main findings for the short-radius curves were: (1) All of the examined curvelighting strategies tended to perform substantially better than the nominal aim. (2) The improved performance for given lateral positions in the visual field tended not to be coupled with worsened performance for other lateral positions of interest. (3) The differences among the curve-lighting strategies were small. (4) The best strategy involved moving <b>both</b> <b>lamps</b> in parallel by 15 ° into the curve. The main findings for the large-radius curves were: (1) The best strategy depended on the curve direction, beam pattern, and lateral position in the visual field. (2) There were performance trade-offs between left and right lateral positions (especially for the right curve), with improvements in one lateral area generally being paired with decrements in the other. In conclusion, for short-radius left and right curves, moving <b>both</b> <b>lamps</b> in parallel should substantially increase the visibility of objects in one’s lane of travel, in several additional lanes of travel to the left and right, and off the road. Thus, implementing such a curve-lighting strategy is recommended for small-radius curves. On the other hand, because of the lateral trade-offs of benefits and costs for large-radius curves, additional research is needed to better understand the desirable approach for these types of curves. Finally, because of the inherent lateral asymmetry of low beams, future research should also further explore the benefits of asymmetric shifts for left and right curves...|$|E

Materials and Methods: We compared loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) with microscopy, non-nutrient agar (NNA) culture and {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR) in clinical suspects of AK. Results: Of 52 clinical samples (42 AK suspects and 10 proven bacterial, viral or fungal keratitis), 3 were positive by direct microscopy (sensitivity 60 %, confidence interval [CI]: 17 %– 92. 7 %), and 5 by NNA culture, 18 S rDNA PCR and LAMP (sensitivity 100 %, CI: 46. 3 %– 100 %).

The range of sizes {{for each of the}} species were as follows: silver salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), 31 - 267 mm; chinook (O. tshawytscha), 35 - 168 mm; sockeye (O.

Electric lamps were placed over and adjacent to the two ends of an aquarium with a glass front. Three minutes after a group of fish had been put in the aquarium, the lamp on the left was turned on for one minute, and the distribution of the fish in the upper versus the bottom half and left versus right half was determined. This was repeated four times for each group with the lighted lamp on the left, right, right, and left ends. One minute of darkness separated each light period.

In general, all species of downstream migrant salmon tested showed a statistically significant preference for the darker portion of the light gradient.
