Thirty rats were inoculated intraperitoneally with two enteric bacterial strains, followed by either taurolidine, saline, or imipenem, <b>Abdominal</b> <b>fluid</b> and blood were analyzed at different time intervals. The survival rate was highest in the imipenem group (p < 0. 05). The bacterial concentration in <b>abdominal</b> <b>fluid</b> in the taurolidine and imipenem group was lower than in the saline group (p < 0. 005), but the concentration in the imipenem group was lowest (p < 0. 005).

40|$|Background: Different {{micro-organisms}} can be cultured from <b>abdominal</b> <b>fluid</b> {{obtained from}} patients with intra-abdominal infection {{resulting from a}} perforated digestive tract. We evaluated a cohort of patients with abdominal sepsis admitted to the intensive care {{with the aim of}} obtaining more insight into the type of microorganisms involved and the efficacy of treatment. Materials and Methods: A 5 -year prospective observational cohort study was performed in patients admitted to the intensive care unit with abdominal sepsis syndrome, defined as a perforation of the digestive tract and inflammatory response with organ failure. <b>Abdominal</b> <b>fluid</b> was obtained for microbial culture during the surgical procedures and from abdominal drains. The initial treatment protocol was cefotaxim, ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, and amphotericin 8, tailored according to microbiological results. Selective decontamination of the digestive tract was administered to prevent secondary endogenous infections. Results: <b>Abdominal</b> <b>fluid</b> was taken for microbial culture from 221 of the 239 patients admitted with abdominal sepsis. Aerobic Gram-negative bacteria (AGNB) were found in 52. 9 % of the cultures of <b>abdominal</b> <b>fluid</b> taken at the time of operation, of which 45 % were Escherichia coli; in 36 % of patients more than one AGNB was found. The incidence of AGNB was highest in colorectal perforations (68. 6 %) and perforated appendicitis (77. 8 %) and lowest in gastroduodenal perforations (20. 5 %). Gram-positive bacteria were found in 42. 5 % of the <b>abdominal</b> <b>fluid</b> cultures and most frequently in colorectal perforations (50. 0 %). Candida was found in 19. 9 % of patients, with 59. 1 % of these cultures being Candida albicans. The incidence of Candida was 41. 0 % in gastroduodenal perforations and 11. 8 % in colorectal perforation. Anaerobic bacteria were cultured in 77. 8 % of patients with perforated appendicitis. Over time, the prevalence of AGNB in <b>abdominal</b> <b>fluid</b> decreased from 117 patients (52. 9 %) in the first culture to one patient (6. 7 %) in week 4 (efficacy 87 %).

40|$|Purpose: Aspiration of intra <b>abdominal</b> <b>fluid</b> {{and debris}} is usually needed during {{different}} stages of the operation. This is {{necessary in order to}} protect the intra abdominal space from contamination and/or to remove blood or tissue fluids that may occur during the operation. It is also essential for obtaining a clean surgical area. Aspiration of intra <b>abdominal</b> <b>fluid</b> collecting in Douglas Pouch is difficult, even with the use of lower abdominal incisions such as phannensteal. Aspiration of intra <b>abdominal</b> <b>fluid</b> collecting in the Douglas Pouch becomes more difficult when an upper abdominal incision is used because of the difficulty of access to the Douglas Pouch and suctioning the omentum and intestine with the aspirator. Materials and Methods: In this study, a modified suction device (Suction Tube with Air Channel =STAC) has been reported which allows the surgeon easier suctioning intra <b>abdominal</b> <b>fluid.</b> Results: STAC has an additional air channel which prevents the device from suctioning intra abdominal organs such as the intestine and omentum. We tested the efficacy of STAC in a simulated intraabdominal space such as a large transparent plastic bag with fresh sheep intestine-omentum and with 2000 cc of physiologic saline solution. While the suctioning of all the fluid was difficult (13 - 21 training) and time consuming (240 - 360 sec) when the conventional suction unit was used, all of the saline solution was easily and quickly suctioned when STAC was used (1 training and 30 - 60 sec, respectively).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether nitric oxide (NO) is present in clinically normal horses under basal conditions and if it increases secondary to naturally acquired small intestinal strangulation obstruction. Thirty-one horses were used; 20 horses with naturally acquired small intestinal strangulation obstruction and 11 clinically normal horses with no signs of gastrointestinal tract disease. Jugular venous blood, <b>abdominal</b> <b>fluid,</b> and urine were collected for NO quantification. Plasma, <b>abdominal</b> <b>fluid,</b> and urine were stored at - 70 degrees C until analyzed for NO using a chemiluminescent method. Biopsy specimens collected from the affected jejunal segment, during anesthesia or after immediately after euthanasia, or from the midjejunum of control horses, were divided into subsections for fixation in zinc formalin and cryopreservation in OCT gel. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (reduced) (NADPH) diaphorase histochemical stains were performed on cryopreserved tissues and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and nitrotyrosine immunohistochemical stains were performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues. There were significantly greater plasma and <b>abdominal</b> <b>fluid</b> NO concentrations in affected horses as compared with controls, but there were no significant differences between horses for urine NO concentrations. There was a significant decrease in NADPH diaphorase stain in mucosal epithelium, vasculature, and leukocytes, and in submucosal plexi in affected horses compared with control horses. There was a significant increase in iNOS staining in mucosal and submucosal leukocytes and in mucosal leukocyte nitrotyrosine staining of the affected compared with control horses. Endothelial NOS and neuronal NOS are present under basal conditions in the jejunum of horses and probably mediate physiologic or cytoprotective effects. Plasma and <b>abdominal</b> <b>fluid,</b> but not urine, NO concentrations increase subsequent to small intestinal strangulation obstruction; this may be associated with increased mucosal and submucosal iNOS staining in leukocytes, which was likely due to increased expression subsequent to stimuli associated with ischemia. The increased nitrotyrosine staining in mucosal leukocytes of affected horses likely reflects the presence of peroxynitrite subsequent to increased NO and superoxide production and may reflect a cytotoxic role of NO in small intestinal strangulation obstruction in horses...|$|R

40|$|Background/Objective: Nowadays, {{trauma is}} the fourth cause of {{mortality}} and morbidity in developed countries. Intraabdominal hemorrhage due to blunt abdominal trauma is the major cause of these mortalities. Therefore, every action taken for quick diagnosis of intraabdominal hemorrhage could {{save the lives of}} patients more effectively. "nPatients and Methods: This cross-sectional study concerns patients with blunt abdominal trauma admitted to the emergency of Khatam-al-anbia Hospital in a one-year period from 1385. Information from ultrasonography and CT scan were registered in a questionnaire and analyzed by statistical software SPSS 14. We used sensitivity, specifity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy as statistical tools for comparison. "nResuIts: Of the 100 patients surveyed, 20 % were female and 80 % were male. The most common clinical symptoms in both groups were abdominal pain and then abdominal tenderness. There was significant statistical difference between clinical symptoms from the point view of existing free <b>abdominal</b> <b>fluid</b> and CT-scan report (P = 0. 017). The sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value and positive predictive value of ultrasonography in the diagnosis of free <b>abdominal</b> <b>fluid</b> were respectively, 84 %, 86 %, 91 % and 75 %, which were respectively, 54 %, 90 %, 65 % and 79 % in the diagnosis of intra abdominal damage.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to determine whether nitric oxide (NO) is present in clinically healthy horses (control) under basal conditions, and if it increases secondary to naturally acquired strangulating large colon volvulus (affected). Eleven affected horses and 10 controls were studied. Jugular venous blood, <b>abdominal</b> <b>fluid,</b> and urine were collected. The NO concentrations were standardized to the creatinine concentration in the respective samples. A biopsy specimen collected from the large colon pelvic flexure at surgery was divided into subsections for processing for inducible nitric synthase (iNOS) and nitrotyrosine (NT) immunohistochemical staining and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) diaphorase histochemical staining. There were no significant differences in plasma, <b>abdominal</b> <b>fluid,</b> or urine NO concentrations between affected and control horses. There was a significant decrease in submucosal arteriolar and venular endothelium, submucosal plexus, mucosal leukocyte, mucosal and musclaris vasculature, and myenteric plexus NADPH diaphorase staining in affected versus control horses. There was a significant increase in iNOS staining in mucosal leukocytes and vasculature in affected versus control horses. Other than a greater number of positively stained mucosal leukocytes in affected horses, there were no significant differences between affected and control horses for NT staining. The presence of NADPH diaphorase staining in the endothelium and submucosal neurons suggests endothelial and neuronal NOS are present under basal conditions in the large colon of horses. Increased iNOS and NT staining in mucosal leukocytes of affected horses suggests involvement of the NO pathway in large colon volvulus.
