500|$|Dragonflies {{as a group}} {{occupy a}} {{considerable}} variety of habitats, but many species, and some families, have their own specific environmental requirements. Some species prefer flowing waters, while others prefer standing water. For example, the Gomphidae (clubtails) live in running water, and the Libellulidae (skimmers) live in still water. Some species are found in temporary water pools and are capable of tolerating changes in water level, desiccation, and the resulting variations in temperature, but some genera such as Sympetrum (darters) [...] have eggs and larvae that can resist drought and are stimulated to grow rapidly in warm, shallow pools, also often benefiting from the absence of predators there. Vegetation and its characteristics including submerged, floating, emergent, or waterside are also important. Adults may require emergent or waterside plants to use as perches; others may need specific submerged or floating plants on which to lay eggs. Requirements may be highly specific, as in Aeshna viridis (green hawker), which lives in swamps with the water-soldier, Stratiotes aloides. The chemistry of the water, including its trophic status (degree of enrichment with nutrients) and pH can also affect its use by dragonflies. Most species need moderate conditions, not too eutrophic, not too acid; a few species such as Sympetrum danae (<b>black</b> <b>darter)</b> and Libellula quadrimaculata (four-spotted chaser) prefer acidic waters such as peat bogs, while others such as Libellula fulva (scarce chaser) need slow-moving, eutrophic waters with reeds or similar waterside plants.|$|E
50|$|Fry {{of smooth}} newt was {{reported}} in 2000, the only amphibian reported by the lake. An inventory of damselflies in 1997 resulted in a list of emerald damselfly, red-eyed damselfly, variable damselfly, southern hawker, brilliant emerald, four-spotted chaser, eastern white-faced darter, and <b>black</b> <b>darter.</b> A second inventory in 2000 produced the following list interpreted as a normal amount of species: common hawker, brown hawker, Irish damselfly, variable damselfly, downy emerald, red-eyed damselfly, northern white-faced darter, brilliant emerald, and <b>black</b> <b>darter.</b>|$|E
50|$|The weak, low, {{fluttering}} {{flight is}} not unlike that of a <b>black</b> <b>darter,</b> but it perches frequently on the tips of rush stems {{rather than on the}} ground. It is a surprisingly inconspicuous species.|$|E

50|$|Sympetrum danae, the <b>black</b> <b>darter</b> {{or black}} meadowhawk is a {{dragonfly}} found in northern Europe, Asia, and North America. At about 30 mm long, it is Britain's smallest resident dragonfly. It {{is a very}} active late summer insect typical of heathland and moorland bog pools.|$|E
50|$|The {{reserve is}} also known for its insects. Eleven species of dragonflies and damselflies have been recorded, {{including}} the <b>black</b> <b>darter</b> (Sympetrum danae) (Britain's smallest dragonfly) and the four-spotted chaser (Libellula quadrimaculata). They are joined by 19 species of butterfly, including the green hairstreak (Callophrys rubi).|$|E
50|$|Avian-Fauna: 320 {{species of}} {{avifauna}} including eight varieties of Kingfishers. Birds such as Asian Open Bill, Cormorants, <b>Darters,</b> <b>Black</b> Ibis, Egrets, are frequently {{seen in the}} park. Every year close to 1,20,000 winter visitor from abroad for wintering and 80,000 resident birds {{from different parts of}} India arrive for nesting during monsoon season.|$|R
5000|$|The swamp is {{classified}} as an Important Bird Area. [...] It is a major breeding area for magpie geese. Other abundant waterbirds include wandering whistling ducks, Pacific black ducks and green pygmy geese. There are breeding colonies of royal spoonbills, little pied and little <b>black</b> cormorants, and <b>darters.</b> Land adjacent to the swamp supports {{one of the largest}} breeding populations of the hooded parrot outside the Katherine area.|$|R
5000|$|The {{site has}} been {{identified}} as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International. The floodplain supports over 1% of the world populations magpie geese and pied herons. The mudflats of Fog Bay, extending from Point Jenny to Stingray Head, support over 1% of the world populations of great knots and grey-tailed tattlers, among the maximum of 35,000 waders, or shorebirds, recorded. [...] Other waders for which the site is at least sometimes important include black-tailed godwits, greaters and lesser sand plovers, grey plovers, Terek sandpipers, and Far Eastern curlews. Other waterbirds that have been recorded in relatively large numbers include little pied and little <b>black</b> cormorants, <b>darters,</b> royal spoonbills, glossy, straw-necked and Australian white ibises, great and intermediate egrets, plumed and wandering whistling ducks, grey teals, Pacific black ducks, and brolgas.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} {{species of}} dragonflies and damselflies {{have been recorded}} at Black Lake: white-faced darter (Leucorrhinia dubia last recorded 1997), brown hawker (Aeshna grandis), four-spotted chaser (Libellula quadrimaculata), common darter (Sympetrum striolatum), <b>black</b> <b>darter</b> (Sympetrum danae), large red damselfly (Pyrrhosoma nymphula) and common blue damselfly (Enallagma cyathigerum).|$|E
50|$|Most North American darters fly in {{late summer}} and autumn, {{breeding}} in ponds and foraging over meadows. Commonly, they are yellow-gold as juveniles, with mature males and some females becoming bright red on part or all of their bodies. An exception to this color scheme is the <b>black</b> <b>darter</b> (Sympetrum danae).|$|E
50|$|Males of the banded darter, {{like most}} members of the genus, have a red abdomen. The species' primary {{distinguishing}} feature however is the presence, in both sexes, of broad black bands across the outer section of each wing. It is similar in size to the <b>black</b> <b>darter</b> (Sympetrum danae) (35-40mm), sharing the broad hindwings and black legs.|$|E
50|$|The {{probability}} of long-time isolation from other wetlands {{is suggested by}} a fish endemic to the lake, the Jipe tilapia. Jipe's waters are teeming with big fish, principally siluriforms and cyprinoids. Jipe forms a biodiversity rich ecosystem also known for the water birds that frequent its reedy shores; these include storks, egrets, pelicans, spur-winged plovers, ducks, and Egyptian geese. Lesser jacana and the purple gallinule are common on the lake despite being rare {{in other parts of}} Africa and Madagascar squacco heron, <b>black</b> heron, African <b>darter</b> and African skimmers are often seen. The vicinity of the lake is frequented by herds of game. Hippopotami and crocodiles are plentiful.|$|R

50|$|Etheostoma duryi, the <b>black</b> <b>darter,</b> is {{a species}} of darter endemic to the eastern United States, where it occurs in the {{drainage}} of the Tennessee River in the states of Tennessee, Georgia, and Alabama. It is an inhabitant of rocky pools in streams and smaller rivers and their adjacent riffles. This species can reach a length of 7.2 cm, though most only reach about 5 cm. The specific epithet honors Charles Dury (1847-1931), who collected the original type specimens.|$|E
50|$|The forest {{supports}} a rich invertebrate fauna, with many heathland specialities. Half of Britain's 46 breeding species of damselflies and dragonflies (the Odonata) have been recorded, the scarcer among them being the <b>black</b> <b>darter,</b> brilliant emerald and small red damselfly. It {{is also an}} important home for the golden-ringed dragonfly, which flies from mid-June to early September. Of the forest's 34 species of butterfly, the most spectacular, the purple emperor, can be hard to see. Another speciality, the silver-studded blue, is by contrast plentiful, with the main food plants of its caterpillars being gorses and heathers.|$|E
50|$|Another {{species of}} note, {{found in the}} wet flushed areas, is the nationally {{uncommon}} keeled skimmer dragonfly (Orthetrum coerulescens). This is a species of southern wet heathlands whose larvae develop in the wet mud of base-enriched flushes or bog pools. The valley is particularly rich in Odonata species: dragonflies recorded include the emperor (Anax imperator), golden-ringed (Cordulegaster boltonii), broad-bodied chaser (Libellula depressa), four-spotted chaser (Libellula quadrimaculata), southern hawker (Aeshna cyanea), common hawker (Aeshna juncea), black-tailed skimmer (Orthetrum cancellatum), common darter (Sympetrum striolatum), and <b>black</b> <b>darter</b> (Sympetrum danae); damselflies include the large red (Pyrrhosoma nymphula), azure (Coenagrion puella), emerald (Lestes sponsa), common blue (Enallagma cyathigerum), blue-tailed (Ischnura elegans), scarce blue-tailed (Ischnura pumilio), and beautiful demoiselle (Calopteryx virgo).|$|E
50|$|The Mire’s make-up of wet acid peat {{makes it}} ideal {{conditions}} for some rare and diverse {{species of plants}} such as bog asphodels (Narthecium ossifragum), round-leaved sundew (Drosera rotundifolia), white beaked sedge (Rhynchospora alba) and cranberry. The Mire also has some rare insects such as the <b>black</b> <b>darter</b> dragonfly (Sympetrum danae) and moths such as the light knot grass (Acronicta menyanthidis). In the dark {{it is possible to}} see glowworms. The mire lies on shallow peat and is bordered on one side by a steep escarpment containing large areas of dry heath and woodland which marks the edge of an ancient coastline. The woodland at Dersingham is quite recent and contains Scots pine, oak, sweet chestnut, sycamore and birch. The woodland glades attract birds such as redpoll, crossbill, long-eared owl, tree pipit, woodlark, shelduck, nightjar, and sparrowhawk.|$|E
