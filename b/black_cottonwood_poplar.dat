50|$|The larvae feed on poplar, willow and birch. Poplars are {{generally}} favoured, although willows seem preferred {{in some areas}} of California and Oregon. <b>Black</b> <b>cottonwood,</b> balsam <b>poplar,</b> and white poplar, as well as several hybrids poplars, are also recorded as hosts. Newly hatched larvae crawl over the bark for a few hours before selecting suitable sites to begin feeding. The larvae initially excavate cavities in the phloem and cambium and later galleries into the wood. The larvae feed during two successive summer and fall seasons. The first winter in the galleries, which are loosely packed with frass and the second winter in pupal chambers near the distal ends of the galleries. These distal ends are capped with silk, but no cocoons are formed. Pupation lasts two to three weeks. A generation requires two years over most of its range but may be of shorter duration in its southern range.|$|R

40|$|The {{phytochrome}} photoreceptors play {{important roles}} in the photoperiodic control of vegetative bud set, growth cessation, dormancy induction, and cold-hardiness in trees. Interestingly, ecotypic differences in photoperiodic re-sponses are observed in many temperate-zone tree species. Northern and southern ecotypes of <b>black</b> <b>cottonwood</b> (Populus trichocarpa Torr. & Gray), for example, exhibit marked differences in the timing of short-day-induced bud set and growth cessation, and these responses are controlled by phytochrome. Therefore, {{as a first step}} toward determining the molecular genetic basis of photoperiodic ecotypes in trees, we characterized the phytochrome gene (PHY) family in <b>black</b> <b>cottonwood.</b> We recovered fragments of one PHYA and two PHYB using PCR-based cloning and by screening a genomic library. Results from Southern analyses confirmed that <b>black</b> <b>cottonwood</b> has one PHYA locus and two PHYB loci, which we arbitrarily designated PHYB 1 and PHYB 2. Phylogenetic analyses which in-cluded PHY from <b>black</b> <b>cottonwood,</b> Arabidopsis thaliana and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) suggest that the PHYB/D duplications in these species occurred independently. When Southern blots were probed with PHYC, PHYE, and PHYF heterologous probes, the strongest bands that we detected were those of <b>black</b> <b>cottonwood</b> PHYA and/or PHYB. These results suggest that <b>black</b> <b>cottonwood</b> lacks members of the PHYC/F and PHYE subfamilies. Although <b>black</b> <b>cottonwood</b> could contain additional PHY that are distantly related to known angiosperm PHY, our results imply that the PHY family of <b>black</b> <b>cottonwood</b> is less complex than that of other well-characterized dicot specie...|$|R

Six <b>black</b> <b>cottonwood</b> and 3 Douglas hawthorn shrubs were selected in 1996 and 9 <b>black</b> <b>cottonwood</b> and 3 Douglas hawthorn shrubs in 1997. Shrubs were selected based on size and isolation. Each indirect method was applied prior to removing a portion of leaves from each shrub. Shrubs were defoliated in 3 to 7 increments and leaf surface area of each was measured. After shrubs were completely defoliated increments of measured leaf areas were added to subsequently removed leaf areas to determine the measured leaf area present on a shrub each time indirect methods were applied. Measured leaf areas were paired with indirect method values and regression equations were developed. Correlation coefficients for regressions were 0. 76 for <b>black</b> <b>cottonwood</b> and 0. 70 for Douglas hawthorn for the point frame, 0. 91 for <b>black</b> <b>cottonwood</b> and 0. 79 for Douglas hawthorn for the photographs, 0. 62 for <b>black</b> <b>cottonwood</b> and 0. 61 for Douglas hawthorn when shrub volume was included for the canopy analyzer.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Natural Resources: Wildlife, 2011 Phytophagous {{arthropod}} {{consumption by}} birds and bats {{has been shown}} to initiate top-down cascading effects that reduce plant damage or accelerate plant growth in terrestrial ecosystems. Birds and bats attracted to ecological restoration sites can potentially contribute to ecosystem functioning by reducing herbivore-caused plant damage and indirectly facilitating plant growth. I examined tri-trophic interactions between birds and bats, arthropods, and sapling <b>black</b> <b>cottonwoods</b> (Populus balsamifera ssp. trichocarpa) along two recovering tributary streams of Mono Lake, California, USA. I used mesh exclosures over saplings to remove the direct effects of bird and bat predation on arthropods dwelling on <b>black</b> <b>cottonwoods,</b> and I compared arthropod density and biomass, herbivore-caused foliage damage, and shoot growth between predator-free saplings and paired control saplings to which birds and bats had foraging access. Avian foraging surveys conducted in the riparian vegetation along the streams revealed that 49 percent of foraging attacks were made in <b>black</b> <b>cottonwoods</b> compared to other substrates but that only four percent of <b>black</b> <b>cottonwood</b> foraging attacks occurred in saplings comparable in height to experimental saplings. Contrary to predictions, neither total arthropod biomass or density, nor any arthropod foraging functional group (i. e., herbivores, predators and parasites, leaf chewers) differed between exclosure saplings and controls. It followed that bird and bat exclusion did not significantly influence herbivore-caused leaf damage or sapling shoot growth. Arthropod densities on sapling <b>black</b> <b>cottonwoods</b> were lower than has been reported by researchers who found bird-initiated species-level trophic cascades on other plants in the Salicaceae family. Further, I found no evidence that birds and bats preferentially consumed predaceous or herbivorous arthropods, or that intratrophic arthropod predation attenuated vertebrate predation effects. It appears that birds and bats do not indirectly reduce foliage damage or facilitate <b>black</b> <b>cottonwood</b> sapling growth in the context of riparian ecosystem restoration when herbivore loads are low...|$|R
40|$|The June 1999 {{pipeline}} leak {{and subsequent}} explosion in Whatcom Creek {{resulted in a}} fire that scorched ~ 10 ha of coniferous and riparian forest in Bellingham, Washington, USA. This fire provided an opportunity to study the postfire responses of red alder (Alnus rubra), <b>black</b> <b>cottonwood</b> (Populus trichocarpa) [P. balsamifera subsp. trichocarpa], and bigleaf maple (Acer macrophyllum) in the 3. 2 -ha scorched riparian zone. Bigleaf maple endures {{all but the most}} intense fires, resprouting vigorously after fire. Red alder and <b>black</b> <b>cottonwood</b> are known resprouters that may survive low intensity fires, but data about their responses to fire are sparse. The postfire status of every tree in the burn zone was evaluated immediately after the fire in June 1999, and during the first postfire growing season in May 2000. Tree response, in relation to trunk diameter, percent crown scorch, and percent bark scorch, was categorized as (1) alive with a new leafy crown; (2) topkilled and resprouted; or (3) dead. Fire intensity was higher on the left bank (left side of the creek when facing downstream), where trees experienced greater mortality. More than half the 854 trees in the burn zone survived the fire, 57 % by forming new leafy crowns and 43 % by resprouting. Red alder, <b>black</b> <b>cottonwood</b> and bigleaf maple demonstrated abilities to survive a disturbance to which they are not ordinarily subjected. All three species resisted low intensity fire and reformed leafy crowns on the right bank, and they endured moderate to high intensity fire by resprouting after topkill on the left bank. On the left bank, probabilities of surviving 100 % crown scorch were 0. 24 for red alder, 0. 66 for <b>black</b> <b>cottonwood,</b> and 0. 68 for bigleaf maple; probabilities of surviving 100 % bark scorch were 0. 09 for red alder, 0. 66 for <b>black</b> <b>cottonwood,</b> and 0. 60 for bigleaf maple.

40|$|Graduation date: 1999 As a {{key factor}} {{contributing}} to slope stability, in-stream habitat for aquatic species (e. g., salmonids), nutrient cycling, and corridors for upland species, riparian vegetation and its maintenance is of critical conservation importance. Subsequently, the chronic degradation of aquatic and riparian ecosystems in the semi-arid and arid landscapes of the western U. S. {{is the focus of}} many recent research efforts. A study was undertaken to investigate historic and current <b>black</b> <b>cottonwood</b> populations in the Grande Ronde River Basin, northeastern Oregon, U. S. A., and evaluate restoration potential given present-day fluvial-geomorphic conditions and reproductive strategies. <b>Black</b> <b>cottonwood</b> (Populus trichocarpa), a dominant tree species in these semi-arid systems, has been severely impacted by intensive grazing, irrigation, and land conversion activities over the past one and a half centuries. With the explicit incorporation of space and time, a simple conceptual framework was developed to examine the ecological restoration potential of <b>black</b> <b>cottonwood</b> from ecological and evolutionary perspectives. Restoration potential is defined in this study in terms of availability of suitable habitat and source (i. e., seedpool) for future generations. Digital analyses of aerial photographs reveal changes in the extent, numbers, and total area of cottonwood communities and habitat since 1937. Restoration potential is evaluated using historic stream flow records, stream cross-section analysis to predict current stream discharge, and DNA RAPD procedures to assess the effects of changing stream geomorphology and disturbance regimes on cottonwood reproductive strategies. Optimal spatial and temporal conditions for potential restoration locations of <b>black</b> <b>cottonwood</b> have been identified relative to channel morphology and flood events (e. g., frequency and magnitude).
