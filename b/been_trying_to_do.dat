500|$|After the battle, Xerxes {{was curious}} {{as to what the}} Greeks had <b>been</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> (presumably because they had had so few men) and had some Arcadian deserters interrogated in his presence. The answer was: all the other men were {{participating}} in the Olympic Games. When Xerxes asked what the prize was for the winner, the answer was: [...] "an olive-wreath". Upon hearing this, Tigranes, a Persian general, said: [...] "Good heavens, Mardonius, what kind of men are these that you have pitted against us? It is not for riches that they contend but for honor!" [...] (Godley translation) or otherwise, [...] "Ye Gods, Mardonius, what men have you brought us to fight against? Men that fight not for gold, but for glory." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I {{thought they}} were crazy: I {{was brought up in}} Taiwan, what do I know about 19th-century England? About halfway through the script it started to make sense why they chose me. In my films I've been trying to mix social satire and family drama. I {{realised}} that all along I had <b>been</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> Jane Austen without knowing it. Jane Austen was my destiny. I just had to overcome the cultural barrier."Because Thompson and Doran had worked on the screenplay for so long, Lee described himself at the time as a [...] "director for hire", as he was unsure of his role and position. He spent six months in England [...] "learn how to make this movie, how to do a period film, culturally... and how to adapt to the major league film industry." ...|$|E
500|$|Review {{aggregator}} Metacritic {{shows an}} average score rating of 76 out of 100 {{for both the}} PS2 and Xbox versions, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews". Marc Saltzman of CNN wrote: [...] "Unlike Hollywood horror movies that often get worse with each new sequel ("," [...] for example), Konami's scary Silent Hill series gets better -- and creepier -- with age." [...] Video game magazine Game Informer praised Silent Hill 4: The Room, stating that its [...] "disarming voyeurism, bizarre camera angles, and exceptionally well-placed tension is what the series has <b>been</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> all along, but The Room is the first entry to do it right." [...] According to a reviewer for Edge magazine, [...] "ook at it one way, and it's a choking journey with unprecedented attention to unease and psychological horror, a game framed with unparalleled sophistication. From another angle, it's just a clunky PSone throwback, with all the design wit of a dodo." [...] The New York Times found it completely lacking in [...] "true terror." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I {{knew when}} I {{was getting ready}} <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the movie that I was taking a chance," [...] said Hill. [...] "This {{was not meant to}} be an {{everyday}} action movie.

5000|$|In {{response}} to her critics, Brigitte Gabriel has said that [...] "I am not anti-Muslim, I am anti ideologies which want to kill free people and subjugate them right now, {{in the name of}} the Islamic religion.

2500|$|In late 2008, Fincher {{stated the}} movie is {{unlikely}} to be made. [...] "It looks like it's not going to happen. There's no script and as you know, Morgan Freeman's not in the best of health right now. We've <b>been</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it but it's probably not going to happen." [...] However, in 2010 it was announced that the film was still planned for future production and both Freeman and Fincher mentioned it as still needing a worthy script.|$|E
2500|$|In 1949, {{seeing that}} the Communists were gaining control of China, the Kashag {{expelled}} all Chinese connected with the Chinese government, over the protests of both the Kuomintang and the Communists. [...] Both the Republic of China (ROC) and the People's Republic of China (PRC) have maintained China's claim to sovereignty over Tibet. Many people felt that Tibet should {{not be part of}} China because they were constantly under attack in different ways rather often. Tibet had been its own country before 1951. In many eyes China seems to be trying to dismiss Tibet's culture, and has also <b>been</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so worldwide. Because of the powerful Communist PRC government, Tibet has had to deal with political changes and various forms of oppression.|$|E
2500|$|In 2010, Black {{addressed}} the Fit for Work Europe organisation, {{of which she}} is a co-president (the organisation focuses on the consequences of musculoskeletal disorders when they affect people of working age). In her address, {{she said that the}} government had appointed her to her national director role because [...] "...we had far too many people leaving the workforce with relatively mild musculoskeletal conditions, stress, anxiety, depression...and many of those people received no immediate help to keep them in the workplace...they were leaving the workplace to go into the benefits system". She also said: [...] "If I had to summarise what we have <b>been</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in the United Kingdom, it would be to say: get rid of the old system of the paper sick-note, put it in red because it's dangerous, it's not good advocacy for your patient".|$|E

2500|$|In 1984, Lloyd Webber {{contacted}} Cameron Mackintosh, the co-producer of Cats and Song and Dance, {{to propose}} a new musical. He was aiming for a romantic piece, and suggested Gaston Leroux's book The Phantom of the Opera as a basis. They screened both the 1925 Lon Chaney and the 1943 Claude Rains motion picture versions, but neither saw {{an effective way to}} make the leap from film to stage. Later, in New York, Lloyd Webber found a second-hand copy of the original, long-out-of-print Leroux novel, which supplied the necessary inspiration to develop a musical: [...] "I was actually writing something else at the time, and I realised that the reason I was hung up was because I was trying to write a major romantic story, and I had <b>been</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that ever since I started my career. Then with the Phantom, it was there!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Snowden {{met with}} Barton Gellman of The Washington Post {{six months after}} the {{disclosure}} for an exclusive interview spanning 14 hours, his first since being granted temporary asylum. Snowden talked about his life in Russia as [...] "an indoor cat," [...] reflected on his time as an NSA contractor, and discussed at length the revelations of global surveillance and their reverberations. Snowden said, [...] "In terms of personal satisfaction, the mission's already accomplished ... I already won. As soon as the journalists were able to work, everything that I had <b>been</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was validated." [...] He commented [...] "I am not trying to bring down the NSA, I am working to improve the NSA ... I am still working for the NSA right now. They {{are the only ones who}} don't realize it." [...] On the accusation from former CIA and NSA director Michael Hayden that he had defected, Snowden stated, [...] "If I defected at all, I defected from the government to the public." [...] In 2014, Snowden said that he lives [...] "a surprisingly open life" [...] in Russia and that he is recognized when he goes to computer stores.|$|E

This early example of an internet-based alternate reality game eventually unveiled the news of a new online animated series by Sony based on the Machina story. Due {{in part to the}} changing circumstances surrounding the album's rollout, the series was shelved before any episodes were completed, though several portions have been leaked to YouTube. Corgan later said, [...] "Yeah, I think you can find a few bits and pieces, but it never got finished unfortunately.
