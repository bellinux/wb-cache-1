2500|$|Authorities in German Democratic Republic (GDR) {{were highly}} skeptical of jazz {{due to its}} American roots. Karl Heinz Drechsel was {{dismissed}} from {{his job at the}} GDR <b>broadcasting</b> <b>organization</b> in 1952 because of his fondness for jazz and was prohibited from organizing jazz broadcasts again until 1958. The founder of the jazz group Leipzig, Reginald Rudorf, held well-attended lectures on jazz, which also explained the culture of the United States. [...] But they were stopped with disruptive actions by the state security organization ("Staatssicherheit"). In 1957, the Dresdner Interessengemeinschaft Jazz (community of jazz interests) was prohibited in connection with the trial of the regime against Rudorf, as a suspected spy.|$|E

2500|$|In modern Japanese academia, Amami's {{traditional}} {{songs were}} {{described by the}} term min'yo (folk songs), a term {{which can be found}} in Shigeno Yūkō's Amami Ōshima minzoku-shi (1927), Kazari Eikichi's Amami Ōshima min'yō taikan (1933) and Nobori Shomu's Dai Amami shi (1949). These authors were influenced by Yanagita Kunio, the father of Japanese folkloristics, who developed the concept of min'yō as a product of society and communal space. Takahashi notes that although Kazari's monograph of 1933 used shima-uta and min'yō apparently interchangeably, the revised edition of 1966 almost exclusively chose min'yō. [...] The term min'yō also gained public acceptance throughout Japan when the national <b>broadcasting</b> <b>organization</b> NHK began to use the term in its radio programs in 1947.|$|E
2500|$|In 1936, John Gunther {{wrote that}} Reith's [...] "modernist citadel on Portland Place is more {{important}} in the life of Britain than most government offices". He [...] "rules the B.B.C. with a hand of granite", and that Reith [...] "has made it probably the finest <b>broadcasting</b> <b>organization</b> in the world"; Gunther predicted that he [...] "might make a considerable career if he went into politics". Reith, by 1938, had become discontented with his role as Director-General, asserting in his autobiography that the organisational structure of the BBC that he had created had left him with insufficient work to do. He was invited by Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain to become chairman of Imperial Airways, the country's most important airline and one which had fallen into public disfavour because of its inefficiency. Some commentators have suggested a conspiracy amongst the Board of Governors to remove Reith, but that has never been proved, and there is no record of such a thing in Reith's own memoir.|$|E
2500|$|Heitaro Nakajima, who {{developed}} an early digital audio recorder within Japan's national public <b>broadcasting</b> <b>organization</b> NHK in 1970, became {{general manager of}} Sony's audio department in 1971. His team developed a digital PCM adaptor audio tape recorder using a Betamax video recorder in 1973. After this, in 1974 the leap to storing digital audio on an optical disc was easily made. Sony first publicly demonstrated an optical digital audio disc in September 1976. A year later, in September 1977, Sony showed the press a 30cm disc that could play 60 minutes of digital audio (44,100Hz sampling rate and 16-bit resolution) using MFM modulation. In September 1978, the company demonstrated an optical digital audio disc with a 150-minute playing time, 44,056Hz sampling rate, 16-bit linear resolution, and cross-interleaved error correction code—specifications similar to those later settled upon for the standard compact disc format in 1980. Technical details of Sony's digital audio disc were presented during the 62nd AES Convention, held on 13–16 March 1979, in Brussels. Sony's AES technical paper was published on 1 March 1979. A week later, on 8 March, Philips publicly demonstrated a prototype of an optical digital audio disc {{at a press conference}} called [...] "Philips Introduce Compact Disc" [...] in Eindhoven, Netherlands.|$|E
