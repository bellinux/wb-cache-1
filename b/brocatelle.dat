25|$|The {{biggest change}} to the room was in the window treatments. Jacqueline Kennedy {{specifically}} asked for new curtains for the East Room consisting of opaque silk undercurtains and yellow drapes. Boudin oversaw the design of new draperies, with silk provided by Maison Jansen. A draft design of the drapes and valances was not ready until mid-1963. Boudin, apparently wishing {{to draw attention to}} the center window between the fireplaces, designed a valance for the center window while putting all other drapes behind window boxes. For the drapes, Boudin suggested a braid border and tie-backs made of ball fringe covered in satin. Kennedy disapproved of Boudin's proposal for the valance and window boxes, as it did not make use of the historic 1902 gilt window cornices. She did, however, approve of the fabric and tie-backs. Made of a custom-manufactured gold and cream silk lampas, the fabric contained a non-repetitive design of birds, butterflies, cupids, flowers, medallions, roosters, and wheat and featured heavy fringe at the bottom. The drapes were hung in straight panels from the carved and gilded 1902 wooden cornices. The design of the valances was not finalized until April 1964. First Lady Lady Bird Johnson asked Jacqueline Kennedy to assist her in finalizing the design. Originally, they were to be of <b>brocatelle,</b> a jacquard weave fabric similar to brocade but thicker and heavier and with designs in high relief. But this design was countermanded by Boudin. Instead, gold lampas, trimmed with braid and hemmed with gilt, spun-metal twisted fringe at the bottom, was installed in flat panels from behind each cornice. The curtains and valances took nearly three years to design and manufacture, and were not hung in the room until the Johnson administration in 1965. The drapes and valances cost $26,149. The cost was covered by sales of Jacqueline Kennedy's guidebook to the White House, which by 1965 was in its fourth edition.|$|E

50|$|Dating {{back to the}} Middle Ages, brocade fabric {{was one of the}} few luxury fabrics worn by nobility {{throughout}} China, India, Greece, Japan, Korea and Byzantium. Woven by the Byzantines, brocades were {{an especially}} desirable fabric. From the 4th to the 6th centuries, production of silk was seemingly non-existent, as linen and wool were the predominant fabrics. During this period, there was no public knowledge of silk fabric production except for that which was kept secret by the Chinese. Over the years, knowledge of silk production became known among other cultures and spread westward. As silk production became known to Western cultures, trade from the east began to decrease. It was discovered by Byzantine historians that in the 6th century a pair of monks brought the secret of sericulture - silk production - to the Byzantine emperor. As a result, western cultures were able to learn how to breed, raise, and feed silkworms. From this point until the 9th century, Byzantium became the biggest and most central producer for all of the Western world in the production of all types of silk motifs, including brocades, damasks, <b>brocatelles</b> and tapestry-like fabrics.|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION This slide {{presentation}} and brief introduction represent work-in-progress, originally undertaken for an exhibition {{that was to}} have been held at the Fashion Institute of Technology. 1 The textiles in question were either designed for the textile firm of F. Schumacher 2 ̆ 6 Company or imported and sold under the company 2 ̆ 7 s name. The slides, reproduced from a number of periodicals and company manuals, were shown in the hope that they would be recognized by the other conferees. HISTORY 2 The company was founded by Frederick Schumacher, who came to the United States from France in 1883 to establish an office for the French textile firm Passavant 2 ̆ 6 Company to sell furnishing fabrics. Prior to his moving to the United States, Frederick Schumacher had trained with several French firms including Vanoutryve an 4 Passavant. In 1889 Passavant decided to close its New York office, whereupon Frederick Schumacher bought their inventory and in August of that year opened his own firm at Broadway and 22 nd Street. He continued to sell fine imported brocades, damasks, <b>brocatelles</b> and lampas to interior decorators and architects for use in hotels and private residences. In 1895 the company leased a mill in Paterson, New Jersey, identified as the Waverly Mill where silk damasks, taffetas and satins were woven. In the 19202 ̆ 7 s Schumacher began working with American and European designers, who created textiles which the company sold and promoted in its ads. Today F. Schumacher 2 ̆ 6 Company is still owned by descendants of its founder, Frederick Schumacher...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{charm of}} those parlors of John's may be {{chemically}} analyzed," [...] I said. [...] "In the first place, there is sunshine, {{a thing that}} always affects the human nerves of happiness. Why else is it that people are always {{so glad to see}} the sun after a long storm? why are bright days matters of such congratulation? Sunshine fills a house with a thousand beautiful and fanciful effects of light and shade,--with soft, luminous, reflected radiances, that give picturesque effects to the pictures, books, statuettes of an interior. John, happily, had no money to buy <b>brocatelle</b> curtains, and, besides this, he loved sunshine too much to buy them, if he could. He had been enough with artists to know that heavy damask curtains darken precisely that part of the window where the light proper for pictures and statuary should come in, namely, the upper part. The fashionable system of curtains lights only the legs of the chairs and the carpets, and leaves all the upper portion of the room in shadow. John's windows have shades which can at pleasure be drawn down from the top or up from the bottom, so that the best light to be had may always be arranged for his little interior." ...|$|E

A mid-19th-century blue and red Mahal carpet produced by Ziegler & Co. is a replacement and a Shirvan hearthrug dates from the 19th century. Portraits of Sir Ughtred and Lady Kay-Shuttleworth from1884 are by John Collier.|$|E
50|$|The rear {{compartment}} was upholstered {{and trimmed}} in hand-woven silver silk <b>brocatelle.</b> Aluminium cabinets were {{built into the}} division and were covered in pale blue crocodile leather.The cabinet held cut-crystal decanters, while drawers above the cabinet held glasses, silverware, cutlery, white linen, and Wedgewood china cups, saucers and plates. The rear compartment could seat three people, and a nylon fur rug covered the floor. The radio controls were in the rear armrest. Four matching crocodile leather suitcases were fitted into the large boot.|$|E

50|$|Brocade fabrics {{are mostly}} for {{upholstery}} and draperies. They {{are also used}} for evening and formal clothing, for vestments, {{as well as for}} costumes. The use of precious and semiprecious stones in the adornment of brocades is not common but has been replaced with the use of sequins and beading as decoration. Brocade fabrics are now largely woven on a Jacquard loom that is able to create many complex tapestry-like designs using the jacquard technique. Although many brocade fabrics look like tapestries and are advertised by some fashion promotions as such, they are {{not to be confused with}} true tapestries. Patterns such as brocade, <b>brocatelle,</b> damask and tapestry-like fabrics are known as jacquard patterns.|$|E
