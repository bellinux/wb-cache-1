In the second part, we specialize to <b>blow-ups</b> of P r and show that many invariants of these <b>blow-ups</b> can be interpreted as numbers of rational curves on P r having specified global multiplicities or tangent directions in the blown-up points. We give various numerical examples, including a new easy way to determine the famous multiplicity d − 3 for d-fold coverings of rational curves on the quintic threefold, and, as an outlook, two examples of <b>blow-ups</b> along subvarieties, whose Gromov-Witten invariants lead to classical multisecant formulas. Over the last few years, Gromov-Witten invariants of smooth projective varieties have become a powerful tool in enumerative geometry. Originally applicable only to convex varieties where the spaces of stable maps have the expected dimension, the theory is now well-developed for all varieties by means of virtual fundamental classes [BF], [B].

25|$|Hoses may {{be fitted}} to low {{pressure}} ports of the regulator first stage to provide gas for inflating buoyancy compensators and/or dry suits. These hoses {{usually have a}} quick-connector end with an automatically sealing valve which blocks flow if the hose is disconnected from the buoyancy compensator or suit. There are two basic styles of connector, which are not compatible with each other. The high flow rate CEJN 221 fitting has a larger bore and allows gas flow at a fast enough rate {{for use as a}} connector to a demand valve. This is sometimes seen in a combination BC inflator/deflator mechanism with integrated secondary DV (octopus), such as in the AIR II unit from Scubapro. The low flow rate Seatec connector is more common and is the industry standard for BC inflator connectors, and is also popular on dry suits, as the limited flow rate reduces the risk of a <b>blow-up</b> if the valve sticks open. The high flow rate connector is used by some manufacturers on dry suits.|$|E
