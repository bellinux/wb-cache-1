5|$|After Busch {{had spent}} six months with his uncle Kleine at Lüthorst, he {{expressed}} an aim to continue study in Munich. This request caused a rift with his father who, however, eventually funded this move; - see for comparison Busch's illustrated story of Painter Klecksel. Busch's expectations of the Munich Academy of Fine Arts were not met. His life became aimless; there were occasional return visits to Lüthorst, but contact with his parents had been broken off. In 1857 and 1858, as his position seemed to <b>be</b> <b>without</b> prospects, he contemplated emigration to Brazil to keep bees.|$|E

However, Liverpool midfielder Šmicer had recovered from an ankle problem and would be available for selection. United {{had a number of}} injury concerns. Wes Brown, Scholes and Ryan Giggs were all doubts for the final, after they had picked up knocks in the week before the final. They would also <b>be</b> <b>without</b> striker Diego Forlán, who had injured his ankle against Juventus, however, defender Mikaël Silvestre was declared fit to start.|$|E

50|$|Though no {{authentic}} {{figures of}} female literacy rate are available, even rudimentary guesses make the female literacy rate {{not more than}} 3%, while the male rate {{as reported by the}} NCHD is about 18%. 76 schools are working with one teacher and one room without any shelter. There are five registered Seminaries and five private Schools. The NCHD is running five feeder Schools. Teachers in these private schools work in a quack fashion and use very crude methods of teaching, including bastinado-type caning on the hands. 83% of schools <b>are</b> <b>without</b> electricity, 45% <b>are</b> <b>without</b> a boundary wall, 50% <b>are</b> <b>without</b> a toilet, and 35% <b>are</b> <b>without</b> drinking water.|$|R

A thread that runs through much of his work is therefore the notion of home, homelessness and wandering. Since 2011, his repertoire {{has taken on a}} political dimension.|$|E

5|$|Although {{he learned}} his {{repertoire}} {{by listening to}} elders perform traditional pieces, Rakoto Frah often performed personalized variations and interpreted the traditional airs in original ways. The themes addressed in his songs ranged from serious to light-hearted and could touch on social concerns, behavior and the description of places. Rakoto Frah used both traditional flutes and those he crafted himself using diverse locally available materials. These included flutes crafted from sections of metal ski poles, PVC pipes and plastic curtain rods. He was never known to <b>be</b> <b>without</b> a flute and was widely respected for his musical virtuosity and his kindness alike. Rakoto Frah described music {{the most important element}} of life, even more important to him than his own family. Over the course of his career, the artist produced more than 800pieces of instrumental and vocal music.|$|E
5|$|As {{the complex}} was being built, and their current home at Yankee Stadium was being renovated, they would <b>be</b> <b>without</b> {{a home for}} three years. Their final full season at Yankee Stadium was 1972. After playing their first two games there in 1973, the Giants played {{the rest of their}} home games in 1973, as well as all of their home games in 1974, at the Yale Bowl in New Haven, Connecticut. This was done out of a desire to have their own home field, as opposed to having to share Shea Stadium with the Jets. However, between access problems, {{neighborhood}} issues, the fact that the Yale Bowl was not ideally suited for pro football (the stadium did not have lights, nor does it have lights today), the age of the stadium (it was built in 1914) and the lack of modern amenities, the Giants reconsidered their decision and ultimately agreed to share Shea Stadium with the Jets for the 1975 season. The Giants left Yale Bowl after losing all seven home games played at Yale in the 1974 season and compiling a home record of 1–11 over that two-year stretch.|$|E

5|$|In 2014, {{the chain}} {{continued}} to manage its store footprint opening new stores, with locations in Ringwood, Blackburn and Southwold, its first branch to <b>be</b> <b>without</b> Waterstones branding, {{as well as}} closing stores in Eastleigh and St Neots. Continued business strategy change saw further departures from Head Office in brand communication and PR and a renewed agency contract for Waterstones’ digital marketing with Epiphany. The retailer overhauled its business technology with new algorithms on its website to help personalise the online shopping experience, updated point-of-sale IT and by introducing contactless payment in its stores. The retailer partnered with Airbnb to hold a one-off ‘sleepover’ for customers in its Piccadilly branch in October 2014 after a customer was accidentally trapped in the Trafalgar Square branch after closing. Accounts for 2014 saw operating income losses narrow to £3.8 million, but sales slip by 5.9%.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the allegations, Sony stated that the game was not based on reality, and they believed they had adequate permissions necessary. They later added that the game was purely entertainment and fictional, comparing it to the television programme Doctor Who. Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair commented that though companies should have more responsibility and sensitivity to the feelings of others, the issue would be immensely difficult. Although the copyright concerns were found to <b>be</b> <b>without</b> merit, Sony offered a formal apology to the Church of England and leaders of the cathedral in July 2007, stating {{that they did not}} intend to cause offence.|$|E
5|$|Post {{is where}} {{mainstream}} music could have gone. While modern chart music hasn't gone there entirely, Björk {{opened up the}} space for a more enigmatic and less readily labelled style; she undoubtedly helped broaden the playing field. Modern music still, regularly, finds itself, like a dinosaur stuck in a tar pit, going nowhere and heading for extinction. Yet, there are pockets of air that artists like Björk - and those before her like Kate Bush - have pumped full of oxygen for the next generations of rare, raw and intense female talents - the Lordes and Sias of the world - to breath. In this way, the album title is a misnomer. Björk was a precursor rather than a late comer, less post than pre. Post stands today as {{a body of work}} that still informs the more marginal artistic fringes of modern music and reminds us how narrow and staid our world would <b>be</b> <b>without</b> outliers like Björk.|$|E

5|$|Priestley’s son, William, {{now living}} in Philadelphia, was {{increasingly}} embarrassed by his father's actions. He confronted his father, expressing John and Benjamin Vaughan’s unease, his own wife's concerns about Elizabeth Ryland-Priestley's dietary care, and his own concerns at the closeness of Elizabeth Ryland-Priestley and Thomas Cooper's relationship, and their adverse influence on Dr Priestley; but this only led to a further estrangement between William and his sister-in-law. When, a while later, Priestley's household suffered a bout of food poisoning, perhaps from milk sickness or a bacterial infection, Elizabeth Ryland-Priestley, falsely accused William of having poisoned the family's flour. Although this allegation has {{attracted the attention of}} some modern historians, it is believed to <b>be</b> <b>without</b> foundation.|$|E

One of his supporters, Ivan of Krk, laid siege to Novigrad Castle with the assistance of a Venetian fleet, which was under the command of Giovanni Barbarigo. They captured the castle and liberated Mary on 4June 1387. She was especially grateful to Barbarigo; she knighted him and granted an annuity of 600 golden florins to him.|$|E
5|$|Aquinas {{supported}} Augustine's {{view that}} evil is a privation of goodness, maintaining that evil has existence as a privation intrinsically found in good. The {{existence of this}} evil, Aquinas believed, can be completely explained by free will. Faced with the assertion that humans {{would have been better}} off without free will, he argued that the possibility of sin is necessary for a perfect world, and so individuals are responsible for their sin. Good is the cause of evil, but only owing to fault on the part of the agent. In his theodicy, to say something is evil is to say that it lacks goodness which means that it could not be part of God's creation, because God's creation lacked nothing. Aquinas noted that, although goodness makes evil possible, it does not necessitate evil. This means that God (who is good) is not cast as the cause of evil, because evil arises out of a defect in an agent, and God is seen to <b>be</b> <b>without</b> defect. Philosopher Eleonore Stump, considering Aquinas' commentary on the Book of Job, argues that Aquinas has a positive view of suffering: it is necessary to contrast Earth with heaven and remind humans that they still have the propensity to commit evil. Aquinas believed that evil is acceptable because of the good that comes from it, and that evil can only be justified when it is required in order for good to occur. Attempting to relieve God of responsibility for the occurrence of evil, Aquinas insisted that God merely permits evil to happen, rather than willing it. He recognised the occurrence of what seems to be evil, but did not attribute to it the same level of existence that he attributed to spirituality. Like Augustine, Aquinas asserted that humans bear responsibility for evil owing to their abuse of free will.|$|E
