40|$|We have {{demonstrated}} the successful fabrication of the monolithic integration of a GaAs metalsemiconductor field-effect transistor (MESFET), an AlGaAs/InGaAs laser and a p-n photodetector grown on a SiO 2 <b>backcoated</b> p-Si substrate using selective regrowth by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). The use of SiO 2 <b>backcoated</b> Si substrate is effective in suppressing unintentional Si autodoping and obtaining a good pinch-off GaAs MESFET. The MESFET with 2. 5400 ?m 2 gate exhibited a transconductance of 90 mS/mm and a threshold voltage of 2. 2 V. The reliability of the laser on the Si substrate can be improved by the strain-relieved AlGaAs/InGaAs laser with the InGaAs intermediate layer. The longest lifetime of the laser is 8 h at 27. During the GaAs layer growth, the p-n photodetector is formed near {{the surface of the}} p-Si substrate by diffusing the As atoms...|$|R

50|$|Artisan papers such as unryu, lokta, hanji, gampi, kozo, saa, and abaca {{have long}} fibers {{and are often}} {{extremely}} strong. As these papers are floppy to start with, they are often <b>backcoated</b> or resized with methylcellulose or wheat paste before folding. Also, these papers are extremely thin and compressible, allowing for thin, narrowed limbs {{as in the case}} of insect models.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Time to {{ignition}} {{of fifteen}} samples of upholstery fabrics under {{various levels of}} radiant heat flux was determined, using an ignita-bility test method at the University of San Francisco. The cotton and rayon fabrics exhibited the shortest times to ignition. Fabric weight and <b>backcoating</b> {{did not appear to}} have a significant effect in this limited study...|$|E
30|$|If the FR coating {{is applied}} to the inside face of the cover fabric as a <b>backcoating,</b> there may be little impact to the fabric aesthetics. However, when applied to the outside face or to both sides of the cover fabric, the fabric color, feel, and {{stiffness}} may be significantly altered. Although the aesthetics of laminated/coated fabrics may not be as desirable, these fabrics are often used to comply with the more stringent high occupant dwelling flammability regulations (e.g., Cal TB 133, Cal TB 129). In the UK, backcoated FR cover fabrics are considered to take about 80 % of the soft furnishing market ([Horrocks et al. 2007]). While FR coated cover fabrics self-extinguish and exhibit limited flame spread, they do not perform well when exposed to large ignition sources even for a short duration as they have a tendency to form brittle chars that crack open and expose the more flammable core materials. Research has shown that FR <b>backcoating</b> improves resistance to small flames like match and BS: Crib 5 (17 [*]±[*] 1 [*]g of wood), but when tested with large ignition sources as in Cal TB 133 or CFR 1633, the increased heat release of the <b>backcoating</b> results in accelerated thermal decomposition of the underlying PUF ([Gallagher 1993]). As discussed previously, it is these types of unexpected interactions between the components resulting in a synergistic or antagonistic impact on pyrolysis that makes it difficult to predict soft furnishing flammability based on the flammability characteristics of the individual components.|$|E
30|$|A typical FR <b>backcoating</b> {{formulation}} {{used for}} upholstered cover fabrics consists of FRs (typically halogen-antimony-containing compounds), fillers, synergists and application ancillaries (e.g., polymeric resin binder, fabric softeners, and cross linking agents). Halogen-antimony FRs {{are most frequently}} used because they are very effective for both synthetic and natural fiber containing fabrics and have relatively low cost ([Weil & Levchik 2008]). A halogen-containing polymer, combined with vinyl fluoride and finely dispersed antimony oxide, is commonly used for heavily used applications such as healthcare mattresses and mass transportation seating because it is significantly {{more difficult for the}} halogen to leach out when it is bound to a polymer rather than as a small molecule additive ([Nazare 2009]). A drawback limiting this application is that halogenated polymers often require a plasticizer and softening agents during processing, which can result in antagonistic reactions with other components of furniture ([Schumann & Hartzell 1989]) and itself may be a fuel for pyrolysis. Moreover, halogen and antimony containing molecules in <b>backcoating</b> formulations are of major environmental concern and this is currently driving changes in backcoated FR textiles. Other flame retardant strategies that have been explored for FR textiles include removal of heat by using compounds that undergo endothermic phase change and generate water upon heating (e.g. aluminum trihydrate, inorganic and organic phosphorus compounds), decreased formation of flammable volatiles and enhanced char formation (phosphorus- and nitrogen-containing compounds) ([Horrocks 2001]). Recent developments in <b>backcoating</b> technologies for FR textiles have been reviewed in details elsewhere ([Horrocks 1996]; [Horrocks 2008 a]).|$|E
40|$|During the 1970 's, a {{commercial}} magnetic recording tape fabricated with magnetic oxide particles, and with oxide and <b>backcoat</b> binders made from polyester urethane {{was being used}} for spacecraft tape recorders, and which would periodically manifest operational problems such as layer-to-layer adhesion, stick-slip, and shedding of sticky organic materials. These problems were generally associated with periods of high humidity. An experimental study identified that these problems resulted from hydrolysis of the polyester urethane binders...|$|R
30|$|Another {{example of}} a fire {{resistant}} laminated fabric is an aluminum foil liner constructed of a very thin layer of aluminum sandwiched between a woven fiberglass and spun fiberglass. Since these types of barrier fabrics are quite thin and flexible, they do not impart stiffness to the upholstered product when placed between the fabric and the filling. Thin layers of FR PUF laminated or <b>backcoated</b> onto various textile substrates are in use as fire barriers in mattresses and upholstered furniture. Their major drawback is cost, {{as they can be}} an order of magnitude more expensive than other fire blocking technologies.|$|R
40|$|Optical {{data storage}} tape {{is now a}} {{commercial}} reality. The world's first successful development of a digital optical tape system is complete. This {{is based on the}} Creo 1003 optical tape recorder with ICI 1012 write-once optical tape media. Flexible optical media offers many benefits in terms of manufacture; for a given capital investment, continuous, web-coating techniques produce more square meters of media than batch coating. The coated layers consist of a <b>backcoat</b> on the non-active side; on the active side there is a subbing layer, then reflector, dye/polymer, and transparent protective overcoat. All these layers have been tailored for ease of manufacture and specific functional characteristics...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Acrylic latex {{polymers}} {{which are}} widely used as backcoatings for fabrics dielectrically heat sealed in automotive interior trim constructions can cause arcing on nylon-containing fabrics during heat sealing. Arcing causes fabric charring. Most nylon fabrics, because of their polar and hydroscopic nature, are prone to arcing. A latex <b>backcoating</b> can aggravage this problem further. This talk discusses several new acrylic latexes developed for arc resistant backcoatings for nylon fabric, presenting comparative dielec-tric heat sealing data on several nylon-containing fabrics. The role of the nonwoven plumper pad adhesive (usually a preplasticized PVC latex) used in the interior trim construc-tions is also discussed...|$|E
40|$|In 1981 the Bureau of Home Furnishings and Thermal Insulation began a {{study to}} {{evaluate}} the potential for cigarette ignition of residential upholstered furniture and to determine the percent of compliance with California’s manda-tory flammability regulations for materials used in upholstered furniture and the State’s labeling requirements. This paper reports the results on 700 articles of upholstered furniture. The presence of labels and compliance with Califor-nia’s furniture flammability regulations is discussed. A summary of cigarette ignitions is given. The effect of cigarette test location, cover fabric weight, fiber content, resin <b>backcoating</b> and type filling material on cigarette ignition is dis-cussed and {{the wide variety of}} material choices for cigarette ignition resistant residential upholstered furniture demonstrated...|$|E
50|$|Field Pack - The field pack, {{also known}} as Field Pack, Large With Internal Frame FPLIF or Combat Field Pack M-1990 CFP-90, is {{constructed}} of an 8.0 ounce <b>backcoated</b> nylon fabric printed in the woodland camouflage pattern which has excellent abrasion resistance and water repellency. The weight of the empty field pack is 8 pounds. The field pack has two major sections; the sleeping bag compartment, and the main compartment. The main compartment has a false bottom that may be opened for full use of the field pack when a sleeping bag is not carried. The outside of the field pack has one long tunneled pocket and two smaller cargo pockets, all using compression straps for securing contents. Equipment attachment points {{in the form of}} 2 inch 5.71 cm webbing and 1 inch 2.54 cm webbing loops are located throughout the field pack.|$|R
30|$|The main {{disadvantage}} of inherently FR fibers is their cost. To reduce fabric cost and still maintain performance, manufacturers construct fire barrier fabrics as blends with other lower cost fibers. Fiber blending may occur before or during yarn formation stage. The less expensive thermoplastics polymers are not ideal candidates for barrier materials. Barrier materials made solely from thermoplastic fibers often melt, shrink, and crack open ([Ohlemiller & Shields 1995]). Once there are {{openings in the}} barrier material the flames propagate to the PUF core, and the soft furnishing will burn {{as if there was}} no fire barrier. However, this melting can provide an advantage if the thermoplastic is combined with a network support fabric (e.g., fiberglass matting or any char forming fiber fabric), as the thermoplastic can fill the voids of the network and thereby form a strong and durable fire blocking system ([Ohlemiller & Shields 1995]). Another alternative is to use FR thermoplastic fibers in conjunction with non-thermoplastic char forming fibers or thermoplastic fiber fabric <b>backcoated</b> with a char forming FR coating.|$|R
