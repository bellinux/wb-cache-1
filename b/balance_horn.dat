40|$|The {{estimation}} of elevator hinge moment derivatives and the stick-free neutral point of NAL Light Aircraft Conf. 1 (NALLA- 1) is detailed in this report. These have been estimated using ESDU data sheets. <b>Horn</b> <b>balance</b> effects and suitable <b>horn</b> <b>balance</b> for minimising the neutral point shift are also estimated...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact on}} {{stability}} {{and control of}} small general aviation aircraft, resulting from ice accumulation on the elevator <b>horn</b> <b>balance,</b> is investigated using an experimental data set. The purpose {{is to determine the}} linear and non-linear coupling mechanisms between the ice-induced unsteady flow field and the structural response of the elevator <b>horn</b> <b>balance.</b> The linear and quadratic relations between the two unsteady systems are obtained by employing higher-order statistical signal processing based on a non-orthogonal, second-order, single-input/single-output Volterra model. In this way the frequency- and angle of attack ranges, for which lock-in occurs, are identified for different ice configurations on the leading edges of the elevator <b>horn</b> <b>balances</b> and its deflection angle.

50|$|The Ar 77 had a thick {{cantilevered}} wooden wing, {{which was}} skinned with plywood on the undersurfaces {{and covered with}} fabric on the upper surfaces. The fuselage was built up from welded steel tubing covered with fabric. Tail surfaces were built up from steel tubing and were also fabric-covered, not following Arado's trademark layout of a fin and rudder forward of the tailplane. Instead the tailplane was high-mounted on the fin and supported by steel tube 'N' struts. Elevators and rudder were covered with fabric, aerodynamically balanced in the Ar 77A and without aerodynamic <b>balance</b> <b>horns</b> in the Ar 77B. The fixed tailwheel undercarriage consisted of cantilevered oleo-pneumatic main leg struts fitted with brakes and a tailwheel under the rear fuselage. The four crew members, being pilot, navigator or instructor, and two students, were accommodated in a cabin with full-length windows along the fuselage sides.|$|R
50|$|The IS-23 was an {{all-metal}} aircraft. It {{had a high}} {{cantilever wing}} with constant chord inboard and slight taper beyond with almost square tips. The wing was equipped with various high lift devices to achieve the required STOL capability. The tail surfaces were constant chord and straight tipped, though the fin and rudder were slightly swept. The tailplane was mounted {{on top of the}} fuselage. The rudder was <b>horn</b> <b>balanced,</b> fitted with a trim tab and cut away at the bottom to allow movement of the single piece elevator, also <b>horn</b> <b>balanced.</b>|$|R
50|$|Structurally {{similar to}} the J.I the J.II {{introduced}} ailerons aerodynamically <b>balanced</b> by large <b>horn</b> extensions at the wing-tips, increased fin area to improve directional stability and a re-located aileron link strut.|$|R
50|$|V-tail {{surfaces}} {{were carried}} {{at the end}} of the tail-boom at an angle of 114° to each other with push rods operating the large <b>horn</b> <b>balanced</b> ruddervators for yaw control as well as pitch.|$|R
50|$|The {{fuselage}} of the Amiot 130, {{built around}} four longerons, {{was long and}} slender, with a rounded upper surface. Its vertical tail was oval. The horizontal tail was straight-tapered but the elevators had prominent <b>horn</b> <b>balances.</b>|$|R
50|$|An {{improved}} {{version of}} the J.I was developed as the AEG J.II, which had aerodynamically balanced ailerons with overhanging <b>horn</b> <b>balances,</b> extended rear fuselage with a larger fin to improve directional stability and a re-located aileron link strut.|$|R
50|$|FFV Aerotech BA-14 Starling: Side-by-side {{version with}} 48 kW (65 hp) Rotax 532 engine. Wing span {{increased}} by 1.0 m. (3 ft 3 in) with more rounded tips. Flaps added. Tailplane span also increased and tips rounded, with <b>horn</b> <b>balanced</b> elevators.|$|R
50|$|The G3 Mirage first flew on 20 September 1997 {{with the}} lower powered Rotax. The first {{production}} aircraft also used this engine but had some small horizontal control surface modifications plus {{the addition of a}} <b>horn</b> <b>balance</b> to the rudder.|$|R
25|$|The Beagle was a single-bay biplane with {{staggered}} {{and slightly}} swept wings. The fabric-covered wings, {{which did not}} fold as the aircraft was not intended for carrier service, had spruce spars and ribs with metal bracing. Four ailerons were fitted. The fuselage followed standard Blackburn practice with a steel tube centre section and wooden construction aft, though the final section was again of tube steel; covering was fabric throughout. Fin area was small and the rudder large, with a <b>horn</b> <b>balance</b> initially merging into the fin but later reduced, leaving a prominent step {{similar to that of}} the Blackburn Nautilus. The braced tailplane had significantly greater elevator than stabiliser area, the former also having prominent <b>horn</b> <b>balances.</b>|$|R
50|$|The IAR.22 was a wooden, low-wing {{monoplane}} with a fixed conventional undercarriage, seating two in tandem, open cockpits. The wings {{were built}} around two spruce box spars, with plywood webs; plywood covered the whole wing {{except for the}} fabric trailing edges. In plan, the wings were straight-tapered, {{with most of the}} taper on the trailing edge, but with rounded tips. The wing trailing edge carried ailerons but no flaps. The tailplane was also straight-tapered, though with the taper more equally distributed between leading and trailing edges. The elevators were split, with a cut-out for rudder movement, and were <b>horn</b> <b>balanced.</b> The fin was also straight-edged but the broad rudder, also <b>horn</b> <b>balanced,</b> had a curved trailing edge.|$|R
50|$|On 15 June 1936, K4049 {{conducted}} its {{maiden flight}} from Brooklands. Vickers chief test pilot Joseph Summers flew K4049 {{on its first}} flight, accompanied by Wallis and Trevor Westbrook. The aircraft soon came to be largely regarded as being an advanced design for its era and proved to have considerable merit during its flight trials. In April 1937, K4049 was destroyed by an accident during a service test flight. The cause was {{the failure of the}} elevator's <b>horn</b> <b>balance</b> due to excessive slipstream exposure, leading to the aircraft inverting and rapidly descending into terrain. It was completely destroyed in the crash, which also had resulted in the death of the navigator. The <b>horn</b> <b>balances</b> would later be deleted, and thus not feature on production aircraft.|$|R
50|$|The Parrot's wire-braced {{empennage}} is conventional. The vertical {{surfaces are}} large, angular and slightly swept. Its horizontal surfaces are rectangular in plan, {{with a small}} tailplane carrying a much larger, one-piece elevator hinged well behind the rudder trailing edge. Both rudder and elevator are <b>horn</b> <b>balanced.</b>|$|R
60|$|During {{the drive}} to Richmond this irrepressible desire to amuse himself {{got the better of}} him more than once or twice. Through Kensington he {{attracted}} a certain amount of attention by <b>balancing</b> the <b>horn</b> upon his nose. At Kew he stopped the coach to request of a young ladies' boarding school change for sixpence. At the foot of Richmond Hill he caused a crowd to assemble while trying to persuade a deaf old gentleman in a Bath-chair to allow his man to race us up the hill for a shilling.|$|R
5000|$|The {{wings of}} the G3 Mirage have a {{constant}} chord centre section with straight tapered outer panels. The inboard sections carry electrically operated flaps. There is a single lift strut on each side, attached to the lower fuselage. Behind the cabin the fuselage is slender and carries a low set, straight tapered tailplane with <b>horn</b> <b>balanced</b> elevators. The fin and rudder are straight edged and sharply tapered, the latter <b>horn</b> <b>balanced</b> and ending {{at the top of}} the fuselage. There is a small underfin. [...] The GX version introduced a long, integrated dorsal fin. The G3 Mirage has a tricycle undercarriage with cantilever legs mounted to the fuselage and with faired wheels. [...] The Remos is somewhat unusual among modern certificated/LSA aircraft in that it can be flown with the doors removed.|$|R
50|$|Like all Junkers duralumin-structured designs, {{from the}} 1918 J 7 to the 1932 Ju 46, (some 35 models), it used an {{aluminium}} alloy (duralumin) structure entirely covered with Junkers' characteristic corrugated and stressed duralumin skin. Internally, the wing was built up on nine circular cross-section duralumin spars with transverse bracing. All control surfaces were <b>horn</b> <b>balanced.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Brian Olewnick stated [...] "Barbecue Dog doesn't quite reach the {{explosive}} heights of its predecessor, but {{is arguably the}} next best item in Jackson's discography. The band strikes a comfortable <b>balance</b> between the <b>horns</b> and the electric instruments, allowing each to surface when needed, and also compliments the required barnburners with more contemplative pieces".|$|R
40|$|A wind-tunnel {{investigation}} of <b>horn</b> <b>balances</b> on a 45 degree sweptback, semispan, horizontal tail surface {{was made to}} determine the effects of horn size and inboard-edge fairing at a Mach number of 0. 30 and {{to determine the effects}} of compressibility up to a Mach number of 0. 89. Presented are lift, drag, pitching-moment, and hinge-moment data and lift and hinge-moment parameters...|$|R
2500|$|Its {{fuselage}} was a pine framed, plywood covered hexagonal box, {{with the}} straight edged fin an integral part. The rudder was rounded and <b>horn</b> <b>balanced.</b> [...] Though the rudder was wood framed and covered, the tailplane, mounted {{just above the}} fuselage and externally braced from below, had a tube steel structure and was fabric covered. The elevators were balanced by an elastic rope to the control column.|$|R
25|$|The {{fuselage}} of the AB 1 was flat-sided, with a narrowed but flat topped decking. There was a gunner's {{position in}} the extreme nose fitted with a 7.7mm machine gun on a TO 4 mounting. The fuselage tapered rearwards with the cantilever tailplane, which carried separate elevators, mounted on top. The fin carried a <b>horn</b> <b>balanced</b> rudder which extended {{down to the bottom}} of the fuselage, moving between the elevators.|$|R
5000|$|All Menestrel {{variants}} are wooden {{framed and}} fabric covered. The wing {{is built around}} a single spar and has constant chord to mid span, with semi-elliptical outer panels. There are no flaps fitted on the single seat variants, though they are an option on the Menestrel II. [...] The fin and rudder are curved, the rudder having a <b>horn</b> <b>balance.</b> The tailplane is mounted {{on the top of}} the fuselage.|$|R
25|$|Despite the {{instability}} and without having received a Jupiter-powered Badger, the Air Board were sufficiently encouraged by this engine's promise {{to order a}} fourth, fully armed Badger with this powerplant. After some testing, the rudder was modified with a <b>horn</b> <b>balance</b> and larger ailerons were fitted. This aircraft was the sole Badger II and was loaned by the Air Board to Bristol {{for the development of}} the Jupiter and its cowling during 1920-1.|$|R

2500|$|The A1's {{construction}} was delayed by funding problems: though design work began in 1968, {{the first flight}} was not made until 1976. By mid-1977 some 40 hours had been flown under {{the power of a}} 156kW (210hp) Rolls-Royce Continental IO-360-D. [...] This was then replaced with a 209kW (280hp) Lycoming IO-540-D (Special) driving a three blade propeller which markedly improved the performance. Revised ailerons were fitted, the rudder <b>horn</b> <b>balanced</b> and heightened.|$|R

50|$|The {{rest of the}} Wanderlust was plywood skinned, with a cockpit {{which could}} be open or {{enclosed}} in a bubble hood. The fuselage tapered aft, with the tailplane mounted on top and the small fin behind it. The elevators, with individual trim tabs, moved {{either side of the}} fin and the rudder was hinged behind their trailing edges. Both elevators and rudder were <b>horn</b> <b>balanced.</b> The Wanderlust landed on a pneumatically-mounted central skid.|$|R
50|$|The wing has {{constant}} chord, turned-down {{tips and}} 2° of washout. It is braced by pairs of V-struts {{attached to the}} lower fuselage longerons forward of the cabin. Four-position Fowler flaps are fitted. The tailplane and elevators are rectangular in plan, with a cutout in the latter to allow rudder movement. Fin and rudder are likewise rectangular apart from the leading edge, which has a curved fillet. Both rudder and elevators are <b>horn</b> <b>balanced.</b>|$|R

50|$|The Fokker V.4 was a {{prototype}} German fighter aircraft of World War I. Inspired by the successful Sopwith Triplane, Anthony Fokker chose {{to create a}} triplane fighter. Reinhold Platz {{was responsible for the}} design. The V.4 looked very much like the later Dr.I, but is easily recognized by the lack of interplane struts. All three wings were cantilever and the lower two wings had the same span. The rudder was balanced, but the ailerons and elevators lacked <b>horn</b> <b>balances.</b>|$|R

40|$|At {{the request}} of the Air Materiel Command, Army Air Forces, flight tests were {{conducted}} on a P- 5 lD- 20 -NA (AAF No. 44 - 63826) airplane equipped with a horn-balanced rudder. This rudder was fitted with an unbalancing tab as was the original product fan rudder. Tests were made both with the unbalancing tab in operation and with the unbalancing tab locked. The modification to the original vertical tail consisted of removing the cap {{from the top of the}} fin and adding 1. 91 square feet of area to the rudder as the <b>horn</b> <b>balance</b> and 0. 82 square foot of area to the top of the rudder aft of the hinge line. A comparison of the directional stability and control characteristics of the P- 51 D airplane with three different vertical-tail configurations - the <b>horn</b> <b>balance,</b> original production, and extended tail (with unbalancing tab locked) configurations are presented herein. The tests of the horn-balanced rudder were conducted at the Langley Laboratory in 1945. The tests of the original-tail configuration were previously conducted at the Ames Aeronautical Laboratory. Tests of the extended-tail configuration were conducted at the Langley Laboratory and are reported...|$|R
2500|$|The D.6 was {{a single}} bay biplane with pairs of parallel, outward leaning interplane struts. There was no stagger on the leading edges, though the lower wing was smaller both in span and chord. [...] Each upper wing tip was {{supported}} over the fuselage by a N-form strut, one foot at mid-fuselage and the forward one higher. [...] The lower wing was conventionally attached to the lower fuselage. [...] The half span, broad and <b>horn</b> <b>balanced</b> ailerons were on the upper wing only.|$|R
