40|$|This {{paper offers}} a {{detailed}} {{assessment of the}} Balassa-Samuelson (<b>BS)</b> <b>effect</b> in eight Central and Eastern European countries (CEEC 8). Several features distinguish this study from others: First, we investigate a variety of specifications of extended models. Non-homogeneity of wages, deviations from PPP in tradables and demand side variables are found to importantly contribute to explain inflation differentials. Second, a variety of specifications is investigated. Third, we rely upon bootstrap inference for panel unit root and panel cointegration analysis. The bootstrap results are rather clear: No evidence for cointegration remains when resorting to bootstrap inference. To quantify the bias that may arise from incorrectly using cointegration techniques, we also quantify the <b>BS</b> <b>effect</b> from equations containing (nonstationary) "cointegration" terms. Fourth, we present inflation simulations based on well specified scenarios. The results are as follows: Evidence for the <b>BS</b> <b>effect</b> is found. The <b>BS</b> <b>effect</b> is, however, rather small (around half a percent per annum) and not sufficient to explain the observed inflation differentials between the CEEC 8 and the EU 11. Using, despite the lacking evidence, cointegration techniques results throughout in substantially larger estimated effects. This suggests that studies relying upon cointegration may have overestimated the <b>BS</b> <b>effect.</b> The additional explanatory variables in the extended BS models allow for a satisfactory modelling of the observed inflation rates. The mean inflation simulations for the CEEC 8 countries, based on the extended models, range from 2. 77 % for the Slovak Republic to 6. 75 % for Poland. These are well above the 2 % inflation objective for the European Monetary UnionBalassa-Samuelson effect; Central and Eastern Europe; transition economies; non-stationary panels; bootstrapping; inflation simulations...|$|E
40|$|This paper examines, using various models {{including}} a non-linear one, that the Balassa-Samuelson (<b>BS)</b> <b>effect</b> {{can account for}} the persistence of deviations from PPP in the long-run movements of won/dollar and won/yen real exchange rates. In test for PPP hypothesis that incorporates the <b>BS</b> <b>effect,</b> using the generalized Johansen' cointegration method, {{it is found that}} a cointegration relationship exists between each of won/dollar and won/yen real exchange rate and the productivity variables of two countries. And in test for PPP hypothesis that incorporates other fundamentals such as cumulative current account balance, foreign exchange reserve, terms of trade as well as productivity differentials, using a behavioral equilibrium exchange rate approach, it is found that a cointegration relationship exists between each of won/dollar and won/yen real exchange rate and all of these fundamentals. However, the plus sign of the estimated coefficient of the productivity differentials variable, which means that domestic productivity improvement produces increase in each of won/dollar and won/yen real exchange rate is not coincident with the result that the <b>BS</b> <b>effect</b> expects theoretically. Finally, in test for PPP hypothesis that incorporates the <b>BS</b> <b>effect,</b> using a non-linear STAR model, it is found that the adjustment process in case of won/dollar real exchange rate from the long-run equilibrium level can be adequately explained by a non-linear LSTAR model. But, the evidence of diagnostic statistics, which shows the existence of autocorrelation of the residuals in most of lags, might suggest the inadequacy of LSTAR model specification...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{importance}} of analysing inflation sources and dynamics in Bulgaria is imposed by (i) {{the long run}} process of price and inflation convergence to the Euro area and (ii) by the Currency Board operating in the country. In this study we make an attempt to estimate Balassa- Samuelson (<b>BS)</b> <b>effect</b> in Bulgaria (after {{the introduction of the}} Currency Board). The BS explanation of inflation (or dual inflation) has acquired both academic recognition and popularity in practice in the recent years. The results of our empirical estimation do not provide a robust verification of the existence of <b>BS</b> <b>effect</b> in spite of the observed prerequisites and the accompanying economic indicators interrelations. Actually there are several factors that interfere with the <b>BS</b> <b>effect</b> lying in the wage convergence process in both sectors and others that influence productivity developments in the sectors. This prompts that the price movement in the country has other driving motions – above all wage setting and incomplete price liberalization, other factors productivity, imported inflation (pass trough) and inflation generated by the temporary gaps between money demand and money supply.

40|$|Transition Economies {{appear to}} be subject to the Balassa-Samuelson (<b>BS)</b> <b>effect</b> in many studies. This implies that their {{currencies}} experience a prolonged appreciation in real terms as their convergence goes on. However, in the existing literature, little attention has been given to the relation between the capital account and the <b>BS</b> <b>effect.</b> In this paper we show that the significance of the latter depends crucially on the composition of the capital account. Long-run investment (FDI) enhances productivity, while porfolio investment (PI) leaves the latter unaffected. We show that the larger the FDI relative to PI, the greater the contribution of productivity in the determination of the real exchange rate in the long-run. This is not the case, though when FDI and PI move close to each other, as a percentage of GDP. We find that a long-run relationship exists between the real exchange rate, productivity differential, the real interest rate differential and the capital account. Moreover, those variables cointegrate in a nonlinear fashion...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we try to}} give a summary on the {{importance}} of the productivity based real appreciation e. g. the Balassa-Samuelson (<b>BS)</b> <b>effect</b> in five Central and Eastern European (CEC 5) countries, namely the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, the Slovak Republic, and Slovenia. We develop our approach from two directions. Firstly, we try to apply a common simple analytical framework for producing some stylised facts, and obtaining a “guesstimate” of relative price movements due to different sectoral productivity growth rates. Secondly, we try to summarise the econometric evidence available for the countries, both from individual country and panel estimates. It seems clear from the analyses, that both approaches gives a size of the <b>BS</b> <b>effect</b> not exceeding 2 % per annum on CPI inflation vis-à-vis Germany. The numbers obtained are somewhat different, that one would conclude from the change in relative prices in the countries considered. This result might be explained by the fact, that the BS hypotheses did not hold exactly in the past, other factors like change in the sectoral wage rates, pricing behaviour and indermediate product prices also contributed to the behaviour of the nontradable and tradable price ratio. As these estimates are based on past data, when productivity differentials were higher than current figures, it is very likely, that as the catch-up goes by, the possible magnitude of the effect will be even smaller. From this one might conclude that real convergence should not necessary danger the fulfilment of the Maastricht Treaty Criteria on inflation. ...|$|E

Moreover, there is also evidence that the effect has been declining through time as Greek standards of living have caught up on those in the rest of the world and as the non-tradeables sector within Greece catches up with the tradeables.

40|$|High {{growth in}} the South-East Asian {{countries}} {{for the past three}} decades should imply high increases in productivity to reveal the Balassa-Samuelson (<b>BS)</b> <b>effect</b> of high growth accompanied by real exchange rate (RER) appreciation. This paper examines the effects of productivity increases by developing a robust unrestricted error correction model (UECM) of RER based on a class of theories of time-varying equilibrium exchange rates as opposed to the conventional PPP-based theory. An empirical study was carried out on four selected Southeast Asian countries: Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand. This work suggests that the effects of productivity increases may be more complicated than what the theory suggests and points to the possibility that the Balassa-Samuelson is affected by the stage of economic development rather than mere productivity increases...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The Balassa-Samuelson (<b>BS)</b> <b>effect</b> {{is usually}} {{considered}} {{as the prime}} explanation of the continuous real exchange rate appreciation of the central and east European (CEE) transition countries against their western European counterparts. This paper tries to explain relative price differentials observed {{over the past decade}} between four CEE economies - Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland - and Euro area in terms of productivity growth differentials. Using panel estimation techniques, we find strong empirical evidence in favour of the BS hypothesis. Furthermore, relaxing some of the assumptions (i. e. PPP holds for tradable goods) results in little support of BS hypothesis. Our estimates of the BS term suggest that the Balassa-Samuelson effect in these 4 CEE countries {{does not have to be}} as sizeable as other studies propose. ...|$|E

40|$|The Balassa and Samuelson {{hypothesis}} [...] BS [...] (Balassa, 1964, Samuelson, 1964), which natural {{point of}} departure is the Salter-Swan (dependent economy) model is analysed. It offers general theoretical justification of the long-run trends in real exchange rates in relation to productivities and prices. This is to say, that taking into consideration the important real world feature of having both tradable and non-tradable goods BS states that if a given country’s productivity in producing tradable goods compared to its productivity in making non-tradable goods and services rises more rapidly than in a (certain) foreign country, then the home country real exchange rate will experience appreciation. Thus if productivity of factors of production grows faster in the home country tradable sector, then relative price in the non-tradable sector should rise.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} Balassa-Samuelson {{effect in the}} Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia. Time series and panel cointegration {{techniques}} are used {{to show that the}} <b>BS</b> <b>effect</b> works reasonably well in these transition economies during the period 1991 :Q 1 to 2001 :Q 2. However, productivity growth does not fully translate into price in-creases due to the structure of CPI indexes. We thus argue that productivity growth will not hinder the ability of the five EU accession candidates to meet the Maastricht criterion on inflation in the medium term. Moreover, the observed appreciation of the CPI-deflated real exchange rate is found to be systematically higher compared to the real appreciation justi-fied by the Balassa-Samuelson effect, particularly in the cases of the Czech Republic and Slovakia. This may be partly explained by the trend appreciation of the tradable-goods-price-based real exchange rate, increases in non-tradable sector prices due to price liberali-sation and demand-side pressures, and the evolution of the nominal exchange rate due to the exchange rate regime and magnitude of capital inflows.
