Rabbi Gavriel Holtzberg, who had conducted Sabbath services on the previous day and also held religious discourses at the Knesset Eliyahoo, was killed, {{along with his wife}} and a few other Jews at the Nariman House, a community center operated by Chabad.

Soon, the concept of preserving the honour of the national flag became an integral component of the independence struggle. While Muslims were still wary of the Swaraj flag, it gained acceptance among Muslim leaders of the Congress and the Khilafat Movement as the national flag.|$|E
5|$|The {{house sparrow}} is monogamous, and {{typically}} mates for life. Birds from pairs often engage in extra-pair copulations, so about 15% of house sparrow fledglings are unrelated to their mother's mate. Male house sparrows guard their mates carefully {{to avoid being}} cuckolded, and most extra-pair copulation occurs away from nest sites. Males may sometimes have multiple mates, and bigamy is mostly limited by aggression between females. Many birds do not find a nest and a mate, and instead may serve as helpers around the nest for mated pairs, a role which increases the chances of being chosen to replace a lost mate. Lost mates of both sexes can be replaced quickly during the breeding season. The formation of a pair and the <b>bond</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two birds {{is tied to the}} holding of a nest site, though paired house sparrows can recognise each other away from the nest.|$|E

5|$|The {{most ancient}} polyadenylating enzyme is polynucleotide phosphorylase. This enzyme {{is part of}} both the {{bacterial}} degradosome and the archaeal exosome, two closely related complexes that recycle RNA into nucleotides. This enzyme degrades RNA by attacking the <b>bond</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> 3'-most nucleotides with a phosphate, breaking off a diphosphate nucleotide. This reaction is reversible, and so the enzyme can also extend RNA with more nucleotides. The heteropolymeric tail added by polynucleotide phosphorylase is very rich in adenine. The choice of adenine is most likely the result of higher ADP concentrations than other nucleotides {{as a result of}} using ATP as an energy currency, making it more likely to be incorporated in this tail in early lifeforms. It has been suggested that the involvement of adenine-rich tails in RNA degradation prompted the later evolution of polyadenylate polymerases (the enzymes that produce poly(A) tails with no other nucleotides in them).|$|E
5|$|In the manga Boruto: Naruto Next Generations, Beveridge liked Sasuke's personality, {{particularly}} {{as it was}} presented during his dialogue with Naruto. Reviewing the anime adaptation, Sam Stewart from IGN was particularly impressed by the scenes between Sasuke and Sarada, most notably because of changes in Sasuke's characterization. He highlights that despite acting coldly towards his daughter, he ends up using his body as a shield {{to protect her from}} his enemy. Ken Iikura from Anime Now agreed, pointing out that Sasuke has become a loving husband and father in Boruto, despite retaining some of the dark aspects of his personality. Ikikura noted that Sasuke and Sarada's meeting in Boruto significantly developed both characters. McNulty disliked the romance between Sasuke and Sakura in the original series, because she felt it was initially an one-sided crush on Sakura's part, but she believed the spin-off manga Naruto Gaiden expanded on the <b>bond</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two and their relationship with their daughter, Sarada. Stewart praised Sasuke's portrayal as a flawed parent rather than an effortlessly good one, noting that his farewell to Sarada demonstrated his difficulty with being a good father. Another writer from Anime Now, Sarah Nelkin, noted that these episodes helped to develop Sasuke as both a father and a husband, especially when he explains to Sarada that she creates a bond between him and Sakura that persists despite his being frequently absent {{as a result of his}} mission.|$|E
5|$|Since most {{senators}} were former magistrates, {{the senate}} became bound {{together by a}} strong sense of collegiality. At any given point in time, many of the senate's most senior members were ex-Consuls, which facilitated the creation of a <b>bond</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> presiding Consul and those senior members. In addition, the Consul was always chosen from senate, and as such he usually held similar ideals as did his fellow senators. When his annual term ended, he returned to their ranks, and so he was unlikely to stand against his fellow senators. Before the enactment of the Ovinian Law, Consuls appointed new senators, but after the enactment of this law, Censors appointed new senators, which caused the senate to become even more independent of the presiding Consul. In addition, the Ovinian Law all but required that ex-magistrates be appointed to the senate, and as such, the process by which Censors appointed new members to the senate became quite objective. This further enhanced the competence, and thus the prestige, of the senate.|$|E
40|$|The FT-IR/ATR {{technique}} has been {{employed in the}} investigation of the forces leading to the organization of a number of polymeric materials exhibiting thermotropic liquid crystalline character. Two types of compounds have been studied, i. e., one bearing the carboxylic polar group near the main chain and the other {{at the end of the}} side chain. Intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen <b>bonding</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> carboxylic groups was found to lead to the formation of ''facing'' and ''sideways'' structures. Enhanced stability of these supramolecular structures was obtained by the presence of intramolecular hydrogen <b>bonds</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> amide groups, resulting in the formation of smectic phases. Furthermore, it has been found that the strengthening of hydrogen <b>bonding</b> <b>between</b> carboxylic groups is associated with a weakening of hydrogen <b>bonds</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> amide groups...|$|R

5|$|Starting in 1999, a live {{production}} of Blue's Clues toured the U.S. to positive reviews. Johnson compared the show's audience participation {{with that of}} The Rocky Horror Picture Show. As of 2002, over 2 million people had attended over 1,000 performances. The creators of the TV show were involved {{in all aspects of}} the live show, aiming to translate the <b>bond</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> TV show's audience and its cast to the stage and to provide young audiences with their first theatrical experience. The creators chose Jonathan Hochwald as the live show's producer, Gip Hoppe as its director, and Dave Gallo as its set designer. Neither Hoppe nor Gallo had any previous experience in children's theater. Nick Balaban and Michael Rubin, who wrote the music for the TV show, composed the live show's soundtrack. The producers were concerned with children's response to the host, who was played by Tom Mizer (a different actor than the host of the TV show), but his young audience enthusiastically accepted and embraced him. Actors were encouraged to improvise and respond to the audience, which resulted in changes throughout the show's run. The show's script included humor that both children and their parents could enjoy.|$|E
