50|$|<b>Differential</b> <b>braking</b> {{depends on}} {{asymmetric}} {{application of the}} brakes on the main gear wheels to turn the aircraft. For this, the aircraft must be equipped with separate controls for {{the right and left}} brakes (usually on the rudder pedals).

In aircraft with several methods of <b>steering</b> that include <b>differential</b> <b>braking,</b> <b>differential</b> <b>braking</b> may be avoided because of the wear it puts on the <b>braking</b> mechanisms. <b>Differential</b> <b>braking</b> has the advantage of being largely independent of any movement or skidding of the nose or tailwheel.|$|R
25|$|Following the {{prototype}} were three Model A45T aircraft, {{the first two}} with the same engine as {{the prototype}} and the third with a Continental E-225, which {{would prove to be}} close to the production version. Production did not begin until 1953, when Beechcraft began delivering T-34As to the United States Air Force (USAF) and similar Model B45 aircraft for export. Production of the T-34B for the United States Navy (USN) began in 1955, this version featuring a number of changes reflecting the different requirements of the two services. The T-34B had only <b>differential</b> <b>braking</b> for <b>steering</b> control on the ground instead of nosewheel steering, additional wing dihedral and, to cater for the different heights of pilots, adjustable rudder pedals instead of the moveable seats of the T-34A. T-34A production was completed in 1956, with T-34Bs being built until October 1957 and licensed B45 versions built in Canada (125 manufactured by Canadian Car and Foundry), Japan (173 built by Fuji Heavy Industries), and Argentina (75 by FMA) until 1958. Beechcraft delivered the last Model B45s in 1959. Total production of the Continental-engined versions in the US and abroad was 1,904 aircraft.|$|R

25|$|The triple {{differential}} is {{a modification}} to the double <b>differential,</b> replacing the <b>steering</b> clutches {{with a single}} <b>braked</b> <b>differential</b> similar to controlled differential. This third differential produces any desired output speed in the steering shaft, compared to the double differential where {{the speed of the}} shaft is fixed. This output drives the steering idlers of an otherwise unchanged double differential, producing continuously variable steering. It has all the advantages of the double differential, with the only disadvantage is that the brake on the third differential dissipates some energy while slipping, but this is dependent only on the amount of energy being used to steer the vehicle, not the total energy being delivered to the tracks.|$|R
2500|$|The T1E5, {{introduced}} {{around the}} same time as the T1E4, was yet another conversion of a T1E1, in this case with a new steering system.

The T1E5 replaced this with a controlled <b>differential</b> <b>steering</b> system from the Cleveland Tractor Company (a so-called [...] "Cletrac" [...] system). The engine was also replaced with the same [...] version as in the T1E4.

50|$|The B-24 {{featured}} a tricycle undercarriage, the first American bomber to do so, {{with the main}} gear extending out of the wing on long, single-oleo strut legs. It used <b>differential</b> <b>braking</b> and <b>differential</b> thrust for ground steering, which made taxiing difficult.|$|R
25|$|<b>Differential</b> <b>braking</b> (or <b>braked</b> <b>differential)</b> systems {{remove the}} {{clutches}} {{on the track}} and add a differential on the transmission output. The differential allows the tracks to turn at different speeds while remaining powered. Steering is then accomplished by slowing one track with a brake. The advantage to this design is that power is maintained to both tracks even while steering is taking place. Another advantage is outright simplicity; the steering system connects directly to the brake and nothing else, producing a very simple mechanical arrangement.|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Biped {{locomotion}} for humanoid robots is {{a challenging}} {{problem that has}} come into prominence in recent years. As the degrees of freedom of a humanoid robot approaches to that of humans, {{the need for a}} better, robust, flexible and simpler maneuverability becomes inevitable for real or realistic environments. This paper presents a new method of controlling the trajectory of a humanoid robot on the basis of <b>differential</b> <b>steering</b> systems. To the best of our knowledge, {{this is the first time}} that such a technique has been applied on humanoid robots. It has been empirically shown that a humanoid robot can plan its trajectory by using the same principle applied in <b>differential</b> <b>steering</b> systems, and the change in its orientation can be easily calculated in degrees. Therefore, this method enables the robot to move in a desired curved-shape trajectory, instead of aligning itself with the target prior to walking or performing more complex and time consuming motions like diagonal walk or sidewalk. This method is also beneficial when further trajectory planning constraints such as obstacle avoidance are considered...|$|R
