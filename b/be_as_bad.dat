25|$|Davie's {{fourth season}} looked to <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> as his third, {{as the team}} played four ranked teams {{early in the season}} and had to replace many graduating players. However, with two wins, and an {{overtime}} loss to the top-ranked team, Nebraska, the Irish moved into the rankings again. The team ended the season on a seven-game winning streak and were invited to their first BCS bowl game. Though they lost Davie's third bowl game, he signed a contract extension after the season. Davie's fifth season began with high expectations once again. The team began ranked, but three losses to begin the season dropped the Irish from the rankings. Though the team came back and won five games, the 5–6 record was called the wrong direction by the administration, and Davie was fired. After some controversy during the hiring process, Tyrone Willingham was hired, ending Davie's era at Notre Dame.|$|E
25|$|Hook goes {{calling for}} Emma and {{stands on a}} rooftop to get attention. He jumps off, and Emma uses magic to take him safely to the ground, before asking {{why he was so}} sure she’d save him. He says he was optimistic, and then asks what {{happened}} between them in Camelot. He says he forgives her, but she says that she's the Dark One and forgiveness. Hook says there’s nothing she’s done could <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> as what he’s done. He shows her a ring that belonged to Barnaby, and whom he killed front of his wife. He says that every ring he wears is a sad story. She shows him the ring he gave her to keep safe, and he says it was the saddest story of all; it belonged to a man better than him, his brother Liam. She tries to give it back but he tells her to keep it. He says he wore rings as trophies and now they’re just reminders. When Emma asks if Hook wants to know the truth, no matter how terrible, Hook says he loves her no matter what, and Emma says she needs to show him something. She takes him to her house and she points him to a telescope. He looks and sees the sea and a full moon over the waves. She says he told her the ocean calmed him and he says it’s a nice home she picked, but Emma says that he picked it, not her. He looks at the newspaper and recognized his handwriting on it. She says he told her this was their future and she says everything she did was to keep that future alive. He asks again for the truth and she says they’re almost there and kisses him. She says she can’t tell him everything because he would try and stop her. After the kiss, Hook gets groggy and asks what she's doing, before passing out.|$|E
500|$|Love {{claimed she}} was misquoted by Hirschberg, and {{asserted}} {{that she had}} immediately quit using heroin during her first trimester after she discovered she was pregnant. Record executive Danny Goldberg, who {{was a friend of}} Love and Cobain's, defended her against the claims, and commented on her decision to be profiled in the piece: [...] "Courtney had this yearning for mass-culture acceptability and just couldn't say no to something like that. I had a sense of foreboding about it, but I had no idea it as gonna <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> as it was. [...] done a lot of stupid, self-destructive things, but I don't believe she screwed around with her pregnancy. Those allegations were anonymous." [...] Love would later claim that the publication of the article had serious implications for her marriage as well as Cobain's mental state, suggesting it was a factor in his suicide.|$|E

500|$|On January 15, 2014, Bruce Boxleitner {{stated in}} an interview: [...] "All I know is, they don’t tell me anything, {{but they want}} to do it I would say {{probably}} the end of this year, for 2015 maybe," [...] Boxleitner said. [...] "They don’t have any dates but I’m thinking from the scuttlebutt I’m hearing that’s it, but I don’t know anything for sure other than they do have a script they love, they're still tweaking." [...] The film may also take place more in the real world than in the past according to the recent interview: [...] "That’s what I’m told, but you didn’t hear me say that," [...] Boxleitner joked. [...] "I think it’s {{going to be a lot}} about taking the company back because if you remember Sam Flynn says to Alan at the end, just before he rides his bike off into the sunrise with Quorra, says, ‘We’re going to take the company back.’ That’s not the end of the movie. That’s the beginning of the next one. That’s foreshadowing. And you don’t get Cillian Murphy to do an unscripted cameo" [...] and [...] "I got a feeling Eddie Dillinger Jr.’s going to <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> as his dad was." ...|$|E
500|$|Eric Goldman of IGN graded {{the episode}} 8.1 out of 10, calling it [...] "pretty damn busy and quite fun", {{highlighting}} Skye's character {{development and the}} drama it caused, {{as well as the}} connections to [...] "Pilot", as high points of the episode. He praised the [...] "dark, but also necessary" [...] deaths depicted, and concluded that the series [...] "is beginning to build its story in an intriguing way." [...] James Hunt at Den of Geek found the episode to be [...] "mostly, quite good," [...] praising Skye's story, the idea that S.H.I.E.L.D. [...] "might actually <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> as the people they're trying to fight", and the character of Raina, who he called [...] "the closest thing this series has yet had to an original, interesting idea". Hunt criticized the dialogue, and found the character of Chan Ho Yin to be unrealistic, stating [...] "while I loved the fact that they kind of, sort of, dredged up an actual Marvel character to use in this episode ... it was a shame that he too bore almost no resemblance to an actual person". The Guardians Graeme Virtue also criticized some of the dialogue, but enjoyed the character of Raina and the potential for her to return. He hoped that now Skye's secret has been revealed, [...] "perhaps some of the other agents will get their time in the spotlight." [...] Marc Bernardin of The Hollywood Reporter decided that the [...] "episode wasn't as good as [...] "Eye Spy"—by the time we got to the last two segments, I really didn’t care what happened to “Scorch,”—but it was still better than the first three. It was all just so very ... perfunctory." ...|$|E

"After the war I {{always knew}} that nothing, nothing, could ever <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> ..... but nothing could frighten me any more, I mean, no man could frighten me any more, no Director ..... nothing could <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> as the war, or the things I saw in the war." ...|$|E

2500|$|Michael Brown criticized President Obama for {{responding}} to Hurricane Sandy faster than he responded to the attacks at Benghazi. [...] He also stated {{that he thought that}} President Obama was overplaying the likely threat from Sandy, and that the storm had hardly formed. [...] He also noted “The storm was still forming, people were debating whether it was going to <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> as expected, or not, and I noted that the president should have let the governors and mayors deal with the storm until it got closer to hitting the coastal areas along the Washington, D.C.-New York City corridor.” ...|$|E
2500|$|... 21a. [...] "Fold your {{flapping}} wings" [...] (Strephon) was sung on {{the first}} night and cut soon afterwards. [...] The song, preceded by a recitative for Strephon ("My bill has now been read a second time") appeared shortly after #21, following the exit of the two Earls and the Lord Chancellor and the entrance of Strephon. [...] The tone of the song is dark and angry, in marked contrast with the generally genial tone of Iolanthe, and the lyrics make the case that bad behaviour by the underclasses is caused by their unfortunate circumstances: [...] "I might <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> – as unlucky, rather – if I only had Fagin for a father." [...] The music to this song survives, and although most productions continue to omit it, the song has been used in some modern productions and as a separate concert piece.|$|E
2500|$|The United Irishmen {{launched}} a rebellion in 1798. In Ulster, {{most of the}} United Irish commanders {{and many of the}} rebels were Protestant. Orangemen were recruited into the yeomanry to help fight the rebellion and [...] "proved an invaluable addition to government forces". No attempt was made to disarm Orangemen outside the yeomanry, because they were seen as by far the lesser threat. It was also claimed that if an attempt had been made then [...] "the whole of Ulster would <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> as Antrim and Down", where the United Irishmen rebellion was at its strongest. However, sectarian massacres by the Defenders in County Wexford [...] "did much to dampen" [...] the rebellion in Ulster. The Scullabogue Barn massacre saw over 100 non-combatant (mostly Protestant) men, women, and children imprisoned in a barn which was then set alight, with the Catholic rebels ensuring none escaped, not even a child who it is claimed managed to break out only for a rebel to kill with his pike. In the trials that followed the massacres, evidence was recorded of anti-Orange sentiments being expressed by the rebels at Scullabogue. Partly {{as a result of this}} atrocity, the Orange Order quickly grew and large numbers of gentry with experience gained in the yeomanry came into the movement.|$|E
