50|$|What {{initially}} interested Allaire in {{the property}} {{now known as}} Historic Allaire Village was the presence of significant quantities of bog iron ore. This <b>bog</b> <b>ore,</b> so called because of its formation in marshes and swampy areas, was a valuable resource in America before the discovery of vast ore deposits {{in the mountains of}} Northern New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Unlike the latter ore, <b>bog</b> <b>ore</b> is easily accessible and requires no deep shaft or strip mining to get it.|$|E
40|$|In {{connection}} with a discovery of oxidic manganiferous and ferriferous precipitations in northern Vermland and north-western Dalecarlia, pH measurements of different waters and chemical analyses of waters and <b>bog</b> <b>ores</b> were carried out.

50|$|Bog iron {{is a form}} of impure iron deposit that {{develops}} in bogs or swamps by the chemical or biochemical oxidation of iron carried in solution. In general, <b>bog</b> <b>ores</b> consist primarily of iron oxyhydroxides, commonly goethite (FeO(OH)).|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} mentions of Ore {{being removed}} from Jayville date {{all the way}} back to 1833. At that time a blast furnace was built by the Fuller brothers at Fullervulle, southwest of Edwards. It operated on ores from Little York mine, <b>bog</b> <b>ores</b> from Edwards, and magnetic ores from Jaayville and Clifton. This furnace was closed in 1882.|$|R
5000|$|The Nassawango Iron Furnace {{was built}} in 1830 by the Maryland Iron Company to produce iron from <b>bog</b> <b>ore</b> {{deposits}} in its vicinity. It is notable for its innovative use of a [...] "hot blast" [...] technique for smelting the iron, which had only been developed in England around 1828, and {{which may have been}} added to the Nassawango Furnace in 1837. Due to the variable nature of the <b>bog</b> <b>ore</b> deposits, the furnace stopped operations in 1849.|$|E

50|$|Although the <b>bog</b> iron <b>ores</b> mined {{in colonial}} days were widespread, the {{deposits}} were also small, and quickly exhausted. In the late 1700s the iron furnaces {{moved away from}} the <b>bog</b> iron <b>ore</b> of the coastal swamps, to larger iron ore deposits further inland. Inland locations also allowed the furnaces to be closer to sources of limestone, which was used as a flux in iron smelting. The proximity to larger ore deposits favored larger, more permanent iron smelters.|$|R

40|$|Initial {{data on the}} hydrogen-isotopic {{compositions}} in hydrous Mn minerals {{from various}} occurrences fall {{in a wide range}} from - 298 to - 84 per mil, relative to SMOW. DeltaD-values of todorokite and cryptomelane from Tertiary deposits show - 89 and - 150 per mil. 10 Angström-manganite and Delta-MnO 2 from deep-sea nodules have relatively restricted DeltaD-values ranging from - 96 to - 84 per mil. The DeltaD-values for manganese <b>bog</b> <b>ores</b> from recent hot springs show almost - 105 per mil. It is recognized that the isotopic values obtained for the deep-sea nodules and recent <b>bog</b> <b>ores</b> are slightly different ranged. Manganite and groutite are unique in their hydrogen-isotopic compositions, having the most depleted DeltaD-values ranging from - 298 to - 236 per mil. MnO(OH) minerals are more deuterium-depleted hydrous minerals than any other hydrothermal minerals from various ore deposits. Hydrogen-isotope fractionation factors between manganite and water were experimentally determined to be 0. 7894, 0. 7958 and 0. 8078 at 150 °, 200 ° and 250 °C, respectively. the present experimental results indicate that if manganites were formed at temperatures below 250 °C, under isotopic equilibrium conditions, most of the manganite mineralization in the Tertiary manganese deposits must have precipitated from meteoric hydrothermal solutions...|$|R
50|$|Iron {{smelting}} from {{bog iron}} was invented during the Pre-Roman Iron Age, and most Viking era iron was smelted from bog iron. The bog iron deposits of Northern and Northeastern Europe were created after the Ice Age ended, on postglacial plains. The dominant source of iron ore in Scandinavia and Russia into the Middle Ages was bog-ore. Even after improved smelting technology made mined ores viable during the Middle Ages, <b>bog</b> <b>ore</b> remained important, particularly to peasant iron production, into modern times. In Russia, <b>bog</b> <b>ore</b> {{was the principal}} source of iron until the 16th century, when the superior ores of Ural Mountains became available.|$|E
50|$|At {{the same}} time iron was {{produced}} from <b>bog</b> <b>ore</b> to supply tools for the millstone production. Near Melingen there are indications of iron production. Also {{in the area around}} Mela there was pottery production since the area has a good supply of clay.|$|E
5000|$|Phosphorus (P) {{has four}} major effects on iron: {{increased}} hardness and strength, lower solidus temperature, increased fluidity, and cold shortness.

40|$|The various {{questions}} regarding the old problem of the genesis of lake and <b>bog</b> <b>ores</b> have, so far, never been {{the object of a}} summarizing paper from a present-day research aspect. Moreover, several special questions still remain quite unclear. The present paper therefore intends to closely examine a number of special questions and to provide a summarizing presentation of the whole problem. However, it is obvious that, in several respects, this paper cannot provide a final answer to all these special questions which belong to the most diverse fields of the natural sciences. Nevertheless, it will clearly delineate the problem for future research.

50|$|In 1766, Charles Read, a {{well-known}} ironmaster, built the Batsto Iron Works along the Batsto River {{on the site}} of the future village. The area had an abundance of <b>bog</b> <b>ore</b> which could be mined from the area's streams and rivers, and wood from the area's forests was harvested for charcoal for smelting the ore. The rivers, despite their modest drop, were also harnessed for iron making.|$|E

40|$|Several {{samples of}} dusts from steel and coke plants (collected mostly with electro filters) were {{subjected}} to the investigation of content of mineral phases in their particles. Additionally, sample of <b>bog</b> iron <b>ore</b> and metallurgical slurry was studied. Next, the magnetic susceptibility of all the samples was determined, and investigations of iron-containing phases were performed using transmission Mössbauer spectrometry. The values of mass-specific magnetic susceptibility χ varied in a wide range: from 59 to above 7000 × 10 − 8 m- 3 ·kg− 1. The low values are determined for <b>bog</b> iron <b>ore,</b> metallurgical slurry, and coke dusts. The extremely high χ was obtained for metallurgical dusts. The Mössbauer spectra and X-ray diffraction patterns point {{to the presence of}} the following phases containing iron: hematite and oxidized magnetite (in coke and metallurgical dusts as well as metallurgical slurry), traces of magnetite fine grains fraction (in metallurgical dusts), amorphous glassy silicates with paramagnetic Fe 3 + and Fe 2 + ions, traces of pyrrhotite (in coke dusts), α-Fe and nonstoichiometric wüstite (in metallurgical slurry), as well as ferrihydrite nanoparticles (in <b>bog</b> iron <b>ore).</b> For individual samples of metallurgical dusts, the relative contributions of Fe 2 +/ 3 + ions in octahedral B sites and Fe 2 + ions in tetrahedral A sites in magnetite spinel structure differs considerably...|$|R
50|$|Goethite is an iron oxyhydroxide {{containing}} ferric iron. It is {{the main}} component of rust and <b>bog</b> iron <b>ore.</b> Goethite's hardness ranges from 5.0 to 5.5 on the Mohs Scale, and its specific gravity varies from 3.3 to 4.3. The mineral forms prismatic needle-like crystals ("needle iron ore"), but is more typically massive.|$|R
50|$|Iron {{production}} in the 1700s was done with charcoal, of which American forests could provide a seemingly endless supply. Numerous small iron mines supplied iron furnaces scattered throughout the colonies in the 1700s. <b>Bog</b> iron <b>ore</b> common around the Chesapeake Bay fed numerous iron furnaces in Maryland and Virginia set up to export to Britain.|$|R
50|$|Iron-bearing {{groundwater}} typically {{emerges as}} a spring. The iron is oxidized to ferric hydroxide upon encountering the oxidizing environment of the surface. <b>Bog</b> <b>ore</b> often combines goethite, magnetite and vugs or stained quartz. Oxidation may occur through enzyme catalysis by iron bacteria. It {{is not clear whether}} the magnetite precipitates upon first contact with oxygen, then oxidizes to ferric compounds, or whether the ferric compounds are reduced when exposed to anoxic conditions upon burial beneath the sediment surface and reoxidized upon exhumation at the surface.|$|E
50|$|The {{banks of}} Great Egg Harbor River, from Mays Landing to Somers Point, were an ideal {{environment}} for shipbuilding {{in the century}} following the American Revolutionary War due to natural resources in the area. These resources included lumber from pine, oak, and cedar as well as <b>bog</b> <b>ore.</b> The waterways were deep enough for ships up to 2000 tons (1,800 MT). Sawmills and blast furnaces were available in the area. What {{was not used to}} build ships was exported in their holds. One shipwright during this time was Capt. Samuel Gaskill of Mays Landing.|$|E

5000|$|Prior to the {{industrial}} revolution, most iron was obtained from widely available goethite or <b>bog</b> <b>ore,</b> for example during the American Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars. Prehistoric societies used laterite {{as a source of}} iron ore. Historically, much of the iron ore utilized by industrialized societies has been mined from predominantly hematite deposits with grades of around 70% Fe. These deposits are commonly referred to as [...] "direct shipping ores" [...] or [...] "natural ores". Increasing iron ore demand, coupled with the depletion of high-grade hematite ores in the United States, after World War II led to development of lower-grade iron ore sources, principally the utilization of magnetite and taconite.|$|E
50|$|In 1645, the Undertakers {{wrote to}} Winthrop informing him that Richard Leader, a {{merchant}} from Salehurst who {{was familiar with}} the iron making process, would replace him as manager of the Iron Works. After arriving in Massachusetts, Leader reviewed the previous site survey and looked into some other locations. He selected a location in Lynn, Massachusetts (now part of present-day Saugus) on the Saugus River. The river was navigable for shallow draft vessels and could be dammed to power machinery. The surrounding forests could be used to make charcoal. <b>Bog</b> <b>ore</b> could be mined from nearby ponds, swamps, riverbeds, and bogs. Limestone, which was normally used for flux, was not available, but through trial and error it was found that gabbro, which could be mined in nearby Nahant, would work as a flux.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{apparent}} that in the Iron Age, Scandinavian communities began to exploit the bogs in ways {{that they had not}} done before. <b>Bog</b> <b>ore</b> was obtained for use in iron production, while there is evidence that peat cutting for use as fuel began in the Pre-Roman Iron Age. This new usage of the resource may have led to [...] "changes in the sacral use of bogs and wetlands too". In various cases it {{is apparent}} that individuals returned to the same site on repeated occasions to add more depositions; thus Kaul stated that while in Bronze Age Scandinavia, bogs were typically a place only for deposition, in the Iron Age [...] "the bog became a place where rituals were clearly performed, a sacral place more closely linked with the human world." ...|$|E
50|$|Due {{to natural}} {{resources}} comprising the reach forestry and shallow deposits of <b>bog</b> iron <b>ore,</b> the industrial traditions of Pisz are connected with wood processing (the sawmill) and metallurgy. There are iron works in Wądołek, {{as well as}} the industrial smithies in Wiartl and in Jaśkowo. The wood processing industry has a long tradition in Pisz. The core of the industry is its sawmill, supporting a broadbase plywood industry with a plant called Zakłady Przemysłu Sklejek.|$|R
5000|$|Limonite {{is named}} from the Greek word for meadow (λειμών), in allusion to its {{occurrence}} as <b>bog</b> iron <b>ore</b> in meadows and marshes (reference is here needed, since one may rather see it {{originating in the}} Latin [...] "limus" [...] - which means mud - or in its yellowish lemon-like color). In its brown form it is sometimes called brown hematite or brown iron ore. In its bright yellow form it is sometimes called lemon rock or yellow iron ore.|$|R
50|$|For many years, he {{chaired the}} board of {{directors}} of Wilmington's Delaware Bank. He also operated a cotton mill, as well as a machine shop that produced and repaired mill machinery. He sold his mill property in 1802 to the DuPonts and it became the center of the DuPont manufacturing empire. Broom was also involved in an unsuccessful scheme to mine <b>bog</b> iron <b>ore.</b> A further interest was internal improvements: toll roads, canals, and bridges. A letter to his son James in 1794 touches upon a number of these pursuits.|$|R
