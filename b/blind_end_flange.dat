30|$|Minimally-invasive {{operation}} {{should be}} conducted with the pre-condition that {{the distance between the}} <b>blind</b> <b>end</b> of the proximal normal urethra and the distal urethra (i.e. the length of the narrow segment) is < 1.0  cm. A long stenotic segment brings difficulty to internal incision of the <b>blind</b> <b>end,</b> and also brings about poor localization as well as dissatisfying outcome. Therefore, open operation for patients with narrow segments of < 1.0  cm is suggested.|$|R

During the operation, a flexible cystoscope was inserted from the suprapubic bladder stoma, to find out the internal orifice of the urethra; and then, {{with the assistance of the}} cystoscope, a urethral dilator was placed at the internal orifice of the normal urethra and entered into the normal posterior urethra to prop up the <b>blind</b> <b>end</b> of the normal urethra; an internal-incision-scope was inserted from the external urethral orifice, to incise the <b>blind</b> <b>end</b> with cold-scalpel till the internal-incision-scope was able to enter into the bladder smoothly; the false passage was excluded; a zebra urological guide wire was inserted into the normal urethra, and a F 18 Forley catheter was placed along the wire.|$|R

At the previous surgery, the lifted jejunum and its mesentery (for bilio- and pancreato-enteric reconstruction) were usually {{fixed to the}} mesentery of the transverse colon {{in order to prevent}} internal hernia. Therefore, the lower jejunum was unlikely to have enough length to complete the renewed hepaticojejunostomy safely.

The <b>blind</b> <b>end</b> of the normal urethra was incised from the perineal incision and the surrounding scar tissue was removed till the mucosa of the normal urethra was exposed.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to compare handsewn and stapled jejunocecal {{anastomosis}} with different stomal lengths in terms of anatomical differences. Group 1 underwent a two-layer handsewn jejunocecal side-to-side anastomosis (HS); Group 2 received a stapled jejunocecal side-to-side anastomosis (GIA). Each group was divided into two subgroups (HS 80 and HS 100, GIA 80 and GIA 100). Specimens were inflated and CT scanned. The stomal/jejunal area ratio and <b>blind</b> <b>end</b> pouch volume/area were measured and compared. Effective length of the stoma was measured and compared with the initial length. Stomal/jejunal area ratio was 1. 1 for both 80 techniques, 1. 6 for the GIA 100, and 1. 9 for the HS 100 technique. Both HS and GIA techniques produced a <b>blind</b> <b>end</b> pouch and exhibited a mean increase of the final stomal length ranging from 6 to 11 % greater than the original stomal length. All techniques will exhibit a length increase of the final stomal length compared to the intended stomal length, with a consequent increase in stomal area. Stapled techniques consistently produced a large distal <b>blind</b> <b>end</b> pouch. Length of a jejunocecal anastomosis should be selected in accordance with the diameter of afferent jejunum, and the 80 [*]mm stomal length could be deemed sufficient in horses...|$|R

40|$|The authors {{present the}} case of a 68 years old patient {{admitted}} for chronic calculous cholecistitis and symptomatic choledocolithiasis with obstructive jaundice and moderate biochemical cholestasis. The patient had a Reichel-Polya gastric resection for ulcer 20 years ago with disinsertion of duodenal papilla repaired with jejunal loop patch in “Roux en Y”. Intraoperatively we noticed chronic sclerous acalculous cholecistitis, equivalence of cholecisto-choledocal fistula, choledocolithiasis. Exploration of the duodenal papilla identified a relative oddian stenosis. The first and second parts of duodenum were absent and replaced by a jejunal loop in “Roux en Y” patching the papilla on the side, with a free <b>blind</b> <b>end</b> and anastomosed laterally to the gastric stump. The second, subvaterian part of duodenum have been closed and left blind. The treatment of the common bile duct lithiasis consisted in cholecistectomy with primary closure of the large communication between the gallbladder and common bile duct, coledocolithotomy, common bile duct (CBD) lavage. To ensure an adequate biliary flow we decided for a side-to-side anastomosis between the CBD and the blind part of the jejunal Roux-en-Y loop. The <b>blind</b> <b>end</b> of the second subvaterian part of the duodenum was anastomosed in an end-to-end fashion also to the <b>blind</b> <b>end</b> of the jejunal Roux-en-Y- loop to ensure some biliary flow through remaining part of the duodenum.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{studies to}} {{elucidate}} {{the mechanism of}} gastric acid hyper-secretion after Roux-Y bille diversion, Heidenhain pouches were constructed in 19 healthy mongrel dogs. The construction of 40 -cm <b>blind</b> <b>ended</b> Roux-Y jejunal limbs in 5 dogs caused significant increase in total 24 -hour acid secretion, an average rise of 148 percent of the control levels. This increase was further augmented when bile flow was directed into the jejunum via these limbs. Similar significant acid increase occurred when {{the end of a}} 40 -cm blind jejunal segment was anastomosed {{to the side of the}} duodenum in 6 dogs. Complete diversion of bile into the duodenum via the jejunal segment produced even greater acid output, an average of a 138 percent increase, although this was reversed to normal by shortening the jejunal segment. Primary construction of jejunal interpostiion choledochoduodenostomy in 4 dogs or choledochojejunostomy Roux-en-Y in 4 dogs also induced hypersecretion. Serum gastrin levels were not changed significantly throughout this study except when a 40 -cm <b>blind</b> <b>ended</b> jejunal segment was inserted into the duodenum.
