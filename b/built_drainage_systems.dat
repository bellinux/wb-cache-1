40|$|Lucknow is {{the capital}} city of India’s most populous state Uttar Pradesh. Urban growth {{currently}} is largely on par with other cities of similar size, and is anticipated to be slightly faster in the immediate future. The better economic prospect has lead to an increase in the urban population of the city during last few years. It has lead to large-scale urban sprawl and the inherent distinctiveness of hydrological environment is being neglected in urban planning. With the expansion of the urban sprawl and the increasing population, there has been a surmounting pressure on a) natural and <b>built</b> <b>drainage</b> <b>systems</b> b) surface/subsurface hydrological storage units, of Lucknow. The anthropogenic factors have also contributed to the presence of heavy metals in the hydrological units of the city. Upto now the regeneration of water by nature kept the surface and subsurface water ecosystem pure, satisfying the urban and peri-urban requirements. But during last few years, increasing demands from new urban extensions as well as intense agriculture and irrigation practices in surrounding rural areas have stressed the hydrological cycle considerably, raising questions over the sustainability of the water resources in the city. This paper attempts to highlight some important environmental criteria and propose methodology to achieve it, during the design of master plan with a focus on surface and subsurface water integrity of Lucknow building upon city’s natural and built environments.

40|$|Major {{earthquakes}} {{can cause}} extensive transformations {{to the land}} underlying cities, leading to decreased capacity in natural and <b>built</b> <b>drainage</b> <b>systems</b> and, as a consequence, to Increased Flooding Hazard (IFH). This phenomenon causes some areas, which previously were not exposed to flooding, to {{have the potential to}} flood, and already flood-prone areas to likely experience increased flood depth during the next rainfall events. This scenario occurred in Christchurch city, New Zealand, after the 2010 – 2011 Canterbury Earthquake Sequence (CES). The IFH was observed in many urban areas during a series of rainfall events occurred in the years after the CES. This paper proposes a method for analysing and assessing to what extent the earthquake-induced damage to storm water pipelines and the consequent impacts on the connectivity and capacity levels of the pipeline storm water network could contribute to the IFH. A probabilistic analysis, through a Monte Carlo simulation, is suggested for the proposed method so that the uncertainty affecting several key parameters can be accounted for. The proposed probabilistic method for IFH was implemented as an additional module within a recently developed open-source simulation tool, OOFIMS. Results from the added OOFIMS module are presented in terms of maps and cumulative distribution functions of increased flood height and flooded area, impact metrics that can be useful for emergency managers and infrastructure owners. The effectiveness of the proposed method to assess earthquake-altered flooding hazard and the relative OOFIMS-added module are tested using Christchurch as a case-study...|$|E

At the southwestern corner of the Temple Mount stood the street's most important junction. From there it was possible to turn east towards the Huldah Gates, north - up the street, or to ascend Robinson's Arch to the Royal Stoa. Several remains of the street can still be seen in several places: at the Pool of Siloam, in the Western Wall Tunnels, and at the Jerusalem Archaeological Park at the foot of the Temple Mount.

40|$|Early civilisations <b>built</b> <b>drainage</b> <b>systems</b> {{in urban}} areas to handle storm runoff. The Romans, in particular, {{constructed}} elaborate systems that drained also the wastewaters from the public baths. Reforms saw the constructions of sewer systems in major cities, like Paris, London and in North-America during the 1850 s to 1900 s, and later the generalisation of sewer systems in smaller cities and towns. The primary role of sewers is to carry the wastewaters, or sewage, to a treatment plant. Most large sewer channels operate as free-surface flows. In these open channel flows, the free surface rises and falls in response to changes in discharges, channel slope and width. The driving force of the flow motion is primarily gravity (e. g. sloping channel), sometimes in combination with pressure (e. g. in an inverted siphon). For a given flow rate, the primary unknowns are {{the location of the}} free surface (or flow depth) which is not known beforehand and the flow velocity. The fundamental principles of hydraulic engineering are the equations of continuity or conservation of mass, of momentum or conservation of momentum, and conservation of energy. Another equation is the Bernoulli equation which may be derived from the differential form of the momentum principle. Open channel hydraulics is possibly the most complicated field in fluid mechanics. For a given flow rate, there is an infinity of solutions depending upon the bed slope, boundary friction and channel cross-sectional shape. Further the three-dimensional turbulent flow motion is complicated, in particular in non-rectangular channels. But even so, traditional clear-water hydraulics cannot predict the cross-sectional changes of sewer channels caused by the sediment transport processes (deposition, blockage, erosion). It is now recognised that sediment motion is characterised by strong interactive processes between water runoff, sediment erosion resistance, topography of the channel, and stream discharge. In sewers, sediments include a wide range of particle sizes ranging from tens of microns to tens of centimetres. The particles can be inorganic or organic in nature, and their chemical and biological features present significant variations. Sewage sludge and wastewater treatment residues exhibit non-Newtonian characteristics, including thixotropy. Such non-Newtonian behaviour is very rarely accounted for in open channel hydraulic calculations and numerical modelling, although sediment mass flux predictions are intricately linked with the sediment sludge properties, including yield stress, apparent viscosity and degree of jamming. In open channels including sewers, numerous failures resulted from the inability of engineers to predict sediment motion and mass fluxes despite recent advances. In sewer management, the predictions of the mass fluxes remain challenging. The calculations need to be validated and checked with field measurements of both water discharges and sediment fluxes despite the limitations of instrumentation and the limited accuracy...|$|E

About 90% of this seepage entered Mexico. At first this seepage caused widespread flooding, but Mexicali Valley residents and businesses <b>built</b> <b>drainage</b> and pumping <b>systems</b> to recover the seepage. Mexicali Valley agriculture became reliant upon this seepage for irrigation. As water use increased in both rural and urban areas, this seepage became an issue of concern. The All-American Canal Lining Project, a part of California’s Colorado River Water Use Plan, lined 37 km of the canal to prevent seepage. In 2006, a Mexicali business and civic organization and two California environmental non-profits challenged the lining project in US federal court on the basis that it violated the water rights of Mexican water users and violated US environmental statutes due to the seepage's effects on the nearby Andrade Mesa Wetlands. A rider in the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 required the completion of the lining project, however, and the lawsuit was rendered moot. The Imperial Irrigation District built a parallel canal along the designated section of the original canal, and the water flow was rerouted into the new lined canal. Construction began in 2007 and was completed in 2009.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Drainage</b> <b>systems</b> {{are part}} of a city’s {{infrastructure}} and they are an important factor in urban life. If the <b>drainage</b> <b>system</b> fails, cities become flooded that can cause disruption of the city’s services and activities. In this paper, we attempted to assess the <b>drainage</b> <b>system</b> of Butuan City, one of the highly urbanized cities in the Philippines. Recently, flooding in the city has become more frequent and widespread. One of the factors being looked into as cause of flooding is {{the quality and quantity of}} city’s <b>drainage</b> <b>system.</b> In this paper, we describe our approach of using LiDAR datasets and GIS techniques to assess the <b>drainage</b> <b>system</b> of Butuan City. A LiDAR Digital Terrain Model (DTM) was used to subdivide the city into various drainage areas (i. e., the area where rain water accumulates and flows into one or more drainage areas downstream of it until it reaches an existing <b>drainage</b> <b>system</b> or an outlet, e. g., a river or a portion of the sea). Field surveys were done to map the existing <b>drainage</b> <b>systems</b> of the city, including its length, width, and slope. Using hydrological modelling techniques, we then computed for the volume of rainwater that can accumulate in a drainage area, and route this into the nearest <b>drainage</b> <b>system.</b> With the volume of rainwater, and the capacity of the existing <b>drainage</b> <b>system</b> being known, we then assessed if the volume of rainwater from a particular rainfall event can be accommodated by the existing <b>drainage</b> <b>system,</b> and if not, which part of the <b>drainage</b> <b>system</b> ther...|$|R

On the other hand, it can also happen that a surface <b>drainage</b> <b>system</b> diminishes the recharge of the groundwater {{to such an extent}} that the subsurface drainage problem is considerably reduced or even eliminated.The choice between a subsurface <b>drainage</b> <b>system</b> by pipes and ditches or by tube wells is more a matter of technical criteria and costs than of agricultural criteria, because both types of systems can be designed to meet the same agricultural criteria and achieve the same benefits. Usually, pipe drains or ditches are preferable to wells. However, when the soil consists of a poorly permeable top layer several meters thick, overlying a rapidly permeable and deep subsoil, wells may be a better option, because the drain spacing required for pipes or ditches would be considerably smaller than the spacing for wells.When the land needs a subsurface <b>drainage</b> <b>system,</b> but saline groundwater is present at great depth, it is better to employ a shallow, closely spaced system of pipes or ditches instead of a deep, widely spaced system. The reason is that the deeper systems produce a more salty effluent than the shallow systems. Environmental criteria may then prohibit the use of the deeper systems.In some drainage projects, one may find that only main <b>drainage</b> <b>systems</b> are envisaged.
