5|$|In 1914, Franck {{teamed up}} with Hertz to perform an {{experiment}} to investigate fluorescence. They designed a vacuum tube for studying energetic electrons that flew through a thin vapour of mercury atoms. They discovered that when an electron collided with a mercury atom it could lose only a specific quantity (4.9electron volts) of its kinetic energy before flying away. A faster electron does not decelerate completely after a collision, but loses precisely {{the same amount of}} its kinetic energy. Slower electrons just <b>bounce</b> <b>off</b> mercury atoms without losing any significant speed or kinetic energy.|$|E
5|$|The {{game has}} three playable {{character}}s; Lilac, Carol, and Milla. Melee attacks {{that can be}} used on enemies, and each character has a unique array of moves which allow them to traverse the environment in different ways. Lilac can perform a double-jump attack and can launch herself into an air dash, allowing her to <b>bounce</b> <b>off</b> walls and reach high areas. Carol is able to curl into a spin-attack while running and can climb up walls. By picking up gas canisters, Carol can bring out her motorcycle, which can double-jump and ride up vertical walls. Milla can throw gelatinous cubes and put up an offensive shield, combining the two to perform a Shield Blast, and flap her ears to reach high areas.|$|E
5|$|The radio postgame show {{reported}} the Warriors defeating the Knicks 169–150. However, the official scorer's report recorded {{the game as}} 169–147, a discrepancy {{that has never been}} explained. Chamberlain made 36 of 63 field-goals and 28 of 32 free throws, the latter a far better rate than his roughly 50% career average. In two earlier games at Hershey that season, Chamberlain had made a combined 27of38 free throws, 71percent. The basket rims at the arena were aged, flimsy, and forgiving. Balls would <b>bounce</b> <b>off</b> of typical firm rims, whereas balls near the rim in Hershey were apt to get a good roll and fall in. Playing all 48minutes of the game, Chamberlain set NBA records for field goals attempted (63) and made (36), free throws made (28), most points in a quarter (31), and half (59). He averaged 73points in four games that week, exceeding 60 in all of them.|$|E

5|$|The National League {{got things}} {{started in the}} bottom of the first when José Reyes led off with a base hit off American League starter Dan Haren and {{proceeded}} to steal second. He scored on an RBI single by Ken Griffey, Jr. to give the NL a 1–0 lead. Barry Bonds nearly gave his hometown fans something to cheer for {{in the bottom of}} the third when, with Reyes on second, he lofted a high fly ball to left field, but it was snared at the warning track by Magglio Ordóñez. The AL nearly tied the game in the fourth when Alex Rodriguez attempted to score on a two-out single by Iván Rodríguez. However, the throw to home plate by Griffey allowed Russell Martin to tag Rodriguez out at the plate to end the inning. The AL would score one inning later when, after Chris Young issued a leadoff walk to Brian Roberts, Ichiro Suzuki hit a long fly ball off the right field wall. Instead of caroming straight to Griffey, the ball took an unusual <b>bounce</b> <b>off</b> a sign and ricocheted to Griffey's right. This allowed Ichiro to score on what became the first and only inside-the-park home run in All-Star Game history. The homer gave the AL a 2–1 lead and resulted in Ichiro's MVP win.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{encounters}} {{took place}} as the Battle of Hannut was being fought in Belgium. The results were much the same. On the southern face of Bulson, General Friedrich Kirchner, commander of the 1st Panzer Division, suffered several tactical reverses and saw the 37mm shells from his 3.7 cm PaK 36 anti-tank guns and Panzer IIIs <b>bounce</b> <b>off</b> the more heavily armoured French tanks. A number of the German tanks were knocked out in rapid succession. The Germans had to hold the French at the ridge. Kirchner was forced to send in his tanks in dribs and drabs, tactics which Guderian hated, but which he himself decided {{there was no other}} recourse. It was once again the German tanks' radio equipment that enabled them to move around quickly and communicate with one another, to change the point of defence or attack quickly. The speed of the German tanks also enabled them to offset their inferiority in combat power to the French tanks. Often, the Panzer III and IVs could speed into the rear of French formations, closing quickly and knocking out the French armour from the rear. The Germans noted the particular weakness between the chassis and turret of the French tanks, which were vulnerable to their fire.|$|E
5|$|In May 1972, Nutting Associates chief {{engineer}} Nolan Bushnell, {{designer of the}} first commercial arcade video game, Computer Space, saw {{a demonstration of the}} Odyssey at a dealership. Inspired, when he quit Nutting to start his own company, Atari, he assigned Allan Alcorn to create a cheap ping pong arcade game as a training exercise, though he did not tell Alcorn that it was for training nor that the idea was based on the Odyssey Table Tennis game. Alcorn soon developed Pong, which Bushnell recognized as a potential hit, and it became the company's first game. Pong was very successful, and in turn helped drive sales of the Odyssey; Baer once noted that customers bought the console because of Table Tennis, in turn because of Pong, and joked that they may as well have stopped designing games after that game card. In 1974, however, Magnavox sued Atari along with several competitors including Nutting, Allied Leisure, Bally Midway, and Williams Electronics for infringing on Baer's patents for video games played on a television screen. Baer has stated that the lawsuits were not filed right away because Magnavox and Sanders needed to wait until they could expect to be awarded more money than it would cost to pursue the suits. The root of the conflict was a pair of patents by Baer—one which described how the Odyssey showed player-controlled objects, or dots, on a video monitor and described a number of games that could be played with the system, and an earlier one that went into detail about how the Odyssey used that system to have two dots collide with each other and have one <b>bounce</b> <b>off,</b> specifically using a game of ping pong as an example.|$|E

25|$|The pulse is {{powerful}} enough to cause moderately long metal objects (such as cables) to act as antennas and generate high voltages due to interactions with the electromagnetic pulse.

25|$|Researchers at Princeton University have {{recently}} built a quantum well laser {{which is no}} bigger than a grain of rice. The laser is powered by a single electron which passes through two quantum dots; a double quantum dot. The electron moves from a state of higher energy, to a state of lower energy whilst emitting photons in the microwave region. These photons <b>bounce</b> <b>off</b> mirrors to create a beam of light; the laser.|$|E
25|$|The {{point of}} release is the {{position}} of the ball in relation to the body at the moment when the ball is released. It is crucial for the arm to be stiff, not bent, and the wrist rather looser, to ensure smooth release of the ball, and sufficient <b>bounce</b> <b>off</b> the pitch. Otherwise, the action will resemble chucking. The left shoulder ought to be somewhat towards the stumps, the arm beside the bowler falling away, having just before this stage been pointing directly at the stumps.|$|E

Loki gave the spear to Baldr's brother, the blind god Höðr, who then {{inadvertently}} killed his brother with it (other versions suggest that Loki guided the arrow himself). For this act, Odin and the giantess Rindr gave birth to Váli who grew to adulthood within a day and slew Höðr.|$|E

25|$|The play {{is still}} disputed by those involved, {{particularly}} by living personnel from the Raiders and their fans, who insist the Raiders should have won. Tatum {{said that the}} ball did not <b>bounce</b> <b>off</b> him, both immediately after the game as well as later; however, in his memoirs, Tatum equivocated, stating {{that he could not}} honestly say if the ball hit him. Raiders linebacker Phil Villapiano, who was covering Harris at the time, maintains that the ball hit Fuqua. Fuqua has been coy, supposedly saying he knows exactly what happened that day but will never tell.|$|E
25|$|Much of Japan was {{involved}} with internecine wars during the Sengoku period (1467-1603), as feudal lords vied for supremacy. Matchlock guns were introduced about midway through the period, and after their introduction on the battlefield, were used extensively toward the end, and had a decisive role in warfare. In 1549, Oda Nobunaga ordered 500 guns {{to be made for}} his armies. The benefits of firearms were still relatively questionable, however, compared to other weapons. At the time, guns were still rather primitive and cumbersome. According to one estimate, in 16th century Japan, an archer could shoot 15 arrows in the time a gunner would take to load, charge, and fire a firearm. Effective range also was only 80 to 100 meters, and at that distance a bullet could easily <b>bounce</b> <b>off</b> armour. Matchlocks were vulnerable to humid or rainy conditions as the powder would become damp. However, one advantage was that a firearm could be manned effectively by farmers or low-ranking infantry.|$|E
25|$|On lap 35, {{the leaders}} {{came up to}} lap Emilio de Villota. De Villota {{attempted}} {{to move out of}} the way of Reutemann by taking the inside line through the corner, allowing Reutemann to go around him. Laffite saw an opportunity to get past Reutemann by going inside of de Villota. Instead he collided with de Villota which caused him to <b>bounce</b> <b>off</b> and hit Reutemann as well. Both Reutemann and Laffite retired on the spot and although de Villota was able to carry on to the pits, his suspension was beyond repair and his race was also over. Piquet assumed the lead of the race, with Pironi second and Jones third within three seconds of the leader. Piquet led for seven laps until on lap 42 his Brabham's gearbox failed, and he was unable to continue. Geoff Lees retired on the same lap, with a broken wishbone on his car. Due in part to the number of retirements, the two leaders had built up a lead of around 50 seconds to the rest of the field by the halfway stage.|$|E

25|$|The stations' {{placement}} in the Empire State Building {{became a major}} issue {{with the construction of}} the World Trade Center's Twin Towers during the late 1960s and early 1970s. As the towers were taller than the Empire State Building, this would cause waves from the Empire State Building to sometimes <b>bounce</b> <b>off</b> the walls of the taller Twin Towers. As a result, some broadcasters decided that {{it would be easier to}} move to the Twin Towers instead, rather than suing the complex's developer, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, to stop construction. Even though the nine stations who were broadcasting from the Empire State Building were leasing their broadcast space until 1984, most of these stations moved to the World Trade Center as soon as it was completed in 1971. The broadcasters obtained a court order stipulating that the Port Authority had to build a mast and transmission equipment in the North Tower, as well as pay the broadcasters' leases in the Empire State Building until 1984. After the leases expired, there were very few broadcasters remaining in the Empire State Building.|$|E
25|$|Even when {{a system}} is entirely {{isolated}} from external influences, its microstate is constantly changing. For instance, the particles in a gas are constantly moving, and thus occupy a different position at each moment of time; their momenta are also constantly changing as they collide with each other or with the container walls. Suppose we prepare the system in an artificially highly ordered equilibrium state. For instance, imagine dividing a container with a partition and placing a gas {{on one side of}} the partition, with a vacuum on the other side. If we remove the partition and watch the subsequent behavior of the gas, we will find that its microstate evolves according to some chaotic and unpredictable pattern, and that on average these microstates will correspond to a more disordered macrostate than before. It is possible, but extremely unlikely, for the gas molecules to <b>bounce</b> <b>off</b> one another in such a way that they remain in one half of the container. It is overwhelmingly probable for the gas to spread out to fill the container evenly, which is the new equilibrium macrostate of the system.|$|E
25|$|The Sharks {{advanced}} to the Western Conference Semi-finals to face the third-seed Detroit Red Wings, whom they had defeated in five games during the previous post-season's second round. Just like the year prior, the Sharks won the first three games of the series and lost the fourth but instead of replicating the previous year's success in Game 5, the Sharks dropped two more games as the Red Wings became the eighth team in NHL history to force a Game 7 after losing the first three games of a series. However, they would not become the 4th team in history {{to pull off the}} comeback as the Sharks prevailed, 3–2, with the game-winning goal scored by former captain Patrick Marleau who had endured media criticism from former teammate and now NBC Sports Network television personality Jeremy Roenick for his lackluster play in Game 5 of the series against the Red Wings. The Sharks {{advanced to}} their third Western Conference Finals series, their first playoff meeting with the Vancouver Canucks. San Jose dropped the first two games of the series at Rogers Arena in Vancouver but rebounded with a 4–3 victory thanks to two first-period goals by Marleau in Game 3. However, they lost the fourth game of the series and eventually were eliminated from the playoffs after a Game 5 in Vancouver that featured a game-tying goal by the Canucks' Ryan Kesler with 18.3 seconds remaining in the third period as well as a quirky <b>bounce</b> <b>off</b> a side stanchion that allowed Kevin Bieksa to score the overtime goal that advanced Vancouver to their third Stanley Cup Finals and left the Sharks knocked out in Round 3 for the second consecutive post-season.|$|E
