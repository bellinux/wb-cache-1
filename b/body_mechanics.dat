5|$|The recruits' {{indoctrination}} {{period at}} Palm Beach was six weeks. It covered instruction on subjects such as: activities, organization, personnel, current events, and social hygiene. The physical education aspects consisted of: <b>body</b> <b>mechanics,</b> swimming, games, and drill.

25|$|Xing Yi is {{characterized}} by aggressive, seemingly linear movements and explosive power that's most often applied from a short range. A practitioner of Xing Yi uses coordinated movements to generate bursts of power intended to overwhelm the opponent, simultaneously attacking and defending. Methods vary from school to school, but always include bare-handed fighting training (mostly in single movements/combinations and sometimes in forms) and the training of weapons usage with similar or identical <b>body</b> <b>mechanics</b> to that used for bare-handed fighting. The most basic notions of movement and <b>body</b> <b>mechanics</b> in the art were heavily influenced by the practice of staffs and spears.|$|E

25|$|In many lineages, {{there is}} an {{intermittent}} stage between the stationary Zhan Zhuang and the more complex Five Elements (though this stage might also be taught following the Five Elements). The two names above are interchangeable for a few exercises developed to fulfill that purpose. Shi Li movements are basically simplified versions of the more advanced <b>body</b> <b>mechanics</b> and circles found in the Five Elements and the Animals. Their focus is on training one's structure and Yi, and {{can be thought of}} as 'Zhan Zhuang in movement'. They are usually trained very slowly, one movement at a time, repeating the same movement for many minutes on end. The more advanced practitioner many also spontaneously link up and flow between different Shi Li movements, or train them more explosively with Fa Jin (发劲). In Yi Quan, the original Five Elements and 12 Animals have all been 'condensed' and 'refined' into forms of Shi Li, which replace them as the core exercises in the art (together with Zhan Zhuang).|$|E
25|$|Kazmir {{was focused}} on {{improving}} his mechanics going into spring training, a problem that had bothered him {{at the end of}} the previous season but battled a hip injury for much of camp. Possibly as a result of the injury, he suffered from a loss of velocity on his pitches and his poor performance in Cactus League games led to him losing his spot in the starting rotation and beginning the season on the disabled list. He worked on refining his delivery and hoped to rejoin the club at some point during the season however he experienced some discomfort after a minor league rehab appearance in late June and was shut down again. He was sent home for a time in July to work with a <b>body</b> <b>mechanics</b> specialist in Houston. He did make some end of season rehab appearances for the Rancho Cucamonga Quakes but did not play in the majors at all this season.|$|E

In rigid <b>bodies</b> <b>mechanics,</b> this phenomenon appears when {{it is no longer}} possible to compute the reaction contact forces.
