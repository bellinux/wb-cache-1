5|$|Some prey {{animals such as}} zebra {{are marked}} with high-contrast {{patterns}} which possibly help to confuse their predators, such as lions, during a chase. The bold stripes of a herd of running Zebra have been claimed {{make it difficult for}} predators to estimate the prey's speed and direction accurately, or to identify individual animals, giving the prey an improved chance of escape. Since dazzle patterns (such as the Zebra's stripes) make animals harder to catch when moving, but easier to detect when stationary, there is an evolutionary trade-off between dazzle and camouflage. Another theory is that the zebra's stripes could provide some protection from flies and <b>biting</b> <b>insects.</b>|$|E
5|$|An {{animal that}} is {{commonly}} {{thought to be}} dazzle-patterned is the zebra. The bold stripes of the zebra have been claimed to be disruptive camouflage, background-blending and countershading. After many years in which {{the purpose of the}} coloration was disputed, an experimental study by Tim Caro suggested in 2012 that the pattern reduces the attractiveness of stationary models to biting flies such as horseflies and tsetse flies. However, a simulation study by Martin How and Johannes Zanker in 2014 suggests that when moving, the stripes may confuse observers, such as mammalian predators and <b>biting</b> <b>insects,</b> by two visual illusions: the wagon-wheel effect, where the perceived motion is inverted, and the barberpole illusion, where the perceived motion is in a wrong direction.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} bird families, {{pelicans}} {{are susceptible to}} a variety of parasites. Specialist feather lice of the genus Piagetella are found in the pouches of all species of pelican, but are otherwise only known from New World and Antarctic cormorants. Avian malaria is carried by the mosquito Culex pipens, and high densities of these <b>biting</b> <b>insects</b> may force pelican colonies to be abandoned. Leeches may attach to the vent or sometimes the inside of the pouch. A study of the parasites of the American white pelican found 75 different species, including tapeworms, flukes, flies, fleas, ticks and nematodes. Many of these do little harm, but flies may be implicated in the death of nestlings, particularly if they are weak or unwell, and the soft tick Ornithodoros capensis sometimes causes adults to desert the nest. Many pelican parasites are found in other bird groups, but several lice are very host-specific.|$|E
50|$|The bay {{is often}} thought by locals {{to have been}} named for a small <b>biting</b> <b>insect</b> known as the sandfly, but this is incorrect. It was named for the sand which, given the windy nature of this coast, flies from the tall dunes {{surrounding}} the bay.|$|R

5|$|Real estate {{companies}} {{continued to}} advertise and sell land along newly dug canals. In April 1912—the {{end of the}} dry season—reporters {{from all over the}} U.S. were given a tour of what had recently been drained, and they returned to their papers and raved about the progress. Land developers sold 20,000lots in a few months. But as news about the Wright report continued to be negative, land values plummeted, and sales decreased. Developers were sued and arrested for mail fraud when people who had spent their life savings to buy land arrived in south Florida expecting to find a dry parcel of land to build upon and instead found it completely underwater. Advertisements promised land that would yield crops in eight weeks, but for many it took at least as long just to clear. Some burned off the sawgrass or other vegetation only to discover that the underlying peat continued to burn. Animals and tractors used for plowing got mired in the muck and were useless. When the muck dried, it turned to a fine black powder and created dust storms. Settlers encountered rodents, skinks, and <b>biting</b> <b>insects,</b> and faced dangers from mosquitoes, poisonous snakes and alligators. Though at first crops sprouted quickly and lushly, they just as quickly wilted and died, seemingly without reason. It was discovered later that the peat and muck lacked copper and other trace elements. The USDA released a pamphlet in 1915 that declared land along the New River Canal would be too costly to keep drained and fertilized; people in Ft.Lauderdale responded by collecting all of the pamphlets and burning them.|$|E

50|$|The Blandford fly (Simulium posticatum) is {{a species}} of black fly, a <b>biting</b> <b>insect</b> found in Europe, Turkey and western Siberia. It spends its larval stage in the weedbeds of slow flowing rivers and when the fly emerges, the female seeks a blood meal before mating. It usually bites the lower legs causing pain, itching and swelling. Scratching the irritated areas can lead to breaks in the skin, after which {{secondary}} infection may set in.|$|R
50|$|Agada Tantra {{is defined}} as a section of {{toxicology}} that deals with food poisoning, snakebites, dog <b>bites,</b> <b>insect</b> <b>bites,</b> etc. The school of toxicology was founded and expounded upon by Kashyapa, also known as Vriddhakashyapa, a contemporary of Atreya Punarvasu. He lived in Taksashila in what is now Pakistan. His text was called the Kashyapa Samhita. This, however, is a different book than the Kashyap Samhita of pediatrics. This text is not available now but the references of this text are found mentioned in different commentaries. Some other texts written by Alambayana, Ushana, Saunaka, and Latyayana were known to exist. However except for references to them, the original texts are no longer available.|$|R

25|$|After {{considering}} the various suspected agents, Portaels et al. proposed {{the hypothesis that}} human beings, as well as domestic and wild animals, could be contaminated or infected by <b>biting</b> <b>insects</b> such as water bugs. Aquatic bugs are cosmopolite insects found throughout temperate and tropical regions especially rich in freshwater. They represent about 10% of all species of Hemiptera associated with water and belong to two series of the suborder Heteroptera: the Nepomorpha, which include four superfamilies whose members {{spend most of their}} time under water, and the Naucoridae, which include a single family, the Naucoridae, whose members are commonly termed creeping water bugs.|$|E
25|$|Silk's {{absorbency}} {{makes it}} {{comfortable to wear}} in warm weather and while active. Its low conductivity keeps warm air close to the skin during cold weather. It is often used for clothing such as shirts, ties, blouses, formal dresses, high fashion clothes, lining, lingerie, pajamas, robes, dress suits, sun dresses and Eastern folk costumes. For practical use, silk is excellent as clothing that protects from many <b>biting</b> <b>insects</b> that would ordinarily pierce clothing, such as mosquitoes and horseflies. Silk's attractive lustre and drape makes it suitable for many furnishing applications. It is used for upholstery, wall coverings, window treatments (if blended with another fiber), rugs, bedding and wall hangings. While on the decline now, due to artificial fibers, silk has had many industrial and commercial uses, such as in parachutes, bicycle tires, comforter filling and artillery gunpowder bags.|$|E
30|$|Gloriosa superba L., {{belongs to}} Colchicaceae family. It is a perennial, greenish, {{climbing}} herb and nativity of South Africa.

The tuber powder was effectively used against paralysis, rheumatism, snake <b>bite,</b> <b>insect</b> <b>bites,</b> against lice, intermittent fevers, wounds, anti-fertility, gonorrhea, leprosy, piles, debility, dyspepsia, flatulence, hemorrhoids, helminthiasis and inflammations [13]. It contains two major alkaloids namely colchicines (C 22 H 25 NO 6) and colchicosides (C 27 H 33 O 11 N). The seeds consist of colchicines, which are 2 – 5 times {{higher than in the}} tubers [14]. Leaves contain cholidonic, superbine, colchicine, gloriosol, phytosterils and stigmasterin [15].|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{ascertain}} whether patients with eczema {{are more prone to}} being <b>bitten</b> by <b>insects</b> than those with other dermatoses, data were collected by interview and questionnaire from 496 patients attending the outpatient department of a hospital in Sydney and a general dermatological practice in Geelong, Australia. Of the 93 patients with eczema 65 % claimed they were prone to <b>insect</b> <b>bite</b> and that they were bitten in preference to other people when in a group, compared with 17 % of the 403 patients with other chronic dermatoses. Similar proportions of both groups (approximately 50 %) had used insect repellents. Excluding those with eczema 30 % of the 149 patients with a family history of atopy claimed they were prone to being <b>bitten</b> by <b>insects</b> compared with 8 % of the 254 patients without a family history of atopy. There was no difference in the prevalence of eczema or family history of atopy between men and women, but more women felt themselves to be susceptible to <b>insect</b> <b>bites</b> than men. There is evidence that patients with eczema and those with a family history of atopy are prone to being <b>bitten</b> by <b>insects.</b> Further confirmatory work, perhaps using volunteers and mosquitoes, is indicated. However, patients with severe eczema or a family history of atopy should take care when travelling to areas where disease-carrying insects are prevalent...|$|R
25|$|Hepatitis C {{virus is}} {{predominantly}} a blood-borne virus, with very low risk of sexual or vertical transmission. Because of {{this mode of}} spread the key groups at risk are injecting drug users (IDUs), recipients of blood products and sometimes patients on haemodialysis. Common setting for transmission of HCV is also intra-hospital (nosocomial) transmission, when practices of hygiene and sterilization are not correctly followed in the clinic. A number of cultural or ritual practices have been proposed as a potential historical mode of spread for hepatitis C virus, including circumcision, genital mutilation, ritual scarification, traditional tattooing and acupuncture. It has also been argued that given the extremely prolonged periods of persistence of HCV in humans, even very low and undetectable rates of mechanical transmission via <b>biting</b> <b>insects</b> may be sufficient to maintain endemic infection in the tropic, where people receive large number of insect bites.|$|E
25|$|The {{striping}} {{pattern of}} the zebra is unique among sympatric ungulates. One suggested function for the stripes is to provide crypsis for the animal in tall grass or in the dappled shade beneath bushes and trees. However, cryptically coloured species, such as the kudu and bushbuck, tend to be quiet and stealthy. They freeze when there is danger and flee only at the last moment. By contrast, the zebra is active and noisy, and makes no attempt to hide itself. Another suggestion is motion camouflage, that the stripes affect a predator's judgement of the zebra's size, distance and what direction it is going in. A 2014 study supports this hypothesis, finding that, when moving, the stripes may confuse observers, such as mammalian predators and <b>biting</b> <b>insects,</b> via two visual illusions, the wagon wheel effect, where the perceived motion is inverted, and the barber pole illusion, where the perceived motion is in a wrong direction. A related hypothesis is that the stripes {{make it difficult for}} a predator to single out and learn about an individual during a chase.|$|E
500|$|Thirty to 45 foals {{are born}} into the Chincoteague herd each year. The annual Pony Pennings are used to {{maintain}} the herd size at around 150 animals. Since 1943, the FWS {{has been working on}} the island to protect and increase the wildfowl population, and their efforts have sometimes endangered the Chincoteague herd. Due to the placement of fences by the FWS, a reduced amount of land is available for grazing by the ponies. The fencing also prevents them from reaching the sea, where they often went to escape <b>biting</b> <b>insects,</b> including mosquitos. [...] In 1962, several ponies were trapped in an enclosure by high water and died when they were carried out to sea during a storm. Unlike the Maryland herd, ponies on the Virginia side of the island are fenced off from roadways to prevent auto accidents and to discourage visitors from feeding the ponies.|$|E
40|$|During {{the summer}} of 2006, Fairbanks Alaska {{experienced}} its first two known cases of fatal anaphylaxis {{as a result of}} Hymenoptera stings, presumably from yellowjackets. An increase in <b>insect</b> <b>bites</b> and stings has been observed throughout the state. Has there been an increased incidence of medical visits due to <b>insect</b> <b>bites</b> and stings in Alaska in recent years? We conducted a retrospective review of three independent patient databases in Alaska to identify trends of patients seeking medical care for adverse reactions following <b>insect</b> <b>bites</b> and stings. For each database, an <b>insect</b> <b>bite</b> or sting episode warranting medical care was defined as a claim for the Clinical Modification of the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD- 9 -CM), codes E 905. 3 (venomous insect; Hymenoptera); E 906. 4 (bite; non-venomous arthropod), and 989. 5 (toxic effect; venom). Increases in bite and sting events in each region were compared to temperature changes in the same region. Each database revealed a statistically significant trend in patients seeking care for reactions to <b>insect</b> <b>bites</b> and stings. Fairbanks Memorial Hospital Emergency Department reported a four-fold increase in patients in 2006 compared to previous years (1992 - 2005). The Allergy Asthma and Immunology Center of Alaska reported a three-fold increase in patients from 1999 - 2002 to 2003 - 2007. A retrospective review of the Alaska Medicaid database between 1999 and 2006 showed increases in billings for <b>insect</b> <b>bites</b> and stings among all regions, with the largest percentage increases occurring in the most northern areas. Alaska has experienced an increase in <b>insect</b> <b>bites</b> and stings, most dramatically indicated by two anaphylaxis deaths due to Hymenoptera stings.
