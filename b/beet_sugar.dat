5|$|In {{the fall}} of the year 1799, a {{translation}} of Franz Carl Achard's ground-breaking work on the production of sugar from beets appeared in Nicholson's Journal. Until that time, sugar cane, which was grown overseas, was the only plant from which sugar could be derived. This information made possible the creation of a domestic sugar industry, and was greeted with great interest. A short time after the article's publication, Accum had samples of <b>beet</b> <b>sugar</b> sent from Berlin, and presented them to William Nicholson. This was the first time sugar derived from beets had ever been present in England. Following his careful analysis of both types of sugar, Nicholson published a detailed report in the January edition of his journal, stating that there was no appreciable difference in taste between the two.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 1880s various European {{countries}} had imposed {{a ban on}} importation of United States pork out of an unconfirmed concern of trichinosis; at issue was over one billion pounds of pork products with a value of $80 million (annually). Harrison engaged Whitelaw Reid, minister to France, and William Walter Phelps, minister to Germany, to restore these exports for the country without delay. Harrison also successfully asked the congress to enact the Meat Inspection Act to eliminate the accusations of product compromise. The president also partnered with Agriculture Secretary Rusk to threaten Germany with retaliation – by initiating an embargo in the U.S. against Germany's highly demanded <b>beet</b> <b>sugar.</b> By September 1891 Germany relented, and was soon followed by Denmark, France and Austria-Hungary.|$|E

25|$|A genetically {{modified}} <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> is a <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> {{that has been}} genetically engineered by the direct manipulation of its genome using biotechnology. Commercialized GM <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> make use of a glyphosate-resistance modification developed by Monsanto and KWS Saat. These glyphosate-resistant beets, also called 'Roundup Ready' <b>sugar</b> <b>beets,</b> were developed by 2000, but not commercialized until 2007. <b>Sugar</b> <b>beets</b> are allowed a Maximum Residue Limit of glyphosate of 15 mg/Kg for international trade. As of 2016, GM <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> are grown in the United States and Canada. In the United States, they {{play an important role}} in domestic sugar production.

40|$|In this investigation, the {{production}} of ethanol from the raw <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> juice and raw <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> cossettes has been studied. For ethanol production from the raw <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> juice, batch and fed-batch cultivation techniques in the stirred tank bioreactor were used, while batch ethanol production from the raw <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> cossettes {{was carried out in}} hori-zontal rotating tubular bioreactor (HRTB). In both cases, Saccharomyces cerevisiae was used as a production microorganism. During batch ethanol production from the raw <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> juice, ethanol yield was 59. 89 g/L and production efficiency 78. 8 %, and in fed-batch pro-cess the yield was 92. 78 g/L and efficiency 93. 4 %. At the same time, ethanol production in HRTB from the raw <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> cossettes with inoculum of 16. 7 % V/m (raw <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> cossettes) resulted in the highest ethanol yield of 54. 53 g/L and production efficiency of 79. 5 %.

25|$|White refined is {{the most}} common form of sugar in North America and Europe. Refined sugar is made by {{dissolving}} and purifying raw sugar using phosphoric acid similar to the method used for blanco directo, a carbonatation process involving calcium hydroxide and carbon dioxide, or by various filtration strategies.

25|$|<b>Beet</b> <b>sugar</b> {{comes from}} regions with cooler climates: {{northwest}} and eastern Europe, northern Japan, plus some {{areas in the}} United States (including California). In the northern hemisphere, the beet-growing season ends with the start of harvesting around September. Harvesting and processing continues until March in some cases. The availability of processing plant capacity and the weather both influence the duration of harvesting and processing– the industry can store harvested beets until processed, but a frost-damaged beet becomes effectively unprocessable.|$|E

25|$|Different {{techniques}} are employed {{to adjust the}} level of sugar in the grape must. In the normal chaptalization process, cane sugar {{is the most common}} type of sugar added, although some winemakers prefer <b>beet</b> <b>sugar</b> or corn syrup. In many wine regions, brown sugar is an illegal additive, and in regions that disallow chaptalization altogether, grape concentrate may be added. After sugar is added to the must, naturally occurring enzymes break down the sucrose molecules in sugar into glucose and fructose, which are then fermented by the yeast and converted into alcohol and carbon dioxide.|$|E
25|$|Past {{industries}} {{were more}} strongly {{connected to the}} rural economy, such as a <b>beet</b> <b>sugar</b> factory in Scawby Brook, a livestock market, and Spring's jam factory; the latter being a nationally known brand.

Scawby Brook was also home to Bratleys roller flour mill, which was demolished in the 1940s although several of the old houses built for the mill owners in the 1830s remain, formerly known as mill place, now numbers 83-91 Scawby Road. The town was home to the Falcon Cycles factory for much of its independent existence, the company having moved to Brigg from nearby Barton-upon-Humber in the early 1900s.|$|E
25|$|Henry Blackwell {{was born}} May 4, 1832, in Bristol, Gloucestershire, England, the seventh of nine {{children}} of Samuel Blackwell and Hannah Lane Blackwell. Blackwell's father, a sugar refiner whose livelihood conflicted with his abolitionist principles, experimented with making <b>beet</b> <b>sugar</b> {{as an alternative}} to slave-grown cane sugar. In 1832, the family – including eight children and their father's sister Mary – emigrated to the United States. The family settled first in New York, where Blackwell's father established a sugar refinery and the ninth child was born, and then just outside New York in Jersey City. Blackwell's father took an interest in the nascent abolition movement, and William Lloyd Garrison other leaders were visitors in the family's home. Blackwell's eldest sister, Anna, participated in the emerging agitation for women's rights, attending the 1837 Anti-Slavery Convention of American Women and drafting its letter to John Quincy Adams thanking him for his support of women's right to petition.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{process of}} {{intensive}} transformation {{to which the}} <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> market in the European Union has been subject {{in recent years in}} order to meet the external obligations set by the WTO Panel, has had a severe impact on <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> production in Poland. Two major observations have been reported, namely a significant decrease of number of <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> farms and a reduction in those areas of tillage surfaces intended for <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> cultivation. It is worth mentioning that <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> is highly important to crop rotation and hardly any other plant in European agriculture can replace it. There is therefore both a strong need and a great opportunity for the further support and development of <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> production. As the interna-tional obligation to reduce greenhouse gas emission became effective, interest in biomass us-age as a viable alternative to fossil fuels increased. This study thus set out to perform an eco-nomic comparison in respect of the use of <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> for traditional purposes and for energy, and to conduct an economic analysis of the income obtained from the sale of electrical energy sale by a biogas facility where <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> were used for biogas production. The comparative analysis was carried out taking both incomes from <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> production for <b>sugar</b> and root and leaf production for biogas into consideration. The results are very promising and allow the postulation that the use of <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> for biogas production provides an excellent opportu-nity for reviving defunct sugar plants and increasing the tillage surface for <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> in Poland.

50|$|In the United States, genetically {{modified}} <b>sugar</b> <b>beets,</b> engineered for resistance to glyphosate, a herbicide marketed as Roundup, {{were developed by}} Monsanto as a {{genetically modified}} crop. In 2005, the US Department of Agriculture-Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA-APHIS) deregulated glyphosate-resistant <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> after it conducted an environmental assessment and determined glyphosate-resistant <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> were highly unlikely to become a plant pest. Sugar from glyphosate-resistant <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> has been approved for human and animal consumption in multiple countries, but commercial production of biotech beets has been approved only in the United States and Canada. Studies have concluded the sugar from glyphosate-resistant <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> has the same nutritional value as sugar from conventional <b>sugar</b> <b>beets.</b> After deregulation in 2005, glyphosate-resistant <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> were extensively adopted in the United States. About 95% of <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> acres in the US were planted with glyphosate-resistant seed in 2011.|$|R
25|$|From 1834 to 1849, {{when the}} first migrations of indentured laborers began, no fixed depot had been {{established}} to accommodate the immigrants arriving in Port Louis. The thousands of migrants arriving annually put a stress {{on the lack of}} a specialized facility. In 1849, a building dating back to the French administration in the Trou Fanfaron area was chosen as the core of a planned structural complex that would become the permanent depot for immigration. The Immigration Depot, as it came to be known, was continuously enlarged in response to the high number of migrants. This lasted until 1857, when all the available land had been occupied. The adequate space allowed the facility to deal with as much as 1,000 prospective laborers at any one time. Further modifications, for the purpose of service convenience, hygiene and transport, were continuously done. However, the competition from <b>beet</b> <b>sugar</b> caught up with Mauritius’s sugar cane estates. The spread of a malaria epidemic in the 1860s further drove shipping away from the colony, leading to a decline of indentured immigration, culminating in 1923, when it had completely ceased. By then, an estimated 450,000 indentured laborers from India had passed through the Immigration Depot throughout its existence.|$|E

500|$|Ashkenazi Jews {{living in}} Eastern Europe adopted {{beetroot}} borscht from their Slavic neighbors and adapted {{it to their}} taste and religious requirements.

Both variants typically contain beetroots and onions, and are flavored with beet sour, vinegar or citric acid for tartness and <b>beet</b> <b>sugar</b> for sweetness. Galician Jews traditionally liked their borscht particularly sweet. Jewish borscht may be served either hot or cold, typically with a hot boiled potato on the side.

500|$|The first {{large-scale}} {{application of}} strontium {{was in the}} production of sugar from sugar beet. Although a crystallisation process using strontium hydroxide was patented by Augustin-Pierre Dubrunfaut in 1849 the large scale introduction came with the improvement of the process in the early 1870s. The German sugar industry used the process well into the 20th century. Before World War I the <b>beet</b> <b>sugar</b> industry used [...] 100,000 to 150,000 tons of strontium hydroxide for this process per year. The strontium hydroxide was recycled in the process, but the demand to substitute losses during production was high enough to create a significant demand initiating mining of strontianite in the Münsterland. The [...] mining of strontianite in Germany ended when mining of the celestine deposits in Gloucestershire started. These mines supplied most of the world strontium supply from 1884 to 1941.
