40|$|This {{paper is}} part of an ongoing {{research}} on the trajectory of rhetoric of political reforms in Bahrain during the past 10 -years of reign by king Hamad bin Isa. Within less than two years of his reign, the king abandoned his wide ranging blueprints for political and institutional reforms designed to end to a decade-long civil unrest. I argue that the king continues to use, albeit more creatively, several of the instruments of rule employed by the authoritarian regime of his father. One of these instruments is reliance on naturalization, tajnees to achieve a variety of demographic, political and social objectives. Following his accession to throne in March 1999, King Hamad bin Isa exercised this right to grant citizenship, en masse, to several hundreds of <b>bidoons.</b> The move was heartily hailed by various political groupings in the country. The legal procedures of naturalization are clearly specified in Bahraini’s constitution and laws. These include living continuously in the country for at least 15 years. However, the monarch has a discretionary power to grant citizenship to persons who do not meet the specified requirements. Since 1999, the process of tajnees has expanded through generous reliance on the royal discretionary power to grant citizenship. The number of Bahraini citizens rose from some 409, 619 in 2001 to 527, 433 in 2007. Beneficiaries of tajnees include people who are not even resident of the country. Critics of tajnees allege that the process as an abuse of the king’s constitutional privileges. They also note that the process of tajnees lacks transparency and is carried out without proper parliamentary insight. Several sets objectives are cited by critics of the current forms of tajnees in Bahrain. They allege that the regime hopes to alter the demographic structure of the country, a claim that explains why most beneficiaries of the royal tajnees are Sunnis hailing from Baluchistan, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Yemen¬. En masse naturalization provides the regime with a demographic pool for recruiting personnel to man the expanding Bahrain’s military and security apparatuses. The availability of this pool of loyal citizens would allow the regime to maintain the current ban on Shia joining these services. Another criticism of tajnees refers to the electoral considerations which encourage the regime to enfranchise categories of residents and non-residents of the country in order to help pro-regime groups to prevail in parliamentary and municipal elections. Further, I contend that the current forms of tajnees could lead to institutionalizing ’differentiated citizenship’, where rights and entitlements are allocated on the basis of group characteristics backgrounds and loyalty to the king. While differentiated citizenship may be advantageous instrument of authoritarian rule, it is highly risky and could generate problems of its own. In the long term, differentiated citizenship increases constrains against social integration. It also limits incentives to cultivate national cohesion as it links citizenship rights and entitlement to belonging to {{one or the other of}} the citizenship categories...|$|R
50|$|The {{problem of}} {{stateless}} people (known as <b>Bidoon)</b> {{has been around}} for so many years. Many have languished without proper care, even though many of them are natives of the land. These people {{have not been able to}} complete their education, secure jobs and have found it hard to marry. A small number of them have been able to acquire UAE nationality or that of Comoros Island.|$|E
50|$|In January 2010, the {{government}} of Kuwait initiated crackdowns on freedom of expression and assembly. Such crackdowns included the use of violent force and the restriction of public gatherings. Whitson condemned the Kuwaiti government’s violation of freedom of expression and revealed that {{the government}} has grown “more and comfortable harassing Kuwaitis who dared to criticize the government.”In January 2012, police in Kuwait used tear gas and batons in order to crack down on <b>bidoon</b> demonstrators that were calling for citizenship and other basic rights. Following violent clashes, Whitson released a statement condemning the Kuwaiti government’s use of excessive force, citing that the government’s crackdowns are “a shameful effort to curb the rights to peaceful expression and assembly of Kuwait’s bidoons.”In April 2013, a court in Kuwait sentenced a politician from the opposition {{to five years in prison}} after he insulted the Emir of Kuwait. The ruling sparked outrage in the region and Whitson echoed similar sentiments in an interview with The New York Times. She stated that the sentencing reflected “dangerous backsliding in Kuwait, stifling the country’s lively and relatively free political debates, in a whole series of jail sentences against activists and politicians alike”.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{the causes and}} characteristics of mobilisation in the country s stateless community. There are more than 106 000 stateless Arabs, locally known as <b>Bidoon,</b> living in Kuwait today. In {{the wake of the}} uprisings that erupted throughout the Middle East during the winter of 2010 - 11, parts of the <b>Bidoon</b> population in Kuwait took to the streets and demanded citizenship and rights. The mobilisation of Bidoons was something new in Kuwait. Bidoons were well integrated in the Kuwaiti society and they constituted the backbone of the Kuwaiti Army until 1986. Following the Iraqi invasion and the US-led liberation in 1991 they were deprived of all rights and treated as illegal residents. This thesis identifies a governmental policy that has resulted in a hierarchy among Bidoons. This, combined with imminent threats of deportation and further deprivation confined Bidoons ability to demand rights. When Bidoons finally started protesting they did so because they no longer tolerated the discrimination and repression. Instead they identified themselves as victims of an unjust policy and they found that the only way their situation could be improved was by imposing pressure on the government. The mobilisation of Bidoons was assisted by support from Kuwaiti citizens and enabled by Bidoons access to technology and information. The <b>Bidoon</b> community remains affected by decades of discrimination, and this paper analyses how this affects the mobilisation of two groups working for <b>Bidoon</b> rights. Nevertheless, the <b>Bidoon</b> rights movement have succeeded in imposing significant pressure on the regime in Kuwait, and Kuwaiti politicians are compelled to find {{a solution to the problem}} of statelessness.

40|$|For {{many of the}} Arab Gulf countries, {{non-national}} populations {{constitute the}} majority of the population, with the discrepancy between the size of the national and non-national populations continuing to grow. It is in this context that the role played by these non-national populations becomes critically important. In my paper, I argue that exclusion of non-national populations from state-sponsored national identities, as manifest through citizenship rights, plays a pivotal role in fostering imagined national identities and communities among the local Arab Gulf citizens. The study considers two cases in particular: the <b>bidoon</b> (stateless) of Kuwait and middle-class Indian migrants in Dubai. Using a variety of primary and secondary sources, I explore {{the ways in which the}} two aforementioned populations are excluded, how they contended with their exclusion, and finally attempt reconcile what, in broad terms, constitutes the overarching khaleeji – Gulf – identity that this exclusion has sought to foster. On one hand, the study finds that the <b>bidoon</b> of Kuwait 2 ̆ 7 s pursuit of inclusion is rooted in their ethnic heritage as Arabs and the Kuwaiti, tribal-rooted national identity. On the other hand, the middle-class Indian migrants of Dubai embrace their exclusion because of their self-perceived temporariness in the city and instead exhibit a sense of dual-belonging. In light of this, the study considers how the resultant khaleeji identity crystalizes around its exceptions and exclusions, while highlighting the performative and nationalistic aspects of it...|$|E
40|$|This project traces how and {{why people}} "without" [bidoon] {{citizenship}} emerged as {{a problem in the}} United Arab Emirates in the 2000 s. It examines the reasons the government refuses to grant them citizenship despite regular complaints that citizens are "outnumbered" by migrants. Chapter 2 draws on archived British documents and other sources to show the new forms of sovereignty over territory and population that emerged as colonial interests shifted from control of waterways to control of land and fossil fuels. It analyzes the shifting power dynamics between British colonial powers and local rulers, and the legal developments that preceded the formation of the federation in 1971. The historical approach demonstrates the fluidity in power relations and the later tensions produced by multiple jurisdictions that were in fact encouraged by British colonial rule. Chapter 3 draws on scholarship, government sources, news, laws and decrees to show how the bidoons were casualties of a larger population project related to consolidating "federal" rule. It considers citizenship-related UAE laws and procedures between 1971 and 2011 and discusses turning points and major sources of demographic and political tension and the ways these have produced the problem of the <b>bidoon</b> in the UAE. The chapter also discusses state “security” discourse and cultural anxieties felt by Emirati citizens in relation to non-citizens and migrants and how bidoons articulate their frustrations and make claims for citizenship online. Chapter 4, which relies on blogs and news outlets, focuses on the dominant explanatory accounts for why bidoons, who speak the regional Arabic dialect and have lived there for generations, are refused citizenship. Ultimately, these accounts are insufficient as explanations for why the <b>bidoon</b> problem remains. Honors thesis, awarded highest honor...|$|E
