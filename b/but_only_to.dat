5|$|After the February Revolution, the {{condition}} of the ships was assessed on 28 April 1917. The ship that was furthest along was the Ismail: her hull, engines, and boilers were around 65% complete, and her armour was 36% complete. Her turrets, however, were not expected to be completed until 1919. The Congress of Shipyard Workers decided to continue work on the Izmail in mid-1917, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> provide jobs. The Provisional Government halted all work on Borodino, Kinburn, and Navarin on 24 October 1917, and the Soviet Supreme Naval College ordered work on Izmail halted on 14 December 1917.|$|E

It was extended south to Rye , then rerouted to follow Westchester Avenue east to Port Chester by the following year. Most of NY120's former routing to Rye became part of New York State Route119A at that time. NY120 was rerouted to serve Rye again in October1960, replacing NY119A.|$|E

By the end of June the Phillies had increased their division lead, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> two and a half games.|$|E
5|$|In December 1974, the Council bought Bridgwater Dock from British Railways. The {{concrete}} wall across the barge lock was removed, {{but there was}} no intention to restore the ship lock. By 1980, the Council had invested over £50,000 in the restoration, which included Kings and Standards locks, and the bottom gates of Newtown Lock. Some bridges had been raised, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> , which allowed canoeing, but prevented bigger boats from using the waterway. Work on the deep cutting between West Street and Albert Street started in September 1978, jointly funded by the County Council and Sedgemoor District Council, using direct labour, while a Manpower Services Commission scheme to dredge the canal from the dock to the cutting and to widen the towpath was funded by the District Council in 1981.|$|E
5|$|Most {{forms of}} {{camouflage}} are ineffective when the camouflaged animal or object moves, because the motion is easily {{seen by the}} observing predator, prey or enemy. However, insects such as hoverflies and dragonflies use motion camouflage: the hoverflies to approach possible mates, and the dragonflies to approach rivals when defending territories. Motion camouflage is achieved by moving so as to stay on a straight line between the target and a fixed point in the landscape; the pursuer thus appears not to move, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> loom larger in the target's field of vision. The same technique {{can be used for}} military purposes, for example by missiles to minimise their risk of detection by the enemy. However, missile engineers, and animals such as bats, use the technique primarily for its efficiency rather than camouflage.|$|E

5|$|NY33 was {{assigned}} in the mid-1920s, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> {{the portion of}} its modern routing between Batavia and Rochester. It was extended on both ends—to Buffalo {{in the west and}} Marion in the east—as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York; however, the eastern extension was eliminated in 1949. In Buffalo, NY33 was moved onto the Kensington Expressway in the mid-1960s, and its former surface routing along Genesee Street subsequently became the short-lived New York State Route33B. Smaller realignments in the years since have moved NY33's western terminus from the heart of downtown Buffalo to the northern fringe of the city's center.|$|E
5|$|Normandie and Languedoc {{were ordered}} on 12 December 1912, {{followed}} by Flandre and Gascogne on 30 July 1913. Béarn was ordered on 3 December; the five ships would permit {{the creation of}} two four-ship divisions with the three Bretagne-class ships then under construction. Work on the class was suspended at the outbreak of World War I, as all resources were needed for the Army. The government did not immediately mobilize for war, as they expected the conflict to be brief. The first four ships were launched {{after the start of}} the war, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> clear the slipways for other purposes. In July 1915, the Navy determined that the ships were not a priority, and prohibited further work. Later in July, work on the ships' armament was suspended, save the guns themselves, which could be converted for use by the Army. Four of the completed 340mm guns were converted into railway guns for the French Army. Nine of the guns built for Languedoc were also mounted on railway carriages in 1919, {{after the end of the}} war. Several of the 138.6mm guns were also converted for service with the Army.|$|E
5|$|The Court neither {{expressly}} rejected nor {{affirmed the}} abolition of the distinction in Anisminic and its effect on the effectiveness of ouster clauses. Instead, the Court cited UK authorities holding that ouster clauses are ineffective when there has been an absence of jurisdiction or an excess of jurisdiction {{on the part of the}} decision-maker, a position which characterized the law prior to Anisminic. The Court did refer to Anisminic <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> observe that the House of Lords had held the ouster clause involved in that case to be irrelevant because a purported determination by the Foreign Compensation Commission which was legally incorrect could not be considered a real determination and had no effect at all. Ultimately, the Court quashed the order made by the Industrial Arbitration Court because it contained an error of law which had caused that court to exceed its jurisdiction.|$|E

5|$|The band's debut album, 30 Seconds to Mars (2002), was {{produced}} by Bob Ezrin and released to positive reviews <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> limited commercial success. The band achieved worldwide fame {{with the release of}} their second album A Beautiful Lie (2005), which received multiple certifications all over the world, including platinum in the United States. Their next release, This Is War (2009), showed a dramatic evolution in the band's musical style, as they incorporated experimental music as well as eclectic influences. The recording process of the album was marked by a legal dispute with record label EMI that eventually became the subject of the documentary film Artifact (2012). Thirty Seconds to Mars then moved to Universal Music and released the fourth album, Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams (2013), to critical and commercial success. As of September 2014, the band had sold over 15 million albums worldwide.|$|E
5|$|The conference {{began in}} the evening of September 29, 1920. The Polish {{delegation}} was led by colonel Mieczysław Mackiewicz (who originated from Lithuania), and the Lithuanian delegation by general Maksimas Katche. Lithuania proposed an immediate armistice, but the Polish delegation refused. Only after the Lithuanian delegation threatened to leave the negotiation table did Poland agree to stop fighting, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> {{the east of the}} Neman River (the Suwałki Region). Fighting {{to the west of the}} river continued. The Polish delegates demanded that the Lithuanians allow the Polish forces to use a portion of the Warsaw– Saint Petersburg Railway and the train station in Varėna (Orany). The Lithuanians refused: their major forces were concentrated in the Suwałki Region and moving them to protect Vilnius without the railway would be extremely difficult. The Lithuanian side was ready to give up the Suwałki Region in exchange for Poland's recognition of the Lithuanian claims to Vilnius.|$|E
5|$|With the Byzantine army {{shattered}} and routed, the Muslims quickly recaptured {{the territory}} that they conquered prior to Yarmouk. The Muslim forces moved south to a last Byzantine stronghold, Jerusalem, {{where many of}} the Byzantine survivors of the disaster at Yarmouk took shelter. The Siege of Jerusalem lasted four months after which the city agreed to surrender, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> the caliph in person. Amr ibn al-Aas, one of the four corps commander, suggested that Khalid should be sent as caliph, because of his very strong resemblance with Caliph Umar. Khalid was recognized and eventually, Umar came and Jerusalem surrendered in April 637. After Jerusalem, the Muslim armies broke up once again. Yazid’s corps came to Damascus and captured Beirut. Amr and Shurhabil’s corps went on to conquer the rest of Palestine, while Abu Ubaidah and Khalid, {{at the head of a}} 17,000 strong army moved north to conquer whole of the Northern Syria.|$|E

5|$|Logan {{remained}} the Military Administrator and British representative to Samoa {{until the end}} of the war. At the time of its seizure, Samoa was politically stable and its economy was based on its plantations which were mainly German owned. Apart from replacing most of the key officials, who were Germans, with New Zealanders, he largely followed existing policies but over time made a series of misjudgements. The German-owned plantations were allowed to continue to operate <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> trade with neutral or Allied countries. By 1916, most of the larger plantations were seized and placed into receivership when it was discovered that they were still trading with German companies. This placed considerable financial stress on the economy. Not long into Logan's administration, an uprising of Chinese labourers, who complained about their rations, had to be suppressed. He continued to restrict their civil liberties and over time most were repatriated back to China. By not implementing quarantine procedures, he significantly mishandled the arrival of the influenza pandemic in November 1918, which resulted in over 7,500 deaths. This represented over 20% of Samoa's population at the time. In the meantime, neighbouring American Samoa was quarantined by its Governor, John Martin Poyer, and consequently had no influenza deaths.|$|E
