5|$|Extensive {{tests have}} been carried out on fish we put in the river and we are {{satisfied}} that the water will support fish life. Roach and perch have already been caught and we have had no reports of any ill-effects. There is no doubt the pollution is clearing. It will <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> job, but we are sure there is a future for angling in the river.|$|E
5|$|Bennett {{pulled his}} first {{selection}} surprise of 2007, experimenting with Hunt at halfback {{for the opening}} game of the season. At the time Bennett maintained that this would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> term switch, but due to the Broncos' poor form, Hunt returned to fullback for Round 3. Hunt was selected {{to play for the}} Australian national team at fullback in the 2007 ANZAC Test match against New Zealand, scoring a try in the Kangaroos' 30-6 victory.|$|E
5|$|Mary, disspirited, yields to Gilmore's importunements, warning {{him that}} theirs must <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> {{engagement}} {{and that she}} will end it if Captain Marrable finds himself able to marry a woman without a fortune. This comes to pass: {{the death of the}} Captain's cousin, the heir to the family's baronetcy, makes him the likely eventual heir. The current Baronet accepts the Captain as his heir, buying out the Colonel's interest to prevent his squandering the family fortune. The two lovers are reunited, leaving Gilmore bitter and despondent.|$|E

5|$|On August 10, 2012, U.S. Figure Skating {{announced}} that an agreement {{had been reached}} and Lysacek would return to competition at the 2012 Skate America. He withdrew after aggravating a groin injury. On November 20, 2012, Lysacek underwent surgery to repair a torn muscle in his lower abdomen, i.e. a sports hernia, with an expected period of six weeks off the ice. In January 2013, he withdrew from the 2013 U.S. Championships, saying he was healthy but needed an additional three weeks to return to competition form. Carroll said it would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> recovery.|$|E
5|$|Sloan Gibson, who {{had been}} Acting Secretary between the time of Shinseki's {{resignation}} and McDonald's taking office, is now Deputy Secretary. He said on August 6, 2014 that more punishments were planned for VA officials for their roles in the scandal. The VA announced the week prior to Gibson's statement that two supervisors would be fired and four other employees would be disciplined for their roles in falsifying data in Colorado and Wyoming. The VA previously announced plans to fire three executives at the Phoenix VA. “These were the first in what I expect will <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> series of announcements of personnel actions,” said Gibson.|$|E
5|$|The first {{operations}} in 1940 concerned Operation Sea Lion, the planned invasion of Britain by the Wehrmacht. The unit was to receive 30 PR Supermarine Spitfire aircraft, specialised and adapted for reconnaissance use. They would {{be capable of}} 1,750 miles round trips. However, just 13 aircraft were available to the unit, and their range limited to 1,300 miles. Eventually, an assortment of Vickers Wellington and Spitfire flights were established. In August 1940, the first PR Spitfires arrived, but teething problems ensured that it would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time before standardisation was achieved with equipment. In August, Coastal Command flew 193 sorties over the suspected invasion ports in the Netherlands, Belgium and France.|$|E

5|$|After the battle, Spee {{took his}} ships north to Valparaiso. Since Chile was neutral, only three ships could enter the port at a time; Spee took Scharnhorst, Gneisenau, and Nürnberg in {{first on the}} morning of 3 November, leaving Dresden and Leipzig with the colliers at Mas a Fuera. There, Spee's ships could take on coal while he conferred with the Admiralty Staff in Germany to {{determine}} the strength of remaining British forces in the region. The ships remained in the port for only 24 hours, in accordance with the neutrality restrictions, and arrived at Mas a Fuera on 6 November, where they took on more coal from captured British and French steamers. On 10 November, Dresden and Leipzig were detached for a stop in Valparaiso, and five days later, Spee took the rest of the squadron south to St. Quentin Bay in the Gulf of Penas. On 18 November, Dresden and Leipzig met Spee while en route and the squadron reached St. Quentin Bay three days later. There, they took on more coal, since the voyage around Cape Horn would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> one and it was unclear when they would have another opportunity to coal.|$|E
5|$|Depending on the {{organism}} and experimental system, the exogenous RNA may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> strand {{designed to be}} cleaved by dicer, or short RNAs designed to serve as siRNA substrates. In most mammalian cells, shorter RNAs are used because long double-stranded RNA molecules induce the mammalian interferon response, a form of innate immunity that reacts nonspecifically to foreign genetic material. Mouse oocytes and cells from early mouse embryos lack this reaction to exogenous dsRNA {{and are therefore a}} common model system for studying mammalian gene-knockdown effects. Specialized laboratory techniques have also been developed to improve the utility of RNAi in mammalian systems by avoiding the direct introduction of siRNA, for example, by stable transfection with a plasmid encoding the appropriate sequence from which siRNAs can be transcribed, or by more elaborate lentiviral vector systems allowing the inducible activation or deactivation of transcription, known as conditional RNAi.|$|E
5|$|The {{road was}} {{originally}} built with two lanes in each direction, {{but with an}} unusually wide central reservation to accommodate a third lane to be added each way at a later date. The work was a compromise between the Ministry of Transport and Drake, the latter who thought two lanes would not be adequate. Initially, the shoulders were hardened with gravel but not paved, a fact still reflected in the British term hard shoulder. A hedge was planted {{along the length of}} the central reservation to help reduce dazzle from the headlights of oncoming traffic at night. The road was constructed to not <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> length of straight road and with the addition of various bridges and tree planting, in the hope to prevent driver boredom reported on foreign motorways.|$|E
