50|$|There {{are many}} {{considerations}} when deciding which grab bar {{to use and}} how best to install it. Properly securing a grab bar is important so that it doesn't pull out of the wall when pressure is applied to it. Each installation should be properly secured into wall <b>blocking</b> or <b>studs</b> to provide the best support. If no studs are available, specialized mollies can be used to spread out grab forces across a wider area of the wall.|$|R
40|$|Forests {{provide us}} with a renewable, recyclable, biodegradable, durable, aesthetically pleasing, and genetically diverse {{material}} we call wood. Unfortunately, our predominantly urban society often views wood as low tech and not cutting edge in spite of its many green aspects. Moreover, preservative-treated wood products frequently draw negative reactions from consumers. Many people shy away from this environmentally sustainable resource, opting instead for energy-intensive construction materials made from non-renewable resources. Concrete <b>blocks,</b> steel <b>studs,</b> and plastic lumber {{are just some of the}} products found around our homes that lack treated woodâ€™s environmental friendliness and carbon neutrality...|$|R

5000|$|Hammer drills {{almost always}} have a lever or switch that locks off the special [...] "hammer clutch," [...] turning the tool into a {{conventional}} drill for wood or metal work. Hammer drills are more expensive and more bulky than regular drills, but are preferable for applications where the material to be drilled - concrete <b>block</b> or wood <b>studs</b> - is unknown. For example, an electrician would use a hammer drill for attaching items (such as an electrical box) to either wood studs (if used as a conventional power drill) or masonry walls (if used as a hammer drill).|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Vast {{developments}} {{are taking place}} in the field of internal combustion engine especially to improve the fuel economy and to reduce the emission percentage in the exhaust gases so that engine can compete with stringent emission rules of present days. Two strokes engines became outdated due to their inability to compete with these standards. This work is an attempt to bring two strokes engine back in the field of automobile by increasing the fuel economy and reducing the emission levels. In this regard Variation in compression ratio is the technology used to improve the efficiency of the engines. Aim of this research work is to design, fabricate and test a simple two stroke variable compression ratio (VCR) engine with better power delivery, fuel economy and less emissions. With split type cylinder <b>block</b> and <b>stud</b> arrangement the clearance volume of existing fixed compression ratio (FCR) engine is varied thereby varying the compression ratio. Modified engine is having very less knocking tendency, high power output, high mechanical efficiency, higher values of IMEP and BMEP, good cold starting property, low emissions. I...|$|R

The late 6th Earl of Rosebery who died in 1973 was fond of saying nothing had been built in Mentmore in his lifetime. While this was not strictly true, as both he and his father had built stable <b>blocks</b> at the <b>stud</b> farms, one could believe what he said. The only buildings not owned by him were the church and the vicarage. The vicarage, an austere high gabled Victorian building, built in the 1880s, was sold by the Church Commissioners in the 1960s and is now a private house.|$|R
50|$|Located at 52 Victoria Street Melbourne, the Plumbers & Gasfitters Union {{building}} {{is known as}} the most persisting and noticeable landmark of Brutalism. The building was completed in 1970 by Graeme Gunn and his creative collaboration with Merchant Builders and landscape architect Ellis Stones. The design itself was architecturally intended to be up to date. The facade is formed of concrete in bold expressionistic forms with dark smoked glazing that intensify the sculptural quality of the construction. Structurally designed to receive an extra floor when needed, the building consists of a car parking and mechanical services area, one main office floor housing the clients, conference room and lobby, and one office of lettable space. For the internal finishes, walls, concrete <b>block</b> work, and <b>stud</b> frame sheeted with plywood are painted. The addition of signage on the {{building is}} slightly unsympathetic to the building's initial character.|$|R
50|$|T-Stoff: High test {{peroxide}} equipment {{consists of}} a pipe which runs along the starboard beam of the lifting frame from the trunnion end to the halfway point. The pipe is fitted at the upper end to the triple valve assembly, consisting of two flow valves and a three-way valve. The triple valve assembly connects to two tanks, a large measuring tank and a smaller overflow tank. The measuring tank can be filled to the rocket's required amount of T-stoff, after which any excess flows down a stand pipe to the overflow tank. The measuring tank is fitted with a ventilation stud, which vents displaced air as the tank is filled. The ventilation stud includes a ball cock fixed to a frustum stopper, which <b>blocks</b> the vent <b>stud</b> in case of accidental overfilling so that T-Stoff does not spray from the air vent. Both T-Stoff tanks are fitted with an inspection window.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{considers}} a developed computational model {{to study a}} stress-strain state of the assembly unit components of a medium-speed diesel engine of new generation, type CH 26. 5 / 31, which comprises a cylinder head, a sleeve, a gasket, a <b>block,</b> two mounting <b>studs</b> and four power studs. The developed three-dimensional finite element model {{presented in this article}} allows us to take into consideration all the components that make up a gas joint, regardless of their geometric complexity. Its use enables us to estimate the cylinder head - gasket - sleeve tightness of sealing when applying the mounting, temperature, and gas loads, to define the stress and strain components of parts, as well as to study the gasket condition, including pressure distribution across its surface. Based on the results obtained in the study the finite element model of the cylinder head was modified considering a more detailed description of its geometry, thus reducing the principal tensile stresses. </p...|$|R

As {{part of an}} {{investigation}} to reduce seismic damage to partition walls and other finishes in light-frame residential buildings, twenty full-scale gypsum-sheathed walls, built with wood and cold-formed steel framing members, were tested. The experiments investigated the effects of enhanced, inexpensive construction procedures with the objective to increase the racking strength and stiffness of partition-type shear walls, lessening seismic deformations. The stiffness, strength, and damage progression of the specimens with varying wall length, openings, orthogonal wall returns, tie-down and anchoring configurations, and interior and exterior sheathings are reported in this thesis. Iterative tests of specific interior wall geometries determined the optimal construction techniques required to reduce deformations and improve life-cycle performance. The main improvement to these specimens over typical construction {{was the use of}} construction adhesive and mechanical fasteners to attach the sheathing to the framing. Additional enhancements included mid-height <b>blocking,</b> improved corner <b>stud</b> assemblies, properly sized tie downs at the ends of wall segments, and bent straps on the exterior of planar wood-framed walls. The stiffness, strength, and residual capacity of specimens with orthogonal walls increased as compared to specimens with in-plane-only shear walls. Civil Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|Summary. Secretion of the pregnancy-blocking {{pheromone}} was {{stimulated by}} injection of depo-testosterone cypionate into {{females and males}} of inbred strains of mice which do not normally secrete the pheromone. Testosterone treatment of SJL males altered pheromone secretion so that pregnancies were <b>blocked</b> when the <b>stud</b> male was of the same inbred strain; an event that does not normally occur. Injection of epiandrosterone, androstenedione, androsterone or testosterone significantly increased pheromone secretion in SJL females, but progesterone and dehydroepiandrosterone were ineffective. Kidney weights were significantly increased by administration of androgen metabolites {{and the possibility of}} the kidney being the site of pheromone synthesis is discussed. The preputial gland can be excluded as the site of pheromone synthesis since males which are hemizygous for the Tabby-J gene and have no preputial glands blocked pregnancies as effectively as their normal littermates. Preliminary results are also presented concerning the isolation of the pregnancy-blocking pheromone from urine. Urine was analysed by gas chromatography and a peak was observed whose concentration could be correlated with secretion of the pheromone, although the compound(s) has not been identified or tested for biological activity...|$|R
50|$|The {{ground floor}} {{consists}} of a car park and space to house mechanical services, and {{the first and second}} floors are office spaces including conference rooms and a lobby. The building has been structurally designed so that if or when required, an extra floor can be added. Current access to the upper floors is via stairs, however a lift-well has been constructed in case of the planned extension is eventually built.The design emphases the raw structure and materiality of the building, which is composed mostly of off-form concrete, with the material left exposed on the outer surfaces of the building and in some interiors spaces also. For the internal finishes, walls, concrete <b>block</b> work, and <b>stud</b> frame sheeted with plywood are painted. A rough-sawn timber stairwell relieves the strictness of the concrete and glass uniformity. The facade is formed of concrete in bold expressionistic forms with dark smoked glazing that intensify the sculptural quality of the construction. The windows on the east facade are deeply recessed to reduce sun exposure and are glazed with tinted glass. The west facade windows provide natural ventilation to the office areas whereas the rest of the building requires mechanical ventilation.|$|R
2500|$|Following World War II, {{plastics}} {{became available}} in Denmark, and Lego purchased a plastic {{injection molding machine}} in 1947. One of the first modular toys to be produced was a truck that could be taken apart and re-assembled. In 1947, Ole Kirk and Godtfred obtained samples of interlocking plastic bricks produced by the company Kiddicraft. These [...] "Kiddicraft Self-Locking Building Bricks" [...] were designed by Hilary Page. In 1939, Page had applied for a patent on hollow plastic cubes with four studs on top (British Patent NÂº.529,580) that allowed their positioning atop one another without lateral movement. In 1944, Page applied an [...] "Improvement to Toy Building Blocks" [...] as an addition to the previous patent, in which he describes a building system based on rectangular hollow <b>blocks</b> with 2X4 <b>studs</b> on top enabling the construction of walls with staggered rows and window openings. The addition was granted in 1947 as British Patent NÂº 587,206. In 1949, the Lego Group began producing similar bricks, calling them [...] "Automatic Binding Bricks." [...] Lego bricks, then manufactured from cellulose acetate, were developed {{in the spirit of}} traditional wooden blocks that could be stacked upon one another but could be [...] "locked" [...] together.

This prospective, randomized, double-blinded, pilot study is therefore intended to compare lidocaine to ropivacaine in bilateral continuous paravertebral blocks using a multimodal approach for postoperative pain management following laparoscopic bowel surgery. Methods: Thirty-five ASA Iâ€“III consecutive patients undergoing elective laparoscopic bowel surgery and bilateral thoracic paravertebral continuous blocks were analyzed: bilateral thoracic paravertebral infusions of ropivacaine 0. 2 % (Group Ropi, n= 18) or lidocaine 0. 25 % (Group Lido, n= 17) were started at 7 mL/h in the postanesthesia care unit. For each patient, we collected numerical rating scores (NRS) for pain at rest and during movement at baseline, at postanesthesia care unit discharge, at 24 hours and 48 {{hours after the}} end of surgery, as well as hydromorphone patient-controlled analgesia requirements, local anesthetic consumption, side effects, postoperative complications, and functional outcomes. Results: No effect of group distribution on NRS scores for pain at rest or at movement (P= 0. 823 and P= 0. 146), nor on hydromorphone (P= 0. 635) or local anesthetic consumption (P= 0. 063) was demonstrated at any analyzed time point. Hospital length of stay and spontaneous ambulation were comparable between groups (P= 0. 636 and P= 0. 148). In the context of a multimodal approach, the two drugs showed comparable safety profiles. Discussion: Lidocaine 0. 25 % and ropivacaine 0. 2 % provided similar analgesic profiles after elective abdominal surgeries, without any difference in terms of functional outcomes. The easier titratability of lidocaine together with its lower cost induced our clinical practice to definitely switch from ropivacaine to lidocaine for postoperative bilateral paravertebral continuous infusions.
