Conservation practitioners recognize that long-term solutions should include altering human behaviors, and public education and enforcement of wildlife-related laws are two management actions frequently implemented, but with little empirical evidence evaluating their success. We used a system where human-black bear conflicts were common, to experimentally test the efficacy of education and enforcement in altering human behavior to better secure attractants (garbage) from bears. We conducted 3 experiments in Aspen CO, USA to evaluate: 1) on-site education in communal dwellings and construction sites, 2) Bear Aware educational campaign in residential neighborhoods, and 3) elevated law enforcement at two levels in the core business area of Aspen.

40|$|Background: The aim of {{this work}} {{was to assess the}} load on the {{musculoskeletal}} system and its effects in the collectors of solid refuse. The rationale behind this study was to formulate proposals how to reduce excessive musculoskeletal load in this group of workers. Material and Methods: The study group comprised 15 refuse collectors aged 25 to 50 years. Data about the workplace characteristics and subjective complaints of workers were collected by the free interview and questionnaire. During the survey the photorecording of the workpostures, the distance and velocity by GPS recorders, measurements of forces necessary to move containers, energy expenditure (lung ventilation method), workload estimation using the Firstbeat system and REBA method and stadiometry were done. Results: The distance walked daily by the collectors operating in terms of 2 to 3 in urban areas was about 15 km, and in rural areas about 18 km. The most frequent musculoskeletal complaints concerned the feet (60 % subjects), knees, wrists and shoulders (over 40 % subjects). After work-shift all examined workers had vertebral column shorter by 10 to 14 mm (11. 4 mm mean). Conclusions: The results of our study show that the refuse collectors are subjected to a very high physical load because of the work organization and the way it is performed. To avoid adverse health effects and overload it is necessary to undertake ergonomic interventions, involving training of workers to improve the way of their job performance, active and passive leisure, technical control of the equipment and <b>refuse</b> <b>containers,</b> as well as the renegotiation of contracts with clients, especially those concerning non-standard containers.

40|$|A waste {{container}} vehicle for waste glass, building rubble and houshold <b>refuse</b> <b>containers</b> etc. was developed under the research project. The noise emitted by this vehicle amounting to a {{sound intensity level}} of 99 dB (A) during operation (raising and depositing operations) is roughly 10 dB (A) lower than comparable conventional vehicles. This substantial reduction in noise required the following complementary measures: Use of a chassis which fulfils the criteria under paragraph 49 of the regulations authorising the use of vehicles for road traffic (StVZO) for low-noise trucks. Reduction in the operating speed of the engine while retaining the working speed and performance (depositing and raising operations). Provision of additional engine and gearbox surrounds. Use of low-noise-units - (ancillary drive, hydraulic pump, control valve) - and reduction in the operating speeds. Reduction in the noise transmission of the hydraulic system to the vehicle and superstructure through solid-borne sound insulation. Optimisation of the hock control to reduce the impact noises of the containers (control of the lifting speed). Special measures on vehicle and containers to prevent screeching noises (roller guidance with ball bearings and central lubrication). Special measures on containers (building rubble, household refuse and waste glass containers) to reduce the noise emission (sandwich design, rubber inlays, sound-absorbing mats). The noise emitted while the containers are being deposited and raised has been reduced so much with these measures that 100 of these vehicles {{would have to be}} operated simultaneously in order to generate the same sound level as one conventional vehicle. A characteristic feature of the overall concept is that only units and components readily available on the market were used and it is possible to transfer the measures implemented to other container vehicle designs. The noise reduction measures do not limit the operation reliability, possible applications and performance compared with conventional vehiclesSIGLEAvailable from TIB Hannover: RN 8908 (93 - 024) / FIZ - Fachinformationszzentrum Karlsruhe / TIB - Technische InformationsbibliothekBundesministerium fuer Umwelt, Naturschutz und Reaktorsicherheit, Bonn (Germany) DEGerman...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:Background Rodent {{infestation}} is {{a public}} health challenge globally. Cities in high and low income countries have been ravaged by rodent infestation. The lack of basic services has exposed communities to health risks and rodent-borne diseases. Objective The study aimed at determining the rodent infestation in the five study sites within the City of Johannesburg namely: Bertrams; Braamfischerville; Hillbrow; Hospital Hill; and Riverlea with special focus on 2009 to 2010, seeing that previous articles have dealt with infestation of rodents from 2006 to 2008. Methods Secondary data extracted from Head, Environment, and Development (HEAD) study project was used to analyse and interpret the trend of rodent infestation {{over a period of}} five years. Sampling comprised of households from the afore-mentioned study sites. Data was collected by means of a structured questionnaire from members of households above the age of 18 years residing in the study sites. Data was analysed using STATA software version 13. Results The study indicated significant differences in rodent prevalence across the study sites. For instance, residents living in Hillbrow (high rise buildings) reported the lowest (17. 4 %) prevalence from 2009 to 2010 study period, while those living in Hospital Hill (informal settlement) reported the highest (79. 7 %) prevalence compared with other study sites during the same study period. However, overall there is a significant decrease in rodent infestation across the study sites except in Bertrams where an increase of 7. 8 % was reported. Conclusion Informal settlements are more exposed to rodent’s infestation than formal settlements due to lack of proper basic sanitation services e. g. waste management. Municipal departments such as Solid Waste and Public Works should work together with communities towards a sustainable resolution of rodent problem. Socio-economic and environmental variables such as type of dwelling, toilet facilities, absence of <b>refuse</b> <b>containers</b> and rodents’ access to water sources were noted as contributing factors of rodents infestation...|$|R

40|$|Welcome {{to a new}} column {{committed}} to going and growing green. Together with a little effort, {{we will be able}} to utilize the Chester County Times to present ideas, options, as a springboard each other to make a “greener world” To begin I do not claim to be a “green” expert, and I openly welcome feedback as this is a learning process for me as well as a source for information sharing. My background is medical I am a Registered Nurse at Thomas Jefferson U. Hospital. This column actually was developed in part due to my frustration in obtaining information to make my home, office, and leisure activities as green as possible. Recently I took in the movie “The 11 th Hour” a movie about global warming hosted by Leonardo DiCaprio, the most important piece of information I took away from this movie was that each and every consumer has a vote. A vote is cast by the purchasing power of our individual consumer spending. Whether we choose to purchase greener electricity form our electricity supplier or paper plates vs. styrofoam plates for a picnic, or choices made by office supply purchaser. We can all make a difference little by little to hopefully equal a difference that matters. The first area that everyone can make a difference is to recycle. At home newspaper and post consumer packaging(cereal boxes, envelopes, magazines) should all be bundle in a used paper bag from the supermarket, or tied with string or placed in a plastic recyclable bucket(to be used again and again). Metals cans also make up a large portion of recycling whether aluminum or tin (soda, beer, fruit, and vegetable), old paint cans left open to dry can also be recycled. And finally plastics, according to the thickness of the plastic (all plastic are coded by number of thickness in a triangle located on the package). Each township is different as to the thickness of plastic that it collects. Please refer to your local municipality if there are any questions regarding recycling programs. At work many employers have separate <b>refuse</b> <b>containers.</b> Cans, bottles, paper, and garbage are sorted into different collection bins in most cafeteria setting dining areas. I have heard of worm farms to help dispose of garbage waste at work. Instead of discarding your food scraps, you can recycle them with the help of worms. Vermicomposting (worm composting) turns many types of kitchen waste into a nutritious soil for plants. When worm compost is added to soil, it boosts the nutrients available to plants and enhances soil structure and drainage. Using worms to decompose food waste offers several advantages: It reduces household garbage disposal costs; •	It produces less odor and attracts fewer pests than putting food wastes into a garbage container; •	It saves the water and electricity that kitchen sink garbage disposal units consume; •	It produces a free, high-quality soil amendment (compost); •	It requires little space, labor, or maintenance; •	It spawns free worms for fishing. In the work station confidential paperwork can be shredded in the office or collected in a secure container then taken to be shredded and recycled. Everyday paperwork that is no longer needed or is outdated should be collected and recycled, folders and office supplies reused whenever possible. The following phrase was learned many years ago to help with recycling program: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle it 2 ̆ 7 s a matter of waste minimization the idea is that the first priority is to reduce your use or consumption of something second priority; it you can 2 ̆ 7 t reduce your use of something, then reuse it if you can, and third, if you can 2 ̆ 7 t reuse something, then at least recycle it if you can a good example of this would be water bottles REDUCE your use of water bottles by filling a reusable container from the tap or from your Brita pitcher at home if you do use a water bottle, you can REUSE it a few times (within recommendations for cleanliness) after you have reused it, RECYCLE it. (In some areas where plastics are not picked up at the curbside with other recyclables, look for community groups or churches that may have a periodic drop-off time for other recyclable items...|$|R
40|$|The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) {{requests}} assistance in preventing deaths and injuries among workers who load, operate, or work near refuse compacting or baling equipment. Recent NIOSH investigations suggest that worker injuries and deaths could be prevented by using safe work procedures, appropriate safety devices, and hazardous energy control {{programs designed to}} address the hazards of operating, maintaining, and servicing compacting and baling equipment. This Alert describes five cases of fatal injuries that resulted when workers entered, fell, or were caught and pulled into energized compacting or baling equipment. All managers, supervisors, and workers in companies that use compacting or baling equipment should follow the recommendations in this Alert. NIOSH requests that equipment manufacturers, safety and health officials, industry associations, unions, and editors of trade journals bring the recommendations in this Alert {{to the attention of}} all employers and workers who use compacting and baling equipment. Compacting and baling equipment reduces large amounts of solid waste to smaller, more manageable units by means of powered rams. These machines may be used by manufacturing companies to compact and bale large amounts of scrap and waste materials such as paper, cotton, and metals, and by retail and service industries to compress paper and cardboard boxes. Compactors compress the <b>refuse</b> material into <b>containers</b> for transport. Baling equipment is designed to compress material and produce a bale (bound or unbound) that can be handled and transported as a material unit. Compacting and baling equipment are available in many sizes and configurations. These machines may have one or more rams for compressing materials or extruding bales. The rams may move vertically or horizontally. Some types of equipment allow direct access to the compression chamber. Others have a hopper or chute through which material feeds into the machine. In businesses where refuse processing is incidental to the primary operation (such as in retail and service industries), loading and compressing may be done as separate work activities-that is, material may be intermittently loaded until the chamber is full and then compressed. Alternatively, in businesses where compressing scrap and waste materials is the primary operation or where large volumes of refuse materials are processed daily, loading and compressing is a continuous operation. Machines may operate in a manual, semiautomatic, or automatic mode. In the manual mode, a switch operated by a worker controls ram motion. In the semiautomatic mode, an operator initiates the compression, after which the machine automatically completes the cycle. In the automatic mode, a sensor inside the compression chamber signals when the chamber is full and activates the compression cycle. Because of the widespread use of compactors and balers across varied industries, it is difficult to obtain exact numbers of workers who are exposed to the hazards of this equipment. The workers most likely to be exposed to risk from compacting and baling equipment are those in the wholesale trade and transportation/public utilities industries engaged in recycling and the collection and disposal of refuse. Employees working in manufacturing settings and in retail and service trades may also be at risk because of the large volume of waste generated and processed daily.
