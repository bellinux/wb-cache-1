5000|$|The Church of the Messiah was {{organized}} on October 27, 1846 {{at the suggestion}} of Rev. John Gordon Maxwell, a former rector of Emmanuel Church, Holmesburg. Rev. Maxwell had observed the lack of an Episcopal presence in the Richmond District of Philadelphia County. The parish was incorporated in 1847 and admitted to the convention of the Diocese of Pennsylvania on May 20, 1847. While awaiting the completion of its first house of worship, the congregation worshipped in a carpenter’s shop owned by J. C. Richardson located at the northwest corner of York and Salmon Streets. The cornerstone of the congregation’s building was laid June 28, 1847 at East Huntingdon and Thompson Streets. The property was donated by Dr. Benjamin S. and Mrs. Lynda O. Janney on April 14, 1847. The building, designed by architect John Notman, was consecrated on Easter Monday in 1848. The following day, the Gothic Revival style building was described in the Episcopal Recorder as an [...] "early English order of Gothic architecture, which prevailed at the commencement of the 13th century; a style which well unites the elegant simplicity with economy… The church itself seats 605 persons, and can be made to accommodate more with ease; it is 60 feet high to the cap of the belfry, and the interior is 90 feet long along the chancel and nave and 64 feet along the transepts." [...] The article identifies John Notman as the architect and Hiram Miller as the builder, and Notman’s brother-in-law, John Gibson, is identified as the stained glass artisan. The building was erected at a total cost of $6,200 or $5,800 (not including the <b>bell,</b> <b>furnace,</b> and furnishings).|$|E
40|$|Recrystallisation annealing, a {{repeated}} heat treatment between {{different stages of}} cold rolling of martensitic chromium steel strip, is successful when neither high rolling forces nor wear of the working rolls occur during the subsequent cold rolling. Mechanical properties as tensile strength, yield, elongation or hardness have been, by tradition, the criteria that described {{the quality of the}} annealing process. In recent years, the development of the measurement equipment in the rolling mills and of the instruments for material investigations has accentuated more and more the role played by the microstructural properties in the evaluation of the heat treatment. Two microstructural characteristics of the degree of annealing are, firstly and most important, the recrystallisation degree, and, secondly, the secondary carbide density. The sample manufacturing and heat treatment, modelling and microstructure investigations by light optical- (LOM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) described in this article were carried out at Sandvik Materials Technology’s R&D Department and <b>Bell</b> <b>Furnace</b> Line in Sandviken, Sweden, while microstructure investigations and evaluation by scanning electron microscopy with field emission gun (FEG-SEM) and electron back scatter diffraction (EBSD) were done at the Corrosion and Metals Research Institute (KIMAB) in Stockholm, Sweden. The first part of this work shows that, in contrast to the traditional methods LOM and SEM, that use chemical etching for the preparation of the samples, EBSD can successfully characterise recrystallised structures in annealed martensitic chromium steels. Unlike conventional microscopy with LOM and SEM, EBSD is able to reveal the grain geometry, as well as to separate and identify the different phases in this kind of steels (ferrite, M 23 -, M 6 -carbides). Important parameters such as grain size, particle size and recrystallised fraction can be measured with high accuracy. This information can be used to understand, evaluate, control and even predict the recrystallisation annealing of martensitic chromium steel. The second part of this work presents how the results from microstructure description by EBSD can be directly used in relatively simple empirical models for determination of recrystallisation degree as function of the annealing parameters and the deformation history. EBSD was applied to evaluate the degree of recrystallisation in a series of annealing tests, with the purpose to model recrystallisation temperature in two types of martensitic chromium steel strip, a traditional one and one alloyed with molybdenum, cold rolled with different amounts of reduction and annealed with different temperatures, soaking times and heating rates. The empirical quadratic models were built with Umetrics’ software for experimental design, MODDEÒ 8. 0 and they defined the recrystallisation degree (limits for LAGB and HAGB were set to 1. 5 ° and 7. 5 ° for the first grade and 2. 5 ° and 10 ° for second one) and the secondary carbides density as functions of annealing temperature, soaking time and cold reduction (the factor heating rate was removed as nonsignificant). To be observed that these empirical models were fit much better for the recrystallisation degree than for the secondary carbides density. The modelling work described above, together with the implementation of online physical temperature models in the bell annealers may lead to an increased productivity in the production plant by shortening the annealing cycle and minimising scrap and thus to an economical gain of ca 1, 5 MSEK per year at Sandvik Materials Technology. ...|$|E

5000|$|In September 2011 the Whitechapel Bell Foundry, a {{few miles}} from the Olympic Stadium, was {{commissioned}} to make the bell. [...] The Foundry completed its design, profile, lettering and tuning. However, it was no longer able to cast such a large <b>bell</b> (its <b>furnace</b> capacity is 8 tonnes, as the large Victorian era bells had gone out of fashion), and so subcontracted casting to Royal Eijsbouts of the Netherlands. There was some controversy over using a non-British firm, as Taylor’s Bell Foundry in Loughborough had also tendered to cast the bell. The hammer mechanism and hanging framework were made by other firms and twenty companies in three countries were eventually involved with its production. The bell was installed and tested in the stadium at midnight on 1 June 2012. It was designed to be as large as possible but needed to fit through the athletes’ tunnel; when it arrived there were only a few inches to spare.|$|R
50|$|In October, 1893, {{while some}} workmen were {{carrying}} out some excavations {{for the restoration}} of the tower, under the supervision of Mr. Carter, the Architect, and Mr. C. Cooksley, the Contractor, they came across a most singular discovery, {{which turned out to be}} the mold for casting <b>bells,</b> also the <b>furnace</b> and other arrangements for casting. The pit, after use, had been simply filled in, and paved over, and the matter lost sight of. This plainly shows that the present peal of Bells were cast in the discovered foundry. It seems extraordinary that the belfry of a church should be used as a foundry, an incident rarely known in Wales. Some of the bells required re-casting and tuning. The work was done by Messrs. Carr, of Smethwick, who very arranged room for two more bells to be erected.|$|R
40|$|Bells used in Christian {{churches are}} {{documentary}} sources {{due to the}} inscriptions, decorations and coats of arms available on them. Depending on the language in which the inscriptions were made, old bells had diﬀerent names. The bells used to be donated to the churches by private persons, by {{the right of the}} founder, or by communities; the oldest bells of the medieval Moldavian state date back to the reign of Stephen the Great. The alloy used for bell casting contained copper, brass and a minor amount of silver or other elements. Bellfounders were itinerant, traveling from church to church to cast <b>bells,</b> the <b>furnaces</b> were built on sites, and the casting of large bells was carried out only during the warmer months. The most lasting operation was building the furnace and constructing the mold, and the most dangerous process was pouring the melt metal in a mold. This was followed by controlled cooling the bell, removing the mold material after the metal has solidiﬁ ed, and ﬁnishing the bell. Casting bells was always associated with a number of beliefs and practices meant to contribute {{to the success of the}} operation and the obtaining of a beautiful sound of the bell. Data about the practitioners of this craft are rather scanty; their few names can be found in archival documents and inscriptions on the bells only to the middle of the 18 th century. Some bells were cast in Transylvania, in Sighişoara and Braşov. Whether members of the clergy or the laity, the bellfounders had great technical knowledge and skills handed down from father to son. Unfortunately, only a few churches and monasteries preserved the original bells; many were lost in course of time, sometimes in ﬁres, and in most cases because of requisitions for military needs, when they were melted down to make cannons...|$|R
