We {{are supposed to be}} on a high scaffolding level with the frieze, and the effect of great height produced by glimpses of light between the planking of the floor is very cleverly managed. But there is a want of individuality among the connoisseurs clustered round Phidias, and the frieze itself is very inaccurately coloured. The Greek boys who are riding and leading the horses are painted Egyptian red, and the whole design is done in this red, dark blue, and black. This sombre colouring is un-Greek; the figures of these boys were undoubtedly tinted with flesh colour, like the ordinary Greek statues, and the whole tone of the colouring of the original frieze was brilliant and light; while one of its chief beauties, the reins and accoutrements of <b>burnished</b> <b>metal,</b> is quite omitted.

60|$|Ah, that {{return to}} the forest where Rima dwelt, after so anxious day, when the declining sun shone hotly still, and the green {{woodland}} shadows were so grateful! The coolness, the sense of security, allayed the fever and excitement I had suffered on the open savannah; I walked leisurely, pausing often to listen to some bird voice or to admire some rare insect or parasitic flower shining star-like in the shade. There was a strangely delightful sensation in me. I likened myself to a child that, startled at something it had seen while out playing in the sun, flies to its mother to feel her caressing hand on its cheek and forget its tremors. And describing what I felt in that way, I was a little ashamed and laughed at myself; nevertheless the feeling was very sweet. At that moment Mother and Nature seemed {{one and the same}} thing. As I kept to the more open part of the wood, on its southernmost border, the red flame of the sinking sun was seen at intervals through the deep humid green of the higher foliage. How every object it touched took from it a new wonderful glory! At one spot, high up where the foliage was scanty, and slender bush ropes and moss depended like broken cordage from a dead limb--just there, bathing itself in that glory-giving light, I noticed a fluttering bird, and stood still to watch its antics. Now it would cling, head downwards, to the slender twigs, wings and tail open; then, righting itself, it would flit from waving line to line, dropping lower and lower; and anon soar upwards a distance of twenty feet and alight to recommence the flitting and swaying and dropping towards the earth. It was one of those birds that have a polished plumage, and as it moved this way and that, flirting its feathers, they caught the beams and shone at moments like glass or <b>burnished</b> <b>metal.</b> Suddenly another bird of the same kind dropped down to it as if from the sky, straight and swift as a falling stone; and the first bird sprang up to meet the comer, and after rapidly wheeling round each other for a moment, they fled away in company, screaming shrilly through the wood, and were instantly lost to sight, while their jubilant cries came back fainter and fainter at each repetition.|$|E

Materials have been prepared by mixing metal powders with the reinforcement, cold pressing, sintering, hot extrusion and heat treatment. We have determined surface roughness with a Hommel tester; the arithmetical mean for A 1 Mg 1 SiCu (A 6061  + Al 2 O 3) was ~ 1  µm before burnishing and ~ 0. 15  mm after burnishing. We have also determined the bearing capacity at 50  % with the same tester: before burnishing 2. 30  µm and 0. 47  µm afterwards for A 6061  + Al 2 O 3; before 2. 30  µm, afterwards 0. 37  µm for A 390  + SiC.

50|$|B. Turquoise InlayingFirst of all, the {{turquoise}} inlayer buys waste turquoise chips from turquoise forming workshops or turquoise mines in Mashhad, Neishabour or Damghan. Since such turquoise chips are usually accompanied by some earth and ordinary stone chips, they are first separated and cleaned. Then, {{the turquoise}} chips are graded {{based on their}} sizes so the right size turquoise chips are used in making each Turquoise Inlaying object {{in proportion to the}} surface area. In the next step, the object is heated (to about 30 °C) and, while heating, a “walnut lac” is sprinkled onto the parts that have to be turquoise laid so that the lac powder is almost melted and covers the intended surface. While the lac is still soft and sticky on the object surface, some of the turquoise chips that were prepared before based on their size are place on the work surface. The chips must be placed in a way so that no space is left between them as far as possible. In order to fill the possible gaps between turquoise chips, temperature is added (to about 40 °C) and some more lac powder is sprinkled onto the chips until the lac layer is softened to a melting form, and then try to fill all the spaces by adding smaller turquoise chips, or, as they say, the chips sit well on the surface. This is usually done by pressing the turquoise chips by hand onto the surface so that they stick fast to it. After the object is cooled, the lac covered parts become rigid. After that stage, the parts covered by lac and turquoise chips are polished with emery so the extra lac and little raised parts of the chips are flattened. That is the stage where the color of the turquoise chips becomes visible as turquoise and that of lac as black (or dark brown) in the spaces between the chips. After this stage is completed, if there is still some fallouts {{in some parts of the}} work, the object is heated again, and the empty parts are restored with small turquoise chips and lac. Then, the surface is polished and honed again. The restoration is sometimes done with a type of turquoise colored putty that is prepared with “mol” mud, oil and lapis paint. The final stage of Turquoise Inlaying is burnishing which is done in two stages itself. The first stage consists of <b>burnishing</b> the <b>metal</b> parts which is done at a goldsmith or machining workshop where the opaque layer that is formed on the metal parts during Turquoise Inlaying is removed with hand tools or a machine blade, and then, those parts are polished so the metal becomes shiny. The second stage consists of burnishing the turquoise inlaid product. After polishing the metal parts of the object, the work is returned to the turquoise inlayer’s workshop where the turquoise inlaid surface is polished with olive or sesame oil so that part becomes shiny, too. A Turquois Inlaying craftsman employs different tools and devices for different stages of the job mostly including dies, hammers, drills, natural gas and gasoline torches, pincers, pliers, forceps, different metal pipes tweezers, files and emeries. The most important point in Turquoise Inlaying is correct installation of turquoise chips on the metal so that it is strong enough and the chips do not come off while burnishing the work. The other important point is that a piece of turquoise inlaid work will be of more artistic value if the turquoise chips are installed more regularly in close contact, i.e. without a space in between.|$|R

Oilblotter, trade name of the Anderson Cob Mills' new anti-pollution product, is an absorbent of vegetable origin for removing oil from water and other surfaces quickly and efficiently. According to David I. B. Vander Hooven, Executive Vice-President of the mills, Oilblotter has been undergoing research and develop­ment since early 1969 and has been successfully demon­strated for federal, state and marine industry officials in both fresh and salt water and under both hot and cold temperature conditions in Canada, Texas and Florida. Mr. Vander Hooven flew to Kentucky to personally oversee the demonstration of the product which is used after a slick is contained by means of a floating boom. O ilblotter, which is non-toxic and subject to normal organic decomposition, absorbs oil immediately upon contact and is then skimmed off for burning or other means of disposal. Affiliated with The Andersons of Maumee, the Ander­son Cob Mills, Inc., are primary producers of a versatile, tough-textured natural cellulose grit derived from corn cobs, which is used in a number of manu­facturing processes including de-burring, <b>burnishing</b> and finishing <b>metal</b> parts, blast cleaning, and as carriers of agricultural chemicals. Grit-O-Cobs and Lite-R-Cobs, registered trade names, are also used by foundries, fur cleaners and cosmetic manufacturers. DWARF APPLE TREES Techniques for dwarfing apple trees have produced modern orchards that cost no more to get into pro­duction than standard trees, but give growers more apples per tree. Michigan State University horticulturists are testing and improving these techniques. FAT RATS STUDIED Sterility is a common condition in overweight animals and human beings. To find out why this is true, Michigan State University foods and nutrition research­ers are. conducting basic studies of fat rats to determine why obesity affects reproduction and sex hormones. CHEMICAL MAY HELP CHERRY HARVEST A Michigan State University horticulturist has found a chemiool that coutd make mechanical harvesting practical for sweet cherries. By applying the experiment­al chemical, 2 -chloroethylthosphonic acid, as a foliar spray 7 to 10 days before harvest, the force needed to remove the fruit is cut in half. Thus, the chemical might make it possible to mechanically harvest sweet cherries with very little damage to the fruit. Annual Sugar Beet Field Tour Held Recently In Oh io Areas The Farmers' and Manufacturers' Beet Sugar Associ· ation of Saginaw, Michigan, held its annual sugar beet field tour i. n the Fremont and Findlay, Ohio areas recently, reports Glenn E. Maddy, county extension agent. They visited the sugar beet fields of Melvin Schulte, Woodville; Carl and Theodore Kaiser of Graytown; Wilson Damschroder, Lindsey; Rollin Turnow, Curtice; Harold Draeger, Lindsey; Emil Webert, Elmore, and toured the new additions to the Fremont factory of the Northern Ohio Sugar Company. The main items observed were the planting of beets to a stand-that is, the farmer planted beets at the rate of four seeds per foot with no blocking done. The weed control material was Pyramin+ TCA. Then in many of the cases, they had labor removing the weeds with long· handled hoes. This is a very common practice in Michigan, the planting of beets to stand without using labor. The Kaiser Brothers used a John Deere electronic thinner to remove their excess beets. The beets were planted at two inches apart, and then were reduced to approximately one foot apart. This thinning mach­ine can do two acres per hour. The machine covers six rows at a time.

[...] David Grad of Entertainment Weekly praises Vince Neil's voice, which lost [...] "none of its hormonal urgency" [...] and describes the music as a fine display [...] "of highly <b>burnished</b> <b>metal</b> trumpeting the pleasures of drugs and nasty sex." [...] Martin Popoff calls it [...] "the summer record of '97." ...|$|E
50|$|The Landmark was {{purchased}} through Hughes Tool Company. The sale was officially completed in June 1969. Hughes covered {{the cost of}} Caroll's debts with the project's contractors. The Landmark was the only casino that Hughes had purchased before it was opened. As a result, Hughes was heavily involved in details regarding the project. Hughes spent approximately $3 million to give the interior a lavish design and to add other touches to the resort. Hughes added an Incan and Space Age theme to the resort's interior, which included glowing, red-colored Incan masks, and a wall sculpture made of <b>burnished</b> <b>metal</b> that represented a launch from Cape Kennedy. The interior also included 65 tons of black-and-white polished marble. The interior was designed by Las Vegas resident Leonard England, and also included $200,000 light fixtures. For the hotel, Hughes replaced 72-inch beds with 80-inch beds, and had color televisions built into the walls of each room. Hughes also had an island built {{in the middle of}} the hotel's 240-foot rooftop swimming pool, which cost $200,000 and was the longest in the state. The exterior of the Landmark buildings was left unchanged.|$|E
5000|$|For {{more than}} four hundred years, the Province of Munster has been heraldically symbolised by three golden antique crowns on a deep blue shield. The crowns may {{represent}} Thomond (Tuamhain, North Munster), Desmond (Deasumhain, South Munster), and Ormond (Urumhain, East Munster). While these arms are on record as relating to Munster {{as early as the}} sixteenth century, the motif, namely the antique Irish crown which inspired them, is considerably older. For example, a crown of the type now known as antique Irish, crafted in <b>burnished</b> <b>metal</b> and resting on a blue enamel surface, forms part of a thirteenth-century crozier head found near Cormac’s Chapel on the Rock of Cashel. This Gaelic Irish artifact is now in the National Museum of Ireland, Kildare Street, Dublin. Cashel was the seat of the Kings of Munster, from early Christian times through to the fifteenth century. In the case of the ‘king-bishops’ of Cashel, the placing of the antique crown on their crozier, could be interpreted as a symbolic assertion of their right to the political sovereignty of Munster. It is suggested therefore that the sovereignty of Munster, as expressed in heraldic format, uses the antique crown in triplicate. (Tripling of symbols in heraldic art is a convention used to achieve balance on the triangular surface of a shield.) ...|$|E

(2007) {{suggested}} {{the use of}} ferromagnetic powder and cyanoacrylate fuming methods over aluminium powder to develop fresh and aged (up to six weeks) latent fingermarks on glass recovered from water. Trapecar (2012) {{suggested the}} use of cyanoacrylate fuming over silver special powder and small particle reagent (black and white) to develop fresh and aged (168  h old) latent fingermarks on glass and <b>burnished</b> <b>metal</b> surfaces submerged in stagnant water.|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{study was}} done to {{investigate}} whether certain fingerprint methods can recover latent fingerprints on glass and metal surfaces submerged in water. Donors intentionally placed fingerprints on glass and <b>burnished</b> <b>metal</b> surfaces. The surfaces to be examined {{were exposed to the}} influences of stagnant water during different time intervals. Finger marks were recovered with Silver Special powder, small particle reagent (black and white) and cyanoacrylate. The best results were achieved with cyanoacrylate. Our study has shown that the duration of exposure to stagnant water and the methods selected for enhancement had an influence on the quality of detected finger marks...|$|E
40|$|Numerical {{modeling}} of nanostructuring burnishing {{has been carried}} out to reveal the limiting values of process parameters, which serve both to provide the appropriate surface quality and positive deformation-induced structural modification of the subsurface layers as well as to avoid shear instability in the subsurface layers of <b>burnished</b> <b>metal.</b> The effects of load, burnishing speed, tool pass number and tribological transfer on the burnished surface roughness have been elucidated by the example of quenched and tempered steels 20 X (EN 20 Cr 4). It was shown that overloading results in quasi-viscous flow of the subsurface material, deterioration of the surface and ruining the positive effect of nanostructuring burnishing...|$|E
