40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} the real exchange rate on trade, structural change and growth. We point out a new approach to monetary growth policy in an open economy with trade and foreign direct investment. Moreover, the analysis presents a paradox effect with respect to the link between process innovations and the price level: The latter can rise if there are process innovations provided that the income elasticity of the demand for money is between zero and unity. We also look into the more traditional <b>Balassa-Samuelson</b> <b>effects</b> and consider the major impact of real exchange rate changes on structural change and on economic growth, the latter including a modified neoclassical model with endogenous growth. In addition, we consider aspects of optimum growth. Main policy conclusions are that one should avoid massive overshooting. Poor countries willing to catch up with partner countries in an integration area would be well advised to promote foreign direct investment inflows and to stimulate upgrading of human capital.

40|$|Accounting for the {{pervasive}} evidence of limited international risk sharing {{is an important}} hurdle for open-economy models, especially when these are adopted {{in the analysis of}} policy trade-offs likely to be affected by imperfections in financial markets. Key to the literature is the evidence, at odds with efficiency, that consumption is relatively high in countries where its international relative price (the real exchange rate) is also high. We reconsider the relation between cross-country consumption differentials and real exchange rates, by decomposing it into two components, reflecting the prices of tradable and nontradable goods, respectively. We document that, as a common pattern among OECD countries, both components tend to contribute to the overall lack of risk sharing, with the tradable price component playing the dominant role in accounting for efficiency deviations. We relate these findings to two mechanisms proposed by the literature to reconcile open economy models with the data. One features strong <b>Balassa-Samuelson</b> <b>effects</b> on nontradable prices due to productivity gains in the tradable sector, with a muted offsetting response of tradable prices. The other, endogenous income effects causing nontradable but especially tradable prices to appreciate with a rise in domestic consumption demand. ...|$|R

40|$|After {{accession}} to the European Union, new member countries {{have to decide}} the optimal path {{to the adoption of}} the euro. Some have argued that the euro should be adopted only when a sufficient degree of real convergence has been achieved. The idea is that real exchange rates will be affected by a real appreciation trend, which would imply higher inflation when countries enter the euro zone. This paper shows that <b>Balassa–Samuelson</b> <b>effects</b> are relevant, but such long-term considerations cannot justify maintaining flexibility of exchange rates for a long time. Another set of arguments in favour of delaying adoption of the euro is based on shorter-term considerations, namely the possibility of using nominal exchange rates to achieve a real exchange rate target and maintain competitiveness. However, this policy of real exchange rate targeting is likely to induce higher and more persistent inflation rates. This paper finds that the arguments in favour of flexibility of exchange rate and delay in the adoption of the euro are rather weak, and therefore a fast adoption of the Euro should be considered.

40|$|One {{important}} {{issue for the}} new Member States (NMS) of the EU is {{the choice of the}} exchange rate regime {{that will allow them to}} participate successfully in the EMU process. Two exchange rate arrangements, compatible with the EU Treaty and ERM 2 regulations, deserve special attention: flexible exchange rate regime and currency board with respect to the euro. The first regime (within stipulated bands), coupled with an inflation targeting scheme, agrees with the spirit of the European Commission and absorbs more easily supply shocks and Balassa Samuelson effects (which are present in real convergence and catching up episodes). It also prompts the process of nominal convergence. The second regime is suited to countries that need to foster the credibility of their monetary policy, but makes real adjustments to country-specific shocks and <b>Balassa-Samuelson</b> <b>effects</b> more difficult and/or costly. In this paper we investigate the dynamics of output and inflation under each exchange rate regime in NMS during the post EU accession and Maastricht phases. For that purpose, our model extends Gerlach and Smets (2000) and Detken and Gaspar (2003), icluding market distortions and three possible exchange rate regimes. In the empirical part of the paper we estimate SVAR models, following Bayoumi and Eichengreen (1993) methodology, in order to extract variances and covariances between shocks to each NMS and to the euro zone and compute individual social losses under each exchange rate arrangement. We use monthly data on industrial production and CPI for eight NMS countries. Our main result is that the optimal choice varies depending on the institutional and structural features of each economy, and on the likely source and nature of economic shocks to which it is exposed with respect to the whole euro area. Interestingly, the results for each country seem to conform to the general prescriptions that one would derive from the theory of optimal currency areasEU enlargment, exchange rate systems, SVAR, European monetary integration...|$|R
