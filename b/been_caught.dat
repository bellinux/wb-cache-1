5|$|Extensive {{tests have}} been carried out on fish we put in the river and we are {{satisfied}} that the water will support fish life. Roach and perch have already <b>been</b> <b>caught</b> and we have had no reports of any ill-effects. There is no doubt the pollution is clearing. It will be a long job, but we are sure there is a future for angling in the river.|$|E

5|$|A German {{victory on}} the Battle of Britain Day was unlikely. It {{could only have}} been {{possible}} if Park had made crass errors and had <b>been</b> <b>caught</b> on the ground. Stephen Bungay postulates that had the loss rates been reversed, Dowding could have replaced those with reinforcements from his C units and carried on. Moreover, during both major engagements Fighter Command had used less than ½ of its strength. It {{would have been able to}} meet the Luftwaffe again on the morrow.|$|E

The defense also attempted to attribute Farrar's poisoning to Tim, who did much of the cooking in the household.|$|E
5|$|Also in October 2012, Jamie McIntosh of IJM Canada {{said that}} his {{organization}} supports the NAP-CHT, and that the plan's promises to participate in international child protection would be best fulfilled by apprehending and prosecuting Canadians who engage in child sex tourism and child trafficking in other countries. McIntosh recommended that this work be focused on Cambodia, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, the Philippines, and Thailand because these countries are particularly vulnerable to Canadian traffickers. He also recommended focusing on these countries because Canadians have <b>been</b> <b>caught</b> participating in child sex tourism there; McIntosh made specific reference to the cases of Kenneth Klassen and Donald Bakker.|$|E

5|$|Blue whale hunting {{was banned}} in 1966 by the International Whaling Commission, and illegal whaling by the Soviet Union finally halted in the 1970s, {{by which time}} 330,000 blue whales had <b>been</b> <b>caught</b> in the Antarctic, 33,000 {{in the rest of}} the Southern Hemisphere, 8,200 in the North Pacific, and 7,000 in the North Atlantic.

5|$|Food {{is mostly}} {{selected}} by sight, even in conditions of dim light. Movement of the prey triggers a feeding response. Frogs have <b>been</b> <b>caught</b> on fish hooks baited with red flannel and green frogs (Rana clamitans) {{have been found}} with stomachs full of elm seeds that they had seen floating past. Toads, salamanders and caecilians also use smell to detect prey. This response is mostly secondary because salamanders have been observed to remain stationary near odoriferous prey but only feed if it moves. Cave-dwelling amphibians normally hunt by smell. Some salamanders seem to have learned to recognize immobile prey when it has no smell, even in complete darkness.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, newly wedded companions Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) and Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill) {{are trapped}} on a {{crashing}} space liner which has <b>been</b> <b>caught</b> {{in a strange}} cloud belt.

Inspired by Charles Dickens's A Christmas Carol, the episode has the Doctor attempting to use time travel to alter Kazran's past and make him kinder so he will save the spaceship.|$|E
2500|$|Sri Lanka {{were put}} in to bat by New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori, and after going through the first eight overs without losing a wicket, Sanath Jayasuriya and Kumar Sangakkara <b>were</b> <b>caught</b> in {{successive}} overs.

Oram got another in the 15th over, when opener Upul Tharanga <b>was</b> <b>caught</b> behind for 17, before captain and number five Marvan Atapattu rebuilt with Tillakaratne Dilshan.

5000|$|An {{estimated}} 1 in 2 million lobsters are blue. A {{genetic mutation}} causes a blue lobster {{to produce an}} excessive amount of a particular protein. The protein and a red carotenoid molecule known as astaxanthin combine to form a blue complex known as crustacyanin, giving the lobster its blue color. In 2009 a blue lobster <b>was</b> <b>caught</b> in New Hampshire; in 2011, two blue lobsters <b>were</b> <b>caught</b> in Canada, one off of Prince Edward Island, and another in the Esgenoôpetitj First Nation territory in New Brunswick; another <b>was</b> <b>caught</b> in May 2012 off Nova Scotia. A blue lobster <b>was</b> <b>caught</b> off Pine Point in Scarborough, Maine in August 2014, and was donated to a local aquarium to join three other blue lobsters. In August, 2016, one <b>was</b> <b>caught</b> in Massachusetts {{off the coast of}} Cape Cod. In July 2017, a blue lobster <b>was</b> <b>caught</b> near the New Hampshire-Maine border and was donated to the Seacoast Science Center in Rye, New Hampshire.|$|R

5|$|On 9 January 1942, the 718th Infantry Division issued {{orders to}} both its regiments that defined the {{following}} groups as hostile: all non-residents and residents {{that had been}} absent from their localities until recently; all identifiable Chetniks or communists with or without weapons or ammunition; and anyone concealing, supplying or providing information to those groups.

5|$|One of the widest-ranging {{deepwater}} sharks, the Portuguese dogfish is patchily distributed {{around the}} world.

5|$|Physeterids and Kogiids {{consist of}} sperm whales. Sperm whales consist {{the largest and}} {{smallest}} odontocetes, and spend {{a large portion of}} their life hunting squid. P. macrocephalus spends most of its life in search of squid in the depths; these animals do not require any degree of light at all, in fact, blind sperm whales have <b>been</b> <b>caught</b> in perfect health. The behaviour of Kogiids remains largely unknown, but, due to their small lungs, they are thought to hunt in the photic zone.|$|E
