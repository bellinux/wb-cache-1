5|$|After {{these talks}} with Rudd, Lobengula called an indaba (conference) of over 100 izinDuna {{to present the}} {{proposed}} concession terms to them and gauge their sympathies. It {{soon became clear that}} opinion was split: most of the younger izinDuna were opposed to the idea of any concession whatsoever, while the king himself and many of his older izinDuna were open to considering Rudd's bid. The idea of a mining monopoly in the hands of Rudd's powerful backers was attractive to the Matabele in some ways, as it would end the incessant propositioning for concessions by small-time prospectors, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>a</b> case for allowing competition to continue, so that the rival miners would have to compete for Lobengula's favour.|$|E
5|$|Fouroux was {{succeeded by}} Daniel Dubroca, who coached {{the team to}} the 1991 Rugby World Cup. Dubroca's tenure as coach did not last long, however, as he {{resigned}} after violently confronting referee David Bishop following France's World Cup quarter-final against England. Dubroca was replaced by Pierre Berbizier, who coached the team until after the 1995 Rugby World Cup. Berbizier's replacement, Jean-Claude Skrela, coached France to Five Nations Grand Slams in 1997 and 1998 before they came last in the tournament in 1999. He officially resigned following France's loss to Australia in the 1999 Rugby World Cup final. Bernard Laporte was appointed as Skrela's successor in November. Laporte guided France through the 2003 and 2007 Rugby World Cups before stepping down to become Secretary of State for Sport. After Philippe Saint-André turned down the offer to replace Laporte, French Rugby Federation president Bernard Lapasset appointed Marc Lièvremont to guide France to the 2011 World Cup. Lièvremont's tenure as coach was marked by inconsistent and puzzling squad selection choices, and player discontent. There were some bright moments, notably wins against New Zealand in Dunedin and South Africa in Toulouse, and the 2010 Six Nations Grand Slam. <b>But</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>a</b> 59–16 loss to Australia in Paris, a 22–21 loss to Italy in the 2011 Six Nations, and a 19–14 loss to Tonga during the 2011 World Cup. In August 2011, before the World Cup, {{it was announced that}} Philippe Saint-André would replace Lièvremont and guide France to the 2015 World Cup. This came as no surprise to Lièvremont, as he had announced as early as May 2010 that he would not continue as the coach of France after the World Cup.|$|E

25|$|Resistance {{against the}} German {{occupiers}} of Belgium {{can be seen}} at all levels and from all quarters of the political spectrum, but was highly fragmented. The Government in Exile dealt with resistance collectively under the name Armée Secrète, however this was just a broad name for the many resistance organisations which existed. Some organisations were very left-wing, like the Communist Front de l'Indépendance, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>a</b> far-right resistance movement, the Légion Belge which comprised dissident Rexists.

25|$|Courses, {{mouldings}} and all decorative {{details are}} carved with great precision.

Mouldings stand out around doors and windows rather than being recessed, as in Gothic Architecture. Sculptured figures may be set in niches or placed on plinths.

25|$|Men were {{introduced}} into the field of obstetrics {{in the nineteenth century}} and resulted in a change of the focus of this profession. Gynaecology directly resulted as a new and separate field of study from obstetrics and focused on the curing of illness and indispositions of female sexual organs. This had some relevance to some conditions as menopause, uterine and cervical problems, and childbirth could leave the mother in need of extensive surgery to repair tissue. <b>But,</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>a</b> large blame of the uterus for completely unrelated conditions.

25|$|Athlone is {{a popular}} stop for {{pleasure}} craft along the River Shannon. Lough Ree, the largest lake on the Shannon, is a short distance upstream from Athlone, and many boat companies are based out of the town. For craft to pass through Athlone, {{it is necessary to}} use a lock in the river, which beside the weir and downstream of the current road bridge. The lock, weir, and bridge were all constructed by the Shannon navigation commissioners in the 1840s. Before then, boats used a canal, about {{a mile and a half}} long, to the west of the river. The canal was built by Thomas Omer for the Commissioners of Inland Navigation. Work started in 1757 and involved the work of over 300 men. Omer built a single lock, 120′ X 19′ with a rise of 4.5′, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>a</b> guard lock, further upstream, with a single set of gates to protect the canal against floods. There were also two lay-bys, or harbours, one above the lock and another at the upstream end. The old canal is no longer navigable.|$|E
25|$|On {{that same}} day in 1873, the Cortes proclaimed the First Spanish Republic. However, the Republic fell victim to the same instabilities {{provoked}} by the ongoing wars and the division amongst republicans. The majority of republicans were federalists, and they therefore supported {{the formation of a}} federal democratic republic, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>a</b> unitary republic school. What is more, within the federalists there was an intransigent pro-confederation sector that was infuriated and later quashed by the Cantonal Revolution of 1873. The complicated political situation is demonstrated by the fact that in just eleven months there were four presidents of the Republic: Francesc Pi i Margall, Estanislao Figueras, Nicolás Salmerón, and Emilio Castelar (the only non-federalist president). On January 3, 1874, General Manuel Pavía led a coup d'état that established a conservative unitary republican dictatorship under the command of General Francisco Serrano y Domínguez. The dictatorship was in turn ousted by pronunciamiento on December 29, 1874, in which Brigadier General Arsenio Martínez Campos declared the Bourbon Restoration and Alfonso XII ascended to the throne.|$|E

500|$|These customs houses alone {{did little}} to prevent the mass {{avoidance}} of the salt tax. [...] This {{was due to the}} lack of a continuous barrier, corruption within the customs staff and the westward expansion of Bengal towards salt-rich states. [...] In 1823 the Commissioner of Customs for Agra, George Saunders, installed a line of customs posts along the Ganges and Yamuna rivers from Mirzapur to Allahabad that would eventually evolve into the Inland Customs Line. [...] The main aim was to prevent salt from being smuggled from the south and west <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>a</b> secondary line running from Allahabad to Nepal to prevent smuggling from the Northwest frontier. [...] The annexation of Sindh and the Punjab allowed the line to be extended north-west by G. H. Smith, who had become Commissioner of Customs in 1834. [...] Smith exempted items such as tobacco and iron from taxation to concentrate on salt and was responsible for expanding and improving the line, increasing its budget to 790,000 rupees per year and the staff to 6,600 men. [...] Under Smith's leadership the line saw many reforms and was officially named the Inland Customs Line in 1843.|$|E
500|$|Goodall {{suggests}} that the keep was used only for short periods, and the west range, including the great hall, was the lord's preferred residence for prolonged visits to Warkworth Castle. The ground floor was used predominantly for storage of food and wine, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>a</b> room with access to a basement chamber roughly [...] square. This has variously been interpreted as an accounting room with a floor safe, or guardroom with a dungeon dug into the floor. In the keep's west wall was a postern through which stores would pass into the building. Kitchens occupied {{the west side of}} the first floor and were connected via staircases to the stores immediately below. In the south-east corner was a great hall, originally heated by a central hearth and spanning the height of the first and second floors. A chapel off the great hall led to a large formal room where the lord would meet guests. The second floor was entirely domestic in nature, with bedrooms and withdrawing chambers. In the 19thcentury, while the rest of Warkworth Castle was in ruins, the rooms of the second floor were re-roofed and occasionally used by the duke on visits. At the centre of the keep was a lightwell with interior windows; at its foot was a tank for collecting rainwater used for cleaning.|$|E
