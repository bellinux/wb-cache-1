40|$|AIM: To {{determine}} {{the value of}} <b>bowel</b> sounds analysis using an electronic stethoscope to support a clinical diagnosis of intestinal obstruction. METHODS: Subjects were patients who presented with a diagnosis of possible intestinal obstruction based on symptoms, signs, and radiological findings. A 3 M&#x 2122; Littmann® Model 4100 electronic stethoscope {{was used in this}} study. With the patients lying supine, six 8 -second recordings of <b>bowel</b> sounds were taken from each patient from the lower abdomen. The recordings were analysed for sound duration, sound-to-sound interval, dominant frequency, and peak frequency. Clinical and radiological data were reviewed and the patients were classified as having either acute, subacute, or no <b>bowel</b> obstruction. Comparison of <b>bowel</b> sound characteristics was made between these subgroups of patients. In the presence of an obstruction, the site of obstruction was identified and <b>bowel</b> calibre was also measured to correlate with <b>bowel</b> sounds. RESULTS: A total of 71 patients were studied during the period July 2009 to January 2011. Forty patients had acute <b>bowel</b> obstruction (27 small <b>bowel</b> obstruction and 13 large <b>bowel</b> obstruction), 11 had subacute <b>bowel</b> obstruction (eight in the small <b>bowel</b> and three in large <b>bowel)</b> and 20 had no <b>bowel</b> obstruction (diagnoses of other conditions were made). Twenty-five patients received surgical intervention (35. 2 %) during the same admission for acute abdominal conditions. A total of 426 recordings were made and 420 recordings were used for analysis. There {{was no significant difference in}} sound-to-sound interval, dominant frequency, and peak frequency among patients with acute <b>bowel</b> obstruction, subacute <b>bowel</b> obstruction, and no <b>bowel</b> obstruction. In acute large <b>bowel</b> obstruction, the sound duration was significantly longer (median 0. 81 s vs 0. 55 s, P = 0. 021) and the dominant frequency was significantly higher (median 440 Hz vs 288 Hz, P = 0. 003) when compared to acute small <b>bowel</b> obstruction. No significant difference was seen between acute large <b>bowel</b> obstruction and large <b>bowel</b> pseudo-obstruction. For patients with small <b>bowel</b> obstruction, the sound-to-sound interval was significantly longer in those who subsequently underwent surgery compared with those treated non-operatively (median 1. 29 s vs 0. 63 s, P < 0. 001). There was no correlation between <b>bowel</b> calibre and <b>bowel</b> sound characteristics in both acute small <b>bowel</b> obstruction and acute large <b>bowel</b> obstruction. CONCLUSION: Auscultation of <b>bowel</b> sounds is non-specific for diagnosing <b>bowel</b> obstruction. Differences in sound characteristics between large <b>bowel</b> and small <b>bowel</b> obstruction may help {{determine the}} likely site of obstruction...|$|R
40|$|During video capsule {{endoscopy}} (VCE), several factors, such as air bubbles, food {{material in}} the small <b>bowel,</b> and delayed gastric and small <b>bowel</b> transit time, influence diagnostic yield, small <b>bowel</b> visualization quality, and cecal completion rate. Therefore, <b>bowel</b> preparation before VCE is as essential as <b>bowel</b> preparation before colonoscopy. To date, {{there have been many}} comparative studies, consensus, and guidelines regarding different kinds of <b>bowel</b> cleansing agents in <b>bowel</b> preparation for small <b>bowel</b> VCE. Presently, polyethylene glycol- (PEG-) based regimens are given primary recommendation. Sodium picosulphate-based regimens are secondarily recommended, as their cleansing efficacy is less than that of PEG-based regimens. Sodium phosphate as well as complementary simethicone and prokinetics use are considered.

By 10:00, Boadicea had been joined by Otter and Staunch and bore down on the French ships and their prize, so that by 15:30 Bouvet was persuaded to abandon Africaine and tow the damaged Iphigénie back to Port Napoleon. By 17:00, Boadicea pulled alongside Africaine and the French prize crew surrendered. Rowley later reported that a number of British sailors leaped into the sea at his approach and swam to Boadicea, requesting that they be allowed to pursue the French ships in the hope of capturing one.|$|E
40|$|Symptoms of 50 {{patients}} with the irritable <b>bowel</b> syndrome were {{compared with those of}} 49 with endoscopically proven peptic ulcer disease and 49 with radiologically or endoscopically proven inflammatory <b>bowel</b> disease using a questionnaire which was administered after the diagnosis was made. Symptoms of <b>bowel</b> dysfunction including pain related to <b>bowel</b> movements were more likely to occur in the irritable <b>bowel</b> syndrome than peptic ulcer disease. Only abdominal distension, straining at stool and scybala, however, were significantly more likely in the irritable <b>bowel</b> syndrome than inflammatory <b>bowel</b> disease. Four symptoms previously shown to be more common in irritable <b>bowel</b> syndrome than in organic abdominal disease were combined. The more of these symptoms that were present, the more likely were the patients to have the irritable <b>bowel</b> syndrome than peptic ulcer disease. Symptoms of gut dysfunction are highly discriminating between irritable <b>bowel</b> syndrome and peptic ulcer disease but less so between irritable <b>bowel</b> syndrome and inflammatory <b>bowel</b> disease...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} morphological {{changes of}} intestinal smooth muscle contractile fibres in small <b>bowel</b> atresia patients. METHODS: Resected small <b>bowel</b> specimens from small <b>bowel</b> atresia patients (n = 12) {{were divided into}} three sections (proximal, atretic and distal). Standard histology hematoxylin-eosin staining and enzyme immunohistochemistry was performed to visualize smooth muscle contractile markers &#x 3 B 1;-smooth muscle actin (SMA) and desmin using conventional paraffin sections of the proximal and distal <b>bowel.</b> Small <b>bowel</b> from age-matched patients (n = 2) undergoing Meckel&#x 2019;s diverticulum resection served as controls. RESULTS: The smooth muscle coat in the proximal <b>bowel</b> of small <b>bowel</b> atresia patients was thickened compared with control tissue, but the distal <b>bowel</b> was unchanged. Expression of smooth muscle contractile fibres SMA and desmin within the proximal <b>bowel</b> was slightly reduced compared with the distal <b>bowel</b> and control tissue. There were no major differences in {{the architecture of the}} smooth muscle within the proximal <b>bowel</b> and the distal <b>bowel.</b> The proximal and distal <b>bowel</b> in small <b>bowel</b> atresia patients revealed only minimal differences regarding smooth muscle morphology and the presence of smooth muscle contractile filament markers.

5|$|In a later {{version of}} the film, Auto comes to the docking bay to {{retrieve}} EVE's plant. The film would have its first cutaway to the captain, but Stanton moved that as he found it too early to begin moving away from WALL-E's point-of-view.

Stanton removed this to keep some mystery as to why the plant is taken from EVE. The captain appears to be unintelligent, but Stanton wanted him to just be unchallenged; otherwise he would have been unempathetic. One example of how unintelligent the captain was depicted initially is that he was seen to wear his hat upside-down, only to fix it before he challenges Auto. In the finished film, he merely wears it casually atop his head, tightening it when he assumes real command of the Axiom.|$|E

40|$|In this study, we {{aimed to}} {{determine}} gastrointestinal {{problems associated with}} neurogenic <b>bowel</b> dysfunction in spinal cord injury patients and to assess the efficacy of <b>bowel</b> program on gastrointestinal problems and the severity of neurogenic <b>bowel</b> dysfunction. Fifty-five spinal cord injury patients were included in this study. A <b>bowel</b> program according to the characteristics of neurogenic <b>bowel</b> dysfunction was performed for each patient. Before and after <b>bowel</b> program, gastrointestinal problems (constipation, difficult intestinal evacuation, incontinence, abdominal pain, abdominal distension, loss of appetite, hemorrhoids, rectal bleeding and gastrointestinal induced autonomic dysreflexia) and <b>bowel</b> evacuation methods (digital stimulation, oral medication, suppositories, abdominal massage, Valsalva maneuver and manual evacuation) were determined. Neurogenic <b>bowel</b> dysfunction score {{was used to assess}} the severity of neurogenic <b>bowel</b> dysfunction. At least one gastrointestinal problem was identified in 44 (80 %) of the 55 patients before <b>bowel</b> program. Constipation (56 %, 31 / 55) and incontinence (42 %, 23 / 55) were the most common gastrointestinal problems. Digital rectal stimulation was the most common method for <b>bowel</b> evacuation, both before (76 %, 42 / 55) and after (73 %, 40 / 55) <b>bowel</b> program. Oral medication, enema and manual evacuation application rates were significantly decreased and constipation, difficult intestinal evacuation, abdominal distention, and abdominal pain rates were significantly reduced after <b>bowel</b> program. In addition, mean neurogenic <b>bowel</b> dysfunction score was decreased after <b>bowel</b> program.

5|$|The French monarchy {{asserted}} its {{rights to}} encroach on Edward's legal rights in Gascony. Resistance to one judgement in Saint-Sardos resulted in Charles IV declaring the duchy forfeit. Charles's sister, Queen Isabella, {{was sent to}} negotiate and agreed a treaty that required Edward to pay homage in France to Charles. Edward resigned Aquitaine and Ponthieu to his son Edward, who travelled to France to give homage in his stead. With the English heir in her power, Isabella refused to return to England unless Edward II dismissed his favourites, and she became the mistress of Roger Mortimer. The couple invaded England and, with Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster, captured the king. Edward II abdicated on condition that his son would inherit the throne rather than Mortimer. Although there is no historical record of the cause of death, he is popularly {{believed to have been}} murdered at Berkeley Castle by having a red-hot poker thrust into his <b>bowels.</b> A coup by Edward III ended four years of control by Isabella and Mortimer. Mortimer was executed. Though removed from power, Isabella was treated well, and lived in luxury for the next 27 years.|$|E

Armstrong decides to spare Cate's life, believing {{that she is a}} fellow Scot. Cate awakens and is soon thrown from the plane as it explodes. After surviving the fall via parachute, Cate is later introduced to a new partner, Tom Goodman, a UNITY agent from the American branch. After meeting him in a nightclub in Hamburg, they are ambushed by H.A.R.M. but manage to escape. The nightclub is owned by a German singer named Inge Wagner, whom Cate suspects is connected with H.A.R.M. The two are then tasked to investigate a cargo freighter containing several suspicious chemical containers that UNITY believes are linked to Dr. Schenker. Cate gets in the freighter, and after taking photos of the containers, is knocked unconscious by Armstrong, who spares her life by locking her in a cargo hold, thus ignoring Wagner's insistence that she must be liquidated. As the freighter heads out to sea, it slowly begins to sink, due to a huge explosion. Wagner and Armstrong escape immediately, but Cate has to fight her way out of the <b>bowels</b> of the freighter. Because Cate could not obtain the required information, she and Tom must return to the sunken freighter to finish gathering intelligence aboard. Cate goes scuba diving, and after investigating the shipwreck and obtaining the captain's log and the cargo manifest, she is ambushed by H.A.R.M. divers sent from a submarine commanded by Armstrong and Wagner but manages to escape.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The Inflammatory <b>Bowel</b> Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) is a disease-specific {{quality of}} life instrument. We {{translated}} and adapted the questionnaire and tested its reliability and (cross-cultural) validity. METHODS: We surveyed 271 patients with inflammatory <b>bowel</b> disease. The inflammatory <b>Bowel</b> Disease Questionnaire and its dimensional scores (<b>bowel,</b> systemic, social and emotional) were correlated with disease activity, health care use, medication and three other indices of {{quality of life}}. RESULTS: The reliability coefficient of the Inflammatory <b>Bowel</b> Disease Questionnaire was high (0. 93). Patients with higher disease activity had significantly lower quality of life on all Inflammatory <b>Bowel</b> Disease Questionnaire dimensions (P < 0. 001). Inflammatory <b>Bowel</b> Disease Questionnaire scores were significantly correlated with health care use (P < 0. 01) but not with medication. Almost all Inflammatory <b>Bowel</b> Disease Questionnaire dimensions correlated highly (0. 43 - 0. 79, P < 0. 001) with the corresponding scales of the standard quality of life indices, except for the <b>bowel</b> dimension.
