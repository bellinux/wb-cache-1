She spent her life working as a cook or {{housekeeper}} in wealthy households, and unlike Elizabeth Raffald who left service to run her own shop, continued in that profession despite the success of her book.

She is critical of cookery books written <b>by</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> conceal their secrets, preventing readers from using their recipes successfully.|$|E
5|$|Sexual {{encounters}} at bathhouses are frequently, but not always, anonymous. Some {{feel that}} the anonymity adds to the erotic excitement: that is what, for these patrons, one goes to the bathhouse for. Bathhouse encounters sometimes lead to relationships, but usually do not. Bathhouses are still used <b>by</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> {{have sex with men}} and do not identify as gay or bisexual, including those that are closeted or in heterosexual relationships.|$|E
5|$|Following the battle, Santa Anna was {{alternately}} {{viewed as}} a national hero or a pariah. Mexican perceptions of the battle often mirrored the prevailing viewpoint. Santa Anna had been disgraced following his capture at the Battle of San Jacinto, and many Mexican accounts of the battle were written <b>by</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> had been, or had become, his outspoken critics. Petite and many other historians believe {{that some of the}} stories, such as the execution of Crockett, may have been invented to further discredit Santa Anna. In Mexican history, the Texas campaign, including the Battle of the Alamo, was soon overshadowed by the Mexican–American War of 1846–48.|$|E

5|$|The issue {{came back}} to life in February of the {{following}} year when, two days before Flores' birthday, Padilla reported being kidnapped and stabbed by two gunmen. Padilla received 57 shallow slashes from a dagger which did not put his life in danger, but he could have died from blood loss. Padilla blamed Flores for the stabbing and for an earlier attack {{in which he was}} allegedly beaten <b>by</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> warned him against criticizing the church leader. A church spokesman denied that the church or Flores had any involvement in the attack and suggested that Padilla may have orchestrated the attack {{in a desperate attempt to}} authenticate his previous charges against the church.|$|E
5|$|On board Arctic, disquiet turned {{increasingly}} into panic as {{it became}} clear that lifeboat capacity was inadequate. Shortly after the port guard boat's departure, the port quarter boat, with around twelve women and five crew aboard, was being readied for lowering into the water when it, too, was rushed by members of the crew. In the general melee the boat was upended, sending all but three of its occupants into the water, where they drowned. On {{the other side of the}} ship, Luce ordered Second Officer Baalham to launch the starboard guard boat and proceed with it to the stern, where women and children passengers would be passed down. No sooner was it launched when it was overwhelmed <b>by</b> <b>men,</b> <b>who</b> leapt into the water and clambered into the boat; all but one of these were crew members. With his boat now full, Baalham disregarded Luce's instructions to pick up women and children, and drifted away. Meanwhile, the upended port quarter boat had been righted, but despite Luce's efforts to give women passengers priority, it was again rushed by crew and male passengers, who thrust aside the waiting women and cut the boat adrift from the ship while it was only partially filled.|$|E
5|$|Haakon's councillors {{had sought}} to {{reconcile}} Haakon and Skule by proposing marriage between Haakon and Skule's daughter Margrete in 1219. Haakon accepted the proposal (although {{he did not think}} it would change much politically), but the marriage between Haakon and Margrete did not take place before 1225, partly due to the conflict with Ribbung. The relationship between Haakon and Skule nevertheless deteriorated further during the 1230s, and attempts of settlements at meetings in 1233 and 1236 only distanced them more from each other. Periodically, the two nonetheless reconciled and spent a great amount of time together, only to have their friendship destroyed, according to the saga by intrigues derived from rumours and slander <b>by</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> played the two against each other. Skule was the first person ever in Norway to be titled Duke (hertug) in 1237, but instead of control over a region gained the rights to the incomes from a third of the syssels scattered across the whole of Norway. This was part of an attempt by Haakon to limit Skule's power. In 1239 the conflict between the two erupted into open warfare when Skule had himself proclaimed king. Although he had some support in Trøndelag, Opplandene and in eastern Viken, he could not stand up to Haakon's forces. The rebellion ended when Skule was killed in 1240, leaving Haakon the undisputed king of Norway. This revolt is generally taken to mark the final end of Norway's civil war era.|$|E
