Players gave him nicknames like [...] "Saddam" [...] (Saddam Hussein) or “Quälix”, a rhyming mash of his first name Felix and the German verb “quälen” (to torture). He was once described by former Eintracht Frankfurt player Bachirou Salou as the [...] "last dictator in Europe". After leaving Fulham in September 2014, bizarre stories emerged about how Magath had suggested that Brede Hangeland rub cheese on a thigh injury.

40|$|AbstractStudy objective:to observe {{changes in}} {{perceived}} health in patients during {{a clinical trial}} of treatments for venous leg ulceration. Design:randomised prospective factorial trial in patients with venous ulceration. Each patient randomised to a <b>bandage,</b> <b>dressing</b> and a drug. Perceived health assessed at entry and after 24 weeks. Setting:outpatient departments and patient's home. Patients:two hundred patients presenting to two vascular services in Falkirk and Edinburgh with chronic (duration > 2 months) non-healing venous ulceration. Statistical analysis and main results:analysis using the Nottingham Health Profile revealed that after 24 weeks there were significant improvements in all subscores (p< 0. 01) {{with the exception of}} social isolation (p= 0. 081). Patients with healed ulceration had improved in energy, pain, emotion, sleep and mobility compared with those whose ulceration failed to heal (p< 0. 05). Patients randomised to four layer bandaging had significantly better energy (diff= 7. 9, 95 % CI 0. 2, 15. 6,p= 0. 04) and mobility (diff= 4. 5, 95 % CI 0. 0, 9. 0,p= 0. 046). This difference could be explained largely by the improved healing of patients randomised to this bandage system (67 / 97 vs. 50 / 103, OR= 2. 37, 95 % CI 1. 31, 4. 27). Conclusions:improvements in perceived health were significantly greater in patients whose ulcers had completely healed. Methods of treatment which offer improved healing for patients with venous leg ulceration are likely to improve patients» perceived health status...|$|E

40|$|Objective: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to understand the trends and research hotspots of clinical nursing in China and abroad, thereby to provide guidance for nursing practice and studies. Methods: We retrieved clinical nursing literature (excluding literature related to psychological nursing and traditional Chinese medicine nursing) cited in Wanfang Data (www. wanfangdata. com. cn) and PubMed between 2007 and 2015 and subsequently performed bibliometric analyses on article volume, journal, clustering of high-frequency keywords, and co-occurrence of keywords. Results: A total of 10374 publications, excluding those related to psychological nursing, were retrieved via a PubMed search. The literature displayed a rising trend in terms of annual publication volume. The journal distribution of clinical nursing publications overall was consistent with Bradford's Law. The main contents of clinical nursing literature between 2007 and 2009 included: (1) studies on effects of the midwife and midwifery methods for natural childbirth; (2) studies on emergency nursing care; (3) studies on dementia care; (4) studies on <b>bandage</b> <b>dressing</b> in trauma nursing; and (5) studies on quality of life in cancer patients nursing. The main contents of clinical nursing literature between 2010 and 2012 included: (1) studies on obstetric nurseâpatient relationships; (2) studies on patients' medical team in stroke nursing; (3) studies on cancer nursing methods; (4) studies on nursing patients with trauma related to urinary incontinence; and (5) studies on {{the quality of life of}} caregivers of dementia patients. The main contents of clinical nursing literature between 2013 and 2015 included (1) studies on skin care and bandaging in trauma nursing; (2) studies on evidence-based nursing in AIDS care; (3) studies on nurses' role in obstetric nurseâpatient relationships; studies on cancer nursing methods; (4) studies on nursing for Alzheimer's disease and dementia; and (5) studies on caregivers and nursing of stroke patients. A Wanfang Data search retrieved a total of 85570 publications, whose volume also exhibited an annual rising trend, in particular with regard to those in core journals. However, percentage of total publication volume, mean cited frequency per article, and total ranking of clinical nursing publications overall displayed a decreasing trend. The main contents of clinical nursing literature between 2007 and 2009 included: (1) diabetes nursing; (2) nursing for cancer; (3) nursing for senility-related diseases; (4) nursing in the event of complications; (5) nursing for hypertension; (6) studies on quality of life after nursing interventions; (7) chemotherapy nursing; (8) studies on compliance after nursing interventions; (9) constipation nursing; and (10) nursing for stroke patients. The main contents of clinical nursing literature between 2010 and 2012 included: (1) diabetes nursing; (2) nursing for cancer; (3) nursing for senility-related diseases; (4) studies on quality of life after nursing interventions; (5) nursing in the event of complications; (6) nursing for hypertension; (7) prevention nursing; (8) perioperative nursing; (9) pain nursing; and (10) studies on compliance after nursing interventions. The main contents of clinical nursing literature between 2013 and 2015 included: (1) diabetes nursing; (2) nursing in the event of complications; (3) cancer nursing; (4) studies on quality of life after nursing interventions; (5) nursing for stroke patients; (6) nursing for the elderly; (7) studies on compliance after nursing interventions; (8) nursing for hypertension; (9) constipation nursing; and (10) prevention nursing. Conclusions: Clinical nursing research in China is in a rapid development stage as defined by Price's law whereby there is a rapid growth in publication volume. By comparison, clinical nursing research in developed countries is in the stable development stage or maturation phase, which is characterized by a flat curve of publication volume and stable development rate. There is a gap of 25 â 30 years between China and these countries in terms of the growth phases of clinical nursing literature.

5000|$|He founded his {{own label}} Hervé Léger in 1985, {{pioneering}} the <b>bandage</b> <b>dresses</b> {{that would make}} the label famous in 1990. Writing in the International Herald Tribune, fashion critic Suzy Menkes described one of these early collections as “a recipe for the Nineties”. Feats of technical virtuosity, the dresses were made to haute couture standard, each band shaped and mounted individually, lending “the wearers of his dresses a bombshell silhouette that quite literally defined the body-consciousness of the era. Hervé Léger achieved his effect with curve-cleaving elastic bandages and a high-octane technique that defied tradition because he molded his fabric to the female form, rather than draping and cutting it.” The style struck a resounding chord [...] "with women wishing to relish their sexuality and ... unafraid of displaying their redefined bodies". Though various designers have staked a claim as to who did the <b>bandage</b> <b>dresses</b> first, and Leroux has often pointed out that in the modern era the late American couturier Charles James set the standard, he also takes a far longer view of any attribution, telling style.com, “Bands belong to history. They come from Cleopatra, Queen of the Egyptians.”In the takeover-hungry climate of the late 1990s, he lost control of his company Hervé Léger and the commercial use of the name in 1999.|$|R

The importance of genetic counselling cannot be stressed enough, since both M. C. {{and his younger brother}} were diagnosed with EB. If the family had received genetic counselling, this tragic situation could have been prevented. Home care education for the families of EB patients is also of great importance. Relatives of the patient must also be educated about wound care, infection control, patient nutrition and physical treatment.

50|$|Surgical tape {{or medical}} tape {{is a type}} of {{pressure-sensitive}} adhesive tape used in medicine and first aid to hold a <b>bandage</b> or other <b>dressing</b> onto a wound. These tapes usually have a hypoallergenic adhesive which is designed to hold firmly onto skin, dressing materials, and underlying layers of tape, but to remove easily without damaging the skin. They allow air to reach the skin ("breathable"). Some breathable tapes such as Kinesiology Tape, and other elastic bandages with adhesive are made of cotton. Surgical tape is often white because it contains zinc oxide, which is added to help prevent infections. Tapes made of microporous material, such as 3M Micropore, are widely used.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} an improved mobile-based telemetric dual mode sensing system to monitor pressure and moisture levels in compression bandages and dressings used for chronic wound management. The system is fabricated on a 0. 2 mm thick flexible printed circuit material, and is capable of sensing pressure and moisture at two locations simultaneously within a compression <b>bandage</b> and wound <b>dressing.</b> The sensors are calibrated to sense both parameters accurately, and the data are then transmitted wirelessly to a receiver connected to a mobile device. An error-correction algorithm is developed to compensate the degradation in measurement quality due to battery power drop over time. An Android application is also implemented to automatically receive, process, and display the sensed wound parameters. The performance of the sensing system is first validated on a mannequin limb using a compression bandage and wound dressings, and then tested on a healthy volunteer to acquire real-time performance parameters. The results obtained here suggest that this dual mode sensor can perform reliably when placed on a human limb...|$|R
