5|$|A German photographer, Astrid Kirchherr, {{asked if}} they wouldn't mind letting her take {{photographs}} {{of them in a}} photo session, which impressed them, as other groups only had snapshots taken <b>by</b> <b>friends.</b> The next morning Kirchherr took photographs in der Dom, a municipal park, close to the Reeperbahn. In the afternoon Kirchherr took them to her mother's house in Altona, minus Best, who decided not to attend. Dot Rhone, McCartney's girlfriend at the time who later visited Hamburg, described Best as being very quiet and never taking part in conversations with the group.|$|E

Some were sent to Selfe <b>by</b> <b>friends</b> and relatives from Japan, Italy, New Zealand, and Switzerland. Others, un-postmarked, were collected on his travels in 1884-85. These would have formed a research catalogue of contemporary international bridge-building practices for Selfe's own designs.|$|E
5|$|As a {{prominent}} {{member of his}} local community, Bruxner became involved in emerging movements to have a political force for regional areas and joined and was convinced <b>by</b> <b>friends</b> to stand as a Progressive Party candidate in the 1920 New South Wales state election.

5|$|As he grew older, Sadler {{generally}} {{remained in}} good health, {{with the exception}} of a condition that led to the removal of an eye. He died on April 26, 1969, at 93 years of age. Christensen recalls that Sadler was visited <b>by</b> <b>friends</b> and family while on his deathbed; he spoke to them of his confidence in a joyful life after death. He received a full-column obituary in the Chicago Tribune, which discussed his success as a doctor but not his association with The Urantia Book.|$|E
40|$|Cells {{transformed}} <b>by</b> <b>Friend</b> {{virus in}} liquid suspension culture respond to low concentrations of dimethylsulfoxide by initiating hemoglobin synthesis. The kinetics of appearance of such differentiated erythroid cells {{is consistent with}} either the induction of differentiation in a uniformly susceptible population of transformed cells or selection {{for the growth of}} a distinct erythropoietic subpopulation. The dimethylsulfoxide response of individual colonies of cells transformed <b>by</b> <b>Friend</b> virus grown in semisolid medium was studied in order to distinguish between these alternatives. The data do not support a selective effect of dimethylsulfoxide on the growth of a unique erythropoietic subpopulation; they indicate, rather, that the 745 A strain of cells transformed <b>by</b> <b>Friend</b> virus consists of a relatively uniform population of dimethylsulfoxide-sensitive erythropoietic cells...|$|R

Occasionally he played, or accompanied the singing of Delfina Potocka, for his friends. During the summer of 1849, his friends found him an apartment in Chaillot, out of {{the centre of the}} city, for which the rent was secretly subsidised by an admirer, Princess Obreskoff. Here in June 1849 he was visited by Jenny Lind.|$|E

5|$|Benzema {{began his}} {{football}} career at his hometown club Bron Terraillon SC {{at the age}} of eight. While at the club, he was nicknamed Coco <b>by</b> <b>friends</b> and, after scoring two goals in an under-10 match against the Lyon youth academy, began attracting attention from the biggest club in the city. According to Serge Santa Cruz, who was president of Bron Terraillon in the 1990s, Lyon officials had visited him directly in an attempt to sign the youngster; however, Santa Cruz refused. After talking with Benzema's father, the club allowed the player to undergo a trial with Lyon. Following the trial, Benzema officially joined Lyon and was inserted into the club's academy.|$|E

5|$|In 1859, {{three years}} after the first Quaker {{settlers}} arrived in the area, a meeting house was constructed {{on the site of the}} present-day Friends meeting house for US$1,000. Quakers continued to flow into the area through the 1860s and in 1874 the current Friends meeting house was constructed and it has seen little change since it was built. Some minor alterations have taken place, including the addition of a concrete porch to the entryway and a shed on the east (rear) facade. The shed was added around 1910 to serve as a storage space and a privy. The building became a social, political, and religious hub for the area Quakers and the site was visited <b>by</b> <b>Friends</b> from other meeting houses around the state. The building is no longer owned by a religious institution, though there are occasional services held there.|$|E
5|$|Kesselring's own {{trial began}} in Venice on 17 February 1947. The British Military Court was {{presided over by}} Major General Sir Edmund Hakewill-Smith, {{assisted}} by four lieutenant colonels. Colonel Richard C. Halse – who had already obtained {{the death penalty for}} von Mackensen and Kurt Mälzer – was the prosecutor. Kesselring's legal team was headed by Hans Laternser, a skilful German lawyer who specialised in Anglo-Saxon law, had represented several defendants at the Nuremberg Trials, and would later go on to represent Generalfeldmarschall Erich von Manstein. Kesselring's ability to pay his legal team was hampered because his assets had been frozen by the Allies, but his legal costs were eventually met <b>by</b> <b>friends</b> in South America and relatives in Franconia.|$|E

Kirchherr's bedroom (which was all in black, including the furniture, with silver foil on the walls and a large tree branch suspended from the ceiling), was decorated especially for Voormann, with whom she had a relationship, although after the visits to the Kaiserkeller their relationship became purely platonic. Kirchherr started dating Sutcliffe, although she always remained a close friend of Voormann.|$|E
