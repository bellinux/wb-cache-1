25|$|George Peppard's screen {{presence}} {{has some}} agreeable anomalies. He is tough, assured and insolent – {{in a way}} that recalls late Dick Powell rather than early Bogart; but his <b>bright</b> <b>blue</b> <b>eyes</b> and blond hair, his boyish face suggest the all-American athlete, perhaps going to seed. The sophistication is surface deep: you can imagine him in Times Square on a Saturday night, sulky, defiant, out of his depth, not quite certain how he wants to spend the evening.|$|E
25|$|His father (1893–1959), a {{successful}} local surgeon born in Fontainebleau, moved to Poitiers, where {{he set up}} his own practice and married local woman Anne Malapert. She {{was the daughter of}} prosperous surgeon Dr. Prosper Malapert, who owned a private practice and taught anatomy at the University of Poitiers' School of Medicine. Paul Foucault eventually took over his father-in-law's medical practice, while his wife took charge of their large mid-19th-century house, Le Piroir, in the village of Vendeuvre-du-Poitou. Together the couple had three children – a girl named Francine and two boys, Paul-Michel and Denys – who all shared the same fair hair and <b>bright</b> <b>blue</b> <b>eyes.</b> The children were raised to be nominal Roman Catholics, attending mass at the Church of Saint-Porchair, and while Michel briefly became an altar boy, none of the family were devout.|$|E
25|$|Her {{mother died}} in 1838 and she took up much of the {{domestic}} chores {{as a result of}} this while an elder sister and teacher taught her to read and write as well as to sing and use the guitar; she also learned how to sew and cook. The girl also turned a small room in her house as a domestic chapel. Martillo had a clear perception of her call to saintliness as a child and received her Confirmation on 16 September 1839. Martillo frequented a small wood near her home for contemplation in solitude while the guava tree near which she went to is now a large pilgrimage destination. The girl also chose the then-Blessed Mariana de Jesús as her patron with whom she identified and strived to imitate in her own life. Martillo was known for being sweet and thoughtful with a peaceful and generous disposition; she was obedient to those around her and was well-known and loved in her village. Martillo was blonde with <b>bright</b> <b>blue</b> <b>eyes</b> and was strong and agile; she was also tall.|$|E

60|$|His features, {{without being}} quite regular, were frank, open, and pleasing. A half smile, {{which seemed to}} arise from a happy {{exuberance}} of animal spirits, showed now and then that his teeth were well set, and as pure as ivory; whilst his <b>bright</b> <b>blue</b> <b>eye,</b> with a corresponding gaiety, had an appropriate glance for every object which it encountered, expressing good humour, lightness of heart, and determined resolution.|$|R
60|$|The {{mention of}} dolls {{brings us to}} the sister. She was like her mother-- little, soft, fair, and sweet-voiced; just as unlike her {{brothers}} in appearance as possible--except that she had their <b>bright</b> <b>blue,</b> blazing <b>eyes.</b> Her age was eight years.|$|R
500|$|Olga was a chestnut-blonde with <b>bright</b> <b>blue</b> <b>eyes,</b> a broad {{face and}} a turned up nose. She was {{considered}} less pretty than her sisters Maria and Tatiana, though her appearance improved as she grew older. [...] "As a child she was plain, at fifteen she was beautiful", wrote her mother's friend Lili Dehn. [...] "She was slightly above the medium height, with a fresh complexion, deep blue eyes, quantities of light chestnut hair, and pretty hands and feet." ...|$|E
500|$|It {{has been}} popularized in Western culture by the Animal Planet {{television}} series Lemur Street, {{as well as}} by the character King Julien in the animated Madagascar film and TV franchise. The ring-tailed lemur was also the focus of the 1996 Nature documentary A Lemur's Tale, which was filmed at the Berenty Reserve and followed a troop of lemurs. [...] The troop included a special infant named Sapphire, who was nearly albino, with white fur, <b>bright</b> <b>blue</b> <b>eyes,</b> and the characteristic ringed tail.|$|E
500|$|The video {{features}} Madonna in {{a stylized}} recording studio singing the song with back up singers. The video {{was compared to}} the music video of Madonna's single [...] "Rain" [...] (1993). Her look in the video, consists of blue-black icy hair, <b>bright</b> <b>blue</b> <b>eyes</b> and a long dark dress with a beaded necklace around her neck. Madonna's face was mainly shot above her head, with her face looking up {{just ahead of the}} camera focus. Sometimes she looks to a video screen behind her which plays the scenes from the film, as if to take inspiration for her singing. Other times she is accompanied by her back-up singers, mainly during the chorus, and sometimes she sings alone. In front of the studio, the producers are shown deciding which part of the song should be put in lower bass.|$|E
50|$|For {{its first}} seven seasons, Drew's {{workplace}} is {{the office of}} fictional Cleveland department store Winfred-Louder, where he has worked for years and still works as Assistant Director of Personnel. One of his coworkers is Mimi Bobeck (Kathy Kinney), a large woman with a clownish wardrobe, a lot of make-up (including her trademark <b>bright</b> <b>blue</b> <b>eye</b> shadow), and a foul mutual dislike for Drew. The two eventually become closer (although still maintaining a less heated rivalry), primarily because Mimi {{fell in love with}} and married Drew's crossdressing heterosexual brother Steve (John Carroll Lynch), a frequently recurring character.|$|R
60|$|His tall, broad frame stood erect {{again as}} of old, but the proud bearing {{of the head}} was gone. There was the same fearless look in his <b>bright</b> <b>blue</b> <b>eye,</b> but the {{slightly}} self-satisfied curl of the lip was not there. He looked as strong and well as when, on the Irish cliffs, he had longed for the free, wild life of the sea-kings, {{but he did not}} look so youthful; yet the touch of sadness that now rested at times on his countenance gave him a far more regal air,--though he knew it not,--than he ever possessed before. He was dressed in a simple suit of dark grey.|$|R

500|$|While Sinatra never {{formally}} {{learned how}} to read music, he had an impressive understanding of it, and he worked very hard from a young age to improve his abilities {{in all aspects of}} music. A perfectionist, renowned for his dress sense and performing presence, he always insisted on recording live with his band. His <b>bright</b> <b>blue</b> <b>eyes</b> earned him the popular nickname [...] "Ol' Blue Eyes". Sinatra led a colorful personal life, and was often involved in turbulent affairs with women, such as with his second wife Ava Gardner. He went on to marry Mia Farrow in 1966 and Barbara Marx in 1976. Sinatra had several violent confrontations, usually with journalists he felt had crossed him, or work bosses with whom he had disagreements. He was honored at the Kennedy Center Honors in 1983, was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Ronald Reagan in 1985, and the Congressional Gold Medal in 1997. Sinatra was also the recipient of eleven Grammy Awards, including the Grammy Trustees Award, Grammy Legend Award and the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. After his death, American music critic Robert Christgau called him [...] "the greatest singer of the 20th century", and he continues to be seen as an iconic figure.|$|E

6000|$|She {{had thought}} of herself as insisting on {{standing}} beside him and sharing his peril. Had he been himself she must have don so, {{but this was a}} stranger, whose claiming her made her shrink apart till she could feel the identity which, though she believed, she could not realize. Her hand lay cold and tremulous within his warm pressure, but he was too much wrought up and too full of joy and haste to be sensible of anything but of the brave affection that had dared all to come to him; and he was perfectly happy, even as a trumpet-call among the foe warned him to press her fingers to his lips and say, as his <b>bright</b> <b>blue</b> <b>eye</b> kindled, 'God grant that we may meet and thank Him tonight! Farewell, my lost and found! I fight as one who has something to fight for.' ...|$|R
60|$|It was on {{the decline}} of a Syrian day that Richard lay on his couch of sickness, loathing it as much in mind as his illness made it irksome to his body. His <b>bright</b> <b>blue</b> <b>eye,</b> which at all times shone with {{uncommon}} keenness and splendour, had its vivacity augmented by fever and mental impatience, and glanced from among his curled and unshorn locks of yellow hair as fitfully and as vividly as the last gleams of the sun shoot through the clouds of an approaching thunderstorm, which still, however, are gilded by its beams. His manly features showed the progress of wasting illness, and his beard, neglected and untrimmed, had overgrown both lips and chin. Casting himself from side to side, now clutching towards him the coverings, which at the next moment he flung as impatiently from him, his tossed couch and impatient gestures showed at once the energy and the reckless impatience of a disposition whose natural sphere {{was that of the}} most active exertion.|$|R

2500|$|The blue tail coat outfit is {{retained}} {{after he}} was restored back to human, which {{is meant to be}} a stark contrast to the royal regalia and armor he was depicted in before his curse.

[...] Disney has come to embrace the name, as seen in multiple pieces of merchandise as well as a plaque hung up in 2012 (and still hangs there as of 2017) in Walt Disney World's Port Orleans Riverside Royal Rooms that clearly states his name as [...] "Prince Adam." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, Paltrow made small {{appearances}} in the documentary Searching for Debra Winger and the action satire comedy Austin Powers in Goldmember, while she starred in the thriller-drama Possession with Aaron Eckhart as a couple of literary scholars who unearth the amorous secret of two Victorian poets as they find themselves falling under a deepening connection. Critically panned, the film made a lukewarm US$14.8 million worldwide. In the following year, she headlined the romantic comedy View from the Top, where she obtained the part of woman {{from a small town}} who sets out to fulfill her dream of becoming a flight attendant. Budgeted at US$30 million, the film only earned US$7 million in its opening weekend; it eventually grossed US$15.6 domestically and US$19,526,014 worldwide. She herself later disparaged the film, calling it [...] "terrible". Paltrow starred as the titular role in Sylvia (2003), a British biographical drama directed by Christine Jeffs and co-starring Daniel Craig chronicling the romance between prominent poets Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes. Distributed for a limited release in most markets, Sylvia made US$2.9 million internationally. The New York Times, in its review for the film, wrote that [...] "her performance goes well beyond mimicry. She has a vivid, passionate presence, even when her lively features have gone slack with depression and her <b>bright</b> <b>blue</b> <b>eyes</b> have glazed over".|$|E

60|$|Of all the cabriolet-drivers whom we {{have ever}} had the honour and {{gratification}} of knowing by sight—and our acquaintance in this way has been most extensive—there is one who made an impression on our mind which can never be effaced, and who awakened in our bosom a feeling of admiration and respect, which we entertain a fatal presentiment will never be called forth again by any human being. He {{was a man of}} most simple and prepossessing appearance. He was a brown-whiskered, white-hatted, no-coated cabman; his nose was generally red, and his <b>bright</b> <b>blue</b> <b>eye</b> not unfrequently stood out in bold relief against a black border of artificial workmanship; his boots were of the Wellington form, pulled up to meet his corduroy knee-smalls, or at least to approach as near them as their dimensions would admit of; and his neck was usually garnished with a bright yellow handkerchief. In summer he carried in his mouth a flower; in winter, a straw—slight, but, to a contemplative mind, certain indications of a love of nature, and a taste for botany.|$|R
60|$|The {{newcomer}} {{threw his}} reins to the stable-boy--a person {{of all the}} importance necessary to receive so indifferent a guest. He got down nimbly from his horse, produced an enormous handkerchief of many colors, and removed his three-cornered hat that he might the better mop his brow and youthful, almost cherubic face. What time he did so, a pair of <b>bright</b> little <b>blue</b> <b>eyes</b> were very busy with Mr. Caryll's carriage, from which Leduc, Mr. Caryll's valet, was {{in the act of}} removing a portmantle. His mobile mouth fell into lines of satisfaction.|$|R
60|$|He swept {{his great}} scarred thumb over the strings with a resounding flourish, {{and burst into}} a laugh. Then {{he turned his back}} on the unanswering forest, and sat down by the fire again, wiping the sweat from his face and combing out his tangled beard. Nod drew a little away from the fire, and sat softly {{watching}} him. The Oomgar was muttering with wide-open lids. He snatched up a lump of the cold Mulgar-bread that Nod had cooked for his supper, and gnawed it with twitching fingers. He glanced over it with <b>bright</b> <b>blue</b> glittering <b>eyes</b> at his little hunched-up friend.|$|R

50|$|Joanna is {{depicted}} as having red shoulder-length hair, with a distinctive blonde streak that {{was the result of}} a genetic quirk. She has <b>bright,</b> deep <b>blue</b> <b>eyes.</b> She has a pale complexion and a slender, athletic build. Her Perfect Dark Zero model also reveals the presence of a star tattoo on the left side of her neck, which she got while she was in Hong Kong when she turned sixteen. Although she is usually seen in her Carrington Institute outfit, it is mentioned in the books that Joanna usually dresses in leather clothes, with most of her footwear consisting of boots.|$|R
50|$|Raxivort {{resembles a}} xvart of great hideousness (even for a xvart). His skin is <b>bright</b> <b>blue</b> and his <b>eyes</b> glow with orange light. He wears silken {{garments}} over blue chainmail, {{all of which}} shimmer as if aflame. He carries small, bladed weapons such as knives and daggers, {{as well as his}} falchion, the Azure Razor. Raxivort can also {{take the form of a}} rat or a giant bat.|$|R
5|$|Ariel has a {{distinctive}} appearance, with her long, flowing, <b>bright</b> red hair, <b>blue</b> <b>eyes,</b> green mermaid tail and purple seashell bikini top. In the films and television series, {{she is the}} seventh-born daughter of King Triton and Queen Athena of an underwater kingdom of Merfolk called Atlantica. She is often rebellious, {{and in the first}} film, she longs {{to be a part of}} the human world. She marries Prince Eric, whom she rescued from a shipwreck, and together they have a daughter, Melody.|$|R

2500|$|In June 1170, the fifteen-year-old Henry was crowned king {{during his}} father's lifetime, {{something}} originally practised by the French Capetian dynasty and {{adopted by the}} English kings Stephen and Henry II. The physical appearance of Henry at his coronation in 1170 is given in a contemporary court poem written in Latin, where the fifteen-year-old prince is described as being very handsome, [...] "tall but well proportioned, broad-shouldered with a long and elegant neck, pale and freckled skin, <b>bright</b> and wide <b>blue</b> <b>eyes,</b> and a thick mop of the reddish-gold hair".|$|R

He was always cleanly shaved, and if a speck could be seen on his glancing shirt, be {{sure it was a}} speck of taddy from his snuff-box. He wore his old large watch in his fob, attached to a black silk ribbon, at which depended a large gold seal".|$|R
