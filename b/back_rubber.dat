50|$|Following {{contemporary}} American design philosophy, the M103 {{was built}} with a two-piece, cast elliptic armor scheme, {{similar to the}} M48’s design. It featured seven road wheels per side, mounted with long-arm independent torsion bars. The 28” track was shoed in steel <b>backed</b> <b>rubber</b> chevron tracks, allowing for a ground pressure of 12.9 psi. The Continental AV-1790 engine was placed {{at the rear of}} the tank, and produced a maximum output of 810 horsepower and 1600 foot-pound of torque, fed through a General Motors CD-850-4 3-speed transmission. This allowed the 60-ton heavy tank to achieve a maximum road speed of 34 km/h and a maximum climbing gradient of 60%.|$|R
5000|$|Vehicle mats {{generally}} {{come in two}} options: either rubber or carpet fabric.

For instance, carpet mats are generally tufted and have a rubberised anti-slip <b>backing,</b> while <b>rubber</b> mats are heavier duty and more durable.|$|R
50|$|Natural rubber is an elastomer, {{also known}} as tree gum, India rubber, and caoutchouc, which comes from the rubber tree in {{tropical}} regions.

40|$|This {{could be}} a good time to get <b>back</b> into natural <b>rubber.</b> Although prices fell 50 % from 1996 to US$ 0. 70 /kg in 2001, a study {{published}} early in 2002 by the University of Amsterdam predicts that a rise in demand and prices in the mid-term future. Liberia, Ghana and Cameroon have increased production in recent years, but the market share of Côte d Ivoire and Nigeria Africa s biggest producers is at risk. In Côte d Ivoire privatisation has not worked well, leaving smallholder producers the majority to fend for themselves. In Nigeria, replanting has long been neglected and most trees are more than 30 year old, at least 5 years past their prime. Replanting is dear for smallholders: new trees (Hevea brasiliensis) take six years before they can be tapped; regular replanting, and delayed production, cuts directly into the flow of sap and income. The National Agricultural Research Centre in Côte d Ivoire has ways to soften these blows. Rubber can be intercropped with any one crop of rice, yam, groundnut, plantain, maize or vegetables, without any loss of yield. They claim it also grows alongside such cash crops as coffee, cocoa, oil palm, kola and lemon.
