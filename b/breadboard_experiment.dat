40|$|By {{employing}} {{an integrated}} x-ray instrument on a future Mars mission, data obtained will greatly augment those returned by Viking; details characterizing {{the past and}} present environment on Mars and those relevant to the possibility of the origin and evolution of life will be acquired. A combined x-ray fluorescence/x-ray diffraction (XRF/XRD) instrument was breadboarded and demonstrated to accommodate important exobiology and geology experiment objectives outlined for MESUR and future Mars missions. Among others, primary objectives for the exploration of Mars include the intense study of local areas on Mars to establish the chemical, mineralogical, and petrological character of different components of the surface material; to determine the distribution, abundance, and sources and sinks of volatile materials, including an assessment of the biologic potential, now and during past epoches; and to establish the global chemical and physical characteristics of the Martian surface. The XRF/XRD breadboard instrument identifies and quantifies soil surface elemental, mineralogical, and petrological characteristics and acquires data necessary to address questions on volatile abundance and distribution. Additionally, the breadboard is able to characterize the biogenic element constituents of soil samples providing information on the biologic potential of the Mars environment.

Unlike the conventional Dickson converter, the proposed converter can offer the stepped-up/stepped-down voltage {{by combining the}} battery energy and the renewable energy. Furthermore, the proposed converter can realize many conversion ratios. Therefore, by choosing the optimal combination of conversion ratio, the proposed converter can alleviate the energy loss caused by the output regulation. Through theoretical analyses, simulations and experiments, the following results were shown: 1.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{research}} teams {{have observed that}} glass forming melts that are solidified in low-g exhibit enhanced glass formation. This project will examine one of these glasses, the heavy metal fluoride glass ZBLAN. A four year ground based research program has been approved to examine the crystallization of ZBLAN glasses {{with the purpose of}} testing a theory for the crystallization of ZBLAN glass. The theory could explain the general observations of enhanced glass formation of other glasses melted and solidified in low-g. Fluid flow in 1 -g results from buoyancy forces and surface tension driven convection. This fluid flow can introduce shear in undercooled liquids in 1 -g. In low-g it is known that fluid flows are greatly reduced so that the shear rate in fluids in low-g are extremely low. It is believed that fluids may have some weak structure in the absence of flow. Even very small shear rates could cause this structure to collapse in response to the shear. A general result would be shear thinning of the fluid. The hypothesis of this research is that: Shear thinning in undercooled liquids increases the rate of nucleation and crystallization of glass forming melts. Shear of the melt can be reduced in low-g enhancing undercooling and glass formation. Samples will be melted and quenched in 1 -g under quiescent conditions at a number of controlled cooling rates to determine times and temperatures of crystallization and heated at controlled heating rates to determine kinetic crystallization parameters. Experiments will also be performed on the materials while under controlled vibration conditions and compared with the quiescent experiments in order to evaluate the effect of shear in the liquid on crystallization kinetics. After the experimental parameters are well known, experiments will be repeated under low-g (and 2 -g) conditions on the KC- 135 aircraft during low-g parabolic maneuvers. The results will determine the effects of shear on crystallization. Our experimental setups will be designed with low-g experiments in mind and will be tested as <b>breadboard</b> low-g <b>experiments.</b> It is very likely that the thermal analysis instrumentation can be adapted to be run in the microgravity glovebox facilities. Critical space experiments may result to test the theory at longer low-g time experiments in space...|$|R
40|$|Mass-spring {{and liquid}} dampers enable {{structural}} vibration control to attenuate single, coupled lateral and torsional vibrations in diverse structures. Out of these, the passively tuned liquid damper (TLD) class is wanted {{due to its}} broad applicability, extreme reliability, robustness, long life time and ease of manufacturability. In this PhD thesis, the theory, design, verification and validation of multi-mode TLDs in terrestrial and mainly spacecraft (S/C) applications have been studied. The most challenging TLD design of the type “tube-with-endpots” was the Chinese meteorological FY- 2 S/C nutation damper in the 90 s. The extreme performance requirements like the 0. 5 ” residual nutation damping angle implied an extended test program which led to refined insights in the recursive calibration method and limiting damping performance. The test analysis results and the involvement in the in-orbit analysis of the Ulysses S/C nutation anomaly in the same period, led the author {{to the idea of}} a multi-mode TLD system. The concept was proposed and successfully applied in the Cluster S/C for the effective damping of both nutation and coupled wire boom (antenna) oscillation modes. To come that far, the essentials of spacecraft dynamics and its control required an extension of the liquid flow models and an appropriate TLD design methodology to include multi-mode excitations. The TLD key performance parameters are the dissipation rate, residual damping angle and the resonance frequency which is directly related to the effective damping length. This parameter used to be obtained by an educated guess on basis of test heritage. The existing practical design rules, however, were overruled by new insights which are based on the latest scientific results from fluid mechanics. This knowledge and the extensive analysis of all available TLD damping performance tests resulted in a new refined methodology to estimate the effective damping length properly. The eventual value, however, must still be determined via recursive calibration cycles but better initial estimates reduce the required test times significantly. The residual damping angle is limited by the TLD endpot behavior which is determined by the physics of the liquid meniscus interaction with the endpot wall. Though the TLD design is characterized by a very low residual angle with almost zero dead-band, the very limit is not clear. This issue was investigated using multiple models and experiments whilst the state-of-the-art in the scientific literature from nano-tribology and wetting transitions on biomimetic surfaces was explored. Test refinements are proposed to decrease damping fluctuations and extend the low angular test range. Although, the limiting angle is not known, there is strong evidence that the limits can be extended beyond the 0. 1 ” flight value. The early design phase of the broadband Cluster TLDs in 1991 and the TLD developments up to 2012 were studied. Moreover, the spin-stabilized magneto-spherical S/C Bepi-Colombo, Cluster, RBSP, DICE, Themis and FAST are compared which confirm the applicability of the multi-mode TLD concept. The study of the generic theory of wire boom oscillations, gyroscopically coupled to the S/C hub spin and nutation modes, resulted in a new harmonized parameterization and derived equations. The Cluster TLD system with in addition the internal wire boom damping enable the boom deflection limit and its damping time constant to be design parameters. On basis of this knowledge, a recursive bottom-up TLD design methodology was developed. The stability study including the wire boom composition made clear where the limit of multi-mode modeling is reached and <b>breadboard</b> <b>experiments</b> and practical engineering trade-offs are required. The optimal wire boom deployment strategy using the multi-mode damping principle was analyzed. At small angular deflections, however, material artifacts and anelastic flexure dominate and only dedicated engineering tests can clarify these issues. The current status of the TLD design was investigated by comparing the RBSP S/C [2012] ring TLD and the Cluster S/C [2000] endpot TLD designs. The combination of the Cluster TLD bottom-up design methodology with the 9 degrees of freedom RBSP top-down model completed the model base for the design of multi-mode TLDs in flexible S/C. The RBSP TLD suffers with considerable angular off-sets and inrush time constants which are not accounted for in the RBSP model. The Cluster TLD design, however, lacks these artifacts. RBSP S/C flight validation data, however, are not yet available. The nutation related Cluster flight data validate the TLD model predictions firmly within the requirements. This renders an indirect but incomplete prove of the effectiveness of the TLD system design. It is hard, however, to trace and validate the designed multi-mode performance itself. It is, therefore, of great scientific value to obtain Attitude Determination and Control System flight data. A successful TLD development requires risk mitigation as an essential part of systems engineering (SE). An inventory of boundary conditions was made thinking ahead for production and project cost escalations. In the high-tech industry, however, there is little focus on a scientifically based bottom-up SE approach though such effort does pay off. It was one of the quests of this thesis to prove the added value of such an investment. As a result, the developed methodologies do contribute to a profound SE approach in the development of multi-mode TLDs. The space qualified broadband TLD design with endpots is an excellent choice for use in future spin-stabilized S/C with wire boom configurations. The results of the PhD thesis enable the extreme refinement of the given damper concept. Market research and the allocation of dedicated solutions are a way towards valorization. Terrestrial spin-offs in the engineering fields of refined (ultra) centrifuges, pulsating industrial piping systems, windmills, earthquake control of building structures, shipbuilding and bridge stabilization offer the best valorization opportunities in short terms.

40|$|The {{process of}} {{miniaturization}} brings benefits {{in many areas}} of every day life. It describes the process of down-scaling mechanical, optical and electronic devices while maintaining their function. This continuous process has brought up the field of nanotechnology. It allows computers to run faster and faster while reducing their size and energy consumption. Many bio-analytical applications profit from smaller sizes to be more sensitive with lower sample volumes. Finally, each and every living cell contains the most complex nanoscopic machinery. In order to mimic nature’s highly efficient concepts, they first of all need to be understood. Their nanoscopic dimensions, however, make this task a very challenging one. Direct observation of subcellular processes by conventional light microscopy is difficult as almost all cellular components are colorless. Fluorescence microscopy introduces sufficient contrast and can be specifically applied to many different target molecules but remains limited in its spatial resolution. In this work, a new approach to increase the resolution of fluorescence microscopy is presented that is termed “blink microscopy”. It is based on the subsequent localization of single molecules as it is realized in recent techniques known as STORM or PALM, but does not require special photoswitchable fluorophores or multiple lasers. Instead of photoswitching, reversible electron transfer reactions are used to generate the required dark states. Motivated by the task to assess the resolution of blink microscopy, DNA nanotechnology is used for nano-construction of a calibration structure. The DNA origami technique, developed by Paul Rothemund in 2006, allows for arranging of individual fluorophores at distances of 1 – 100 nm on a DNA nanostructure. While it is impossible to resolve two spots at a distance below 200 nm with conventional fluorescence microscopy, it was possible to confidently resolve 50 nm with blink microscopy. These experiments prove both, blink microscopy to be able to reliably resolve small distances and DNA origami structures to be well suited as a rigid <b>breadboard</b> for fluorescence <b>experiments.</b> This research pioneering the combination of the two powerful tools of nano-imaging and nanoconstruction set the ground for further experiments. After the rigidity of DNA origami structures was used to characterize a fluorescence technique, single-molecule fluorescence could also help to characterize properties of the DNA origami. Namely, dynamic processes on a DNA nanostructure were exemplarily studied by reversible binding of a fluorescently labeled DNA strand while observing this process in real-time on a fluorescence microscope. With the knowledge about binding and unbinding kinetics of DNA and imaging of single molecules, another super-resolution approach was developed that is simply and flexibly implemented in DNA structures, not limited by photobleaching, easy to extend to multiple colors and that shows potential for cellular imaging...|$|R
