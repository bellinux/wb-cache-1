5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that effects related to either electrostatic charging or discharging might be able to account for some of the transient lunar phenomena. One possibility is that electrodynamic effects related to the fracturing of near-surface materials could charge any gases that might be present, such as implanted solar wind or radiogenic daughter products. If this were to occur at the surface, the subsequent discharge from this gas might <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> rise to phenomena visible from Earth. Alternatively, it has been proposed that the triboelectric charging of particles within a gas-borne dust cloud could give rise to electrostatic discharges visible from Earth. Finally, electrostatic levitation of dust near the terminator could potentially give rise to some form of phenomenon visible from Earth.|$|E
5|$|When the Kindred escort {{the agents}} {{out of the}} village, Mulder {{comments}} {{on the lack of}} children in the community and states that he recognizes some of the faces from photographs taken in the 1930s. Curious, he returns to the village that night, and hears chanting as a procession of the Kindred moves to a barn. Scully is led off by Brother Andrew, who claims to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> her information about the murderer, whom he calls Brother Martin. Downstairs in the barn, the group can be seen bathing Brother Aaron's body in watery clay. Mulder hides in a crevice, where he discovers that the sick man has been buried alive and has begun to take on feminine features. Meanwhile, Brother Andrew uses his power to seduce Scully. She is unable to resist, and {{is on the verge of}} succumbing before Mulder comes to her aid. The agents are again escorted out of the village.|$|E

25|$|The {{purpose of}} the fourteen-day time limit {{is to ensure that}} {{creditors}} have sufficient opportunity to peruse the statement of affairs and {{to decide whether or not}} to oppose the application. The legislature’s objective in imposing the thirty-day limit was to ensure that debtors would not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> long notice, months beforehand, and in that way to keep creditors from levying execution and in the meantime dissipate all their assets. Failure to adhere strictly to the third-day time period has mostly been taken to be fatal to the application. In Ex parte Harmse, the court held that the failure is a formal defect or irregularity, as envisaged by section 157(1), and therefore does not invalidate the application unless it has caused a substantial injustice which cannot be remedied by a court order.|$|E
25|$|People {{believed}} {{that women who}} were not faithful to their husbands would experience prolonged labor, and male traditional healers would remark that a promiscuous woman {{would have to tell}} every person in the room the number of men she has slept with apart from her husband before she would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> birth. Other traditional beliefs and practices related to laboring women included special herbs being used when the umbilical cord was wrapped around the neck of the fetus and for breech presentations, hot water poured on the abdomen and okra smeared on the vagina to expedite delivery, women who could not birth the placenta were given a bottle to blow into in order to force the placenta out, and a calabash of hot water was placed on the abdomen to stop postpartum hemorrhage and bleeding. Although many people have extensive knowledge of these traditional beliefs and practices, many indicate that most people no longer use them.|$|E

25|$|Modern logicists (like Bob Hale, Crispin Wright, {{and perhaps}} others) have {{returned}} to a program closer to Frege's. They have abandoned Basic Law V in favor of abstraction principles such as Hume's principle (the number of objects falling under the concept F equals the number of objects falling under the concept G {{if and only if}} the extension of F and the extension of G can be put into one-to-one correspondence). Frege required Basic Law V to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> an explicit definition of the numbers, but all the properties of numbers can be derived from Hume's principle. This would not have been enough for Frege because (to paraphrase him) it does not exclude the possibility that the number 3 is in fact Julius Caesar. In addition, many of the weakened principles that they have had to adopt to replace Basic Law V no longer seem so obviously analytic, and thus purely logical.|$|E
25|$|The Software Configuration Management system, is {{a system}} at the vendor’s site which keeps track of the {{configurations}} at the customer site. By storing this in a system the vendor will <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> the customer particular service when it needs a new product. In the software configuration management system information about the products used by the customer, the version of these products, as well as which updates are already being done, is stored. In some cases {{it is possible that}} the vendor did some modifications to the product particularly for this customer. This will also have to be stored in the system. Also there needs to be configuration data, some generic information about the configuration the customer is using. For example what operating platform the customer uses for its software. What also should be stored in this system is information about the feedback that the vendor gets from the customer. This includes bug reports, product usage data, error reports and usage questions. More information about this feedback can be found in the CCU phase activation and usage.|$|E
25|$|Most dairy {{producers}} aim for {{a replacement}} heifer {{to give birth to}} her first calf, and thus join the milking herd, on her second birthday. As the cow’s gestation period is a little over 9 months this means the cow must be inseminated by the age of 15 months. Because the breeding process is inefficient, most producers aim to first breed their heifers between 12–14 months. Before a heifer can be bred she must reach sexual maturity and attain the proper body condition to successfully bear a calf. Puberty in cattle depends largely on weight among other factors. Holstein heifers reach puberty at an average body weight between 550 to 650 lbs. Smaller breeds of cattle, such as Jerseys, usually reach puberty earlier at a lighter weight. Under typical nutritional conditions, Holstein heifers will reach puberty at the age 9–10 months. Proper body condition for breeding is also largely judged by weight. At about 800lbs Holstein heifers will normally be able to carry a healthy calf and give birth with relative ease. In this way, the heifers will <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> birth and join the milking herd before their second birthday.|$|E
