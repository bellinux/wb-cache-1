25|$|The 1970 VAM Javelins {{received}} a new front suspension design with dual control arms and <b>ball</b> <b>joints.</b> Units with four-speed manual transmissions incorporated a Hurst linkage as factory-installed equipment, which was previously available {{only with the}} optional Go Pack package and separately in certain dealerships. A mid-year change replaced the imported Borg-Warner T10 manual transmission {{in favor of the}} Querétaro-produced TREMEC 170-F four-speed model to comply with the percentages of both local and imported equipment mandated by law.|$|E
25|$|The Hetch Hetchy Aqueduct, which {{supplies}} 270 to 315 {{million gallons}} of water per day to the City of San Francisco and other Bay Area communities, directly crosses the Hayward Fault in Fremont. A 2002 report by the Bay Area Economic Forum suggests that a breakdown in the aqueduct due to an earthquake could cut off Hetch Hetchy water to the Bay Area for 60 days. In addition to depriving 85% of San Francisco residents of their drinking water, this would cut off supplies for firefighting and water-intensive industry, causing economic damage of $17.2–28.7 billion. Extensive reconstruction work at the Hayward Fault crossing includes a multi-sectioned tunnel structure to allow shear without collapse, this is to contain a section of water pipe with <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> and a slip joint.|$|E
2500|$|... 84–87 front {{suspension}} is a wider direct {{derivative of}} the Chevrolet Chevette and Pontiac T1000. It employs a double A-arm (or double wishbone) design common {{prior to the}} advent of struts, and has naturally good geometry. A drawback of this design, however, means that the car's front suspension has four <b>ball</b> <b>joints.</b> Nevertheless, the tie-rods allow toe-in/out adjustability. Minimal camber adjustments exist on 1984 to 1987 models without an after-market upgrade that replaces the upper <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> with slotted mounting points units. The joints have typical grease fittings for regular lubrication commonly found on pre-2000 autos.|$|E
50|$|A dual <b>ball</b> <b>joint</b> {{suspension}} uses {{a pair of}} arms, one in tension, one in compression, {{to replace}} a wishbone, in a MacPherson or SLA suspension. The outer end of each arm terminates in a <b>ball</b> <b>joint,</b> hence the name.|$|R
50|$|SLAs can be {{classified}} as short spindle, in which the upper <b>ball</b> <b>joint</b> on the spindle is inside the wheel, or long spindle, in which the spindle tucks around the tire and the upper <b>ball</b> <b>joint</b> sits above the tire.|$|R
50|$|To {{permit a}} high degree of freedom, the control {{cylinders}} resemble typical miniature pneumatic or hydraulic cylinders, but mount the back of the cylinder on a <b>ball</b> <b>joint</b> and threaded rod. This <b>ball</b> <b>joint</b> permits the cylinders to float freely inside the frame, such as when the wrist joint rotates and flexes.|$|R
2500|$|Also new, the {{double-wishbone}} front suspension had <b>ball</b> <b>joints,</b> {{upper and}} lower control arms, coil springs and shock absorbers above the upper control arms; as well as trailing struts on the lower control arms. The [...] "Magnum 500" [...] road wheels were now standard, but the new [...] "Machine" [...] 15x7inch slot-styled wheels were optional.|$|E
2500|$|However, before long, XK sales {{suffered}} from {{complaints about the}} durability on rough outback roads (due chiefly to collapsing front <b>ball</b> <b>joints,</b> and adjusting shims {{dropping out of the}} front suspension, both problems inducing some rather severe front camber); the car earned the unflattering nicknames [...] "Foul Can" [...] or [...] "Fault Can" [...] during this time.|$|E
2500|$|In 2003, Volks {{released}} a new 'skin type' (resin mixture) of the dolls called [...] "Pure Skin". Pure skin has a less plastic and more skin-like, translucent look and feel. The Super Dollfie body was improved with better poseability and less conspicuous <b>ball</b> <b>joints.</b> During the change, Volks gradually phased out production of [...] "old skin" [...] dolls {{in favor of}} pure skin.|$|E

2500|$|The new styling {{increased}} the trunk capacity of both coupes and sedans to [...] This increase was also partially achieved with a now-standard compact spare tire on a [...] wheel. A new frame lift jack replaced the bumper mounted model. A larger [...] fuel tank was standard equipment in sedans and coupes. Easy-roll radial tires, improved anti-corrosion measures, low friction <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> and larger front suspension bushings were also new for 1980.

2500|$|... often {{abbreviated}} SD, is a {{brand of}} ball-jointed doll, or BJD, made by the Japanese company Volks. They are made {{to be easy to}} customize and are primarily marketed to adult doll collectors and customizers. They are cast in polyurethane resin, a porcelain-like, hard, dense plastic. The most common standard models are about 60cm, or 24inches, tall, taller and heavier than most comparable Western dolls. They are designed in a style which is both realistic and influenced by anime, and most models are anatomically correct. The various body parts have <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> for articulation, and are strung together with a thick elastic cord.|$|E

2500|$|The 1970 Javelins {{featured}} a new front-end design {{with a wide}} [...] "twin-venturi" [...] front grille incorporating the headlamps and a longer hood. It also had a new rear end with full-width taillamps and a single center-mounted backup light. This was a one-year-only design. Side marker lights were now shared with several other AMC models. The exterior rear view mirror {{featured a}} new [...] "aero" [...] design {{and in some cases}} matched the car's body color. The three [...] "Big Bad" [...] exterior paints continued to be optional on the 1970 Javelins, but they now came with regular chrome bumpers.

2500|$|The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles {{franchise}} {{was arguably}} {{at the height}} of its popularity around the time that The Secret of the Ooze was released in theatres. A number of tie-ins were brought out alongside the release of the film. A new line of toys were introduced for the release of the film, including [...] "Movie Star" [...] toys of all four turtles, with the box art depicting stills from the film, as well as a cartoon rendition of the turtles gathered around a canister of ooze in the top right corner of the package. In contrast to the usual Turtles' figures, the film series figures were softer and more rubbery, to better reflect the look of the animatronic costumes used in the films. They also featured <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> at the neck, shoulders, and hips, and each figure came with a small, plastic canister with a sticker of [...] "Ooze" [...] wrapped around them. An official film adaptation was also released by Eastman and Laird.|$|E
50|$|The SY II {{received}} a revised front suspension {{to address a}} well-documented weakness in the front lower <b>ball</b> <b>joints.</b> Specifically, the original design had the <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> under constant tension, which resulted in some complete failures of the joint (causing the wheel to detach from the suspension and steering) and premature wear requiring lower control arm replacements after as little as 30000 km. With the new design, the lower <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> were now under compression, thus eliminating the premature wear issue.|$|E

30|$|Tilting {{mechanism}} The {{purpose of}} the tilting mechanism {{is to increase the}} number of DOFs of the calibration board. It allows calibration trajectories to be in three-dimensional space. Figure  2 c, d shows the tilting mechanism. To increase the number of DOFs while retaining sufficient stiffness of the calibration table, a 3 -DOF <b>ball</b> <b>joint</b> with high stiffness was used in the tilting mechanism. The calibration board can tilt in roll and pitch directions. A wing nut on the <b>ball</b> <b>joint</b> slider is used to fix the <b>ball</b> <b>joint</b> slider and aluminum extrusion (see Fig.  2 c, d). Therefore, the calibration broad rotates in roll and pitch direction via the tilting mechanism.|$|R

5000|$|Sealed <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> do {{not require}} {{lubrication}} as they are [...] "lubed for life". Formerly most <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> had grease fitting (sometimes called a grease zerk) and were designed for periodic addition of a lubricant, however almost all modern cars use sealed <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> to minimise maintenance requirements. The lubricant was usually a very high-viscosity lubricant. It is commonly believed that standard <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> will outlive sealed ones because eventually the seal will break, causing the joint to dry out and rust. [...] Additionally, the act of adding new lubricant pushes out old and dry lubricant, extending {{the life of the}} joint. This was supposed to be done at intervals of 1000 to 2000 miles on many vehicles, which is incompatible with the service interval on modern cars, often 12000 miles or more, and in any case was rarely attended to by owners, resulting in severe wear and possible ball joint failure, which can result in serious accidents. For this reason, almost all <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> on modern European or Far Eastern cars are the sealed for life type. New technology especially applied to the internal bearing design has allowed <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> to meet these longer service intervals. The special design's incorporate sintered metal bearings which replace OEM sealed polymer/plastic version and improved dust boot seal's that work much better at retaining the grease.|$|E
