50|$|Rearranging this {{equation}} {{gives you the}} pressure head p/&rho;g = y. Four basic devices for pressure measurement are a piezometer, manometer, differential manometer, <b>Bourdon</b> <b>gauge,</b> {{as well as an}} inclined manometer.|$|E

50|$|Many {{techniques}} {{have been developed}} for the measurement of pressure and vacuum. Instruments used to measure and display pressure in an integral unit are called pressure gauges or vacuum gauges. A manometer is a good example as it uses a column of liquid to both measure and indicate pressure. Likewise the widely used <b>Bourdon</b> <b>gauge</b> is a mechanical device which both measures and indicates, and is probably the best known type of gauge.|$|E
50|$|Maintaining {{depth in}} a {{submarine}} is a sophisticated task. The planesman was {{provided with a}} prominent depth gauge to monitor this, usually a circular <b>Bourdon</b> <b>gauge.</b> For precise maintenance at periscope depth an additional shallow-depth manometer, a transparent vertical pipe, would be provided too. With the development of active sonar, depth control became even more complex. Rather than maintaining a simple depth, the planesman must now keep the boat beneath a thermocline in order to hide from sonar. To this end, the helm position may also show external water thermometers and salinometers.|$|E
50|$|In {{the front}} and back views of a <b>Bourdon</b> <b>gauge</b> on the right, applied {{pressure}} at the bottom fitting reduces the curl on the flattened pipe proportionally to pressure. This moves the free end of the tube which is linked to the pointer. The instrument would be calibrated against a manometer, which would be the calibration standard. For measurement of indirect quantities of pressure per unit area, the calibration uncertainty would be dependent on the density of the manometer fluid, and the means of measuring the height difference. From this other units such as pounds per square inch could be inferred and marked on the scale.|$|E
50|$|Glycerol {{is used as}} fill for {{pressure}} gauges to dampen vibration. External vibrations, from compressors, engines, pumps, etc., produce harmonic vibrations within <b>Bourdon</b> <b>gauges</b> that can cause the needle to move excessively, giving inaccurate readings. The excessive swinging of the needle can also damage internal gears or other components, causing premature wear. Glycerol, when poured into a gauge to replace the air space, reduces the harmonic vibrations that are transmitted to the needle, increasing the lifetime and reliability of the gauge.|$|R

Electronic devices {{have been subject to}} failure due to the effect on components of cryogenic temperatures. The solution: An automatic liquid nitrogen dispensing system that uses gas filled probes, driving <b>Bourdon</b> tube <b>gauges</b> equipped with microswitches that, through a relay, control a solenoid valve in the liquid nitrogen storage line...|$|R
50|$|The Bourdon {{pressure}} gauge uses {{the principle that}} a flattened tube tends to straighten or regain its circular form in cross-section when pressurized. Although this change in cross-section may be hardly noticeable, and thus involving moderate stresses within the elastic range of easily workable materials, the strain of the material of the tube is magnified by forming the tube into a C shape or even a helix, such that the entire tube tends to straighten out or uncoil, elastically, as it is pressurized. Eugene Bourdon patented his gauge in France in 1849, and it was widely adopted because of its superior sensitivity, linearity, and accuracy; Edward Ashcroft purchased Bourdon's American patent rights in 1852 and became a major manufacturer of gauges. Also in 1849, Bernard Schaeffer in Magdeburg, Germany patented a successful diaphragm (see below) {{pressure gauge}}, which, together with the <b>Bourdon</b> <b>gauge,</b> revolutionized pressure measurement in industry. But in 1875 after Bourdon's patents expired, his company Schaeffer and Budenberg also manufactured Bourdon tube gauges.|$|E
40|$|Bourdon tube is a {{mechanical}} type pressure sensor and the <b>bourdon</b> <b>gauge</b> measures gauge pressure {{of a process}} pipe line or a process tank. But it is a local indicator and special costlier techniques are required to transmit the reading of <b>bourdon</b> <b>gauge</b> to a remote distance. In the present paper, a very simple inductive pick-up type technique has been developed to transmit the reading of <b>bourdon</b> <b>gauge</b> to a remote distance {{in the form of}} 1 - 5 Volt D. C. signal. This signal has been optically isolated to design a PC based pressure indicator using Labtech Note Book Pro software.

40|$|Dissociation {{pressures}} of tellurium over liquid and solid nickel telluride solutions have been {{measured with a}} silica <b>Bourdon</b> <b>gauge</b> at compositions corresponding to NiTe 1. 5, NiTe 1. 7, NiTe 1. 9, NiTe 2. 0, and NiTe 9 at temperatures up to 780 °. Modifications of the manometric technique are described which permit accuracies of 0. 1 mm pressure and 0. 1 ° at high temperatures with corrosive substances where the pressure is sensitive to impurities or to composition changes. The results, together with data on the vapor pressure of pure tellurium, define the partial molal free energies and entropies of tellurium and, together with direct eutectic temperature measurement, delineate features of the phase diagram for compositions with more than 60 atomic percent tellurium...|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} locomotives did {{not show}} the pressure of steam in the boiler, but {{it was possible to}} estimate this by the position of the safety valve arm which often extended onto the firebox back plate; gradations marked on the spring column gave a rough indication of the actual pressure. The promoters of the Rainhill trials urged that each contender have a proper mechanism for reading the boiler pressure, and Stephenson devised a nine-foot vertical tube of mercury with a sight-glass at the top, mounted alongside the chimney, for his Rocket. The <b>Bourdon</b> tube <b>gauge,</b> in which the pressure straightens an oval-section coiled tube of brass or bronze connected to a pointer, was introduced in 1849 and quickly gained acceptance, and is still used today. Some locomotives have an additional pressure gauge in the steam chest. This helps the driver avoid wheel-slip at startup, by warning if the regulator opening is too great.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bourdon</b> tubes measure <b>gauge</b> pressure, {{relative}} to ambient atmospheric pressure, {{as opposed to}} absolute pressure; vacuum is sensed as a reverse motion. Some aneroid barometers use Bourdon tubes closed at both ends (but most use diaphragms or capsules, see below). When the measured pressure is rapidly pulsing, such as when the gauge is near a reciprocating pump, an orifice restriction in the connecting pipe is frequently used to avoid unnecessary wear on the gears and provide an average reading; when the whole gauge is subject to mechanical vibration, the entire case including the pointer and indicator card can be filled with an oil or glycerin. Tapping {{on the face of}} the gauge is not recommended as it will tend to falsify actual readings initially presented by the <b>gauge.</b> The <b>Bourdon</b> tube is separate from the face of the gauge and thus has no effect on the actual reading of pressure. Typical high-quality modern gauges provide an accuracy of ±2% of span, and a special high-precision gauge can be as accurate as 0.1% of full scale.|$|R
50|$|The cell uses {{conventional}} piston and cylinder arrangement. The piston {{is placed}} in a thin elastic diaphragm. The piston doesn't actually {{come in contact with}} the load cell. Mechanical stops are placed to prevent over strain of the diaphragm when the loads exceed certain limit. The load cell is completely filled with oil. When the load is applied on the piston, the movement of the piston and the diaphragm results in an increase of oil pressure. This pressure is then transmitted to a hydraulic pressure gauge via a high pressure hose. The <b>gauge's</b> <b>Bourdon</b> tube senses the pressure and registers it on the dial. Because this sensor has no electrical components, it is ideal for use in hazardous areas. Typical hydraulic load cell applications include tank, bin, and hopper weighing. By example, a hydraulic load cell is immune to transient voltages (lightning) so these type of load cells might be a more effective device in outdoor environments. This technology is more expensive than other types of load cells. It is a more costly technology and thus cannot effectively compete on a cost of purchase basis.|$|R
40|$|The optical {{absorbance}} of {{the vapor}} phase over various In-Se compositions between 33. 3 - 60. 99 at. % Se and 673 - 1418 K was measured {{and used to}} obtain the partial pressures of Se 2 (g) and In 2 Se(g). The results are in agreement with silica <b>Bourdon</b> <b>gauge</b> measurements for compositions between 50 - 61 at. %, but significantly higher than those from Knudsen cell and simultaneous Knudsen-torsion cell measurements. It is found that 60. 99 at. % Se lies outside the sesquiselenide homogeneity range and 59. 98 at. % Se lies inside and is the congruently melting composition. The Gibbs energy of formation of the liquid from its pure liquid elements between 1000 - 1300 K is essentially independent of temperature and falls between - 36 to - 38 kJ per g atomic weight for 50 and 56 % Se at 1200 and 1300 K...|$|E
40|$|It is {{the opinion}} of this discusser that the program upon which this paper is based has high {{potential}} for meaningful and impor-tant results, {{and it is to}} be hoped that the author and his associ-ates will be able to persevere until that goal is reached. The data presented in this paper are unconvincing for the fol-lowing reasons. While the calculated standard deviation is very creditable, the point scatter is in general rather too large to permit confident prediction of trends. The extreme variation of cavitation number with venturi throat Reynolds ' number for sonic initiation shown in Fig. 2 is difficult to reconcile with Fig. 7 where cavitation number for visible initiation appears to be un-affected by variation in throat velocity. There is a likelihood that the pressure produced by the centrifugal pump varies from instant to instant above and below the mean measured by a <b>bourdon</b> <b>gauge</b> or fluid manometer.

Budenberg, The Schäffer & Budenberg Machinery & Boiler Fittings Company, in the altstadt of the Prussian town of Magdeburg Germany. They began manufacturing pressure gauges and all items relating the steam industry. In 1858 they moved to purpose built premises on Schoenebecker Strasse in the suburb of Buckau.

40|$|The varus-ualgus {{instability}} {{of the knee}} joint is mainly due to ruptured or lax collateral ligaments. The purpose {{of this investigation was}} to study the influence of the uarus-valgus instability on the contact pressures of the femoro-tibial joint. Six fresh knee specimens of human cadavers were tested to measure the contact pressure on the tibia plateau of the knee joint at varus or valgus alignment under various loads and at full extension. Pressure transducers and <b>Bourdon</b> tube pressure <b>gauges</b> were used simultaneously for recording pressure. At neutral alignment of the knee with the menisci intact, the peak pressure increased linearly with forces up to 4 MPa. With increasing varus alignment, the peak contact pressure on the medial plateau not covered by the menisci increased up to a maximum of 7. 3 MPa at 5 " varus, and at 5 " valgus, the peak pressure on the lateral plateau was 7. 8 MPa. After total meniscectomy, the contact pressure increased up to a maximum of 7. 4 M P a at a force of 2700 N.
