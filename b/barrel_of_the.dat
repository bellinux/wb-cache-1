5|$|The cover artwork is {{modified}} from {{an existing}} {{photograph of the}} Inner <b>Barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Compact Muon Solenoid's Silicon Tracker, a particle physics experiment built on the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. A very faint reflection of Vic Rattlehead {{can be seen in}} the object's center. A 3D cover is featured on the special edition.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{started in}} November 1996, with the moving of {{underground}} pipes and wires around the station areas. In August 1997, work {{started at the}} depot, and in September, COMET started the first mainline work. In October and November, the two tunnel boring machines (TBM), christened Liva and Bette, were delivered. They started boring each <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tunnel from Islands Brygge in February 1998. The same month, the Public Transport Authority gave the necessary permits to operate a driverless metro. The section between Fasanvej and Frederiksberg is a former S-train line, and was last operated as such on 20 June 1998.|$|E

5|$|In 1942, {{trying to}} solve the problem of lack of a {{suitable}} mobile 152mm howitzer, the design bureau headed by F. F. Petrov started to work privately on a new howitzer, based on the carriage of the M-30 and the <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> M-10 (which was fitted with a muzzle brake in order to reduce the recoil and thus prevent damage to the lighter carriage). The approach allowed production to begin on the new howitzer almost immediately from the stockpile of parts for both earlier guns. Given the war situation and shortages of artillery, this solution was both elegant and expedient.|$|E
5|$|The D-1 {{howitzer}} {{was essentially}} {{a combination of the}} <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 152-mm howitzer model 1938 (M-10) on the carriage of the 122-mm howitzer M1938 (M-30). Since the new carriage was lighter than that of the M-10, the barrel was fitted with a massive double-baffle muzzle brake DT-3 to soften the shock of recoil. The breech block was of interrupted screw type, the recoil system consisted of a hydraulic buffer and a hydro-pneumatic recuperator. The separately loaded ammunition included a variety of shells and eight different propellant charges in cartridges.|$|E
5|$|These {{guns are}} {{air-cooled}} {{and use a}} gas blow-back recoil system. Unlike other automatic guns employed during World War II, the <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 20mm Oerlikon gun does not recoil; the breechblock is never locked against the breech and is actually moving forward when the gun fires. This weapon lacks a counter-recoil brake, as {{the force of the}} counter-recoil is checked by recoil from the firing of the next round of ammunition.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chinese cannon are {{on display}} at Firepower - The Royal Artillery Museum at Woolwich. <b>The</b> {{remaining}} portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> only remaining cascabel, weighing 358 oz (10kg), is stored in a vault maintained by 15 Regiment Royal Logistic Corps at MoD Donnington. It can only be removed under armed guard. It is estimated that approximately 80 to 85 more VCs could be cast from this source.|$|R

50|$|Basing {{their new}} line <b>of</b> weapons on <b>the</b> basic Charter Arms design, {{the new company}} has made a few {{improvements}} such as <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> a one-piece <b>barrel</b> and front sight. <b>The</b> one-piece <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new models are machined with eight grooves instead of six for higher velocity, flatter trajectory and better accuracy. The new models feature a completely blocked hammer system so that the gun cannot fire unless the trigger is held in full rear position.|$|R

5|$|This is {{a variant}} of the special purpose weapon adopted by USSOCOM. The program, which led to both the Mk 46 and Mk 48, was headed by the US Naval Special Warfare Command (NAVSPECWAR). Like the SPW, the barrel {{changing}} handle, magazine insertion well, and vehicle mounting lugs have been removed to save weight. However, the Mk 46 retains the standard M249 plastic buttstock instead of the collapsible buttstock used on the SPW. The Picatinny rail forearm differs slightly from the SPW. The Mk 46 has the option of using the lighter SPW barrel or a thicker, fluted <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same length.|$|E
25|$|The 105mm Howitzer M3 was a U.S. light {{howitzer}} {{designed for}} use by airborne troops. The gun utilized the <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 105 mm Howitzer M2, shortened and fitted to a slightly modified split trail carriage of the 75 mm pack howitzer.|$|E

2500|$|There {{were two}} main series <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 120/45 guns produced. [...] <b>The</b> first series <b>of</b> 76 guns were built between 1897-1905 at the Obhukov factory. During the Russo-Japanese war a number <b>of</b> <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 152/45 guns burst in action and a {{strengthened}} series of 152/45 and 120/45 guns were ordered. [...] 34 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second series <b>of</b> strengthened guns were built between 1905-1915 at the Obhukov factory. [...] Between 1914-1916 production {{switched to the}} Perm factory and a further 18 strengthened guns were produced there.|$|R
25|$|The <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> M-30 was of {{built-up}} {{construction and}} consisted of a liner, jacket and breech. The breechblock was of interrupted screw type, with forced cartridge case extraction. The gun was equipped with a hydraulic recoil buffer and hydropneumatic recuperator. A panoramic sight was used for both indirect and direct fire.|$|E
25|$|Late in 1940, the Ordnance Corps started {{another project}} - an {{anti-tank}} gun {{based on the}} 3 inch anti-aircraft gun T9. The <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> T9 was combined with breech, recoil system and carriage, all adapted from the 105 mm howitzer M2. The pilot of the weapon, named 3inch Gun T10, was ready by September 1941. Although the subsequent testing revealed minor problems, {{it was clear that}} the gun, eventually standardized as M5 on carriage M1, presented major performance improvement over existing designs.|$|E
25|$|Construction {{started in}} November 1996, with the moving of {{underground}} pipes and wires around the station areas. In August 1997, work commenced at the depot, and in September, COMET started the first mainline construction work. In October and November, the two tunnel boring machines (TMB), christened Liva and Bette, were delivered. They started digging each <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tunnel from Islands Brygge in February 1998.

The section between Fasanvej and Frederiksberg is a former S-train line, and was last operated as such on 20 June 1998.|$|E
25|$|Both Kazi Amar Singh Thapa and Ranajor Singh Thapa {{were thus}} hemmed in and looking down <b>the</b> <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British guns when Bam Shah’s letter arrived, announcing <b>the</b> fall <b>of</b> Almora. Although <b>the</b> old {{commander}} was still reluctant to surrender, Kazi Amar Singh Thapa at last saw <b>the</b> hopelessness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> situation and, compelled by circumstances and the British guns, surrendered with honour for both himself and Ranajor Singh. The Nepalese {{positions in the}} Far West were {{turned over to the}} British on 15 May 1815.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cannon in {{question}} are stationed outside the Officers' Mess at the Royal Artillery Barracks at Woolwich. <b>The</b> remaining portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> only remaining cascabel, weighing 10kilograms (385oz), {{is stored in}} a vault maintained by 15 Regiment Royal Logistic Corps at MoD Donnington. It can only be removed under armed guard. It is estimated that approximately 80 to 85 more VCs could be cast from this source. A single company of jewellers, Hancocks of London, {{has been responsible for}} <b>the</b> production <b>of</b> every VC.|$|R
25|$|It was {{reported}} that on 2 September 2017, <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> howitzers was damaged while firing locally made ammunition during calibration trials.|$|R
25|$|The Hamada pistol is a {{blowback}} {{pistol and}} functionally {{a copy of}} the Browning Model 1910. The most significant design difference between the Hamada pistol and Browning Model 1910 is the replacement of the interrupter lugs used to hold the <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Browning Model 1910 with a dovetail joint. The frame plate lock design and striker assembly were also modified and awarded patents in 1943. The Hamada pistol maintained high quality throughout its production, with the bluing done to a high standard. The safety, rear frame plate, and extractor were heat tempered to a reddish brown and the barrel, striker, and firing mechanism were brightly polished.|$|E
25|$|The {{design of}} {{the action of the}} weapon {{combined}} functions of several different machine guns of the same era. The action consisted of a sliding breech block connected to a rotary crank, which in turn was operated by an off-set connecting rod, driven by the piston rod of the weapon. The feeding system was also unconventional, utilizing a box magazine mounted {{on the left side of}} the gun, holding 10 stripper clips with five rounds each. The stripper clips were fed one at a time through the gun from left to right where the empty clips were ejected (japanese type 11 light machine gun utilised similar feature). It used the rear sight and the <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Krag–Jørgensen rifle.|$|E
25|$|To emplace the grafts of {{autologous}} fat-tissue, doctors J. Newman and J. Levin {{designed a}} lipo-injector gun with a gear-driven plunger, which allowed the even injection of autologous fat-tissue {{to the desired}} recipient sites. The control afforded by the lipo-injector gun assisted the plastic surgeon in controlling excessive pressure to the fat in the <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> syringe, thus avoiding over-filling the recipient site. The later-design lipo-injector gun featured a ratchet-gear operation that afforded the surgeon greater control in accurately emplacing grafts of autologous fat to the recipient site; a trigger action injected 0.1cm3 of filler. Since 1989, most non-surgical, fat-graft augmentation of the breast features the emplacement of adipocyte fat outside the breast parenchymaup to 300ml of fatin three equal measures (aliquots), is emplaced to the subpectoral space and to the intrapectoral space of the pectoralis major muscle, and the submammary space, to achieve a breast outcome of natural appearance and contour.|$|E
5|$|She {{was next}} seen by Navy divers, the same year, lying upside {{down with her}} bow on <b>the</b> rim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{underwater}} bomb crater and stern angled toward the center. There was no sign <b>of</b> <b>the</b> superstructure or the big guns. The first diver to reach Arkansas sank up to his armpits in radioactive mud. When National Park Service divers returned in 1989 and 1990, the bottom was again firm-packed sand, and the mud was gone. They {{were able to see}} <b>the</b> <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forward guns, which had not been visible in 1946.|$|R
2500|$|In late 1812 {{or early}} 1813, Hibernia {{captured}} a Swedish schooner carrying 900 <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> flour. <b>The</b> American privateer Orders in Council captured the schooner from Hibernias prize crew. [...] in turn captured the schooner from the Americans, {{and sent her}} into Antigua.|$|R
50|$|Following <b>the</b> {{emergence}} <b>of</b> small fast attack craft during World War I, it {{was decided}} that the British Royal Navy Dockyards were vulnerable to attack by motor torpedo boats which had the speed to evade the heavy coast defence guns which defended them. In 1925, a design was adopted for a twin barrelled weapon capable of sustained semi-automatic fire. Both <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weapon could be fired singly or they could be combined. The pedestal mounting and the gun crew were enclosed to the front, sides and top in a reinforced-steel barbette.|$|R
25|$|The French Army {{preferred}} bag {{charges for}} its ammunition because the brass cartridge cases {{used by the}} Mle 1915 were expensive to produce, both in money and {{in the amount of}} brass required. This became a real problem during the war given the vast number of shells expended and Schneider was asked to redesign the gun to use a deBange obdurator and allow it to use bagged powder. Schneider agreed and adapted the breech of the Canon de 155mm GPF to fit the <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mle 1915, but this took quite a bit of time due to the press of existing work and the new Mle 1917 howitzer didn't enter service until late 1916. The main difference between the Mle 1915 and 1917 was in the breech. Many guns had their loading trays removed because it slowed down the rate of fire; a portable shell tray was used instead by the loaders.|$|E
25|$|On August 7, 1970, Jonathan Jackson, {{a heavily}} armed, 17-year-old African-American high-school student, gained {{control over a}} {{courtroom}} in Marin County, California. Once in the courtroom, Jackson armed the black defendants and took Judge Harold Haley, the prosecutor, and three female jurors as hostages. As Jackson transported the hostages and two black convicts away from the courtroom, the police began shooting at the vehicle. The judge and the three black men {{were killed in the}} melee; one of the jurors and the prosecutor were injured. Although the judge {{was shot in the head}} with a blast from the shotgun, he also suffered a chest wound from a bullet that may have been fired from outside the van. Evidence during the trial showed, however, that either could have been fatal. The firearms which Jackson used in the attack, including the shotgun used to kill Judge Haley, had been purchased by Davis two days prior, and the <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shotgun had been sawn off. Davis was found to have been corresponding with one of the inmates involved.|$|E
25|$|This {{challenge}} {{was an early}} start for the 4 remaining finalists Bill, Sophie, Fenton and David. It began at the fish markets in Sydney's Chinatown where Ben explained the art of finding a fresh fish. Each finalist asked around to find out {{as much information as}} they could about a fish they had never cooked before. Fenton was so impressed with the filleting of the salmon that he wanted to meet the man responsible. Turned out it was the No. 1 salmon filleter in NSW. At the docks, 4 BBQ's were set up and each contestant was given 60 seconds to look down the <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> camera and talk about how they would prepare this fish, as though they were hosting a show. This was a test to see how much of the information they could retain and deliver to an audience in a simple to understand language. A Teppanyaki Chef came out and gave the finalists a crash course in the ancient Japanese technique. For the final challenge the remaining 4 were taken to a Teppanyaki restaurant and asked to cook a meal for the judges using the technique. Each contestant was judged on the ability to talk and cook at the same time while using techniques that they were all unfamiliar with. The judges then decided they would send one home who they thought was 'throwing' the contest.|$|E
5|$|The three {{travel to}} Florida, but {{find that the}} Lake has dried up {{and is now a}} swamp filled with gold from the sunken {{treasure}} fleet last seen in Act I. There, they destroy a Circle base in the swamp. Cooper finds and attempts to capture Beaumont, but Beaumont commands two wolves to attack him. Cooper shoots one of them with his pistol, but the other kills him. Amelia, now wanting to avenge Cooper, learns from the local Seminoles that there is an Inca city in Pacamayo Valley where several <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fountain's water have been stored.|$|R
25|$|A okshoofd (earlier spelling: oxhoofd) was a {{measurement}} <b>of</b> volume representing <b>the</b> volume {{held by a}} large <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> wine. <b>The</b> measurement was also used for vinegar, tobacco and sugar. The measurement is still used by businesses in the wine and spirits trade. There were six ankers in an okshoofd.|$|R
50|$|A sub-caliber round is a round <b>the</b> {{diameter}} <b>of</b> {{which is}} {{inferior to the}} barrel diameter. An expendable sabot is used to expand the diameter to <b>the</b> full <b>barrel</b> width <b>of</b> <b>the</b> firing gun.|$|R
