In the first, ammonia bubbles up through the brine and is absorbed by it. In the second, carbon dioxide bubbles up through the ammoniated brine, and sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) precipitates out of the solution.

The ammonia (NH3) buffers the solution at a basic pH; without the ammonia, a hydrochloric acid byproduct would render the solution acidic, and arrest the precipitation.|$|E

40|$|The {{relations}} between smoking parameters and {{the characteristics of}} salmon raw material were investigated with respect to yield, colour, flesh content of phenol and salt, and sensory properties. The fish studied were ocean ranched salmon harvested in Iceland in July 1998 and farmed salmon from Norway slaughtered in October 1998 and April 1999. Seven treatments were applied on fresh or frozen raw material combining dry or <b>brine</b> <b>salting</b> with cold smoking at 20 or 30 C. Electrostatic smoking was tested on dry-salted salmon fillets. The results show a lower yield after filleting and trimming with ocean ranched fish. Although freezing {{had little effect on}} yield, total loss was slightly greater, especially for fish with low fat content. Sensory differences were also apparent. The <b>brine</b> <b>salting</b> technique resulted in lower losses. Fish with higher fat content gave a better yield after processing, although careful control of the smoking procedure was required (especially at 30 C) to avoid a case-hardening effect. With <b>brine</b> <b>salting,</b> salt uptake was higher for smaller, leaner fish. The phenol content of flesh depended on the technique and/or smoking temperature used, regardless of the fish studied. However, for a smoking temperature of 30 C, the flesh of smaller, leaner fish showed a higher phenol level. Smoking conditions and preliminary treatment such as freezing produced similar differences in sensory characteristics, regardless o...|$|R
40|$|Cod salting is a {{long process}} on which mass transfer, {{basically}} salt and water, occurs by diffusion. This work analyses and compares cod salting kinetics by using different <b>salting</b> techniques: <b>brine</b> <b>salting,</b> with and without applying a vacuum pulse and dry salting with and without pressure. The results revealed that mass transfer kinetics during cod salting process seemed {{to be affected by}} the salting method applied. Osmotic mechanism and diffusion transport of salt can be enhanced during vacuum pulsed <b>brine</b> <b>salting,</b> also leading to a lower water loss and higher yield. During dry salting, the coupling of osmotic mechanism and suctioning effect due to dry salt crystals (moreover in the case of pressured dry salting) favoured water losses and limited salt gain.

50|$|Early {{methods of}} <b>brine</b> <b>salt</b> {{production}} involved digging large pits {{in the earth}} (other parts of China used the evaporation method). Later methods involved very innovative drilling and retrieval methods. An unexpected byproduct of the drilling and resulting wells was natural gas.

The salt Zigong produced was very rich in taste and was served to the Emperor of China as a tribute. The people of Zigong believe its taste to be superior to the popular French sea salts such as Fleur de sel.|$|E
50|$|The {{first stage}} is {{to pick the}} walnuts whilst they are still green and before the shells have set. Most recipes say that late June is about {{the best time to}} pick them. The soft walnuts are then soaked in <b>brine</b> (<b>salt</b> water) for at least ten days. The walnuts are then drained and left to dry in the air. Soaking the walnuts in brine causes a {{chemical}} reaction to take place and the walnuts turn dark brown to black in colour when exposed to sunlight. The now-black walnuts are then placed into jars and a pickling solution poured over them. This can vary from a straightforward pickling vinegar to a solution containing spices and sugar. The walnuts are sealed and then left in the jars for anywhere between five days and eight weeks depending on which recipe is followed.|$|E
5000|$|The {{two main}} {{processing}} techniques for salmon jerky are wet-brining and dry salting. In {{both cases the}} salmon is trimmed into narrow slices and then stored cold for less than one day. After being skinned and frozen, if the fish is to undergo the brining method it will require an additional step in which the salmon is left soaking in wet <b>brine</b> (<b>salt</b> solution) for one hour. It is then removed and the excess water is discarded. After this, in both the wet-brining and dry salting method, ingredients such as non-iodized salt, potato starch, or light brown sugar are added. [...] In some smoked salmon jerky products preservatives may also be added to extend the shelf life of the final product. The salmon is then minced with the additives and reformed into thin strips that will be smoked for twenty hours. Between the brining and salting methods for smoked salmon jerky the brining method {{has been found to}} leave the salmon more tender with up to double the moisture content of salted jerky. The salmon jerky that undergoes the dry salting method has a tougher texture due to the lower moisture content and water activity. Both forms of salmon jerky still have a much lower moisture content than is found in raw salmon.|$|E

50|$|Typically, large ovens {{are used}} for the {{annealing}} process. The inside of the oven {{is large enough to}} place the workpiece in a position to receive maximum exposure to the circulating heated air. For high volume process annealing, gas fired conveyor furnaces are often used. For large workpieces or high quantity parts, car-bottom furnaces are used so workers can easily move the parts in and out. Once the annealing process is successfully completed, workpieces are sometimes left in the oven so the parts cool in a controllable way. While some workpieces are left in the oven to cool in a controlled fashion, other materials and alloys are removed from the oven. Once removed from the oven, the workpieces are often quickly cooled off in a process known as quench hardening. Typical methods of quench hardening materials involve media such as air, water, oil, or salt. Salt is used as a medium for quenching usually in the form of <b>brine</b> (<b>salt</b> water). Brine provides faster cooling rates than water. This is because when an object is quenched in water air bubbles form {{on the surface of the}} object reducing the surface area the water is in contact with. The salt in the brine reduces the formation of air bubbles on the object's surface, meaning there is a larger surface area of the object in contact with the water, providing faster cooling rates. Quench hardening is generally applicable to some ferrous alloys, but not copper alloys.|$|E

40|$|On Earth, sea ice {{is rich in}} <b>brine,</b> <b>salt,</b> and gas {{inclusions}} {{that form}} through capturing of seawater during ice formation. Cooling of the ice over time leads to sequential freezing of captured sea-water, precipitation of salts, exsolution of gases, and formation of brine channels and pockets. Distribution and composition of brines in sea ice depend on the rate of ice formation, vertical temperature gradient, {{and the age of}} the ice. With aging, the abundance of brine pockets decreases through downward migration. De- spite low temperatures and elevated salinities, brines in sea ice provide a habitat for photosynthetic and chemosynthetic organisms. On Europa, brine pockets and channels could exist in the icy shell that may be from a few km to a few tens of km thick and is probably underlain by a water ocean. If the icy shell is relatively thick, convection could develop, affecting the temperature pattern in the ice. To predict the distribution and chemistry of brine pockets in the icy shell we have combined numerical models of the temperature distribution within a convecting shell, a model for oceanic chemistry, and a model for freezing of Europan oceanic water.

These membranes were carbonized {{to form the}} hybrid carbon-silica structures under inert conditions in vacuum and nitrogen. The effects of calcination conditions on the structure-property relationship of the carbon-silica xerogels were elucidated, and the membrane performances were systematically studied using brackish (1  wt%) to brine (15  wt%) feed concentrations of sodium chloride solution and feed temperatures (25 – 60  °C) under pervaporation process. Vacuum calcined (CS-Vc) membrane produced a slightly more mesoporous matrix and higher carbon yield than the nitrogen calcined (CS-N) membrane, and hence, led to comparatively superior desalination performance.
