5|$|During {{the baby}} boom, DeLee's {{prophylactic}} forceps approach found new life. Busy physicians were often eager to adopt this systematic approach to anesthetized delivery because its efficiency {{allowed them to}} care for more patients. By 1968, nearly 40% of the <b>babies</b> <b>born</b> in U.S. hospitals were delivered with forceps. The use of episiotomies also continued to increase throughout DeLee's career and after his death. By the 1970s, 90% of delivering women received an episiotomy. A 1983 study did not support good outcomes with this practice, and by the year 2000, only 20 percent of U.S. deliveries involved an episiotomy.|$|E

25|$|There is {{no sharp}} limit of development, age, or weight at which humans {{automatically}} become viable.

It is rare for a baby weighing less than 500g (17.6ounces) to survive. A baby's chances for survival increases 3-4% per day between 23 and 24 weeks of gestation and about 2-3% per day between 24 and 26 weeks of gestation. After 26 weeks the rate of survival increases at a much slower rate because survival is high already.|$|E
