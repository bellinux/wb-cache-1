5|$|As medical {{professionals}} become better {{informed about the}} interdependent relationship <b>between</b> <b>physical,</b> emotional, social, and spiritual pain, and the demonstrated benefit to physical pain from alleviation of these other forms of suffering, they may be inclined to question the patient and family about interpersonal relationships.

But during the expedition, a more typical wake-up time was actually between 06:00 and 07:00 UTC. The crew's sleep habits were sometimes shifted to accommodate the schedules of visiting shuttles or resupply vehicles.|$|E

However, those claims were rejected by Paul Langevin, André Metz and others. Biological organisms consist of physical processes, so {{there is no reason to}} assume that they are not subject to relativistic effects like time dilation.|$|E

25|$|A {{strategy}} for addressing this {{problem has been}} suggested; {{the idea is to}} study the boundary amplitude, namely a path integral over a finite space-time region, seen {{as a function of the}} boundary value of the field. In conventional quantum field theory, this boundary amplitude is well–defined and codes the physical information of the theory; it does so in quantum gravity as well, but in a fully background–independent manner. A generally covariant definition of -point functions can then be based on the idea that the distance <b>between</b> <b>physical</b> points –arguments of the -point function is determined by the state of the gravitational field on the boundary of the spacetime region considered.|$|E
25|$|After the 1949 revolution, the Institute of Geography {{under the}} aegis of the Chinese Academy of Sciences became {{responsible}} for official cartography and emulated the Soviet model of geography throughout the 1950s. With its emphasis on fieldwork, sound knowledge of the physical environment and the interrelation <b>between</b> <b>physical</b> and economic geography, the Russian influence counterbalanced the many pre-liberation Western-trained Chinese geography specialists who were more interested in the historical and culture aspects of cartography. As a consequence, China's main geographical journal, the Dili Xuebao (地理学报） featured many articles by Soviet geographers. As Soviet influence waned in the 1960s, geographic activity continued as part of the process of modernisation until it came to a stop with the 1967 Cultural Revolution.|$|E

A nonsignificant direct relationship <b>between</b> chronic <b>physical</b> conditions and social support suggests that chronic illness does not affect support independent of domestic and economic strains.

25|$|Racism {{rests on}} two basic assumptions: that a {{correlation}} exists <b>between</b> <b>physical</b> characteristics and moral qualities; that mankind is divisible into superior and inferior stocks.

The Ancient Hebrews, in referring to all who were not Hebrews as Gentiles, were indulging in ethnocentrism, not in racism....

25|$|In China, {{psychological}} understanding {{grew from}} the philosophical works of Laozi and Confucius, and later from the doctrines of Buddhism. This {{body of knowledge}} involves insights drawn from introspection and observation, as well as techniques for focused thinking and acting. It frames the universe as a division of, and interaction <b>between,</b> <b>physical</b> reality and mental reality, {{with an emphasis on}} purifying the mind in order to increase virtue and power. An ancient text known as The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine identifies the brain as the nexus of wisdom and sensation, includes theories of personality based on yin–yang balance, and analyzes mental disorder in terms of physiological and social disequilibria. Chinese scholarship focused on the brain advanced in the Qing Dynasty with the work of Western-educated Fang Yizhi (1611–1671), Liu Zhi (1660–1730), and Wang Qingren (1768–1831). Wang Qingren emphasized the importance of the brain as the center of the nervous system, linked mental disorder with brain diseases, investigated the causes of dreams and insomnia, and advanced a theory of hemispheric lateralization in brain function.|$|E

500|$|Madhayamaka Buddhism goes even further, finding {{fault with}} the monist view of physicalist philosophies of mind {{as well in}} that these {{generally}} posit matter and energy as the fundamental substance of reality. [...] Nonetheless, this {{does not imply that}} the cartesian dualist view is correct, rather Madhyamaka regards as error any affirming view of a fundamental substance to reality.In denying the independent self-existence of all the phenomena that make up the world of our experience, the Madhyamaka view departs from both the substance dualism of Descartes and the substance monism—namely, physicalism—that is characteristic of modern science. The physicalism propounded by many contemporary scientists seems to assert that the real world is composed of physical things-in-themselves, while all mental phenomena are regarded as mere appearances, devoid of any reality in and of themselves. Much is made of this difference between appearances and reality.Indeed, physicalism or the idea that matter is the only fundamental substance of reality is explicitly rejected by Buddhism.In the Madhyamaka view, mental events are no more or less real than physical events. In terms of our common-sense experience, differences of kind do exist <b>between</b> <b>physical</b> and mental phenomena. While the former commonly have mass, location, velocity, shape, size, and numerous other physical attributes, these are not generally characteristic of mental phenomena. For example, we do not commonly conceive of the feeling of affection for another person as having mass or location. These physical attributes are no more appropriate to other mental events such as sadness, a recalled image from one’s childhood, the visual perception of a rose, or consciousness of any sort. Mental phenomena are, therefore, not regarded as being physical, {{for the simple reason that}} they lack many of the attributes that are uniquely characteristic of physical phenomena. Thus, Buddhism has never adopted the physicalist principle that regards only physical things as real.|$|E

40|$|Childhood {{physical}} abuse {{has been studied}} for almost 50 years now, resulting in rich knowledge about the immediate and long-term effects on development. For the most part, {{research has focused on}} understanding childhood {{physical abuse}} as a risk factor for psychopathology, including depression and antisocial behaviors, as such outcomes have clear consequences and costs for society as a whole. However, outcomes related to general social functioning and, more specifically, intimate relationship functioning are also important to study as they may contribute to perpetuation of violence. Children with histories of physical abuse {{are more likely to have}} difficulties with multiple aspects of interpersonal functioning, including how they relate to their parents and peers, how they perceive their social worlds, and how they are perceived by others. Given that preadolescence and adolescence are developmental periods when social relationships are particularly important, examining the role of interpersonal factors during these times may provide new insight into understanding the link <b>between</b> childhood <b>physical</b> abuse and later problems in peer relations. As such, the present study hypothesizes that various aspects of interpersonal functioning in preadolescence and adolescence within the domains of attachment, social behavior, social cognition, and social status, mediate the relationship <b>between</b> childhood <b>physical</b> abuse and adolescent social functioning in general and with romantic partners more specifically. Seventy-five adolescents with a history of childhood physical abuse on the New York City Register and 78 matched classmate controls were studied at age 10. 5 years and 16. 5 years. During both phases, data were collected from the subjects, teachers, parents, and peers. Problematic attachment to parents, aggression, social misperception, and peer rejection status, all during preadolescence, were expected to partially explain the relationship <b>between</b> childhood <b>physical</b> abuse and adolescent poor peer relations. Changes in problematic attachment to parents and aggression from preadolescence to adolescence were also expected to partially explain this relationship. Hierarchical and logistic regression analyses indicated that social misperception and aggression were both significant mediators of the relationship <b>between</b> childhood <b>physical</b> abuse and adolescent poor peer relations. Findings indicated social misperception during preadolescence partially explained the association <b>between</b> childhood <b>physical</b> abuse and adolescent social problems in general, and more specifically the association <b>between</b> childhood <b>physical</b> abuse and problematic intimate relationship functioning (i. e., dating violence). Findings also indicated that preadolescent aggression partially mediated the relationship <b>between</b> childhood <b>physical</b> abuse and adolescent general social problems. Contrary to expectations, neither problematic attachment to parents nor peer rejection status was found to significantly mediate the relationship <b>between</b> preadolescent <b>physical</b> abuse and adolescent poor peer relations. Changes from preadolescence to adolescence in problematic attachment and aggression were also found to be nonsignificant mediators. Of note, change in problematic attachment over time predicted dating violence in adolescence. Findings are discussed within the context of implications for intervention and future research directions...|$|R
