30|$|Normally, <b>blood</b> <b>cockles</b> exhibit {{resistance}} to low salinity. For example, from a salt-resistance experiment on <b>blood</b> <b>cockles</b> by Davenport and Wong (1986), the cockles showed a clear shell-closing reaction upon exposure to salinity {{of less than}} 19  PSU; about 50  % of them survived at salinity of 16  PSU, while the mortality rate was 100  % upon exposure to salinity of lower than 10  PSU for a week. Therefore, mass mortality of <b>blood</b> <b>cockles</b> is extremely likely upon exposure to a low-salinity environment of lower than 10  PSU {{for a week or}} more, which affects the filtering activity that cockles can exhibit at a salinity level of 16 – 19  PSU.|$|R

30|$|In this study, the {{salinity}} {{changes at}} the aquaculture ground during the mass mortality event are unknown because we did not measure this variable. However, it is highly likely that a reduction in salinity due to flooding occurred because there was precipitation of over 30  mm/day on four days in mid-February, {{as shown by the}} weather data. However, to explain this mass mortality event of <b>blood</b> <b>cockles,</b> multiple factors should be considered. Normally, in the spawning season, bivalves have lower environmental resistance, which is known to be potentially associated with death due to even weak environmental stress (Cho and Jeong 2005). Thus, even though the salinity decrease in the aquaculture ground alone may not have been sufficiently severe to kill the <b>blood</b> <b>cockles,</b> we should consider the possibility that the spawning season made these organisms particularly susceptible. In addition, from observation of the digestive gland tissue, many of the <b>blood</b> <b>cockles</b> collected in mid-March had no food in the digestive duct, and the epithelial cells in the tubes were also flattened. Thus, it is suggested that the state of the digestive gland made it difficult to absorb nutrients. As such, it is suggested that the <b>blood</b> <b>cockles</b> cultured in the Selangor region were debilitated by reproductive activity, and died due to a feeding disorder that was also influenced by low salinity due to the flooding in mid-February.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Bandon Bay (Surat Thani Province) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{productive}} coastal areas in southern Thailand. The Tapi River and 18 channels are the main sources of freshwater, nutrients, organic matter and sediment to the bay and the loading of freshwater and nutrients provide essential support for the production of phytoplankton in the estuarine ecosystem. Bandon Bay is important as natural spawning, nursery and feeding grounds for shellfish such as oysters, <b>blood</b> <b>cockles,</b> green mussels, short-necked clams, mud crabs and shrimps, and the estuary also serves as an excellent area for mariculturing of shellfish. In fact, oysters and <b>blood</b> <b>cockles</b> cultured in Bandon Bay are now being exported worldwide. However, Bandon Bay is also a textbook example of overexploitation of coastal resources in the tropics including all the derived changes in the estuarial ecosystem with severe socio-economic consequences...|$|R
40|$|This study aims to {{evaluate}} the productivity of the coast of Bandon Bay, Surat Thani province in Thailand. Coastal aquaculture depends on the productivity of certain target species and they are considered appropriate as the subject for comprehensive evaluation of coastal ecosystem service. Bandon Bay has a unique environment with a vast shallow region, coastal forest and rivers. Shellfish is farmed in the shallow region, and especially {{a huge amount of}} oysters and <b>blood</b> <b>cockles</b> are produced. The research has revealed the outline of the extensive farming method and distribution, and moreover, the decrease in the growth rate of oysters and <b>blood</b> <b>cockles.</b> Based on these results, the hypothesis on the possible ecological risks has been proposed. We would like to continue further consideration and research on the change {{in the use of the}} coastal environment in terms of aquaculture and how it affected the coastal environment...|$|R
50|$|The 2004 marine {{production}} in Thailand was composed of: pelagic fish 33 percent, demersal fish 18 percent, cephalopod 7.5 percent, crustaceans 4.5 percent, trash fish 30 percent and others 7 percent. Trash fish refers to non-edible species, edible species of low commercial value and juveniles, which are {{released to the}} sea. Pelagic fishes were distributed between anchovies (Stolephorus spp., 19 percent), Indo-Pacific mackerel (Rastrelliger brachysoma, 18 percent), sardinellas (Sardinellars spp., 14 percent), scad (11 percent), longtail tuna (Thunnus tonggol, 9 percent), eastern little tuna (Euthynnus affinis, 6 percent), trevallies (6 percent), bigeye scad (5 percent), Indian mackerel (Rastrelliger kanagurta, 4 percent), king mackerel (Scomberomorus cavalla, 3 percent), torpedo scad (Megalaspis cordyla , 2 percent), wolf herrings (1 percent), and others (2 percent). Demersal fish production was dominated by purple-spotted bigeye (Priacanthus tayenus), threadfin bream (Nemipterus hexodon), brushtooth lizardfish (Saurida undosquamis), slender lizardfish (Saurida elongata) and Jinga shrimp (Metapenaeus affinis). Most species are overfished since the 1970s-1990s, except for Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus commersoni), carangidae and torpedo scad (Meggalaspis spp.). The overall overfishing rate was 333 percent for pelagic and 245 percent for demersal species in 1991. Cephalopods are divided into squid, cuttlefish and molluscs, where squid and cuttlefish in Thai waters consists of 10 families, 17 genera and over 30 species. The main mollusk species captured in the Andaman Sea are scallop, <b>blood</b> <b>cockle</b> (Anadara granosa) and short-necked clam. Their collection requires bottom dredge gears, which damage the sea floor and the gears themselves and are becoming unpopular. So, the mollusk production has decreased from 27,374 tonnes in 1999 to 318 tonnes in 2004. While crustaceans composed only 4.5 {{percent of the total}} marine products in 2004 by volume, they accounted for 21 percent of the total value. They were dominated by banana prawn, tiger prawn, king prawn, school prawn, bay lobster (Thenus orientalis), mantis shrimp, swimming crabs and mud crabs. The total catch in 2004 was 51,607 tonnes for squid and cuttlefish and 36,071 tonnes for crustaceans.|$|E

30|$|The {{harvest of}} <b>blood</b> <b>cockles</b> in the Selangor region {{remained}} {{at less than}} 10, 000  tons in the early 2000 s, but increased after 2008, with a record harvest of about 40, 000  tons in 2010. Factors thought to have contributed to this increase include the arrival of new aqua farmers and expansion of the area used for aquaculture. However, the harvest has declined to about 25, 000  tons since 2011, with its level remaining unstable (Alias Man, unpublished data). Factors that may {{have had an impact}} on this have been identified, such as overcrowding cockles, sediment deterioration, flooding, and sediment disturbance in aquaculture grounds, but the main factor remains unidentified. Against this background, we heard from fishermen that a mass mortality event of <b>blood</b> <b>cockles</b> occurred at our monitoring site for aquaculture research in Selangor in mid-February, 2012. To achieve stable production in bivalve aquaculture, it is important to measure and control factors that negatively influence the growth of these organisms. Therefore, in order to clarify the causes of this mass mortality event, we examined the survival rate and population density of the cockles, alongside an environmental survey using data from field surveys that were conducted before and after the mass mortality event; in addition, the <b>blood</b> <b>cockles</b> were observed histologically after the two sampling periods, and the obtained results were discussed along with data on the weather at around this time.|$|R

40|$|Southeast Asia has a {{relatively}} long tradition in mollusc culture. The mollusc species of commercial significance {{in this region}} are the <b>blood</b> <b>cockles</b> (Anadara granosa), the green mussels (Perna viridis), the oysters (Crassostrea spp.) and the horse mussels (Modiolus sp.). Mollusc production has been observed to fluctuate dramatically in recent years due mainly to the inconsistent seed supply from the wild, which varies geographically and annually. These variations are often associated with pollution and also the uncontrolled harvesting of adults irrespective of their sizes, which reduces chances of spawning among adults. Production of the above-mentioned species in Southeast Asia in 1997 amounted to 73 820, 62 073, 36 779 and 5 300 mt., respectively. The culture of these bivalves is still dependent on traditional methods of obtaining seeds from the wild and transplanting them to culture sites for grow-out. Culture techniques for these bivalves are basically the same all over Southeast Asia, except for minor variations {{in the use of}} structures and materials to suit the local conditions. Whilst efforts are geared towards developing new technologies to promote mollusc culture in the region, it is important to facilitate and stimulate environmentally acceptable developments and sustainable management practices. Although hatchery propagation techniques have been developed for these cultured and other non-cultured species, the technologies have yet to be taken up commercially. Some of the common problems confronted by the region, which varies greatly by species and location, are inconsistent seed supply, lack of suitable areas for expanding culture activities, poor post harvest handling techniques, demand levels being below production capacity, environmental pollution, vagaries of nature, low price and lack of access to export markets...|$|R

Common flavors in Thai food come from garlic, galangal, coriander/cilantro, lemon grass, shallots, pepper, kaffir lime leaves, shrimp paste, fish sauce, and chilies. Palm sugar, made from the sap of certain Borassus palms, is used to sweeten dishes while lime and tamarind contribute sour notes. Meats used in Thai cuisine are usually pork and chicken, and also duck, beef, and water buffalo. Goat and mutton are rarely eaten except by Muslim Thais. Game, such as wild boar, deer and wild birds, are now less common due to loss of habitat, the introduction of modern methods of intensive animal farming in the 1960s, and the rise of agribusinesses, such as Thai Charoen Pokphand Foods, in the 1980s.
