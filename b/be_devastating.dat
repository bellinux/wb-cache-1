5|$|Epizootics are {{outbreaks}} (epidemics) {{of disease}} among non-human animals. During the 20th century significant epizootics of viral diseases in animals, particularly livestock, occurred worldwide. The many diseases caused by viruses included foot-and-mouth disease, rinderpest of cattle, avian and swine influenza, swine fever and bluetongue of sheep. Viral diseases of livestock can <b>be</b> <b>devastating</b> both to farmers {{and the wider}} community, as the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the UK in 2001 showed.|$|E
5|$|On June 25, 1862, McClellan {{ordered an}} {{ineffective}} offensive triggering the Seven Days Battles. On June 26, General Robert E. Lee, {{who had recently}} taken command of the Army of Northern Virginia, launched a daring counter-offensive intended to drive McClellan's army away from Richmond. For the 22nd, {{the third day of}} the Seven Days Battles, the Battle of Gaines' Mill, proved to <b>be</b> <b>devastating</b> as they suffered their worst casualties of the war.|$|E
5|$|Surface-to-surface missile battalions {{were divided}} into three or four batteries, each {{equipped}} with one missile launcher. They operated thirty FROG-3 and eighteen SCUD missile launchers. The FROG-3, a tactical missile first introduced in 1960, was being replaced in other non-Soviet Warsaw Pact armies. Proven to be fairly inaccurate in combat, FROG and SCUD missiles would be ineffective weapons carrying conventional high-explosive warheads. Tipped with nuclear or chemical warheads, however, they could <b>be</b> <b>devastating.</b> According to one former Romanian official writing in 1988, Romania produced chemical agents that could be delivered by battlefield missiles.|$|E

5|$|Yet Brooks did {{not always}} ennoble her subjects. Inherited wealth freed her from the need to sell her paintings; she did not care whether she pleased her sitters or not, and her wit, when unleashed, could <b>be</b> <b>devastating.</b> A {{striking}} example is her 1914–15 portrait of Elsie de Wolfe, an interior designer whom she felt had copied her monochromatic color schemes. Brooks painted de Wolfe porcelain-pale, in an off-white dress and a bonnet resembling a shower cap; a white ceramic goat placed on a table at her elbow seems to mimic her simpering expression.|$|E
5|$|Members of {{the breed}} {{are not usually}} ridden until they are four years old, and {{structural}} development is not complete until age seven. Their most productive years are between eight and eighteen, although they retain their strength and stamina into their twenties. An Icelandic mare that lived in Denmark reached a record age of 56, while another horse, living in Great Britain, {{reached the age of}} 42. The horses are highly fertile, and both sexes are fit for breeding up to age 25; mares have been recorded giving birth at age 27. The horses tend to not be easily spooked, probably the result of not having any natural predators in their native Iceland. Icelandics tend to be friendly, docile and easy to handle, although also enthusiastic and self-assured. As a result of their isolation from other horses, disease in the breed within Iceland is mostly unknown, except for some kinds of internal parasites. The low prevalence of disease in Iceland is maintained by laws preventing horses exported from the country being returned, and by requiring that all equine equipment taken into the country be either new and unused or fully disinfected. As a result, native horses have no acquired immunity to disease; an outbreak on the island would be likely to <b>be</b> <b>devastating</b> to the breed. This presents problems with showing native Icelandic horses against others of the breed from outside the country, as no livestock of any species can be imported into Iceland, and once horses leave the country they are not allowed to return.|$|E
25|$|A {{symptomatic}} treatment includes rehydration and pain relief with {{drugs such as}} paracetamol (acetaminophen in the United States). Acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) should not be given because of its anticoagulant effect, which can <b>be</b> <b>devastating</b> {{in the case of}} internal bleeding that can occur with yellow fever.|$|E

25|$|Measles is an endemic disease, {{meaning that}} it has been {{continually}} present in a community, and many people develop resistance. In populations that have not been exposed to measles, exposure to a new disease can <b>be</b> <b>devastating.</b> In 1529, a measles outbreak in Cuba killed two-thirds of the natives who had previously survived smallpox. The disease had ravaged Mexico, Central America, and the Inca civilization.|$|E
25|$|The {{short-term}} psychological {{injuries to}} the victims include feelings of fear, helplessness, sadness, disorientation, isolation, vulnerability, and desperation. If left untreated, the psychological effects of sexual assault and rape can <b>be</b> <b>devastating,</b> sometimes even deadly. Causes of death {{as the result of}} sexual violence include suicide and murder. Murder of sexual assault and rape victims may be perpetrated by the rapist or as part of an honor killing by family members of the victim.|$|E
25|$|Because {{they provide}} 30 {{molecules}} of ATP per glucose molecule {{in contrast to}} the 2 ATP molecules produced by glycolysis, mitochondria are essential to all higher organisms for sustaining life. The mitochondrial diseases are genetic disorders carried in mitochondrial DNA, or nuclear DNA coding for mitochondrial components. Slight problems with any one of the numerous enzymes used by the mitochondria can <b>be</b> <b>devastating</b> to the cell, and in turn, to the organism.|$|E

25|$|Flooding {{along the}} Brisbane River has the {{potential}} to <b>be</b> <b>devastating,</b> as documented in 1974 and 2011. For much of the river's length its banks are relatively high, but topped by a broad plain. The river's meandering course means that flood waters from upstream cannot be quickly discharged into Moreton Bay. Thus higher than normal flows cause river levels to rise rapidly and once the top of the banks are breached the floodwaters can spread over wide areas of the city.|$|E
25|$|According to Vega, she {{particularly}} liked singing {{because it}} is through this medium that {{she is able to}} best express her inner thoughts and feelings. This became especially true after the loss of her brother Joey, to whom she was particularly very close. Joey was stabbed to death in a car by hired killers, who mistook him for another person they were hired to look for and then kill, while hanging out with his friends in 1983. His untimely death at the age of 22 proved to <b>be</b> <b>devastating</b> for the young Julie, who then repeatedly wished to join him in death.|$|E
25|$|Arctia Offshore also {{received}} criticism from environmental {{organizations such as}} Greenpeace after the Finnish multipurpose icebreakers were chartered for Shell Oil Company to support exploration drilling operations in the Arctic waters off Alaska where the consequences of an oil spill would <b>be</b> <b>devastating.</b> There have also been concerns about the legal liability {{in case of an}} oil spill after a report by the Research Institute of the Finnish Economy claimed that the Finnish State could be held liable and the compensations could include the entire property of Arctia Shipping, the state-owned shipping company that owns and operates the Finnish icebreaker fleet.|$|E

25|$|The steppe peoples quickly came to {{dominate}} Central Asia, forcing the scattered city states and kingdoms {{to pay them}} tribute or face annihilation. The martial ability of the steppe peoples was limited, however, {{by the lack of}} political structure within the tribes. Confederations of various groups would sometimes form under a ruler known as a khan. When large numbers of nomads acted in unison they could <b>be</b> <b>devastating,</b> as when the Huns arrived in Western Europe. However, tradition dictated that any dominion conquered in such wars should be divided among all of the khan's sons, so these empires often declined as quickly as they formed.|$|E
25|$|On Monday, February 27, 1984, the Tom Leykis Show {{aired on}} WNWS in Miami {{to replace the}} WNWS night show hosted by talk radio {{personality}} Neil Rogers. Rogers, who had previously signed conflicting employment contracts with both WNWS (790 AM) and WINZ (940 AM), had just won permission from a Miami court to take his act to WINZ and hoped leaving WNWS would <b>be</b> <b>devastating</b> to Leykis' program. Rogers and Leykis became rivals and, in June 1984, just after Denver {{radio talk show host}} Alan Berg was assassinated, Leykis told listeners Neil Rogers' real name and urged callers to harass his on-air rival. By January 1985, Leykis had the top-ranking evening talk show in the market. In September 1985, Leykis abruptly left his WNWS job over concern about the pending WNWS-WGBS merger and began work at Phoenix's KFYI.|$|E
25|$|A Yakima Chief, Qualchan, who was disgruntled {{following}} {{the loss of}} the Yakima War to the U.S. Army, gathered the Colville, the Coeur d'Alene, the Columbia River, and the Kalispel tribes at a council in order to convince the tribes that the white man was encroaching on their lands and that they needed to defend them. The Coeur d’Alene and other tribes subsequently held a council discussing their concerns that the army would invade their territory {{as a result of the}} growing tensions. A line was drawn at the Snake River, agreeing that if the army crossed it, they would have effectively crossed into the Indians’ territory, and this would be considered a hostile action. Interestingly, the Coeur d’Alene tribe was split in their feelings toward war. The tribal leaders did not want war, fearing that the consequences to their people would <b>be</b> <b>devastating,</b> while the younger warriors, led by Milkapsi, were angry and wanted to fight.|$|E

25|$|During the 2000–01 season, the 76ers {{got off to}} a {{hot start}} by winning their first ten games and were never seriously {{challenged}} in the Atlantic Division. Larry Brown coached the Eastern Conference All-Stars, and Allen Iverson was named MVP of the All-Star Game. Shortly before the All-Star break, Theo Ratliff was lost for the season with a wrist injury, one that would later prove to <b>be</b> <b>devastating</b> to his future career. Despite holding a 41–14 record and a comfortable lead atop both the Atlantic Division and Eastern Conference standings {{at the time of the}} February 22 trade deadline, management felt the team needed an established center to advance deep into the playoffs. On that day, Philadelphia acquired Dikembe Mutombo from the Atlanta Hawks in a deal that sent the injured Ratliff along with Nazr Mohammed, Toni Kukoč, and Pepe Sánchez to Atlanta (Sánchez was reacquired later in the season after the Hawks waived him). The 76ers went on to finish 56–26, good enough for their first Atlantic Division title since 1989–90 and top seed in the Eastern Conference Playoffs.|$|E
25|$|Due to the Stone Dogs virus, Draka forces {{ultimately}} succeed—if barely—in {{wiping out}} all significant Alliance populations and {{military forces in}} the Earth-Luna sphere. In the process, they lose 15 percent of the Citizen population and 22 percent of the serf population—300 million total. The Alliance, though suffering 400 million casualties and losing its Ceres command center, wins in trans-Lunar space, including the Belt. A truce is declared, allowing the Alliance remnants in the Belt to launch the starship, while giving other Alliance remnants in space limited Draka citizenship (the new Draka {{will not be able}} to vote, though their children will be). The war itself proves to <b>be</b> <b>devastating</b> to Earth. Though the Solar System belongs to the Draka, the planet's ecosystems were pushed nearly to the breaking point. The war causes a nuclear winter lasting for several years, a climatic disturbance so severe that ice forms in the Adriatic Sea, despite most nukes being 'clean' fusion weapons and Archon Eric von Shrakenberg, in an effort to limit damage to the planet, ordering no more nuclear weapons used within the atmosphere after a certain point in the conflict.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{cultural}} implications {{and the importance of}} bearing children, infertility in Ghana can <b>be</b> <b>devastating.</b> Throughout the years, Ghanaians have believed that both physical and spiritual ailments are the cause of infertility. Some people believe that a womb could be too hot or too cold to support a developing baby. Others believe that the cause of their infertility is witchcraft, and this belief is often supported by traditional priests who assert that the woman can be rid of a witch's curse and be allowed to conceive if the priest performs a rite in which he asks fertility gods how they can be appeased. Other spiritual beliefs involving infertility include the belief that infertility {{is the result of a}} woman's disobedience to God, in which the remedy is prayer and repentance. Women who consult a tradition birth attendant are likely to be told that prayer is the medicine for infertility, although they acknowledge that infertility is sometimes caused by a physical ailment. In these cases, the traditional birth attendant may blame the infertility on stomach aches and advise the woman to visit a hospital and take the medicine given by the doctor.|$|E
