25|$|Perceiving a {{means of}} revenge, Republican congressmen {{defeated}} Bush's proposal which would enact spending cuts and tax increases that would reduce the deficit by $500billion over five years. Scrambling, Bush accepted the Democrats' demands for higher taxes and more spending, which alienated him from Republicans and {{gave way to a}} sharp decrease in popularity. Bush would later say that he wished he had never signed the bill. Near the end of the 101st Congress, the president and congressional members reached a compromise on a <b>budget</b> <b>package</b> that increased the marginal tax rate and phased out exemptions for high-income taxpayers. Although he originally demanded a reduction in the capital gains tax, Bush relented on this issue as well. This agreement with the Democratic leadership in Congress proved to be {{a turning point in the}} Bush presidency; his popularity among Republicans never fully recovered.|$|E
25|$|Despite her {{reputation}} as a liberal, Moseley Braun possessed something of a centrist record on economic issues. She voted for the 1993 <b>budget</b> <b>package</b> and against the welfare reform laws passed in 1996, but on many other matters she was more conservative. Moseley Braun {{voted in favor of}} the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and lawsuit reform measures like the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (she was also among the minority of Democrats to support the even more controversial Common Sense Product Liability and Legal Reform Act of 1995). She also voted contrary to the interests of the more populist wing of the party by voting for the Freedom to Farm Act and the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Like her Illinois colleague, fellow Democrat Paul Simon, she voted in favor of a Balanced Budget Amendment to the United States Constitution and also to place a nuclear spent fuel storage facility in Nevada, a move strongly opposed by many Democrats, especially former Majority Leader Harry Reid.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} has {{one main}} objective: {{the design and}} construct of a spreadsheet based <b>package</b> to facilitate <b>budgeting</b> on farm. This aim is covered in several distinct parts. Initially the development of current farm financial management practices is covered, as a basis of providing a foundation and understanding to the current approach adopted. This then progresses naturally into current budgeting procedures. With the final package being based on a personal computer, {{it was necessary to}} investigate the use of computers on farms, this research would provide crucial answers to several key questions, why are farmers slow in their uptake of this technology? can these reasons be overcome? what features are desirable in a farm software package ? etc. The information gained here would have a direct effect on the design and construction of the <b>budgeting</b> <b>package.</b> Before producing the spreadsheet package it was necessary to design the package in some detail, reviewing work previously undertaken in order to ensure the package itself would build on the authors previous experiences, and thus maximise the potential benefits offered by the package. Following this research the package was constructed using Microsoft Excel™ 5 - a readily [...] available. comm,~~cialspreadsheet. Using this slightly older version of Excel ensures that th~ coinpiei~d package will run on most personal computers that have been installed on farms since'i 993, the date this version of Excel was released. Subsequent versions of Excel are capable of running the package. As with all management aids, they must increase the chances of achieving the set objectives, there is little point in constructing a <b>budgeting</b> <b>package</b> if it is of little use to farmers or its uptake on farm is low. For management to benefit from this package it must yield useful information, with the minimum of effort required from the manager and this was paramount in both the design and construction stages. However, it must be remembered that a computer based <b>budgeting</b> <b>package,</b> no matter how well programmed, is unlikely to satisfy all requirements, individual farmers have individual needs, which may be similar, but unlikely to be identical. For this reason the package produced adheres to well accepted norms, in terms of what information it produces and how this is presented to the user. In addition to the above, it must be stressed that the information produced by the package should not be the only information used to make decisions on future farming policy, there are other aspects, ranging from the physical aspects through to personal objectives, that must be considered, before a final decision is made...|$|R

5000|$|Once sworn into Congress in January 1993, Shepherd {{was placed}} on the Natural Resources and the Public Works and Transportation Committees.

She supported President Clinton’s 1993 <b>Budget</b> <b>package</b> that cut the budget and also raised taxes on upper income people. The budget passed by a single vote. “It seems to me it’s not perfect,” Shepherd said of the proposed budget. “But the worst of all of the alternatives is not to pass it, and not move forward to health care, free trade and all of these things we need to do.” She also supported the Brady Bill and the Assault Weapon Ban. Her willingness to take tough stands in her District {{and at the same time}} stand up to her party on issues of reform led one prominent columnist to say just before her election, “But whether Shepherd wins or loses, her stand is a reminder of a formula for successful progressive politics that’s been characteristic of the western states.” ...|$|E

Improved economic conditions and policies served to encourage investors in the bond market, leading to a decline in long-term interest rates. Clinton's final four budgets were balanced budgets with surpluses, beginning with the 1997 budget. The surplus money was used to pay down the public debt by $452 billion, though the gross federal debt continued to increase. However, the claimed surplus was only recorded against public debt which was calculated with the exclusion of intragovernmental holdings. This meant that the administration was able to record loans deducted from {{the social security trust fund}} as revenue on budget reports, which accounted for the bulk of the surplus money. Calculating both the intragovernmental holdings from the public debt, the lowest deficit was $17.9 billion; in effect, the alleged surplus was, supposedly, a mere accounting fiction.The total national debt (gross federal debt) rose every year of the Clinton administration from $4.3 trillion to $5.6 trillion and from $5.4 trillion to $5.6 trillion over the years where the surplus was claimed.|$|E
50|$|To {{trigger the}} {{reconciliation}} process, Congress passes a concurrent resolution {{on the budget}} instructing one or more committees to report changes in law affecting the budget by a certain date.
