25|$|In the past, grain {{elevators}} sometimes experienced silo explosions. Fine powder {{from the}} millions of grains passing through the facility would accumulate and mix with the oxygen in the air. A spark could spread from one floating particle to the other creating a chain reaction that would destroy the entire structure. (This dispersed-fuel explosion is the mechanism behind fuel-air bombs.) To prevent this, elevators have very rigorous rules against smoking or any other open flame. Many elevators also have various devices installed to maximize ventilation, safeguards against overheating in <b>belt</b> <b>conveyors,</b> legs, bearing, and explosion-proof electrical devices such as electric motors, switches, and lighting.|$|E

2500|$|Most thermal {{stations}} use coal as {{the main}} fuel. Raw coal is transported from coal mines to a power station site by trucks, barges, bulk cargo ships or railway cars. Generally, when shipped by railways, the coal cars are sent as a full train of cars. The coal received at site may be of different sizes. The railway cars are unloaded at site by rotary dumpers or side tilt dumpers to tip over onto conveyor belts below. The coal is generally conveyed to crushers which crush the coal to about [...] size. The crushed coal is then sent by <b>belt</b> <b>conveyors</b> to a storage pile. Normally, the crushed coal is compacted by bulldozers, as compacting of highly volatile coal avoids spontaneous ignition.|$|E
