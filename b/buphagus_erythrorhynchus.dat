50|$|The red-billed {{oxpecker}} (<b>Buphagus</b> <b>erythrorhynchus)</b> is a passerine {{bird in the}} starling and myna family, Sturnidae; some ornithologists regard the oxpeckers {{to be in a}} family by themselves, the Buphagidae. It is native to the savannah of sub-Saharan Africa, from the Central African Republic east to South Sudan and south to northern and eastern South Africa. Its range overlaps that of the less widespread yellow-billed oxpecker.|$|E
40|$|The {{movements}} of the Redbilled Oxpecker <b>Buphagus</b> <b>erythrorhynchus</b> were studied in the Kruger National Park in the period March 1973 to December 1974. The study population at Skukuza showed little or no fluctuations in numbers and no local movements. The maximum distance the oxpeckers were observed away from the trapping station measured 8, 0 km with a mean distance of 3, 37 km. For two birds circular home ranges of 26 km 2 and 27 km 2 were calculated...|$|E
40|$|Field {{observations}} of the interactions between red-billed oxpeckers (<b>Buphagus</b> <b>erythrorhynchus)</b> and wild ungulates in Nakuru National Park, Kenya, revealed that specific hosts frequently attempted to manipulate oxpecker foraging. This involved a repertoire of behaviour collectively referred to as resistance behaviour, and often resulted in the oxpeckers either changing their position on the host's body or departing. Cape buffalo (Syncerus caffer), {{the most frequently used}} host, performed little resistance behaviour. Waterbuck (Kobus ellipsiprymnus) were also popular oxpecker hosts, but frequently exhibited vigorous resistance behaviour. Impala (Aepyceros melampus), the third most widely used host species, also utilized resistance behaviours, but allowed a greater proportion of oxpeckers to forage without disturbance. The suite of resistance behaviours employed by waterbuck, impala and also the consequences for oxpecker foraging, differed significantly. Our data suggest that the oxpecker-ungulate interactions in the field are more complex than previously realized with resistance behaviour regularly employed by selected mammalian host species...|$|E
40|$|Various {{bird species}} feed {{on a variety}} of insects, ticks and other {{external}} parasites, dead and wounded tissue, clots and blood, secretions and organic debris found on the body of other vertebrates (hosts or clients). Herein I present an overview of so called cleaner birds based on literature records, field observations, and photo surveys. I found that 101 bird species in 32 families practice cleaning even if some of them do so very occasionally. Cleaner birds range from the renowned Red-billed Oxpecker <b>Buphagus</b> <b>erythrorhynchus</b> from Africa to the little known Crested Partridge Rollulus roulroul from Malaysia. Clients are mostly medium-sized to large herbivores such as iguanas, tortoises, capybaras, and wild and domestic ungulates, but also include carnivores such as seals and seabirds. Some clients adopt particular, posing postures while being cleaned, whereas others are indifferent or even disturbed by the activity of some cleaner species. Capybaras, giant tortoises and iguanas are among the posing clients, whereas most ungulates remain oblivious to cleaners. Features such as omnivorous diet and/or opportunistic behaviour, and the habit of associating in other ways with larger vertebrates are related to cleaning behaviour. Most cleaner birds inhabit open areas, and forestdwelling cleaners seemingly are few...|$|E
40|$|<b>Buphagus</b> <b>erythrorhynchus</b> uses 4 feeding methods-scissoring, plucking, pecking {{and insect}} catching. During {{the day the}} birds spend 68 % of their time feeding, with peaks of {{activity}} during the early morning and late afternoon. A total of 21 641 ixodid ticks were found in 53 stomachs examined, {{with a range of}} between 16 and 1 665 per stomach. Boophilus and Rhipicephalus were the most important genera eaten. Thirty Diptera, also found in the stomachs, accounted for 0, 4 % of the diet by mass. The food of the nestlings consisted of 45, 6 % ticks, 19, 4 % Diptera and 35, 0 % hair and tissues. When kept in captivity, Buphagus was able to account for an appreciable reduction in the numbers of Boophilus on cattle, reaching a figure of 95, 7 % reduction for adult ticks. In controlled experiments Buphagus showed the highest preference for Boophilus decoloratus, Rhipicephalus appendiculatus and Hyalomma truncatum. The daily food intake of a captive bird was 14, 7 g, which is equivalent to 7 195 engorged Amblyomma hebraeum larvae. Three acaricides, namely, amitraz, chloromethiuron and DDT, did not cause any clinically detectable toxicity in captive birds during a 5 -day period.
