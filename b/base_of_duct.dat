40|$|Prostaglandins {{have been}} {{postulated}} {{to participate in}} the regulation of salt excretion during acute volume expansion. The present papillary and cortical micropuncture studies were designed to examine the effect of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors on segmental chloride transport during hydropenia (with and without meclofenamate) and 10 % volume expansion (with and without both meclofenamate and indomethacin). Both inhibitors significantly decreased the urinary excretion rate of prostaglandins E 2 and F 2 α. Clearance studies on the intact right kidney demonstrated no effect of either agent on glomerular filtration rate, but a significant reduction in chloride excretion during hydropenia and volume expansion was observed. To assess the specific site(s) of enhanced chloride reabsorption, absolute and fractional chloride delivery was measured in the late proximal tubule, thin descending limb of Henle, and the early and late distal tubules. In addition, the fraction of filtered chloride remaining at the <b>base</b> and tip <b>of</b> the papillary collecting duct was compared to that fraction remaining at the superficial late distal tubule. During hydropenia, meclofenamate had no effect on fractional chloride delivery out of the superficial late distal tubule or the juxtamedullary thin descending limb of Henle, but significantly reduced the fraction of chloride delivered to the <b>base</b> <b>of</b> the papillary collecting duct. During volume expansion, neither meclofenamate nor indomethacin had an effect on absolute chloride delivery out of the proximal tubule or the thin descending limb of Henle. However, absolute chloride delivery to the early distal tubule was significantly reduced, and was associated with a decrease in fractional chloride reabsorption in this segment. Furthermore, the fraction of chloride delivered to the <b>base</b> <b>of</b> the collecting <b>duct</b> was significantly reduced. Fractional reabsorption along the terminal 1 mm <b>of</b> the collecting <b>duct</b> was not altered by either meclofenamate or indomethacin. These results suggest that inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis result in an increase in chloride reabsorption in the superficial loop of Henle, and in segments between the superficial late distal tubule and the <b>base</b> <b>of</b> the collecting <b>duct.</b> The results are consistent with the view that prostaglandins inhibit chloride transport in the thick ascending limb of Henle, and/or the cortical and outer medullary collecting tubule...|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} predict the {{aerodynamic}} noise, aerodynamic characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>ducted</b> tail rotor should be obtained first. Along with the development <b>of</b> the <b>ducted</b> tail rotor, many researchers have studied the aerodynamic characteristics of various types <b>of</b> <b>ducted</b> tail rotors (Rajagopalan and Keys 1997; Bandoh et al. 1998; Vuillet and Morelli 1986). In recent years, the main method which investigates the aerodynamic performance <b>of</b> <b>ducted</b> tail rotor is CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamic) method. Among those CFD methods, momentum source method {{is one of the}} commonly used methods. The momentum source with functional relationship to the local flow conditions represents the spanning rotor in flow field and are added to the N-S equations by UDF procedure. Cao and Yu (2005) used it to solve the numerical simulation of turbulent flow around ducted tail rotor. The method not only can predict the flow field but also investigate the performance <b>of</b> the <b>ducted</b> tail rotors. Song et al. (2009) applied it to analyze the aerodynamic characteristics <b>of</b> <b>ducted</b> tail rotor. To obtain the aerodynamic characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>ducted</b> tail rotor, the author solved the N-S equation added by the source. The numerical solutions were verified by the experimental data, and some aerodynamic characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>ducted</b> tail rotor were also discussed. Even though momentum source method is quite successful for the prediction of the aerodynamic performance <b>of</b> <b>ducted</b> tail rotor, detailed three dimensional flow features cannot be accurately predicted. Because of the approximation of the blade shape parameters, the accuracy of the momentum source method is still limited. In addition, it is difficult to obtain the accurate noise source information by using the momentum source method. In this work, a CFD method which is considered the blade shape parameters has been proposed to investigate the aerodynamic characteristics <b>of</b> <b>ducted</b> tail rotor, and the method is based on moving reference frame (MRF) model instead of momentum source method.|$|R
