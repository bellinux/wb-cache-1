Mercedes updated the regulator {{to improve its}} reliability, but the redesigned regulator requires the installation of a new blower motor—about $1,000 in parts. The old-style regulator, which {{is compatible with the}} existing <b>blower</b> <b>motor,</b> is no longer manufactured. The <b>blower</b> <b>motor</b> regulator may be replaced with the much less expensive W140 S-class blower regulator, provided that the E-class wiring harness is re-attached to the S-class regulator.|$|R

50|$|Air-conditioning {{was never}} an option on right-hand-drive Saxos because the <b>blower</b> <b>motor</b> was mounted in the bulk-head on the driver's side. As a result, there was {{insufficient}} space available to accommodate the evaporator, except by first ducting the air flow to the passenger's side {{and then at the}} expense of the glove-box. Although an after-market kit was available that did exactly this, the resultant pressure loss made the system noisy and ineffective. The <b>blower</b> <b>motor</b> could also not be easily relocated, since the windscreen wiper motor was mounted in the passenger's side space.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an efficient speed governor for the <b>blower</b> <b>motor</b> {{used in the}} air conditioning of electric vehicles (EV). Performance optimization of blowers offers tremendous potential for energy saving and hence the running cost.

The PWM signal with 0 - 100 % duty ratio control governs the semiconductor switches such as MOSFETs in controlling the supply voltage to the motor. The proposed control scheme governs the speed by varying the reference voltage to the SG 3525 and also protects the motor from high current as the scheme monitors the current flow through the motor indirectly via gate control signal of the semiconductor switches...|$|R

40|$|Residential gas {{furnaces}} contain blowers {{to distribute}} warm air. Currently, furnace blowers use either a Permanent Split Capacitor (PSC) or a Brushless Permanent Magnet (BPM) <b>motor.</b> <b>Blowers</b> {{account for the}} majority of furnace electricity consumption. Therefore, accurate determination of the blower electricity consumption is important for understanding electricity consumption of furnaces. The electricity consumption of <b>blower</b> <b>motors</b> depends on the static pressure across the blower. This paper examines both types of <b>blower</b> <b>motors</b> in non-condensing non-weatherized gas furnaces at a range of static pressures. Fan performance data is based on manufacturer product literature and laboratory tests. We use field-measured static pressure in ducts to get typical system curves to calculate how furnaces would operate in the field. We contrast this with the electricity consumption of a furnace blower operating under the DOE test procedure and manufacturer rated conditions. Furnace electricity use is also affected by operating modes that happen {{at the beginning and end}} of each furnace firing cycle. These operating modes are the pre-purge and post-purge by the draft inducer, the on-delay and off-delay of the blower, and the hot surface ignitor operation. To accurately calculate this effect, we use the number of firing cycles in a typical California house in the Central Valley of California. Cooling hours are not considered in the DOE test procedure. We also account for furnace blower use by the air conditioner and stand-by power. Overall BPM motors outperform PSC motors, but the total electricity savings are significantly less than projected using the DOE test procedure conditions. The performance gains depend on the static pressure of the household ducts, which are typically much higher than in the test procedures...|$|R

The <b>motor</b> <b>assembly</b> must survive all ground operations, plus the nominal 670 Martian-day (or sol) mission that includes summer and winter seasons of the Mars environment. The <b>motor</b> <b>assembly</b> was tested and characterized under extreme temperature conditions with reference to hardware requirements. The <b>motor</b> <b>assembly</b> has been proved to be remarkably robust and displayed no sign of degradation due to the 3 X (three times per JPL design principles) thermal environmental exposure to the punishing Mars surface operations cycles. The motor characteristics obtained before, during, and post-test comparisons for the surface operations cycles are within measurement error of one another. The motors withstood/survived 2, 010 extreme temperature cycles with a Delta T of 190 C deep temperature cycles, representing three times the expected thermal cycling exposure during the MSL surface operations. The qualification test hardware elements (A 200 <b>motor</b> <b>assembly,</b> encoders, and resolver) have not shown any signs of degradation due to the PQV (Package Qualification and Verification) testing.
