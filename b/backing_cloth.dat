They examined the human and non-human DNA found when the shroud and its <b>backing</b> <b>cloth</b> were vacuumed in 1977 and 1988. They found traces of 19 different plant taxa, including plants native to Mediterranean countries, Central Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, Eastern Asia (China) and the Americas. Of the human mtDNA, sequences were found belonging to haplogroups that are typical of various ethnicities and geographic regions, including Europe, North and East Africa, the Middle East and India. A few non-plant and non-human sequences were also detected, including various birds and one ascribable to a marine worm common in the Northern Pacific Ocean, next to Canada. After sequencing some DNA of pollen and dust found on the shroud, they confirmed that many people from many different places {{came in contact with}} the shroud. According to the scientists, [...] "such diversity does not exclude a Medieval origin in Europe but it would be also compatible with the historic path followed by the Turin Shroud during its presumed journey from the Near East. Furthermore, the results raise the possibility of an Indian manufacture of the linen cloth." ...|$|E

50|$|Walton’s next {{product was}} inlaid {{linoleum}}, which resembled encaustic tiles, in 1882. Previously, linoleum had been produced in solid colours, with patterns {{printed on the}} surface if required. In inlaid linoleum, the colours extend {{all the way through}} to the <b>backing</b> <b>cloth.</b> Inlaid linoleum was made using a stencil type method where different-coloured granules were placed in shaped metal trays, after which the sheets were run through heated rollers to fuse them to the <b>backing</b> <b>cloth.</b> In 1898 Walton devised a process for making straight-line inlaid linoleum that allowed for crisp, sharp geometric designs. This involved strips of uncured linoleum being cut and pieced together patchwork-fashion before being hot-rolled. Embossed inlaid linoleum was not introduced until 1926.|$|E

50|$|As {{an input}} to the jute {{manufacturing}} (goods) industry, the supply for jute {{is derived from}} the demand. Nearly 75% of jute goods are used as packaging materials, burlap, gunny cloth, (hessian), and sacks. Carpet <b>Backing</b> <b>Cloth,</b> the third major jute outlet, is fast growing in importance. Currently, it consists of roughly 15% of the world's jute goods consumption. The remaining products are carpet yarn, cordage, felts, padding, twine, ropes, decorative fabrics, and heavy duty miscellaneous items for industrial use.|$|E
50|$|Jute {{is used in}} the {{manufacture}} of a number of fabrics such as Hessian cloth, sacking, scrim, carpet <b>backing</b> <b>cloth</b> (CBC), and canvas. Hessian, lighter than sacking, is used for bags, wrappers, wall-coverings, upholstery, and home furnishings. Sacking, a fabric made of heavy jute fibers, has its use in the name. CBC made of jute comes in two types. Primary CBC provides a tufting surface, while secondary CBC is bonded onto the primary backing for an overlay. Jute packaging is used as an eco-friendly substitute.|$|E

Officer Cadets may wear a small white backing behind their badges. Members of arms such as the Adjutant General's Corps and Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers serving on attachment to other units often wear that regiment's beret or headdress but with their own Corps cap badge.|$|E

50|$|Cellophane {{was invented}} by Swiss chemist Jacques E. Brandenberger while {{employed}} by Blanchisserie et Teinturerie de Thaon. In 1900, inspired by seeing a wine spill on a restaurant's tablecloth, he decided to create a cloth that could repel liquids rather than absorb them. His {{first step was to}} spray a waterproof coating onto fabric, and he opted to try viscose. The resultant coated fabric was far too stiff, but the clear film easily separated from the <b>backing</b> <b>cloth,</b> and he abandoned his original idea as the possibilities of the new material became apparent.|$|E
50|$|The M40 Tropical tunics of the Afrikakorps, later {{authorized}} {{for summer}} field wear in Southern Europe, were {{basically the same}} cut as the standard army uniform but with open collar and lapels, and made of a medium-weight olive-drab cotton twill which in service faded to khaki. Also olive were the shirt and the seldom-worn necktie. Insignia were embroidered in dull blue-grey on tan <b>backing</b> <b>cloth.</b> This tunic was issued to all Army personnel in North Africa, including officers and Panzer crews. Officers as usual often purchased uniforms privately, and olive, khaki or mustard-yellow cotton versions of the M35 officers' tunic were worn alongside the standard issue, sometimes with green collars. The M40 Tropical breeches were of jodhpur type, to be worn with knee-boots or puttees: these were very unpopular and most were soon cut off to make shorts (captured British/Commonwealth shorts were frequently worn as well). By mid-1941 conventional trousers in olive cotton were being issued, followed soon thereafter by regulation Heer shorts; these had a built-in cloth belt. A chocolate brown overcoat in the same pattern as the continental version was issued as protection from the cold desert nights.|$|E

50|$|In 1999-2000, {{the mill}} had 1,939 looms for hessian, 1,103 for sacking and 234 for carpet <b>backing</b> <b>cloth</b> (CBC). The looms in {{operation}} were 1085 for hessian, 726 for sacking, and 172 for CBC. Budgeted weaving production was 19,002 ton of hessian, 34,609 ton of sacking and 6,004 ton of CBC for the year. Actual production, {{on the other}} hand, was 10,284 ton of hessian, 21,236 ton of sacking, and 3,254 ton of CBC. The mill had 515 officers, 1,561 support staff and 16,443 workers. Man-days per ton estimated for 1999-2000 were 218 for hessian, 94 for sacking and 131 for CBC, which were 189, 88 and 112 respectively in 1995-1996. The Adamjee Jute Mill has more manpower than it actually requires for production of hessian, sacking and CBC. Also, the man-days required to produce these items have also increased {{in the last five}} years. The mill has, however, achieved some improvements in terms of use of raw materials. In 1995-1996, the raw jute required to produce a ton of hessian per ton was 1,672 kg, a ton of sacking 1,494 kg and a ton of CBC 1,813 kg. The comparative figures for 1999-2000 were 1,281 kg for hessian, 1,104 kg for sacking, and 1,447 kg for CBC. A rise in the wage cost per ton from Tk 23,092, 15,780 and 22,248 for hessian, sacking and CBC respectively in 1995-1996 to Tk 27,248, Tk 18,596 and Tk 25,800 respectively in 1999-2000 has, however, offset the economy achieved in use of raw materials.|$|E
50|$|There {{were only}} three ranks in pre-World War I Serbia: General (from 1872), Army General (from 1900 to 1901) and Field Marshal (Бојни Bojвода / Bojni Vojvoda) (from 1901). Four ranks were {{introduced}} in Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes in 1923, and lasted until 1945. There were only two types of shoulder cords: with doubleheaded eagle and coat of arms of Kingdom of SHS or Kingdom of Yugoslavia for Field Marshal and without for all other General ranks. The different general grades were indicated by 6-pointed stars on the cuffs. Also the <b>backing</b> <b>cloth</b> for the shoulder cords was light blue for army general (was honorary rank in period from 1900-1901) and divisional generals and in a colour of service for brigadier general. During the Middle Ages, the Vojvoda was a military commander rank and a noble titule. In the Balkan Wars and World War I this title was used to designate the highest military rank in Serbian Army and later Royal Yugoslav Army (above the General - as equalent of Field Marshal in other armies). This rank was introduced by the law on the Organization of the Army Kingdom of Serbia in 1901. It has been awarded only during the war for: special merits of top generals. The first Field Marshal was promoted by the Great military decree of the Kingdom of Serbia on 20 October 1912. Only four people ever officially held that military rank: Radomir Putnik (got it in 1912), Stepa Stepanović (1914), Živojin Mišić (1914) and Petar Bojović (1918). Honorary title but not military rank held Montenegrin General Janko Vukotić (1915) and the French General Louis Franchet d'Espérey (1921). After unification of Kingdom of Serbia in to Kingdom SHS (later Kingdom Yugoslavia) no further officers where promoted to rank of Field Marshal. King of Yugoslavia held the rank of Supreme Commander and wear special Field Marshal uniform.|$|E

40|$|Unconventional {{textiles}} are goods {{obtained by}} methods {{other than the}} classic spinning, weaving and knitting. They are manufactured by mechanically or chemically reinforcing a fabric consisting of fiber layers {{or a combination of}} fiber, weaving, yarn or textile layers. Also, unconventional textiles can be obtained by mechanically or chemically reinforcing a yarn pattern or multiple yarn patterns. The tendency of the industry to increase production of synthetic fibers în comparison to natural fibers is also visible în the field of unconventional textiles. Additionally, there is more and more emphasis on using fibers recovered from recycled materials and products which resulted from a classic textile manufacturing process. A TUFTING product is made from a backing fabric, usually cloth, reinforced with yarn introduced through the fabric in loops spaced equally relative to the stitches, and raised at the ends. The fur substitutes can also be obtained with unconventional TUFTING technologies, by reinforcing a <b>backing</b> <b>cloth</b> and then undergoing a final reinforcement by raising and felting on one side. The TUFTING product obtained by reinforcing and weaving can be used în the manufacturing process because it is predisposed to unraveling and has an inadequate aspect.

40|$|Abstract: In Bangladesh, jute mills are {{producing}} conventional yarns heavier than 275 tex. These {{are used as}} hessian, sacking, carpet <b>backing</b> <b>cloth</b> etc. For diversified uses of jute it is most essential to produce medium count yarn of 241 to 275 tex. In this regard, slip draft spinning machine has been studied. This machine is capable to produce yarn of 241 to 280 tex at flyer speed of 2900 rpm to 4850 rpm. But there is a relation between flyer speed and yarn breakages of the machine. In addition spinning efficiency of the machine also depends on the yarn breakages. Through a series of experiment, a relation has been established between flyer speed and yarn breakages of the experimental machine for production of jute yarn...|$|E

Various physical properties, such as crease recovery, reduction in moisture content, moisture regain, tensile strength, flexural rigidity and dimensional stability of the crosslinked dyed fabrics were studied. It was found that there exists a direct relationship between resin add-on to the fabrics and significant improvement in dye fixation, crease recovery and reduction in moisture regain. Regarding all dyeing and physical properties Indosol E- 50 powder along with various reactive dyes achieved highly satisfactory results. Fixapret CPN may be comparable to Indosol E- 50 Powder...|$|E
