50|$|There are {{two main}} types of bidding boxes: the more common ones are free-standing, placed in the corners on the tabletop. The hanging variant is smaller, with two holders closer together, and {{attached}} {{to the side of}} the table using C-clamps. The latter has the advantage that it does not occupy space on the table, but it can hamper the players' passage to and from their seats, so it gets damaged more easily. In some tournaments an L-shaped metal bracket is slid under the tabletop corners, leaving its other end standing up. This is inserted into a slit in a free-standing bidding box, which then functions like a clamped one. Another alternative is to use side tables, so that bidding boxes as well as refreshments and other belongings can be kept off the playing table. For storage purposes, the boxes usually have either a covered compartment at the bottom to store the bidding cards or a cover which is placed over the bidding cards attaching to the <b>box</b> <b>base.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The [...] "short block" [...] of {{the engine}} {{is the same as}} other Land Rover 4.6 HSE models. Short-blocks used for the 4.6L Callaway engines were stamped with a 9.60:1 {{compression}} ratio marking from Land Rover. The increase of 0.25 points, up from the standard 4.6L compression ratio of 9.35:1 was achieved by a modification to the cylinder heads. The cylinder heads were also modified to improve the airflow {{into and out of the}} combustion chambers. The inlet manifold gasket front valley clamp has been changed to accommodate the heater hose positioning on the bottom front of the Callaway manifold. The ram pipe housing has been modified by shortening the ram pipe tube lengths. The intake runner lengths were tuned to increase both power and torque. The black plastic air inlet tube was replaced with a larger diameter fancy looking carbon fiber inlet tube to match the larger throttle bore in the plenum. The air cleaner <b>box</b> <b>base</b> was modified to increase the airflow. The Lucas GEMS ECU was calibrated to support the mechanical changes to the Callaway engine (the Callaway engine had the same basic FI as in 1998 and did not have the Bosch system that was on other 1999 HSEs).|$|E
5000|$|WGME began {{broadcasting}} in 720p High Definition on December 18, 2011 {{with a new}} set {{designed by}} Devlin Design Group. The newscasts also premiered a new graphics package, though opting to keep the standard Sinclair grey and black lower third. All other graphics were changed to a new, high-tech Sinclair standard package. Only two Sinclair stations (WZTV and WGME) use this new package. WGME's new High Definition set includes two video display monitors on {{either end of the}} set for anchor stand up reporting, a 12 monitor video wall which can display 3 video feeds (2x2 each), 2 videos feeds (2x3 each), one large panoramic video feed (2x6 which they use for a graphic of the Portland skyline), or 12 individual video feeds (one per monitor). WGME also has a small anchor desk at the video wall for their FOX 23 broadcasts, [...] "Good Day Maine" [...] and [...] "News 13 on FOX" [...] at 10PM. Their main anchor desk is larger than the Fox 23 anchor desk, though includes a similar style of a light <b>box</b> <b>base</b> with wood carved around it, as well as over the light box. The anchor desk includes a large monitor behind the anchors which shows a skyline image of Portland, ME, or during weather tosses, the [...] "News 13" [...] logo with clouds behind it in blue and red colors. The entire set includes an array of light panels and light boxes. Behind the anchors on top of the light boxes are square black panels that zig-zag behind the anchor TV monitor. The set includes a wood style from a brand native to Maine. The weather office is now open and fully visible to the viewers. The weather office is to the viewer's right, which includes a similar sized desk as to the FOX 23 anchor desk, for the meteorologist to open and close weathercasts with. Behind the desk includes 9 computers to operate the weather graphics and forecasting system which are on a raised platform so that viewers can see the station's other meteorologists working on severe weather reports live. Above these computers are another four monitors which can either broadcast a single video feed (1×4) for a panoramic view of the Portland Skyline, or can be individually manipulated to show weather graphics above the meteorologist. The set also includes a larger green screen to the viewer's right of the weather set.|$|E

40|$|We have {{reported}} previously (1) two unexpected {{consequences of the}} microinjection into fertilized mouse eggs of a recombinant plasmid designated p 12 B 1, carrying a 343 bp insert of non-repetitive mouse DNA. Injected at very low concentrations, this plasmid could be established as an extrachromosomal genetic element. When injected in greater concentration, an early arrest of embryonic development resulted. In the present work, we have studied this toxic effect in more detail by microinjecting short synthetic oligonucleotides with sequences from the mouse insert. Lethality {{was associated with the}} nucleotide sequence GTCACATG, identical with the CDEl element of yeast centromeres.

40|$|Ribonuclease III cleaves {{double-stranded}} (ds) {{structures in}} bacterial RNAs and participates in diverse RNA maturation and decay pathways. Essential insight on the RNase III mechanism of dsRNA cleavage {{has been provided}} by crystallographic studies of the enzyme from the hyperthermophilic bacterium, Aquifex aeolicus. However, the biochemical properties of A. aeolicus (Aa) -RNase III and the reactivity epitopes of its substrates are not known. The catalytic activity of purified recombinant Aa-RNase III exhibits a temperature optimum of ∼ 70 – 85 °C, with either Mg 2 + or Mn 2 + supporting efficient catalysis. Small hairpins based on the stem structures associated with the Aquifex 16 S and 23 S rRNA precursors are cleaved at sites {{that are consistent with}} production of the immediate precursors to the mature rRNAs. Substrate reactivity is independent of the distal box sequence, but is strongly dependent on the proximal box sequence. Structural studies have shown that a conserved glutamine (Q 157) in the Aa-RNase III dsRNA-binding domain (dsRBD) directly interacts with a proximal <b>box</b> <b>base</b> pair. Aa-RNase III cleavage of the pre- 16 S substrate is blocked by the Q 157 A mutation, which reflects a loss of substrate binding affinity. Thus, a highly conserved dsRBD-substrate interaction {{plays an important role in}} substrate recognition by bacterial RNase III...|$|E
40|$|MetR (formerly Smu. 1225), a {{regulator}} of the LysR family, controls key {{genes for}} methionine supply in Streptococcus mutans. An S. mutans metR mutant {{is unable to}} transport l-methionine and {{to grow in the}} absence of this amino acid. Accordingly, MetR activates transcription by binding to the promoter regions of two gene clusters and smu. 1487, whose products are involved in methionine biosynthesis (MetEF and Smu. 1487) and uptake (AtmBDE). Transcriptional activation by MetR requires the presence of a 17 -bp palindromic sequence, the Met <b>box.</b> <b>Base</b> substitutions in the Met box hinder the formation of a MetR-DNA complex and abolish MetR-dependent activation, showing that Met boxes correspond to MetR recognition sites. Activation by MetR occurs in methionine-depleted medium and is rapidly triggered under nonactivating conditions by the addition of homocysteine. This intermediate of methionine biosynthesis increases the affinity of MetR for DNA in vitro and appears to be the MetR coeffector in vivo. Homocysteine plays a crucial role in methionine metabolic gene regulation by controlling MetR activity. A similar mechanism of homocysteine- and MetR-dependent control of methionine biosynthetic genes operates in S. thermophilus. These data suggest a common mechanism for the regulation of the methionine supply in streptococci. However, some streptococcal species are unable to synthesize the homocysteine coeffector. This intriguing feature is discussed in the light of comparative genomics and streptococcal ecology...|$|E
40|$|Parent birds {{should be}} {{selected}} to choose nest sites {{and to build}} optimally sized nests, yet our current understanding of clutch size-nest size relationships is limited to small-scale studies performed over short time periods. Here, we quantified the relationship between clutch size and nest size, using an exhaustive database of 116 slope estimates based on 17, 472 nests of 21 species of hole and non-hole-nesting birds. There was a significant, positive relationship between clutch size and the base area of the nest box or the nest, and this relationship {{did not differ significantly}} between open nesting and hole-nesting species. The slope of the relationship showed significant intraspecific and interspecific heterogeneity among four species of secondary hole-nesting species, but also among all 116 slope estimates. The estimated relationship between clutch size and nest <b>box</b> <b>base</b> area in study sites with more than a single size of nest box was not significantly different from the relationship using studies with only a single size of nest box. The slope of the relationship between clutch size and nest base area in different species of birds was significantly negatively related to minimum base area, and less so to maximum base area in a given study. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that bird species have a general reaction norm reflecting the relationship between nest size and clutch size. Further, they suggest that scientists may influence the clutch size decisions of hole-nesting birds through the provisioning of nest boxes of varying sizes...|$|E
