Babyface recalled {{that he was}} nervous about recording with Madonna, since he feared that Madonna was a [...] "perfectionist" [...] in the studio, and that would ultimately be time consuming for the whole process. However, {{it was one of}} the fastest recording and mixing. The song was backed by a full orchestra and was also the first time that Babyface had worked with live strings.

500|$|For the Beatles' seminal 1967 album, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, Starr sang lead vocals on the Lennon–McCartney {{composition}} [...] "With a Little Help from My Friends". Although the Beatles {{had enjoyed}} widespread commercial and critical success with Sgt. Pepper, {{the long hours}} they spent recording the LP contributed to Starr's increased feeling of alienation within the band, he commented: [...] " [...] wasn't our best album. That was the peak for everyone else, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> {{it was a bit}} like being a session musician ... They more or less direct me in the style I can play." [...] His inability to compose new material led to his input being minimised during recording sessions; he often found himself relegated to adding minor percussion effects to songs by McCartney, Lennon and Harrison. During his down-time Starr worked on his guitar playing; he commented: [...] "I jump into chords that no one seems to get into. Most of the stuff I write is twelve-bar".|$|E
500|$|Moggach {{believed}} the novel was very filmable, [...] "despite it containing no description {{and being a}} very unvisual book". To Wright, many other period films had relied on paintings for inspiration rather than photographs, causing them to appear unreal. He thus used [...] "Austen's prose [...] many visual references {{for the people in}} the story", including using close-up shots of various characters. The filmmakers also changed several scenes to more romantic locales than those in the book. For instance, in the film, Darcy first proposes outdoors in a rainstorm at a building with neoclassical architecture; in the book, this scene takes place inside a parsonage. In the film, his second proposal occurs on the misty moors as dawn breaks; in the book, he and Elizabeth are walking down a country lane in broad daylight. Wright has acknowledged that [...] "there are a lot of period film clichés; some of them are in the film and some are not, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> it was important to question them".|$|E

500|$|In 1996, Lauryn Hill met Rohan Marley while touring as {{a member}} of the Fugees. The two {{gradually}} formed a close relationship, and while on tour, Hill became pregnant with his child. The pregnancy and other circumstances in her life inspired her to record a solo album. After contributing to fellow Fugees member Wyclef Jean's 1997 solo record The Carnival, Hill took time off from touring and recording due to her pregnancy and cases of writer's block. This pregnancy, however, renewed Hill's creativity, as she recalled in an interview several years later: [...] "When some women are pregnant, their hair and their nails grow, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> it was my mind and ability to create. I had the desire to write in a capacity that I hadn't done in a while. I don't know if it's a hormonal or emotional thing... I was very in touch with my feelings at the time." [...] Of the early writing process, Hill said, [...] "Every time I got hurt, every time I was disappointed, every time I learned, I just wrote a song." ...|$|E

His parents, Dorothy Helen (née Sheinheit) and Edward M. Brooks, were both {{salespeople}} (his mother sold children's clothes; his father furniture). The Brooks family was Jewish; Edward Brooks changed his surname from Bernstein and claimed to be Irish. Brooks' father abandoned his mother {{when he found out}} she was pregnant with him, and lost contact with his son when Brooks was twelve. During the pregnancy, Brooks' father sent his wife a postcard stating that [...] "If it's a boy, name him Jim." [...] His mother died when he was 22. He has described his early life as [...] "tough" [...] with a [...] "broken home, [...] poor and sort of lonely, that sort of stuff", later adding: [...] "My father was sort of in-and-out and my mother worked long hours, so there was no choice <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to be alone in the apartment a lot."

While the film was met with mixed reviews, it flopped at the box office, although it {{has gone on to}} become something of a cult classic. Throughout the rest of the decade, she took mostly supporting roles in films and occasionally considered leaving the business, but: [...] "there were always little bites. Whenever I felt I {{was at the end of}} my rope, something would come up. Something bad. <b>But</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> it was 'work begets work'; that was my motto." [...] In 1996, she starred alongside Joe Mantegna, Kelly Lynch and J.T. Walsh in George Hickenlooper's action-thriller Persons Unknown; alongside James Earl Jones, Kevin Kilner and Ellen Burstyn in the period drama Timepiece; in Bermuda Triangle, a TV pilot that was not picked up for a full series, where she played a former documentary filmmaker who disappears in the Bermuda Triangle; and as the lead role in , in which children in a small town become possessed under the command of a wrongfully murdered child preacher.|$|E

In a win over Ball State on December 13, he recorded 11 points and a season-high 9 rebounds. However, on December 20, he separated his left shoulder after grabbing a team-high 8 rebounds vs Cincinnati. It was estimated by head coach Jeff Neubauer that he would miss a few weeks due to a torn labrum. Oppong was absent for the Colonels' five next games. He recalled the moment saying, [...] "Cincinnati {{was one of our}} best games, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> I really don't like that game. It was when I actually dislocated my shoulder. And it hurt—it really hurt. The process of coming back was so hard because it took so long. When I got back, it took me a minute {{to get back into the}} flow and get adjusted." [...] Oppong return on January 15, 2009, against Eastern Illinois, and did not make another start that season until a loss to Morehead State at the 2009 Ohio Valley Conference Men's Basketball Tournament. Through the whole season, Oppong averaged 9.2 points, 5.4 rebounds, and 1.2 assists. He was one of Eastern Kentucky's rebounding leaders.|$|E
500|$|Đurić {{was drafted}} into the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) {{at the age of}} 17, and became an officer during his service. With the {{impending}} Bosnian War, his father wanted either him or his brother to leave the country in order to preserve the family line. He was instructed to leave his hometown as he was younger and a sportsman. Đurić recalls: [...] "My father fought in this war, my brother for almost five years and my mother was killed in 1993 by the Muslim army. They bombed our village and it hit my home directly. A really big bomb and my mother died instantly [...] So many people like me lost mothers and fathers in this bloody civil war <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> I hold no grudges. I don’t look at race, I look at people by their hearts and here in Singapore I adopted a Muslim child." [...] With just 300 Deutsche Marks on him, Đurić left for Serbia where he played football in the second division for one season and then Sweden, where he trained with AIK and was offered refugee status which he rejected. The breakup of Yugoslavia left him stranded in Hungary without a recognised passport. He wandered through the cafes and restaurants of Szeged before a family offered him accommodation and a trial at local club Szeged LC in the second tier of the Hungarian football league.|$|E
500|$|The film {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics, {{particularly for the}} work of its technical crew. In 2006, W.Chandrakanth of The Hindu wrote: The greatness of the director lies here– he successfully reduces all characters to ordinary mortals displaying all the follies of human beings except Ghatothkacha or Krishna. And then he injects into the Yadava household a Telugu atmosphere, full with its simile, imagery, adage, sarcasm and wit. The result– a feast for the eyes and soul. That is Mayabazar for you. Vijaysree Venkatraman wrote for The Hindu in 2008 that the [...] "special effects in this summer's Hollywood superhero movies were spectacular, <b>but,</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> the mythological [...] hasn't lost any of its magic", adding, [...] "If watching the genial half-demon polish off a wedding feast single-handedly remains a treat, seeing the greedy duo from the groom's side get whacked alternately by the furniture and the wilful carpet has me in splits". The Hindu film critic M.L. Narasimham wrote: [...] "Though there were several movie versions in various Indian languages, the 1957 Vijaya Productions' Mayabazar is still considered the best for its all round excellence". According to The Times of India, [...] "With a powerful cast and a strong script, this movie is a stealer. Savitri, NTR , ANR , SVRangarao and not to mention Suryakantam add layers to their characters. Of course, the language and the dialogues, simply unbeatable.

500|$|Despite general favor from female viewers' perspective, {{reaction}} from most male viewers was negative.

D'Angelo made an appearance at the WQHT Hot 97 studio as the DJ's Angie Martinez and Funkmaster Flex fielded calls from listeners about the video.

Some of the men said things like: 'We don't wanna see that kind of stuff. Why do {{we have to look at}} that?' Men definitely seem to be threatened by male nudity". Some viewers and music writers have attributed the male discomfort of the video to fear of male sexual objectification and homophobia. In a 2000 phone interview for The New York Times, D'Angelo maintained a neutral attitude towards general viewer opinion of the video, stating [...] "With men, if there's any negative reaction, I'm not really going to get an honest feedback ... women love it, most definitely. <b>But</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> personally, the response I've got from both men and women has been pretty cool".|$|E

[...] The band practiced in Iyall's flat in Mission District. It was decided that the group would embrace punk ideals despite the possibility that they become associated with the new wave movement. [...] "Even though I was going to the [...] so much, I also had criticisms: Everyone was leaning against the wall wearing black," [...] Iyall said. [...] "I guess we were considered new wave, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> Romeo Void was a reaction against the regimentation of everyone having to be bleached blond and everything being about despair and no future, when I thought the do-it-yourself thing should encompass all the different kinds of emotions, and all the different colors.
