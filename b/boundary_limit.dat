2500|$|For example, in {{ontology}} Vollenhoven {{opposed the}} notion of a concept of being that encompasses God, cosmos, and the human being. Vollenhoven’s primary distinction was that of the Trinity, who is, the law for the cosmos that holds, and the created cosmos, which is entirely sustained by God. In connection with the cosmos, different fundamental aspects (“law-spheres”) are distinguished—fifteen of which have been made explicit—in which creatures function. As to the human being, outwardly its functions are “structured throughout,” inwardly there is the direction-determining soul or heart, “out of which are the issues of life.” The law, which in a generic sense forms a <b>boundary</b> <b>limit</b> for created reality, involves a three-fold specification: (i) there is the creation command (the “let there be …” of Genesis 1) relevant to “the origination, structure, whereby is implicit its modal diversity , and the internal development of each kingdom”; (ii) the love command, which “concerns the [...] direction of human life in its relation to God and fellow human being”; and (iii) the positive laws, which “bridge the love command and the concrete situation” in need of regulation “in light of society’s purpose, historical phase, and geographical location.” ...|$|E

40|$|The {{extraction}} of the Time-to-boundary function (TtB) from CoP data in upright stance trials has recently gained much attention. In this contribution, some parameters extracted from TtB in unperturbed upright stance trials were analysed {{in terms of}} variability with respect to different hypothesized stability limits. In particular, nonlinear stability factors were analyzed {{as a function of}} the different values for the <b>boundary</b> <b>limits</b> through which TtB is calculated. A sample population of 5 healthy young adults underwent upright stance trials in different conditions. The amplitude nonlinear stability factors showed a strong dependency with the <b>boundary</b> <b>limits,</b> which on the contrary did not affect the rhythmical nonlinear stability factor...|$|R
