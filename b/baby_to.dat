5000|$|There is a {{baby boom}} of the post-war United States; an overworked stork (a clear Jimmy Durante reference) gets drunk in the Stork Club. There is an {{emergency}} delivery in which inexperienced animals, mostly older animals but including four crows attempting to deliver an elephant, take the <b>babies</b> <b>to</b> their parents. As a result, babies are getting sent to the wrong parents (such as a <b>baby</b> skunk <b>to</b> a goose, a <b>baby</b> kitten <b>to</b> a duck, a <b>baby</b> gorilla <b>to</b> a kangaroo, a <b>baby</b> hippopotamus <b>to</b> a Scottish Terrier, a <b>baby</b> alligator <b>to</b> a pig and a <b>baby</b> cat <b>to</b> a mouse).

5|$|Benny Chan {{described}} the filming process {{as some of}} the darkest days of his career, explaining that the baby was a factor beyond his control, and could not work more than eight hours a day. Whenever a scene involving the baby was shot, the crew members had to be silent, communicating in sign language. Benny Chan stated it took time, patience, and money to guide the baby through each shot, and numerous retakes were required due to the baby's constant crying and napping. As a result, production went over budget. Special methods were sometimes used to coax the baby into co-operation. One scene required the <b>baby</b> <b>to</b> suckle Chan's nipple. The baby was initially hesitant, but relented after the crew brushed a large amount of honey onto the nipple.|$|E
