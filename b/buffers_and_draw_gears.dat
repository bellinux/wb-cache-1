40|$|This {{paper is}} focused on the vehicle {{dynamics}} caused by the forces exchanged, through <b>buffers</b> <b>and</b> <b>draw</b> <b>gears,</b> by consecutive vehicles on a curve. The results have been obtained by adding a buffers/draw gears contact model on an existing multibody code, previously developed by the authors. The multibody code manages rigid bodies connected by elastic and rigid constraints; the wheel/rail contact model is three dimensional and employs an elastic constraint among wheel and rail. The wheel/rail contact is managed by means of a numerical model called TOAM (third order approximation method). Numerical tests and experimental validations of the proposed model are here presented, considering a train made by three vehicles, running on an S shaped curve, subjected to parametric compressive forces...|$|E

5000|$|The trains were to use {{equipment}} {{based on}} the British Rail Mark 4 coaches modified for long distance service. All the cars were air-conditioned with power operated doors and {{designed to meet the}} safety standards of each country they would run through, the most stringent of these requirements being for the Channel Tunnel. A fleet of 139 cars were originally ordered, broken down as 47 seated cars, 72 sleeper cars and 20 service vehicles. The cars would have normally been configured as 9 seven-car and 9 eight-car sub-sets, with four spares (two seated cars and two service vehicles). The trains would have run as either individual sub-sets (for beyond London services and to some European destinations), or as two sets coupled together (from London and through the Tunnel). As the trains were designed to run as fixed formation sub-sets, only the two outer ends of each sub-set had <b>buffers</b> <b>and</b> <b>draw</b> <b>gear.</b> The sub-sets would have been configured as follows: ...|$|R

40|$|Rubber {{is a very}} {{flexible}} material with many desirable properties Which enable its broad use in engineering practice. Rubber or rubber-metal springs are widely used as anti-vibration or anti-shock components in technical systems. Rubber-metal springs are usually realized as a bonded assembly, however especially in shock absorbers, {{it is possible to}} realize free contacts between rubber and metal parts. In previous research it authors was observed that friction between rubber and metal in such case have a significant influence on the damping characteristics of shock absorber. This paper analyzes the development process of rubber or rubber-metal shock absorbers realized free contacts between the constitutive parts, starting from the design, construction, testing and operation, with special emphasis on the development of rubber-metal springs for the buffing <b>and</b> <b>draw</b> <b>gear</b> of railway vehicles...|$|R

The large bogie boxvans for car parts, used on the Victorian Railways, were fitted with gooseneck couplers for that reason.|$|R

30|$|TEM {{image of}} PMNPs is {{demonstrated}} in Fig.  3 B. There {{are dozens of}} darker spots corresponding to the Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticle in every single particle, which implies the strong magnetic field response of obtained nanomaterials. Vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) spectra showed that the saturation magnetization of the nanoparticles decreased accordingly; when it had been doped into silica nanoparticles and experienced further surface modification by APS and PBA, the resulted PMNPs demonstrated superparamagnetic property (Fig.  1 C (2 – 4)); after the modification, the saturation magnetization of the blocked PMNPs was 26.6  emu/g. And it could be easily dispersed in alkaline <b>buffer</b> <b>and</b> completely <b>drawn</b> from {{the solution to the}} sidewall of the vial by a magnet field within around 10  s (Fig.  3 C).

50|$|Prior to the {{modification}} of its intermediate <b>draw</b> <b>and</b> buffing <b>gear</b> {{to convert it}} to the Type XP1, the tender had already been modified. Most of the Type MP1 tenders were modified by shortening and raising {{the sides of the}} coal bunker, in effect making the coal {{at the rear of the}} bunker more easily accessible to the stoker and apparently without affecting the tender's coal capacity. The profile of the Type XP1 tender corresponds with the official dimensional drawing of such a modified Type MP1.|$|R
50|$|Two of the {{locomotives}} {{were later}} modified by the SAR. No. 745 {{was equipped with}} 1 in larger diameter tyres on its coupled wheels, while no. 746 was coupled to a modified Type MP1 tender. The intermediate <b>draw</b> <b>and</b> buffing <b>gear</b> of the tender, no. 1634 off a Class MC1 Mallet locomotive, was altered to suit no. 746. This modification converted tender no. 1634 to the sole Type XP1 tender. While it had the same coal capacity as the Type XM2 with which the locomotives were delivered, it had a 250 imp gal larger water capacity.|$|R

Spur gear {{is one of the}} most commonly used component in power transmission between two parallel shafts, they are widely used in mechanical power transmission. Engineering components made of composite materials have find increasing applications ranging from space craft to small instruments. Overwhelming advantages such as higher dimensional stability, light weight, and minimal attack by environment when compared with other ordinary cast steel gears. Modern level advanced carbon composite materials have opened a new level of soundless, high resilience, lubricant free and precision gearing in power and motion transmission. A proper understanding and prediction of gear failure is an important pre-requisite for any reliable application. In this project, a spur gear is designed using advanced modelling software (Solidworks) and is meshed and analyzed using analysis software by the application of torque load. Finally, by comparing the analysis result of both composite spur gear and the existing cast steel spur gear...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{a system for}} scripting and editing graphic procedures with graphic representations or "icons. " The icons are small bitmap images that carry with them information about spatial placement, list placement, and pointers to procedures. Icons have been created and connected {{to a series of}} image transformation procedures. Two interactive graphic software packages have been written, one for producing icons and one for scripting with icons. Icons can be created in two ways: (1) making bitmaps from frame <b>buffer</b> images <b>and</b> (2) <b>drawing</b> by grid filling. Scripts can be created in two ways: (1) by storyboa~ding icons or (2) by playing out a sequence of graphics and recording the list of events. Scripts can be edited, saved, re-edited, and played upon request. The software takes advantage of the ease with which computers can produce simplified, symmetrical, 1 -bit images and, by its structure, sets examples of iconic interaction. All interaction is done with puck, tablet, menus, and visual cues. Some pre-writing or picture-writing forms are described. A historical overview of computer icons is presented, using several key systems as examples. by Dorothy J. Shamonsky. Thesis (M. S. V. S.)

40|$|As {{technology}} scales, interconnect-centric design flows become {{imperative for}} achieving timing closure. Preplanning <b>buffers</b> <b>and</b> wires in the layout {{is critical for}} such flows. Both <b>buffers</b> <b>and</b> wires must be considered simultaneously, since wire routes determine <b>buffer</b> requirements <b>and</b> <b>buffer</b> locations constrain the wire routes. In contrast to recently proposed buffer-block planning approaches, our novel design methodology distributes a set of buffer sites throughout the design. This allows one to use a tile graph to abstract the <b>buffer</b> planning problem <b>and</b> simultaneously address wire planning. We present a four-stage heuristic called resource allocation for <b>buffer</b> <b>and</b> interconnect distribution for resource allocation that includes a new, efficient technique for buffer insertion using a length-based constraint.
