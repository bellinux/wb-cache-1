5|$|Addressing the mercantilist {{belief that}} {{monetary}} intervention {{could cause a}} perpetually favourable <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade,</b> Cantillon developed a specie-flow mechanism foreshadowing future international monetary equilibrium theories. He suggested that in countries with a high quantity of money in circulation, prices will increase and therefore become less competitive in relation to countries {{where there is a}} relative scarcity of money. Thus, Cantillon also held that increases in the supply of money, regardless of the source, cause increases in the price level and therefore reduce the competitiveness of a particular nation's industry in relation to a nation with lower prices. However, Cantillon did not believe that international markets tended toward equilibrium, and instead suggested that government hoard specie to avoid rising prices and falling competitiveness. Furthermore, he suggested that a favourable <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> can be maintained by offering a better product and retaining qualitative competitiveness. Cantillon's preference towards a favourable <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> possibly stemmed from the mercantilist belief in exchange being a zero-sum game, in which one party gains at the expense of another.|$|E

5|$|In this period, Germany {{was still}} in a dire {{economic}} situation as millions were unemployed and the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> deficit was daunting.

5|$|The EU – Turkey Customs Union in 1995 {{led to an}} {{extensive}} liberalisation of tariff rates, and forms {{one of the most}} important pillars of Turkey's foreign trade policy.

5|$|In {{the interim}} between the Import Duties Act and the Ottawa Conference, Chamberlain {{presented}} his first budget, in April 1932. The gold standard {{had been abandoned}} {{in the early days}} of the National Government; the Bank of England sought its restoration. Chamberlain, on advice from his officials, declined to restore the gold standard, realising that a devalued pound would improve the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade.</b> Otherwise, Chamberlain maintained the severe budget cuts that had been agreed to at the inception of the National Government: Chamberlain cut means-tested benefits and public sector wages, which proved to be an unpopular move. He also cut interest rates, which led to a house-building boom in the south of England and supported plans to clear slums. Interest on the war debt had been a major cost in each budget. Chamberlain was able to reduce the interest rate on most of Britain's war debt from 5% to 3.5%. Between 1932 and 1938, Chamberlain halved the percentage of the budget devoted to payment of interest on the war debt.|$|E

25|$|The {{effect of}} the 1974–85 period's {{industrialization}} on the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> was significant. The <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> moved from an average deficit of US$3.4billion in the 1974–76 period to an average surplus of US$10.7billion in the 1983–85 period. In 1985 the share of manufactures (processed and semi-processed) of total exports reached 66 percent, and between 1971–75 and 1978–83 the share of basic input imports in total imports declined from 32.3% to 19.2%. The recession and stagnation of the early 1980s {{had a role in}} reducing imports. However, import substitution was also important, as demonstrated by the few years of the 1980s that experienced a significant growth in GDP while the trade surplus was maintained.|$|E

25|$|Postwar world {{capitalism}} {{suffered from}} a huge dollar shortage. The United States was running huge <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> surpluses, and the U.S. reserves were immense and growing. It was necessary to reverse this flow. Even though all nations wanted to buy US exports, dollars {{had to leave the}} United States and become available for international use {{in order for them to}} do so. In other words, the United States would have to reverse the imbalances in global wealth by running a <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> deficit, financed by an outflow of US reserves to other nations (a US financial account deficit). The US could run a financial deficit by either importing from, building plants in, or donating to foreign nations. Recall that speculative investment was discouraged by the Bretton Woods agreement. Importing from other nations was not appealing in the 1950s, because US technology was cutting edge at the time. So multinationals and global aid which originated from the US burgeoned.|$|E

But {{hand in hand with}} her foreign investments have grown her adverse <b>balances</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade.</b> For the ten years ending with 1868, her average yearly adverse balance was 52,000,000 pounds; ending with 1878, 81,000,000 pounds; ending with 1888, 101,000,000 pounds; and ending with 1898, 133,000,000 pounds.

30|$|Using a dataset of 101 {{countries}} {{over the}} 1960 – 2011 period, {{we examine the}} relationship between the real effective exchange rate (REER), on the one hand, and trade openness, <b>trade</b> <b>balance,</b> the terms <b>of</b> <b>trade,</b> factor productivity, and exchange rate regime, on the other one. We use new econometric estimators that deal with the problems of potential endogeneity and cross-sectional dependence that are present in the data, while also allowing for cross-country heterogeneity in the parameters of interest. The findings of the study strongly support the hypothesis that an increase in trade openness produces a depreciation of the REER.
