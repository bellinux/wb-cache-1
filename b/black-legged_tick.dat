We mimic natural infections in mice using the vector (<b>Black-legged</b> <b>ticks,</b> Ixodes scapularis) and examine the im-munological and behavioral responses of mouse hosts. Despite producing antibodies against B. burgdorferi, infected mice did not have elevated white blood cells compared with uninfected mice. In addition, infected and uninfected mice did not differ in their wheel-running activity. Our results suggest that infection with the spirochete B. burgdorferi has little impact on the field activity of white-footed mice.

Despite densities of mice that fluctuated two orders of magnitude, average larval and nymphal tick burdens per mouse remained remarkably constant. Spatial variability in mouse density and tick burdens was modest. The {{total number of}} larval and nymphal ticks that fed on the mouse pop-ulation each year depended strongly on population density of mice; a steady increase was observed in both mouse density and total tick meals on mice from 1996 through 1999. The result was a steady increase in the infection prevalence of nymphal and adult ticks with the etiological agent of Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi, over this time.

B. burgdorferi sensu stricto is genetically variable {{and has been}} divided into three major genotypes based on 16 S- 23 S ribosomal DNA spacer (RST) analysis. To better understand how genetic differences in B. burgdorferi sensu stricto may influence transmission dynamics in nature, we investigated the interaction between an RST 1 and an RST 3 strain in a laboratory system with P. leucopus mice and I. scapularis ticks. Two groups of mice were infected with either BL 206 (RST 1) or B 348 (RST 3). Two weeks later, experimental mice were challenged with the opposite strain, while control mice were challenged with the same strain as that used for the primary infection. The transmission of BL 206 and B 348 from infected mice was then determined by xenodiagnosis with uninfected larval ticks at weekly intervals for 42 days. Mice in both experimental groups were permissive for infection with the second strain {{and were able to}} transmit both strains to the xenodiagnostic ticks. However, the overall transmission efficiencies of BL 206 and B 348 were significantly different. BL 206 was more efficiently transmitted than B 348 to xenodiagnostic ticks. Significantly fewer double infections than expected were detected in xenodiagnostic ticks. The results suggest that some B. burgdorferi sensu stricto strains, such as BL 206, may be preferentially maintained in transmission cycles between ticks and white-footed mice.

Over the past two decades, the geographic range of I. pacificus has changed modestly while, in contrast, the I. scapularis range has expanded substantially, which likely contributes to the concurrent expansion {{in the distribution of}} human Lyme disease cases in the Northeastern, North-Central and Mid-Atlantic states. Identifying counties that contain suitable habitat for these ticks that have not yet reported established vector populations can aid in targeting limited vector surveillance resources to areas where tick invasion and potential human risk are likely to occur. We used county-level vector distribution information and ensemble modeling to map the potential distribution of I. scapularis and I. pacificus in the contiguous United States as a function of climate, elevation, and forest cover. Results show that I. pacificus is currently present within much of the range classified by our model as suitable for establishment. In contrast, environmental conditions are suitable for I. scapularis to continue expanding its range into northwestern Minnesota, central and northern Michigan, within the Ohio River Valley, and inland from the southeastern and Gulf coasts.

40|$|Lyme disease, a tick-borne {{bacterial}} illness, is {{the most}} common vector-borne infection in north temperate areas worldwide. Ticks, while minute in size, can be competent vectors of both human and animal diseases. Upon hatching, larvae must take a blood meal in order to transform into the next life stage. When taking this first blood meal, the larval tick may ingest blood containing pathogens. If this occurs, the newly emerged nymphal tick is capable of transmitting infection to the next host, which can become infected and, if reservoir competent, infective. When the pathogen carrying vector is attached long enough, a host can acquire the infection. Through this process, the disease is amplified and transmitted between several hosts. While often not the first animals to be considered effective reservoirs of Lyme disease, wild birds do indeed serve as hosts to the Ixodes scapularis ticks that transmit the infection. Certain bird species, such as the American Robin, have been shown to sustain enough of the infectious agent, Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria, to be transmitters of the pathogen to subsequent feeding <b>ticks.</b> These <b>black-legged</b> <b>ticks</b> then feed on other hosts, such as domestic and wild animals and humans, and can infect susceptible hosts through saliva during feeding. Although not well known, several factors can affect the associations between wild birds and ticks, influencing the likelihood of tick recruitment, attachment, and drop-off time. By compiling and analyzing data from field studies on Fire Island, NY, the dynamics of bird-tick associations were investigated here. The factors focused on in this research were the following: bird body temperature, bird body weight, and Lyme disease infection status. Several species were studied and comparisons made between birds of the same species and those with similar characteristics. Through the available data and analyses, conclusions about the conditions surrounding successful tick attachment, feeding, and possible disease transmission can be made. Surprisingly, no correlation between tick recruitment and bird foraging habitat was found. Also, no concrete findings of the effects of bird body temperature and weight on tick attachment could be confirmed, possibly because of low power in the statistical analyses. However, there was a significant relationship between infection status in certain bird species, Gray Catbird and Song Sparrow, and tick drop-off time. Because of the transmission delay between tick attachment and host infection, this potentially has important implications for the spread of Lyme disease. Further investigation into the associations between wild bird species and infectious ticks is essential to a better understanding and improved control of the disease. Revealing the factors that influence this interaction has the potential to allow for new prevention techniques and a {{reduction in the number of}} Lyme disease cases in this endemic area...|$|R
40|$|CWD and Human Health: “There {{currently}} {{is no evidence}} that Chronic Wasting Disease in Cervidae is transmitted to humans”… • SCWDS recently completed the fieldwork of a research project to investigate the epidemiology of avian vacuolar myelinopathy (AVM), previously known as the Avian Brain Lesion Syndrome (ABLS). • NIH Funds SCWDS Ehrlichiosis Study: Since 1985, three new tickborne zoonoses caused by bacteria in the genus Ehrlichia have been recognized in the United States. Human monocytotropic ehrlichiosis (HME) caused by E. chaffeensis occurs across a broad area of the eastern and south-central United States. HME is transmitted by lone star ticks (Amblyomma americanum). Human granulocytotropic ehrlichiosis (HGE) caused by a currently unnamed organism closely related to or perhaps identical with E. equi or E. phagocytophila has been diagnosed mainly in the northeastern, upper midwestern, and western United States. HGE is transmitted by <b>black-legged</b> <b>ticks</b> (Ixodes scapularis and I. pacificus). A combined total of over 1, 200 cases of HME and HGE were diagnosed in people between 1986 and 1997. The third zoonotic ehrlichiosis, caused by E. ewingii, was diagnosed in four people from Missouri in 1999. Ehrlichia ewingii is known to occur in dogs in several other states in the eastern United States and is transmitted by lone star ticks. • Bovine tuberculosis (TB) recently was found in an eighth domestic cattle herd in Michigan. All TB-positive cattle herds and the single hunting enclosure containing captive deer with TB were located in the northeastern portion of Michigan’s lower peninsula where TB is endemic in free-ranging deer. • Lead Poisoning at a Shooting Range: In May 1999, a yellow-rumped warbler and a gray squirrel found at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) in Glynn County, Georgia, were submitted to SCWDS for diagnosis of central nervous system disease. Lead poisoning was diagnosed in both animals. • SCWDS Research Coordinator Sam Linhart retired this June after 10 years with our organization. • New AVMA Euthanasia Panel American Veterinary Medical Association News from the WDA Conference [...] the Annual Meeting of the Wildlife Disease Association: • Towerkills: Dr. Don Forrester, with the University of Florida, indicated that U. S. bird mortality due to tower collisions was estimated at 1 million birds in the 1980 s and 2 to 4 million birds in the late 1990 s. • Bovine TB Transmission: A series of experiments conducted at the USDA 2 ̆ 7 s National Animal Disease Center supports the epidemiologic investigation of the bovine tuberculosis (TB) problem in Michigan whitetailed deer. • Deer Adenovirus: Fatal systemic adenovirus was reported in a captive moose calf in Wyoming. • Mycoplasma gallisepticum Conjunctivitis: An outbreak of ocular disease was reported in evening grosbeaks and pine grosbeaks in Quebec, Canada. • Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) : Sequential sacrifice of experimentally infected mule deer revealed that the CWD agent {{can be found in the}} cervical lymph nodes within 3 months, and it has reached the brain by 6 months. • Recent SCWDS Publications Availabl...|$|R
40|$|Ticks (Acari: Ixodida) are {{arthropod}} ectoparasites {{dependent on}} a bloodmeal from a vertebrate host at each developmental stage for completion of their life cycle. This tick feeding cycle impacts animal health by causing damage to hides, secondary infections, immune reactions and diseases caused by transmission of pathogens. The genus Ixodes includes several medically important species that vector diseases, including granulocytic anaplasmosis and Lyme disease. I. scapularis, commonly called the <b>black-legged</b> or deer <b>tick,</b> is a medically-important tick species in North America and therefore was the first tick genome to be sequenced, thus serving as an important resource for tick research. This Primer focuses on the normal developmental cycle and laboratory rearing of I. scapularis. Definition of normal morphology, along with a consistent source of laboratory-reared I. scapularis, are fundamental for all aspects of future research, especially the effects of genetic manipulation and the evaluation of tick vaccine efficacy. Recent research important {{for the advancement of}} tick research, namely the development of tick cell culture systems for study of ticks and tick-borne pathogens, RNA interference for genetic manipulation of ticks and discovery of candidate antigens for development of tick vaccines, are briefly presented along with areas to target for future research. The preparation of this chapter was partially supported by the EU FP 7 ANTIGONE project number 278976, and the Walter R. Sitlington Endowed Chair for Food Animal Research to K. M. Kocan.
