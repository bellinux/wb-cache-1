2500|$|A {{direct action}} group, CountyWatch, {{was formed in}} 2004 to remove what its members {{consider}} to be wrongly placed county <b>boundary</b> <b>signs</b> that do not mark the historic or traditional county boundaries of England and Wales. They have removed, resorted or erected a number of what they claim to be [...] "wrongly sited" [...] county <b>boundary</b> <b>signs</b> {{in various parts of}} England. For instance, in Lancashire 30 signs were removed. CountyWatch has been criticised for such actions by the councils that erected the signs: Lancashire County Council pointed out that the taxpayers would {{have to pay for the}} signs to be re-erected.|$|R

Emma Road and the Angeles National Forest boundary, goes through pinyon pine and California juniper woodland. In the springtime, flannelbush and goldenbush bloom in this area. After the <b>boundary</b> <b>sign,</b> the pinyon pines disappear and Great Basin sagebrush becomes more dominant.|$|E

5000|$|Bovey Tracey (...) is a {{small town}} and civil parish in Devon, England, on the edge of Dartmoor, its {{proximity}} to which gives rise to the [...] "slogan" [...] used on the town's <b>boundary</b> <b>signs,</b> [...] "The Gateway to the Moor". It is often known locally as [...] "Bovey". It is about 10 miles south-west of Exeter and lies on the A382 road, about halfway between Newton Abbot and Moretonhampstead. The village is at the centre of the electoral ward of Bovey. At the 2011 census the population of this ward was 7,721.|$|R

The Abram Circle is a dance native to Abram and is [...] "renowned to morris dancers". The Abram Morris Dancers' logo appears on the <b>boundary</b> <b>signs</b> for the village.|$|R
50|$|Positioning of {{the county}} <b>boundary</b> <b>sign</b> on the A4101 in the early 1980s gave the {{impression}} {{that half of the}} tennis/netball courts and 2/3 of one of the football pitches were in the county of Staffordshire rather than West Midlands. The sign was moved sometime in the 1990s, aligning it with the west edge of the school grounds. Had this not happened, it would have meant that the new school building would have appeared to be in two counties.|$|E

40|$|Continuing our run of amusing names related photos—many {{thanks to}} Julia Stanbridge who {{forwarded}} this splendid {{picture of the}} sign for Cowgate in Edinburgh. Thanks also to Pam Combes who has found an interesting vein of pseudo Latin street-names. As she says: “I had a very fruitful day in St Leonards last Saturday and since the name Lavatoria {{is no longer in}} use I was pleased to find a large scale OS showing it. I suppose if you are {{the type of person who}} calls some of your children Septimus, Octavia and Decimus – Lavatoria and Mercatoria as street-names are perfectly normal. The Bohemia photo in the header strap comes from the same sequence. Please do continue to send photos for this slot as well as more general ones. There appears to be much scope for humour. Welcome to another New Year of the SNSBI Newsletter. We have now reached issue 6 and it is hard to imagine that this new series has been running since the Autumn of 2010. As planned, we have a new set of photos as our strap banner at the head of our pages. I am indebted to Jillian Hawkins for the photo of the Kent county <b>boundary</b> <b>sign</b> and to Pam Combes for the Fonthill Farm sign and that for Bohemia Road. The sign for The Gordon Bennet Route is one of my own, taken on our trip to the annual conference in Ireland last year. I am very pleased to have received all these contributions but do please continue to send them. There is always a need for more photos. As you may remember from the last newsletter, I expect to be out of the country for much of the autumn this year. I am delighted to tell you that Kate Hardcastle has agreed to step in as guest editor for the Autumn 2013 issue. I will forward to her any material for the autumn issue which reaches me before I go away. However, I’m sure that she will be grateful to receive any contributions and if you need to contact her nearer the time, her email addres...|$|E
2500|$|Humberside was not well-loved: {{to quote}} James Cran, MP for Beverley, [...] "almost {{the day after}} the {{decision}} was announced a campaign began to have Humberside abolished". [...] North Wolds Borough Council changed its name to East Yorkshire Borough Council, probably to emphasise its history, and Beverley Borough Council formally included [...] "East Yorkshire" [...] in its name. [...] According to Cran, there was a campaign in 1987 to get Humberside County Council to change its name to something like [...] "East Yorkshire and North Lincolnshire". The county's <b>boundary</b> <b>signs,</b> particularly in the East Riding of Yorkshire, continually suffered vandalism.|$|R
5000|$|The BBC and Tyne Tees Television filmed CountyWatch {{removing}} the <b>boundary</b> <b>signs</b> at Royal Oak. Twelve signs with, [...] "County Durham: Land of the Prince Bishops" [...] were removed. Three {{of them were}} re-erected along the historic border between Yorkshire and Durham [...] - [...] the River Tees, also the current ceremonial border. The Council were informed by CountyWatch of {{the location of the}} other signs they removed. Durham County Council issued a statement saying that CountyWatch's actions were [...] "nothing more than sheer vandalism, no less mindless or anti-social than smashing bus stops or phone boxes".|$|R
5000|$|A type of epenthesis in sign {{language}} {{is known as}} [...] "movement epenthesis and occurs, most commonly, during the <b>boundary</b> between <b>signs</b> while the hands move from the posture required by the first sign to that required by the next.|$|R
2500|$|The {{historic}} {{counties of}} England were established for administration by the Normans, {{in most cases}} based on earlier kingdoms and shires established by the Anglo-Saxons and others. [...] They ceased {{to be used for}} administration with the creation of the administrative counties in 1889. They are alternatively known as ancient counties or traditional counties. Where they are not included among the modern counties of England they are also known as former counties. [...] Despite this name, several historic counties continue to be recognised as cultural regions and have their own county days, county flags and <b>boundary</b> <b>signs,</b> many of which were created or registered long after these counties were abandoned as units for administrative purposes.|$|R
5000|$|On January 16, 1987, Councilwoman Joy Picus {{accepted}} petitions representing 3,364, or 77% of the 4,333 {{households in}} the area within her councilmanic district, and she immediately said she would direct the city's transportation department to put up <b>boundary</b> <b>signs</b> as the residents requested. Many of the latter expected the name change to add thousands of dollars of value to their properties. Two weeks later Picus added another two-mile-wide section of Canoga Park that gave West Hills the Fallbrook Mall and Platt Village shopping centers, along with several smaller retail strips and some older residential tracts built in flatland areas. This addition was denounced by Schiffman, who said it did [...] "a lot to erode the community identity we sought." ...|$|R

40|$|Marked by {{brownfield}} areas, {{the contemporary}} city {{looks like an}} untidy scenery, without <b>boundaries,</b> <b>signed</b> by buildings often no more useful for the original functional needs. Urban empty spaces penetrate into the neighbourhoods, without any formal logic, in a crescendo sometimes difficult to deal with. The process of starting from the classification of derelict  State assets, in the perspective of their valorisation, turns out as a description at {{the basis of the}} project. This issue opens a wide reflection, under both descriptive and planning points of view, though it is now in a dynamic evolution and therefore uncertain. Our methodology, based on the evaluation of specific characteristics and indicators, addresses us to possibilities of effective regeneration interventions, but that is not enough; subsequently multi-objectives analyses should be used in order to develop wider decision-making dialectics about regeneration, avoiding choices made case by case...|$|R
40|$|The {{inductive}} learning is effective {{for a variety}} of natural language processing problems. However, it needs expensive training data. The quality of learned rules often depends on the quality of training data used. In this paper, we propose a method to detect errors in training data automatically {{to improve the quality of}} the training data. We consider a Japanese word segmentation problem, in which training data means the corpus including word <b>boundary</b> <b>signs.</b> We use two clues to detect errors. One is a property of a decision list, and the other is the nature of Adaboost. In experiment, we provided 100 doubtful instances from the Kyoto Univeristy Corpus, which is the most trustworthy Japanse tagged corpus. Most of them had tags which we could not easily determine to be correct or incorrect. Moreover 21 instances were actually errors. ...|$|R
