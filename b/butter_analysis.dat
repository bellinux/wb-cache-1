The solid fat content for all samples at all measured temperature showed the sharp melting properties {{in a range of}} 15 to 30 C. A-PMF showed higher SMP (34 C) compared to others and the lowest was D-EIE fat (31 C) which means that the structured CBS is softer.

40|$|The {{editors of}} this Cambridge {{workbook}} should be congratulated for its success in rendering medical ethics lively, enticing, and user-friendly.

40|$|In {{the last}} years, {{there has been}} a growing demand by {{consumers}} for foods combining an increased nutritional value and benefits on human health. Butter enriched in unsaturated fatty acids/conjugated linoleic acids (UFA/CLA) could become a food with added value for its increased content in essential fatty acids, in vitamins and CLA, which has been reported to show potential anticarcinogenic and cholesterol lowering effects. The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the chemical composition and the sensory and odour profiles of UFA/CLA enriched butter in comparison to conventional butter. Their fatty acid composition, vitamin and metal ion contents were determined in both kinds of <b>butter.</b> Descriptive sensory <b>analysis</b> and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry coupled to olfactometry (GC/MS/O) were applied to UFA/CLA enriched and conventional butter. The UFA/CLA enriched butter contained significantly higher CLA than conventional butter. α-Tocopherol and iron contents were also significantly higher in UFA/CLA enriched butter. The sensory profile of the UFA/CLA enriched butter showed a less intense creamy odour and cooked milk aroma than conventional butter. UFA/CLA enriched butter revealed a better spreadability. The olfactometric results of the fresh butter samples indicated that the enriched butter had more intense green, sulphury and fruity notes, due to (Z) - 3 -hexenol, dimethyl disulphide, 2 -phenylethyl acetate and δ-decalactone, respectively, compared to conventional butter. ...|$|R
40|$|Aim There {{still is}} no good {{treatment}} available for children with subclinical hypothyroidism. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate whether a thyroid stimulating diet can normalize TSH values in children with subclinical hypothyroidism. Methods In this retrospective patient- control study 61 patients were included; 21 in the diet group, these children use the diet; and 40 in the control group. Of all children TSH was measured several times and also other characteristics, like clinical aspects during follow-up, were analyzed. The diet used in this study consists of beef, green vegetables, whole milk and <b>butter.</b> For statistical <b>analysis</b> we used the programme SPSS version 15. 0. The following statistical tests were used: Student’s T-test, Chi-square test, Fisher’s Exact test, logistic regression and McNemar’s test. Results The percentage patients in whom TSH normalizes with the diet is 77 %. Without diet this is 52 %. The difference in normalizing TSH between diet and control group, compared to the start values of TSH, gives an Odds Ratio of 4, 001 with a 95 % confidence interval of 0, 983 - 16, 291. The per protocol analysis gives an Odds Ratio of 8, 289 with a 95 % confidence interval of 1, 176 - 58, 409. In addition, it appeared that the complaints patients had before using the diet were reduced, especially fatigue. Conclusion This study shows that a thyroid stimulating diet gives a four times bigger chance to normalize TSH in children with subclinical hypothyroidism. A per protocol analysis shows an even eight times bigger chance. Our diet consist of ordinary, everyday food and is not harmful. Therefore we can advise our diet to children with subclinical hypothyroidism. ...|$|R

The flavor of butter oil directly affects the quality the end product. Thus, {{it is important to}} use the high quality butter oil which can be indicated by the extraction and analysis of volatile flavor compounds (VFC). Since the existing extraction technique prior to GC-MS analysis has deficiency in VFC extraction from oily sample, {{the first part of this}} research was devoted to the LDPE membrane pouch extraction. This method was developed to extract VFC from butter oil prior to GC-MS <b>analysis.</b> <b>Butter</b> oil represented for oily sample with complex flavor compounds. The butter oil was placed in the pouch and heat-sealed for extraction in diethyl ether. The extraction was taken at 40 ºC for 1 h and followed by GC-MS analysis. The result showed the wide spectrum of VFC including 12 fatty acids and 7 lactones, which characterized butter oil aroma. The separation of VFC from large molecules of triglycerides was explained by the molecular sieve effect of LDPE membrane. The relatively small and middle molecules such as VFC could diffuse through the amorphous region of the LDPE membrane while the relatively large molecules such as triglycerides in butter oil could not diffuse through the region. The percent recoveries of fatty acids and lactones by this method were 1. 00 - 1. 74 % and 10. 1 - 11. 2 %, respectively. Sensory evaluation of aroma recombinate and reference butter oil was assessed to indicate the accuracy of the extraction. The aroma recombinate was prepared from 12 odorants in the same concentration as determined in butter oil. The average sensory scores and standard deviations from 10 panelists showed that creamy odor and buttery odor had high scores in both butter oil and aroma recombinate. These odors characterized the main aroma of butter oil while sweet odor was undertone of the creamy odor. The sensory scores showed that the components extracted by LDPE membrane pouch method were matched the odor character in butter oil. The next part is specific lactone release from dehydrated butter oil by non-enzymatic treatment. The effect of moisture, temperature and storage time on lactone release in butter oil was studied. The accumulated lactone concentrations were determined along with moisture content in butter oil samples during storage. The dehydrated samples had moisture content reduced from 948 ppm to 280 ppm and were kept at 5 ºC or 20 ºC for 4 weeks. After storage, the samples were weekly extracted by LDPE membrane pouch method and analyzed by GC-MS for volatile flavor compounds. The lactone concentration highly increased in the first 2 weeks and remained at high level while there was no increase of free fatty acids. Lactones potential were also manipulated to determine the ability of the specific lactone release. The lactone formation mechanism was proposed with the intermediate structure of 6 -membered-ring, which composed of 4 - or 5 -hydroxy fatty acid glyceride ester and water molecule. Lactone potentials indicated that sample with approximately 750 ppm moisture content and kept at 20 ºC for 3 weeks gained the optimum condition for lactone release. δ-Tetradecalactone and δ-dodecalactone were predominance in the dehydrated butter oil which gave a pleasant and rich butter flavor after storage without enzyme application. In conclusion, LDPE membrane is recognized for its permeability and act as molecular sieve. In cooperated with organic solvent, LDPE membrane can separate small molecules such as volatile flavor compounds from large molecules of triglycerides. The method was developed to establish the efficient methodology for volatile flavor compound extraction from butter oil prior to GC-MS analysis without depending on specific apparatus. The generated lactones along with the former fatty acid were expected to characterize the buttery and creamy aroma for butter oil samples. The specific lactone release is the alternative method for lactone generation in flavor industry...|$|R
