5|$|In 1995 {{the group}} {{released}} a report, Digital Terrestrial Broadcasting in Australia, containing the preliminary {{conclusions of the}} group. It found that premature regulation of the new platform might stifle the market-driven development of the service, that it should <b>be</b> <b>based</b> <b>upon</b> existing standards, and should not restrict the ability of broadcasters to tailor local content. It was too early {{at the time to}} make decisions relating to what standard should be used, when transmissions should commence, and whether analog television should be phased out.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, Polistes exclamans was {{extending}} its range, spreading {{into the}} midwestern United States. Between 1958 and 1967 the following states had new state records of Polistes exclamans: Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey, New Mexico, Tennessee, and Virginia. The behavioral basis behind range expansion could <b>be</b> <b>based</b> <b>upon</b> the exceptional capability Polistes exclamans {{has in the}} colonization of new sites and the solitary nest founding behavior Polistes exclamans exhibits. This capability could be assisted by the “associated tendencies of P. exclamans foundresses to disperse and to move into newly available nesting sites.” Meanwhile, species with social foundresses reproduce near the place of origin and, therefore, do not extend their range as far.|$|E
5|$|Weber was {{concerned}} {{with the question of}} objectivity and subjectivity. Weber distinguished social action from social behavior, noting that social action must be understood through how individuals subjectively relate to one another. Study of social action through interpretive means (Verstehen) must <b>be</b> <b>based</b> <b>upon</b> understanding the subjective meaning and purpose that individuals attach to their actions. Social actions may have easily identifiable and objective means, but much more subjective ends and the understanding of those ends by a scientist is subject to yet another layer of subjective understanding (that of the scientist). Weber noted that the importance of subjectivity in social sciences makes creation of fool-proof, universal laws much more difficult than in natural sciences and that the amount of objective knowledge that social sciences may achieve is precariously limited. Overall, Weber supported the goal of objective science, but he noted that it is an unreachable goal– although one definitely worth striving for.|$|E

25|$|Choosing between {{investment}} projects will <b>be</b> <b>based</b> <b>upon</b> several inter-related criteria. (1) Corporate management seeks {{to maximize the}} value of the firm by investing in projects which yield a positive net present value when valued using an appropriate discount rate in consideration of risk. (2) These projects must also be financed appropriately. (3) If no growth is possible by the company and excess cash surplus is not needed to the firm, then financial theory suggests that management should return {{some or all of the}} excess cash to shareholders (i.e., distribution via dividends).|$|E
25|$|A {{classic example}} of fictitious force in {{circular}} motion is the experiment of rotating spheres tied by a cord and spinning around their center of mass. In this case, as with the linearly accelerating car example, the identification of a rotating, non-inertial frame of reference can <b>be</b> <b>based</b> <b>upon</b> the vanishing of fictitious forces. In an inertial frame, fictitious forces are not necessary to explain {{the tension in the}} string joining the spheres. In a rotating frame, Coriolis and centrifugal forces must be introduced to predict the observed tension.|$|E

25|$|Many modern {{scientists}} have also critiqued classical environmental determinism as unscientific. Carl Sauer criticized the premature generalizations resulting from bias in environmentalism in 1924. He argued that to define geography as {{the study of}} environmental influences is to assume in advance that such influences do operate, and that science cannot <b>be</b> <b>based</b> <b>upon</b> or committed to preconceptions. Furthermore, since evolutionary change manifests over very long time periods, some argue {{that the ability to}} adequately correlate human behaviour with any specific environmental condition is speculative at best and impossible at worst.|$|E
25|$|Contemporary responsa {{deal with}} both {{traditional}} questions and phenomena associated with modern social, religious, medical and technological developments. For example, Israeli astronaut Ilan Ramon noted that, while orbiting the earth, {{the space shuttle}} experiences a day/night cycle approximately every ninety minutes. Thus, Ramon asked whether he should keep the Sabbath according to Earth time, or mark it once every seven day/night cycles (ten and a half hours). And if according to Earth time, then what location on Earth should this <b>be</b> <b>based</b> <b>upon?</b> The rabbis concluded {{that he was to}} celebrate the Sabbath in accordance with Earth time, based on the place of his departure, Cape Canaveral.|$|E

25|$|Calvin took a {{mediating}} position between Luther and Zwingli {{regarding the}} sacrament of the Lord's Supper (also known as Communion). He held that Christ's body and blood are spiritually (rather than physically, as Luther insisted) conveyed to those who partake in faith. The people sat or knelt at a table to take communion. Calvin wished to have the Lord's Supper celebrated each Sunday, but was not allowed by the city council. Instead, it was celebrated every quarter, with an intense period of self-examination by the people beforehand. The determination of worthiness to receive the Lord's Supper was to <b>be</b> <b>based</b> <b>upon</b> trust in God alone for forgiveness of sin, repentance, and reconciliation with others, and the consistory was to keep watch to prevent flagrant, unrepentant offenders from partaking. Exclusion from the Lord's Supper was normally intended to be temporary, until the offender repented.|$|E
25|$|After a person, {{program or}} {{computer}} has successfully been identified and authenticated {{then it must}} be determined what informational resources they are permitted to access and what actions they {{will be allowed to}} perform (run, view, create, delete, or change). This is called authorization. Authorization to access information and other computing services begins with administrative policies and procedures. The policies prescribe what information and computing services can be accessed, by whom, and under what conditions. The access control mechanisms are then configured to enforce these policies. Different computing systems are equipped with different kinds of access control mechanisms—some may even offer a choice of different access control mechanisms. The access control mechanism a system offers will <b>be</b> <b>based</b> <b>upon</b> one of three approaches to access control or it may be derived from a combination of the three approaches.|$|E
25|$|Bradfield College {{was founded}} in 1850 by Thomas Stevens. Stevens had {{inherited}} the parish from his father in 1842, having been in his family for four generations. As a tribute to his father, he set about restoring the church. Sir Gilbert Scott (one of whose architect sons, John Oldrid Scott, was later to marry Thomas Stevens's eldest daughter, Mary Anne) was commissioned to effect the restoration. It was decided {{that the majority of}} the church, except the tower, should be demolished and rebuilt in a style influenced by that of gothic architecture. After the completion of the church in 1848, Stevens saw it fit to arrange a choir. While the whole village were able to sing, they were not felt to be of a high enough standard. It was proposed that a college be established at Bradfield, to be called St Andrew's College. The college was to be for the education of a limited number of boys between the ages of 8 and 12, with all to be from modest backgrounds. Their education was to <b>be</b> <b>based</b> <b>upon</b> 'true Church principles', with focus to be paid on reading, writing, mathematics, and music, and later on, classics and history.|$|E
