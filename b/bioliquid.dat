Biomass resources can be, and actually are used as fuel in CHP installations; however several hurdles have to be sorted beforehand, among the most important is the fact that biomass energy sources are not as energy intense as conventional CHP fuels. The ultimate outcome is a limited number of CHP units making use of biomass as fuel. Even fewer CHP units use <b>bioliquids</b> (e. g. : fast pyrolysis biomass liquids, biodiesel and vegetable oil).
