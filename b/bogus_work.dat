30|$|The Haṁsayogin’s Gītā is {{not read}} today and is widely {{considered}} to be a fake. But its historical significance ought not to be underestimated, chiefly in the way it inspired other scholars to also search for different recensions of the Bhagavadgītā. Here, we wish to focus on one such example: the Kashmir Gītā of F. Otto Schrader. As we have seen, in his search for an expanded version of the Bhagavadgītā, Schrader set out from this very edition as evidence {{for the fact that the}} Bhagavadgītā as found in the vulgate had not always been the normative version of the Bhagavadgītā. Thus he cited Edgerton’s assertion that “there is absolutely no documentary evidence that any other form of the Gītā than that which we have was ever known in India. This, of course, does not prove that none ever was known; but it leaves a strong burden of proof upon those who maintain such a theory.” 8 Against Edgerton, he argued: “one does not need to search far for the proof demanded by Edgerton. It is found, namely, in the Mahābhārata itself in the chapter immediately following the Bhagavadgītā.” Thereafter, citing the Gītāmāna śloka, he stated: “What does this mean? It simply cannot mean anything else than that the composer of these verses attributed to Vaiśampāyana had before him a different version of the Bhagavadgītā than that currently found in the Mahābhārata. Further, it also suggests the hypothesis that this other Gītā was older and that therefore not only the round verse number 700 but also the chapter number 18 according with the number of books of the Mahābhārata of the Gītā found in the current Mahābhārata is the result of a revision” (Schrader 1927, 172; Schrader’s emphasis). In pursuit of this thesis, Schrader first turned to a reconstruction of the Haṁsayogin’s Gītā on the basis of the introduction and the commentary on the first adhyāya, which is surprising since, as we have seen, both these contain sufficient clues to suggest that the edition was a <b>bogus</b> <b>work</b> 9; evidently Schrader was not sufficiently skeptical of the Haṁsayogin’s efforts or did not take the publisher’s and editor’s introductions with the seriousness they merited. 10 Thereafter, in later works, he turned to a reconstruction of the version of the Bhagavadgītā he considered to have been current in Kashmir. As this second of our bogus Gītās is of more interest to us here, we shall resume the story with Schrader’s arguments for a “Kashmir recension” of the Bhagavadgītā.|$|E

40|$|A typhoon bogus data {{assimilation}} (BDA) {{scheme is}} {{built in the}} MM 5 3 D-Var system with mainly three components: a) An algorithm to specify the typhoon bogus sea-level pressure (SLP) and wind pro-files is constructed in the MM 5 3 D-Var system based on the typhoon report issued by the regional ty-phoon center and the 3 D-Var background; b) The errors of the bogus observations are empirically as-signed according to {{our knowledge of the}} typhoon SLP and wind distributions; c) The MM 5 3 D-Var system includes typhoon bogus observation operators. Since typhoon bogus observations can have large differences from the 3 D-Var background fields, special treatment is made to allow the typhoon bogus data retained in the minimization procedure. Numerical experiments are conducted using Typhoon Rusa (2002) case in the Northwestern Pacific Ocean near landfall to the Korean Peninsula. It is indicated that the 3 D-Var <b>bogus</b> algorithm <b>works</b> well and can improve the prediction of typhoon track and intensity. With MM 5 3 D-Var BDA, the initial typhoon vortex is balanced with the dynamical and statistical balance embedded in the 3 D-Var system. It can generate a well-defined warm core structure in the typhoon initialization. Compared with bogus-sing in the 3 D-Var background fields, MM 5 3 D-Var BDA results in less spin-down/up problems in the subsequent typhoon forecast. Sensitivity experiments show that assimilation of the only bogus SLP data produces too strong a typhoon intensity, while assimilation of the only bogus wind data produces much weaker intensity prediction than the observations. Assimilation of both bogus SLP and wind data obtains the best initialization and prediction for this typhoon case. Its landfall location, time and inten-sity are very close to the observation in the experiment. 1...|$|R
40|$|This thesis explores how Ptolemy Chennus’ Novel Research blurs {{the lines}} between fact and fiction by playing with issues {{concerning}} authority and reliability, {{making it difficult for}} readers to discern the authentic from the <b>bogus</b> within the <b>work.</b> Matters are complicated because a complete version of the text does not survive, although it is possible to get an overall sense of the text from a book-by-book epitome of the work by Photius. This summary reveals that the text contained farfetched and eclectic material, drawing upon several literary traditions including, paradoxography, mythography, miscellany, and literary revisionism. The result is an unusual collection of elaborated “information” such as: revised myth, paradoxa, literary facts, questions and answers, and outlandish anecdotes mainly about legendary characters, although some historical figures also feature. Using Photius’ epitome I will take a thematic approach and explore how Ptolemy blends invented and revised material, and bogus and genuine sources, to produce a work of pseudo-scholarship that not only amuses but also challenges readers’ paideia. I will also establish how Ptolemy is aware of contemporary literary and cultural trends, as well as situate the Novel Research among other Imperial works of fiction to contribute to our understanding of Ptolemy and his work.

5000|$|It was {{completely}} implausible survey results such as these, {{as well as}} the sworn testimony of disenchanted employees or associates, that led to the recognition of the widespread fraud of Benson's group. Beginning about 1886, contracts held by certain surveyors thought to be aligned with Benson were not paid by the government, leading to various lawsuits. In 1887, forty one federal indictments for conspiracy and perjury were brought against Benson and several others, as mentioned in the Report quote above. However the trials, in federal district court, did not even occur until 1892, and when they did all were found innocent on legal technicalities. However their actual guilt was clear to everyone familiar with the facts, and surveyors associated with Benson had difficulty getting work. Because of this, Benson proposed what {{came to be known as}} the [...] "Benson Compromise" [...] in 1895 to the California Surveyor General, which proposed to correct or finish the survey work on several contracts that had never been paid out because government examiners had declared the <b>work</b> <b>bogus.</b> This compromise was accepted by the government, but little of this supposedly [...] "corrected" [...] work is reported to have ever been accepted by the Surveyor General as valid.|$|R
