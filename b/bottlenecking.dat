The {{first half of the}} 20th century saw declining populations of horses and mules due to increased mechanization, and, by 1945, Poitevin breeding was oriented towards the production of meat. The population dropped precipitously, and between 1970 and 1990 varied between 250 and 300 animals, with still lower levels seen in the early 1990s. A genetic study released in 1994 showed genetic <b>bottlenecking</b> and a severe risk of inbreeding, and led to the establishment of a conservation plan. Despite a slight increase in popularity {{at the beginning of the}} 21st century, the Poitevin is still in danger of extinction, with a slightly downward-trending population.|$|E

They {{are essentially}} caused by network <b>bottlenecks.</b> Therefore, understanding <b>bottleneck</b> dynamics {{is critical in}} the goal of reasonably allocating transportation resources. In general, a typical <b>bottleneck</b> experiences the stages of formation, propagation and dispersion. In {{order to understand the}} three stages of a bottle neck and how the <b>bottleneck</b> moves on a road network, traffic flow data can be used to reconstruct these dynamics. However, raw traffic flow data is usually flawed in many ways. For instance some portion of data may be missing due to the failure of data collection devices, or some random factors in the data make it hard to identify real <b>bottlenecks.</b> In this paper a "user voting method" is proposed to deal with such raw-data-related issues. In this method, road links are ranked according to the weighed sum of certain performance measures and the links that are ranked relatively high are regarded as recurrent <b>bottlenecks</b> in a network, and several <b>bottlenecks</b> form a <b>bottleneck</b> area. A series of <b>bottleneck</b> parameters can be defined based on the identified <b>bottleneck</b> areas, such as <b>bottleneck</b> coverage, <b>bottleneck</b> link length, etc. Identifying <b>bottleneck</b> areas and calculating the <b>bottleneck</b> parameters for each time interval can reflect the evolution of the <b>bottlenecks</b> and also help trace how the <b>bottlenecks</b> move...|$|R

40|$|The {{performance}} of a manufacturing or logistic system is determined by its constraints. Therefore, {{in order to improve}} the performance, it is necessary to improve the constraints, also known as the <b>bottlenecks.</b> Finding the <b>bottlenecks,</b> however, is not easy. This paper compares the two most common <b>bottleneck</b> detection methods, based on the utilization and the waiting time, with the shifting <b>bottleneck</b> detection method developed by us, for AGV systems. We find that the two conventional methods have many shortcomings compared to the shifting <b>bottleneck</b> detection method. In the example presented here, conventional methods are either unable to detect the <b>bottleneck</b> at all or detect the <b>bottleneck</b> incorrectly.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a novel method for detecting <b>bottlenecks</b> in manufacturing {{systems and the}} shifting of these <b>bottlenecks.</b> All manufacturing systems are constrained {{by one or more}} <b>bottlenecks.</b> Improving the <b>bottleneck</b> will improve the whole system. Yet, finding the <b>bottleneck</b> is no trivial task. Furthermore, the system may change over time or due to random events, and subsequently the <b>bottleneck</b> may shift from one machine to another machine. The shifting <b>bottleneck</b> detection method determines the <b>bottleneck</b> based on the duration a machine is active without interruption. The method is very robust, easy to apply and able to detect the primary and secondary <b>bottlenecks</b> {{in a wide range of}} production systems. This allows the use of simulation to predict <b>bottlenecks</b> for both steady state and variable systems. The measurement of the likelihood of a machine being the <b>bottleneck</b> aids in the decision-making regarding the allocation of the available resources. ...|$|R

For accurate <b>bottleneck</b> detection, {{it is necessary to}} determine the momentary <b>bottleneck</b> before making statistical conclusions. There are few methods that can detect the momentary <b>bottleneck</b> reliably, yet this is a key requisite for <b>bottleneck</b> detection in dynamic systems. <b>Bottleneck</b> detection methods that use averages overlook shifting <b>bottlenecks.</b> For a comparison of methods and their accuracy, see the forthcoming paper [25], where the <b>bottleneck</b> walk outperformed all conventional methods and was second only to the mathematically more demanding average active period method. If the duration of the averages is reduced and the observation is repeated frequently, then the effect of inventory buffers will likely diminish the accuracy of the observations.|$|R
