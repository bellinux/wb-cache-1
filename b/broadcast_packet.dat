50|$|Both Ethernet and IPv4 use an all-ones {{broadcast}} address {{to indicate a}} <b>broadcast</b> <b>packet.</b> Token Ring uses a special value in the IEEE 802.2 control field.|$|E
50|$|Each packet is retransmitted {{a minimal}} number of times, and covers the longest {{possible}} distance on each transmission. Some time is wasted {{by having the}} receiver <b>broadcast</b> <b>packet</b> information, but this is {{far less than the}} normal routing schemes, which can retransmit when an acknowledge message is lost.|$|E
5000|$|The term unicast {{refers to}} the method of a router {{sending a message to}} a single destination. Conventionally, this packet {{messaging}} method is considered more secure. This diagram illustrates the standard unicast packet send from one network host to another:When a switch receives a unicast packet with a destination address not in the switch’s forwarding table, the packet is treated like a <b>broadcast</b> <b>packet</b> and sent to all hosts on a network: ...|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} of <b>broadcast</b> <b>packets</b> (<b>broadcast</b> radiation) over a {{switching}} loop, the situation may develop into a broadcast storm.|$|R
3000|$|... can be {{explained}} like this: the k 1 parity check packets of the network code protect k 2 <b>broadcast</b> <b>packets</b> of terminals i(R(i) = 1) equally, and the mutual information transmitted by k 1 terminals (T(i) = 1) provides uniform contribution to k 2 <b>broadcast</b> <b>packets.</b>|$|R
50|$|The sending of UDP {{broadcasts}} on {{a network}} are always enabled on a datagram socket. In order to receive <b>broadcast</b> <b>packets,</b> a datagram socket should be bound to the wildcard address. <b>Broadcast</b> <b>packets</b> may also be received when a datagram socket is bound to a more specific address.|$|R
50|$|When an Internet Protocol (IP) {{datagram}} is {{sent from}} one host {{to another in}} a local area network, the destination IP address must be resolved to a MAC address for transmission via the data link layer. When another host's IP address is known, and its MAC address is needed, a <b>broadcast</b> <b>packet</b> is sent out on the local network. This packet is known as an ARP request. The destination machine with the IP in the ARP request then responds with an ARP reply that contains the MAC address for that IP.|$|E
50|$|When a host {{wishes to}} send a packet to a {{destination}} for the first time, it needs to determine an appropriate RIF. A special type of <b>broadcast</b> <b>packet</b> is used, which instructs the network bridges to append their bridge number and network segment number to each packet as it is forwarded. Loops are avoided by requiring each bridge to ignore packets which already contain its bridge number in the RIF field. At the destination, these broadcast packets are modified to be standard unicast packets {{and returned to the}} source along the reverse path listed in the RIF. Thus, for each route discovery packet broadcast, the source receives back a set of packets, one for each possible path through the network to the destination. It is then up to the source to choose one of these paths (probably the shortest one) for further communications with the destination.|$|E
30|$|Link Load (Figure 6)—this is {{calculated}} as the mean {{ratio of the}} number of nodes that transmit safety <b>broadcast</b> <b>packet</b> against the number of nodes that receive the packet. The lower this value the better as this indicates that fewer transmissions are needed to disseminate the <b>broadcast</b> <b>packet.</b>|$|E
30|$|Thirdly, {{owing to}} the <b>broadcast</b> <b>packets</b> with hash(ID), which hides the real ID of each member, the DES also {{provides}} simple anonymous communication. That means that other members cannot know which member <b>broadcasts</b> those <b>packets.</b>|$|R

40|$|MasterThere is {{a problem}} in {{spreading}} a <b>broadcast</b> <b>packet</b> in contention-based wireless networks like IEEE 802. 11 when available physical channels are not sufficient. The problem is that some nodes don’t receive the <b>broadcast</b> <b>packet</b> {{due to the fact that}} the frequency of packet collisions depends on the probability. Thus all the nodes may not receive the <b>broadcast</b> <b>packet</b> sent by the source node. It is against the purpose of broadcast that all the nodes in the network should receive the <b>broadcast</b> <b>packet.</b> The packet loss problem caused by collisions can be more serious in delivering a stream of broadcast data packets. We propose a broadcast tree which is dynamically modified depending on the channel status and a channel assignment algorithm which is reliable, fast and collision reducing for broadcast in multi-radio multi-channel multi-rate wireless mesh networks...|$|E
40|$|The Wi-Fi {{broadcast}} system using the <b>broadcast</b> <b>packet</b> transmits the multimedia contents to many local mobile users {{in real time}} and it must use the FEC technology to recover the <b>broadcast</b> <b>packet</b> loss, because Media Access Control layer retransmission is not supported for <b>broadcast</b> <b>packet</b> loss. Equally adding the redundant packet is not very efficient {{due to the nature}} of the multimedia data. So, several studies have been made on the Unequal Loss Protection (ULP). Proposed ULP system can efficiently add the redundant packet to the source video data with experimentally modeling the deterioration of video according to the <b>broadcast</b> <b>packet</b> loss in Wi-Fi based broadcasting system. In order to predict the video deterioration, we use the Expected Quality Ratio (EQR). It is a ratio of the video deterioration of compression to the video deterioration of packet loss. And, we design the framework of ULP system to predict the video quality using the EQR. We implement and experiment the proposed algorithm. Experiment results show how our algorithm outperforms other recovery methods of packet loss...|$|E

40|$|The {{clustered}} {{architecture of}} a mobile ad hoc network (MANET) has {{the virtue of}} keeping the node information locally which is suitable for scalability. Reducing broadcast redundancy in a clustered network can avoid the broadcast storm problem and save scarce resources such as bandwidth and energy. In this paper, we propose an approach that chooses a subset of nodes, called forward node set, to relay the <b>broadcast</b> <b>packet.</b> Each clusterhead computes its forward node set that connects its adjacent clusterheads. A non-clusterhead node just relays the <b>broadcast</b> <b>packet</b> if it is selected as a forward node or else it does nothing. Therefore, the broadcast operation can be restricted only to clusterheads and nodes in locally selected forward node sets. We also utilize the information of clusterheads that are piggybacked with the <b>broadcast</b> <b>packet</b> to further reduce each forward node set. Simulation shows its performance improvement against other broadcast algorithms...|$|E

50|$|Halvorsen {{and others}} show how {{to modify the}} Beck-Tews attack to allow {{injection}} of 3 to 7 packets having a size of at most 596 bytes. The downside is that their attack requires substantially more time to execute: approximately 18 minutes and 25 seconds. In other work Vanhoef and Piessens showed that, when WPA is used to encrypt <b>broadcast</b> <b>packets,</b> their original attack can also be executed. This is an important extension, as substantially more networks use WPA to protect <b>broadcast</b> <b>packets,</b> than to protect unicast packets. The execution time of this attack is on average around 7 minutes, compared to the 14 minutes of the original Vanhoef-Piessens and Beck-Tews attack.|$|R

Further, three protocol-independent modifications are presented. One aimed at ensuring that a <b>broadcast</b> <b>packet</b> traverses at least the ``shortest path'' to its destinations, and two aimed at increasing the fraction of nodes which receive a <b>broadcast</b> <b>packet.</b> Through simulation studies, we evaluate the performance characteristics of the broadcast protocols and generic modifications under different conditions...|$|E
