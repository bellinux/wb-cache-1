5000|$|In {{the sport}} of biathlon, because semiautomatic guns are illegal for race use, straight-pull actions are quite common, and are used almost {{exclusively}} on the world cup along with the Lateral Toggle action. The first company to make the straight pull action for [...]22 caliber was J. G. Anschütz; the action is specifically the straight pull ball <b>bearing</b> <b>lock</b> action, which features spring-loaded ball bearings {{on the side of}} the bolt which lock into a groove inside the bolt's housing. With the new design came a new dry-fire method; instead of the bolt being turned up slightly, the action is locked back to catch the firing pin. The two companies who have made the lateral toggle are Finn biathlon, as well as Izhmash. Finn was the first to make this type of action, however, due to the large swing of the arm as well as the stiffness of the bolt, these rifles fell out of favour and have been discontinued. Izhmash improved on the lateral swing with their Biathlon 7-3 and 7-4 series rifles, which have some use on world cups, but are largely thought of as inaccurate as well as having the inconvenience of having to remove the shooter's hand from the grip.|$|R
40|$|Implementing a {{predictive}} maintenance model {{does not have}} to be a five year, million dollar project. There are relatively simple steps a maintenance team can take to see results within the first year. Because overall cost of {{predictive maintenance}} is up to four time less expensive than preventative maintenance, as many assets as possible should be covered by predictive maintenance. Facilitating the transition to predictive maintenance is made easier with a Computerized Maintenance Management System. A good CMMS is user-friendly, automatically produces preventative maintenance work orders, and tracks all work done on each piece of machinery. IR scans and vibration analysis are two predictive maintenance techniques that can increase uptime. IR scans are an effective way to find loose or dirty electrical connections before they cause machine down time. Vibration analyses show bearing faults before the <b>bearing</b> <b>locks</b> up and destroys the journal. Fitesa Washougal is a single machine non-wovens facility in Washougal, Wa. In July 2014 the maintenance team at this facility implemented a new predictive maintenance model. A new CMMS was purchased to better manage assets and preventative maintenance activities. Vibration analysis was contracted to an outside company, and is now done monthly. IR scans are done in-house, with each cabinet in the program scanned quarterly. These actions have resulted in a 3. 5 % increase in uptime. Maintenance spending increased by 31 %, but unplanned maintenance downtime decreased by 34 %...|$|R

40|$|On publication, {{statement}} {{to be provided}} in the format: This is an Accepted Manuscript of an article published by Taylor & Francis in Structure and Infrastructure Engineering on 17 December 2015, available online: [URL] paper illustrates how long-term measurements can be analysed to understand bridge behaviour under changing environmental conditions and how the developed understanding can help explain the performance of its critical components. Measurements from the Cleddau Bridge, a structure that has been continuously monitored {{for more than two}} years, are used to investigate thermal effects in steel box-girder bridges and, in particular, their bearings. Observed temperature distributions are very different to the recommended distributions in design codes (BS EN 1991 - 5 : 2003). These temperature distributions create plan bending of the box girder, which in turn impose forces at the bearings that have contributed to its wear. This paper investigates bearing movements of the bridge using numerical models, and estimates the resulting forces at the supports. A physics-based model of the bridge is created to which temperature distributions inferred from in-situ measurements are supplied as input. Model predictions are validated against measured deformations at the bearings. Subsequently the model is used to predict forces at the bearings due to plan bending and <b>bearing</b> <b>locking.</b> Results quantify the impact that thermal effects have on the performance of the bearings. They also highlight the significance of considering a range of temperature distribution scenarios that go beyond those given in the design codes in order to reliably evaluate thermal effects at the design stage...|$|R

40|$|In rocket engines {{power is}} usually {{obtained}} by burning fuel and oxidizer which are mixed, pressurized, and directed to a combustion chamber {{by means of}} turbopumps. Roller bearings are generally used in these turbopumps, but because of bearing demands hydrostatic bearings were proposed. The use of such bearings is quite feasible because during flight hydrostatic lubrication can reduce roller bearing wear. A disadvantage of such proposals is that during startup, acceleration, and shutdown high pressure fluids are not available for hydrostatic bearings. The fluid lubrication film is not always present in bearings of turbopumps. During these periods a second bearing is required to carry the load. This requirement suggests the use of hybrid bearings in rocket engine turbopumps. Such duplex bearings were provided, but when their inner races are keyed to the shaft or journal {{two of them are}} required. And such duplex bearings do not wear evenly.

40|$|Background: The {{incidence}} of fractures in the trochanteric area has risen {{with the increasing}} numbers of elderly people with osteoporosis. Although dynamic hip screw fixation is {{the gold standard for}} the treatment of stable intertrochanteric femur fractures, treatment of unstable intertrochanteric femur fractures still remains controversial. Intramedullary devices such as Gamma nail or proximal femoral nail and proximal anatomic femur plates are in use for the treatment of intertrochanteric femur fractures. There are still many investigations to find the optimal implant to treat these fractures with minimum complications. For this reason, we aimed to perform a biomechanical comparison of the proximal femoral nail and the locking proximal anatomic femoral plate in the treatment of unstable intertrochanteric fractures. Materials and Methods: Twenty synthetic, third generation human femur models, obtained for this purpose, were divided into two groups of 10 bones each. Femurs were provided as a standard representation of AO/Orthopedic Trauma Associationtype 31 -A 2 unstable fractures. Two types of implantations were inserted: the proximal femoral intramedullary nail in the first group and the locking anatomic femoral plate in the second group. Axial load was applied to the fracture models through the femoral head using a material testing machine, and the biomechanical properties of the implant types were compared. Result: Nail and plate models were locked distally at the same level. Axial steady load with a 5 mm/m velocity was applied through the mechanical axis of femur bone models. Axial loading in the proximal femoral intramedullary nail group was 1. 78 -fold greater compared to the plate group. All bones that had the plate applied were fractured in the portion containing the distal locking screw. Conclusion: The proximal femoral intramedullary nail provides more stability and allows for earlier weight <b>bearing</b> than the <b>locking</b> plate when used for the treatment of unstable intertrochanteric fractures of the femur. Clinicians should be cautious for early weight <b>bearing</b> with <b>locking</b> plate for unstable intertrochanteric femur fractures...|$|R
40|$|Sit-snowboards allow {{a person}} with the {{inability}} to actively use his/her legs to snowboard while sitting. However, existing prototypes do not allow using a chairlift. The goal {{of this study was}} to modify a prototype sit-snowboard, MINI, to add chairlift accessibility. MINI has a seat construction and two handlebars which allow the user to steer the snowboard. After thorough assessment of all constructed design parameters the most important design parameters for this research were determined; 1) the sit-snowboard seat needs to turn 90 degrees with respect to the snowboard, 2) the tubes of the sitting construction have to be constructed differently to allow the chairlift seat to get under the sit-snowboard seat, and 3) the rear handlebar needs to make way to allow space for the chairlift. A redesign of MINI was made with a <b>bearing</b> and <b>locking</b> mechanism for the sit-snowboard seat and detachable handlebars with a locking mechanism. Subsequently the prototype, SnowGo, was built and tested on snowboard-functionality and chairlift accessibility. The test results show that with SnowGo, it is possible to use the chairlift and maintain the ability to sit-snowboard. Using the chairlift without tumbling over during loading and unloading requires practice, but the sit-snowboarder showed that he did not need a lot of practice with SnowGo since he was able to use the chairlift without falling in four out of five trials. Two advantages were that the safety-bar of the chairlift can be closed during the chairlift ride and that the chairlift can be used by the sit-snowboarder completely independent of any help from a second person.

40|$|Granted that palpable {{barriers}} — such as {{the operation}} fee, travel costs, childcare — hardly impede on-screen characters in search for an abortion, I felt compelled to coalesce the cringe-inducing reality of contemporary reproductive restrictions into a likewise dark comedy film. So, I co-wrote and directed a coming-of-age narrative about a twenty-something-year-old girl named Evelyn, who solicits cocaine {{in order to pay}} for her overpriced abortion. Clearly, the precocious protagonist obtains her personal reasons for revenge; however, not only does Evelyn’s decision underscore a sociological correlation between criminal depravity and a dearth of resources, but also beyond her white privilege, her logic duly begs an even more pressing question to the audience — does a girl who doles out drugs for money possess the moral fiber for motherhood — or at least at this stage of her nascent life? Even within the baby breadcrumbs of a crystallized canon, most pro-choice films tend to address abortion with a morally benevolent and relatable person; but in particular, the archetypal pattern conveys a leonine lady <b>bearing</b> blonde <b>locks</b> and a cherubic countenance that began with the iconic character Stacy Hamilton from Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982). Coincidentally, the protagonist Evelyn of my thesis film, “Sugar Daddy,” possesses uncanny similarities to six different lionlike female heroines. However, we sought to complicate our character with an anti-heroic homage to the brash brunettes who have also sought abortions in movies with watershed gumption; and moreover, give credence to the demographic discrepancies of diversity within the breadth of on-screen abortion. Therefore, we cultivated a panoply of polemical female characters — some more likable than others — in order to mirror the moral muck mired in an even more contentious, polarized debate of life, death, and above all — girl power.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} master {{thesis is}} to design an {{applicator}} which is able to apply an antibiotic hydrogel to prevent the risk of periprosthetic infections. These infections are a burden for the patient and are related to extra cost for the hospital and healthcare system. This graduation project is on behalf of Zimmer Biomet, TU Delft and is in collaboration with Reinier de Graaf Gasthuis in Delft. Zimmer Biomet {{is working on a}} new system that has to decrease the risk of periprosthetic infections. The new system has the main goal of preventing the formation of a biofilm by covering the surface of the implant. This hydrogel layer has to prevent that bacteria attach to the implant. In the analysis phase a visit to the Zimmer Biomet office in Berlin, observations in the operating theatre and interviews with experts are conducted to get insights and background information about antibiotics and total joint arthroplasty procedures. As result a design vision and list of requirements is created, which are used to generate ideas. Four ideas are developed into four concept directions. The strengths and weaknesses evaluation selected the spraying and dipping method as concept direction to be developed further. The project’s scope is narrowed down towards the cemented knee procedure. In the embodiment phase, the saw bone validation test showed that the dipping action is already covering {{a large part of the}} prosthesis. It is the main reason to focus on the dipping direction. Outcome of this project is a bearing dip set, which consists of the bearing dip tool and bearing dip tray. It is concluded that the bearing dip set is integrated better in the TKA work flow when compared to the DAC gel kit. This has as result that additional application time is not required. The bearing dip set is able to cover 93 % of the exposed implants surface. The bearing dip tool could be improved further in the current work flow when the tool is also able to insert the <b>bearing</b> in the <b>locking</b> system of the tibia plateau.

40|$|Pressure locked {{gratings}} {{have many}} uses, both {{on land and}} at sea. This is mainly due to {{the high degree of}} flexibility in dimensions and load bearing capacity. Despite the many uses in our surroundings, the term pressure locked grating is unknown to many. This term refers {{to the way in which}} the most important connection in pressure locked gratings is manufactured. Pressure locked gratings are galvanized and/or coated to prevent corrosion, galvanization is almost always used. This thesis is primarily focused on the behavior of galvanized pressure locked gratings. A pressure locked grating is made up of three type of bars: load bearing bars, cross bars and support bars. The connections between the load bearing bars and the cross bars are realized by pressing the cross bar into premade notch in the load bearing bar. The bars will deform plastically, which results in a connection based only on friction. This connection is called a pressure locked connection. The load bearing bars serve primarily for load transfer in one direction. The pressure locked connection weakens the load bearing bars. The cross bars redistribute a local load over the load bearing bars outside of the loading area and reduce the buckling length of the individual load bearing bar. The support bars are spot-welded to both the load bearing and cross bars. Pressure locked gratings are calculated according to RAL-GZ- 638, a standard published by the Deutsches Institut für Gütesicherung und Kennzeichnung e. V. In this standard, pressure locked gratings are calculated on the basis of linear elasticity theory. A calculation according to the EN 1993 - 1 - 1 is not possible because it is not suited for pressure locked gratings. The main objective of this thesis is to determine if a calculation based on the plasticity theory is possible for pressure locked gratings. Through the application of this theory the design strength can be greatly increased, which has a large economic potential. This research is divided up into four parts that are stated below. 9 ̆ 5 Analytical study 9 ̆ 5 Experimental study 9 ̆ 5 FEM validation 9 ̆ 5 Parametric study The vast diversity in size and properties and the complex functioning of the pressure locked connection make pressure locked gratings a difficult product to research. The pressure locked connection also has a big influence on the strength and stiffness. In this galvanizing has a big influence. The analytical study shows that pressure locked gratings fail through: local lateral torsional buckling of one of the load bearing bars, global lateral torsional buckling for the entire pressure locked grating or by a mechanism due to a plastic hinge in de load bearing bars. To research the behavior, numerical models were developed in the FEM-package ABAQUS. To determine the accuracy of these models, experiments were carried out on a number of pressure locked grating geometries. The results of the tests were compared with FEM simulations which made it possible to validate the FEM-models. The validation has taken place on the basis of four test series. Three test series focused on failure mechanisms, namely: collapse due to a mechanism as a result of plastic hinges in the load bearing bars, test series 1 A, collapse due to local lateral torsional buckling, test series 2 A and collapse due to global lateral torsional buckling of the entire pressure locked grating, test series 2 B. The last test series, test series 1 B, is aimed at examining the structural behavior of a common used pressure locked grating. After this validation it is possible to make FEM-models for a large number of different geometries. The behavior of these geometries can then be analyzed. The validation shows that failure mode and failure load are correctly determined by the FEM models. There is however a notable difference between the stiffness of the FEM-model and the stiffness of the test specimens. This difference is likely the result of the influence of the pressure locked connection between the load bearing and cross bars. The research shows that all aforementioned failure modes play a role depending on the dimensions of load bearing bars and cross bars. For relatively thick-set load <b>bearing</b> bars pressure <b>locked</b> gratings fail due to a mechanism as the result of plastic hinges in the load bearing bars. For slender load <b>bearing</b> bars pressure <b>locked</b> gratings fail as a result of instabilities. With the aid of FEM models, it is possible to estimate the extent in which the plastic capacity is present in actually produced pressure locked gratings. This analysis shows that in 72...|$|R
