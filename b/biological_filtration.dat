40|$|Since March 1995 Amsterdam Water Supply {{has applied}} <b>biological</b> {{activated}} carbon <b>filtration</b> (BACF) {{in the treatment}} process of the Leiduin plant. In this plant (capacity 70 × 106 m 3 /y) pretreated River Rhine water is infiltrated in the dune area, west of Amsterdam, for artificial recharge. Post treatment comprises rapid sand filtration, ozonation, hardness removal, <b>biological</b> activated carbon <b>filtration</b> and slow sand filtration. At the start the carbon reactivation frequency was set at 18 months, based on removal efficiencies for AOX (adsorbable organic halogens), DOC, pesticides and micropollutants. After four years of operation of a pilot plant (10 m 3 /hour) in parallel with the full-scale plant, the remaining removal capacity and the break-through profile of the carbon filters was investigated. In contrast to the full-scale plant, no carbon reactivation was applied in the pilot plant during the operation of 4 years. Spiking experiments were carried out after ozonation, in the influent of the <b>biological</b> activated carbon <b>filtration</b> with a cocktail of different pesticides after 1. 5, 3 and 4 years. Influent concentrations varied between 2 to 10 μg/l. Without carbon reactivation the filter effluent still complies with the Dutch drinking water standards and guide lines, {{as well as with}} the Amsterdam Water Supply standards: DOC is less than 2 mg/l (actually 1. 2 mg/l) and AOX remains below 5 μg/l. After four years, with spiking concentrations of 2 μg/l still no pesticide break-through was observed in the two-stage <b>biological</b> activated carbon <b>filtration</b> process. It can be concluded that a running time of 3 years between two reactivations in the two stage <b>biological</b> active carbon <b>filtration</b> is achievable, without negatively affecting the finished water quality. Average DOC concentrations will increase up to 1. 2 mg/l, from 1 mg/l with running times of 2 years. After four years or 100, 000 bedvolumes the AOC content is equal to or lower than 10 μg/l after <b>biological</b> activated carbon <b>filtration.</b> With slow sand filtration at the end and as polishing step AOC will be less than 10 - 5 μg/l. With every extension of six months duration time a saving of ε 305, 000 on reactivation costs is possible. With every 6 month extension of the running time of the carbon filters a saving of ε 610, 000 is realised on the reactivation costs of the Leiduin treatment plant...|$|R
25|$|A marine {{aquarium}} is an aquarium that keeps marine {{plants and animals}} in a contained environment. Marine aquaria are further subdivided by hobbyists into fish only (FO), fish only with live rock (FOWLR), and reef aquaria.

The minimum tank size for an adult {{of one of the}} smaller species (e.g. C. ocellaris) would be 180 gallons, and nothing less than a 300-gallon tank should be reserved for C. temensis. As with all specialty fish, buy healthy stock from a reputable dealer. [...] Tankmates should be other fish that are too large to swallow, such as arowanas, other large cichlids, and larger members of the Loricariidae family. The peacock bass produces more waste and uses more energy than a typical tropical fish, therefore significant <b>biological</b> <b>filtration</b> and aeration are necessary. [...] Water changes of up to 25% weekly are required with such messy fish. Feeding should be 2 to 3 times a day for young peacock bass (under 4"), decreasing to once a day as they get older, then as an adult they should be fed every other day just enough to round off their stomachs. Peacock bass can be trained to take pellets, though occasionally this is a challenge. Avoid feeding them live goldfish (bait minnows would be a better choice). Even if they do not accept pellets, they may still eat other foods such as krill, bloodworms, and silversides. [...] The temperature of the aquarium should range from 78 to 84°F. Temperature plays a big role on the looks, behavior, and feeding habits of the fish. Lower temperatures cause the fish to eat less, and reduces the efficiency of the immune system. Higher temperatures also affect aggression, making the fish more aggressive. A strong lid is an absolute must with these fish, as they will often bolt and attempt to jump out of the tank if startled. For the same reason, sharp decorations should be avoided in a Cichla tank.|$|E

40|$|Amsterdam Water Supply {{introduced}} ozone-{{activated carbon}} <b>filtration</b> (<b>biological</b> activated carbon <b>filtration)</b> {{in the production}} plant Leiduin in 1995. This full-scale plant (capacity 70 million m 3 yr- 1) {{can be characterized as}} an integrated treatment process. Experience since 1995 has revealed that <b>biological</b> activated carbon <b>filtration</b> has several benefits in integrated treatment processes. It is a very effective barrier for organics in general and for pesticides and organic micropollutants in particular. Due to the preceding ozonation both adsorption and biodegradation take place, resulting in a very long lifetime of the carbon filters (2 years). The ozonation significantly increases the disinfection capacity of the plant. Together with the other process steps, the disinfection capacity is at such a high level that, in combination with the biological stability of the finished water and good engineering practice in the distribution system, no chlorination has to be applied to guarantee hygienic quality. The process stability of the final treatment step, slow sand filtration, is, importantly, increased by the introduction of ozone-activated carbon filtration. Running times of the slow sand filters are longer than 2 - 3 years, while before the introduction of ozone-activated carbon filtration they never exceeded 1 year. In integrated membrane processes [...] which may be used in the treatment plant Leiduin in the future and therefore are being tested on pilot plant scale [...] ozone-activated carbon filtration also offers many advantages. In a reverse osmosis pretreatment scheme, comprising ozone-activated carbon filtration and slow sand filtration, the reverse osmosis system was shown to have a running time of I year without any membrane cleaning, due to the excellent reverse osmosis feed water quality. The application of ozone-activated carbon filtration also enables the use of electrodialysis as an alternative for reverse osmosis in an integrated membrane system.

50|$|Filtration is any {{of various}} mechanical, {{physical}} or biological operations that separate solids from fluids (liquids or gases) {{by adding a}} medium through which only the fluid can pass. The fluid that passes through is called the filtrate.

However, the separation is not complete; solids will be contaminated with some fluid and filtrate will contain fine particles (depending on the pore size, filter thickness and <b>biological</b> activity). <b>Filtration</b> occurs both in nature and in engineered systems; there are biological, geological, and industrial forms. For example, in animals (including humans), renal filtration removes wastes from the blood, and in water treatment and sewage treatment, undesirable constituents are removed by absorption into a biological film grown on or in the filter medium, as in slow sand filtration.|$|R
