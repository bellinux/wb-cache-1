40|$|The Io-Jupiter {{interaction}} generates strong decametric radio emissions (DAM), {{which appear}} as arcs in the time-frequency plane. These emissions are <b>beamed</b> at an <b>angle</b> from {{the magnetic field}} lines, which may vary with frequency and longitude amongst other properties. Empirical models of this <b>beaming</b> <b>angle</b> describe {{the shape of the}} DAM arcs and offer insight into the emission mechanism for DAM. Several studies have investigated the variation in the emission <b>beaming</b> <b>angle.</b> The studies span a range of frequencies which depend on the observational means (spacecraft, ground-based radio telescopes) used to obtain data. Subsequently, because of the varying assumptions made (e. g. relativistic vs. non-relativistic electrons for the wave polarization), methods used (e. g. prescribing a <b>beaming</b> <b>angle</b> function vs. determining a <b>beaming</b> <b>angle</b> function from observational geometry) and frequency ranges observed, different results have been found in each study. In the present paper, we model the shape of the emission with an empirical <b>beaming</b> <b>angle</b> function and adjust the parameters to best fit the emission arcs. However, our model builds on previous models by taking into account the location of Io in the Jovian magnetic field. We also look at a broader frequency range than many of the intermediate studies. We find that a simple empirical <b>beaming</b> <b>angle</b> function describes the shape of the A, B, and D arcs and that the <b>beaming</b> <b>angle</b> function must decrease at high and low frequencies. We then propose a simple explanation for the <b>beaming</b> <b>angle</b> profile, deduced from cyclotron maser theory. Copyright 2008 by the American Geophysical Union...|$|R

50|$|A further array-based switch engine uses {{an array}} of {{individual}} reflective MEMS mirrors to perform the necessary beam steering (Figure 5 (to be uploaded). These arrays are typically a derivative of the Texas Instruments DLP range of spatial light modulators. In this case, {{the angle of the}} MEMs mirrors is changed to deflect the beam.

5000|$|Beam angle may be {{as tight}} as 8 to 10 degrees in extreme cases, or as wide as around 140° with a plain flat glass port.

50|$|The {{resulting}} <b>beam</b> <b>angles</b> {{for such}} a system were generally too wide to be used directly for gun laying. For instance, the US's SCR-268 had a beam width of 2 degrees, and once the target entered that beam, the operator could not easily say where in the beam it was. An angle accuracy of about 0.1 degree would be needed for direct gunlaying. In early use the system was simply paired with a searchlight, which would be directed to the target by the radar, and then the gunners would aim visually. In this role, even during the day, the range information the radar provided was still invaluable.|$|E

This interchangeability of the lenses is often considered an advantage, since traditional PAR fixtures require a stock of different lamps to achieve various <b>beam</b> <b>angles.</b> This allows for a great amount of flexibility from a single fixture.|$|E
5000|$|For bombing use the {{modifications}} to Lorenz were fairly minor. Much larger antennas {{were needed to}} provide the required accuracy.

The <b>beam</b> <b>angles</b> were so dramatically reduced that {{it was only a few}} tens of yards wide over the target. It was the shape of the aerials that gave the system its code name, Knickebein, which means [...] "crooked leg". For the required range, transmitted power was increased considerably. The Knickebein receivers were disguised as a standard blind landing receiver system, consisting apparently of the EBL-1 and the EBL-2 receivers.|$|E

40|$|A {{new concept}} of using an {{electrically}} insulating beam as a constraint is proposed to construct planar spring-like electro-thermal actuators with large displacements. On {{the basis of}} this concept, three types of microspring actuators with multi-chevron structures and constraint beams are introduced. The constraint beams in one type (the spring) of these devices are horizontally positioned to restrict the expansion of the active arms in the x-direction, and to produce a displacement in the y-direction only. In the other two types of actuators (the deflector and the contractor), the constraint beams are positioned parallel to the active arms. When the constraint beams are on the inner side of the active arms, the actuator produces an outward deflection in the y-direction. When they are {{on the outside of the}} active arms, the actuator produces an inward contraction. Finite-element analysis was used to model the performances. The simulation shows that the displacements of these microspring actuators are all proportional to the number of the chevron sections in series, thus achieving superior displacements to alternative actuators. The displacement of a spring actuator strongly depends on the <b>beam</b> <b>angle,</b> and decreases with increasing the <b>beam</b> <b>angle,</b> the deflector is insensitive to the <b>beam</b> <b>angle,</b> while the displacement of a contractor actuator increases with the <b>beam</b> <b>angle...</b>|$|R

40|$|Equispaced beam {{arrangements}} are typically used for IMRT plans. This beam arrangement provides adequate dose coverage {{to the target}} while sparing dose to other structures. However, an equispaced beam arrangement may not provide the best dose coverage to the target while sparing dose to the other structures. Beam angle optimization attempts to optimize the beam directions to produce a better IMRT plan; this is achieved by increasing dose to the target while minimizing dose to the remaining structures. Most methods of beam angle optimization attempt to optimize the <b>beam</b> <b>angles</b> and the beam intensity profiles to find an optimal set of <b>beam</b> <b>angles.</b> This thesis attempts to optimize the <b>beam</b> <b>angles</b> without determining the beam intensity profiles. An MCNP simulation is run to score the beam directions; the simulation is run as an adjoint problem to reduce simulation time, with the target as the source and the detectors scoring the dose for the gantry angles of the beam. Then, an optimization algorithm is run to select a set of <b>beam</b> <b>angles</b> for an optimized IMRT plan. The optimized IMRT plan is compared to an equispaced IMRT plan on a commercial treatment planning system to determine if this method of beam angle optimization is better than using an equispaced beam arrangement.

40|$|Beam {{orientation}} optimization (BOO) is a {{key component}} {{in the process of}} IMRT treatment planning. It determines to what degree one can achieve a good treatment plan quality in the subsequent plan optimization process. In this paper, we have developed a BOO algorithm via adaptive l_ 1 minimization. Specifically, we introduce a sparsity energy function term into our model which contains weighting factors for each beam angle adaptively adjusted during the optimization process. Such an energy term favors small number of <b>beam</b> <b>angles.</b> By optimizing a total energy function containing a dosimetric term and the sparsity term, we are able to identify the unimportant <b>beam</b> <b>angles</b> and gradually remove them without largely sacrificing the dosimetric objective. In one typical prostate case, the convergence property of our algorithm, as well as the how the <b>beam</b> <b>angles</b> are selected during the optimization process, is demonstrated. Fluence map optimization (FMO) is then performed based on the optimized <b>beam</b> <b>angles.</b> The resulted plan quality is presented and found to be better than that obtained from unoptimized (equiangular) beam orientations. We have further systematically validated our algorithm in the contexts of 5 - 9 coplanar beams for 5 prostate cases and 1 head and neck case. For each case, the final FMO objective function value is used to compare the optimized beam orientations and the equiangular ones. It is found that, our BOO algorithm can lead to beam configurations which attain lower FMO objective function values than corresponding equiangular cases, indicating the effectiveness of our BOO algorithm.

40|$|Introduction: The {{selection}} of suitable <b>beam</b> <b>angles</b> and weights in external-beam radiotherapy is at present generally {{based upon the}} experience of the planner. Therefore, automated {{selection of}} <b>beam</b> <b>angles</b> and weights in forward-planned radiotherapy will be beneficial. Material and Methods: In this work, an efficient method is presented within the MATLAB environment to investigate how to improve the dose distributions by selecting suitable coplanar <b>beam</b> <b>angles</b> and weights for the beam. In the beam angle and weight selection algorithm, the optimal <b>beam</b> <b>angles</b> and weights correspond to the lowest objective function value of the dose distributions of each group of candidate beams. Optimal weights and angles reach a balance between all the objectives. In this work, we used a genetic algorithm and adopted a real-number encoding method to represent both beam weights and angles with an assignable number of repetitions. For the evolution of this algorithm, we used both monophasic and biphasic methods. In monophasic evolution, the chromosome containing the weights and angles is evolved in a single phase. In biphasic evolution, the chromosome is evolved while keeping one parameter (e. g., weight) constant and then, in the second phase, the evolution is continued while keeping the other parameter (e. g., angle) constant. The dose calculation was carried out using “correction-based techniques”. Result: Simple and simulated clinical cases are presented to test the algorithm. They show that the biphasic evolution requires more computation time compared to monophasic (typically 40 and 20 minutes respectively) but results in a better optimization. Conclusion: The results show the efficacy of the algorithm and its fairly acceptable computation time...|$|E
