5|$|Later on, it is <b>Bigger</b> Brothers Day in Marine World, {{where the}} <b>Bigger</b> Brothers and their boys attend to {{celebrate}} (including Homer, Tom, Bart, and Pepi). After running into Homer, Tom begins to brawl with him, {{in a fight}} which rages across Springfield. In the end, Homer winds up getting poked on the back by a fire hydrant, breaking his spine, much to Tom's shock. As a result, Homer is sent to a hospital on a stretcher, and Bart holds himself responsible for this. Later on, Tom sadly talks {{about how much he}} will miss being a <b>Bigger</b> Brother, while Pepi is sad over losing his <b>Bigger</b> Brother. Fortunately, Bart suggests Tom become Pepi's big brother, to which they happily agree, and both Tom and Pepi walk out into the sunset holding hands. At the same time, Homer (whose back is now fixed) and Bart reconcile, as Homer teaches Bart how to brawl due to his experience with Tom.|$|E
5|$|After soccer practice, Bart {{waits for}} Homer {{to pick him}} up, though his father has forgotten. When Homer finally remembers, he reasons to an angered Bart that they should just both admit they are wrong and try to put the issue behind them. Later, Bart views a {{commercial}} for a mentor program called The <b>Bigger</b> Brothers, which pairs up fatherless boys with positive male role models. Still angry at Homer, Bart goes to the agency {{pretending to be a}} young boy whose father was a drunken gambler who abandoned him. Bart's story is so sad that the receptionist pairs him up with their best <b>Bigger</b> Brother, a military test pilot named Tom. The two spend time together doing a variety of activities, though Bart begins to feel guilty over taking up Tom's time despite not actually being fatherless. Eventually, Homer finds out about Bart's <b>Bigger</b> Brother and confronts Bart for it. Homer then decides to go to the <b>Bigger</b> Brothers Agency to get revenge by being assigned with a replacement son; a young poor boy named Pepi. Just like Tom and Bart, Homer and Pepi spend time together doing activities.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bigger</b> {{guns were}} developed, {{and in the}} 15thcentury became an {{alternative}} to siege engines such as the trebuchet. The benefits of large guns over trebuchets– the most effective siege engine of the Middle Ages {{before the advent of}} gunpowder– were those of a greater range and power. In an effort to make them more effective, guns were made ever <b>bigger,</b> although this hampered their ability to reach remote castles. By the 1450s guns were the preferred siege weapon, and their effectiveness was demonstrated by Mehmed II at the Fall of Constantinople.|$|E

5|$|Team Razer faced Firestorm3 {{in their}} first battle of the series grand final, in a rematch from the All-Stars semi-final from earlier that year. Whilst victory in that battle had been {{relatively}} straightforward, Firestorm3 had increased the thickness of its armour for this battle {{to make it harder}} for Razer to inflict major damage. This tactic almost worked: Razer was unable to completely immobilise the robot. The fight ended in a close judges' decision—in Razer's favour. Victory handed Razer a place in the series five grand final against <b>Bigger</b> Brother, rebuilt after being heavily damaged by Hypno-Disc in its previous battle. Razer gripped <b>Bigger</b> Brother early in the battle, causing damage to its opponent's drive chain from which <b>Bigger</b> Brother never recovered. The final ended in a stalemate and went to the judges; their decision came back in favour of Razer. Along with the UK Championship, Razer also took home a third Best Design award.|$|E

5|$|With {{the switch}} to a <b>bigger</b> 97 inch racket from 90 inches, Federer has gained easy power while relinquishing some control on his shots.

Due to the vast size of the beach which the Stones performed on (2.5km), sound systems had to be set up in a relay pattern {{down the length of the}} beach, in order to keep the sound in sync with music from the stage; for every 340 metres of beach, the sound had to be delayed an additional second.|$|E
