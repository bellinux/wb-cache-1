EHD flows are a characteristic of Electrostatic Precipitators (ESPs) and the study of their interac-tions with the turbulent boundary layer may lead to optimization of ESPs from the viewpoint of drag reduction and particle collection efficiency. However, this study has a general rele-vance since EHD flows may be exploited in a number of industrial applications to modulate turbulence. In this work, we describe the principles of turbulence structure at the wall and then present results obtained for turbulent boundary layer forced by different configura-tions of EHD flows.

40|$|International audienceVortex {{generators}} (VGs) are {{a common}} way to perform flow control thought their actual effect on a generic flow is mainly unknown. In order to find determinant physical parameters {{which can be used}} to optimize dimensions, position and actuation of vortex generators we have studied the effect of solid cylinder vortex generators on a flat plate boundary layer. Using two-component PIV measurement and 3 D reconstruction we show the existence of a boundary layer modulation due to counter rotating streamwise vortices. By analyzing the 3 D velocity field we extract the non linear part of this modulation (and especially the quadratic non linear zeroth mode) which is responsible for the mean flow modification. This parametric study gives the growth rate of non linear perturbations and the properties of the spanwise modulation depending on VGs spacing and Reynolds number. These are determinant physical parameters of the <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> <b>modification</b> by the VGs {{that can be used to}} their efficient design and control.

40|$|Large eddy {{simulations}} (LESs) {{are performed}} {{for the area}} of the Caribbean island Barbados to investigate island effects on <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> <b>modification,</b> cloud generation and vertical mixing of aerosols. Due to the presence of a topographically structured island surface in the domain center, the model setup has to be designed with open lateral boundaries. In order to generate inflow turbulence consistent with the upstream marine boundary layer forcing, we use the cell perturbation method based on finite amplitude potential temperature perturbations. In this work, this method is for the first time tested and validated for moist boundary layer simulations with open lateral boundary conditions. Observational data obtained from the SALTRACE field campaign is used for both model initialization and a comparison with Doppler wind and Raman lidar data. Several numerical sensitivity tests are carried out to demonstrate the problems related to “gray zone modeling” when using coarser spatial grid spacings beyond the inertial subrange of three-dimensional turbulence or when the turbulent marine boundary layer flow is replaced by laminar winds. Especially cloud properties in the downwind area west of Barbados are markedly affected in these kinds of simulations. Results of an additional simulation with a strong trade-wind inversion reveal its effect on cloud layer depth and location. Saharan dust layers that reach Barbados via long-range transport over the North Atlantic are included as passive tracers in the model. Effects of layer thinning, subsidence and turbulent downward transport near the layer bottom at z[*]≈[*] 1800 m become apparent. The exact position of these layers and strength of downward mixing is found to be mainly controlled atmospheric stability (especially inversion strength) and wind shear. Comparisons of LES model output with wind lidar data show similarities in the downwind vertical wind structure. Additionally, the model results accurately reproduce the development of the daytime convective boundary layer measured by the Raman lidar...|$|E
40|$|The flow {{around a}} vehicle, for example, {{results in a}} large {{resistance}} and can generate a complex swirl pattern behind {{the body of the}} vehicle, which can lead to strong alternating lateral forces. There is therefore a clear need for more fundamental understanding of the instability of this so-called wake region, which arises behind bluff bodies. In this thesis, the focus lies on the relation between the wake inlet conditions and the wake characteristics of a bluff body. This relation is studied experimentally, in the Reynolds number range 2. 9 E 3 - 5. 5 E 4.   The experiments are carried out in a specially designed test-section, which comprises a rectangular forebody with a smooth leading edge and a blunt trailing edge. The perforated top and bottom surface of this body allow for <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> <b>modification</b> by means of wall suction.   Hot-wire anemometry and pressure measurements show that wall suction, in the order of 1 % of the free-stream velocity, leads to a significant change of the boundary-layer properties; the boundary-layer thickness decreases and the wall-shear stress increases.   Laminar boundary layers take the form of the asymptotic suction boundary layer and turbulent boundary layers are shown to relaminarize, when subject to wall suction above a critical value. A modification of the boundary layer leads to an increase of the vortex shedding frequency and a decrease of the base pressure. Empirical relations for the Strouhal number and the base pressure coefficient are derived. The boundary layer conditions are included in these relations and as result, they hold for both laminar and turbulent boundary layers. Two-dimensional velocity fields, obtained by means of particle image velocimetry, reveal the effect of boundary-layer modification on the near-wake topology. By dividing the velocity component into (i) mean, (ii) periodic and (iii) random contributions, it can be shown that the confluence point moves upstream, the curvature of streamlines enclosing the trailing edge increases, and the Reynolds normal and shear stresses increase.   The experimental study is continued by introducing interference elements in the wake. The qualitative effect of a splitter plate on the wake characteristics is not altered by boundary-layer modification, but the critical splitter plate length and gap width for which the vortex shedding frequency is suppressed do change. A sensitivity map is obtained experimentally by placing a control rod at various locations in the wake. Considering all limitations of such an experiment, it was found to be in good agreement with the result of a linear stability analysis carried out on the measured mean velocity field.   QC 20160316 </p...|$|E
40|$|The wake {{behind a}} {{rectangular}} forebody with variable inlet conditions is investigated. The perforated {{surface of the}} two-dimensional rectangular forebody, with a smooth leading edge and a blunt trailing edge, allows for <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> <b>modification</b> by means of wall suction. The test section, of which the rectangular forebody is the main part, is experimentally evaluated {{with a series of}} hot-wire and Prandtl tube measurements in the boundary layer and the wake. For a suction coefficient of Γ> 9, corresponding to 0. 9 % suction of the free stream velocity, the asymptotic suction boundary layer (ASBL) is obtained at the trailing edge of the forebody for laminar boundary layers (Rex= 1. 6 × 105 − 3. 8 × 105). The key feature of the ASBL, a spatially invariant boundary thickness which can be modified independent of the Reynolds number, is used to perform a unique parametrical study. Turbulent boundary layers (Rex= 4. 5 × 105 − 3. 0 × 106) subject to wall suction are also investigated. For a critical suction coefficient Γcrit, which depends on Rex, the boundary layer relaminarizes. Strong evidence is found to support the hypothesis that turbulent boundary layers will ultimately attain the ASBL as well, provided that the wall suction is strong enough. The effect of the modulated laminar and turbulent boundary layers on the wake characteristics is studied. The shape of the mean wake velocity profile, scaled with the velocity deficit U 0 and the wake half width ∆y 1 / 2, is found tobe independent of x/h, for x/h> 6 and Reh > 6. 7 × 103. The wake width is shown to scale with the effective thickness of the body h+ 2 δ 1, where the ratio is expected to vary with the downstream location. A decrease of the displacement thickness leads to a decrease of the base pressure, with Cp,b = − 0. 36 in the ASBL limit. The Strouhal number based on the effective thickness becomes Sth+ 2 δ 1 ≈ 0. 29 in the ASBL limit and independent of the plate thickness (h) Reynolds number, in the range Reh = 2. 9 × 103 − 6. 7 × 103. For the turbulent boundary Sth+ 2 δ 1 is found to be 25 % lower, which shows that the wake characteristics depend {{on the state of the}} boundary layer at the trailing edge. The total drag is found to be reduced by as much as 30 % for Reh = 2. 7 × 104 when a wall normal velocity of only 3. 5 % of the free stream velocity is applied. Wall suction successively reduces the total drag with increasing wall suction, at least in the Reynolds number rangeReh = 8. 0 × 103 − 5. 5 × 104. QC 20140312 </p...|$|E

40|$|Concurrent {{measurements}} of velocity, water depth, sub-surface pore-pressure and suspended sediment concentration (SSC) {{were obtained from}} the swash-zone o f a macrotidal, dissipaiive (tanP = 0. 014), fine to medium grained (dso^ 0. 24 mm) beach at Perranporth, Cornwall, UK, in low (H^ = 0. 8 m) to high (Hj « 2. 2 m) energy conditions. Velocity, pressure and SSC were measured using electromagnetic current meters, pressure transducers and a four-level array of miniature optical backscaner sensors respectively. Results show an infragravity dominated wave field in the swashzone in both high and low energy conditions. In low energy conditions, the ratio between low (f 0. 05 Hz) frequency variance increased from 0. 6 to 2. 3 for both cross-shore velocity and surface elevation, and SSC at z = 1 cm increased by a factor of about 5, between just shoreward of the breakpoint (h/hb = 0. 6) and the swash-zone (h/hb = 0. 2). Swash-zone suspended sediment fluxes at z = 5 to 6 cm increased by a factor of about 2 from low to high energy conditions. Low frequency cross-shore velocity skewness values for low and high energy conditions were 0. 04 and - 0. 81 respectively, suggesting an important contribution to offshore transport in high energy conditions, from large, low frequency backwashes manifest in the velocity time-series as low frequency negative skewness. Using 3 D velocities from a similar experiment at Muriwai, New Zealand, it is found that TKE/velocity ratios in the uprush were about 1. 7 limes larger than in the backwash, suggesting greater turbulence in the uprush. Turbulence and rapid flow reversal are important onshore transport mechanisms, manifest as high frequency negative asymmetry in the velocity time-series. Values for high frequency negative asymmetry at Perranporth were 1. 8 times larger in low than in high energy conditions. The influence of inexflltration is investigated using velocity and sub-surface pore-pressure measurements, and a modified Shields parameter, which includes terms to account for the competing effects of stabilisation-destabilisation and <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> <b>modification.</b> It is found that there is dominance of stabilisation-destabilisation, resulting in a 4. 5 % increase in backwash transport and a 10. 5 % decrease in uprush transport, integrated over a swash cycle. Sensitivity tests show a reversal in this dominance if the median grain size is increased above about 0. 55 mm, suggesting the transport influence is onshore on coarser grained beaches and offshore on finer grained beaches. Calculations show that hydraulic jumps due to uprush-backwash interaction were about 2. 1 times as likely to occur during high than during low energy conditions. Visual observations suggest that more sediment is advected offshore from these jumps in high energy conditions. An antidune ripple field, which enhances transport through increased bed roughness, may also form beneath hydraulic jumps, but this is shown to influence the total dimensionless transport over a 17 -min. time-series by less than 5 %. Overall results suggest that swash-zone erosion occurs more readily on relatively fine-grained beaches in storms, and accretion occurs more readily on relatively coarse-grained beaches in calm conditions, which is consistent with observations in nature. Large infragravity frequency backwashes manifest as negative infragravity skewness appear to be a key factor in linking enhanced offshore transport in the swash-zone with high energy conditions...|$|E
40|$|A {{new model}} for the <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> {{development}} and associated skin friction coefficients and shear stress within the swash zone is presented. The model is developed within a Lagrangian reference frame, following fluid trajectories, and {{can be applied to}} both laminar flow and smooth turbulent flow. The model is based on the momentum integral approach for steady, flat-plate <b>boundary</b> <b>layers,</b> with appropriate <b>modifications</b> to account for the unsteady flow regime and flow history. The model results are consistent with previous measurements of bed shear stress and skin friction coefficients within the swash zone. These indicate strong temporal and spatial variation throughout the swash cycle, and a clear distinction between the uprush and backwash phase. This variation has been previously attributed the unsteady flow regime and flow history effects, both of which are accounted for in the new model. Fluid particle trajectories and velocity are computed using the non-linear shallow water wave equations and the <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> growth across the entire swash zone is estimated. Predictions of the bed shear stress and skin friction coefficients agree reasonably well with direct bed shear stress measurements reported by Barnes et al. (Barnes, M.

Coastal Engineering 56 (8), 853 - 867) and, for a given flow velocity, give stresses which are consistent with the bias toward uprush sediment transport which has consistently been observed in measurements. The data and modelling suggest that the backwash <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> is initially laminar, which results in the late development of significant bed shear during the backwash, with a transition to a turbulent <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> later in the backwash. A new conceptual {{model for the}} <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> structure at {{the leading edge of the}} swash is proposed, which accounts for both the no-slip condition at the bed and the moving wet-dry interface.

For this purpose ADV velocity measurements {{were made at}} 16 different distances along the channel mid section for four different flow conditions. Both experimental and theoretical methods implemented in the computation of <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> thickness. <b>Boundary</b> <b>layer</b> thicknesses were determined using Matlab codes which work based on the von Karman integral momentum method. Theoretical method gives high <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> thickness and small <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> development length values. The <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> development varies between 30 to 65 times of the water depth for all flow conditions...|$|R
50|$|The thermal <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> {{thickness}} {{is similarly}} {{the distance from}} the body at which the temperature is 99% of the temperature found from an inviscid solution. The ratio of the two thicknesses is governed by the Prandtl number. If the Prandtl number is 1, the two <b>boundary</b> <b>layers</b> are the same thickness. If the Prandtl number is greater than 1, the thermal <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> is thinner than the velocity <b>boundary</b> <b>layer.</b> If the Prandtl number is less than 1, which is the case for air at standard conditions, the thermal <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> is thicker than the velocity <b>boundary</b> <b>layer.</b>|$|R

Flow phenomena peculiar to calculation of these <b>boundary</b> <b>layers</b> were considered, along with calculations of three dimensional compressible turbulent <b>boundary</b> <b>layers.</b> Procedures for ascertaining nonsimilar {{two and three}} dimensional compressible turbulent <b>boundary</b> <b>layers</b> were appended, including finite difference, finite element, and mass-weighted residual methods...|$|R
40|$|An inverse <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> {{procedure}} for calculating separated, turbulent <b>boundary</b> <b>layers</b> at infinitely long, crabbing wing was developed. The procedure {{was developed for}} calculating three dimensional, incompressible turbulent <b>boundary</b> <b>layers</b> was expanded to adiabatic, compressible flows. Example calculations with transsonic wings were made including viscose effects. In this case an approximated calculation method described for areas of separated, turbulent <b>boundary</b> <b>layers,</b> permitting calculation of this displacement thickness. The laminar <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> development was calculated with inclined ellipsoids...|$|R
40|$|Understanding and {{prediction}} of the stable atmospheric <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> is a challenging task. Many physical processes are relevant {{in the stable}} <b>boundary</b> <b>layer,</b> i. e. turbulence, radiation, land surface coupling, orographic turbulent and gravity wave drag, and land surface heterogeneity. The development of robust stable <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> parameterizations for use in NWP and climate models is hampered by the multiplicity of processes and their unknown interactions. As a result, these models suffer from typical biases in key variables, such as 2 m temperature, <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> depth, <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> wind speed. This paper summarizes the physical processes active in the stable <b>boundary</b> <b>layer,</b> their particular role, their interconnections and relevance for different stable <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> regimes (if understood). Also, the major model deficiencies are reported...|$|R
