5|$|As the game's {{dialogue}} {{consists of}} a lot of wordplay and misunderstandings, Smith would analyze scenes before writing them: he would see what the scenes were trying to accomplish, and where the beats in them were. After he had the structure of a scene in his head, he would write it; at times he was able {{to make use of the}} original Japanese dialogue, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> he had to come up with new ideas himself. At several points, the English wordplay was inspired by the wordplay in the Japanese version. At some points, it was not possible to do wordplay in the same places as in the Japanese version, so Smith would change the structure of the scene slightly. At other points, Smith came up with a joke or funny line, and changed the scene to make the joke work. Around half of the jokes were rewritten based on the characters present in the scene, rather than being translations of the Japanese jokes.|$|E
5|$|The book is {{a fictional}} autobiography, {{describing}} the life of Maximilien Aue, a former officer in the SS who, decades later, {{tells the story of}} a crucial part of his life when he was an active member of the security forces of the Third Reich. Aue begins his narrative as a member of an Einsatzgruppe in 1941, before being sent to the doomed German forces locked in the Battle of Stalingrad, which he survives. After a convalescence period in Berlin, and a visit to occupied France, he is designated for an advisory role for the concentration camps, and visits the extermination camps. He is ultimately present during the 1945 Battle of Berlin, the Nazi regime's last stand. By the end of the story, he flees Germany under a false French identity to start a new life in northern France. Throughout the account, Aue meets several famous Nazis, including Adolf Eichmann, Heinrich Himmler and Adolf Hitler. In the book, Aue accepts responsibility for his actions, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> he feels more like an observer than a direct participant.|$|E

Waters later admitted, [...] "He was our friend, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> we now wanted to strangle him". In early March 1968, Pink Floyd met with business partners Jenner and King to discuss the band's future; Barrett agreed to leave.|$|E
500|$|Except {{for when}} Hagström needs a soloist, he and Thordendal rarely record together. Both play guitar and bass while composing.

[...] The band uses Cubase to record the tracks, and the guitars are routed through {{software}} amplifier modeling, because it allows them to change the amp settings even after the song was fully recorded.|$|E

500|$|A teaser for [...] "Artpop" [...] was previewed {{as part of}} snippets {{from the}} parent album until its final release on November 11, 2013. A [...] "not safe for work" [...] short film, An Artpop Film Starring Lady Gaga, set to the song was {{released}} as promotion for the album, on November 20, 2013. Shot by Dutch fashion photographer duo Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin, the video consisted of the material that Gaga created with them as promotion leading to Artpop. The video begins with a nude Gaga uttering a monologue: [...] "This album is a celebration. My pain exploding in electronic music. It's heavy, but after I listen to it I feel happy again. I feel lighter." [...] Following these are the black-and-white promotional scenes from Artpop campaign announcement, the music video for the first single [...] "Applause", the nude images for her interview with V magazine and the artwork for promotional single, [...] "Dope". Gaga shows a range of emotion in the film, including caressing a mannequin and applying dirt on her body, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> she simply stares towards the camera. Zayda Rivera from New York Daily News expressed her difficulty in understanding the film, but added that [...] "hypnotic musical backdrop of her single 'Artpop' perfectly matches the artsy, bewildering and even disturbing images that run through the fast and slow editing." [...] Gaga admitted that she had performed for 12hours while making the film.|$|E
500|$|The South China Morning Post {{praised the}} game's formula, noting that it {{followed}} {{in the footsteps of}} previous open-ended Maxis games. Comparing to SimCity 2000, the review remarked that it was more interesting to watch people live out their lives in a tower rather than to observe cars moving around. They also appreciated the [...] "homely" [...] feeling of SimTower, in contrast with other Sim games such as SimEarth and SimLife, which they felt were too universal to take on a personal identity. Benjamin Svetkey of Entertainment Weekly praised the game and commented that it is [...] "more fun than [...] sounds". However, he stated that the gameplay may be too much for fans of the series. A reviewer for Next Generation panned the game, saying it lacks the bustling interactivity of previous games in the Sim franchise: [...] "There are bug infestations and the occasional fire with which to deal, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> SimTower sees you standing around waiting for cash reserves to grow in order to add more floors. Not much fun at all." [...] Australia's The Age found SimTower a pleasing return to form for Maxis, after the release of the disappointing SimFarm. Lisa Karen Savignano of Allgame stated that the game had decent graphics and sound. However, she also felt that SimTower had good replay value due to the non-linear gameplay, giving the game 4 stars out of 5.|$|E

500|$|Many of {{the songs}} from The Slim Shady LP are written from the {{perspective}} of Eminem's alter ego, Slim Shady, and contain cartoonish and over-the-top depictions of violence, which he refers to as [...] "made-up tales of trailer-park stuff". [...] The rapper explained that this subject matter is intended for entertainment value, likening his music to the horror film genre: [...] "Why can't people see that records can be like movies? [...] The only difference between some of my raps and movies is that they aren't on a screen." [...] Some of the lyrics have also been considered to be misogynistic by critics and commentators. [...] Eminem acknowledged the accusations, and clarified, [...] "I have a fairly salty relationship with women... <b>But</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> when I'm saying shit about women, when I'm saying 'bitches' and 'hoes', it's so ridiculous that I'm taking the stereotypical rapper to the extreme. I don't hate women in general. They just make me mad sometimes.'" [...] Despite the album's explicit nature, Eminem refused to say the word [...] "nigga" [...] on the album, with the rapper noting, [...] "It's not in my vocabulary." [...] The Slim Shady LP begins with a [...] "Public Service Announcement" [...] introduction performed by producer Jeff Bass of the Bass Brothers, and serves as a sarcastic disclaimer discussing the album's explicit lyrical content. [...] Later in the album, a skit entitled [...] "Paul" [...] features a phone call from Paul Rosenberg to Eminem telling him to [...] "tone down" [...] his lyrics.|$|E
500|$|Writer John Swartzwelder {{has noted}} that the staff members of the show write the {{character}} Homer {{in the same way}} that they write Santa's Little Helper: [...] "Both are loyal. Both have the same emotional range. And both will growl and possibly snap if you try to take their food." [...] Although animals in cartoons often behave with [...] "semi-human awareness", Groening said on the DVD audio commentary for the episode [...] "Two Dozen and One Greyhounds" [...] that he prefers animals in cartoons to behave exactly the way they do in real life. As a result, Santa's Little Helper is depicted in this way on the show. There have, however, been some exceptions for gags, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> the staff of The Simpsons tries to keep animals acting realistically. Several journalists have commented on the greyhound's lack of intelligence. In an article that compared The Simpsons to the animated series Family Guy, Todd Camp of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram noted that [...] "though Santa's Little Helper may be the only Simpson who's dumber than Homer, the Griffins' pooch [...] is the brainiest member of the household". In 1991, Copley News Service's Alison Ashton described Santa's Little Helper as a [...] "sweet and stupid dog". Tom Coombe of The Morning Call wrote in 2002 that [...] "fans of The Simpsons will tell you that the cartoon family's dog [...] is often dumb, disobedient and skittish. Fans of the real-life breed will paint a different picture — of dogs that are peaceful, affectionate, [...] not given to drooling, panting".|$|E
