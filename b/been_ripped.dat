5|$|Frank was autopsied twice, {{the second}} time to recover debris {{embedded}} in his body. The autopsy revealed that his lower extremities had <b>been</b> <b>ripped</b> off; his muscle tissue was extensively mutilated and torn; small pieces of wire, brass, and miscellaneous articles including a hat ornament were imbedded in various limbs; {{the fingers of his}} right hand were fractured and the bones splintered; and the distal phalanx of each finger on his left hand were missing. The coroner also observed numerous patches of blackened areas, similar to close-range gunshot residue. Four human finger bones were discovered among the wreckage at the primary crash site.|$|E
5|$|It {{was written}} by Ron Hauge, {{directed}} by Bob Anderson, and guest starred Alex Trebek as himself. Hauge was inspired to write the episode after learning of an orphanage that had <b>been</b> <b>ripped</b> off. The episode was selected, among other Christmas themed episodes of the series, on an 2005 Christmas special boxed set on DVD. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide criticized the episode as a rehash of older themes, {{but it was also}} described as one of The Simpsons’ more memorable episodes in a review of the 2005 DVD boxed set release.|$|E

25|$|The main predators {{of these}} wasps are hornets (especially Vespa tropica), ichneumonid flies, and ants. The hornets attack and damage the nests by ripping the cells apart with their mandibles and then extracting {{portions}} of the brood. Raided nests can easily be identified by locating cells that have <b>been</b> <b>ripped</b> or torn. When a hornet or other flying predator approaches, the wasps engage in aerial attacks by throwing themselves into {{the air in the}} direction of the potential danger. They actually engage in this behavior very frequently and do so in response to any insect of similar size to hornets that approaches the nests in a questionable manner. When ants approach or invade the nests, the wasps will either grab the ants and drag them away from the nests, or, if the ants are especially large, the wasps will first assume a defensive posture, seize the ants, and then purposely fall out of the nests to ensure the ants are removed. Spiders may also prey on these wasps, but they are much more likely to catch solitary individuals away from the nest.|$|E
25|$|The {{island of}} Madeira has an oceanic climate with some {{tropical}} influences. With high rainfall and average mean temperature of 66°F (19°C), {{the threats of}} fungal grape diseases and botrytis rot are constant viticultural hazards. To combat these threats, Madeira vineyards are often planted low trellises, known as latada, that raise the canopy of the vine off the ground similar to a style used in the Vinho Verde region of Portugal. The terrain of the mountainous volcanic island is difficult to cultivate, so vineyards are planted on man-made terraces of red and basaltic bedrock. These terraces, known as poios, {{are very similar to}} the terraces of the Douro that make Port wine production possible. The use of mechanical harvesting and vineyard equipment is near impossible, making wine grape growing a costly endeavor on the island. Many vineyards have in the past <b>been</b> <b>ripped</b> up for commercial tourist developments or replanted with such products as bananas for commercial concerns. Some replanting is taking place on the island; however, the tourist trade is generally seen as a more lucrative business than wine-making. Most of the grapes, grown by around 2100 grape growers are from vines planted on small plots of land off of which the grape growers survive by making an income from a variety of different inter-grown crops.|$|E

500|$|... character's {{chest and}} {{his need to}} feed on the spirits of others to survive, was {{described}} by Obsidian as less all-encompassing than the first game and more personal in nature. [...] Saunders commented [...] "It's an epic story, but it's a very personal one. You awaken {{in a pool of}} your own blood. Your immediate goal is survival. The shard of the Sword of Gith has <b>been</b> <b>ripped</b> from your chest and in its place is a dark hunger, a craving that threatens to consume you. The early part of the game involves determining the source and implications of this craving." [...] Saunders also stated that the story, written by creative lead George Ziets, was [...] "very dark" [...] and that the ending would bring some closure to the story of the Shard-Bearer.|$|E
500|$|Bonnie Stiernberg of Paste {{awarded the}} episode an 8 out of 10.

[...] Damon Houx of Screen Crush called the episode [...] "a really good Christmas episode" [...] that [...] "got [...] central three characters absolutely right". Although he wrote that the show was missing several cast members, like Helms and Duke, it was [...] "as good as the post-Carell Office has been". Cindy White of IGN awarded the episode a 9 out of 10, denoting an [...] "amazing episode". She wrote that it [...] "harkens back to forgotten holiday traditions of old, like good Christmas episodes of The Office". She also concluded that [...] "the nostalgia swirling around Dwight Christmas was particularly noticeable" [...] which she deduced was probably [...] "a conscious effort here {{on the part of the}} writers to recapture that old Office magic and make this one to remember, and I think that effort paid off." ...|$|E
500|$|Howard Langston is a {{workaholic}} mattress salesman {{with no time}} for his wife, Liz, and his 9-year-old son, Jamie — especially when compared to next door [...] "superdad" [...] divorcee, Ted Maltin, who continually puts Howard in a bad light. After missing Jamie's karate class graduation, Howard resolves to redeem himself by fulfilling Jamie's ultimate Christmas wish: getting an action figure toy of Turbo-Man, based on a wildly popular Saturday-morning live-action TV superhero of the same name. Along the way, Howard meets Myron Larabee, a postal worker dad with a rival ambition, and the two soon become bitter competitors in their race for the action figure. During his search, Howard repeatedly runs into Officer Alexander Hummel, a police officer who {{at the beginning of}} the film pulled him over for traffic violation. After several failed attempts to find the toy in a store, Howard attempts to buy a Turbo-Man from a Mall of America Santa, who is actually the leader of a band of counterfeit toy makers. When he accuses the Santa of undermining the values of Christmas (having <b>been</b> <b>ripped</b> off and sold a defective toy that falls apart the moment he opened the package), Howard ends up in a brawl with the gang. He narrowly escapes when the police raid their warehouse and gets out by posing as an undercover detective using a toy badge.|$|E

500|$|Braid {{has been}} {{considered}} a masterpiece, and was highly praised for the unique puzzles it presented. Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer noted the creative variation on time manipulation {{and the need to}} understand the non-linearity of his actions made him feel as if [...] "years of gaming blinders have <b>been</b> <b>ripped</b> away." [...] Jason Hill of The Age stated the puzzles were [...] "elaborate and formidable", but [...] "impeccably designed and hugely satisfying to solve", a point reiterated by Sunday Herald Suns Paddy Reiley. The connection between the puzzles and the overall presentation of the game was favorably received; Tom McShea of GameSpot stated that Braid was [...] "the rare game that will make you rack your brain trying to solve puzzles one minute while challenging you {{to come to terms with}} its mature tale the next". Sam Roberts, game director for the Slamdance Film Festival Guerrilla Gamemaking Competition, was impressed that Braid did not [...] "feel immature" [...] as it [...] "expects [...] much" [...] of the player as any other form of media and [...] "doesn't short you in any respect". Braids artwork and presentation were given high regards. Nick Suttner of 1UP.com commented that Braids artwork [...] "juxtapose old-school design sensibilities with impressionist backdrops and lovingly hand-painted environments", while McShea stated that the game's visuals were [...] "eye-catching but never distracting". Wireds Jean Snow wrote that Braids [...] "beautiful symphonic melodies contribute to what is already an impressive and unique vision", and that [...] "the soothing tunes are probably the reason you never really lose it when facing particularly tough puzzles". Arthouse Games' Jason Rohrer interpreted the ability to rewind time indefinitely as a commentary about traditional platform game design: the fact the player is not forced to restart the level when they die gives greater emphasis to the game's [...] "core challenges".|$|E

2500|$|Plants are {{extremely}} common in heraldry and figure among the earliest charges. The turnip, for instance, makes an early appearance, as does wheat. Trees also appear in heraldry; {{the most frequent}} tree by far is the oak (drawn with large leaves and acorns), followed by the pine. Apples and bunches of grapes occur very frequently, other fruits less so. When the fruit is mentioned, as to indicate a different tincture, the tree {{is said to be}} fructed of the tincture. If a tree is [...] "eradicated" [...] it is shown as if it has <b>been</b> <b>ripped</b> up from the ground, the roots being exposed. [...] "Erased" [...] is rarely used for a similar treatment.

[...] Sandison described Tomorrow's Harvests final track, [...] "Semena Mertvykh", as having [...] "a deliberate feeling of complete futility." [...] However, he later claimed that the album was [...] "loaded with patterns and messages" [...] and that the duo used more subliminals on Tomorrow's Harvest than they had on their previous studio albums.|$|E
