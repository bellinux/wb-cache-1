40|$|This article {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} selected competencies of the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), namely the power to resolve disputes between national supervisory authorities i n the framework of a binding mediation and to issue non-binding guidelines, and the impact which exercising those powers by the EIOPA has on the competences of the Polish Financial Supervision Authority (KNF), a public authority responsible for {{the supervision of the}} Polish ﬁ nancial market. In the ﬁ rst part of the article the powers of the EIOPA to resolve disputes in a binding mediation process are described, and the limited possibilities that the EIOPA has to initiate this procedure are emphasized, since as a consequence of that the current mediation procedure encourages national supervisory authorities to resolve their disputes themselves. Next the principles of taking decisions by the EIOPA Board of Supervisors in the mediation process are described and attention is drawn to the discriminatory nature of those rules where the dispute relates to decisions of the group supervisor. The article also highlights potential consequences of decisions taken by the EIOPA within the <b>binding</b> <b>mediation</b> and their impact on administrative decisions taken by national supervisory authorities. The second part of the article provides an analysis of EIOPA’s powers to issue guidelines. The non-binding nature of the guidelines, which are described as soft law, has been reviewed. It is pointed that the European Union law provides for certain mechanisms which enable the EIOPA to enforce implementation of the guidelines by national competent authorities. As a next step, EIOPA guidelines on preparing for the implementation of Solvency II and the powers of the KNF to apply those guidelines have been reviewed. In addition to that, justiﬁ cation for vesting the KNF with the power to issue recommendations or guidelines addressed to insurance and reinsurance undertakings, in the context of analogous competences possessed by the EIOPA have been discussed. 191251525 Studia Prawa Publiczneg...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} ample study {{devoted to the}} {{problems}} that arise when courts are faced with custody disputes intertwined with issues of religion. Unfortunately, many of those studies conclude without proposing an effective solution or by suggesting an alternative without defining what that alternative might be. A solution must be employed that allows religious consideration in a forum more suitable to facilitating a resolution in the complete {{best interest of the}} child and parents. Mediation provides this forum by facilitating a negotiation in which parents are allowed to develop their own collaborative solutions to interfaith child custody disputes. Through techniques unique to the practice of mediation, parents are more capable of resolving religious conflicts affecting child custody, and thereby enabling the parties to create a parenting plan and <b>binding</b> <b>mediation</b> agreement that would not only resolve immediate divorce contestations, but also provide a basis from which to resolve future issues. The flexibility of mediation also allows for considerable advocacy of the child 2 ̆ 7 s rights without the burden of legislature that requires the balancing of parental-rights against state responsibilities. Part II of this article purports to identify the need for an alternative to litigation in these cases by defining the social context in which these cases have become more prevalent, the constitutional barriers faced by courts, and the inadequate protection afforded to children 2 ̆ 7 s rights in traditional litigation. In response to that need, Part III proposes a specific mediation model, drawing guidance from the courts, that involves: an evaluative stage in which the parents and child are afforded an opportunity to express their interests, a facilitative stage in which the mediator and other participants assist the parties in resolving the dispute with an aim towards consistency, and the formulation of an agreement that serves {{the best interests of the}} child and is perceived as fair by the parents. The mediation model utilizes a structured and process-oriented approach, which incorporates the participation of advocates for both the child and the religious preferences of the parents. Part IV concludes this article by emphasizing that the use of the proposed mediation techniques provides a solution to the problems faced by courts, divorcing couples, and children in the context of determining the religious upbringing of children in custody conflicts...|$|E
40|$|Polyethylene glycol {{dehydrogenase}} (PEGDH) from Sphingopyxis terrae (formerly Sphingomonas terrae) {{is composed}} of 535 amino acid residues and one flavin adenine dinucleotide per monomer protein in a homodimeric structure. Its amino acid sequence shows 28. 5 to 30. 5 % identity with glucose oxidases from Aspergillus niger and Penicillium amagasakiense. The ADP-binding site and the signature 1 and 2 consensus sequences of glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductases are present in PEGDH. Based on three-dimensional molecular modeling and kinetic characterization of wild-type PEGDH and mutant PEGDHs constructed by site-directed mutagenesis, residues potentially involved in catalysis and substrate binding {{were found in the}} vicinity of the flavin ring. The catalytically important active sites were assigned to His- 467 and Asn- 511. One disulfide bridge between Cys- 379 and Cys- 382 existed in PEGDH and seemed to play roles in both substrate <b>binding</b> and electron <b>mediation.</b> The Cys- 297 mutant showed decreased activity, suggesting the residue's importance in both substrate <b>binding</b> and electron <b>mediation,</b> as well as Cys- 379 and Cys- 382. PEGDH also contains a motif of a ubiquinone-binding site, and coenzyme Q 10 was utilized as an electron acceptor.

40|$|Service-oriented Computing (SOC) has {{recently}} received attention from both academia and industry. It introduces {{a new paradigm}} for addressing the complexity of distributed systems, by using loose coupling, platform-independent interface descriptions and well-established standards. The overall idea of service orientation is that software is provided as service, {{which can be found}} in service registries and invoked by service consumers. Web services represent the most common realization of Service-oriented Architecture (SOA) that build on the main standards SOAP, WSDL and UDDI. However, current service-oriented systems are often not as dynamic and adaptable as intended. For instance, the publish-find-bind-execute cycle of the SOA model is not always entirely realized since service registries are often missing. In this thesis, we address some of the current challenges in SOC research and practice, such as service metadata and querying, as well as dynamic <b>binding,</b> invocation and <b>mediation</b> of services. The main focus is on event processing and asynchronous notifications in serviceoriented systems. The aim is to enable clients to subscribe in order to receive notifications if certain events of interest occur. This can range from basic events (e. g., new service is published into the service registry) to more complex events regarding service invocations and Qualit...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} dissect the {{relationship}} between the virus receptor <b>binding</b> and the <b>mediation</b> of virus entry by the retroviral envelope protein (Env), it was first tried to genetically modify the receptor binding specificity of the Env protein of the ecotropic Moloney murine leukemia virus (MLV). A specific site (Pro- 79) was found in the variable region A of the Env protein, where the insertion of peptide ligands, epidermal growth factor (EGF) and stromal-derived factor- 1 α (SDF- 1 α), was possible without abolishing viral incorporation of the Env protein and its ecotropic entry function. The MLV vector containing the EGF-Env protein did not show the EGF receptor-dependent transductkon of cells. The MLV vector containing the SDF- 1 α-Env protein (S 3), on the other hand, transduced specifically human cells expressing CXCR 4, the receptor for SDF- 1 α, at titers of 10 [?]- 10 [?] CFU/ml. Further experiments showed that the CXCR 4 -dependent transduction was based on the specific intertaction berween the SDF- 1 α moiety of the SDF- 1 α-Env protein and the CXCR 4 and independent of the ecotropic entry function. The S 3 Env protein was further modified so that it may lose the tropism towards the ecotropic MLV receptor (mCAT- 1) but retain that towards the CXCR 4. The MLV vector containing the modified SDF- 1 α-Env protein (S 3 -D 84 K) lost the ecotropic entry function, but could transduce the CXCR 4 -expressing human cells at titers higher than 10 [?] CFU/ml; namely this vector is taken for a tropism-redirected vector that should be applicable to in vivo studies in mice. Introducing the His- 8 -to-Arg substitution abolished the ability of the S 3 -D 84 K Env protein to mediate the transduction through CXCR 4 but not that to bind to CXCR 4, indicating that the His- 8 residue of the S 3 -D 84 K Env protein is likely to function as a key residue in regulatign a series of postbinding membranefusion events as was proposed for the same residue of the wild-type Env protein. Further experiments showed that the His- 8 residue of the S 3 -D 84 K Env protein might be fully functional. This study suggests that the receptor specificity of the Moloney MLV Env protein can be varied while maintaining the ability to activate the envelope-cell membrane fusion function. This provides the basis for constructing the tropism-redirected retroviral cectors. Thesis (Ph.
