5|$|After the ten-day campaign, the Israelis were {{military}} {{superior to}} their enemies and the Cabinet subsequently considered {{where and when}} to attack next. Three options were offered: attacking the Arabic enclave in Galilee held <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> Liberation Army; moving eastward {{as far as possible}} in Samarian and Judean areas, taken by the Iraqis and Jordanians; or attacking southern Negev taken by the Egyptians.|$|E
5|$|Different {{variants}} {{have been}} introduced catering to regional taste and requirements. A meethi (sweet) variant of haleem is consumed as breakfast <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> diaspora in Barkas neighbourhood of the city. The chicken variant is less popular, {{even though it is}} lower priced. A vegetarian version of haleem, in which dry fruits and vegetables are substituted for goat meat, is available at some eateries in Hyderabad.|$|E
5|$|Egypt {{and much}} of Palestine were {{controlled}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> Shi'ite Fatimid Caliphate, which was significantly smaller since {{the arrival of the}} Seljuqs. Warfare between the Fatimids and Seljuqs caused great disruption for the local Christians and for western pilgrims. The Fatimids, under the nominal rule of caliph al-Musta'li but actually controlled by vizier al-Afdal Shahanshah, had lost Jerusalem to the Seljuqs in 1073 (although some older accounts say 1076); they recaptured it in 1098 from the Artuqids, a smaller Turkish tribe associated with the Seljuqs, just before the arrival of the crusaders.|$|E

5|$|From 1974 through 1981, {{the total}} current account surplus for {{all members of}} OPEC {{amounted}} to US$450billion, without scaling-up for the subsequent decades of inflation. Ninety percent of this surplus was accumulated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> countries of the Persian Gulf and Libya, with Iran also accumulating significant oil surpluses through 1978 before suffering the hardships of revolution, war and sanctions.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the {{governing}} power within Israel remained silent. However, on May 27, the Israeli daily Maariv printed a sceptical coverage of Arab accounts, which {{spoke of a}} great victory <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> Legion, involving some 800 Israeli dead. In response, the Israeli press stressed that {{the aim of the}} operation was not to take Latrun, but to strike the Legion and, on June 1, it published casualty figures of 250 deaths for the Arab side and 10 deaths, with 20 badly wounded, and another 20 lightly wounded on the Israeli side.|$|E
5|$|The Great Recession and {{the turmoil}} caused <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> Spring have {{depressed}} Jordan's GDP growth, damaging trade, industry, construction and tourism. Tourist arrivals have dropped sharply since 2011. Jordan's finances {{have also been}} severely strained by 32 attacks on the natural gas pipeline in Sinai supplying Jordan from Egypt by Islamic State affiliates, causing it to substitute more expensive heavy-fuel oils to generate electricity. In November 2012, the government cut subsidies on fuel, increasing its price. The decision, which was later revoked, caused large scale protests to break out across the country.|$|E

5|$|The synagogue {{was founded}} in the early 18th century by {{followers}} of Judah heHasid, but it was destroyed by Muslims {{a few years later}} in 1721. The plot lay in ruins for over 140 years and became known as the Ruin, or Hurva. In 1864, the Perushim rebuilt the synagogue, and although officially named the Beis Yaakov Synagogue, it retained its name as the Hurva. It became Jerusalem's main Ashkenazic synagogue, until it too was deliberately destroyed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> Legion after the withdrawal of Israeli forces during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War.|$|E
5|$|Arab {{countries}} politically supported China in the OIC with especially Saudi Arabia and Egypt helping China squash {{any potential}} anti-Chinese motion by the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation on the Uyghurs, Egypt viewed {{its own internal}} sectarian problems like China's and Sudan was also concerned about external interference in its internal problems as well, while Indonesia {{had to deal with}} its own internal Islamists and emphasized that there was no religious conflict but instead ethnic based disturbances in Xinjiang to calm the situation down. Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt helped China kill off a statement on the Xinjiang situation in the OIC. There has been no public reaction <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> League, Saudi Arabia and Iran on the situation and China has built stronger relations with Iran and Saudi Arabia due to their influence in the Islamic world.|$|E
5|$|Haleem {{originated}} as an Arabic {{dish with}} meat and pounded wheat {{as the chief}} ingredients. It was introduced to Hyderabad <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> diaspora during {{the rule of the}} sixth Nizam, Mahbub Ali Khan, and later became an integral part of Hyderabadi cuisine during the rule of the seventh Nizam, Mir Osman Ali Khan. Sultan Saif Nawaz Jung Bahadur, an Arab chief from Mukalla, Hadhramaut, Yemen, who was among the seventh Nizam's court nobility, popularised it in Hyderabad. Addition of local flavours to the original recipe resulted in a taste distinct from other types of haleem.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of this defeat, and with rumours circulating in Constantinople of his death, Theophilos's position was precarious. He abandoned the campaign and withdrew to Dorylaion, whence he soon departed for the imperial capital. Ancyra itself was left abandoned, and plundered <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> army on 27 July. Then the united Abbasid army marched unopposed to Amorion, which fell after a siege of two weeks. Out of its entire population of some 70,000, only about half survived the brutal sack, to be sold as slaves. The fall {{of the city was}} one of the heaviest blows Byzantium suffered in the entire 9th century, both in material and symbolic terms. Fortunately for the Empire, news of a rebellion in the Caliphate forced al-Mu'tasim to withdraw soon after.|$|E
5|$|Jordan's law {{enforcement}} is under {{the purview of the}} Public Security Directorate (which includes approximately 50,000 persons) and the General Directorate of Gendarmerie, both of which are subordinate to the country's Ministry of Interior. The first police force in the Jordanian state was organised {{after the fall of the}} Ottoman Empire on 11 April 1921. Until 1956 police duties were carried out <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> Legion and the Transjordan Frontier Force. After that year the Public Safety Directorate was established. The number of female police officers is increasing. In the 1970s, it was the first Arab country to include females in its police force. Jordan's {{law enforcement}} was ranked 37th in the world and 3rd in the Middle East, in terms of police services' performance, by the 2016 World Internal Security and Police Index.|$|E
5|$|Lajjun was {{allotted to}} the Arab {{state in the}} 1947 United Nations Partition Plan. The village was defended <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> Liberation Army (ALA). It was first {{assaulted}} by the Haganah on April 13, during the battle around kibbutz Mishmar HaEmek. ALA commander Fawzi al-Qawuqji claimed Jewish forces ("Haganah") had attempted to reach the crossroads at Lajjun in an outflanking operation, but the attack failed. The New York Times reported that twelve Arabs were killed and fifteen wounded during that Haganah offensive. Palmach units of the Haganah raided and blew up much of Lajjun {{on the night of}} April 15–16.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, Palestinian historiography and {{collective}} memory {{point out that}} during the exodus of Palestinian Arab population of the 1948 War the massacres and forced expulsions that happened {{could be seen as}} ethnic cleansing. In the Latrun zone, this affected about 20 villages and ten thousand Palestinian Arabs. Some inhabitants fled during the fights of April but most fled when the Israelis attacked their village during the following operations. After capturing a village, the Israeli soldiers systematically expelled the non-combatants, intimidating them to leave and demolishing houses. A massacre of between thirty and seventy Arabs took place some days after Abu Shusha was taken. Most villages were levelled, {{so as not to be}} used <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> volunteers and to prevent the inhabitants returning. In some cases Jewish settlements were established on village land.|$|E
5|$|The Abbasids {{were unable}} to exploit their success due to the {{internal}} instability of the Caliphate. Likewise, the Byzantines preferred to focus their strength against the ongoing conquest of Sicily by the Aghlabids. Thus, a Byzantine embassy was sent to Baghdad in 845, which was warmly received. The Abbasids reciprocated with an embassy to Constantinople, where the two states agreed on a truce and a prisoner exchange, which {{was held at the}} river Lamos on 16 September 845. A winter raid <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> governor of Tarsus shortly after failed disastrously, after which the Arab-Byzantine frontier remained quiet for six years.|$|E
5|$|The tourism {{sector is}} {{considered}} a cornerstone of the economy, being a large source of employment, hard currency and economic growth. In 2010, there were 8 million visitors to Jordan. The result was $3.4 billion in tourism revenues, $4.4 billion with the inclusion of medical tourists. The majority of tourists coming to Jordan are from European and Arab countries. The tourism sector in Jordan has been severely affected by regional turbulence. The most recent blow to the tourism sector was caused <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> Spring, which scared off tourists from the entire region. Jordan experienced a 70% {{decrease in the number}} of tourists from 2010 to 2016.|$|E

5|$|Upon arrival, {{the three}} are framed and {{arrested by the}} {{authorities}} under various charges. Thomson and Thompson are cleared and released, but Tintin is kidnapped <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> insurgent Bab El Ehr, who mistakenly believes that Tintin has informations for him concerning an arms delivery. Tintin escapes and encounters an old enemy, Dr. Müller, sabotaging an oil pipeline. He reunites with Thomson and Thompson during a sandstorm and eventually arrives in Khemed's capital city of Wadesdah. When Tintin narrates the sabotage orchestrated by Müller to the Emir Mohammed Ben Kalish Ezab, one of the Emir's attendants, Ali Ben Mahmud, informs the Emir that his son Prince Abdullah is kidnapped. Tintin suspects that Müller is responsible and assures the Emir that he would rescue Abdullah.|$|E
5|$|While {{there was}} no {{accompanying}} political liberalization, with Gaddafi retaining predominant control, in March 2010, the government devolved further powers to the municipal councils. Rising numbers of reformist technocrats attained positions in the country's governance; best known was Gaddafi's son and heir apparent Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, who was openly critical of Libya's human rights record. He led a group who proposed the drafting of the new constitution, although it was never adopted. Involved in encouraging tourism, Saif founded several privately run media channels in 2008, but after criticizing the government they were nationalized in 2009. In October 2010, Gaddafi apologized to African leaders for the historical enslavement of Africans <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> slave trade.|$|E
5|$|After Hergé had redrawn The Black Island for {{publication}} in the United Kingdom, his British publishers at that time, Methuen, suggested that alterations be made to Land of Black Gold before releasing it into the UK market. In the original versions Tintin arrived in British-occupied Palestine, where he was arrested by British police before being captured by the Zionist paramilitary organization Irgun, who mistake him for {{one of their own}} agents. In this revised version Tintin arrives in Khemed, where he is arrested <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> military police before being captured and taken to Bab El Ehr. The inclusion of forces from the British Palestinian Mandate and the Irgun were no longer seen as relevant and so were removed from the story. Background detail was changed accordingly, with Jewish shop fronts with Hebrew signage being removed. A number of characters were also dropped, including the British officers Thorpe and Lieutenant Edwards. Whereas earlier versions had contained fictional Arabic script, for the 1971 version this was corrected to real Arabic.|$|E
