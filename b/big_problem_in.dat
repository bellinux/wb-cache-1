25|$|From the {{application}} protocol point of view, TLS {{belongs to a}} lower layer, although the TCP/IP model is too coarse to show it. This means that the TLS handshake is usually (except in the STARTTLS case) performed before {{the application}} protocol can start. In the name-based virtual server feature being provided by the application layer, all co-hosted virtual servers share the same certificate because the server has to select and send a certificate immediately after the ClientHello message. This is a <b>big</b> <b>problem</b> <b>in</b> hosting environments because it means either sharing the same certificate among all customers or using a different IP address for each of them.|$|E
25|$|Most Yemenis are {{employed}} in agriculture. Sorghum {{is the most common}} crop. Cotton and many fruit trees are also grown, with mangoes being the most valuable. A <b>big</b> <b>problem</b> <b>in</b> Yemen is the cultivation of Khat, a psychoactive plant that releases a stimulant when chewed, and accounts for up to 40 percent of the water drawn from the Sana'a Basin each year, and that figure is rising. Some agricultural practices are drying the Sana'a Basin and displaced vital crops, which has resulted in increasing food prices. Rising food prices, in turn, pushed an additional six percent of the country into poverty in 2008 alone. Efforts are being made by the Government and Dawoodi Bohra community at North Yemen to replace qat with coffee plantations.|$|E

25|$|Some Portuguese {{employers}} and families {{are of the}} opinion that the existence of private education institutions, where accessibility is based primarily on ability to pay, is not as fair as the public system and could gloom the meritocracy concept, leading to easier entrance criteria and lower teaching standards. Some private institutions are known for making it easy for students to enter and also to get higher grades - as long as they pay. Others claim that the private systems could prevent a significant portion of Portugal's population from being able to attend these schools that is also unfair. The quotas imposed on public education institutions to create room for students from former Portuguese colonies, who get automatically a place in those institutions also creates a <b>big</b> <b>problem</b> <b>in</b> terms of fairness, as some of these students can enter with very low grades excluding a portion of the Portuguese born students from studying in the public institutions and first choice courses they want.|$|E

Yet while that's a bit valid, it's also an exciting and surprising finale, that actually offers some bigger shocks than season 1." [...] Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave a mostly positive review, praising the reveal of Beaver as the murderer while being slightly critical of his reveal as Veronica's rapist. He wrote that [...] "as twists go, this was a good one" [...] and that [...] "Kyle Gallner makes the transition from goofy, kind of pathetic little brother to insane mastermind quite well—the circles under his eyes, specifically, which seemed to indicate anxiety before suddenly indicated darkness and insanity when seen in a new light." [...] Regarding the rape reveal, the reviewers wrote that [...] "On a narrative level, I was fine with it...it's still a <b>big</b> <b>problem</b> <b>in</b> an emotional sense. In general, rape is a difficult subject, and to see it used as a plot device creates problems on its own." [...] Kaiser summed up his review by writing, [...] "'Not Pictured' acts as an effective capstone for a chaotic season. Sure, it doesn't entirely work, but overall, it gets the job done with emotion and flair." ...|$|E

It's necessary to put your hand on the artist while he sings. They have to react to you. Even if they're mad at you, it's better than nothing. When Columbia Records producer George Avakian gave jazz arranger Gil Evans a copy of the Spanish World Library LP, Miles Davis and Evans were [...] "struck by the beauty of pieces such as the 'Saeta', recorded in Seville, and a panpiper's tune ('Alborada de Vigo') from Galicia, and worked them into the 1960 album, Sketches of Spain." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gibson's {{script was}} mockingly {{summed up by}} him as [...] "Space commies hijack alien eggs – <b>big</b> <b>problem</b> <b>in</b> Mallworld". The story picked up after Aliens, with the Sulaco {{drifting}} into an area of space claimed by the [...] "Union of Progressive Peoples". The ship is boarded by people from the U.P.P., who are attacked by a facehugger hiding in the entrails of Bishop's mangled body. The soldiers blast the facehugger into space and take Bishop with them for further study. The Sulaco then arrives at a space station-shopping mall hybrid named Anchorpoint. With Ripley put in a coma, Hicks explores the station and discovers Weyland-Yutani are developing an Alien army. In the meantime, the U.P.P. are doing their own research, which led them to repair Bishop. Eventually Anchorpoint and the U.P.P stations are overrun with the Aliens, and Hicks must team up with the survivors to destroy the parasites. The film ends with a teaser for a fourth movie, where Bishop suggests to Hicks that humans are united against a common enemy, and they must track the Aliens to their source and destroy them. The screenplay was very action oriented, featuring an extended cast, and is considered in some circles as superior to the final film and has a considerable following on the Internet. The producers were on the whole unsatisfied with the screenplay, which Giler described as [...] "a perfectly executed script that wasn't all that interesting", particularly for not taking new directions with the initial pitch. They still liked certain parts, such as the subtext making the Alien {{a metaphor for the}} HIV, but felt it lacking the human element present in Aliens and Gibson's trademark cyberpunk aesthetic. Following the end of the WGA strike, Gibson was asked to make rewrites with Harlin, but declined, citing various other commitments and [...] "foot dragging on the producers' part." ...|$|E
