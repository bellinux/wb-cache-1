5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 7th centuryBC, the Iron-Age Etruscan civilization (Latin: Etrusci) was dominant in the region. Like most of the other peoples in the region, the Romans warred against the Etruscans. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>close</b> of the century, the Romans had lost their struggle for independence, and the Etruscans had conquered Rome, establishing a military dictatorship, or kingdom, in the city.|$|E

5|$|<b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>close</b> of {{the first}} day, the 7th Army was still largely mobilising and concentrating, and fifth column actions meant that nearly all the {{fighting}} was conducted by border troops. The 38th Infantry Division Dravska was deployed along the southern bank of the Drava, with the 128th Infantry Regiment and an artillery battalion around Ptuj, the 45th Infantry Regiment and an artillery battalion around Maribor and the 112th Infantry Regiment and an artillery battalion were at Slovenj Gradec and marching east towards Dravograd. German and Italian air attacks interfered with the deployment of troops and command was hampered by reliance on civilian telegraph and telephone services.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} October, the New Zealand Division was {{positioned}} {{to the west of}} the fortified town of Le Quesnoy. On 4 November, the next phase of the Allied advance began with the Battle of the Sambre. The division was tasked with the capture of Le Quesnoy and extending the front line past the town. The Rifle Brigade encircled and, through the achievement of its 4th Battalion in scaling the ramparts that surrounded the town, pushed into Le Quesnoy <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>close</b> of the day while the 1st Brigade had established a line to the east.

With rising {{tensions}} in Europe, the British began to withdraw troops from Palestine for use elsewhere. The conclusion of the Munich Agreement—on 30September 1938—calmed the rising tensions in Europe and averted war, allowing the British to resume their military build-up in Palestine.|$|E
5|$|In {{building}} for the 1982–83 campaign, Charlton signed experienced defender Mick Lyons from Everton and by Christmas Wednesday were top of the table. The club had a limited squad and successful cup runs took their toll, as did injuries to McCulloch and Brian Hornsby as they drifted down to sixth place <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>close</b> of the season. They reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup, losing 2–1 to Brighton & Hove Albion at Highbury with key player Gary Megson out injured. Charlton announced his departure from Hillsborough in May 1983 despite pleas from the directors for him to stay.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, the ATC made {{progress}} toward protecting the trail from development, thanks to efforts {{of politicians and}} officials. The National Trails System Act of 1968 designated the Pacific Crest Trail and Appalachian Trail as the first national scenic trails and {{paved the way for}} a series of National Scenic Trails within the National Park and National Forest systems. Trail volunteers worked with the National Park Service to map a permanent route for the trail, and by 1971 a permanent route had been marked (though minor changes continue to this day). <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>close</b> of the 20th century, the Park Service had completed the purchase of all but a few miles of the trail's span.|$|E

5|$|Kirkland, Cifelli, {{and colleagues}} {{noted that the}} fauna of the Mussentuchit – iguanodonts, pachycephalosaurs, and ceratopsians – bears strong {{similarities}} to contemporary Asian faunas. They proposed that Eolambia {{was part of an}} influx of Asian dinosaurs into North America during the Cenomanian, which supplanted the earlier low-diversity native fauna. This hypothesis is supported <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>close</b> relationship between Eolambia and either Probactrosaurus or Fukuisaurus, which have respectively been recovered by the phylogenies of Head and Sues & Averianov.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, former Ohio Works {{players in}} Zanesville quickly regained their momentum. In March 1907, the new club was {{admitted}} into the Pennsylvania–Ohio–Maryland League, a Division D league. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>close</b> of the 1907 season, the club had seized the championship of the eight-team P-O-M league. In 1908, Hogan's final season as manager, {{the team was}} christened as the Zanesville Infants and joined the Central League. Further {{research is needed to}} determine the Zanesville Infants' league ranking at the close of the 1908 season, but available information shows that the team neither won the championship nor placed as a runner-up.|$|E

5|$|On April 30, 1864, the 22nd broke {{camp and}} marched {{southeast}} from Rappahannock Station. Lieutenant General Ulysses Grant had now assumed command of Union forces as general-in-chief and although Major General George Meade remained {{in command of}} the Army of the Potomac, Grant was determined to follow the army in the field, directing its movements. The resulting campaign during the spring of 1864 was known as the Overland Campaign and saw relentless attacks {{on the part of the}} Union army under Grant. The reinforced 22nd began the campaign with about 300 men. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>close</b> of the campaign, the regiment would be reduced to about 100.|$|E
5|$|Plantations {{continued}} to develop along {{the fringes of}} present-day West Virginia. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>close</b> of the 18th century, Harman Blennerhassett had constructed a mansion on his plantation on Blennerhassett Island and Moses Shepherd had built Shepherd Hall near Wheeling, both in the Ohio River valley. Despite the agricultural development of then western Virginia's bottomlands and the resulting wealth of the plantation owners, the hinterlands of the Allegheny Mountains and Allegheny Plateau regions remained underpopulated and inhabited by subsistence farmers of meager means {{into the middle of}} the 19th century. By the 1860 United States Census, Berkeley, Greenbrier, Hampshire, Hardy, Jefferson, Kanawha, and Monroe counties consequently had the largest populations of slaves in present-day West Virginia.|$|E
5|$|The city later {{known as}} Kingsley {{was once a}} village in a {{different}} location named Quorn, being named after the Quorn Hunt in England. Quorn was founded by two brothers, Frederick and William B. Close on September 18, 1880. It started with William's and W. Roylance Court Jr.'s 2,000 acre farm, which contained buildings, sheds, and hundreds of livestock. The livestock included sheep, bucks, ewes, cattle, and hogs. Quorn, through investments <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Close</b> brothers, later included a post office, country store, and social center. Quorn continued to grow to include a population of 300 to 400 people and multiple buildings on Main Street.|$|E

5|$|Although <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>close</b> of the 1860s, Denver {{residents}} {{could look}} with pride at their success establishing a vibrant supply and service center, {{the decision to}} route the nation's first transcontinental railroad through Cheyenne, rather than Denver, threatened the prosperity of the young town. A daunting 100 miles away, citizens mobilized to build a railroad to connect Denver to the transcontinental railroad. Spearheaded by visionary leaders including Territorial Governor John Evans, David Moffat, and Walter Cheesman, fundraising began. Within three days, $300,000 had been raised, and citizens were optimistic. Fundraising stalled before enough was raised, forcing these visionary leaders {{to take control of}} the debt-ridden railroad. Despite challenges, on June 24, 1870, citizens cheered as the Denver Pacific completed the link to the transcontinental railroad, ushering in a new age of prosperity for Denver.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{had only}} scored 41 runs in four innings between Tests, Harvey was {{retained}} for the Fifth and final Test at The Oval. England elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch. Precipitation in the week {{leading up to the}} match had delayed the start, and Yardley’s decision to bat was regarded as a surprise, as the weather suggested that bowlers would enjoy the conditions. This proved to be correct as Australia cut England down for 52 on the first day, with Lindwall (6/20) in particular managing to make the ball bounce at variable heights. Australia had already passed England <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>close</b> of play, reaching 2/153. The next day, Harvey came to the crease at 4/243 and quickly displayed the exuberance of youth. He hit Jack Young for a straight-driven four and then pulled him for another. Harvey then succumbed to Eric Hollies for 17, hitting a catch to Young, leaving Australia at 5/265. The Warwickshire spinner noticed this, and delivered a topspinner that dipped more than usual, and the batsman mistimed his off-drive, which went in the air towards mid-off. Australia finished at 389 and then bowled England out for 188 to complete victory by an innings and 149 runs and seal the series 4–0.|$|E
