5000|$|On July 21, 1970, Kirby {{was working}} on a no-hitter against the New York Mets after eight innings, but trailed 1-0 as the Mets scored in the first inning after a walk to Tommie Agee. Agee stole second <b>base.</b> <b>Bud</b> Harrelson popped up to the shortstop Kirby walked Ken Singleton, and the Mets did a double steal. Agee was now on third, Singleton was on second and Art Shamsky was the batter. He hit a ground ball to second baseman Ron Slocum, who threw him out as Agee scored. With two outs, Manager Preston Gómez had Cito Gaston pinch-hit for him {{in the bottom of the}} eighth, denying him a chance to {{complete}} the no-hitter. The 10,373 fans in attendance booed long and loud. Relief pitcher Jack Baldschun then gave up two runs and three hits in the ninth. Mets Jim McAndrew had retired 15 batters in a row en route to what would be a three-hit, 3-0 victory for the Mets. According to Mets pitcher Tom Seaver. “The Mets bench just gasped in disbelief,” Seaver told sportswriter Joe Durso. [...] "I personally would have let him hit. If the pennant race were involved, no. But in this situation, yes.” That season, Kirby posted a 10-16 record with a 4.53 ERA. The next two years Kirby had numbers of 15-13, 2.83 (with 13 complete games) in 1971 and 12-14, 3.13 in 1972. In 1973 his record fell to 8-18 with a 4.79 ERA.|$|E

40|$|Flower grading is a {{significant}} task because it is extremely convenient for managing the flowers in greenhouse and market. With the development of computer vision, flower grading has become an interdisciplinary focus in both botany and computer vision. A new dataset named BjfuGloxinia contains three quality grades; each grade consists of 107 samples and 321 images. A multi-input convolutional neural network is designed for large scale flower grading. Multi-input CNN achieves a satisfactory accuracy of 89. 6 % on the BjfuGloxinia after data augmentation. Compared with a single-input CNN, the accuracy of multi-input CNN is increased by 5 % on average, demonstrating that multi-input convolutional neural network is a promising model for flower grading. Although data augmentation contributes to the model, the accuracy is still limited by lack of samples diversity. Majority of misclassification {{is derived from the}} medium class.

50|$|The grapes have a cotton-like bud burst, {{which is}} bronze or {{yellowish}} in colour, with light reddish edge, {{and not very}} intense at the tip. The grapes have a trailing growing habit. The leaves of the Airén are average in size and have a pentagonal shape. The lower lateral sinuses are less marked than the upper ones and the upper face of the leaf is yellowish green in color while the lower face is velvety. The grape bunch is large in size and has an average compactness. It can grow in two different shapes: cylindrical or as a long cone. The grapes are large and spherical and have a yellowish color. The grapes are late to bud burst and also late to ripen. They yield about 4.5 to 6 kg per vine. Further, this grape is very resistant to drought and the <b>base</b> <b>buds</b> are fertile and thus resists very short pruning and still have acceptable yields.|$|R

40|$|A 5 year old, female spayed, American Cocker Spaniel was {{presented}} to the Cornell University Hospital for Animals Internal Medicine Service for dysphagia and a recurring fever of unknown origin. On presentation she was mentally dull, febrile, had peripheral lymphadenomegaly of the mandibular, prescapular and popliteal lymph nodes, discomfort on palpation of her neck, and chorioretinitis in both eyes. A subcutaneous mass was detected over her right scapula and a small scab was found on the lateral metatarsal region of her right hind limb.

Harmonious taste, weight of bunches and berries, transportability factor fixed high yield of grapes standard (85, 6 - 86, 4 %) with different length of fruit vines. The highest productivity of leaves makes pruning fruit vines to 10 - 12 buds. The strength of shoot growth and volume growth of bushes reduced at an elongation of the fruit vines.

40|$|Astracantha adscendens is an {{endemic species}} in Iran growing on alpine and above alpine timberline {{habitats}} on the Zagross Mountain Range. These habitats {{are characterized by}} steep slopes, heavy snowfalls and long ice formation periods. The present study {{was carried out in}} Chelgerd, Bakhtiari, and Fereidan, Isfahan. Slopes, elevation above sea-level, and magnetic north azimuth were measured. The canopy cover was also measured along four radii in upward, downward, left and right directions. Regression analysis was performed for the measured values of plant and environmental factors. The results revealed that the upward radius had a high negative correlation with slope changes while the downward radius showed no relationship with slope variations. The two left and right radii had a high and positive relationship with each other, both reducing in length as the slope steepness increased. Shrub volume decreases with increasing slope steepness. Plant shape was classified into seven groups using Sorenson similarity index and constructing the dendrogram. Snow pressure bends the stem toward the soil surface. Snow gliding pressure scratches stem and its <b>base</b> <b>buds</b> above the bent stem. Soil and debris move downward the slope as a result of snow gliding and rainfall runoff as well as wildlife and domestic animals. Snow gliding along with other natural factors have various effects on A. adscendens plant form which can be grouped under three categories: direct mechanical effect of snow, physiological effect of snow, and indirect effect of precipitation and wildlife. The environmental factors and plant physiological responses to them change the A. adscendens plant form from a funnel or ob-conical shape to a semi-funnel or semi ob-conical form...|$|R
40|$|In September 2011 an {{outbreak}} of the microsporidian parasite Thelohania contejeani (Henneguy, 1892) was reported in a population of Austropotamobius pallipes in Lombardy (Northern Italy). Macroscopically affected white-clawed crayfish collected from Agna creek, tributary of the river Chiese, {{in the province of}} Brescia, were analyzed using histological and bio-molecular techniques. Microscopicexamination of the abdominal and cardiac striated muscle fibers revealed microsporidia in several developmental stages with abundance of sporophorous vesicles and free mature spores. PCR and DNA sequencing reffered the parasite to species T. contejeani. Nearly half of the specimens affected by thelohaniasis also harboured a systemic infection by a yeast-like organism. Budding yeast-like cells were observed intracellularly in circulating haemocytes and free in the host haemolymph, particularly evident in the haemal sinuses of the hepatopancreas. These elliptical narrow <b>base</b> <b>budding</b> yeast cells (2, 1 - 2, 8 x 3, 2 - 5, 7 micron), stained positively with silver and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) reactions. No hyphae or pseudohyphae were recorded. Yeast proliferation in the haemolymphatic system of crustaceans has been described from the order Isopoda, Amphipoda, Calanoida, Anostraca and Decapoda frequently associated with other pathogens. The co-infection of T. contejeani and yeast-like organisms in A. pallipes has been already described in England (Pixell Goodrich, 1965) and it has been speculated that yeasts could cause death by physically inhibiting haemolymph flow, as it was observed in Gammarus pulex. In the italian episode yeast infection was always associated with thelohaniasis (biased sample) and specimens appeared still viable despite heavy yeast proliferation. Further investigation are needed to identify the yeasts and to assess if they could act as primary pathogens or are mere opportunistic...|$|R
