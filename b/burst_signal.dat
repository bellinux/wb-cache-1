First, a high frequency signal, a low frequency signal, {{and a high}} frequency <b>burst</b> <b>signal</b> {{are used in the}} experiment to compare the performance. The S transform characteristic of frequency dependent resolution allows the detection of the high frequency burst. On the other hand, as the STFT consists of a constant window width, it leads to the result having poorer definition. In the second experiment, two more high frequency bursts are added to crossed chirps. In the result, all four frequencies were detected by the S transform. On the other hand, the two high frequencies bursts are not detected by STFT. The high frequencies bursts cross term caused STFT to have a single frequency at lower frequency.|$|E
50|$|The {{reference}} signal {{used for the}} vectorscope's display is the color burst that is transmitted before each line of video, which for NTSC is defined to have a phase of 180°, corresponding to the nine-o'clock position on the graticule. The actual color <b>burst</b> <b>signal</b> shows up on the vectorscope as a straight line pointing to the left {{from the center of}} the graticule.

In digital (and component analog) vectorscopes, colorburst doesn't exist; hence the phase relationship between the colorburst signal and the chroma subcarrier is simply not an issue.

40|$|In {{order to}} reduce the false alarm rate and missed {{detection}} rate of a Loose Parts Monitoring System (LPMS) for Nuclear Power Plants, a new hybrid method combining Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) together to discriminate the loose part signal is proposed. The alarm process is divided into two stages. The first stage is to detect the weak <b>burst</b> <b>signal</b> for reducing the missed detection rate. Signal is whitened to improve the SNR, and then the weak <b>burst</b> <b>signal</b> can be detected by checking the short-term Root Mean Square (RMS) of the whitened signal.

Taking the signal's LPC coefficients as its characteristics, SVM is then utilized to determine whether the signal is generated by the impact of a loose part. The experiment shows that whitening the signal in the first stage can detect a loose part <b>burst</b> <b>signal</b> even at very low SNR and thusly can significantly reduce the rate of missed detection.
