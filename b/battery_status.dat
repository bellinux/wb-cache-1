2500|$|The Insight {{uses the}} first {{generation}} of Honda's Integrated Motor Assist (IMA) hybrid technology. (The next generation, used in the Honda Civic Hybrid, is much more space-efficient.) The Insight's electric assist is an ultrathin 60mm (about 2.4inches) brushless 10-kW electric motor located on the crankshaft. Located behind the seats are a series of commercial grade [...] "D" [...] sized NiMH batteries wired to provide a nominal 144 V DC. During heavy acceleration, the NiMH batteries drive the electric motor, providing additional power; during deceleration, the motor acts as a generator and recharges the batteries using a process called regenerative braking. A computer control module regulates how much power comes from the internal combustion engine, and how much from the electric motor; in the CVT variant, it also finds the optimal gear ratio. The digital displays on the dashboard display fuel consumption instantaneously. On the manual transmission up and down arrows suggest when to shift gears. Dashboard gauges monitor the current <b>battery</b> <b>status,</b> instantaneous fuel consumption, and mode of the electric motor — standby, engine assist or charging the batteries. High pressure, low rolling resistance tires and the use of low viscosity [...] "0W-20" [...] synthetic oil enhance fuel economy.|$|E

30|$|A {{tremendous}} {{proportion of}} the second life manufacturer’s risk {{is due to the}} need to invest in equipment for and knowledge on testing a <b>battery’s</b> <b>status</b> and properly disassembling, re-assembling, and configuring a repurposed battery system (including the BMS and additional communication hardware) (BMC:PM 1 °# 1; CBR:PE # 3; CEI:M 1  # 1; CEI:M 2 °# 2; CRL:CR 2  # 1). Since manual tests for identifying a battery’s quality and matching similar cells or modules are enormously time-consuming and require highly trained personnel, the economic feasibility of the repurposing mainly relies on the availability to assess a battery’s condition and usage history to limit the manual testing (Cready et al. 2003; Zhang et al. 2014; Neubauer et al. 2015) (CEI:M 1  # 1; ATI:MD # 2). In addition, a second life manufacturer faces high price pressure caused by new and cheaper battery systems that comprise the latest battery technology and that enter target markets as regular battery energy storage systems (Lih et al. 2012; Nykvist and Nilsson, 2015). As observed in the regular battery energy storage system business, the technical complexity of the used battery systems and the hazard potentials that go along with the selection of an inappropriate battery system and an improper installation and operation demand the second life manufacturer to build up a network of trusted trading and service partners that directly interact with the second life customers and contribute with their local infrastructure to the second life manufacturers’ business (Bräuer et al. 2016).|$|R

40|$|A {{digital device}} has been {{developed}} to meter the current drain of a battery in ampere hours.

Final output pulses are counted and displayed. The use of MOSFET and CMOS integrated circuits allows continuous battery-powered operation over a 3 -month time period to an accuracy of +/- 2 percent. The instrument will find application where accurate monitoring of <b>battery</b> charge/discharge <b>status</b> is required over long time intervals...|$|R
