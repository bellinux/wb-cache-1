25|$|That {{development}} forced GM {{to bargain}} with the union. John L. Lewis, President of the United Mine Workers and founder {{and leader of}} the Congress of Industrial Organizations, spoke for the UAW in those negotiations; UAW President Homer Martin was sent on a speaking tour to keep him out of the way. GM's representatives refused to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>room</b> as the UAW's, so Governor Frank Murphy acted as courier and intermediary between the two groups. Governor Murphy sent in the U.S. National Guard, not to evict the strikers, but rather to protect them from the police and corporate strike-breakers. The two parties finally reached agreement on February 11, 1937 on a one-page agreement that recognized the UAW as the exclusive bargaining representative for GM's employees who were members of the union for the next six months.|$|E
500|$|During production, Menzel and Jonathan Groff, who portrays Kristoff, {{went to the}} {{animation}} studio {{to explain to the}} animators how they were approaching their characters. Animators asked Menzel questions about her singing, observed how she breathed as she sang live, and made videorecordings of her recording sessions; they then animated Elsa's breathing to match Menzel's breathing, for further realism. [...] Her voice supplied inspiration for Elsa's most prominent song, [...] "Let It Go". According to composer Robert Lopez, Menzel's vocal range was able to clearly convey Elsa's [...] "low, vulnerable, fragile side" [...] as well as her power and self-realization. Menzel commented that it was [...] "an honor" [...] to have the song and that she enjoyed recording it. [...] "It's a collision of a bunch of forces that are all coming together in the right way," [...] she explained. [...] "The character, what she is singing and what she is experiencing; beautiful lyrics, beautiful melody {{and a little bit of}} me." [...] Buck and Lee were also surprised by how compatible Menzel and Kristen Bell's voices were. At one point during a table read, they sang a ballad (later revealed as [...] "Wind Beneath My Wings") back and forth to one another with so much sentiment that it reportedly left everyone who was present with tears in their eyes. Subsequently, Lee wanted Menzel and Bell to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>room</b> when they were recording the important emotional scenes of the film.|$|E

500|$|By April 2010, Joss Whedon {{was close}} to {{completing}} a deal to direct the film and to rework Penn's script, and was officially announced in July 2010. When Whedon received Penn's draft, he told Feige he felt the studio did not [...] "have anything" [...] and they should [...] "pretend this draft never happened". Whedon went on to write a five page treatment of his plan for the film, and created the tagline [...] "Avengers: Some Assembly Required", riffing on the [...] "Avengers Assemble" [...] slogan from the comic books. Marvel quickly began working to sign Whedon to write and direct, only stipulating that he include the Avengers against Loki, a battle among the heroes in the middle, a battle against the villains at the end, and he get the movie done for its May 2012 release. On the hiring, Arad stated: [...] "My personal opinion is that Joss will do a fantastic job. He loves these characters and is a fantastic writer... It's {{part of his life}} so you know he is going to protect it... I expect someone like him is going to make the script even better". Feige added, [...] "I've known Joss for many years. We were looking for the right thing and he came in and met on it... we want to find a director that’s on the verge of doing something great, as we think Joss is." [...] Whedon stated at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International, that what drew him to the film is that he loves how [...] "these people shouldn't <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>room</b> let alone on the same team—and that is the definition of family".|$|E

[...] Q called it [...] "a guaranteed delight" [...] for [...] "students of the post-war blues", while Down Beat stated, [...] "Singing, [...] playful and proud, brawny and insistent, his free-flow of inspiration spreading to his superlative road band". Dan Oppenheimer of Rolling Stone magazine said that [...] "Mannish Boy" [...] sounded like it was recorded live, while both Oppenheimer and Daniel Gioffre of Allmusic state how powerful Willie [...] "Big Eyes" [...] Smith's drumming is.

During this break, Smith joined the hard rock {{supergroup}} Chickenfoot, whose other members are Sammy Hagar, Joe Satriani and Michael Anthony. The group has released two studio albums, a live album and a box set to date with Smith. Due to touring commitments with the Chili Peppers in 2011, Smith was unable to tour with Chickenfoot and was replaced by Kenny Aronoff. In 2012, Smith rejoined Chickenfoot for a four-song encore and the band briefly reunited for only two shows on May 7, and May 8, 2016 at Harrah's Showroom at South Lake Tahoe. During the show, the band debuted a brand new song titled [...] "Divine Termination." [...] In June 2016, Smith discussed the future of Chickenfoot touring and recording new music saying that [...] "everyone has different things going on.

2500|$|Kathleen Mary [...] "Kathy" [...] Griffin {{was born}} on November 4, 1960, in the Chicago suburb of Oak Park, Illinois, to Mary Margaret [...] "Maggie" [...] Griffin (née Corbally; born June 10, 1920) and John Patrick Griffin (October 29, 1915 – February 17, 2007), both first-generation Irish Americans. Maggie worked as a cashier for Oak Park Hospital. Griffin has four older siblings: Kenny, Joyce, Gary, and John. Griffin {{described}} herself during her early years as [...] "a kid who needed to talk, all the time." [...] She would often visit her neighbors, the Bowens, to tell them stories about her family; she has referred to those visits as her first live shows and {{the place where she}} learned [...] "the power of juicy material." [...] After most of her siblings had moved, Griffin often spent hours alone in the house and developed a binge eating disorder. She explained that even though eating disorders were not very well known at that time, she knew her eating behavior was aberrant and always threw the garbage away in the neighbor's can. In her 2009 autobiography Official Book Club Selection, Griffin confessed that she [...] "still suffers [...] " [...] but has learned to [...] "deal with them." [...] In the same book, Griffin discussed her eldest brother, Kenny, who was a drug addict and homeless at various times, and revealed that she was [...] "afraid of him until the moment he died" [...] due to his violent, abusive nature. Griffin states that Kenny would climb into bed with her when he was 30 and she was 7 and [...] "whisper" [...] into her ears; Kathy refused to speak to him or <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>room</b> as him for years but didn't tell her parents until she was in her twenties, at which point he openly admitted pedophilia to their parents.|$|E
2500|$|Men {{and women}} hold unique roles in Tongan society. A man usually holds {{the power and}} is {{considered}} {{the head of his}} household. However, a man has an obligation to care for his sister and her children. So in Tongan families ones maternal uncle or Fa'etangata, is considered lower in ranking because of his obligation {{to take care of the}} needs of his sister and her children. Contrastly in Tongan families your paternal aunt is the highest-ranking member and is referred to as mehekitanga or Fahu. Men hold power and women hold rank. In ancient Tonga one would inherit titles, land and people from their mother, after Christianity this was changed to mainly inheriting from ones father. Until recently it was Tapu (taboo) for any male that has passed puberty to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>room</b> with his sister or girl cousins alone. This was done under the notion of respect or faka'apa'apa. The recent introduction of western ideas and culture has slowly made this taboo vary widely amongst Tongan families. At one time it was inappropriate for a brother and sister to even watch television together if the characters were to kiss or even flirt on screen. That is mostly laxed in the modern age, but you still have families that will separate the boys and girls when watching TV or movies. The notion of faka'apa'apa is still strong but the meaning of it is slowly changing especially amongst the youth of the Tongan diaspora. Other key members of Tongan kinship are the 'Ulumotu'a or the oldest male in ones extended family on your father's side, they are usually called upon to be in charge of funerals and other family events. They do not out rank a Fahu but they have power to direct events. Also noteworthy [...] is all of your maternal aunts are called your mothers, likewise you paternal uncles are your fathers. Your cousins on either side are called your brothers or sisters. Similarly if you are female and your sisters children are called your children also because you are a mother to them. Same applies if you are a male and your brothers children will refer to you as a father.|$|E
