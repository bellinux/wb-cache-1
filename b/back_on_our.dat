In a June 2008 interview initiated and arranged by his publicist, he promoted his book Churchill, Hitler and the Unnecessary War. During the broadcast, Buchanan defended Charles Lindbergh against charges of antisemitism, stating that his reputation [...] "has been blackened because of a single speech he gave {{and a couple of}} paragraphs in it where he said that... the Jewish community is beating the drums for warbut frankly, no one has said what he said was palpably untrue." [...] At the end of the interview, James Edwards said, [...] "Mr. Buchanan, {{thank you so much for}} coming <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> program, for fighting for our people." [...] Previously, in September 2006, Buchanan had made an appearance to promote his book State of Emergency; during this interview, he said that [...] "we are being invaded by people of different cultures" [...] and argued that Americans [...] "cannot survive a bifurcated culture or a heavily Hispanicized culture, tilted towards Mexico... I think that's the beginning of the end of the United States." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 4 May 1923, Churchill {{spoke in}} favour of the French {{occupation}} of the Ruhr, which was extremely unpopular in Britain saying: [...] "We must not allow any particular phrase of French policy to estrange us from the great French nation.

"I'm afraid, Captain Daggett, that we {{have both}} of us turned <b>our</b> <b>backs</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> true course, when we {{suffered}} ourselves to get jammed away down here, on Hatteras.

Friendship is first, Friendship last. But it is equally impossible to forget our Friends, and to make them answer to our ideal. When they say farewell, then indeed we begin to keep them company. How often we find ourselves turning <b>our</b> <b>backs</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> actual Friends, that we may go and meet their ideal cousins. I would that I were worthy to be any man's Friend.|$|R
2500|$|At {{the time}} he surrendered, Meng Chang also sent his brother Meng Renzhi (孟仁贄) to the Song capital Kaifeng to express his humility and fear, {{including}} the language, [...] "I considered myself to have too many sins, and therefore I fear and worry." [...] The Song emperor responded in an edict to try to comfort him, [...] "As you now seek better fortune, your prior offenses are forgiven. [...] We will not go <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> own words. [...] You should not worry." [...] The edict did not refer to Meng Chang by name, to show a degree of respect to him, and also referred to Empress Dowager Li as [...] "the Mother of the State" [...] to also show similar respect to her.|$|E
2500|$|After it was {{confirmed}} that Taylforth {{was returning to}} EastEnders, executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins teased about Gavin in May 2015 when he said of Kathy's return: [...] "It's a big, big story with lots of twists and turns. We know that there was a man named Gavin, who Kathy went off with to South Africa. So there's Gavin, Kathy—and lots of Phil [...] involved." [...] Then, on 17 June, Treadwell-Collins posted on Twitter a photo of part of a script, featuring Gavin, and the caption [...] "He's on his way...". The following day, 18 June, Paul Nicholas's casting in the role was announced, and it {{was confirmed}} that the character would play a major part in Kathy's return storyline. Nicholas said of his role: [...] "I am delighted to be joining the wonderful cast of EastEnders for {{what is going to be}} an exciting time ahead. I can't wait to get started and seeing what's in store for my character." [...] Executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins said: [...] "We are all thrilled that Paul has agreed to join our cast to play Gavin. So many British television viewers have grown up with Paul Nicholas so it's brilliant to have him <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> screens, playing a major part in Kathy's explosive return to the Square, while also holding the key to many more of the Square's secrets." [...] Nicholas later said it was [...] "great" [...] for him to join a [...] "brilliantly produced and very well acted" [...] show, but said it was [...] "quite daunting" [...] as he had not acted in a soap opera before. He said that when he joined the cast, he met the writers who explained the character to him and gave him a [...] "really good insight into where they wanted it to go" [...] and added, [...] "It is nice to be involved in something so successful and that people actually watch." [...] Two days after Nicholas's casting was announced, Nicholas and Taylforth were seen filming on location at King's Cross station, for Gavin's introduction scene that aired on 21 August 2015, and on 30 June, on-location photos emerged of Nicholas, Taylforth, Steve McFadden (Phil Mitchell) and Samantha Womack (Ronnie Mitchell), filming at an airfield in Essex, for Gavin's third episode, broadcast on 11 September 2015.|$|E

40|$|Until {{recently}} {{we spoke}} of the “new South Africa” with a certain relish. We imagined that we had turned <b>our</b> <b>backs</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> colonial and apartheid past. While there was always sufficient prejudice and racism and religious bigotry around to cause us to question this assumption, we hoped that these outbursts were hangovers from the past that would in time wither away. The recent xenophobic attacks have changed this perception. Newspapers remind us {{that we have a}} long history of hating others. Building on a World Values Survey on International Attitudes to Immigration, the Southern African Migration Project (Samp) has found that South Africans held the harshest views on foreigners among 29 nations surveyed before 2002. A new as yet unpublished Samp survey, in turn, shows that our xenophobia is getting worse, suggesting that one-third of South Africans want all foreigners to be kicked out of the country. 9 % of respondents said they would use violence to do so...|$|R

5000|$|In 1919, Britain and the United States {{signed a}} treaty of {{alliance}} with France which the United States Senate refused to ratify, thus making the proposed Anglo-Franco-American alliance stillborn. In July 1921, Churchill argued at the Imperial conference of Dominion prime ministers that despite the rejection by the American Senate of the alliance with France that Britain should still sign a military alliance with France to guarantee post-war security. Churchill further argued that at the Paris peace conference the Americans and the British had successfully pressured the French from their plans to annex the Rhineland {{in exchange for the}} military alliance, thus creating a moral commitment for an alliance with France as the French had given up the demand for the Rhineland in exchange for an Anglo-American security guarantee that they did not get. Churchill's idea about an Anglo-French alliance was rejected at the conference as British public opinion and even more so Dominion public opinion was against the idea of the [...] "continental commitment". On 4 May 1923, Churchill spoke in favour of the French occupation of the Ruhr, which was extremely unpopular in Britain saying: [...] "We must not allow any particular phrase of French policy to estrange us from the great French nation.
