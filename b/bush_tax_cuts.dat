25|$|Should the <b>Bush</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> of 2001 and 2003 {{be allowed}} to expire in 2010 as scheduled? Ultimately, the <b>Bush</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> were allowed to expire for the highest income taxpayers only {{as part of the}} American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012.|$|E

5000|$|In 2003, Kennedy {{was criticized}} for saying [...] "I don't need <b>Bush's</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cut.</b> I have never worked a fucking day in my life." [...] His staff {{explained}} Kennedy's comment as a satirical argument against <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> for the wealthy, including him, {{some of whom have}} inherited their money.|$|R
25|$|The CBO {{estimated}} in June 2012 that the <b>Bush</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> of 2001 (EGTRRA) and 2003 (JGTRRA) added approximately $1.5 trillion total to the debt over the 2002-2011 decade, excluding interest.|$|E
25|$|The CBO {{estimated}} in January 2009 that the <b>Bush</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> would add approximately $3.0 trillion to the debt over the 2010-2019 decade if fully extended at all income levels, including interest.|$|E

Both candidates supported the death penalty, right-to-work laws, and Second Amendment rights.|$|R
50|$|On May 3, 2003, Democrats {{met at the}} University of South Carolina in {{the first}} formal debate between the nine challengers for the nomination. The {{candidates}} disagreed on the war against Iraq, health insurance, and even President <b>Bush's</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cuts,</b> but united in criticizing Bush's handling of the economy.|$|R
50|$|Stenholm {{frequently}} {{clashed with}} President Bill Clinton, and voted {{for three of}} the four articles of impeachment against him. However, he was a severe critic of the Bush Administration's fiscal policy. He voted against making <b>Bush's</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> permanent, as he now opposed cutting taxes unless the budget was balanced.|$|R
25|$|In {{terms of}} the budget legacy passed to his {{successor}} President Obama, CBO forecast in January 2009 that the deficit that year would be $1.2 trillion, assuming the continuation of Bush policies. From a policy perspective, the long-term deficit legacy depended significantly on whether the <b>Bush</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> were allowed to expire in 2010 as initially legislated. President Obama extended the <b>Bush</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> entirely {{through the end of}} 2012 as part of the 2010 Tax Relief Act, then extended them for the bottom 99% of income earners indefinitely thereafter as part of the fiscal cliff resolution, roughly 80% of the dollar value of the cuts.|$|E
25|$|One {{incident}} {{illustrates the}} nature and tensions of the debate. The U.S. added $1.0 trillion to the national debt in fiscal year (FY) 2008, which ended in September 2008. The Congressional Budget Office projected two weeks prior to Obama's first inauguration that the deficit in FY 2009 would be $1.2 trillion and that the debt increase over the following decade would be $3.1 trillion assuming the expiration of the <b>Bush</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> as scheduled in 2010, or around $6.0 trillion if the <b>Bush</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> were extended at all income levels. Adjusting other assumptions in the CBO baseline could have raised that debt level even higher.|$|E
25|$|The CBO {{estimated}} in January 2009 that extending the <b>Bush</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> at all income levels over the 2011-2019 period {{would increase the}} annual deficit {{by an average of}} 1.7% GDP, reaching 2.0% GDP in 2018 and 2019.|$|E
25|$|Giuliani {{has said}} that he <b>cut</b> <b>taxes</b> 23 times as mayor of New York City. However, the city's Independent Budget Office has pointed out that seven of these <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> were state initiatives, and that Giuliani had {{actually}} opposed the largest cut which was due to come with the expiration of a 12½-percent surcharge on the city's personal income tax. Giuliani supported President <b>Bush's</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cuts.</b>|$|R

25|$|McSweeney is a {{conservative}} Republican. He supports finishing the War on Terror and the Iraq War. McSweeney also promises to make President <b>Bush's</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> permanent, to offer <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> to companies that invest in new jobs and workers. He is opposed to raising the federal minimum wage, currently $5.15 an hour. McSweeney vows to try and freeze {{the total amount of}} federal spending, excluding national security, homeland security, and social security.|$|R
25|$|Shortly after Obama's 2012 re-election, Congressional Republicans and Obama again faced {{off over}} the final fate of the <b>Bush</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cuts.</b> Republicans sought to make all tax cuts permanent, while Obama sought to extend the tax cuts only for those making under $250,000. Obama and Congressional Republicans came to an {{agreement}} on the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which made permanent the tax cuts for individuals making less than $400,000 a year (or less than $450,000 for couples). For earnings greater than that amount, the income tax increased from 35% to 39.6%, which was the top rate before {{the passage of the}} <b>Bush</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cuts.</b> The deal also permanently indexed the alternative minimum tax for inflation, limited deductions for individuals making more than $250,000 ($300,000 for couples), permanently set the estate tax exemption at $5.12 million (indexed to inflation), and increased the top estate tax rate from 35% to 40%. Though many Republicans did not like the deal, the bill passed the Republican House in large part {{due to the fact that}} the failure to pass any bill would have resulted in the total expiration of the <b>Bush</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cuts.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{national}} debt increased from $10.0 trillion in September 2008 to $19.6 trillion in September 2016. As described above, roughly $3 trillion of this increase was anticipated in the January 2009 CBO baseline forecast, or $6-8 trillion adjusting for {{the extension of}} the <b>Bush</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> and other baseline overrides typically legislated. Obama ultimately extended the <b>Bush</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> for approximately 98% of taxpayers as part of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, allowing taxes to rise on the top 1–2% of income earners. The debt held by the public (which excludes intra-governmental liabilities like the Social Security Trust Fund) rose from around 36% GDP in 2009 to 76% GDP in 2016, the highest level except for the post World War 2 era.|$|E
25|$|President Obama pledged {{before he}} was elected not to raise taxes except on those couples earning over $250,000 (200,000 for individuals). With the <b>Bush</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> {{extension}} scheduled to expire in January 2013, President Obama had significant leverage with the Republican Congress, as his veto of further extensions {{would have resulted in}} a sizable income tax increase across the income spectrum, a significant expansion of government, but contrary to his pledge. His compromise, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA), passed by a wide majority in the Senate, with both Democrats and Republicans supporting it, while a majority of Republicans in the House opposed it. It extended the <b>Bush</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> for roughly the bottom 99% of income earners (those earning below $400,000, or $450,000 for married couples).|$|E
50|$|The table below {{shows the}} {{estimated}} impact on taxpayers from the tax increases that occurred with the expiration of the Obama payroll <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> and partial expiration of the <b>Bush</b> income <b>tax</b> <b>cuts.</b> The estimated impact is given as an average for the different income levels. The baseline that is used is if the payroll <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> had been extended, new health care tax not implemented, and <b>Bush</b> income <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> fully extended. Average federal taxes include individual income taxes, corporate income taxes, payroll taxes, and estate taxes {{as a percentage of}} average cash income.|$|R
25|$|After George W. Bush {{took office}} as president, Watts co-sponsored {{a bill to}} create tax {{incentives}} for charitable donations and allow religious charities to receive federal money for social programs, and proposed several new tax reductions in addition to <b>Bush's</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> plan, targeting the estate tax and marriage penalty. Watts was one of ten congressional leaders taken to an undisclosed location following the September 11 attacks.|$|R
50|$|One of Kanjorski's final {{votes in}} Congress, merely weeks before his final term ended, was a {{vote against the}} Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010, {{legislation}} {{signed into law by}} President Obama in December 2010. Kanjorski's vote in opposition to the bill stemmed from his disenchantment {{with the fact that the}} legislation extended President George W. <b>Bush's</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> for the wealthiest Americans.|$|R
25|$|Dobbs is {{the author}} of War on the Middle Class, in which he claims that both Democrats and Republicans are harming the middle class. In it, he comes out {{strongly}} against the <b>Bush</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cuts,</b> which he argues favor the wealthy, and argued for raising the U.S. minimum wage from what was then $5.15 an hour.|$|E
25|$|In Congress, Kennedy {{supported}} the <b>Bush</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cuts,</b> {{he voted for}} the Medicare Prescription Drug Plan, and the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. Kennedy's reputation as a reformer was further enhanced by his sponsorship of the line item veto, a lifetime ban on all members of Congress becoming lobbyists, full deductibility of medical expenses, no parole for sex offenders, and Medicare Plan Enrollment Fraud Protection.|$|E
25|$|As {{the economy}} {{improved}} and job creation continued during {{his second term}} (2013–2017), the <b>Bush</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> were allowed to expire for the highest income taxpayers and a spending sequester (cap) was implemented, to further reduce the deficit back to typical historical levels. Both {{the stock market and}} corporate profits reached record high levels during his tenure, while inflation and interest rates remained near record low levels.|$|E
25|$|Among Ros-Lehtinen's other {{conservative}} views include votes {{against the}} estate tax, {{voted in favor}} of <b>Bush's</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cuts,</b> for fuel efficiency standards on autos, drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, support of the Central American Free Trade Agreement, votes in favor of making the Patriot Act permanent, support of the Military Commissions Act, votes against funding for stem cell research, and votes against SCHIP.

50|$|PDA {{has worked}} to get the United States Congress to roll back President George W. <b>Bush's</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cuts,</b> and to enact {{progressive}} taxation policies including H.R. 1579 the Inclusive Prosperity Act which would impose a micro tax on certain speculative securities transactions. PDA also supports full employment legislation including H.R. 1000 the Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment and Training Act which would establish the National Full Employment Trust Fund to create employment opportunities for the unemployed.|$|R
50|$|Senator Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island, an {{opponent}} {{of the war in}} Iraq, <b>Bush's</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cuts,</b> drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and much of Bush's social agenda, considered challenging Bush in the New Hampshire primary in the fall of 2003. He decided not to run, after the capture of Saddam Hussein in December 2003. He would later change his party affiliation and run for the Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2016.|$|R
25|$|A {{candidate}} debate held in Duluth {{featured a}} crowd that jeered Oberstar, with Oberstar {{calling for a}} more civil atmosphere at the next debate. The second debate centered on economic issues. Cravaack argued that the 2003 <b>Bush</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> should be continued on all tax brackets to stimulate employment, and Oberstar said he would end the {{tax cut for the}} top two percent of earners, because the lowered tax had caused part of the deficit.|$|E
25|$|Wyden is {{critical}} of the estate tax, which he feels is inefficient, and has voted repeatedly to abolish it. He co-authored the Internet Tax Nondiscrimination Act, which bans internet taxes in the United States. He has also voted with Republicans to lower the capital gains tax, to encourage {{the study of the}} flat tax, and to require a 3/5 majority to raise taxes. However, Wyden voted against the <b>Bush</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> passed in 2001 and 2003. He has also voted against the balanced budget amendment.|$|E
25|$|Capital gains, dividends, and {{estate tax}} rates were also {{increased}} {{relative to the}} 2003–2012 levels; these also mainly affect high-income and wealthy households. It was estimated to increase revenues by $600 billion over a decade, roughly one-fifth of the amount if the tax cuts {{had been allowed to}} expire at all income levels. Stated another way, it extended roughly 80% of the <b>Bush</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> indefinitely. Separately enacted as part of Obamacare, individual mandates and tobacco taxes impacted the middle class slightly, although they were mainly designed to adjust behavior rather than gather revenue.|$|E
