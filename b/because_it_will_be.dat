25|$|At the hospital, the 99mTc {{that forms}} through 99Mo decay is {{chemically}} {{extracted from the}} technetium-99m generator. Most commercial 99Mo/99mTc generators use column chromatography, in which 99Mo {{in the form of}} water-soluble molybdate, MoO42− is adsorbed onto acid alumina (Al2O3). When the 99Mo decays, it forms pertechnetate TcO4−, which, because of its single charge, is less tightly bound to the alumina. Pulling normal saline solution through the column of immobilized 99MoO42− elutes the soluble 99mTcO4−, resulting in a saline solution containing the 99mTc as the dissolved sodium salt of the pertechnetate. One technetium-99m generator, holding only a few micrograms of 99Mo, can potentially diagnose 10,000 patients <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> producing 99mTc strongly for over a week.|$|E
25|$|In {{the hub of}} {{the wheel}} are three animals: a pig, a snake, and a bird. They {{represent}} the three poisons of ignorance, aversion, and attachment, respectively. The pig stands for ignorance; this comparison is based on the Indian concept of a pig being the most foolish of animals, since it sleeps in the dirtiest places and eats whatever comes to its mouth. The snake represents aversion or anger; this is <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> aroused and strike at the slightest touch. The bird represents attachment (also translated as desire or clinging). The particular bird used in this diagram represents an Indian bird that is very attached to its partner. These three animals represent the three poisons, which are the core of the bhavacakra. From these three poisons, the whole cycle of existence evolves.|$|E

500|$|Nine {{days before}} the final, the two clubs faced {{each other in a}} league match at Highbury. With Arsenal unable to retain the title, having lost to Leeds United, manager Arsène Wenger rested several players, as did Southampton manager Gordon Strachan, whose team started without six of their first-choice eleven. Winger Jermaine Pennant on his league debut scored a hat-trick, as did Pirès, in a 6–1 win. Strachan {{believed}} the result had little bearing on their chances of winning the cup, noting: [...] "There is little pressure on Southampton to lift the trophy.

The second movement, a recitative, reflects upon birth in the Spirit as baptism through God's grace: [...] "" [...] (In the bath of spirit and water he becomes a child of blessedness and grace).

2500|$|The {{choice of}} a viral vector to deliver genetic {{material}} to cells comes with some logistical problems. There are {{a limited number of}} viral vectors available for therapeutic use. [...] Any of these few viral vectors can cause the body to develop an immune response if the vector is seen as a foreign invader. Once used, the viral vector cannot be effectively used in the patient again <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> recognized by the body. If the vaccine or gene therapy fails in clinical trials, the virus can’t be used again in the patient for a different vaccine or gene therapy in the future. Pre-existing immunity against the viral vector could also be present in the patient rendering the therapy ineffective for that patient. It is possible to counteract pre-existing immunity when using a viral vector for vaccination by priming with a non-viral DNA vaccine, but this method presents another expense and obstacle in the vaccine distribution process. Pre-existing immunity may also be challenged by increasing vaccine dose or changing the vaccination route. Some shortcomings of viral vectors (such as genotoxicity and low transgenic expression) can be overcome through the use of [...] hybrid vectors.|$|E
