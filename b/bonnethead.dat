5|$|Four {{other species}} of hammerhead sharks overlap in range with the smalleye hammerhead: the small-sized scoophead and <b>bonnethead,</b> and the large-sized {{scalloped}} hammerhead and great hammerhead. Little competition occurs between these species because of their differing habitats and dietary preferences. The smalleye hammerhead is the dominant hammerhead in shallow, muddy areas, where high turbidity limits the utility of vision (hence its smaller eyes). Adult males and juveniles of both sexes form schools of uniform body size; these schools {{do not appear to}} relate to reproduction or migration. Adult females are apparently solitary.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, a 9-year-old female blacktip shark at the Virginia Aquarium and Marine Science Center {{was found}} to be {{pregnant}} with a single near-term female pup, despite having never mated with a male. Genetic analysis confirmed that her offspring was the product of automictic parthenogenesis, a form of asexual reproduction in which an ovum merges with a polar body to form a zygote without fertilization. Along with an earlier case of parthenogenesis in the <b>bonnethead</b> (Sphyrna tiburo), this event suggests that asexual reproduction may be more widespread in sharks than previously thought.|$|E

40|$|Understanding {{the life}} history of marine {{wildlife}} {{is essential for}} the management of both commercial and recreational fisheries. <b>Bonnetheads</b> (Sphyrna tiburo) are a component of the small coastal shark (SCS) fishery complex, and are caught regularly in both types of fisheries. Despite being well studied in the Gulf of Mexico, little is known about <b>bonnetheads</b> from the U. S. Atlantic coast. The goal of the first component {{of this study was to}} provide new, key information on their life history to improve management of U. S. Atlantic populations, particularly by identifying reproductive seasonality, periodicity and fecundity. This was accomplished by examining sexually mature male and female <b>bonnetheads,</b> collected monthly (2012 - 2014) from South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida waters, and monitoring changes in reproductive tract morphology. Changes reflected a seasonal reproductive cycle with an annual breeding periodicity. Histology was used to confirm events and identify other important periods in the reproductive cycle, such as sperm storage in females. Overall, Atlantic coast <b>bonnetheads</b> were found to exhibit reproductive patterns similar to those reported in the Gulf with slight temporal shifts in the time of mating and ovulation and slightly lower fecundity ranging between 1 and 12 with an average (±SE) of 7 ± 3. 8. Additionally, the second component of this study aimed to understand gonadal sex hormone regulation in S. tiburo reproduction with a particular focus on female sperm storage. Circulating plasma sex hormones increased in association with specific reproductive events. Plasma 17 β-estradiol and testosterone concentrations increased during sperm storage, whereas progesterone levels increased near the end of this stage. Immunocytochemical analysis of androgen, estrogen, and progesterone receptors in the oviducal viii gland, the organ that stores sperm in female <b>bonnetheads,</b> demonstrated that epithelial cells of sperm storage tubules and spermatozoa itself are direct targets for these hormones, playing a role in regulating this poorly understood process...|$|R
5|$|Fish {{and other}} aquatic prey {{taken in the}} water or at the water's edge form the major part of American alligator's diet and may be eaten {{at any time of}} the day or night. Adult American {{alligators}} also spend considerable time hunting on land, up to 50m (170ft) from water, ambushing terrestrial animals on trailsides and road shoulders. Usually, terrestrial hunting occurs on nights with warm temperatures. When hunting terrestrial prey, American alligators may also ambush them {{from the edge of the}} water by grabbing them and pulling the prey into the water, the preferred method of predation of larger crocodiles. The teeth of the American alligator are designed to grip prey, but can not rip or chew flesh like teeth of some other predators (such as canids and felids), and depend on their gizzard instead to masticate their food. The American alligator is capable of biting though a turtle's shell or a moderately sized mammal bone. Additionally, American alligators have recently been filmed and documented killing and eating sharks and rays; four incidents documented indicated that <b>bonnetheads,</b> lemon sharks, Atlantic stingrays and nurse sharks are components of the animal's diet. Sharks are also known to prey on American alligators in turn, indicating encounters between the two predators are more common than thought.|$|R
25|$|The {{dominant}} shark species {{within the}} daggernose shark's range are the smalltail shark (Carcharhinus porosus) and the <b>bonnethead</b> (Sphyrna tiburo). Its elongated snout and tiny eyes are likely consequences {{of living in}} murky sediment-laden waters, reflecting an adaptive emphasis on electroreception and other rostral senses rather than vision. The snout bears a superficial similarity to the goblin shark (Mitsukurina owstoni), some Apristurus catsharks, and the long-nosed chimaeras, all found in the deep sea. With long jaws and numerous small teeth, the daggernose shark is well-suited for capturing the small schooling fishes that comprise most of its diet. Known prey taken include herring, anchovies, catfish, and croakers.|$|E
25|$|A <b>bonnethead,</b> a type {{of small}} hammerhead shark, {{was found to have}} {{produced}} a pup, born live on 14 December 2001 at Henry Doorly Zoo in Nebraska, in a tank containing three female hammerheads, but no males. The pup was thought to have been conceived through parthenogenic means. The shark pup was apparently killed by a stingray within days of birth. The investigation of the birth was conducted by the research team from Queen's University Belfast, Southeastern University in Florida, and Henry Doorly Zoo itself, and it was concluded after DNA testing that the reproduction was parthenogenic. The testing showed the female pup's DNA matched only one female who lived in the tank, and that no male DNA was present in the pup. The pup was not a twin or clone of her mother, but rather, contained only half of her mother's DNA ("automictic parthenogenesis"). This type of reproduction had been seen before in bony fish, but never in cartilaginous fish such as sharks, until this documentation.|$|E
500|$|Until {{the first}} {{detailed}} study of the smalleye hammerhead {{was carried out in}} 198586 by José Castro of Clemson University for the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, its distinctive golden coloration was unknown to science. The color fades after death and the pigments leech into the preservative, resulting in the [...] "yellowish cast" [...] of museum specimens being regarded as an artifact of preservation. The names [...] "yellow hammerhead" [...] or [...] "golden hammerhead" [...] are used by fishermen in Trinidad for this shark, and the latter was promoted for wider usage by Castro. Another common name for this species is the curry shark. Phylogenetic analyses based on nuclear and mitochondrial DNA have found that the hammerheads with the smallest cephalofoils are the most derived members of their lineage. The closest relative of the smalleye hammerhead appears to be the scoophead (S. media), {{and the two of them}} in turn form a clade with the sister species pair of the scalloped <b>bonnethead</b> (S. corona) and the <b>bonnethead</b> (S. tiburo).|$|E
40|$|Organohalogenated {{compounds}} are {{widespread in}} the marine environment and can be {{a serious threat to}} organisms in all levels of aquatic food webs, including elasmobranch species. Information about the concentrations of POPs (persistent organic pollutants) and of MeO-PBDEs (methoxylated polybrominated diphenyl ethers) in elasmobranchs is scarce and potential toxic effects are poorly understood. The aims of the present study were therefore to investigate the occurrence of multiple POP classes (PCBs, PBDEs, DDXs, HCB, CHLs) and of MeO-PBDEs in various elasmobranch species from different trophic levels in estuarine and marine waters of the southeastern United States. Overall, levels and patterns of PCBs, PBDEs, DDXs, HCB, CHLs and of MeO-PBDEs varied according to the species, maturity stage, gender and habitat type. The lowest levels of POPs were found in Atlantic stingrays and the highest levels were found in bull sharks. As both species are respectively near the bottom and at top of the trophic web, with juvenile bull sharks frequently feeding on Atlantic stingrays, these findings further suggest a bioaccumulation and biomagnification process with trophic position. MeO-PBDEs were not detected in Atlantic stingrays, but were found in all shark species. HCB was not found in Atlantic stingrays, <b>bonnetheads</b> or lemon sharks, but was detected in the majority of bull sharks examined. Comparison with previous studies suggests that Atlantic stingrays may be experiencing toxic effects of PCBs and DDXs on their immune system. However, the effect of these compounds on the health of shark species remains unclear...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. —The {{mortality}} of released or discarded fish in commercial and recreational fisheries and in fisheries-independent research {{is a critical}} area of study for contemporary fisheries science. Key questions involving postrelease survival include the following: What fraction of the bycatch discarded in a commercial fishery survives? What is the hooking {{mortality of}} fish released by recreational anglers, and how does this vary with the treatment and condition of the fish? What fraction of tagged fish do not survive the stress of capture and tagging? What percentage of hatchery-raised fish survive after stocking? To address these and related questions, we develop a two-step approach to estimating absolute postrelease survival rates. First, fish are tagged and assigned to discrete classes based on their condition (from best to worst) at release. The relative survival of fish released in different conditions is estimated from tag returns by fitting a logistic model. Then, assuming that fish in the best condition survive {{to the same degree}} as fish that were not captured, absolute survival rates in the other categories are determined. Applying this method to one example from field research, we estimate that 69 % of blacktip sharks Carcharhinus limbatus and 60 % of <b>bonnetheads</b> Sphyrna tiburo survived the stress of gill-net capture, tagging, and release in a 1992 – 2004 study in Florida. Our method has broad application to determining the condition- or treatment-specific survival rates of released fish of many types in fisheries and research projects in which tag-and-recaptur...|$|R
40|$|The {{movement}} of <b>bonnetheads,</b> Sphyrna tiburo, within an estuarine {{system on the}} Gulf of Mexico coast of Florida was examined to define response to salinity change. Shark presence and movements were evaluated by acoustic monitoring and gillnet sampling. Acoustic monitoring data were used to investigate active selection of different zones within the estuary based on differences in salinity among zones. Sharks were monitored for 187 days in 2003 and 217 days in 2004 in salinities ranging from 11. 0 to 31. 0 ppt in 2003 and 15. 8 to 34. 6 ppt in 2004. Monitoring data supported the hypothesis that salinity {{played a role in}} the distribution and {{movement of}} S. tiburo. Catch per unit effort (CPUE) data obtained from gillnet sampling from 1995 to 2004 were examined to determine affinity or avoidance of specific salinities within the study site as calculated using an electivity index. Electivity analysis showed almost no affinity or avoidance for specific salinity values. The difference in results between the CPUE and acoustic monitoring in relation to the potential effects of salinity likely relate to the nature of the data, with acoustic monitoring providing continuous data and CPUE providing snapshot location data. The results of this study suggest that although S. tiburo are collected within a wide range of salinity levels, salinity may affect movement and distribution. Salinity effects may be more pronounced during periods of prolonged and/or large changes in salinity as detected by long-term monitoring...|$|R

500|$|After a {{gestation}} period of 1013 months, females {{give birth to}} litters of 16 (usually 23) pups. The number of offspring is not correlated with female size; each female produces an estimated average of 12 pups over her entire lifetime. Parturition occurs from May to August (autumn and winter) in French Polynesia, in July (summer) off Enewetak Atoll, and in October (summer) off Australia. Females give birth while swimming, making violent {{twists and turns of}} their bodies; each pup takes under an hour to fully emerge.

40|$|Gill {{nets and}} longlines were {{compared}} as shark nursery sampling methodologies in inshore waters of Georgia to (1) assess differences in gear selectivity, bias, and stress of capture and (2) determine potential relationships between habitat features and shark distribution and abundance. Gear selectivity varied between gears {{as a function}} of both species and life stage resulting in significantly different estimates of species and life stage compositions. Juvenile <b>bonnetheads</b> (Sphyrna tiburo) and young of the year blacktip sharks (Carcharhinus limbatus) experienced significantly higher stress from gill net capture than longline. Major sources of bias are thought to result from dietary preferences and individual size. Juvenile sandbar shark (C. plumbeus) distribution revealed a potential preference for creeks rather than sounds, between 0. 32 - 0. 8 km wide and 4. 02 - 8. 05 km from the ocean. Adult Atlantic sharpnose sharks (Rhizoprionodon terraenovae) appear to prefer larger, open sound waters closer to the ocean. A potential preference for locations in close proximity to jetties over those near oyster reefs was also observed for adult Atlantic sharpnose sharks, and while statistical significance was observed, a stronger pattern may exist, as sample sizes in this study were relatively small yet still able to detect a difference. Future investigations that quantify proportions of habitat availability and shark abundance in a given area may be more useful for identifying preferences for the structures observed in this study. This study also provides strong evidence of finetooth shark (C. isodon) primary and potentially secondary nursery habitat in areas that had not yet been documented. Findings from these investigations can be useful for managers seeking to maintain healthy coastal shark populations...|$|R
40|$|Multimodal {{sensory input}} directs simple and complex {{behaviors}} in animals. Most research {{to date has}} been limited to studies of individual senses rather than multiple senses working together, leading to important advances in our comprehension of the sensory systems in isolation, but not their complementary and alternative roles in difficult behavioral tasks, such as feeding. In the marine environment, a prey item might emit an odor, create a hydrodynamic disturbance, such as from gill movements or swimming, be visible to the predator, produce a sound, and/or produce a weak electrical field. Therefore, {{the goal of this}} study was to investigate the integration of olfaction, mechanoreception by the lateral line system, vision, and electroreception in a marine animal. Sharks were chosen as a model organism in which to investigate multisensory integration because of their sensitivity and acuity, the presence of the same suite of sensory modalities in all species, the availability of experimental animals from different species, habitats and ecologies, and the rich literature on sharks 2 ̆ 7 prey capture behavior. Two approaches were used: controlled artificial stimuli, delivered to the animals, were used to determine the spatial and concentration characteristics of odor encounters that guide the initial orientation to an odor plume in the far field in a model elasmobranch, the smooth dogfish, Mustelus canis; and sensory deprivation was used to restrict the availability of natural cues emanating from live prey items in order to elucidate the complementary and alternating roles of the senses in detecting, tracking, orienting to, striking at, and ultimately capturing prey. In the latter experiments, three species of sharks from different ecological niches were investigated: benthic, suction-feeding nurse sharks (Ginglymostoma cirratum) that hunt nocturnally for fish; ram-biting <b>bonnetheads</b> (Sphyrna tiburo) that scoop crustaceans off the bottom of seagrass beds; and ram-feeding blacktip sharks (Carcharhinus limbatus) that rapidly chase down midwater teleost prey. In orienting to odor patches, bilateral time differences between the nares are more important than concentration differences, such that animals turn toward the side stimulated first, even with delayed pulses of higher concentration. This response would steer the shark into each oncoming odor patch, helping the animal maintain contact with an odor plume. Sensory deprivation experiments revealed similarities and differences among species in terms of which senses they choose to focus on for particular behaviors, likely as a result of differences in the environments that they hunt in, type of prey consumed, and foraging strategies used, as well as anatomical differences in the central nervous system and the sensory organs. In most cases, multiple senses can be used for the same behavioral task. Thus, sharks are capable of successfully capturing prey, even when the optimal sensory cues are unavailable, by switching to alternative sensory modalities, which indicates that feeding behavior is plastic. Nurse sharks rely primarily on olfaction for detection. Olfaction in combination with vision, the lateral line, or touch is required for tracking. Nurse sharks orient to prey using the lateral line, vision, or electroreception, but will not ingest food if olfaction is blocked. Capture is mediated by the electrosensory system or tactile cues. <b>Bonnetheads</b> normally detect prey using olfaction, rely on olfactory-based tracking until they are close to the prey, then vision to line up a strike, and finally electroreception to time the jaw movements for capture. They can detect, orient, and strike visually in the absence of olfactory cues. Blacktip sharks also detect prey using olfaction or vision. Olfaction is used in combination with vision or the lateral line system for tracking. Long-distance orientation and striking is visually mediated, but strike precision relies on lateral line cues and an increase in misses occurs when this system is blocked. In the absence of vision, short-range orientation and striking can occur using lateral line cues. Capture is mediated by electroreception or tactile cues. Collectively, these results were used to develop species-specific sensory hierarchies for shark feeding behavior in a captive environment, the first such hierarchies to cover a complete behavioral sequence in a vertebrate...|$|R
