They are a type of biofilm that is large enough to see with the naked eye and robust enough to survive moderate physical stresses. These colonies of bacteria form on surfaces at many types of interface, for example between water and the sediment or rock at the bottom, between air and rock or sediment, between soil and <b>bed-rock,</b> etc. Such interfaces form vertical chemical gradients, i.e. [...] vertical variations in chemical composition, which make different levels suitable for different types of bacteria and thus divide microbial mats into layers, which may be sharply defined or may merge more gradually into each [...] other. [...] A variety of microbes are able to transcend the limits of diffusion by using [...] "nanowires" [...] to shuttle electrons from their metabolic reactions up to two centimetres deep in the sediment – for example, electrons can be transferred from reactions involving hydrogen sulfide deeper within the sediment to oxygen in the water, which acts as an electron acceptor.|$|E

40|$|International audienceMajor-trace element {{concentrations}} and Pb isotopic compositions of 64 lava samples erupted between November 2002 and July 2006 at Piton de la Fournaise volcano {{are used}} to better document temporal–compositional trends {{since the start of}} the eruptive cycle (March 1998). After 6 years of continuous drift towards less radiogenic values, the temporal trend in Pb isotopes suddenly reversed in 2005 and rapidly reached the signature of the first lavas erupted in 1998. In agreement with previous inferences, the 1998 – 2004 variations may reflect increasing contamination of the lavas, probably through deepening of magma storage from within the edifice down to the oceanic basement. The 2005 isotopic shift is interpreted as refilling the plumbing system with lesscontaminated, presumably deeper magmas. The volume of lava erupted between 1998 and 2004 (0. 16 km 3) would thus provide a lower limit for magma reservoir size. Although periods of quietness dominate between 1998 and 2006 (80 % of time), Pb isotopic compositions plotted versus cumulated eruption duration reveal remarkably smooth variations, which are not compatible with assimilation in an evolving magma chamber. Instead, the temporal trends could result from progressive emptying of a vertically zoned magma conduit, the compositional variations with depth reflecting the heterogeneity of the <b>bed-rocks</b> with which magmas interacted. The 1998 – 2004 compositional evolution of Piton de la Fournaise lavas likely results from injection of a homogenous batch of plume melts within a dyke system followed by depth-dependent crustal contamination, the late-erupting lavas stored at the level of the oceanic crust being the most contaminated. However, preserving the imprint of depth-dependent contamination in temporal– compositional trends is possible only if the time of storage is long compared to the time it takes to magmas to migrate from their storage location to the surface. Extended magma storage may have occurred during the nearly 6 years long period of quietness that preceded the 1998 eruptive cycle...|$|R

40|$|Tradition {{dictates}} that marketing decision-makers remain accurately {{aligned with the}} dynamic and vacillating need structures of the target markets they serve. To comply with this caveat, a time-honoured and largely unchallenged philosophy of customer orientation has been applied. Theory further strongly contends that if such a business stance is vigilantly and diligently applied, any firm is bound to gain a competitive edge in the market place. A weakness in the above marketing mindset is the perception that when a spectrum of business elements are orchestrated and focussed on customers, target audience members will automatically be satisfied and return their patronage. This so-called marketing concept has undergone major reevaluations over the past decades, {{and it is now}} becoming ever more prevalent to witness varied permutations of new marketing architecture evolving in literature and practice. The unit of analysis selected for this research study is a niche restaurant that flouts many of the rudimentary traditional rules of marketing and iconoclastically succeeds despite all counter-logic. What such organisations have been practicing, albeit unknown to themselves, is a new way of business - a stance that has only recently been taken seriously by academics, writers and marketing professionals. These intuitive marketers are succeeding in niche businesses, despite going against the tide of the ingrained paradigm mindsets of conventional marketing stalwarts. Such niche business people have discovered is that there is more to satisfying consumer needs than simply honing in and understanding what the basic needs of designated audiences are. A growing band of new age marketers have been challenging orthodox marketing philosophy. Tofler, the visionary futurist, alluded to a host of unarticulated psychic consumer needs that would emerge as society drifted into a clinical and dispassionate ‘new’ millennium. In a world geared to instant gratification, fast-paced living and mechanistic social interactions, jaded consumers seek recognition as individuals (Tofler, 1970). They quest for inclusion rather than exclusion. They need a place to feel safe and find solace. Hence, {{it is now clear that}} simply attempting to satisfy the fundamental dimensions of consumers’ needs is no longer sufficient. Consumers rather seek the fulfilment of an holistic band of experience dimensions. Increasingly, phrases such as “winning consumer hearts and minds” are entering the vocabulary of marketers on a regular basis. The present vogue is to isolate and then include a range of intangible elements that are embodied in the process of satisfying customers needs. However, despite a growing awareness of the significance of mental-need satisfiers, in the specific domain of this investigation there is sparse evidence in literature of the mechanics of such novel thinking. The study unit is a second generation restaurant where many of the hollowed cornerstones of conventional marketing are inadvertently flouted. Different sets of rules of engagement seem to apply to their customers, who are also their most ardent advocates. A unique philosophy and business ethos also appears to prevail. In the study, the idiosyncratic characteristics which socially and competitively differentiate such a business were identified, explored and expiated. The constituents were then harmonised in an effort to establish what ‘it’ was that magnetically attracted patrons back despite the owner’s unintentional dismissive predisposition towards fundamental theory. As a result of this in-depth qualitative study, an holistic model encompassing all of the dimensions of a dining out experience at a niche restaurant have been proposed. Consequently the pillars upon which a sustained, enduring, loyal staunch customer base can be <b>bed-rocked</b> have been identified. Further, for the study unit, a typology of its diner corpse has been developed. The owners of the establishment under investigation have succeeded to provide an intimate family haven for their patrons. They, and their diners have collectively given strong, descriptive voice to the psychogenic need satisfying elements that have always existed, but to date have been unarticulated and unrecorded. This thesis brings the milieu of the iconoclast niche restaurant marketing practitioner to life...|$|R
40|$|The {{environmental}} radioactivity monitoring programs {{start in}} the late 1950 s of the 20 th century following the global fallout from testing of nuclear weapons in the atmosphere, becoming a cause of concern regarding health effects. Later, the necessity of world industrialization for new energy sources led to develop national plans on electricity production from nuclear technology, initializing in this context world wide exploration for fuel minerals: uranium exploration gained a particular attention in late 1940 's in USA, Canada and former USSR and in 1951 in Australia with respective national plans. Nowadays there are about 440 nuclear power plants for electricity generation with about 70 more NPP under construction giving rise to the nuclear emergency preparedness {{of a large number}} of states (like Radioactivity Environmental Monitoring (REM) data bank and EUropean Radiological Data Exchange Platform (EURDEP). Furthermore, a lot of applications in the field of geosciences are related to the environmental radioactivity measurements going from geological mapping, mineral exploration, geochemical database construction to heat -flow studies. Gamma-ray spectroscopy technique is widely used when dealing with environmental radioactivity monitoring programs. The purpose of this work is to investigate the potentialities that such a technique offers in monitoring radioactivity concentration through three different interventions in laboratory, in-situ and airborne measurements. An advanced handling of gamma-ray spectrometry method is realized by improving the performances of instruments and realizing and testing dedicated equipments able to deal with practical problems of radioactivity monitoring. For each of these gamma-ray spectrometry methods are faced also the problems of calibration, designing of monitoring plans and data analyzing and processing. In the first chapter I give a general description for the common radionuclides present in the environment having a particular interest for monitoring programs. Three categories of environmental radionuclides classified according to their origin as cosmogenic, primordial and man-made are discussed. The cosmic rays continuously produce radionulides and also direct radiation, principally high energetic muons. Cosmogenic radionuclides are originated from the interaction of cosmic rays with stable nuclides present in the Earth’s atmosphere. Primordial radionuclides are associated with the phenomenon of nucleosynthesis of the stars and are present in the Earth’s crust. Man-made radionuclides commonly present in natural environments are principally derived from radioactive fallout from atmospheric nuclear weapons testing and peaceful applications of nuclear technology like nuclear power plants for electricity generation and the associated nuclear fuel cycle facilities. A relevant contribution, generally with local implication comes from the so called non-nuclear industries which are responsible for technologically enhancement of natural radioelements producing huge amounts of naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORM/TENORM). In the second chapter is described a homemade approach to the solution of the problem rising in monitoring situations in which a high number of samples is to be measured through gamma-ray spectrometry with HPGe detectors. Indeed, in such cases the costs sustaining the manpower involved in such programs becomes relevant to the laboratory budget and sometimes becomes a limitation of their capacities. Manufacturers like ORTEC® and CANBERRA produce gamma-ray spectrometers supported by special automatic sample changers which can process some tens of samples without any human attendance. However, more improvements can be done to such systems in shielding design and detection efficiency. We developed a fully automated gamma-ray spectrometer system using two coupled HPGe detectors, which is a well known method used to increase the detection efficiency. An alternative approach on shielding design and sample changer automation was realized. The utilization of two coupled HPGe detectors permits to achieve good statistical accuracies in shorter time, which contributes in drastically reducing costs and man power involved. A detailed description of the characterization of absolute full-energy peak efficiency of such instrument is reported here. Finally, the gamma-ray spectrometry system, called MCA_Rad, was used to characterize the natural radioactivity concentration of <b>bed-rocks</b> in Tuscany Region, Italy. More than 800 samples are measured and reported here together with the potential radioactivity concentration map of bed rocks in Tuscany Region. In the third chapter is described the application of portable scintillation gamma -ray spectrometers for in-situ monitoring programs focusing on the problems of calibration and spectrum analysis method. In-situ γ-ray spectrometry with sodium iodide scintillators is a well developed and consolidated method for radioactive survey. Conventionally, a series of self-constructed calibration pads prevalently enriched with one of the radioelements is used to calibrate this portable instrument. This method was further developed by introducing the stripping (or window analysis) described in International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) guidelines as a standard methods for natural radioelement exploration and mapping. We realized a portable instrument using scintillation gamma-ray spectrometers with sodium iodide detector. An alternative calibration method using instead well-characterized natural sites, which show a prevalent concentration of one of the radioelements, is developed. This procedure supported by further development of the full spectrum analysis (FSA) method implemented in the non-negative least square (NNLS) constrain was applied for the first time in the calibration and in the spectrum analysis. This new approach permits to avoid artifacts and non physical results in the FSA analysis related with the χ 2 minimization process. It also reduces the statistical uncertainty, by minimizing time and costs, and allows to easily analyze more radioisotopes other than the natural ones. Indeed, as an example of the potentialities of such a method 137 Cs isotopes has been implemented in the analysis. Finally, this method has been tested by acquiring gamma Ombrone -ray spectra using a 10. 16 cm× 10. 16 cm sodium iodide detector in 80 different sites in the basin, in Tuscany. The results from the FSA method with NNLS constrain have been compared with the laboratory measurements by using HPGe detectors on soil samples collected. In the forth chapter is discussed the self-construction of an airborne gamma-ray spectrometer, AGRS_ 16. 0 L. Airborne gamma-ray spectrometry (AGRS) method is widely considered as an important tool for mapping environmental radioactivity both for geosciences studies and for purposes of radiological emergency response in potentially contaminated sites. Indeed, they have been used in several countries since the second half of the twentieth century, like USA and Canada, Australia, Russia, Checz Republic, and Switzerland. We applied the calibration method described in the previous chapter using well -characterized natural sites and implemented for the first time in radiometric data analysis FSA analysis method with NNLS constrain. This method permits to decrease the statistical uncertainty and consequently reduce the minimum acquisition time (which depend also on AGRS system and on the flight parameters), by increasing in this way the spatial resolution. Finally, the AGRS_ 16. 0 L was used for radioelement mapping survey over Elba Island. It is well known that the natural radioactivity is strictly connected to the geological structure of the bedrocks and this information has been taken into account for the analysis and maps construction. A multivariate analysis approach was considered in the geostatistical interpolation of radiometric data, by putting them in relation with the geology though the Collocated Cokriging (CCoK) interpolator. Finally, the potential radioelement maps of potassium, uranium and thorium are constructed for Elba Island...|$|R
