5|$|Throughout history, {{mothers have}} been portrayed {{as the primary}} {{physical}} caregivers of children. Physical caregiving includes tasks such as <b>breast-feeding</b> and changing diapers. Some theorize that {{this has to do}} with the idea of women as having a natural instinct towards motherhood. Fathers, on the other hand, have been more likely to be portrayed in play activities with their children and are often more likely to be shown interacting with sons than daughters.|$|E
5|$|Developmental effects {{occur at}} very low doses in animals. They include frank {{teratogenicity}} such as cleft palate and hydronephrosis. Development of some organs {{may be even more}} sensitive: very low doses perturb the development of sexual organs in rodents, and the development of teeth in rats. The latter is important in that tooth deformities were also seen after the Seveso accident and possibly after a long <b>breast-feeding</b> of babies in the 1970s and 1980s when the dioxin concentrations in Europe were about ten times higher than at present.|$|E
5|$|During Victoria's first {{pregnancy}} in 1840, in {{the first}} few months of the marriage, 18-year-old Edward Oxford attempted to assassinate her while she was riding in a carriage with Prince Albert on her way to visit her mother. Oxford fired twice, but either both bullets missed or, as he later claimed, the guns had no shot. He was tried for high treason, found not guilty on the grounds of insanity, and committed to an insane asylum indefinitely. In the immediate aftermath of the attack, Victoria's popularity soared, mitigating residual discontent over the Hastings affair and the bedchamber crisis. Her daughter, also named Victoria, was born on 21 November 1840. The Queen hated being pregnant, viewed <b>breast-feeding</b> with disgust, and thought newborn babies were ugly. Nevertheless, over the following seventeen years, she and Albert had a further eight children: Albert Edward, Prince of Wales (b. 1841), Alice (b. 1843), Alfred (b. 1844), Helena (b. 1846), Louise (b. 1848), Arthur (b. 1850), Leopold (b. 1853) and Beatrice (b. 1857).|$|E

5|$|During Linnaeus' time it {{was normal}} for upper class women to have wet nurses for their babies. Linnaeus joined an ongoing {{campaign}} to end this practice in Sweden and promote <b>breast-feeding</b> by mothers. In 1752 Linnaeus published a thesis along with Frederick Lindberg, a physician student, based on their experiences. In {{the tradition of the}} period, this dissertation was essentially an idea of the presiding reviewer (prases) expounded upon by the student. Linnaeus' dissertation was translated into French by J.E. Gilibert in 1770 as La Nourrice marâtre, ou Dissertation sur les suites funestes du nourrisage mercénaire. Linnaeus suggested that children might absorb the personality of their wet nurse through the milk. He admired the child care practices of the Lapps and pointed out how healthy their babies were compared to those of Europeans who employed wet nurses. He compared the behaviour of wild animals and pointed out how none of them denied their newborns their breastmilk. It is thought that his activism played a role in his choice of the term Mammalia for the class of organisms.|$|E

25|$|The {{woman with}} breast {{implants}} {{is able to}} breast-feed her infant; yet breast implant devices occasionally cause functional <b>breast-feeding</b> difficulties, especially the mammoplasty procedures that feature periareolar incisions and subglandular emplacement, which have greater incidences of <b>breast-feeding</b> difficulties. Therefore, to ensure her <b>breast-feeding</b> functionality post-surgery, the woman of child-bearing age seeking breast implants discusses with her plastic surgeon the implantation procedure that will least damage her lactiferous ducts and the nerves of the nipple-areola complex (NAC). Before the augmentation mammoplasty, the woman consults with a lactation consultant, to learn what post-operative lactation and <b>breast-feeding</b> conditions to expect; and consults with the plastic surgeon to jointly decide upon the implantation procedure and surgical techniques that will least damage the breast nerves, the milk ducts, the T4 dermatomic area and the lactiferous ducts, so that she might nurse her infant child.|$|E

25|$|Western society {{tends to}} {{perceive}} breasts in sexual terms instead of for their biological purpose.

25|$|Digestive {{contamination}} and systemic toxicity {{are the principal}} infant-health concerns; the leakage of breast implant filler to the breast milk, and if the filler is dangerous to the nursing infant. Breast implant device fillers are biologically inert—saline filler is salt water, and silicone filler is indigestible—because each substance is chemically inert, and environmentally common. Moreover, proponent physicians have said there “should be no absolute contraindication to <b>breast-feeding</b> by women with silicone breast implants.” In the early 1990s, {{at the beginning of}} the silicone breast implant sickness occurrences, small-scale, non-random studies (i.e. “patients came with complaints, which might have many sources”, not “doctors performed random tests”) indicated possible <b>breast-feeding</b> complications from silicone implants; yet no study reported device–disease causality.|$|E

40|$|Every {{parent and}} child would greatly benefit from an {{intervention}} that would ensure improved immunity, reduced illnesses of varying types, reduced cancer risk, and improved cognitive function. 1 So, when a health care provider explains that this particular intervention is not an artificial, laboratory-created, pharmacological agent but, rather, the natural benefits of breast milk, why do so few women {{make the decision to}} <b>breast-feed?</b> Primary influences that affect a woman’s deci-sions include her support structure, parity, prepared knowledge, practical work demands, and level of com-fort with public breastfeeding. 2 - 4 Further research must examine how to synthesize studies that show the mul-tifaceted influences on a woman’s decision to <b>breast-feed.</b> This integration will clarify why 2 women in apparently the same situation (similar culture, age, support structure, etc) make different decisions regard-ing the continuation of breastfeeding.

40|$|See {{the article}} by Lunney et al, on pages 762 – 769.) At first it seemed counterintuitive. Why would human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) -infected women who exclusively <b>breast-feed</b> their infants {{be less likely to}} transmit HIV postnatally than women who <b>breast-feed</b> but also provide their in-fants other liquids and/or solids? Aren’t the exclusively breast-fed infants ingesting more HIV-containing human milk? Yet, following the original observation from Durban in South Africa [1], at least 3 other large epidemiologic studies, 2 of them set up specifically to examine this hypothesis, also observed significantly lower rates of postnatal HIV transmission among exclu-sively breast-fed infants, compared with predominantly or partially breast-fed in-fants [2 – 4]. Possible explanations for the mechanisms underlying this association have been discussed [5], but there are few data examining the pathways. In this issue of the Journal, Lunney et al [6] take on the daunting task of testing one of the potential explanations for the HIV transmission–reducing effects of ex...|$|R

25|$|Functional <b>breast-feeding</b> {{difficulties}} {{arise if}} the surgeon cut the milk ducts or the major nerves innervating the breast, {{or if the}} milk glands were otherwise damaged. Milk duct and nerve damage are more common to the periareolar incision implantation procedure, which cuts tissue near the nipple, whereas other implantation incision-plansIMF (inframammary fold), TABA (Trans-Axillary Breast Augmentation), TUBA (trans-umbilical breast augmentation)avoid the tissue of the nipple-areola complex; if the woman is concerned about possible <b>breast-feeding</b> difficulties, the periareolar incisions can be effected to reduce damage to the milk ducts and to the nerves of the NAC. The milk glands are affected most by subglandular implants (under the gland), and by large-sized breast implants, which pinch the lactiferous ducts and impede milk flow. Small-sized breast implants, and submuscular implantation, cause fewer breast-function problems; however, women have successfully breast-fed after undergoing periareolar incisions and subglandular emplacement.|$|E
