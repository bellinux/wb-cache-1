25|$|Jonathan Swift's 1726 satire, , {{in which}} civil war erupts {{over whether the}} <b>big</b> <b>end</b> or the little end of a boiled egg is the proper end to crack open (analogous to {{counting}} from the end that contains the most significant bit or the least significant bit).|$|E
25|$|The Griffon was {{the first}} Rolls-Royce {{production}} aero engine to use a hollow crankshaft as the means of lubricating the main and <b>big</b> <b>end</b> bearings, providing a more even distribution of oil to each bearing. In another change from convention, one high efficiency B.T.H-manufactured dual magneto was mounted {{on top of the}} propeller reduction casing; earlier Rolls-Royce designs using twin magnetos mounted {{at the rear of the}} engine.|$|E
25|$|The Rolls-Royce {{design team}} {{realised}} that producing a scaled-up version of their Griffon V-12 engine {{would lead to}} excessively large combustion chambers and problems with detonation. The team concluded that {{a larger number of}} small cylinders would be the answer and considered an X-24 design. This layout had previously caused unreliability with the Rolls-Royce Vulture due to the need to fasten four connecting rods in a complicated arrangement to a common <b>big</b> <b>end</b> bearing.|$|E

25|$|The Air Ministry {{opened an}} {{investigation}} into the accident under the Air Navigation (Investigation of Accidents) Regulations, 1922. The investigation opened on 25 June at the Royal Courts of Justice, London, with Sir Arthur Colefax in charge. The cause of the engine failure was the fracture of No. 4 connecting rod in the starboard engine. The engine had run for 126 hours since its last overhaul, with the permitted time between overhauls being 300 hours. The connecting rod had failed due to the failure of the <b>big</b> <b>end</b> bearing studs.|$|E
25|$|In the 2007/2008 curling season Jones celebrated several successes {{including}} {{winning the}} 2007 Autumn Gold Grand Slam {{as well as}} the 2008 Manitoba Provincial Championship. Winning the 2008 Manitoba Provincial Championship qualified her to represent the province at the 2008 Scotties Tournament of Hearts in Regina, Saskatchewan. Jones got off to a slow start, having just a 3–4 record to start off the week, but then gotten four consecutive wins for a 7-4 record which earned a spot in the tiebreaker match where she defeated Newfoundland and Labrador's Heather Strong by a score of 6–3. In the first playoff game, Jones edged Québec skip Marie-France Larouche with a score of 6–5. She advanced to the semi-finals, where she defeated Ontario's Sherry Middaugh 9–8 by stealing a point in the extra end. In the final, Jones faced Alberta's Shannon Kleibrink. In the final stone, Klëibrink had the opportunity to score a <b>big</b> <b>end</b> for the win but only managed to knock out one Manitoba Stone giving Jones' team a 6-4 victory and was crowned Canadian Champions for the second time.|$|E
2500|$|The A4 {{class had}} {{previously}} {{had problems with}} the <b>big</b> <b>end</b> bearing for the middle cylinder, so the <b>big</b> <b>end</b> was fitted with a [...] "stink bomb" [...] of aniseed oil which would be released if the bearing overheated. Shortly after attaining the record speed, the middle <b>big</b> <b>end</b> did overheat and Mallard had to limp onwards to Peterborough. It then travelled to Doncaster for repair. This had been foreseen by the publicity department, who had many pictures taken for the press, in case Mallard {{did not make it}} back to Kings Cross. The (Edwardian period) Ivatt Atlantic that replaced Mallard at Peterborough was only just in sight when the head of publicity started handing out the pictures.|$|E

2500|$|According to The Sydney Morning Herald [...] "behind the Strathfield saga is {{a ferocious}} battle among {{developers}} for sites. These developers are {{not from the}} <b>big</b> <b>end</b> of town; they are locals – many are Lebanese – who regard the inner west as their development playground."

2500|$|Endianness {{refers to}} the {{sequential}} order in which bytes are arranged into larger numerical values, when stored in computer memory or secondary storage, or when transmitted over digital links. Endianness is of interest in computer science because two conflicting and incompatible formats are in common use: words may be represented in big-endian or little-endian format, depending on whether bits or bytes or other components are ordered from the <b>big</b> <b>end</b> (most significant bit) or the little end (least significant bit).|$|E

[...] "Floating" [...] front end bearing consisting of an internally toothed annulus bolted to crankshaft, meshing with and incorporating a semi-floating ring, internally splined {{to a short}} coupling shaft. Coupling shaft splined at front end to driving wheel of propeller reduction gear. Clockwise rotation when viewed from rear.|$|E

50|$|A {{supplementary}} {{air supply}} {{controlled by a}} foot pedal operated at will by the driver provides an oil mist from inside the engine's crankcase to lubricate {{the tops of the}} valve sleeves. A three-plunger pump driven by the valve shaft forces oil from the sump to troughs under and {{in the path of the}} <b>big</b> <b>ends.</b> With each revolution the <b>big</b> <b>ends</b> dipping into the troughs throw oil to all parts of the engine. The dashboard has a telltale to warn if the pump is not working properly.|$|R
50|$|After that, Dean Ambrose {{defended the}} WWE United States Championship against Big E Langston. In the <b>end,</b> <b>Big</b> E {{performed}} a Spear on Ambrose, {{who was standing}} on the apron. Big E re-entered the ring but Ambrose was intentionally counted out, meaning he retained the title. After the match, Big E performed the <b>Big</b> <b>Ending</b> on Ambrose.|$|R
2500|$|In {{common with}} the London & North Eastern Railway Gresley Pacifics from which its valve gear design was derived, the centre {{cylinder}} and centre connecting rod's <b>big</b> <b>end</b> bearing were located beneath the steam chest and boiler where they were exposed to great heat. This problem was exacerbated by [...] reduced ventilation following the fitting of streamlining and the faster running associated with their Spirit of Progress service from 1937 onwards. The grease-lubricated locomotive axles also suffered overheating problems from the sustained higher speed running. The VR addressed both issues by switching to a [...] "red oil" [...] lubricant which had a higher resistance to heat.|$|E
2500|$|On {{choosing}} {{a career in}} chess, Duchamp said, [...] "If Bobby Fischer came to me for advice, I certainly would not discourage him—as if anyone could—but I would {{try to make it}} positively clear that he will never have any money from chess, live a monk-like existence and know more rejection than any artist ever has, struggling to be known and accepted." [...] Duchamp left a legacy to chess {{in the form of an}} enigmatic endgame problem he composed in 1943. The problem was included in the announcement for Julian Levi's gallery exhibition Through the <b>Big</b> <b>End</b> of the Opera Glass, printed on translucent paper with the faint inscription: [...] "White to play and win". Grandmasters and endgame specialists have since grappled with the problem, with most concluding that there is no solution.|$|E
2500|$|The 2.5 diesel, 2.5 petrol and Diesel Turbo engines all {{shared the}} same block {{castings}} and other components such as valve-gear and cooling system parts, allowing them to be built on the same production line. The Diesel Turbo produced , a 13% increase over the naturally aspirated unit, and a 31.5% increase in torque to [...] at 1800rpm. Externally, turbo-diesel vehicles differed from other models only by having an air intake grille in the left-hand wing to supply cool air to the turbo. The engine was adopted as the standard engine for UK and European markets. Early turbo-diesel engines gained a reputation for poor reliability, with major failures to the bottom-end and cracked pistons. A revised block and improved <b>big</b> <b>end</b> bearings were introduced in 1988, and a re-designed breather system in 1989. These largely solved the engine's problems, but it remained (like many early turbo-diesels) prone to failure if maintenance was neglected.|$|E
6000|$|... “Jonas was mistaken,” said he. “It is a {{great deal}} better to put the <b>big</b> <b>ends</b> back. Then they are out of sight; all the old knots are hid, and the pile looks handsomer in front.” ...|$|R
50|$|The event {{opened with}} The New Day (Big E and Kofi Kingston) {{defending}} the WWE Tag Team Championship against The League of Nations (Sheamus and King Barrett). Big E executed a <b>Big</b> <b>Ending</b> on Barrett {{to retain the}} title.|$|R
6000|$|He {{accordingly}} {{just stepped}} {{a moment to}} the shed door, and looked at Rollo’s work. “That will do very well,” said he; “only you must put the <b>biggest</b> <b>ends</b> of the sticks outwards, or it will all tumble down.” ...|$|R

60|$|This {{suggestion}} {{met with}} Rinkitink's approval {{and the little}} party at once started upon the return journey.

25|$|Trial revenue {{services}} commenced in February 1946 on the Bergen Line from Oslo to Geilo. After a month {{there were}} {{issues with the}} pinions, causing them {{to have to be}} replaced. The unit continued on the Geilo service until September. By then the roller bearings in the prime mover's <b>big</b> <b>ends</b> were sufficiently weakened that they were causing engines to malfunction. Low standards caused by wartime manufacturing combined with dust and rust in the engines through four years of storage required a major clean-up of the prime movers before they could be returned to service. The prime movers were manufactured in 1939 and their <b>big</b> <b>ends</b> had to be replaced with sleve bearings to improve reliability.|$|R

60|$|To {{one side}} of the camp lay a fantastically carved stick, evidently cut by {{somebody}} during his leisure.

60|$|In this half-circle I pitched {{two rows}} of strong stakes, driving them into the ground till they stood very firm like piles, the <b>biggest</b> <b>end</b> being {{out of the ground}} about five feet and a half and {{sharpened}} on the top. The two rows did not stand above six inches from one another.|$|R
50|$|The {{engine was}} {{flexibly}} mounted to isolate torque reactions. It was {{fitted with a}} statically and dynamically balanced three bearing crankshaft; <b>big</b> <b>ends</b> fitted with steel-backed white-metal liners; three bearing camshaft with steel-backed white-metal liners; air silencer; and automatic advance and vacuum control of the distributor with over-riding hand adjustment for varying grades of fuel.|$|R
5000|$|Although he had {{experimented with}} compounding, Hughes {{chose to use}} four simple {{cylinders}} here. These gave better balance and also permitted just two of outside valve gear, with the inside valves being operated by rockers. This freed up more space between the frames, allowing for a stronger crank axle, connecting rods and <b>big</b> <b>ends.</b>|$|R
