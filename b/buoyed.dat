5|$|By 2000, Madonna {{was dating}} {{director}} Guy Ritchie, and {{was pregnant with}} their child. Wanting to distract herself from the media frenzy surrounding this news, Madonna concentrated {{on the development of}} her eighth studio album, Music. <b>Buoyed</b> up by the commercial success of 1998's Ray of Light album, she was keen on getting back to the studio to record new material. She was then introduced to French DJ and producer Mirwais Ahmadzaï. Madonna instantly liked his pitch-shifting, pulverizing rhythms and his utilization of acid bass in his songs.|$|E
50|$|A spar <b>buoy</b> is a tall, thin <b>buoy</b> that floats {{upright in}} the water and is {{characterized}} by a small water plane area and a large mass. Because they tend to be stable ocean platforms, spar <b>buoys</b> are popular for making oceanographic measurements. Adjustment of the water plane area and the mass allows spar <b>buoys</b> to be tuned so they tend to not respond to wave forcing. This characteristic differentiates them from large water plane area <b>buoys</b> such as discus <b>buoys</b> that tend to be wave followers. Spar <b>buoys</b> are often used as stable platforms for wave measurement devices and air-sea interaction measurements. Spar <b>buoys</b> range in length from a few feet to the 354-foot (108 meter) RV FLIP. To avoid the difficulties inherent with shipboard launch and recovery, helicopter deployment of large spar <b>buoys</b> has been studied.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. <b>Buoy</b> {{is widely}} applied in oceanographic research, ocean {{engineering}} and so on. The high cable tension and location derivation of its anchor can greatly affected the working condition of <b>buoy.</b> Multi-body software ADAMS {{is used to}} analyze the dynamics of deployment for <b>buoy.</b> Firstly, model of mooring <b>buoy</b> is developed. The forces on components of <b>buoy</b> are given such as drag forces, inertia force and impact force between bottom and anchor. The program is developed by macro commands in ADAMS environment. The trajectory and tension force of different nodes on <b>buoy</b> are calculated. This method can simulate the dynamics of deployment process for <b>buoy</b> system. And it is also helpful for guidance for <b>buoy</b> design and deployment process planning...|$|R
40|$|A {{wave energy}} {{converter}} (WEC) of point absorber type is tested at {{the west coast of}} Sweden. The <b>buoy</b> is a vertical cylin-der. The linear generator on the seabed has limited stroke length. Large waves cause the generator to reach its maximum stroke length. As this happen, a spring in the generator is compressed, causing the <b>buoy</b> to instantly come to rest. During this process the force between the <b>buoy</b> and the generator is measured. Also the acceleration of the <b>buoy</b> is measured. This process and the extreme forces on the generator hull is described and the study shows that the magnitude of this force is greatly influenced by the added mass of the <b>buoy</b> and thus the <b>buoy</b> geometry. The ratio between the extreme forces on the hull and the forces during nor-mal operation will affect the dimensioning and economy of the WEC. Force acting between generator and <b>buoy</b> were measured during various events as the WEC was operating. Heave added mass was derived from the measurements and found to be greater than the theoretical value.

5|$|The Democrats {{held their}} {{convention}} {{the next month}} in New York City. The convention soon deadlocked, and after 103 ballots, the delegates finally agreed on a compromise candidate, John W. Davis, with Charles W. Bryan nominated for vice president. The Democrats' hopes were <b>buoyed</b> when Robert M. La Follette Sr., a Republican senator from Wisconsin, split from the GOP {{to form a new}} Progressive Party. Many believed that the split in the Republican party, like the one in 1912, would allow a Democrat to win the presidency.|$|E
5|$|The pre-Code horror cycle was {{motivated}} by financial necessity. Universal in particular <b>buoyed</b> itself with the production of horror hits such as Dracula (1931) and Frankenstein, then followed those successes up with Murders in the Rue Morgue (1932), The Mummy (1932), and The Old Dark House (1932). Other major studios responded with their own productions. Much like the crime film cycle, however, the intense boom of the horror cycle was ephemeral, and had fallen off {{at the box office}} {{by the end of the}} pre-Code era.|$|E
50|$|<b>Buoys</b> {{serviced}} by the Papaw ranged from tiny 6 ft nun <b>buoys</b> to the 35 ft tall 18,000 lb Galveston Entrance Channel <b>Buoy.</b> Most <b>buoys</b> {{are equipped with}} electrical lights powered by batteries and solar cells.

50|$|As {{it may be}} {{difficult}} to manually release the <b>buoy,</b> or the compartment where the <b>buoy</b> controls are located may have been flooded, the <b>buoys</b> were arranged with automatic releases, in the event of a fire or internal flooding. Such automatic sensors proved unreliable and <b>buoys</b> were sometimes released unexpectedly. Accidental release of a <b>buoy</b> would have been a hazard during wartime operations, or even during exercises. There is some indication that unreliable <b>buoys</b> were welded into place. This may have been a factor in incidents such as the Kursk sinking, where the <b>buoy</b> was not released and it was difficult to locate the wreck.|$|R
5|$|AC/DC {{underwent}} several line-up changes before releasing {{their first}} album, High Voltage, in 1975. Membership subsequently stabilised until bassist Mark Evans {{was replaced by}} Cliff Williams in 1977 for the album Powerage. Within months of recording the album Highway to Hell, lead singer and co-songwriter Bon Scott died on 19 February 1980 {{after a night of}} heavy alcohol consumption. The group considered disbanding, but <b>buoyed</b> by support from Scott's parents, decided to continue and set about finding a new vocalist. Ex-Geordie singer Brian Johnson was auditioned and selected to replace Scott. Later that year, the band released the new album, Back in Black, which was made as a tribute to Bon Scott. The album launched them to new heights of success and became their all-time best-seller.|$|E
5|$|Criticism over artistic {{matters in}} The Pall Mall Gazette {{provoked}} {{a letter in}} self-defence, and soon Wilde was a contributor to that and other journals during 1885–87. He enjoyed reviewing and journalism; the form suited his style. He could organise and share his views on art, literature and life, yet in a format less tedious than lecturing. <b>Buoyed</b> up, his reviews were largely chatty and positive. Wilde, like his parents before him, also supported the cause of Irish Nationalism. When Charles Stewart Parnell was falsely accused of inciting murder Wilde wrote a series of astute columns defending him in the Daily Chronicle.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, choral {{associations}} became common in Maryland, and Baltimore, <b>buoyed</b> by the immigration of numerous Germans. These groups were formed {{for the purpose}} of instruction in choral music, eventually performing oratorios. The popularity of these choral associations helped to garner support among the local population for putting music education in the city's public schools. The Baltimore Oratorio Society, the Liederkranz and the Germania Männerchor were {{the most important of these}} associations, and their traditions were maintained into the 20th century by organizations like the Bach Choir, Choral Arts Society, Concert Artists of Baltimore, Handel Society and the Baltimore Symphony Chorus.|$|E
40|$|Throughout the world's oceans a {{wide variety}} of {{floating}} plastics are found, among which <b>buoys</b> stand out for their high floatability and diversity and abundance of associated organisms. Between 2001 and 2005, we conducted 25 ship surveys in the Bay System of Coquimbo (BSC), during which we registered 34 detached <b>buoys</b> floating between 1 and 45 km from the coast. The objective {{of this study was to}} infer the possible origin of these <b>buoys,</b> identify the associated biota and characterize their biological traits. Short-term drift experiments (30 min) showed that <b>buoys</b> without rope responded primarily to the velocity and direction of the wind, while <b>buoys</b> with ropes (3 m length) followed surface currents. Using the wind velocity and direction during the 12 h before capture of the detached <b>buoys,</b> we estimated the hypothetical trajectories of these <b>buoys</b> during that time period. Results indicated that most <b>buoys</b> originated from aquaculture facilities in the BSC. A total of 134 different species from 14 phyla was found on 18 anchored (91 species) and 22 detached (116 species) <b>buoys</b> sampled. Community composition was similar among <b>buoys</b> - 54 % of all species were common for anchored and detached <b>buoys</b> - but a higher number of rare species occurred on detached <b>buoys.</b> <b>Buoys</b> do not seem to lose but rather gain organisms after detachment. The most common functional groups on these <b>buoys</b> were mobile species, suspension-feeders and species with sexual reproduction, separate sexes, internal fertilization and direct or very short larval development. Fouling communities on detached <b>buoys</b> were mostly in advanced successional stages, comprising diverse species (including several non-indigenous species) adapted to the conditions at the sea surface. These results suggest that floating <b>buoys</b> may transport associated species over extensive distances, thereby also contributing to the spread of non-indigenous species. © Inter-Research 2009. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

While Pyrrhus {{and most of his}} counsellors interpreted the dream as indicating that they would seize Sparta by storm, his friend Lysimachus warned him that places struck by thunderbolts were usually avoided and that Pyrrhus was destined not to enter Sparta. Pyrrhus dismissed this interpretation and <b>buoyed</b> by what he deemed to be a portentous sign, he prepared his men for a further assault.|$|E

40|$|Wave {{measurement}} is {{of vital}} importance {{for assessing the}} wave power resources and for developing wave energy devices, especially for the wave energy production and the survivability of the wave energy device. Wave <b>buoys</b> {{are one of the}} most popular measuring technologies developed and used for long-term wave measurements. In order to figure out whether the wave characteristics can be recorded by using the wave <b>buoys</b> accurately, an experimental study was carried out on the performance of three wave <b>buoy</b> models, viz two WaveScan <b>buoys</b> and one ODAS <b>buoy,</b> in a wave tank using the European FP 7 MARINET facilities. This paper presents the test results in both time and frequency domains and the comparison between the wave <b>buoys</b> and wave gauge measurements. The analysis results reveal that for both regular and irregular waves, the WaveScan <b>buoys</b> have better performances than the ODAS <b>buoy</b> in terms of accuracy and the WaveScan <b>buoys</b> measurements have a very good correlation with those from the wave gauges...|$|R

5|$|The {{bill for}} the plane {{remained}} unpaid. In 1914 Vickers reminded Mawson, who had apparently forgotten the outstanding debt. Mawson wrote to Vickers director Sir Trevor Dawson in November 1916, requesting the company write off the bill as a donation. His company <b>buoyed</b> by armaments contracts, Dawson agreed. The next expedition to take a plane to the Antarctic was Shackleton's 1921–22 Quest Expedition, but the Avro Baby remained grounded owing to missing parts. Not until 16November 1928—when Hubert Wilkins and Carl Ben Eielson flew for 20minutes around Deception Island, {{just over a year}} before Admiral Richard Evelyn Byrd's first flight over the South Pole—was a plane airborne in the Antarctic.|$|E

40|$|Objectives] This paper proposes an {{optimized}} {{design for}} wave-power navigational lighting <b>buoys</b> of seadromes. [Methods] Based {{on the theory}} of three-dimensional potential flow, the buoyant motion response of a <b>buoy</b> is calculated. A type of array of wave-power navigational lighting <b>buoys</b> located in an offshore seadrome is proposed,and a procedure for the design optimization of its component <b>buoys</b> is presented. Matching the best Power Take-Off(PTO) damping, the diameter to draft ratio and array distance with the best energy capture width ratio are acquired, and the energy capture for the short-term forecast of the <b>buoy</b> array is accomplished. On this basis, combined with the actual sea conditions, energy capture for the long-term forecast of an individual <b>buoy</b> is accomplished. The influence of the <b>buoy</b> diameter, <b>buoy</b> draft and array distance on the energy capture width ratio is discussed.
