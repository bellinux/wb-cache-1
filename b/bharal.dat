25|$|Snow leopards are {{carnivores}} {{and actively}} hunt their prey. Like many cats, {{they are also}} opportunistic feeders, eating whatever meat they can find, including carrion and domestic livestock. They can kill animals two to four times their own weight, such as the <b>bharal,</b> Himalayan tahr, markhor, argali, horse, and camel, but will readily take much smaller prey, such as hares and birds. They are capable of killing most animals in their range with the probable exception of the adult male yak. Unusually among cats, snow leopards also eat {{a significant amount of}} vegetation, including grass and twigs. Snow leopards will also hunt in pairs successfully, especially mating pairs.|$|E
25|$|Autoeroticism also occurs widely among animals, {{both male}} and female. A variety of {{creative}} techniques are used, including genital stimulation using the hand or front paw (primates, Lions), foot (Vampire Bats, primates), flipper (Walruses), or tail (Savanna Baboons), sometimes accompanied by stimulation of the nipples (Rhesus Macaques, Bonobos); auto-fellating or licking, sucking and/or nuzzling by a male of his own penis (Common Chimpanzees, Savanna Bonobos, Vervet Monkeys, Squirrel Monkeys, Thinhorn Sheep, <b>Bharal,</b> Aovdad, Dwarf Cavies); stimulation of the penis by flipping or rubbing it against the belly or in its own sheath (White-tailed and Mule Deer, Zebras and Takhi); spontaneous ejaculations (Mountain Sheep, Warthogs, Spotted Hyenas); and stimulation of the genitals using inanimate objects (found in several primates and cetaceans).|$|E

5000|$|The {{first and}} {{foremost}} thing for Gomukh trek is that you must have permission from (D.F.O.) District forest officer, Uttarkashi. Only 150 permits are issued per day, permission can be taken via fax also. The trail to Gomukh begins from Gangotri, about 18 km from Gomukh. It was heavily damaged by rockslides by the 2013 North Indian Floods as was road access to Gangotri.9 km ahead of Gangotri is Chirbasa, the abode of Chir trees. After 3 km of Chirbasa comes the dangerous Gila Pahar, the place well known for its landslides even prior to the 2013 destruction {{of much of the}} trail here; near-sheer cliffs down to the river must now be traversed. Here the <b>Bharals,</b> a type of mountain antelope are sometimes seen. The <b>Bharals</b> are found above the altitude of 10,000 ft. Only 4 km from here is Bhujbasa, the only night halting place on the way with buildings. One can stay at the GMVN Bunglow, or at the Lalbaba's Ashram or at Ram Baba's ashram; both ashram charge Rs 300 for a day that includes lodging and food. After trekking 41/2km from Bhujbasa, one reaches Gomukh, the snout of the Gangotri Glacier.A little before Gomukh, the majestic view of Mt. Shivling welcomes the trekkers to the place.On the trail no horses are allowed, so one must take preparations to walk on foot.The trek to Tapovanan and Nandanvan starts from here.|$|R
25|$|The <b>bharal</b> or blue sheep is {{the most}} {{abundant}} mountain ungulate in the Ladakh region, {{although it is not}} found in some parts of Zangskar and Sham areas. The Asiatic ibex is a very elegant mountain goat that is distributed {{in the western part of}} Ladakh. It is the second most abundant mountain ungulate in the region with a population of about 6000 individuals. It is adapted to rugged areas where it easily climbs when threatened. The Ladakhi Urial is another unique mountain sheep that inhabits the mountains of Ladakh. The population is declining, however, and there are not more than 3000 individuals left in Ladakh. The urial is endemic to Ladakh, where it is distributed only along two major river valleys: the Indus and Shayok. The animal is often persecuted by farmers whose crops are allegedly damaged by it. Its population declined precipitously in the last century due to indiscriminate shooting by hunters along the Leh-Srinagar highway. The Tibetan argali or Nyan is the largest wild sheep in the world, standing 3.5 to 4 feet at the shoulder with the horn measuring 90–100cm. It is distributed on the Tibetan plateau and its marginal mountains encompassing a total area of 2.5 million km2. There is only a small population of about 400 animals in Ladakh. The animal prefers open and rolling terrain as it runs, unlike wild goats that climb into steep cliffs, to escape from predators. The endangered Tibetan antelope, known as chiru in Indian English, or Ladakhi tsos, has traditionally been hunted for its wool (shahtoosh) which is a natural fiber of the finest quality and thus valued for its light weight and warmth and as a status symbol. The wool of chiru must be pulled out by hand, a process done after the animal is killed. The fiber is smuggled into Kashmir and woven into exquisite shawls by Kashmiri workers. Ladakh is also home to the Tibetan gazelle, which inhabits the vast rangelands in eastern Ladakh bordering Tibet.|$|E
500|$|The model “Forest Circles” around Dehradun, {{used for}} training, {{demonstration}} and scientific measurements, had a lasting {{positive influence on}} the forests and ecology of the region. The Himalayan ecosystem provides habitat for many animals (including <b>bharal,</b> snow leopards, leopards and tigers), plants, and rare herbs.|$|E
500|$|Leopards {{are found}} in areas which are {{abundant}} in hills but may also venture into the lowland jungles. Smaller felines include the jungle cat, fishing cat, and leopard cat. Other mammals include four kinds of deer (barking, sambar, hog and chital), sloth and Himalayan black bears, Indian gray mongooses, otters, yellow-throated martens, <b>bharal,</b> Indian pangolins, and langur and rhesus monkeys. In the summer, elephants {{can be seen in}} herds of several hundred. Marsh crocodiles (Crocodylus palustris), gharials (Gavialis gangeticus) and other reptiles are also found in the region. Local crocodiles were saved from extinction by captive breeding programs and subsequently re-released into the Ramganga river. Several freshwater terrapins and turtles like the Indian sawback turtle (Kachuga tecta), brahminy river turtle (Hardella thurgii), and Ganges softshell turtle (Trionyx gangeticus) {{are found in}} the rivers. Butterflies [...] and birds of the region include red Helen (Papilio helenus), the great eggfly (Hypolimnos bolina), common tiger (Danaus genutia), pale wanderer (Pareronia avatar avatar), jungle babbler, tawny-bellied babbler, great slaty woodpecker, red-breasted parakeet, orange-breasted green pigeon and chestnut-winged cuckoo. In 2011, a rare migratory bird, the [...] bean goose, was also seen in the Jim Corbett National Park.|$|E
25|$|The diet of {{the snow}} leopard varies across its range and with the time of year, and depends on prey availability. In the Himalayas, it preys mostly on <b>bharals</b> (Himalayan blue sheep), but in other {{mountain}} ranges, such as the Karakoram, Tian Shan, Altai and Tost Mountains of Mongolia, its main prey consists of Siberian ibex and argali, a type of wild sheep, although the latter has become rarer in some parts {{of the snow}} leopard's range. Other large animals eaten when available can include various types of wild goats and sheep (such as markhors and urials), other goat-like ruminants such as Himalayan tahr and gorals, plus deer, red panda, wild boars, and langur monkeys. Smaller prey consists of marmots, woolly hares, pikas, various rodents, and birds such as the snow cock and chukar.|$|R
2500|$|Snow leopards {{prefer to}} ambush prey from above, using broken terrain to conceal their approach. They will {{actively}} pursue prey down steep mountainsides, using {{the momentum of}} their initial leap to chase animals for up to [...] They kill with a bite to the neck, and may drag the prey to a safe location before feeding. They consume all edible parts of the carcass, and can survive on a single <b>bharal</b> for two weeks before hunting again. Annual prey needs appears to be 20–30 adult blue sheep.|$|E
2500|$|The Khunjerab National Park was {{established}} {{primarily as a}} means to protect the Marco Polo sheep (as well as snow leopards and <b>bharal)</b> living in the area. The borders of the park were mapped by Schaller in 1974, after a short field survey. The park was formally established on April 29, 1979 by Prime Minister of Pakistan Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who said that [...] "it must become a world famous park". Despite being listed as a category 2 national park, banning human activities including agriculture and hunting, the park was poorly managed, meaning that illegal hunting of the Marco Polo sheep continued. Because of this, the International Union for Conservation of Nature commissioned Norwegian biologist Per Wegge to do a wildlife survey of the park in 1988. Wegge found that {{there was no evidence of}} competition between the domestic sheep being illegally grazed and the wild Marco Polo sheep, and that most of the illegal hunting was not being done by local Wakhi residents, but by Pakistani military and civil officials. He therefore proposed that the park be reclassified, allowing grazing and commercial hunting, with the profits going to local residents. However, the government overlooked Wegge's suggestions, instead drawing up a new management plan, which both the IUCN and the World Wildlife Fund supported {{as a means to}} preserve the park and protect the wildlife. Wegge was critical of the government scheme, claiming that it was based on financial considerations, with the Pakistani government hoping to attract tourists to the area. The IUCN agreed with this, and has since distanced itself from the national park. To help protect the animals from poaching, the WWF has created the Khunjerab Village Organization, which relies on people living in the area to report poaching or endangered animal sightings.|$|E
50|$|Many Buddhist monasteries {{protect the}} <b>bharal</b> found around them, but lately, issues of crop {{damage caused by}} <b>bharal</b> have started to arise {{in areas such as}} the Spiti Valley.|$|E
50|$|The <b>bharal</b> is {{categorised}} as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN). The population faces two threats: poaching {{for meat}} and competition with livestock. Poaching, however, is uncommon {{due to the}} unsuitable conditions of its habitat. Similarly, livestock do not generally frequent the mountainous regions where <b>bharal</b> occur; {{even if they do}} coexist no notable detrimental effect on the <b>bharal</b> has been observed.|$|E
50|$|The rutting of the <b>bharal</b> starts towards late November and {{continues}} until mid-January. During the rut, male <b>bharal</b> use multiple strategies for mating, namely tending, blocking, and coursing. The young are born in late June and July.|$|E
50|$|The dwarf blue sheep {{differs from}} the <b>bharal</b> {{primarily}} in size, with adult males weighing around 35 kg, {{half as much as}} the <b>bharal.</b> Less sexual dimorphism occurs in this species, and females of the two species are very similar. Its coat is a steely grey with a silvery sheen, with darker general colouration than the <b>bharal,</b> and the horns of the male are smaller, thinner and more upright, with no inward curl.|$|E
50|$|The <b>bharal</b> {{was also}} the focus of George Schaller's and Peter Matthiessen's {{expedition}} to Nepal in 1973. Their personal experiences are well documented by Matthiessen in his book, The Snow Leopard. The <b>bharal</b> is a major food of the snow leopard.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bharal</b> {{are active}} {{throughout}} the day, alternating between feeding and {{resting on the}} grassy mountain slopes. Due to their excellent camouflage {{and the absence of}} cover in their environment, <b>bharal</b> remain motionless when approached. Once they have been noticed, however, they scamper up to the precipitous cliffs, where they once again freeze, using camouflage to blend into the rock face. Population densities in Nepal were found to be 0.9-2.7 animals per square kilometer, increasing to a maximum of 10 animals per square kilometer in the winter, as herds congregate in valleys. <b>Bharal</b> are mainly grazers, but during times of scarcity of grass, they switch to herbs and shrubs. A high degree of diet overlap between livestock (especially donkeys) and <b>bharal,</b> together with density-dependent forage limitation, results in resource competition and a decline in <b>bharal</b> density. Where they overlap, they are the favored prey of snow leopards and leopards, with a few lambs falling prey to foxes or eagles.|$|E
50|$|Originally given subspecific {{status to}} the <b>bharal</b> (Pseudois nauyar), {{morphological}} research {{conducted in the}} 1970s led it {{to be considered a}} distinct species. However, recent molecular analysis has shown {{the difference between the two}} species is slight, and suggests it should be treated as a subspecies of the <b>bharal.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>bharal</b> or Himalayan blue sheep or naur (Pseudois nayaur) is a caprid {{found in}} the high Himalayas of India, Nepal, Bhutan, Tibet, and Pakistan.

50|$|The {{official}} mascot for {{the first}} South Asian Winter Games was the <b>Bharal,</b> the Himalayan Blue-Sheep or Big-Horn (Ovis Ammon) Wild Sheep is the native of Central Asia and the Himalayas. The <b>Bharal</b> {{was chosen as the}} ideal mascot for these games keeping in view its agility, strength, sure-footed nature and adaptability for survival in the snow-covered high altitude areas. The male has massive wrinkled horns up to 70 inches in length which forms a spiral, while the horns of the female are much smaller. It weighs around a quintal and stands about 42 inches at the shoulder. Nanda Devi National Park in Uttarakhand is the famous abode of this brownish grey Himalayan Big-Horn called <b>Bharal.</b>|$|E

50|$|The book {{recounts the}} journey of Matthiessen and Schaller in 1973 to Shey Gompa in the inner Dolpo region of Nepal. Schaller's {{original}} objective was to compare the mating habits of the Himalayan blue sheep (the <b>bharal)</b> {{with those of the}} common sheep of the USA, while for Matthiessen the trip was more of a spiritual exploration. Another aim was to spot the snow leopard, a predator on the <b>bharal</b> and a creature that was seldom seen (it had only been glimpsed twice by Westerners in the previous twenty five years). A third part of the plan was to visit the Crystal Monastery and its Buddhist lama.|$|E
50|$|Pseudois is a genus in the {{subfamily}} Caprinae comprising two species, the <b>bharal</b> (Pseudois nayaur) and {{the dwarf}} blue sheep (Pseudois schaeferi). Both {{species in the}} genus are variously known as blue sheep, the bharal's alternate name being the Himalayan blue sheep.|$|E

50|$|Over 1,600 {{people live}} {{inside the park}} boundaries, mostly pastoralists raising poultry, goats, and sheep. This results in {{considerable}} animal-human conflict within the region. Snow leopards prey on livestock, sometimes killing several animals from a single flock in one hunt. This {{has been attributed to}} the overgrazing of livestock. Crop damage caused by <b>bharal</b> has also been seen.|$|E
50|$|The dwarf blue sheep or dwarf <b>bharal</b> (Pseudois schaeferi) is an {{endangered}} species of caprid found in China Proper and Tibet.
