40|$|Abstract Background The {{process of}} drug {{discovery}} and development is time-consuming and costly, and {{the probability of}} success is low. Therefore, there is rising interest in repositioning existing drugs for new medical indications. When successful, this process {{reduces the risk of}} failure and costs associated with de novo drug development. However, in many cases, new indications of existing drugs have been found serendipitously. Thus there is a clear need for establishment of rational methods for drug repositioning. Results In this study, we have established a database we call “PharmDB” which integrates data associated with disease indications, drug development, and associated proteins, and known interactions extracted from various established databases. To explore linkages of known drugs to diseases of interest from within PharmDB, we designed the Shared Neighborhood Scoring (SNS) algorithm. And to facilitate exploration of tripartite (Drug-Protein-Disease) network, we developed a graphical data visualization software program called phExplorer, which allows us to browse PharmDB data in an interactive and dynamic manner. We validated this knowledge-based tool kit, by identifying a potential application of a hypertension drug, <b>benzthiazide</b> (TBZT), to induce lung cancer cell death. Conclusions By combining PharmDB, an integrated tripartite database, with Shared Neighborhood Scoring (SNS) algorithm, we developed a knowledge platform to rationally identify new indications for known FDA approved drugs, which can be customized to specific projects using manual curation. The data in PharmDB is open access and can be easily explored with phExplorer and accessed via BioMart web service ([URL], [URL]). </p...|$|E
40|$|The action {{responsible}} for the physiological effects of acetazolamide (2 -acetvlamino- 1, 3, 4 -thiadiazole- 5 -sulfonamide) appears to be solely that of inhibition of the enzyme carbonic anhy-drase (Maren et al., 1960). However, {{the nature of this}} inhibition has remained undetermined. As early as 1945, Davenport showed that a 4 -fold variation in bicarbonate concentration (lid not alter the fractional inhibition of carbonic anhy-(Irase by thiophene- 2 -sulfonamide. Although this suggests a noncompetitive mechanism, it has been posite(l that sulfonamide inhibitors act competitivel (Roblin and C’lapp, 1950) by combining reversibly with the active site of the enzyme, by virtue of the structural and electronic similarity of the sulfonamide group to carbonic acid. Diagrammatic representations of such reactions, originally suggested l) y Roblin, have appeared (Sprague, 1958; Pitts, 1958). Such a supposition was in fact used as a key postulate in the synthesis of the series of sulfonamides which culminated in that of acetazolamide (Roblin an(l (‘lapp, 1950; Miller et al., 1950). Recently, how-ever, I) avis (1959) has found the inhibition of the carbonic anhydrase-mediated hydration of carbon dioxide by sulfanilamide to be non-competitive. Another sulfonamide drug, <b>benzthiazide</b> (3 -benzylthiomethvl- 6 -chloro- 7 -sulfamyl- 1, 2, 4 -ben-zothiadiazine-l, i-dioxide) has the special prop-erty of greatly increasing in inhibitory potency with time as it slowly comes into equilibrium with the enzyme in the al) sence of substrate (P’an ci al., 1960). Studies {{on the nature of the}} inhibition pro-duced by acetazolamide and l) enzthiazide are reported here...|$|E
