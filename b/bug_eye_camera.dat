40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} cameras {{as belonging to}} one of two types: single aperture (conventional) cameras, and multiple aperture (compound <b>eye)</b> <b>cameras.</b> The <b>eyes</b> of insects are well known examples of the second type. Recently Fraunhofer Institute announced the manufacturing of a compound <b>eye</b> <b>camera,</b> which is very thin and has potential applications unthinkable for the traditional single lens camera. In the case of compound <b>eye</b> <b>cameras</b> we describe a fundamental dependence of image brightness on the distance to the object. This is a property not observable in single lens cameras. We derive the mathematical expression for the brightness in images {{as a function of the}} distance to the object. Further, we provide an analysis of the behavior of the two types of cameras in this respect. Our conclusion is that compound cameras are fundamentally the appropriate devices for capturing light field information because of their correct sampling of radiance. 1...|$|R
40|$|Artificial {{compound}} <b>eye</b> <b>cameras</b> are {{a prominent}} approach of next generation wafer level cameras for consumer electronics {{due to their}} lower z-height compared to conventional single aperture objectives. In order to address low cost and high volume markets, their fabrication {{is based on a}} wafer level UV-replication process. The image quality of compound <b>eye</b> <b>cameras</b> can be increased significantly by the use of refractive freeform arrays (RFFA) instead of conventional microlens arrays. Therefore, we present the fabrication of a RFFA wafer level molding tool by a step and repeat process for the first time.

40|$|Miniaturized imaging systems {{combining}} an ultra-compact {{form factor}} {{in combination with}} the ability of refocusing and depth imaging have gained much interest in the field of mobile imaging. Therefore, artificial compound <b>eye</b> <b>cameras</b> are an extremely promising approach for the realization of compact monolithic camera modules on wafer level. Up to now, their imaging performance was limited to low resolution in the range of VGA format according to fabrication constrains given by the established microoptical fabrication methods, namely the reflow of photoresist. In order to overcome these classical limitations, the use of refractive freeform arrays (RFFA) instead of conventional microlens arrays is inevitable. To enable high volume and cost efficient mass production of artificial compound <b>eye</b> <b>cameras</b> for mass markets like the consumer electronics industry, their fabrication on wafer level is essential, but has not been published up to now. We present a wafer level based process chain enabling the fabrication of these elements for the first time...|$|R
