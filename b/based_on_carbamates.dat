Both the stereochemistry and regioselectivity of the reactions {{turned out to}} be very promising. These new compounds consist of a new class of chiral auxiliary <b>based</b> <b>on</b> the <b>carbamate</b> structure and, therefore, no longer belong to the family of SAMP and RAMP.

40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{thesis is}} focused on the physico-chemical characterization of interaction mechanisms of chiral stationary phases <b>based</b> <b>on</b> derivatized cyclofructans. Correct interpretation of retention and enantiodiscrimination processes substantially facilitates the development and optimization of new enantioselective methods using cyclofructan-based chiral stationary phases. At first, the interaction mechanisms of three commercially available cyclofructan-based stationary phases were studied in normal-phase mode of liquid chromatography. Namely, systems using chiral stationary phases <b>based</b> <b>on</b> dimethylphenyl <b>carbamate</b> cyclofructan 7, R-naphtylethyl carbamate cyclofructan 6 and isopropyl carbamate cyclofructan 6 were studied. Linear free energy relationship model was used as a basic tool for characterization of interactions on the stationary phases. The mentioned model revealed that the main interactions contributing to retention in cyclofructan-based systems are hydrogen bond acidity and dipolarity/polarizibility, while dispersion interactions cause decrease of retention. The impact of oligosaccharide skeleton of the cyclofructan selector on the enantioselectivity was elucidated by the comparison with seemingly analogous cyclodextrin-based chiral stationary phases.

40|$|By {{connecting}} a quinine or quinidine moiety to the peptoid chain {{through the}} C 9 -position carbamate group, we synthesized two new chiral selectors. After immobilizing them onto 3 -mercaptopropyl-modified silica gel, two novel chiral stationary phases were prepared. With neutral, acid, and basic chiral compounds as analytes, we evaluated these two stationary phases and compared their chromatographic performance with chiral columns <b>based</b> <b>on</b> quinine tert-butyl <b>carbamate</b> {{and the previous}} peptoid. From the resolution of neutral and basic analytes under normal-phase mode, {{it was found that}} the new stationary phases exhibited much better enantioselectivity than the quinine tert-butyl carbamate column; the peptoid moiety played an important role in enantiorecognition, which controlled the elution orders of enantiomers; the assisting role of the cinchona alkaloid moieties was observed in some separations. Under acid polar organic phase mode, it was proved that cinchona alkaloid moieties introduced excellent enantiorecognitions for chiral acid compounds; in some separations, the peptoid moiety affected enantioseparations as well. Overall, chiral moieties with specific enantioselectivity were demonstrated to improve the performance of peptoid chiral stationary phase efficiently...|$|R

In this analysis, the absorbent solution is flowing in the inner side of the fiber bore and the pure gas in the shell and the module operated in a non-wetted mode. The derived coupled non-linear govern- ing partial differential equations were numerically solved by the orthogonal collocation technique. Three typical alkanolamines of industrial use, the diethanolamine (DEA), the 2 -amino- 2 -methyl- 1 -propanol(AMP), and the diisopropanolamine(DIPA) were used as absorbents in this work. One important feature {{of this study was}} building the mathematical model <b>based</b> <b>on</b> the two-step <b>carbamate</b> formation model instead of the one-step model used by previous investigators. The outlet absorbed dioxide concentration was simulated and studied with respect to the liquid velocity, initial amine concentration and external mass transfer coefficient. The analysis includes the effects of the diameter and length of the fibers on the liquid outlet gas concentration {{as a function of the}} liquid velocity in the fiber.

40|$|Cellulose, {{the most}} {{abundant}} renewable organic material on earth, exhibits outstanding properties and useful applications, but also presents a tremendous challenge with regard to economical and environmentally friendly chemical processing. The viscose process, more than 100 year old {{is still the most}} widely utilized technology to manufacture regenerated cellulose fibers and films. Viscose fibers are produced today worldwide on a 5 million ton scale with various fiber types ranging from high performance tire yarn to textile filaments and staple fibers with excellent properties close to those of cotton. At Fraunhofer IAP, the technical equipment for viscose preparation, wet spinning of fibers, hollow fibers, and tube-like films is available on a min-plant scale. Research focused on raw materials testing, process optimization with regard to economic and ecological aspects, structural analysis of cellulose during processing, and structure-property relations of fibers and films. Similar to the viscose process, cellulosic fibers can be produced via cellulose carbamate as an environmentally friendly route. In a close cooperation of Fraunhofer IAP with industrial partners, a specific process <b>based</b> <b>on</b> cellulose <b>carbamate</b> was developed <b>on</b> a pilot plant scale, giving fiber properties close to those of conventional viscose fibers. In recent decades the N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide (NMMO) -technology {{turned out to be a}} nonderivatizing commercial alternative to the still dominant viscose route. From the very beginning, Fraunhofer IAP has been engaged in investigating the structure formation of cellulose fibers precipitated from NMMO-water solution, revealing structural reasons for the fibrillation tendency of these fibers and means to overcome them. Starting from fiber formation via dry-jet wet spinning, for the first time the blown film formation and the meltblown nonwovens technology were developed for cellulosics on a pilot plant scale at Fraunhofer IAP. <b>Based</b> <b>on</b> the elastic behavior of the dope at elevated temperatures, cellulose can be processed like a melt in the air-gap, offering new possibilities of shaping cellulose like meltable mass polymers. Combining cellulose carbamate with NMMO-monohydrate as a solvent, higher polymer concentrations in the dope and outstanding mechanical properties of the resulting fibers were achieved...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} {{synthesis}} {{of a family of}} gelators in which alkyl chains are connected to the amino groups of L-lysine methyl ester using a range of different hydrogen bonding linking groups (carbamate, amide, urea, thiourea and diacylhydrazine) using simple synthetic methodology <b>based</b> <b>on</b> isocyanate or acid chloride chemistry. The ability of these compounds to gelate organic solvents such as toluene or cyclohexane can be directly related to the ability of the linking group to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds. In general terms, the ability to structure solvents can be considered as: thiourea <carbamate <amide <urea similar to diacylhydrazine. This process has been confirmed by thermal measurements, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and infrared and circular dichroism spectroscopies. By deprotecting the methyl ester group, we have demonstrated that a balance between hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups is essential-if the system has too much hydrophilicity (e. g., diacylhydrazine, urea) it will not form gels due to low solubility in the organic media. However, the less effective gelators <b>based</b> <b>on</b> amide and <b>carbamate</b> linkages are enhanced by converting the methyl ester to a carboxylic acid. Furthermore, subsequent mixing of the acid with a second component (diaminododecane) further enhances the ability to form networks, and, {{in the case of the}} amide, generates a two-component gel, which can immobilise a wide range of solvents of industrial interest including petrol and diesel (fuel oils), olive oil and sunflower oil (renewable food oils) and ethyl laurate, isopropyl myristate and isopropyl palmitate (oils used in pharmaceutical formulation). The gels are all thermoreversible, and may therefore be useful in controlled release/formulation applications. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Nitric oxide (NO), an {{important}} signalling molecule {{in the human}} body, is synthesised by three isoforms of NO-synthase (NOS) from the amino acid L-arginine. Overproduction of NO by neuronal NOS {{has been associated with}} neurodegenerative disorders. Therefore, developing small molecules for selective inhibition of nNOS over related isoforms (iNOS and eNOS) is therapeutically desirable and of great interest for decoding neurodestructive key factors [1]. Suitable 18 F-labelled NOS-Inhibitors should allow the investigation of NOS-function by molecular imaging. Potentially, the highly selective nNOS Inhibitor 6 -((3 -((3 -fluorophenylethylamino) methyl) phenoxy) methyl) - 4 -methyl-pyridine- 2 -amine [2] is a suitable target for labelling with n. c. a. [18 F]fluoride in addition to the established iNOS inhibitor 6 -(2 -[18 F]fluoropropyl) - 4 -methylpyridine- 2 -amine [3]. Methods: <b>Based</b> <b>on</b> tert-butyl-(3 -iodophenylethyl) <b>carbamate</b> the corresponding iodoniumylide precursor was formed [4]. The activated aromatic system was labelled with n. c. a. [18 F]fluoride and converted via reductive amination followed by microwave assisted displacement of the protecting groups to the desired nNOS inhibitor. For the development of a simplified late-stage labelling procedure the corresponding brominated, Boc- and pyrrole-protected compound was synthesised, which was converted via borylation into the boronic ester precursor. This compound was labelled authentically by copper(II) mediated n. c. a. 18 F-fluorination [5]. Further developments enabled the one-pot synthesis by adapting the [18 F]fluoride activation to the radiolabelling step leading to ready-to-automate conditions. Furthermore, an automated one-pot procedure for the synthesis of the iNOS-Inhibitor was examined after stability tests and kinetic studies. Results: The n. c. a. 18 F-fluorination of the iodoniumylide precursor proceeded efficiently and regioselective in 79 % radiochemical yield (RCY). The following built-up synthesis led to the desired nNOS inhibitor in 15 % RCY. First attempts of the late-stage copper(II) mediated n. c. a. 18 F-fluorination led to similar conversions. The labelling procedure was reduced to a simplified one-pot synthesis. Conclusion: Finally, there are now potential and isoform selective radiotracers for both inducible and neuronal NO-synthases with high molar activities for further evaluations and preclinical studies.

40|$|Plant {{parasitic}} nematodes (PPNs) seriously threaten global food security. Conventionally {{an integrated}} approach to PPN management has relied heavily <b>on</b> <b>carbamate,</b> organophosphate and fumigant nematicides {{which are now}} being withdrawn over environmental health and safety concerns. This progressive withdrawal has left a significant shortcoming {{in our ability to}} manage these economically important parasites, and highlights the need for novel and robust control methods. Nematodes can assimilate exogenous peptides through retrograde transport along the chemosensory amphid neurons. Peptides can accumulate within cells of the central nerve ring and can elicit physiological effects when released to interact with receptors on adjoining cells. We have profiled bioactive neuropeptides from the neuropeptide-like protein (NLP) family of PPNs as novel nematicides, and have identified numerous discrete NLPs that negatively impact chemosensation, host invasion and stylet thrusting of the root knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita and the potato cyst nematode Globodera pallida. Transgenic secretion of these peptides from the rhizobacterium, Bacillus subtilis, and the terrestrial microalgae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii reduce tomato infection levels by up to 90 % when compared with controls. These data pave the way for the exploitation of nematode neuropeptides as a novel class of plant protective nematicide, using novel non-food transgenic delivery systems which could be deployed on farmer-preferred cultivars...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is the study of physico-chemical {{properties}} of the chosen compounds, derivatives of 2 -hydroxy- 3 -[2 -(4 -methoxyphenyl) ethylamino]propyl- 4 -[(alkoxycarbonyl) amino]benzoates and 2 -hydroxy- 3 -[2 -(2 -methoxyphenyl) ethylamino]propyl- 4 -[(alkoxycarbonyl) amino]benzoates with potential ultra-short beta-adrenolytic activity. The studied compounds are different in the position of the substituent on the benzene ring in the side chain {{as well as in the}} aromatic ring in position 4 with alkyl- (methylto butyl-) carbamate. The physico-chemical characteristics, for example, lipophilicity, surface activity, adsorbability, acidobasic properties etc., are very important for the explanation of the relationship between structure and biological activity of the drug. These parameters serve as the base of quantitative structure-activity study. The goal of this work is to establish the spectral characteristics of studied compounds in UV-area, pKa values, the parameters of lipophilicity (the values of Rf and RM from thin layer chromatography, retention time tÂ´R and capacity factor kÂ´ from liquid chromatography and experimental partition coefficients log PÂ´ values), surface tension, critical micelle concentrations, the adsorbability of compounds expressed by percent of adsorbed compound on active charcoal Î²% as well as by Freundlich adsorption isotherms.

These were synthesised and characterised, with their crystal structures determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction. Five series of CxxR (R = CH 3, OCH 3, F, Cl, Br) carbamate isomer grids have been synthesised and characterised, with some pertinent structures determined by X-ray diffraction. Ab initio modelling, conformational analysis and comparisons of experimental solid state with optimised molecular geometries have facilitated {{an examination of}} the relationships between conformations and inter/intramolecular interactions, rationalisation of differences between the solid state and calculated structures, as well as the presence of molecular disorder and polymorphism. New classes of macrocycles have been developed including tetramers and trimers, <b>based</b> <b>on</b> our earlier research <b>on</b> benzamides and <b>carbamates.</b> These systems include various para-substituted derivatives (F, Cl, Br, CH 3 CO 2 CH 3) and have been fully characterized by 1 H, 13 C, 19 F NMR and IR spectroscopy, while their crystal and molecular structures have been determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction. The development of tennimides and trezimides as new macrocycles <b>based</b> <b>on</b> an imide backbone, presents an important entry point into a potentially fruitful area. Furthermore, discovery of trezimides is especially important since no analogous macrocycle has been reported. Synthesis of tennimides and trezimides has been accomplished using a one-step synthetic strategy over a range of derivatives and presents a basis for synthesis of analogous macrocycles. Tennimides and trezimides proved to be rigid and stable compounds. The determining factors in the cyclisation are (i) the presence of the imide ortho-pyridine/pyrimidine rings and (ii) the inherent ability of the imide group to twist by 80 - 120 Â°, as measured by the 2 Ì† 7 COÂ·Â·Â·CO 2 Ì† 7 torsion angle, providing a 2 Ì† 7 hinge 2 Ì† 7 for ring closure or helical assembly. The trezimides can adopt two distinct conformations in the solid state, (though one is preferred), whereas the tennimides adopt discrete conformational states as oc, cc and oo that highlight subtle macrocyclic geometric changes on cavity opening (o) and closing (c) (though these interconvert in solution) ...|$|R
