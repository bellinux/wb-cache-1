25|$|Cole also censures the George W. <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> <b>for</b> not {{pushing for}} democratization in Pakistan. Such a {{development}} would not threaten U.S. interests, he writes, since whenever elections have been held, Taliban-like movements {{have not received}} much support from voters. On the contrary, {{the danger is that}} U.S. support for Musharraf may alienate middle-class Pakistanis. Cole is also on the Editorial Board of Pakistaniaat.|$|E

50|$|The PART was {{introduced}} in the 2004 Fiscal Year Federal budget, and explained by the <b>Bush</b> <b>Administration</b> as a program that built upon previous efforts of American Presidents to make sure federal programs were accountable and achieved results.

25|$|After the {{terrorist}} attacks of September 11, 2001, U.S. government officials questioned the lack of large-scale American democracy promotion mechanisms in the MENA region, viewing democracy as a means of promoting moderation and stability and preventing terrorism. This resulted in a ramping-up of diplomatic rhetoric on the necessity of democratization and political reform in the Middle East and an increase in funding for democracy promotion in the region. Spreading democracy was also one rationalization used by neo-conservatives and the <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> <b>for</b> undertaking the War in Iraq.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, Krugman {{published}} The Conscience of a Liberal, whose title {{refers to}} Barry Goldwater's Conscience of a Conservative. It details {{the history of}} wealth and income gaps in the United States in the 20th century. The book describes how the {{gap between rich and}} poor declined greatly in middle of the century, and then widened in the last two decades to levels higher even than in the 1920s. In Conscience, Krugman argues that government policies played a much greater role than commonly thought both in reducing inequality in the 1930s through 1970s and in increasing it in the 1980s through the present, and criticizes the <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> <b>for</b> implementing policies that Krugman believes widened the gap between the rich and poor.|$|E

It was published by CRC Press in 2014. The book discusses terrorist evolution of the Iraqi insurgency {{which led to the}} formation of Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS). Nance cites the 2003 Iraq war by the <b>Bush</b> <b>Administration</b> <b>for</b> causing regional instability. He criticizes Coalition Provisional Authority leader Paul Bremer. The book emphasizes lessons the U.S. neglected to learn from the Vietnam War, the Iraqi revolt against the British, and the South Lebanon conflict. Nance writes in favor of the Iran nuclear deal framework by the Obama Administration, saying it is in the interests of all parties involved.|$|E

50|$|Turley has {{nevertheless}} exhibited his {{disagreement with}} rigid ideological stances in contradiction to the established law with other stated and published opinions.

Spain's AG said any such prosecution would turn his nation's National Court [...] "into a plaything" [...] for politics.|$|R
500|$|... "Filegate" [...] {{began on}} June 5, 1996, when Republican Pennsylvania Congressman William F. Clinger, Jr., {{chair of the}} House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight, {{announced}} that the committee had found, during their ongoing [...] "Travelgate" [...] investigations, that FBI background reports on Travelgate figure Billy Dale had been delivered to the White House. The following day, the White House delivered to the committee hundreds of other such files related to White House employees of the Reagan Administration and George H. W. <b>Bush</b> <b>Administration,</b> <b>for</b> which Craig Livingstone, director of the White House's Office of Personnel Security, had improperly requested and received background reports from the FBI in 1993 and 1994, without asking permission of the subject individuals.|$|E
500|$|Hentoff was {{critical}} of the Clinton administration for the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. He also criticized the <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> <b>for</b> policies such as the Patriot Act and other civil liberties restrictions {{on the basis of}} homeland security. An ardent critic of the Bush administration's expansion of presidential power, in 2008 Hentoff called for the new president to deal with the [...] "noxious residue of the Bush-Cheney war against terrorism". According to Hentoff, among the national security casualties have been [...] "survivors, if they can be found, of CIA secret prisons ('black sites'); victims of CIA kidnapping renditions; and American citizens locked up indefinitely as 'unlawful enemy combatants". He advocated prosecuting members of the Bush administration, including lawyer John Yoo, for war crimes.|$|E
500|$|She made {{statements}} {{critical of}} the <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> <b>for</b> not deploying enough troops during the Iraq War. [...] Her close examination of the financial books of the McCain campaign during {{the first part of}} 2007 convinced the candidate that its profligate spending could not go on and led to the drastic mid-year reduction of the campaign's staff and scope. In February 2008, McCain made news by being critical of Michelle Obama, the wife of Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama, who had said, [...] "And let me tell you something: For {{the first time in my}} adult lifetime I am really proud of my country." [...] McCain, who was genuinely offended by the remark, replied: [...] "I am proud of my country. I don't know about you—if you heard those words earlier—I am very proud of my country." [...] Also in February 2008, she publicly appeared beside her husband during a press conference in response to a newspaper report regarding his connection to a lobbyist.|$|E

50|$|On August 3, 2007, Landrieu broke {{ranks with}} Democrats {{when she and}} Louisiana Rep.

5000|$|The <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> has <b>for</b> {{the most}} part {{followed}} the [...] "pragmatic" [...] approach that has been dominant in US foreign relations since the Shanghai Communiqué, which allows for [...] "engagement" [...] with China. More than the Clinton administration, it {{has been willing to}} see China as a strategic competitor, and it has been [...] "far more eager...to treat China with suspicion and adopt more hard-nosed policies." ...|$|R
500|$|As 2006 began, Bayh had $9.5 {{million on}} hand, $3.1 million {{of which he}} raised the {{previous}} year. A large portion {{of his time in}} the first month was spent positioning himself. He took a hard-line against the government of Iran, referring to leader Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as having a [...] "radical, almost delusional nature," [...] and then criticized the <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> <b>for</b> [...] "ignoring" [...] the situation, stating that [...] "diplomacy, economic sanctions, [...] other means" [...] needed to be used. For balance, just as he had in the previous year, Bayh voted against the appointment of a George W. Bush Supreme Court nominee when he cast his [...] "no" [...] vote for Samuel Alito. However, his fellow potential Democratic presidential peers, voted in a similar fashion. Late in January, Bayh gained the position as speaker at the Jefferson-Jackson dinner in North Carolina for the upcoming April. The gain came as a loss for North Carolinian John Edwards, who also was considered a potential candidate for the Democratic nomination. A Bayh spokesman, commented that the Senator was chosen because he [...] "has a lot of ideas about how to fix Washington and make America better". Prior to the event, in the beginning of February, Bayh made an appearance at the Congressional Black Caucus political action committee, spoke to the United Auto Workers conference, and made a trip back to Iowa for a plethora of events during the February 11–13 weekend. By {{the end of the month}} and into March, Bayh criticized the Bush administration from the right, attempting to appeal to all segments of the political spectrum by speaking out against the plan to sell American ports to United Arab Emirates companies.|$|E

2500|$|Defense lawyer Guy Womack {{contended that}} Graner {{and the six}} other Abu Ghraib guards charged with abuses were being scapegoated.

2500|$|Hunter was outspoken in his {{opposition}} to illegal immigration, favoring strict measures to combat it. He was a leading voice pushing for faster and more extensive construction of a U.S.–Mexico border fence, naming the border [...] "our biggest homeland security problem" [...] and listing a fence as a top priority. Hunter criticized the U.S. Department of Homeland Security under the George W. <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> <b>for</b> planning to build just half of the 700 miles of U.S.–Mexico border barrier authorized by the Secure Fence Act of 2006.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with the Electronic Intifada in September 2002, Dabashi referred to the pro-Israel lobby as [...] "Gestapo apparatchiks" [...] and that [...] "The so-called [...] "pro-Israeli lobby" [...] is an integral component of the imperial designs of the <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> <b>for</b> savage and predatory globalization."

25|$|In 2002, {{captured}} Al Qaeda leader Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi was rendered to Egypt {{where he}} was allegedly tortured.

Al-Libi later recanted his story and it is generally believed that his stories of contact between the Saddam Hussein regime and Al-Qaeda were fabricated to please his interrogators.|$|R
