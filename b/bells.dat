5|$|A Cullompton {{man called}} Chubb {{travelled}} widely to repair <b>bells</b> {{during the reign}} of James I. In 1745 a vestry meeting determined that {{in order to reduce the}} cost of having the church <b>bells</b> repaired, the <b>bells</b> should be cast in some part of the almshouses, and a bell founder be found to work there.|$|E
5|$|During World War II {{the demand}} for metal for the war effort {{resulted}} in many <b>bells</b> being melted down for scrap. As a result, those that survived are generally regarded as important historic artifacts. More than 70,000 <b>bells</b> (approximately 90 per cent of the bonshō then in existence) were destroyed in this way. However, rapid production of <b>bells</b> during the post-war period meant that by 1995 the number of temple <b>bells</b> in Japan had returned to pre-war levels.|$|E
5|$|There is a ring {{of eight}} <b>bells</b> hung in an iron frame in the tower; they are rung from {{the ground floor of}} the tower. Five of the <b>bells</b> were cast in 1741 by Abel Rudhall of Gloucester. They were rehung in 1908. The sixth bell was recast in 1865 by Mears and Co. of London. In 1919, the church <b>bells</b> were still customarily rung to signal the town curfew between September and March. Two more <b>bells</b> were added in 1937, cast by Mears and Stainbank.|$|E

5|$|Bell: Clapper-bells made {{of pottery}} {{have been found}} in several archaeological sites. The {{earliest}} metal <b>bells,</b> with one found in the Taosi site, and four in the Erlitou site, dated to about 2000 BC, may have been derived from the earlier pottery prototype. Early <b>bells</b> not only have an important role in generating metal sound, but arguably played a prominent cultural role. With the emergence of other kinds of <b>bells</b> during the Shang Dynasty (c. 1600– c. 1050 BC), they were relegated to subservient functions; at Shang and Zhou sites, they are also found as part of the horse-and-chariot gear and as collar-bells of dogs.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Bell's</b> lawyer telegraphed <b>Bell,</b> who {{was still}} in Boston, to come to Washington, DC.

The examiner accepted this argument, although mercury would not have worked in a telephone transmitter. On February 29, <b>Bell's</b> lawyer submitted an amendment to <b>Bell's</b> claims that distinguished them from Gray's caveat and Gray's earlier application.

5|$|The Octagon is also {{believed}} {{by some to}} be haunted by the spirits of African American slaves who once lived there. When the house held <b>bells</b> to summon servants, the spirits of the dead slaves would announce their presence by ringing these <b>bells</b> loudly. The ghostly bell ringing first occurred in the 1870s. General George D. Ramsay, Chief of Ordnance for the United States Army and commander of the Washington Arsenal in Washington, D.C., was attending a dinner at The Octagon when all the <b>bells</b> in the house began ringing. As Marian Gouverneur, wife of Samuel Laurence Gouverneur, Jr. (the first American consul in Foo Chow, China), related the story, General Ramsay seized the bell ropes to stop the <b>bells</b> from sounding, but to everyone's shock they did not stop ringing. Although Gouverneur's report was not made until 1911, the mysterious ringing of the <b>bells</b> had been reported in 1874 and again in 1889, each time attributed to the spirits of dead slaves.|$|E

5|$|The <b>bells</b> {{that draw}} the knights to the Grail {{ceremony}} at Monsalvat in acts 1 and 3 have often proved problematic to stage. For the earlier performances of Parsifal in Bayreuth, Wagner had the Parsifal bell, a piano frame with four strings, constructed {{as a substitute}} for church <b>bells.</b> For the first performances, the <b>bells</b> were combined with tam-tam and gongs. However, the bell was used with the tuba, four tam-tams tuned to the pitch of the four chime notes and another tam-tam on which a roll is executed by using a drumstick. In modern-day performances, the Parsifal bell has been replaced with tubular <b>bells</b> or synthesizers to produce the desired notes. The thunder machine is used in the moment of the destruction of Klingsor's castle.|$|E

5|$|The {{introduction}} of Buddhism to Japan in the mid-6th century {{led to the}} development of large hanging bronze <b>bells</b> without a clapper rung with a mallet or hanging beam.

Two additional <b>bells,</b> the gift of Brigadier Ommanney, were added in 1928 to complete the octave, which still contains two of the Bilbie <b>bells.</b> The present clock, installed in 1903, plays a verse of a hymn every four hours, at 8am, noon, 4 and 8pm, with a different hymn tune for {{every day of the}} week.
