5|$|Primary {{ingredients}} in an old-fashioned doughnut include flour, sugar, eggs, sour cream or <b>buttermilk,</b> and leavening agents such as baking powder or baking soda. Additional ingredients may include milk, butter, vanilla extract and salt. The use of <b>buttermilk</b> or sour cream may impart a rich flavor to the doughnut. It is typically deep-fried, {{and may be}} deep fried at a lower temperature compared to other doughnut styles, having a crunchier texture compared to other cake doughnut styles. Frying at a lower temperature contributes to its rough, cracked texture. Being turned several times while cooking in the oil also contributes to its texture.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{ingredients}} used {{can include}} yogurt, <b>buttermilk,</b> raisins, dates, walnuts, hazelnuts, allspice, cinnamon and nutmeg among others. Lemon juice {{may be used}} on the avocado to prevent browning from occurring. Avocado cake can be prepared as a vegetarian and vegan dish. Chocolate cake and pancakes can be prepared with avocado as an ingredient in the batter.|$|E
5|$|Dairy {{products}} such as milk, butter, ghee, yoghurt, <b>buttermilk</b> and cheese are manufactured largely from domestic cattle, though the milk of sheep, goat, yak, and buffalo is also used {{in some parts of}} the world and for gourmet products. For example, buffalo milk is used to make mozzarella in Italy and gulab jamun dessert in India, while sheep milk is used to make blue Roquefort cheese in France.|$|E

40|$|Improving the {{nutritional}} and health properties of food products, e. g. infant milk formula, {{by the addition}} offunctional ingredients is of primary importance. This study focused on bioactive milk polar lipids (PLs) recoveredfrom dietary sources that are of increasing interest. The chemical compositions of <b>buttermilks</b> and butterserums were determined and the modulation of the fatty acid composition of milk PLs was investigated. Butterserums contain a higher amount of milk PLs than <b>buttermilks</b> (88 vs. 13 – 18 g/kg dry matter), with a higherproportion of sphingomyelin (34 vs. 19 % of PLs, respectively) interestingly close to human milk PL profile. Butter serums are also interesting sources of choline, an important nutrient for infant brain development. Wedemonstrated that the unsaturated fatty acid content of milk PLs recovered in the <b>buttermilks</b> and the butterserums, mainly the amount of C 18 : 3 n- 3 and C 22 : 6 n- 3 (DHA) that are of nutritional interest, can be increased bydietary strategies. This work opens perspectives for a better valorization of milk PLs in human nutrition (bothinfants and adults) to benefit their functional, nutritional and health properties...|$|R
5|$|In the {{new century}} CDOT began the {{projects}} that would complete the four-lane expansion. It took one year to finish the expansion from Aspen Airport Business Center to <b>Buttermilk.</b> Three years later, in 2004, the section in Snowmass Canyon was expanded to four lanes {{at a cost of}} $100 million.|$|E
5|$|The {{content of}} MFGM in dairy {{products}} {{varies depending on}} the processing involved. During dairy processing such as churning or decreaming, the MFGM is disrupted and preferentially distributed into aqueous phases such as <b>buttermilk,</b> butter serum, or certain type of whey. Thus {{they can be a}} good source of MFGM for addition into food products.|$|E
5|$|By 1960 the {{population}} of Pitkin County had increased by 44%, the second-fastest growth rate on the Western Slope. The Aspen Skiing Company built two additional resorts, <b>Buttermilk</b> and Snowmass, to the west, contributing to traffic on the highway. In 1962 the Colorado Department of Highways, began a 12-year project to expand Highway 82 to four lanes between Glenwood Springs and Carbondale. The Maroon Creek Bridge was widened in 1963 to handle its increased traffic.|$|E
5000|$|The Mandala - The <b>Buttermilks</b> (Bishop, USA) - First Ascent, February 2000. Several holds {{have broken}} since Chris climbed the Mandala, {{including}} the crux holds. These changes {{have made the}} problem considerably easier, {{and it has been}} widely speculated that when the problem was first climbed, the grade was closer to V14.|$|R
5|$|There {{are many}} {{prominent}} bouldering areas throughout the United States, including Hueco Tanks in Texas, Mount Evans in Colorado, and The <b>Buttermilks</b> in Bishop, California. Squamish, British Columbia {{is one of}} the most popular bouldering areas in Canada. Europe also hosts a number of bouldering sites, such as Fontainebleau in France, Albarracín in Spain, and various mountains throughout Switzerland.|$|R
50|$|Paul David Robinson (born August 28, 1987) is an American {{professional}} rock climber {{who specializes}} in bouldering. He has established and repeated several bouldering problems at the V15 difficulty rating, {{in such areas as}} Hueco Tanks, the <b>Buttermilks,</b> and Magic Wood. In 2007, Robinson became the second climber in history to successfully climb a V13 boulder problem in one attempt.|$|R
5|$|If built, {{the light}} rail would have as its western {{terminus}} a maintenance facility across Highway 82 from the airport. It {{would include a}} stop at <b>Buttermilk</b> and parallel the highway, using the old Maroon Creek Bridge, until it reached Monarch Street downtown. There it would turn south to its eastern terminus at Rubey Park. If there is not sufficient support or funding for the light rail, it could be built as bus lanes at first.|$|E
5|$|It may be {{prepared}} with toppings such as sugar, chocolate or maple glazes, dusted with granulated sugar or cinnamon-sugar, or served plain without any topping. The {{shape of the}} doughnut can lend to the retention of a greater amount of glaze or other toppings compared to other doughnut styles. The old-fashioned doughnut may have a similar texture {{to that of a}} <b>buttermilk</b> doughnut, may be crisp in texture, and typically has cracks and pores on its surface.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} popular forms of meal in Ahmedabad is a typical Gujarati thali which was first served commercially by Chandvilas Hotel in 1900. It {{consists}} of roti (Chapati), dal, rice and shaak (cooked vegetables, sometimes with curry), with accompaniments of pickles and roasted papads. Sweet dishes include laddoo, mango, and vedhmi. Dhoklas, theplas and dhebras are also very popular dishes in Ahmedabad. Beverages include <b>buttermilk</b> and tea. Drinking alcohol is forbidden in Ahmedabad.|$|E
50|$|Bishop is {{immediately}} {{to the east of}} the Sierra Nevada, and west of the White Mountains. Numerous peaks are within a short distance of Bishop, including Mount Humphreys (13,986 ft.), to the west, White Mountain Peak (14,242 ft.) in the northeast, and pyramidal Mount Tom (13,658 ft.) northwest of town. Basin Mountain (13,187 ft.) is viewed to the west from Bishop as it rises above the <b>Buttermilks.</b>|$|R
50|$|Basin Mountain in California's eastern Sierra Nevada {{range is}} a large and {{visually}} prominent peak {{near the city of}} Bishop. Basin Mountain is not as high as its neighboring peaks, Mount Tom and Mount Humphreys, but it dominates the view to the west from Bishop as it rises above the <b>Buttermilks.</b> It is a relatively easy scramble to the top. The summit is not especially notable, except for the wonderful views it offers of Mount Tom, which dominates the skyline just to the north. The night-time views of Bishop and the Owens valley are spectacular.|$|R
50|$|On 30 March 2010, Robinson {{claimed the}} first ascent of Lucid Dreaming, a {{highball}} bouldering {{problem in the}} <b>Buttermilks</b> near Bishop, California. He originally proposed a grade of V16, the highest bouldering grade that had yet been assigned to a problem, but he later suggested Lucid Dreaming might be a V15. The boulder is 55 ft from ground to top, beginning with a steep overhang and ending with a slab traversal. Much {{of the difficulty of}} the climb comes from two consecutive V12 moves near the beginning, both featuring small, technical holds. The problem was not repeated until January 2014.|$|R
5|$|Plain milk was not {{consumed}} by adults except the poor or sick, being {{reserved for the}} very young or elderly, and then usually as <b>buttermilk</b> or whey. Fresh milk was overall less common than other dairy products {{because of the lack}} of technology to keep it from spoiling. Tea and coffee, both made from plants found in the Old World, were popular in East Asia and the Muslim world during the Middle Ages. However, neither of these non-alcoholic social drinks were consumed in Europe before the late 16th and early 17th century.|$|E
5|$|Milk was an {{important}} source of animal protein for those who could not afford meat. It would mostly come from cows, but milk from goats and sheep was also common. Plain fresh milk was not consumed by adults except the poor or sick, and was usually reserved for the very young or elderly. Poor adults would sometimes drink <b>buttermilk</b> or whey or milk that was soured or watered down. Fresh milk was overall less common than other dairy products {{because of the lack of}} technology to keep it from spoiling. On occasion it was used in upper-class kitchens in stews, but it was difficult to keep fresh in bulk and almond milk was generally used in its stead.|$|E
5|$|Several {{clinical}} {{studies have shown}} that MFGM could positively affect circulating lipids. A single-blind RCT in overweight adults has shown that the effects of milk fat on plasma lipids were modulated by the MFGM content; compared to butter oil (control diet), consumption of whipping cream (MFGM diet) for 8 weeks did not impair the lipoprotein profile. Another double-blind RCT in overweight and obese adults has also shown that MFGM attenuated the negative effects of a high-saturated fats meal by reducing postprandial cholesterol, inflammatory markers and insulin response. A double-blind RCT in normal healthy adults has indicated that one month consumption of <b>buttermilk</b> rich in MFGM led to reduction in serum cholesterol and triacylglycerol levels as well as blood pressure.|$|E
5|$|While {{his work}} with Ziegfeld {{encompassed}} {{the majority of his}} working life, Stamper and Gene Buck worked for other producers as well. He had songs in two plays - When Claudia Smiles (1914) and Broadway and <b>Buttermilk</b> (1916) prior to traveling to London with Buck to write songs for Zig Zag! which ran for 648 performances at the London Hippodrome. Stamper returned to London in 1918 to write songs for another review Box O' Tricks with Frederick Chapelle, which ran for 625 performances. During his first trip to London, Buck befriended a man {{who turned out to be}} a German spy. Two results of this event were fellow passenger Eddie Rickenbacker deciding to enlist to fly, and Dave Stamper having to prove to British police and a Judge that his pages covered with numbers were sheet music rather than a code.|$|E
5|$|After Exit 2, Route 25 {{bends to}} the northeast, {{bypassing}} <b>Buttermilk</b> Bay and the densely populated village of Buzzards Bay {{to the south}}. The route passes Union Pond and Dicks Pond {{to the south and}} Spectacle Pond and Sandy Pond to the north before entering the town of Plymouth. In Plymouth, Route 25 passes to the north of several cranberry bogs and small ponds. While the freeway has no interchanges in Plymouth, a rest area is located off eastbound Route 25 in the town; the area is inaccessible from westbound Route 25. Due to state funding cutbacks, services at the rest area are limited to summer weekends (Friday to Sunday) as of 2010. After the rest area, Route 25 passes over Bourne Road and turns sharply to head in a southwestern direction. The route passes under Bournedale Road after entering the town of Bourne. In Bourne, Route 25 has its final interchange; Exit 3 (formerly Exit 2) serves the villages of Buzzards Bay and Sagamore, connecting to US 6 (Scenic Highway) and Route 28 north. From Exit 3, US 6 is used to access the Sagamore Bridge in northern Bourne and the towns of Hyannis and Provincetown on Cape Cod.|$|E
5|$|Communities {{along the}} Saw Mill played minor {{parts in the}} Revolutionary War, {{especially}} after the Battle of White Plains in October 1776. The defeated Continentals retreated to the vicinity of Peekskill while the victorious British withdrew to Kingsbridge {{in what is now}} the Bronx. Neither side wanted to cede control of the Hudson Valley, which divided New England from the other colonies. This left most of Westchester unoccupied neutral ground. However, Westchester was not demilitarized. Local militias and raiding parties affiliated with both sides fought each other and terrorized the other's sympathizers and supporters. Many residents of southern Westchester abandoned their farms and drove their herds up the valley to <b>Buttermilk</b> Hill to protect them from Loyalist raids. The Continentals built forts near Hawthorne, where a minor tributary named Flykill Creek drained into the Saw Mill (roughly at the junction of today's Saw Mill and Taconic parkways), and built Yankee Dam to create a lake wide enough to slow any British progress up the river. At Chappaqua, the pacifist Quakers opened their meetinghouse as a hospital for injured Continental Army soldiers. Storm's tavern was a gathering place for Continental officers and, later, their French colleagues.|$|E
5|$|Food {{preservation}} methods were {{basically the same}} as had been used since antiquity, and did not change much until the invention of canning in the early 19th century. The most common and simplest method was to expose foodstuffs to heat or wind to remove moisture, thereby prolonging the durability if not the flavor of almost any type of food from cereals to meats; the drying of food worked by drastically reducing the activity of various water-dependent microorganisms that cause decay. In warm climates this was mostly achieved by leaving food out in the sun, and in the cooler northern climates by exposure to strong winds (especially common for the preparation of stockfish), or in warm ovens, cellars, attics, and at times even in living quarters. Subjecting food {{to a number of}} chemical processes such as smoking, salting, brining, conserving or fermenting also made it keep longer. Most of these methods had the advantage of shorter preparation times and of introducing new flavors. Smoking or salting meat of livestock butchered in autumn was a common household strategy to avoid having to feed more animals than necessary during the lean winter months. Butter tended to be heavily salted (5–10%) in order not to spoil. Vegetables, eggs or fish were also often pickled in tightly packed jars, containing brine and acidic liquids (lemon juice, verjuice or vinegar). Another method was to seal the food by cooking it in sugar or honey or fat, in which it was then stored. Microbial modification was also encouraged, however, by a number of methods; grains, fruit and grapes were turned into alcoholic drinks thus killing any pathogens, and milk was fermented and curdled into a multitude of cheeses or <b>buttermilk.</b>|$|E

25|$|The local cuisine {{resembles the}} cuisine of Gujarat. Ubadiyu {{is a local}} {{delicacy}} made of vegetables and beans with herbs. The common foods include rice, roti, vegetables, river fish, and crab. People also enjoy <b>buttermilk</b> and chutney made of different fruits and herbs.|$|E
25|$|Dunskin, {{buckskin}} dun, or <b>buttermilk</b> dun: a bay-based {{coat with}} one cream allele {{and at least}} one dun allele. These are quite difficult to tell apart from ordinary duns. They are a slightly paler shade, and retain their dark points and primitive markings.|$|E
25|$|The summit {{can also}} be reached by {{accessing}} Devil's Path from the West via either trailhead of the Diamond Notch Trail. This route allows hikers to view the scenic <b>Buttermilk</b> Falls at the junction of Devil's Path & the Diamond Notch Trail.|$|E
25|$|<b>Buttermilk</b> Falls divides Oatka Creek {{into two}} {{distinct}} geological regions. The upper stream's bedrock is local sedimentary rock formations, with the shales and sandstones of the Sonyea Group, shale-limestone Genesee Group and Tully Limestone dominating from the headwaters to Pavilion. Between there and Le Roy the shales and thin limestones of the Hamilton Group underlie the creek.|$|E
