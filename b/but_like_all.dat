25|$|Ecologically, B.subg. Isostylis {{is similar}} to other Banksias. As with other Banksia taxa, all three species have proteoid roots, roots with dense {{clusters}} of short lateral rootlets that form a mat in the soil just below the leaf litter. These roots are particularly efficient at absorbing nutrients from nutrient-poor soils, such as the phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia. They lack a lignotuber, so shrubs are killed by bushfire; mature trees of B.ilicifolia have a limited ability to resprout from epicormic buds on the trunk. <b>But</b> <b>like</b> <b>all</b> Banksias they release their aerial seed bank following a bushfire. This adaptation, known as serotiny, ensures the rapid regeneration of populations killed by fire.|$|E

25|$|The {{defining}} {{feature of}} Birmingham's {{politics in the}} post-war era was the loss of much of city's independence. World War II had seen a huge expansion {{in the role of}} central government in British life, and this pattern continued into the post-war years: for Birmingham, this meant major decisions about the city's future tended to be made outside the city, mainly in Westminster. Planning, development and municipal functions were increasingly dictated by national policy and legislation; council finances came to be dominated by central government subsidies; and institutions such as gas, water and transport were taken out of the city's control. Birmingham's unrivalled size and wealth may have given it more political influence than any other provincial city, <b>but</b> <b>like</b> <b>all</b> such cities it was essentially subordinate to Whitehall; the days of Birmingham as a semi-autonomous city-state, with its leading citizens dictating the agenda of national politics, were over.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{what the}} Bible is to Christianity and the Quran is to Islam, <b>but</b> <b>like</b> <b>all</b> major ancient Indian religions, {{there is no}} {{consensus}} among the different Buddhist traditions as to what constitutes the scriptures or a common canon in Buddhism. The general belief among Buddhists is that the canonical corpus is vast. This corpus includes the ancient Sutras organized into Nikayas, itself the part of three basket of texts called the Tripitakas. Each Buddhist tradition has its own collection of texts, much of which is translation of ancient Pali and Sanskrit Buddhist texts of India. The Chinese Buddhist canon, for example, includes 2184 texts in 55 volumes, while the Tibetan canon comprises 1108 texts – all claimed to have been spoken by the Buddha – and another 3461 texts composed by Indian scholars revered in the Tibetan tradition. The Buddhist textual history has been vast; over 40,000 manuscripts mostly Buddhist, some non-Buddhist, were discovered in 1900 in the Dunhuang Chinese cave alone.|$|E
25|$|After {{a disappointing}} season in 1919, Hearne's all-round play won Middlesex the County Championship in 1920, <b>but,</b> <b>like</b> <b>all</b> English spin bowlers of the time, he was remarkably hopeless on the rock-hard Australian wickets and {{accomplished}} little {{even with the}} bat.

However, from 1925 his bowling skill declined, though he was good enough as a batsman for England selection in 1926, and he remained {{a force to be reckoned}} with in county cricket into the 1930s - despite a major injury when fielding in 1928. In 1929, Hearne hit 285 not out against Essex at Leyton and on a very dusty wicket at Chesterfield in 1933 recalled his former bowling skill by taking 9 for 61, the best figures of his career.|$|E

25|$|In 1933, native Iowan Henry A. Wallace went to Washington as Secretary of Agriculture {{and served}} as {{principal}} architect for the new farm program. Wallace, {{former editor of the}} Midwest's leading farm journal, Wallace's Farmer, believed that prosperity would return to the agricultural sector only if agricultural production was curtailed. Further, he believed that farmers would be monetarily compensated for withholding agricultural land from production. These two principles were incorporated into the Agricultural Adjustment Act passed in 1933. Iowa farmers experienced some recovery {{as a result of the}} legislation <b>but</b> <b>like</b> <b>all</b> Iowans, they did not experience total recovery until the 1940s. Iowa's only Nobel Peace Prize Winner, Norman Borlaug, was launched in his researches in plant genomics by funding and research through Iowa State University developing strains of rice in Mexico and which emanated from the work of Henry Wallace. Wallace and Borlaug's work helped create the now internationally significant agricultural concern Pioneer Hi-Bred, now a division of DuPont.|$|E

The album marks only the third recording of the composition to have been released since it was first broadcast on French radio by Office de Radiodiffusion Télévision Française.

500|$|In 1913 Knight made a {{painting}} that was a first for a woman artist, Self Portrait with Nude, showing herself painting a nude model, the artist Ella Naper. The painting is a complex, formal composition in a studio setting. Using mirrors, Knight painted herself and Naper as seen by someone entering the studio behind them both. As an art student Knight had not been permitted to directly paint nude models <b>but,</b> <b>like</b> <b>all</b> female art students in England at the time, was restricted to working from casts and copying existing drawings. Knight deeply resented this, and Self Portrait with Nude is a clear challenge, and reaction, to those rules. The painting was first shown in 1913 at the Passmore Edwards Art Gallery in Newlyn, and was well received by both the local press and other artists. Although the Royal Academy rejected the painting for exhibition, it was shown at the International Society of Sculptors, Painters and Gravers in London, as The Model. The Daily Telegraphs critic called the painting [...] "vulgar", and suggested that it [...] "might quite appropriately have stayed in the artist's studio". Despite this reaction, Knight continued to exhibit the painting throughout her career, and it continued to receive press criticism. After Knight's death the picture, now known simply as Self Portrait (1913), was purchased by the National Portrait Gallery, and is now considered both a key work {{in the story of}} female self-portraiture and as symbolic of wider female emancipation.|$|E
