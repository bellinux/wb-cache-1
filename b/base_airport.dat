40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{questions}} of why carriers advocate for higher per-passenger airport charges and lower per-flight charges, and whether and when this proposal is welfare-enhancing. Specifically, the paper compares the optimal mix of per-flight and per-passenger <b>based</b> <b>airport</b> charges from both a monopoly carriers' and the social viewpoints conditional on airport cost recovery. It focuses on the trade-off between price and frequency (i. e., schedule delays) when time valuations are uniform, or differ, between business and leisure passengers. We identify an easy test {{for the evaluation of}} the mix of per-passenger and per-flight <b>based</b> <b>airport</b> charges by policy makers, which is simply to check whether the carrier's preferred per-flight charge is zero. Our analysis suggests that {{there is no need for}} immediate regulatory corrections of the current trend towards the strong use of per-passenger <b>based</b> <b>airport</b> charges...|$|R

50|$|By Air - The nearest {{airport to}} Leh Palace is the Leh Air Force <b>Base</b> <b>Airport,</b> which is 5 kms away from Leh Palace. At the Leh Airport, being a {{military}} airport, the security checks {{are a little}} more stringent than usual. By Train - Pathankot and Chandigarh are the closest railway stations to Leh, but are a three-day bus ride away. Hence, travelling via Road/Rail to Leh is one option most travellers avoid. By Road - From the Main Bazaar in the city, Leh Palace can be approached via Jama Masjid or via the Zangsti Road where it takes a turn and goes past the Shii'a Mosque..|$|E
50|$|The air {{transport}} unit and company 5 {{was founded in}} March 1962 as a light-transport unit 5 {{under the command of}} Hauptmann (Captain)Fritz Kolb. The Lufttransport Staffel 5 used Piper Super Cub, Hiller UH-12 B, Alouette II and Dornier Do 27 on the military airfield Reichenbach and on the Military airfield Frutigen. In 1964, the Pilatus P-2 was introduced by the Lufttransport Staffel 5 and from 1965 on the military airfield Kägiswil became the wartime home base of the unit. At the end of the 1960s, the Pilatus PC-6 and the Junkers Ju-52 were used by the Lufttransport Staffel 5. From 1974 to 2010 the Alouette III was used by the Lufttransport Staffel 5. As of 1992, the Lufttransport Staffel 5 operated the AS332M1 Super Puma. These were stationed at the Interlaken Air <b>Base</b> <b>airport</b> until 2003. The AS532UL Cougar was also entering service at the Lufttransport Staffel 5 and in 2010 followed the Eurocopter EC635.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a methodology {{for assessing the}} future route network and flight schedule at a medium-sized European airport. The starting point is the existing origin and destination demand from the <b>base</b> <b>airport</b> across the world. This is expanded using growth rates by country or region for the period up to year 2015. The future origin and destination demand is then converted into route traffic, subject to a threshold for direct service. Where demand falls below this level, traffic is reallocated via various appropriate hubs. A model of frequency and aircraft size is applied to estimate the future air service on each route and a schedule created, allocating these flights to specific times of day. The scenario where the <b>base</b> <b>airport</b> operates as a hub is then investigated. This involves identifying a suitable hub model, considering geographical and competitive issues. The origin and destination demand is increased, resulting in an enlarged network of routes. Flights are then scheduled within the constraints of an optimal wave pattern. The outputs are of considerable interest in long-term airport planning and also offer an insight into future airline network strategies and opportunities...|$|E
