40|$|The tree-covered hills around Branch provide {{firewood}} and timber. Over the years, {{this local}} supply {{has been used}} to build houses and boats, horse slides and box carts, wharves and flakes, furniture and barrels. The Big Hill is known as a good place to cut rails and stakes for fencing. Close by, Birchy Hill is known for its growth of birch trees. Birch is good wood for <b>barrels,</b> <b>cart</b> wheels, snowshoes, furniture, slide knees and staircase rails. Alderly Hill is known for its growth of alders. In the past, alders were used for firewood and to make brooms and lobster pots. Other wood cutting places include Simons Nap, the Knap Where Peter Cut the Wood, and Where Tom Cut Stuff for the House. (Thomas Nash(mid- 1800 s) not the first Thomas Nash cut wood here to build his house in the Lane. Tommy in the Bog, as he was known, {{is said to have been}} 7 feet tall and had the strength of 5 to 7 men. ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A brigadier now came up, {{and ordered}} the battalions to {{barricade}} all the streets they had won, with <b>barrels</b> and <b>carts.</b> A French regiment arrived, and occupied the church of Saint Salvador, and the battery which commanded the bridge, across which Vaudemont's corps could now be seen approaching. The redoubt {{on the other side}} of the bridge was only held by fifty men, and they were now strengthened by a hundred of the French soldiers. The Austrians approached, making sure that the town had already been taken, and looking out for a signal that was to be hoisted. Their astonishment was great, when a heavy musketry fire was opened upon them by the garrison of the outpost, while the guns of the battery on the wall plunged their shot in among them.|$|R
50|$|The {{story is}} as follows: on {{returning}} home from a hunt, William learns that King Louis (Charlemagne's son) has forgotten him {{in the distribution of}} fiefs. William reminds the king of his past service (as told in the chanson Li coronemenz Looïs), and he is eventually accorded the right to an expeditionary force to conquer Nîmes from the Saracens. Disguising himself as a merchant leading a convoy of carts, and hiding his troops in <b>barrels</b> on the <b>carts,</b> William is able to come into the city and seize it (echoing the ruse of the Trojan Horse).|$|R
5000|$|In {{common with}} the Schneider designs the Putilov guns had {{hydraulic}} recoil absorption and pneumatic recuperation. The gun had variable recoil, at less than 12° elevation the recoil length was 1800 1800 mm, at greater than 16° elevation the recoil length was reduced to 1000 mm. The 152mm guns barrels were designed to be detached from the carriage for transport and guide plates were added to muzzle to help with removal/installation of the barrel. The <b>barrel</b> transport <b>cart</b> and the gun carriage required teams of 10 horses to move them. Later in the war the Russian army started using tractors, often imported American Allis-Chamers types, to move these guns as a train. It took a trained crew 20 - 30 minutes to ready the gun for firing from the transport configuration. The gun's wheels could be fitted with hinged flat plates, similar to the French [...] "ceinture de roues", to permit towing on soft ground. The Russian projectiles were a little lighter than the French equivalent weighing 38.6 kg for the shrapnel projectile and 41 kg for the high explosive projectile.|$|R
50|$|Fresh {{water was}} {{available}} from the many springs in the area via two blow wells known as the Caedda Wells. Later this name was contracted; however the blow wells are still known by the locals as the Cadwells. Due to the limestone strata, there are many freshwater springs in the area. One such spring {{is the source of}} the local stream known as the Beck. It flows through the village in roughly a south-west/north-east direction. Where it passes beneath Beck Lane, there is a restored hand-operated pump which originally drew water up into the <b>barrels</b> on horse-drawn <b>carts.</b> These carts would then deliver the water to houses in the village that had no water source of their own.|$|R
5000|$|In 1880 the Metz Brewery {{was located}} at 1717 South 3rd Street, and was {{producing}} [...] per year. Later the facility moved to 209 Hickory Street into the former Willow Springs Distilling Company facility. Considered to be modern for the time, the facilities sat on {{an entire city}} block. Early brewing equipment included three cooling vaults, two of which were twenty feet wide by seventy-five feet long, and one smaller, being twenty feet wide by thirty in length. The ice rooms immediately above were of the same dimensions. The mash tub and brewing kettle each had a capacity for holding one hundred barrels. Barns for the delivery horses were also located on site. The brewery {{was said to have}} [...] "no equal in the country." [...] The Metz brothers also ran the Metz Brothers Beer Hall, located on 510 South Tenth Street, where beer was supplied in <b>barrels</b> by horse-drawn <b>cart</b> from the main brewery.|$|R
50|$|In {{light of}} the farming, gardening, small fruit raising, and {{cultivation}} of root crops, a freight depot was established following {{the arrival of the}} railroad right-of-way. It was reported in 1887 that the total number of <b>barrels</b> of cauliflower <b>carted</b> from the depot was 3,762. The building was renovated in the summer of 1879 to afford better accommodations for passenger service. In the fall of 1895, new interior floors and new roof shingles were installed as well as new platform planks. Regular passenger service appears on timetables in April 1891. On the timetables the name Franklinville first appears in April 1891, then disappears to reappear in September 1892. Then the name disappears again but reappears in June 1894. It is listed as Franklinville as late as Employee Timetable #3 from June 1897, when the superintendent of the LIRR ordered that names be the same as the postal jurisdiction. With the opening of the Laurel Post Office, Franklinville was revised as well. By the summer of 1898, timetables reflected the modifications, with Franklinville remaining in parentheses. Thereafter it was simply Laurel. Soon after the station became a signal stop only.|$|R
2500|$|Another {{technological}} {{solution was}} implemented in 1885 – obtaining fresh {{water from the}} sea by desalination. This had been proposed {{as far back as}} 1869, when it was envisaged that condensers would be used to produce [...] of pure water per day from seawater. The idea was initially rejected due to the high cost but by the mid-1880s concern was growing that Gibraltar's water supply would be inadequate {{in the event of a}} new siege. The War Office had a change of heart and agreed to fund the project. The first purified water from the newly installed condensers was produced in March 1885. Because Gibraltar still had no distribution network for drinking water, it could only be delivered from <b>barrels</b> in donkey <b>carts</b> or by hand. Despite the cost, the new water supply enabled the inhabitants of Gibraltar, for the first time in their history, to rely on a source of pathogen-free water. The new system proved its worth only a few weeks after it was installed when cholera broke out in the town of La Línea de la Concepción just across the border with Spain. 191 of La Línea's 12,000 inhabitants died of the disease, but only 22 died in Gibraltar – about five per cent of the death toll in the previous epidemic.|$|R
