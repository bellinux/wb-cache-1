40|$|As the {{population}} in urban areas around the world grows each year, cities struggling {{to cope with the}} increased urban migration expand at varying rates. This urban sprawl comes with the expansion and exacerbation of the Surface Urban Heat Islands (SUHI) of cities. The connection between land-use/land-cover (LULC) and the Land Surface Temperature (LST) is the focus of this study, more specifically which of the LULC practices prevalent in Pakistani cities are particularly contributing to the formation, expansion and intensification of SUHIs is the question this study aims to answer. LST of the district of Lahore was calculated using Landsat images more than a decade apart. The LULC types were also mapped using supervised classification techniques, while the training areas for the classification were gathered using random sampling technique during a survey of the study area. Using the resultant LST & LULC maps of the city and superimposing the boundaries of several new satellite towns of the city, the temporal changes in LST and LULC were compared. The <b>built-up</b> <b>surface</b> area within the city district in 2011 showed 25 % increase since 2000...|$|E
40|$|Background: Anthropogenic habitat {{disturbance}} {{is a prime}} {{cause in}} the current trend of the Earth's reduction in biodiversity. Here we show that the human footprint on the Central African rainforest, which is resulting in deforestation and growth of densely populated urban agglomerates, is associated to ecological divergence and cryptic speciation leading to adaptive radiation within the major malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae. Methodology/Principal Findings: In southern Cameroon, the frequency of two molecular forms-M and S-among which reproductive isolation is strong but still incomplete, was correlated to an index of urbanisation extracted from remotely sensed data, expressed as the proportion of <b>built-up</b> <b>surface</b> in each sampling unit. The two forms markedly segregated along an urbanisation gradient forming a bimodal cline of similar to 6 -km width: the S form was exclusive to the rural habitat, whereas only the M form was present {{in the core of}} densely urbanised settings, co-occurring at times in the same polluted larval habitats of the southern house mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus-a species association that was not historically recorded before. Conclusions/Significance: Our results indicate that when humans create novel habitats and ecological heterogeneities, they can provide evolutionary opportunities for rapid adaptive niche shifts associated with lineage divergence, whose consequences upon malaria transmission might be significant...|$|E

40|$|Air {{quality in}} {{developed}} areas is being increasingly compromised by {{the effect of}} urbanization, which is favouring the presence of atmospheric pollutants derived from human-induced activities. Land cover change {{is one of the}} consequences most closely associated with urbanization, leading to a growing presence of dark <b>built-up</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The target of this investigation was to model the Catalonian Air Quality Index (CAQI) from the combined effect of the surface reflectance capacity of urban surfaces with solar radiation and elevation. Geoprocessing tools were used to produce the information required to characterise these variables in the buffer areas surrounding 75 different air quality monitoring stations located across the region. Cluster analysis and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) were applied to group these stations according to their similarity and replicate the annual mean values of CAQI recorded in Catalonia in 2011, respectively. Finally, discriminant analysis enabled assigning ungauged areas to the cluster and MLR model that best fitted their solar radiation, surface reflectance and elevation features. The implementation of this approach resulted in highly accurate predictions of CAQI, providing a mechanism of identification of areas having a number of days with poor air quality during the year. Since these areas were related to the presence of land cover types with high sunlight absorption, the proposed methodology was suggested to support the adoption of measures aimed at controlling urban air pollution based on replacing <b>built-up</b> <b>surfaces</b> by green infrastructure.

The CORINE Land Cover database enables the measurement of the gradient values for the spatial distribution of built-up areas in European cities. Instead of the exponential or power functions, which usually provide the best fit for the distributions of population densities, we find that two linear functions strongly differentiating a central and a peripheral gradient provide the best fit for <b>built-up</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The comparison between the 1990 and 2000 CORINE images demonstrates a convergence in the trend of urban spread between Northern and Southern European cities.

Its area is approximately 45, 480 m 2 which is 4, 55 ha. From the urban perspective it is an intensive development in a separated block of the city with a protection zone. Total area is permeated by a few lines for pedestrians. The pedestrian zone provides better permeability of the area and better accessibility of the trade parterre. The buildings connect to surrounding development and respect the density of the integrity of the area. Intensive housing structure is regarded as "the city of short distance". The achievement of high density of housing development combines lots of various functions and relatively small <b>built-up</b> <b>surface.</b> While high-quality environment is preserved, people can find job oportunities in the intensive housing development without the need for transport.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{temporal}} variability of carbon dioxide fluxes in the city centre of Arnhem, a middle-sized Dutch city. The fluxes were continuously measured during four years (2012 - 2016) using the eddy-covariance method. Additionally, continuous meteorological measurements were carried out. We also analysed data from 30 -minute traffic counts performed during those years. Results indicate that the city centre of Arnhem is a strong emission source of CO 2 compared to many other cities. The measured annual CO 2 flux equals about 8. 0 kgCm - 2 yr - 1. Heterogeneity within the footprint of the EC tower appeared to have no or only a small influence on the estimated annual and seasonal carbon fluxes. Sector analysis shows that CO 2 fluxes are consistently higher in sectors with the highest <b>built-up</b> <b>surface</b> fraction. However, no statistically significant relationship could be determined. Traffic and space-heating related burning of natural gas are the main emission sources. Weekly and diurnal variations in CO 2 flux are clearly correlated with traffic intensity, whereas seasonal variation can largely be explained by space heating demand. Partitioning of the total flux into a heating-related and traffic-related flux revealed that space heating accounts for up to 60 % to the total flux during winter. Traffic intensity remains more or less constant throughout the year. In summer, when space heating is absent, CO 2 emission is almost entirely related to traffic intensity. However, our estimations suggest that human respiration could have a non-negligible share in this. The contribution of the small fraction of urban green in the city centre is probably minimal. The annual emissions for the city centre estimated from our EC measurements are 20 - 25 % lower than those reported for the whole city by the official emission inventory. Climate projections for the Netherlands suggest that in 2050 Heating Degree Days would be reduced by 27 % resulting into a 32 % reduction of the heating-related emission flux, without a change in fossil fuel use. </p...|$|E

40|$|Peri-urbanisation is the {{expansion}} of compact urban areas towards low-density settlements. This phenomenon directly challenges the agricultural landscape multifunctionality, including its carbon (C) storage capacity. Using satellite data, we mapped peri-urban C stocks in soil and <b>built-up</b> <b>surfaces</b> over three areas from 1993 to 2014 in the Emilia-Romagna region, Italy: a thinly populated area around Piacenza, an intermediate-density area covering the Reggio Emilia-Modena conurbation and a densely anthropized area developing {{along the coast of}} Rimini. Satellite-derived maps enabled the quantitative analysis of spatial and temporal features of urban growth and soil sealing, expressed as the ratio between C in built-up land and organic C in soils (Cc/Co). The three areas show substantial differences in C stock balance and soil sealing evolution. In Piacenza (Cc/Co = 0. 07 in 1993), although questioned by late industrial expansion and connected residential sprawl (Cc/Co growth by 38 %), most of the new urbanisation spared the best rural soils. The Reggio Emilia-Modena conurbation, driven by the polycentricism of the area and the heterogeneity of economic sectors (Cc/Co rising from 0. 08 to 0. 14 from 1993 to 2014), balances sprawl and densification. Rimini, severely sealed since the 1960 s (Cc/Co = 0. 23 in 1993), densifies its existing settlements and develops an industrial expansion of the hinterland, with Cc/Co growth accelerating from + 15 % before 2003 to + 36 % for the last decade...|$|R

Increasing temperatures have massive impact on cities. High amounts of paved- and <b>built-up</b> <b>surfaces</b> store heat during the day, making cities warmer than their rural environment. In order to keep our living environments healthy and save; many cities all over the world are developing climate adaptation strategies. In this scope The Hague is falling behind; the city lacks policy to effectively adapt to the changing climate conditions. This is alarming since The Hague suffers from a severe heat island. In order to effectively mitigate heat in The Hague; this thesis develops an integrated approach towards climate adaptation. Therefore spatial policies get assessed on their climate goals and combined with necessary measures to mitigate heat. The integrated strategy is developed by performing three strategy design studies on The Hague. The proposed actions are in accordance to the city’s spatial ambitions and focus on the city’s green structure, spatial planning and demographic trends especially of the elderly. The synthesis of these three studies results in an integrated strategy, The Hague 2040 +, that offers the municipality a set of key-actions the city can execute under existing policy to effectively mitigate urban heat.

40|$|Urban sprawl is the {{uncontrolled}} and uncoordinated {{outgrowth of}} towns and cities. Noting the various studies, {{the pattern of}} urban sprawl is characterised by using spatial metrics based {{on the extent of}} paved surface or built-up areas. The process of urban sprawl can be described by change in pattern over time, like proportional increase in <b>built-up</b> <b>surface</b> to population leading to rapid urban spatial expansion. With an understanding of the patterns, processes and causes of urban sprawl, the consequences of sprawl can be explored which are reflected by the patterns, thus eventually aiding in the design of spatial planning support system. Following the sequence of patterns, process, causes and consequence, sets the research agenda as the framework for this research. The current research addresses the issue of urban sprawl in the context of Bangalore, India. We propose a theoretical framework to analyse the interaction of planning and governance on the extent of outgrowth and level of services. Reviewing the different indicator frameworks, we also propose urban sprawl indicators and operationalise the same for Bangalore. The indicators comprise spatial metrics (derived from temporal satellite remote sensing data) and other metrics obtained from a house-hold survey. The interaction of different indicators with respect to the core city and the outgrowth is determined by multidimensional scaling. The analyses reveal the underlying patterns -similarities (and dissimilarities) that relate with the different governance structures that prevail here. Subsequently, we attempt to understand the process of sprawl. This might help one to understand the dynamics that lead to such outgrowths. An attempt was made to capture the dynamics using systems approach and finally the insights gained were translated into agent-based land-use model. Noting the evolution of spatial planning support system (SPSS), the consequences of sprawl are explored. The SPSS developed on an agent-based modelling environment, is essentially a process-based land-use model. We highlight the need for an integrated SPSS, illustrating its development and evaluation. The policy analysis carried out using the SPSS offers insights into areas of concern. It is concluded by noting the drawbacks and challenges for future research for managing urban sprawl. In the present context, with the escalating problem of urban sprawl, the evolution of a SPSS {{in the form of the}} BangaloreSim model is the first step in this direction. The SPSS aids in undertaking policy analysis for certain policy measures and its consequences on urban land-use.

Urban areas areimportant environments, accounting for approximately half the population of theworld. Cities attract residents partly because they offer ample opportunitiesfor development, which often results in urban sprawl and its complex environmentalimplications. It is therefore necessary to develop technologies andmethodologies that permit monitoring the effects of various problems that havebeen or {{are thought to be}} associated with urban sprawl. These technologieswould facilitate the adoption of policies seeking to minimize the negativeeffects of urban sprawl. Solutions require a precise knowledge of the urbanenvironment under consideration to enable the development of more efficienturban zoning plans. The high dynamism of urban areas produces seeminglycontinuous alterations of land cover and use; consequently, cartographicinformation becomes quickly and is oftentimes outdated. Hence, the availabilityof detailed and up-to-date cartographic and geographic information is imperativefor an adequate management and planning of urban areas. Usually the process ofcreating land-use/land-cover maps of urban areas involves field visits andclassical photo-interpretation techniques employing aerial imagery. Thesemethodologies are expensive, time consuming, and also subjective. Digital imageprocessing techniques help reduce the volume of information that needs to bemanually interpreted. The aim of thisstudy is to establish a methodology to automatically detect buildings and toautomatically classify land use in urban environments using multispectralhigh-spatial resolution imagery and LiDAR data. These data were acquired in theframework of the Spanish National Plan for Airborne Orthophotographs, having beenavailable for public Spanish administrations. Two mainapproaches for automatic building detection and localization using high spatialresolution imagery and LiDAR data are evaluated The thresholding-based approachis founded on the establishment of two threshold values: one is the minimumheight to be considered as a building, defined using the LiDAR data; the other isthe presence of vegetation, defined with the spectral response. The otherapproach follows the standard scheme of object-based image classification:segmentation, feature extraction and selection, and classification, hereperformed using decision trees. In addition, the effect of including contextualrelations with shadows in the building detection process is evaluated. Qualityassessment is performed at both area and object levels. Area-level assessments evaluatethe building delineation performance whereas object-level assessments evaluatethe accuracy in the spatial location of individual buildings. Urban land-useclassification is achieved by applying object-based image analysis techniques. Objects are defined using the boundaries of cadastral plots. The plots were characterizedto achieve the classification by employing a descriptive feature setspecifically designed to describe urban environments. The proposed descriptivefeatures aim to emulate human cognition by numerically quantifying theproperties of the image elements and so enable each to be distinguishable. These features describe each plot as a single entity based on several aspectsthat reflect the information used: spectral, three-dimensional, and geometrictypologies. In addition, a set of contextual features at both the internal andexternal levels is defined. Internal context features describe an object withrespect to the land cover types contained within the plots, which were, in thiscase, buildings and vegetation. External context features characterise eachobject by considering the common properties of adjacent objects that, whencombined, create an aggregate in a higher level than plot level: urban blocks. Results show that thresholding-based building detection approachperforms better in the different scenarios assessed. This method produces amore accurate building delineation and object detection than the object-basedclassification method. The building type appears as a key factor in thebuilding detection performance. Thus, urban and industrial areas show betteraccuracies in detection metrics than suburban areas, due to the small size ofsuburban constructions, combined with the prominent presence of trees insuburban classes, hindering the building detection process. The relationsbetween buildings and shadows improve the object-level detection, removingsmall objects erroneously detected as buildings that negatively affect to thequality indices. Classificationtest results show that internal and external context features complement theimage-derived features, improving the classification accuracy values of urbanclasses, especially between classes that show similarities in their image-basedand three-dimensional features. Context features enable a superiordiscrimination of suburban building typologies, of planned urban areas andhistorical areas, and also of planned urban areas and isolated buildings. The outcomes showthat these automatic methodologies are especially suitable for computing usefulinformation for constructing and updating land-use/land-cover geospatialdatabases.

40|$|Background: Predicting {{habitats}} {{prone to}} favor disease transmission is challenging due to confounding information on habitats, reservoirs, and diseases. Comparative analysis, which aims at investigating ecological and evolutionary patterns among species, {{is a tool}} that may help. The emergence of zoonotic pathogens is a major health concern and is closely linked to habitat modifications by human activities. Risk assessment requires a better knowledge of the interactions between hosts, parasites, and the landscape. Methods: We used information from a field spatial study that investigated the distribution of murid rodents, in various habitats of three countries in Southeast Asia, in combination with their status of infection by 10 taxa of microparasites obtained from the literature. Microparasite species richness was calculated by rodent species on 20, 272 rodents of 13 species. Regression tree models and generalized linear models were used to explain microparasite diversity by the average distance between the trapping site and five categories of land cover: forest, steep agriculture land, flat agriculture land, water, and <b>built-up</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Another variable taken into account was the slope. Results: We found that microparasite diversity was positively associated with flat agriculture land, in this context mainly rice fields, and negatively associated with slope. Microparasite diversity decreased sharply a 100 m or less from flat agriculture land. Conclusion: We conclude that there is high microparasite circulation in rodents of flooded farmlands, meaning possibly {{a higher risk of}} disease for human inhabitants. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

The time evolution deduced from the InSAR time series is consistent with previous leveling data and shows that the lowering rate of the surface slightly decreases till 2008.

The spatial arrangement of built-up areas is analysed here by means of fractal indices using a set of 97 town sections selected from 18 European urban agglomerations. The fractal dimension is estimated by correlation techniques. Results confirm that morphological similarities are higher across countries/cities than within. Moreover, two types of fractal laws are considered: one uses the basic fractal scaling law; the other introduces a prefactor a that is often called a ''form factor'' in the fractal literature. Differences in the results obtained by both laws are explained empirically as well as theoretically, and suggestions are made for further measurements...|$|R

The time evolution deduced from the InSAR time series is consistent with previous leveling data and shows that the lowering rate of the surface slightly decreases till 2008. The analysis of groundwater levels in instrumented wells shows a correlation between the behavior of groundwater with the urban development and the acceleration of groundwater withdrawal. Also, the time variations suggest that the deformation became non-stationary, with upward and downward transient displacements related to the charge and discharge of the aquifers...|$|R

In contrast to conventional concrete core activation, the capillary tubes used in thermal building component activation lie about 5 mm close under the ceiling surface. This arrangement ensures a fast reaction and a high transmission performance of up to 90 W/m² (at 10 K temperature difference, see above), and also uses the concrete mass as a thermal accumulator. Capillary tube mats {{can be used for}} the construction of very thinly <b>built-up</b> heating <b>surfaces</b> as underfloor or wall heating. A layer thickness of less than 15 mm is quite feasible.

40|$|SummaryMany {{parts of}} the world are {{suffering}} from environmental problems such as deforestation. Many papers described the causes and consequences of deforestation but very little information is available on mechanisms and effective policy measures that slow down deforestation rates. The motivation behind this PhD-research research was the hope that {{a better understanding of the}} mechanisms would help policy makers take the appropriate actions to stimulate forest transitions. The northern Ethiopian highlands were selected as a case study because evidence was available that at least in some local, possibly isolated cases, regreening was observed during the last decades. This research addressed 3 main questions: (1) what are the regional trends of land use and land cover change that took place in the northern Ethiopian highlands? (2) Can the observed land use and land cover change be linked with socio-economic, demographic, political or environmental factors? (3) Is it possible to outline optimal land use patterns that minimize future land degradation and maximize production and profitability?Detection of differential greening is, therefore, premeditated under chapter 2. This chapter presents a methodology to evaluate land cover changes on the basis of NDVI time-series derived from NOAA_AVHRR and SPOT vegetation sensors. The results show that the aggregated greenness in Tigray has declined between 1982 and 2010. On the basis of interpolated rainfall data, it was tried to disentangle the effect of fluctuations in preceding rainfall and human impact on the landscape greening. From 2000 onwards the degreening trend was slowed down and in some cases even reversed, which could partially be attributed to land abandonment on completely degraded land and the relative success of soil conservation measures. To evaluate the link between observed land use and land cover change and the socio-economic, demographic, political or environmental factors, a detailed study was carried out in 5 rural villages (chapter 3) and the Dessaa forest (chapter 4) for 3 different time-frames: 1965, 1994 and 2007. The maps were based on the interpretation of aerial photographs and high-resolution satellite imagery in combination with field validation. The results from rural villages showed a strong decrease of the forest and bush land in favor of arable land and rangeland from 1965 till 1994. This trend was, however, slowed down and even reversed from 1994 onwards whereby some of the arable land and rangeland is abandoned allowing shrubs and bushes to regenerate. However, household interviews and census data showed that the rural population number was still increasing while the productivity of the farming activities did not show a significant increase. The observed abandonment of marginal farm and rangeland was, therefore, only made possible through food aid and the import of food from other regions. The results from the Dessaa forest also showed that the forest cover of the area has decreased. While the area ofarable land and <b>built-up</b> <b>surfaces</b> have increased during these years. Population pressure was the most influential factor for the decline in forest cover in the study villages. Distance to <b>built-up</b> <b>surfaces,</b> distance to main roads and rivers, variation in slope, elevation and aspect were significant variables on forest degradation on major part of the study area. Changes in forest policies, have also contributed to the decline in forest cover. The extent to which land use patterns can be optimized to minimize further land degradation and to maximize the incomes generated from farming was examined (chapter 5) in the catchment of the Geba River. An ordinal classification of soil erosion rates and profitability assessments were put in a spatial decision support system in order to generate optimal land use patterns. The profit maximisation scenario showed that in order to generate higher profits, the landscape must be organised in a sort of Von Thünen landscape with concentric rings surrounding the market places. The erosion minimization scenario showed that a concentration of all the arable land in the less erodible places would reduce the average soil erosion rate. The mixed scenarios in which reduction of erosion and increase of profitability were both taken into account showed that the definition of the weights of the performance indicators is of crucial importance. If the generation of total profits is emphasized, the corresponding land use pattern would consist of even more arable land than the present day situation. If soil conservation received more weight the optimal landscape would consist of less arable land but with a higher area-specific profitability. nrpages: 217 status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Infiltration {{derived from}} {{rainfall}} on ground surfaces {{is one of}} the important components in the hydrologic cycle process. Infiltration is a complex process and depends on the conditions of land use, soil type, and slope of the surface, evaporation, and precipitation. Urbanization increases impervious surface areas in a watershed and conveys the surface runoff to the storm sewer system which discharges to watercourses. This results less infiltration and groundwater recharge in <b>built-up</b> areas, higher <b>surface</b> flow velocity, and higher point discharge to the stream which leads to stream erosion and bank stability problems, etc. This paper presents a GIS-based hydrological modeling approach to identification of infiltration zones in an urban watershed.

The studied city ŽSzeged, Hungary. is located on a low and flat flood plain with a population of 160, 000. Data were collected by mobile measurements under different weather conditions between March 1999 and February 2000. The efforts have been focussed on investigating the maximum development of the urban heat island ŽUHI. along an urban cross-section. According to the results, the UHI intensity changed according to season and month, {{as a consequence of the}} prevailing weather conditions. The role of cloudiness and wind speed on the temporal variation of the largest UHI, which represents the increasing effect of Szeged on temperature, is clearly recognized during most of the time in the studied period. The seasonal profiles follow remarkably well the general cross-section of the typical UHI described by Oke ŽOke, T. R., 1987. Boundary Layer Climates. Routledge, London. who defines its characteristic parts as ‘cliff’, ‘plateau’ and ‘peak’. The usefulness of the normalized values in the investigation is proved, the form of the seasonal mean UHI profile is independent of the seasonal climatological conditions, and is determined to a high degree by urban surface factors. As a conclusion, we suggest a modified model describing the metropolitan temperature variable for cities situated in simple geographical conditions: it is equal to the sum of components of the basic climate of the region and of the production of urbanization at the surface, where this last term is a multiplication of weather and urban surface factors...|$|R

Appropriate treatment of stormwater runoff from these impervious surfaces is essential to safeguard the urban water environment. While urban roads have received significant research attention in this regard, roofs have not been well investigated. Key pollutant processes such as build-up on roads and roofs can be different due to the different surface characteristics. This entails different treatment strategies being needed for road and roofs. The research study characterized roof pollutants build-up by differentiating with road surfaces. It was noted that pollutants are more highly concentrated on particles and particularly finer particles {{in the case of}} roof surfaces, compared to road <b>surfaces.</b> Additionally, pollutants <b>built-up</b> on roof <b>surfaces</b> tend to be relatively more variable from one day to another in terms of pollutant loads.

40|$|The loss of soil {{resources}} in Italy is particularly {{evident in the}} vast plain of the Po River Valley, where urbanisation {{has led to a}} progressive depletion of land <b>surface.</b> <b>Built-up</b> areas now cover around 9 %, on average, of the total surface area, but in the most densely inhabited communities, lying mainly along the major artery of the Via Emilia, this figure may exceed 20 %. The trend shows no signs of relenting, above all because of the demand for large surfaces generated by the tertiary sector. The phenomenon thus needs to be carefully controlled, especially as regards land located near the Po River and its main effluents. The soils in these areas have different pedogenetic and micro-morphological characteristics and support particularly demanding agronomic activities; though the levels of agricultural productivity match the highest levels in Europe, management of the land generally entails the maintenance of efficient water regulation networks. In this context there is a pressing need to investigate the dynamics of changes in land use in relation to soil quality, particularly areas that have undergone urban development...|$|R

Urban blocks typically consist of built-up and non built-up areas, with a specific composition and configuration. To characterize the twodimensional structure of urban blocks, next to traditional, landscape ecological metrics, two alternative methods are proposed, describing the alternation between, and the characteristic size of <b>built-up</b> and non-built-up <b>surfaces</b> along a set of radial and contourbased profiles. Urban areas are, of course, also characterized by their third dimension. Therefore, also metrics were developed describing different characteristics of the elevation pattern of built-up areas. A case study was carried out on the Brussels-Capital region. Several vector layers of the large-scale UrbIS database for the region were used to define the blocks, the delineation of individual buildings within each block, {{and the number of}} floors for each building. High-resolution satellite data were used to define the presence of green in non-built areas. A combination of the metrics proposed shows clear potential for describing different types of urban morphology. Yet there are several issues that require further research, such as the relation between different types of urban morphology and urban land use, as well as the potential of additional data (satellite imagery, digital elevation models, socioeconomical data) for improving the distinction between different urban morphologies and/or land-use types. 1...|$|R

Efforts have been concentrated {{on the development of}} the urban heat island (UHI) in its peak development during the diurnal cycle. Tasks included: (1) determination of spatial distribution of mean maximum UHI intensity and some urban <b>surface</b> parameters (<b>built-up</b> and water <b>surface</b> ratios, sky view factor, building height) using the standard Kriging procedure, as well as (2) development of a statistical model in the so-called heating and non-heating seasons using the above mentioned parameters and their areal extensions. In both seasons the spatial distribution of the mean maximum UHI intensity fields had a concentric shape with some local irregularities. The intensity reaches more than 2. 1 [*]°C (heating season) and 3. 1 [*]°C (non-heating season) in the centre of the city. For both seasons statistical model equations were determined by means of stepwise multiple linear regression analysis. As the measured and calculated mean maximum UHI intensity patterns show, there is a clear connection between the spatial distribution of the urban thermal excess and the examined land-use parameters, so these parameters play an important role in the evolution of the strong UHI intensity field. From the above mentioned parameters the sky-view factor and the building height were the most determining factors which are in line with the urban surface energy balance. Therefore in the future, using our model it will be possible to predict mean maximum UHI intensity in other cities, which have land-use features similar to Szeged...|$|R
40|$|The {{growth and}} spread of {{impervious}} surfaces within urbanizing catchment areas pose signiificant {{threats to the}} quality of natural and <b>built-up</b> environments. Impervious <b>surfaces</b> prevent water infiltration into the soil, resulting in increased runoff generation. The Erbil Sub-basin was selected because the impervious cover is increasing rapidly and is affecting the hydrological condition of the watershed. The overall aim {{of this study is to}} examine the impact of urban growth and other changes in land use on runoff response during the study period of 1984 to 2014. The study describes long-term hydrologic responses within the rapidly developing catchment area of Erbil city, in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. Data from six rainfall stations in and around the Erbil Sub-basin were used. A Digital Elevation Model (DEM) was also used to extract the distribution of the drainage network. Historical levels of urban growth and the corresponding impervious areas, as well as land use/land cover changes were mapped from 1984 to 2014 using a temporal satellite image (Landsat) to determine land use/land cover changes. Land use/land cover was combined with a hydrological model (SCS-CN) to estimate the volume of runoff from the watershed. The study indicates that the urbanization of the watershed has increased the impervious land cover by 71 % for the period from 1984 to 2004 and by 51 % from 2004 to 2014. The volume of runoff was 85 % higher in 2014 as compared to 1984 due to the increase in the impervious surface area; this is attributed to urban growth. The study also points out that the slope of the watershed in the Erbil sub-basin should be taken into account in surface runoff estimation as the upstream part of the watershed has a high gradient and the land is almost barren with very little vegetation cover; this causes an increase in the velocity of the flow and increases the risk of flooding in Erbil city...|$|R

In each primer, PAM or CAM were be added at concentrations of 10, 20, 40 or 60 mass%. Degree of conversion (DC) of the primers was evaluated by infrared spectroscopy (n= 5). For the BS test, sintered yttria-stabilized zirconia blocks (Zircon-CAD, Angelus) were used.

In the control group, adhesion of the cylinders {{will be carried out}} without using primer. In half the number of specimens in each group, the BS test was carried out after 24 h on a mechanical testing machine. In order to simulate aging and evaluate the stability of the zirconia bonds, the other half the number of specimens was submitted to 3000 thermal cycles before the BS test. The failure modes were classified under a 40 ?? magnification. DC data were submitted to one-way ANOVA for each monomer; BS data were submitted to two-way ANOVA for each storage condition. The Student-Newman-Keuls post-hoc test was used. BS comparison between 24 h and after thermalcycling was carried out using t-tests. (Non-) linear regression analyses were used to investigate the relationship between acidic monomer concentration and DC or BS (&# 945;= 0. 05 for all analyses). Increase in acidic monomers concentration was associated with a linear decrease in DC. The BS for PAM-based primers was higher than CAM-based materials for all groups except 10 % at 24 h. For PAM, the primer with 40 % of acidic monomers yielded higher BS than all the other primers, either at 24 h or after thermalcycling. For CAM, the BS results were at 24 h were 10 % > 60 % > 40 % > 20 %, while after thermalcycling the primer with 60 % of acidic monomers generally showed higher BS. All PAM groups except 10 % showed lower BS after the thermal cycles, while 10 % was the only concentration that showed lower BS after thermalcycling for CAM. Increased PAM concentration had a significant relationship with the zirconia bonds according to a peak model, while increase in CAM content had a polynomial inverse relationship. Regression models after thermalcycling were not significant. The only group that showed mixed failures was PAM 40 %, while the other groups failed adhesively. In conclusion, both the acidic monomer type and concentration have a significant role on the adhesion to zirconia.
