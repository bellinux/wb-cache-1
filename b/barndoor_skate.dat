A lack of basic life history information, however, has hampered an accurate assessment and management of north Atlantic populations. In an attempt to fill this void, information was collected from 2 310 specimens caught during commercial sea scallop dredging in the southern section of Georges Bank Closed Area II. Eighty-seven fish were determined to be mature from a visual inspection of reproductive tracts and the allometric growth of claspers, oviducal glands and developing ova. Sexual dimorphism was apparent in length at 50 % maturity with females maturing at 116. 3 cm and males at 107. 9 cm. A preliminary analysis of 118 vertebrae indicates faster growth (k = 0. 14 to 0. 18) and younger female maturation (6. 5 to 7. 2 yr) than previously believed. Thus, resilience of the <b>barndoor</b> <b>skate</b> to overfishing may be higher than recently assumed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. —In 1998, the <b>barndoor</b> <b>skate</b> Dipturus laevis was {{reported}} to have been locally extirpated in parts of its northern range and to be potentially on the brink of extinction. Managers were faced with assessing the species with virtually no information other than a limited number of individuals observed in annual groundfish surveys. Since that time, a number of the primary life history parameters have been estimated, but the population dynamics of the species remain largely unexplored. In this study, we use information from the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) annual groundfish surveys to investigate two critical components of <b>barndoor</b> <b>skate</b> population dynamics: the relationship of recruitment to spawner abundance and the maximum population growth rate. A strong stock–recruitment relationship was found in the fall survey data, suggesting that recruitment is closely tied to spawner abundance. The Ricker and Beverton–Holt stock–recruit models were fitted to the survey data, and estimates of the slope at the origin was generated. These parameters provided an estimate of the maximum annual reproductive rate, which was then converted to an estimate of the instantaneous maximum population growth rate of 0. 37 – 0. 38 per year. A second analysis was also conducted using a Leslie matrix and data from the NMFS survey. Observed rates of population change were used to estimate early life history parameters and incorporate density dependence into the density-independent framework of a Leslie matrix demographic model. From this method, the instantaneous maximum populatio...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2006 In the past, sharks, skates and ray {{species have}} mainly {{occurred}} in incidental fisheries. Now they {{are increasingly being}} directly targeted due to the depleted status of traditionally targeted species. The life history characteristics of many elasmobranch species make them more sensitive to high rates of fishing mortality. The combination of these factors {{has resulted in the}} known local depletion of several elasmobranch species; including the <b>barndoor</b> <b>skate,</b> Raja laevis, of the Northwest Atlantic and the common skate, Raja batis, of Irish Sea. The longnose skate, Raja rhina, occurs commonly as incidental catch in trawl fisheries off the coast of California, Oregon and Washington. Commercial landings of skates, including R. rhina, have increased dramatically along the U. S. West coast. The objectives of this study have been to calculate accurate growth and maturity parameters for Raja rhina in order that the vulnerability of this species to fishing mortality can be assessed.
