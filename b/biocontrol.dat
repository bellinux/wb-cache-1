5|$|Many {{insects are}} {{considered}} pests by humans. Insects commonly regarded as pests include {{those that are}} parasitic (e.g. lice, bed bugs), transmit diseases (mosquitoes, flies), damage structures (termites), or destroy agricultural goods (locusts, weevils). Many entomologists are involved in various forms of pest control, as in research for companies to produce insecticides, but increasingly rely on methods of biological pest control, or <b>biocontrol.</b> <b>Biocontrol</b> uses one organism to reduce the population density of another organism — the pest — and is considered {{a key element of}} integrated pest management.|$|E
5|$|The {{cattle egret}} {{is a popular}} bird with cattle ranchers for its {{perceived}} role as a <b>biocontrol</b> of cattle parasites such as ticks and flies. A study in Australia found that cattle egrets {{reduced the number of}} flies that bothered cattle by pecking them directly off the skin. It was the benefit to stock that prompted ranchers and the Hawaiian Board of Agriculture and Forestry to release the species in Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|The organisms which parasitize fungi {{are known}} as mycoparasitic organisms. Certain species of the Pythium genus, which are oomycetes, have {{potential}} as <b>biocontrol</b> agents against certain fungi. Fungi can also act as mycoparasites or antagonists of other fungi, such as Hypomyces chrysospermus, which grows on bolete mushrooms.|$|E
5|$|Bivalves {{have long}} {{been a part of}} the diet of coastal and {{riparian}} human populations. Oysters were cultured in ponds by the Romans, and mariculture has more recently become an important source of bivalves for food. Modern knowledge of molluscan reproductive cycles has led to the development of hatcheries and new culture techniques. A better understanding of the potential hazards of eating raw or undercooked shellfish has led to improved storage and processing. Pearl oysters (the common name of two very different families in salt water and fresh water) are the most common source of natural pearls. The shells of bivalves are used in craftwork, and the manufacture of jewellery and buttons. Bivalves have also been used in the <b>biocontrol</b> of pollution.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} small sizes and {{high rates of}} reproduction, thrips are {{difficult}} to control using classical biological control. Suitable predators must be small and slender enough to penetrate the crevices where thrips hide while feeding, and they must also prey extensively on eggs and larvae to be effective. Only two families of parasitoid Hymenoptera parasitize eggs and larvae, the Eulophidae and the Trichogrammatidae. Other <b>biocontrol</b> agents of adults and larvae include anthocorid bugs of genus Orius, and phytoseiid mites. Biological insecticides such as the fungi Beauveria bassiana and Verticillium lecanii can kill thrips at all life-cycle stages. Insecticidal soap spray is effective against thrips. It is commercially available or can be made of certain types of household soap. Scientists in Japan report that significant reductions in larva and adult melon thrips occur when plants are illuminated with red light.|$|E
5|$|A {{potential}} {{obstacle to}} the adoption of biological pest control measures is growers sticking to the familiar use of pesticides. However, pesticides have a variety of undesired effects, including the development of resistance among pests, and the destruction of natural enemies; these may in turn enable outbreaks of pests of other species than the ones originally targeted, and on crops at a distance from those treated with pesticides. One method of increasing grower adoption of <b>biocontrol</b> methods involves letting them learn by doing, for example showing them simple field experiments, enabling them to observe the live predation of pests, or demonstrations of parasitised pests. In the Philippines, early season sprays against leaf folder caterpillars were common practice, but growers were asked to follow a 'rule of thumb' of not spraying against leaf folders for the first 30 days after transplanting; participation in this resulted in a reduction of insecticide use by 1/3 and a change in grower perception of insecticide use.|$|E

25|$|Pest control {{includes}} {{the management of}} weeds, insects, mites, and diseases. Chemical (pesticides), biological (<b>biocontrol),</b> mechanical (tillage), and cultural practices are used. Cultural practices include crop rotation, culling, cover crops, intercropping, composting, avoidance, and resistance. Integrated pest management attempts to use all of these methods to keep pest populations below the number which would cause economic loss, and recommends pesticides as a last resort.|$|E
25|$|Worldwide {{routes of}} {{propagation}} of H. axyridis were described with genetic markers in 2010. The populations in {{eastern and western}} North America originated from two independent introductions from the native range. The South American and African populations both originated independently from eastern North America. The European population also originated from eastern North America, but with substantial genetic admixture with individuals of the European <b>biocontrol</b> strain (estimated at about 40%).|$|E
25|$|Exserohilum rostratumis being {{incorporated}} in technologies for controlling Cyperus iria a common weed in the rice fields of Southeast Asia. A study determined that Exserohilum rostratum {{has the potential}} to act as a <b>biocontrol</b> agent incorporated with bentazone to control rice field weeds. This species has also been proposed as an antimalarial agent. E. rostratum was found to be a fungal strain endophytic in the plant species Stemona. Monocerin and 11-hydroxymonocerin were isolated from these cultures, which have applications in antimalarial drugs.|$|E
25|$|There {{are various}} parasites and predators of widow spiders in North America, though {{apparently}} {{none of these}} have ever been evaluated in terms of augmentation programs for improved <b>biocontrol.</b> Parasites of the egg sacs include the flightless scelionid wasp Baeus latrodecti, {{and members of the}} chloropid fly genus Pseudogaurax. Predators of the adult spiders include a few wasps, most notably the blue mud dauber, Chalybion californicum, and the spider wasp Tastiotenia festiva. Other species including Mantis or Centipede also will occasionally and opportunistically take widows as prey, but the preceding all exhibit some significant specific preference for Latrodectus.|$|E
25|$|Rotations {{of plants}} with nematode-resistant species or {{varieties}} is one means of managing parasitic nematode infestations. For example, marigolds, grown over {{one or more}} seasons (the effect is cumulative), {{can be used to}} control nematodes. Another is treatment with natural antagonists such as the fungus Gliocladium roseum. Chitosan, a natural <b>biocontrol,</b> elicits plant defense responses to destroy parasitic cyst nematodes on roots of soybean, corn, sugar beet, potato, and tomato crops without harming beneficial nematodes in the soil. Soil steaming is an efficient method to kill nematodes before planting a crop, but indiscriminately eliminates both harmful and beneficial soil fauna.|$|E
25|$|Tarebia granifera {{have been}} {{associated}} with the disappearance of two indigenous benthic gastropod species from rivers in Puerto Rico and have displaced the vegetation-associated pulmonate Biomphalaria glabrata from streams and ponds on several Caribbean islands. Although the responsible mechanism is not understood, this has led to suggestions that it could be useful as a <b>biocontrol</b> agent in snail control operations within integrated schistosomiasis control programmes. They probably also compete for space and resources (e.g. food) with indigenous infaunal and epifaunal invertebrates, especially where its densities are high. Under such conditions it is likely to alter the structure and biodiversity of the entire benthic communities of invaded habitats and perhaps the vegetation-associated communities as well.|$|E
25|$|H. axyridis is {{native to}} eastern Asia from central Siberia, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan in the west, through Russia south to the Himalayas and east to the Pacific coast and Japan, {{including}} Korea, Mongolia, China, and Taiwan. As a voracious predator, it {{was identified as a}} <b>biocontrol</b> agent for aphids and scale insects. Consequently, it has been introduced into greenhouses, crop fields, and gardens in many countries, including the United States and parts of Europe. The species is now established in the United States, Canada, Argentina, Brazil, Italy, the United Kingdom, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, France, Germany, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Poland, and South Africa.|$|E
25|$|Fungal {{resistance}} to herbivores represents an environmentally sustainable alternative to pesticides that has experienced reasonable success in agricultural applications. The organic farming industry has embraced mycorrhizal symbionts as one tool for improving yields and protecting plants from damage. Infected crops of soybean, ribwort plantain, cabbage, banana, coffee bean plant and tomato all show markedly {{lower rates of}} herbivore damage compared to uninfected plants. Endophytic fungi show great promise {{as a means of}} indirect <b>biocontrol</b> in large-scale agricultural applications. The potential for biotechnology to improve crop populations through inoculation with modified fungal strains could reduce toxicity to livestock and improve yields of human-consumed foods. The endophyte, either with detrimental genes removed or beneficial new genes added, is used as a surrogate host to transform the crops genetically. An endophyte of ryegrass has been genetically transformed in this way and used successfully to deter herbivores.|$|E

2500|$|International {{exploration}} {{for potential}} <b>biocontrol</b> agents is aided by {{agencies such as}} the European Biological Control Laboratory, the United States Department of Agriculture/Agricultural Research Service (USDA/ARS), the Commonwealth Institute of Biological Control, and the International Organization for Biological Control of Noxious Plants and Animals. [...] In order to prevent agricultural pollution, quarantine and extensive research on the organism’s potential efficacy and ecological impacts are required prior to introduction. If approved, attempts are made to colonize and disperse the <b>biocontrol</b> agent in appropriate agricultural settings. Continual evaluations on their efficacy are conducted.|$|E
2500|$|The use of {{biological}} pest control agents, or using predators, parasitoids, parasites, and pathogens to control agricultural pests, {{has the potential}} to reduce agricultural pollution associated with other pest control techniques, such as pesticide use. The merits of introducing non-native <b>biocontrol</b> agents have been widely debated, however. Once released, the introduction of a <b>biocontrol</b> agent can be irreversible. Potential ecological issues could include the dispersal from agricultural habitats into natural environments, and host-switching or adapting to utilize a native species. In addition, predicting the interaction outcomes in complex ecosystems and potential ecological impacts prior to release can be difficult. One example of a <b>biocontrol</b> program that resulted in ecological damage occurred in North America, where a parasitoid of butterflies was introduced to control gypsy moth and browntail moth. [...] This parasitoid is capable of utilizing many butterfly host species, and likely resulted in the decline and extirpation of several native silk moth species.|$|E
2500|$|Purpureocillium is a fungal genus in the Ophiocordycipitaceae family. The genus now {{contains}} 12 {{species with}} a representative species Purpureocillium lilacinum, a common saprobic, filamentous fungus. It has been isolated {{from a wide}} range of habitats, including cultivated and uncultivated soils, forests, grassland, deserts, estuarine sediments and sewage sludge, and insects. It has also been found in nematode eggs, and occasionally from females of root-knot and cyst nematodes. In addition, it has frequently been detected in the rhizosphere of many crops. The species can grow at a wide range of temperatures – from [...] for a few isolates, with optimal growth in the range [...] It also has a wide pH tolerance and can grow on a variety of substrates. P.lilacinum has shown promising results for use as a <b>biocontrol</b> agent to control the growth of destructive root-knot nematodes.|$|E
2500|$|Because {{grass grub}} build up large colonies in the soil, disease can spread quickly and be devastating to the population, {{the most common}} disease of the New Zealand Grass Grub is Amber Disease. Amber Disease is a chronic {{infection}} of the stomach of grass grub larvae, and is caused by two strains of bacteria, Serratia entomophila and Serratia proteamaculans. The bacteria Serratia entomophila and is available for purchase commercially as a <b>biocontrol</b> agent. Once these pathogenic bacteria have been ingested, the infected larvae stop eating within 2–5 days, and gain an amber colouring due to the stomach emptying, and the levels of major digestive enzymes (trypsin and chymotrypsin) in the mid-gut decreasing. However, the infected larvae won’t die for another 1–3 months after becoming infected. Amber disease can carry over into following generations as it is applied at a subsurface level of soil. It was first isolated in Mid Canterbury, New Zealand in 1981 ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{experiment}} in 2006, P. clarus showed promise for controlling the fourlined plant bug, Poecilocapsus lineatus, which severely damages sweet basil, Ocimum basilicum, a herb commercially grown in greenhouses. The potential advantages of P. clarus for <b>biocontrol</b> include that the spider prefers to stay overnight in the same nest, detects prey visually from a distance, takes {{a wide range of}} prey, can both wait for prey and hunt actively, learns to recognize particular prey, and can be reared in individual cages. Although cannibalism is likely to prevent mass rearing of P. clarus, it is possible to collect egg sacs or spiders and move them to where they are needed. In the breeding season, one mated [...] female can lay well over 100eggs per sac, many females lay more than one egg sac, and it is easy to recognize the egg sacs. Juvenile and adult jumping spiders can be collected via sweep netting or by providing good sites for nests, even in plumber's tubing placed in old fields.|$|E
