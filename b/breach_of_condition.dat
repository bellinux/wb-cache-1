2500|$|In the United Kingdom, {{breach of}} {{contract}} is defined in the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 as: [...] non-performance, [...] poor performance, [...] part-performance, or [...] performance which is substantially different from what was reasonably expected. [...] Innocent parties may repudiate (cancel) the contract only for a major breach (<b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>condition),</b> but they may always recover compensatory damages, provided that the breach has caused foreseeable loss.|$|E
5000|$|The Hong Kong Fir {{decision}} {{was met with}} some alarm in the shipping world, where certainty is crucial. The problem was the delay element; one had to [...] "wait and see" [...] {{the effect of the}} breach. The enormous costs involved in chartering mean that parties cannot afford to leisurely loiter, whilst pondering the consequences of the breach. Soon after, in The Mihalis Angelos 1971 1 QB 164, it was held the impossibility of the shipowner to meet the [...] "expected ready to load" [...] date, ipso facto entitled the charterer to repudiate for anticipatory <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>condition.</b>|$|E
50|$|An {{interpretation}} of Condition 4 could include a complete absence in any British-controlled media of {{any reference to}} the Libyan hostage situation for fear that any such reference might be construed by the Libyan authorities as a <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>Condition</b> 4. In accordance with this interpretation, there has been almost no reference to the hostage situation in literature {{since the time of}} the release. Most references that state the history of Libya at the time make reference to the murder of WPC Fletcher and then make no reference whatsoever to the hostage situation, skipping instead to the bombing of Libya by the Americans in 1986.|$|E

50|$|The PBC {{said that}} between 1995 and 2000, more than 70% of 11,466 {{offenders}} released on full parole completed their sentence successfully while about 16% had their parole revoked for <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>conditions</b> and 12.5% had their parole revoked {{as a result}} of committing a new offense.|$|R
50|$|In addition, the PBC {{noted that}} in the same five-year period, over 16,000 prisoners were {{released}} for day parole and that of these, nearly 83% were completed successfully, 12% had their parole revoked for <b>breaches</b> <b>of</b> <b>conditions,</b> and only 5.7% were revoked for committing new offenses.|$|R
5000|$|The {{government}} encourages victim {{participation in}} the investigation of traffickers, although in practice many are reluctant to do so. Women who agree to act as witnesses for the prosecution are granted immunity and allowed to return to their home country without being charged for illegal entry or <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>condition</b> of stay. The Hong Kong Police has special units to provide protection for victims and witnesses. Given the low number of documented trafficking victims, Hong Kong authorities refer adult victims to existing social service programs at six government subsidized NGO shelters. Under the Protection of Children and Juveniles Ordinance, child victims of trafficking may be admitted to three refuge centers, one of which is operated by an NGO, with the other two operated by the Social Welfare Department. While at the shelters, victims are provided with government-sponsored assistance that includes financial and legal assistance and counseling and psychological support.|$|E
50|$|Denning LJ {{held that}} Mr Leaf was barred because {{too much time}} had lapsed. He held that {{in the event of}} lapse of too much time between the making of the {{contract}} and the decision to rescind, the right to rescind is lost. He held there was a mistake {{about the quality of the}} subject matter because both parties believed the picture to be a Constable, and that mistake was fundamental. But it was not enough to void the contract, because there was no mistake about the essential subject matter (a painting). The painter's identity was a term of the contract, which could either be classified as a condition (breach of which allows termination of the contract) or a warranty (which allows damages only). Here the painter's identity was a condition, but after hanging it in one's house for five years it is far too late to reject the painting for <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>condition.</b>|$|E
50|$|On 13 December 2010, Ofcom {{opened an}} {{investigation}} {{to consider a}} complaint submitted by Virgin Media {{in relation to the}} terms of wholesale supply by Sky to Virgin of Sky Sports 1 and Sky Sports 2 HD, namely that it is calculated on a per-device basis. On 24 February 2011, Ofcom issued a Draft Decision to the parties and Virgin withdrew its complaint on 16 March 2011, Ofcom therefore closed the case. On 13 December 2010, Ofcom also opened an investigation to consider a complaint submitted by BT against Sky concerning the requirement on BT to provide Sky with information on BT Visions total number of pay subscribers and total number of customers. On 29 March 2011, Ofcom concluded its assessment of BT's complaint, issuing a decision to give a direction to Sky in respect of compliance with Condition 14A of each of the Television Licensable Content Service licences for Sky Sports 1 and Sky Sports 2. The direction states that a clause in Sky's agreement for the wholesale supply of Sky Sports 1 and Sky Sports 2 to BT, requiring BT to provide Sky with BT Vision's total number of pay subscribers and total number of customers is in <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>Condition</b> 14A(1)(d) and required that clause to be removed forthwith.|$|E
50|$|Conditions are {{terms that}} go to the very root <b>of</b> a contract. <b>Breach</b> <b>of</b> a <b>condition</b> will entitle the {{innocent}} party to terminate the contract.

40|$|Breach of land {{condition}} {{is an issue}} that often occurs and should be given attention. The breach of condition’s issue not only affects the authority, but indirect give negative impact on the local and the environment. Breach of conditions caused by various factors, one of the factors is the difference in law between the State Authority (SA) and the Local Authority (LA) as parties responsible for the land development. This research is conducted to help both authorities, the SA and LA in resolving cases involving conflict of laws. Therefore, this study will be conducted to identify the provisions of the legislation relating to the case breach of conditions, study the actions taken by SA and LA, and study the application of section 108, National Land Code (NLC) 1965 for cases breach of land condition that involving difference of laws. To achieve these three objectives, methods of collecting data obtained from primary sources and secondary sources. Primary data from interviews were analyzed to obtain the final result. Based on the findings, action taken by the SA and LA is different according to the circumstances of the case and the application of section 108 is applicable in an action taken by LA. The final results and the suggestions made hopefully can benefit all the parties involved in managing cases of <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>condition</b> of land that involving two different agencies...|$|E
40|$|Comparative {{research}} related to any aspect of the process <b>of</b> <b>breach</b> in either the pre-trial, sentencing or release phases is relatively rare. Comparative studies of decision making {{in the specific context}} <b>of</b> <b>breach</b> process are particularly lacking. One reason for the dearth of research in this area is the many challenges presented by comparative research across different jurisdictions. This article focuses on the development of a vignette methodology to explore the decision-making aspect <b>of</b> the <b>breach</b> process from a comparative perspective across a number of different European jurisdictions. The vignettes are designed to explore the decision-making aspects of two different types <b>of</b> <b>breach</b> process – the process <b>of</b> <b>breach</b> that follows on from a <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> early release from prison and the process that follows a <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>conditions</b> attached to the completion of an unpaid work order. The article begins by contextualizing the research in debates about the relationship between compliance, legitimacy and rising prison populations. It critically examines the nature of vignette methodology and then discusses the specific challenges of using vignettes in comparative research as well as the development, piloting and evaluation of the decision-making vignettes in focus. We conclude by discussing some of the challenges we faced and particularly our challenge in terms of the development of the methodology – enhancing the comparability of the findings...|$|R

40|$|This article {{considers}} the legal validity of so-called termination for convenience clauses, which allow {{at least one}} party to the contract to terminate the contract without cause. Such rights are in contrast to more traditional approaches to contractual termination, which distinguished between <b>breaches</b> <b>of</b> <b>condition</b> and <b>breaches</b> <b>of</b> warranty, allowing termination only for the former. Specifically, it will be asked whether such termination for convenience clauses are consistent with requirements of good faith in contracting, the existence of which is itself contentious. As a result, {{it will be necessary}} to consider the current state of the law in Australia and elsewhere in relation to the extent to which good faith is and should be a feature of contracting. ...|$|R

The PAC also criticised the proportion of Monitor’s budget spent on external consultants (£9 million of Monitor's £48 million budget in 2013-14) and found that “some NHS foundation trusts had been allowed to struggle for far too long in <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> their regulatory <b>conditions.</b> It has taken Monitor too long to help trusts in difficulty to improve, with three trusts having been in <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> their regulatory <b>conditions</b> since 2009”.
