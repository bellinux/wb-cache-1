6000|$|... "We haven't {{crippled}} a horse yet," [...] put in Emett hopefully. Don led {{the pack}} and us down the ridge, out of the pines into the sage.

60|$|It was springtime {{among the}} {{mountains}} which, glistening coldly white with mantles of eternal snow, towered above the deep-sunk valley, when, one morning, Geoffrey Thurston limped painfully {{out of a}} redwood forest of British Columbia. The boom of a hidden river set the pine sprays quivering. A <b>blue</b> <b>grouse</b> was drumming deliriously {{on the top of}} a stately fir, and the morning sun drew clean, healing odors from balsam and cedar.|$|E
60|$|It was {{now getting}} {{on into the}} {{afternoon}} and Frank felt sorry {{that they had not}} eaten the lunch Miss Oliver had prepared for them before they left the sloop. It was very hot, and very still, except when now and then the drumming of a <b>blue</b> <b>grouse</b> came sharply out of the shadows. By and by, however, the wood became a little thinner, and Harry pointed toward an opening between the trees.|$|E
60|$|We {{talked of}} birds and fishes, and of many other things, while once a big <b>blue</b> <b>grouse</b> perched on a fir bough and looked down fearlessly within reach of her, though when the {{wrinkles}} of pain had vanished Alice seemed happy to sit still in the warm sunshine speaking of nothing at all. Still, even in the silence, the bond of friendship between us was drawn tighter than it ever had been, and I knew that I felt better and stronger for my cousin's company.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'd 'most as {{soon have}} an ax. Then I {{could make a}} shelter that would, anyway, keep us {{comfortable}} enough, and when I'd cut you a good layer of spruce twigs you wouldn't want a better bed. If I'd a rifle I might get a <b>blue</b> <b>grouse</b> for supper. Still"--and he laughed--"as you say, we haven't got them, and we couldn't do any cooking without matches.

60|$|In the {{meanwhile}} the twigs he lay upon were pleasantly soft, {{and it was}} cool and peaceful in the lengthening shadow of the firs. There was a curious rhythmic drumming sound which he found most soothing and which he afterward learned was made by a <b>blue</b> <b>grouse</b> not far away. The pungent smell of withering fir and cedar sprays in the slashing dulled his senses, until at last his troubles seemed to melt away and he fancied that {{he was back in}} Boston where nobody had ever required him to heave ponderous logs upon one another.|$|E
60|$|Even {{when the}} great peaks were rolled in tempest cloud, the snow fell but lightly among the Quatomac pines. Bright {{sunlight}} shone on them for weeks together, and it was but seldom a cold blast whipped the still, blue lake where {{the shadows of the}} cedars that distilled ambrosial essences lay asleep. There were deer and <b>blue</b> <b>grouse</b> in the woods, salmon in the river, and big trout in the lake; and the deleterious whisky purveyed at the nearest settlement was not inordinately dear. It had, however, dawned on Brooke by degrees that there were many things he could not find at Quatomac which men of his upbringing hold necessary.|$|E
60|$|I {{set forth}} on a hunt for game. Even if {{the sound of}} a shot betrayed my {{whereabouts}} I should have to abide by it, for I had to eat. Stepping softly along, I glanced about me with sharp eyes. Deer trails were thick. The bottom of this canyon was very wide, and grew wider as I proceeded. Then the pines once more became large and thrifty. I judged I had come down the mountain, perhaps a couple of thousand feet below the camp in the gorge. I flushed many of the big <b>blue</b> <b>grouse,</b> and I saw numerous coyotes, a fox, and a large brown beast which moved swiftly into a thicket. It was enough to make my heart rise in my throat. To dream of hunting bears was something vastly different from meeting one in a lonely canyon.|$|E
60|$|With that he spurred {{into the}} thicket. Bo went next and Helen followed. The willows dragged at her {{so hard that}} {{she was unable to}} watch Roy, and the result was that a low-sweeping branch of a tree knocked her hard on the head. It hurt and startled her, and roused her mettle. Roy was keeping to the easy trot that covered ground so well, and he led up a slope to the open pine forest. Here the ride for several miles was straight, level, and open. Helen liked the forest to-day. It was brown and green, with patches of gold where the sun struck. She saw her first bird--big <b>blue</b> <b>grouse</b> that whirred up from under her horse, and little {{checkered}} gray quail that appeared awkward on the wing. Several times Roy pointed out deer flashing gray across some forest aisle, and often when he pointed Helen was not quick enough to see.|$|E
60|$|We {{went back}} to the point, and thought we would wait a little while to see if the trout would begin to rise. But they did not. A storm began to mutter and boom along the battlements. Great gray clouds {{obscured}} the peaks, and at length the rain came. It was cold and cutting. We sought the shelter of spruces for a while, and waited. After an hour it cleared somewhat, and R.C. caught a fine one-pound cutthroat, all green and silver, with only two slashes of red along under the gills. Then another storm threatened. Before we got ready to leave for camp the rain began again to fall, and we looked for a wetting. It was raining hard when we rode into the woods and very cold. The spruces were dripping. But we soon got warm from hard riding up steep slopes. After an hour the rain ceased, the sun came out, and from the open places high up we could see a great green void of spruce, and beyond, boundless black ranges, running off to dim horizon. We flushed a big <b>blue</b> <b>grouse</b> with a brood of little ones, and at length another big one.|$|E
60|$|By {{this time}} the sun shone warm, and the canyon was delightful. I roamed around, sat on sunny stones, and lay {{in the shade of}} pines. Deer browsed in the glades. When they winded or saw me they would stand erect, shoot up their long cars, and then leisurely lope away. Coyotes trotted out of {{thickets}} and watched me suspiciously. I could have shot several, but deemed it wise to be saving of my ammunition. Once I heard a low drumming. I could not imagine what made it. Then a big <b>blue</b> <b>grouse</b> strutted out of a patch of bushes. He spread his wings and tail and neck feathers, after the fashion of a turkey-gobbler. It was a flap or shake of his wings that produced the drumming. I wondered if he intended, by his actions, to frighten me away from his mate's nest. So I went toward him, and got very close before he flew. I caught sight of his mate in the bushes, and, as I had supposed, she was on a nest. Though wanting to see her eggs or young ones, I resisted the temptation, for I was afraid if I went nearer she might abandon her nest, as some mother birds do.|$|E
6000|$|The valleys {{were filled}} with freshness, {{and the air was}} balmy with scents, while every bird and beast rejoiced with the vigor of the spring. Now and then a <b>blue</b> <b>grouse</b> broke out {{drumming}} from the summit of a stately fir, white-headed eagles and fish-hawks wheeled screaming above the frothing shallows on slanted wing, and silently, like flitting shadows, the little wood-deer leaped across the trail, or amid a crash of undergrowth a startled black bear charged in blind panic through the dim recesses of the bush. Once, too, with a snarl, a panther sprang out from a thicket, and Calvert's rifle flashed; but the only result was that Cæsar tried to rear upright. With fear I clutched at his rein, and it was a pretty sight to see the big, rough-coated horse settle down as if ashamed of his fright when the fair rider spoke soothingly to him. All dumb creatures took kindly to Grace, and, though Cæsar could show a very pretty temper in ungentle hands, he yielded to the caressing touch of her soft fingers. Then he turned his eyes upon me with a look that seemed an apology for dividing his allegiance, while Grace smiled under lowered lashes, as though she did not wish to meet my gaze. It was a trifling incident, but inwardly I thanked the good horse for it. Later, when we came up out of a roaring ford, through which I carefully led Cæsar, with the stream boiling about my waist, into a dim avenue, she looked down at me as she said: ...|$|E
