50|$|Frame {{aggregation}} is {{a process}} of packing multiple MSDUs or MPDUs together to reduce the overheads and average them over multiple frames, thereby increasing the user level data rate. A-MPDU aggregation requires the use of <b>block</b> <b>acknowledgement</b> or BlockAck, which was introduced in 802.11e and has been optimized in 802.11n.|$|R
50|$|<b>Block</b> <b>acknowledgement</b> {{consist of}} a setup and {{tear-down}} phases. In the setup phase, capability information such as buffer size and BA policy are negotiated with the receiver.

50|$|MPDU {{aggregation}} also collects Ethernet frames to {{be transmitted}} {{to a single}} destination, but it wraps each frame in an 802.11n MAC header.

In addition, this achieves a reduction of N(N– 1) computational operators.

40|$|Abstract — Optimisation of IEEE 802. 11 e MAC {{protocol}} {{performance can}} be performed by modifying several parameters left open in the standard, like buffer size and acknowledgement policies. In this work, an event driven simulator was developed, and {{a comparison of the}} results between the case of standalone services and several services supported simultaneously was addressed. With only a single service, higher values for the goodput are obtained for video and background (BK) traffics, while the lowest is found for the voice application. The number of supported users is higher for voice. With mixtures of traffic, when the number of station is small the goodput is lower for voice. However, for higher number of station, the lowest values of the goodput occur for background traffic. By using the <b>Block</b> <b>Acknowledgement</b> (ACK) procedure, for video and BK traffics, the capacity is improved when the number of station is equal or higher than 16 and 12, respectively. From a detailed analysis of the video application, a reduction of more than 40 % was achieved in the delay...|$|R
40|$|FDG-PET in a {{myocardial}} tuberculoma An 88 -year-old {{woman was}} admitted for syncope and bradycardia. She complained of recent fatigue and weight loss. After insertion of a pacemaker device, the clinical course was complicated by fever and a seizure. Eventually, {{we found that}} a multivisceral culture-positive tuberculous reactivation was likely to account for these symptoms. Radiological workup including 18 -fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) yielded a myocardial tuberculoma (Figure 1). Myocardial involve-ment is rare compared with the classical pericarditis in disseminated tuberculosis [1], but it may have specific pre-sentations like syncope, palpitations or cardiac failure. To diagnose disseminated tuberculosis, FDG-PET can be useful when culture or histopathology is difficult or impossible [2]. It is a promising technique for therapeutic monitoring, as it may guide early interventions [3]. The patient was treated medically with antituberculous therapy for 12 months.

40|$|Abstract—A {{fundamental}} problem in 802. 11 wireless networks is to accurately {{determine the cause}} of packet losses. This becomes increasingly important as wireless data rates scale to Gbps, where lack of loss differentiation leads to higher loss in throughput. Recent and upcoming high-speed WLAN standards, such as 802. 11 n and 802. 11 ac, use frame aggregation and <b>block</b> <b>acknowledgements</b> for achieving efficient communication. This paper presents BLMon, a framework for loss differentiation, that uses loss patterns within aggregate frames and aggregate frame retries to achieve accurate and low overhead loss differentiation. Towards this end, we carry out a detailed measurement study on a real testbed to ascertain the differences in loss patterns due to noise, collisions, and hidden nodes. We then devise metrics to quantitatively capture these differences. Finally, we design BLMon, which collectively uses these metrics to infer the cause of loss without requiring any out-of-band communication, protocol changes, or customized hardware support. BLMon can be readily deployed on commodity devices using only driver-level changes at the sender-side. We implement BLMon in the ath 9 k driver and using real testbed experiments, show that it can provide up to 5 improvement in throughput. I...|$|R

40|$|IEEE 802. 11 n {{networks}} {{are widely used}} in home and corporate network environments because they offer high-speed wireless Internet access at relatively low-cost. The 802. 11 n standard introduced several key features including <b>Block</b> <b>acknowledgement</b> (ACK) and reverse direction (RD) data transmission for enhanced system performance. An in-depth study of 802. 11 n system capacity for Block ACK mechanisms (both protected and unprotected) and RD data flows is required to assist optimum planning and design of such systems {{in view of the}} limited wireless channel capacity. In this paper we study the interdependencies of Block ACK and RD mechanisms using a discrete bi-directional Markov chain model under non-saturated traffic loads. We present a mathematical model to derive throughput, delay, and packet loss probability for both protected and unprotected Block ACKs under varying loads. We validate the model using MATLAB based numerical studies. Results obtained show that the combined effect of protected Block ACK and RD flows has a positive impact on system performance. However, unprotected Block ACK wastes transmission opportunity (TXOP) especially in collisions and therefore degrades the system performance. Our findings reported in this paper provide some insights into the performance of 802. 11 n with respect to Block ACK and RD methods. This study may help network researchers and engineers in their contribution to the development of next generation wireless LANs such as IEEE 802. 11 ac...|$|R

40|$|Since the {{inception}} of Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) in the year 1997, it has tremendously grown {{in the last few}} years. IEEE 802. 11 is popularly known as WLAN. To provide the last mile wireless broadband connectivity to users, IEEE 802. 11 is enriched with IEEE 802. 11 a, IEEE 802. 11 b and IEEE 802. 11 g. More recently, IEEE 802. 11 n, IEEE 802. 11 ac and IEEE 802. 11 ad are introduced with enhancements to the physical (PHY) layer and medium access control (MAC) sublayer to provide much higher data rates and thus these amendments are called High Throughput WLANs (HT-WLANs). For both standards, PHY is enhanced with multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna technologies, channel bonding, short guard intervals (SGI), enhanced modulation and coding schemes (MCS). At the same time, MAC layer overhead is reduced by introducing frame aggregation and <b>block</b> <b>acknowledgement</b> technologies. However, existing studies reveal that although PHY and MAC enhancements promise to improve physical data rate significantly, they yield negative impact over upper layer protocols [...] mainly for reliable end-to-end transport/application layer protocols. As a consequence, a large number of schools have focused researches on HT-WLANs to improve the coordination among PHY/MAC and upper layer protocols and thus, boost up the performance benefit. In this survey, we discuss the impact of enhancements of PHY/MAC layer in HT-WLANs over transport/application layer protocols. list down different open challenges that can be explored for the development of next generation HT-WLAN technologies...|$|R
