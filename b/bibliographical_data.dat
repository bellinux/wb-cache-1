25|$|Preface to Volume 1General PrefaceThe {{entrance}} of the United States of America into the arena of world-politics, the introduction of American influence into Oriental affairs, {{and the establishment of}} American authority in the Philippine archipelago, all render the history of those islands and their, numerous peoples a topic of engrossing interest and importance to the reading public, and especially to scholars, historians, and statesmen. The present work – its material carefully selected and arranged from a vast mass of printed works and unpublished manuscripts – is offered to the public with the intention and hope of casting light on the great problems which confront the American people in the Philippines; and of furnishing authentic and trustworthy material for a thorough and scholarly history of the islands. For this purpose, the Editors reproduce (mainly in English translation) contemporaneous documents which constitute the best original sources of Philippine history. Beginning with Pope Alexander VI's line of demarcation between the Spanish and the Portuguese dominions in the New World (1493), the course of history in the archipelago is thus traced through a period of more than three centuries, comprising the greater part of the Spanish régime.In the selection of material, the Editors have sought to make the scope of the work commensurate with the breadth of the field, and to allot to each subject space proportioned to its interest; not only the political relations, but the social and religious, economic and commercial conditions of the Philippines have received due attention and care. All classes of writers are here represented—early navigators, officials civil and military, ecclesiastical dignitaries, and priests belonging to the various religious orders who conducted the missions among the Filipino peoples. To the letters, reports, and narratives furnished by these men are added numerous royal decrees, papal bulls and briefs, and other valuable documents. Most of this material is {{now for the first time}} made accessible to English-speaking readers; and the great libraries and archives of Spain, Italy, France, England, Mexico, and the United States have generously contributed to furnish it.In the presentation of these documents, the Editors assume an entirely impartial attitude, free from any personal bias, whether political or sectarian. They aim to secure historical accuracy, especially in that aspect which requires the sympathetic interpretation of each author's thought and intention; and to depict faithfully the various aspects of the life of the Filipinos, their relations with other peoples (especially those of Europe), and the gradual ascent of many tribes from barbarism. They invite the reader's especial attention to the Introduction furnished for this series by Professor Edward Gaylord Bourne, of Yale University – valuable alike for its breadth of view and for its scholarly thoroughness. The <b>Bibliographical</b> <b>Data</b> at the end of each volume will supply necessary information as to sources and location of the documents published therein; fuller details, and of broader scope, will be given in the volume devoted to Philippine bibliography, at the end of the series.|$|E

It is {{important to point out}} that not only was the historical and artistic roots of the material taken into consideration, but also the wide range of materials used and chosen for architectural purposes was much emphasized. Research done so far focused on the importance of widening our knowlwdge of buildings in one section of the X regio in particular, and it has shaped a flourishing list of the possible stones used. The basic premise of this study was to individualize and trace an organic scheme for both the published and unpublished materials, as well as to revise the <b>bibliographical</b> <b>datas.</b> As a result of this, a revised and computerized catalogue of the above mentioned area was created. Bibliographical research was supported by visits, in accordance with the competent bodies, to the sites and Museums where the fragments are kept, in order to check and up to date the <b>datas</b> achieved through <b>bibliographical</b> research. This method of work has led to the creation of one database where the software has been personalized according to a precise scheme. In further addiction to that, research has dealt with the typological and stylistic analysis of the fragments, aiming at finding their original collocation in the buildings, thanks to the evidence of the digging datas and the comparisons between similar witnesses of the pas...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} the {{efficiency}} and effects of addition of aluminium sulphate on soft water quality of a shallow eutrophic lake. Almost all the controlled variables improved with treatment, especially nutrient concentrations such as soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and transparency. However, aluminium sulphate was not added in sufficient quantity to reduce the total phosphorus content, SRP concentration was significantly reduced in the short term. Moreover, external loading of phosphorus was high and not taken into account by the in-lake treatments. Finally, resuspension of sediment (polymictic lake) removed the alum hydroxide layer on the sediment surface, which reduced treatment effectiveness. No significant pH decrease was noted following alum addition. According to <b>bibliographical</b> toxicological <b>data,</b> monomeric aluminium content does not show any toxic effect on aquatic fauna and flora. In spite of low SRP in the water column, the treatment did not prevent appearance of Microcystis sp. colony (> 10 colony per ml) approximately 30 days after alum applicatio...|$|R

In recent years a community-based emergency first aid responder (EFAR) program has been created to address this need. EFARs have expressed interest in participating in other health related projects, and have the potential to help address health literacy needs in the Cape Town area. The aim {{of this study was to}} validate the use of the HLQ (Health Literacy Questionnaire) in South Africa and use it to develop a framework for EFARs to measure and respond to health literacy needs.

The stroke density and maximum current of lightning strokes detected by GLD 360 are compared to reflectivity observed by the TRMM PR. When the reflectivity is binned according to the stroke density and maximum current, the relationship between lightning and rainfall is found to be log-normal. Lightning occurring over each of the three ocean basins is associated with maximum reflectivity near 2 km altitude within a narrow range of values (45 [...] 50 dBZ). The reflectivity associated with stroke density and maximum current was shown to be 1 [...] 4 dBZ higher in winter than in summer. The maximum reflectivity above the freezing level is found to be larger for larger stroke density...|$|R
