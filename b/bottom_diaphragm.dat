40|$|In the {{diaphragm}} forming process, the thermoplastic composite sheet is clamped between two high temperature thermoplastic diaphragms. In the present study, {{the influence of}} temperature, pressure and forming rate on the deformation of high temperature PI diaphragms (Upilex-R(R), Ube Industries) is described. At temperatures below 275 degreesC the upper diaphragm slides over the <b>bottom</b> <b>diaphragm</b> and shows a more global deformation, above 305 degreesC, the upper diaphragm cannot slide over the <b>bottom</b> <b>diaphragm</b> and deforms in the same manner. The region 275 - 305 degreesC {{is a kind of}} transition region between the previous two temperature ranges. A hydrostatic pressure of I bar turned out to be sufficient to deform {{the diaphragm}}s, therefore, no influence of pressure was observed. The deformation of the <b>bottom</b> <b>diaphragm</b> is independent of forming rate, while the upper diaphragm showed some dependence. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|The paper {{considers}} a new technical solution of strengthening the existing assembly span structures made of T-beams with diaphragms {{with the help}} of lateral compression device. The peculiar feature of the solution consists in fixing the stressed elements for lateral compression not only in the place of edge beam ribs but also in the place of intermediate beam ribs. Due to this an effect of discrete bond between steel and concrete is ensured and it permits significantly to reduce tension force and increase efficiency of lateral compression for strengthening span structures. Technical and economical effect is achieved in the way when braces are located {{at the level of the}} <b>bottom</b> part of <b>diaphragm</b> section core that excludes emergence of tension stresses in the top part of diaphragm joints and ensures appearance of sufficient compressive stresses in the <b>bottom</b> part of <b>diaphragm</b> joints compensating tension against passing loads and this increases reliability of a span structure. </p...|$|R
2500|$|Performing {{abdominal}} thrusts, {{better known}} as the Heimlich Maneuver, involves a rescuer standing behind a patient and using their hands to exert pressure on the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>diaphragm.</b> This compresses the lungs and exerts pressure on any object lodged in the trachea, hopefully expelling it. This amounts to an artificial cough. Henry Heimlich, as the inventor of his abdominal thrust technique, first published his findings about the maneuver in a June 1974 informal article in Emergency Medicine entitled, [...] "Pop Goes the Cafe Coronary". On June 19, 1974, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported that retired restaurant-owner Isaac Piha used the procedure to rescue choking victim Irene Bogachus in Bellevue, Washington.|$|R

This amounts to an artificially induced cough. For example, WebMD recommends the rescuer placing his or her fist just above the person's bellybutton and grasping it with the other hand. To assist a larger person, more force may be needed. [...] The Mayo Clinic recommends the same placement of fist and hand and upward thrusts {{as if you are}} trying to lift the person.|$|R
50|$|Design {{changes to}} make the {{instrument}} more sensitive, simpler to read, and easier to transport resulted in variations such as the basin, siphon, wheel, cistern, Fortin, multiple folded, stereometric, and balance barometers. Fitzroy barometers combine the standard mercury barometer with a thermometer, {{as well as a}} guide of how to interpret pressure changes. Fortin barometers use a variable displacement mercury cistern, usually constructed with a thumbscrew pressing on a leather <b>diaphragm</b> <b>bottom.</b> This compensates for displacement of mercury in the column with varying pressure. To use a Fortin barometer, the level of mercury is set to the zero level before the pressure is read on the column. Some models also employ a valve for closing the cistern, enabling the mercury column to be forced {{to the top of the}} column for transport. This prevents water-hammer damage to the column in transit.|$|R

40|$|Abstract-The {{design of}} a capacitive-sensing {{pressure}} sensor for extreme environment is proposed in this project. The movable diaphragm (top plate) is made of either cubic silicon carbide (3 C-SiC) or Silicon (Si), while the fix <b>diaphragm</b> (<b>bottom</b> plate) is made of Si. This paper specifically compares the mechanical performance of the movable diaphragm utilizing both materials. Two important parameters associated with {{the behavior of the}} diaphragm are examined, namely the maximum deflection and maximum stress, and they are simulated at a pressure of 0 - 100 MPa, and at temperature of 27 - 1000 ˚C. The graphs of maximum deflection and stress vs pressures at different temperatures and thicknesses are plotted to summarize the data. SiC diaphragm has lower deflection and stress compares to Si diaphragm at different thicknesses, pressures and temperatures. Then, a linear regression analysis is performed to determine the R-square value. It is shown from these analyses that SiC diaphragm exhibits better linear behavior compares to Si diaphragm. Generally, this work proves that SiC is a better material over Si {{for the development of a}} pressure sensor at extreme environment...|$|R
40|$|Following {{the loss}} of an inner column, a moment {{resisting}} frame initially carries the upper load by the flexural mechanism with potential contribution from the catenary mechanism as the beams connected to the failed column deflect. The effective utilization of the catenary mechanism depends on the behaviour of the beam-to-column connections in the affected span. Previous {{studies have demonstrated that}} the types and details of the moment connections determine their behaviour, especially the failure mode, in the column removal scenario. Two typical failure modes, the beam-end continuous failure and the beam-end interrupted failure, have been studied in the literature. A third failure mode, identified as the column-wall failure, is investigated in this paper through a full-scale laboratory test and finite element (FE) simulations of an I beam-square hollow section column connection with inner diaphragms inside the column. The present experimental observation and FE analysis indicate that a column-wall failure starts with the separation between the <b>bottom</b> inner <b>diaphragm</b> and the column 2 ̆ 7 s inside wall, before fracture takes place in the column wall near the two ends of beam 2 ̆ 7 s bottom flange. The crack extends inwards along the bottom flange and finally upwards, at which point the flexural mechanism is fully replaced by the catenary mechanism. The column-wall failure mode is more desirable than the beam-end (or beam-section) continuous failure mode under the column removal scenario due to the former 2 ̆ 7 s ability to develop an effective catenary mechanism to bridge over the member failure of the column itself. In fact, the column-wall failure mode appeared to develop a more effective catenary mechanism than even the beam-end interrupted failure mode, although further research is required to ascertain the relative merits between the two modes and associated connection methods...|$|R

40|$|Studies on {{ultimate}} {{limit states}} and nonlinear behaviors of bridges will greatly enhance the understanding of bridge engineers on the moment and shear distribution and the general performance of bridges under load. Described herein is an experimental and theoretical investigation of ultimate loads and nonlinear behaviors of two-span continuous composite curved multi-cell box-girder bridges with a single column as middle support and subjected to OHBDC design truck loadings. The curved bridges are modeled by using the finite element methods. The deck slab, webs, the <b>bottom</b> plate and <b>diaphragms</b> are modeled by 4 -node shell elements while the shear connectors and the single middle column are modeled by 3 -D beam elements. The existing software COSMOS/M {{is used for the}} analysis. A model test of a two-span continuous composite curved multi-cell box-girder bridge with a single column at the middle support is conducted to verify the finite element method. Idealized bridges with different parameters are also studied. Consideration is given to many of the variables that significantly influence ultimate loads and nonlinear behaviors of such bridges. Several rational suggestions are made to enhance the design of two-span continuous composite curved four-cell box-girder bridges...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} design methodology, fabrication procedure, and key experimental characterization {{results of a}} linear array of capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers (CMUT) for possible ophthalmic anterior segment imaging application. The design methodology involves analytical, 3 -D electromechanical finite element analysis, and Verasonics Vantage 128 ultrasonic research platform based diagnostic imaging simulations to develop a technique that minimizes electrical charging and center frequency drift while improving the transduction efficiency. In the design, Bisbenzocyclobutene (BCB), a low K polymer from Dow Chemical Company, has been innovatively used {{for the first time}} to fabricate the structural layer of the CMUT diaphragm, realize the interelectrode dielectric spacer, and to act as a low temperature adhesive bonding agent. Additionally, the top CMUT electrode has been placed at the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>diaphragm</b> to affect higher capacitance change that increases sensitivity and provides additional decoupling of the electrical charging effects. Several arrays with element count ranging from 8 to 128 elements and a center frequency range of 5 MHz to 40 MHz have been designed and fabricated. Due to an unforeseen adhesion issue during wirebonding, a 32 channel 40 MHz CMUT array has been packaged manually to validate the fabrication process and CMUT operation. Extensive SEM inspections of the CMUT cross-sections show good agreement with the design specifications. Static and dynamic measurements using a Polytec laser Doppler vibrometer, impedance measurement using an Agilent vector network analyzer, and LCR measurement results are in excellent agreement with analytical and FEA analysis using IntelliSuite. The frequency analysis exhibits high electromechanical coupling coefficient of 0. 66 at a low bias voltage of 20 V and high uniformity. A successful measurement of the lower drift of the center frequency 0. 32 % and higher coupling coefficient verifies the hypothesis that the excellent electrical, structural, and processing characteristics of BCB is a viable option to mitigate the dielectric charging and improve the transduction efficiency of CMUTs...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} avoid the {{adjacent}} constructions from being damaged in deep excavation project, a certain auxiliary measurement is usually adopted in restraining the ground movements due to excavation so as to protect the adjacent buildings. In recent years, buttress wall has been adopted as an auxiliary measurement in protecting the adjacent buildings in excavation; however, in concerning the way how it performances is still lack of consolidated result of verification. Neither domestic nor foreign is still in lack of regarding the study of mechanism, behavior and analysis methodology of the buttress wall. Thus, until so far, concerning the analysis and designing of buttress wall is still staying in the empirical stage that the configuration of buttress wall, including space, length and depth does not have a consistent agreement. Thus, in some cases there came with relatively large space between the buttress walls; some with longer length; some with depth started from near ground surface downward to the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>diaphragm</b> wall; some only ended to 1 / 2 depth of the diaphragm wall penetrated to underground; some started from the final excavation downward a certain depth, etc. in various configurations where each revealed different performance separately either in reducing the diaphragm wall displacement effectively or in minor. Therefore, the further study of mechanism, behavior and analysis methodology of buttress wall is required. For this reason, the study shall focus on a series of complete research of buttress wall. As the lateral displacement of diaphragm wall in deep excavation after buttress wall has been set is a 3 -D moving behavior, we decided to apply 3 -D numerical analysis for case studies in simulating the analysis and verification, then studied the various buttress wall models in configuration so as to clarify the mechanism and behavior of diaphragm wall, in the mean time, recommend the methodology of 3 -D simulation analysis in simulation. Then, we proceed with parametric study via 3 -D numerical analysis to investigate the performance of buttress wall as the basis in suggesting the principle of optimal design as well as the simplified designing chart for industrial reference. Finally, as currently the beam on elastoplastic foundation method or 2 -D plane strain numerical analysis is broadly adopted in the designing stage of excavation by the industrial field, this study shall follow these two guidelines and propose reasonable analysis method in simulation of setting up buttress wall in excavation. Expect it is helpful in the practical analysis and designing tasks. [[abstract]]深開挖工程為了避免損及鄰近構造物，在施工前，常採用一些輔助措施， 控制開挖引致之地盤位移，以達到鄰房保護的目的。近年來，扶壁常被用來作 為開挖之鄰房保護的輔助措施，然而其成效到底為何，卻一直缺少具體的驗證 結果。國內外有關扶壁機制、行為及分析方法的研究，相當的缺乏。因此到目 前為止，有關扶壁的分析及設計皆還停留在經驗的階段，對於扶壁的配置，包 括間距、長度及深度，並未有一致的看法，所以有些案例的扶壁間距相對的較 大、有些案例的扶壁長度相對較長、有些案例的扶壁深度由接近地表處開始往 下設置至連續壁底端，有些則僅至連續壁貫入深度的一半處，另有一些案例， 扶壁則僅從最終開挖面開始往下設置一段深度而已，各種設置方式皆不盡相 同，而各個案例顯現出的扶壁功效亦不盡相同，有些案例扶壁能發揮減少連續 壁側向位移的功效，有些案例則顯示功效不大，因此有關扶壁的機制、行為特 性及分析方法亟待進一步的研究。 有鑑於此，本研究將對扶壁進行一完整的研究。由於配置扶壁後之深開挖 的連續壁側向位移係屬三向度行為，因此本研究首先將採用三向度數值分析， 進行案例的模擬分析驗證，然後針對不同的扶壁配置型式進行研究，以釐清扶 壁之機制及行為特性，並建議適合的三向度模擬分析方法。其次將採用三向度 數值分析進行參數研究，以探討扶壁之成效，並據以建議最佳化設計原則，以 及簡化的設計圖表，供工程界參考使用。最後，由於目前工程界在設計深開挖 時，大多採用彈塑性基礎梁法或二向度的平面應變數值分析，因此本研究將配 合彈塑性基礎梁法及二向度的平面應變數值分析，提出設置扶壁之開挖工程的 合理分析模擬方法，希望能對實務之分析及設計工作有所助益...|$|R
