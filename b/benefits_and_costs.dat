25|$|The {{free rider}} problem {{depends on a}} {{conception}} {{of the human being}} as homo economicus: purely rational and also purely selfish—extremely individualistic, considering only those <b>benefits</b> <b>and</b> <b>costs</b> that directly affect him or her.

25|$|The {{economics}} {{of global warming}} concerns the economic aspects of global warming; this can inform policies that governments might consider in response.

This paper presents results of a systematic review of literature, which investigates how existing methods approach the problem of requirements prioritization based on <b>benefit</b> <b>and</b> <b>cost.</b> From this review, it derives a set of under-researched issues which warrant future efforts and sketches an agenda for future research in this area...|$|R
25|$|CBA {{is related}} to (but {{distinct}} from) cost-effectiveness analysis. In CBA, <b>benefits</b> <b>and</b> <b>costs</b> are expressed in monetary terms, and are adjusted for the time value of money, so that all flows of benefits and flows of project costs over time (which tend to occur {{at different points in}} time) are expressed on a common basis in terms of their net present value.|$|E
25|$|Touch on / touch off {{has both}} <b>benefits</b> <b>and</b> <b>costs.</b> On {{the one hand}} it allows fares to be {{automatically}} calculated, always giving the passenger the cheapest fare option and special off-peak fares to encourage travel during quiet times could be implemented, which is impossible with Metcard. The main disadvantage would be to passengers who do not touch off and who would therefore be charged the total fare for the trip they might have taken.|$|E
25|$|Cost benefit {{analysis}} (CBA), sometimes called benefit costs analysis (BCA), is a systematic approach to estimating {{the strengths and}} weaknesses of alternatives (for example in transactions, activities, functional business requirements or projects investments); it is used to determine options that provide the best approach to achieve benefits while preserving savings. The CBA is also defined as a systematic process for calculating and comparing <b>benefits</b> <b>and</b> <b>costs</b> of a decision, policy (with particular regard to government policy) or (in general) project.|$|E

40|$|An {{interaction}} between evolution and learning called the Baldwin effect {{is known as}} the two-step evolution caused by the balances between <b>benefit</b> <b>and</b> <b>cost</b> of learning. However, little is still known about dynamic properties of these balances in complex environments. Our purpose is to clarify the key factors and conditions which bring about the dynamic evolution of the <b>benefit</b> <b>and</b> <b>cost</b> of learning by focusing on the quantitative evolution of phenotypic plasticity under the assumption of epistatic interactions. We have constructed an evolutionary model of quantitative traits by using an extended version of NK fitness landscape, in which plasticity of each phenotype is genetically defined and plastic phenotypes can be adjusted by learning iterations. The simulation results have shown that the dynamic emergence of the <b>benefit</b> <b>and</b> <b>cost</b> of learning brought about the threestep evolution of the Baldwin effect (observed in our previous study [8]) and it depends on the balances between the degree of epistasis and the number of learning iterations...|$|R

25|$|Another {{method of}} {{overcoming}} the free rider {{problem is to}} simply eliminate the profit incentive for free riding by buying out all the potential free riders. A property developer that owned an entire city street, for instance, would not {{need to worry about}} free riders when erecting street lights since he owns every business that could benefit from the street light without paying. Implicitly, then, the property developer would erect street lights until the marginal social benefit met the marginal social cost. In this case, they are equivalent to the private marginal <b>benefits</b> <b>and</b> <b>costs.</b>|$|E
25|$|A usable Northern Sea Route between {{northern}} Europe to North Pacific ports {{would cut}} time at sea (and resultant fuel consumption) {{by more than}} half. For the corporate players in bulk shipping of relative low-value raw materials, cost savings for fuel may appear as a driver to explore the Northern Sea Route for commercial transits, and not necessarily reduced lead time. The Northern Sea Route allows economies of scale compared to coastal route alternatives, with vessel draught and beam limitation. Environmental demands faced by the maritime shipping industry may emerge as a driver for developing the Northern Sea Route. Increased awareness of environmental <b>benefits</b> <b>and</b> <b>costs</b> for both the Northern Sea Route and Suez routes will probably be important factors in this respect.|$|E
25|$|Cost–benefit {{analysis}} {{is often used}} by organizations to appraise the desirability of a given policy. It is {{an analysis of the}} expected balance of <b>benefits</b> <b>and</b> <b>costs,</b> including an account of foregone alternatives and the status quo. CBA helps predict whether the benefits of a policy outweigh its costs, and by how much relative to other alternatives, so that one can rank alternate policies in terms of the cost–benefit ratio. Generally, accurate cost–benefit analysis identifies choices that increase welfare from a utilitarian perspective. Assuming an accurate CBA, changing the status quo by implementing the alternative with the lowest cost–benefit ratio can improve Pareto efficiency. While CBA can offer a well-educated estimate of the best alternative – perfect appraisal of all present and future costs and benefits is difficult –, perfection in terms of economic efficiency and social welfare are not guaranteed.|$|E
40|$|Under {{constraints}} of Bayesian interim incentive compatibility and individual rationality, the paper characterizes second-best allocations for {{the provision of}} a public good. If <b>benefit</b> <b>and</b> <b>cost</b> functions do not depend on the number of participants, it is always beneficial to have more participants. As the number of participants becomes large, second-best of public-good provision converge in distribution to first-best levels if these levels are bounded.

Second-best provision levels become large in absolute terms but small relative to first-best levels if <b>benefit</b> <b>and</b> <b>cost</b> functions are isoelastic.

25|$|There are {{philosophers}} who {{are concerned}} with the question of fundamentality. That is, which is more ontologically fundamental the parts or their wholes. There are several responses to this question, though one of the default assumptions is that the parts are more fundamental. That is, the whole is grounded in its parts. This is the mainstream view. Another view, explored by Shaffer (2010) is monism, where the parts are grounded in the whole. Shaffer does not just mean that, say, the parts that make up my body are grounded in my body. Rather, Shaffer argues that the whole cosmos is more fundamental and everything else {{is a part of the}} cosmos. Then, there is the identity theory which claims that there is no hierarchy or fundamentality to parts and wholes. Instead wholes are just (or equivalent to) their parts. There can also be a two-object view which says that the wholes are not equal to the parts—they are numerically distinct from one another. Each of these theories has <b>benefits</b> <b>and</b> <b>costs</b> associated with them.|$|E
25|$|Although most {{research}} has been conducted on adults, children can be bystanders too. A study conducted by Robert Thornberg in 2007 came up with seven reasons why children do not help when another classmate is in distress. These include: trivialisation, dissociation, embarrassment association, busy working priority, compliance with a competitive norm, audience modelling, and responsibility transfer. In a further study, Thornberg concluded that there are seven stages of moral deliberation as a bystander in bystander situations among the Swedish schoolchildren he observed and interviewed: (a) noticing that something is wrong, i.e., children pay selective attention to their environment, and sometimes they don't tune in on a distressed peer if they're in a hurry or their view is obstructed, (b) interpreting a need for help—sometimes children think others are just playing rather than actually in distress or they display pluralistic ignorance, (c) feeling empathy, i.e., having tuned in on a situation and concluded that help is needed, children might feel sorry for an injured peer, or angry about unwarranted aggression (empathic anger), (d) processing the school's moral frames—Thornberg identified five contextual ingredients influencing children's behavior in bystander situations (the definition of a good student, tribe caring, gender stereotypes, and social-hierarchy-dependent morality), (e) scanning for social status and relations, i.e., students were less likely to intervene if they didn't define themselves as friends of the victim or belonging to the same significant social category as the victim, or if there were high-status students present or involved as aggressors—conversely, lower-status children were more likely to intervene if only a few other low-status children were around, (f) condensing motives for action, such as considering a number of factors such as possible <b>benefits</b> <b>and</b> <b>costs,</b> and (g) acting, i.e., all of the above coalesced into a decision to intervene or not. It is striking how this was less an individual decision than the product of a set of interpersonal and institutional processes.|$|E
500|$|Decebalus' reign saw nearly {{constant}} warfare {{between the}} Dacians and Roman administrations {{south of the}} Danube. Around 85 AD raiding resumed in Moesia, Illyria and Macedonia culminating {{in the death of}} the Roman Governor of Moesia, Oppius Sabinius. In response Domitian launched a campaign the same year under the command of the Praetorian Prefect Cornelius Fuscus. Domitian ignored Decebalus' offer of peace to Rome, an error which caused them to suffer a disastrous defeat, losing Fuscus, his forces, and the Roman standards and war machines. A second expedition was launched in 88 AD this time under the command of Tettius Julianus. This second campaign was somewhat victorious as both sides suffered massive casualties in battle. [...] However, revolts and defections forced Domitian to negotiate a hasty peace treaty with Decebalus in 89 AD. This peace had <b>benefits</b> <b>and</b> <b>costs</b> to both sides; Rome had to pay financial tributes and provide technological assistance to Dacia, in exchange Dacia effectively became a client kingdom of Rome acting like a bulkhead to the empire by separating Rome from other warring tribes.|$|E

2500|$|Currency {{is defined}} as the unit that is {{optimized}} by the animal. [...] It is also a hypothesis of the costs and benefits that are imposed on that animal. [...] For example, a certain forager gains energy from food, but incurs the cost of searching for the food: the time and energy spent searching could have been used instead on other endeavors, such as finding mates or protecting young. [...] It would be in the animal's best interest to maximize its benefits at the lowest cost. [...] Thus, the currency in this situation could be defined as net energy gain per unit time. [...] However, for a different forager, {{the time it takes to}} digest the food after eating could be a more significant cost than the time and energy spent looking for food. In this case, the currency could be defined as net energy gain per digestive turnover time instead of net energy gain per unit time. Furthermore, <b>benefits</b> <b>and</b> <b>costs</b> can depend on a forager's community. [...] For example, a forager living in a hive would most likely forage in a manner that would maximize efficiency for its colony rather than itself. By identifying the currency, one can construct a hypothesis about which <b>benefits</b> <b>and</b> <b>costs</b> are important to the forager in question.|$|E
