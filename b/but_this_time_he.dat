5|$|Brooks {{came into}} the 1984 Australian Championships as the favourite, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> was on the {{receiving}} end of a close result. He placed third in the 100m freestyle behind Mark Stockwell and Delany, missing individual selection by 0.05s. The trio was separated by a total of only 0.15s. Selected as a relay swimmer only, he went to Los Angeles hoping to win the 4100m freestyle relay, an event that the United States had always won.|$|E
5|$|After being remanded to {{determine}} if the regulations were not discriminatory, the case returned to the United States Supreme Court in Department of Game of Washington v. Puyallup Tribe (Puyallyp II). Again, Justice Douglas wrote the opinion for the Court, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> struck down the state restrictions as discriminatory. Douglas noted that the restrictions for catching steelhead trout with nets had remained, and was a method used only by the Indians, whereas hook and line fishing was allowed but was used only by non-Indians. As such, the effect of the regulation allocated all of the steelhead trout fishing to sport anglers, and none to the tribes.|$|E
5|$|On Monday, 26 August, Gloucestershire met Lancashire {{again at}} the Clifton College Close Ground and, despite another good innings by Hornby, Gloucestershire this time were victorious by 8 wickets. Grace had won the toss and put Lancashire in to bat first. Grace the bowler was once more the star {{performer}} as he took 7–77 and 5–32, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> did well with the bat and made a good 49 in difficult conditions. His brother Fred scored 73 not out and this was crucial to the Gloucestershire success. Grace scored 20 not out in the second innings as Gloucestershire made 32–2 to win.|$|E

5|$|Tronstad {{spent the}} first year of a {{research}} period as an assistant to Herbert Freundlich in Dahlem, Berlin. He studied the passivity of metal surfaces, and made a breakthrough when he managed to measure extremely thin oxide surface coatings, thus solving a problem dating from the time of Michael Faraday. He continued to Stockholm to study metallography under Carl Benedicks, and to elaborate further on his results from Berlin. The work was completed in 1931 and his thesis, spanning 250 pages, was published in German as Optische Untersuchungen zur Frage der Passivität des Eisens und Stahls. For it, he received the doctorate degree. He was hired at the Norwegian Institute of Technology as a lecturer in the summer of 1931, although he {{spent the first}} year at the University of Cambridge, conducting further research with a scholarship from a memorial fund of Christian Michelsen. The research at Cambridge was a continuation of his thesis work, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> tested his method on mercury.|$|E
25|$|In 1786 he {{repeated}} the journey, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> delivered the slaves to Dominca. At {{some point in the}} voyage Captain Thomas Smith replaced Patrick.|$|E

25|$|In the {{election}} Thevar again contested both the Aruppukottai constituency in the Lok Sabha {{election and the}} Mudukulathur constituency in the assembly election. He won both seats, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> decided to vacate the assembly seat.|$|E
25|$|After Meinhard died in 1196, {{his place}} {{was taken by}} Berthold. Berthold tried to convert the Livonians by force, {{launching}} two raids on Livonia. The first took place in 1196, but {{he was forced to}} retreat to Germany after being ambushed near Salaspils. He tried again in 1198, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> was killed by the Livonian soldier Ymaut.|$|E

This isn't {{the first time that the}} dictator has threatened world peace, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>he's</b> playing a very nuanced game moving chess pieces around the board while isolating Ryan from the rest of the international community. Fortunately, Jack Ryan, Jr. and the rest of his Campus team find themselves in the middle of action with a vital clue to the Russian's intentions." ...|$|R
25|$|He {{was again}} {{given a chance}} during Pakistan's cricket team tour to New Zealand in 2003, where he was {{selected}} for the test squad, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> didn't perform well and was dropped from then the incoming ODI series. He {{has never been a}} part of National Cricket team since then and eventually announced his formal retirement from both formats of cricket in late 2003.|$|E
25|$|Xerxes {{was pleased}} with her advice and while he already held her in great esteem he now praised her further. Despite this, he gave orders to follow {{the advice of the}} rest of his commanders. Xerxes thought that at the naval battle of Artemisium his men acted like cowards because he was not there to watch them. <b>But</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> would watch the battle himself to ensure they would act bravely.|$|E
25|$|Hooper first {{announced}} his shocking retirement {{three weeks before}} the 1999 Cricket World Cup but made a surprising comeback in 2001 and captained the West Indies team in 2003 Cricket World Cup. West Indies failed to progress to the second round after some miserable performances {{in the first round of}} tournament. Despite that, Hooper was retained in the side <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>time,</b> <b>he</b> pulled himself back and finally retired from the game as he wanted a youngster in the team instead of him.|$|E
50|$|His {{early work}} had been {{influenced}} by Vardges Sureniants <b>but,</b> after <b>this</b> <b>time,</b> <b>he</b> began to employ impressionistic and pointillistic techniques. In 1916, he became the founder {{and head of the}} Union of Armenian Artists.|$|R
5000|$|... "It {{finds him}} {{sticking}} to the Europoppy sound of his previous singles, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>he's</b> drafted in his starriest sparring partner yet - Sugababes singer Amelle Berrabah. He powers through the verses in his distinctive London twang, she croons the glorious chorus, and Fraser T Smith keeps the production as fresh and sharp as a grapefuit breakfast. Stryder may have started the year as the so-called [...] "Prince of Grime", but... wait for it... he's fast establishing himself as the King of the Charts." [...] and he gave the song {{four out of five}} stars.|$|R
5000|$|Roger Ebert {{awarded the}} film 1 {{and a half}} out of 4 stars and was also {{critical}} towards Murray's performance: [...] "the energy isn't there. Murray often chooses to play a laid-back, detached character, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>he's</b> so detached he's almost absent. He chooses {{to work in a}} low key, and the other actors, in matching his energy level, make a movie that drones instead of hums". Yet, Ebert enjoyed the comedy's humor: [...] "Murray's portrait of an inspirational speaker is right on target, and filled out with lots of subtle touches of movement and dialog, and there is humor".|$|R
25|$|His {{form was}} good enough to be rewarded with his {{first-class}} debut {{at the end of the}} season. He played in a Sheffield Shield match against Tasmania. He opened the batting, scoring 40 runs in the first innings and 71 in the second. As South Australia won the match, they progressed to the final against Victoria, which Dalton also played in. He again opened the batting, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> was bowled by James Pattinson on the third ball of South Australia’s first innings.|$|E
25|$|Following further {{work and}} testing, Amon {{returned}} for the Monaco GP and qualified twentieth, but, thanks to mechanical problems, {{he was unable}} to start the race. Further problems and illness meant Amon was not able to reappear with the F101 until the Italian GP, three races {{from the end of the}} season, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> was unable to qualify. That sealed the fate of both the car and Chris Amon Racing, leaving Amon to drive the season's last two races with the faltering BRM team. He would later reveal that he had turned down a chance to join the Brabham team earlier in the season.|$|E
25|$|Groves {{returned}} for a fourth season at Oxford in 1966 but played only four matches because of examination demands. One of those, however, was his third University Match, and after five consecutive drawn games in this fixture the 1966 match was won by an innings by Oxford, with Groves' unbeaten 80 in 98 minutes {{on the first day}} one of the batting highlights, enabling Oxford to declare and give Cambridge an awkward half hour's batting {{at the end of the}} day. After the game, Groves again joined Somerset, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> played only a handful of second eleven matches and did not feature in the first team, which was having one of its most successful seasons.|$|E

25|$|As {{stated in}} his biography, in a match in 1994, Arn {{was thrown into}} the ring ropes. The top rope broke from the turnbuckle, but {{he was able to}} land on his feet. Six months later, the same event {{happened}} again, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> landed full-force on to the concrete and hit his head, neck, and upper back. He never took time off to heal. As time passed, with no down time, the injuries worsened. In his biography, Anderson states that the first sign of problems was, during a match, his left arm suddenly went numb and unresponsive. Later on, they found a rib, possibly torn away from the spine during the accident, was popping in and out of joint, causing shoulder discomfort and weakness.|$|E
25|$|Ava {{would come}} to rue the missed opportunity. Swa kept Swe from the next {{invasion}} in the following dry season. Swe was assigned to guard the capital while Swa and Tarabya invaded the southern country again. The second invasion fared no better. Razadarit committed no more errors, and hunkered down. Ava troops could not break through Pegu's defenses and had to retreat before the rainy season arrived. Swe was to get his chance again {{to go to the}} front in the 1390–91 campaign. <b>But</b> <b>this</b> <b>time,</b> <b>he</b> commanded just a regiment, and was directly under the command of Tarabya. At any rate, their army could not break through the Pegu defenses at Pankyaw although the campaign ended in a truce.|$|E
25|$|The Chiefs {{responded with}} a drive to the Dolphins 30-yard line, {{featuring}} a 33-yard reception by receiver Stephone Paige, but it ended with no points when safety Jarvis Williams intercepted a pass from Steve DeBerg. After an exchange of punts, Miami drove to the Chiefs 39-yard line. Stoyanovich attempted another long field goal, this one 57 yards, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> missed and the Chiefs got rolling with a 16-yard run from Christian Okoye. Then DeBerg got his team {{into the end zone}} with two completions to Paige, the first for 16 yards and the second a 26-yard touchdown to make the score 10–3. Miami later threatened to score with a drive in the Chiefs territory, but Neil Smith forced a fumble from Marino and J. C. Pearson recovered it, keeping the score 10–3 at halftime.|$|E
50|$|He {{worked for}} over 40 years in display advertising, {{retiring}} in 1969, <b>but</b> during <b>this</b> <b>time,</b> <b>he</b> did fine-art painting. He was President of the Society of Western Artists and taught watercolor painting, which he began exhibiting in the 1940s.|$|R
