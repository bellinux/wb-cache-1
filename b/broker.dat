40|$|Abstract. In many {{developing}} democracies local party <b>brokers</b> distribute mate-rial benefits to voters. Yet {{we find that}} many <b>brokers</b> consume a share of these goods. This raises important puzzles. Why do party bosses rely on <b>brokers</b> who take goods {{that could be used}} to win votes? Why do voters support parties whose <b>brokers</b> take their goods? We argue that <b>brokers</b> must be compensated for the voters they mobilize. Bosses can motivate some <b>brokers</b> with the promise of polit-ical careers, but these careers are scarce. Thus, bosses tolerate many <b>brokers</b> who steal resources for their compensation. Since a <b>broker’s</b> mobilizing effort gives a boss incentives to channel resources to a <b>broker’s</b> constituency, voters also tolerate <b>brokers</b> who skim some resources to compensate themselves for the costs of their effort. We develop our argument formally, and evaluate it with extensive qualita-tive evidence and a unique survey of <b>brokers</b> in Argentina...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} the relationship between language <b>brokering</b> and its effects on the level of stress of the <b>brokers.</b> Specifically, the relationships between language <b>brokering,</b> parentification, stress, and gender were explored. Gender differences in the strength of this relationship were also examined. The following was expected: high levels of <b>brokering</b> would correlate positively with high levels of parentification; high levels of <b>brokering</b> would correlate positively with high levels of stress; high levels of parentification would correlate with high levels of stress; and that both <b>brokering</b> and parentification were gender specific, with female subjects reporting higher levels. The participants were 90 Latino undergrad students attending universities in the New York City area. The students completed several self-report measures including a parentification questionnaire, a language-brokering questionnaire, and stress scales. ^ Results showed that high levels of language <b>brokering</b> were positively correlated with high levels of parentification. Although no gender differences were found for levels of language <b>brokering,</b> females reported higher levels of parentification. Those who reported high levels of <b>brokering</b> did not report high levels of stress. However, those who reported high levels of parentification reported high levels of stress. The {{results of the present study}} emphasized the need for understanding the ramifications and long-term consequences of language <b>brokering,</b> particularly for the Latino community. While <b>brokering</b> itself may not lead to a heightened degree of stress, cultural nuances within the Latino community serve to further perpetuate the pressures associated with <b>brokering.</b> As such, once a pattern of <b>brokering</b> has been established and identified, interventions must be developed to decrease the occurrence of long term impairment of individual and family functioning. ...|$|R
