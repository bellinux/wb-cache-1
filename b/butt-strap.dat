60|$|Lister's head ached and his {{breathing}} was labored, {{but not much}} pressure was needed {{to keep out the}} shallow water and the diver had promised to warn him when they had stayed long enough. He forced himself to examine the plate the other indicated. Arcturus was a <b>butt-strapped</b> vessel and a number of the straps had burst. Plates were smashed and some of the holes were large, but in places the iron was drilled and in others patches had been bolted on. The salvage company had done part of this work and he thought it possible to make the damage good. If they could stop the remaining holes, the big pump ought to throw out the water; but Cartwright had talked about another opening and this would be awkward to reach.|$|R
5000|$|The first steam {{tractors}} {{that were}} designed specifically for agricultural uses were portable engines built on skids or on wheels and transported to the work area using horses. Later models used {{the power of the}} steam engine itself to power a drive train to move the machine and were first known as [...] "traction drive" [...] engines which eventually was shortened to [...] "tractor". These drive mechanisms were one of three types: chain, shaft, and open pinion. The open pinion became the most popular design due to its strength. Later improvements included power steering, differentials, compounded engines, and <b>butt-strap</b> boiler design.|$|E
50|$|The {{plates of}} early {{locomotive}} boilers {{were joined by}} simple overlapping joints. This practice was satisfactory for the annular joints, running around the boiler, but in longitudinal joints, {{along the length of}} the boiler, the overlap of the plates diverted the boiler cross-section from its ideal circular shape. Under pressure the boiler strained to reach, as nearly as possible, the circular cross-section. Because the double-thickness overlap was stronger than the surrounding metal, the repeated bending and release caused by the variations in boiler pressure caused internal cracks, or grooves (deep pitting), {{along the length of the}} joint. The cracks offered a starting point for internal corrosion, which could hasten failure. It was eventually found that this internal corrosion could be reduced by using plates of sufficient size so that no joints were situated below the water level. Eventually the simple lap seam was replaced by the single or double <b>butt-strap</b> seams, which do not suffer from this defect.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Adhesively bonded {{insulated}} rail joints {{are used to}} electrically isolate sections of track into discrete blocks to detect the positions of trains, and are sometimes useful in detecting rail breaks. Recent advances in high-strength rails allow {{for the use of}} higher-weight cars. With this increased axle loading of the freight lines, bonded rail joints are encountering early breakdown through either electrical or mechanical failure. Service lives as short as 12 – 18 months have been reported on some rail lines, significantly lower than the lifetime of other railway components. The cost of replacing the joints has significantly increased the desire for a joint with improved durability. Commercially available bonded rail joints are typically double <b>butt-strap</b> joints consisting of two steel reinforcing joint bars, bonded to the rails with an epoxy adhesive that may contain a fibreglass or aramid cloth layer. This paper investigates a tapered bonded joint that was proposed to reduce the high stresses that can result in the more typical <b>butt-strap</b> joint configuration. The first type of analysis models the rails and joint bars as beams, and the adhesive and ground as distributed elastic springs. Approximate solutions are obtained {{with the use of the}} Rayleigh–Ritz method. The finite-element method is used in the second type of analysis. Deflections, bending moments, andstresses areobtained. Basedon theseanalyses, tapered insulated joints shouldpro-vide some advantages over conventional {{insulated rail}} joints, such as lower deflections, bending moments, and shear stresses in the adhesive...|$|E
40|$|An ever {{increasing}} number of applications require robust joining technologies of dissimilar materials. In this study, three types of ceramic composites (C-C, C-SiC, and SiC-SiC) were vacuum brazed to commercially pure Ti using the Cusil-ABA (63 Ag - 35. 5 Cu - 1. 75 Ti) active metal braze alloy. The study also compared composite specimens as-fabricated and after surface grinding/polishing. A <b>butt-strap</b> tensile shear strength {{test was used to}} evaluate the joined structures at room temperature, 270 and 500 C. The elevated temperatures represent possible use temperatures for some heat rejection type applications. Joint strength will be discussed in light of braze wetting and spreading properties, composite properties, and test temperature...|$|E
40|$|The {{strength}} of bonded butt joints in pultruded material is investigated experimentally. The joints are bonded with commercially available two-part, cold curing, epoxy and acrylic adhesives. The {{aim of this}} work is to investigate the comparative {{strength of}} the butt joints when adhesives of differing stiffness are used to join a variety of pultruded materials. The effect of joint configuration, including a novel finger joint configuration, and mechanical surface preparation are also explored. The bonded specimens were tested to failure under static longitudinal tensile loading at room temperature. The {{results indicate that the}} quality and content of the pultruded material {{is an important factor in}} joint efficiency. The novel finger-joint configuration provides some interesting results when compared to the standard double <b>butt-strap</b> joints...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{adhesive}} bonding as a structural joining method {{has been gaining}} recognition in marine industry in recent years, though it has been widely adopted in other fields such as aerospace, automobiles, trains and in civil constructions. The type of materials used and design practices followed in marine structures are different from what is applied in other disciplines. Therefore new research approaches are required and recent novel ideas are ex- plored {{in the context of}} application of bonded joint configurations in marine environment. The research is directed at developing analysis tools for predicting the displacement, stress and strain fields in adhesively bonded joints between dissimilar adherends. In the finite element formulation, the adherends may be isotropic or orthotropic layered materi- als, which are assumed to behave linear elastically. The adhesive material is assumed to behave as elasto-plastic continuum, where the nonlinear behaviour is modelled as either a rigid or a semi-rigid adhesive solid that can be represented by the Ramberg-Osgood ma- terial model. The yield behaviour of the polymeric adhesive is modelled using a modified von Mises criterion, which accounts for the fact that plastic yielding of polymer materials may occur under the action of hydrostatic as well as deviatoric stresses. The geometric nonlinearity {{is based on the assumption}} of large displacement, large rotation but small strain, and it is implemented in the code using the total Lagrangian approach. The scheme is applied on three case studies viz. : a study of adherend imbalances in a single lap joint, stress analysis of a <b>butt-strap</b> joint system and a hybrid joint are un- dertaken. The influence of geometric and material nonlinearity on joint deformations and adhesive stresses, are studied for a single lap joint with dissimilar adherends, aluminium and a Fibre Reinforced plastic composite material, with varying adhrend thickness ratios. The adhesive stress-strain data obtained from the model are compared with the exper- imental stress-strain curve and the numerical results are validated with the analytical solution. Three dimensional effects like ’anticlastic’ and bending-twisting’ are shown in the joint with a dissimilar adherends. Key results are obtained that explains the state of nonlinear adhesive stress state in the joint. Analysis of <b>butt-strap</b> joint focussed on nonlinear modelling of a semi-rigid adhesive ma- terial that is used to bond two dissimilar adherends, steel and aluminium. The analysis demonstrate that the influence of geometric and material nonlinearity on the joint de- formations as well as the adhesive stresses is significant. Nonlinear adhesive stresses are compared with the actual strength of the highly flexible adhesive, highlighting the need for the consideration of material nonlinearity in the bonded joints. Failure modes for the joint are inferred from the observations made on the adhesive stress state in the <b>butt-strap</b> joint. Last study, deals with three dimensional analysis of a GRP-Steel hybrid joint carried out to model the initiation and propagation of crack under a set of static loading cases. Earlier studies were restricted only to two dimensional analysis. This three dimensional analysis showed that the adhesive normal stress is not constant across the width of the joint. Critical locations of stress concentrations are identified and the failure mechanisms are compared with the experimental specimens. The observations made from this research study using a three dimensional finite element program, compliments the present knowledge in the field of adhesively bonded joints. <br/...|$|E
40|$|Leaks from {{aircraft}} {{fuel tanks}} have always represented {{a problem for}} aircraft manufacturers, airline operators and maintenance crews. The integral fuel tanks within aircraft structures are typically located within the wings and they rely upon sealant materials to prevent leakage past joints and fasteners. However, the wing is designed as a structural member first and as a fuel tank second and there exist many potential leak paths for the fuel from these complex, highly loaded structures. Fuel leaks result in direct loss offuel which may be dangerous, eause a loss in revenue due to aircraft being withdravvn from service and be difficult and expensive to repair. On top ofthis there arc important health and safety issues involved in the repair of fuel tanks, for example,the Royal Australian Air Force's, F-lll Deseal Reseal Programme 1979 to 2000, where {{it was found that}} a significant number of RAAF personnel involved in the Deseal Reseal Programme were suffering from a variety ofhealth problems. Current approaches to fuel tank sealant evaluation embrace immersion in a range of different fluids at different temperatures, ofboth bulk sealant samples and sealed joints. However, nearly all such tests are ofa 'static' nature and yet it is acknowledged that joint movement leads to leaks. Thus the missing component oftesting is movement coupled with the other key variables. The aircraft industry has been searching for a relatively simpllYtest method {{that can be used to}} evaluate sealed joint systems using realistic combinations of materials, joint geometries, imposed stresses and environmental conditions. The aim ofthis project was to do exactly this. A practieal but realistic dynamic test, the Model Sealed System (MSS), was designed, made and evaluated. This unique mechanism consists ofan axial stress machine into which fatigue, high and low temperatures and pressures can be programmed for automatic operation. A novel circular lap joint lies at the heart ofthe MSS in which test sealant is sandwiched between the circular coupons that are then assembled with aerospace fasteners and sealed. This joint configuration is representative ofa wing skin <b>butt-strap</b> joint in a real aircraft. The MSS is easy to run, it accurately simulates real world dynamics and conditioning, and it provides results to qualify sealants in a more realistic manner than current testing methods provide. The MSS enables evaluation and comparative testing of sealant systems when used for interfay, fillet and overcoat applications. The information provided is complementary to that obtained from conventional small scale coupon testing; it is not seen as a substitute. Further work is require to refine the test variables and further data arc required to provide confidence in the utility ofthe MSS. Development ofthe MSS was undertaken with the support ofAirbus UK to ensure that the design, materials and all other variables met the overall requirements of a commercial aircraft manufacturer. AirbuÃ‚Â·s UK have a duplicate MSS oftheir own, installed by the author, from which they can obtain patterns ofdata for different combinations of materials and experimental variables.
