5|$|Arsenal did {{not always}} play their home matches at Highbury in the 93 years they were based there. During the Second World War the stadium {{was used as an}} ARP station and was bombed; Arsenal played their matches at White Hart Lane, home of North London rivals Tottenham Hotspur, until Highbury re-opened in 1946. More recently, Arsenal's home UEFA Champions League matches in the 1998–99 and 1999–00 seasons were played at Wembley Stadium, as Highbury's already limited {{capacity}} had to be reduced to accommodate advertising hoardings. Arsenal's record at Wembley (P6 W2 D1 L3) was relatively poor, and after two seasons the club switched back to playing at Highbury, not least <b>because</b> <b>since</b> Wembley closed for rebuilding in October 2000, {{it would not have been}} able to host their 2000–01 campaign.|$|E
5|$|Indian {{troops were}} not {{originally}} {{eligible for the}} VC, <b>because</b> <b>since</b> 1837 they had been eligible for the Indian Order of Meritthe oldest British gallantry award for general issue. When the VC was created, Indian troops were still controlled by the Honourable East India Company, and did not come under Crown control until 1860. European officers and men serving with the Honourable East India Company were not eligible for the Indian Order of Merit; the VC was extended to cover them in October 1857. It was {{only at the end}} of the 19th century that calls for Indian troops to be awarded the VC intensified. Indian troops became eligible for the award in 1911. The first awards to Indian troops appeared in the London Gazette on 7 December 1914 to Darwan Singh Negi and Khudadad Khan. Negi was presented with the VC by King George V two days earlier, on 5 December 1914, during a visit to troops in France. He is one of a small number of soldiers presented with his award before it appeared in the London Gazette.|$|E
5|$|The {{country was}} {{historically}} about evenly balanced between Catholic and Protestant, with a complex patchwork of majorities {{over most of}} the country. Geneva converted to Protestantism in 1536, just before John Calvin arrived there. It became known internationally as the Protestant Rome, being base for such reformers as Theodore Beza or William Farel. Zürich became another stronghold around the same time, with Huldrych Zwingli and Heinrich Bullinger, later joined by fleeing Peter Martyr Vermigli, taking the lead there. One canton, Appenzell, was officially divided into Catholic and Protestant sections in 1597. The larger cities and their cantons (Bern, Geneva, Lausanne, Zürich and Basel) used to be predominantly Protestant. Central Switzerland, the Valais, the Ticino, Appenzell Innerrhodes, the Jura, and Fribourg are traditionally Catholic. The Swiss Constitution of 1848, under the recent impression of the clashes of Catholic vs. Protestant cantons that culminated in the Sonderbundskrieg, consciously defines a consociational state, allowing the peaceful co-existence of Catholics and Protestants. A 1980 initiative calling for the complete {{separation of church and state}} was rejected by 78.9% of the voters. Some traditionally Protestant cantons and cities nowadays have a slight Catholic majority, not because they were growing in members, quite the contrary, but only <b>because</b> <b>since</b> about 1970 a steadily growing minority became not affiliated with any church or other religious body (21.4% in Switzerland, 2012) especially in traditionally Protestant regions, such as Basel-City (42%), canton of Neuchâtel (38%), canton of Geneva (35%), canton of Vaud (26%), or Zürich city (city: >25%; canton: 23%).|$|E

25|$|The Cainites are so-named since Hippolytus of Rome {{claims that}} they worshiped Cain, {{as well as}} Esau, Korah, and the Sodomites.

Hippolytus claims that they believed that indulgence in sin was the key to salvation <b>because</b> <b>since</b> the body is evil, one must defile it through immoral activity (see libertinism).

25|$|Trench warfare {{is highly}} {{beneficial}} to the defender if the enemy could not use tanks and line-of-sight artillery.

Thus, the task of defense force is to protect anti-tank obstacles against hostile sappers in order to coerce enemy to attack trenches with conventional infantry attack.

Michael Spence explained that signaling was fundamental in the labour market, <b>because</b> <b>since</b> employers can't know beforehand which candidate is the most productive, a college degree becomes a signaling device that a firm uses to select new personnel.|$|E
25|$|Liddell {{was buried}} in the garden behind the Japanese officers' quarters, his grave marked by a small wooden cross. The site was {{forgotten}} until it was rediscovered in 1989, in the grounds of what is now Weifeng Middle School in Shandong Province, north-east China, about six hours' drive from Beijing. Its rediscovery was largely the result of the determination of Charles Walker, an engineer working in Hong Kong, who felt one of Scotland's great heroes was in danger of being forgotten. His search for the grave proved difficult <b>because</b> <b>since</b> Liddell's death, place names had changed, documents disappeared and witnesses were difficult to find.|$|E

25|$|Some {{scholars}} claim, {{that while}} acceptance of Jordanes {{at face value}} may be too naive, a totally skeptical view is not warranted. For example, Jordanes says that the Goths originated in Scandinavia 1490 BC. Austrian historian Herwig Wolfram, believes {{that there might be}} a kernel of truth in that claim, if we assume that a clan of the Gutae left Scandinavia long before the establishment of the Amali in the leadership of the Goths. This clan might have contributed to the ethnogenesis of the Gutones in east Pomerania (see Wielbark culture). Another example is the name of the king Cniva which David S. Potter thinks is genuine <b>because,</b> <b>since</b> it doesn't appear in the fictionalized genealogy of Gothic kings given by Jordanes, he must have found it in a genuine 3rd-century source.|$|E
25|$|In 252, Sun Liang {{ascended the}} throne upon {{the death of}} his father. In January 253, he instated Lady Quan as the empress. Following that, Empress Quan's family and {{relatives}} rose to power as six members of the Quan clan (including Quan Shang) were enfeoffed as marquises and assumed high offices in the Wu government and military forces. This was regarded as a phenomenon <b>because</b> <b>since</b> the founding of Wu in 229, there had never been a case of waiqi (外戚; relatives of the emperor's wives) playing prominent roles in the Wu political scene. In 257, when Zhuge Dan (a general from Wu's rival state Cao Wei) started a rebellion in the Wei-controlled Shouchun (壽春; around present-day Shou County, Anhui), he requested help from Wu so Sun Liang ordered the Quans to lead troops to Shouchun to assist Zhuge Dan. However, the rebellion was suppressed by Wei forces and Zhuge Dan was killed, while four of the Quans surrendered and defected to Wei, thereafter the Quans' influence in Wu weakened drastically.|$|E
25|$|Since 1968, {{the castle}} has been housing {{exhibitions}} of the Slovak National Museum {{and at the}} same time its rooms have been used by the National Council of the Slovak Republic (today the National Council of the Slovak Republic) for presentation purposes. In 1992, the castle housed a branch-office of the Czechoslovak president temporarily and later in the 1990s the Slovak president temporarily. It still houses the museum and the presentation rooms for the National Council of the Slovak Republic and for the president. A new restoration has been planned for years, <b>because</b> <b>since</b> 1968 (except for adding the Hillebrandt building) only minor adaptations have been performed, such as the 1988 creation of the Treasure Chamber, the 1995 replacement of glass in the arcades of the solemn staircase, and the 1996-97 complete repair of the roof. The last minor adaptations occurred on the occasion of the Bush-Putin Bratislava summit in February 2005. A massive reconstruction was started in 2008.

25|$|Since {{the middle}} of the 19th century, {{specifically}} since the 1875 thesis by Arthur Evans, many scholars including Alexander Soloviev, Kosta Hörmann and Ćiro Truhelka have initially argued that they were related to the origin of the Bosnian Church i.e. Bogomils or other dualist groups. Others have asserted that the church was actually founded by Franciscan monks from the Catholic Church. However, Benac noted that the stećci were not built in First Bulgarian Empire, and that in Central Bosnia where were centers of Kingdom of Bosnia and Bosnian Church is smaller concentration, as well higher number of stećci of poor design, but also older date. The exclusive relation between stećci and Bogomils was propagated from the late 19th century due to political and ideological reasons, like by Béni Kállay and Austro-Hungarian authorities who promoted post-Ottoman and pan-Bosnian identity <b>because</b> <b>since</b> 1878 the territory was part of Austro-Hungarian administration, rather than scientifical reasons.

25|$|Seeing {{how fast}} the dragons can grow after feeding them a chunk of pizza, the {{children}} all drive to the beach {{in order to get}} the giants back to land so they can kill the dragons. The three nixies eventually agree to use their singing to lure the giants, and one of them is taken to the water with Nick and Jared in a surfboard (<b>because</b> <b>since</b> nixies are used to freshwater, salt water hurts their skin). Before they can accomplish this, however, Nick is taken underwater by the merfolk, who tell him how they're glad that the land-dwellers are doomed and give him a magical cap in the process that allows him to breathe underwater. The nixies manage to get some of the giants to follow them to land, where they immediately start eating the small reptiles and fighting each other again. As the children drive away from the giants, their car falls into a sinkhole and only after some time do they manage to get out. A giant then attacks them, being saved by the showing up of Jack Junior, who suddenly decided to listen to his father and come help the children kill the giants (being surprised when they reveal him that killing giants is no longer their plan).|$|E
