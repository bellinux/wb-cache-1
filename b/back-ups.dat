5|$|Maryland {{freshman}} {{wide receiver}} Torrey Smith, with his 99-yard kickoff return touchdown, broke the all-time ACC record for single-season kickoff returns with 1,089yards. Maryland running back Da'Rel Scott rushed for 174yards, earning Most Valuable Player honors alongside Nevada quarterback Colin Kaepernick who threw for 370yards. Scott set the University of Maryland's record for rushing {{yards in a}} bowl game, in what was just one-and-half quarters of playing time due to his curfew suspension. He also broke the 1,000-yard per season barrier, making him one of just seven players in school history to do so. Four Maryland <b>back-ups</b> who saw significant play due to the curfew suspensions also scored touchdowns: second-string X-receiver Torrey Smith, second-string slot receiver Ronnie Tyler, third-string slot receiver Adrian Cannon, and third-string running back Morgan Green.|$|E

25|$|Between 1960 and 1970, {{development}} of the Georgetown waterfront was studied five times. But none of the recommendations made by these studies were acted upon. Many D.C. residents, including those in Georgetown, strongly opposed {{plans to build a}} series of superhighways throughout the city — including along the Potomac River on the Georgetown waterfront. Each of the five different studies proposed the construction of superhighways in and around the area, and each time the controversy surrounding the recommendation made the study politically unpalatable. A sixth study was made in 1970. Commissioned by the National Capitol Planning Commission (NCPC) and the Georgetown Citizens' Association (GCA), the report made no recommendation to build a superhighway. Instead, it called for the demolition of the existing Whitehurst Freeway. The study's authors said the freeway blocked vistas, inhibited {{development of}} the waterfront, was poorly engineered, and caused traffic <b>back-ups</b> at both of its ends. The report urged the city to bury the freeway in an enclosed trench and sell the air rights above it to developers or use it as parkland.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} half, the Boilermakers finally scored after Kirsch passed {{for a total}} of 73 yards on an 85-yard drive that ended with his {{touchdown}} 18-yard touchdown pass to Bryant. The Irish answered on Quinn's second touchdown pass to Samardzija of 55 yards, however Kirsch cut the Irish lead once again to 21 after a 3-yard touchdown pass to Bryant. Although Quinn and Kirsch threw back-to-back interceptions, neither team scored again in the third, leaving the score 35-14. The Irish started the fourth quarter scoring with a 22-yard touchdown pass from Quinn to John Carlson, for Quinn's final series in the game, he would be replaced by <b>back-ups</b> David Wolke and Marty Mooney for the final three drives. Kirsch led the Boilermakers to a 5-yard touchdown rush by Kory Sheets for his final drive of the game, he would be replaced by Curtis Painter for their final two drives. The Irish, helped by Wolke's only completion of the game for 29 yards, scored again with a 10-yard rushing touchdown by Travis Thomas, for the final Irish score of the game. After both teams had turnovers, Painter and the Boilermakers capitalized with Sheets second rushing touchdown of 8 yards, giving the final score with the Irish winning 49-28. With Quinn's touchdown passes, he tied a Notre Dame record held by John Huarte of 10 straight games with touchdown passes, and also became the only Irish quarterback to pass for 300 yards in 3 straight games. After the game, the Irish moved up to 12th in the nation and would move up again to 9th before their next game, while the Boilermakers dropped from the rankings.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} a {{portable}} back support, the <b>Back-Up,</b> were tested in 28 variables. Both subjective and objective physical load measures were recorded during sitting with and without <b>Back-Up,</b> most of them during VDU work. The main result was that the posture of the upper back and neck/head was improved by the <b>Back-Up.</b> However, the knee straps induced unacceptable high pressure and increased significantly the discomfort in the legs. Based on these results the <b>Back-Up</b> was modified: the contact area between the strap and the knee was enlarged. This modified <b>Back-Up</b> was tested again for 13 variables with 10 new subjects. The knee pressure {{turned out to be}} acceptable and the discomfort was equal to sitting without the <b>Back-Up.</b> Based on this research the <b>Back-Up</b> is considered as a possible addition to more fundamental ergonomic improvements such as adjustable furniture and variation between sitting, standing and walking tasks, especially for improvement of the neck load. However, the <b>Back-Up</b> should not replace proper ergonomic workstation and work organization design or a backrest on the chair. Furthermore, the <b>Back-Up</b> should not be made obligatory, and it should be worn only for a part of the day, because it limits variation in postures...|$|R

500|$|The Fort Lee lane closure scandal was a U.S. {{political}} {{scandal that}} concerns New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's staff and his Port Authority political appointees conspiring {{to create a}} traffic jam in Fort Lee, New Jersey as political retribution, and their attempts to cover up these actions and suppress internal and public disclosures. Dedicated toll lanes {{for one of the}} Fort Lee entrances (used by local traffic from Fort Lee and surrounding communities) to the upper level on the George Washington Bridge, which connects to Manhattan, were reduced from three to one from September 9–13, 2013. The toll lane closures caused massive Fort Lee traffic <b>back-ups,</b> which affected public safety due to extensive delays by police and emergency service providers and disrupted schools due to the delayed arrivals of students and teachers. Two Port Authority officials (who were appointed by Christie and would later resign) claimed that reallocating two of the toll lanes from the local Fort Lee entrance to the major highways was due to a traffic study evaluating [...] "traffic safety patterns" [...] at the bridge, but the Executive Director of the Port Authority was unaware of a traffic study.|$|E

40|$|The {{inability}} to obtain additional stem cells is a disadvantage of unrelated donor cord blood transplantation (CBT). Moreover, {{in the event}} of problems with unit shipment, compromised unit quality, thaw mishaps, or graft failure, the time to secure a <b>back-up</b> graft could be unacceptable. Emergent shipment of 1 to 2 <b>back-up</b> units that have been previously typed and reserved could overcome this limitation. However, the advantages of this approach are not established. Therefore, we present our use of <b>back-up</b> units over a 5. 5 -year period. Six of 121 CBT recipients (5 %) required <b>back-up</b> unit infusion. Indications included shipment mishaps (n =  2), poor unit viability (n = 2), significant infusion reaction (n = 1), and graft failure (n = 1). Lack of <b>back-up</b> units would have caused transplantation delay or infusion of inferior-quality units. Five of the 6 patients achieved sustained donor engraftment. We demonstrate that <b>back-up</b> units are emergently required in a significant minority of patients, supporting the incorporation of at least 1 <b>back-up</b> unit in cord blood (CB) selection algorithms to enhance CBT safety...|$|R

2500|$|An ant-based {{computer}} simulation using only six interaction rules {{has also been}} used to evaluate aircraft boarding behaviour. Airlines have also used ant-based routing in assigning aircraft arrivals to airport gates. An airline system developed by Douglas A.

[...] "The pilot learns from his experience what's the best for him, {{and it turns out}} that that's the best solution for the airline," [...] Lawson explains. As a result, the [...] "colony" [...] of pilots always go to gates they can arrive and depart quickly. The program can even alert a pilot of plane <b>back-ups</b> before they happen.
