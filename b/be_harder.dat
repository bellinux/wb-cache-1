5|$|Facing {{a second}} hostage crisis, General Smith {{and other top}} UN commanders began {{shifting}} strategies. The UN began to redeploy its forces to more defensible locations, {{so that they would}} <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> to attack or take hostage. More importantly, Gen. Rose established the UN Rapid Reaction Force, a heavily armed unit with more aggressive rules of engagement, designed to take offensive action if necessary to prevent hostage-taking and enforce peace agreements.|$|E

5|$|Lobengula {{refused to}} allow any of the izinDuna to sign the document. Exactly why he did this is not clear. Rudd's {{interpretation}} was that the king considered them to have already been consulted at the day's indaba, and so {{did not think it}} necessary for them to also sign. Keppel-Jones comments that Lobengula might have felt that it would <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> to repudiate the document later if it bore the marks of his izinDuna alongside his own.|$|E

5|$|Boron nitride is a heat- and {{chemically}} resistant refractory compound of boron and nitrogen with the chemical formula BN. It exists in various crystalline forms that are isoelectronic to a similarly structured carbon lattice. The hexagonal form corresponding to graphite {{is the most}} stable and soft among BN polymorphs, and is therefore used as a lubricant and an additive to cosmetic products. The cubic (sphalerite structure) variety analogous to diamond is called c-BN; it is softer than diamond, but its thermal and chemical stability is superior. The rare wurtzite BN modification is similar to lonsdaleite and may even <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> than the cubic form.|$|E
5|$|Diamonds {{crystallize}} in {{the diamond}} cubic crystal system (space group Fdm) and consist of tetrahedrally, covalently bonded carbon atoms. A second form called lonsdaleite, with hexagonal symmetry, {{has also been}} found, but it is extremely rare and forms only in meteorites or in laboratory synthesis. The local environment of each atom is identical in the two structures. From theoretical considerations, lonsdaleite is expected to <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> than diamond, but the size {{and quality of the}} available stones are insufficient to test this hypothesis. In terms of crystal habit, diamonds occur most often as euhedral (well-formed) or rounded octahedra and twinned, flattened octahedra with a triangular outline. Other forms include dodecahedra and (rarely) cubes. There is evidence that nitrogen impurities {{play an important role in}} the formation of well-shaped euhedral crystals. The largest diamonds found, such as the Cullinan Diamond, were shapeless. These diamonds are pure (i.e. type II) and therefore contain little if any nitrogen.|$|E
5|$|Ski touring {{takes place}} off-piste {{and outside of}} ski resorts. Tours may extend over {{multiple}} days. Typically, skis, bindings, and boots allow for free movement of the heel to enable a walking pace, as with Nordic disciplines and unlike Alpine skiing. Ski touring's subgenre ski mountaineering involves independently navigating and route finding through potential avalanche terrain and often requires familiarity with meteorology along with skiing skills. Ski touring can be faster and easier than summer hiking in some terrain, allowing for traverses and ascents that would <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> in the summer. Skis {{can also be used}} to access backcountry alpine climbing routes when snow is off the technical route, but still covers the hiking trail. In some countries, organizations maintain a network of huts for use by cross-country skiers in wintertime. For example, the Norwegian Trekking Association maintains over 400 huts stretching across thousands of kilometres of trails which hikers can use in the summer and skiers in the winter.|$|E

25|$|A {{controversial}} {{new type}} of cricket ball, the white ‘Duke’, was introduced {{for the first time}} in the 1999 World Cup.

25|$|Some criteria, such as {{economic}} benefit, {{will be more}} easily measurable or definable, while others such as environmental quality will <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> to measure or express quantitatively. Ultimately though, the set of decision criteria needs to embody all of the policy goals, and overemphasising the more easily definable or measurable criteria, will have the undesirable impact of biasing the analysis towards {{a subset of the}} policy goals.|$|E
25|$|The {{decision}} {{also depends}} on the relative strengths of the team's batting and bowling. For instance in Test Cricket, a side with only fast bowlers may choose to bowl first {{to try to take}} advantage of any early moisture in the pitch, knowing that it will <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> to take wickets later in the match. Similarly a side with a weak opening batting pair may choose to bowl first in order to protect their batsmen.|$|E

25|$|Photographers {{sometimes}} use {{color temperature}} meters. These are usually designed to read only two regions along the visible spectrum (red and blue); more expensive ones read three regions (red, green, and blue). However, they are ineffective with {{sources such as}} fluorescent or discharge lamps, whose light varies in color and may <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> to correct for. Because this light is often greenish, a magenta filter may correct it. More sophisticated colorimetry tools can be used if such meters are lacking.|$|E
25|$|Another common {{application}} of case-hardening is on screws, particularly self-drilling screws. In {{order for the}} screws {{to be able to}} drill, cut and tap into other materials like steel, the drill point and the forming threads must <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> than the material(s) that it is drilling into. However, if the whole screw is uniformly hard, it will become very brittle and it will break easily. This is overcome by ensuring that only the case is hardened and the core remains relatively soft. For screws and fasteners, case-hardening is achieved by a simple heat treatment consisting of heating and then quenching.|$|E
25|$|The IRA {{declared}} a brief ceasefire in 1972 {{and a more}} protracted one in 1975, when there was an internal debate over the feasibility of future operations. The armed group reorganised itself in the late 1970s into a smaller, cell-based structure, {{which was designed to}} <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> to penetrate. The IRA now tried to carry out a smaller scale but more sustained campaign which they characterised as the 'Long War', with the eventual aim of weakening the British government's resolve to remain in Ireland. The British Army called this the 'terrorist phase' of the IRA's campaign.|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we present the {{following}} results. • Learning theory, {{and in particular}} PAC learning, was introduced by Valiant [CACM 1984] and has since become a major area of research in theoretical and applied computer science. One natural question that was posed at the very inception of the field is whether there are classes of functions that <b>are</b> <b>hard</b> to learn. PAC learning <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> under widely held conjectures such as the existence of one-way functions, {{and on the other}} hand it is known that if PAC learning <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> then P ̸ = NP. We further study sufficient and necessary conditions for PAC learning to <b>be</b> <b>hard,</b> and we prove that: 1. ZK ̸ = BPP implies that PAC learning <b>is</b> <b>hard.</b> 2. It <b>is</b> unlikely using standard techniques that one can prove that PAC learning <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> implies that ZK ̸ = BPP. 3. It is unlikely using standard techniques that one can prove that P ̸ = NP implies that ZK ̸ = BPP...|$|R
25|$|Keane {{was born}} on 8 July 1980 in Tallaght, Dublin, Republic of Ireland. His parents are Robert and Anne Keane. He started his {{football}} career with local club Fettercairn before joining Dublin schoolboy team Crumlin United {{at the age of}} 10 where his talent was seen and recognised at an early age. Keane received offers from both Liverpool and Wolverhampton Wanderers but decided to go to the First Division side, judging that it would <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> to break into the first team at Liverpool. He moved to Wolverhampton four days before his 16th birthday in July 1996, joining their youth team.|$|E

25|$|Porto and its {{surroundings}} {{is the traditional}} area of the francesinha, with many restaurants and cafés serving it. It can also be easily found in several other places across the north of Portugal. In the center and south of Portugal it may <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> to find, but there are {{an increasing number of}} restaurants, bars and cafés serving it, especially in tourist destinations like beach resorts ranging from Figueira da Foz to Albufeira. In Lisbon, a number of bars and restaurants serve varied types of francesinha, including variations served with green sauce. Francesinha standard sauce bottles have been sold in supermarkets across the entire country since the 2000s, which may be related with a growth of the sandwich's popularity outside Porto Metropolitan Area.|$|E
