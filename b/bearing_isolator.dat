40|$|Earthquake {{is one of}} {{the most}} dreadful, sudden and {{uncontrolled}} natural disasters. „Base Isolation‟ {{is one of the}} popular seismic retrofitting techniques used through-out the world. The prime objective of this study is to identify the effectiveness of a specific rubber <b>bearing</b> <b>isolator</b> in reducing the overall drift of a structure caused by lateral forces like earthquake. An 8 storey RCC building assumed to be located in the moderate seismic zone of Bangladesh is taken as a reference for this work. The building is modelled with and without base „Isolator‟ by using the finite element software „SAP 2000 ‟ and designed by adopting the building design code „ACI 318 ‟. It is evident from the research that, use of the rubber <b>bearing</b> <b>isolator</b> increases the fundamental period of vibration and the overall displacement of the structure to a greater extent. At the same time the relative storey drift decreases significantly. Though the whole work focuses on a specific example, but it paves the way for the design of rubber bearing isolators which can be used in the multi-storeyed residential buildings with confidence...|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{continuous}} {{evolution of the}} pseudo-dynamic testing method, the unrealistic testing speed still constitutes a barrier when testing loading rate-sensitive devices. A special procedure accounting for the strain-rate effect of {{two different types of}} bridge isolation devices, is presented herein. The procedure consists of a series of simple, sinusoidal-type, characterization tests conducted at different speed, which ultimately yield appropriate force-compensation factors to compensate the, otherwise ignored, strain-rate effect. The procedure is applied to characterize the dynamic response of both, a low-damping elastomeric <b>bearing</b> <b>isolator</b> and a special electro-inductive energy dissipation device. The response of a multi-span, seismically isolated highway bridge is then experimentally studied by sub-structuring, with on-line correction of measured reaction forces to account for the velocity-dependent properties of the isolation devices. The experimental results obtained showed that the procedure can be employed to account for the force modification in testing rate-dependent isolation devices at reduced speed. JRC.

40|$|Many {{buildings}} in the present scenario have irregular configurations both in plan and elevation. This in future may be subjected to devastating earthquakes. So it is also necessary to enhance the seismic performance of asymmetric buildings by using seismic control techniques. In the present study a total of 9 models, asymmetrical in plan (L-shape) are taken for analysis to cover the broader spectrum of low, medium & high rise buildings for the seismic control of the structures using pushover analysis, two different techniques were considered such as lead rubber <b>bearing</b> <b>isolator</b> and masonry infill walls, the analysis {{has been carried out}} using SAP 2000 V 15. The results of bare frame and other building models have been compared, the presence of lead rubber base isolator, top story drift get reduced as compared with masonry infill wall. The trend was found to be reversed for high rise buildings especially with the application of isolation systems due to the massive increase in the story displacements suggesting the ineffectiveness of the base isolators for high rise buildings successively the plastic hinge pattern formed after carrying out the pushover analysis was also studied which indicated that structural performance was considerably improved...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Earthquakes {{are one of}} {{the natural}} hazards that occur due to sudden violent {{movement}} of earth’s surface which releases energy and has destructive power {{in many parts of the}} world. The development of recent technologies for the control of seismic hazards catches the attention of structural engineers to make the structures seismically resistant. The seismic base isolation technique is a passive protective system. It limits the effects of the earthquake attack through a flexible base which decouples the structure from the ground motion, and the structural response accelerations are usually less than that of the ground acceleration. This technique has been incorporated and studied practically in many multi-storey structures. In the present work, a laminated rubber <b>bearing</b> <b>isolator</b> has been designed and the properties of the isolator are obtained. Then the dynamic analysis of the structure has been carried out and the performance of the building with and without isolator is studied. A parametric study has also been conducted and the results can be used in the implementation of a real time structure to improve its seismic performance.

40|$|In the paper, an {{identification}} approach {{based on a}} Genetic Algorithm (GA) {{is applied to the}} case study of a base-isolated, post-tensioned concrete bridge investigated in earlier contributions of literature. It is known that <b>bearing</b> <b>isolators</b> greatly influence the overall response of small- and medium-span bridges under dynamic loads, but in previous works it was seen that the characterisation of their elastic stiffness under small displacements may be inaccurate. In this work, based on in-situ test measurements obtained under static and dynamic loading conditions, inverse techniques based on GAs are successfully applied to the examined structural system, providing an efficient and well-calibrated structural identification of its main properties. Compared to other identification tools and classical correlation techniques, the main advantage deriving from the use of inverse approaches based on GAs typically manifests in the possibility to estimate a greater number of material parameters (e. g. properties of concrete as well as stiffness of the <b>bearing</b> <b>isolators,</b> etc.), and to critically assess the accuracy of the identification. Based on rather good correlation between test measurements and finite element (FE) model updating, it is expected that the same technique could be applied to various structural typologies and systems...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{this work}} the static {{stability}} of the uniform Timoshenko column in presence of multiple cracks, subjected to tensile or compressive loads, is analyzed. The governing differential equations are formulated by modeling the cracks as concentrated reductions of the flexural stiffness, accomplished {{by the use of}} Dirac’s delta distributions. The adopted model has allowed the derivation of the exact buckling modes and the corresponding buckling load equations of the Timoshenko multi-cracked column, as a function of four integration constant only, which are derived simply by enforcing the end boundary conditions, irrespective of the number of concentrated damage. Since shear deformability has been taken into account, the buckling load equation allows capturing both compressive and tensile buckling. The latter phenomenon has been recently investigated with reference to rubber <b>bearing</b> <b>isolators,</b> modeled as short beams, but it has been shown to occur also in slender beams characterized by high distributed shear deformation, like composite and layered beams. The influence of multiple concentrated cracks on the stability of shear deformable beams, particularly under the action of tensile loads, has never been assessed in the literature and is here addressed on the basis of an extensive parametric analysis. All the reported results have been compared with the Euler multi-cracked column in order to highlight its limits of applicability...|$|R

40|$|The {{improved}} seismic {{performance and}} cost-effectiveness of two innovative performance-enhancement technologies in typical reinforced concrete bridge construction in California were assessed in an analytical and experimental study. The technologies considered were lead rubber <b>bearing</b> <b>isolators</b> located underneath the superstructure and fiber-reinforced concrete {{for the construction}} of bridge piers. A typical five-span, single column-bent reinforced concrete overpass bridge was redesigned using the two strategies and modeled in OpenSees finite element program. Two alternative designs of the isolated bridge were considered; one with columns designed to remain elastic and the other such that minor yielding occurs in the columns (maximum displacement ductility demand of 2). The analytical model of the fiber-reinforced concrete bridge columns was calibrated using the results from two bidirectional cyclic tests on approximately ¼-scale circular cantilever column specimens constructed using concrete with a 1. 5 % volume fraction of high-strength hooked steel fibers, relaxed transverse reinforcement, and two different longitudinal reinforcement details for the plastic hinge zone. Pushover and nonlinear time history analyses using 140 ground motions were carried out for the different bridge systems. The PEER performance-based earthquake engineering methodology was used to compute the post-earthquake repair cost and repair time of the bridges. Fragility curves displaying the probability of exceeding a specific repair cost and repair time thresholds were developed. The total cost of the bridges included the cost of new construction and post-earthquake repair cost required for a 75 year design life of the structures. The intensity-dependent repair time model for the different bridges was computed in terms of crew working days representing repair efforts. A financial analysis was performed that accounted {{for a wide range of}} discount rates and confidence intervals in the estimation of the mean annual post-earthquake repair cost. Despite slightly higher initial construction costs, considerable economic benefits and structural improvements were obtained from the use of the two performance-enhancement techniques considered, in comparison to the fixed-base conventionally reinforced concrete bridge, especially seismic isolation. The isolation of the bridge superstructure resulted in a significant reduction in both column and abutment displacement and force demands. The repair time of the isolated bridges was also significantly reduced, leading to continuous operation of the highway systems and reduced indirect economic losses. The experimental and analytical results also demonstrated that the use of fiber-reinforced concrete to build bridge columns leads to improved damage-tolerance, shear strength, and energy dissipation under cyclic loading compared to conventional reinforced concrete columns. These improvements result in better seismic performance and lower total 75 -year cost of the fiber-reinforced column bridges...|$|R
40|$|Passive isolator, active {{vibration}} absorber, and {{an integrated}} passive/active (hybrid) control are studied for their effectiveness in reducing structural vibration under seismic excitations. For the passive isolator, a laminated rubber <b>bearing</b> base <b>isolator</b> {{which has been}} studied and used extensively by researchers and seismic designers is considered. An active vibration absorber concept, which can provide guaranteed closed-loop stability with minimum knowledge of the controlled system, is used to reduce the passive isolator displacement and to suppress the top floor vibration. A three-story building model {{is used for the}} numerical simulation. The performance of an active vibration absorber and a hybrid vibration controller in reducing peak structural responses is compared with the passively isolated structural response and with absence of vibration control systems under the N 00 W component of El Centro 1940 and N 90 W component of the Mexico City earthquake excitation records. The results show that the integrated passive/active vibration control system is most effective in suppressing the peak structural acceleration for the El Centro 1940 earthquake when compared with the passive or active vibration absorber alone. The active vibration absorber, however, is the only system that suppresses the peak acceleration of the structure for the Mexico City 1985 earthquake...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{research}} work {{presented in this}} paper focuses on the development of a mixed activepassive microvibration itigation solution capable of attenuating the transmitted vibrations generated by reaction wheels to a satellite structure. A representative benchmark provided by the European Space Agency (ESA) and Airbus Defence and Space, serves as a support for testing the proposed solution. The paper also covers modeling and design issues as well as a deep analysis of the solution within the H∞ /µ setting. Especially, an uncertainty modeling strategy is proposed to extract a Linear Fractional Transformation (LFT) model. Insight is naturally provided into various dynamical interactions between the plant elements such as <b>bearing</b> and <b>isolator</b> flexibility, gyroscopic effects, actuator dynamics and feedback-loop delays. The design of the mitigation solution is formulated into the H∞ /µ framework leading to a robust H ∞ control strategy capable of achieving exemplary active attenuation performance across a wide range of reaction wheel speeds.

The structural design of the bridge is characterized by some notable aspects: the river crossing is obtained by two coupled steel arches, having a span length around 115 m, and a steel-concrete composite deck sustained by thirty couples of steel hangers; the approaching spans are realized with continuous girders on intermediate supports, having cross section with variable height; the arches are supported on rubber <b>bearing</b> seismic <b>isolators.</b> The vibration measurements were nearly continuously acquired during the loading tests to detect the occurrence of anomalies in the structural behavior. In particular, the global dynamic characteristics of the structure, in terms of modal parameters, were determined using the data set of measurements at specific phases of the load test: first on the unloaded configuration, then on two different loaded configurations and finally after the bridge unloading. Measurements of vibrations due both to the ambient and to the impulse produced by a fully loaded truck passing over a bump, were carried out.

40|$|New {{residential}} buildings {{in developing countries}} often have inadequate seismic protection, particularly for masonry. Such material is widely preferred because the cost and application are relatively cheap. To decrease the vulnerability, an interesting option is represented by seismic isolation, but the cost should remain relatively low, {{and this is the}} reason why rubber isolation with few pads remains the most suitable technical solution to adopt. In this study, we deal with a newly conceived low-cost seismic isolation system for masonry buildings relying on elastomeric <b>bearings.</b> The elastomeric <b>isolator</b> here proposed consists of few layers of rubber pads and fiber lamina, making it cheaper comparing to the conventional isolators. A detailed 3 D finite element (FE) analysis to predict the behavior of the low cost rubber isolator undergoing moderate deformations is carried out. A Yeoh hyperelasticity model with coefficients estimated through available experimental data is assumed for rubber pads. Having so derived the shear behavior, such isolation system is implemented at a structural level into a two stories masonry house prototype, identifying the 3 D model with a damped nonlinear spring model, so making the FE analysis computationally inexpensive. For masonry, a concrete damage plasticity (CDP) model available in the commercial FE code Abaqus is adopted. A nonlinear static-pushover analysis is conducted to assess the performance of the isolated building. To simulate a realistic condition under seismic event, a ground motion data is applied to observe the dynamic behavior of the building by monitoring the damage level of masonry. Through a-posterior estimation, it is also possible to monitor the deformation of the isolators during the seismic excitation, to determine whether the isolator is capable of resisting shear deformations in different angles. According to the results obtained, quite good isolation is obtained with the system proposed, with immediate applicability at a structural level...|$|R
40|$|Elastomers are {{viscoelastic}} polymers {{with low}} Young's modulus and high failure strain {{that are used}} in many c ivil e ngineering applications, including bridge <b>bearings,</b> seismic <b>isolators</b> for buil dings and resilient rail wheels. Their constitutive behaviour i s characterized by a nonlinear stress - strain relation with an extensibility limit. This contrasts with materials that have instead a limit on the tensile stresses, such as mild steel. This MSc thesis is concerned with the numerical modeling of elastomers. T his involves dealing with a medium with two phases: a constrained region, wher e the particles have reached their maxi mum allowable deformation, and a free region, where the inextensibility constraint is still inactive. Moreover, one can think of an interf ace splitting the two phases of the medium. If the focus is put in obtaining methods to locate and evolve such interface, then a two phase medium with a moving interface is considered. From the mathematical point of view, this is a constrained minimization problem. One of the strategies to solve it is to turn the minimization problem into a shape equilibrium one. This approach has b een successfully employed for an interface location problem in small strains and serves as the starting point of this work. T hu s, t he main purpose of this thesis is to extend this formulation to a large strains interface locating and evolving scenario. A first analysis of the problem reveals two sources of nonlinearity : the inextensibility constraint and the kinematics in large st rains. A simple but thorough one - dimensional study of the problem is then developed to find methods to sort out both nonlinearities. Following this, explicit iterative schemes to locate and evolve one or multiple interfaces are straightforwardly obtained i n 1 D linear elasticity. However, the same ideas applied to a simple St. Venant - Kirchhoff hyperelasticity model, evidences that even very simple 1 D problems become rather complex and cannot be solved as directly and explicit as before. Numerical examples are provided throughout this analysis and they are also useful to conclude that both locating and evolving the interface can be essentially seen as the same problem, but with different driving effects. After that, an extension of the one - dimensional schemes t o two or more dimensions is explored. Although the same ideas can be applied, more sophisticated modeling tools are required, namely, the X - FEM and Level set methods, the shape sensitivity analysis and the Arbitrary Lagrangian - Eulerian methods. A complemen tary numerical implementation of the pr oposed strategy is to show its computational benefits. In particular, a combination of the three previous techniques shall make unnecessary a stepwise update of the Level set. T he work presented here may not be limite d to this particular case and be r elevant to other engineering problems involving moving interfaces and boundaries, such as plasticity analysis or the saturation of a porous medium...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The seismic {{response}} of liquid storage steel tanks with the variable frequency pendulum isolator (VFPI) is {{compared with that}} of the same liquid storage steel tanks isolated using the linear elastomeric bearings under real earthquake ground motion. In order to measure the effectiveness of isolation system, the seismic {{response of}} isolated steel tanks is {{compared with that of}} the non-isolated steel tanks. Two types of isolated tank models are considered in which the bearings are placed at the base and top of the steel tower structure. The seismic response is obtained by the Newmark’s step-by-step method. The response of two types of tanks, namely slender and broad tanks, is obtained and a parametric study is carried out to study the effects of important system parameters on the effectiveness of seismic isolation. The various important parameters considered are the tank aspect ratio, the time period of tower structure, damping and the time period of isolation system. Further, a parametric study has been carried out to examine the behavior of liquid storage steel tanks isolated with VFPIs. The important parameters considered are the friction coefficient of the VFPI, the Frequency Variation Factor (FVF) of the VFPI and the tank aspect ratio. It is observed from proposed analysis that the seismic response of elevated steel tanks accurately with significantly less computational efforts. It is concluded that seismic response, viz. the base shear, the sloshing displacement and the impulsive displacement, of liquid storage steel tanks during earthquake ground motions can be controlled with the installation of the VFPI. The linear elastomeric <b>bearings</b> and VFPI <b>isolators</b> has almost the same effect in the tank to the far-field ground motions. MATLAB software has been used for analysis and solving all dynamic equations of motion. The isolation is very effective in reducing the seismic response of elevated liquid storage tanks.
