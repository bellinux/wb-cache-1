5|$|In the past, most coat {{colors were}} found, {{including}} spotted patterns. Today most Andalusians are gray or bay; in the US, around 80 {{percent of all}} Andalusians are gray. Of the remaining horses, approximately 15 percent are bay and 5 percent are black, dun or palomino or chestnut. Other colors, such as <b>buckskin,</b> pearl, and cremello, are rare, but are recognized as allowed colors by registries for the breed.|$|E
5|$|Purebred Arabians never carry {{dilution}} genes. Therefore, purebreds {{cannot be}} colors such as dun, cremello, palomino or <b>buckskin.</b> However, there is pictorial evidence from pottery and tombs in Ancient Egypt suggesting that spotting patterns may have existed on ancestral Arabian-type horses in antiquity. Nonetheless, purebred Arabians today do not carry genes for pinto or Leopard complex ("Appaloosa") spotting patterns, except for sabino.|$|E
5|$|Mrs. R.F. Herrick bought Kinman's {{traveling}} museum {{collection of}} 186 items, {{including at least}} two of his famous chairs, and displayed them in San Francisco in 1893. She then took the collection to Chicago to display them at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, where she reportedly sold the individual items. The Clarke Historical Museum in Eureka displays a suit of his buckskins, complete with beaded moccasins, as well as a wooden chest he owned. The Ferndale Museum displays several Kinman items, including another of his <b>buckskin</b> suits.|$|E

5|$|Basingstoke's {{expansion}} has absorbed much surrounding farmland {{and scattered}} housing, transforming it into housing estates or local districts. Many {{of these new}} estates are designed as almost self-contained communities, such as Lychpit, Chineham, Popley, Winklebury, Oakridge, Kempshott, Brighton Hill, Viables, South Ham, Black Dam, <b>Buckskin</b> and Hatch Warren. The M3 acts as a buffer zone {{to the south of}} the town, and the South Western Main Line constrains the western expansion, with a green belt to the north and north-east, making Basingstoke shaped almost like a kite. As a result, the villages of Cliddesden, Dummer, Sherborne St John and Oakley, although being very close to the town limits, are considered distinct entities. Popley, Hatch Warren and Beggarwood are seeing rapid growth in housing.|$|E
5|$|Yet {{even as the}} Americans were {{attempting}} to clear the tunnels, heavy hand-to-hand fighting broke out above ground and Haldane was later awarded the Silver Star for his actions when he rushed a bunker while under fire armed only with a pistol, {{in order to give}} first aid to a number of wounded soldiers. His courage inspired his men to complete the assault, and ultimately helped ensure the successful evacuation of the casualties and the capture of their objective. That evening the battalions of US 3rd Infantry Brigade had completed searching their assigned area of operation, and the following morning they were withdrawn from the operation. The brigade's involvement in Crimp had been limited, losing six killed and 45 wounded, while 22 Viet Cong had been killed. It was subsequently redeployed on Operation <b>Buckskin.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Buckskin</b> and Cloth: A {{traditional}} dance {{from the}} South. The name {{refers to the}} type of material of which the dress is made.

The dance steps are the same for both regalia categories.|$|E
50|$|Burt McGlynn {{tried to}} sell the Minnesota <b>Buckskins</b> to local investors after the 1974 season ended. On November 6, 1974, McGlynn {{announced}} that the local interest in the <b>Buckskins</b> had dried up, and the team would either fold or be sold and moved. He mentioned that there was interest from investor groups in Indianapolis and Washington, D.C. The investor group from Indianapolis ended up buying the Loves, and the group from Washington decided not to buy the team. On November 26, 1974, WTT announced at its annual meeting that the <b>Buckskins</b> had become the first {{team in the league}} to fold.|$|R

25|$|Many foals, {{particularly}} if they are <b>buckskin,</b> smoky black, or black, are born with primitive markings such as dorsal stripes and leg bars that disappear after the foal coat sheds.
