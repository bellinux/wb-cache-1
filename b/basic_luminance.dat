40|$|Two {{experiments}} are reported which investigate {{the contribution of}} luminance boundaries to visual and audiovisual speech perception using colour, grey scale and line drawn talking faces. Use of line drawn faces should isolate <b>basic</b> <b>luminance</b> boundaries, while removing the distribution of luminance from the face. Unimodal auditory and visual syllables were combined to produce congruent (matching) and incongruent (McGurk) speech stimuli. Visual speech presented in line drawn faces was highly recognisable and influenced perception of congruent and incongruent auditory speech. However, visual speech presented in colour and grey scale faces was slightly more accurate and influential on perception of auditory speech perception than visual speech presented in line drawn faces. In light of these findings, the role of luminance boundaries in perception of visual and audiovisual speech is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Stimulation {{elicited}} by a {{real world}} {{field of view}} is directly connected with the colour information reaching the cornea and the position where this information is received within the retina: different spectral power distribution of light determine different responses. Evaluation of stimulation provided by a given field of view can be performed in a quick but accurate way by measuring spectral irradiance with a spectroradiometer and apply to incoming data an efficiency curve weighting. However, this can be insufficient for an accurate understanding {{of the origin of}} a stimulation: the proposed method allow an overall evaluation of the field of view based on <b>basic</b> spectral and <b>luminance</b> measures and a script that processes gathered luminous information. The final aim of this approach and calculation model is to provide further information about the direction of light reaching the retina, providing a qualitative evaluation of the field of view, allowing to know how much stimulation is due to a specific type of surface or is coming from a certain area within the visual field. This approach can have many practical implications, allowing technicians and designers to modify visual fields in order to properly shape the features, of stimulation throughout the day, hence following a field of view-based dynamic design...|$|R
40|$|Electroretinograms (e. r. g. s) and {{visually}} evoked potentials (v. e. p. s) to pattern stimuli were recorded simultaneously from healthy subjects. The stimuli were {{produced by a}} configuration in which the luminance of two sets of spatial elements (checks) could be modulated independently. Experiments were designed to distinguish between contrast responses and non-linear luminance responses. In {{the first of two}} <b>basic</b> experiments, the <b>luminance</b> of only one set of checks was modulated, at a constant level in every trial. The other set was not modulated, but its luminance was set at various levels. Under these conditions the local luminance stimulation was kept equal for every trial whereas the contrast stimulation varied. Therefore, local luminance responses in these experiments were expected to be constant and contrast responses were expected to vary. The e. r. g. s were identical for all luminance settings of the unmodulated checks, suggesting that luminance rather than contrast determines the response. The v. e. p. s showed, on the contrary, the behaviour expected for contrast responses. In the second basic experiment the local luminance stimulation was also kept constant, but the phase difference between the modulations of the two sets of checks was varied between 0 deg (pure luminance stimulation) and 180 deg (pattern reversal). In this type of experiment the second harmonic responses to local luminance modulation are expected to decrease to a minimum as phase difference goes from 0 to 90 deg and increase again as phase difference goes to 180 deg. Contrast responses are expected to increase monotonically from zero to maximal at phase difference shifts from 0 deg (no contrast stimulation) to 180 deg (contrast reversal). The e. r. g. s decreased to a minimum at 90 deg phase difference and increase again with phase difference going to 180 deg. At 0 and 180 deg the same value was recorded. Consequently, the e. r. g. behaviour suggests a luminance origin of the responses. The v. e. p. s monotonically increased as phase difference went from 0 to 180 deg, thus suggesting a contrast origin of the responses. Two additional control experiments were performed. The first experiment compared the responses to homogeneous field red/green exchange and pattern red/green exchange, with the luminances of the red and green sources matched by heterochromatic flicker photometry. The exchange of luminance-matched red and green checks (pattern reversal) did not produce different e. r. g. responses from those recorded in response to homogeneous field red/green exchange. The v. e. p. showed a significant increase for the pattern stimulus. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS...|$|R
