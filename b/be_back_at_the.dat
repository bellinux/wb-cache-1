25|$|A {{condition}} with this task is that candidates {{are advised to}} arrive back at the boardroom, or designated finish line, by a certain time or receive a fine for lateness; in this instance, the candidates had to <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> boardroom by 5:30pm on this task. Although {{there appeared to be}} considerable uncertainty over whether Impact's sub-team of Saira, Paul and Raj would arrive back in time, it was later revealed that they had done so comfortably ahead of the deadline, and had been told to wait outside for a while by the production crew in order to add a degree of suspense to the final edit.|$|E
25|$|Lehto {{was back}} for the San Marino Grand Prix and Andrea de Cesaris would be the second driver at Jordan. However, the weekend {{got off to a}} bad start as Rubens Barrichello had a major crash during {{practice}} and was knocked unconscious. Coming too fast into Variante Bassa, his car was launched into the air by the kerb. Less than a yard from that kerb was a tyre wall, which almost instantly stopped the car's forward motion. His car was flipped over and landed upside down. Barrichello had swallowed his tongue and his life was only saved by quick action from the medical team. He would <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> circuit on the Saturday afternoon with a fractured nose, bandaged arm and cut lip. Barrichello has never been able to recall anything from the incident.|$|E
500|$|Critchell re-signed for Weymouth on {{a two-year}} {{contract}} {{for an undisclosed}} fee on 9 August 2012, with the club now in the Southern League Premier Division. He explained the transfer by saying [...] "The biggest reason why I have come back is seeing everyone smiling and being positive again. The right atmosphere seems to <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> club and that can only {{bode well for the}} future".|$|E

500|$|Feynman {{nominally}} held {{an appointment}} at the University of Wisconsin–Madison {{as an assistant}} professor of physics, but was on unpaid leave during his involvement in the Manhattan project. In 1945, he received a letter from Dean Mark Ingraham of the College of Letters and Science requesting his return to the university to teach in the coming academic year. His appointment was not extended when he did not commit to returning. In a talk given there several years later, Feynman quipped, [...] "It's great to <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> only university that ever {{had the good sense to}} fire me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sutcliffe is {{especially}} noted for an innings of 80 not out against South Africa in Johannesburg on Boxing Day 1953. New Zealand's batsmen were routed by South African fast bowler Neil Adcock on a green wicket. Sutcliffe {{was hit in}} the head by Adcock and, having left the field to receive hospital treatment, returned to the crease swathed in bandages. He took on the bowling, hitting a number of sixes, until the ninth wicket fell. The New Zealand fast bowler Bob Blair, next man in, was understood to <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> team hotel distraught as his fiancee had been killed in the Tangiwai disaster two days earlier. Sutcliffe started to walk off only to see Blair walk out. Despite the presence of 23,000 fans, silence enveloped the ground. 33 runs were added in 10 minutes before Blair was out. New Zealand lost the Test match by a considerable margin. Notwithstanding this, the noted New Zealand cricket writer Dick Brittenden said: [...] "It was a great and glorious victory, a story every New Zealand boy should learn at his mother's knee".|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to environmental and health costs at home, China's dependence on coal {{is cause for}} concern on a global scale. Due {{in large part to}} the emissions caused by burning coal, China is now the number one producer of carbon dioxide, responsible for a full quarter of the world's CO2 output. According to a recent study, [...] "even if American emissions were to suddenly disappear tomorrow, world emissions would <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same level within four years as a result of China’s growth alone." [...] The country has taken steps towards battling climate change by pledging to cut its carbon intensity (the amount of CO2 produced per dollar of economic output) by about 40 per cent by 2020, compared to 2005 levels. Reuters reports that [...] "emissions and coal consumption will continue to rise through the 2020s, even though at a slower rate, barring a major intervention including a shift to cleaner burning gas from coal" [...] - in other words, [...] "meeting the carbon intensity target will require a significant change in trajectory for carbon emissions and coal consumption." [...] To that end, China has announced a plan to invest 2.3 trillion yuan ($376 billion) through 2015 in energy saving and carbon emission-reduction projects.|$|E
