30|$|The {{correlation}} between the wear behavior of a heavy commercial vehicle (HCV) <b>brake</b> <b>liner</b> tested under controlled laboratory conditions and that in actual field conditions is investigated. A <b>brake</b> <b>liner</b> study for friction and wear is performed on an inertia brake dynamometer (IBD) at different temperatures (200 °C, 250 °C, and 300 °C) using 6000 brake actuations in a laboratory. The total wear loss of the <b>brake</b> <b>liner</b> at three different temperatures for 6000 brake actuations in IBD {{is found to be}} 1.12 mm. The actual field test is conducted on four different HCVs, namely, a city bus (CB), a high speed bus (HSB), a highway truck (HWT), and a tipper lorry (TL). These HCVs run at different terrain/traffic conditions and load conditions. When comparing the predicted life of the <b>brake</b> <b>liner</b> through the IBD test with the actual life of the <b>brake</b> <b>liner</b> in different HCVs, a vast difference is observed. Due to the large variation of liner life observed between the actual and predicted tests, an extensive field test is conducted. In the field test, the liner with identical formulation is fitted in the four types of HCVs. The predicted life of the liner using IBD is then correlated with the field test observation and a correlation factor is determined. Based on this correlation factor, the predicted life of the liner and the achieved life on the HCV are found to be fairly close. This study will be useful to design the friction material formulation and to predict the actual life of the <b>brake</b> <b>liner</b> for various HCVs.|$|E

40|$|Performance of a {{brake system}} in a vehicle is mainly {{determined}} by the tribological characteristics of a friction couple, which is composed of frictional material and a gray iron disk (or drum).,The friction liner material, in particular, is considered as an important part {{for the performance of}} a vehicle, and is often blamed for various brake-induced problems such as low wear, fade phenomena,low coefficient of friction,. This is true because the modification of brake performance by changing the friction material and its composition is relatively easier for the vehicle manufacturer rather than altering other specifications of brake systems. As a result the <b>brake</b> <b>liner</b> industry has seen the birth of different brake pads and shoes in the past decade each with their own unique composition yet performing the very same task and claiming to be better than others. Present paper suggests that the selection of brake friction materials is based more on tradition and experimental trial and error rather than fundamental understanding.

40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this paper is to discuss a linear {{vibratory}} part feeder for handling <b>brake</b> <b>liners,</b> typical sector-shaped components. Part feeders have been used in the industries for a long time to present the parts in a desired orientation. Berretty et al. (1999) discussed a class of mechanical filters that are capable of removing polygonal sections from the track of the feeder which are referred to as traps. The traps eliminate or reorient the parts until they reach the final desired orientation. A part feeder was developed using traps, to reorient the sector-shaped part to desired orientation. The desired orientation was the most probable natural resting orientation. The trap was mounted on a linear vibratory feeder. The adaptive part feeder developed was capable of identifying the size of the incoming part and adjust the trap to accommodate that. This set-up eliminates the use of different traps for different-sized sector-shaped parts and wastage of productive time in changing the traps for different sizes. A regression model was developed to predict the conveying velocity of part on the feeder. Design/methodology/approach A part feeder was developed using traps, to reorient the sector-shaped part to desired orientation. Acrylic material was found to be suitable for trap compared to aluminium. The adaptive part feeder developed was capable of identifying the size of the incoming part using proximity sensors. Depending on the size of the incoming part, the track width was adjusted dynamically with the help of a stepper motor, rack and pinion arrangement. A regression model was developed to predict the conveying velocity. Findings Typical <b>brake</b> <b>liners</b> in the size range of 40 - 60 mm (radius) were considered for developing the adaptive part feeder. Based on performance studies, the acrylic trap was found better than aluminium traps. The appropriate frequency and amplitude of vibration for maximum conveying velocity of the adaptive part feeder were found experimentally. Regression equation was developed to determine the conveying velocity based on input frequency and amplitude. The regression results were found to be in close agreement with the experimental results. Research limitations/implications The developed part feeder is suitable for handling sector-shaped parts only. Originality/value This paper demonstrates an inexpensive adaptive part feeding device for handling sector-shaped parts which can be extended for handling other asymmetric parts also...|$|R
40|$|On {{the basis}} of {{turbulence}} measurements near a motorway, a parametrisation of the motorway-induced turbulence was developed and integrated in the KAMM/DRAIS model system for simulation of the transport and chemical conversion of air pollutants near a motorway. There are two different mechanisms by which the motorway influences the turbulence field, i. e. vehicle-induced turbulence and turbulence production by air flow across the motorway dam, which acts as a flow obstacle. Both effects were identified in the measured turbulence field and were parametrized. The new parametrization can be verified by a comparison of measured vertical profiles {{of the difference in}} CO concentration between the windward side and the lee side of the motorway {{on the one hand and}} measured vertical concentration profiles of a tracer in a published dispersion experiment comprising model results. The full parametrization of the motorway-induced turbulence is required for a correct description of the exhaust plume height and the maximum concentration at ground level. In another section, the dispersion of coarse dust emitted on the mtorway (caused by tyre abrasion, <b>brake</b> <b>liner</b> abrasion, road surface, resuspension) is simulated. The simulated concentration distributions on the lee side of the motorway suggest a strong influence of motorway-induced turbulence. The range of particle dispersion depends largely on their diameter. Large-diameter particles (100 #mu#m) are dispersed over several meters while small particles (1 #mu#m) behave like an inert gas. The characteristic measured size distributions of th coarse dust can be explained by the model calculations.

40|$|Abstract: Recent {{attention}} is focused on issues of utilization of industrial wastes. The paper deals with the Tribological characteristics of Al 356 alloy reinforced with red mud of different volume fractions. Red mud is a gangue produced during the extraction of alumina, disposal of which has become a major issue. In recent years, the utilization of red mud as a filler material has increased due to its chemical composition, which includes metals like Fe 2 O 3, Al 2 O 3, Na 2 O and TiO 2, etc. These metals exhibit good wear characteristics. The red mud collected from Malco, TamilNadu, India, is preheated in the furnace up to 500 o C and 53 micron sized particles are mixed with Al 356 alloy. Al MMC disc is manufactured by stir casting technique using Al 356 alloy reinforced with different volume percentage (5 %, 10 %, 15 % and 20 %) of red mud. Pins of 10 mm diameter are machined from the <b>brake</b> shoe <b>liner</b> of commercial passenger car. The wear tests are then carried out on a pin-on-disc machine [...] Wear rate is calculated for different percentage of reinforcement under different test conditions. The wear grooves formed on the Al MMC disc for all percentage of red mud are analyzed using optical micrograph. The results show that applied load and sliding velocity have significant influence on wear rate of composite. The co-efficient of friction decreases when the load increases. Experimental analysis is carried using Taguchi’s Design of Experimen...|$|R
40|$|Intense reseach in {{material}} science {{has been directed}} towards {{the development of new}} light-weight engineering materials possessing high specific strength and stiffness at elevated temperatures combined with good creep, fatigue and wear resistance. Advanced automotive and aerospace technologies require such material specification for enhanced performance. These properties are not achievable with light weight monolithic titanium, aluminium and magnesium alloys. Hence designers resort to composite materials such as Fiber Reinforced Plastics (FRP), Metal Matrix Composites (MMC) and Ceramic Matrix Composites (CMC). The density of most MMC's is approximately one third that of steel, resulting in high specific strength and stiffness. MMC's find application in different industries like aerospace (for fuselage of space shuttle orbiter, vertical tail section of advanced fighter planes), automobile engine parts (piston, cylinder <b>liners,</b> <b>brake</b> drums), sports equipment and shipping application etc.,. Especially aluminium alloys reinforced with silicon carbide are relatively new, potentially useful structural materials with high specific stregth and modulus values. Although components made of these materials, can be produced by near-net-shape manufacturing, they usually require subsequent machining to attain the desired geometry, assembling tolerance and surface integrity. However, being non-hoogeneous, anisotropic and reinforced b abrasive components, these materials are difficult t achne. Machinability {{is one of the major}} problems, which restricts the wide spread engineering application of meal matrix composites. Grinding is partislarly needed to acquire controlled specifications such as high dimensional acuracy and surface finish. The presen study is concerned with evaluation of grindability of Al/SiCp composite in terms of work material and wheel material response to grinding environment. Surface grinding was carried out on a tool and cutter grinder and the performance indicators namely grinding force, temperature, acoustc emision (AE) and vibration induced were monitored online.
