40|$|Abstract: Paclitaxel (1 a), a {{well known}} {{antitumor}} agent adopted mainly {{for the treatment}} of breast and ovarian cancer, suffers from significant disadvantages such as low solubility, certain toxicity and specific drug-resistance of some tumor cells. To overcome these problems extensive research has been carried out. Among the various proposed strategies, the conjugation of paclitaxel (1 a) to a <b>biocompatible</b> <b>polymer,</b> such as hyaluronic acid (HA, 2), has also been considered. Coupling a bioactive compound to a <b>biocompatible</b> <b>polymer</b> offers, in general, many advantages such as better drug solubilization, better stabilization, specific localization and controlled release. Hereafter the design, synthesis and applications of hyaluronic acid-paclitaxel bioconjugates are reviewed. An overview of HA-paclitaxel combinations is also given...|$|E

The case studies extend the portfolio of detailed, highly contextualised studies of innovation in the Australian context. They also provide a window into CSIRO, commercialisation pathways and the national system of innovation in Australia. In particular, they highlight the paradox of public science and global business in the Australian context. The paradox is that global business depends upon public science for innovation more than ever, but makes it increasingly difficult for countries to capture the benefits of public science. It adds major complexity to the successful realisation of a more commercial approach by Australia's public research organisations such as CSIRO, and the capture of benefits from the national system of innovation...|$|R

The available forms of <b>biocompatible</b> orthopaedic <b>polymer</b> and their methods of application are described and the results obtained with their use are compared with the pre-operative clinical observations. Of the 17 patients studied, pain disappeared in 14, unlimited walking became possible in seven, while another eight patients were subsequently able to walk for over 300 m. Mobility became normal in 13 cases; full weight bearing on one leg became possible in 12 cases and became normal in another four.
