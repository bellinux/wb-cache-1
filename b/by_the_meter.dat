25|$|To {{avoid the}} loading of the {{measured}} circuit {{by the current}} drawn <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>meter</b> movement, some analog multimeters use an amplifier inserted between the measured circuit and the meter movement. While this increases the expense {{and complexity of the}} meter, by use of vacuum tubes or field effect transistors the input resistance can be made very high and independent of the current required to operate the meter movement coil. Such amplified multimeters are called VTVMs (vacuum tube voltmeters), TVMs (transistor volt meters), FET-VOMs, and similar names.|$|E
25|$|When {{households}} are not charged for the reactive power they consume {{there is almost}} no monetary incentive for them to install power factor correction equipment. This is generally the case today, as household electric meters do not measure apparent power but only real power. Adding power factor correction merely affects the reactive power supplied or drawn and not real power, so utility costs are unaffected. However if there are high-resistance lines connected between the utility meter and a relatively high load then the power as measured <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>meter</b> can be reduced by a small amount with power factor correction. Any such savings are usually insignificant.|$|E
25|$|This {{exported}} energy may {{be accounted}} for in the simplest case <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>meter</b> running backwards during periods of net export, thus reducing the customer's recorded energy usage by the amount exported. This in effect results in the customer being paid for his/her exports at the full retail price of electricity. Unless equipped with a ratchet or equivalent, a standard meter will accurately record power flow in each direction by simply running backwards when power is exported. Where allowed by law, utilities maintain a profitable margin between the price of energy delivered to the consumer and the rate credited for consumer-generated energy that flows back to the grid.|$|E

6000|$|There {{is another}} case, {{a very strong}} one, {{and that is the}} case of presents, which I {{understand}} is a custom admitted throughout Asia in all their governments. It was of a person who was raised to a high office; no business was suffered to come before him without a previous present. [...] "One morning, the king being at this time on a hunting party, the nazar came to the tent of the king, but was denied entrance <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>meter,</b> or master of the wardrobe. About the same time the king came forth, and, seeing the nazar, commanded his officers to take off the bonnet from the head of that dog that took gifts from his people, and that he should sit three days bareheaded {{in the heat of the}} sun, and as many nights in the air. Afterwards he caused him to be chained about the neck and arms, and condemned him to perpetual imprisonment, with a mamoudy a day for his maintenance; but he died for grief within eight days after he was put in prison." ...|$|E

50|$|Meter {{is another}} matter. It is an {{ordering}} of language {{by means of}} an extremely limited subset of its characteristics.

50|$|Shared taxis-and {{they are}} known by that exact name-have been {{operating}} in Mumbai, India, since the early 1970s.

50|$|It is {{possible}} to make a meter reading of an individual scene element, but the exposure indicated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>meter</b> will render that element as a medium gray; {{in the case of}} a dark object, that result is usually not what is desired.

5000|$|While tempo is {{described}} or indicated {{in many different}} ways, it is only measured in beats per minute (bpm).

50|$|As an {{ohmmeter}} the Model 8 Mark II measures from 1 Ω up to 20 MΩ {{in three}} ranges. The instrument has an accuracy of ±1% of FSD on DC current ranges, ±2% of FSD on DC voltage ranges, ±2.25% of FSD on all AC ranges and ±5% of reading (at centre scale only) on resistance ranges. Its maximum current draw of 50 μA at full-scale deflection (corresponding to 20,000 ohms per volt) is sufficient {{in most cases}} to reduce voltage measurement error due to circuit loading <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>meter</b> to an acceptable level.|$|E

50|$|Many of Pinot-Gallizio's {{works were}} {{industrial}} paintings. Rather {{than a small}} image to be interpreted, these huge canvases were intended to cover a large area.

50|$|Pizza (locally {{pronounced}} pisa or pitsa), {{has been}} wholly included into Uruguayan cuisine, {{and in its}} Uruguayan form more closely resembles an Italian calzone than it does its Italian ancestor.

While Uruguayan pizza derives from Neapolitan cuisine, the Uruguayan fugaza (fugazza) comes from the focaccia xeneise (Genoan), {{but in any case}} its preparation is different from its Italian counterpart, and the addition of cheese to make the dish (fugaza con queso or fugazzeta) started in Argentina or Uruguay.|$|E
