25|$|Three oracles had {{successively}} {{operated in}} Delphi – the chthonion using egkoimisi (procedure that involved {{sleeping in the}} Holy place, so as to see a revealing dream), the Kliromanteion and finally the Apollonian, with the laurel. <b>But</b> <b>ever</b> since {{the introduction of the}} cult of Dionysus at Delphi, the god that brought his followers into ecstasy and madness, the Delphic god gave oracles through Pythia, who also fell into a trance under the influence of vapors and fumes coming from the opening, the inner sanctum of the Oracle. Pythia sat on top of a tall gilded tripod that stood above the opening. In the old days, Pythia was a virgin, young girl, <b>but</b> <b>ever</b> since Echecrates from Thessaly fell in love, kidnapped and violated a young and beautiful Pythia, a woman older than fifty years old was chosen, who dressed and wore jewelry to resemble a young maiden girl. According to tradition, Phemonoe was the first Pythia.|$|E

500|$|Potter was an unsentimental naturalist {{who thought}} no {{creature}} either good or bad, {{and had no}} qualms describing earwigs in Mrs. Tittlemouse's passage or woodlice in her pantry. Her publisher Harold Warne however had different ideas about what was appropriate for a children's book. He had become accustomed to Potter's unusual choice of animal subjects through the years, <b>but,</b> <b>ever</b> sensitive to public reaction, thought she had gone a bit too far in Mrs. Tittlemouse with the earwig and the woodlice. [...] The earwig was, at his behest, transmogrified into a beetle and the woodlice into [...] "creepy-crawly people" [...] hiding in Mrs. Tittlemouse's plate rack. [...] "I can alter the text, when I get the proofs," [...] she wrote, [...] "and will erase the offensive word 'wood-lice'!" [...] Potter argued for the generic term [...] "slaters" [...] for the woodlice, but was overruled. It was decided that an illustration of a centipede (Miss Maggie Manylegs) would be withdrawn and replaced with a butterfly.|$|E
500|$|Handlen {{felt that}} the {{character}} development of Carl Grimes was more stable than similar developments in the episode; [...] "Using Carl to both resolve the episode’s plot, and making him semi-responsible for Dale’s death, has a satisfying neatness, {{and serves as a}} reminder that for all their talk, Rick and the group have no idea what impact their choices will make." [...] Likewise, Jackson and Ryan Rigley of MTV noticed the darker transition of the character; [...] "Carl's moral compass has greatly shifted since being shot and seeing the walking corpse of his friend, Sophia," [...] asserted Rigley. Jackson concluded {{that it was one of}} the episode highlights, writing, [...] "He awakened from his coma talking about the beautiful doe, <b>but</b> <b>ever</b> since the dead body of Sophia limped its way out of that barn door, he's become colder and harder. When Carol sees him at Sophia’s gravesite, she tries to comfort him with talk of heaven, and he calls her an idiot. He's looking to emulate the men leading the group—the different kinds of toughness displayed by his father, Shane and Daryl. And he finds the chance to test his own bravery, playing near a zombie stuck in the mud by the creek, keeping the discovery to himself." [...] Jackson commented on Carl's reaction to the death of Dale, saying that despite a gradual change to a dark nature, he [...] "realizes [...] that he's still very much a kid".|$|E

500|$|Santos {{called the}} {{character}} designs memorable, {{and found it}} refreshing that the anime featured an overweight person {{as one of its}} main characters. He noted that the backgrounds, while making use of muted and grayish tones, still had enough color to be visually appealing. One area he was disappointed with was how the series often makes use of [...] "talking head" [...] shots with little animation and low framerates. He found the music to set the mood well, but also that [...] "nothing particularly stands out". Silverman thought that the series' visuals were uneven for the first half, having some [...] "nice visual flair" [...] at some points, such as a black-and-white scene in episode 11, and some fan-service shots that she found ill-fitting. For the second half, she found the visuals and audio design to have improved, with a focus on visual themes such as clasped hands, and the use of highly detailed and more realistic art during stressful moments in the story. Foote enjoyed the visual presentation of Akihabara, which he described as [...] "lifeless <b>but</b> <b>ever</b> moving, like sand in the desert wind"; he called it evocative of morning street scenes in the directors' earlier work Serial Experiments Lain (1998), and proof that they had not lost their touch since then. Drew thought the visuals were of high quality throughout the series, and that they were a good, albeit less detailed, representation of the art style used in the Steins;Gate game.|$|E

2500|$|Instead of {{a literal}} reading, George Slatyer Barrett viewed the third temptation as inclining to a doubt of Christ's mission, {{or at least}} the methodology. Barrett sees this as a temptation to accept the {{adulation}} of the crowds, assume leadership of the nation to overthrow Roman rule, take the crown of his own nation, and from there initiate the kingdom of God on earth. The kingdoms Jesus would inherit through Satan are obtained through love of power and political oppression. Barrett characterizes this as [...] "...the old <b>but</b> <b>ever</b> new temptation to do evil that good may come; to justify the illegitimacy of the means by the greatness of the end." ...|$|E

The Kurozuka Theatre uses a shōji instead of a curtain in front and behind it, and the story is told by an elaborate robot {{in the shape of the}} onibaba, and it was performed in the style of having two stages where midway through the guests would turn around 180 degrees for the performance to continue on the other side, <b>but</b> <b>ever</b> since the [...] "Furusato-Mura" [...] has been open to all free of charge, the Kurozaki Theatre has closed and it is now no longer possible to see it.|$|E
2500|$|Buckley was an {{advocate}} for the legalization of marijuana and some drug legalization as early as his 1965 candidacy for mayor of New York City. He wrote a pointed pro-marijuana legalization piece for National Review in 2004 where he calls for conservatives to change their views on legalization, stating, [...] "We're {{not going to find}} someone running for president who advocates reform of those laws. What is required is a genuine republican groundswell. It is happening, <b>but</b> <b>ever</b> so gradually. Two of every five Americans [...] believe 'the government should treat marijuana {{more or less the same}} way it treats alcohol: It should regulate it, control it, tax it, and make it illegal only for children.'" [...] In his December 3, 2007 column, shortly after his wife's death, which he attributed, at least in part, to her smoking, Buckley seemed to advocate banning tobacco use in America.|$|E

The party campaign also tied economic crisis on the continent with the Socrates government and reinforced the link to the regional PS government under Carlos Cesar, highlighting that [...] "in the Azores, the situation is no different"; there was a veiled reference to subterfuge by the Cesar government and financial situation in the region. In addition, she defended that a PSD government would implement policies that would reduce the number of full-time politicians, reduce sumptuous governmental consumption (such as equalization subsidies for ministers, the expensive hotel stays in Lisbon), and frugal public spending, that would allow more funds for the middle class and disadvantaged in society.|$|E

2500|$|Halleck, more a bureaucrat than a soldier, {{was able}} to impose little {{discipline}} or direction on his field commanders. Strong personalities such as George B. McClellan, John Pope, and Ambrose Burnside routinely ignored his advice and instructions. A telling example of his lack of control was during the Northern Virginia Campaign of 1862, when Halleck was unable to motivate McClellan to reinforce Pope in a timely manner, contributing to the Union defeat at the Second Battle of Bull Run. It was from this incident that Halleck fell from grace. Abraham Lincoln {{said that he had}} given Halleck full power and responsibility as general in chief. [...] "He ran it on that basis till Pope's defeat; <b>but</b> <b>ever</b> since that event he has shrunk from responsibility whenever it was possible."In Halleck's defense, his subordinate commanders in the Eastern Theater, whom he did not select, were reluctant to move against General Robert E. Lee and the Army of Northern Virginia. Many of his generals in the West, other than Grant, also lacked aggressiveness. And despite Lincoln's pledge to give the general in chief full control, both he and Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton micromanaged many aspects of the military strategy of the nation. Halleck wrote to Sherman, [...] "I am simply a military advisor of the Secretary of War and the President, and must obey and carry out what they decide upon, whether I concur in their decisions or not. As a good soldier I obey the orders of my superiors. If I disagree with them I say so, but when they decide, is my duty faithfully to carry out their decision." ...|$|E
