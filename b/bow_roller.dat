50|$|Model in {{production}} 1981 to 1982 with 56 produced. It was {{identical to the}} Mark III, expect that the forestay was moved back about 4 in to accommodate a <b>bow</b> <b>roller.</b> It has an internally-mounted spade-type rudder, displaces 5500 lb and carries 2116 lb of lead ballast. The boat has a draft of 4.25 ft with the standard keel. The boat is fitted with a Japanese two-cylinder Yanmar 2GM diesel engine. The boat has a hull speed of 6.42 kn.|$|E
40|$|In general, {{fabric is}} {{heat-treated}} using a stenter machine {{in order to}} dry and fix its shape. It is important to shape before the heat treatment because {{it is difficult to}} revert back once the fabric is formed. To produce the product of right shape, camera type weft straightener has been applied recently to capture and process fabric images quickly. It is more powerful in determining the final textile quality rather than photo-sensor. Positioning in front of a stenter machine, weft straightener helps to spread fabric evenly and control the angle between warp and weft constantly as right angle by handling skew and bow rollers. To process this tricky procedure, the structural analysis should be carried out in advance, based on which, its control technology can be drawn. A structural analysis is to figure out the specific contact/slippage characteristics between fabric and roller. We already examined the applicability of camera type weft straightener to plain weave fabric and found its possibility and the specific working condition of machine and rollers. In this research, we aimed to explore another applicability of camera type weft straightener. Namely, we tried to figure out camera type weft straightener can be used for fabrics. To find out the optimum condition, we increased the number of rollers. The analysis is done by ANSYS software using Finite Element Analysis method. The control function is demonstrated by experiment. In conclusion, the structural analysis of weft straightener is done to identify a specific characteristic between roller and fabrics. The control of skew and <b>bow</b> <b>roller</b> is done to decrease the error of the angle between warp and weft. Finally, it is proved that camera type straightener can also be used for the special fabrics...|$|E

25|$|Grasp has {{heavy lift}} system that {{consists}} of large <b>bow</b> and stern <b>rollers,</b> deck machinery, and tackle. The rollers serve as low-friction fairlead for the wire rope or chain used for the lift. The tackle and deck machinery provide up to 75 tons of hauling for each lift. The two <b>bow</b> <b>rollers</b> can be used together with linear hydraulic pullers to achieve a dynamic lift of 150 tons. The stern rollers {{can be used with}} the automatic towing machine to provide a dynamic lift of 150 tons. All four rollers can be used together for a dynamic lift of 300 tons or a static tidal lift of 350 tons.|$|R

50|$|Crew {{size was}} about 120 men {{including}} the complement of divers, made complete with some unique features found onboard. Two fire monitors, capable of pumping out 4000 {{gallons of water}} per minute onto a flaming deck, aided in rescue efforts. A full machine shop allowed patches to be cut and assembled, repairing damaged hulls long enough to return to port for any major repairs. The forward boom could lift up to 20 tons while the one aft, on the fantail, had a maximum lift of 8 tons. Also on the fantail was the Almon Johnson Towing machine which held 2100 feet of 2 inch wire rope capable of a maximum pull of 50 tons.Further, in her salvage holds was an extensive inventory of portable salvage equipment- pumps, generators, and welding machines of various sizes that could be placed wherever needed. Plus, eight complete legs of beach gear, each capable of generating up to 60 tons of pulling power, were maintained onboard. The ships could lift up to 150 tons off {{the bottom of the}} ocean with its main <b>bow</b> <b>rollers</b> and an additional 30 tons on its auxiliary <b>bow</b> <b>rollers.</b> A recompression chamber was available for treating diving related sicknesses and the MK-5 Surface Supplied Diving System was in use.|$|R
50|$|During {{the rolling}} process the <b>rollers</b> <b>bow</b> slightly, {{which results in}} the sheets being thinner on the edges. The {{tolerances}} in the table and attachments reflect current manufacturing practices and commercial standards and are not representative of the Manufacturer's Standard Gauge, which has no inherent tolerances.|$|R
60|$|Forester {{ordered the}} crew ashore, {{at a place}} where there was a road leading down to the water's edge. This road was made by the teams which came down to get logs and lumber from the water. At Forester's direction, the boys drew the bow of the boat up a little way upon the land. Then he ordered the boys to take out the pieces of the stem of the little tree, and he placed one of them under the <b>bow</b> as a <b>roller.</b> The boys then took hold of the sides of the boat, three on each side, each boy {{opposite}} to his own row-lock, while Marco stood ready to put under another roller. The ascent was very gradual, so that the boat moved up easily, and the boys were very much surprised and delighted to see their boat thus running up upon the land.|$|R
