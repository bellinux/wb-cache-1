5|$|Significant {{amounts of}} iron {{occur in the}} iron sulfide mineral pyrite (FeS2), <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> to extract iron from it and it is {{therefore}} not used. In fact, iron is so common that production generally focuses only on ores with very high quantities of it. During weathering, iron tends to leach from sulfide deposits as the sulfate and from silicate deposits as the bicarbonate. Both of these are oxidized in aqueous solution and precipitate in even mildly elevated pH as iron(III) oxide.|$|E
5|$|With the {{cooperation}} of the United States Department of Agriculture, efforts are under way to promote G.brachycera as a groundcover for use in landscaping. Box huckleberry is commercially available from at least one source <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> to propagate, making it unprofitable for many nurseries to carry. In New Bloomfield, PA, the box huckleberry {{has become part of the}} local New Year's celebrations, as a papier-mâché replica of a huckleberry is dropped, instead of a ball, to mark the new year.|$|E
5|$|Birds are a {{significant}} hazard to aircraft, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> to keep them away from airfields. Several methods have been explored. Stunning birds by feeding them a bait containing stupefying substances has been tried, {{and it may be}} possible to reduce their numbers on airfields by reducing the number of earthworms and other invertebrates by soil treatment. Leaving the grass long on airfields rather than mowing it is also a deterrent to birds. Sonic nets are being trialled; these produce sounds that birds find distracting and seem effective at keeping birds away from affected areas.|$|E

5|$|Many historians {{argue that}} the {{interaction}} between the western Christian and Islamic cultures was a significant, ultimately positive, factor in the development of European civilisation and the Renaissance. The many interactions between Europeans and the Islamic world across {{the entire length of the}} Mediterranean Sea led to improved perceptions of Islamic culture, but also make it difficult for historians to identify the specific source of various instances of cultural cross-fertilisation. The art and architecture of the Outremer show clear evidence of cultural fusion <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> to track illumination of manuscripts and castle design back to their sources. Textual sources are simpler, and translations made in Antioch are notable but considered secondary in importance to the works emanating from Muslim Spain and the hybrid culture of Sicily. In addition, Muslim libraries contained classical Greek and Roman texts that allowed Europe to rediscover pre-Christian philosophy, science and medicine.|$|E
25|$|Because {{people with}} {{alcoholic}} hepatitis {{may have no}} symptoms, {{it can be difficult}} to diagnose and the number of people with the disease is probably higher than many estimates. Programs such as Alcoholics Anonymous have been successful in decreasing death due to cirrhosis, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> to evaluate their success in decreasing the incidence of alcoholic hepatitis.|$|E
25|$|Cells with {{heterozygous}} mutations (one good copy of {{gene and}} one mutated copy) may function normally with the unmutated copy until the good copy has been spontaneously somatically mutated. This kind of mutation {{happens all the}} time in living organisms, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> to measure the rate. Measuring this rate is important in predicting the rate at which people may develop cancer.|$|E

25|$|There is {{evidence}} that greenhouse gas levels fell {{at the start of}} ice ages and rose during the retreat of the ice sheets, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> to establish cause and effect (see the notes above on the role of weathering). Greenhouse gas levels may also have been affected by other factors which have been proposed as causes of ice ages, such as the movement of continents and volcanism.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the opening}} of the tunnel, small {{positive}} impacts on the wider economy have been felt, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> to identify major economic successes directly attributed to the tunnel. The Eurotunnel does operate profitably, offering an alternative transportation mode unaffected by poor weather. High costs of construction did delay profitability, however, and companies involved in the tunnel's construction and operation early in operation relied on government aid to deal with debts amounted.|$|E
25|$|A cathedral {{was built}} in Lund before 1085, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> {{to know if the}} present {{building}} {{was built in}} the same place. In the gift letter of Canute the Holy, dated to 21 May 1085, there is a mention of a cathedral built during the 1080s. Canute gave several properties that enabled the building of the cathedral. However, sources indicate that Canute's cathedral is not the present Lund Cathedral. The Cathedral School was established in 1085, making it Scandinavia's oldest school.|$|E
50|$|Drafting linen was {{formerly}} used for technical drawings. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> durable {{and held up}} to handling, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>difficult</b> to use in modern whiteprints for reproduction, and shrinking was a concern.|$|R
30|$|During 1  week, a daily ocular {{sonogram}} was performed. The ONSD {{was back}} to a normal range after arterial blood pressure control. The RD regressed <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>difficult</b> to objectify <b>it.</b>|$|R
60|$|Lord Randolph's {{movements}} {{these last}} days had excited the Scotchman's curiosity. He {{had been doing}} the London streets systematically during his unoccupied afternoons. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>difficult</b> to discover what he was after.|$|R
25|$|In some {{decorative}} applications, {{wood with}} knots may be desirable to add visual interest. In applications where wood is painted, such as skirting boards, fascia boards, door frames and furniture, resins {{present in the}} timber may continue to 'bleed' through {{to the surface of}} a knot for months or even years after manufacture and show as a yellow or brownish stain. A knot primer paint or solution (knotting), correctly applied during preparation, may do much to reduce this problem <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> to control completely, especially when using mass-produced kiln-dried timber stocks.|$|E
25|$|Another {{possible}} {{source for}} mythology is ritual. Many rituals {{make reference to}} myths and are sometimes based directly on them. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> {{to determine whether a}} culture's myths developed before rituals or vice versa. Questions about this relationship between myth and ritual have spawned much discussion among Egyptologists and scholars of comparative religion in general. In ancient Egypt, the earliest evidence of religious practices predates written myths. Rituals early in Egyptian history included only a few motifs from myth. For these reasons, some scholars have argued that, in Egypt, rituals emerged before myths. But because the early evidence is so sparse, the question may never be resolved for certain.|$|E
25|$|It is {{difficult}} to monitor the evolution of Koine Greek and its splitting into the modern Greek dialects; certain researchers make {{the hypothesis that the}} various local varieties were formed between the 10th and the 12th century (as part of an evolution starting a few centuries before), <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> to draw some safer conclusions because of the absence of texts written in the vernacular language, when this initial dialect differentiation occurred. Very few paradigms of these local varieties are found in certain texts, which however used mainly learned registers. The first texts written in modern Greek dialects appear during the Early Renaissance in the islands of Cyprus and Crete.|$|E

6000|$|... “He {{was up in}} a moment. We stood {{listening}} intently for some minutes. There was certainly a movement on shore, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>difficult</b> to say of what kind. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> just a low confused murmur.|$|R
60|$|He made {{no answer}} and her {{expression}} became profoundly thoughtful. Of course this wandering must end. He {{had been growing}} impatient for some time. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>difficult,</b> she perceived, to decide just {{what to do with}} him....|$|R
25|$|Their {{influence}} certainly existed <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> {{to define}} in its totality. Writers who followed them doubtlessly thought about {{them while they}} were creating their dark and tormented worlds such as Thomas Hardy in Jude the Obscure or Tess of the d'Urbervilles, or George Eliot with Adam Bede and The Mill on the Floss. There were also more conventional authors such as Matthew Arnold, who in a letter from 1853, says of Charlotte, that she only pretends to heartless: ' nothing but hunger, rebellion and rage'. In contrast, Mrs Humphry Ward, author of Robert Elsmere and morality novels, only finds didactic among the works of Charlotte, while she appreciates the happy blend of romance and realism {{in the works of}} Emily. There is however nothing that could constitute a literary vein.|$|E
25|$|Heterosis, or {{hybrid vigor}} (as in the {{familiar}} F1 hybrids of maize), occurs in common (hexaploid) wheat, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> to produce seed of hybrid cultivars on a commercial scale (as is done with maize) because wheat flowers are perfect and normally self-pollinate. Commercial hybrid wheat seed has been produced using chemical hybridizing agents; these chemicals selectively interfere with pollen development, or naturally occurring cytoplasmic male sterility systems. Hybrid wheat has been a limited commercial success in Europe (particularly France), the United States and South Africa. F1 hybrid wheat cultivars {{should not be confused}} with the standard method of breeding inbred wheat cultivars by crossing two lines using hand emasculation, then selfing or inbreeding the progeny many (ten or more) generations before release selections are identified to be released as a variety or cultivar.|$|E
25|$|On modern yachts, {{standing}} rigging is often {{stainless steel wire}}, stainless steel rod or synthetic fiber. Semi-rigid stainless steel wire {{is by far the}} most common as it combines extreme strength, relative ease of assembling and rigging with reliability. Unlike rigid stainless steel rod, it is comparatively easy to recognize wear and stress as individual strains (normally 19) break often near a swage fitting, and can be inspected while standing. Solid rod stainless steel is more aerodynamic so is often used in extreme racing yachts <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> to see stress as this requires x-raying. Great care must be used when swaging fittings onto stainless steel rod as this can start minute cracking. Rod-type stays fail suddenly, often where the rod bends around a spreader. Bending can induce unseen stress fractures.|$|E
30|$|Confirmation that an {{abortion}} {{is caused by}} BVDV <b>is</b> often <b>difficult</b> to establish (Ruth 1987). In past, the most common method was an isolation of virus in cell cultures <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>difficult,</b> time consuming and lengthy process that requires experienced technicians.|$|R

25|$|Paddle down: A type of stance by the goaltender {{when the}} play {{is coming from the}} corner {{to the front of the}} net and the puck carrier is {{carrying}} the puck in front of the net looking to score. Here the goaltender puts the stick down on the ground, parallel to the ice, with the leg farthest from the post down and the other up and ready to push. This works well against angled rushes or wrap arounds where the skater would normally out–skate the goalie. The skater does have the top part of the net to shoot at, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> to lift the puck over the goalie from up close. The paddle down stance is also effective against low passes from behind the net to players looking to score from the slot.|$|E
25|$|The {{important}} point of Monier's {{idea was that}} it combined steel and concrete {{in such a way}} that the best qualities of each material were brought into play. Concrete is easily procured and shaped. It has considerable compressive or crushing strength, but is somewhat deficient in shearing strength, and distinctly weak in tensile or pulling strength. Steel, on the other hand, is easily procurable in simple forms such as long bars, and is extremely strong. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> and expensive to work up into customized forms. Concrete had been avoided for making beams, slabs and thin walls because its lack of tensile strength doomed it to fail in such circumstances. But if a concrete slab is reinforced with a network of small steel rods on its undersurface where the tensile stresses occur, its strength will be enormously increased.|$|E
25|$|Svalbard {{is part of}} Norway and has {{a special}} status under {{international}} law. It {{is not part of}} the Schengen Area. There is no visa regime in existence for Svalbard either for entry, residence or work, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> to visit Svalbard without travelling through the Schengen Area, although there are charter flights from Russia. Since 2011, the Norwegian government has imposed systematic border checks on individuals wishing to enter and leave Svalbard, requiring a passport or national identity card for non-Norwegian citizens. As a result, the border between Svalbard and the rest of Norway is largely treated like any other external Schengen border. A Schengen visa must be multiple entry to allow returning to Norway. There is no welfare or asylum system for immigrants on Svalbard, and people incapable of supporting themselves may be sent away.|$|E
