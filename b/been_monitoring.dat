5|$|In the story-driven Scenario Campaign mode in {{the console}} {{versions}} of Tekken 6, Lars is made {{into the central}} character. After the infiltration of a Mishima Zaibatsu-run laboratory goes awry, {{and a number of}} Jack robots overwhelm Lars' rebel squadron, he loses his memory and begins to seek out his true purpose. Joined by a robot named Alisa Bosconovitch, Lars travels the world trying to find his own identity. Along the way, he meets a Tekken Force lieutenant who tries to enlist him to help the cause once more. Lars' memory is restored on encountering his father Heihachi Mishima at his compound, at which point he also rediscovers his purpose: to stop Jin. He resumes his role {{as the leader of the}} rebel Tekken Force army and infiltrates G Corporation, and eventually meets Mishima Zaibatsu himself and encounters his half-nephew, Jin. Before he can fight Jin at Zaibatsu headquarters, it is revealed that Alisa has been acting as Jin's surveillance unit and has <b>been</b> <b>monitoring</b> Lars' movements around the world. This results in Lars and Alisa becoming enemies. At this point, a warrior named Raven offers to accompany Lars, and together the two pursue Jin into the desert, where he intends to awaken the ancient beast Azazel. At Azazel's Temple, Raven and Lars defeat the newly-awoken Azazel, and encounter Alisa and Jin again. Lars disables Alisa and engages Jin in battle, in revenge for his treatment of Alisa. During the fight, Azazel reappears and Jin turns his attention to the monster. Jin destroys Azazel, seemingly at the cost of his own life. Lars then brings the disabled Alisa to his partner and adoptive brother Lee Chaolan, who offers to restore her. After leaving Alisa with Lee, and parting company with Raven, Lars gets a call summoning him for a new mission. Lars' role in this game is also briefly shown in the manga Tekken Comic, and the novel Tekken: The Dark History of Mishima.|$|E

Loss of circulation combined with an unexpected drop in advertising revenue have forced more than 400 job cuts at The Inquirer and Daily News since they were bought by Philadelphia Media Holdings. As Philadelphia Media Holdings financial situation worsened in 2008 employees began complaining about how management has <b>been</b> <b>monitoring</b> things such as bathroom breaks and the coffee they drink, and that Tierney has been patrolling the parking garage seeing what time employees arrive for work. Despite efforts to manage the financial strain, on February 21, 2009, Philadelphia Newspapers LLC, the subsidiary of Philadelphia Media Holdings that owns the paper, filled for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The company hoped to restructure the US$390 million in debt it borrowed to buy the newspapers, but the end result was that the papers were auctioned off to the company's lenders. The beginning of 2009 also saw the filing of a lawsuit that accused The Philadelphia Inquirer of writing critical stories about Chester Community Charter School's use of public funds after business negotiations between school operator Vahan H. Gureghian and Tierney failed.|$|E
