40|$|Public sector {{services}} have been reshaped by two interacting factors: the growing dominance of risk {{management and the}} growing demands for transparency and accountability. For the caring professions, these have provoked radical reform. Using the child protection service as a case study, this article explores {{the impact of the}} changes on a service that deals with conflicting risks and has a poorly articulated knowledge <b>base.</b> <b>Drawing</b> on Rothstein et al. 's distinction between societal and institutional risks, it is argued that difficulties in managing societal risks are creating serious institutional risks. The latter are then being prioritized in the way the system operates. The preoccupation with such risks has been translated into concerted efforts to formalize the work of front line practitioners to make it transparent and auditable. Although done, in part, with the good intention of spreading good practice standards, this formalization has gone beyond the evidenced knowledge base {{to the extent that it}} is creating a new picture of “good practice” that omits significant dimensions of work and is distinct from measures of children's safety or welfare. Moreover, the process of formalization acts as an impediment to knowledge development in disciplines where such learning is urgently needed...|$|E

The drawing algorithm is the extension of the orthogonal straight line drawing[1], which is implemented in java and the javadoc documentation is attached in the appendix. While the orthogonal straight line drawing algorithm[1] is designed only for binary tree graph, This new algorithm is aimed for rooted tree graph with nodes of arbitrary number of children. The aspect ratio is considered as one of the important feature, so it becomes the target of analysis in the section 3, {{as it is in the}} orthogonal straight line drawing algorithm. 1 <b>Base</b> <b>Drawing</b> To support the algorithm for trees with arbitrary children, the base case drawing algorithms need to be adjusted.

Some got analysed for their therapeutic property and became a medicinal plant. Some were combined with other plants, insects, fungi or other materials such as animal urine, milk, minerals or other compounds to develop various kinds of biotechnological products useful as drugs, dyes or derivatives.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{developed and}} tested {{a model of}} implementation of new manufacturing technology, using individual learning as the theoretical <b>base.</b> <b>Drawing</b> from the organizational behavior and technology management literatures, it was argued {{that many of the}} problems or successes of new technology implementation are a result of how easy or difficult it is for the individual user to learn the new technology. Individual technology learning is viewed as consisting of experiential and vicarious learning, as well as individual motivation of self-efficacy. The model proposed that four sets of variables would affect individual learning of the new technology: technology characteristics, training, group processes, and organizational support. The outcome variables in the model (time to competence, performance, and user satisfaction) reflect both concerns from practicing managers, as well as variables identified by researchers as important. ^ A two-panel longitudinal field study of 157 respondents from four manufacturing divisions of a large corporation demonstrated partial support for the hypothesized relationships in the model; as well as some surprising contra-hypotheses findings. The results lead to some notable implications for those interested in technology implementation in manufacturing organizations, including: identifying and softening the shock of radicalness; having adequate information; dealing with the issue of competent and supportive peers in a group; assuring appropriate feedback to individuals; and the role of visible managerial and resource support. ...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the nature and geography of innovation and knowledge sourcing activities in the ICT manufacturing sector in the region of Vienna. Vienna is often regarded as a prime example of a fragmented metropolitan regional innovation system. Fragmented regional innovation systems are characterised by a strong endowment with knowledge infrastructure elements and other innovation relevant institutions, but they suffer from a lack of local networking and knowledge circulation. In this paper we examine for Vienna whether this key deficiency of the regional innovation system, i. e. fragmentation, is also a crucial feature of knowledge based sectors such as the ICT manufacturing industry which exhibit an analytical knowledge <b>base.</b> <b>Drawing</b> on 18 face-to- face interviews with firms and an analysis of 207 knowledge links and 264 knowledge transfer channels we will show that local collective learning processes are vital for innovative companies in the Vienna ICT manufacturing sector, whilst at the same time they rely heavily on international knowledge sources. The significance of the local level as interaction space for knowledge exchange found in the ICT manufacturing sector indicates that at least for this knowledge based industry, Vienna's innovation system is of a less fragmented nature than previous studies have suggested. Knowledge based sectors are characterised by a high level of localised knowledge circulation which underpins radical innovation. (authors' abstract) Series: SRE - Discussion Paper...|$|E
40|$|A {{growing body}} of {{researches}} provided evidence of the successful design in particular focus on design elements, ranging from colour, lighting, technology, landscape and spatial arrangement. However, no example or literature investigates the opportunities for linking these design elements in a practical <b>base.</b> <b>Drawing</b> upon existing architectural design theory, this paper investigates the relationship between design elements regards to public’s behavioural response to the public space. The aims of this paper are two-fold: first to examine {{whether there is a}} direct relationship between the two, and second to find out how the design elements could be coordinated together to influence not only the activities but also the environment, function and experience. To meet this objective, observation, behavioural mapping, interview and cognitive mapping methodologies are used. The present study involves two local case studies to find out the relationship between design elements in order to assist the design of a better public space for public activities. Correlation between the design elements shows that public activities is more likely to happen in relatively space with well balance of design. These finding provide a better understanding of public space design by gaining deeper perceptive between design and user’s behaviour, consequently improving social activities and interactions in public space. Moreover, it focuses on campus public areas which can be a vital aspect of university campus and play a valuable role in the overall success of public space design. ...|$|E

Describing the straight association between input and output spaces required by this kind of controllers involves several critical choices (especiall fuzzification y of input and output variables and rule <b>base</b> <b>drawing)</b> heavily affected by the subjective skills of the designer. Automatic tools working on suitable training samples can greatly simplify and making more objective this process. The paper describes a system developed for supporting all the design phases of fuzzy controllers. The platformindependent JAVA language has bee choosen n {{in order to obtain}} the benefits of object-oriented environments and develop an easily portable system, including its graphical user interface. The system offers a graphic user interface allowing four different modalities for interacting with a real vehicle in order to execute the desired task: the strategy used by the operator is recorded (in terms of examples of the association between sensory data and control commands). A few tools supports the operator during this phase by providing graphic and/or audio feedback about the quality of its driving with respect to previousl defineable y criteria. The collected examples are then analysed by a module using a machine-learning based algorithm for identifying the inputs really relevant for each situation and for drawing rules suited for replicating the control strategy.
