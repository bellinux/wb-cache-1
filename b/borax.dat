5|$|<b>Borax,</b> its mineral form {{then known}} as tincal, glazes were used in China from AD 300, and some crude <b>borax</b> reached the West, where the Persian alchemist Jābir ibn Hayyān {{apparently}} mentioned it in AD 700. Marco Polo brought some glazes back to Italy in the 13th century. Agricola, around 1600, reports the use of <b>borax</b> as a flux in metallurgy. In 1777, boric acid was recognized in the hot springs (soffioni) near Florence, Italy, and became known as sal sedativum, with primarily medical uses. The rare mineral is called sassolite, which is found at Sasso, Italy. Sasso was {{the main source of}} European <b>borax</b> from 1827 to 1872, when American sources replaced it. Boron compounds were relatively rarely used until the late 1800s when Francis Marion Smith's Pacific Coast <b>Borax</b> Company first popularized and produced them in volume at low cost.|$|E
5|$|Some anti-corrosion systems contain <b>borax.</b>|$|E
5|$|The teams {{averaged}} {{two miles}} (3km) {{an hour and}} required about 30days to complete a round trip. The trade name 20-Mule Team <b>Borax</b> was established by Francis Marion Smith's Pacific Coast <b>Borax</b> Company after Smith acquired Coleman's <b>borax</b> holdings in 1890. A memorable advertising campaign used the wagon's image to promote the Boraxo brand of granular hand soap and the Death Valley Days radio and television programs. In 1914, the Death Valley Railroad was built to serve mining operations {{on the east side}} of the valley. Mining continued after the collapse of Coleman's empire, and by the late 1920s the area was the world's number one source of <b>borax.</b> Some four to six million years old, the Furnace Creek Formation is the primary source of borate minerals gathered from Death Valley's playas.|$|E
5|$|In a <b>borax</b> bead flame test, cobalt shows {{deep blue}} in both {{oxidizing}} and reducing flames.|$|E
5|$|It {{is found}} {{naturally}} combined in compounds such as <b>borax</b> and boric acid (sometimes found in volcanic spring waters). About a hundred borate minerals are known.|$|E
5|$|Boron {{is found}} in nature on Earth entirely as various oxides of B(III), often {{associated}} with other elements. More than one hundred borate minerals contain boron in oxidation state +3. These minerals resemble silicates in some respect, although boron is often found not only in a tetrahedral coordination with oxygen, but also in a trigonal planar configuration. Unlike silicates, the boron minerals never contain boron with coordination number greater than four. A typical motif is exemplified by the tetraborate anions of the common mineral <b>borax,</b> shown at left. The formal negative charge of the tetrahedral borate center is balanced by metal cations in the minerals, such as the sodium (Na+) in <b>borax.</b>|$|E

5|$|Compounds of boron, silicon, arsenic and {{antimony}} {{have been}} used as flame retardants. Boron, in the form of <b>borax,</b> {{has been used as a}} textile flame retardant since at least the 18th century. Silicon compounds such as silicones, silanes, silsesquioxane, silica and silicates, some of which were developed as alternatives to more toxic halogenated products, can considerably improve the flame retardancy of plastic materials.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1930s, Joppenbergh became {{the site of}} several skiing competitions, which {{continued}} until the early 1940s. The slope was designed by Harold Schelderup for Rosendale's first competition in 1937; Schelderup participated in a competition that July after the slope was coated with <b>borax.</b> Skiing stopped until the 1960s, when a new slope was built, and competitions were held until 1971.|$|E
5|$|Economically {{important}} {{sources of}} boron are the minerals colemanite, rasorite (kernite), ulexite and tincal. Together these constitute 90% of mined boron-containing ore. The largest global <b>borax</b> deposits known, many still untapped, are in Central and Western Turkey, including {{the provinces of}} Eskişehir, Kütahya and Balıkesir. Global proven boron mineral mining reserves exceed one billion metric tonnes, against a yearly production of about four million tonnes.|$|E
5|$|Sodium {{compounds}} are {{of immense}} commercial importance, being particularly central to industries producing glass, paper, soap, and textiles. The most important sodium compounds are table salt (NaCl), soda ash (Na2CO3), baking soda (NaHCO3), caustic soda (NaOH), sodium nitrate (NaNO3), di- and tri-sodium phosphates, sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3·5H2O), and <b>borax</b> (Na2B4O7·10H2O). In compounds, sodium is usually ionically bonded to water and anions, and {{is viewed as}} a hard Lewis acid.|$|E
5|$|The park's Resources Management Division {{monitors}} mining within park {{boundaries and}} continues to review the status of 19 patented mining claim groups and less than 10 unpatented mining claims, while ensuring that federal guidelines are followed and the park's resources are protected. In 2005, the Billie Mine, an underground <b>borax</b> mine located {{along the road to}} Dante's View, closed, ending mining in the park.|$|E
5|$|An {{archaeological site}} on the Trinity River at Cox Bar, with spear points dating from 3000–6000 BC, {{has some of the}} oldest {{evidence}} of human habitation in Northern California. This site is believed {{to be part of the}} early <b>Borax</b> Lake Pattern culture. Archaeological evidence in the Whiskeytown area also indicates human presence as early as 5000 BC, although it is uncertain at what point the ancestors of modern Native American tribes arrived here.|$|E
5|$|Boron is a {{chemical}} element with symbolB and atomic number5. Produced entirely by cosmic ray spallation and supernovae {{and not by}} stellar nucleosynthesis, it is a low-abundance element in the Solar system and in the Earth's crust. Boron is concentrated on Earth by the water-solubility of its more common naturally occurring compounds, the borate minerals. These are mined industrially as evaporites, such as <b>borax</b> and kernite. The largest known boron deposits are in Turkey, the largest producer of boron minerals.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1930s, Joppenbergh became {{the site of}} several ski jumping competitions, which {{continued}} until the early 1940s. The original slope was designed by Harold Schelderup for Rosendale's first competition in 1937; Schelderup himself skied that July, after the slope was coated with <b>borax</b> for a summer competition. Several Olympic skiers participated in the competitions. Skiing began again in the 1960s, when a new slope {{was built on the}} mountain, and the revived competitions continued until 1971.|$|E
5|$|Fiberglass is a fiber {{reinforced}} polymer made {{of plastic}} reinforced by glass fibers, commonly woven into a mat. The glass fibers used in the material are made of various types of glass depending upon the fiberglass use. These glasses all contain silica or silicate, with varying amounts of oxides of calcium, magnesium, and sometimes boron. The boron is present as borosilicate, <b>borax,</b> or boron oxide, and is added to increase {{the strength of the}} glass, or as a fluxing agent to decrease the melting temperature of silica, which is too high to be easily worked in its pure form to make glass fibers.|$|E
5|$|Since July 2006, {{trading is}} open Mondays through Thursdays. Exports from India {{exempted}} from duty include agricultural implements, blankets, copper products, clothes, cycles, coffee, tea, barley, rice, wheat, flour, dry fruits, vegetables, vegetable oil, tobacco, snuff, spices, shoes, kerosene oil, stationery, utensils, milk processed products, canned food, dyes, and local herbs. Chinese exports to India exempted from duty include goat skin, sheep skin, wool, raw silk, yak tail, yak hair, china clay, <b>borax,</b> butter, common salt, horses, goats, and sheep. Restrictions {{are placed on}} traders, with permits only given {{to those who were}} Sikkimese citizens before the kingdom merged with India in 1975.|$|E
5|$|The first {{documented}} {{tourist facilities}} in Death Valley were {{a set of}} tent houses built in the 1920s where Stovepipe Wells is now located. People flocked to resorts built around natural springs thought to have curative and restorative properties. In 1927, Pacific Coast <b>Borax</b> turned the crew quarters of its Furnace Creek Ranch into a resort, creating the Furnace Creek Inn and resort. The spring at Furnace Creek was harnessed to develop the resort, and as the water was diverted, the surrounding marshes and wetlands started to shrink.|$|E
5|$|The major global industrial-scale use {{of boron}} {{compounds}} (about 46% of end-use) is in production of glass fiber for boron-containing insulating and structural fiberglasses, especially in Asia. Boron {{is added to}} the glass as <b>borax</b> pentahydrate or boron oxide, to influence the strength or fluxing qualities of the glass fibers. Another 10% of global boron production is for borosilicate glass as used in high strength glassware. About 15% of global boron is used in boron ceramics, including super-hard materials discussed below. Agriculture consumes 11% of global boron production, and bleaches and detergents about 6%.|$|E
5|$|There is scant {{record of}} the ship's {{movements}} under any of her later names. The Los Angeles Times reports her arrival at West Coast ports as Seisho Maru at least twice. In March 1930, the ship arrived at Tacoma, Washington, from Singapore {{to pick up a}} load of logs for export. Another notice in November 1933 noted her impending return to Los Angeles, where she was scheduled to take on a load of <b>borax</b> and scrap brass. In early May 1939, Seisho Maru ran aground in Tokyo Bay, but was refloated after several days.|$|E
5|$|Increasing {{demand for}} boric acid has led {{a number of}} {{producers}} to invest in additional capacity. Turkey's state-owned Eti Mine Works opened a new boric acid plant with the production capacity of 100,000 tonnes per year at Emet in 2003. Rio Tinto Group increased the capacity of its boron plant from 260,000 tonnes per year in 2003 to 310,000 tonnes per year by May 2005, with plans to grow this to 366,000 tonnes per year in 2006. Chinese boron producers {{have been unable to}} meet rapidly growing demand for high quality borates. This has led to imports of sodium tetraborate (<b>borax)</b> growing by a hundredfold between 2000 and 2005 and boric acid imports increasing by 28% per year over the same period.|$|E
5|$|The <b>BORAX</b> Experiments were {{a series}} of {{destructive}} tests of boiling water reactors conducted by Argonne National Laboratory in Idaho. The BORAX-1 test was conducted under Zinn's supervision in 1954. He had the control rods removed {{to demonstrate that the}} reactor would shut down without trouble, and it immediately blew up with a loud bang and a tall column of dark smoke, a turn of events that he had not anticipated. He shouted to Harold Lichtenberg to put the control rods back in again, but Lichtenberg pointed out that one was already flying through the air. Zinn later had to testify on the experiment before the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy.|$|E
5|$|The path of SR 190 {{east of the}} Panamint Range in Death Valley National Park was {{followed}} in late 1849 and early 1850 by the Death Valley '49ers, a group of '49ers that had left the Old Spanish Trail at Enterprise, Utah {{to look for a}} shortcut to Walker Pass. The pioneers crossed the state line from Nevada near Ash Meadows, following the general route of present SR 190 from Death Valley Junction into Death Valley, which they left to the west into Panamint Valley and then turned south towards present State Route 178. After ore was discovered in Death Valley, the route became a primitive road, though most travel into the valley, such as the twenty-mule team <b>borax</b> route, was from the south.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} Native American groups {{inhabited}} {{the area from}} as early as 7000BC, most recently the Timbisha around 1000AD who migrated between winter camps in the valleys and summer grounds in the mountains. A group of European-Americans that became stuck in the valley in 1849 while looking for a shortcut to the gold fields of California gave the valley its name, even though only one of their group died there. Several short-lived boom towns sprang up during the late 19th and early 20th centuries to mine gold and silver. The only long-term profitable ore to be mined was <b>borax,</b> which was transported out of the valley with twenty-mule teams. The valley later {{became the subject of}} books, radio programs, television series, and movies. Tourism blossomed in the 1920s, when resorts were built around Stovepipe Wells and Furnace Creek. Death Valley National Monument was declared in 1933 and the park was substantially expanded and became a national park in 1994.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} of San Martín repeated {{some of the}} ideas outlined in the Operations plan, drafted by Mariano Moreno {{at the beginning of the}} war. A combination of incentives, confiscations and planned economy allowed the country to provision the army: gunpowder, pieces of artillery, mules and horses, food, military clothing, etc. Mining increased, with increased extraction of lead, copper, saltpeter, sulfur and <b>borax,</b> which had several usages and improved local finances. Hundreds of women wove clothing used by the soldiers. Father José Luis Beltrán headed a military factory of 700 men, which produced rifles and horseshoes. San Martín stayed on good terms with both the {{government of}} Buenos Aires and the provincial caudillos, without fully allying with either one. He was able to receive provisions from both. He considered that the war of independence took priority over the civil wars.|$|E
5|$|Techniques to {{preserve}} birds were attempted {{even from the}} early 16th century {{as shown in the}} writings of Conrad Gesner and Pierre Belon. Belon provided instructions on the removal of viscera and the use of salt {{to preserve}} bird specimens in his 1555 book on birds. These were further improved in the 17th century and a range of preservatives included ash (potassium carbonate), salt, sulphur, alum, alcohol and various plant extracts were used. In the early days of bird collections, most specimens were mounted in unrealistic positions often with their wings raised as if they were about to take flight. These were kept in the open and the colours were prone to fading and the specimens themselves prone to damage by beetles. In Berlin, J. L. Frisch started using tightly enclosed glass jars for every mount to prevent pest damage. During this time, Comte de Reaumur at the Paris Museum had managed to find techniques to preserve specimens dry and without loss of colour. This technique was however a secret and similar results were later achieved by pickling using salt, ground pepper and alum and drying for a month with threads holding the bird in a natural position. The use of arsenic to preserve specimens was first introduced by Jean-Baptiste Bécoeur (1718-1777) but this method was publicly revealed only in 1800 by Louis Dufresne in Daudin's Traité Élémentaire et Complet d’Ornithologie (1800). In modern collections, salvaged or collected birds may be preserved in a number of ways. The most traditional preparation is a study skin, in which almost all of the body inside the skin is removed and replaced with cotton so that the final result resembles a bird lying on its back with its wings folded. <b>Borax</b> is used as the preferred preservative as it is low in toxicity. This stereotypic posture was developed to enable many skins to be kept together in cabinets to protect them from insect and light damage. If a complete skeleton is desired, a flat skin may be prepared: all bones, muscle, digestive and other soft tissue is carefully removed and the feathers and skin are stretched flat and dried.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{hot springs}} of the Sulphur Bank {{contained}} <b>borax,</b> the search led John Allen Veatch to nearby <b>Borax</b> Lake where the California <b>Borax</b> Company established the first commercial <b>borax</b> mining operation in the U. S. beginning in 1860 and ceasing in 1868. The company established land claims to <b>Borax</b> Lake, the Sulphur Bank and Sulphur Springs in Colusa County.|$|E
25|$|<b>Borax</b> {{was first}} {{discovered}} in dry lake beds in Tibet and was imported via the Silk Road to the Arabian Peninsula in the 8th Century AD. <b>Borax</b> {{first came into}} common use in the late 19th century when Francis Marion Smith's Pacific Coast <b>Borax</b> Company began to market and popularize a large variety of applications under the 20 Mule Team <b>Borax</b> trademark, named for the method by which <b>borax</b> was originally hauled out of the California and Nevada deserts in large enough quantities to make it cheap and commonly available.|$|E
25|$|<b>Borax</b> is {{replacing}} mercury as {{the preferred}} method for extracting gold in small-scale mining facilities. The method {{is called the}} <b>borax</b> method and {{is used in the}} Philippines.|$|E
25|$|In artisanal gold mining, the <b>borax</b> {{method is}} {{sometimes}} {{used as a}} substitute for toxic mercury in the gold extraction process. <b>Borax</b> was reportedly used by gold miners in parts of the Philippines in the 1900s.|$|E
25|$|<b>Borax</b> occurs {{naturally}} in evaporite deposits {{produced by the}} repeated evaporation of seasonal lakes. The most commercially important deposits are found in Turkey; Boron, California; and Searles Lake, California. Also, <b>borax</b> has been found at many other locations in the Southwestern United States, the Atacama desert in Chile, newly discovered deposits in Bolivia, and in Tibet and Romania. <b>Borax</b> can also be produced synthetically from other boron compounds.|$|E
25|$|<b>Borax</b> is {{generally}} described as Na2B4O7·10H2O. However, {{it is better}} formulated as Na2·8H2O, since <b>borax</b> contains the 2− ion. In this structure, there are two four-coordinate boron atoms (two BO4 tetrahedra) and two three-coordinate boron atoms (two BO3 triangles).|$|E
25|$|When <b>borax</b> {{is added}} to a flame, it {{produces}} a yellow green color. <b>Borax</b> is not {{used for this purpose}} in fireworks due to the overwhelming yellow color of sodium. Boric acid is used to color methanol flames a transparent green.|$|E
25|$|A rubbery polymer {{sometimes}} called Slime, Flubber, 'gluep' or 'glurch' (or erroneously called Silly Putty, {{which is based}} on silicone polymers), can be made by cross-linking polyvinyl alcohol with <b>borax.</b> Making flubber from polyvinyl acetate-based glues, such as Elmer's Glue, and <b>borax</b> is a common elementary-science demonstration.|$|E
25|$|Boric acid {{is added}} to <b>borax</b> for use as welding flux by blacksmiths.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 19th century {{the region was}} noted for {{producing}} salt, soda, <b>borax,</b> gold, jade and coal.|$|E
