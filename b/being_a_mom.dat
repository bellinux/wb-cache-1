40|$|Part of {{personal}} leadership and innovation is self-discovery. One {{of the first}} steps in the process {{of personal}} innovation is discovering and defining success and failure. Cultures and nations around the world define success differently, and it is important for individuals to define their own version of success to live their best lives.

Rarely do we examine success in terms of personal fulfillment, happiness or joy. Maybe your success is <b>being</b> <b>a</b> stay-at-home <b>Mom.</b> Perhaps you are the janitor or manager or a small business owner. Or, you might be the President of a large corporation.
