5|$|A {{peculiar}} {{feature of}} Muslim castles in the Iberian Peninsula {{was the use}} of detached towers, called Albarrana towers, around the perimeter as can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>at</b> the Alcazaba of Badajoz. Probably developed in the 12thcentury, the towers provided flanking fire. They were connected to the castle by removable wooden bridges, so if the towers were captured the rest of the castle was not accessible.|$|E

30|$|This {{field test}} showed that bicyclists <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> <b>at</b> longer {{distances}} than cycle crossings combined with pedestrian crossings at night-time. The cycle crossings <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> <b>at</b> shorter distances than the stopping distance when driving in 50  km/h. Cycle crossings <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> <b>at</b> significantly longer distances when the road surface was dry {{than when it}} was wet, while no such effect <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> for bicyclists. No advice on keeping or changing the priority rule for bicyclists and motorists at cycle crossings can be made exclusively from this study. Further research is recommended on how the visibility of cycle crossings can be improved and on how the visibility is related to driving behaviour.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND Anatomy of pedicle {{has gained}} {{importance}} because of accelerated use of pedicle fixation devices. The detail of pedicle morphometry becomes important as it helps {{in the selection}} of most suited pedicle screw. METHODS Computed tomography scans of lower thoracic and lumbar vertebrae (T 9 -L 5) were reviewed. Using the bone window, the transverse section on which the left and right pedicle appeared largest is selected. Transverse pedicle width, Transverse pedicle angle, Chord length/Screw path length were measured. RESULTS Widest pedicle <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>at</b> L 5 with a mean of 12. 74 mm. The narrowest <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>at</b> T 9 with a mean of 5. 81 mm. The shortest distance <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>at</b> T 11 with a mean of 31. 59 mm. The longest distance <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>at</b> L 5 with a mean of 40. 12 mm. The largest angle <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>at</b> L 5 with a mean angle of 20. 4 o. The shallowest was at T 12 with a mean of - 0. 160. CONCLUSION Differences exist between the pedicles within same population. Preoperative CT-based pedicle dimensions should be recorded if possible for preoperative planning of pedicle implant placement and sizes to avoid inadvertent complications. ...|$|R
