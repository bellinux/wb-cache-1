25|$|The bending curve isn't easily {{described}} by terms. However, some rod & blank manufacturers try to simplify things towards their customers by describing the bending curve by associating {{them with their}} action. The term fast action is used for rods where only the tip is bending, and slow action for rods bending from tip to <b>butt.</b> <b>In</b> practice, this is misleading, as top-quality rods are very often fast-action rods, bending from tip to butt. While the so-called 'fast-action' rods are stiff rods (with absence of any action) which end in a soft or slow tip section. The construction of a progressive bending, fast action rod is more difficult and more expensive to achieve. Common terms to describe the bending curve or properties which influence the bending curve are: progressive taper/loading/curve/bending/..., fast taper, heavy progressive (notes a bending curve close to progressive, tending to become fast-tapered), tip action (also referred to as 'umbrella'-action), broom-action (which refers to the previously mentioned stiff 'fast action'-rods with soft tip). A parabolic action {{is often used to}} note a progressive bending curve, in fact this term comes from a series of splitcane fly rods built by Pezon & Michel in France since the late 1930s, which had a progressive bending curve. Sometimes the term parabolic is more specific used to note the specific type of progressive bending curve as was found in the Parabolic series.|$|E

500|$|Manchester United left England {{two days}} before the final, first flying from Manchester Ringway Airport to Heathrow, where they boarded a Concorde {{aircraft}} for the flight to Barcelona. They stayed in the Meliá Gran hotel in the town of Sitges, about [...] down the coast from Barcelona. Captain Roy Keane and midfielder Paul Scholes both missed out on the final due to suspension; manager Alex Ferguson had originally considered selecting Ryan Giggs to join Nicky <b>Butt</b> <b>in</b> central midfield, but ultimately picked David Beckham as a player who could help the team control possession {{in the middle of the}} pitch, with Giggs on the right wing and Jesper Blomqvist starting on the left. Keane had suffered an ankle injury in the FA Cup final that would keep him out until the start of the following season, but his suspension rendered the injury irrelevant to his selection. Norwegian defender Henning Berg also missed out through injury, meaning that his compatriot Ronny Johnsen – who had been an early contender to play alongside <b>Butt</b> <b>in</b> midfield – played in central defence alongside Jaap Stam, who overcame an Achilles injury. With Keane out, goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel – who in November 1998 had announced his intention to leave Manchester United at the end of the season – was named as captain for his final Manchester United appearance; this meant that both sides were captained by their goalkeepers, as Oliver Kahn wore the armband for Bayern. As Manchester United's top two goalscorers throughout the season, Andy Cole and Dwight Yorke started up front, leaving Teddy Sheringham – who had played a part in both goals in the FA Cup Final a few days earlier – on the bench. Also on the bench were fellow striker Ole Gunnar Solskjær, back-up goalkeeper Raimond van der Gouw, defenders David May, Phil Neville and Wes Brown, and midfielder Jonathan Greening.|$|E
