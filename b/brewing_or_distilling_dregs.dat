40|$|The {{objective}} of this project was to explore the fundamental interactions between microwave and radio frequency (RF) energy and malt. The main goal was to develop and apply a method for the reduction {{of time and energy}} costs and the enhancement of product quality in the kilning process which is used to dry malted barley. Volumetric heating technologies such as microwaves and radio frequency heating have been applied in industrial processing for many years and have the potential to reduce both time and energy costs compared with conventional heating. Potential benefits include savings in energy and process time whilst increasing product homogeneity and thus quality. Furthermore, it was important that the treatment should not adversely affect any of the key <b>brewing</b> (<b>or</b> <b>distilling)</b> quality parameters which are currently specified by the malt end-users. Firstly, the impact of moisture content on the dielectric properties of whole malt and barley grains (variety Tipple) at varying moisture contents relevant to the malting process (5 - 46...|$|R

After New Jersey's current state constitution was adopted in 1947 and some departments were consolidated, the department was incorporated into the Department of Law and Public Safety under the New Jersey Attorney General's office. The statutes define an alcoholic beverage as [...] "any fluid or solid capable of being converted into a fluid, suitable for human consumption, and having an alcohol content of more than one-half of one per centum (1/2 of 1%) by volume, including alcohol, beer, lager beer, ale, porter, naturally fermented wine, treated wine, blended wine, fortified wine, sparkling wine, distilled liquors, blended distilled liquors and any <b>brewed,</b> fermented <b>or</b> <b>distilled</b> liquors fit for use for beverage purposes or any mixture of the same, and fruit juices." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{focus of}} their Island managers, over {{seventeen}} years, for Thomas Douglas, up to 1820, and then forty years for Dunbar Douglas, up to 1860, it seems, {{to a man}} they did not place their charge, and the Selkirk interests, at the top on their priority list. From the first, James Williams: 1803 to 1811, shortly by Charles Stewart: 1811 to 1813, and eventually William Douse: 1833 to 1860, {{there was always something}} more interesting politically and financially beneficial in which to engage.

A few of the young men employed in the shipyards belong {{to other parts of the}} country though they have been resident in the district for the last 8 or 9 months. In this township there are several poor families who only arrived on the Island last fall and who have not yet taken up any land, some of whom will most probably settle in some other parts of the country in consequence of the little encouragement held forth to them by the proprietor's agent. In the rear of this township there are several new settlers who raised no crops.

2500|$|Malting is {{the process}} of {{converting}} barley or other cereal grains into malt, for use in <b>brewing,</b> <b>distilling,</b> <b>or</b> in foods and takes place in a maltings, sometimes called a malthouse, or a malting floor. The cereal is spread out on the malting floor in a layer of 8 to 12cm (3 to 5 inch) depth. The malting process starts with drying the grains to a moisture content below 14%, and then storing for around six weeks to overcome seed dormancy. When ready, the grain is immersed or steeped in water two or three times over two or three days to allow the grain to absorb moisture and to start to sprout. When the grain has a moisture content of around 46%, it is transferred to the malting or germination floor, where it is constantly turned over for around five days while it is air-dried [...] The grain at this point is called [...] "green malt". The green malt is then dried and pre-toasted in an oven (or kiln) to the desired colour and specification. Malts range in colour from very pale through crystal and amber to chocolate or black malts.|$|R
