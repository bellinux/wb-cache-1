5000|$|Melville {{is said to}} {{have taken}} part of his {{inspiration}} for Moby-Dick from the view of the mountain from his house Arrowhead in Pittsfield, since its snow-covered profile reminded him of a great white sperm whale's back breaking the ocean's surface. Melville dedicated his next novel, Pierre, to [...] "Greylock's Most Excellent Majesty", calling the mountain [...] "my own... sovereign lord and king". In August 1851 Melville and a few friends, including the young poet Sarah Morewood, camped for a night on Greylock's summit. Thoreau summited and spent a night in July 1844. His account of this event in A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers described his approach up what is today the <b>Bellows</b> <b>Pipe</b> Trail. Scholars contend that this Greylock experience transformed him, affirming his ability to do these excursions on his own, following his brother John's death; and served as a prelude to his experiment of rugged individualism at Walden Pond the following year in 1845.|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} a multidisciplinary approach of railway pneumatic suspension modelling: both multibody and pneumatic aspects {{are taken into}} account. The work aims at obtaining a realistic model of the secondary suspension and coupling it with a multibody model of a train. Various components of the pneumatic circuit such as <b>bellows,</b> tanks, <b>pipes</b> and valves are taken into account. The article focuses on the <b>bellow</b> - <b>pipe</b> - tank subsystem for which several modelling approaches are presented and compared. Differences between differential and algebraic models are highlighted, and an application-dependent choice between them is suggested. A complete model of the pneumatic circuit is then obtained and coupled with a multibody model of the train. As a result, the behaviour of a suburban train equipped with a pneumatic secondary suspension is analysed, in particular undesired oscillating motions which affect the comfort. Topological modifications and improvements of the suspension are also investigated and discussed...|$|R

5000|$|The first {{reference}} to a Pastoral pipe comes from popular and fashionable pastoral dramas of the time with music such as the Gentle Shepherd in (1725) [...] by the writer and poet Allan Ramsay and the English Ballad The Beggar’s Opera in 1728, as a counter-measure against the influx of Pastoral Italian music. The Opera featured an “en masse” dance led by a Pastoral pipe and the scene was engraved by William Hogarth (1697-1764) who clearly shows a bellows blown bagpipe [...] {{similar to the one}} later depicted in the Geoghegan tutor. The Geoghegan repertoire draws on contemporary compositions namely the London organist John Ravenwood (1745), composer John Grey (1745) [...] the musical collection of William Thomson's Orpheus Caledonius in (1733) as well as operatic arrangements for the Ossian Cycle. The pastoral pipes were regarded in a classical or neo-baroque setting, played by gentlemen pipers and spread across the upper circles of polite society as the instrument of choice. An established <b>bellows</b> <b>pipes</b> with an extended range is noted to be played across Scotland no later than 1760 in the “Complete Theory of the Great Highland bagpipe” by Joseph MacDonald.|$|R

Several areas of applied physics deal with problems in high-vacuum and ultra high-vacuum technology that present tubular form. In many cases one finds tubes with non-uniform cross sections, such as <b>bellows,</b> conical <b>pipes</b> and others, which are frequently present in particle accelerators, colliders, storage rings, gravitational antennas, and electron devices. This work presents and describes in detail the pressure field in tubes with arbitrary axisymetric cross sections. Details of the mathematical and physical formulations are given; specific conductance and specific throughput are defined; and a detailed discussion about the boundary conditions is presented. These concepts and approach are applied to usual realistic cases, such as conical tubes, with typical laboratory dimensions. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{distinguish}} between {{two types of}} beam loss monitors, the ”BLMA ” distributed around the ring and ”BLMC ” in the collimation and cleaning sections. 1. 1 BLMA Under good conditions, most of the normal “beam lifetime losses ” will be caught by primary and secondary collimators in the (warm) cleaning sections. The re-maining losses {{in the rest of}} the ring will be typically 100 times below the quench level. • The main function of the ring beam loss monitors is to quickly detect acci-dental losses in other regions of the machine. Among the possible reasons for such losses are large orbit bumps, and coincidences of reduced aper-ture (from misalignment, <b>bellow</b> or <b>pipe</b> movements) and magnet failures or power converter trips. • Back up and special operation: for special studies (machine development, aperture studies) or by accident, the cleaning collimators maybe too far out to guarantee efficient cleaning in the cleaning sections. • The (ring) BLMA are also important for monitoring and optimizatio...|$|R

40|$|For {{the design}} and {{calibration}} of the LHC beam loss monitoring (BLM) system {{it is essential to}} have good predictions of the expected longitudinal loss distributions. For this purpose, a complete and detailed aperture model of the LHC arc and dispersion suppressor (DS) was compiled and applied to the tracking of halo particles originating from the betatron cleaning insertion for proton and ion beams. The positions of all beam <b>pipe</b> <b>bellows</b> are included in the model as well. Therefore, it is possible to investigate the loss pattern due to misalignment effects, in addition to steady beam losses (beam halo, beam-beam and beam-rest gas interactions) and orbit errors. For proton beams the model was applied within the tracking code MAD-X [1]. Resulting loss maps are presented in this paper. The simulation for the ion beam halo is presented in [8]. The model served to identify critical loss positions. The implication of both simulations for the BLM design are discussed...|$|R

40|$|A {{computer}} controlled mechanical lung {{model has been}} developed for testing lung function equipment, validation of computer programs and simulation of impaired pulmonary mechanics. The construction, function and some applications are described. The physical model is constructed from two <b>bellows</b> and a <b>pipe</b> system representing the alveolar lung compartments of both lungs and airways, respectively. The bellows are surrounded by water simulating pleural and interstitial space. Volume changes of the bellows are accomplished via the fluid by a piston. The piston is driven by a servo-controlled electrical motor whose input is generated by a microcomputer. A wide range of breathing patterns can be simulated. The pipe system representing the trachea connects both bellows to the ambient air and is provided with exchangeable parts with known resistance. A compressible element (CE) can be inserted into the pipe system. The fluid-filled space around the CE is connected with the water compartment around the bellows; The CE is made from a stretched Penrose drain. The outlet of the pipe system can be interrupted at the command of an external microcomputer system. An automatic sequence of measurements can be programmed and is executed without the interaction of a technician...|$|R
40|$|Bellows are an {{integral}} part of the containment pressure boundary in nuclear power plants. They are used at piping penetrations to allow relative movement between piping and the containment wall, while minimizing the load imposed on the piping and wall. <b>Piping</b> <b>bellows</b> are primarily used in steel containments; however, they have received limited use in some concrete (reinforced and prestressed) containments. In a severe accident they may be subjected to pressure and temperature conditions that exceed the design values, along with a combination of axial and lateral deflections. A test program to determine the leak-tight capacity of containment penetration bellows is being conducted at Sandia National Laboratories under the sponsorship of the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Several different bellows geometries, representative of actual containment bellows, have been subjected to extreme deflections along with pressure and temperature loads. The bellows geometries and loading conditions are described along with the testing apparatus and procedures. A total of nineteen bellows have been tested. Thirteen bellows were tested in ``like-new`` condition (results reported in Volume 1), and six were tested in a corroded condition. The tests showed that bellows in ``like-new`` condition are capable of withstanding relatively large deformations, up to, or near, the point of full compression or elongation, before developing leakage, while those in a corroded condition did not perform as well, depending on the amount of corrosion. The corroded bellows test program and results are presented in this report...|$|R
40|$|On {{classical}} passenger trains, {{the secondary}} Suspension is commonly ensured by airsprings which are integrated in a pneumatic circuit. In {{addition to the}} pneumatic bellows. the circuit contains various pneumatic components such as tanks, pipes, orifices, levelling valves. etc., {{the purpose of the}} latter being, to maintain a costant height between the carbody and the bogie. These elements can be connected in several ways leading, to many existing suspension topologies. This paper deals with multidisciplinary modelling of a vehicle equipped with such a suspension taking into account both multibody and pneumatic aspects. First, it depicts in more detail the various elements of a pneumatic; suspension. Then, many criteria that influence the suspension morphology are presented: the kind of bogie, the use of an auxiliary tank, the position of this tank relative to the bellows, the kind of levelling system, the use of all additional anti-roll bar, the use of an additional hydraulic damper, etc. The description of the complete pneumatic Circuit implies the use of thermodynamic models which take into account the airflow through the pipes and the valves, the pressure in the <b>bellows,</b> etc, Several <b>pipe</b> models are presented, the choice depending on the length of the pipe: an algebraic model is sufficient for short pipes, while a differential model is needed {{to take into account the}} dynamics of longer pipes. The pneumatic model is then coupled with a SIMPACK multibody model in order to analyse the behaviour of the complete vehicle. Two-point and four-point configurations are compared for Delta Q/Q and curve entry tests...|$|R
5000|$|The {{report of}} the court of inquiry was {{critical}} of {{the installation of the}} bypass pipework on a number of counts: although plant and senior management were chartered engineers (mostly chemical engineers) the post of Works Engineer which had been occupied by a chartered mechanical engineer had been vacant since January 1974 and {{at the time of the}} accident there were no professionally qualified engineers in the works engineering department. Nypro had recognised this to be a weakness and identified a senior mechanical engineer in an NCB subsidiary as available to provide advice and support if requested. At a meeting of plant and engineering managers to discuss the failure of Reactor 5, the external mechanical engineer was not present. The emphasis was upon prompt restart and - the inquiry felt - although this did not lead to the deliberate acceptance of hazards, it led to the adoption of a course of action whose hazards (and indeed engineering practicalities) were not adequately considered or understood. The major problem was thought to be getting reactor 5 moved out of the way. Only the plant engineer was concerned about restarting before the reason for the failure was understood, and the other reactors inspected. The difference in elevation between reactor 4 outlet and reactor 6 inlet was not recognised at the meeting. At a working level the offset was accommodated by a dog-leg in the bypass assembly; a section sloping downwards inserted between (and joined with by mitre welds) two horizontal lengths of 20-inch pipe abutting the existing 28-inch stubs. This bypass was supported by scaffolding fitted with supports provided to prevent the bellows having to take the weight of the pipework between them, but with no provision against other loadings. The Inquiry noted on the [...] "design" [...] of the assembly: No-one appreciated that the pressurised assembly would be subject to a turning moment imposing shear forces on the bellows for which they are not designed. Nor did anyone appreciate that the hydraulic thrust on the bellows (some 38 tonnes at working pressure) would tend to make the pipe buckle at the mitre joints. No calculations were done to ascertain whether the <b>bellows</b> or <b>pipe</b> would withstand these strains; no reference was made to the relevant British Standard, or any other accepted standard; no reference was made to the designer's guide issued by the manufacturers of the bellows; no drawing of the pipe was made, other than in chalk on the workshop floor; no pressure testing either of the pipe or the complete assembly was made before it was fitted.|$|R
