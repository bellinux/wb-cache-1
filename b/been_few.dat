5|$|A popular myth is that {{sharks are}} immune to disease and cancer, {{but this is}} not scientifically supported. Sharks have been known to get cancer. Both {{diseases}} and parasites affect sharks. The evidence that sharks are at least resistant to cancer and disease is mostly anecdotal and there have <b>been</b> <b>few,</b> if any, scientific or statistical studies that show sharks to have heightened immunity to disease.|$|E

A 2011 Consumer Reports study compared Proactiv with two less expensive types of benzoyl peroxide, AcneFree and OXY Maximum, and found all three to be equally effective. The US Food and Drug Administration warned in 2014 that over-the-counter acne treatments can cause severe irritation, as well as rare but life-threatening allergic reactions.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{dominance}} of rugby union there have <b>been</b> <b>few</b> football teams of note {{in the history of}} the Rhondda Valleys. Several teams were formed around the end of the 19th century, but most folded during the depression, including Cwmparc F.C. in 1926 and Mid-Rhondda in 1928. The most successful club from the area is Ton Pentre F.C..|$|E

5|$|The AACAP {{guidelines}} {{state that}} children with reactive attachment disorder are presumed to have grossly disturbed internal models for relating to others. However, the course of RAD is not well studied and there have <b>been</b> <b>few</b> efforts to examine symptom patterns over time.

5|$|After 1492, {{a global}} {{exchange}} of previously local {{crops and livestock}} breeds occurred. Maize, potatoes, sweet potatoes and manioc were the key crops that spread from the New World to the Old, while varieties of wheat, barley, rice and turnips traveled from the Old World to the New. There had <b>been</b> <b>few</b> livestock species in the New World, with horses, cattle, sheep and goats being completely unknown before their arrival with Old World settlers. Crops moving in both directions across the Atlantic Ocean caused population growth {{around the world and}} a lasting effect on many cultures. Maize and cassava were introduced from Brazil into Africa by Portuguese traders in the 16th century, becoming staple foods, replacing native African crops.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the chorus}} and {{orchestra}} of Welsh National Opera {{have appeared on}} many commercial recordings, often featuring regular WNO soloists, there have <b>been</b> <b>few</b> sets, either audio or video, of the company's own productions.

5|$|Harvard {{was able}} to secure {{substantial}} new funding for its botanical programs {{in the years after}} the war, but Gray encountered significant trouble finding a suitable replacement for his professorial duties. The American university system had failed to train replacements for its professors. Only Harvard and Yale had botany programs, and in the war and pre-war years there had <b>been</b> <b>few</b> botany students. However, after the war there was an upswing in the numbers of botany students. Gray was grooming Horace Mann Jr. as his replacement, but he died of tuberculosis at the age of 24 in November 1868.|$|E
5|$|Having {{released}} the Empress, Stephen focused on pacifying the south-west of England. Although there had <b>been</b> <b>few</b> new defections to the Empress, his enemies now controlled a compact block of territory stretching out from Gloucester and Bristol south-west into Devon and Cornwall, west into the Welsh Marches and east {{as far as}} Oxford and Wallingford, threatening London. Stephen started by attacking Wallingford Castle, held by the Empress's childhood friend Brien FitzCount, only to find it too well defended. Stephen left behind some forces to blockade the castle and continued west into Wiltshire to attack Trowbridge, taking the castles of South Cerney and Malmesbury en route. Meanwhile, Miles of Gloucester marched east, attacking Stephen's rearguard forces at Wallingford and threatening an advance on London. Stephen was forced {{to give up his}} western campaign, returning east to stabilise the situation and protect his capital.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} widely practiced {{treatments}} for speech disorders associated with Parkinson's disease is the Lee Silverman voice treatment (LSVT). Speech therapy and specifically LSVT may improve speech. Occupational therapy (OT) aims to promote health and quality of life by helping people with the disease to participate in as many of their daily living activities as possible. There have <b>been</b> <b>few</b> studies on the effectiveness of OT and their quality is poor, although there is some indication that it may improve motor skills and quality of life {{for the duration of the}} therapy.|$|E

A 2007 study saw inflammatory lesions reduced by 39 percent in subjects {{using a combination of}} butenafine and benzoyl peroxide, compared with 34 percent in those using Proactiv containing only benzoyl peroxide. A physician suggested in Salon that its three-step system might make it easier for teenagers to comply, but that the key to its success lay with its celebrity endorsements.|$|E

Though in general Marx had a blind {{faith in his}} closest friends, nevertheless he himself complained that he was sometimes too mistrustful and unjust even to them. His verdicts, not only about enemies but even about friends, were sometimes so harsh that even less sensitive people would take offence… There must have <b>been</b> <b>few</b> whom he did not criticize like this… not even Engels was an exception.|$|E
5|$|There have <b>been</b> <b>few</b> {{accidents}} at Waterloo {{compared to}} other London terminal stations. On 21 August 1896, an engine leaving the locomotive yard overran its clearance point, colliding with a departing passenger train. Five passengers were injured. On 5 May 1904, a linesman accidentally stepped on a signal wire. This gave a false clear signal to a goods van, which collided with a passenger train, killing one, while on 25 October 1913, a collision between two passenger trains at Waterloo Junction killed three people.|$|E

5|$|By 1797, Britain {{and the new}} French Republic {{had been}} engaged in the French Revolutionary Wars for nearly four years. Although there had been {{significant}} fighting in Europe, the East Indies had remained largely under British control. French forces in the region were limited, and apart from a few raiding cruises the French squadron in the region had been under intermittent blockade at Île de France. The Royal Navy, commanded in Eastern waters by Rear-Admiral Peter Rainier had focused on commerce protection {{and the elimination of}} the colonies of the French-allied Batavian Republic, capturing Dutch Ceylon, the Dutch Cape Colony and parts of the Dutch East Indies in 1795 and 1796. Rainier had been engaged in pacifying local uprisings around Malacca during {{the latter part of the}} campaign, and there had <b>been</b> <b>few</b> forces left in reserve to protect British interests in the Indian Ocean.|$|E
5|$|Major {{rebuilding}} work {{took place}} in the later part of the 15thcentury. It is thought that it began with the south arcade, followed by the north arcade and the addition of a clerestory. The rebuilding was probably complete by about 1525, although the north aisle may not have been completely re-roofed until the early 17thcentury. The west porch was probably started in the 14thcentury, and the upper two storeys added in the following century. The nave roof was repaired in 1615. During the civil war, while nearby Biddulph Hall was under siege, SirWilliam Brereton's Roundheads stabled their horses in the church. They damaged the medieval glass windows and removed some of the church furniture, including the organ. There have <b>been</b> <b>few</b> significant changes since that time. The church was restored during the 19thcentury by Anthony Salvin, and later, in about 1857, by George Gilbert Scott, who removed plaster from the walls and built a small gallery. During the Victorian era, the reredos and most of the stained glass were added.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} literary {{references to}} Arthur come from Welsh and Breton sources. There have <b>been</b> <b>few</b> attempts {{to define the}} nature and character of Arthur in the pre-Galfridian tradition as a whole, {{rather than in a}} single text or text/story-type. A 2007 academic survey that does attempt this by Thomas Green identifies three key strands to the portrayal of Arthur in this earliest material. The first is that he was a peerless warrior who functioned as the monster-hunting protector of Britain from all internal and external threats. Some of these are human threats, such as the Saxons he fights in the Historia Brittonum, but the majority are supernatural, including giant cat-monsters, destructive divine boars, dragons, dogheads, giants, and witches. The second is that the pre-Galfridian Arthur was a figure of folklore (particularly topographic or onomastic folklore) and localised magical wonder-tales, the leader of a band of superhuman heroes who live in the wilds of the landscape. The third and final strand is that the early Welsh Arthur had a close connection with the Welsh Otherworld Annwn. On the one hand, he launches assaults on Otherworldly fortresses in search of treasure and frees their prisoners. On the other, his warband in the earliest sources includes former pagan gods, and his wife and his possessions are clearly Otherworldly in origin.|$|E
