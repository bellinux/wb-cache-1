50|$|A {{registered}} {{instrument is}} a form of property, such as shares or bonds, where records are kept of who owns the underlying property, or of the transactions involving transfer of ownership such as a company's share register. They may be contrasted with <b>bearer</b> <b>instruments</b> in which no records are kept of ownership or transfers.|$|R
50|$|Blank {{endorsement}} {{of a financial}} instrument, such as a cheque, is only a signature, not indicating the payee. The effect {{of this is that}} it is payable only to the bearer - legally, it transforms an order instrument ("pay to the order of (the payee)") into a <b>bearer</b> <b>instrument</b> ("pay to the bearer"). It is one of the types of {{endorsement of}} a negotiable instrument.|$|E
50|$|While bearer {{instruments}} are rarely created as such, a holder of commercial paper with the holder designated as payee {{can change the}} instrument to a <b>bearer</b> <b>instrument</b> by an endorsement. The proper holder simply signs {{the back of the}} instrument and the instrument becomes bearer paper, although in recent years, third party checks are not being honored by most banks unless the original payee has signed a notarized document stating such.|$|E
5000|$|In the United States, {{under the}} Uniform Commercial Code, a {{negotiable}} instrument (such {{as a check}} or promissory note) that is payable {{to the order of}} [...] "bearer" [...] or [...] "cash" [...] may be enforced (i.e. redeemed for payment) by the party in possession. The payee (i.e. the person named in the [...] "pay to" [...] line) may also convert an instrument into a <b>bearer</b> <b>instrument</b> by endorsing (signing) the back. In practice, however, many merchants and financial institutions will not pay a check presented for payment by anyone other than the named payee.|$|E

50|$|A <b>bearer</b> <b>instrument</b> is a {{document}} that entitles the holder of the document rights of ownership or title to the underlying property, such as shares or bonds. Bearer instruments differ from normal registered instruments, in that no record is kept of who owns the underlying property, or of the transactions involving transfer of ownership. Whoever physically holds the bearer document {{is assumed to be}} the owner of the property. This is useful for investors and corporate officers who wish to retain anonymity, but ownership (or legal entitlement) is extremely difficult to establish in event of loss or theft.|$|E
50|$|A {{bearer stock}} certificate, {{as its name}} implies is a <b>bearer</b> <b>instrument,</b> and {{physical}} possession of the certificate entitles the holder to exercise all legal rights associated with the stock. Bearer stock certificates are becoming uncommon: they were popular in offshore jurisdictions for their perceived confidentiality, and as a useful way to transfer beneficial title to assets (held by the corporation) without payment of stamp duty. International initiatives have curbed the use of bearer stock certificates in offshore jurisdictions, and tend to be available only in onshore financial centres, although they are rarely seen in practice.|$|E
5000|$|A {{bearer bond}} is a bond or debt {{security}} issued by a business entity {{such as a}} corporation, or a government. As a <b>bearer</b> <b>instrument,</b> it differs from the more common types of investment securities {{in that it is}} unregistered [...] - [...] no records are kept of the owner, or the transactions involving ownership. Whoever physically holds the paper on which the bond is issued owns the instrument. This is useful for investors who wish to retain anonymity. Recovery of the value of a bearer bond in the event of its loss, theft, or destruction is usually impossible. Some relief is possible in the case of United States public debt.|$|E

50|$|A cheque is a {{negotiable}} instrument instructing {{a financial institution}} to pay a specific amount of a specific currency from a specified transactional account held in the drawer's name with that institution. Both the drawer and payee may be natural persons or legal entities. Cheques are order instruments, and are not in general payable simply to the <b>bearer</b> as <b>bearer</b> <b>instruments</b> are, but must {{be paid to the}} payee. In some countries, such as the US, the payee may endorse the cheque, allowing them to specify a third party to whom it should be paid.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} avoid detection, criminals often retain the {{proceeds}} of their crimes in cash or use <b>bearer</b> negotiable <b>instruments</b> in connection with their money laundering activities. As part of global regulatory measures designed to minimise risks of money laundering and financing of terrorism, financial institutions and other designated businesses in most countries are required to report certain financial transactions to government regulators. This has increased the probability that transactions involving the proceeds of crime will be detected and reported officially. In {{order to avoid}} such detection, serious criminals may simply retain the proceeds of their crimes in cash or use <b>bearer</b> negotiable <b>instruments</b> in connection with their money laundering activities. Although not a new concern, the illegal movement of cash and <b>bearer</b> negotiable <b>instruments</b> across borders {{is likely to continue}} and although such movements are now regulated, criminals will continue to devise new strategies to circumvent regulatory controls. This paper by the Australian Institute of Criminology explores the ways in which covert movements of currency and <b>bearer</b> negotiable <b>instruments</b> currently take place and reviews the regulatory measures that exist to address such activities in Australia. Increased detection and enforcement action, coupled with intensive data collection and analysis, are likely to be the most effective ways in which to address this way of laundering the proceeds of crime...|$|R

5000|$|The {{scope of}} stamp duty {{has been reduced}} {{dramatically}} in recent years. Apart from transfers of shares and securities, the issue of <b>bearer</b> <b>instruments</b> and certain transactions involving partnerships, stamp duty was largely abolished in the UK from 1 December 2003. [...] "Stamp duty land tax" [...] (SDLT), a new transfer tax derived from stamp duty, was introduced for land transactions from 1 December 2003. [...] "Stamp duty reserve tax" [...] (SDRT) was introduced on agreements to transfer uncertificated shares and other securities in 1986, and {{with the growth of}} paperless transactions SDRT rather than stamp duty now applies to most transfers of shares and securities. Stamp duty land tax was replaced on transactions in Scotland by the new Land and Buildings Transaction Tax (LBTT) from 1 April 2015.|$|R
25|$|Historically, in many countries, a {{contract}} {{needs to have}} a stamp affixed to make it valid. The charge for the stamp is either a fixed amount or a percentage {{of the value of the}} transaction. In most countries, the stamp has been abolished but stamp duty remains. Stamp duty is levied in the UK on the purchase of shares and securities, the issue of <b>bearer</b> <b>instruments,</b> and certain partnership transactions. Its modern derivatives, stamp duty reserve tax and stamp duty land tax, are respectively charged on transactions involving securities and land. Stamp duty has the effect of discouraging speculative purchases of assets by decreasing liquidity. In the United States, transfer tax is often charged by the state or local government and (in the case of real property transfers) can be tied to the recording of the deed or other transfer documents.|$|R

50|$|The LLC is {{required}} to report all prizes greater than $600 to the IRS and the Louisiana Department of Revenue. For winners with a U.S.-issued Social Security number, prizes of $5,000 or more are subject to Louisiana income tax withholding, and also have federal tax withheld. Unpaid child support owed by the winner may also be withheld. Annuitized prizes are {{the property of the}} winner’s estate in the event of death. Lottery tickets are <b>bearer</b> <b>instruments,</b> which means that the Lottery must pay the holder of a winning ticket presented for payment. Signing the back of the ticket {{is the single most important}} thing one can do to help protect themselves from theft and demonstrate ownership of the ticket. Any alteration to a winning ticket worth more than $600 is cause for an immediate security investigation. Once a winning ticket has been paid, however, it is much more difficult to determine whether another individual was the rightful owner. By law, the Lottery can pay a winning ticket only once.|$|R

Drummers summoned men from their farms and ranches to muster for duty. In the chaotic environment of the battlefield, musical instruments were the only means of commanding the men to advance, stand or retire. In the mid 19th century each smaller unit had their own fifer and drummer, who sounded the daily routine. When units massed for battle a band of musicians was formed for the whole.|$|R

40|$|Central banks need to {{forecast}} banknote demand. It determines {{the number of}} notes they need printed and the future distribution network required. Yet forecasting demand is an inherently complex problem - banknotes are anonymous <b>bearer</b> <b>instruments</b> {{and so many of}} the sources of demand are difficult to research. This paper sets out a framework for identifying and assessing drivers likely to influence banknote demand. It presents, for the first time, the findings from an econometric model, looking at the past relationship between demand for Bank of England notes and a range of economic variables and cash industry statistics, to help forecast future demand. But this approach has its limitations. There will be determinants of demand not included in the model. Furthermore, what is to say that past relationships will hold into the future? Perhaps we are now approaching a point of inflection - a paradigm shift in the demand for cash that causes the pre-existing relationships to break down. To account for this, central banks must continue to research cash demand, its current and future drivers, and how significant they might be going forward. They must look for leading indicators that suggest a break with the past, and attempt to understand how, and when, the impact of technological change may significantly change the trajectory of cash use. This paper will set out a structure for capturing all of this information and using it to make judgements on the future of cash. Whilst it might improve central bank 2 ̆ 019 s forecasting capability, and thus the basis for policy decisions, it will not eliminate all uncertainty. Therefore, central banks must retain flexibility, and ensure the wider cash industry does as well. There is a future for cash but we must constantly be alert to events that might change what that future looks like...|$|R

40|$|AbstractFATF Special Recommendation IX (SR IX) {{focuses on}} cross border {{declaration}} or disclosure {{with the objective}} to detect and prevent illicit cross-border transportation of cash and <b>bearer</b> negotiable <b>instruments.</b> In complying with the recommendation, countries are required to i) have measures for detection, ii) ensure that relevant authorities are competent to stop or restrain and iii) ensure that effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions are available to deal with any irregularities. However, there are countries which are still struggling {{to comply with the}} special recommendation since it is challenging. Therefore, this study investigates on the compliance ratings of 40 countries on FATF Special Recommendation IX (SR IX) based on Mutual Evaluation Reports issued by Asia Pacific Group on Money Laundering (also known as APG). Based on the Mutual Evaluation Reports, this study also looks into recommendation and comments given by respective panels. The compliance ratings together with panel's recommendation and comments compiled in this study will be helpful to relevant authorities for their countries’ future improvement. The findings will also highlight on issues related to cross border declaration or disclosure for future research...|$|R
5000|$|A {{completely}} different interpretation of Jesus words [...] "render unto Caesar what is Caesar's...etc." [...] {{has been proposed}} by some writers (see, for example, Jeffrey Barr, Ned Netterville, Darrell Anderson, Timmothy Patton,. This same incident with small differences is also recorded in the Gospels of Matthew (22:15-22) and Luke (20:20-26). Luke's Gospel makes it abundantly clear what the purpose was of asking Jesus {{whether or not to}} pay Caesar's tax, to wit: [...] "They hoped to catch Jesus in something he said, so that they might hand him over to the power and authority of the governor." [...] Obviously, the chief priests who devised the trap were confident Jesus would denounce Caesar's tax (as a violation of God's commandment against stealing extortion including taxation). Clearly, they did not think Jesus would endorse Caesar tax. There is no basis in the Gospels, or any other history, for supposing that the chief priests thought Jesus might say, [...] "You should pay Caesar's tax (a form of extortion and violation of God's Commandment against stealing. [...] )." [...] Since Pilate was Caesar's commissioner of taxation for Judea, Jesus' denunciation of the tax would earn him a death sentence. In order to know what Jesus meant by his ambiguous response it is necessary to know what Jesus thought belongs to Caesar and what belongs to God respectively. Since Jesus repeatedly justified himself and his teaching by reference to sacred Jewish Scripture, his thoughts on the subject of who owns what would also be influenced by or based on the authority of the Bible. And Scripture states in Psalm 24, verse 1, [...] "The earth is the Lord’s, and everything in it...", which leaves nothing whatsoever for poor old Caesar, and nothing is exactly what Jesus was telling his listeners they should pay to Caesar in taxes. The spies were bamboozled by his response because they obviously were not familiar with Scripture, but when they told their bosses what Jesus had said, the chief priest who knew Scripture were not fooled. So the next day they sent armed men to arrest Jesus at Gethsemane. They dragged him before Pilate and said to him, [...] "We have found this man subverting our nation. He opposes payment of taxes to Caesar...He stirs up the people all over Judea by his teaching. He started in Galilee and has come all the way here." [...] (Luke 23:2-5 [...] ) Another point opposed to the foregoing interpretation is that the coin in question obviously did not belong to Caesar but rather to the man who produced it when Jesus asked, and whose it was. Coins are <b>bearer</b> <b>instruments</b> that belong to their possessor. (see,) ...|$|R
40|$|By {{means of}} notorious chameleonic and {{metamorphic}} abilities, capitalism modifies societies, through silent historical pathways, indelible processes and accurate objectives. Following its nature, capitalism appropriates the formerly autonomous realm of arts, until then {{ruled by the}} independence and specific rules of the artists, <b>bearers</b> of control <b>instruments,</b> and specific mechanisms of choice and selection. The primal incompatibility between the artistic field and capitalism move into a stage where societies are steadily transformed in the consecration of an ‘artsy’ world, present in multiple dimensions, from the fashion industry to architecture, cinema and shopping malls, uttered in tasteless and swift changes. The authors reflect {{on the existence of}} a society based on hybridity, a constant search for pleasure, seduction and novelty, enterprising an impoverished artistic economy, disconnected from the erudite culture which reaches its climax in the ‘hypermodern epoch’, being characterised by ‘trans-aesthetic capitalism’ globally. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
