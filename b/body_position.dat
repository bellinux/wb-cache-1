5|$|An {{alternative}} {{interpretation of}} potbelly monuments {{is that they}} were representations of rulership. This is suggested by the <b>body</b> <b>position</b> represented in the sculptures, the type of adornment sometimes depicted on them, the pedestals on which they sometimes sit and the ceremonial sites where they are found as well as their locations within such sites. The potbelly <b>body</b> <b>position</b> is symbolic of rulership; the figures are seated cross-legged and with the arms wrapping the body or holding an object. Twenty-five potbelly monuments are known to display a collar as neck jewellery, again suggestive of rulership. Pedestal bases are known from potbelly sculptures from Sin Cabezas, Antigua Guatemala, Kaminaljuyu, Santa Cruz del Quiché, Takalik Abaj, Tikal, Ujuxte, El Balsamo, Los Cerritos and La Nueva in Guatemala, Chalchuapa in El Salvador, and Copán in Honduras. This represents 42% of sites with potbelly sculptures. If pedestals are equivalent to thrones then Bilbao Monument 58 is also relevant, which was found associated with a four-legged stone altar or throne and may originally have been positioned on top of it.|$|E

Persons with neurological/neuromuscular abnormalities may have breathing difficulties due to weak or paralyzed intercostal, abdominal and/or other muscles needed for ventilation. Some physical therapy interventions for this population include active assisted cough techniques, volume augmentation such as breath stacking, education about <b>body</b> <b>position</b> and ventilation patterns and movement strategies to facilitate breathing.|$|E

25|$|The most usual leg {{movement}} {{with the front}} crawl is called the flutter kick. The legs move alternately, with one leg kicking downward while the other leg moves upward. While the legs provide {{only a small part}} of the overall speed, they are important to stabilize the <b>body</b> <b>position.</b> This lack of balance is apparent when using a pull buoy to neutralize the leg action.|$|E
25|$|The term 'icon' {{comes from}} the Greek word eikon, which simply means image. The Orthodox believe that the first icons of Christ and the Virgin Mary were painted by Luke the Evangelist. Icons are filled with {{symbolism}} designed to convey information about the person or event depicted. For this reason, icons tend to be formulaic, following a prescribed methodology for how a particular person should be depicted, including hair style, <b>body</b> <b>position,</b> clothing, and background details.|$|E
25|$|Awakening {{can mean}} the end of sleep, or simply a moment to survey the {{environment}} and readjust <b>body</b> <b>position</b> before falling back asleep. Sleepers typically awaken soon after the end of a REM phase or sometimes in the middle of REM. Internal circadian indicators, along with successful reduction of homeostatic sleep need, typically bring about awakening {{and the end of the}} sleep episode. Awakening involves heightened electrical activation in the brain, beginning with the thalamus and spreading throughout the cortex.|$|E
30|$|Given that images {{increase}} data traffic, {{there have}} been a number of studies on the reconstruction of video conferences by extracting and transmitting only a user's features from photographed images. For example, it has been shown that medical advice can be obtained through a telemedicine system to perform an operation [5]. Here, a depth-map was extracted from the photographed images, and then, a distance user was represented. In other studies on virtual humans for video conferences, body features were extracted from photographed images [1]. After locating the <b>body</b> <b>positions</b> by identifying the hands and face, the <b>body</b> <b>positions</b> were transmitted. Then, the virtual human gestures by referencing the transmitted <b>body</b> <b>positions.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{hippocampus}} provides {{animals with}} a spatial map of their environment. It stores information regarding non-egocentric space (egocentric means {{in reference to}} one's <b>body</b> <b>position</b> in space) and therefore supports viewpoint independence in spatial memory. This means that it allows for viewpoint manipulation from memory. It is however, important for long-term spatial memory of allocentric space (reference to external cues in space). Maintenance and retrieval of memories are thus relational or context dependent. The hippocampus makes use of reference and working memory and has {{the important role of}} processing information about spatial locations.|$|E
25|$|ASL is a subject-verb-object (SVO) language. This default {{word order}} is {{sometimes}} altered by processes including topicalization and null elements; however, this is marked either with non-manual signals like eyebrow or <b>body</b> <b>position,</b> or with prosodic marking such as pausing. These non-manual grammatical markings (such as eyebrow movement or head-shaking) may optionally {{spread over the}} c-command domain of the node which it is attached to. However, ASL is a pro-drop language, and when the manual sign that a non-manual grammatical marking is attached to is omitted, the non-manual marking obligatorily spreads over the c-command domain.|$|E
25|$|It {{is worth}} noting that in many {{hospitals}} (for instance St. Mark's Hospital, London, which specialises in intestinal and colorectal medicine) colonoscopies are carried out without any sedation. This allows the patient to shift his or her <b>body</b> <b>position</b> to help the doctor carry out the procedure and significantly reduces recovery time and side-effects. Although there is some discomfort when the colon is distended with air, this is not usually particularly painful and it passes relatively quickly. Patients can then be released from hospital on their own very swiftly without any feelings of nausea.|$|E
40|$|Researchers {{argue that}} faces are {{recognized}} via {{the configuration of}} their parts. An important behavioral finding supporting this claim is the face-inversion effect, in which inversion impairs recognition of faces more than nonface objects. Until recently, faces were the only class of objects producing the inversion effect for untrained individuals. This study investigated whether the inversion effect extends to human <b>body</b> <b>positions,</b> a class of objects whose exemplars are structurally similar to each other. Three experiments compared the recognition of upright and inverted faces, houses, and <b>body</b> <b>positions</b> using a forced-choice, same/different paradigm. For both reaction time and error data, the recognition of possible human body postures was more affected by inversion than the recognition of houses. Further the recognition of possible human body postures and recognition of faces showed similar effects of inversion. The inversion effect was diminished,for impossible <b>body</b> <b>positions</b> that violated the biomechanical constraints of human bodies. These data suggest that human <b>body</b> <b>positions,</b> like faces, may be processed configurally by untrained viewers...|$|R

American writer and journalist Glenn O'Brien wrote the essay for the inlay booklet. The compilation charted in the UK, New Zealand and the United States. The artwork {{on the cover of}} the compilation was of another Jones/Goude collaboration; it featured Jones' celestial body in a montage of separate images, following Goude's ideas on creating credible illusions with his cut-and-paint technique. The <b>body</b> <b>position</b> is anatomically impossible.|$|E
25|$|Because of the unorthodox {{nature of}} hand and <b>body</b> <b>position,</b> {{it is often}} {{difficult}} to get a lot of power behind a reverse sweep; in many situations, the intention is to glance or cut the ball to the backward leg area. However, in rare occasions, players have been able to execute reverse sweeps for a six. Kevin Pietersen, who pioneered switch hitting, is adept at this, but one could argue that the resulting shot is basically a sweep rather than a reverse sweep. A more classic example of such a shot would be Yusuf Pathan's six off Robin Peterson. South Africa's AB de Villiers is well known for his ability to hit sixes with the reverse sweep at ease and Glenn Maxwell also often plays reverse sweep.|$|E
25|$|Other {{factors which}} can affect {{decompression}} risk include oxygen concentration, carbon dioxide levels, <b>body</b> <b>position,</b> vasodilators and constrictors, {{positive or negative}} pressure breathing. and dehydration (blood volume). Individual susceptibility to decompression sickness has components which {{can be attributed to}} a specific cause, and components which appear to be random. The random component makes successive decompressions a poor test of susceptibility. Obesity and high serum lipid levels have been implicated by some studies as risk factors, and risk seems to increase with age. Another study has also shown that older subjects tended to bubble more than younger subjects for reasons not yet known, but no trends between weight, body fat, or gender and bubbles were identified, and the question of why some {{people are more likely to}} form bubbles than others remains unclear.|$|E

25|$|Para-alpine skiing {{classification}} is {{the classification}} system for para-alpine skiing designed to insure fair competition between alpine skiers with {{different types of}} disabilities. The classifications are grouped into three general disability types: standing, blind and sitting. Classification governance is handled by International Paralympic Committee Alpine Skiing. Skiers are classified based on medical assessment, and their <b>body</b> <b>position</b> when they ski. Blind skiers are evaluated purely on a medical assessment. Prior to that, several sport governing bodies dealt with classification including the International Sports Organization for the Disabled (ISOD), International Stoke Mandeville Games Federation (ISMWSF), International Blind Sports Federation (IBSA) and Cerebral Palsy International Sports and Recreation Association (CP-ISRA). Some classification systems are governed by bodies other than International Paralympic Committee Alpine Skiing for systems not used in international competition. The sport {{is open to all}} competitors with a visual or physical disability. It is not open to people with intellectual disabilities.|$|E
25|$|Standard {{swimming}} {{calls for}} one breath every third arm recovery or every 1.5 cycles, alternating the sides for breathing. Some swimmers instead {{take a breath}} every cycle, i.e., every second arm recovery, breathing always to the same side. Most competition swimmers will breathe every other stroke, or once a cycle, to a preferred side. However some swimmers can breathe comfortably to both sides. Sprinters will often breathe a predetermined number of times in an entire race. Elite sprinters will breathe once or even no times during a fifty-metre race. For a one hundred metre race sprinters will often breathe every four strokes, once every two cycles, or will start with every four strokes and finish with every two strokes. In water polo and water rescue, the head is often {{kept out of the}} water completely for better visibility and easier breathing, at the price of a much steeper <b>body</b> <b>position</b> and higher drag.|$|E
25|$|Movement {{of fluid}} in the semicircular canals signals the brain about the {{direction}} and speed of rotation of the head – for example, whether we are nodding our head up and down or looking from right to left. Each semicircular canal has a bulbed end, or enlarged portion, that contains hair cells. Rotation of the head causes a flow of fluid, which in turn causes displacement of the top portion of the hair cells that are embedded in the jelly-like cupula. Two other organs {{that are part of}} the vestibular system are the utricle and saccule. These are called the otolithic organs and are responsible for detecting linear acceleration, or movement in a straight line. The hair cells of the otolithic organs are blanketed with a jelly-like layer studded with tiny calcium stones called otoconia. When the head is tilted or the <b>body</b> <b>position</b> is changed with respect to gravity, the displacement of the stones causes the hair cells to bend.|$|E
