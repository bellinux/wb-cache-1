Although sterility is not a requirement in official compendia for nonsterile pharmaceuticals, <b>bioburdens</b> need to be within acceptable limits. Therefore, this study investigated microbial contamination of 10 nonsterile pharmaceuticals frequently delivered to outpatients by identifying and quantifying microbial contaminants and susceptibility pattern testing on the microbes isolated. Methods: The study was carried out at Amana Municipal Hospital in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The protocol for the study involved structured selection of representative tablets, syrups, and capsules from the hospital&rsquo;s outpatient pharmacy. Constitutive microorganisms were elaborated and enumerated using standard microbiologic procedures. Results: Results showed that 50 % of all tested products were heavily contaminated, and the predominant contaminants comprised Klebsiella, Bacillus, and Candida species. Furthermore, {{the results showed that}} the isolated Bacillus and Klebsiella species were resistant to Augmentin&reg; and cloxacillin. The differences in means for cfu/mL and zones of inhibition among the microorganisms isolated were considered significant at P &lt; 0. 05. Conclusion: The nonsterile pharmaceuticals were presumably microbiologically contaminated due to poor handling during dispensing, repackaging, and/or nonadherence to good manufacturing practice. Therefore, training and educating the dispensers, as well as patients, on the proper handling and use of medicines cannot be overemphasized, because these are key aspects in controlling cross-contamination of medicines.

40|$|Diabetic foot wounds are {{commonly}} colonised by taxonomically diverse microbial communities and may additionally be infected with specific pathogens. Since biofilms are demonstrably {{less susceptible to}} antimicrobial agents than are planktonic bacteria, and may be present in chronic wounds, there is increasing interest in their aetiological role. In the current investigation, the presence of structured microbial assemblages in chronic diabetic foot wounds is demonstrated using several visualization methods. Debridement samples, collected from the foot wounds of diabetic patients, were histologically sectioned and examined using bright-field, fluorescence, and environmental scanning electron microscopy and assessed by quantitative differential viable counting. All samples (n = 26) harboured <b>bioburdens</b> in excess of 5 log 10 CFU/g. Microcolonies were identified in 4 / 4 samples by all three microscopy methods, although bright-field and fluorescence microscopy were more effective at highlighting putative biofilm morphology than ESEM.

40|$|Background: Decubitus ulcers, {{also known}} as bedsores or {{pressure}} ulcers, affect millions of hospitalized patients each year. The microflora of chronic wounds such as ulcers most commonly exist in the biofilm phenotype and {{have been known to}} significantly impair normal healing trajectories. Methods: Bacterial tag-encoded FLX amplicon pyrosequencing (bTEFAP), a universal bacterial identification method, was used to identify bacterial populations in 49 decubitus ulcers. Diversity estimators were utilized and wound community compositions analyzed in relation to metadata such as Age, race, gender, and comorbidities. Results: Decubitus ulcers are shown to be polymicrobial in nature with no single bacterium exclusively colonizing the wounds. The microbial community among such ulcers is highly variable. While there are between 3 and 10 primary populations in each wound there can be hundreds of different species present many of which are in trace amounts. There is no clearly significant differences in the microbial ecology of decubitus ulcer in relation to metadata except when considering diabetes. The microbial populations and composition in the decubitus ulcers of diabetics may be significantly different from the communities in non-diabetics.

40|$|Abstract Background Pseudomonas aeruginosa is {{commonly}} associated with contact lens (CL) -related eye infections, for which bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation upon hydrogel CLs is a specific risk factor. Whilst P. aeruginosa has been widely used as a model organism for initial biofilm formation on CLs, in-vitro models that closely reproduce in-vivo conditions have rarely been presented. Results In the current investigation, a novel in-vitro biofilm model for studying the adherence of P. aeruginosa to hydrogel CLs was established. Nutritional and interfacial conditions {{similar to those in}} the eye of a CL wearer were created through the involvement of a solid:liquid and a solid:air interface, shear forces and a complex artificial tear fluid. <b>Bioburdens</b> varied depending on the CL material and biofilm maturation occurred after 72 h incubation. Whilst a range of biofilm morphologies were visualised including dispersed and adherent bacterial cells, aggregates and colonies embedded in extracellular polymer substances (EPS), EPS fibres, mushroom-like formations, and crystalline structures, a compact and heterogeneous biofilm morphology predominated on all CL materials. Conclusions In order to better understand the process of biofilm formation on CLs and to test the efficacy of CL care solutions, representative in-vitro biofilm models are required. Here, we present a three-phase biofilm model that simulates the environment in the eye of a CL wearer and thus generates biofilms which resemble those commonly observed in-situ. </p...|$|R

50|$|A {{widely used}} method for heat {{sterilization}} is the autoclave, sometimes called a converter or steam sterilizer. Autoclaves use steam heated to 121-134 °C under pressure. To achieve sterility, {{the article is}} heated in a chamber by injected steam until the article reaches a time and temperature setpoint. Meantime almost all the air {{is removed from the}} chamber, because air is undesired in the moist heat sterilization process (this is one trait that differ from a typical pressure cooker used for food cooking). The article is then held at that setpoint {{for a period of time}} which varies depending on the <b>bioburden</b> present on the article being sterilized and its resistance (D-value) to steam sterilization. A general cycle would be anywhere between 3 and 15 minutes, (depending on the generated heat) at 121 °C at 100 kPa, which is sufficient to provide a sterility assurance level of 10−4 for a product with a <b>bioburden</b> of 106 and a D-value of 2.0 minutes. Following sterilization, liquids in a pressurized autoclave must be cooled slowly to avoid boiling over when the pressure is released. This may be achieved by gradually depressurizing the sterilization chamber and allowing liquids to evaporate under a negative pressure, while cooling the contents.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bioburden</b> is also {{associated}} with biofouling, where microbes collect {{on the surface of}} a device or inside of fan cooled equipment. In healthcare settings, this increases the risk of Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) or Hospital-acquired infections as pathogens can be spread through contact or through the air to new patients and hospital staff. Fan cooled system are generally avoided in critical care and operating rooms, thus relying on natural convection or liquid cooling to cool devices and equipment. These rooms are also required to maintain negative air pressure so that air may enter the room, but the air cannot exit into other rooms. HEPA filters are also used to collect airborne pathogens larger than 0.3 microns.|$|E
50|$|Wound bed {{preparation}} is an accepted strategy that facilitates wound management interventions. Management of wound exudate, <b>bioburden</b> and debridement are all associated with effective wound cleansing {{and are thus}} integral components of effectual wound bed preparation. Choice of cleansing solution should consider not only the piecemeal wound requirements but also the patient and be reinforced by a sound knowledge/experience base. This knowledge should include insight into bacterial phenotype ‘behaviour’ and the most appropriate methods of management. Current findings indicate that PHMB {{in conjunction with a}} surfactant (betaine) is superior to Ringer’s solution and saline when used as wound cleansers and also appears to demonstrate efficacy when used in wounds where biofilms are suspected or present.|$|E
5000|$|Wound bed {{preparation}} (WBP) is {{a systematic}} approach to wound management by identifying and removing barriers to healing. The concept was originally developed in plastic surgery. [...] In 2000, {{the concept was}} applied to systematizing the treatment of chronic wounds. The 2000 proposals recommended that wound management address the identifiable impediments to healing {{in order to achieve}} more successful outcomes. Three publications appeared that year that focused on the concept of managing the wound healing processes of wound exudate, <b>bioburden</b> and devitalised tissue. Initially, emphasis was placed on debridement, moisture balance and bacterial balance as the three guiding principles of good wound care, {{while at the same time}} recognising that the provision of care includes a vast array of patient, clinical and environmental variables.|$|E
50|$|All wounds are {{considered}} to harbour microorganisms. Management of the bacterial balance is of vital importance if delays in healing are to be avoided. The biological removal of micro-organisms, including potential pathogens, and tissue debris from the wound of an immune-competent patient is a wound cleansing activity that takes place almost immediately after wounding and which helps to reduce the threat of infection. However, a range of risk factors exist that {{increase the likelihood of}} infection intervening and these include; age, depleted nutrition, down-regulation of the immune system, systemic disease, and poor tissue perfusion of oxygen. Thus, in the above circumstances or when a wound has become infected, wound cleansing activities beyond the natural biological processes are required so that the wound <b>bioburden</b> is maintained at a level where the host can remain in control.|$|E
