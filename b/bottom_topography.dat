40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{well-balanced}} unstaggered central finite volume scheme for hyperbolic balance laws with geometrical source terms. In particular we construct {{a new one}} and two-dimensional finite volume method for the numerical solution of shallow water equations on flat/variable <b>bottom</b> <b>topographies.</b> The proposed scheme evolves a non-oscillatory numerical solution on a single grid, avoids the time consuming process of solving Riemann problems arising at the cell interfaces, and is second-order accurate both in space and time. Furthermore, the numerical scheme follows a well-balanced discretization that first discretizes the geometrical source term according to the discretization of the flux terms, and then mimics the surface gradient method and discretizes the water height according to the discretization of the water level. The resulting scheme exactly satisfies the C-property at the discrete level. The proposed scheme is then applied and classical one and two-dimensional shallow water equation problems with flat or variable <b>bottom</b> <b>topographies</b> are successfully solved. The obtained numerical results are in good agreement with corresponding ones appearing in the recent literature, thus confirming the potential and efficiency of the proposed method.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the oscillatory flow induced by progressive gravity waves near a sea bottom covered with three-dimensional ripples. Previous {{works on the}} subject, in which only two-dimensional bottom waviness were considered, are thus extended. By assuming small values of the ratio between ripple amplitude and {{the thickness of the}} bottom boundary layer, the solution is given analytically by means of a perturbation approach. Arbitrary values of the ratio r between fluid displacement and ripple wavelength are considered. For vanishing values of r an asymptotic solution is also determined as an independent check for the previous one. Even though the solution can provide the flow field over arbitrary <b>bottom</b> <b>topographies,</b> detailed results are presented only for the profile of brick-pattern ripples, which is characterized by transverse crests joined by longitudinal bridges. Finally, relevance of the results to understanding the mechanism of three-dimensional ripple formation (brick-pattern ripples, tile ripples) is discussed...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIt {{is in the}} {{interest}} of resident and long-lived benthic foragers to learn to apply efficient foraging tactics throughout their lifetime, thus increasing their individual efficiency. To test whether individuals are capable of applying an individual-specific foraging pattern, we checked for the existence of established foraging routines. Using ventrally attached time-depth recorders, we studied the individual foraging tactics of chick-rearing Crozet shags (Phalacrocorax melanogenis, Blyth 1860), as measured by the consistency in individual daily activity patterns and diving profiles over time. Individuals displayed a fidelity to the time of first daily trip to sea and also a strong fidelity to one, two or three depth ranges day after day. We suggest foraging area fidelity, a behaviour that could help increase foraging efficiency thanks to the memorization of the <b>bottom's</b> <b>topography</b> and the habits of its fauna, as a hypothesis for explaining some of these patterns.

However, once the sloping bottom end wall was introduced, the detected behaviour was qualitatively {{different from that of the}} simulations. This disagreement is thought to be the consequence of nonlinear wave–wave interactions that could not be resolved in the framework of the numerical study.

40|$|Abstract. The {{deformation}} of a nonlinear pulse traveling in a dispersive random medium {{can be studied}} with asymptotic analysis based on separation of scales when the propagation distance is large compared to the correlation length of the random medium. We consider shallow water waves with a spatially random depth. We use a formulation {{in terms of a}} terrain-following Boussinesq system. We compute the effective evolution equation for the front pulse which can be written as a dissipative Kortweg-de Vries equation. We study the soliton dynamics driven by this system. We show, both theoretically and numerically, that a solitary wave is more robust than a linear wave in the early steps of the propagation. However, it eventually decays much faster after a critical distance corresponding to the loss of about half of its initial amplitude. We also perform an asymptotic analysis for a class of random <b>bottom</b> <b>topographies.</b> A universal behavior is captured through the asymptotic analysis of the metric term for the corresponding change to terrain-following coordinates. Within this class we characterize the effective height for highly disordered topographies. The probabilistic asymptotic results are illustrated by performing Monte Carlo simulations with a Schwarz–Christoffel Toolbox...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Nonlinear wave-body {{interactions}} for {{a stationary}} surface-piercing body in water of finite depth with flat and sloping bottoms are simulated in a two-dimensional numerical wave tank, which is constructed mainly {{based on the}} spatially averaged Navier-Stokes equations with the k H model for simulating the turbulence. The equations are discretized based on the finite volume method and the scheme of the pressure implicit splitting of operators is employed to solve the Navier-Stokes equations. By using the force time histories, the mean and higher-harmonic force components are calculated. The computational results are shown {{to be in good}} agreement with experimental and numerical results of other researchers. Then, the horizontal force, the vertical force and the moment on the surface-piercing body under nonlinear regular waves with flat and sloping bottoms are obtained.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a family of}} steady free-surface flow problems in two dimensions, concentrating {{on the effect of}} nonlinearity on the train of gravity waves that appear downstream of a disturbance. By exploiting standard complex variable techniques, these problems are formulated in terms of a coupled system of Bernoulli's equation and an integral equation. When applying a numerical collocation scheme, the Jacobian for the system is dense, as the integral equation forces each of the algebraic equations to depend on each of the unknowns. We present here a strategy for overcoming this challenge, which leads to a numerical scheme that is much more efficient than what is normally employed for these types of problems, allowing for many more grid points over the free surface. In particular, we provide a simple recipe for constructing a sparse approximation to the Jacobian that is used as a preconditioner in a Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov method for solving the nonlinear system.
