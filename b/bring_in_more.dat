5|$|In February 2010, local councillors from Kent and Pas-de-Calais {{announced}} {{they were in}} talks to establish a frequent local rail service between the regional stations along the route. Trains would leave Lille and stop at Calais, Ashford and Stratford before reaching London St Pancras. Currently, Ashford and Calais have an infrequent service and Eurostar trains do not call at Stratford. The initiative is part of Calais' branding {{as part of the}} UK in order to benefit from the 2012 London Olympics but is supported {{on both sides of the}} channel to <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> <b>more</b> commuters.|$|E
5|$|Polar bears can be {{hunted for}} sport in Canada {{with a special}} permit and accompaniment by a local guide. This can be an {{important}} source of income for small communities, as guided hunts <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> <b>more</b> income than selling the polar bear hide on markets. The United States, Russia, Norway, Greenland, and Canada allow subsistence hunting, and Canada distributes hunting permits to indigenous communities. The selling of these permits is a main source of income for many of these communities. Their hides can be used for subsistence purposes, kept as hunting trophies, or can be bought in markets.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{discovery}} of the wreck in 1971, the project became known to the general public and received increasing media attention. This helped <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> <b>more</b> donations and equipment, primarily from private sources. By 1974 the Committee had representatives from the National Maritime Museum, the Royal Navy, the BBC and local organisations. In 1974 the project received royal patronage from Prince Charles, who participated in dives on the site. This attracted yet more publicity, and also more funding and assistance. The initial aims of the Mary Rose Committee were now more officially and definitely confirmed. The Committee had become a registered charity in 1974, which made it easier to raise funds, and the application for excavation and raising of the ship had been officially approved by the UK government.|$|E

5|$|Historians are {{now turning}} to local gazetteers of Ming China for clues {{that would show}} {{consistent}} growth in population. Using the gazetteers, Brook estimates that the overall population under the Chenghua Emperor (r. 1464–1487) was roughly 75 million, despite mid-Ming census figures hovering around 62 million. While prefectures across the empire in the mid-Ming period were reporting either a drop in or stagnant population size, local gazetteers reported massive amounts of incoming vagrant workers with not enough good cultivated land for them to till, so that many would become drifters, conmen, or wood-cutters that contributed to deforestation. The Hongzhi and Zhengde emperors lessened the penalties against those who had fled their home region, while the Jiajing Emperor (r. 1521–67) finally had officials register migrants wherever they had moved or fled in order to <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> <b>more</b> revenues.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{showcase}} the PlayStation Portable's capabilities, {{the team had}} to develop a download system that could provide the game with future downloadable content, which included new tracks, music and ships. In addition, Burrows realised that new downloadable content {{had the potential to}} <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> <b>more</b> revenue for Studio Liverpool. In order to achieve this, the team {{had to find a way}} to bypass the problems involved in getting the PlayStation Portable to recognise download files. The solution required the use of piggybacking game data to a valid format recognised by the PlayStation Portable; in which a dummy file would be used on a web-based Java application.|$|E
5|$|On 11 June, the French bombarded {{the fort}} from land and sea. The fort's {{garrison}} fought back, and its commander, Rechberg, managed to <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> <b>more</b> ammunition from Floriana. On 12 June, the bombardment {{of the fort}} continued, but by then the French had captured Valletta, Floriana, and Fort Manoel. The Maltese militia left the fort, reducing its garrison to 80 men. By {{the end of the}} day, the ammunition had run out, and parts of the fort were damaged during the bombardment. When Rechberg and his soldiers attempted to escape, the French captured them, and the fort was in French hands by 13 June.|$|E

5|$|The World Cup {{was first}} {{televised}} in 1954 {{and is now}} the most widely viewed and followed sporting event in the world. The cumulative audience of all matches of the 2006 World Cup is estimated to be 26.29 billion. 715.1 million individuals watched the final match of this tournament (a ninth of the entire population of the planet). The 2006 World Cup draw, which decided the distribution of teams into groups, was watched by 300 million viewers. The World Cup attracts many sponsors such as Coca-Cola, McDonald's and Adidas. For these companies and many more, being a sponsor strongly impacts their global brands. Host countries typically experience a multimillion-dollar revenue increase from the month-long event. It was predicted that Brazil will <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> <b>more</b> than $11 billion in revenue for the 2014 World Cup.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo, Donatello, and Michelangelo {{plan their}} next move, while Donatello discovers the next portal will open over Winters' tower. Splinter tells Leonardo {{that his team}} is incomplete, and that {{he knows what he}} must do. After 11 monsters have been captured, General Aguila {{questions}} Yaotl's actions. The generals conspire to betray Yaotl, wanting to remain immortal. Raphael encounters the Jersey Devil, one of the remaining monsters but drives it off. Leonardo fights Raphael, but when he breaks Leonardo's swords, Raphael is forced to leave. The generals seize Leonardo, intending to substitute him for the 13th missing beast, and Raphael decides to make amends by rescuing Leonardo. As the portal opens, Yaotl discovers his generals' treachery, while Splinter and the Turtles, accompanied by Casey and April, fight their way through the Foot Clan cordon and breach the tower. Yaotl reveals the truth to the heroes: he wants to be free of his curse of immortality. The generals reveal that they wish to preserve their immortality, but also to use the portal to <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> <b>more</b> monsters to conquer the world.|$|E

25|$|Reclassifying an HUC as a {{component}} city likely involves not only amending the concerned city's charter, but also the Local Government Code, as currently there is no provision in the LGC that allows this, nor are there any precedents.

25|$|After she has {{fixed the}} {{position}} of the nest, she begins to build the nest. She repeats the procedure of bringing in a pulp, attaching it to the nest to form a spindle and flying back out to <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> <b>more</b> pulps. During this process, the queen clings to the nest with her two posterior pairs of legs and attaches the pulp using her anterior legs and mouth parts. She builds 20–30 cells before initial egg-laying, fashioning a petiole and producing a single cell at the end of it. Six further cells are then added around this to produce the characteristic hexagonal shape of the nest cells. One egg is laid in each cell, and as it hatches, each larva holds itself in the vertical cell by pressing its body against the sides.|$|E
25|$|During a game, {{players are}} given a pre-determined amount of {{reinforcement}} points, with which to purchase units with varying costs. Once the player deploys the units they purchase, they must wait 20 seconds {{for them to be}} airdropped to the field. If a unit is destroyed, the points are refunded to the player in order to allow them to <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> <b>more</b> units. During the single-player campaign, most missions vary what units the player can recruit, while some missions will offer the opportunity to recruit free units, though these cannot be replaced if destroyed. Each unit has strengths and weaknesses, such as mobile anti-air guns being most effective against enemy helicopters, and repair tanks being most effective at keeping vehicles and armor repaired. Each unit possesses a defensive ability, such as deploying smokescreens, while some units possess an offensive ability, such as marking targets for bombardment or using grenade launchers on enemy infantry. Once a unit's special ability(ies) has been spent, players must wait for them to recharge before they can be used again.|$|E
