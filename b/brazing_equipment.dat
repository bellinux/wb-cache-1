40|$|As an {{alternative}} to oven brazing a brazing, process has been developed {{which is based on}} local electric heating, such as resistance or induction heating. Joining is executed in an inert gas atmosphere e. g. argon or nitrogen or in a weak reducing atmosphere, e. g. forming gas with a maximum of 10 % hydrogen, thus eliminating the necessity of applying aggressive flux material. Steel, Cr-Ni-steel, hard metal as well as brass alloys, can be brazed flux free. The joint surfaces are activated by means of heat, which causes the oxide layer to crack and spall. It will be demonstrated that different metals require different temperatures for the breaking of the oxide layer to occur and, thus, for wetting of the braze. Inert gas brazing with local heating is currently employed in the industry. Manual and automatic <b>brazing</b> <b>equipment</b> for this procedure is commercially available...|$|E
40|$|Literature is {{reviewed}} on {{the fabrication}} of Monel, mild steel and <b>brazed</b> <b>equipment</b> {{for use in}} the production of fluorine. The results of an experimental study on the welding of Monel components for a fluorine cell experimental plant are presented and the fabrication of equipment used in the plant is described. The corrosion history of the equipment after three months of continuous operation is outlined...|$|R
