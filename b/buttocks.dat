5|$|When {{this episode}} was being produced, The Bachelorette was a {{bigger and more}} {{prolific}} program than when this episode was originally broadcast. In addition, ABC was not doing very well {{at the time of}} this episode's production. The production staff encountered some trouble when deciding what Peter would be doing in the lobby with Cleveland during his Bachelorette audition; although the series could never come up with ideas they deemed to be suitable, they intended for Peter to put his <b>buttocks</b> in an aquarium tank in order to embarrass Cleveland and make him want to leave. This scene was not used, and the production staff used a scene of Peter putting his naked <b>buttocks</b> on Cleveland's naked buttocks; they also shortened this more detailed version and used the less-detailed current version.|$|E

30|$|<b>Buttock</b> abscess {{is a rare}} {{clinical}} manifestation from unusual extrapelvic {{extension of}} psoas abscess. A 48 -year-old woman presented with painful swelling of the <b>buttock</b> {{with a sense of}} local heat. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a large subfascial abscess over the glutei muscles and was traced into the intraabdominal cavity over the iliac wing to the psoas muscle. Both the psoas abscess and the <b>buttock</b> abscess were evacuated via separate approaches. Empirical antibiotic therapy was delivered for 3  weeks. After 6  months, no evidence of recurrence was found. Psoas abscess could be included in the differential diagnosis of <b>buttock</b> abscess.|$|R
5|$|A bikini {{is usually}} a women's {{abbreviated}} two-piece swimsuit with a bra top for the chest and underwear cut below the navel. The basic design is simple: two triangles of fabric on top cover the woman's breasts and two triangles of fabric on the bottom cover the groin in front and the <b>buttocks</b> in back. The size of a bikini bottom can range from full pelvic coverage to a revealing thong or G-string design.|$|E
5|$|Decapitation was the {{preferred}} method in German and western Slavic areas, {{with the head}} buried between the feet, behind the <b>buttocks</b> or away from the body.

40|$|This study {{looked at}} the {{contribution}} of breast size and <b>buttock</b> size on ratings of female physical attractiveness in profile. A total of 114 British undergraduates rated 9 silhouettes with 3 varying levels of breast size and 3 levels of <b>buttock</b> size. Results showed significant main effects of breast size (with an overall preference for small breasts) but not of <b>buttock</b> size. Gender of the participants {{did not have a}} significant effect on the variables, although there was a significant interaction of breast and <b>buttock</b> size. The findings suggest that variables such as breast size are minor cues of female physical attractiveness...|$|R

50|$|In the 17th century, {{and perhaps}} earlier when {{the law that}} became known as <b>buttock</b> mail was passed, <b>buttock</b> was a colloquial term for a prostitute. The term mail is an old Scots word meaning a {{monetary}} tribute or payment, from the same root as the word blackmail. Thus, the term <b>buttock</b> mail literally means a monetary payment related to prostitution, referring to its being a fine for fornication, or sex outside of marriage.|$|R

5|$|Inverse {{psoriasis}} (also {{known as}} flexural psoriasis) appears as smooth, inflamed patches of skin. The patches frequently affect skin folds, particularly around the genitals (between the thigh and groin), the armpits, {{in the skin}} folds of an overweight abdomen (known as panniculus), between the <b>buttocks</b> in the intergluteal cleft, and under the breasts in the inframammary fold. Heat, trauma, and infection are thought {{to play a role}} in the development of this atypical form of psoriasis.|$|E

40|$|Wheelchair-users who cannot {{reposition}} themselves often {{suffer from}} pressure ulcers which are places of tissue {{breakdown in the}} <b>buttock</b> region under the sacrum and ischial tuberosities. Periodic pressure relief is needed to recover the <b>buttock</b> tissue from continuous deformation and impairment of tissue perfusion. Because pelvis alignment directly affects body posture and <b>buttock</b> load, a passive motion technique was developed that adjusts pelvis orientation independent from the trunk and seat support. This study investigates {{the effects of the}} so-called decoupled pelvis rotation (DPR) on the loads at the buttock–seat interface and evaluates whether this technique is applicable to regulate <b>buttock</b> load in sitting. Eighteen healthy male subjects participated in this study. Experiments were performed with a computer-aided adjustable simulator chair, instrumented with a concept of DPR. Measurements involved quasi-static actuated pelvis movements in the sagittal and frontal plane. Pelvis orientation, <b>buttock</b> interface pressures, seat reaction forces and centre of pressure were simultaneously measured. As a result of the induced passive pelvis movements, the pelvis rotated 19 ± 2 ° and 9 ± 2 ° in the sagittal and frontal plane, respectively. Significant relations were found between pelvis rotation and most quantities of <b>buttock</b> load. Findings suggest that DPR is an effective technique to regulate <b>buttock</b> load in able-bodied individuals. For clinical application, this technique is still to be evaluated on individuals who cannot functionally reposition themselves. Impairments to the neuromuscular function influence postural response from chair adjustments which makes clinical investigation necessary...|$|R

5|$|Book XI covers {{human beings}}, portents and transformations. Isidore derives human beings (homo) from the Latin for soil (humus), as in Genesis 2:7 {{it says that}} man is made from the soil. Urine (urina) gets its name either {{from the fact that}} it can burn (urere) the skin or, Isidore hedges, that it is from the kidneys (renes). Femina, meaning woman, comes from femora/femina meaning thighs, as this part of the body shows she is not a man. The Latin for <b>buttocks</b> is clunis as they are near the large {{intestine}} or colon (colum).|$|E
5|$|Hair {{length is}} most often {{measured}} (in centimeters or inches) from {{the line of the}} scalp on the forehead up over the highest point of the skull to its termination, and sometimes from the crown, the latter resulting in 10 centimeter lower values in average. In cosmetology, hair lengths are usually categorized according to the part of the body where the bulk of the longest hair terminates: chin level, shoulder length, lower shoulderblade/mid-back level, waist length, hip-length, classic length (extends to almost buttock-length, i.e. upper thigh-length, where the legs meet the <b>buttocks),</b> thigh-length, knee-length and ankle/floor length hair.|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} {{increased}} interest in <b>buttock</b> contouring and augmentation in recent years, which has translated into increased demand for these procedures. In addition, we are witnessing {{a growing number of}} patients from all ethnic groups requesting cosmetic surgery in the United States. <b>Buttock</b> aesthetic surgery today consists of either augmentation or recontouring of the gluteal region by one of three methods: (1) liposuction (if only reductive shaping is required); (2) liposuction and augmentation by micro fat grafting; and (3) gluteal implants. Whereas there certainly exists a “universal ideal” of beauty in <b>buttock</b> augmentation, there are fundamental ethnic differences that must be recognized to achieve a desirable surgical outcome. We present an article reviewing current trends in <b>buttock</b> aesthetic procedures and discuss issues relevant to the ethnic populations...|$|R
40|$|A 71 -year-old male patient {{presented}} with chronic, disabling <b>buttock</b> pain and right leg radiating pain for 7 years. He described a toothache-like pain in right <b>buttock</b> that occasionally radiated distally in right leg and foot, and diffuse hypesthesia and pares-thesia along distal leg and foot. Sitting, particularly on a firm, hard chair, {{or on the}} common mode, and walking aggravated his symptoms. Straining during urination or defecation evoked shock-like pain in the right distal leg and foot. He also had an intermit-tent cramping, squeezing dysesthetic pain in his distal leg and foot. He had no back pain. On physical examination, two dimple-like, old operation scars were observed in the right <b>buttock</b> (Fig. 1 A). A moderate atro-phy of right gluteal and harmstring muscles was observed and the circumferential diameter of right thigh decreased compared to the left side. Deep compression in his right lower <b>buttock</b> prom-ptly elicited a cramping pain in the right <b>buttock</b> which radiated in the distal leg and, more excruciating pain, in dorsum and sole of the foot.

40|$|Objective To {{assess the}} effects of {{backrest}} inclination of a wheelchair on <b>buttock</b> pressures in spinal cord injured (SCI) patients and normal subjects. Method The participants were 22 healthy subjects and 22 SCI patients. <b>Buttock</b> pressures {{of the participants were}} measured by a Tekscan ® pressure sensing mat and software while they were sitting in a reclining wheelchair. <b>Buttock</b> pressures were recorded for 90 °, 100 °, 110 °, 120 ° and 130 ° seat-to-back angles at the ischial tuberosity (IT) and sacrococcygeal (SC) areas. Recordings were made at each angle over four seconds at a sampling rate of 10 Hz. Results The side-to-side <b>buttock</b> pressure differences in the IT area for the SCI patients was significantly greater than for the normal subjects. There {{was no significant difference between}} the SCI patients and the normal subjects in the <b>buttock</b> pressure change pattern of the IT area. Significant increases in pressure on the SC area were found as backrest inclination angle was changed to 90 o, 100 o and 110 ° in the normal subjects, but no significant differences were found in the SCI patients. Conclusion Most of the SCI patients have freeform posture in wheelchairs, and this leads to an uneven distribution of <b>buttock</b> pressure. In the SCI patients, the peak pressure in the IT area reduced as the backrest angle was increased, but peak pressure at the SC area remained relatively unchanged. To reduce <b>buttock</b> pressure and prevent pressure ulcers and enhance ulcer healing, it can be helpful for tetraplegic patients, to have wheelchai...|$|R
5|$|Ono {{was also}} an {{experimental}} filmmaker who made 16 short films between 1964 and 1972, gaining particular renown for a 1966 Fluxus film called simply No. 4, {{often referred to as}} Bottoms. The five-and-a-half-minute film consists of a series of close-ups of human <b>buttocks</b> walking on a treadmill. The screen is divided into four almost equal sections by the elements of the gluteal cleft and the horizontal gluteal crease. The soundtrack consists of interviews with those who are being filmed, as well as those considering joining the project. In 1996, the watch manufacturing company Swatch produced a limited edition watch that commemorated this film.|$|E
5|$|Though Shiva {{is often}} {{described}} as a naked ascetic Yogi, iconographically he is rarely portrayed as nude except in his form as Bhikshatana. Often the seductive nature of the naked Bhikshatana is emphasised in his torso and <b>buttocks.</b> Though his manhood is fully visible, Bhikshatana is never displayed as ithyphallic in South Indian iconography. In contrast to textual descriptions, Orissan images of Bhikshatana depict him clothed with tiger skin and other body ornaments, but displaying an erect phallus. He is two-armed, holding the begging bowl kapala in his left hand and the trishula (trident) in his right hand.|$|E

30|$|A 2 -year-old girl {{presented}} with rash on <b>buttock</b> and extremities for 4  days. Firstly the rash began as multiple vesicles on <b>buttock</b> and extremities and then changed into erythematous papules and crust on top. She {{has been in}} contact with two friends who had the same rash at school. She was diagnosed as chickenpox infection from a doctor. Physical examination demonstrated dry erythematous papules on arms, legs and <b>buttock</b> with some desquamation on <b>buttock.</b> Few red macules were present on soles. No buccal and trunk lesions were detected (Figure  3 b). The cutaneous lesions in this case were presented as Gianotti–Crosti syndrome (GCS)-like because GCS is characterized by monomorphous lichenoid papules and/or papulovesicles, symmetrically distributed on the face, arms and legs with relative sparing of the trunk. However, the lesions in this case disappeared in a week.|$|R
5|$|According to {{the book}} Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho, the censors in charge of {{enforcing}} the Production Code wrangled with Hitchcock because some of them insisted they could see one of Leigh's breasts. Hitchcock held onto the print for several days, left it untouched, and resubmitted it for approval. Each of the censors reversed their positions: those who had previously seen the breast now did not, {{and those who had}} not, now did. They passed the film after the director removed one shot that showed the <b>buttocks</b> of Leigh's stand-in. The board was also upset by the racy opening, so Hitchcock said that if they let him keep the shower scene he would re-shoot the opening with them on the set. Since they did not show up for the re-shoot, the opening stayed.|$|E

5|$|Electrical {{stimulation}} of the dorsal columns of the spinal cord can produce analgesia. First, the leads are implanted, guided by fluoroscopy and feedback from the patient, and the generator is worn externally for several days to assess efficacy.

A small pocket is cut into the tissue beneath {{the skin of the}} upper <b>buttocks,</b> chest wall or abdomen and the leads are threaded under the skin from the stimulation site to the pocket, where they are attached to the snugly fitting generator. It seems to be more helpful with neuropathic and ischemic pain than nociceptive pain, but current evidence is too weak to recommend its use in the treatment of cancer pain.|$|E
