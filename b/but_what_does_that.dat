500|$|Stevens is {{a proponent}} of using {{statistical}} analysis to enhance his coaching decisions, spending almost as much time looking at statistics as watching game film. [...] "I think it's a unique {{way of looking at}} the game that may be able to help best communicate to your players", he explains. For example, when Butler was slumping in late 2010, Stevens challenged his team: [...] "this [...] is where we are. This isn't acceptable to get to where we want to go. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> really mean? It's not just get better defensively, it is, if we give up 3 less baskets a game, then we will be at 40 percent field goal percentage defense which will be top 20 in the country". The team got the message, improved throughout the season, and ultimately went on a March run fueled by defense. In 2012, Stevens became the first college coach to hire someone solely for statistical research when he added Drew Cannon to the staff. If he had the resources, Stevens says he would hire a team of statisticians to analyze the teams play.|$|E

6000|$|... "Let {{him look}} out," [...] said Father Brown. [...] "The sun was the cruellest {{of all the}} gods. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> monstrous eye mean?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, Dick," [...] {{answered}} Hugh sadly, [...] "doubtless we {{can make}} a fight for it and take some with us to a quieter world, if they are foolish enough to give us a chance. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> fellow shout as to starving us out? How stand we for provisions?" ...|$|R
60|$|He came to {{a sudden}} resolution. He would {{postpone}} the parting. He would ask them to dinner. Over the best that the Savoy Hotel could provide they would fight the afternoon's battle over again. He did not {{know who they were}} or anything about them, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> matter? They were brother-fans. That was enough for him.|$|R
6000|$|There was {{no doubt}} about that. Blackie's right eye was blinder than any bat's; it was an opaque white ball--a {{circumstance}} which caused it no little annoyance, for the other eye had to do duty for both, and this involved constant screwing of the head about, and unwearied watchfulness. It {{was as if a}} solitary sentinel were placed to guard the front and back doors of a house at one and the same time. Despite Blackie's utmost care, Jacky got on her blind side more than once, and caught her by the remnant of her poor tail. This used to spoil Tilly's morning amusement, and send her sorrowful into the house. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> matter to Jacky? He sometimes broke out worse than usual, and set the whole brood into an agitated flutter, which rather damaged the happiness of the family. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> matter to Jacky? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I was armed, and he couldn't. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> matter? What {{does matter}} is this;--that they who {{were with him}} were {{thoroughly}} bad fellows. Was he at home last night?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{my folks}} were Orange, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> matter now?" [...] said he. [...] "There'll {{be one of}} us in--to-morrow, but for the shame ye put on Larry ye'll carry my mark there with ye." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have heard," [...] replied Hilda, [...] "that he {{is fond of}} war, which, truly, is no news, {{and that}} he is just now more busy with his bloody game than usual; <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> matter to thee?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Miss Mohun {{was not at}} all uneasy as to {{the young}} lord. An Eton boy's admiration of a pretty face did not amount to much, even if Ivinghoe had not {{understood}} 'Noblesse oblige' too well to leave a young girl unsheltered. Besides, he and all the rest were going away the next day. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> final hint mean? ...|$|R
60|$|So Aina and Lisa {{went off}} to the wood. Ah! how {{delightful}} it was there, how beautiful! It was certainly tiresome sometimes climbing over the fallen trees, and getting caught in the branches, and waging war with the juniper bushes and the midges, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> matter? The girls climbed well in their short dresses, and soon they were deep in the wood.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{the biggest}} rough-house I ever saw," [...] Billy confided to Saxon. [...] "It sure takes the Micks to mix it. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> dude wanta <b>do</b> it for? <b>That's</b> <b>what</b> gets me. He wasn't a bricklayer--not even a workingman--just a regular sissy dude that didn't know a livin' soul in the grounds. But {{if he wanted}} to raise a rough-house he {{certainly}} done it. Look at 'em. They're fightin' everywhere." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How?" [...] he asked. [...] "By death," [...] I answered, [...] "of which {{a hundred}} means lie to my hand. You have robbed me of one, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> matter {{when so many}} remain? I will go where you and your love cannot pursue me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I have, it is true, been up {{a little}} late this last week,' he said cheerfully. 'In fact, I couldn't tear myself away from the equatorial; {{it is such a}} {{wonderful}} possession that it keeps me there till daylight. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> matter, now I have made the discovery?' ...|$|E
6000|$|After {{showing that}} the Kasai Company, in their haste for wealth (and, perhaps, in their foresight, as knowing that their {{occupancy}} may be brought to an end), are cutting down the rubber vines instead of tapping them (illegal, of course, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> matter where Belgian Concessionnaires are in question), goes on to show {{the pressure on the}} people: ...|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> signify when Colonel Carey was coming? and a {{sovereign}} {{would buy a}} pig three times over--at least, if {{it was quite a}} little one. Christabel wished the hope of that sovereign had never occurred to him, for he seemed to think it quite set him free from the little self-restraints by which the others were earning the pleasure of making the gift; and though he still talked the most about the pig, he denied himself the least for it.|$|R
60|$|It was {{not hard}} work. He flopped {{like a chicken}} during the six or seven blows that it took to sever his head; but finally he lay still, and I tied his head in my handkerchief. The eyes opened and shut thrice while I walked a hundred yards. I was red to my feet with the drip, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> matter? With delight I felt under my hands the crisp touch of his short, thick, brown hair and close-trimmed beard.|$|R
60|$|Henchard {{dropped the}} glass, {{and for some}} seconds made no other movement. Newson waited, and Henchard waited--if that could be called a waiting which was a transfixture. But Elizabeth-Jane did not come. Something or other had caused her to neglect her {{customary}} walk that day. Perhaps Farfrae and she had chosen another road for variety's sake. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> amount to? She might be here to-morrow, {{and in any case}} Newson, if bent on a private meeting and a revelation of the truth to her, would soon make his opportunity.|$|R
6000|$|... "In a few days, I hope. Yes, you are right, my dear; {{the coat}} {{is a pretty}} one, {{and he is a}} pretty lad that shall wear it--not very {{handsome}} in the face, to be sure; <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> matter so long as he's stout and strong and kind? I am sure his elder brother, Addedomar, will be kind to you though he is a bit rough to me sometimes." ...|$|E
6000|$|Secondly, what of No. 6? Here we are {{a little}} better off. We {{know that there is}} SOMETHING in it, for there is a red counter in its outer portion. It is true we do not know whether its inner portion is empty or occupied: <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>THAT</b> matter? One solitary Cake, {{in one corner of the}} Square, is quite {{sufficient}} excuse for saying [...] "THIS SQUARE IS OCCUPIED", and for marking it with a red counter.|$|E
6000|$|... "I dare say, Macumazahn; <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> {{matter if}} only I and the royal {{regiment}} {{can make an}} end that shall be spoken of? Oh, cheer up, cheer up, Macumazahn; your Spirit, too, looks towards you, as I promise that we all will do when the shields meet; for know, Macumazahn, that we poor black soldiers expect that you will {{show us how to}} fight this day, and, if need be, how to fall hidden in a heap of the foe." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> matter? Her {{not seeing}} him again ought to make, should make, no {{difference}} with her. It {{was not that}} she might see him, but that she might think of him with unsullied thoughts. That should be her object,--that and the duty that she owed to Mrs Baggett. Why was not Mrs Baggett entitled to as much consideration as was she herself,--or even he? She turned to the glass, and wiped her eyes with the sponge, and brushed her hair, and then she went across the passage to Mr Whittlestaff's library.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, {{that she}} can't bear {{the sight of}} her." [...] His pronouns {{required}} some arranging, but after I had successfully dealt with them I replied that I knew perfectly Miss Saunt had a trick of turning {{her back on the}} good lady of Folkestone. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> prove? [...] "Have you never guessed? I guessed as soon as she spoke!" [...] Dawling towered over me in dismal triumph. It {{was the first time in}} our acquaintance that, intellectually speaking, this had occurred; but even so remarkable an incident still left me sufficiently at sea to cause him to continue: [...] "Why, the effect of those spectacles!" ...|$|R
60|$|He was {{handsome}} in her eyes, though perhaps, delicate reader, {{he would not}} have been handsome in yours. She knew that he was not a gentleman; <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> matter? Neither was her sister-in-law Sarah a lady. There was not much in that house in Gower Street that was after the manner of gentlemen and ladies. She was ready to throw all that to the dogs, and would have done so but for Mr Maguire. She felt that she would like to have allowed herself to love him in spite of the tearing of the verses. She felt this, and was very angry with Mr Maguire. But the facts were stern, and there was no hope for her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then you are {{a little}} wiser than I am, for I always give my friend {{satisfaction}} first, and explanation afterwards. If one of us falls, all accounts are settled; if not, men are never so ready for peace as after war. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> bawling brat of a boy want?" [...] said Bucklaw. [...] "I wish to Heaven he had come a few minutes sooner! and yet {{it must have been}} ended some time, and perhaps this way is as well as any other." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Counting by {{days and}} hours, some fortnight. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> signify? You do not love a man the better always, {{the longer you}} know him. Of you, I discern that there is that in you I can love, {{that would make me}} happy. I have talent, some sort of talent at least. You have a spirit which would force me to use it. I will not pretend to say that I am suited for you. You must judge that. But I know that you are suited for me. Now I will take any answer you will give me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I met Shortis {{the other}} night in the street," [...] went on Mr. Bughouse, [...] "and he said, 'Come on {{up to my room}} in the hotel.' 'Oh,' I said, 'I can't very well.' 'Nonsense,' he said, 'You're on the other side <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> matter?' Well, we went up to his room, and there he had whiskey, and gin, and lager,--everything. 'Now,' he says, 'name your drink--what is it?' There he was, right in his room, {{breaking}} the law without caring a darn about it. Well, you know the voters like that kind of thing. It appeals to them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, burglar's tools. That {{appears to}} relieve {{you a good}} deal. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> give you <b>that</b> turn? What were YOU expecting we'd found?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Cain. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> all <b>that</b> signify to me, while God {{appears to}} favour and caress my younger Brother, and to shine upon him, while a black Dejection and token of Displeasure {{surrounds}} me every Day, {{and he does}} not appear to me as he used to do? ...|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> {{happen is}} <b>that</b> the Mariposa Belle sinks {{every now and}} then, and sticks there on the bottom till they get things {{straightened}} up.|$|R
6000|$|But {{some may}} answer, holy scripture {{speaks of the}} gospel of salvation. True, it does, once or twice. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> show? Is that a {{different}} gospel from the gospel {{of the kingdom of}} God? Are there two gospels? Surely not. Else why would holy scripture speak so often of [...] "the gospel"--"the good news," [...] by itself, without any word after to show what it was about? It says often simply [...] "the gospel;" [...] because there is but one gospel; and, as St. Paul says, if any man or angel preach any other than that one, [...] "Let him be anathema." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know. How {{could it}} have been otherwise? And yet.... <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> matter? I stood there before him, near enough to be touched and surely not looking like an impostor. All I know is, that he put out both his hands then to me, I may say flung them out at me, with the {{greatest}} readiness and warmth, and that I seized and pressed them, feeling that I was finding again a little of what I thought was lost to me for ever, with the loss of my brother--some of that hope, inspiration, and support which I used to get from my dear dead...." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are you mad?" [...] she {{answered}} almost fiercely through her veil. [...] "Do {{you think that}} it can be any pleasure for me to seem to make love to a stone shaped like a man, for whom I care nothing at all--except as a friend?" [...] she added quickly. [...] "I tell you, Señor Peter, that if you do not do as I tell you, you will never hear what I have to say, for I shall be held to have failed in my business, and within a few minutes shall vanish from you for ever--to my death perhaps; <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> matter to you? Choose now, and quickly, for I cannot stand thus for long." ...|$|E
40|$|The {{number of}} {{children}} diagnosed as ‘NLD’ increases rapidly. NLD stands for Nonverbal Learning Disability, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> exactly <b>does</b> <b>that</b> mean? The interest in educational circles contrasts sharply with that of scientific world. Is this a hype? Is it indeed acceptable to label a child as NLD? There are many arguments not to do so...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, might <b>but</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> often does--by all our blessed little {{laws and}} {{arrangements}} at least; excite Kate's own sentiment instead of depressing it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Everything! He is Sir John Ferringhall--very stupid, very respectable, very egotistical. <b>But,</b> after all, <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> matter? He is {{very much}} taken with me. He tries hard to conceal it, but he cannot." ...|$|R
