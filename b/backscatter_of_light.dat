This system measures <b>backscatter</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> at 355 nm and 532 nm {{and is able to}} detect even extremely thin layers of particles in the atmosphere. Cloud base and top height, depolarisation optical depth and color index can be deduced from this data. During the Polarstern cruises very thin layers of ice particles have been observed frequently in the tropical tropopause layer (TTL). Cases of persistent cloud layers with an optical depth below 10 ^- 3 are reported. Based on the data of radiosondes which were launched daily aboard the vessel, the conditions at which these type of clouds form are analysed. It is shown, that these clouds form in a layer below the cold point, but above the lapse rate tropopause. The relation between cloud occurrence and temperature and wind in the TTL as well as state of the QBO are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} myofibroblast differentiation as an {{etiology of}} haze at the graft-host interface in a cat model of Descemet’s Stripping Automated Endothelial Keratoplasty (DSAEK). Methods: DSAEK {{was performed on}} 10 eyes of 5 adult domestic short-hair cats. In vivo corneal imaging with slit lamp, confocal, and optical coherence tomography (OCT) were performed twice weekly. Cats were sacrificed and corneas harvested 4 hours, and 2, 4, 6, and 9 days post-DSAEK. Corneal sections were stained with the TUNEL method and immunohistochemistry was performed for a-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA) and fibronectin with DAPI counterstain. Results: At all in vivo imaging time-points, corneal OCT revealed an increase in <b>backscatter</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> and confocal imaging revealed an acellular zone at the graft-host interface. At all post-mortem time-points, immunohistochemistry revealed a complete absence of a-SMA staining at the graft-host interface. At 4 hours, extracellular fibronectin staining was identified along the graft-host interface and both fibronectin and TUNEL assay were positive within adjacent cells extending into the host stroma. By day 2, fibronectin and TUNEL staining diminished and a distinct acellular zone was present {{in the region of}} previously TUNEL-positive cells. Conclusions: OCT imaging consistently showed increased reflectivity at the graft-host interface in cat corneas in the days post-DSAEK.

40|$|The {{nature of}} the unusually narrow {{photometric}} and polarization opposition effects exhibited by Saturn's A and B rings is examined using a theory and results of laboratory measurements. It is {{pointed out that the}} small angular width of both phenomena makes it difficult to explain them {{on the basis of the}} commonly used shadowing models. On the other hand, it is known from laboratory experiments and theoretical studies, that a strong and very narrow opposition peak in the reflected intensity can be produced by coherent <b>backscattering</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> from powderlike layers of small regolithic grains. Using Ozrin's (1992) rigorous vector theory <b>of</b> coherent <b>backscattering,</b> it is shown that, for subwavelength-sized regolithic particles, the photometric opposition effect is accompanied by a polarization opposition effect of the same angular width. This suggests that the polarization opposition effect of the Saturn's ring has the same origin as the photometric opposition effect and is due to coherent <b>backscattering</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> from the regolithic layer composed of the submicrometer-sized ice grains...|$|R

40|$|As a {{spectacular}} manifestation of self-interference effects in elastic <b>light</b> scattering, enhanced <b>backscattering</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> (EBS, {{also known as}} coherent <b>backscattering</b> <b>of</b> <b>light)</b> has been intensively investigated for characterization of strongly scattering medium. By using low spatial coherence illumination, EBS has further shown its potential for biological tissue characterization and cancer diagnosis. First, using low-coherence enhanced backscattering (hereafter referred to as LEBS), {{the development of an}} optical imaging platform is presented. LEBS imaging platform takes the advantage of self-generated multiple independent coherence areas, which can be used as spatial filters as similarly as mechanical pinhole scanning. Thus, this imaging platform substantially minimizes cross-talk among adjacent pixels, rejects the background light caused by out-of-plane scattered light, and allows optical-sectioning to the subsurface in a relatively large area. These interesting capabilities of the LEBS imaging platform are validated by tissue phantom experiments. Second, the presented work further describes a detailed analysis of LEBS for better understanding possible mechanisms by which LEBS probes subtle variations in radial intensity distribution in weakly scattering medium such as biological tissue. The result from a pilot study using an animal model of chemical skin carcinogenesis shows that the enhancement factor of LEBS can be strongly altered even at a stage of preneoplasia, preceding the classical biomarker of non-melanoma skin cancer. ...|$|R
