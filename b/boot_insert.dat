40|$|Background: Stress {{reaction}} in bone, which may proceed to a fracture, {{is a significant}} problem in military recruits and in athletes, particularly long distance runners. Objectives: To evaluate the evidence from randomised controlled trials of interventions for prevention or management of lower-limb stress fractures and stress reactions of bone in active young adults. Search strategy: We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (April 2004), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2004), MEDLINE (1966 to September week 1, 2004), EMBASE, CINAHL, Index to UK Theses, reference lists of relevant articles and contacted trialists. Selection criteria: Any randomised or quasi-randomised trials evaluating interventions for preventing or treating lower limb stress reactions of bone or stress fractures in active young adults. Data collection and analysis: We independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed trial quality and extracted data. Only limited data pooling was undertaken. Main results: We included 16 trials. All 13 prevention trials involved military recruits undergoing training. Participants {{of two of the}} three treatment trials were military personnel. Ten prevention trials tested the effects of various foot inserts and other footwear modifications. While pooling of data was not possible, the four trials evaluating the use of “shock-absorbing” <b>boot</b> <b>inserts</b> versus control found fewer stress injuries of the bone in their intervention groups. However, the only trial showing a significant benefit lacked important information about trial design. A key issue in several trials was the acceptability, in terms of practicality and comfort, of the <b>boot</b> <b>inserts.</b> Two cluster-randomised prevention trials found no significant effect of leg muscle stretching during warm up before exercise. Pooled data from three small but very different trials testing the use of pneumatic braces in the rehabilitation of tibial stress fractures showed a significant reduction in the time to recommencing full activity (weighted mean difference - 33. 39 days, 95...|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: A typical late-model cable binding. The <b>boot</b> is <b>inserted</b> {{into the}} metal plate, and held {{down by a}} leather strap (missing). The cable is then lifted over the heel of the boot, and pulled forward by the lever {{at the top of}} the image. The spring keeps {{constant}} tension as the boot moves up and down through the striding motion.|$|R
50|$|For the UK the pre {{facelift}} range included TS, Monaco (being {{a special}} edition with metallic brown paint, Monaco badging on <b>boot</b> and C-Pillar <b>insert</b> panels, Leather interior and some other changes from the TS spec), GTX, V6 & V6 Turbo.|$|R
5000|$|The system {{operated}} PC DOS 2.11 {{as well as}} Microsoft Disk BASIC and Microsoft Advanced BASIC. Like the PC, if {{the system}} was left to <b>boot</b> without <b>inserting</b> a diskette {{into one of the}} drives the Microsoft Cassette BASIC interpreter would be loaded, which was compatible with IBM PCjr BASIC, including Cartridge BASIC. PC DOS 2.11 could only use half of the tracks of a 3.5" [...] drive, however, since it didn't really understand what a 3.5" [...] drive even was. The PCjx's BIOS could only address the first 40 tracks, like a 5.25" [...] drive.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} {{descriptions}} note multipartite function in Ontario.2048. This is incorrect. Ontario.2048 does contain a boot sector within {{it with a}} <b>boot</b> virus. If <b>inserted</b> into the <b>boot</b> sector, {{it would be a}} functioning boot virus (although it would not spread the file infection portion of Ontario.2048). However, Ontario.2048 never performs the injection; the code is functionally useless. Based on the virus author's documentation for the virus http://www.textfiles.com/virus/DOCUMENTATION/ontario3.txt, this appears to be intentional (reasons unknown).|$|R
50|$|The {{user can}} control the boot process, to cause one medium to be booted instead of another when two or more {{bootable}} media are present, {{by taking advantage of}} the boot priority implemented by the BIOS. For example, most computers have a hard disk that is bootable, but usually there is a removable-media drive that has higher boot priority, so the user can cause a removable disk to be <b>booted,</b> simply by <b>inserting</b> it, without removing the hard disk drive or altering its contents to make it unbootable.|$|R
60|$|The {{light of}} the cheerful fire shone on the rug and carpet of a cosey parlor, and glittered {{on the sides of}} the tea-cups and well-brightened tea-pot, as Senator Bird was drawing off his <b>boots,</b> preparatory to <b>inserting</b> his feet in a pair of new {{handsome}} slippers, which his wife had been working for him while away on his senatorial tour. Mrs. Bird, looking the very picture of delight, was superintending the arrangements of the table, ever and anon mingling admonitory remarks to a number of frolicsome juveniles, who were effervescing in all those modes of untold gambol and mischief that have astonished mothers ever since the flood.|$|R
50|$|Also, if an {{expansion}} ROM wishes {{to change the}} way the system boots unilaterally, it can simply hook INT 19h or other interrupts normally called from interrupt 19h, such as INT 13h, the BIOS disk service, to intercept the BIOS boot process. Then it can replace the BIOS boot process with one of its own, or it can merely modify the <b>boot</b> sequence by <b>inserting</b> its own <b>boot</b> actions into it, by preventing the BIOS from detecting certain devices as bootable, or both. Before the BIOS Boot Specification was promulgated, this was the only way for expansion ROMs to implement boot capability for devices not supported for booting by the native BIOS of the motherboard.|$|R
5000|$|The {{introduction}} of plastic boots in the 1960s led {{a number of}} companies to introduce [...] "hybrid" [...] <b>boots</b> with plastic <b>inserts</b> for additional lateral strength. These were widespread in the late 1960s, especially from the large collection of Italian bookmakers in Montebelluna, before they started introducing all-plastic designs of their own. Typical designs used a plastic insert wrapping around the heel area and extending up to just below the ankle, allowing the skier to force their foot sideways and offering some edging control. Others, notably 1968's Raichle Fibre Jet, wrapped a soft leather boot in an external fibreglass shell, producing a side-entry design that was not particularly successful. Hybrid designs often incorporated elements of the side-entry or three-piece designs. The Fibre Jet shared much in common with the Rosemount design, for instance.|$|R
40|$|This {{investigation}} explored how shock-pad {{density and}} footwear cushioning influences soccer players' biomechanics. Ten participants (20. 9 ? 2. 5 yrs, 83. 2 ? 7. 1 kg, UK footwear size 10 - 11) wore three footwear cushioning conditions (soccer boot, soccer boot with cushioning insole and soccer <b>boot</b> with heel <b>insert).</b> Each footwear condition was tested on two shock-pad densities (55 g/litre and 65 g/litre) beneath a third generation carpet. For each footwear-shock-pad combination, eight running trials (3. 81 m/s) and eight turning trials (consistent self-selected speeds) were collected. Pressure insole {{data were collected}} to provide a measure of player loading at impact and propulsion. Repeated measures ANOVAs demonstrated no main effects of footwear. The greater surface density did however, significantly increase (p < 0. 05) measurements associated with loading during running (first metatarsal peak pressure) and turning (peak impact force, lateral heel and first metatarsal peak pressure). These findings suggest that shock-pad density {{is important in the}} regulation of player loading. authorsversionPeer reviewe...|$|R
