5|$|Adopted {{from the}} Grand Theft Auto series, Red Dead Redemption has a {{modified}} wanted system. When the player commits a crime such as killing people near witnesses, some will {{run to the}} nearest police station. The player can bribe them or kill them {{before they reach the}} station. If a crime is committed near a police officer, the wanted meter immediately appears along with a <b>bounty</b> count which increases with each crime committed. If Marston's <b>bounty</b> becomes high enough he will be pursued by either the U.S. Marshals or by the Mexican Army depending on his locations. To evade law enforcement in pursuit, John Marston must escape a circular zone until the wanted meter disappears. Alternatively, the player character can kill all lawmen in a town to have the wanted meter disappear. Despite the chase being aborted, a <b>bounty</b> is placed upon John which will cause <b>bounty</b> hunters to come after him in the wilderness. It is impossible to surrender to these <b>bounty</b> hunters by putting away Marston's weapon and standing still as they will kill him regardless. Only law enforcement in towns and a posse will accept surrenders. The law will continue to chase Marston unless he pays his <b>bounty</b> at a telegraph station or presents a pardon letter. When arrested, Marston pays off his <b>bounty</b> and is then released. If the player does not have enough money to pay back the <b>bounty,</b> the law will assign <b>bounty</b> hunting activities.|$|E
5|$|At {{a remote}} {{industrial}} site, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny), Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), and Jeremiah Smith (Roy Thinnes) are approached by the Alien <b>Bounty</b> Hunter (Brian Thompson). Mulder and Smith flee with both Scully and the <b>Bounty</b> Hunter in pursuit, eventually reaching a waterfront. Mulder sneaks {{up on the}} <b>Bounty</b> Hunter and stabs him in the neck with the alien stiletto. Both he and Jeremiah escape on a boat, leaving Scully alone with the seemingly dead <b>Bounty</b> Hunter. When she approaches the body, the <b>Bounty</b> Hunter wakes up and chokes her, demanding to know where Mulder and Smith are heading. He releases her after realizing she has no such knowledge.|$|E
5|$|When {{investigating}} {{a case involving}} the murder of identical doctors, the agents come across a shapeshifting Alien <b>Bounty</b> Hunter (Brian Thompson) responsible for executing a series of alien clones. During this case a grown woman claiming to be Mulder's sister Samantha appears, telling Mulder of the <b>Bounty</b> Hunter's objectives and that she {{has the ability to}} identify him. When Scully is kidnapped by the <b>Bounty</b> Hunter, Mulder is forced to trade Samantha for her. During a botched attempt to kill the <b>Bounty</b> Hunter, Samantha is killed. However, it is discovered that this was simply one of many alien clones of Samantha. With the help of X, Mulder pursues the <b>Bounty</b> Hunter to a submarine in the Arctic. Mulder is nearly killed when exposed to the <b>Bounty</b> Hunter's toxic blood, but is saved by Scully.|$|E

5|$|<b>Bounty</b> Hunter: A new mode {{introduced}} in the game. If an online player creates too much chaos in the world, the mode will be initiated. Police, alongside one to three other players, will join the player's game {{with the hope of}} killing the hunted and claiming the <b>bounty,</b> which gives them experience points. The hunted could either strike back at the hunters by killing them, which gives them greater rewards, or escape from them until the <b>bounty</b> expires. The hunted, meanwhile, also can be assisted by another player if that player chooses to join the hunted. Players can manually place a <b>bounty</b> on themselves using the in-game smartphone.|$|E

50|$|Ironically, many early <b>bounties</b> {{were paid}} for the {{extermination}} of native species that were considered a pest to farmers. The Tasmanian tiger or thylacine was one such program that caused extinction, whilst the Tasmanian devil, spotted quoll, and Tasmanian wedge-tailed eagle all became seriously threatened by <b>bounties.</b>|$|R

The <b>Bounty</b> Hunter demands that Exley revert to his true form before he dies. Exley refuses and the <b>Bounty</b> Hunter then kills him. However, Exley miraculously bleeds red, human blood. Back in 1999, Mulder invites Scully to hit baseballs with him on an empty field.|$|E
5|$|The {{son of a}} {{prominent}} Isle of Man family with strong naval connections, Heywood joined <b>Bounty</b> under Lieutenant William Bligh {{at the age of}} 15 and, although unranked was given the privileges of a junior officer. <b>Bounty</b> left England in 1787 on a mission to collect and transport breadfruit from the Pacific, and arrived in Tahiti late in 1788. Relations between Bligh and certain of his officers, notably Fletcher Christian, became strained, and worsened during the five months that <b>Bounty</b> remained in Tahiti.|$|E

5|$|<b>Bounty</b> {{arrived at}} Tubuai on 28 May 1789. The {{reception}} from the native population was hostile; when a flotilla of war canoes {{headed for the}} ship, Christian used a four-pounder gun to repel the attackers. At least a dozen warriors were killed, and the rest scattered. Undeterred, Christian and an armed party surveyed the island, and {{decided it would be}} suitable for their purposes. However, to create a permanent settlement, they needed compliant native labour and women. The most likely source for these was Tahiti, to which <b>Bounty</b> returned on 6 June. To ensure the co-operation of the Tahiti chiefs, Christian concocted a story that he, Bligh, and Captain Cook were founding a new settlement at Aitutaki. Cook's name ensured generous gifts of livestock and other goods and, on 16 June, the well-provisioned <b>Bounty</b> sailed back to Tubuai. On board were nearly 30 Tahitian men and women, some of whom were there by deception.|$|E
5|$|Metroid Prime Hunters {{features}} a multiplayer mode that supports {{up to four}} players and includes voice chat capability.

5|$|Mulder has {{a fellow}} FBI agent, Barrett Weiss, visit Baker's residence. Weiss and Baker are both {{killed by the}} <b>Bounty</b> Hunter, who impersonates Weiss and tells Mulder and Scully {{that no one is}} home. After Walter Skinner hears of Weiss' death and closes the case, the agents meet CIA {{official}} Ambrose Chapel, who tells them that the doctors are clones from a Soviet genetics program, and are being systematically killed by the Russian and U.S. governments. Mulder, Scully and Chapel head to pick up another doctor named James Dickens, but Dickens flees at the sight of Chapel, who is really the disguised <b>Bounty</b> Hunter. Dickens is killed by the <b>Bounty</b> Hunter in the subsequent pursuit, unknowingly aided by Mulder and Scully.|$|E
5|$|The {{island was}} rediscovered and named Ducie Island on 16 March 1791 by Captain Edward Edwards, of , {{who had been}} {{despatched}} from Britain in 1790 to arrest the <b>Bounty</b> mutineers. Edwards named it in honour of Francis Reynolds-Moreton, 3rd Baron Ducie, under whom he had served earlier in his career. HMS Pandora turned northwards from Ducie and, because of this change of course, Edwards did not sight the other islands of the group. If HMS Pandora had maintained its course, it would eventually have reached Pitcairn Island and found the <b>Bounty</b> mutineers.|$|E
5|$|The {{sequence}} in which multiple Alien <b>Bounty</b> Hunters appear involved {{the use of}} motion control, a method in which a motion-control camera on a computerized module is repeatedly run through the same motion while elements are continually added. The shot, according to John Wash, {{was one of the}} few times in the series in which the production crew was able to use motion control and therefore presented a slight challenge. In the filming of the sequence, both a blank plate, for just the set, and lighting elements, that were in the set, were shot before the production crew filmed five different passes, each one with the Alien <b>Bounty</b> Hunter in a different position. The production crew were finally able to clone the <b>Bounty</b> Hunter by blending all the passes together.|$|E

5|$|Walter Skinner meets Mulder and Samantha at Mulder's apartment, {{telling them}} that the {{remaining}} clones are missing. Mulder receives a call from Scully, who tells him that the <b>Bounty</b> Hunter seeks an exchange for Samantha. Mulder and Samantha are sent to a bridge near Bethesda while Skinner hides nearby with a sharpshooter. After the exchange takes place, Samantha attacks the <b>Bounty</b> Hunter. During the struggle, the sharpshooter fires upon the <b>Bounty</b> Hunter, and both he and Samantha fall into a river. An anguished Mulder tearfully apologizes to his father, Bill, for losing her again. His father leaves him a note from Samantha, which provides Mulder with the address of a Maryland clinic where they can meet if separated. Mulder hopes that she is alive, but soon gets a call from Scully reporting that Samantha's body has been found. After Scully ends the call, she discovers Samantha's body dissolving into a green liquid.|$|E
5|$|After Skinner and Scully {{find and}} {{retrieve}} Praise, Skinner takes {{him to the}} nearest hospital, where his friend Thea visits him, {{closing the door behind}} her. In search for Mulder in the desert, Scully sees a bright light in the sky which she thinks is a spaceship, but which is later revealed to be a helicopter. The helicopter lands and Doggett insists Scully travel with him to the hospital; she reluctantly accepts. At the hospital, two other FBI agents assure the two agents that nothing has happened to Praise; however, they soon discover that he has vanished. Scully leaves to search for Praise, while Doggett stays in an attempt to catch the intruder. He checks the ceiling space, where he finds Skinner badly injured. Meanwhile, Scully finds Praise, along with Skinner, who claims to be protecting the boy. Skinner, who is actually the Alien <b>Bounty</b> Hunter, attempts to kill her but Scully grabs her gun and shoots him in the neck, killing the <b>Bounty</b> Hunter. After Doggett reports the case to Kersh, he is assigned to the X-File division with Scully. The episode ends showing Mulder still held in captivity as six Alien <b>Bounty</b> Hunters look on.|$|E
5|$|After the {{departure}} of Bligh's launch, Christian turned <b>Bounty</b> eastward {{in search of a}} remote haven on which he and the mutineers could settle. He had in mind the island of Tubuai, 300miles south of Tahiti, partly mapped by Cook. Christian intended to pick up women, male servants and livestock from Tahiti, to help establish the settlement. As <b>Bounty</b> sailed slowly towards Tubuai, Bligh's launch, overcoming many dangers and hardships, made its way steadily towards civilisation and reached Coupang (now Kupang), on Timor, on 14 June 1789. Here Bligh gave his first report of the mutiny, while awaiting a ship to take him back to England.|$|E
