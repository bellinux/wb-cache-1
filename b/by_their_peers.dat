Numerous studies provide compelling evidence that children and adolescents who are unable to sustain adequate peer relationships are at increased risk to experience adjustment difficulties both as children and adults. However, most studies have focused on children who are rejected <b>by</b> <b>their</b> <b>peer</b> group, and less attention has been given to adolescents in general and girls in particular. The {{purpose of the present study}} is to examine how peer group status and the presence (or absence) of supportive friendships in adolescence were differentially associated with emotional and physical well-being in girls and boys. Participants were 654 10 th- and 11 th-grade students who identified their best friends and completed measures of group popularity, friendship quality, depression, anxiety, and physical complaints. Teachers completed a widely used measure of emotional and behavioral adjustment. Analyses targeted four groups: those accepted <b>by</b> <b>their</b> <b>peer</b> group who had best friends, those accepted <b>by</b> <b>their</b> <b>peer</b> group who had no best friends, those rejected <b>by</b> <b>their</b> <b>peer</b> group who had best friends, and those rejected <b>by</b> <b>their</b> <b>peer</b> group who had no best friends. Popularity status and friendship quality were found to be important correlates of emotional and physical wellness in adolescence. The strength of this association differed for boys and girls. Popularity status was more closely associated with psychological wellness for boys. Friendship quality showed a stronger association with psychological wellness for girls. Frequency of negative interactions between friends bore a stronger relation to emotional and physical wellness than did frequency of positive interactions. When positive interactions were viewed in conjunction with negative interactions, adolescents with friendships high in both positive and negative interactions reported higher levels of emotional and physical symptomatology. Friendship status (i. e., presence or absence of a best friendship) was not found to relate to emotional or physical wellness. These findings underscore the importance of peer group status and friendship quality to psychological wellness in adolescence. They suggest that prevention and intervention programs promoting social and emotional wellness in adolescents should focus both on group success and the ability to develop and maintain supportive friendships...|$|R

40|$|This {{qualitative}} study examined preadolescent boys’ and girls’ body ideals, and peer and media factors that shape these ideals. Sixty-eight children aged 8 – 10 participated in semi-structured interviews: 19 boys and 17 girls in individual interviews and 16 boys and 16 girls in eight group interviews. Techniques from grounded theory {{were used to}} analyze the data. Findings demonstrated that fitness was an important element of boys’ and girls’ body ideals. For boys the emphasis was on sport, and this was promoted <b>by</b> <b>their</b> <b>peer</b> interactions and the sportsmen they admired. For girls the focus was on looking good, and this was reinforced <b>by</b> <b>their</b> <b>peer</b> conversations, and the actresses and singers they admired. Focus groups further highlighted how peers both reinforced media messages, yet also helped children critique media messages. Implications are discussed for prevention programs that need to be specifically tailored for boys and girls...|$|R

40|$|This paper studies gender {{differences}} in the extent to which social preferences affect workers' shirking decisions. Using exogenous variation in work absence induced by a randomized field experiment that increased treated workers' absence, we find that also non-treated workers increased their absence as a response. Furthermore, we find that male workers react more strongly to decreased monitoring, but no significant gender difference in the extent to which workers are influenced by peers. However, our results suggest significant heterogeneity in the degree of influence that male and female workers exert on each other: conditional on the potential exposure to same-sex co-workers, men are only affected <b>by</b> <b>their</b> male <b>peers,</b> and women are only affected <b>by</b> <b>their</b> female <b>peers...</b>|$|R

25|$|In the {{scenario}} favoured by David Erdal and Andrew Whiten, primate-style dominance provoked equal and opposite coalitionary resistance— counter-dominance.

Within increasingly stable coalitions, according to this perspective, status began to be earned in novel ways, social rewards accruing to those perceived <b>by</b> <b>their</b> <b>peers</b> as especially cooperative and self-aware.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{total of}} 1, 053 {{students}} participated in this study, which compared the social status of middle-school {{students with learning disabilities}} to a randomly chosen sample of students without disabilities. Information was gathered from a forced-choice Sociogram, a self-rating questionnaire, and a teacher rating scale. Descriptive statistics revealed that students with learning disabilities earned lower scores on the teacher rating scale and the self-rating questionnaire. Similarly, com-pared to <b>their</b> nondisabled <b>peers,</b> these students received more negative and fewer positive votes on the Sociogram. For all students, attractive and athletic votes were highly correlated with positive votes on the Sociogram. Recommendations are of-fered for future sociometric research. The social status of students with learning dis-abilities has been a topic of considerable interest to researchers for over a decade. Recent studies have consistently shown that students with learn-ing disabilities are less accepted <b>by</b> <b>their</b> <b>peer...</b>|$|R
