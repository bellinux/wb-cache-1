5|$|It is {{recommended}} that deep fryers be cleaned often to prevent contamination. The process of cooking with oil can also contaminate nearby surfaces as oil may splatter on adjacent areas. Oil vapors can also condense on more distant surfaces such as walls and ceilings. Supplies such as dish detergent and <b>baking</b> <b>soda</b> can effectively clean affected surfaces.|$|E
5|$|Gibbs used Swiss Pilatus P-2 army {{training}} planes {{standing in}} for Messerschmitt Bf-109s. He built a device {{based on an}} internal combustion engine to simulate gunfire, which was safer and less expensive than firing blanks. <b>Baking</b> <b>soda</b> was applied to Connery to create Henry's bullet wound. Vinegar was applied to create the foaming effect as {{the water from the}} Grail washes it away.|$|E
5|$|Sodium {{compounds}} are {{of immense}} commercial importance, being particularly central to industries producing glass, paper, soap, and textiles. The most important sodium compounds are table salt (NaCl), soda ash (Na2CO3), <b>baking</b> <b>soda</b> (NaHCO3), caustic soda (NaOH), sodium nitrate (NaNO3), di- and tri-sodium phosphates, sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3·5H2O), and borax (Na2B4O7·10H2O). In compounds, sodium is usually ionically bonded to water and anions, and {{is viewed as}} a hard Lewis acid.|$|E
5000|$|In Utah, {{the bread}} {{products}} locally called [...] "scones" [...] {{are similar to}} Native American frybread or New Orleans beignets and are made from a sweet yeast dough, with buttermilk and <b>baking</b> powder and/or <b>soda</b> added, and they are fried rather than baked. They are customarily served with butter and either honey or maple syrup.|$|R
50|$|As {{wheat flour}} and <b>baking</b> powder/baking <b>soda</b> became {{available}} in the late 19th century, buttermilk biscuits became popular. Cornbread {{was the most common}} bread in the mountains, yet still remains a staple. Salt, a necessity for life, was always available (much of it coming from Saltville, Virginia), and local seasonings like spicebush were certainly known and used; but the only other seasonings used in the mountains are black pepper and flaked red pepper, along with a little use of cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves around Christmas. Coffee, drunk without milk and only lightly sweetened, is a basic drink in Appalachia, often consumed with every meal; in wartime, chicory was widely used as a coffee substitute.|$|R
50|$|Shortcake is {{typically}} made with flour, sugar, <b>baking</b> powder or <b>soda,</b> salt, butter, milk or cream, and sometimes eggs. The dry ingredients are blended, {{and then the}} butter is cut in until the mixture resembles cornmeal. The liquid ingredients are then mixed in just until moistened, resulting in a shortened dough. The dough is then dropped in spoonfuls onto a baking sheet, rolled and cut like baking powder biscuits, or poured into a cake pan, depending on how wet the dough is and the baker's preferences. Then it is baked at a relatively high temperature until set.|$|R
5|$|Primary {{ingredients}} in an old-fashioned doughnut include flour, sugar, eggs, sour cream or buttermilk, and leavening agents such as baking powder or <b>baking</b> <b>soda.</b> Additional ingredients may include milk, butter, vanilla extract and salt. The use of buttermilk or sour cream may impart a rich flavor to the doughnut. It is typically deep-fried, {{and may be}} deep fried at a lower temperature compared to other doughnut styles, having a crunchier texture compared to other cake doughnut styles. Frying at a lower temperature contributes to its rough, cracked texture. Being turned several times while cooking in the oil also contributes to its texture.|$|E
5|$|Cooking oil is flammable, {{and fires}} {{may be caused}} by it igniting at too high a temperature. Further, {{attempts}} to extinguish an oil fire with water cause an extremely dangerous condition, a boilover, as they cause the water to flash into steam due to the high heat of the oil, in turn sending the burning oil in all directions and thus aggravating the fire. This {{is the leading cause of}} house fires in the United Kingdom. Instead, oil fires must be extinguished with a non-water fire extinguisher or by smothering. Other means of extinguishing an oil fire include application of dry powder (e.g., <b>baking</b> <b>soda,</b> salt) or fire fighting foam. Most commercial deep fryers are equipped with automatic fire suppression systems using foam.|$|E
5|$|The script {{called for}} the probe to {{vaporize}} the Earth's oceans, generating heavy cloud cover. While effects cinematographer Don Dow {{wanted to go to}} sea and record plumes of water created by exploding detonating cords in the water, the team decided to create the probe's climatic effect in another way after a government fishing agency voiced concerns for the welfare of marine life in the area. The team used a combination of <b>baking</b> <b>soda</b> and cloud tank effects; the swirling mist created by the water-filled tank was shot on black velvet, and color and dynamic swirls were added by injecting paint into the tank. These shots were composited onto a painting of the Earth along with overlaid lightning effects, created by double-exposing lights as they moved across the screen.|$|E
40|$|These {{studies on}} the use of lards in plain cake were {{initiated}} in the fall of 1932 and completed during the summer of 1936. The major results of these investigations with cake have been included in a series of four theses by Martin (11), Buel (2), Minard (13) and Myers (15). Cakes containing fat may be divided into two types: 1. The pound cake, named from the proportions formerly used by our great-grandmothers, consists of a pound each of fat, sugar, flour and eggs, with no <b>baking</b> powder or <b>soda.</b> The volume of the cake depends upon the expansion of moisture from the eggs and from the air incorporated-in the creamed mixture and in the beaten eggs. Although the old pound cake recipe is generally modified for modern formulas, it is essentially a type carrying a high percentage of fat, and the texture is rather close, fine, even and compact. 2. Far more commonly used at present by homemakers is a loaf, cup or layer cake, the volume of which depends upon air incorporated in beaten eggs, a leavening agent such as <b>baking</b> powder or <b>soda,</b> the expansion of the moisture into steam and, to a much lesser extent, upon the air incorporated in creaming. An analysis of recipes commonly used for this type of cake shows that they may be very lean, containing as little as 18 parts of fat per 100 parts of flour. A frequently used yet a fairly rich recipe may carry from 40 to 50 parts of fat, and a very rich one may carry 60 to 70 or occasionally 75 parts of fat per 100 parts of flour...|$|R
40|$|Red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) are a {{significant}} pest species threatening the survival of endangered and vulnerable native Australian fauna. Lethal baiting with the toxin 1080 is currently the most widely implemented form of control. However, non-target uptake is a problem, even in Western Australia where most native species have a high 1080 tolerance. It reduces the number of baits available to foxes and therefore the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of 1080 fox baiting operations. To investigate bait presentation {{and the use of}} aversive tastant agents as potential techniques to reduce non-target uptake of 1080 baits, two separate studies were conducted. Study 1 examined different non-toxic meat bait presentations to find the presentation that had the lowest non-target uptake. Baits were laid on the surface, suspended, buried or wrapped in kangaroo hide. Study 2 investigated the effectiveness of potential deterrents in causing aversion both immediately and accumulatively over time. Nine different deterrents (washing-up liquid, citric acid, wasabi, <b>baking</b> powder, bicarbonate <b>soda,</b> salt, sodium saccharin, Bitrex and chilli) were tested for immediate aversion and chilli and Bitrex were tested for accumulative aversion. A cafeteria-style presentation was used, with deterrents applied to apple baits of control, low and high concentrations. For Study 1 and 2 animal activity and bait take were monitored on remote-sensing Reconyx cameras for later photo analysis. The results of Study 1 suggested no significant effect of bait presentation. However, as hypothesised the longevity and non-target uptake was lowest for buried baits. Study 2 suggested that salt, wasabi and chilli created immediate aversion in the most abundant non-target species, quokkas. However, aversion was only carried-over onto untreated apple baits in wasabi and chilli. These findings suggest that bait presentation and the use of aversive tastant agents may have potential to decrease non-target uptake and be employed in future baiting 1080 fox baiting operations...|$|R
5|$|In humans, sodium is an {{essential}} mineral that regulates blood volume, blood pressure, osmotic equilibrium and pH; the minimum physiological requirement for sodium is 500 milligrams per day. Sodium chloride is the principal source of sodium in the diet, and is used as seasoning and preservative in such commodities as pickled preserves and jerky; for Americans, most sodium chloride comes from processed foods. Other sources of sodium are its natural occurrence in food and such food additives as monosodium glutamate (MSG), sodium nitrite, sodium saccharin, <b>baking</b> <b>soda</b> (sodium bicarbonate), and sodium benzoate. The US Institute of Medicine set its Tolerable Upper Intake Level for sodium at 2.3grams per day, but the average person in the United States consumes 3.4grams per day. Studies have found that lowering sodium intake by 2g per day tends to lower systolic blood pressure by about two to four mmHg. It {{has been estimated that}} such a decrease in sodium intake would lead to between 9 and 17% fewer cases of hypertension.|$|E
5|$|Six {{sets were}} {{constructed}} on which 60 pounds of <b>baking</b> <b>soda</b> {{were used as}} snow (the crew tried to use real snow but it melted), 42 pounds of glitter were used to cover the background, and 20 boxes of breakfast cereal were used to cover the coral rocks. Over 38 different types of foam were {{used to make the}} set pieces and the characters' bodies and heads. To render SpongeBob's pineapple house, palm fronds from a tree in a school yard were used. Other props and materials used were an actual starfish, three Christmas trees (for the Patchy the Pirate's Winter Wonderland scenes), six boxes of puff cereal (to create the fruitcake inside SpongeBob's mouth), 21 pounds of googly eyes (for rivets, texture pieces, knobs, etc.), 22 pounds of woodchips (to create Sandy's treedome floor), and 24 bunches of craft flowers (to create the parade float).|$|E
25|$|<b>Baking</b> <b>soda</b> is {{commonly}} added to washing machines {{as a replacement}} for water-softener and to remove odors from clothes.

25|$|Chametz {{does not}} include <b>baking</b> <b>soda,</b> baking powder or like products. Although these are defined in English as {{leavening}} agents, they leaven by chemical reaction, not by biological fermentation. Thus, bagels, waffles and pancakes made with <b>baking</b> <b>soda</b> and matzo meal are considered permissible, while bagels made with sourdough and pancakes and waffles made with yeast are prohibited.|$|E
25|$|Antacid (such as <b>baking</b> <b>soda)</b> {{solutions}} {{have been}} prepared and used by protesters to alleviate the effects of exposure to tear gas during protests.|$|E
25|$|In cooking, sodium bicarbonate, {{referred}} to as <b>baking</b> <b>soda,</b> is primarily used in baking as a leavening agent. It reacts with acidic components in batters, releasing carbon dioxide, which causes expansion of the batter and forms the characteristic texture and grain in pancakes, cakes, quick breads, soda bread, and other baked and fried foods. Acidic compounds that induce this reaction include phosphates, cream of tartar, lemon juice, yogurt, buttermilk, cocoa and vinegar. <b>Baking</b> <b>soda</b> may be used together with sourdough, which is acidic, making a lighter product with a less acid taste.|$|E
25|$|Examples {{of carbon}} {{sequestration}} at coal plants include converting carbon from smokestacks into <b>baking</b> <b>soda,</b> and algae-based carbon capture, circumventing storage by converting algae into fuel or feed.|$|E
25|$|Some {{alternative}} practitioners, such as Tullio Simoncini, have promoted <b>baking</b> <b>soda</b> as {{a cancer}} cure, which the American Cancer Society has warned against due to both its unproven effectiveness and potential danger in use.|$|E

25|$|It has weak {{disinfectant}} properties, {{and it may}} be {{an effective}} fungicide against some organisms. Because <b>baking</b> <b>soda</b> will absorb musty smells, it has become a reliable method for used-book sellers when making books less malodorous.|$|E
25|$|Sodium {{bicarbonate}} {{was sometimes}} used in cooking green vegetables, as {{it gives them}} a bright green colour—which has been described as artificial-looking—due to its reacting with chlorophyll to produce chlorophyllin. However, this tends to affect taste, texture and nutritional content, and is no longer common. <b>Baking</b> <b>soda</b> is still used, though, in the traditional British mushy peas recipe for soaking the peas. It is also used in Asian and Latin American cuisine to tenderize meats. <b>Baking</b> <b>soda</b> may react with acids in food, including vitamin C (L-ascorbic acid). It is also used in breading such as for fried foods to enhance crispness and allow passages for steam to escape, so the breading is not blown off during cooking.|$|E
25|$|A saltine or soda cracker is a thin, usually square cracker {{made from}} white flour, yeast, and <b>baking</b> <b>soda,</b> with most {{varieties}} lightly sprinkled with coarse salt. It has perforations over its surface, {{as well as}} a distinctively dry and crisp texture.|$|E
25|$|There are no {{permanent}} effects to people from this condition.

25|$|In 1791 French chemist Nicolas Leblanc {{produced}} sodium carbonate, {{also known}} as soda ash. In 1846 two New York bakers, John Dwight and Austin Church, established the first factory in the United States to produce <b>baking</b> <b>soda</b> from sodium carbonate and carbon dioxide.|$|E
25|$|Many {{forms of}} baking powder contain sodium {{bicarbonate}} combined with calcium acid phosphate, sodium aluminium phosphate or cream of tartar. <b>Baking</b> <b>soda</b> is alkaline; the acid used in baking powder avoids a metallic taste when the chemical change during baking creates sodium carbonate.|$|E
25|$|Making sodium bicarbonate: NaHCO3 {{is used in}} <b>baking</b> <b>soda</b> and in fire extinguishers. Although NaHCO3 {{is itself}} an {{intermediate}} product of the Solvay process, the heating needed to remove the ammonia that contaminates it decomposes some NaHCO3, making it more economic to react finished Na2CO3 with CO2.|$|E
25|$|A paste {{made from}} <b>baking</b> <b>soda</b> with minimal water is {{recommended}} by a manufacturer as a gentle scouring powder, and {{is useful in}} removing surface rust, as the rust forms a water-soluble compound when in a concentrated alkaline solution; cold water should be used, as hot water solutions can corrode steel.|$|E
25|$|Hydrogen {{peroxide}} is {{also used}} for tooth whitening. It {{can be found in}} most whitening toothpastes. Hydrogen peroxide has shown positive results involving teeth lightness and chroma shade parameters.

25|$|Other {{flammable}} liquids such as diesel fuel, methanol, turpentine, jet fuel, and isopropyl alcohol {{have been used}} in place of, or combined with petrol. Thickening agents such as solvents, foam polystyrene, <b>baking</b> <b>soda,</b> petroleum jelly, tar, strips of tyre tubing, nitrocellulose, XPS foam, motor oil, rubber cement, detergent and dish soap have been added to help the burning liquid adhere to the target and create clouds of thick, choking smoke.|$|E
25|$|In {{industrial}} practice, {{the reaction}} is carried out by passing concentrated brine (salt water) through two towers. In the first, ammonia bubbles up through the brine and is absorbed by it. In the second, carbon dioxide bubbles up through the ammoniated brine, and sodium bicarbonate (<b>baking</b> <b>soda)</b> precipitates out of the solution. Note that, in a basic solution, NaHCO3 is less water-soluble than sodium chloride. The ammonia (NH3) buffers the solution at a basic pH; without the ammonia, a hydrochloric acid byproduct would render the solution acidic, and arrest the precipitation.|$|E
25|$|By 1900, a paste made of {{hydrogen}} peroxide and <b>baking</b> <b>soda</b> was recommended {{for use with}} toothbrushes. Pre-mixed toothpastes were first marketed in the 19th century, but did not surpass the popularity of tooth-powder until World War I. In 1880, Doctor Washington Sheffield of New London, CT manufactured toothpaste into a collapsible tube, Dr. Sheffield's Creme Dentifrice. He had the idea after his son traveled to Paris and saw painters using paint from tubes. In York in 1896, Colgate & Company Dental Cream was packaged in collapsible tubes imitating Sheffield. The original collapsible toothpaste tubes were made of lead.|$|E
