However, an employer may not bring a claim for <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> contract if an employee is complaining simply of unfair dismissal (which is not a claim for <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> contract but a statutory claim).

40|$|The {{petroleum}} prospectivity of an exhumed basin {{is largely}} {{dependent on the}} ability of pre-existing traps to retain oil and gas volumes during and after the exhumation event. Although faults may act as lateral seals in petroleum traps, they may start to become hydraulically conductive again and enable fluid flow and hydrocarbon leakage during fault reactivation. We constrain the present day in situ stresses of the exhumed Illizi Basin in Algeria and demonstrate that the primary north–south and NW–SE (vertical strike-slip) fault systems in the study area are close to critical stress (i. e. an incipient state of shear failure). By contrast, the overpressured and unexhumed Berkine Basin and Hassi Messaoud areas to the north {{do not appear to be}} characterized by critical stress conditions. We present conceptual models of stress evolution and demonstrate that a sedimentary basin with benign in situ stresses at maximum burial may change to being characterized by critical stress conditions on existing fault systems during exhumation. These models are supportive of the idea that the <b>breaching</b> <b>of</b> a <b>closed,</b> overpressured system during exhumation of the Illizi Basin may have been a driving mechanism for the regional updip flow of high-salinity formation water within the Ordovician reservoirs during Eocene–Miocene time. This work also has implications for petroleum exploration in exhumed basins. Fault-bounded traps with faults oriented at a high angle to the maximum principal horizontal stress direction in strike-slip or normal faulting stress regimes are more likely to have retained hydrocarbons in exhumed basins than fault-bounded traps with faults that are more optimally oriented for shear failure and therefore have a greater propensity to become critically stressed during exhumation...|$|R
50|$|In Douglas v Hello No 1 2001 2 WLR 992 the Douglases {{attempted}} {{to gain an}} injunction to prevent the publication of unauthorized photographs. The Douglases and OK!

However the only successful claims were for <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> confidence and for the <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> the Data Protection Act.

40|$|Besides anti-suit injunctions, {{recent cases}} suggest that <b>breaches</b> <b>of</b> {{jurisdiction}} clauses {{may also be}} remedied by damages. Without distinguishing between types of jurisdiction clauses or the manner <b>of</b> <b>breach,</b> existing analyses appear to assume that these damages must be contractual, by analogy with <b>breaches</b> <b>of</b> arbitration clauses. In relation to <b>breaches</b> <b>of</b> English jurisdiction clauses, this may be inappropriate, given that the basis and effect of English judgments are distinct from those of arbitral awards. Contractual damages for <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> English jurisdiction clauses may thus be difficult to justify. However, tortious damages may arguably be available as an alternative...|$|R

50|$|Millett LJ allowed Mothew's appeal, {{and held}} that a causal link needed to be established. Just because the {{solicitor}} himself had fiduciary duties to his clients, that {{did not mean that}} every <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> duty of care was a <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> a fiduciary duty. When considering <b>breaches</b> <b>of</b> trust, causation need not be demonstrated, since these are concerned with acts of bad faith or <b>breaches</b> <b>of</b> the duty of loyalty that result in restitutionary damages. The building society had been fully informed and had consented to Mothew's course of action, which broke the causal link.|$|R
50|$|The {{constructive}} trust {{was the only}} appropriate remedy here, given {{the uniqueness of the}} property, given the fact Corona would have acquired the property but for Lac's <b>breaches</b> <b>of</b> duty, and given the virtual impossibility of accurately valuing the property. In addition, it was the only just remedy, regardless of whether it was based on <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> confidence or <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> a fiduciary relationship. The remedies available under one head are those available to the other. Given a <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> a duty of confidence, the finding of a fiduciary relationship was not strictly necessary.|$|R
5000|$|In England and Wales, <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> {{the peace}} {{is not an}} offence, {{in the sense that}} it is not {{punishable}} either by a fine or imprisonment either at statute or common law and nor do proceedings for <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> the peace give rise to any conviction. [...] In England and Wales, constables (or other persons) are permitted to arrest a person to [...] "prevent a further <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> the peace" [...] which allows for the police or the public to arrest a person before a <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> the peace has occurred. This is permitted when it is reasonable to believe should the person remain, that they would continue with their course of conduct and that a <b>Breach</b> <b>of</b> the Peace would occur.|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} part of a wider study by this author where it is argued that the legal {{consequences}} following a <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> Article 3 ECHR when a detainee ill-treated during police questioning are underdeveloped. This paper will focus on two legal consequences which follow a <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> the provision - the admissibility of evidence obtained as a <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> Article 3 and remedies available to applicants who have had a determination that they have been a victim <b>of</b> a <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> Article 3. This paper argues that all confession evidence and derivative real evidence which have been obtained through a <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> Article 3 ECHR should be excluded at trial. This paper also reflects on the issue that the current mode through which victims of abuse amounting to <b>breaches</b> <b>of</b> Article are redressed is solely monetary compensation. This paper argues that the Court should further develop its remedial powers to enhance its ability to provide adequate redress to victims <b>of</b> <b>breaches</b> <b>of</b> Article 3 ECHR. It is argued that judicial developments in these two areas could enhance the protection of detainees held during questioning...|$|R

50|$|Wrongful interference: {{the unified}} theory which treated causing loss by {{unlawful}} means {{as an extension}} of the tort <b>of</b> inducing a <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> contract was abandoned; inducing <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> contract and causing loss by unlawful means were two separate torts.inducing a <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> contract was a tort of accessory liability, and an intention to cause a <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> contract was a necessary and sufficient requirement for liability; a person had to know that he was inducing a <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> contract and to intend to do; that a conscious decision not to inquire into the existence of a fact could be treated as knowledge for the purposes of the tort; that a person who knowingly induced a <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> contract as a means to an end had the necessary intent even if he was not motivated by malice but had acted with the motive of securing an economic advantage for himself; that, however, a <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> contract which was neither an end in itself nor a means to an end but was merely a foreseeable consequence of a person’s acts did not give rise to liability; and that there could be no secondary liability without primary liability, and therefore a person could not be liable for inducing a <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> contract unless there had in fact been a breach by the contracting party.|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesThe thesis {{discusses}} {{the origin and}} development <b>of</b> anticipatory <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> contract in South African law {{leading up to the}} decision in Datacolor International (Pty) Ltd v Intamarket (Pty) Ltd 2001 (2) SA 284 (SCA) and the implications of this decision on the law. This decision is generally regarded as the culmination of the development of a 'new approach' to repudiation, as a form <b>of</b> anticipatory <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> contract, in South African law and this 'new approach' and other aspects of the decision will be discussed in detail. Drawing on Datacolor International (Pty) Ltd v Intamarket (Pty) Ltd and the decisions of Lord Diplock in English law the thesis proposes a model for anticipatory <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> contract that defines anticipatory <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> contract as conduct or circumstances that support a conclusion, with reasonable certainty, that a contracting party will fail to perform their primary obligations under the contract correctly and that such failure justifies affording the aggrieved party a right to cancel the contract. Anticipatory <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> contract will therefore always amount to a material <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> contract, where material <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> contract consists of a failure by a contracting party to perform her or his primary obligations correctly, or conduct which indicates with reasonable certainty that she or he will fail to perform their primary obligations correctly, which will substantially deprive the aggrieved party of the benefit of the contract. If, balancing the interests of the parties, it would be fair to afford the aggrieved party a right to cancel the contract this conduct will amount to a material <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> contract. Anticipatory <b>breaches</b> <b>of</b> contract are those material <b>breaches</b> which consist <b>of</b> conduct indicating that a failure will occur rather than consisting of the actual failure to perform a primary obligation. In addition to defining when the remedy of cancellation is available to an aggrieved party the thesis also proposes certain other modifications to the remedies available to an aggrieved party facing an anticipatory <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> contract including introducing into the South African law, as a remedy for an anticipated <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> contract, a 'request for an adequate assurance of performance' modelled on the remedy of the same name originating in the Uniform Commercial Code...|$|R
