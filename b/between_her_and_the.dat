5|$|On September 29, 2014, member Jessica {{announced}} {{that she had been}} dismissed from the group. S.M. Entertainment confirmed this and stated that Jessica was no longer a member of Girls' Generation due to conflicts <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> group's schedules. Girls' Generation continued to promote as an eight-member group thereafter. The remaining eight members proceeded with the group's activities, holding The Best Live concert at Tokyo Dome on December 9, 2014. The concert was a sellout and attracted 50,000 spectators. The recorded show was released as a DVD in April 2015, which topped both Oricon's DVD and Blu-ray charts simultaneously.|$|E

5|$|Both German ships {{initially}} concentrated {{their fire}} on Hood and destroyed her with salvoes of 8- and 15-inch shells. An 8-inch shell hit the boat deck and struck a ready service locker for the UP rocket projectors, and a fire blazed {{high above the}} first superstructure deck. At 05:58 at a range of , the force commander ordered a turn of 20 degrees to port to open the range and bring the full battery of the British ships to bear on Bismarck. As the turn began, Bismarck straddled Hood with her third and fourth four-gun salvoes and at 06:01 the fifth salvo hit her, causing a large explosion. Flames shot up near Hoods masts, then an orange-coloured fireball and an enormous smoke cloud obliterated the ship. On Prince of Wales, it seemed that Hood collapsed amidships, and the bow and stern could be seen rising as she rapidly settled. Prince of Wales made a sharp starboard turn to avoid hitting the debris {{and in doing so}} further closed the range <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> German ships. In the four-minute action, Hood, the largest battlecruiser in the world, had been sunk. 1,419 officers and men were killed. Only three men survived.|$|E

5|$|In 1991, {{within two}} weeks of {{finishing}} her GCSE examinations, Winslet made her screen debut {{as one of the}} main cast members of the BBC science fiction television series Dark Season. Her part was that of Reet, a schoolgirl who helps her classmates fight against a sinister man distributing free computers to her school. She did not earn much from the job, and at age 16, a lack of funds forced Winslet to leave Redroofs. To support herself, she worked at a delicatessen. In 1992, she had a small part in the television film Anglo-Saxon Attitudes, an adaptation of Angus Wilson's satirical novel of the same name. Winslet, who weighed 185 pounds at the time, played the daughter of an obese woman in it. While filming, an off-hand comment from the director Diarmuid Lawrence about the likeness <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> actress who played her mother prompted Winslet to lose weight. She next took {{on the role of the}} young daughter of a bankrupt middle-aged man (played by Ray Winstone) in the television sitcom Get Back (1992–93). She also had a guest role in a 1993 episode of the medical drama series Casualty.|$|E
5|$|Madonna {{lies down}} on a pew and has a dream in which she is falling through space. Suddenly, a woman, {{representing}} power and strength, catches her. She advises Madonna {{to do what is}} right and tosses her back up. Still dreaming, Madonna returns to the statue, which transforms into the black man she had seen earlier. He kisses her forehead and leaves the church as she picks up a knife and cuts her hands, bleeding. Interspersing scenes show Madonna singing and dancing wildly in front of burning crosses, erotic scenes <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> saint, and the singer being surrounded by a choir inside the church. Madonna wakes up, goes to the jail and tells the police that she had witnessed the crime and that the black man is innocent; the police release him. The video ends as Madonna dances in front of the burning crosses, and then everybody involved in the story line takes a bow as curtains come down on the set.|$|E
5|$|Monitor, to the {{surprise}} of Virginias crew, had emerged from behind Minnesota and went straight for the approaching Virginia and positioned herself <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> grounded Minnesota, preventing the Confederate ironclad from further engaging the vulnerable wooden ship at close range. At 8:45am Worden gave the order to fire where Greene fired the first shots of the battle between the two ironclads which harmlessly deflected off the Confederate ironclad. During the battle Monitor fired solid shot, about once every eight minutes, while Virginia fired shell exclusively. The ironclads generally fought at close range for about four hours, ending at 12:15pm, ranging from a few yards to more than a hundred. Both ships were constantly in motion, maintaining a circular pattern. Because of Virginias weak engines, massive size and weight and with a draft of , she was slow and difficult to maneuver, taking her half an hour to complete a 180-degree turn.|$|E

5|$|Unknown to Mercedes Barbudo, the Spanish {{authorities}} in Puerto Rico under Governor Miguel de la Torre, were {{suspicious of the}} correspondence <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> rebel factions of Venezuela. Secret agents of the Spanish Government had retained some of her mail and delivered it to Governor de la Torre. He ordered an investigation and had her mail confiscated. The Government believed that the correspondence served as propaganda of the Bolivian ideals {{and that it would}} also serve to motivate Puerto Ricans to seek their independence. Governor Miguel de la Torre ordered her arrest on the charge that she planned to overthrow the Spanish Government in Puerto Rico. Since Puerto Rico did not have a women's prison she was held without bail at the Castillo San Cristóbal. Among the evidence which the Spanish authorities presented against her was Rojas letter. She was exiled to Cuba where she was able to escape and make her way to Venezuela where she spent her final days.|$|E
5|$|Fran {{once lived}} with her sisters Jote and Mjrn in Eruyt Village, the secluded Viera {{settlement}} in Golmore Jungle, but became restless and desired to see the outside world. This was {{a major source of}} conflict <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> other viera, especially her elder sister Jote, who served as the village matriarch. Fran argued that although all Viera begin their lives in the forest, they are not necessarily bound to remain there to the end. When the party encounters an impassable Viera barrier on the path through Golmore, Fran is forced to return to the village and ask for help. She learns from Jote that their youngest sister Mjrn has run off to the nearby magicite mines. When Fran finds her and brings her back, Mjrn reveals she wishes to leave Golmore, but Fran advises her against doing so, relating how her own independence has cost her her family and the ability to commune with the Wood. Fran accepts that she is now part of the Hume world, and asks for a confirmation from Jote that the Wood accepts her before she leaves. Jote replies that The Wood misses her child and is jealous of the hume that has taken her away. Fran smiles {{for the first time in}} the game, knowing her sister is lying and still cares for her, as she leaves The Wood for good. In Revenant Wings, Balthier and Fran are searching for the Cache of Glabados. Fran was voiced by Nicole Fantl in English and by Rika Fukami in Japanese. She also appears in Itadaki Street Portable.|$|E

The Peru–Bolivian Confederation, allied with France, declared the War of the Confederation to Argentina and Chile. Rosas resisted the blockade longer than France estimated he would do, and his strategy of generating disputes between France and England over the blockade eventually gave fruit. France lifted the blockade in 1840, exchanging mutual most favoured nation status <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Argentine Confederation.|$|E

25|$|Anne {{was barely}} {{a year old}} when her mother became ill of what is {{believed}} to have been uterine cancer. Maria Branwell died on 15 September 1821. In order to provide a mother for his children, Patrick tried to remarry, but without success. Maria's sister, Elizabeth Branwell (1776–1842), moved to the parsonage, initially to nurse her dying sister, but she spent the rest of her life there raising the children. She did it from a sense of duty, but she was a stern woman who expected respect, rather than love. There was little affection <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> older children, but Anne, according to tradition, was her favourite.|$|E

25|$|After coaching, Yow {{also served}} as an {{associate}} athletic director at the University of North Carolina-Greensboro. Saint Louis University hired Yow as its athletic director in August 1990. The media reported a strained relationship <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> men's basketball coach Rich Grawer, which Yow denied. She fired Grawer after a 523 season and hired Charlie Spoonhour as his replacement. Spoonhour won the Henry Iba Coach of the Year Award for leading Saint Louis to the NCAA Tournament in the 199394 season and received a pay raise and contract extension through 2000. Yow remained at Saint Louis University for four years, until hired to the same position at the University of Maryland in August 1994.|$|E
25|$|Ponce's younger daughter, María, {{separated}} from her husband by mutual agreement since late 1173 or early 1174, when he founded the Order of Mountjoy, was installed as the first abbess of her mother's foundation at Carrizo in 1184, a position she held until her death in 1191. She inherited an estate at Astorga, and there is preserved a conuenientia (pact) <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> tenants of her estate there in the archives of Carrizo. The pact stipulates that annually on Martinmas (11 November) the inhabitants should pay a rent of two solidi and a portion of produce for every parcel of land they owned. The document lists twenty-three peasant farmers and their land tenures, totalling eighty-eight solidi in cash per annum for the abbess.|$|E
25|$|The girls try {{to adjust}} to the new world in which Alison is very much alive, while still {{trying to keep up with}} Ali's new lie about her {{whereabouts}} over the last two years.

The girls think Shana was 'A', and with her gone, they no longer worry about 'A'. However, 'A' returns, blowing up the Cavanaugh house and leaving the liars more afraid than ever. With Alison back, Aria, Emily, Hanna and Spencer notice how their friendship has changed since Ali's disappearance. The other residents in Rosewood also deal with Alison coming home, and it leads to Mona making an army against her, consisting of residents whom Ali bullied back in the day. The liars try to figure out who killed Mrs. DiLaurentis, and if there is a connection <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> girl who was buried in Alison's grave, Bethany Young.|$|E

25|$|Despite rising back up {{to world}} No. 24 {{following}} this victory, she then withdrew from the 2008 Medibank International in Sydney, after suffering a right knee injury. Her failure to defend her previous year's semifinal performance at this event cost her 125 ranking points, which dipped her ranking back down to no. 30 for the week beginning 14 January. Going into the 2008 Australian Open, she had a further 140 ranking points to defend from her fourth-round performance in 2007. Faced with a relatively lenient draw in the early rounds, she survived a close three-set tussle with Séverine Brémond in the first round, before surpassing Maria Elena Camerin in straight sets in round two. A revitalised Marta Domachowska remained <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> defence of her ranking points, and although Li Na won the first set convincingly, she faltered thereafter and finally ceded the match to her Polish opponent by a single break of serve in the closely fought deciding set.|$|E
25|$|During the Russo-Swedish War (1788–90), Hedvig Elisabeth Charlotte {{entered into}} politics. Sweden's ally France was displeased about the war, and Gustav III {{gave her the}} task to act as the go-between in his {{negotiations}} with the French ambassador. In cooperation with {{the daughter of the}} ambassador, her friend Camille du Bois de la Motte, she handled the correspondence between the monarch and the ambassador, arranged secret meetings between them and acted as witness to them upon the King's request. This caused a rift <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> King when she realized that she had in fact been used to distract the ambassador. Adolf Fredrik Munck later blackened her {{in the eyes of the}} King by claiming that France was informed about the Swedish war plans through her friendship with Camille du Bois de la Motte. Knowing that her correspondence was read, she maintained a secret correspondence through her own net of couriers.|$|E
25|$|The {{return of}} Mary, Queen of Scots, to Scotland in 1560, led to further tension <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Protestant Lords of the Congregation. Mary claimed to favour {{religious}} toleration on the French model, however the Protestant establishment feared a reestablishment of Catholicism, and sought with English help to neutralise or depose Mary. Mary's {{marriage to a}} leading Catholic precipitated Mary's half-brother, the Earl of Moray, to join with other Protestant Lords in open rebellion. Mary set out for Stirling on 26 August 1565 to confront them. Moray and the rebellious lords were routed and fled into exile; the decisive military action becoming known as the Chaseabout Raid. In 1567, Mary was captured by another rebellious force at the Battle of Carberry Hill and imprisoned in Loch Leven Castle, where {{she was forced to}} abdicate the Scottish throne in favour of her one-year-old son James. Mary escaped from Loch Leven the following year, and once again managed to raise a small army. After her army's defeat at the Battle of Langside on May 13, she fled to England, where she was imprisoned by Queen Elizabeth. Her son James VI was raised as a Protestant, later becoming King of England as well as Scotland.|$|E
