40|$|Abstract—Our {{environment}} {{is replete with}} visual cues in-tended to guide human navigation. For example, there are <b>building</b> <b>directories</b> at entrances and room numbers next to doors. By developing a robot wheelchair system that can interpret these cues, we will create a more robust and more usable system. This paper describes the design and development of our robot wheelchair system, called Wheeley, and its vision-based navigation system. The robot wheelchair system uses stereo vision to build maps of the environment through which it travels; this map can then be annotated with information gleaned from signs. We also describe the planned integration of an assistive robot arm to help with pushing elevator buttons and opening door handles. I...|$|R

50|$|From {{the time}} when the village was ﬁrst settled until the 16th century, no Hachenbach inhabitants’ names are known. The ﬁrst known names {{appeared}} in a 1542 taxation roll from the Waldgraviate-Rhinegraviate of the Eßweiler Tal. Written there are ten names, likely householders’. A 1586 <b>building</b> <b>directory</b> names 14 Rauchhaber (literally “smoke havers”, that is, people who have a hearth, and therefore a household) who had to pay contributions in kind. It can be assumed that in 1609, some 80 or 90 people lived in Hachenbach. A 1743 document is the oldest full directory of inhabitants that is still preserved. There were then 87 souls and 20 hearths in Hachenbach. Of the 307 inhabitants in Hachenbach in 1998, 30% were more than 70 years old.|$|E
50|$|Some {{people thought}} live TV was the {{beginning}} of a truly new storytelling medium—one uniquely suited to intimate, unadorned, psychological dramas—but it turned out to be a beginning with a tiny middle and a rushed end... Patterns was so well-received that Kraft mounted a live repeat of the show a month later, and the intimate TV show was turned into a less intimate (and somehow less satisfying) movie in 1956. Except for the use of terms like “mimeographed” and “teletype,” little about the drama seems dated, unless one is of the opinion that corporate politics and boardroom bloodletting no longer exist... With minimally judicious scene-setting (shots of clocks, a <b>building</b> <b>directory,</b> a switchboard) and a rapid introduction of characters, Serling pulls a viewer almost immediately into his story, a tale of corporate morality—or the lack of it—and such everyday battles as the ones waged between conscience and ambition.|$|E
