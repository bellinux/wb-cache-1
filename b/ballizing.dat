50|$|Ball burnishing, or <b>ballizing,</b> is a {{replacement}} for other bore finishing operations such as grinding, honing, or polishing. A <b>ballizing</b> tool consists {{of one or more}} over-sized balls that are pushed through a hole. The tool is similar to a broach, but instead of cutting away material, it plows it out of the way.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} forms of {{burnishing}} processes, {{the most common}} are roller burnishing and ball burnishing (a subset of which is {{also referred to as}} <b>ballizing).</b> In both cases, a burnishing tool runs against the workpiece and plastically deforms its surface. In some instances of the latter case (and always in <b>ballizing),</b> it rubs, in the former it generally rotates and rolls. The workpiece may be at ambient temperature, or heated to reduce the forces and wear on the tool. The tool is usually hardened and coated with special materials to increase its life.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} chosen {{results of}} experimental and numerical research of <b>ballizing</b> {{process of the}} steel tubes. <b>Ballizing</b> process is a method of burnishing technology of an internal diameter by precisely forcing a ball through a slightly undersized pre-machined tubes. <b>Ballizing</b> process is a fast, low-cost process for sizing and finishing tubes. It consists of pressing a slightly oversized ball through an unfinished tube to quickly bring the hole to desired size. The ball is typically made from a very hard material such as tungsten carbide or bearing steel. <b>Ballizing</b> process is by cold surface plastic forming of the surface structure, thereby leaving a layer of harder material and reducing its roughness. After theoretical and experimental analysis {{it was determined that}} the smaller the diameter of the balls, the bigger intensity of stress and strain and strain rate. The paper presents influence of <b>ballizing</b> process on the strain and stress state and on the surface roughness reduction rate of the steel tubes...|$|E
