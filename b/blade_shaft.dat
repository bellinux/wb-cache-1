40|$|AbstractThe {{hydrodynamic}} forces imparted on a {{tidal turbine}} rotor, whilst {{causing it to}} rotate and hence generate power, will also cause the blades to deform. This deformation will affect the turbine's performance if {{not included in the}} early design phase and could lead to a decrease in power output and a reduction in operational life. Conversely, designing blades to allow them to deform slightly may reduce localised stress and therefore prolong the life of the blades and allow the blades to deform in to their optimum operational state. The aim {{of this paper is to}} better understand the kinetic energy extraction by varying the material modulus of a turbine <b>blade.</b> <b>Shaft</b> torque/power, blade tip displacement, and axial thrust results are presented for 2, 3 and 4 bladed rotor configurations at peak power extraction. For the rotor design studied the FSI model data show that there is a low sensitivity to blade deformation for the 2, 3 and 4 bladed rotors. However, the results reveal that the 3 bladed rotor displayed maximum hydrodynamic performance as a rigid structure which then decreased as the blade deformed. The 2 and 4 bladed rotor configurations elucidated a slight increase in hydrodynamic performance with deflection...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The dynamic {{behavior}} of a rotor consisting of two bladed discs on a solid shaft is considered. The effect of shaft flexibility on the dynamic characteristics of the bladed discs and the coupling effects between the shaft and bladed disc modes are investigated. Results presented for various cases with differing blade flexibility show clearly the coupling effects in a bladed disc-shaft system. Interference diagrams are developed, from which the dynamic {{behavior of}} a system can be predicted for differing flexibility relationships between the solid shafts and the bladed discs. In this study, the global rotating mode shapes of flexible bladed disc-shaft assemblies have been calculated. Rotational effects such as centrifugal stiffening have been accounted for, and all the possible couplings between the flexible parts have been allowed. Gyroscopic effects {{have been included in}} the shaft with two discs. Calculated natural frequencies obtained from the <b>blade,</b> <b>shaft,</b> bladed disc and shaft with two discs have been checked to determine resonance conditions and coupling effects. The calculations have shown the influence of the shaft on the natural frequencies of the bladed discs up to one nodal diameter frequencies. The torsional frequency of the shaft with two discs is coupled with the zero nodal diameter modes of the single bladed discs. The bending modes of the shaft are coupled with one nodal diameter modes of the bladed discs. It is shown that including the shaft in the bladed discs model is important from a designer’s point of view and can change the spectrum of frequencies considerably...|$|E

Initially, one cortical screw was inserted to allow directional compression at fracture site, followed by the insertion of locking screws. In the majority of patients, this practice was followed. For most patients, an indirect reduction was attempted, but no attempt was made to reduce the posteromedial fragment if it required extensive soft tissue dissection for fixation.

40|$|The {{penetration}} of intermittent {{wind and solar}} power to the grid network above managea-ble limits disrupts electrical power grids. Consequently, hydraulic turbines synchronized to the grid experience total load rejection and are forced to shut down immediately. The turbine runner accelerates to runaway speeds in a few seconds, inducing high-amplitude, unsteady pressure loading on the blades. This sometimes results in {{a failure of the}} turbine components. Moreover, the unsteady pressure loading significantly affects the operating life of the turbine runner. Transient measurements were carried out on a scale model of a Francis turbine prototype (specific speed 0. 27) during an emergency shutdown with a transition into total load rejection. A detailed analysis of variables such as the head, dis-charge, pressure at different locations including the runner <b>blades,</b> <b>shaft</b> torque, and the guide vane angular movements are performed. The maximum amplitudes of the unsteady pressure fluctuations in the turbine were observed under a runaway condition. The ampli-tudes were 2. 1 and 2. 6 times that of the pressure loading at the best efficiency point in the vaneless space and runner, respectively.

A land-based NREL 5 MW variable speed pitch reg- ulated wind turbine is considered as a reference.

The main purpose is to investigate the severity of end effects on structural loads and responses and consequently identify the high-risk components according to the type and amplitude of fault using a servo-aero-elastic simulation code, HAWC 2. Both transient and steady state effects of faults are studied. Such information is useful for wind turbine fault detection and identification as well as system reliability analysis.
