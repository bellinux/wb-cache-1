5|$|During rehearsal, Marge {{struggles with}} {{a scene in}} which Blanche is {{supposed}} to break a glass <b>bottle</b> <b>and</b> attack Stanley, but she cannot muster enough anger towards Stanley to break the bottle. After coming home, Marge asks Homer to help her learn her lines, but Homer is uninterested. The day before the performance, Marge and Ned are again practising the bottle scene as Homer arrives to drive Marge home. Homer repeatedly interrupts the rehearsal. Imagining that Stanley is Homer, Marge finally smashes the <b>bottle</b> <b>and</b> lunges at Ned.|$|E

5|$|In the Summer of 1917, {{businessman}} R. R. Rochell and his Birmingham, Alabama based Grapico Bottling Works began purchasing Grapico syrup barrels from J.

Grossman's Sons and began bottling and selling Grapico in Mississippi. In 1918, Rochell's Grapico Bottling Works opened a bottling plant in Hattiesburg, Mississippi as a second Mississippi bottler and seller of Grapico.|$|E
30|$|Drinking <b>bottles</b> <b>and</b> stove-top moka pots made of {{aluminum}} {{have become very}} popular. Storing drinks in <b>bottles</b> <b>and</b> preparing coffee in a moka pot may result in the migration {{of aluminum}} to the beverage.|$|R
50|$|Before {{the formal}} 1971 Oregon Bottle Bill, Oregon had already {{set up a}} less formal bottle return system that most stores {{and some of the}} public cooperated with. Inspired by the early Vermont bottle return system before it was repealed, Oregon's limited system paid 1 cent for beer <b>bottles</b> <b>and</b> cans and 3 cents for soda <b>bottles</b> <b>and</b> cans, and was started in the mid-1950s, and lasted {{through the rest of the}} 50s, {{throughout}} the 1960s and into the early 70s until the more formal <b>and</b> expanded <b>Bottle</b> Bill was enacted. The emphasis was on bottles, as bottlers were washed and re-used for fresh product sold to the public before health laws were enacted that stopped the re-wash system. And because of the low payout for the return of <b>bottles</b> <b>and</b> cans, and in spite of various anti-litter PSA advertising campaigns on Oregon television, only a relatively small percentage of Oregonians participated in the return of <b>bottles</b> <b>and</b> cans, <b>and</b> thus many <b>bottles</b> <b>and</b> cans still littered Oregon's highways and scenic areas throughout this entire early bottle-can recycling period.|$|R
25|$|Americans alone {{dispose of}} 130 billion <b>bottles</b> <b>and</b> cans every year, and 340 billion {{beverage}} <b>bottles</b> <b>and</b> cans are not recycled every year worldwide. According to SodaStream, use of home carbonation systems reduces packaging waste from <b>bottles</b> <b>and</b> cans, and the pollution {{caused by the}} transport of bottled drinks. According to an analysis by Carbon Trust, SodaStream is 75 per cent less greenhouse gas-intensive than generic colas sold in plastic (PET) bottles in the UK.|$|R
5|$|One further {{variation}} {{places a}} 6-sided die (although other sided die {{could also be}} used) {{on top of the}} bottle. If the bottle is knocked over and the die knocked onto the table, the player is awarded points equal to whatever side of the die lies facing upward when the die comes to a stop. This adds a random effect to hitting the <b>bottle</b> <b>and</b> in practice often results in players only striking the bottle in combination with other point-scoring shots.|$|E
5|$|Python {{can serve}} as a {{scripting}} language for web applications, e.g., via mod_wsgi for the Apache web server. With Web Server Gateway Interface, a standard API has evolved to facilitate these applications. Web frameworks like Django, Pylons, Pyramid, TurboGears, web2py, Tornado, Flask, <b>Bottle</b> <b>and</b> Zope support developers in the design and maintenance of complex applications. Pyjs and IronPython can be used to develop the client-side of Ajax-based applications. SQLAlchemy can be used as data mapper to a relational database. Twisted is a framework to program communications between computers, and is used (for example) by Dropbox.|$|E
5|$|A {{waterfall}} bong (or {{reverse bucket}} bong) is another method of smoking. It is assembled using a large plastic bottle (preferably about 2 liter), a bung or rubber stopper, a brass cut nozzle {{to act as}} a bowl and keep the marijuana (or other herbs) from entering the <b>bottle,</b> <b>and</b> an aerator screen. Once the bottle is filled to its neck in water the lid is screwed on, removing the rubber stopper and igniting the contents of the bowl leads to draining water to cause smoke to be drawn into the bottle. The cap is removed after the water has completely drained out, allowing the user to inhale the smoke.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the days}} when <b>bottles</b> were washed <b>and</b> re-used, drinks {{manufacturers}} paid shopkeepers and [...] "marine store collectors" [...] ("bottle-ohs") {{for the return of}} their (proprietary) containers, both <b>bottles</b> <b>and</b> crates. By arrangement between the manufacturers, the refund to the consumer was standardized (for many decades 2 pence, later 6 pence or 5c. for soft drink <b>bottles</b> <b>and</b> ½ pence for generic beer <b>bottles)</b> <b>and</b> the collectors received a premium for their part in the process. A substantial cost was incurred by the manufacturer in the transportation, sorting, storage, washing and sterilizing of the <b>bottles</b> <b>and</b> their inspection for contamination and damage. With the advent of cheaper single-use bottles great savings were achievable, and their subsequent disposal the responsibility of the consumer.|$|R

5|$|Any time deep {{focus was}} impossible—as {{in the scene}} in which Kane {{finishes}} a negative review of Susan's opera {{while at the same}} time firing the person who began writing the review—an optical printer was used to make the whole screen appear in focus, visually layering one piece of film onto another. However, some apparently deep-focus shots were the result of in-camera effects, as in the famous scene in which Kane breaks into Susan's room after her suicide attempt. In the background, Kane and another man break into the room, while simultaneously the medicine <b>bottle</b> <b>and</b> a glass with a spoon in it are in closeup in the foreground. The shot was an in-camera matte shot. The foreground was shot first, with the background dark. Then the background was lit, the foreground darkened, the film rewound, and the scene re-shot with the background action.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the episode, Jack and Liz are at a jewelry store, as Jack is searching for an engagement ring for Elisa. They shot that scene in a Cartier store in New York's Fifth Avenue, which was filmed on February 22, 2009. A scene featuring Sue LaRoche-Van der Hout (Sue Galloway) as the Grim Reaper, in which Jenna is led to believe Kenneth has gone into shock because of the strawberries, was cut from the airing. According to Jane Krakowski, in the DVD commentary for this episode, there were alternate scenes with Jenna letting Kenneth know about the tampering she did to Kenneth's items, his chickpea, water <b>bottle,</b> <b>and</b> harmonica.|$|E
5|$|Despite these challenges, {{the huge}} {{quantities}} of gold coming through Dawson City encouraged a lavish lifestyle amongst the richer prospectors. Saloons were typically open 24 hours a day, with whiskey the standard drink. Gambling was popular, {{with the major}} saloons each running their own rooms; a culture of high stakes evolved, with rich prospectors routinely betting $1,000 ($27,000) at dice or playing for a $5,000 ($140,000) poker pot. The establishments around Front Street had grand facades in a Parisian style, mirrors and plate-glass windows and, from late 1898, were lit by electric light. The dance halls in Dawson were particularly prestigious and major status symbols, both for customers and their owners. Wealthy prospectors were expected to drink champagne at $60 ($1,600) a <b>bottle,</b> <b>and</b> the Pavilion dancehall cost its owner, Charlie Kimball, as much as $100,000 ($80 million) to construct and decorate. Elaborate opera houses were built, bringing singers and specialty acts to Dawson.|$|E

50|$|More recently, many bottles {{have been}} {{designed}} for single-use. This often allows for thinner glass <b>bottles</b> <b>and</b> less expensive plastic <b>bottles</b> <b>and</b> aluminum beverage cans. Recycling rates have been increasing, particularly for aluminum. On a cost basis, the decision has often been made for non-returnable bottles.|$|R

Faye is later attacked by a heroin-addicted patient, and when Linden attempts to defend her, he is {{hit in the head}} with a glass <b>bottle</b> <b>and</b> dies. Faye suffers a breakdown in the aftermath of Linden's death, and is admitted to a psychiatric unit. She self-harms, and refuses to leave the unit when she goes into labour, until Jac assures her that Joseph does not intend to take their child away from her. Faye delivers a boy by Caesarean. She initially fails to bond with him, but when Joseph puts their divorce proceedings on hold, she makes an effort and names him Harry, after Joseph's deceased younger brother. Despite Joseph's opposition, she insists on returning to the psychiatric unit.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{subsequent}} setbacks {{in their}} relationship, such as Jac briefly deceiving Joseph {{into believing that}} she is pregnant with his child, Faye and Joseph marry. On {{the day of the}} ceremony, Linden confesses to Faye that he is in love with her, and they kiss. She instantly regrets it, however, and tells him that she loves Joseph. When Archie's nurse Lauren later accidentally administers him the wrong drug, he dies. Faye and Joseph grow apart in the aftermath and she develops romantic feelings for Linden. She and Joseph separate, but after she begins a relationship with Linden, she discovers that she is pregnant with Joseph's baby. Increasingly concerned that Faye may be a pathological liar, Linden terminates their relationship. Faye is later attacked by a heroin-addicted patient, and when Linden attempts to defend her, he is hit {{in the head with a}} glass <b>bottle</b> <b>and</b> dies.

Despite Joseph's opposition, she insists on returning to the psychiatric unit. Jac's support during this time results in a renewal of their relationship, and when Faye secretly makes plans to leave the country with Harry, Jac helps convince her to leave the baby with Joseph. Joseph struggles as a working father, and accepts a job as a GP in Penrith. Jac declines his offer to accompany him, so he departs with Harry, leaving her in tears.|$|E
