25|$|This {{step was}} then {{repeated}} in the third step. The plutonium was reduced again by adding ferrous ammonium sulfate. <b>Bismuth</b> <b>nitrate</b> and phosphoric acid were added and bismuth phosphate precipitated. It was dissolved in nitric acid and the bismuth phosphate was precipitated. This step resulted in reducing the gamma radiation by four more orders of magnitude, so the plutonium-bearing solution now had 100,000-th of the original gamma radiation. The plutonium solution was transferred from the 224 buildings to the 221 buildings, through underground pipes. In the fourth step, phosphoric acid was added and the bismuth phosphate precipitated and removed; potassium permanganate was added to oxidize the plutonium.|$|E
25|$|The {{second step}} was to {{separate}} the plutonium from the uranium and the fission products. <b>Bismuth</b> <b>nitrate</b> and phosphoric acid were added, producing bismuth phosphate, which was precipitated carrying the plutonium with it. This was {{very similar to the}} lanthanum fluoride process, in which lanthanum fluoride was used as the carrier. The precipitate was removed from the solution with a centrifuge and the liquid discharged as waste. Getting rid of the fission products reduced the gamma radiation by 90 percent. The precipitate was a plutonium-containing cake which was placed in another tank and dissolved in nitric acid. Sodium bismuthate or potassium permanganate was added to oxidize the plutonium. Plutonium would be carried by the bismuth phosphate in the tetravalent state but not in the hexavalent state. The bismuth phosphate would then be precipitated as a by product, leaving the plutonium behind in solution.|$|E

Ferroelectric, magnetic, and optical functionalities were demonstrated in these films, obtaining a high ferroelectric polarization at room temperature, ~ 67 μC × cm- 2, a dependence of the magnetization with the film thickness, 0. 60 and 2. 50 emu × g- 1 for the ~ 215 and ~ 42 -nm-thick films, and a direct band gap in the visible range, Eg ~ 2. 82 eV.
