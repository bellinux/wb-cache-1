The paper defines a new scheme of building single <b>bit</b> <b>error</b> correction and double <b>bit</b> <b>error</b> detection (SEC-DED) codes using CA, and also reports a fast hardware decoder for the code.|$|E

25|$|When a {{photodiode}} {{is used in}} {{an optical}} communication system, all these parameters contribute to {{the sensitivity of the}} optical receiver, which is the minimum input power required for the receiver to achieve a specified <b>bit</b> <b>error</b> rate.|$|E
50|$|It is {{important}} to check each memory location periodically, frequently enough, before multiple <b>bit</b> <b>errors</b> within the same word are too likely to occur, because the one <b>bit</b> <b>errors</b> can be corrected, but the multiple <b>bit</b> <b>errors</b> are not correctable, {{in the case of}} usual (as of 2008) ECC memory modules.|$|R
40|$|Abstract-Two {{types of}} single event effects - <b>bit</b> <b>errors</b> and single event {{functional}} interrupts - were observed during heavy-ion {{testing of the}} AD 8151 crosspoint switch. <b>Bit</b> <b>errors</b> occurred in bursts with {{the average number of}} bits in a burst being dependent on both the ion LET and on the data rate. A pulsed laser was used to identify the locations on the chip where the <b>bit</b> <b>errors</b> and single event functional interrupts occurred. <b>Bit</b> <b>errors</b> originated in the switches, drivers, and output buffers. Single event functional interrupts occurred when the laser was focused on the second rank latch containing the data specifying the state of each switch in the 33 x 17 matrix...|$|R
50|$|DC-balanced {{signals are}} used in {{communications}} systems to prevent <b>bit</b> <b>errors</b> when passing through circuits with capacitive coupling or transformers. <b>Bit</b> <b>errors</b> can occur when a series of 1's create a DC level that charges the capacitor of the high-pass filter used as the AC coupler, bringing the signal input down incorrectly to a 0-level. In order to avoid these kinds of <b>bit</b> <b>errors,</b> most line codes are designed to produce DC-balanced waveforms. The most common classes of DC balanced line codes are constant-weight codes and paired-disparity codes.|$|R
25|$|For comparison, 10−18 to 10−15 is the uncorrectable <b>bit</b> <b>error</b> rate of {{a typical}} hard disk. In theory, 128-bit hash functions, such as MD5, should stay within that range until about 820 billion documents, even if its {{possible}} outputs are many more.|$|E
25|$|Without error {{correcting}} codes, {{digital audio}} {{would not be}} technically feasible. The Reed–Solomon codes can correct a corrupted symbol with a single <b>bit</b> <b>error</b> just as easily as it can correct a symbol with all bits wrong. This makes the RS codes particularly suitable for correcting burst errors. By far, the most common application of RS codes is in compact discs. In addition to basic error correction provided by RS codes, protection against burst errors due to scratches on the disc is provided by a cross interleaver.|$|E
25|$|All {{single bit}} errors within the bitfilter period {{mentioned}} above (for even {{terms in the}} generator polynomial) can be identified uniquely by their residual. So CRC method {{can be used to}} correct single-bit errors as well (within those limits, e.g. 32767 bits with optimal generator polynomials of degree 16). Since all odd errors leave an odd residual, all even an even residual, 1-bit errors and 2-bit errors can be distinguished. However, like other SECDED techniques, CRCs cannot always distinguish between 1-bit errors and 3-bit errors. When 3 or more bit errors occur in a block, CRC <b>bit</b> <b>error</b> correction will be erroneous itself and produce more errors.|$|E

25|$|As {{the feature}} size of flash memory cells reaches the 15-16 nm minimum limit, further flash density {{increases}} will {{be driven by}} TLC (3bits/cell) combined with vertical stacking of NAND memory planes. The decrease in endurance and increase in uncorrectable <b>bit</b> <b>error</b> rates that accompany feature size shrinking can be compensated by improved error correction mechanisms.

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we propose}} and {{evaluate}} {{the performance of a}} new adaptive HARQ technique that utilizes the correlation among <b>bit</b> <b>errors</b> at the output of a convolutional decoder. The proposed correlated bit-error hybrid ARQ (CB-HARQ) uses error events encountered in a soft-input softoutput (SISO) decoder to capture the correlation in <b>bit</b> <b>errors.</b> Retransmission is requested for selected coded symbols that have the potential to correct a set of message bits associated with these error events. The performance of the proposed technique is compared to conventional incremental redundancy HARQ that uses rate-compatible punctured convolutional (RCPC) codes and reliability-based HARQ (RB-HARQ) that does not utilize correlation between error events. The fundamental difference between CB-HARQ and RB-HARQ is that CB-HARQ tries to correct error events occurring in a decoder whereas RB-HARQ tries to correct individual <b>bit</b> <b>errors.</b> The results show that the proposed HARQ technique based on correlated <b>bit</b> <b>errors</b> can provide much higher throughput.
