She had plans to present the president with a petition to place a mandatory carbon cap on the United States. The goal of the petition was compliance with the commitment made by President Bill Clinton in previous years to follow the Kyoto Protocol. However, she {{was not able to}} present the petition <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> was rushed away after the concert, due to security concerns.|$|E
5|$|As the {{composition}} is not precisely defined, some states {{which have a}} considerable division of executive power can {{find it difficult to}} decide who should attend the meetings. While an MEP, Alexander Stubb argued that {{there was no need for}} the President of Finland to attend Council meetings with or instead of the Prime Minister of Finland (who was head of European foreign policy). In 2008, having become Finnish Foreign Minister, Stubb was forced out of the Finnish delegation to the emergency council meeting on the Georgian crisis <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> wanted to attend the high-profile summit as well as the Prime Minister (only two people from each country could attend the meetings). This was despite Stubb being head of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe at the time which was heavily involved in the crisis. Problems also occurred in Poland where the President of Poland and the Prime Minister of Poland were of different parties and had a different foreign policy response to the crisis. A similar situation arose in Romania between President Traian Băsescu and Prime Minister Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu in 2007–2008 and again in 2012 with Prime Minister Victor Ponta, who both opposed the president.|$|E

2500|$|There {{has been}} four cases where <b>the</b> Vice <b>President</b> has assumed <b>the</b> Presidency, {{three of which}} <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> <b>President's</b> death, and one <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> <b>President's</b> resignation: ...|$|R
50|$|Zapruder {{added that}} he had assumed the shots came from behind him <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>President's</b> head went {{backwards}} from the fatal shot, and also that the wound {{on the side of}} <b>the</b> <b>President's</b> head was facing that direction. He also said he believed it because police officers ran to the area behind him.|$|R
5000|$|However, {{elections}} in the United States often do become de facto national races between the political parties. In {{what is known as}} [...] "presidential coattails", candidates in presidential elections usually bring out supporters who then vote for his or her party's candidates for other offices, usually resulting in the presidential winner's party gaining seats in Congress. On the other hand, midterm elections are sometimes regarded as a referendum on <b>the</b> sitting <b>president's</b> and/or incumbent party's performance. There is a historical pattern that <b>the</b> incumbent <b>president's</b> party loses seats in midterm elections. This may be <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>President's</b> popularity has slipped since election, or <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>President's</b> popularity encouraged supporters to come out to vote for him or her in the presidential election, but these supporters are less likely to vote when <b>the</b> <b>President</b> is not up for election.|$|R
25|$|After the {{opposition}} parties deadlocked the 2007 presidential election by boycotting the parliament, the ruling AKP proposed a constitutional reform package. The reform package was first vetoed by President Sezer. Then he applied to the Turkish constitutional court about the reform package, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> is unable to veto amendments for the second time. The court {{did not find any}} problems in the package and 69% of the voters supported the constitutional changes.|$|E
25|$|But {{the site}} for the President's grave was quickly changed to the {{hillside}} just below Arlington House. The site was chosen <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> and his friend, architect John Carl Warnecke, happened to visit the site in March 1963 and the President had admired the peaceful atmosphere of the location. The initial suggestion to bury President Kennedy at Arlington appears to have been made by Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara. First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy agreed to the change. Although Kennedy's sisters and many of his long-time associates from Massachusetts were opposed to burial at Arlington, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy visited the site with McNamara on Saturday, November 23, and concluded that Mrs. Kennedy's wishes should be honored.|$|E
25|$|While K.L. Devaser {{was quite}} outspoken, his {{influence}} was largely among the urban-based Indian elite and he lacked wider grassroots support. For {{the first eight}} years, the MIC leaders were either of North Indian or Malayalee origin, representing a minority among the Malayan Indians. The majority of Indians (90%) in Malaya at that time were Tamils, mainly the labourers in plantations. Indian plantation workers, the main group of wageworkers in Malaya at the time, experienced enforced segregation because of plantation compound housing. The plantation labour system also worked against the integration of Indian workers into society at large and perpetuated racial and occupational differentiation. For one thing, {{they were unable to}} acquire skills that would facilitate their move to betterpaying jobs elsewhere. Migrant plantation workers were therefore marginalized and polarized in Malaya. Their wages in the post World War II era, which were around 50 cents a day, were tied to rubber prices, falling when the rubber price fell, but never rising when prices rose. K.L. Devaser came under heavy criticism from the Tamil media for not addressing the pressing issues facing the community. Some in the party felt that there was a need for a leader with a stronger relationship with the party’s grassroots. In March 1955, reports in the local daily Tamil Murasu urged Tamils to boycott the MIC. Even in 1955, the Indians clamored for a change in MIC’s leadership and a change did take place <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> had the decency to recognize that he has overstayed his welcome and gave way for change.The MIC's main challenge then, was to reconcile the political aspirations of the middle class with the needs of the labour class, who then comprised 84% of the plantation workforce.|$|E

50|$|Independent {{agencies}} of the United States federal government are those agencies that exist outside of the federal executive departments (those headed by a Cabinet secretary) and the Executive Office of <b>the</b> <b>President.</b> In a more narrow sense, the term may {{also be used to}} describe agencies that, while constitutionally part of the executive branch, are independent of presidential control, usually <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>president's</b> power to dismiss the agency head or a member is limited.|$|R

500|$|Congressional Democrats {{and health}} policy experts like MIT {{economics}} professor Jonathan Gruber and David Cutler argued that guaranteed issue would require both community rating and an individual mandate {{to ensure that}} adverse selection and/or [...] "free riding" [...] would not result in an insurance [...] "death spiral". This approach was taken <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> and congressional leaders had concluded that more progressive plans, such as the (single-payer) Medicare for All act, could not obtain filibuster-proof support in the Senate. By deliberately drawing on bipartisan ideas—the same basic outline was supported by former Senate majority leaders Howard Baker, Bob Dole, Tom Daschle and George J. Mitchell—the bill's drafters hoped to garner the votes necessary for passage.|$|E
500|$|Last Order: Final Fantasy VII was {{produced}} and scripted by Madhouse {{and directed by}} Morio Asaka. The decision to create Last Order arose from the positive reaction towards a popular promotional clip created by Madhouse for the game Before Crisis. Madhouse was chosen to produce the OVA partly because of their success with the clip and <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> of Madhouse was very enthusiastic about the project. However, {{the main reason for}} choosing Madhouse was that the company [...] "understood the significance" [...] of making a Final Fantasy VII animation, as it was considered a large responsibility to animate [...] "the most popular game in the FF [...] series." [...] Tetsuya Nomura, the character designer for the Final Fantasy VII series and co-director of Advent Children, acted as the supervising director. He had the right to reject or accept concept drawings for Last Order. As a result, Nomura had a large quantity of images redrawn, to the extent that [...] "the entire production was in jeopardy." ...|$|E
500|$|The debt-ceiling {{crises of}} 2011 and 2013 raised the {{question}} of what is the President's authority under Section 4. Some, such as legal scholar Garrett Epps, fiscal expert Bruce Bartlett and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, have argued that a debt ceiling may be unconstitutional and therefore void as long as it interferes with the duty of the government to pay interest on outstanding bonds and to make payments owed to pensioners (that is, Social Security and Railroad Retirement Act recipients). Legal analyst Jeffrey Rosen has argued that Section 4 gives the President unilateral authority to raise or ignore the national debt ceiling, and that if challenged the Supreme Court would likely rule in favor of expanded executive power or dismiss the case altogether for lack of standing. Erwin Chemerinsky, professor and dean at University of California, Irvine School of Law, has argued that not even in a [...] "dire financial emergency" [...] could the President raise the debt ceiling as [...] "there is no reasonable way to interpret the Constitution that [...] ". Jack Balkin, Knight Professor of Constitutional Law at Yale University, opined that like Congress the President is bound by the Fourteenth Amendment, for otherwise, he could violate any part of the amendment at will. <b>Because</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> must obey the Section 4 requirement not to put the validity of the public debt into question, Balkin argued that President Obama is obliged [...] "to prioritize incoming revenues to pay the public debt: interest on government bonds and any other 'vested' obligations. What falls into the latter category is not entirely clear, but a large number of other government obligations—and certainly payments for future services—would not count and would have to be sacrificed. This might include, for example, Social Security payments." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2016, Kobach {{said that}} there are “interesting things” about the {{question}} of Obama’s citizenship that “just made you scratch your head.” Kobach said that Obama's opposition to Kansas's proof of citizenship requirement law was possibly <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> was not a citizen himself: [...] "maybe that’s why he doesn’t talk about proof of citizenship, because he, you know, he would rather not bring up the citizenship issue." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{press release}} by the {{presidency}} failed to cite {{any reason for}} her dismissal, apparently <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> was not obliged to give any reason for sacking a minister. Madlala-Routledge later revealed {{in a press conference}} that the president had called a meeting asking for her to resign citing the unauthorised trip to an international AIDS conference in Spain but she had declined. The next day she was officially dismissed. Her sacking was criticized by opposition parties and AIDS organisations. The Treatment Action Campaign commented: [...] "This is a dreadful error of judgment that will harm public healthcare." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{leader of}} the church is the President of the Church, and church members regard him as a prophet, seer, and revelator. He is often {{referred}} to by members of the church as [...] "the Prophet" [...] <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> is thought to hold the same divine calling as biblical prophets. The President's responsibility is primarily over the church as a whole. His stewardship also extends to all humanity as Lord's chosen mouthpiece. He is entitled to guide the church through revelation, acting as God's spokesman. The President of the Church serves as such until death. The current president is Thomas S. Monson.|$|E
50|$|Note: President Andrew Johnson {{nominated}} {{the following}} eight {{men to be}} ambassador to Austria, but the Senate rejected or declined to consider them, most likely <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> <b>President’s</b> disputes with <b>the</b> Congress over other issues.|$|R

2500|$|The {{coalition}} also governed {{during the}} term of President Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh. President Ó Dálaigh resigned {{as a result of}} comments made by the Minister of Defence, Paddy Donegan. The Minister had described the President as a [...] "thundering disgrace" [...] <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> had referred the Emergency Powers Act, 1976 to the Supreme Court. Although the Minister issued a belated apology and privately offered to resign, the Taoiseach, Liam Cosgrave refused to remove him from the Cabinet. Ó Dálaigh felt that the refusal to remove the Minister was an affront to his office by the Government and resigned. This controversy damaged the image of the National Coalition severely.|$|E
2500|$|Rutledge {{recommended}} that the executive power should consist of a single person, rather than several, because he felt that one person would feel {{the responsibility of the}} office more acutely. <b>Because</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> {{would not be able to}} defer a decision to another [...] "co-president", Rutledge concluded that a single person would be more likely to make a good choice. Rutledge was largely responsible for denying the Supreme Court the right to give advisory opinions. Being a judge himself, he strongly believed that a judge’s sole purpose was to resolve legal conflicts; he held that a judge should hand down an opinion only when ruling on an actual case. He also thought that the legal community was the higher tier of society.|$|E
2500|$|John Yoo, {{legal advisor}} to the Bush administration, has {{explicitly}} invoked Federalist No. 70 in his support for executive power over foreign policy. Referencing Hamilton, Yoo has claimed that [...] "the centralization of authority in the President is particularly crucial in matters of national defense, war, and foreign policy, where a unitary executive can evaluate threats, consider policy choices, and mobilize national resources with a speed and energy that is far superior to any other branch.” [...] Yoo has also cited Federalist No. 70 in his support of the President’s right to unilaterally conduct operations against terrorists without congressional consent. He claims that this power applies to operations against both individuals and states. At least one scholar has also argued that, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> has the most access to national security information, only the president can know when the War on Terror is over and no longer mandates an expansive executive authority.|$|E

2500|$|The defence stands here solely {{upon the}} {{absolute}} immunity from judicial inquiry {{of every one}} who asserts authority from {{the executive branch of}} the government, however clear it may be made that the executive possessed no such power. Not only no such power is given, but it is absolutely prohibited, both to the executive and the legislative, to deprive any one of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, or to take private property without just compensation. ... No man in this country is so high that he is above the law. No officer of the law may set that law at defiance with impunity. All the officers of the government, from the highest to the lowest, are creatures of the law, and are bound to obey it. It is the only supreme power in our system of government, and every man who by accepting office participates in its functions is only the more strongly bound to submit to that supremacy, and to observe the limitations which it imposes upon the exercise of the authority which it gives. Courts of justice are established, not only to decide upon the controverted rights of the citizens as against each other, but also upon rights in controversy between them and the government; and the docket of this court is crowded with controversies of the latter class. Shall it be said, {{in the face of all}} this, and of the acknowledged right of the judiciary to decide in proper cases, statutes which have been passed by both branches of Congress and approved by the President to be unconstitutional, that the courts cannot give a remedy when the citizen has been deprived of his property by force, his estate seized and converted to the use of the government without lawful authority, without process of law, and without compensation, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> has ordered it and his officers are in possession?
