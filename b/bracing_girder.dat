50|$|The {{fuselage}} was a flat sided, wooden, cross <b>braced</b> <b>girder</b> structure. This {{carried a}} conventional fin and rudder, plus a rectangular tailplane, mounted {{on top of}} the fuselage, with split elevators. There were two cockpits in tandem, with the pilot seated aft. Both types had long, flat sided floats with curved upper and lower surfaces, the latter with a single step. These were attached to the fuselage with a fore and aft pair of inverted W-form struts, the latter leaf sprung. A similar, though smaller and unstepped third float was mounted on long struts beneath the tail, fitted with a water rudder.|$|R

[...] Aft, the cross <b>braced</b> <b>girder</b> had a horizontal upper beam onto which the tailplane was mounted, strut braced from below. Its leading edge was straight and strongly swept; the cropped, parallel chord elevators had a central cut out for rudder movement. The fin was under the tailplane, formed by fabric covering between the last two vertical fuselage fames. Its upright, near rectangular rudder was hinged on the extended, final vertical frame member. The Hols der Teufel landed on a rubber sprung skid which ran from the nose to a little beyond the aft lift struts.|$|R

To north and south, sections of stone arch viaduct cross the tidal mudflats, connecting the central section to the shore, two arches to the north and seven to the south of the main bridge.

500|$|The {{design of}} the bridge differs {{slightly}} from other bridges, which are of live load composite construction. The difference is in the dead load design concept adopted for this bridge and concreting of the side spans done with support provided by the intermediate trestle.

50|$|Following an {{inspection}} in 1992, {{it was reported}} that significant areas <b>braces</b> and <b>girders</b> were subject to erosion. It was noted that the re-encasement of headstocks was deteriorating and the concrete had been poorly compacted. In late 1998 engineering staff from the Main Roads Department noted that the bridge was in need of priority attention. There was also a concern that major flooding could severely damage the bridge. It was not considered economically desirable to repair the existing bridge and preliminary designs of a replacement bridge were initiated. Attention also turned to determining an appropriate management approach for the old bridge.|$|R
50|$|Opened in 1885, the five-span rock-hewn {{limestone}} railway viaduct {{over the}} River Laune has single-arch sections {{to the east}} and to the west with limestone and red brick voussoirs. A three-span section leads to the centre with bow-string cast-iron girders on tapered limestone piers. The Bridge was designed by S.G. Frazier. The three metal spans are each 95ft long, each consisting of pairs of twin cross <b>braced</b> bow-string <b>girders</b> of part N-truss and part latticed members. The piers and bridge abutments are made of local limestone. The bridge was repaired in 1950 and closed in 1960. Renovations in 1993 were made to accommodate its use as footbridge.|$|R
40|$|Tbe study {{consists}} of an experimental and analytical investigation into the lateral buckling behaviour of steel I-section <b>girders</b> <b>braced</b> by continuous or discrete U-frames. Scaled down laboratory tests on twin I-section girders {{have been carried out}} under full instrumentation and are reported. Lateral deflection of the compression flanges and final buckling modes were recorded and the coupling effect of U-frame action is clearly demonstrated. The failure loads obtained were generally higher than the corresponding design values according to BS 5400. Using a large displacement elasto-plastic finite element package, ABAQUS, finite element idealisations of the tests were established and analysed. Good correlation between the experiments and the numerical analyses was reached. Validity of the ABAQUS package was confirmed and first order elements were sufficiently effective for the analysis. This was followed by further investigation of a wider range of I-section girders using ABAQUS. The ultimate bending resistance of the girders obtained from finite element analysis was in general greater than the corresponding design values to BS 5400, particularly so with girders of high slendemess. Thus the present design method is considered to be unduly conservative. The cause of this conservatism in BS 5400 is discussed. The expression for the calculation of effective length of U-frame <b>braced</b> <b>girders</b> was found to be reasonable. Based on the results from ABAQUS and reviews of the limited research directly related to this study, two main parameters in the BS 5400 expression for beam slenderness seem inappropriate for lateral buckling of an I-section girder under U-frame restraint. These are the radius of gyration of the whole girder section and the ratio of overall depth of a girder to mean flange thickness. Instead, radius of gyration of the compression flange together with a contribution from the adjoining web section was found to be more appropriate as also was the web slenderness. In addition, a modification is proposed to the present limiting stress curve for lateral buckling of bare steel I-section girders. Empirically derived factors have been introduced. The general procedures in the existing design method to BS 5400 remain similar, however. ...|$|R

40|$|The work {{deals with}} {{modeling}} methods of frame structures, used in rocket technology. To estimate their inertia, stiffness and strength properties {{it is necessary}} to create its calculation model. Currently, a finite element method is generally used. Various finite elements and combinations thereof may constitute such models. It is obvious that parameters of design under consideration, resulting from calculation, depend on the selected calculation model. To simulate the properties of a longitudinal set of elements (stringers and longerons), as well as <b>braces</b> a <b>girder</b> (beam) idealization is offered, because their transverse dimensions are substantially smaller than the longitudinal ones. The elements of a transverse power set (frames) is a plated arch-shaped construction of variable sections with holes. Weld tubes of different diameters reinforce the holes in plates. There are cutouts in the vertical plates to mount the stringers. It is impossible to take completely into consideration the mentioned features in the frame idealization of bulkheads. Therefore, it seems more appropriate to use plate-frames for modeling the bulkheads.. The paper discusses two possible models of the bulkhead to show their stiffness properties, namely frame and plate. Describes strengths and shortcomings of represented bulkhead design schemes. Based on the test calculations shows which errors may be possible in calculating the strength properties of the bulkhead under consideration when using a frame model. Gives recommendations on the proper use of potential bulkhead models to estimate a general and local strength of the bulkhead structure.

40|$|This report {{documents}} {{a research}} investigation on connection details and bracing layouts for stability bracing of steel bridges with skewed supports. Cross-frames and diaphragms {{play an important}} role in stabilizing steel girders, particularly during construction. The commonly used bent plate connection between skewed <b>braces</b> and steel <b>girders</b> can introduce flexibility that can have detrimental effects on the bracing behavior. An alternative detail investigated in this study is a split pipe stiffener used to connect cross-frames to girders at a skew. The split pipe stiffener allows perpendicular connections to the cross-frame connection tab, regardless of the skew angle. The split pipe provides a stiffer connection between the cross-frame and the girder. More importantly, the split pipe stiffener increases the torsional stiffness of the girder by introducing substantial warping restraint. This increases the lateral torsional buckling capacity of the girder and allows the first line of intermediate cross-frames to be moved farther from the support. Overall, the increase in girder torsional stiffness and buckling capacity that results from the use of the split pipe stiffener will enhance the safety of the girder at all stages of construction: during transportation, lifting, erection, and placement of the concrete deck. This study also examined layout patterns for intermediate cross-frame...|$|R
