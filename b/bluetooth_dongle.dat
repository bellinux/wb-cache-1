40|$|The design, {{integration}} and realization of system in enhanced package approach towards fully functional system level integration {{by using a}} compact <b>Bluetooth</b> USB <b>dongle</b> as the demonstrator is presented here. The integration was done on FR 4 substrates, which is totally compatible with today’s printed circuit board manufacturing capability.

The front end developed here is based on an embedded meander line combline filter and an embedded transformer balun. The filter has a 35 % area reduction when compared with the classical combline filter and similar performance. The balun has the coils distributed on three layers that minimized the board area needed it and optimizes the performances.

40|$|Abstract — Bluetooth {{provides}} a way to connect and exchange information between devices like personal digital assistants (PDAs), mobile phones, laptops, PCs, printers, digital cameras and video game consoles via a secure, globally unlicensed short-range radio frequency for multiple users simultaneously. This technology is developed to free end users to allow people access digital information wirelessly. Main idea {{of this paper is}} to show implementation for providing internet connection in Bluetooth enabled mobile using IGAP. IGAP is the new Bluetooth profile that solves the problem of accessing (browsing) internet in Mobile phone from a Computer having internet connection. With the IGAP a mobile user can access internet without any GPRS or EDGE provided by the telecommunication companies. This implementation has two parts, a client application and a server application. The server application runs in a normal PC with <b>Bluetooth</b> <b>dongle.</b> This PC acts as the gateway to the internet for the mobile. The mobile will host the client application which will connect to the server application in a hotspot environment and provide the mobile with internet access...|$|E
40|$|Public buses play an {{important}} role in public transportation in most parts of the world and it is still the dominant public transportation mode in some regions. Nowadays, as people switch to a mobile lifestyle, they spend significant amount of time on the traveling to work, back and forth. However, not much research has been done on how to provide some on-board service for those commuters in the public bus. This paper presents a Bluetooth-based system which is inexpensive, yet flexible, and scalable to serve commuters in a personalized manner using Bluetooth enabled mobile phones. However, from the Bluetooth specification, one <b>Bluetooth</b> <b>dongle</b> can connect to at most seven other Bluetooth devices. As we expect more than 7 users to use the services provided in the Bluetooth-based system (a full double-deck bus can carry around 100 passengers), we need to work out an effective scheduler to schedule all the private services on the Bluetooth servers in the bus. This paper also describes a scheduling algorithm that exploits the park mode feature of the Bluetooth specification to allow more users to have access to the Bluetooth services on the bus...|$|E

The DM 3730 processor has dual core architecture consisting of ARM and DSP. The whole process involves compilation and configuration of Android Linux kernel, boot loaders (U-boot and X-loader), construction of root file system, development of cross compiler environment and its implementation on to the target board.

50|$|Alongside the {{activity}} trackers, Fitbit offers a website and mobile app for iOS, Android and Windows 10 Mobile. The trackers can be synced to smart devices via Bluetooth or uploaded {{to a computer}} running Windows or macOS using the <b>Bluetooth</b> USB <b>dongle.</b> Users {{have the ability to}} log their food, activities, and weight, to track over time and can set daily and weekly goals for themselves for steps, calories burned and consumed, and distance walked. Calories in versus calories out is more accurately measured when app users keep their tracker on. However, the app can be used without a tracker to measure calories on a lifestyle app. The app offers a community page where users can challenge themselves and compete against other users. The social element anticipates an increase in motivation, finding that users take an average of 700 more steps per day when they have friends on the app. Users can choose to share their progress pictures and achievement badges.|$|R

40|$|Abstract- The {{formation}} of wireless communication has allowed {{many people around}} the world to conduct business in different ways that was never before possible. Millions of cellular subscribers have become accustomed to always having mobile Phones with them wherever they go. Now, today businesses {{want to be able to}} connect to the office when they are out of the office so they can handle their own PC’s in LAN, and data whenever and wherever it is needed. Currently, there are different wireless data services available such as <b>Bluetooth,</b> Infrared <b>Dongle,</b> PC suite, Data cable etc. We are going to develop Technology which act as a one type of bridge between computer device and GPRS mobile network for handling the communication. In this system we are using Windows and Linux as an operating system platform and going to develop a communication between computer device network and GPRS mobile network to control all the activity or operation in Network. By using simple GPRS enable handset available in the market. Clients can perform OS control operations (Like Start Application, Kill Application, Reboot, Shutdown, etc) and File Handling Operations (uploading file, downloading file). Client can access the node in the LAN from anywhere with the help of GPRS enable mobile. We are also providing authentication to client who want to access node of LAN. Basic concept behind this system is to develop a interactive network consisting of static computer, laptop, GPRS enabled mobile etc. We can perform any type of communication means pc-to-pc, pc-to mobile and mobile- to pc also...|$|R
40|$|Nurses may {{experience}} interruptions as double-edged swords as interruptions are essential tools to maintain awareness at the bed area {{while at the}} same time being harmful, disrupting current tasks and challenging cognitive capacity. This thesis seeks to reduce the impact of harmful interruptions by modifying notification of nurse calls using technologies for supporting context-awareness. We use a nurse call prototype, developed on the Android platform, to enable research on the topic. The system has support for sensing the location of nurses by using low energy Bluetooth technology and Raspberry Pis, equipped with <b>Bluetooth</b> andWi-Fi <b>dongles.</b> To create the best possible conditions for user acceptance, this study adopts a user-centered approach and is based on iterative involvement of users (nurses). We conduct an initial study, where six full-time nurses are interviewed to gain a better understanding of context and nurse practices. We use the results of this study to develop a new iteration of the nurse call system, which in turn are evaluated by performing four workshops with seven nurses. The methods of the workshops include role-playing, focus group interviews, and a combination of cognitive walkthrough and think-aloud. Results include how to design, develop and integrate an interruption management system into a nurse call system. Gathering and handling sensor data using smart communication protocols is essential to ensure proper integration of the many system components. State Machines are excellent for ensuring correct and efficient handling of the many system states when modifying notification based on subtle changes in context. Further results include situations where the system can infer context automatically, such as sterile procedures, night shifts, or leaving the department. A combination of location and time sensor data is enough for the system to infer context accurately in most situations. However, some scenarios are prone to incorrect context inferring like, for instance, difficult conversations, or in case of fatalities. We can handle incorrect inferring by providing easily accessible interfaces to enable manual updating of nurse availability statuses...|$|R
