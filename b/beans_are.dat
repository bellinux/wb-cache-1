5|$|The {{technicians}} {{start the}} washing process immediately, since delay can cause fermentation of the sugary coating surrounding the bean and ruination {{of the coffee}} flavour. The <b>beans</b> <b>are</b> first thrown into a deep tank. The best cherries sink {{to the bottom and}} pass through a machine that removes their skin. The technicians remove any floating cherries and process them {{in the same way as}} the others for the cooperative to sell on the domestic market for less than specialty-coffee price. The <b>beans</b> <b>are</b> fed through one of the cooperative's three de-skinning and selection machines to remove their skins and most of the sugary coating before running the individual beans through a vibrating colander. The colander separates the very highest quality Grade A beans from those labeled Grade B; the two grades are sent separately down the hill in a water chute with a 1 percent gradient. This process allows for further separation of beans based on quality, with around 15 tanks available at the bottom for capture of the different types. The <b>beans</b> <b>are</b> kept submerged, two days for the best and 15–20 hours for the lesser beans, which causes a small amount of fermentation to convert the remainder of the sugar without significantly impairing the flavour.|$|E

5|$|Although B. rufimanus {{does not}} {{directly}} affect faba bean yield, it alters the aesthetic quality of the seeds {{as well as its}} germinative properties and ensuing yield is therefore an issue for human consumption and seed markets. A maximum 3% damage threshold is set for seeds targeting market for human consumption. Damaged seeds (seeds from which adults have emerged) might have lower germination rates with 13% reduced germination observed in the lab, but no difference observed in the field. Yield from infested <b>beans</b> <b>are</b> lower (-45% to -70%) than for healthy ones (Epperlein, 1992). In addition, damaged seeds have increased susceptibility to rust and root diseases.|$|E

5|$|Mould fungi are {{the source}} of the meaty (umami) flavour of the soybean {{products}} tempeh, miso and soy sauce. Tempeh has been produced in Java since the 13th century. Like tofu, it is made into protein-rich blocks, but these have a firm texture and earthy flavour, since (unlike tofu) the whole <b>beans</b> <b>are</b> retained, providing a higher content of dietary fibre and vitamins. Miso too is rich in protein, vitamins and minerals. It is fermented from a mixture of soybeans and cereals, forming a soft paste used to flavour soups and other Japanese dishes. Soy sauce has been used in China since the 2nd century AD, and is now widespread in Asia. Like miso, it is made by fermenting a mixture of soybeans and cereals with moulds such as Aspergillus oryzae.|$|E

5|$|A {{computer}} program such as KetoCalculator {{may be used}} to help generate recipes. The meals often have four components: heavy whipping cream, a protein-rich food (typically meat), a fruit or vegetable and a fat such as butter, vegetable oil or mayonnaise. Only low-carbohydrate fruits and vegetables are allowed, which excludes bananas, potatoes, peas and corn. Suitable fruits are divided into two groups based on the amount of carbohydrate they contain, and vegetables are similarly divided into two groups. Foods within each of these four groups may be freely substituted to allow for variation without needing to recalculate portion sizes. For example, cooked broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower and green <b>beans</b> <b>are</b> all equivalent. Fresh, canned or frozen foods are equivalent, but raw and cooked vegetables differ, and processed foods are an additional complication. Parents are required to be precise when measuring food quantities on an electronic scale accurate to 1g. The child must eat the whole meal and cannot have extra portions; any snacks must be incorporated into the meal plan. A small amount of MCT oil {{may be used to}} help with constipation or to increase ketosis.|$|E
5|$|However, modern {{agriculture}} seriously reduces biodiversity. Traditional {{third world}} agriculture that is best at maintaining diversity with multiple cropping systems such aspolyculture(includingcompanion plantingandintercropping) andagroforestrysystems such as shifting cultivation. In Latin America, between 70% and 90% of <b>beans</b> <b>are</b> grown mixed with other {{crops such as}} maize and potatoes. Worldwide, multiple cropping provided up to 20% of all food in 1986. Traditional systems also maintain diversity within a crop species, such as in theAndesmountains where up to 50 varieties of potato are grown.The effects of loss of biodiversity are especially noticeable in pest control. Herbivorous pest insects tend to become more abundant inmonocultures. Stable agroecosystems are biodiverse and contain sufficient numbers of natural enemies of crop pests, such asparasitoidalwasps which are able to controlaphidsandlepidopterancaterpillars. These ecosystems continuously provide food and breeding sites for these beneficial species. Agroecosystems can achieve this equilibrium by arranging a suitable combination of crops in space and time, given the type of soil and surrounding environment; sufficient abundance of non-crop plants in and around fields; and appropriate management of vegetation. Suitable farming strategies include polyculture,crop rotation, mosaics of small scattered fields and uncultivated land. Additional strategies include perennial crops such asorchards(especially if a diverse floral undergrowth is permitted), tolerating specific weed species, and raising genetic diversity such as by planting mixtures of crop varieties.|$|E
