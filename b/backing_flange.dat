50|$|For an {{interchangeable}} lens camera, the flange focal distance (FFD) (also {{known as the}} flange-to-film distance, flange focal depth, <b>flange</b> <b>back</b> distance (FBD), <b>flange</b> focal length (FFL), or register, depending on the usage and source) of a lens mount system is {{the distance from the}} mounting flange (the metal ring on the camera and the rear of the lens) to the film plane. This value is different for different camera systems. The range of this distance which will render an image clearly in focus within all focal lengths is usually measured in hundredths of millimeters and is known as the depth of focus (not {{to be confused with the}} similarly named depth of field).|$|R

40|$|The {{ion source}} for the 1 MW Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) is {{required}} to provide 35 mA of H- beam current at 6 % duty factor (1 ms pulses at 60 Hz) with a normalized rms emittance less than 0. 15 pi mm mrad. The H- beam will be accelerated to 65 keV and matched into a 2. 5 MeV RFQ. The ion source is expected to ultimately produce 70 mA of H- at 6 % duty factor when the SNS is upgraded to 2 MW of power. For this application, a radio-frequency driven, magnetically filtered multicusp source is being developed at Berkeley Lab. The design of this new ion source is directed towards operation at the required high duty factor. Experimental results of the ion source operated in pure volume production mode (without cesium) and in hybrid mode (with cesium released into the source) are compared. An improved cesium dispensing system will be presented. 1 ION SOURCE DESIGN A schematic of the SNS R&D # 1 H- ion source [1] {{is shown in figure}} 1. The ion source is mounted inside a reentrant cylinder to move the ion source into the vacuum vessel. This enhances the vacuum pumping of the extraction gap. The source plasma chamber (10 -cm-long by 10 -cm-diam.) is made out of a copper cylinder with a back plate at one end and an outlet electrode at the other end. The plasma is confined by the longitudinal line-cusp fields produced by 20 rows of water-cooled, samarium-cobalt magnets that surround the source chamber and transverse magnets on the <b>back</b> <b>flange.</b> The hydrogen plasma is produced inductively by up to 65 kW of pulsed 2 MHz RF power. RF coupling is accomplished via a 2 1 / 2 -turn, porcelain-coated (water-cooled copper tubing) antenna connected to a matching network that matches the impedances of RF amplifier an...|$|R
40|$|Rubber forming is {{a common}} process for the {{fabrication}} of flanged metallic parts in the aerospace industry. The process enables cheap tooling, which is important since the product series are limited. In the process a rigid and a soft tool are combined to form a metal blank into the required shape. Most components made in this way are “flanged parts”, i. e. parts with a rather flat web plate and curved flanges at {{the periphery of the}} web plate. For flanged parts the determination of spring <b>back</b> of the <b>flanges,</b> straight or curved, is important, since the forming dies compensated with the spring back, should result in accurate products. Like all metal forming processes elastic and plastic deformations are combined in the same process cycle. The elastic deformations result in spring back and residual stresses, the ratio between these two depends on the shape of the product and the distribution of the plastic and elastic deformations. In this research an aluminium alloy was used. The low Young’s modulus of this alloy results in rather high elastic responses upon deformation. Other aspects that have been evaluated are the effect of processing parameters like friction and distribution of strains. For stretch flanges the strain is distributed evenly along the flange, but not for shrink flanges, where buckling plays a role. Experimental research shows that the spring <b>back</b> of the <b>flanges</b> depend on a number of variables like the thickness, flange geometry, and material parameters. The spring <b>back</b> of a <b>flange</b> is also a mixture of different contributions: spring back due to the bending over the bend line, spring back due to the curvature of the <b>flange,</b> and spring <b>back</b> due to in-plane deformations. The research performed focused on the different components of the spring back and their interaction. Analysis of the data resulted in a new parameter by which a number of variables could be captured. This improves the understanding of the spring back phenomena and a generalization of the results...|$|R

He evidently did not know that there was a leaden coffin, or at any rate, had not thought of it. When he saw the rent in the lead, the blood rushed to his face for an instant, but as quickly fell away again, so that he remained of a ghastly whiteness. He was still silent. Van Helsing forced <b>back</b> the leaden <b>flange,</b> and we all looked in and recoiled.|$|R
40|$|Finite element and {{photoelastic}} {{methods of}} stress analysis have been wed {{to study the}} effects of pressure loading on the behaviour of swivel ring flanges. The use of recesses on the <b>back</b> faces of <b>flanges,</b> to control the load position, were investigated. The effect of the friction conditions between the flange and ring were also considered. It was found that the inclusion of a recess can significantly reduce the highest stresses, which occur in the flange/hub fillet radius. The friction conditions between the flange and ring were also found to {{have a significant effect on}} the stresses. ...|$|R
50|$|In socket-mounting, the {{aperture}} {{in the front}} face of the flange matches the inside dimensions of the waveguide. At the back, {{the aperture}} is rabbeted to form a socket which fits onto {{the end of the}} waveguide tubing. The two pieces are soldered or brazed together to ensure an uninterrupted conducting path between the inside surface of the waveguide tube and the mouth of the flange. This type of construction can be seen in figure 2, and is shown diagramatically in figure 3. A variation on this is butt-mounting, in which the waveguide tube abuts the back face of the <b>flange.</b> The <b>back</b> of the <b>flange</b> has a number of protrusions, sufficient to align the tube, but without forming an unbroken socket-wall around it.|$|R
50|$|A basic DOF adapter {{usually has}} four {{components:}} a macro lens, an optional plano-convex lens, a translucent focusing screen, {{and finally a}} photographic lens of the user's choice. On camcorders without sufficient macro capability, a macro lens, preferably an achromatic doublet (to minimize chromatic aberration), is usually attached directly to the camcorder so that the camcorder can zoom in {{and focus on the}} focusing screen. Without the macro lens, certain camcorders would be unable to zoom in well enough to frame the entire focusing screen and still achieve sharp focus. The optional plano-convex lens is used to avoid vignetting in the image. The focusing screen is where the photographic lens image is projected. The screen must be placed at precisely the correct distance from the flange focal mount of whatever lens is being used (most popularly the Canon FD or Nikon F mount), referred to as the <b>flange</b> <b>back</b> distance. Finally, the front lens is a photographic or cinema lens that projects the image desired onto the focusing screen.|$|R
40|$|Extensive {{damage to}} steel moment {{connections}} {{has been reported}} since the 1994 Northridge earthquake. While low-toughness welds and notch-like discontinuities created by the bottom <b>flange</b> <b>backing</b> bars {{have been identified as}} primary causes of the fractures that occurred, other factors have also been linked to the failures. Column stiffening design practices, resulting in the design of weak panel zones and a lack of or insufficient use of continuity plates, have been speculated as potential contributors to the fractures. The concern associated with the role of column stiffener detailing in the Northridge damage has subsequently led to a tendency towards over-conservatism in stiffener design. However, the additional expense of larger stiffeners coupled with the potential for fabrication cracking due to larger, highly restrained welds required to attach such stiffeners is an undesirable consequence of this increased conservatism. To study these column stiffener design issues, a research project was launched to reassess the AISC design criteria related to the limit states of Local Flange Bending (LFB), Local Web Yielding (LWY), and Panel Zone (PZ) strength, and to develop new...|$|R
5000|$|Clark has {{had three}} trucks over the years. His first truck was a late 80's blue and silver Chevrolet Silverado that had five ton {{military}} axle housings, Rockwell PS250 planetaries, and 46 offroad shock absorbers. Clark ran this truck till 1988. His second truck was a {{pink and white}} 1989 Chevrolet Silverado with a 144" [...] wheelbase with an extended front clip. Deciding his axles were good {{after two years of}} use, he used him on his new truck. After a rollover due to a drag race with Wild Hair to the pits at Dallas stadium in 1990, Clark decided to rebuild the truck and repaint the body all pink with silver stripes and a horse on the door. This truck was called Clydesdale 3 for this reason. At its first race, Clark was racing at Louisville Motor Speedway. In the first round, racing No Problem, Clark had a rough landing over the set of cars, causing the left rear wheel to come off and ruin his brand new body. John Moore was interviewed and was worried because {{he was the one that}} welded that <b>flange</b> <b>back</b> on after the same thing happened in Chicago, Illinois the previous year. Clark ran this truck until 1998, when he completed his current truck, Clydesdale 4. His newest truck is his best truck yet, a 2002 Chevrolet Silverado with Knight Stalker shocks. This truck has Clark 20 ton planetaries, F-106 axle housings and features a $6500 paint job. This truck also runs as Taurus at certain events. His second truck now runs as Johnny Rocket #7 monster truck.|$|R
40|$|If {{the contact}} between the wheel and rail occurs at the flange, {{a high degree of}} slip is inherent. This can result in {{excessive}} wear and the potential for rolling contact fatigue cracking. Multi-body dynamics software is useful for predicting the bogie and track characteristics that may lead to flange contact occuring. However, {{there is a shortage of}} experimental tools available to validate such models or to assist in vehicle and track condition monitoring. In this study, the feasibility of a new approach is investigated. The method is based on an ultrasonic sensor mounted on the wheel. The concept is that the sensor emits an ultrasonic pulse which is designed to impinge on the wheel flange. If there is no contact the pulse is fully reflected <b>back</b> at the <b>flange</b> and picked up by the same sensor. If flange contact takes place, a proportion of the pulse amplitude will be transmitted into the rail. The signal reflected back to the sensor is therefore reduced. The amount by which this signal reduces indicates how much flange contact occurs. Test specimens were cut from sections of wheel and rail, and a 2 MHz ultrasonic contact transducer was bonded onto the wheel in a position best suited to detect the flange contact. The specimens were pressed to together in a bi-axial loading frame to generate differing degrees of head and flange contact. The reflected signal was monitored as the normal and lateral loads were varied. It proved possible not only to detect the onset of flanging, but also to record a signal that varied monotonically with both normal and lateral applied load. A map of reflected ultrasound against the applied loading is presented...|$|R
40|$|Wheel/rail {{contact is}} {{critical}} to the successful operation of a railway network. Contact occurs at the wheel tread/rail head and wheel flange/rail gauge corner. Contact conditions are more severe in the latter, which occurs mainly at curves. The contact is small and supports large loads; therefore, high contact stresses are generated. These, combined with the slip in the contact, are primarily responsible for driving the processes that lead to wheel and rail damage, whether by deformation, wear or a fatigue process. Multi-body dynamics software is useful for predicting the wheel/rail contact characteristics; however, {{there is a shortage of}} experimental tools available. In this study, the feasibility of an approach based on an ultrasonic sensor mounted on the wheel is investigated. The sensor emits an ultrasonic pulse which is designed to impinge on the wheel flange. If there is no contact the pulse is fully reflected <b>back</b> at the <b>flange</b> and picked up by the same sensor. If flange contact takes place, a proportion of the pulse amplitude will be transmitted into the rail. The signal reflected back to the sensor is therefore reduced. The amount by which this signal reduces indicates how much flange contact has occurred. This work had two aspects. First, a standard ultrasonic ray-tracing software package was used to establish what it is possible to measure with sensors mounted in the wheel and to determine the best location and orientation. The second aspect was an experimental study to determine whether such measurements are feasible. Test specimens were cut from sections of wheel and rail, and a 2 [*]MHz ultrasonic contact transducer was bonded onto the wheel in a position best suited to detect the flange contact. The specimens were pressed together in a bi-axial loading frame to generate differing degrees of rail head and flange contact.

It proved possible not only to detect the onset of flanging, but also to record a signal that varied monotonically with both normal and lateral applied load. A map of reflected ultrasound against the applied loading is presented. The technology, while not currently suitable for full field implementation could be very useful in laboratory studies on, for example, a full-scale wheel/rail rig...|$|R
