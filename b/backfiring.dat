5|$|As the {{aircraft}} flew eastwards over the outer suburbs of Perth numerous witnesses observed {{that it was}} flying at a lower altitude than usual for the daily Skymaster services, {{and at least one}} of the engines was running roughly and <b>backfiring</b> at regular intervals. In the minutes before it crashed, witnesses heard a number of different engine noises – sometimes operating normally, sometimes all engine noise ceased, only to be replaced by a very loud, high-pitched scream. When the wrecked engines were examined many weeks after the accident a significant amount of corrosion product was found in the fuel system within two of the engines. After a preliminary investigation, Investigators from the Department of Civil Aviation believed the water responsible for the corrosion was also responsible for rough running of at least one engine, and ultimately temporary loss of power from all engines on at least one occasion. The Investigators did not find a likely source for the water.|$|E

In Bad Boys Love, it is revealed that Hatoful is set in a post-apocalyptic, dystopian future—in which a pandemic of a deadly, mutated strain of the H5N1 virus, or bird flu, nearly wipes out mankind in the year 2068. The release of a counter-virus, cultivated to destroy the virus' avian carriers {{in a desperate attempt to}} stop the spread of the disease, ends up <b>backfiring</b> as birds who resisted the counter-virus instead developed human-level intelligence. War soon breaks out between the newly uplifted birds and the remnants of humanity, resulting in birds emerging as the planet's new dominant lifeforms as humans continued to succumb to the disease. Following several terrorist attacks by a human insurgency, all remaining humans have been forced to live in the wilderness away from civilization in a form of apartheid-like segregation.|$|E

5|$|The most {{prominent}} rivalry {{heading into the}} pay-per-view was between then-WWF Champion Diesel and his storyline rival Sid. At the previous pay-per-view, WrestleMania XI, Diesel defeated Shawn Michaels to retain the WWF Championship, partly due to an interference by Michaels' bodyguard Sid <b>backfiring.</b> The following night, Michaels stated that for a potential rematch, he would give Sid the night off, causing the bodyguard to turn on Michaels by powerbombing him three times. Diesel eventually came out to help Michaels. Michaels was legitimately injured, and this sidelined him for six weeks, effectively shelving plans for a rematch between Diesel and Michaels. Diesel was then scheduled to defend his title against Bam Bam Bigelow, {{a member of the}} Million Dollar Corporation stable, after a staged confrontation between the two on the April 16, 1995 episode of Action Zone, a secondary television program for the WWF. On the same day, on Wrestling Challenge, another secondary television program, in a segment featuring the Corporation, Bigelow was noticeably snubbed, signaling a turn. Over the weekend of April 16, a match between Sid and Diesel was scheduled for In Your House, in which Sid could potentially face Diesel for the WWF Championship, depending on whether he retained or lost his title against Bigelow. On the April 24 episode of Raw, Sid stated he was unhappy about this stipulation, as it meant that if Bigelow won, Sid would not get a shot at the title. Diesel retained the title when the Corporation turned on Bigelow, with Tatanka tripping Bigelow as he ran off the ropes. Diesel hit Bigelow with a big boot and executed a powerbomb for the win. After the contest, Bigelow was insulted by Ted DiBiase and attacked by the Corporation. Diesel, who had gone back to the locker room, came to Bigelow's aid. In Sid's match with Razor Ramon on the May 1 episode of Raw, Diesel approached the ring ready to fight Sid, who, along with the Corporation's manager DiBiase, left the arena abruptly. The following week on Raw, DiBiase revealed that he and Sid had been working together for a while, admitting that it was him who told Shawn Michaels to get a bodyguard.|$|E

40|$|Legal {{discussions of}} {{defamation}} commonly focus on defamation law, with relative neglect of struggles {{that take place}} over defamation matters. To understand defamation struggles, we introduce <b>backfire</b> theory: if something is perceived as unjust and information about it is communicated to relevant audiences, {{it has the potential}} to <b>backfire</b> against those held responsible. Defamation suits have the potential to <b>backfire</b> when they are seen as oppressive or contrary to free speech. There are several types of actions by plaintiffs that can inhibit this <b>backfire</b> effect, including cover-up, devaluation of the defendant, reinterpretation and intimidation. To illustrate the value of <b>backfire</b> analysis of defamation struggles, we examine four Australian examples, involving author Avon Lovell, politician Robert Askin, solicitor John Marsden and Aboriginal leader Geoff Clark, and the British example of McDonalds suit against two activists. Participants in these struggles see the matters in terms of reputation and free speech; <b>backfire</b> analysis allows an observer to put tactics used by participants in a coherent framework...|$|R

40|$|Censorship can <b>backfire</b> {{because it}} is usually viewed as a {{violation}} of the right to free expression, which is widely valued as an ideal; under the Charter of the United Nations, freedom of expression is a universal human right. <b>Backfire</b> occurs, for example, when censorious attacks on a film or book cultivate increased demand for the forbidden work rather than restrict access to it. Censors can inhibit this <b>backfire</b> effect in various ways, including covering up the censorship, devaluing the target, reinterpreting the action, using official channels, and using intimidation and bribery. These five methods to inhibit <b>backfire</b> from attacks on free speech are illustrated by a variety of cases, including attacks that <b>backfired</b> and ones that did not. This analysis provides guidance for effectively opposing attacks on free expression...|$|R

40|$|This Article {{focuses on}} legal <b>backfire</b> claims. A claim of legal <b>backfire</b> {{constitutes}} {{the position that}} a law produces or will produce results directly contrary {{to one or more}} of those intended. Legal <b>backfire</b> claims are pervasive, yet potentially misleading and harmful argumentation used primarily to undermine existing law (or policy) or to forestall the enactment of new law. This Article analyzes many examples of legal <b>backfire</b> to suggest that the concept is often a rhetorical strategy for opposing the promulgation of new law or policy or for attempting to have existing law rolled back, and that actual legal <b>backfires</b> are more rare (or at least unproven) than the use of the rhetoric would suggest. This Article also addresses a much more basic problem: the challenges to effective lawmaking and the limitations of techniques to evaluate the effects of law make an accurate assessment of law problematic. Ultimately, this Article suggests that lawmakers should proceed with caution when dealing with legal <b>backfire</b> claims because critics of laws almost invariably author these claims, the claims are rhetorically charged, and the claims themselves are extraordinary...|$|R

25|$|This shot, though risky in the execution, has the {{advantage}} of being aimed at a section of the field where a fielder is rarely placed – particularly in Twenty20 and One Day International cricket where the number of outfielders is limited. However the Marillier shot is played over the batsman's shoulder to fine leg, but the basis of the scoop stroke is for the batsman to go down on one knee to a good length or slightly short-of-length delivery off a fast or medium paced bowler and scoop the ball over the head of the wicket-keeper. The scoop shot is a risky shot to play as the improper execution of this shot may lead to a catch being offered. One famous example of the scoop <b>backfiring</b> is of the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 Final when Pakistan were 152/9 and needed 6 runs off 4 balls and Misbah-ul-Haq improperly executed this shot resulting in a catch to Sreesanth.|$|E
25|$|Not {{long after}} he joins the Legion, Superboy's life is {{threatened}} when a Green Kryptonite meteor falls to Earth, but his life is saved by a Smallville farm boy named Lex Luthor, {{who also happens to}} be a science prodigy. The two boys become fast friends, and Superboy builds Lex a fully stocked laboratory to allow him to conduct his experiments. Lex uses the lab to search for a cure for Superboy's weakness to Kryptonite. Just after Lex discovers the cure, a fire breaks out in his lab. When Superboy puts out the fire, the antidote is destroyed, along with a protoplasmic life form that Lex created, and Lex also loses all his hair. Lex blames Superboy for destroying his experiment and his hair loss, accusing the Boy of Steel of jealousy over his brilliance. Lex swears that he will prove to the world that he is superior to Superboy. Lex does this by trying to implement a series of scientific quality-of-life improvements for Smallville's residents; however, each invention of Lex's winds up <b>backfiring,</b> requiring Superboy to intervene. This series of setbacks results in Lex dedicating his life to destroying Superboy. In the years that follow, Lex becomes Superboy's (and then Superman's) archfoe. Superboy soon acquires a small rogues gallery of recurring villains, including Lex.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} 3 D {{numerical}} simulations of two fires fronts (head and <b>backfire)</b> propagating simultaneously through a grassland fuel. The simulations {{were carried out}} using a "fully" physical and three-dimensional fire model (namely WFDS). One of the objectives of this work, was to evaluate the potential for fully physical fire model to simulate the interactions between two fire fronts (a head fire and a <b>backfire),</b> in conditions similar to those encountered during suppression fire operations. A set of numerical simulations was first carried out for standalone head fires propagating through grasslands on a flat terrain and for various wind conditions ranging between 1 and 10 m/s. These results were compared with experimental data and numerical results from the literature. The same calculations were then repeated, with a <b>backfire</b> ignited at the downwind side of the plot. The numerical results highlighted that, for these particular conditions, head fire and <b>backfire</b> can interact, mainly, via two mechanisms: - at relatively large distances (greater than 10 m) the head fire acts on <b>backfire</b> as a screen and reduces the direct action of the wind flow on the <b>backfire,</b> - at relative small distances (nearly equal to 10 m) the gas flow (entrainment) generated {{in the vicinity of}} the head fire promotes the aspiration of the <b>backfire</b> towards the main fire front...|$|R

40|$|Abstract [...] Short <b>backfire</b> antennas {{have been}} {{developed}} with single impedance bandwidth characteristics. In this paper, a new cross dipole excitation structure for short <b>backfire</b> antenna is presented that achieves dual impedance band width characteristics. The cross dipole excitation structure consists of H-shaped and straight cross dipoles. The cross dipole structure is mounted on the slotted coaxial line. The antenna is developed on elliptical ground plane with dielectric rim. A cost effective design is proposed to get metallic rim from the dielectric rim. The pertinent features of this short <b>backfire</b> antenna are (i) dual impedance band width (ii) reconfigurable circular polarization (iii) cost effective fabrication. It is demonstrated that this short <b>backfire</b> antenna can achieve voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) bandwidths of 21 % and 20. 36 % for 2 : 1 VSWR, axial ratio of 1. 8 dB with axial ratio (≤ 3 dB) bandwidth of 1. 94 % and a gain of 12 dBi.
