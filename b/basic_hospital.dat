25|$|During the {{austerity}} period, {{the aim of}} the Socialists {{was limited}} to that of safeguarding the position of beneficiaries as far as possible and of giving special consideration to the poorest amongst them. While further increases in benefits for the elderly, the handicapped, and in some family allowances later became possible, extra costs were also imposed. For instance, the duration of unemployment benefits was reduced, while a <b>basic</b> <b>hospital</b> charge (with exemptions) was introduced, and contributions from the early retired and unemployed towards health care were demanded although, once again, the worse off were exempt. Austerity measures also led to efforts to restrain family costs {{while at the same time}} trying to safeguard priority groups. In February 1982, a 25% increase was made in allowances for families containing two eligible children, but some benefits were abandoned and the starting and finishing dates for eligibility altered. Later, cash increases were less than the amounts necessary to maintain the real value of family benefits except for the poorest groups in French society. The limits on income assessed for social insurance contributions were raised and the income base upon which employers and the self-employed were assessed for contributions was changed. The cost of support for handicapped adults was transferred to the national government, although some taxation on tobacco and alcohol was also earmarked for this purpose. A 1% tax on personal incomes was imposed (although the poorest 33% of taxpayers was excluded), and a 1% “solidarity” contribution levied on civil servants towards the cost of unemployment insurance. In spite of austerity, however, the real value of social protection made modest increases. Within the total, the greatest benefits was reserved for the poorest whilst income was raised in ways which saw a modest shift from traditional financing methods towards general community financing.|$|E

40|$|Provides {{consumers}} with useful information about {{private health insurance}} {{that will allow them}} to choose the policy that best meets their needs. Summary One of the fundamental reasons people purchase health insurance is to provide ‘peace of mind’. There are thousands of products available for you to choose from. Compare them in detail and think carefully before shopping for price alone. The general rule is that the cheaper the premium, the less the policy will cover. Cheap policies may contain a number of important exclusions for common procedures (hips and knees) or higher out of pocket expenses and smaller rebates. Private health insurance is categorised into four levels of cover. • Top Private Hospital Cover - must cover all services where Medicare pays a benefit. • Medium Private Hospital Cover - excludes or restricts one or more of the following but includes any services in the basic classification: pregnancy and birth-related services, assisted reproductive services, cataract and eye lens procedures, joint replacements i. e. shoulder, knee, hip and elbow including revisions, hip and knee replacements, hip replacements, dialysis for chronic renal failure, and sterilisation. • <b>Basic</b> Private <b>Hospital</b> Cover - excludes or restricts one or more of the following: cardiac and cardiac related services, non-cosmetic plastic surgery, rehabilitation, psychiatric services, and palliative care. • Public Hospital Cover - covers minimum benefits for treatment in public hospital only. Public hospital waiting lists still apply. The premiums for policies in the Top Cover category are more expensive than premiums for policies in the other categories. The AMA recommends that all policy holders carefully read any information their insurer sends them about their policy. People with policies in the Medium or <b>Basic</b> private <b>hospital</b> category generally need to pay more attention to their private health insurance, as terms and conditions (exclusions and rebates) can change at any time during the policy. You will have to upgrade your policy if you want to be covered for any services that are removed or not included in these policies. The following table lists the names of the insurers’ policies under the Top, Medium, <b>Basic</b> Private <b>Hospital,</b> and Public Hospital categories. This will allow you to easily identify the level of cover you are being provided and if your policy is likely to change...|$|R
