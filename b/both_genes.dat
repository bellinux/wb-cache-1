5|$|Although the {{structures}} of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are very different, at least some functions are interrelated. The proteins made by <b>both</b> <b>genes</b> are essential for repairing damaged DNA (see Figure of recombinational repair steps). BRCA2 binds the single strand DNA and directly interacts with the recombinase RAD51 to stimulate strand invasion a vital step of homologous recombination. The localization of RAD51 to the DNA double-strand break requires the formation of BRCA1-PALB2-BRCA2 complex. PALB2 (Partner and localizer of BRCA2) can function synergistically with a BRCA2 chimera (termed piccolo, or piBRCA2) to further promote strand invasion. These breaks {{can be caused by}} natural and medical radiation or other environmental exposures, but also occur when chromosomes exchange genetic material during a special type of cell division that creates sperm and eggs (meiosis). Double strand breaks are also generated during repair of DNA cross links. By repairing DNA, these proteins play a role in maintaining the stability of the human genome and prevent dangerous gene rearrangements that can lead to hematologic and other cancers.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, {{two studies}} further pinpointed the {{responsible}} region to chromosome 11 and a 4.5-Mb covering chromosomal rearrangement. The scientists {{were able to}} show that the first genetic change happened 3.8 million years ago on the resident chromosome, when a part of it broke off and was reintroduced in the wrong direction. This inversion created the faeder allele. About 500,000 years ago another rare recombination event of faeder and resident allele in the very same inverted region lead to the satellite allele. The 4.5 Mb inversion covers 90 genes, {{one of them is the}} centromere coding gene N- CENPN-, which is located exactly at one of the inversion breakpoints. The inactivation of the gene has severe deleterious effects and pedigree data of a captive ruff colony suggests that the inversion is homozygous lethal. Over the course of the past 3.8 million years, further mutations have accumulated within the inversion i.e. three deletions ranging from 3.3 to 17.6 kb. Two of these deletions remove evolutionary highly conserved elements close to two genes- HSD17B2 and SDR42E1-both holding important roles in metabolism of steroid hormones. Hormone measurements around mating time showed that whereas residents have a sharp increase of testosterone, faeders and satellites only experience higher androstenedione levels, a substance which is considered an intermediate in testosterone biosynthesis. The authors conclude that one or more of the deletions act as a cis-acting regulatory mutation which is altering the expression of one or <b>both</b> <b>genes</b> and eventually contributes to the different male phenotypes and behaviour.|$|E

5|$|Several {{studies have}} focused on changes of anthropometrical (body weight, BMI, WHR,…) or {{biochemical}} parameters (mostly plasma lipid levels) {{as a result of the}} interactions between common APOA5 variants and dietary habits (polyunsaturated fatty acid intake, n-3 and n-6 fatty acid intake, total fat and total energy intake, alcohol intake), dietary (lowering the energy intake) and/or physical activity interventions or dyslipidaemic (using statins or fenofibrate) treatment. Due to the high heterogeneity of the examined populations, differences in protocol and/or interventions used, the studies are difficult to directly compare and draw definitive conclusions. However, with caution, it could be concluded that carriers of the minor C-1131, Trp19, or T553 alleles are in some cases less prone to the positive effects of environmental and/or pharmacological interventions. Some papers suggest the importance of the interactions between APOA5 and other genes, especially with common APOE (OMIM acc. No. 107741) three allelic (E2, E3, and E4) polymorphism, in the modulation of plasma lipids. In these cases, the interaction between minor alleles of <b>both</b> <b>genes</b> seems to be of importance. In the general population, APOE4 seems to have the potential to diminish the effect of minor APOA5 rs662799 and rs3135506 alleles, especially in females. Interaction between APOE and APOA5 Ser19˃Trp has been suggested to play some role in the development of type III hyperlipidaemia. Further studies, in which interaction with APOA5 has been described, have included, for example, variants within FTO, lipoprotein lipase, USF-1 and FEN-1. They have also focused not only on plasma lipids, but on BMI values or hypertension as well.|$|E

40|$|Hemolysins {{produced}} by Vibrio anguillarum have {{been implicated in}} the development of hemorrhagic septicemia during vibrio-sis, a fatal fish disease. Previously, two hemolysin gene clusters responsible for the hemolysis and cytotoxicity of V. anguillarum were identified: the vah 1 -plp gene cluster and the rtxACHBDE gene cluster. In this study, we identified the hns gene, which en-codes the H-NS protein and acts as a negative regulator of <b>both</b> <b>gene</b> clusters. The V. anguillarumH-NS protein shares strong homology with other bacterial H-NS proteins. An hnsmutant exhibited increased hemolytic activity and cytotoxicity compared to the wild-type strain. Complementation of the hnsmutation restored hemolytic activity and cytotoxicity levels to nearly wild-type levels. Furthermore, expression of rtxA, rtxH, rtxB, vah 1, and plp increased in the hnsmutant and decreased in the hns-complemented mutant strain compared to expression in the wild-type strain. Additionally, experiments using DNase I showed that purified recombinant H-NS protected multiple sites in the promoter regions of <b>both</b> <b>gene</b> clusters. The hnsmutant also ex-hibited significantly attenuated virulence against rainbow trout. Complementation of the hnsmutation restored virulence to wild-type levels, suggesting that H-NS regulates many genes that affect fitness and virulence. Previously, we showed that HlyU is a positive regulator of expression for <b>both</b> <b>gene</b> clusters. In this study, we demonstrate that upregulation by hlyU is hns depen-dent, suggesting that H-NS acts to repress or silence <b>both</b> <b>gene</b> clusters and HlyU acts to relieve that repression or silencing.

25|$|Other {{diseases}} {{are influenced by}} genetics, but the genes a person gets from their parents only change their risk of getting a disease. Most of these {{diseases are}} inherited in a complex way, with either multiple genes involved, or coming from <b>both</b> <b>genes</b> and the environment. As an example, {{the risk of breast}} cancer is 50 times higher in the families most at risk, compared to the families least at risk. This variation is probably due to a large number of alleles, each changing the risk a little bit. Several of the genes have been identified, such as BRCA1 and BRCA2, but not all of them. However, although some of the risk is genetic, the risk of this cancer is also increased by being overweight, drinking a lot of alcohol and not exercising. A woman's risk of breast cancer therefore comes from a large number of alleles interacting with her environment, so it is very hard to predict.|$|E

25|$|All {{researched}} psychological {{traits are}} influenced by <b>both</b> <b>genes</b> and environment, to varying degrees. These two sources of influence are often confounded in observational research of individuals or families. An example is the transmission of depression from a depressed mother to her offspring. Theory may hold that the offspring, by virtue of having a depressed mother {{in his or her}} (the offspring's) environment, is at risk for developing depression. However, risk for depression is also influenced to some extent by genes. The mother may both carry genes that contribute to her depression but will also have passed those genes on to her offspring thus increasing the offspring's risk for depression. Genes and environment in this simple transmission model are completely confounded. Experimental and quasi-experimental behavioral genetic research uses genetic methodologies to disentangle this confound and understand the nature and origins of individual differences in behavior. Traditionally this research has been conducted using twin studies and adoption studies, two designs where genetic and environmental influences can be partially un-confounded. More recently, the availability of microarray molecular genetic or genome sequencing technologies allows researchers to measure participant DNA variation directly, and test whether individual genetic variants within genes are associated with psychological traits and psychopathology through methods including genome-wide association studies. One goal of such research is similar to that in positional cloning and its success in Huntington's: once a causal gene is discovered biological research can be conducted to understand how that gene influences the phenotype. One major result of genetic association studies is the general finding that psychological traits and psychopathology, as well as complex medical diseases, are highly polygenic, where a large number (on the order of hundreds to thousands) of genetic variants, each of small effect, contribute to individual differences in the behavioral trait or propensity to the disorder. Active research continues to understand the genetic and environmental bases of behavior and their interaction.|$|E
