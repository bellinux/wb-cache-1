5000|$|Three-piece (or [...] "open-throat") {{boots were}} first {{developed}} by Mel Dalebout (around 1969), who introduced a rigid magnesium <b>boot</b> <b>shell</b> {{in that year}} (Brixia {{did the same thing}} with their aluminum shell at around the same time). The big advantage was that the main shell was a single piece that was convex at all points, meaning it could be easily produced using a plug mould. Conventional boots with overlapping flaps required more complex moulding processes. Engineers at Henke, Heierling, Sanmarco and Caber saw the advantage for high-speed moulding, and plastic three-piece boots were on the market by 1972, when Roland Collombin won the Olympic downhill in the Henke Strato.|$|E
25|$|In 1981, {{a couple}} of Winterstick team riders went to France at the {{invitation}} of Alain Gaimard, marketing director at Les Arcs. After seeing an early film of this event, French skiers/surfers Augustin Coppey, Olivier Lehaneur, Olivier Roland and Antoine Yarmola made their first successful attempts during the winter of 1983 in France (Val Thorens), using primitive, home-made clones of the Winterstick. Starting with pure powder, skateboard-shaped wooden-boards equipped with aluminium fins, foot-straps and leashes, their technology evolved within a few years to pressed wood/fiber composite boards fitted with polyethylene soles, steel edges and modified ski <b>boot</b> <b>shells.</b> These were more suitable for the mixed conditions encountered while snowboarding mainly off-piste, but having to get back to ski lifts on packed snow.|$|R

In the scene, he escapes Soviet agents who are on skis. The snowboard he used was from the debris of a snowmobile that exploded.|$|R
5000|$|Operating systems {{which are}} {{essential}} collections of software that manage resources and provides common services for other software that runs [...] "on top" [...] of them. Supervisory programs, <b>boot</b> loaders, <b>shells</b> and window systems are core parts of operating systems. In practice, an operating system comes bundled with additional software (including application software) {{so that a}} user can potentially do some work with a computer that only has one operating system.|$|R
5000|$|The buffer or {{jacket on}} patchcords is often {{color-coded}} {{to indicate the}} type of fiber used. The strain relief [...] "boot" [...] that protects the fiber from bending at a connector is color-coded to indicate the type of connection. Connectors with a plastic shell (such as SC connectors) typically use a color-coded shell. Standard color codings for jackets and <b>boots</b> (or connector <b>shells)</b> are shown below: ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{lays out}} {{different}} issues and solutions {{in the design}} of an operating system with an inbuilt kernel memory for data storage and USB (Universal Serial Bus) drive with bootstrap loader. This relates from the minimum features required for a program to become the kernel and how this kernel should be written into the boot sector of a hard disk drive depend upon the machine architecture, so that it gets loaded into the computer memory automatically and it restores the disk drive in to its original state. It highlights how this operating system can be made to support user specific authentication, keyboard, networking, peripherals, file system access etc. Most of the frequently used drivers are added to the kernel images. This also lays out the specifications for a shell to issue system commands and system utilities, interfacing FAT (File Allocation Table) file system for smooth boot of an operating system and how to communicate with another similar system using hardware device.
