5|$|At the CFM Mortuary, {{the family}} will view and {{identify}} {{the body of the}} deceased {{in the presence of a}} coroner, who reviews the case and determines if an autopsy is required. The family will be informed of the coroner's decision and the time to claim the body for the funeral. If an autopsy is conducted and reveals that the death is unnatural, the police will conduct further investigations into the cause of death with the family's assistance. Once the investigations are complete, {{the family will}} <b>be</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> attend a coroner's inquiry at the Subordinate Courts. Only after that will they be able to claim the body.|$|E

50|$|Ilmarinen is {{instructed}} on how {{to treat}} his bride. He <b>is</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> allow her freedoms and not unnecessarily cause her sadness and weeping. He <b>is</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> not treat her like a slave or servant and to allow her total roam of the house. Ilmarinen is instructed never to speak with contempt at her, and treat her equally. He <b>is</b> <b>told</b> never <b>to</b> whip her like a slave or animal and not allow his family to chastise her, he <b>is</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> only whip her if she is continually disobedient and never {{to do it in}} the presence of others so as to not cause her humiliation.|$|R

25|$|In quota sampling, the {{population}} is first segmented into mutually exclusive sub-groups, just as in stratified sampling. Then judgement is used to select the subjects or units from each segment based on a specified proportion. For example, an interviewer may <b>be</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> sample 200 females and 300 males between the age of 45 and 60.|$|E
25|$|The {{state of}} the art in sensory {{intelligence}} for robots will have to progress through several orders of magnitude if we want the robots working in our homes to go beyond vacuum-cleaning the floors. If robots are to work effectively in homes and other non-industrial environments, the way they are instructed to perform their jobs, and especially how they will <b>be</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> stop will be of critical importance. The people who interact with them may have little or no training in robotics, and so any interface will need to be extremely intuitive. Science fiction authors also typically assume that robots will eventually be capable of communicating with humans through speech, gestures, and facial expressions, rather than a command-line interface. Although speech would be the most natural way for the human to communicate, it is unnatural for the robot. It will probably {{be a long time before}} robots interact as naturally as the fictional C-3PO, or Data of Star Trek, Next Generation.|$|E
25|$|It {{must surely}} have a deplorable effect upon our Allies {{to be told}} by an ex-Cabinet Minister that the Palestine Administration do not like Jews, {{and that there are}} enough anti-Semites in Great Britain to back up the Hitler policy and spirit. This {{suggestion}} is a complete reversal of the truth. If a comparison is to be made with the Nazis, it is surely those who wish to force an imported régime upon the Arab population who are guilty of the spirit of aggression and domination. Lord Wedgwood's proposal that Arabs should be subjugated by force to a Jewish régime is inconsistent with the Atlantic Charter, and that ought to <b>be</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> America. The second principle of that Charter lays down that the United States and ourselves desire to see no territorial changes that do not accord with the freely expressed wishes of the peoples concerned; and the third principle lays down that they respect the right of all peoples to choose the form of Government under which they will live.|$|E

So, indeed, was the whole Roman Government. Every man knew his place, and knew his work.

500|$|Commanding Hewie is an {{integral}} part of Haunting Grounds gameplay. At the beginning of the game, he won't be completely friendly and obey all of Fiona's commands. The player will have to build a friendship and gain his trust in order to survive the game. Hewie can <b>be</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> sniff out items, check suspicious areas or items, attack an enemy, or called back to Fiona's side. The player can praise Hewie by petting and feeding him, both which can heal his vitality. Likewise, he can be scolded when he won't listen to commands.

500|$|Obama {{concluded}} the second paragraph of his address by saying, [...] "we {{the people have}} remained faithfultothe ideals of our forebears and true to our founding documents." [...] The speech reinforced words such as [...] "legacy" [...] and [...] "heritage", as well as values such as [...] "honesty", [...] "courage" [...] and [...] "patriotism", which [...] "are old" [...] values. Near {{the end of the}} speech, Obama referred to words written by Thomas Paine in The American Crisis, which were ordered by George Washington to be read to his troops: [...] "Let it <b>be</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> the future world... that in the depth of winter, when nothing but hope and virtue could survive... that the city and the country, alarmed at one common danger, came forth to meet [...]" [...] Because Obama's campaign message focused on the need for change, Mackin noted that Obama sought to reassure Americans that he would operate as President within the margins of the nation's traditions.|$|E
500|$|At 4:30pm Pacific Time, Nixon, Chotiner, and Rogers were {{discussing}} where {{the public should}} <b>be</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> send their responses to the speech, when a Dewey aide telephoned for Nixon. Reluctantly, suspecting {{the reason for the}} call, Chotiner brought Nixon to the phone to speak with the New York governor. Dewey told Nixon that Eisenhower's aides were unanimous that Nixon must resign, though Dewey did not agree, and that Nixon was to so state {{at the end of his}} telecast. Nixon asked what the general wanted him to do. Dewey hedged, stating that he had not spoken with the presidential candidate himself, but that the word had come from such close aides to Eisenhower that the demand had to represent the general's view. The candidate replied that it was very late for him to change his remarks; Dewey assured him he need not do so, but simply add at the end his resignation from the ticket and his insistence that Eisenhower accept it. The governor suggested he even announce his resignation from the Senate and his intent to run in the special election which would follow—the two-time losing presidential candidate was sure Nixon would be returned with a huge majority, thus vindicating him. Nixon remained silent for some time, and when Dewey asked him what he would do, the senator told him that he did not know, and if Eisenhower's aides wanted to find out, they could watch just like everyone else. Before slamming down the receiver, Nixon added, [...] "And tell them I know something about politics, too!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Within the paradigm, acts of sexism are {{commonly}} employed to validate and rationalize normative misogynistic practices; for instance, sexist jokes may <b>be</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> foster disrespect {{for women and}} an accompanying disregard for their well-being, which ultimately make their rape and abuse seem [...] "acceptable". Examples of behaviors said to typify rape culture include victim blaming, trivializing prison rape, and sexual objectification.|$|E
2500|$|An {{assessment}} by Major David Talbot Rice of MI3b in September 1943 {{confirmed that}} there had only been isolated anti-German activity by Mihailović and [...] "the heroes of the hour are undoubtedly the Partisans". He recommended that Mihailović should <b>be</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> destroy German lines of communication in Serbia, otherwise Tito would be the sole recipient of British aid which they were at long last {{in a position to}} deliver. The Signals intelligence had completely changed the view of Talbot Rice and MI3b in six months.|$|E
2500|$|It {{is common}} {{practice}} to release software with known, low-priority bugs. Most big software projects maintain two lists of [...] "known bugs" [...] – those {{known to the}} software team, and those to <b>be</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> users. The second list informs users about bugs that are not fixed in a specific release and workarounds may be offered. Releases are of different kinds. Bugs of sufficiently high priority may warrant a special release of part of the code containing only modules with those fixes. These are known as patches. Most releases include a mixture of behavior changes and multiple bug fixes. Releases that emphasize bug fixes are known as maintenance releases. Releases that emphasize feature additions/changes are known as major releases and often have names to distinguish the new features from the old.|$|E

2500|$|The Epworth Sleepiness Scale {{is a brief}} {{questionnaire}} that is administered to determine {{the likelihood of the}} presence of a sleep disorder, including narcolepsy. For the multiple sleep latency test, a person is given a chance to sleep every 2hours during normal wake times. [...] The patient is taken in usually for an overnight sleep study. The following day the patient will have multiple tests where they will <b>be</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> nap after a full nights sleep (usually eight hours). Observations are made of the time taken to reach various stages of sleep (sleep onset latency). This test measures the degree of daytime sleepiness and also detects how soon REM sleep begins. Again, people with narcolepsy fall asleep rapidly and enter REM sleep early. Occasionally, a multiple sleep latency test can result in a false-negative for a narcoleptic.|$|E
2500|$|Pope Gregory I in his Pastoral Care (c. 600), which {{remained}} a popular text for centuries, wrote [...] "Slaves should <b>be</b> <b>told</b> ... <b>to</b> despise their masters and recognise {{they are only}} slaves". [...] In his Commentary on the Book of Job he wrote that [...] "All men are equal by nature but .... a hidden dispensation by providence has arranged a hierarchy of merit and rulership, in that differences between classes of men have arisen {{as a result of}} sin and are ordained by divine justice". He directed slaves to be employed by the monasteries as well as forbidding the unrestricted allowance of slaves joining the monastery to escape their servitude. Upon manumitting two slaves held by the Church, he wrote:However, the papal estates alone continued to possess several hundred slaves despite Gregory's lofty rhetoric on the natural liberty of mankind.|$|E
2500|$|Aside {{from the}} use of herbs and divination, the Santería {{traditional}} healing is achieved through rituals that include animal sacrifice, offerings, altar building, music, dance, and possession trance. When the patient is a child, the Santero uses the curative system known as santiguo, which means [...] "to heal by blessing". Perceiving health problems, most Santeros recommend that the client seeks a medical doctor. Parallel to the medical treatment, the patient might be prescribed some herbal teas, cleansing baths, or a special diet from the traditional healing practice. Sometimes, a Santero might advise a client to receive omiero, whose efficacy is widely disputed by many in the medical community. An omiero is claimed by believers to be a sacred mixture that is made for specific Santería ceremonies and to embody the orichá ruler of herbs, Osaín. [...] Most clients who see Santeros would never <b>be</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> drink it.|$|E

From August to September 2013, she became a judge on the televised dancing show, Stepping Out, alongside choreographers Wayne Sleep and Jason Gardiner. That month, Brown released her first single in eight years, [...] "For Once in My Life", from her untitled and unreleased third studio album. The single peaked at No.2 on the [...] Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs charts. In 2014 she appeared on The Big Fat Quiz of the Year, during the taping she had to <b>be</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> settle down by producers.

2500|$|On May 9, 1975, the Church Committee {{decided to}} call acting CIA {{director}} William Colby. That same day Ford's top advisers (Henry Kissinger, Donald Rumsfeld, Philip W.

[...] But the Church Committee had full authority to call a hearing and require Colby's testimony. Ford and his top advisers met with Colby to prepare him for the hearing. Colby testified, [...] "These last two months have placed American intelligence in danger. The almost hysterical excitement surrounding any news story mentioning CIA or referring even to a perfectly legitimate activity of CIA has raised a question whether secret intelligence operations can be conducted by the United States." ...|$|E
2500|$|With {{only minor}} {{variations}} ... the standard pattern for sorting new arrivals [...] Men {{and women were}} segregated on the spot {{as soon as the}} trucks had rolled to a halt in the base's large central courtyard or parade ground. The process was brutal ... A little later, the men were further divided by age, small children were kept with their mothers, and the elderly and infirm were shunted off to separate quarters. Men and teenage boys considered to be of an age to use a weapon were herded together. Roughly speaking, this meant males of between fifteen and fifty, but there was no rigorous check of identity documents, and strict chronological age seems to have been less of a criterion than size and appearance. A strapping twelve-year-old might fail to make the cut; an undersized sixteen-year-old might <b>be</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> remain with his female relatives. ... It was then time to process the younger males. They were split into smaller groups. ... Once duly registered, the prisoners were hustled into large rooms, or halls, each filled with the residents of a single area. ... Although the conditions at Topzawa were appalling for everyone, the most grossly overcrowded quarter seem to have been those where the male detainees were held. ...
