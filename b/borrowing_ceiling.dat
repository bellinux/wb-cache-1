40|$|This paper {{shows that}} optimal {{consumption}} is weakly increasing in the <b>borrowing</b> <b>ceiling,</b> while savings and the welfare losses caused by borrowing constraints are weakly decreasing. More important, the strict inequalities may hold even at high saving levels {{at which the}} constraints {{are not expected to}} bind any time soon. In essence, the paper shows that one can make a smooth transition between the two extremes of free and no borrowing. Further, quantitative versions of the theory demonstrate that the distortive impact of borrowing constraints depends upon all the parameters of the economic environment in a complicated way.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{implications}} of current account deficit upon the external debt increase in Romania, revealing higher risks for the sustainability of its international financial position. Considering the trade deficit as a main cause of current account balance deterioration, several exports weaknesses are pointed out, mostly resulted from neglecting both slowing IPT flows and growing FDI stock adverse effects. Under the circumstances of diminishing contribution of compensatory flows to the current account deficit coverage, an increasing share of autonomous flows is expected. But an excessive rise in the long-term external debt, including its service level, could have negative effects on Romania’s country rating, i. e. on the external financing costs and <b>borrowing</b> <b>ceiling</b> of the international capital markets. For preventing a possible financial turmoil turning into a “hard landing” of the economy the Romanian, firstly by admitting the risks occurring from current account deficits and accelerated debt accumulation, by sound monetary and fiscal policies, promoting structural reform and exports.

40|$|This {{research}} {{reflects on}} the debt management problem in Zimbabwe. Like any other country Zimbabwe has a Constitutional legal framework that touches on debt management. The major issue at hand is why Zimbabwe is failing to sustain its external debt stock whilst it has a Constitutional legal framework that focuses on debt management. The study hypothesized that inadequacy of the Constitutional legal frameworks has led to unsustainable debt. The research utilized purposive and snowball sampling in selecting the key respondents. Data was gathered through document study, questionnaires and interviews. Questionnaires were administered to key respondents {{and in some cases}} interviews were concurrently held. Though the Constitutional legal frameworks provide for the institutional set up to undertake debt management and provide for the legality of loan contraction, the research revealed that the Constitutional legal frameworks are inadequate in other matters relating to debt management. Research findings demonstrated that the Constitutional legal frameworks do not specify the loan contraction process, void on external <b>borrowing</b> <b>ceiling</b> and does not clearly provide for the circumstances under which borrowing is permissible and makes loan contraction exclusive. It is in light of these lacunas that the recommendations were premised on. The study promotes the strengthening of Constitutional legal frameworks relating to debt management...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{patterns}} of optimal tax rates and borrowing in a developing country characterized by a costly tax collection. Its access to the international credit market {{is determined by the}} efficiency of the tax system, the relative bargaining power of creditors, and the outstanding debt. Country risk modifies considerably the pattern of taxes and borrowing in recessions. The tax rate exhibits strong counter-cyclical patterns in economies operating close to the credit ceiling, whereas the tax rate exhibits very few cyclical patterns in economies operating on the elastic portion of the supply of credit, where country risk factors are absent. <b>Borrowing</b> Constraints, Credit <b>Ceilings,</b> Optimal Tax,...|$|R
5000|$|The Republican Party, {{which had}} retaken the House of Representatives the prior year, {{demanded that the}} President {{negotiate}} over deficit reduction in exchange {{for an increase in}} the debt ceiling, the statutory maximum of money the Treasury is allowed to <b>borrow.</b> The debt <b>ceiling</b> had routinely been raised in the past without partisan debate and without any additional terms or conditions. This reflects the fact that the debt ceiling does not prescribe the amount of spending, but only ensures that the government can pay for the spending to which it has already committed itself. Some use the analogy of an individual [...] "paying their bills." ...|$|R
50|$|Named {{after its}} location, {{the church was}} built 1823-1849 to replace a minor wooden church on Blasieholmen {{destroyed}} in the devastating fire of 1822. Inaugurated by King Charles XIV John and still officially carrying his name, it was designed by the architect Fredrik Blom as a neoclassical octahedral temple inspired by the Pantheon in Rome, <b>borrowing</b> the coffered <b>ceiling</b> while substituting the oculus for the temple-shaped lantern light. On all sides, the plain white walls restored in 1998 are pierced by portals whose four pillars support semi-circular lunettes. Inside the cruciform exterior, the interior sheet of the wooden double cupola is supported by paired doric columns and rounded arches. Accompanying the painted altarpiece are niches with statues of the apostles and two plaster groups.|$|R
50|$|The United States {{debt ceiling}} or debt limit is a {{legislative}} {{limit on the}} amount of national debt that can be issued by the US Treasury, thus limiting how much money the federal government may <b>borrow.</b> The debt <b>ceiling</b> is an aggregate figure which applies to the gross debt, which includes debt {{in the hands of the}} public and in intra-government accounts. (About 0.5% of debt is not covered by the ceiling.) Because expenditures are authorized by separate legislation, the debt ceiling does not directly limit government deficits. In effect, it can only restrain the Treasury from paying for expenditures and other financial obligations after the limit has been reached, but which have already been approved (in the budget) and appropriated.|$|R
40|$|In {{the late}} 1980 s Barbados, Guyana, Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago found {{themselves}} in severe economic difficulties. Their ensuing economic strategies were all market-based, featured fiscal contraction and trade liberalization, multilateral support loans and, later on, tax and financial sector reforms. However, exchange rate, monetary and public sector wage policies varied greatly. Choice of exchange rate regime was not as fundamental to successful stabilization as was fiscal action, complemented by, but without undue reliance on, monetary policy. The policies employed to reduce debt and to diversify the economic bases also help t lessen vulnerabilities to future economic shocks.

The political transition process has advanced significantly in 2005, and further {{progress has been made}} in securing peace. Burundi’s external debt is unsustainable even after the full use of traditional debt relief mechanisms. Burundi will thus require substantial debt relief under the enhanced HIPC Initiative as described in the decision point document.
