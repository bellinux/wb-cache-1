30|$|Xap is a seed-borne {{pathogen}} with an epiphytic symptomless {{population and}} is able to go through a long epiphytic phase on bean plants (Beattie and Lindow 1995). In general, the epiphytic population of Xap in the field has two major parts; solitary cells (potentially planktonic) and biofilms. Using ERIC fingerprinting, it has been shown for Xap that strains in the two fractions of the population are genetically identical (Jacques et al. 2005). A similar result has been demonstrated for strains of plant-associated Pseudomonas fluorescens (Boureau et al. 2004). Biofilms which are present on the surfaces of leaves are similar to those in aquatic ecosystems and hospital environments and they include a large aggregation of bacterial cells embedded in polymeric materials like extracellular polysaccharides. Comprehensive reviews on biofilm formation by plant-associated bacteria were published by Danhorn and Fuqua (2007) and Morris and Monier (2003). Among the bacteria which can form biofilms, one which is closest to Xap, is X. campestris pv. campestris {{in which there is a}} cell to cell signalling procedure. This system is coded by rpf genes cluster, which were previously known as an important cluster in the pathogenicity of bacterium (Crossman and Dow 2004). These genes have a role in production of diffusible factors like <b>butyrolactones.</b> The most well-known chemical in biofilm formation in many bacteria is called Acyl Homoserine Lactones (AHL), but it has not been found in the genus Xanthomonas; even though this molecule has an important role in biofilm formation of another bean bacterial pathogen; Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae which has the same ecological cycle as the causal agent of CBB (Cha et al. 1998; Crossman and Dow 2004; Dow et al. 2003). Instead of AHL, <b>butyrolactones</b> may act as signal molecules in quorum-sensing-like systems in Xanthomonas (von Bodman et al. 2003; Jacques et al. 2005). Regarding Xap, AHL has not been found in the bacterium population; however, <b>butyrolactones</b> have been confirmed to have a role in biofilm formation (Jacques et al. 2005).|$|R

It is demonstrated that the site selectivity can be extended from 1, 4 - to 1, 6 -additions for the enantioselective vinylogous additions of methyl-substituted vinylogous lactones to enals and 2, 4 -dienals. This novel reactivity is demonstrated for methyl-substituted olefinic azlactones and <b>butyrolactones.</b> Their synthetic potential is first highlighted {{by the development of}} the organocatalytic regioselective vinylogous 1, 4 -addition to enals which proceeds with a very high level of double-bond geometry control and excellent enantioselectivity.
