5|$|However, the ABC {{received}} more than 250complaints, outweighing the 177 positive submissions. A spokesperson for the national broadcaster said that the results were misleading <b>because</b> <b>people</b> who enjoyed the show typically do not make comments. Around the country, around 80% of callers to talkback radio were supportive; and one third of all calls regarding APEC mentioned the stunt.|$|E

50|$|However, {{it is hard}} to {{actually}} prove why ascriptive inequality occurs because motive based theories cannot be empirically tested <b>because</b> <b>people’s</b> motives cannot be observed. Motive based theories attribute these motives as across-the-board explanations to all members of an ascriptive group, and thus excludes analyses that take advantage of the explanatory power of deviation among allocators.|$|R
50|$|Physical {{manifestations of}} prehistoric {{beliefs and values}} through the {{organisation}} of spaces and ritual areas provide insight into beliefs and practices. Huffman argues that this is possible <b>because</b> <b>peoples</b> divide their spaces into specific areas reserved for various activities. These spaces shape cultural relationships. For Huffman this is evidenced {{and supported by the}} study of ethnographic data.|$|R
5|$|After reigning two years, Amon {{was assassinated}} by his servants, who conspired against him, and was succeeded {{by his son}} Josiah, {{who at the time}} was eight years old. After Amon's {{assassination}} his murderers became unpopular with the people, and were ultimately killed. Some scholars, such as Abraham Malamat, assert that Amon was assassinated <b>because</b> <b>people</b> disliked the heavy influence that Assyria, an age-old enemy of Judah responsible for the destruction of the Kingdom of Israel, had upon him.|$|E
5|$|Almost all the shrines are nondescript small {{rectangular}} buildings {{without any}} ornamentation. There is no representative of deities adorning {{the outside of}} the buildings. This is in contrast to any other Hindu temple in Sri Lanka or India. Almost all shrines are built of stone except that one dedicated to Valli which shows timber construction. They have been left as originally constructed and there are not any plans to improve upon them, <b>because</b> <b>people</b> are reluctant to tamper with the original shrine complex.|$|E
5|$|More of the {{octagonal}} $50 {{pieces were}} sold {{than of the}} round, as the former proved more popular because of the association with the Gold Rush, and <b>because</b> <b>people</b> liked the dolphins. As half of the 3,000 authorized mintage for the $50 pieces were of each variety, this meant more of the round ones would be melted, leaving the round $50 with the lowest distribution of any U.S. commemorative coin, about 483—the runner up being the octagonal with about 645, though sources vary on the exact numbers distributed.|$|E

5|$|Related to the {{argument}} from morality is {{the argument}} from conscience, associated with eighteenth-century bishop Joseph Butler and nineteenth-century cardinal John Henry Newman. Newman proposed that the conscience, as well as giving moral guidance, provides evidence of objective moral truths which must be supported by the divine. He argued that emotivism is an inadequate explanation of the human experience of morality <b>because</b> <b>people</b> avoid acting immorally, even when it might be in their interests. Newman proposed that, to explain the conscience, God must exist.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{states that}} zinc damages nerve receptors in the nose, causing anosmia. Reports of anosmia were also {{observed}} in the 1930s when zinc preparations were used in a failed attempt to prevent polio infections. On June 16, 2009, the FDA ordered removal of zinc-based intranasal cold products from store shelves. The FDA said the loss of smell can be life-threatening <b>because</b> <b>people</b> with impaired smell cannot detect leaking gas or smoke, and cannot tell if food has spoiled before they eat it.|$|E
5|$|Tuition is {{paid for}} by general {{taxation}} in Germany, although only 27% of young people gain higher education qualification there, whereas in the UK the comparable figure is 48%. Fully or partly funding universities from general taxation has been criticised by the Liberal Democrat party as a 'tax cut {{for the rich and}} a tax rise for the poor' <b>because</b> <b>people</b> would be taxed to pay for something that many would not derive a benefit from, while graduates generally earn more due to their qualifications and only have to pay them back.|$|E
40|$|Much {{commentary}} on the EP elections has followed the line that the European Parliament somehow has less democratic legitimacy because the participation rate is low, and that these elections are taken less seriously <b>because</b> <b>people’s</b> trust in the EU institutions {{in general and the}} European Parliament in particular is low.

5|$|A 2001 {{article in}} the Star Tribune noted that Plato's Closet in 2001 stocked up on brand names like Abercrombie & Fitch, Gap Inc., Silver Jeans Co., Sean John, Express, Inc., and Dr. Martens that they sold at a {{markdown}} of between 50% and 75%. Unlike consignment shops, Plato's Closet pays sellers on the spot. Used clothes are purchased at between 30% and 40% of what Plato's Closet intends to sell them at. According to a 2002 article in Winston-Salem Journal, Winmark spent around $67,000 for each television advertisement for Plato's Closet. In a 2009 interview with Star Tribune, CEO John Morgan said Plato's Closet did the best during the Great Recession among Winmark's franchises <b>because</b> <b>people</b> {{were more likely to}} sell used clothing to make money and to buy used clothing to save money.|$|E
5|$|Romney {{sought to}} bring near-universal health {{insurance}} coverage to the state. This came after Staples founder Tom Stemberg told him {{at the start of}} his term that doing so would be the best way he could help people. Another factor was that the federal government, owing to the rules of Medicaid funding, threatened to cut $385million in those payments to Massachusetts if the state did not reduce the number of uninsured recipients of health care services. Although the idea of universal health insurance had not come to the fore during the campaign, Romney decided that <b>because</b> <b>people</b> without insurance still received expensive health care, the money spent by the state for such care could be better used to subsidize insurance for the poor.|$|E
5|$|The Orkneyinga Saga {{states that}} King William called upon the King of Mann, Ragnald Guthredsson, {{to fight against}} Harald. Rognvald had {{possibly}} spuriously claims to Harald's lands, <b>because</b> <b>people</b> remembered that Harald's mother was younger daughter of earl Haakon Paulsson, whereas the elder daughter had married the king of Isle of Man (although Ragnald's father Godfrey of Man had been that lady's stepson and not her own son). Harald, however, retook Caithness at this time. In this campaign, dated to 1201, the Saga tells that Harald came to the stronghold of Bishop John of Caithness, at Scrabster. Bishop John went to meet Harald, apparently to greet him, but the Earl had him seized, tortured and mutilated. The Gesta Annalia reports that Harald tormented Bishop John in this way because he believed that John was an informant set on making trouble between Harald and King William.|$|E
