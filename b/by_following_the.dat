5|$|A 2004 study {{into the}} effect of The Daily Show on viewers' attitudes found that {{participants}} had a more negative opinion of both President Bush and then Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry. Participants also expressed more cynical views of the electoral system and news media. Political scientists Jody Baumgartner and Jonathan Morris, who conducted the study, state {{that it is not}} clear how such cynicism would affect the political behavior of the show's viewers. While disillusionment and negative perceptions of the presidential candidates could discourage watchers from voting, Baumgartner and Morris say it is also possible that discontent could prompt greater involvement and that <b>by</b> <b>following</b> <b>the</b> show, viewers may potentially become more engaged and informed voters, with a broader political knowledge.|$|E
5|$|A route {{popular with}} {{experienced}} hillwalkers starts at Torlundy, {{a few miles}} north-east of Fort William on the A82 road, and follows the path alongside the Allt a' Mhuilinn. It can also be reached from Glen Nevis <b>by</b> <b>following</b> <b>the</b> Pony Track as far as Lochan Meall an t-Suidhe, then descending slightly to the CIC Hut. The route then ascends Càrn Mòr Dearg and continues along the Càrn Mòr Dearg Arête ("CMD Arête") before climbing steeply to the summit of Ben Nevis. This route involves a total of 1,500 metres of ascent and requires modest scrambling ability and a head for heights. In common with other approaches {{on this side of}} the mountain, it has the advantage of giving an extensive view of the cliffs of the north face, which are hidden from the Pony Track.|$|E
5|$|Ashe and {{the party}} journey to Pharos tower, the {{location}} of the Sun-cryst, where she decides not to take her revenge <b>by</b> <b>following</b> <b>the</b> Occuria's wishes, but instead destroy the Sun-cryst. The party defeats Gabranth, who reveals that he killed King Raminas, and then the party also defeats Cid, before destroying the crystal. The group later learns from Al-Cid that the Dalmascan Resistance, led by Ondore, is about to fight Archadia in Rabanastre, but the Archadian forces now include the Sky Fortress Bahamut, powered by the Mist released by the destruction of the Sun-Cryst. They infiltrate the Bahamut, and find Larsa attempting to dissuade his brother Vayne from his plans for war to no avail. They defeat Vayne and Venat, and Ashe and Larsa announce the end of the conflict to the battlefield. Larsa becomes the Archadian emperor and Ashe the Queen of Dalmasca; Basch replaces his brother Gabranth as Larsa's protector; Vaan and Penelo fly an airship to meet Balthier and Fran for another adventure.|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} Devonian, land plants had {{stabilized}} freshwater habitats, allowing the first wetland ecosystems to develop, with increasingly complex food webs that afforded new opportunities. Freshwater habitats {{were not the}} only places to find water filled with organic matter and dense vegetation near the water's edge. Swampy habitats like shallow wetlands, coastal lagoons and large brackish river deltas also existed at this time, and there is much to suggest that {{this is the kind of}} environment in which the tetrapods evolved. Early fossil tetrapods have been found in marine sediments, and because fossils of primitive tetrapods in general are found scattered all around the world, they must have spread <b>by</b> <b>following</b> <b>the</b> coastal lines — they could not have lived in freshwater only.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{forces were}} first quantitatively {{investigated}} in conditions of static equilibrium where several forces canceled each other out. Such experiments demonstrate the crucial properties that forces are additive vector quantities: they have magnitude and direction. When two forces act {{on a point}} particle, the resulting force, the resultant (also called the net force), can be determined <b>by</b> <b>following</b> <b>the</b> parallelogram rule of vector addition: the addition of two vectors represented by sides of a parallelogram, gives an equivalent resultant vector that is equal in magnitude and direction to the transversal of the parallelogram. The magnitude of the resultant varies from the difference of the magnitudes of the two forces to their sum, depending on the angle between their lines of action. However, if the forces are acting on an extended body, their respective lines of application must also be specified in order to account for their effects on {{the motion of the}} body.|$|E
5|$|In 1911, Pound {{introduced}} {{two other}} poets to the Eiffel Tower group: his former fiancée Hilda Doolittle (who had started signing her work H.D.) and {{her future husband}} Richard Aldington. These two were interested in exploring Greek poetic models, especially Sappho, an interest that Pound shared. The compression of expression that they achieved <b>by</b> <b>following</b> <b>the</b> Greek example complemented the proto-Imagist interest in Japanese poetry, and, in 1912, during a meeting {{with them in the}} British Museum tea room, Pound told H.D. and Aldington that they were Imagistes and even appended the signature H.D. Imagiste to some poems they were discussing.|$|E

5|$|Kim {{solidified}} his {{break with}} cinematic realism <b>by</b> <b>following</b> <b>The</b> Housemaid {{with two more}} films exploring styles and mixing genres, radically new for Korean cinema at the time. The Sea Knows (1961) transcended {{its roots in the}} standard anti-Japanese World War II film to become a distinctive examination of humanity, sadism, greed, lust for power and sexuality. The box-office success of this film enabled Kim to buy his first house, in the Namsan district of Seoul. Goryeojang (1963), dealt with a similar subject matter as The Ballad of Narayama (1983), directed by Shohei Imamura, a filmmaker with whom Kim has often been compared. Kim's version of the story is marked by his mixing of genres. For example, he frames the storywhich deals with an ancient tradition in which elders were abandoned to diewithin a modern lecture on birth control.|$|E
5|$|Kinetic models {{describe}} the particle velocity distribution function at each {{point in the}} plasma and therefore {{do not need to}} assume a Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution. A kinetic description is often necessary for collisionless plasmas. There are two common approaches to kinetic description of a plasma. One is based on representing the smoothed distribution function on a grid in velocity and position. The other, known as the particle-in-cell (PIC) technique, includes kinetic information <b>by</b> <b>following</b> <b>the</b> trajectories {{of a large number of}} individual particles. Kinetic models are generally more computationally intensive than fluid models. The Vlasov equation may be used to {{describe the}} dynamics of a system of charged particles interacting with an electromagnetic field.|$|E

The highway continues southeast along the Snoqualmie River, passing Fall City Airport and crossing Tokul Creek via a long hairpin turn. SR202 passes Snoqualmie Falls, enters a roundabout at Tokul Road, and travels south across the Snoqualmie River towards downtown Snoqualmie. From Snoqualmie, it travels southeast through the Three Forks lowlands and crosses the South Fork Snoqualmie River into North Bend. The highway turns southwest onto Bendigo Boulevard and travels through the city's downtown, exiting via a crossing of the South Fork Snoqualmie River. SR202 passes the North Bend Premium Outlets mall and intersects I-90, where it terminates at a partial dumbbell interchange.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} of the Piast state {{can be traced to}} some degree <b>by</b> <b>following</b> <b>the</b> disappearance of the old tribal gords, many of them built in Greater Poland during the later part of the 9th century and soon thereafter, which were destroyed by the advancing Gniezno tribal population. The gords in Spławie, Września County and in Daleszyn, Gostyń County, for example, both built soon after 899, were attacked and taken over by the Piast state forces, the first one burned during the initial period of the armed expansion. The old gords were often rebuilt or replaced beginning in {{the first decades of the}} 10th century by new, large and massively reinforced Piast gords. Connected by water communication lines, the powerful gords of the mid-10th century served as the main concentrations of forces of the emerging state.|$|E
