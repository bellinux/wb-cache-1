5|$|The Siege of Malakand was the 26 July – 2 August 1897 {{siege of}} the British {{garrison}} in the Malakand region of colonial British India's North West Frontier Province. The British faced {{a force of}} Pashtun tribesmen whose tribal lands had been bisected by the Durand Line, the 1,519 mile (2,445km) border between Afghanistan and British India drawn {{up at the end}} of the Anglo-Afghan wars to help hold <b>back</b> <b>what</b> the British feared to be the Russian Empire's spread of influence towards the Indian subcontinent.|$|E

A childhood friend of Abbas named Ganj Ali Khan was then appointed as the governor of city, which he would govern until his death in 1624/5.|$|E

25|$|On {{his return}} from campaigns in Greece, the general Sulla brought <b>back</b> <b>what</b> is {{probably}} the most well-known element of the early imperial period, the mosaic, a decoration made of colourful chips of stone inserted into cement.

The ability of the Jinn to travel to the heavens and listen to the discussion of angels and bring <b>back</b> <b>what</b> they overhear and relay it to seers and oracles has linked them with magic (Quran 72:8-10).|$|E

In 1931 Philby invited Charles Richard Crane to Jeddah to facilitate exploration of the kingdom's subsoil oil. Crane was accompanied by noted historian George Antonius, who acted as translator.|$|E

25|$|The Imperial Diet of the Holy Roman Empire {{declared}} war on France on 11 February 1689, beginning a unified imperial war effort. The Germans prepared to take <b>back</b> <b>what</b> they had lost, and in 1689 formed three armies along the Rhine. The smallest of these, initially under the Elector of Bavaria, protected the upper Rhine between the lines north of Strasbourg to the Black Forest. On the middle Rhine stood the largest army under the best Imperial general, and commander-in-chief, Charles V, Duke of Lorraine. Charles V cleared away the French threat on Frankfurt and opened trenches around Mainz on 22/23 July. After a bloody two months siege the Marquis of Huxelles finally yielded the town on 8 September. Meanwhile, on the lower Rhine stood the Elector of Brandenburg who, aided by the celebrated Dutch engineer Menno van Coehoorn, besieged Kaiserswerth. Kaiserswerth fell on 26 June before the Elector led his army on Bonn, which, having endured a heavy bombardment, finally capitulated on 10 October. The invasion of the Rhineland had united the German princes in their opposition to Louis XIV who had lost {{more than he had}} gained that year along the Rhine. The campaign had also created a diversion of French forces and sufficient time for William of Orange to invade England.|$|E

After hearing of Leaf's retirement, Rodney Harrison, {{one of his most}} outspoken critics on the Chargers, said, [...] "He took the money and ran.

500|$|Professor Cuthbert Calculus (Professeur Tryphon Tournesol in Hergé's {{original}} version; tournesol is the French {{word for}} sunflower) is an absent-minded and partially-deaf physicist {{and a regular}} character alongside Tintin, Snowy, and Captain Haddock. He was introduced in Red Rackham's Treasure, and based partially on , a Swiss physicist. The leading characters do not initially welcome his presence, but through his generous nature and his scientific ability, he develops a lasting bond with them. Eventually, {{by the end of}} Land of Black Gold, he becomes a resident of Marlinspike Hall. Normally mild-mannered and dignified, Calculus occasionally loses his temper and acts in a spectacularly aggressive manner in response to actual or perceived insults, such as when Captain Haddock belittles his work or accuses him of [...] "acting the goat". He is a fervent believer in dowsing, and carries a pendulum for that purpose. Calculus's deafness is a frequent source of humour, as he repeats <b>back</b> <b>what</b> he thinks he has heard, usually in the most unlikely words possible. He does not admit to being near-deaf and insists he is only [...] "a little hard of hearing in one ear." ...|$|E
500|$|In Buddhist {{texts and}} practice, giving is {{considered}} the easiest of the three bases of merit. It helps to overcome selfishness and stills the mind; it prepares the mind {{for the practice of}} virtue. It is also considered a form of saving, considering there is a rebirth in which people receive <b>back</b> <b>what</b> they have given. As for virtue, this comprises three out of eight aspects of the eight-fold path, the path central in the Buddhist teaching: right speech, right action and right livelihood. Being the main criterion for moral behavior in Buddhism, virtue is mostly about the undertaking of five precepts, although the eight precepts may be kept now and then. The five precepts are part of many Buddhist ceremonies, and are also considered a merit itself, helping the practitioner to become strong and healthy. The benefits of practicing the three bases of merits are also summarized as three forms of happiness (...) —happiness as a human being, happiness in heaven, and happiness in Nirvana. When people die, what world they will be reborn into depends on how intense they practice these three bases of merit. It is, however, only mental development that can take someone to the highest heavenly worlds, or to Nirvana.|$|E
500|$|Vernon {{recorded}} his lines {{in a separate}} recording studio {{than most of the}} album. Vernon described the studio as a [...] "tiny black room". He would record a line in the room, and then shortly later West would come in and play <b>back</b> <b>what</b> was recorded, and then discuss what needed to be changed. They repeated that process a few times until the song was finished. Vernon expressed a positive opinion of working with West, and though he called West demanding in some ways, he appreciated West's enthusiasm for music and the creativity produced by the recording sessions. The song was recorded around the death of Michael Jackson and the event had an effect of the recording crew of the song, and certain aspects of the song are influences by personal events that affected West throughout the years. In an interview with MTV, West said that the song was going to be last featured on the album, and commented that [...] "emotionally it just fit the crescendo of everything that I was saying and what I wanted to say to this girl. And it's also my favorite eight bars that I've ever written in my life. I think it's one of the greatest pieces of writing." ...|$|E
