5|$|At this point, both armies {{began to}} draw apart; {{although}} sporadic fighting continued as night fell, by midnight both forces had disengaged completely. Both army councils met; Essex's plan to force {{his way past}} the Royalists seemed feasible, and many Parliamentarians, loathe {{to give up the}} ground they had taken, fully expected the <b>battle</b> <b>to</b> continue. The Royalists, on the other hand, were plagued by poor morale, heavy losses and a lack of supplies, having used 80 of their 90 barrels of gunpowder. Although Rupert argued for the <b>battle</b> <b>to</b> continue, he was out-voted, and the next morning Essex was allowed to bypass the Royalist force without issue and continue his retreat towards London.|$|E

5|$|A.P. Hill has {{received}} some criticism for his ineffective performance. His actions caused the <b>battle</b> <b>to</b> begin and then escalate on July 1, despite Lee's orders {{not to bring}} on a general engagement (although historians point out that Hill kept Lee well informed of his actions during the day). However, Hill's illness minimized his personal involvement {{in the remainder of}} the battle, and Lee took the explicit step of temporarily removing troops from Hill's corps and giving them to Longstreet for Pickett's Charge.|$|E
5|$|According to Njal's saga, Bróðir {{tried by}} sorcery {{to predict the}} outcome of the battle against Brian. He augured that if the battle were on Good Friday, King Brian would fall but win the battle; but if they fought on any day before, all who opposed Brian would be killed. Brian was unwilling to fight on Good Friday, as he would not fight on a fast day, but the Danes forced the <b>battle</b> <b>to</b> the Friday, which fell that year on 23 April.|$|E

5|$|Although he {{left the}} {{direction}} of the <b>battle</b> <b>to</b> subordinates, General Gates received a great deal of credit as the commanding general for the greatest American victory of the war to date. He may have conspired with others to replace George Washington as the commander-in-chief. Instead, he received the command of the main American army in the South. He led it to a disastrous defeat at the 1780 Battle of Camden, where he was at the forefront of a panicked retreat. Gates never commanded troops in the field again.|$|E
5|$|Aronofsky {{realized}} that since writing in 2000 the battle scene between {{the armies of}} Mayans and conquistadors, The Lord of the Rings film trilogy, Troy, King Arthur, and other films had featured massive battle scenes. He felt less inclined to mimic the scale and rewrote the <b>battle</b> <b>to</b> be mainly between Jackman's conquistador character and the Mayans. The director {{realized that}}, with one man against the army, the rewrite was a suitable metaphor for his film's theme of a man defying odds to do the impossible and conquer death.|$|E

The film premiered in New York City on 20 October 1976, but was given a lukewarm reception by critics and fans. The film was particularly unsuccessful in the UK, where, unwilling to tour since 1975 because of their tax exile status, Led Zeppelin faced an uphill <b>battle</b> <b>to</b> recapture the public's affection.|$|E

Upon arrival in Haiti, Carney laid out U.S. concerns—lack of governance, lack of economic sustainability programs and an inability to prevent narco-trafficking through Haiti as the first port of call by the Cali drug cartels from Colombia.|$|E

As San Martín was appointed Protector of Peru, Cochrane reasoned that San Martín was no longer under Chilean command, and took the navy away. In later years Cochrane made accusations against San Martín in Chile.|$|E

Engaged in action the following month on the heavily defended hill Freda on Tarakan Island, Derrick was hit by five bullets from a Japanese machine gun. He died from his wounds on 24 May 1945.|$|E
