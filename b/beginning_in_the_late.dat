5|$|<b>Beginning</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> 1880s, Brazil's navy {{fell into}} obsolescence, a {{situation}} exacerbated by an 1889 revolution, which deposed Emperor Dom Pedro II, and an 1893 civil war. Despite having {{nearly three times}} the population of Argentina and almost five times the population of Chile, {{by the end of}} the 19th century Brazil was lagging behind the Chilean and Argentine navies in quality and total tonnage.|$|E
5|$|<b>Beginning</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> 1940s, Black wrote {{decisions}} {{relating to}} the establishment clause, where he insisted on the strict {{separation of church and}} state. The most notable of these was Engel v. Vitale (1962), which declared state-sanctioned prayer in public schools unconstitutional. This provoked considerable opposition, especially in conservative circles. Efforts to restore school prayer by constitutional amendment failed.|$|E

5|$|<b>Beginning</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> 1930s, Nazi Germany made {{increasingly}} aggressive territorial demands, threatening war if {{they were}} not met. It seized Austria and Czechoslovakia in 1938 and 1939. Hitler made a non-aggression pact with Joseph Stalin and invaded Poland in September 1939, launching World War II in Europe. In alliance with Italy and smaller Axis powers, Germany conquered most of Europe by 1940 and threatened Great Britain. Reichskommissariats took control of conquered areas and a German administration was established in what was left of Poland. Jews and others deemed undesirable were imprisoned, murdered in Nazi concentration camps and extermination camps, or shot.|$|E
5|$|<b>Beginning</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> 1950s, Dasho Shingkhar Lam, former Secretary to Jigme Dorji Wangchuck and Sixth Speaker of the National Assembly (1971–74), was {{requested}} by the king to make several modifications to the flag; {{he is responsible for}} its current design, which has remained unchanged since 1969. The king was reportedly dissatisfied that the early square Bhutanese flags did not flutter like the rectangular Indian flag displayed on the visit of an Indian official to the country. The standard measurements of the flag of Bhutan were thereafter altered to resemble the flag of India, which was 9 feet by 6 feet.|$|E

Many new programs and majors were inaugurated, as were important social outreach efforts. New ties were established with the private and industrial sectors, and a growing partnership developed with federal and state governments in creating programs for the economically and educationally disadvantaged.|$|E
5|$|Chachaklum's {{principal}} phase of occupation appears to {{date to the}} Terminal Classic period, during the 10th and 11th centuries AD. However, the site possesses massive basal platforms and these, together {{with the presence of}} the E-Group, suggests a longer occupational period than was immediately evident from the first excavations of the site. Further investigations have revealed a long occupational history <b>beginning</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Late</b> Preclassic period and continuing right through to the Late Classic.|$|E
5|$|Investigations of the West Group have {{revealed}} an occupation <b>beginning</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Late</b> Classic and reaching its maximum extent in the Terminal Classic. The construction methods {{used in the}} West Group were inferior {{to those of the}} acropolis, consisting of finely cut limestone blocks bound with an earth-based mortar rather than the lime-based mortar used in the palace complex. The platforms of the West Group appear to have supported perishable superstructures and some of these buildings may have been dedicated to craft production.|$|E

5|$|The film marked {{something}} of an {{end of an era}} for its creator. The director himself recognized this {{at the time of its}} release, telling critic Donald Richie that a cycle of some kind had just come to an end and that his future films and production methods would be different. His prediction proved quite accurate. <b>Beginning</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> 1950s, television began increasingly to dominate the leisure time of the formerly large and loyal Japanese cinema audience. And as film company revenues dropped, so did their appetite for risk—particularly the risk represented by Kurosawa's costly production methods.|$|E
5|$|The first weather maps in the 19th {{century were}} drawn {{well after the}} fact to help devise a theory on storm systems. After {{the advent of the}} telegraph, {{simultaneous}} surface weather observations became possible for the first time, and <b>beginning</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> 1840s, the Smithsonian Institution became the first organization to draw real-time surface analyses. Use of surface analyses began first in the United States, spreading worldwide during the 1870s. Use of the Norwegian cyclone model for frontal analysis began in the late 1910s across Europe, with its use finally spreading to the United States during World War II.|$|E
5|$|The folwark, a {{large-scale}} system of agricultural production based on serfdom, was a dominant feature on Poland's economic landscape <b>beginning</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> 15th century {{and for the}} next 300 years. This dependence on nobility-controlled agriculture in central-eastern Europe diverged from {{the western part of the}} continent, where elements of capitalism and industrialization were developing to a much greater extent, with the attendant growth of a bourgeoisie class and its political influence. The 16th-century agricultural trade boom combined with free or very cheap peasant labor made the folwark economy very profitable.|$|E

The station opened on July 1, 1933, {{along with the rest of}} the Concourse subway. On July 1, 1937, an escalator was opened in the station, the first of its kind in the Bronx.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the end of}} the 19th century Stretford was {{a largely}} {{agricultural}} village. The development of the Trafford Park industrial estate in the north of the town, <b>beginning</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> 19th century, had a significant effect on Stretford's subsequent development. At its peak in 1945 the park employed an estimated 75,000workers; housing and other amenities had to be constructed on what had previously been agricultural land. Trafford Park is still a very significant source of employment, containing an estimated 1,400 companies and employing about 44,000 people. As at the 2001 UK census, 0.3% of Stretford's working population was employed in agriculture.|$|E
5|$|Another stock {{plot device}} in the 1970s was the gay {{character}} in a police drama. They served as victims of blackmail or anti-gay violence, but more often as criminals. <b>Beginning</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> 1960s with N.Y.P.D., Police Story, and Police Woman, the use of homosexuals in stories became much more prevalent, according to Vito Russo, {{as a response to}} their higher profiles in gay activism. Lesbians were included as villains, motivated to murder by their desires, internalized homophobia, or fear of being exposed as homosexual. One episode of Police Woman earned protests by the National Gay Task Force before it aired for portraying a trio of murderous lesbians who killed retirement home patients for their money. NBC edited the episode because of the protests, but a sit-in was staged in the head of NBC's offices.|$|E
