While the Commonwealth Government has plans to amend the Workplace Relations Act 1996, which {{introduced}} WorkChoices, and the passage of the transition bill -the Workplace Relations Amendment (Transition to Forward with Fairness) Bill 2008 - and its assent have eased some elements of the legislation enacted in 1996 for some workers, in the education sector, however, the impact is less evident. One of the primary features of the transition bill is {{to bring an end to}} the making of new Australian Workplace Agreements (AWAs). It would be fair to say, however, that the education industry, and in particular schools, escaped some of the worst excesses of these individual contracts.

40|$|Edwards-Jones, G. (2010). Reducing carbon {{footprints}} in food supply chains. ? EuroChoices, The Agricultural Economics Society and the European Association of Agricultural Economists, 9, (3), 52. Dear Editor, Over {{the last three}} years we have carried out over 150 carbon footprints of supply chains from across the world, mainly in horticulture. Very few of these data have been published due to their commercial sensitivity. However the process of developing these footprints has provided us with knowledge on patterns of greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) from different food supply chains. It is from this experience that I draw the following observations. While there is great variation in the source of GHGs from horticultural supply chains, generally mitigation opportunities during production are limited. While there is scope to reduce use of on-farm energy, and to make more efficient use of inputs such as fertilisers, in reality these factors tend to contribute relatively little to the overall footprint of fresh produce. Processes such as packing, storage and transport make much greater contributions. Indeed storage can account for over 50 per cent of emissions for produce that are stored for many months, such as potatoes. These emissions are largely from energy use in the buildings, and the design and structure of the building has a large impact on levels of energy use. Redesign of stores and packhouses, and their internal processes offers potential to reduce the footprint of fresh produce. The same is true for protected crops where typically 90 per cent of the footprint comes from heating the glasshouse. Analysis of 23 of the UK?s 35 large tomato growers shows a strong positive relationship between the age of the glasshouse and the overall carbon footprint of the tomatoes. Newer glasshouses have lower footprints because of a combination of better internal processes, their structural design and the thermal properties of their constituent materials. The current advice to farmers on how to reduce GHGs through on-farm strategies such as enhancing yields and reducing on-farm energy use are useful starting points, but none of these will get anywhere near the levels of GHG reductions required to stabilise the climate. Radical redesign of ?<b>big</b> <b>ticket?</b> <b>items</b> at least offers some hope of approaching the necessary targets. However, achieving this is not simple. First we need better understanding of emissions from buildings in the food supply chain. Then we need to design new buildings and processes that have fewer emissions. Finally, we will need to persuade food businesses to make the extra investment required in new capital. Indeed ideally, technologically obsolete buildings would be replaced in the short term, even if this was ahead of their scheduled renewal time. A carbon tax, or massive increase in energy costs, would provide some incentive for new investment, but would not be welcome by many. Pressure from civil society and supermarkets is another option, but it will need {{a lot of pressure to}} encourage the early replacement of a million Euro glasshouse! Grants for capital investments are always well received by farmers, but tend not to be popular with policymakers, even when they offer genuine social goods, such as in pollution control. If none of these options is possible or palatable, then regulation is an option. One of the main drivers of enhanced energy efficiency in the UK?s housing stock has been the building regulations that require certain materials and designs to be used in all new houses, e. g. minimum thresholds for the quality of insulation in walls. Are radical building regulations for agricultural buildings a possibility? As with much in the climate change arena, ideas are cheap and solutions are not. However, the benefit of focusing thought and resources on buildings and other capital items in the food chain is that at least they are big enough users of energy to offer some hope of achieving meaningful reductions in GHGs.

40|$|Paul Smythe {{assesses the}} longer-term {{messages}} in the Costello {{budget and the}} Latham reply FOR long-term social policy watchers the Budget and Reply speeches by the treasurer, Peter Costello, {{and the leader of}} the opposition were remarkable for their overwhelming concentration on social rather than economic policy issues. It looks like we may be up for our first social policy federal election campaign in decades. From this point of view the significance of the budget debate lies in what it might tell us about the likely terms of engagement in that campaign Immediate public reaction has understandably been concerned with policy specifics. How many Australians will miss out on the Costello tax cuts? How will Latham fund extra social initiatives like the Youth Guarantee ? The assumption so far appears to be that there is an underlying bipartisan consensus about the overall policy goals. The fact that Latham failed to repudiate the regressive tax cuts to the high-earning elite certainly reinforces that impression. So where does an apparent bipartisan commitment to a low-tax, low-quality social service society come from? It is clearly rooted in the monetarist assumption of the 1980 s that social spending is by definition wasteful - that minimal government was not only good for the economy but good for society too. Indeed, some assumed that there was ‘no such thing as society’. Rewarding aspirational voters has emerged as a code for the current consensus. But have the parties got the aspiration right? Pre-budget polling of the Australian people over their preference for tax cuts or social spending suggests the parties should think again. These polls were unanimous that the majority aspire to quality social services for all Australians not a low tax society per se. Today we might well be seeing more a ‘social service revolt’ than a ‘tax revolt’. Both parties, however, seem reluctant to run with these winds of change. But the Budget suggests how they might; and while there are substantial similarities in regard to economic policy, there are also some clear differences in social policy approaches The <b>big</b> <b>ticket</b> <b>items</b> of the Costello budget reflect a truly conservative social aspiration. To give tax cuts to the top end at a time of growing inequality and increasing poverty is to say that cultivating an elite class is essential for the good society. Likewise with the emphasis on the family as the basic unit of society. Strong families in a strong market economy will be able to manage their own social needs with minimal need for tax-based state provision. In this two [...] tier social policy scenario, socially provided services are kept to a safety net minimum while the vast majority of individuals and families insure themselves privately. One would not anticipate the Howard government moving far from this social aspiration in the election campaign. But what of Labor? Latham expressed a preference for ‘small government’ but also an aspiration to an equality of opportunity for all Australians. His budget speech certainly leaves great scope for the market economy but also endorses an active role for government in social services such as health and education in order to build the ‘ladders of opportunity’. Here we could see emerging the lineaments of a new socio-economic policy paradigm. Still favouring the market economy but with a ‘social investment state’ ensuring that all Australians have an equal chance. Instead of the welfare minimalism of the Costello budget we could anticipate less emphasis on tax cuts and more talk of laying down a fiscal platform for a new era of prudent and sustainable social investment. We could also expect the major parties to moderate their aspirations to reflect the likely influence of the Greens and Democrats. These seem committed to something more like a traditional social democratic version of social policy, and some pundits are tipping the Greens’ preferences may {{play a key role in}} determining the result in marginal seats. It is possible that their influence will be on environmental rather than social policy. The federal budget 2004 suggests that a two-decade neglect of social policy in Australia may have ended. While early reaction to the budget suggests a more or less bipartisan understanding of the goals of social policy, a closer examination suggests differences of emphasis which may well widen in the coming election campaign. Welfare minimalism or social investment may well be the defining choice in this social policy election.

40|$|All {{the funding}} {{numbers in the}} OCED’s latest {{education}} report look bad for Australia, writes SIMON MARGINSON LAST week the OECD released the 2007 issue of its annual comparison of knowledge economies, Education at a Glance. What followed was all too predictable. It was inevitable that {{this close to the}} federal election the 449 page OECD report would be annexed by the Labor opposition to its education-has-been-neglected electoral narrative. It was equally inevitable that in response the government would trash the report, even though it had supplied the data on Australia used by the OECD. Australia is well below par in education on a small number of international comparisons and average or better on many others. This helps the government. But relative national performance is poor or deteriorating on several <b>big</b> <b>ticket</b> <b>items,</b> such as early childhood education and public funding of tertiary education. Herein lies the political danger that drove the government’s tactics last week. There are four clanging errors in this OECD report, the Prime Minister said. It leaves childcare out of early learning, it calls HECS loans private not public spending, it excludes most vocational training from tertiary funding, and ignores government investments in the nation’s future since 2004. To use this report, he declared, knowing it to be flawed and out of date, is “to mislead the parliament and the Australian people. ” When facing a large and complex data set that can be exploited by your political opponents at numerous points right up to election day, you don’t blink. You shoot the messenger and clear away the body. Fast. Smart politics. But good policy? International comparisons are important. The OECD has no vested interest in the election. Its data have more to tell us about our global position than anything we will see from either side of politics in the next few weeks. The OECD found that Australia spends 0. 1 per cent of GDP on early childhood education compared to an OECD country average of 0. 5 per cent. The OECD rightly excludes childcare from the calculation for every nation because childcare services neither embody mandatory learning programs nor are staffed by trained teachers. Early learning is the largest hole in Australia’s capability as a knowledge economy. Only 42 per cent of 3 - 4 year olds are enrolled, compared with 69 per cent in the OECD and 91 per cent in the UK. The legacy of early neglect is weak literacy in the bottom layer of school students and a higher than average school drop-out rate. The opposition has emphasised those OECD data demonstrating the shift of education costs from public to private sources. This is a thirty year trend in Australia but has accelerated since 1995. At just 4. 3 per cent of GDP Australia is now a low public spender on education (the OECD average is 5. 0 per cent). Education costs carried by households and firms total 1. 6 per cent of GDP (OECD average 0. 7 per cent). Because Australia has a large number of independent private schools, governments carry just 83 per cent of school costs, second lowest in the OECD after Korea. At tertiary stage governments carry 47 per cent of total costs, fourth lowest, and spend just 0. 8 per cent of GDP compared to an OECD average of 1. 0 per cent. Most countries are growing private investment in education. The OECD notes that it is normally used to complement public investment not replace it. Except in Australia. Between 1995 and 2004 the average OECD country increased public funding of tertiary education by 49 per cent. In the USA it rose 54 per cent. But in Australia public funding fell by 4 per cent, bottom of the OECD table, while student numbers rose by 31 per cent. By 2004 public funding per student was 26 per cent below the 1995 level. Mr Howard might have built a case on the doubling of private tertiary funding as he has done before, but total tertiary funding per student from all sources increased by only 1 per cent. All the funding numbers look bad. The quickest fix is to discredit them. However, the treatment of HECS loans as private not public is consistent with the final costs and with the OECD’s handling of student loans elsewhere. The allocation of much of training to secondary not tertiary education is again standard practice. The classification is based on the educational level of programs not the idiosyncratic descriptors of institutions used in each nation. The modest increases in funding since 2004 are unlikely to impact the comparative picture. Other nations have done the same. Where the government has an argument is that the interest rate on student HECS debts is sub-commercial, and some HECS debts are not repaid because graduates go overseas or work in low paying jobs or raise children. These implicit public subsidies fall outside the OECD number for public spending. There is also a case for reclassifying certain short course adult training as tertiary rather than secondary. Even so, these inclusions would lift Australian public spending by only 1 or 2 percentage points. There are many other insights in this report. Mandated basic skills are a smaller part of the school curriculum than in other nations. Immigrants do almost as well in Australian schooling as the native born. A high 63 per cent of 15 year olds expect to complete degrees; and the gap between girls (69 per cent) and boys (57 per cent) is greater than in any other country. The enrolment rate of 15 - 19 year olds is low but adult enrolment is comparatively strong. The average duration of tertiary studies is the second lowest in the OECD. Tertiary completion rates are below average. The income advantages of graduates are lower than elsewhere but their employment rates are relatively strong. But following last week’s “discussion” {{it is likely that the}} report will be mothballed at least till after the election. • Simon Marginson is a Professor of Higher Education at the Centre for the Study of Higher Education, University of Melbourne.
