5|$|Dexter's Laboratory was {{inspired}} by one of Genndy Tartakovsky's drawings of a ballerina. After drawing Dee Dee's tall, thin shape, he decided to pair her with a short and blocky opposite, Dexter, inspired by Tartakovsky's older brother Alex. After enrolling at the California Institute of the Arts in 1990 to study animation, Tartakovsky wrote, directed, animated, and produced four short films that would <b>become</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> for the series.|$|E
5|$|The second {{president}} of the Republic of Texas, Mirabeau B. Lamar, is the Father of Texas Education. During his term, the state set aside three leagues of land in each county for equipping public schools. An additional 50 leagues of land {{set aside for the}} support of two universities would later <b>become</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> of the state's Permanent University Fund. Lamar's actions set the foundation for a Texas-wide public school system.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1940, SS-Nordland and SS-Westland had <b>become</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> for the {{formation}} of the fourth division, SS-Division Wiking. Casting about for another source of recruits, Berger struck upon the idea of enlisting convicted criminals, who were concentrated in the Sonderkommando Dirlewanger, commanded by Berger's friend, Dirlewanger. Dirlewanger had returned from Spain and been reinstated as a SS-Standartenfuhrer der Reserve in the Allgemeine SS at Berger's instigation. In September 1940, Dirlewanger's unit had been deployed to the area of occupied Poland, where they established defensive positions and provided guards for a Jewish labour camp.|$|E

5|$|Sud-Est's design bureau, {{while working}} on the Sud Aviation Caravelle in 1953, {{licensed}} several design features from de Havilland, building on previous collaborations on earlier licensed designs, including the DH 100 Vampire; the nose and cockpit layout of the Comet 1 was grafted onto the Caravelle. In 1969, when the Comet 4's design was modified by Hawker Siddeley to <b>become</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> for the Nimrod, the cockpit layout was completely redesigned and bore little resemblance to its predecessors except for the control yoke.|$|E
5|$|Tribonian's code ensured the {{survival}} of Roman law. It {{formed the basis of}} later Byzantine law, as expressed in the Basilika of Basil I and Leo VI the Wise. The only western province where the Justinianic code was introduced was Italy (after the conquest by the so-called Pragmatic Sanction of 554), from where it was to pass to Western Europe in the 12th century and <b>become</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> of much European law code. It eventually passed to Eastern Europe where it appeared in Slavic editions, and it also passed on to Russia. It remains influential to this day.|$|E

25|$|The land {{given to}} pope Stephen in 756, in the {{so-called}} Donation of Pepin, made the papacy a temporal power {{and for the first}} time created an incentive for secular leaders to interfere with papal succession.

Frustrated by legacy designs and typically unsuited cockpits, Stucki had observed that the light single-engine helicopter market had not seen any all-new designs developed in decades, and conducted market research that indicated a viable demand for a new rotorcraft in the 2.5-tonne class. Accordingly, in 2007, Stucki formed Marenco Swisshelicopter (the name Marenco was derived from Martin Engineering and Consulting) {{to carry out the}} development of the envisioned rotorcraft.|$|E
