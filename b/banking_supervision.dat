5|$|Some {{degree of}} {{self-regulation}} occurs whereby {{banks and other}} financial institutions attempt to operate within guidelines set and published by multilateral {{organizations such as the}} International Monetary Fund or the Bank for International Settlements (particularly the Basel Committee on <b>Banking</b> <b>Supervision</b> and the Committee on the Global Financial System). Further examples of international regulatory bodies are: the Financial Stability Board (FSB) established to coordinate information and activities among developed countries; the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) which coordinates the regulation of financial securities; the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) which promotes consistent insurance industry supervision; the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering which facilitates collaboration in battling money laundering and terrorism financing; and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) which publishes accounting and auditing standards. Public and private arrangements exist to assist and guide countries struggling with sovereign debt payments, such as the Paris Club and London Club. National securities commissions and independent financial regulators maintain oversight of their industries' foreign exchange market activities. Two examples of supranational financial regulators in Europe are the European Banking Authority (EBA) which identifies systemic risks and institutional weaknesses and may overrule national regulators, and the European Shadow Financial Regulatory Committee (ESFRC) which reviews financial regulatory issues and publishes policy recommendations.|$|E

40|$|Driven {{in part by}} the {{question}} of <b>bank</b> <b>supervision</b> in euro-area countries, a growing body of literature addresses whether central <b>banking</b> and <b>bank</b> <b>supervision</b> should be combined. This paper address this debate in light of recent legislation in the United Kingdom and the United States. Recent legislation in the United Kingdom stripped the Bank of England of its responsibility for <b>bank</b> <b>supervision</b> and established the Financial Services Authority as an integrated supervisor of financial services. In the United States, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 expanded the regulatory authority of the Federal Reserve. In light of international trends, I consider how the separation of monetary policy and <b>bank</b> <b>supervision</b> in the United Kingdom versus the combination of those functions in the United States stacks up against the empirical and theoretical literature. I conclude that the approaches in both countries rely on untested elements.

5|$|Countries {{sought to}} improve the {{sustainability}} and transparency of the global financial system in response to crises in the 1980s and 1990s. The Basel Committee on <b>Banking</b> <b>Supervision</b> was formed in 1974 by the G-10 members' central bank governors to facilitate cooperation on the supervision and regulation of banking practices. It is headquartered at the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland. The committee has held several rounds of deliberation known collectively as the Basel Accords. The first of these accords, known as Basel I, took place in 1988 and emphasized credit risk and the assessment of different asset classes. Basel I was motivated by concerns over whether large multinational banks were appropriately regulated, stemming from observations during the 1980s Latin American debt crisis. Following Basel I, the committee published recommendations on new capital requirements for banks, which the G-10 nations implemented four years later. In 1999, the G-10 established the Financial Stability Forum (reconstituted by the G-20 in 2009 as the Financial Stability Board) to facilitate cooperation among regulatory agencies and promote stability in the global financial system. The Forum was charged with developing and codifying twelve international standards and implementation thereof. The Basel II accord was set in 2004 and again emphasized capital requirements as a safeguard against systemic risk {{as well as the}} need for global consistency in banking regulations so as not to competitively disadvantage banks operating internationally. It was motivated by what were seen as inadequacies of the first accord such as insufficient public disclosure of banks' risk profiles and oversight by regulatory bodies. Members were slow to implement it, with major efforts by the European Union and United States taking place as late as 2007 and 2008. In 2010, the Basel Committee revised the capital requirements in a set of enhancements to Basel II known as Basel III, which centered on a leverage ratio requirement aimed at restricting excessive leveraging by banks. In addition to strengthening the ratio, Basel III modified the formulas used to weight risk and compute the capital thresholds necessary to mitigate the risks of bank holdings, concluding the capital threshold should be set at 7% of the value of a bank's risk-weighted assets.|$|E
25|$|With {{the end of}} the Bretton Woods system (1971â€“73) and the {{transition}} to floating exchange rates, financial stability issues came to the fore. The collapse of internationally active banks, such as Bankhaus Herstatt (1974), highlighted the need for improved <b>banking</b> <b>supervision</b> at an international level. The G10 Governors created the Basel Committee for <b>Banking</b> <b>Supervision</b> (BCBS), which remains active to this day. The BIS developed into a global meeting place for regulators and for developing international standards (Basel Concordat, Basel Capital Accord, Basel II and III). Through its member central banks, the BIS was actively involved in the resolution of the Latin American debt crisis (1982).|$|E

There remain significant differences between United States, European Union, and United Nations officials regarding the degree of capital adequacy and reserve controls that global banking now requires.

25|$|The {{economy of}} the Republic of Ireland {{expanded}} rapidly during the Celtic Tiger years (1995â€“2007) due to a low corporate tax rate, low ECB interest rates, and other systemic factors (such as soft surveillance of <b>banking</b> <b>supervision</b> including against observance of Basel Core Principles, underdeveloped public financial management and anti-corruption systems and adoption of poor policies including a corporate tax system that fostered non-tradable goods and services through the construction industry). At {{the end of the}} third quarter of 2010, German banks had between US$186.4 billion and $208.3 billion in total exposure to Ireland with $57.8 billion in exposure to Irish banks.

Irish banks, already over-exposed to the Irish property market, came under severe pressure in September 2008 due to the global financial crisis of 2007â€“08.|$|E

500|$|Governor of the Bank of England {{and former}} Governor of the Bank of Canada Mark Carney has {{described}} two approaches to global financial reform: shielding financial institutions from cyclic economic effects by strengthening banks individually, and defending economic cycles from banks by improving systemic resiliency. Strengthening financial institutions necessitates stronger capital requirements and liquidity provisions, {{as well as}} better measurement and management of risks. The G-20 agreed to new standards presented by the Basel Committee on <b>Banking</b> <b>Supervision</b> at its 2009 summit in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The standards included leverage ratio targets to supplement other capital adequacy requirements established by Basel II. Improving the resiliency of the global financial system requires protections that enable the system to withstand singular institutional and market failures. Carney has argued that policymakers have converged on the view that institutions must {{bear the burden of}} financial losses during future financial crises, and such occurrences should be well-defined and pre-planned. He suggested other national regulators follow Canada in establishing staged intervention procedures and require banks to commit to what he termed [...] "living wills" [...] which would detail plans for an orderly institutional failure.|$|E

2500|$|The main {{role of the}} Basel Committee on <b>Banking</b> <b>Supervision,</b> {{hosted by}} the BIS, is setting capital {{adequacy}} requirements.

40|$|The {{trend toward}} {{incorporating}} information derived from financial markets into the <b>bank</b> <b>supervision</b> process has gained momentum {{over the past}} several years.

This paper reviews the research on what information can be gleaned from the pricing of equity and debt securities issued by banking organizations. The weight of the research leaves little room for doubt that financial market signals reflect underlying bank risk and that market evaluations of the risk of individual banking organizations are strongly correlated with supervisory findings. The evidence {{on the extent to which}} market signals can augment the information set of bank supervisors is more subtle, but overall it demonstrates that financial market signals should play a role in the <b>bank</b> <b>supervision</b> process. 1...|$|R
40|$|Ruth de Krivoyâ€™s {{paper is}} a {{valuable}} contribution to the literature on <b>bank</b> <b>supervision.</b> It provides a unique insight on this topic from an insider who witnessed the problems that bank supervisors can encounter in emerging market countries.

In 1994 â€“ 95, Venezuela experienced a major banking crisis, which the World Bank estimated cost close to 20 percent of GDP to clean up (Caprio and Klingbiel 1996).
