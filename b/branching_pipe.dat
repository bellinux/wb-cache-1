40|$|Subsurface drip {{irrigation}} (SDI) {{is known as}} one of the most effective irrigation methods capable of improving water use efficiency through providing small amounts of water at short irrigation intervals and causing little or no water loss in terms of deep percolation, runoff and soil evaporation. However, temporal waterlogging within the root zone during and after irrigation events adversely affects root respiration, water and nutrient uptake and consequently plant growth. Therefore, irrigation of plants with hyper-aerated, or oxygenated, water could alleviate the impacts of waterlogging in the rhizosphere. Recent studies reportedly showed that aeration of irrigation water by means of venturi air injector in SDI systems (known as oxygation) enhanced crop performance in hypoxic soils. However, there was evidence of non-uniform improvement in crop yield along lateral pipes which might be ascribed to non-uniform distribution of air flow along irrigation pipes. Moreover, under pipe inclinations ranging from 5 º to 15 º, preferential flow of air was reportedly observed in <b>branching</b> <b>pipe</b> systems (containing no emitters) for ratio of water to air flow in the range of 0. 1 – 0. 3. In the current study, preliminary investigation on preferential flow of air into branching horizontal pipe layouts suggested that delivery of air bubbles from the first emitter on the lateral pipe closest to the junction of main pipe and manifold might have formed a zone of relative low pressure. It was speculated that the low pressure zone was responsible for occurrence of preferential air flow in the <b>branching</b> <b>pipe</b> systems...|$|E

40|$|Multiphase flow is {{a common}} {{phenomenon}} in many industrial processes, amongst them {{the oil and gas}} industry. Due to the complexity of multiphase flow, development of reliable analysis tool is difficult. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has been an established tool for flow analysis in the field of single phase flow for more than 20 years but has only started to become established in the multiphase field as well. To be able to use CFD in a meaningful way it is important to investigate, understand and validate the many models offered in commercial codes. The purpose of this thesis is to compare multiphase models available in the ANSYS software Fluent and CFX and perform simulations using the different models. The simulations were based on an experimental study concerning air-water mixtures in a vertical T-junction with horizontal branch. When a gas-liquid mixture flows into a <b>branching</b> <b>pipe</b> junction phase redistribution will occur and a higher proportion of gas will enter the side branch. The aim of the simulations was to find models/settings that accurately predict the phase redistribution phenomenon and investigate the effect of changing simulation parameters. This was done by systematically changing parameters and validating the results against the experimental data. Based on the simulations, it was evident that the Euler-Euler modelling approach was best suited for predicting the phase redistribution phenomenon in the T-junction. The choice of dispersed phase diameter was found to have the largest effect on the results. Generally, the predicted average volume fraction in each arm was in quite good consistency with experimental data while the predicted velocities were in low agreement.

One of the regions most at risk of suffering from thermal fatigue is a small elbow <b>pipe</b> <b>branching</b> off from the main pipe of the coolant loop for the drain or letdown system in the chemical and volume control system (CVCS).

And the maximum value of SIF is at the deepest point of the crack and is a linear increasing function of external load P.

40|$|Creep {{failure of}} welds in {{high-temperature}} power plant steam piping systems {{is known to}} be a potential cause of plant failure. Creep behaviour of plain pipes with circumferential welds and cross-weld specimens have received fairly extensive attention. However, research into the creep behaviour of welded thick-walled <b>branched</b> steam <b>pipes</b> has received less attention. Consequently, this thesis addresses improving the understanding of the creep behaviour for this type of geometry. Numerical and analytical methods are used to assess the creep behaviour of typical power plant <b>branched</b> <b>pipe</b> geometries. The effects of various geometric and material parameters on the creep stress and creep life behaviour of the connections are studied. In particular, the effect of the differing creep properties associated with the various material regions of the weld are investigated. The importance of incorporation of weld properties in creep life assessments is thus assessed. Finite element steady-state and continuum damage mechanics creep analyses have been used to identify the relative creep strength of typical connections compared to plain pipes. The work identifies typical creep rupture locations within <b>branched</b> <b>pipe</b> welds and the associated damage accumulation at and around these positions. Various creep life assessment methods/procedures are used in practise: these are mainly the British Standard codes, British Energy's R 5 procedure, steady state creep approaches and continuum damage mechanics approaches. The relative accuracy and conservatism of these distinct approaches are addressed for the application to typical <b>branched</b> <b>pipes.</b> The general formulation of steady-state creep stress is applied to the parametric study of weld materials in a typical multi-material welded <b>branched</b> <b>pipe.</b> An approximate interpolation technique for power-law creep is implemented {{to reduce the number of}} analyses needed to span a wide range of material parameters.
