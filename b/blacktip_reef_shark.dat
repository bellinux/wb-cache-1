5|$|Like {{most other}} members of its genus, the phylogenetic {{position}} of the <b>blacktip</b> <b>reef</b> <b>shark</b> remains indeterminate. Based on morphology, Jack Garrick proposed in 1982 that the closest relative of the <b>blacktip</b> <b>reef</b> <b>shark</b> was the nervous shark (C.cautus). Leonard Compagno's 1988 morphological analysis suggested affinity not only between this species and the nervous shark, but also four other species, and could not resolve their relationships further. A 1998 allozyme analysis by Gavin Naylor again yielded ambiguous results, finding that the <b>blacktip</b> <b>reef</b> <b>shark</b> forms a polytomy (irresolvable group) with 10 other Carcharhinus species.|$|E

5|$|Under most circumstances, the <b>blacktip</b> <b>reef</b> <b>shark</b> has a timid {{demeanor}} and is easily frightened away by swimmers. However, its inshore habitat preferences {{bring it into}} frequent contact with humans, and thus it is regarded as potentially dangerous. As of early 2009, 11 unprovoked attacks and 21 attacks total (none fatal) were listed on the International Shark Attack File that are attributable to the <b>blacktip</b> <b>reef</b> <b>shark.</b> Most attacks involve sharks biting the legs or feet of waders, apparently mistaking them for their natural prey, and do not result in serious injury. In the Marshall Islands, native islanders avoid <b>blacktip</b> <b>reef</b> <b>shark</b> attacks by swimming rather than wading through shallow water, {{and a way of}} discouraging these sharks is to submerge one's body. The <b>blacktip</b> <b>reef</b> <b>shark</b> has also been known to become aggressive in the presence of bait, and may pose a threat while attempting to steal the catches of spear fishers.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with the}} <b>blacktip</b> <b>reef</b> <b>shark</b> (C. melanopterus) and the whitetip reef shark (Triaenodon obesus), the {{grey reef shark}} {{is one of the}} three most common sharks inhabiting Indo-Pacific reefs. They {{actively}} expel most other shark species from favored habitats, even species larger in size. In areas where this species co-exists with the <b>blacktip</b> <b>reef</b> <b>shark,</b> the latter species occupies the shallow flats, while the former stays in deeper water. Areas with a high abundance of grey reef sharks tend to contain few sandbar sharks (C. plumbeus), and vice versa; {{this may be due to}} their similar diets causing competitive exclusion.|$|E
5|$|Timid and skittish, the <b>blacktip</b> <b>reef</b> <b>shark</b> is {{difficult}} to approach and seldom poses a danger to humans unless roused by food. However, people wading through shallow water {{are at risk of}} having their legs mistakenly bitten. This shark is used for its meat, fins, and liver oil, but is not considered to be a commercially significant species. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed the <b>blacktip</b> <b>reef</b> <b>shark</b> as Near Threatened. Although the species as a whole remains widespread and relatively common, overfishing of this slow-reproducing shark has led to its decline at a number of locales.|$|E
5|$|The whitetip reef shark {{is one of}} {{the three}} most common sharks inhabiting the reefs of the Indo-Pacific, the other two being the <b>blacktip</b> <b>reef</b> <b>shark</b> (Carcharhinus melanopterus) and the grey reef shark (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos). The habitat {{preferences}} of this species overlap those of the other two, though it does not tend to frequent very shallow water like the <b>blacktip</b> <b>reef</b> <b>shark,</b> nor the outer reef like the grey reef shark. The whitetip reef shark swims with strong undulations of its body, and unlike other requiem sharks can lie motionless on the bottom and actively pump water over its gills for respiration. This species is most active at night or during slack tide, and spends much of the day resting inside caves singly or in small groups, arranged in parallel or stacked atop one another. Off Hawaii, these sharks may be found sheltering inside underwater lava tubes, while off Costa Rica they are often seen lying in the open on sandy flats.|$|E

5|$|Subsequent authors {{moved the}} <b>blacktip</b> <b>reef</b> <b>shark</b> to the genus Carcharhinus; in 1965 the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature {{designated}} {{it as the}} type species for the genus. In some earlier literature, the scientific name of this shark was mistakenly given as C. spallanzani, now recognized as a synonym of the spottail shark (C. sorrah). Other common names for this species include blackfin reef shark, black-finned shark, blacktip shark, reef blacktip shark, and guliman.|$|E
5|$|Based on morphology, Jack Garrick {{suggested}} in 1982 that the nervous shark {{is closely related}} to the <b>blacktip</b> <b>reef</b> <b>shark</b> (C. melanopterus). Leonard Compagno in 1988 tentatively grouped these two species with the blacknose shark (C. acronotus), the copper shark (C. brachyurus), the silky shark (C. falciformis), and the night shark (C. signatus). The close relationship between the nervous and blacktip reef sharks was upheld in a 1992 phylogenetic study by Shane Lavery, based on allozymes, and again in a 2011 study by Ximena Vélez-Zuazoa and Ingi Agnarsson, based on nuclear and mitochondrial genes.|$|E
5|$|Blacktip reef sharks, {{particularly}} small individuals, {{fall prey}} to larger fishes, including groupers, grey reef sharks, tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier), and {{members of their own}} species. At Palmyra Atoll, adults avoid patrolling tiger sharks by staying out of the central, deeper lagoon. Their known parasites include the tapeworms Anthobothrium lesteri, Nybelinia queenslandensis, Otobothrium alexanderi, and Platybothrium jondoeorum, a myxosporidian in the genus Unicapsula, and the monogenean Dermophthirius melanopteri. One of the few documented examples of infectious disease in a shark was a fatal case of hemorrhagic septicemia in a <b>blacktip</b> <b>reef</b> <b>shark,</b> caused by the bacterium Aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida.|$|E
40|$|Most {{fish are}} ectotherms {{and for this}} reason, water {{temperature}} {{is thought to be}} one of the main physical determinants of behaviour. We tested the hypothesis that behavioural thermoregulation occurs in 4 species of <b>reef</b> <b>sharks</b> (n = 58), where water temperature influences patterns of long-term (> 1 yr) movement, by analysing acoustic monitoring and environmental datasets. We also used biotelemetry to measure the body temperature of 5 adult female <b>blacktip</b> <b>reef</b> <b>sharks</b> Carcharhinus melanopterus in response to changes in water temperature, to test whether they participate in inshore aggregations potentially to increase metabolic rates. We found that water temperature had the greatest influence on shark presence at each of our study sites (deviance explained = 3. 7 − 54. 6 %), when compared to other variables. On average, body temperatures of female <b>blacktip</b> <b>reef</b> <b>sharks</b> were consistently warmer than average (±SE) water temperature by 1. 3 ± 0. 57 °C, providing support for behavioural thermoregulation. The maximum body temperature of <b>blacktip</b> <b>reef</b> <b>sharks</b> while at the aggregation site corresponded to peak daily water temperatures. The average hourly body temperature varied little among individuals. Our models showed that the relationship between water temperature and the presence of female <b>blacktip</b> <b>reef</b> <b>sharks</b> was strongest at the aggregation site relative to other sites. These results suggest that <b>reef</b> <b>shark</b> movements are influenced by water temperature and provide additional support for the behavioural thermoregulation hypothesis. Such data are necessary for predicting how sharks might be affected by climate change and other human modifications to water temperature patterns. Conrad W. Speed, Mark G. Meekan, Iain C.

40|$|International audienceWound {{healing is}} {{important}} for sharks from the earliest life stages, for example, as the 'umbilical scar' in viviparous species heals, and throughout adulthood, when sharks can incur a range of external injuries from natural and anthropogenic sources. Despite anecdotal accounts of rapid healing in elasmobranchs, data regarding recovery and survival of individuals from different wound or injury types has not been systematically collected. The present study documented: (i) 'umbilical scar' healing in wild-caught, neonatal <b>blacktip</b> <b>reef</b> <b>sharks</b> while being reared for 30 days in flow-through laboratory aquaria in French Polynesia; (ii) survival and recovery of free-swimming <b>blacktip</b> <b>reef</b> <b>sharks</b> in Australia and French Polynesia following a range of injuries; and (iii) long-term survival following suspected shark-finning activities. Laboratory monitoring, tag-recapture records, telemetry data and photo-identification records suggest that <b>blacktip</b> <b>reef</b> <b>sharks</b> have a high capacity to survive and recover from small or even large and severe wounds. Healing rates, recovery and survival are important factors to consider when assessing impacts of habitat degradation and fishing stress on shark populations. The present study suggests that individual survival may depend more on handling practices and physiological stress rather than the extent of physical injury. These observations also contribute to discussions regarding the ethics of tagging practices used in elasmobranch research and provide baseline healing rates that may increase the accuracy in estimating reproductive timing inferred from mating scars and birth dates for neonatal sharks based on umbilical scar healing status.

5|$|Superficially, the smoothtooth blacktip shark {{resembles the}} <b>blacktip</b> <b>reef</b> <b>shark</b> (C. melanopterus). It is rather robust in build, {{with a short}} and blunt snout. The large {{nostrils}} are preceded by well-developed, triangular flaps of skin. The small, circular eyes are equipped with nictitating membranes. The mouth forms a wide arch and has very short furrows at the corners. There are 16 upper and 14–15 lower tooth rows on either side, along with two to three small teeth at the symphysis (center) of either jaw. The teeth are distinctive in shape, having narrow, upright cusps without serrations; finetooth sharks and juvenile spinner sharks are the only other members of Carcharhinus with similar teeth. The five pairs of gill slits are long.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{relationships of}} the creek whaler {{have yet to be}} fully resolved. In comparative morphological studies published by Jack Garrick in 1982 and Leonard Compagno in 1988, it was tentatively placed in a grouping defined by the whitecheek shark (C. dussumieri) and the blackspot shark (C. sealei). Shane Lavery, in a 1992 study based on allozymes, reported that this species was close to the nervous shark (C. cautus) and the <b>blacktip</b> <b>reef</b> <b>shark</b> (C. melanopterus). Ximena Vélez-Zuazoa and Ingi Agnarsson, in a 2011 study based on nuclear and mitochondrial genes, found it to be the basal member of a clade also containing the graceful shark (C. amblyrhynchoides), the blacktip shark (C. limbatus), and the Australian blacktip shark (C. tilstoni).|$|E
5|$|Although it {{has been}} {{reported}} from a depth of , the <b>blacktip</b> <b>reef</b> <b>shark</b> is usually found in water only a few meters deep, and can often be seen swimming close to shore with its dorsal fin exposed. Younger sharks prefer shallow, sandy flats, while older sharks are most common around reef ledges and can also be found near reef drop-offs. This species has also been reported from brackish estuaries and lakes in Madagascar, and freshwater environments in Malaysia, though it is not able to tolerate low salinity to the same degree as the bull shark (C.leucas). At Aldabra in the Indian Ocean, blacktip reef sharks congregate in the channels between reef flats during low tide and travel to the mangroves when the water rises. There is equivocal evidence that sharks from the northern and southern extremes of its distribution are migratory.|$|E

5|$|As {{often the}} most {{abundant}} apex predator within its ecosystem, the <b>blacktip</b> <b>reef</b> <b>shark</b> {{plays a major role}} in structuring inshore ecological communities. Its diet is composed primarily of small teleost fishes, including mullet, groupers, grunters, jacks, mojarras, wrasses, surgeonfish, and smelt-whitings. Groups of blacktip reef sharks in the Indian Ocean have been observed herding schools of mullet against the shore for easier feeding. Squid, octopus, cuttlefish, shrimp, and mantis shrimp are also taken, as well as carrion and smaller sharks and rays, though this is rare. Off northern Australia, this species is known to consume sea snakes, including Acrochordus granulatus, Hydrelaps darwiniensis, Hydrophis spp. and Lapemis hardwickii. Sharks off Palmyra Atoll have been documented preying on seabird chicks that have fallen out of their nests into the water. Miscellaneous items that have been found inside the stomachs of this species include algae, turtle grass, coral, hydrozoa, bryozoa, rats, and stones.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{morphological}} data, Jack Garrick {{suggested in}} 1982 that the blacknose shark has a sister relationship {{to a group}} containing the whitecheek shark (C. dussumieri) and the blackspot shark (C. sealei), while Leonard Compagno proposed in 1988 that this shark belongs in a group with five other species, including the silky shark (C. falciformis) and the <b>blacktip</b> <b>reef</b> <b>shark</b> (C. melanopterus). Molecular analyses have been similarly equivocal regarding the blacknose shark's phylogenetic relationships: Gavin Naylor's 1992 allozyme analysis found this species {{to be the most}} basal member of Carcharhinus, while Mine Dosay-Abkulut's 2008 ribosomal DNA analysis indicated affinity between it and the blacktip shark (C. limbatus) or the smalltail shark (C. porosus). The whitenose shark (Nasolamia velox), found along the tropical western coast of the Americas, may be descended from blacknose sharks that experienced the teratogenic effects of incipient cyclopia.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the other}} members of its family, the <b>blacktip</b> <b>reef</b> <b>shark</b> is viviparous, though the details of its life history vary across its range. Its {{reproductive}} cycle is annual off northern Australia, with mating taking place from January to February, as well as off Moorea in French Polynesia, where mating occurs from November to March. The cycle is biennial off Aldabra, where intense competition within and between species for food may constrain females to only bearing young every other year. Earlier accounts from the Indian Ocean by Johnson (1978), Madagascar by Fourmanoir (1961), and the Red Sea by Gohar and Mazhar (1964), indicated a biannual cycle in these regions with two breeding seasons per year from June to July and December to January. If accurate, the shorter reproductive cycles of these subpopulations may be a consequence of warmer water.|$|E
5|$|<b>Blacktip</b> <b>reef</b> <b>sharks</b> have {{extremely}} small home ranges and exhibit strong site fidelity, remaining {{within the same}} local area for up to several years at a time. They are active predators of small bony fishes, cephalopods, and crustaceans, and have also been known to feed on sea snakes and seabirds. Accounts of the <b>blacktip</b> <b>reef</b> <b>shark's</b> life history have been variable and sometimes contradictory, in part reflecting geographical differences within the species. Like other members of its family, this shark is viviparous, with females giving birth to two to five young on a biennial, annual, or possibly biannual cycle. Reports of the gestation period range from 7–9, through 10–11, to possibly 16 months. Mating is preceded by the male following closely behind the female, likely attracted by her chemical signals. Newborn sharks are found further inshore and in shallower water than adults, frequently roaming in large groups over areas flooded by high tide.|$|R

In the Pacific Ocean, it is found from southern China and the Philippines to Indonesia, northern Australia and New Caledonia, and also inhabits numerous oceanic islands, including the Marshall, Gilbert, Society, and Hawaiian Islands and Tuamotu. Contrary to what most sources state, there is a report suggesting that the specimens of this species from Japanese waters might be from Taiwan, however a number of sightings and captures of this species have been reported from the inshore waters of Ishigaki Island of Okinawa Prefecture in southern Japan. A Lessepsian migrant, this shark has colonized the eastern Mediterranean Sea by way of the Suez Canal.|$|E
25|$|Low {{densities of}} reef sharks were {{recorded}} in the Tuvalu Marine Life study.

25|$|Grey reef {{sharks are}} usually less than 1.9 metres (6.2ft) long. Despite their {{moderate}} size, grey reef sharks actively expel most other shark species from favored habitats.

Many grey reef sharks {{have a home}} range on a specific area of the reef, to which they continually return. However, they are social rather than territorial. During the day, these sharks often form groups of 5–20 individuals near coral reef drop-offs, splitting up in the evening as the sharks begin to hunt. They are found over continental and insular shelves, preferring the leeward (away {{from the direction of}} the current) sides of coral reefs with clear water and rugged topography. They are frequently found near the drop-offs at the outer edges of the reef, and less commonly within lagoons. On occasion, this shark may venture several kilometers out into the open ocean.|$|E
