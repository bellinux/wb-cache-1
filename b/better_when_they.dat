Hundreds more would die waiting to be shipped out, or on the voyage. Their prospects were little <b>better</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> arrived at the poorly staffed, unsanitary and overcrowded hospitals which were the only medical provision for the wounded. In Britain, a trenchant letter in The Times on 14 October triggered Sidney Herbert, Secretary of State for War, to approach Florence Nightingale to form a detachment of nurses {{to be sent to}} the hospital to save lives. Interviews were quickly held, suitable candidates selected, and Nightingale left for Turkey on 21 October.|$|E
25|$|A glove (Middle English from Old English glof) is {{a garment}} {{covering}} the whole hand. Gloves have separate sheaths or openings for each finger and the thumb; {{if there is}} an opening but no (or a short) covering sheath for each finger they are called fingerless gloves. Fingerless gloves having one large opening rather than individual openings for each finger are sometimes called gauntlets, though gauntlets are not necessarily fingerless. Gloves which cover the entire hand or fist but do not have separate finger openings or sheaths are called mittens. Mittens are warmer than other styles of gloves made of the same material because fingers maintain their warmth <b>better</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> are in contact with each other. Reduced surface area reduces heat loss.|$|E

2500|$|Trevelyan's own {{personality}} is enigmatic, with its undertones of racial prejudice and authoritarianism. He could defend his emigrants against the criticisms of Robert Lowe and {{the critics of}} his schemes in New South Wales, but he could also contemplate with satisfaction [...] "the prospect of flights of Germans settling here in increasing numbers - an orderly, moral, industrious and frugal people, less foreign {{to us that the}} Irish or Scotch Celt, a congenial element which will readily assimilate with our body politic". He certainly believed that he was benefiting both Britain and the Highlanders, for he wrote on another occasion, [...] "The Irish and Scotch, especially the latter, do much <b>better</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> have a fresh start in other countries, and become mixed up with other people, than when they stay at home".|$|E
2500|$|Insight 3 – No {{matter how}} well they have gained {{insights}} 1 and 2, insight alone rarely enables people to undo their emotional disturbances. They may feel <b>better</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> know, or think they know, how they became disturbed, because insights can feel useful and curative. But {{it is unlikely that}} people will actually get better and stay better unless they have and apply insight 3, which is that there is usually no way to get better and stay better except by continual work and practice in looking for and finding one’s core irrational beliefs; actively, energetically, and scientifically disputing them; replacing one’s absolute [...] "musts" [...] (rigid requirements about how things should be) with more flexible preferences; changing one's unhealthy feelings to healthy, self-helping emotions; and firmly acting against one’s dysfunctional fears and compulsions. Only by a combined cognitive, emotive, and behavioral, as well as a quite persistent and forceful attack on one's serious emotional problems, is one likely to significantly ameliorate or remove them, and keep them removed.|$|E
2500|$|Having {{already noted}} the {{importance}} of a woman's immunological tolerance to her baby's paternal genes, several Dutch reproductive biologists decided to take their research a step further. Consistent with the fact that human immune systems tolerate things <b>better</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> enter the body via the mouth, the Dutch researchers conducted a series of studies that confirmed a surprisingly strong correlation between a diminished incidence of pre-eclampsia and a woman's practice of oral sex, and noted that the protective effects were strongest if she swallowed her partner's semen. A team from the University of Adelaide has also investigated to see if men who have fathered pregnancies which have ended in miscarriage or pre-eclampsia had low seminal levels of critical immune modulating factors such as TGF-Beta. The team has found that certain men, dubbed [...] "dangerous males", are several times more likely to father pregnancies that would end in either pre-eclampsia or miscarriage. Among other things, most of the [...] "dangerous males" [...] seemed to lack sufficient levels of the seminal immune factors necessary to induce immunological tolerance in their partners.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: This article {{reports on}} {{quasi-experimental}} research. The aims {{of this research}} were to examine: 1) which model of cooperative learning (TAI or STAD) is suitable for improving student learning outcomes; 2) whether the learning outcomes of mathematics students who have a visual learning style taught by the TAI type model is <b>better</b> than <b>when</b> <b>they</b> are taught with the STAD model; 3) whether the learning outcomes of mathematics students who have an auditory learning style taught by the TAI type model are <b>better</b> than <b>when</b> <b>they</b> are taught with the STAD model; 4) whether the learning outcomes of mathematics students who have a kinaesthetic learning style taught by the TAI type model are <b>better</b> than <b>when</b> <b>they</b> are taught with the STAD model; and 5) whether the learning outcomes of students who have a visual learning style are better than for students with an auditory or kinaesthetic learning style. The results of the learning outcomes of mathematics by students who were taught by the TAI and STAD cooperative learning model types show {{that there are no}} significant differences in terms of the visual, auditory and kinaesthetic learning styles...|$|R
2500|$|Turtle Tuck (voiced by Teala Dunn in the U.S. and Callum Hanks in the UK) {{is a young}} turtle and {{the second}} oldest of the Wonder Pets. He is {{described}} as sensitive with an emotional connection to living things and {{the heart of the}} group. As a superhero, he wears a white French sailor's cap, blue Aquasocks, and a red cape. Tuck is empathetic, often desiring to give the rescued animals a hug or keeping them company while Linny and Ming-Ming put their rescue plan into action. He seems to enjoy things <b>better</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> stay the same (i.e. in [...] "Save the Ants!", Ming-Ming wanted to try red wheels for the Flyboat for a change, but Tuck wanted to stick to the same blue ones). He also has keen observational skills, spotting things from a distance, which often garners him the compliment, [...] "Good eye, Tuck!". Tuck is the only male in the Wonder Pets team. He is also the only Wonder Pet to wear foot covering. In [...] "Tuck & Buck", his cooler older cousin Buck comes to the Wonder Pets Schoolhouse for a visit.|$|E
