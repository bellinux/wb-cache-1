5000|$|Ammodytes americanus, {{also known}} as American sand lance, American sand eel, and sand launce, is a small fish in the family Ammodytidae. First {{described}} by James Ellsworth De Kay in 1842, it is widespread in the western North Atlantic. Like all sand lances, it has a long, thin body with a pointed snout; mature fish typically range from 4 to 6 in in length, though some may reach 7 in. Its back is greenish-brown, while its sides and abdomen are silvery. It has a long, low dorsal fin (described as [...] "very delicate") which extends along most of its <b>back,</b> <b>folding</b> into a groove at the fin's base when not in use. Its anal fin is roughly the same height as the dorsal fin, and extends over the posterior third of the fish's body. Its pectoral fins are small, and its caudal fin is forked. Its mouth is large and toothless, with a lower jaw that extends well beyond the upper. It typically travels in large schools, spending most of its time relatively near the water surface. It feeds primarily on plankton, though it is known to take small clams and snails from the sea floor, presumably when plankton is scarce. Towards dusk, schools of A. americanus bury themselves in sand, typically from 1 to 6 in below the sand's surface close to the water's edge; they avoid rocky areas. They do this to avoid being detected by night-hunting species such as bluefish and stripers.|$|E

We demonstrate the ability to distinguish intrinsic edges of graphene from edges formed by <b>back</b> <b>folding</b> based upon atomic structure and their susceptibility to sputtering. We examine how the atomic structure of the edges of graphene and few layer graphene sheets influences their stability under {{electron beam}} irradiation at a low electron accelerating voltage of 80 kV using aberration-corrected high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. We demonstrate that edges of few layer graphene produced by <b>back</b> <b>folding</b> are extremely robust against electron beam induced sputtering as compared to intrinsic edges that are naturally formed. The stability of the folded edges in few layer graphene is shown to increase with increasing number of layers. The higher stability of fold edges {{is related to the}} absence of any unsaturated carbon atoms that can be sputtered by electron beam irradiation. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd...|$|E

We find clear evidence for band <b>back</b> <b>folding</b> and hybridization demonstrating that conduction electrons are strongly affected {{by the emergence of}} magnetic order. Our high quality data revealed that although the Fermi surface is strongly three-dimensional, it does indeed have long parallel segments along the kz direction that can lead to the emergence of magnetic order. More interestingly, we find very unusual incommensurate nesting of the Fermi surface in the a-b plane that is present only at low temperatures. We speculate that this is a signature of a failed Charge Density Wave (CDW) state that was predicted by renormalization group studies...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} {{bifurcation}} and chaos phenomena theoretically {{observed in a}} simple electromagnetic system consisting of a linear, distortionless transmission line connected to an active linear resistor (R < 0) {{at one end and}} to a pn-junction diode at the other end. The active resistor gives rise to the stretching phenomena and the diode the <b>back</b> <b>folding</b> one; the combination of these two mechanisms may lead to chaotic dynamics. The Poincare map of the ''backward voltage wave'' at pn-junction diode is obtained by solving a one dimensional nonlinear implicit difference equation. For R < -R(c) (R(c) is the characteristic ''impedance'' of the line) the mapping is unimodal and the dynamics follow the Feigenbaum route to chaos [1]. The nonlinear implicit difference equation is solved numerically. Spatiotemporal chaos is observed in the voltage and current waves. By replacing the pn-junction diode with a twin-pn junction diode circuit, the hopping mechanism is also met...|$|E
40|$|We use {{large-scale}} DFT calculations {{to investigate}} with unprecedented detail the so-called spin-orbit (SO) proximity effect in graphene adsorbed on the Pt(111) and Ni(111) /Au semi-infinite surfaces, previously studied via spin and angle resolved photoemission experiments. The key finding is that, {{due to the}} hybridization with the metal's bands, the Dirac cones manifest an unexpectedly rich spin texture including out-of-plane and even radial in-plane spin components at (anti-) crossings where local gap openings and deviations from linearity take place. Both the continuum character of the metallic bands and the <b>back</b> <b>folding</b> associated to the moiré patterns enhance the spin texture and induce sizeable splittings which, nevertheless, only become giant (∼ 100 meV) at anti-crossing regions; that is, where electronic transport is suppressed. At the quasi-linear regions the splitted bands typically disperse with different broadenings and tend to cross with their magnetization continuously changing in order to match that {{at the edges of}} the upper and lower gaps. As a result, both the splittings and spin direction become strongly k-depedendent. The SO manifests in an analogous way for the spin-polarized G/Au/Ni(111) system, although here the magnetic exchange interactions dominate inducing small splittings (∼ 10 meV) in the π-bands while the SO mainly introduces a small Rashba splitting in the Dirac cones as their magnetization acquires a helical component. We interprete our results as a drawback to the potential development of graphene based spintronic devices relying on the SO proximity effect. Comment: 16 pages, 12 figure...|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{structure}} of carboxylic acid terminated neutral poly (propyl ether imine) (PETIM) dendrimer from generation 1 through 6 (G 1 -G 6) in a good solvent (water) by fully atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We determine {{as a function of}} generation such structural properties as: radius of gyration, shape tensor, asphericity, fractal dimension, monomer density distribution, and end-group distribution functions. The sizes obtained from the MD simulations have been validated by Small Angle X-Ray Scattering (SAXS) experiment on dendrimer of generation 2 to 4 (G 2 -G 4). A good agreement between the experimental and theoretical value of radius of gyration has been observed. We find a linear increase in radius of gyration with the generation. In contrast, Rg scales as ~ N^x with the number of monomers. We find two distinct exponents depending on the generations: x = 0. 47 for G 1 -G 3 and x = 0. 28 for G 3 -G 6 which reveals their non-space filling nature. In comparison with the amine terminated PAMAM dendrimer, we find Rg of G-th generation PETIM dendrimer is nearly equal to that of (G+ 1) -th generation of PAMAM dendrimer as observed by Maiti et. al. [Macromolecules, 38, 979 2005]. We find substantial <b>back</b> <b>folding</b> of the outer sub generations into the interior of the dendrimer. Due to their highly flexible nature of the repeating branch units, the shape of the PETIM dendrimer deviates significantly from the spherical shape and the molecules become more and more spherical as the generation increases. The interior of the dendrimer is quite open with internal cavities available for accommodating guest molecules suggesting using PETIM dendrimer for guest-host applications. We also give a quantitative measure of the number of water molecules present inside the dendrimer. Comment: 33 page...|$|E
40|$|The Upper Lahul {{region in}} the NW Himalaya {{is located in the}} {{transition}} zone between the High Himalayan Crystalline (HHC) to the SW and the Tethyan Zone sedimentary series to the NE. The tectonic evolution of these domains during the Himalayan Orogeny is the consequence of a succession of five deformation events. An early D 1 phase corresponds to synmetamorphic, NE verging folding. This deformation created the Tandi Syncline, which consists of Permian to Jurassic Tethyan metasediments cropping out in the core of a large-scale synformal fold within the HHC paragneiss. This tectonic event is interpreted as related to a NE directed nappe stacking (Shikar Beh Nappe), probably during the late Eocene to the early Oligocene. A subsequent D 2 a phase caused SW verging folding in the HHC. This deformation is interpreted as contemporaneous with late Oligocene to early Miocene SW directed thrusting along the Main Central Thrust. In the Tethyan Zone, a D 2 b phase is marked by a decollement thrust, a system of reverse faults, and gentle folds, associated with SW directed tectonic movements. This deformation is related to an imbricate structure, characteristic of a shallow structural level, and developed in the frontal part of a nappe affecting the Tethyan Zone units of SE Zanskar (Nyimaling-Tsarap Nappe). A later D 3 phase generated the Chandra Dextral Shear Zone (CDSZ), a large-scale, ductile, dextral strike-slip shear zone, located in the transition zone between the HHC and the Tethyan Himalaya. The CDSZ most likely represents a part of a system of early Miocene extensional and/or dextral, strike-slip shear zones-observed at the HHC-Tethyan Zone contact along the entire Himalaya.

40|$|The Margala Hills and Hazara Ranges are the {{south-western}} {{continuation of}} the Hazara- Kashmir Syntaxis in North Pakistan, constituting an east-northeast trending fold-thrust belt of Jurassic to Eocene platform sediments, partially overlying Late Precambrian basement. The current field investigations have revealed that at least three macro-scale fold-thrust nappes, which are structurally linked to a regional basal detachment located at base-Hazara Slate, fabricate the structural grain of the Margala Hills and southeast Hazara Ranges. From north to south these nappes include the Hazara fold-thrust nappe which is exposed along Hazara Thrust. Below the Hazara nappe lays the Garamthun nappe which is exposed at surface along Garamthun Fault. Southeast of the Garamthun Fault the hanging wall sequence of the Main Boundary Thrust constitutes the third fold-thrust nappe of the area and constitute the foothills of Margala Hills. All these fold-thrust nappes are characterised by east-northeast trending major anticlinal folds detached {{at the level of}} Jurassic rocks. The stratigraphic set up of these fold-thrust nappes implies a gradual south younging of structuration of the study area. The lithostratigraphic offset along the mapped faults is very little and does not support large scale horizontal movements with the thrust faulting alone. The large scale fold-thrust belt allochthony is shared by fold nappe mechanism which is also believed to be responsible for the thickening of the sedimentary pile. Mesoscopic and macroscopic folds data indicate the presence of at least three distinct lines of folding including northeast-southwest followed by southeast and north-south trends. The northwest-southeast compression is the prominent grain of the southeast Hazara and Margala Hills. Mesoscopic fault planes can be categorised into three distinct sets. The most prominent is the top to the southeast followed by top to the west-northwest and northeast. The top the southeast set is consistent with the movement direction on the macroscopic scale faults (Hazara Thrust, Garamthun Fault and Main Boundary Thrust) and the pitch data is suggestive of a dominant thrust slip motion in addition to left lateral strike slip adjustments. The second set that is the top to the west-northwest can be considered as the back thrusting phenomenon associated with the top to the southeast major displacement. The third set and a few other less prominent fault planes are generally oriented discordant to set one and two and indicate the transpressional related adjustments of the region. Most of dips in the hanging wall of Main Boundary Thrust are found to be overturned to the northwest and the axial planes of the folds mostly dip southeast. This <b>back</b> <b>folding</b> is most prominent and consistent along the hanging wall of Main Boundary Thrust and gradually defuse in the northwest direction. The synthesis of the structural data indicate that in the whole Miocene southward directed major shortening created a southwards propagating, flat-ramp thrust fault, cutting up section. This basal thrust carried the Margala Hills Mesozoic and part of its Murree cover towards the south above thicker Murree molasse and underlying Northern Potwar Deformed Zone Mesozoic nappes. Increased shortening took place by tight folding of the hanging wall. This could be the main reason of folds found in the Margala Hills. Late (?) Pliocene major, crustal or lithospheric scale folding created the Hazara Kashmir Syntaxis and created north-south to northeast-southwest axis folds in the Margala Hills. This event is responsible in the first instance for the east or west verging structures in the whole area, for the northwards or northwestwards overturned folds of the Margala Hills; and for the major crustal thickening and subsequent very important uplift of the whole area. The same event could have created strike slip faulting. Repeated south verging thrusting in Quaternary resulted in the southwards movement of the Salt Range above Pleistocene sediments, and flat, mostly south verging thrust faults cutting the older structures. This last event may have generated deeper ramps in the Northern Potwar Deformed Zone and may have formed folds and uplifts in the Northern Potwar deformed Zone and beneath the frontal part of Margala Hills. Strike slip faulting may accompany this event, together with gravitational collapse-induced normal faulting...|$|E
