Weininger argues {{that there is no}} such thing as a person who has a genius for, say, mathematics, or music, but there is only the universal genius, in whom everything exists and makes sense. He reasons that such genius is probably present in all people to some degree.|$|E

He published a book, entitled Secret Talks Between Tokyo and Washington, which {{was translated into}} English by Robert D. Eldridge in 2007. The <b>book</b> <b>is</b> <b>about</b> Miyazawa's views concerning {{the relationships between the}} US and Japan in terms of the political, economic, and security-related negotiations during the period of 1949 and 1954.|$|E
25|$|This <b>book</b> <b>is</b> <b>about</b> four {{children}} whose names were Ann, Martin, Rose and Peter. But {{it is most}} about Peter who was the youngest.

25|$|In 1298 Ibn Taymiyyah {{wrote an}} {{explanation}} of the ayat al-mutashabihat (the unclear verses of the Qur'an) called Al-`Aqidat al-Hamawiyat al-Kubra (The creed of the great people of Hama). The <b>book</b> <b>is</b> <b>about</b> divine attributes and it served as an answer to a question from the city of Hama, Syria. At that particular time Ash'arites held prominent positions within the Islamic scholarly community in both Syria and Egypt, and they held a certain position on the divine attributes of God. Ibn Taymiyyah in his book strongly disagreed with their views and this heavy opposition to the common Ash'ari position, caused considerable controversy.|$|E
25|$|The <b>book</b> <b>is</b> <b>about</b> {{survival}} at {{all costs}} against a seemingly invincible foe. Shade's increasing lack of humanity is a constant threat to the reader and characters in the book. Ninde and Gold-Eye's growing relationship throughout the story is a touching account of love against adversity. In contrast to this, Drum and Ella are more serious about the situation they are in. However, they are constantly supporting each other and provide comfort {{at the end of}} the novel. Ella is a strong leader, yet her respect for her teammates, especially Ninde, grows considerably during the book's events. One interesting literary device are the interludes between the chapters. They add to the book's depth, provide the readers with extra information and sometimes reveal events elsewhere. For instance, when the Sub is attacked by creatures, the interlude is part of the training session for creature attacks. All interludes are taken from Shade's computer archive.|$|E

500|$|The Marriages Between Zones Three, Four and Five {{differs from}} the other books in the Canopus in Argos series in that it reads like a fable and {{is set in a}} metaphysical, or [...] "psychic" [...] space, outside the rest of the series' [...] "normal" [...] space/time universe. The story {{concerns}} two ordained marriages that link the patriarchal and militaristic Zone Four with the matriarchal and egalitarian Zone Three, and the tribal and barbaric Zone Five. It focuses on, what Time magazine reviewer Paul Gray calls, the [...] "struggles between men and women and the dimensions of sex and love". Literary critic Diana Sheets says that the <b>book</b> <b>is</b> <b>about</b> overcoming gender differences and opening up new possibilities. She argues that the premise of the story is that [...] "cosmic order is ideally realized when men and women cross the gender divide and attempt genuine communication—sexually, emotionally... thereby setting the preconditions for the attainment of enlightened consciousness." ...|$|E
500|$|His debut novel, the satirical De frafalnes klubb, was {{published}} in 1960. It tells a story of some disillusioned cynics in Paris who create a new philosophical and literary [...] "-ism," [...] which gains worldwide popularity. According to reviewer Brikt Jensen, Hambro offered a critique of [...] "the modern type of man [...] the first philosophical system that comes to his sight." [...] Jensen also commended Hambro for his [...] "un-Norwegian" [...] perspective, calling him a [...] "distinguished European." [...] The literary scholar Willy Dahl opined that the novel denoted Hambro's declared scepticism towards [...] "every sort of intellectual or political pigeonholing," [...] a scepticism that he shared with his father C. J. Hambro, whose disdain for radical and totalitarian ideologies was well known. The elder Hambro was also, according to literary scholar Per Thomas Andersen, vital for the next literary work of the younger Hambro: he provided biographical context for a trilogy comprising the novels Frels oss fra det gode (1963; [...] "Deliver us from the good"), Utfor stryket (1964; [...] "Down the River") and Vi vil oss en drøm (1966; [...] "We Want a Dream"), which describe the adolescence {{of a young man}} named Nico Dietmeyer. Living in the upper-class society of Western Oslo in the 1930s, Dietmeyer has an authoritarian father who commits adultery, despite emphasising decorum in his own moral system. The first of them was favourably reviewed by Brikt Jensen in Verdens Gang, who called it [...] "a declaration of love for Oslo"; reviewing for the same newspaper, Ragnhild Lorentzen gave the next novel a laudatory review, praising Hambro for having taken an important task upon his shoulders, whilst also criticising him for blurring the line between adolescence and adulthood. Dahl argues that these novels constitute an unpretentious, yet perspicacious criticism of conformity in that milieu, whilst Andersen considers them to be stories about double standards and liberation from one's own father. Rottem maintains that the novel is self-biographic, and that Hambro tries to polemize against the extramarital relationship that his father had with actress Gyda Christensen. 1966 proved to be a productive year for Hambro: he first contributed to the semi-pornographic literary collection Norske sengehester ("Norwegian Bedposts"), and subsequently, in September, delivered a vehement critique of the Norwegian education system in the pamphlet Er gymnasiaster mennesker?. The last novel of his trilogy about Nico Dietmeyer was released in November of the same year; Lorentzen considered {{the first part of the}} book to be somewhat verbose and anticipative, concluding her review by calling the novel an unoriginal yet well written book. In 1967 Hambro continued with Bjørnen sover ("The Bear Is Sleeping"), a marriage novel that disappointed the critics, before releasing his semantic and psycholinguistic study Ting, tanke, tale in 1969. The journalist Iver Tore Svenning recognized that work as one of the very few successful attempts at a popular scientific treatment of structural linguistics, a view supported by Dahl. Hambro's last novels were Nødhavn ("Harbour of Refuge") and Lekkasje ("Leakage"), released in 1971 and 1974. The former <b>book</b> <b>is</b> <b>about</b> a love affair between an erstwhile cultural radical and a young woman with aggressive political opinions. The affair makes, according to Dahl, the cultural radical think about his nonconformist past, yet he abandons it, and seeks safety in the bourgeoisie class.|$|E

2500|$|The book {{states that}} it is [...] "a {{codification}} of the present-day general parliamentary law".

In other words, the <b>book</b> <b>is</b> <b>about</b> procedures for meetings and not about what is [...] "legal" [...] (i.e. {{it is not a}} law book).|$|E
