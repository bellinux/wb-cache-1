5|$|The Hammond organ's {{technology}} {{derives from}} the Telharmonium, an instrument created in 1897 by Thaddeus Cahill. The telharmonium used revolving electric alternators which generated tones that could be transmitted over wires. The instrument was bulky, because the alternators had to {{be large enough to}} generate high voltage for a loud enough signal. The Hammond organ solved this problem <b>by</b> <b>using</b> <b>an</b> amplifier.|$|E

40|$|Key words: Speaking, a Series and Single Picture media 	Speaking {{is one of}} {{important}} skills in learning language especially English. It is much needed for students of English Education in university level because {{in the process of}} teaching and learning the lecturer always asks them to give opinions. Therefore, the learners should master it. To make them easy to express their ideas orally in teaching learning process, the researcher <b>uses</b> <b>a</b> series and single picture as media in speaking teaching learning process. The problem of the study are: (1) how is the student score in speaking taught <b>by</b> <b>using</b> <b>a</b> series picture?, (2) how is student score in speaking taught <b>by</b> <b>using</b> <b>a</b> single picture?, and (3) which media are more effective to improve the students’ ability in speaking. The purposes of this research are: (1) to know the students’ score in speaking taught <b>by</b> <b>using</b> <b>a</b> series picture, (2) to know the students’ score in speaking taught <b>by</b> <b>using</b> <b>a</b> single picture and (3) to know which media are more effective to improve the students’ ability in speaking. 	The design of the research is the comparative study. The samples that the researcher used are 31 students. To get the sample the researcher <b>uses</b> <b>a</b> random sample. To obtain the research data the researcher uses test. Whereas, to find out a significant different score on the students’ speaking when they are taught <b>by</b> <b>using</b> <b>a</b> series picture and when they are taught <b>by</b> <b>using</b> <b>a</b> single picture, the researcher uses t-test formula. The result of data analysis shows that the student’s score taught <b>by</b> <b>using</b> <b>a</b> series picture is bigger than taught <b>by</b> <b>using</b> <b>a</b> single picture. Based on statistical analysis shows that (8, 846 > 2, 042). It means that there is a significant influence between score of teaching <b>by</b> <b>using</b> <b>a</b> series picture and <b>by</b> <b>using</b> <b>a</b> single picture. It can be concluded that the students get good scores in achieving speaking after taught <b>by</b> <b>using</b> <b>a</b> series picture. The students speaking improve significantly so, teaching speaking <b>by</b> <b>using</b> <b>a</b> series picture is effective to improve students’ achievement on speaking. Therefore, it can be used as one of reference media to teach English especially speaking...|$|R
5|$|If non-surgical {{measures}} are unsuccessful, drilling {{may be considered}} to stimulate healing of the subchondral bone. Arthroscopic drilling may be performed <b>by</b> <b>using</b> <b>an</b> antegrade (from the front) approach from the joint space through the articular cartilage, or by using a retrograde (from behind) approach through the bone outside of the joint to avoid penetration of the articular cartilage. This has proven successful with positive results at one-year follow-up with antegrade drilling in nine out of eleven teenagers with the juvenile form of OCD, and in 18 of 20 skeletally immature people (follow-up of five years) who had failed prior conservative programs.|$|E
5|$|In general relativity, the apsides of any orbit (the {{point of}} the {{orbiting}} body's closest approach to the system's center of mass) will precess—the orbit is not an ellipse, but akin to an ellipse that rotates on its focus, resulting in a rose curve-like shape (see image). Einstein first derived this result <b>by</b> <b>using</b> <b>an</b> approximate metric representing the Newtonian limit and treating the orbiting body as a test particle. For him, {{the fact that his}} theory gave a straightforward explanation of Mercury's anomalous perihelion shift, discovered earlier by Urbain Le Verrier in 1859, was important evidence that he had at last identified the correct form of the gravitational field equations.|$|E
5|$|In {{professional}} concert {{sound system}} design, subwoofers {{can be incorporated}} seamlessly with the main speakers into a stereo or mono full-range system <b>by</b> <b>using</b> <b>an</b> active crossover. Such a system receives its signal from the main mono or stereo mixing console mix bus and amplifies all frequencies together in the desired balance. If the main sound system is stereo, the subwoofers can also be in stereo. Otherwise, a mono subwoofer channel can be derived within the crossover from a stereo mix, depending on the crossover make and model.|$|E

The Coin Launcher is a machine that uses coins as projectiles to shoot trophies and counter incoming dangers such as missiles. Coins {{can also be used}} to bet on the victor of online battles via Spectator mode. Trophies unavailable in Coin Launcher mode are obtained <b>by</b> <b>using</b> <b>an</b> item called the Trophy Stand on weakened enemy characters and bosses within The Subspace Emissary. Trophies obtained in this manner may contain information on the backstory of the Subspace Emissary.|$|E

On April 30, 2009 on the Late Show with David Letterman, the cast recreated a performance on the same stage at the Ed Sullivan Theater by the original tribe. The production won the Tony Award for Best Revival of a Musical, the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Revival of a Musical and the Drama League Award for Distinguished Revival of a Musical. By August 2009, the revival had recouped its entire $5,760,000 investment, becoming one of the fastest-recouping musicals in Broadway history. Its cast album was nominated for the 2010 Grammy Award for Best Musical Show Album.|$|E

5|$|The game {{incorporates}} {{an inventory}} system for items that Sam picks {{up during the}} course of the game. Items can be used on other entities in the game world, or can often be combined with other inventory items to provide a new object necessary for solving a puzzle. Although Max's character will walk around the game's areas by his own will, Sam can also use Max at various points <b>by</b> <b>using</b> <b>an</b> inventory icon of Max's head on game objects—usually on characters where the solution to a problem involves violence. Sam and Max travel to different locations in the game using their black and white 1960 DeSoto Adventurer, which when clicked on in-game will present a map of the United States with all the available locations the pair can travel to shown. As the game progresses, the number of locations on the map increases.|$|E
5|$|The player's primary mode of {{transportation}} is a starship which serves as Shepard's base of operations. Aboard the ship, the player can interact with the squad members, buy new equipment, and travel to numerous planetary systems. Although the game features {{a large number of}} planets for the player to examine, only a few of them can actually be landed on and explored. Some of them can also be surveyed to search for valuable resources and quest-relevant items. Upon landing on a planet, the player can traverse on-foot or <b>by</b> <b>using</b> <b>an</b> all-terrain infantry fighting vehicle called the M35 Mako. Most of the game's main quests are geared toward on-foot combat, but some segments may feature combat requiring the use of the M35 Mako. In contrast, secondary quests usually require the player to explore free-roam uncharted worlds with the vehicle. Equipment items, which include armor, weapon, and ammunition upgrades, can be found around the environment or purchased from merchants in settlements.|$|E
