5|$|A.coccinea {{closely resembles}} A.arachnoidea, <b>but</b> <b>may</b> be {{distinguished}} from the latter by its bright red arms, and its larger spores (4–5 by 2.5–3μm in A.coccinea compared with 2.5–3.5 by 1.5μm in A.arachnoidea). A.arachnoidea is known from Asia and West Africa. A.rubra is a relatively common pantropical species, and differs from A.coccinea in its reddish receptacle (compared with pink to cream-colored in A.coccinea) and bifurcating arms that are typically multichambered.|$|E

5|$|After {{the active}} {{portion of a}} seizure (the ictal state) there is {{typically}} a period of recovery during which there is confusion, {{referred to as the}} postictal period before a normal level of consciousness returns. It usually lasts 3 to 15 minutes <b>but</b> <b>may</b> last for hours. Other common symptoms include feeling tired, headache, difficulty speaking, and abnormal behavior. Psychosis after a seizure is relatively common, occurring in 6–10% of people. Often people do not remember what happened during this time. Localized weakness, known as Todd's paralysis, may also occur after a focal seizure. When it occurs it typically lasts for seconds to minutes <b>but</b> <b>may</b> rarely last for a day or two.|$|E

5|$|As a batsman, Macaulay was {{reasonably}} good and possibly {{better than his}} statistics would suggest. He was capable of batting well in a crisis <b>but</b> <b>may</b> have been prevented from honing his batting skills by the Yorkshire leadership who wished him to focus on bowling. He generally batted low down in the order after the all-rounders in the team. Macaulay's fielding was also very effective. He was excellent at close range to the batsmen, particularly from his own bowling.|$|E
5|$|B.sessilis var. sessilis is an autonym that {{encompasses}} the type material of the species. This {{is the most}} widespread variety, occurring from Regans Ford and Moora in the north, south-east to Albany, and inland as far as Wongan Hills, Pingelly and Kulin. Its blue-green leaves are cuneate (wedge-shaped) or oblong, and are usually two to three centimetres long <b>but</b> <b>may</b> reach five.|$|E

5|$|Beetle {{antennae}} {{are primarily}} organs of sensory perception and can detect motion, odour and chemical substances, <b>but</b> <b>may</b> {{also be used}} to physically feel a beetle's environment.

5|$|Both species {{live on the}} ground, {{are active}} during the night, are solitary, and feed mainly on fruits and seeds, <b>but</b> <b>may</b> also eat herbs and insects. They build nests of leaves and {{branches}} among vegetation, for example in a tree hollow, or under rocks. In Panama, T.talamancae breeds throughout the year and the average litter size is about six. Various species of mites, chiggers, fleas, and sucking lice have been recorded as parasites on both species.|$|E
