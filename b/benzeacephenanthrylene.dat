50|$|<b>Benzeacephenanthrylene</b> is {{an organic}} {{compound}} with the chemical formula C20H12. It is a {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon}} (PAH) made of four benzene rings around a 5-membered ring.|$|E
50|$|On February 22, 2014, NASA {{announced}} a greatly upgraded database for detecting and monitoring {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAHs), including <b>benzeacephenanthrylene</b> (as benzobfluoranthene, a synonym), in the universe. According to NASA scientists, over 20% of the carbon in the universe {{may be associated with}} PAHs, possible starting materials for the formation of life. PAHs seem to have been formed shortly after the Big Bang, are abundant in the universe, and are associated with new stars and exoplanets.|$|E
