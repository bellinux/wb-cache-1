5|$|The Beautiful Garbage tour {{started in}} earnest in January 2002 in New Zealand and Australia, when Garbage joined the <b>Big</b> <b>Day</b> Out festival. In between the festival shows, Garbage headlined two concerts in Melbourne and Sydney. Garbage then spent ten days in Japan, {{performing}} four headline shows in Osaka and Tokyo.|$|E
5|$|The White Stripes {{postponed}} the Japanese leg {{of their}} world tour after Jack strained his vocal cords, with doctors recommending that Jack not sing or talk for two weeks. After a full recovery, {{he returned to the}} stage in Auckland, New Zealand to headline the <b>Big</b> <b>Day</b> Out tour.|$|E
5|$|Various music festivals {{are held}} on Australia Day, {{such as the}} <b>Big</b> <b>Day</b> Out, the Triple J Hottest 100, and the Australia Day Live Concert which is {{televised}} nationally.

5|$|Formed in 1994, Limp Bizkit {{became popular}} {{playing in the}} Jacksonville, Florida {{underground}} music scene in the late 1990s, and signed with Flip Records, a subsidiary of Interscope, which released their debut album, Three Dollar Bill, Y'all$ (1997). The band achieved mainstream success with their second and third studio albums, Significant Other (1999) and Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water (2000), although this success was marred {{by a series of}} controversies surrounding their performances at Woodstock '99 and the 2001 <b>Big</b> <b>Day</b> Out festival.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the success}} of Moo, You Bloody Choir, much of Augie March's post-album touring {{involved}} supporting other bands. They played shows supporting The Aliens and Andrew Bird in the United States, before returning to Australia to open for Crowded House. Richards said the band's status as an opening act, rather than headlining their own shows, was something they saw as a challenge—their intention was to win over fans who {{came to see the}} main act. However, he called the tour with The Aliens depressing; the bands played very different types of music, and the attendance at shows was small. Augie March later earned a prime slot at the 2008 <b>Big</b> <b>Day</b> Out.|$|E
5|$|From January to June 2007, {{the band}} toured the United States, Europe, Canada, and Australia, {{including}} a headline slot on the UK's Give It A Name festival {{and playing the}} main stage at The Bamboozle festival. Despite the band's reluctance towards the press {{around the time of}} the release of the album, they were featured in Alternative Press, a cover story for Rock Sound, Kerrang!, and NME. The band went on tour for the fall of 2007, with openers Thrice and MewithoutYou. In early 2008, Brand New toured Australia and New Zealand on the <b>Big</b> <b>Day</b> Out festival.|$|E

5|$|Success exposed TISM to {{mainstream}} Australian radio and television, {{most of which}} was perplexed by the band's guerrilla approach to interviews and {{lack of interest in}} the music industry. A four CD box set of early albums was released and steady record sales allowed extensive tours of Australia and New Zealand. In 1996 TISM toured on the <b>Big</b> <b>Day</b> Out, during which Ron Hitler-Barassi was either absent or wheelchair-bound due to a detached retina and broken arm caused by a stage dive he performed at the Pacific Hotel, Lorne, Victoria prior to the tour. Later the same year, TISM toured England, the group's sole Northern Hemisphere excursion.|$|E
5|$|To promote Since I Left You the Avalanches {{organised}} {{their first}} Australian head-lining tour in October 2000 planning {{to head to}} all the capital cities. All dates on the tour were sold out. In their Brisbane show, Seltmann broke his leg in an on-stage collision with bass guitarist and singer, Tony Di Blasi. In January–February 2001, the Avalanches toured with the <b>Big</b> <b>Day</b> Out festival in Australia, visiting four capital cities. While on tour in Europe, Seltmann broke his other leg, thereafter {{the rest of the}} tour's shows were DJ sets. The British dance music magazine Muzik awarded the Avalanches as best live act.|$|E
5|$|Arcade Fire {{began their}} tour {{in support of}} the album in January and February 2007, playing a series of concerts at churches and other small venues in Ottawa, Montreal, London and New York. This was {{followed}} by a 23 date European tour in March and early April, though the last 9 dates of this were cancelled due to illness. The first North American leg of the tour began April 26 in San Diego and April 28 at Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival and contained 26 dates. This leg contained openings by The National, St. Vincent, and Electrelane. The band then began an 11-date European leg at Glastonbury Festival on June 22 before returning to North America for 10 more LCD Soundsystem-supported dates beginning September 15 at Austin City Limits. The Neon Bible tour continued with 14 more dates in Europe between October 25 and November 19, and six dates beginning January 18, 2008 in Australia and New Zealand as part of the <b>Big</b> <b>Day</b> Out festival. The tour then ended after three more shows from February 7 in Japan.|$|E

5|$|Max bumps into Niall Rafferty (Barry Sloane) in {{the village}} and tells him that his wedding with Steph is back on. Niall is devastated but tries to remain {{composed}} in front of Max. Steph has big plans for her wedding day and it looks as if it’s getting out of control as Jack worries about how much it's going to cost, with Jack even suggesting to Frankie and Steph that he should call Johnno and ask him to contribute to the cost of the wedding, a suggestion that Steph and Frankie refute immediately on the basis that Johnno was never very good with money, and also that he was now married to Michelle and was therefore preoccupied with bringing up his new son Presley. With only 48 hours until their <b>big</b> <b>day</b> everything starts to go wrong and when Steph accidentally rips her wedding dress it's the final straw. A devastated Steph announces there's no way the wedding can go ahead on Thursday.|$|E

On November 15, 2013, drummer Matt Cameron announced {{that he would not be}} touring with Soundgarden in 2014, due to prior commitments promoting Lightning Bolt. On December 13, 2013, the band announced an eleven-date European leg starting on June 16, 2014. In May 2014, the band announced a ten-date tour of the American Midwest starting on October 1, 2014, to coincide with two appearances at the Austin City Limits Music Festival.

In March 2015 the band announced a nine-date tour of Latin America, scheduled to start in November.|$|E

25|$|In early November in 2011, {{ahead of}} the 2012 <b>Big</b> <b>Day</b> Out, a request was made by Auckland City Council to remove Odd Future from line up due to some of their lyrics being {{allegedly}} homophobic.
