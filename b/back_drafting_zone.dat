Based on the {{physical}} properties of Ni-Fe fiber, the orthogonal design was adopted to determine the parameters including roving twist, <b>back</b> <b>zone</b> <b>drafting</b> multiple and yarn twist, and the strength and wear resistance of the produced five kinds of yarns were tested and analyzed. The results show that {{to solve the problem}} of mixing uniformity of Ni-Fe Fibers, the suitable drawing numbers can be adopted. And the appropriate roving twist, spinning <b>back</b> <b>zone</b> <b>drafting</b> multiple and yarn twist are key factor of resultant yarn...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: To {{improve the}} yarn quality, the {{pressure}} bar {{was installed in}} the break <b>drafting</b> <b>zone</b> of the INA-V spinning frame. The process parameters were optimized in the break <b>drafting</b> <b>zone</b> with pressure bar of the INA-V spinning frame, the drafting principle in the break <b>drafting</b> <b>zone</b> with pressure bar of INA-V spinning frame was analyzed, and the sliver configuration was observed in the break <b>drafting</b> <b>zone</b> with pressure bar. The result revealed that installed the pressure bar in break <b>drafting</b> <b>zone</b> after, when the roving twist factor was small, CV%, thinness, thickness and neps of the yarn spun decrease as the break drafting ratio increase; when the twist factor of roving was larger, the break draft ratio as 1. 3 time was optimum drafting conditions. The yarn quality was improved as roving twist increased...|$|R

The aim of the study is to identify feasible ways of utilising computational fluid dynamic software to assist in the development of cookstove designs. In light of this, a holistic understanding of the present situation in Nepal has been sought after. The Nepali Insert Stove design was selected for CFD simulation and analysis. Once the effects of natural convection and turbulence throughout the model were accounted for, the process of optimising the design with a goal of reducing the amount of smoke <b>back</b> <b>drafted</b> from the stove’s front door, was investigated. An optimum baffle angle of 40 ° was found to induce the smallest amount of smoke <b>back</b> <b>drafted</b> into the room where the stove would be located.
