[...] In the first stanza he is saying you're too good for me, so I understand {{if you want to}} get rid of me. [...] In the second stanza he is saying that I am nowhere close to good enough for you, <b>but</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> are not aware of it. [...] And in the third stanza he is saying you are too good for me, <b>but</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> didn't realize that before. [...] In the closing couplet, Shakespeare confesses that no matter what the cause of misjudgment, you're released by the mistake, and [...] "I'm left here to remember our time together" [...] when I felt like nobility.|$|E
2500|$|Billy Corgan {{has said}} that he was {{inspired}} to write a story based 'the Fool's Journey' from the Tarot. [...] Corgan has explained his interpretation of this view: [...] "There's childlike innocence when you just don't really know anything in the world and it all seems sort of big and magical...the teen, aware but not really liking what's going on...the third person that's cynical, where you get kind of bitter because you feel so small and there's all these things that are sort of happening and there's not much you can do about it...the fourth stage out of that would be finding a sort of spiritual place within yourself where you can live in reality, you can see it for what it is, <b>but</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> can find a deeper source of inspiration and peace." [...] In other words, the album finds Corgan [...] "looking past, present and future {{all at the same time}} and trying to have that perspective".|$|E

6000|$|If {{we could}} get Mary Boyle, we would do [...] "Used Up," [...] which is a {{delightful}} piece, as the farce. <b>But</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> know nothing about the said Mary, {{and in that case}} I should like to know what you would think of doing.|$|E

Why, sir, if you'll believe me, there's not one in a hundred that comes to this church that ever 'eard of Pepys. [...] "Pepys!" [...] says they. [...] "'Oo's Pepys?"

2500|$|Rollins {{said that}} he had {{conducted}} a thorough internal investigation into Harris's ties to MZM in hopes of finding conclusive proof of her innocence; but when he could not, he and other advisers, including her lawyer, urged her to drop her candidacy rather than risk federal corruption charges. Although he did not believe Harris intentionally broke any laws, [...] "her story kept changing. Our great concern was that you get into trouble when you don't tell the same story twice ... <b>Maybe</b> <b>you</b> don't think you did anything wrong, <b>but</b> then <b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> start getting questioned about it and so forth, and you may perjure yourself. ... Unlike Cunningham, I don't think she set out to violate the law, but I think she was very careless. She heard whatever she wanted to hear, but we could find no evidence whatsoever that this was a project going into her district." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you don't}} know why Lynde is acting so, I can't tell you, for I don't know either. I don't {{even know if}} she is angry. I only thought perhaps she was--that you had done or said {{something}} to vex her--plaguing {{her to go to}} church <b>maybe.</b> <b>But</b> if <b>you</b> didn't, it may not be anger at all. I don't understand that girl. She's been different ever since her mother died. She used to tell me everything before that. You must go and ask her right out yourself what is wrong. <b>But</b> <b>maybe</b> I can tell you something. Did you write her a letter a fortnight ago?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "In common cases," [...] said she, [...] "this might all {{be put off}} till we got somewhere; but it won't do now. Here you are, with everythin' in {{your own}} hands, but just get away from here, and there's an end of that. She's as pretty a girl as you'll see in a month of Sundays, and if she leaves here without your gettin' her, there's no knowing who'll snap her up. When we've got to that island, you may see her once a week, <b>but</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> won't. She may go away in one ship, and you in another, {{and there may be}} {{somebody}} right there--a missionary, for all I know--who'll have her before {{you have a chance to}} put in a word." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} don't. <b>But</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> will after I've told my story. As you know, I went to Wichita Falls mainly {{to get the}} {{documents}} which Lorimer Spell had stored away in the safe deposit vault of a bank there. Well, I got the documents, and in looking them over found that while Lorimer Spell's claim to the land seemed to be fairly well established, still there {{was something of a}} cloud to the title--the cloud of which Carson Davenport and his crowd are taking advantage. But more than that, I found that a firm of oil experts named Fitch and Lunberry had gone over the property both for Spell and for an oil promoter who had thought to put some money into operations there. So then I called on the firm and had a long talk with Mr. Fitch." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 26. I was to {{wish the}} Duke of Ormond a happy Christmas, and give half a crown to his porter. It will cost me a dozen half-crowns among such fellows. I dined with Lord Treasurer, who chid {{me for being}} absent three days. Mighty kind, with a p--; less of civility, and more of his interest! We hear Maccartney is gone over to Ireland. Was it not comical for a gentleman to be set upon by highwaymen, and to tell them he was Maccartney? Upon which they brought him to a justice of peace, in hopes of the reward,(19) and the rogues were sent to gaol. Was it not great {{presence}} of mind? <b>But</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> heard this already; for there was a Grub Street of it. Lord Bolingbroke told me I must walk away to-day when dinner was done, because Lord Treasurer, and he, and another, were to enter upon business; but I said it was as fit I should know their business as anybody, for I was to justify (it).(20) So the rest went, and I stayed, {{and it was so}} important, I was like to sleep over it. I left them at nine, and it is now twelve. Nite, MD.|$|E
6000|$|Always Babson kept up his ejaculations and fidgeting. He often accused {{himself of}} shiftlessness and begged {{her to make}} sure that he {{dictated}} certain matter before he escaped for the evening. [...] "Come in and bother the life out of me.

I refuse to be tempted yet; I am a busy man. <b>But</b> <b>maybe</b> I'll give <b>you</b> those verbal jewels of great price on your next visitation, oh thou in the vocative--some Latin scholar, eh?

5000|$|Byrne's {{response}} to her critics is often a reminder of free will: [...] "I am not here to force anyone to believe, or {{say you have to}} listen, <b>but</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> should listen to me and open to the possibility that you really do have a guardian angel." ...|$|E
5000|$|It is {{told that}} at one battle Gustavus Adolphus sent Torstensson with an order {{to one of the}} officers. On his way Torstensson noticed that the enemy had changed {{position}} and altered the King's orders. Gustavus noticed the new development.

40|$|All of {{the senses}} are {{important}} when eating. Think about eating a potato chip – fi rst you see the chip (<b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> notice if it has any dark/burnt spots?).

Or the oil it was fried or baked in?), then you eat it and hear the crunch of the chip, and you probably also taste the saltiness (<b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> also experience some additional fl avor?). Imagine if {{any one of these}} experiences was missing – would a chip be the same if you didn’t hear it crunch in your mouth...|$|R

5000|$|Tyler {{began working}} with German {{producer}} Dieter Bohlen in 1991. She was reluctant to record Bohlen's songs at first, having been used to recording rock music. He was able to persuade Tyler, remarking, [...] "you've made your rock music for years, <b>but</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> {{just have to be}} a bit more commercial." [...] Bohlen was inspired by Rod Stewart's success with [...] "Rhythm of My Heart", which was released in early 1991. In an attempt to emulate that, he wrote five songs for Bitterblue with elements of Scottish folk music, including instruments such as bagpipes and accordion.|$|E
5000|$|Roger Ebert, {{gave the}} film two stars out of four, writing: You {{will find the}} movie tiresomely twee, and notice that it {{obviously}} thinks it is being funny at times when {{you do not have}} the slightest clue why that should be. You will hear dialogue that preserves the content of written humor at the cost of sounding as if the characters are holding a Douglas Adams reading ... I do not get the joke. I do not much want to get the joke, <b>but</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> will ... To me it got old fairly quickly. The movie was more of a revue than a narrative, more about moments than an organising purpose.|$|E
