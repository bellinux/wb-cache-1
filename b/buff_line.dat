5000|$|As {{built the}} {{standard}} cars were painted in a Tuscan Red and Russet with yellow pin striping. In the 1940's it {{was changed to}} Tuscan Red with <b>Buff</b> <b>lining.</b> In 1957 the scheme was changed to plain Tuscan Red, of which lots of cars retained until withdrawal. From 1973 they were repainted in the Public Transport Commission blue and white livery before this was superseded by Indian Red in 1976. The original cream and brown interiors were repainted in two-tone green, however not all cars received this. Overhauls of the stock continued up until 1988, with some receiving sliding aluminium Beclawat windows to alleviate rust problems. Some cars also received [...] "Airmate" [...] Pantographs replacing the original Doorman Long Pantographs, but few received this.|$|R
50|$|With {{the planned}} {{opening of the}} Sydney {{underground}} lines and electrification, it was proposed to build steel bodied suburban cars. As no such cars were built in Australia before, an initial 50 cars (numbered 3101-3150) were built by the Leeds Forge Company in England and assembled at Eveleigh Carriage Workshops. Some of these cars were briefly used in steam-hauled service during 1925 as EFA cars 2213 to 2262 before conversion to electric traction. C3101 was used in initial trials with Wooden driving trailer D4001 {{before the start of}} electric services in March, 1926. After 1976, C3102 was the oldest electric car in service and was specially painted in 1940's livery with <b>buff</b> <b>lining</b> until its retirement in 1989. This car is now preserved by RailCorp.|$|R

500|$|Canadian {{historians have}} treated Benedict Arnold as a {{relatively}} minor figure. His difficult time in New Brunswick led historians to summarize it as full of [...] "controversy, resentment, and legal entanglements" [...] and to conclude that he was disliked by both Americans and Loyalists. Historian Barry Wilson points out that Arnold's descendants ended up establishing deep roots in the country, becoming leading settlers in Upper Canada and later in lands further west, where they established settlements in Saskatchewan. His descendants who adopted the Arnold surname are spread across Canada, most of all those of John Sage. His long woollen British scarlet military jacket with a <b>buff</b> <b>lining</b> continues to be owned by descendants; as of 2001, it was held in Saskatchewan. It has reportedly been passed in each generation to the eldest male of the family.|$|R

5000|$|In 1667 the Holland Regiment is {{recorded}} as wearing [...] "red jackets lined with yellow". Subsequently, Nathan Brook's Army List of 1684 referred to [...] "Coated red, lined with a flesh colour". This {{marked the beginning}} of the historic association of the regiment with buff facings (a dull-yellow colour). A notice in the London Gazette of 21 January 1685 describing the clothing of three deserters from what was still the Holland Regiment, referred for the first time to the colour buff:"a new Red Coat lin'd with a <b>Buff</b> colour'd <b>lining,</b> surtout Sleeves, cross Pockets with three scallops, large plain pewter Buttons, Breeches of ths same colour as the Coat lining".|$|R
