Invasive organisms <b>brought</b> <b>by</b> extraterrestrial civilizations could cause great ecological harm because of the terrestrial biosphere's lack of defenses against them.|$|E

5|$|Horses {{have been}} present in the American West since the 1500s, when they arrived with Spanish explorers. Many escaped, were {{released}} by the Spanish or stolen by Native Americans. Their descendents crossed with horses who escaped from or were released by other European settlers, including draft breeds <b>brought</b> <b>by</b> farmers and wagoneers and lighter riding horses <b>brought</b> <b>by</b> the United States Cavalry. Horses of French descent also moved {{across the border from}} Canada to contribute to the herds. The mixture of these breeds created the Mustang present in the western portion of the US today. By the early 1970s, it was assumed that due to crossbreeding, the original Spanish stock had been eliminated from feral herds. In 1971, the Wild and Free-Roaming Horse and Burro Act was passed, giving the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) the authority to manage the feral horse populations in the American West.|$|E
