As a first step towards implementation of a universal <b>screening</b> <b>method</b> across all emergency departments, we assessed the currently used <b>screening</b> <b>methods.</b> To {{provide an overview of}} the <b>screening</b> <b>methods</b> for child maltreatment across all emergency departments in the Netherlands and to assess their empirical substantiation. We surveyed all emergency departments in the Netherlands using a questionnaire on <b>screening</b> <b>methods.</b> All <b>screening</b> checklists used in emergency departments were assembled and compared with the literature. 85 hospitals with an emergency department were approached, 80 of which completed the questionnaire and 77 provided copies of their screening checklists. All participating hospitals use a screening checklist, 41 % a screening physical examination, 60 % a screening based on parental risk factors and 3 % a retrospective review of all charts. The empirical substantiation for these <b>screening</b> <b>methods</b> is largely lacking, and at least 73 % of the hospitals use a checklist that has not been reported in the literature.

The {{aim of this}} study was to determine the extraction recovery of a wide variety of common environmental micropollutants (eg, pesticides, pharmaceuticals, hormones and industrial compounds) using a variety of solid phase extraction (SPE) materials. Commonly used liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) techniques were also compared. The results show that hydrophilic-lipophilic balanced (HLB) SPE cartridges in particular provide good recovery of a wide range of compounds. A method combining an Oasis HLB cartridge with a Supelco coconut charcoal cartridge produced an average extraction efficiency of 89 - 93 % with more than 92 - 95 % of the compounds recovered from spiked drinking and river water samples.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} effort was to explore the usefulness of a new saliency metric in a new saliency <b>screening</b> <b>method.</b> The new metric, the SN saliency metric, is based upon signal-to-noise ratios and incorporates the neural network's treatment of a reference noise feature into the calculation. The SN saliency metric, in turn, was used in a new saliency <b>screening</b> <b>method,</b> the SN saliency <b>screening</b> <b>method,</b> which attempts to identify salient features in one <b>screening</b> run. This <b>method</b> actually interrupts the screening run at certain intervals, determines the least salient feature, removes that feature and continues the screening run.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Laboratory-based {{measures}} {{provide an}} accurate method to identify {{risk factors for}} anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury; however, these methods are generally prohibitive to the wider community. <b>Screening</b> <b>methods</b> that can be completed in a field or clinical setting may be more applicable for wider community use. Examination of field-based <b>screening</b> <b>methods</b> for ACL injury risk can aid in identifying the most applicable method(s) for use in these settings. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate and compare field-based <b>screening</b> <b>methods</b> for ACL injury risk to determine their efficacy of use in wider community settings. DATA SOURCES: An electronic database search {{was conducted on the}} SPORTDiscus™, MEDLINE, AMED and CINAHL databases (January 1990 -July 2015) using a combination of relevant keywords. A secondary search of the same databases, using relevant keywords from identified <b>screening</b> <b>methods,</b> was also undertaken. STUDY SELECTION: Studies identified as potentially relevant were independently examined by two reviewers for inclusion. Where consensus could not be reached, a third reviewer was consulted. Original research articles that examined <b>screening</b> <b>methods</b> for ACL injury risk that could be undertaken outside of a laboratory setting were included for review. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: Two reviewers independently assessed the quality of included studies. Included studies were categorized according to the <b>screening</b> <b>method</b> they examined. A description of each <b>screening</b> <b>method,</b> and data pertaining to the ability to prospectively identify ACL injuries, validity and reliability, recommendations for identifying 2 ̆ 7 at-risk 2 ̆ 7 athletes, equipment and training required to complete screening, time taken to screen athletes, and applicability of the <b>screening</b> <b>method</b> across sports and athletes were extracted from relevant studies. RESULTS: Of 1077 citations from the initial search, a total of 25 articles were identified as potentially relevant, with 12 meeting all inclusion/exclusion criteria. From the secondary search, eight further studies met all criteria, resulting in 20 studies being included for review. Five ACL-screening methods-the Landing Error Scoring System (LESS), Clinic-Based Algorithm, Observational Screening of Dynamic Knee Valgus (OSDKV), 2 D-Cam Method, and Tuck Jump Assessment-were identified. There was limited evidence supporting the use of field-based <b>screening</b> <b>methods</b> in predicting ACL injuries across a range of populations. Differences relating to the equipment and time required to complete <b>screening</b> <b>methods</b> were identified. LIMITATIONS: Only <b>screening</b> <b>methods</b> for ACL injury risk were included for review. Field-based <b>screening</b> <b>methods</b> developed for lower-limb injury risk in general may also incorporate, and be useful in, screening for ACL injury risk. CONCLUSIONS: Limited studies were available relating to the OSDKV and 2 D-Cam Method. The LESS showed predictive validity in identifying ACL injuries, however only in a youth athlete population. The LESS also appears practical for community-wide use due to the minimal equipment and set-up/analysis time required. The Clinic-Based Algorithm may have predictive value for ACL injury risk as it identifies athletes who exhibit high frontal plane knee loads during a landing task, but requires extensive additional equipment and time, which may limit its application to wider community settings...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to develop an evidence-based vascular assessment method to guide podiatrists’ decision-making processes to aid in timely vascular assessment in at risk populations. Method: The sample underwent brachial pressure measurement, ankle pressures, toe pressure and Doppler waveform with colour duplex ultrasound (CFDU) used as the reference standard. Both the targeted <b>screening</b> <b>method</b> and the American Heart Association (AHA) guideline for vascular screening were then applied to the data set and sensitivity and specificity of each method was calculated.

40|$|International audienceScreening {{methods are}} used as a {{first-line}} approach to detect the presence of antibiotic residues in food of animal origin. The validation process guarantees that the method is fit-for-purpose, suited to regulatory requirements, and provides evidence of its performance. This article is focused on intra-laboratory validation. The first step in validation is characterisation of performance, and the second step is the validation itself with regard to pre-established criteria. The validation approaches can be absolute (a single method) or relative (comparison of methods), overall (combination of several characteristics in one) or criterion-by-criterion. Various approaches to validation, {{in the form of}} regulations, guidelines or standards, are presented and discussed to draw conclusions on their potential application for different residue <b>screening</b> <b>methods,</b> and {{to determine whether or not}} they reach the same conclusions. The approach by comparison of methods is not suitable for <b>screening</b> <b>methods</b> for antibiotic residues. The overall approaches, such as probability of detection (POD) and accuracy profile, are increasingly used in other fields of application. They may be of interest for <b>screening</b> <b>methods</b> for antibiotic residues. Finally, the criterion-by-criterion approach (Decision 2002 / 657 /EC and of European guideline for the validation of <b>screening</b> <b>methods),</b> usually applied to the <b>screening</b> <b>methods</b> for antibiotic residues, introduced a major characteristic and an improvement in the validation, i. e. the detection capability (CCbeta).

Considering the high prevalence of culture-negative specimens, any method that identifies such specimens is of interest. The aim was to evaluate a new screening concept for flow cytometry analysis (FCA). The outcomes were evaluated against urine culture, uropathogen species and three conventional <b>screening</b> <b>methods.</b> A prospective, consecutive study examined 1, 312 urine specimens, collected during January and February 2012. The specimens were analyzed using the Sysmex UF 1000 i FCA. Based on the FCA data culture negative specimens were identified in a new model by use of linear discriminant analysis (FCA-LDA). In total 1, 312 patients were included. In- and outpatients represented 19. 6 % and 79. 4 %, respectively; 68. 3 % of the specimens originated from women. Of the 610 culture-positive specimens, Escherichia coli represented 64 %, enterococci 8 % and Klebsiella spp. 7 %. Screening with FCA-LDA at 95 % sensitivity identified 42 % (552 / 1312) as culture negative specimens when UTI was defined according to European guidelines. The proposed <b>screening</b> <b>method</b> was either superior or similar in comparison to the three conventional <b>screening</b> <b>methods.</b> In conclusion, the proposed/suggested and new FCA-LDA <b>screening</b> <b>method</b> was superior or similar to three conventional <b>screening</b> <b>methods.</b> We recommend the proposed <b>screening</b> <b>method</b> to be used in clinic to exclude culture negative specimens, to reduce workload, costs and the turnaround time.

The substantial life-safety goal is deemed to be satisfied if the extent of structural damage or nonstructural component damage does not pose a significant risk to human life. The screening is limited to Performance Category (PC) - 0, - 1, and - 2 buildings and structures. Because of their higher performance objectives, PC- 3 and PC- 4 buildings automatically fail the LANL Seismic <b>Screening</b> <b>Method</b> and will be subject to a more detailed seismic analysis. The Laboratory has also designated that PC- 0, PC- 1, and PC- 2 unreinforced masonry bearing wall and masonry infill shear wall buildings fail the LANL Seismic <b>Screening</b> <b>Method</b> because of their historically poor seismic performance or complex behavior. These building types are also recommended for a more detailed seismic analysis. The results of the LANL Seismic <b>Screening</b> <b>Method</b> are expressed in terms of separate scores for potential configuration or physical hazards (Phase One) and calculated capacity/demand ratios (Phase Two). This two-phase method allows the user to quickly identify buildings that have adequate seismic characteristics and structural capacity and screen them out from further evaluation.

The literature describes the use of predictiveness curves to evaluate the performances of biological markers to formulate diagnoses, prognoses and assess disease risks, assess the fit of risk models, and estimate the clinical utility of a model when applied to a population. Similarly, we use logis‑ tic regression models to calculate activity probabilities related to the scores that the compounds obtained in virtual screening experiments. The predictiveness curve can provide an intuitive and graphical tool to compare the predic‑ tive power of virtual <b>screening</b> <b>methods.</b> Results: Similarly to ROC curves, predictiveness curves are functions of the distribution of the scores and provide a common scale for the evaluation of virtual <b>screening</b> <b>methods.</b> Contrarily to ROC curves, the dispersion of the scores is well described by predictiveness curves.
