Another study showed that bismuth acted synergistically with various antibiotics to inhibit sulfate-reducing gut bacteria and sulfide production. Some authors proposed a theory that H2S was involved in the development of ulcerative colitis and that bismuth might be helpful in the management of this condition. However, bismuth administration in rats did not prevent them from developing ulcerative colitis despite reduced H2S production. Also, new evidence suggests that colonic H2S is largely present in bound forms, probably sulfides of iron and other metals. Rarely, serious bismuth toxicity may occur with higher doses.|$|E

In 40 Wistar rats, two standard wounds (3. 5 mm x 2 mm) were made using a biopsy punch on the back of each animal. Test wounds were filled with <b>bismuth</b> <b>subgallate</b> and control wounds with 0. 9 % saline. At 1, 4, 7, 11 and 18 days, the qualitative evolution of the granulation tissue morphology was observed and digitalized histologic images were evaluated.

Histometrically, there were statistically significant differences between test and control (ANOVA- days 1 and 4; Student t test, p< 0. 05 - days 7, 11 and 18) in terms of the following parameters: area of ulceration- day 1; distance between epithelial edges- day 4; area of granulation tissue- days 7, 11 and 18.

Foram utilizados 55 ratos Wistar no dorso dos quais realizou-se feridas padronizadas pelo uso de um bisturi {{circular}} (3, 5 mm X 2, 0 mm). No lado direito a ferida foi tratada com subgalato de bismuto e no esquerdo, com solução fisiológica 0, 9 %. Os períodos avaliados foram de 01, 04, 07, 11 e 18 dias. Utilizou-se microscopia ótica comum para avaliação histológica qualitativa (H. E.) e microscopia de polarização para avaliação da birrefringência de fibras colágenas; foi realizada ainda avaliação histométrica através das imagens histológicas digitalizadas e também avaliação macroscópica através de fotografias padronizadas. Os resultados mostraram que histologicamente não houve diferenças relevantes entre teste e controle, com síntese de colágeno discretamente maior para grupo controle; macroscopicamente não houve diferença significativa (ANOVA) no padrão de contração lateral das feridas e histometricamente, os parâmetros avaliados mostraram números significativemente maiores para as feridas tratadas com subgalato de bismuto. (ANOVA dias 01 e 04; teste t, p< 0, 05 nos dias 07, 11 e 18). Connclui-se que o subgalato de bismuto não interferiu na qualidade do processo de reparação, sendo biocompatível aos tecidos, apresentando uma área maior de tecido de granulação pela presença física do material, podendo ser indicado como hemostático. sem efeito inibor significado sobre o processo de reparaçãoAbstract: The aim of {{this study}} was to evaluate the effect of <b>Bismuth</b> <b>subgallate</b> on wound healing. In fifty five Wistar rats, two standardised wounds were made with a biopsy punch (3, 5 mm X 2, 0 mm) at the back of each rat. Test wound was filled with <b>bismuth</b> <b>subgallate</b> and the control with salina 0, 9 %. The periods of evaluation were 1, 4, 7, 11 and 18 days. The methods utilised were: qualitative evaluation of the granulation tissue morphology; evaluation of collagen synthesis (polarisation microscopy / birefringence); histometric evaluation of digitalized histology images and evaluation of a macroscopic (photograph) group. The results showed that: histologically there were no relevant differences between test and control, with collagen synthesis very similar to each other. At the photographic group, no statistically significant difference (ANOVA) was observed between test and control, related to the lateral closure of the wounds. Histometrically, the parameters analysed (area of ulceration - Day 1; distance between epithelial edges - Day 4 and area of granulation tissue - Days 7, 11 and 18) showed that there were statistically significant differences between test and control (ANOVA - Days 1 and 4; student t test, p< 0, 05 - Days 7, 11 and 18).

40|$|Calcium {{phosphate}} cements (CPCs) {{have several}} advantages {{for use as}} endodontic materials, and such advantages include ease of use, biocompatibility, potential hydroxyapatite-forming ability, and bond creation between the dentin and appropriate filling materials. However, unlike tricalcium silicate (CS) -based materials, CPCs do not have antibacterial properties. The present study doped a nonwashable CPC with 0. 25 – 1. 0 wt % hinokitiol and added 0, 5, and 10 wt % CS. The CPCs with 0. 25 – 0. 5 wt % hinokitiol showed appreciable antimicrobial properties without alterations in their working or setting times, mechanical properties, or cytocompatibility. Addition of CS slightly retarded the apatite formation of CPC and the working and setting time was obviously reduced. Moreover, addition of CS dramatically increased the compressive strength of CPC. Doping CS with 5 wt % ZnO provided additional antibacterial effects to the present CPC system. CS and hinokitiol exerted a synergic antibacterial effect, and the CPC with 0. 25 wt % hinokitiol and 10 wt % CS (doped with 5 wt % ZnO) had higher antibacterial properties than that of pure CS. The addition of 10 wt % <b>bismuth</b> <b>subgallate</b> doubled the CPC radiopacity. The results demonstrate that hinokitiol and CS can improve the antibacterial properties of CPCs, and they can thus be considered for endodontic applications...|$|E
40|$|Electron {{crystallography}} {{has been}} proven to be effective for structure determination of nano- and micron-sized crystals. In the past few years, 3 D electron diffraction (3 DED) techniques {{were used for the}} structure solution of various types of complex structures such as zeolites, metal-organic frameworks (MOF) and pharmaceutical compounds. However, unlike X-ray crystallography, electron diffraction has not yet become an independent technique for a complete structure determination due to relatively poorer diffraction intensities and often powder X-ray diffraction data are used for structure validation and refinement. Electron beam damage to the structures that are sensitive to high energy electrons and dynamical scattering are important factors to lead to the deviation of electron diffraction intensities from the squared amplitudes of the structure factors. In this thesis, we investigate various aspects around the 3 D electron diffraction data quality and strategies for obtaining better data and structure models. We combined 3 D electron diffraction methods and powder X-ray diffraction to determine the structure of an open-framework material and discussed the difficulties and limitations of electron diffraction for beam sensitive materials. Next, we illustrated the structure determination of a pharmaceutical compound, <b>bismuth</b> <b>subgallate,</b> using 3 D electron diffraction. While severe beam damage and diffuse scattering were observed in the dataset collected with the conventional rotation electron diffraction (RED) method, the continuous rotation electron diffraction (cRED) method coupled with sample cooling significantly improved the data quality and made the structure solution possible. In order to better understand the potentials and limitations of the continuous rotation method, we collected multiple datasets from different crystals of a known structure and studied the data quality by evaluating the accuracy of the refined structure models. To tackle dynamical scattering in electron diffraction data, we explored a routine for structure refinement with dynamical intensity calculation using RED data from a known structure and discussed its potentials and limitations.
