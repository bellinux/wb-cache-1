Analysis of maize and sunflower crops originating from seeds dressed with imidacloprid suggest large amounts of the insecticide will be carried back to honey bee colonies. Sublethal doses of imidacloprid in sucrose solution have also been documented to affect homing and foraging activity of honey bees. Imidacloprid in sucrose solution fed to bees in the laboratory impaired their communication for a few hours. Sublethal doses of imidacloprid in laboratory and field experiment decreased flight activity and olfactory discrimination, and olfactory learning performance was impaired.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} studies on climate change and bees examined the species, B. Disinguendus and B. sylvarum between 2000 and 2006 in the UK. The study showed that as the climate of western Europe warmed, these two bee species experienced range declines and narrower climatic niches pushing them to the fringes of their environments. Geographically and climatically we expect this, as climate change continues bees will move and abandon areas of drought and migrate towards the fringes, as this has already been seen within desert oases. Europe has done significant work in tracking <b>bee</b> <b>colony</b> changes within regions. Additional longitudinal surveillance must be conducted in other regions of the globe among a wider array bee species to build the body of research on the impact of climate change on bees.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{aim of this}} {{experiment}} was to investigate whether honeybees from colonies that {{are not familiar with}} their surrounding landscape, due to short-distance migration to a new location, are more at risk by guttation drops from seed-treated plants than <b>bee</b> <b>colonies</b> which are already familiar with alternative water sources in the surrounding of their apiary. Results: The mean mortality of bees, which occurred after moving beehives to a new location, increased only slightly from 6 bees/day (- 1 day before moving) up to a maximum of 21 bees/day (1 day after moving). No significant differences in the mean number of dead <b>bees</b> between <b>bee</b> <b>colonies</b> that were familiar with all sites of water sources in the surrounding area and <b>bee</b> <b>colonies</b> that were only recently moved to the field were observed.

40|$|The Northern Great Plains {{region of}} the US {{annually}} hosts {{a large portion of}} commercially managed U. S. honey <b>bee</b> <b>colonies</b> each summer. Changing land use patterns over the last several decades have contributed to declines in the availability of bee forage across the region, and the future sustainability of the region to support honey <b>bee</b> <b>colonies</b> is unclear. We examined the influence of varying land use on the survivorship and productivity of honey <b>bee</b> <b>colonies</b> located in six apiaries within the Northern Great Plains state of North Dakota, an area of intensive agriculture and high density of beekeeping operations. Land use surrounding the apiaries was quantified over three years, 2010 – 2012, and survival and productivity of honey <b>bee</b> <b>colonies</b> were determined in response to the amount of bee forage land within a 3. 2 -km radius of each apiary. The area of uncultivated forage land (including pasture, USDA conservation program fields, fallow land, flowering woody plants, grassland, hay land, and roadside ditches) exerted a positive impact on annual apiary survival and honey production. Taxonomic diversity of bee-collected pollen and pesticide residues contained therein varied seasonally among apiaries, but overall were not correlated to large-scale land use patterns or survival and honey production. The predominant flowering plants utilized by honey <b>bee</b> <b>colonies</b> for pollen were volunteer species present in unmanaged (for honey bees), and often ephemeral, lands; thus placing honey <b>bee</b> <b>colonies</b> in a precarious situation for acquiring forage and nutrients over the entire growing season.

40|$|This {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} focused on the causes of <b>bee</b> <b>colonies</b> losses. In the last years the number of dead <b>bee</b> <b>colonies</b> increased significantly. Especially in the years 2013 and 2014, which this paper deals with, losses were really alarming (on the nationwide average up to 30 %). The theoretical part of the paper firstly presents beekeeping in general. Then, the thesis deals mainly with diseases and parasites invading <b>bee</b> <b>colonies.</b> Lastly, the paper describes hygiene and good breeding practice, which helps to prevent diseases and which should be obvious to every beekeeper. The reason for this is the fact that by not following good breeding practice the beekeeper does not threaten not only his/her own breeding, but also the breeds of neighbouring beekeepers. The aim of the thesis is to compare beekeepers practice {{with the help of the}} data collected in questionnaires. The questions concern the varroasis disease, which afflicts the beekeepers in this country most often and which is (according to the latest researches) one of the main causes of <b>bee</b> <b>colonies</b> losses. Fifteen beekeepers filled in the questionnaire. None of them (with one exception) had great losses of <b>bee</b> <b>colonies.</b> Eleven respondents noted losses within 10 %. The greatest losses noted the beekeeper owning the highest number of <b>bee</b> <b>colonies.</b> The beekeepers admitted one serious mistake, not following the information leaflet of medical products, which may have decreased the effectiveness of treatment. None of the respondents had removed the sealed brood before fumigation and aerosol treatment was done. Therefore not all mites in the hive could have been exterminated...|$|R
25|$|Stonebrood (Aspergillosis larvae apium) is a {{fungal disease}} caused by Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus, and Aspergillus niger. It causes mummification of the brood of a honey <b>bee</b> <b>colony.</b> The fungi are common soil {{inhabitants}} {{and are also}} pathogenic to other insects, birds, and mammals. The disease is difficult to identify {{in the early stages}} of infection. The spores of the different species have different colours and can also cause respiratory damage to humans and other animals. When bee larvae take in spores, they may hatch in the gut, growing rapidly to form a collar-like ring near the larval heads. After death, the larvae turn black and become difficult to crush, hence the name stonebrood. Eventually, the fungus erupts from the integument of the larvae and forms a false skin. In this stage, the larvae are covered with powdery fungal spores. Worker bees clean out the infected brood and the hive may recover depending on factors such as the strength of the colony, the level of infection, and hygienic habits of the strain of bees (variation in the trait occurs among different subspecies/races).|$|E

A bee or <b>bee</b> <b>colony</b> that appears to have succumbed to a pathogen may not have died if it had not also been exposed to a sublethal dose of a pesticide and/or been subject to food stress (which might in turn be due to drought or heavy rain induced by climate change, or competition from a high density of honey bee hives placed nearby). Unfortunately, conducting well-replicated studies of the effects of multiple interacting stressors on bee colonies is exceedingly difficult. The number of stressor combinations rapidly becomes large, and exposure to stressors is hard or impossible to control with free-flying bees. Nonetheless, a strong argument can be made that it is the interaction among parasites, pesticides, and diet that {{lies at the heart of}} current bee health problems." ...|$|E
2500|$|Research {{that was}} {{published}} in November 2004, by scientists {{under the leadership of}} Zachary Huang, Michigan State University indicates that so called primer pheromones play an important part in how a honey <b>bee</b> <b>colony</b> adjusts its distribution of labor most beneficially. [...] In order to survive as a <b>bee</b> <b>colony</b> of sometimes 50,000–100,000 individual bees, the communal structure has to be adaptable to seasonal changes and the availability of food. [...] The division of labor has to adjust itself to the resources available from foraging. [...] While the division of labor in a <b>bee</b> <b>colony</b> is quite complex, the work can be roughly seen as work inside the hive and outside the hive. [...] Younger bees play a role inside the hive while older bees play a role outside the hive mostly as foragers. [...] Huang's team found that forager bees gather and carry a chemical called ethyl oleate in the stomach. [...] The forager bees feed this primer pheromone to the worker bees, and the chemical keeps them in a nurse bee state. [...] The pheromone prevents the nurse bees from maturing too early to become forager bees. [...] As forager bees die off, less of the ethyl oleate is available and nurse bees more quickly mature to become foragers.

40|$|Two {{behaviours}} {{of honey}} bees, hygienic and grooming, are mechanisms {{of defense against}} brood diseases and parasitic mites, including Varroa destructor. Apis mellifera colonies remove the worker brood infested with Varroa destructor mites from the nest (hygienic behaviour), and groom the mites off other adult bees (grooming behaviour). In this study hygienic and grooming behaviours of Sjeničko-Pešterski honey bee ecotype were analysed in 440 honey <b>bee</b> <b>colonies</b> from 11 localities {{in the region of}} Sjeničko-Pešterski plateau, Podpešterje, Golija Mt. and Rogozna ML At each locality 40 honey <b>bee</b> <b>colonies</b> were investigated: 10 potent colonies with one-year old queen, 10 potent colonies with two-year old queen, 10 medium potent and 10 weak honey <b>bee</b> <b>colonies.</b> Hygienic behaviour was expressed in a range from 95. 12 % to 99. 50 % in potent honey <b>bee</b> <b>colonies</b> with one-year old and two-year old queens. Statistically highly significant (p< 0. 01) differences were registered among the analysed honey <b>bee</b> <b>colonies</b> at the investigated region, in favour of the potent honey <b>bee</b> <b>colonies,</b> compared to the medium potent and weak colonies. Also, statistically highly significant (p< 0. 01) differences were recorded between potent colonies with one-year old queens and colonies with two-year old queens, in favour of the colonies with one-year old queens. In general, investigated colonies belong to a category of the so called "hygienic colonies", as the efficiency of elimination of damaged pupae amounted to 91. 50 %. Grooming behaviour of Sjeničko-Pešterski honey bee ecotype potentially exists, but its significance cannot be discussed as, on the whole, investigated colonies showed potential of 34, 04 %. Our results point to an indisputable relationship between analysed behaviours and the strength of honey bee colonies: hygienic behaviour is more expressed in potent colonies (from 95. 12 % to 99. 50 %) regardless of queen age; grooming behaviour was expressed only in potent honey <b>bee</b> <b>colonies</b> with one-year old queen at all 11 localities, where the number of damaged mites ranged from 36, 05 % to 39, 61 %. The damaged mites were separated into six categories. The most frequent category of damage was damaged legs (53. 38 % in potent colonies with one-year old queens and 52. 02 % in potent colonies with two-year old queens). The potent honey <b>bee</b> <b>colonies</b> from the investigated region especially with one-year old queen, could be used for highly selected breeds improving and queens rearing...|$|R

40|$|The {{honey bee}} {{is a major}} insect used for {{pollination}} of many commercial crops worldwide. Although the use of honey bees for pollination can disrupt the habitat, the effects on their physiology have never been determined. Recently, honey <b>bee</b> <b>colonies</b> have often collapsed when introduced in greenhouses for pollination in Japan. Thus, suppressing colony collapses and maintaining the number of worker <b>bees</b> in the <b>colonies</b> is essential for successful long-term pollination in greenhouses and recycling of honey <b>bee</b> <b>colonies.</b> To understand the physiological states of honey bees used for long-term pollination in greenhouses, we characterized their gene expression profiles by microarray.

Thus, honey <b>bee</b> <b>colonies</b> are likely to collapse during pollination in greenhouses when heavily infested with pathogens.

However, we found a strong seasonal variation in the amount and diversity of collected pollen in all sites independent of landscape diversity. The observed increase in foraging distances with decreasing landscape diversity suggests that honey bees compensated for lower landscape diversity by increasing their pollen foraging range in order to maintain pollen amount and diversity. Our results underscore the importance of a diverse pollen diet for honey <b>bee</b> <b>colonies.</b> Agri-environmental schemes aiming to support pollinators should focus on possible spatial and temporal gaps in pollen availability and diversity in agricultural landscapes...|$|R
