500|$|This hypothesis, {{although}} not perfect, perhaps best explains the evidence. Eighteen {{months prior to}} an October 1984 conference on lunar origins, Bill Hartmann, Roger Phillips, and Jeff Taylor challenged fellow lunar scientists: [...] "You have eighteen months. Go <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> Apollo data, go <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> computer, do whatever you have to, but make up your mind. Don't come to our conference unless {{you have something to}} say about the Moon's birth." [...] At the 1984 conference at Kona, Hawaii, the giant impact hypothesis emerged as the most popular. Before the conference, there were partisans of the three [...] "traditional" [...] theories, plus a few people who were starting to take the giant impact seriously, and there was a huge apathetic middle who didn’t think the debate would ever be resolved. Afterward there were essentially only two groups: the giant impact camp and the agnostics.|$|E

However, despite this misinformation, Lefty denies service {{to a number of}} white customers who partook in the riots. One dismissed customer even yells at him, [...] "hy don't you go <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> own country?", returning the spotlight of racial prejudice on him.|$|E

[...] He identified himself as a 36-year-old Catholic from Netherdale in Yorkshire, and gave his father's name as Thomas and his mother's as Edith Jackson. [...] Wounds on his body noted by his questioners he explained as the effects of pleurisy. [...] Fawkes admitted his intention to blow up the House of Lords, and expressed regret at his failure to do so. [...] His steadfast manner earned him the admiration of King James, who described Fawkes as possessing [...] "a Roman resolution".|$|E
500|$|Late on {{the night}} of August 15, Stark was awakened by the arrival of Parson Thomas Allen and a band of Massachusetts militiamen from nearby Berkshire County who insisted on joining his force. In {{response}} to the minister's fiery threat that his men would never come out again if they were not allowed to participate, Stark is reported to have said, [...] "Would you go now on this dark and rainy night? Go <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> people and tell them to get some rest if they can, and if the Lord gives us sunshine to-morrow and I do not give you fighting enough, I will never call on you to come again."

500|$|As the {{defending}} champion at the World Championship for the first time, O'Sullivan sought to turn his recent bad form around and break the Crucible curse. O'Sullivan defeated Drew Henry 10–5 in the first round, Robert Milkins 13–2 in the second round, and Stephen Lee 13–10 in the quarter-finals {{to advance to the}} semi-finals where he faced Stephen Hendry. In a pre-match interview, O'Sullivan revealed that he had [...] "no respect" [...] for Hendry, referring to an incident during O'Sullivan's 13–17 semi-final defeat to Hendry three years prior, when the referee had awarded a miss that O'Sullivan felt Hendry should not have accepted. He further added that he wanted [...] "to send [...] back home to Scotland" [...] to stop one of his former manager's players from winning the tournament, and that [...] "I know if I do get beat and [...] comes up and does a moonie {{in front of me and}} goes 'Ne ne ne', I'll just look at him and say 'well done' and say 'go <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> sad little life'.". In the match O'Sullivan took a 5–3 overnight lead after the first session, but Hendry fought back to level at 12–12 before the final session. Hendry subsequently outplayed O'Sullivan winning the semi-final 17 frames to 13. After the match, Hendry said it wasn't [...] "personal" [...] for him and he didn't remember the incident O'Sullivan described. O'Sullivan was unapologetic about the comments he made, saying it made a [...] "better atmosphere" [...] and [...] "what's better than a grudge match?".|$|E

500|$|Slant Magazine writer Sal Cinquemani {{compared}} the album unfavorably to In the Zone, saying that although Blackout [...] "scores well, and its hotness quotient is remarkably high, [...] isn't {{much of a}} step forward for Britney following 2003's surprisingly strong In the Zone, for which she received a writing credit on {{a majority of the}} songs (as opposed to a scant three here)." [...] Andy Battaglia of The A.V. Club said Blackout [...] "counts both as a significant event and as a disquieting aberration that couldn't be more mysteriously manufactured or bizarrely ill-timed" [...] in which [...] "every song counts as markedly progressive and strange." [...] Alexis Petridis from The Guardian called it [...] "a bold, exciting album: the question is whether anyone will be able to hear its contents over the deafening roar of tittle-tattle." [...] He elaborated that when faced with a public image in freefall, an artist has two options: making music [...] "that harks <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> golden, pre-tailspin days" [...] to [...] "underlin your complete normality" [...] or [...] "to throw caution to the wind: given your waning fortunes, what's the harm in taking a few musical risks?" [...] Petridis commented that Spears opted for the latter and the results were [...] "largely fantastic." [...] Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times said, [...] "The electronic beats and bass lines are as thick as Ms. Spears's voice is thin, and as the album title suggests, the general mood is bracingly unapologetic." [...] Sanneh added that said Spears became a spectral presence in her own album, explaining that when compared to her previous records, [...] " [...] cuts a startlingly low profile on Blackout [...] Even when she was being marketed as a clean-cut ex-Mouseketeer, and even when she was touring the country with a microphone that functioned largely as a prop, something about her was intense." [...] Peter Robinson of The Observer stated that Spears [...] "delivered the best album of her career, raising the bar for modern pop music with an incendiary mix of Timbaland's Shock Value and her own back catalogue." [...] The Phoenixs Ellee Dean said the album [...] "may be more a tribute to the skills of the A-list producers who guided her through the disc than to any of her own talents. But at least she was smart enough to accept that guidance." [...] In his consumer guide for MSN Music, critic Robert Christgau gave the album a B+ and said that [...] "From 'Gimme More's 'It's Britney bitch' hiya to 'Piece of Me's single-of-the-year sonics, from 'Ooh Ooh Baby's 'feel you deep inside' to 'Perfect Lover's 'touch me there', this album is pure, juicy, plastic get-naked." [...] Blackout was ranked by Rolling Stone at number fifty on their list of the 100 Best Albums of 2007. The album topped Billboards Reader's Choice poll as the best album of the year.|$|E
