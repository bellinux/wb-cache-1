5|$|On 25 March 2010, an A-10 {{conducted}} {{the first flight}} of an aircraft with all engines powered by a biofuel blend. The flight, performed at Eglin Air Force Base, used a 1:1 blend of JP-8 and Camelina-based fuel. On 28 June 2012, the A-10 became the first aircraft to fly using a new fuel blend derived from alcohol; known as ATJ (Alcohol-to-Jet), the fuel is cellulosic-based that can be derived using wood, paper, grass, or any cellulose <b>based</b> <b>material,</b> and are fermented into alcohols before being hydro-processed into aviation fuel. ATJ is the third alternative fuel to be evaluated by the Air Force {{as a replacement for}} petroleum-derived JP-8 fuel. Previous types were a synthetic paraffinic kerosene derived from coal and natural gas and a bio-mass fuel derived from plant-oils and animal fats known as Hydroprocessed Renewable Jet.|$|E

Perovskite solar cells are also forecast to be extremely cheap to scale up, making them a very attractive option for commercialisation.|$|E
2500|$|Biochar is a {{charcoal}} {{that is used}} for agricultural purposes which also aids in carbon sequestration, the capture or hold of carbon. [...] It is created using a process called pyrolysis, which is basically the act of high temperature heating biomass in an environment with low oxygen levels. [...] What remains is a material known as char, similar to charcoal but is made through a sustainable process, thus the use of biomass. [...] Biomass is organic matter produced by living organisms or recently living organisms, most commonly plants or plant <b>based</b> <b>material.</b> The offset of GHG emission, if biochar were to be implemented, would be a maximum of 12%. [...] This equates to about 106 metric tons of CO2 equivalents. [...] On a medium conservative level, it would be 23% less than that, at [...] 82 metric tons. A study done by the UK Biochar Research Center has stated that, on a conservative level, biochar can store 1 gigaton of carbon per year. [...] With greater effort in marketing and acceptance of biochar, the benefit could be the storage of 5–9 gigatons per year of carbon in biochar soils.|$|E

The material (10) is stamped by a rolling die {{to obtain a}} structured conductive <b>base</b> <b>material</b> having a conductor structure (30) and a remaining <b>base</b> <b>material.</b> The structured (30) and the remaining materials are completely separated by the stamping. The structure (30) is connected with the material (14), and the remaining material is removed. USE - Used for producing a conductor structure e. g. antenna structure, on a substrate for a radio frequency identification (RFID) label for a radio frequency identification (RFID) system. Can also be utilized for an identification system e. g. wireless identification system such as bar code system, optical character recognition (OCR) system, for person identification, animal identification, brand and/or product protection, logistic, immobilizer and locking system.

40|$|The {{curing process}} of {{prosthetic}} socket <b>base</b> <b>materials</b> requires attention owing {{to a series}} of associated problems that are yet to be addressed and solved. However, to date, few relevant studies have been reported. In this paper, nanodiamonds modified with a silane coupling agent were dispersed into a prosthetic socket <b>base</b> <b>material,</b> and the performance of the modified <b>base</b> <b>materials</b> was investigated. Adding a predetermined amount of nanodiamonds to the prosthetic socket <b>base</b> <b>material</b> increased the glass transition temperature, improved the mechanical properties of the cured <b>base</b> <b>material,</b> and reduced the influence of the volatile gas formed during the curing process on the environment. With increasing nanodiamond contents, the glass transition temperature increased and the mechanical properties improved slightly. Owing to the high thermal conductivity of the nanodiamonds, the localized heat, {{as a result of the}} curing process, could be dissipated and released. Thus, adding nanodiamonds led to a more uniform temperature field forming in the curing system. This improved the curing process and reduced the formation of volatile monomers, thereby decreasing the adverse impact of the generated volatile gases on the environment. All of these provide a potential strategy for modifying prosthetic socket <b>base</b> <b>materials...</b>|$|R
40|$|Si-SiC matrix C/C {{composites}} {{are known}} to be synthesized through the following process. With the C/C composite having a yarn-like structure of carbon fibers as a <b>base</b> <b>material,</b> the Si-SiC matrix C/C composite is obtained by synthesizing a trunk Si-SiC matrix after impregnating Si into the clearances between yarns and then synthesizing a branch Si-SiC matrix which stretches from the trunk Si-SiC {{to the inside of the}} C/C composite. Compressive strength of the Si-SiC matrix C/C composite is increased up to about twice as large as that of the <b>base</b> <b>material</b> C/C composite. However, the tensile strength of this composite is decreased to about one fourth of that of the <b>base</b> <b>material</b> C/C composite, and the bending strength is decreased to about a half of that of the <b>base</b> <b>material</b> C/C composite. This paper reports that 1) degradation of tensile/bending strength caused on the Si-SiC matrix C/C composite is an unavoidable phenomenon and 2) a technique for forming only a part of the <b>base</b> <b>material</b> C/C composite into the Si-SiC matrix structure is an effective means of structural component design by increasing compressive strength of the <b>base</b> <b>material</b> C/C composite and restraining degradation of tensile/bending strength. </p...|$|R

To illustrate this dependence, the deposition rate of nondoped silicon dioxide obtained ona thermal oxide surface is significantly lower than the deposition rate obtained on a bare silicon surface. A new method to eliminate this <b>base</b> <b>material</b> dependence involving plasma treatment has been investigated. The optimum treatment con-sists of exposing the <b>base</b> <b>materials</b> to a nitrogen plasma for 1 min while maintaining the <b>base</b> <b>materials</b> at 250 ~ Films deposited on thermal oxide <b>base</b> <b>materials</b> which have first been treated by this new method were found to have the same deposition rate, aqueous HF etch rate, and surface morphology as those films deposited on untreated bare silicon. In addi-tion to a nitrogen plasma, oxygen and argon plasmas were studied and found to produce similar esults when the base ma-terial temperature was raised to 350 ~ The elimination of <b>base</b> <b>material</b> dependence through the use of this new plasma treatment technique has resulted in higher integrity TEOS/O 3 oxides and has also expanded the range of applications for this unique planarizing technology for very large scale integrated evice fabrication.
