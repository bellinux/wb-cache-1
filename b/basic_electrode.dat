Design/methodology/approach: Welds were obtained with various oxygen content. There were investigated properties of WMD, especially metallographic structure, toughness and fatigue strength of welds with various oxygen amount. The connection between the properties of welds with the content of oxygen in WMD were carried out. Findings: Demonstrated that oxygen content in WMD has an important influence on metallographic structure, especially on the percentage of acicular ferrite in weld. The preferred structure improves the mechanical properties of welded joints. Research limitations: The research results indicate that oxygen content in steel welds should be limited. Subsequent researchers could find more precisely the most beneficial oxygen amount in the welds in terms of the amount of acicular ferrite in welds. Practical limitations: To obtain welds with the best properties should be chosen suggested low-oxygen process. It is therefore suggestion to use much more <b>basic</b> <b>electrodes</b> than rutile for steel welding.

CFD simulations of electrolyte flow and metal dissolving together with experimentally determined dissolving characteristics are used to examine the ECM process in detail. The optimized cathode shape is exported as STL data file and generated in short time via rapid prototyping. With a metal coating, it can be directly used to validate the simulation results and also for production purposes. This presentation shows results of the 3 D simulation of the ECM process for <b>basic</b> <b>electrode</b> shapes, e. g. half sphere, cone, pyramid, and cube. The simulations include the calculation of electric potential distribution and mesh deformation due to metal dissolving. The dissolving speed is calculated from experimentally determined characteristic curves as a function of current density and power supply properties [2]. During the surface deformation, mesh quality decreases locally so that remeshing is occasionally necessary. This is done automatically by extracting the deformed surfaces as STL files, remeshing the deformed geometry with tetrahedrons and prisms and restarting the simulation from the latest result. The simulation uses a commercial finite-volume computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solver so that electrolyte flow, turbulence effects, gas and heat generation can be included in the simulation to extend the model towards ab-initio modelling. The simulation results are compared to experimental results that were produced at Fraunhofer IWU. For this purpose a half sphere cathode was used for the removal experiments. The process parameters like feed rate and voltage were calculated also from experimentally determined characteristic curves of the stainless steel 1. 4301 [2].

In {{apparent}} resistivity contours and sections we can distinguish two zones, which have noticeably different resistivity values. The low resistivity zone dominates in the deeper part of the section on all survey lines, especially on the profiles located in the close neighbourhood of the Vistula River. The relative high resistivity zone is probably the effect of complex local geology, {{as well as the}} influence of the limestone of the Wawel Hill. Based on ERT inversion results, three resistivity zones were distinguished. Then the probable lithological or/and anthropogenic character was assigned to them. The shallowest zone has the thickness of about 0. 5 m and results probably from accumulation of weathered limestone fragments derived from the Wawel Hill. It may be that high resistivity zones have anthropogenic character. Below, a zone of water-bearing sands was recorded, which may result from redevelopment and reclamation of this area. Thickness of this zone increases towards the Vistula River. Another zone, which can be identified with limestone, was identified on survey lines P 4 and P 5. This could also be result of accumulation of the calcareous debris for the purpose of planation of the area. In order to generalize and simplify the characterization of the quaternary sediments, ID interpretation was made.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to dielectrophoretically characterise {{sub-micron}} particles {{on the basis of}} their surface properties and to devise a DEP technique suitable for the fractionation and manipulation of particles on this scale. Polystyrene particles are modified by the attachment of biological ligands using various established localisation techniques and their DEP response observed using micro-electrodes with well defined high and low field regions, corresponding to a previously utilised design and modified in the course of this project for multiple sample handling. The results of these observations are modelled for the first time using a charge relaxation mechanism pertaining to a structured interfacial charge distribution and, through fitting the data to this model, fundamental parameters of the system - the surface conductance and electrokinetic charge - are predicted. The model viability is assessed with reference to both comparisons with alternative measurements and the technical limitations of the data fitting procedure, and corresponding surface charge transport mechanisms are discussed in the light of the DEP response following surface modification. Investigations are made into the possibility of a DEP based device suitable for the transport/fractionation of sub-micron particles. Given the essentially dissipative nature of sub-micro particle ensembles, a Brownian ratchet principle is chosen. A Brownian ratchet is a generic system wherein a net directional drive is effected by biasing Brownian diffusion on a periodically activated anisotropic structure. Without need of thermal gradients or net macroscopic forces Brownian ratchet pumps could be an interesting alternative in many microfluidic applications. Simulated fields and corresponding particle transport rates are compared for two <b>basic</b> <b>electrode</b> structures in order to assess their viability for use as DEP Brownian ratchets and a new design proposed, based on the simultaneous juxtaposition of positive and negative DEP forces.

40|$|An ambient {{temperature}} oxygen microsensor, {{based on a}} Nafion polymer electrolyte, has been developed and was microfabricated using thin-film technologies. A challenge {{in the operation of}} Nafion-based sensor systems is that the conductivity of Nafion film depends on the humidity in the film. Nafion film loses conductivity when the moisture content in the film is too low, which can affect sensor operation. The advancement here is the identification of a method to retain the operation of the Nafion films in lower humidity environments. Certain salts can hold water molecules in the Nafion film structure at room temperature. By mixing salts with the Nafion solution, water molecules can be homogeneously distributed in the Nafion film increasing the film s hydration to prevent Nafion film from being dried out in low-humidity environment. The presence of organics provides extra sites in the Nafion film to promote proton (H+) mobility and thus improving Nafion film conductivity and sensor performance. The fabrication of {{ambient temperature}} oxygen microsensors includes depositing <b>basic</b> <b>electrodes</b> using noble metals, and metal oxides layer on one of the electrode as a reference electrode. The use of noble metals for electrodes is due to their strong catalytic properties for oxygen reduction. A conducting polymer Nafion, doped with water-retaining components and extra sites facilitating proton movement, was used as the electrolyte material, making the design adequate for low humidity environment applications. The Nafion solution was coated on the electrodes and air-dried. The sensor operates at room temperature in potentiometric mode, which measures voltage differences between working and reference electrodes in different gases. Repeat able responses to 21 -percent oxygen in nitrogen were achieved using nitrogen as a baseline gas. Detection of oxygen from 7 to 21 percent has also been demonstrated.

The greatest reduc-tions were achieved with galvanized steel <b>electrodes,</b> <b>basic</b> pH, 20 mA/cm 2 and 60, 000 ppm H 2 O 2...|$|R
40|$|This feature article {{summarizes}} recent {{applications of}} ultrathin films of enzymes and DNA assembled layer-by-layer (LbL). Using examples mainly {{from our own}} research, we focus on systems developed for biocatalysis and biosensors for toxicity screening. Enzyme–poly(L-lysine) (PLL) films, especially when stabilized by crosslinking, {{can be used for}} biocatalysis at unprecedented high temperatures or in acidic or <b>basic</b> solutions on <b>electrodes</b> or sub-micron sized beads. Such films have bright prospects for chiral synthesis and biofuel cells. Excellent bioactivity and retention of enzyme structure in these films facilitates their use in detailed kinetic studies. Biosensors and arrays employing DNA–enzyme films show great promise in predicting genotoxicity of new drug and chemical product candidates. These devices combine metabolic biocatalysis, reactive metabolite–DNA reactions, and DNA damage detection. Catalyti...|$|R
40|$|Different {{working groups}} have already shown the {{possibilities}} of organic electronics for realization of low cost electronic circuits. In the mean time different technology demonstrators have been presented by different groups ranging from transistor level to ring oscillators or even digital circuits. However a crucial issue for polymer electronic applications is their reliability. Most prominent reliability limitation is the sensitivity on humidity as the most prominent reason for degradation. But also mechanical stresses, which are only minor relevant to silicon electronics due to the rigidity of the silicon wafers, they {{play a major role}} for polymer electronics on flexible substrates. At IZM we investigated the behaviour of polymer electronic circuits under different stress conditions. The devices have been fabricated on metallised PET film, where the <b>basic</b> source-drain <b>electrodes</b> are fabricated by a reel-to-reel photolithography process. Two coating steps are performed to process the active layer with polymer semiconductor of the PTAA type and a gate dielectric. Finally three screen printing steps are used to finish the polymer electronic process. A more detailed description of the fabrication process is given in ref. 1 and 2. Stable transistor function has been reached under normal ambient conditions with on-currents in the µA- and off-currents in the nA-range...|$|R
