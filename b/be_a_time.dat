5|$|Prior to broadcast, series creator Shonda Rhimes did {{not release}} much {{information}} about the season premiere. However, it was revealed prior to broadcast that there would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> jump in the episode. After {{it was announced that}} Dane would be departing shortly after the commencement of the ninth season, Dempsey uploaded a set picture on Twitter of Sloan in bad condition. Due to the unwanted release of spoilers, the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) requested that he delete the photo, and it was subsequently removed. The cast and crew of Grey's Anatomy were being particularly quiet about the fate of Capshaw's character. This secrecy was compromised when McKidd posted a picture on his Twitter account of the editing room, in which there was a picture of Robbins alive on the screen. The picture has since been taken down.|$|E
5|$|The game {{opens in}} 3 AF, as the Pulse town Serah lives in is {{attacked}} by monsters. A stranger named Noel appears {{to help fight}} the monsters and claims to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> traveler from 700 AF. He arrived in her time via Valhalla, where {{he claims to have}} met Lightning as she guarded the throne of the weakened Etro. As part of Lightning's transfer to Valhalla, she was erased from the fall of Cocoon onwards (making everyone except Serah forget her being with them on Gran Pulse), and paradoxes have erupted throughout time, warping the timeline. Serah joins Noel in a journey to resolve these paradoxes by removing items and monsters, which are out of their original time and correct the timeline; she in hopes of finding her sister and he in hopes of changing the bleak future he comes from. While journeying to 5 AF to resolve a paradox on Cocoon, they meet and help Alyssa, an Academy member and survivor of the Purge, a massacre by the Sanctum at the beginning of Final Fantasy XIII.|$|E

25|$|Based on Jesus' {{doctrine}} of the sheep and the goats, the corporal and spiritual works of mercy are a means of grace as good deeds and their omission is a reason for damnation.

25|$|In Denmark and Norway, the day {{is known}} as Fastelavn and is marked by eating fastelavnsboller. Fastelavn is the name for Carnival in Denmark which is either the Sunday or Monday before Ash Wednesday. Fastelavn {{developed}} from the Roman Catholic tradition of celebrating {{in the days before}} Lent, but after Denmark became a Protestant nation, the holiday became less specifically religious. This holiday occurs seven weeks before Easter Sunday, with children dressing up in costumes and gathering treats for the Fastelavn feast. The holiday is generally considered to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> for children's fun and family games.|$|E

If a bank holiday falls on a day when the controls are in operation, the controls apply in the normal way unless the plate states that they do not. Special controls may apply on days when a large event is being held.|$|E
25|$|After {{succeeding}} his father, Osorkon II {{was faced}} with the competing rule of his cousin, king Harsiese A, who controlled both Thebes and the Western Oasis of Egypt. Osorkon feared the serious challenge posed by Harsiese's kingship to his authority but, when Harsiese conveniently died in 860 BC, Osorkon II ensured that this problem would not recur by appointing his own son Nimlot C as the next High Priest of Amun at Thebes. This consolidated the pharaoh's authority over Upper Egypt and meant that Osorkon II ruled over a united Egypt. Osorkon II's reign would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> of large-scale monumental building and prosperity for Egypt.|$|E

25|$|A {{variety of}} body postures may be assumed, often with {{specific}} meaning (mainly respect or adoration) associated with them: standing; sitting; kneeling; prostrate on the floor; eyes opened; eyes closed; hands folded or clasped; hands upraised; holding hands with others; a laying on of hands and others. Prayers may be recited from memory, read {{from a book}} of prayers, or composed spontaneously as they are prayed. They may be said, chanted, or sung. They may be with musical accompaniment or not. There may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> of outward silence while prayers are offered mentally. Often, there are prayers to fit specific occasions, such as the blessing of a meal, the birth or death of a loved one, other significant events {{in the life of}} a believer, or days of the year that have special religious significance. Details corresponding to specific traditions are outlined below.|$|E
25|$|The Doctor {{initially}} dismisses Jenny as {{an echo of}} what {{it means}} to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>Time</b> Lord, but as they spend more time together he begins to accept her. The Doctor confides privately to Donna that he is resistant to Jenny coming with them in the TARDIS because she reminds him too much of Gallifrey and everything he lost in the Time War. Donna also becomes intrigued by a series of numbered plaques that she notices in each room. When they reach the location of the Source, it turns out to be a terraforming device within a colonising spaceship. Donna realises that the plaques represent the dates each part of the building was completed, which was a mere seven days previous. The humans and Hath have bred so many generations through the progenation machines that their own history has degraded into myth. The original cause of the conflict is determined by the Doctor to have been the death of the mission commander.|$|E
25|$|Filming of {{an episode}} can usually take a {{considerable}} amount of time to be done and as such, each task is usually filmed back-to-back, rather than weekly as it appears in the broadcast schedule for a series. For each episode, four television crews are used to follow the candidates during a task, and often are focused on picking up on mistakes and issues between candidates, than on their overall performance. The final edit of an episode often trims down a task that took 2–3 days to be done, to fit it within approximately about half of what will be televised for that episode, meaning candidates may appear to make minimal contributions when in reality they made more, while others may not feature as much if Lord Sugar or his advisers feel they did well and completed their duties, as emphasis is often put on moments that can be entertaining for audiences. Often the filming of an episode can hamper the efforts of candidates in a task, due to film crews usually having to get filming permission first from the respective owner of a store or establishment, which can often <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> consuming and cumbersome process as a result, whilst the strict rules of the BBC on product placement and advertising mean candidates have to approach businesses with care when asking them for help.|$|E

In 1984, the Immaculate Conception Seminary returned to Seton Hall, its original home until 1926, when it moved to Darlington (a section of Mahwah centered on a grand mansion and estate). The Recreation Center was dedicated in 1987. With the construction of four new residence halls between 1986 and 1988, and the purchase of an off-campus apartment building in 1990, the University made significant changes to account for {{a larger number of}} student residents. Seton Hall is recognized as a residential campus, providing living space for about 2100 students.|$|E

Realizing that Mort does not have a return pad that would be able to bring him back to the present, Stewie and Brian take one of the return pads and go back in time to save Mort. They end up in Warsaw, Poland and find Mort in a synagogue. He believes he is in Heaven as he sees dead family members there. It does not take long for them to realize that the date is September 1, 1939, the day of the Nazi invasion of Poland and when World War II started.|$|E
500|$|Writers on Deep Space Nine had {{previously}} hinted at a potential same-sex {{relationship in the}} [...] episode [...] "", when Jadzia Dax says goodbye to Enina Tandro, a former lover of Dax's previous male host, Curzon. The first take of the scene resulted in {{a situation in which}} it was unclear whether Dax and Enina were about to kiss. It was decided at the time that it was not appropriate, although the writers had hoped that there would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> when the viewers would accept such a relationship. This theme was eventually realised in [...] "Rejoined". Allen Kwan has argued that Deep Space Nine is the only series of Star Trek that resists the heteronormativity typical of the franchise, citing both [...] "Rejoined" [...] and the Mirror Universe episodes as examples, even if the presented bisexuality is problematized.|$|E

[...] Writing that society has become so automated that going through a check-out line at a grocery store without having made eye contact or spoken with the checker is possible, Swiderski favored [...] "insincerely meant human kindness to a robot".

500|$|Most of {{the vocal}} {{sessions}} {{took place in}} Paris, whereas the rhythm sections were recorded in the United States. The album incorporates a variety of accompanying performances including a horn section, woodwind instruments, a string orchestra and choir. Orchestral parts in particular were recorded for almost every track, but were only included on a few songs in the final product. The use of such performers and places came at great monetary expense, as noted by Bangalter: [...] "There used to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> where people that had means to experiment would do it, you know? That's what this record is about." [...] He estimated a cost of over one million dollars, but felt that the number was not important. Bangalter stated that the sessions were financed by Daft Punk themselves, which allowed them the luxury of abandoning the project if they had so wished. He also specified that [...] "there are songs on the album that traveled into five studios over {{two and a half}} years." ...|$|E
