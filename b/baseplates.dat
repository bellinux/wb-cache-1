40|$|A ball swaging {{process is}} {{commonly}} used in the hard disk drive manufacturing process to attach a suspension arm to an actuator arm via a part known as the <b>baseplate.</b> The geometry of the <b>baseplate</b> affects the contact pressure profile between the <b>baseplate</b> and the arm, torque retention of the swaged connection, and deformation of the assembly parts. In the current study, the effects of altering the <b>baseplate</b> geometric parameters on its characteristics are studied. A large-deformation dynamic finite element analysis of a ball swaging process is performed by using a commercial program ABAQUS. Theproducts of combining several geometric parameters are also investigated so as to obtain the <b>baseplate</b> geometry with improved torque retention and reduced tilt angle. It is concluded that a proper design of the <b>baseplate</b> is in such way that the <b>baseplate</b> boss and the arm possess the largest contact area and that the stress concentration at the <b>baseplate</b> neck is minimal...|$|R
30|$|Improvements in glenoid <b>baseplate</b> {{fixation}} {{have been}} {{critical to the success}} of the modern reverse shoulder replacement. Recognition of the importance of <b>baseplate</b> tilt [1 – 3], optimal screw placement [4 – 9], glenoid reaming techniques [10], peripheral screw fixation [11], <b>baseplate</b> shape and position [9, 12, 13], and introduction of bone ingrowth technologies [13] have contributed to avoiding the catastrophic <b>baseplate</b> failures described using first-generation reverse shoulder replacements [14 – 21]. In combination with improved surgical technique and implant enhancements, <b>baseplate</b> failures are less common [6].|$|R
40|$|The {{vibroseis}} method must {{be extended}} to its limits as the search {{for oil and gas}} continues on land. To successfully improve vibroseis data quality, it is crucial to evaluate each element in the vibroseis data acquisition system and ensure that the contribution from each element is successful. Vibroseis systems depend greatly upon the ability of vibrators to generate synchronous, repeatable ground-force sweeps over a broad frequency range. This requires that the reaction mass and the <b>baseplate</b> of the vibrator move as rigid bodies. However, rigid-body motion is not completely true for high- frequency vibrations, especially for the vibrator <b>baseplate.</b> In order to accurately understand the motion of the vibrator <b>baseplate,</b> a finite element analysis model of the vibrator <b>baseplate</b> and the coupled ground has been developed. This model is useful for simulating the vibrator <b>baseplate</b> dynamics, evaluating the impact of the <b>baseplate</b> on the coupled ground and vibrator <b>baseplate</b> design. Model data demonstrate that the vibrator <b>baseplate</b> and its stilt structure are subject to six significant resonant frequencies in the range of 10 – 80 Hz. Due to the low rigidity of the <b>baseplate,</b> the <b>baseplate</b> stilt structure experiences severe rocking motions at lower frequencies and the <b>baseplate</b> pad experiences severe flexing motions at higher frequencies. Flexing motions cause partial decoupling, which gives rise to increased levels of harmonic distortion and less useable signal energy. In general, the <b>baseplate</b> pad suffers more bending and flexing motions at high frequencies than low frequencies, leading less efficiency in transmitting the useable energy into the ground...|$|R
25|$|To prevent {{information}} {{identifying the}} Oscar winners from leaking {{ahead of the}} ceremony, Oscar statuettes presented at the ceremony have blank <b>baseplates.</b> Until 2010, winners were expected to return the statuettes to the Academy after the ceremony and wait several weeks to have inscriptions applied. Since 2010, winners have {{had the option of}} having engraved nameplates applied to their statuettes at an inscription-processing station at the Governor's Ball, a party held immediately after the Oscar ceremony. In 2010, the R.S. Owens company made 197 engraved nameplates ahead of the ceremony, bearing the names of every potential winner. The 175 or so nameplates for non-winning nominees were recycled afterwards.|$|E
25|$|In 1974 labour {{was getting}} too {{expensive}} in France, and Meccano subcontracted the manufacture of some models to Auto Pilen s.a. in Spain.

These models were sold in France under the marque Dinky, they were clearly identified as Dinky and as MADE IN SPAIN on the base plate. In Spain they were sold as Pilen and marked as such. Pilen models, most of which were Dinky dies, were very popular and numerous in Spain and commonly sold in El Corte Engles and Galerias Preciados department stores.|$|E

30|$|One key {{modification}} {{which helped}} improve <b>baseplate</b> fixation was {{the introduction of}} peripheral locked screws. First tested by Harman et al. [11], locked screw use significantly enhanced <b>baseplate</b> fixation and minimized micromotion at the baseplate−glenoid bone interface. This was also observed in clinical practice. Frankle et al. initially reported an 11 % <b>baseplate</b> failure rate using peripheral non-locked 3.5 -mm screws [22]. However, in a 5 -year follow-up series using the same implant with 5.0 -mm peripheral locked screws, the <b>baseplate</b> failure rate was reduced to 0 % [23]. This has led most surgeons to utilize locked screws for nearly all peripheral screw fixation opportunities when using a central screw-based <b>baseplate.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Binding {{angle is}} defined by the degrees off of {{perpendicular}} from the length of the snowboard. A binding angle of 0° is when the foot is perpendicular to the length of the snowboard. Positive angles are pointed towards the front of the board, whereas negative angles are pointed towards the back of the board. The question of how much the bindings are angled depends on the rider's purpose and preference. Different binding angles can be used for different types of snowboarding. Someone who participates in freestyle competition would have a much different [...] "stance" [...] than someone who explores backcountry and powder. The recent advancement and boom of snowboard culture and technology has made binding angle adjustments relatively easy. Binding companies design their bindings with similar <b>baseplates</b> that can easily mount onto any type of snowboard regardless of the brand. With the exception of Burton, and their newly released [...] "channel system", adjusting bindings is something that remains constant among all snowboarders. Done with a small screw-driver or a snowboard tool, the base plates on bindings can be easily rotated to whatever preferred stance. One must un-screw the baseplate, pick their degree angles, and then re-screw the <b>baseplates.</b> Bindings should also regularly be checked to ensure that the screws don't come undone from the movements of snowboarding.|$|E
40|$|My Ph. D. {{research}} involved {{studying the}} process of infection of Escherichia coli bacteria by bacteriophage T 4. Bacteriophage T 4 is a large, double-stranded DNA, tailed virus belonging to the Myoviridae subfamily. The bacteriophage T 4 tail is composed of two concentric cylinders: the inner rigid tail tube and the outer contractile tail sheath. One end of the tail {{is associated with the}} unique portal vertex of the head capsid, whereas the other end is terminated with a <b>baseplate</b> to which the fibers are attached. The <b>baseplate</b> and fibers are responsible for host cell recognition and attachment of the phage to the cell surface. Upon interaction of the fibers with the lipopolysaccharides on the cell surface, the <b>baseplate</b> changes its conformation from hexagonal to star-shaped triggering tail sheath contraction. The contracting tail sheath drives the tail tube through the cell envelope bringing the tube into contact with the inner cell membrane, which initiates release of the phage DNA into the host. ^ Structure of the bacteriophage T 4 <b>baseplate</b> has been investigated using electron cryo-microscopy and X-ray crystallography of the component proteins. The crystal structures of six <b>baseplate</b> proteins, four of which are reported in this work, were fitted into a 12 Å resolution three-dimensional reconstruction of the <b>baseplate</b> in the hexagonal conformation. A 17 Å resolution reconstruction of the star-shaped <b>baseplate</b> was also obtained and interpreted in terms of the component proteins. ^ The <b>baseplate</b> appeared to be stabilized in the hexagonal conformation by the six short tail fibers, which are folded under the <b>baseplate</b> in a garland-like arrangement {{with the help of the}} short tail fiber-attachment protein, gene product (gp) 11. In the star conformation, gp 11 was found to dissociate from the short tail fibers and bind to the long tail fibers. Upon binding to the cell surface receptors, the carboxy terminal, receptor-binding domains of the short tail fibers become free and disengage from the garland, thus unlocking the <b>baseplate</b> structure. The long tail fibers associate with gp 11 and switch the <b>baseplate</b> to the star conformation, which initiates tail sheath contraction. ...|$|R

2500|$|By 14 August the {{division}} had {{pushed to the}} north bank of the River Noireau, where the crossings had been measured by the RE Reconnaissance Party. During the night of 15/16 August the infantry waded across and established a bridgehead, while 204 Fd Co advanced with a waterproofed bulldozer, three tipper lorries of flexboards, four landing stage units and two boat units, and No 1 Platoon got to work on clearing mines, building a tank ford and a trestle bridge. Downstream the river split into two streams, but No 2 Platoon erected two Class 9 trestle bridges. Meanwhile, 553 Fd Co began work on {{the division}}'s first Bailey bridge across the demolished road bridge.

30|$|Limitations of {{this study}} relate {{to the use of}} {{polyurethane}} foam. While efforts were made to simulate the clinical environment, including placement of screws within torque limits, variations in patient bone quality may have different effects on hybrid peripheral screw <b>baseplate</b> fixation strength.
