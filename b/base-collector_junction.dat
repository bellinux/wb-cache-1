25|$|A {{phototransistor}} is a light-sensitive transistor. A {{common type}} of phototransistor, called a photobipolar transistor, is in essence a bipolar transistor encased in a transparent case so that light can reach the <b>base–collector</b> <b>junction.</b> It was invented by Dr. John N. Shive (more famous for his wave machine) at Bell Labs in 1948, {{but it was not}} announced until 1950. The electrons that are generated by photons in the <b>base–collector</b> <b>junction</b> are injected into the base, and this photodiode current is amplified by the transistor's current gain β (or hfe). If the base and collector leads are used and the emitter is left unconnected, the phototransistor becomes a photodiode. While phototransistors have a higher responsivity for light they are not able to detect low levels of light any better than photodiodes. Phototransistors also have significantly longer response times. Field-effect phototransistors, also known as photoFETs, are light-sensitive field-effect transistors. Unlike photobipolar transistors, photoFETs control drain-source current by creating a gate voltage.|$|E
5000|$|On November 29, 1963 Dr. Biard, Gary Pittman, Edward L. Bonin, and Jack Kilby filed {{a patent}} titled [...] "Photosensitive Transistor Chopper Using Light Emissive Diode" [...] (U.S. Patent US3304431); the first optical isolator. Within the patent they {{described}} a phototransistor chopper consisting of an LED optically {{coupled with a}} dual emitter, photosensitive, silicon transistor. The arrangement provided a switching function in which the switch was completely electrically isolated from the LED that drove it. The transistor operated in response to light emitted from the LED when forward current bias was generated across the junction of the diode. When emitted light struck {{the surface of the}} transistor, it was absorbed in the regions of both the emitter-base and <b>base-collector</b> <b>junctions</b> causing the transistor to conduct. This photoconductive transistor could be rapidly turned on and off by intensity modulating the LED at a very high frequency using high frequency alternating voltage. Prior to their invention, complete electrical isolation of the switch element in a chopper from the driving source for opening and closing the switch element was not possible, even through use of isolation transformers. Using isolation transformers, which were bulky and expensive, in miniaturized circuits to separate the driving source and the switch element resulted in magnetic pick-up and spike feed-through due to the transformer winding capacitance. Optical isolators were ideal because they're very small and can be mounted to a circuit board. In addition, they offer protection against excessively high voltages, reduce noise levels, and make measurements more accurate. In March 1965, Texas Instruments announced the SNX1304 Optoelectronic Pulse Amplifier, which was conceived and developed by Dr. Biard and Jerry Merryman, the inventor of the first handheld digital calculator. The SNX1304 consisted of a GaAs p-n junction light emitter optically coupled to an integrated silicon photodetector feedback-amplifier circuit. The device is thought to be the first commercial optically coupled integrated circuit.|$|R

40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. GaN-based bipolar {{transistors}} are good candidates for applications in RF power amplifiers. In contrast to more common AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs), GaN based bipolar transistors have not drawn much attention {{because of the}} difficulties in good p-type material and ohmic contact. Most of {{the problems associated with}} p-type quality and contact come from growth and etch damage during fabrication. In this work, a low damage etching technique with an undercut profile was developed to solve the problems associated with p-type ohmic contact quality and to realize the self-aligned GaN bipolar transistor fabrication. The etching process consists of bias-assisted photoenhanced electrochemical oxidation of GaN in deionized water (BPECO/DI) and its subsequent etching in diluted acid solution. By this technique, we demonstrated good Schottky contacts on samples etched more than 100 nm and p/n doping selective etching was shown. Furthermore the most critical point for self-aligned fabrication is undercut profile and it was also obtained by BPECO/DI etching. Hence this technique is ideal for fabrication of self-aligned bipolar transistors. There are some problems during fabrication of self-aligned bipolar transistor. First, due to the impossibility of activation annealing after emitter etch, activation annealing had to be done at the beginning where emitter layer is on the base and this was a problem for Mg activation. More importantly, there were still uncertainties with BPECO/DI etching like roughening up the etched surface, low etch rate for npn structures and disturbing the material uniformity near the surface. In this work, it was shown that BPECO/DI etching is a very efficient tool that provided low damage etching of GaN and enabled the self aligned RF bipolar transistor structures. It was found that self aligned base-emitter junctions were successfully formed and the BPECO/DI etching was almost stopped at top of the base layer. Self-aligned bipolar transistors were fabricated and their base-emitter and <b>base-collector</b> <b>junctions</b> were measured. The results obtained in this work demonstrated that BPECO/DI etching can bring solutions to the lack of low damage etching and the impossibility of self-aligned base contact in fabrication of today’s GaN based bipolar transistors.

High responsivity and high electrical bandwidth at the 850 nm wavelength have been achieved. The good performances of HPTs imply their applications in short-reach optical fiber communication. Summary: High-speed Si-based photodetectors (PDs), which are operated at 850 nm wavelength for the applications of short-reach data communication, merit a lot of attentions [1] due to their low cost and good ability to integrate with the matured Si-based electronic industry. In order to overcome the intrinsic material drawbacks of Si, several approaches have been reported, such as, deep trench structure [2], silicon on insulator (SOI) substrate [1], and wafer-bonding mirrors [3]. These techniques will increase the cost and difficulty in system integration. In this paper, we review our recent progress on the development of integrable SiGe based heterojunction bipolar phototransistors (HPTs) which can achieve high bandwidth and responsivity performances by an additional terminal and multiple-quantum wells (MQWs) at <b>base-collector</b> (B-C) <b>junction.</b> Two types of HPT were fabricated by a baseline process of SiGe/Si based heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBTs). One HPT has the typical epi- layer structure of standard HBT. The other one has similar structure with previous HPT, except that an additional Si 0. 5 Ge 0. 5 /Si MQWs are incorporated in the B-C junction as shown in Figure 1 [4].

40|$|Graduation date: 2001 The electron, gamma and neutron {{radiation}} degradation of III-V semiconductors and heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBTs) is investigated in this thesis. Particular {{attention is paid}} to InP and InGaAs materials and InP/InGaAs abrupt single HBTs (SHBTs). Complete process sequences for fabrication of InP/InGaAs HBTs are developed and subsequently employed to produce the devices, which are then electrically characterized and irradiated with the different types of radiation. A comprehensive analytical HBT model is developed and radiation damage calculations are performed to model the observed radiation-induced degradation of SHBTs. The most pronounced radiation effects found in SHBTs include reduction of the common-emitter DC current gain, shift of the collector-emitter (CE) offset voltage and increase of the emitter, base and collector parasitic resistances. Quantitative analysis performed using the developed model demonstrates that increase of the neutral bulk and base-emitter (BE) space charge region (SCR) components of the base current are responsible for the observed current gain degradation. The rise of the neutral bulk recombination is attributed to decrease in a Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) carrier lifetime, while the SCR current increase is caused by rising SCR SRH recombination and activation of a tunneling-recombination mechanism. On the material level these effects are explained by displacement defects produced in a semiconductor by the incident radiation. The second primary change of the SHBT characteristics, CE offset voltage shift, is induced by degradation of the <b>base-collector</b> (BC) <b>junction.</b> The observed rise of the BC current is brought on by diffusion and recombination currents which increase as more defects are introduced in a semiconductor.

40|$|In recent years, GaAsSb/InP double {{heterojunction}} {{bipolar transistors}} (DHBTs) {{have been demonstrated}} to be promising alternatives to InP/InGaAs HBTs, for next generation microwave/millimeter wave applications and optoelectronic integrated circuits (OEICs). However, GaAsSb-based DHBTs featuring the novel base material and type-II band alignment have not been well studied. This thesis investigated type-II GaAsSb DHBTs in the following aspects: periphery surface recombination current, Kirk effect, two dimensional (2 D) simulation and device optimization. The present work provided insights into device operation, and guidances for further device development. A series of physical models and parameters was implemented in 2 D device simulations using ISE TCAD. Band gap narrowing (BGN) in the bases was characterized by comparing experimental and simulated results. Excellent agreements between the measured and simulated DC and RF results were achieved. Emitter size effects associated with the surface recombination current were experimentally characterized for emitter sizes of 0. 5 by 6 to 80 by 80 square micrometer. The 2 D simulations by implementing surface state models revealed the mechanism for the surface recombination current. Two device structures were proposed to diminish surface recombination current. Numerical simulations for type-II GaAsSb-InP <b>base-collector</b> (BC) <b>junctions</b> showed that conventional base "push-out" does not occur at high injection levels, and instead the electric field at the BC junction is reversed and an electron barrier at the base side evolves. The electron barrier was found {{to play an important}} role in the Kirk effect, and the electron tunnelling through the barrier delays the onset of the Kirk effect. This novel mechanism was supported by the measurement for GaAsSb/InP DHBTs with two base doping levels. The study also showed that the magnitude of the electric field at the BC junction at zero collector current directly affects onset of the Kirk effect. Finally, optimizations for the emitter, base and collector were carried out through 2 D simulations.

40|$|Two {{types of}} photodetectors {{containing}} Ge/Si quantum dots have been fabricated based on materials grown by {{molecular beam epitaxy}} and characterized with several experimental techniques. The aim was to study new device architectures {{with the implementation of}} Ge nanostructures, in order to obtain high detection efficiency in the near infrared range at room temperature. Heterojunction bipolar phototransistors were fabricated with 10 Ge dot layers in the <b>base-collector</b> (b-c) <b>junction.</b> With the illumination of near infrared radiation at 1. 31 to 1. 55 µm, the incident light would excite the carriers. The applied field across the b-c junction caused hole transport into the base, leading to a reduced potential barrier between the emitter-base (e-b) junction. Subsequently, this resulted in enhanced injection of electrons across the base into the collector, i. e., forming an amplified photo-induced current. We have therefore obtained significantly enhanced photo-response for the Ge-dot based phototransistors, compared to corresponding quantum dot p-i-n photodiodes. Responsivity values up to 470 mA/W were measured at 1. 31 µm using waveguide geometry, and ∼ 2. 5 A/W at 850 nm, while the dark current was as low as 0. 01 mA/cm 2 at – 2 V. Metal-oxide field-effect phototransistors were also studied. These lateral detectors were processed with three terminals for source, drain and gate contacts. The Ge quantum dot layers were sandwiched between pseudomorphically grown SiGe quantum wells. The detector devices were processed using a multi-finger comb structure with an isolated gate contact on top of each finger and patterned metal contacts on the side edges for source and drain. It was found that the photo-responsivity was increased by a factor of more than 20 when a proper gate bias was applied. With VG above threshold, the measured response was 350 and > 30 mA/W at 1. 31 and 1. 55 µm, respectively. Properties of Si/Si 1 -xGex nanostructures were examined, in order to facilitate proper design of the above mentioned transistor types of photodetectors. The carrier recombination processes were characterized by photoluminescence measurements, and the results revealed a gradual change from spatially indirect to direct transitions in type II Si 1 -xGex islands with increased measurement temperature. Energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry of buried Ge islands produced at different temperatures indicated a gradual decrease of the Ge concentration with temperature, which was due to the enhanced intermixing of Si and Ge atoms. At a deposition temperature of 730 °C the Ge concentration was as low as around 40 %. Finally, the thermal stability of the Si/SiGe(110) material system, which is a promising candidate for future CMOS technology due to its high carrier mobility, was investigated by high resolution X-ray diffraction reciprocal space mapping.

In normal operation the base-emitter junction does indeed form a diode, but in most cases it is undesirable for the <b>base-collector</b> <b>junction</b> to behave as a diode.

50|$|The {{principal}} {{difference between}} the BJT and HBT is {{in the use of}} differing semiconductor materials for the emitter-base junction and the <b>base-collector</b> <b>junction,</b> creating a heterojunction. The effect is to limit the injection of holes from the base into the emitter region, since the potential barrier in the valence band is higher than in the conduction band. Unlike BJT technology, this allows a high doping density {{to be used in the}} base, reducing the base resistance while maintaining gain. The efficiency of the heterojunction is measured by the Kroemer factor, named after Herbert Kroemer who was awarded a Nobel Prize in 2000 for his work in this field at the University of California, Santa Barbara.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{drawback}} of the Darlington pair is its increased [...] "saturation" [...] voltage. The {{output transistor}} {{is not allowed}} to saturate (i.e. its <b>base-collector</b> <b>junction</b> must remain reverse-biased) because the first transistor, when saturated, establishes full (100%) parallel negative feedback between the collector and the base of the second transistor.

(In symbols, [...] always.) Thus the [...] "saturation" [...] voltage of a Darlington transistor is one VBE (about 0.65 V in silicon) higher than a single transistor saturation voltage, which is typically 0.1 - 0.2 V in silicon. For equal collector currents, this drawback translates to an increase in the dissipated power for the Darlington transistor over a single transistor. The increased low output level can cause troubles when TTL logic circuits are driven.|$|E
50|$|BJTs {{have three}} terminals, {{corresponding}} to the three layers of semiconductor—an emitter, a base, and a collector. They are useful in amplifiers because the currents at the emitter and collector are controllable by a relatively small base current. In an n-p-n transistor operating in the active region, the emitter-base junction is forward biased (electrons and holes recombine at the junction), and electrons are injected into the base region. Because the base is narrow, most of these electrons will diffuse into the reverse-biased (electrons and holes are formed at, and {{move away from the}} junction) <b>base-collector</b> <b>junction</b> and be swept into the collector; perhaps one-hundredth of the electrons will recombine in the base, which is the dominant mechanism in the base current. By controlling the number of electrons that can leave the base, the number of electrons entering the collector can be controlled. Collector current is approximately β (common-emitter current gain) times the base current.

A phenomenon called current steering means that when two voltage-stable elements with different threshold voltages are connected in parallel, the current flows through the path with the smaller threshold voltage. That is, current flows out of this input and into the zero (low) voltage source. As a result, no current flows through the base of the output transistor, causing it to stop conducting and the output voltage becomes high (logical one). During the transition the input transistor is briefly in its active region; so it draws a large current away {{from the base of the}} output transistor and thus quickly discharges its base.
