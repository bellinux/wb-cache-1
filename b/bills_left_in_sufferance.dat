He left Columbia for Monument to manage a new studio set up by Foster at 315 Seventh Street North in Nashville. Porter found the studio's acoustic space to be superior to RCA's Studio B—it was a high-ceilinged room built to house a Masonic Lodge—but the audio equipment owned by Foster was inferior. The EMT plate was not as good for reverb effects. No top ten hits were engineered by Porter at Foster's studio.|$|R

Dark Horse Comics began issuing reprints with the ongoing licensed series Creepy Archives in 2008, and began publishing new material with Creepy vol. 2 in 2009 and Eerie vol. 2 in 2012.|$|R
60|$|The {{business}} I had had {{now with}} {{a great many people}} for receiving such large sums and selling jewels of such considerable value gave me opportunity to know and converse with several of the best merchants of the place, so that I wanted no direction now how to get my money remitted to England. Applying, therefore, to several merchants, that I might neither risk it all on the credit of one merchant, nor suffer any single man to know the quantity of money I had; I say, applying myself to several merchants, I got bills of exchange payable in London for all my money. The first bills I took with me; the second <b>bills</b> I <b>left</b> <b>in</b> trust (in case of any disaster at sea) {{in the hands of the}} first merchant, him to whom I was recommended by my friend from Paris.|$|R

Mountain climber, Lincoln Hall, quotes lyrics from Binks' song in his book, White Limbo: The first Australian climb of Mt Everest (1985). The EP Semantics charted on the Australian Singles Charts to reach No. 1 and consequently some sources list [...] "Reckless" [...] as a No. 1 single.

At {{some point in the}} late 70s or early 80s the group's manager had trademarked the name and assets of The Vogues. He then sold the trademark to another promoter who starting booking other quartets as The Vogues. The trademark was sold several times resulting in several groups of singers claiming to be the Vogues. In 2000 the trademark was purchased by vocalist and Pittsburgh area native Stan Elich, who eventually would make this group the true Vogues. During these years Blasko continued to perform as The Vogues, and clash with the trademark group. At one point Blasko testified in front of Congress on The Truth In Music Act. A lawsuit filed by Blasko ended with the Pennsylvania court permitting Blasko's Vogues to perform in 14 Western Pennsylvania counties and the trademark group to perform everywhere else in the world as The Vogues. Chuck Blasko's Vogues continue to perform in Western Pennsylvania.|$|R

60|$|There was, however, {{a certain}} vein of dogged {{persistency}} in Clarence Weston; and, almost intolerably galling as he-found it, {{he would still}} have continued to obtrude his presence on gentlemen who had no desire whatever to be favored with it, and to waylay them in the hotels, but {{for the fact that}} the little money he had brought with him was rapidly running out. One can, in case of stern necessity, put one's pride in one's pocket, though the operation is occasionally painful, but one cannot dispense with food and shelter, and the latter are not, as a rule, to be obtained in a Canadian city except in exchange for money. Weston, who had had no lunch that day, took out the little roll of <b>bills</b> still <b>left</b> <b>in</b> his wallet, and, when he had flicked them over, it became unpleasantly clear that he could not prosecute the campaign more than a very few days longer. Then he took out his pipe, and, filling it carefully, broke off a sulphur match from the block in his pocket. He felt that this was an extravagance, but he was in need just then of consolation. He had wandered up on the mountain, past the reservoir and the M'Gill University, after a singularly discouraging afternoon, to wait until supper should be ready at his boarding-house.|$|R
