5000|$|The {{cause of}} feline {{hyperesthesia}} syndrome is unknown. Some experts believe FHS to {{be a form}} of epilepsy, while others believe it is a <b>behavioural</b> <b>disorder</b> triggered by trauma. Noting that affected cats tend to be dominating rather than submissive, some research argues that FHS is conflict displacement in which the cat acts out thwarted territorial disputes on its own body.|$|E
5000|$|One {{can also}} use the 5 scales of the SDQ either as {{dimensions}} (range 0-10) or else categorised into three- or four-categories in a similar was as is done for the total difficulty score. Alternatively, one can combine scales such that emotional+peer problems scales form a larger internalising scale (range 0-20) and the conduct + hyperactivity scales form a larger externalising scale (range 0=20). Research suggests that in low-risk groups (e.g. a general population sample) the latter approach may be preferable, as there is less discrimination between the finer scales for lower scores (e.g. {{a child with a}} score of 2 on the hyperactivity scale is at increased risk of hyperactivity and <b>behavioural</b> <b>disorder</b> to a roughly equal degree). By contrast in high-risk samples (e.g. a clinic setting) the 5 finer scales may come into their own, as there is much more discrimination between them at higher scores (e.g. a child with a score of 7 on the hyperactivity scale is specifically at greater risk of a hyperactivity disorder, to a greater degree than they are at increased risk of a <b>behavioural</b> <b>disorder)</b> ...|$|E

50|$|A study {{published}} in the British Journal of Psychiatry by Sequeira, Howlin, & Hollins found that sexual abuse is associated with a higher incidence of psychiatric and <b>behavioural</b> <b>disorder</b> in people with learning disabilities in a case-control study. Sexual abuse was associated with increased rates of mental illness and behavioural problems, and with symptoms of post-traumatic stress. Psychological reactions to abuse were similar to those observed in the general population, but with the addition of stereotypical behaviour. The more serious the abuse, the more severe the symptoms that were reported.|$|E
50|$|Feather-plucking, {{sometimes}} termed feather-picking, feather damaging behaviour or pterotillomania, is a maladaptive, <b>behavioural</b> <b>disorder</b> commonly seen in captive birds which chew, bite or pluck {{their own}} feathers with their beak, resulting in {{damage to the}} feathers and occasionally the skin. It is especially common among Psittaciformes, with an estimated 10% of captive parrots exhibiting the disorder. The areas {{of the body that}} are mainly pecked or plucked are the more accessible regions such as the neck, chest, flank, inner thigh and ventral wing area. Contour and down feathers are generally identified as the main target, although in some cases, tail and flight feathers are affected. Although feather-plucking shares characteristics with feather pecking commonly seen in commercial poultry, the two behaviours are currently considered to be distinct as in the latter, the birds peck at and pull out the feathers of other individuals.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to his research, the book is informed by Thompson's experience as a former alcoholic and his participation in the Alcoholics Anonymous Twelve-Step sobriety program. He rejects the brain disease theory of addiction (an example of which is disease theory of alcoholism), arguing that addiction is instead a voluntary and reversible <b>behavioural</b> <b>disorder</b> based on the brain's reward system, namely the mesolimbic pathway. Thompson argues that addiction is universally being fostered by technology and the social environment for commercial purposes, pointing to sugar addiction from sugar-rich foods such as cupcakes, addictions to pornography, video games, shopping, and drugs such as alcohol, caffeine; illegal drugs such as cocaine and heroin, and controlled medical drugs — such as zopiclone — obtained via prescription or without one from an online pharmacy. He believes that the boundaries between everyday addictions and less socially acceptable ones are becoming increasingly blurred, and also perceives an overlap between them, citing evidence that sugar triggers [...] "the brain's natural opioids," [...] and that the brain can become addicted {{to them in the}} same way that it does to morphine or heroin.|$|E

5000|$|Organic {{personality}} disorder (OPD) {{is not included}} in the wide variety of group of {{personality disorder}}s. For this reason, the symptoms and diagnostic criteria of the organic personality disorder are {{different from those of the}} mental health disorders, which are included in this various group of personality disorders. According to the Tenth Revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems ICD-10, this disorder is a type of mental health <b>behavioural</b> <b>disorder.</b> The Fourth Revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM-IV defines the organic personality disorder as the personality change, which is caused by traumatic brain injury (TBI) that means there are specific brain areas of patients, which have been injured after a very strong accident. Moreover, according to the ICD-10, the organic personality disorder is associated with a [...] "significant alteration of the habitual patterns of premorbid behaviour". Furthermore, organic personality disorder is associated with [...] "personality change due to general medical condition". There are crucial influences on emotions, impulses and personal needs because of this disorder. Thus, all these definitions about the organic personality disorder support that this type of disorder is associated with changes in personality and behaviour.|$|E

In a practical part of the thesis the author chose a quatitative research, in which she analysed data of clients allowed from 2001 to 2005. The programme Borouk" is evaluated on the basis of data about resocialization of those clients. There is a case study enclosed in the text. In the closing part of the thesis, the programme Borouk" is evaluated as a suitable programme, which helps clients with the <b>behavioural</b> <b>disorder</b> to socialize. The results show that a wide range of aspects of lifes of a group of examined clients were improved. In spite of their suitable integration and related elimination of negative social phenomenons, it is necessary to provide the clients with <b>behavioural</b> <b>disorder</b> with lifelong assistance and support.

40|$|The {{management}} {{and needs of}} people with intellectual disability (ID) and epilepsy are well evidenced; less so, the comorbidity of <b>behavioural</b> <b>disorder</b> in this population. ‘Behavioural disorder’ is defined as behaviours that are difficult or disruptive, including stereotypes, difficult or disruptive behaviour, aggressive behaviour toward other people, behaviours that lead to injury to self or others, and destruction of property. These have an important link to emotional disturbance. This report, produced by the Intellectual Disability Task Force of the Neuropsychiatric Commission of the ILAE, aims to provide {{a brief review of}} some key areas of concern regarding <b>behavioural</b> <b>disorder</b> among this population, and proposes a range of research and clinical practice recommendations generated by Task Force members.

40|$|Background: Teachers have a {{significant}} {{role to play in}} identifying children with mental health problems. However, teachers’ perceptions of children’s mental health problems are relatively unexplored. Method: Primary school teachers (N = 113) completed a questionnaire, composed of vignettes describing children with symptoms of a common emotional disorder and a common <b>behavioural</b> <b>disorder,</b> following which they were asked a number of questions regarding problem recognition and help-seeking. Results: Teachers were able to recognise the existence of a problem and rate its severity. They were significantly more concerned about a vignette of a child with symptoms of a <b>behavioural</b> <b>disorder</b> than an emotional disorder. The gender of the child was found to independently predict teachers’ accurately recognising when a child had a problem. Conclusion: Teachers are good at recognising whether a child presents with a problem. However, their problem recognition is affected by both the gender of the child and the type of symptomatology being displayed (emotional versus behavioural) ...|$|E
