5|$|It was at {{this stage}} that the attack began to go seriously wrong. Strong winds <b>blowing</b> <b>off</b> the land swept the smoke screen {{into the face of}} the {{advancing}} cruisers, blinding their commanders who attempted to navigate by dead reckoning. The same wind disclosed the Inshore Squadron to the German defenders who immediately opened up a withering fire on the blockships. With their volunteer crews suffering heavy casualties, the commanders increased speed despite the poor visibility and continued groping through the narrow channels inshore, searching for the Stroom Bank buoy which directed shipping into the canal.|$|E
5|$|These winds {{resulted}} in widespread agricultural, environmental and structural damage. Hundreds of structures sustained severe damage, mostly consisting of roofs <b>blowing</b> <b>off.</b> The most severe losses {{took place in}} Albany where most homes had partial or complete roof failure. Air-borne debris also damaged buildings during the storm. Nearly 80% of the apple crop {{was lost in the}} Donnybrook-Manjimup area. A total of 154,400m3 (5.4million ft3) of timber was lost as well as a potential 200,000m3 (7million ft3) of future growth on established trees. Widespread dust storms also ruined crops and removed topsoil from many areas. Near the coast, the combined effects of strong, onshore winds and little rain led to significant inland sea spray. Numerous power lines and stations failed during the storm due to winds as well as dust and salt accretion. Large portions of the South-West Land Division were without electricity due to Cyclone Alby; Perth nearly sustained a complete breakdown of power services. This led to secondary losses attributable to the storm such as production failure.|$|E
25|$|An {{attack by}} the Japanese was repulsed, but the other Marine's weapon jammed and he {{returned}} to the command post to obtain another. While he was gone, the enemy managed to get a grenade in the foxhole, which exploded, <b>blowing</b> <b>off</b> Sgt Harrell's left hand.|$|E
50|$|High winds toppled many {{trees in}} north west Germany, with the strongest wind field {{impacting}} the East Frisian islands and Heligoland. Storm damages occurred principally across {{the states of}} Lower Saxony, Bremen, Hamburg and Schleswig Holstein, with lesser damages reported in North Rhine-Westphalia and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.On the East Frisian island of Nordeney footage of a roof being <b>blown</b> <b>off</b> in the high winds was captured.

25|$|The coastal resorts of Sussex and {{neighbouring}} Hampshire are the sunniest {{places in}} the United Kingdom. The coast has consistently more sunshine than the inland areas: sea breezes, <b>blowing</b> <b>off</b> the sea, tend to clear any cloud from the coast. Most of Sussex lies in Hardiness zone 8; the exception is the coastal plain west of Brighton, which lies in the milder zone 9.|$|E
25|$|On 10 July 1943 U-177 {{struck the}} unescorted 7,176 ton American Liberty ship Alice F. Palmer {{with a single}} torpedo in the stern, <b>blowing</b> <b>off</b> the {{propeller}} and rudder, flooding the engine room, and breaking {{the back of the}} ship. The crew of 68 abandoned their vessel in four lifeboats, and after questioning them, U-177 shelled the ship, firing 14 incendiary and 85 high-explosive rounds. The burning ship slowly sank. The four lifeboats eventually sailed to Madagascar.|$|E

25|$|If these homeostats are compromised, then a {{respiratory}} acidosis, or a {{respiratory alkalosis}} will occur. In {{the long run}} these can be compensated by renal adjustments to the H+ and HCO3− concentrations in the plasma; but since this takes time, the hyperventilation syndrome can, for instance, occur when agitation or anxiety cause a person to breathe fast and deeply thus causing a distressing respiratory alkalosis through the <b>blowing</b> <b>off</b> of too much CO2 from the blood into the outside air.|$|E
25|$|On 12–13 May 1945, Rifleman Lachhiman Gurung was {{manning the}} most forward post of his platoon which bore {{the brunt of}} an attack by at least 200 of the enemy. Twice he hurled back grenades which had fallen on his trench, but the third {{exploded}} in his right hand, <b>blowing</b> <b>off</b> his fingers, shattering his arm and severely wounding him in the face, body and right leg. His two comrades were also badly wounded but the rifleman, now alone and disregarding his wounds, loaded and fired his rifle {{with his left hand}} for four hours, calmly waiting for each attack which he met with fire at point blank range. Afterwards, when the casualties were counted, it is reported that there were 31 dead Japanese around his position which he had killed, with only one arm.|$|E

25|$|The British {{flotilla}} {{were moving}} westward down the Channel when the German ships were detected by radar just after 01:00 on 9 June. Jones turned his force {{to meet the}} Germans, who were by now 30 miles east-northeast of the Ile de Batz. The two flotillas clashed intermittently thereafter, exchanging gunfire and salvoes of torpedoes. Tartar was struck several times, but {{was able to put}} out fires and restore her speed. ZH1 was then engaged by both Tartar and Ashanti, with Ashanti launching two torpedoes at point-blank range. One struck ZH1, <b>blowing</b> <b>off</b> her bows. With the ship crippled, her captain, Klaus Barckow gave the order to abandon ship, then scuttled her with depth charges at 02:40. Barckow was among the 39 killed. Twenty-eight managed to reach France, the remaining 140 were picked up by the British.|$|E
25|$|Her next patrol (now in {{the hands}} of Stephen H. Ambruster) began on 24 July 1942 at Pearl Harbor, ending on 19 September at Fremantle, Australia. Tambor searched for enemy {{shipping}} in the Marshall Islands. On 7 August near Wotje Atoll, she sank the converted net tender Shofaka with one torpedo which broke her in half. Tambor remained in the Marshalls until 19 August when she was ordered to patrol the southern passages to Truk. As there was time to spare before she was to take station there, she prowled through the Caroline Islands. On 21 August near Ponape, the submarine fired a spread of three torpedoes at a freighter and her escort. The first hit the target amidships and the other two aft, <b>blowing</b> <b>off</b> the stern. Shinsei Maru No. Six quickly sank. On 1 September, she fired four torpedoes at a tanker off Truk and damaged it with one hit. She was credited with two ships for 12,000tons; this was reduced to 5,800tons postwar.|$|E
500|$|In Lum's account, the bomb-thrower's name [...] "was never {{mentioned}} in the trial and is today unknown to the public." [...] Paul Avrich attests that Lum urged Albert Parsons to refuse clemency, and plotted to rescue the anarchists from Cook County Jail by attacking it with explosives. According to de Cleyre, he then assisted the suicide {{of one of the}} eight defendants, Louis Lingg, by smuggling into Lingg's prison cell a dynamite cap concealed in a cigar, which Lingg subsequently lit, thereby <b>blowing</b> <b>off</b> half his face and leaving himself lingering for several hours in torturous pain before dying.|$|E

500|$|On {{the boat}} deck, as the crew began {{preparing}} the lifeboats, {{it was difficult}} to hear anything over the noise of high-pressure steam being vented from the boilers and escaping via the valves on the funnels above. Lawrence Beesley described the sound as [...] "a harsh, deafening boom that made conversation difficult; if one imagines 20 locomotives <b>blowing</b> <b>off</b> steam in a low key it would give some idea of the unpleasant sound that met us as we climbed out on the top deck." [...] The noise was so loud that the crew had to use hand signals to communicate.|$|E
500|$|Shortly before {{transitioning}} into an extratropical cyclone, {{the hurricane}} {{moved across the}} extreme southeastern portion of Newfoundland at Category1 intensity. As a result, high winds were reported across the region; wind speeds of 90mph (145km/h) occurred on the Burin Peninsula. Wind damage occurred throughout the island, although mostly limited to broken windows, trees being uprooted, and fences knocked over. [...] In addition, a house under construction blew over in Marystown; another house was abandoned in St. John's for {{the fear of the}} roof <b>blowing</b> <b>off.</b> Hydro poles also caught fire in Burin and Grand Banks. Rough seas caused by the storm sunk or damage several fishing dories in Grand Bank and three fishing premises were washed away in Lamaline. In addition, a fishing ramp was washed out to sea in Lourdes Cove. Damage in the Burin Peninsula alone totaled to thousands of dollars, although the exact figure is unknown.|$|E
500|$|Another {{well-known}} duel in the American West {{happened in}} Fort Worth, Texas, and {{was known as}} the Luke Short-Jim Courtright Duel. Timothy Isaiah [...] "Longhair Jim" [...] Courtright was running the T.I.C. Commercial agency in Fort Worth, which provided [...] "protection" [...] to gambling dens and saloons in return for a portion of their profits. At the same time, Luke Short, a former friend of Courtright's, was running the White Elephant Saloon and Jim was trying to get Short to utilize his services. But the Dodge City gunfighter told Courtright to [...] "go to Hell," [...] that he could do anything that was necessary {{to take care of his}} business. On February 8, 1887, the two quarreled, and with Bat Masterson at Short's side, Courtright and Short dueled in the street. They drew their pistols at close range, and Short fired first, <b>blowing</b> <b>off</b> Courtright's thumb. Courtright attempted the [...] "border shift", a move where a gunfighter switches his gun to his uninjured hand, but he was too slow. Short shot him in the chest, killing him.|$|E

500|$|Devastation was {{widespread}} {{throughout the state}} of Massachusetts, with high winds and heavy snow averaging [...] causing significant havoc. In Boston, strong winds, described as [...] "unprecedented in the annals" [...] of the city, were documented during the afternoon of 9October, with the intense gusts <b>blowing</b> <b>off</b> the steeple of the Old North Church. The steeple was eventually repaired and restored several times, yet was blown down by once more in 1954 by Hurricane Carol and mended once again. Meanwhile, {{the roof of the}} King's Chapel was tossed [...] from its initial location, landing on an adjacent house and crushing two carriages into pieces. Churches and meetinghouses in Salem, Beverly, Charlestown, and Danvers were also seriously impaired. A residence in Boston caved in, killing one person and injuring three others, and consequently was to be demolished. All across the state, the storm bent and crumpled structures and also ruined many wharves. In Dighton and Milton, winds toppled several homes, while shipping was impacted by the storm in Gloucester. Property damage throughout the state– especially to chimneys, roofs, and windows– was generally severe, with chimneys even falling onto stage coaches in the streets of Boston. The Charlestown Navy Yard was dismantled to prevent its imminent collapse, and in Peabody, more than 30,000unburnt bricks were wrecked.|$|E
500|$|Beatty's battlecruisers led the British fleet in its attack, casting {{south into}} the North Sea {{to find the}} enemy during the {{afternoon}} of 31 May 1916. At 14:15, scouting cruisers spotted the German vanguard and Beatty closed to attack the enemy with his main force. Given time to prepare, Hipper was ready for Beatty with his battlecruisers in line to face Beatty's approaching ships with their full broadsides. Hipper was also encouraged by the main German battleship fleet under Vice-Admiral Reinhard Scheer, which was steaming northwards close behind him. At 15:45 Beatty came within range of the German fleet and the vanguards engaged one another with their opening fusillades. As the two squadrons closed, the Germans found the range better and faster than the British, who were silhouetted against the sun. As a result, German shells pounded the British ships while the German ships remained untouched for the first 10minutes of the engagement. During {{this stage of the}} battle Lion was hit by nine shells from [...] One shell at 16:00 struck the right upper corner of the left hand gun port at the junction of the face plate and the roof, and punched a piece of the 9-inch face plate into the turret before detonating, <b>blowing</b> <b>off</b> the armoured roof of the turret and starting a fire, which a damage control party working from outside the turret fought to put out.|$|E
500|$|That {{night he}} {{received}} word to expect an attack {{the following day}} by British capital ships escorted by {{a large number of}} destroyers and supported by carrier aircraft. The battleship [...] and nine destroyers duly appeared on 13 April, although earlier than Commander Bey had expected, and caught the Germans by surprise. Koellner {{had not been able to}} reach Tårstad and Lieutenant Commander (Fregattenkapitän) Alfred Schulze-Hinrichs, the ship's captain, had decided to anchor near Djupvik on the south side of the fjord instead. As the British ships approached, Koellner was spotted by the Supermarine Walrus amphibian from Warspite and the leading British destroyers were fully prepared when they came around the headland behind which Koellner was hiding. The range was so close, , that the three British ships were able to use their light automatic weapons to silence the German ship's guns and they set her on fire as well as <b>blowing</b> <b>off</b> her bow with a torpedo. The [...] semi-armor-piercing shells from Warspite went through the ship without detonating, but visibly tilted her over each time. Thirty-one crewmen were killed, and 34 wounded, but none of the British ships were even damaged. Erich Koellner was scuttled shortly afterwards by detonating a depth charge in her auxiliary machinery spaces. In the aftermath of the battle, 155 of the ship's crew, including Schulze-Hinrichs, were taken prisoner by Norwegian forces. The captured crewmen were first incarcerated in Vardøhus Fortress in Finnmark and later transferred to Skorpa prisoner of war camp in Troms until released after the end of the Norwegian Campaign. The wreck was raised and scrapped in 1963.|$|E
