The half life of psilocybin is 163±64minutes when taken orally, or 74.1±19.6minutes when injected intravenously. A dosage of 4–10mg, corresponding roughly to 50–300micrograms per kilogram (µg/kg) of body weight, is required to induce psychedelic effects. A typical recreational dosage is 10–50mg psilocybin, which is roughly equivalent to 10–50grams of fresh mushrooms, or 1–5grams of dried mushrooms. A {{small number of people}} are unusually sensitive to psilocybin, such that a normally threshold-level dose of about 2mg can result in effects usually associated with medium or high doses.

25|$|Some {{supporters}} of PMS {{as a social}} construct believe PMDD and PMS to be unrelated issues: according to them, PMDD {{is a product of}} <b>brain</b> <b>chemistry,</b> and PMS is a product of a hypochondriatic culture.

According to sociologist Carol Tavris, Western women are socially conditioned to expect PMS or to at least know of its existence, and they therefore report their symptoms accordingly. The anthropologist Emily Martin argues that PMS is a cultural phenomenon that continues to grow in a positive feedback loop, and thus is a social construction that contributes to learned helplessness or convenient excuse. Tavris says that PMS is blamed as an explanation for rage or sadness. The decision to call PMDD an illness has been criticized as inappropriate medicalization. In both cases, they are referring to the emotional aspects, not the normal physical symptoms that are subjectively present.|$|E
50|$|When {{people are}} seeking a leader {{they look for}} qualities like honesty, intelligence, creativity, and charisma, but a leader {{also needs to be}} driven and be willing to {{challenge}} certain ideas and practices. The fact is that the psychological profile of a great leader is a compulsive risk-taker. It has been realized that what is sought in leaders is often the same kind of personality found in addicts, whether they are addicted to alcohol, drugs, or sex.The reason that this connection exists is because pleasure is a motivator that is central to learning. Dopamine can be artificially created by substances that carry a risk for addiction, like cocaine, heroin, nicotine and alcohol. People with risk-taking and obsessive personality traits, which are often found in addicts, can be useful in becoming a leader.

Importantly, many important neuronal proteins are also O-GlcNAc modified, and aberrant O-GlcNAcylation of these proteins {{may contribute to the}} pathology of neurodegenerative diseases although these mechanisms have not been well defined. Here we investigated the role of O-GlcNAc glycosylation in the <b>brain,</b> utilizing both <b>chemistry</b> and molecular biology to study O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), the enzyme that adds the sugar modification. To evaluate the role of OGT in adult neurons, we generated a forebrain-specific conditional knockout of OGT (OGT cKO) in mice. Although indistinguishable from wild-type littermates at birth, after three weeks we observe progressive neurodegeneration in OGT cKO mice. Hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease, including neuronal loss, neuroinflammation, behavioral deficits, hyperphosphorylated tau, and amyloid beta peptide accumulation, are observed. Furthermore, decreases in OGT protein levels were found in human AD brain tissue, suggesting that altered O-GlcNAcylation likely contributes to neurodegenerative diseases in humans. This model is one of a few mouse models that recapitulate AD phenotypes without mutating and overexpressing human tau, amyloid precursor protein, or presenilin, highlighting the essential role of OGT in neurodegenerative pathways. Given the importance of OGT in the brain, we further investigated the regulation of the OGT enzyme by phosphorylation. We found that phosphorylation of OGT near its C-terminus reduces its activity in cancer cells, and have developed phosphorylation-specific antibodies to aid mechanistic studies. Furthermore, mutation of this phosphorylation site on OGT, followed by overexpression in neurons was shown to enhance neurite outgrowth, demonstrating a functional consequence for this site. Thus phosphorylation of OGT inhibits its activity and enhances neurite outgrowth, and current studies aim to characterize the signaling pathway that regulates OGT phosphorylation in neurons. </p...|$|R
