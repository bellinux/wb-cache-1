5|$|The <b>biogeochemistry</b> of cadmium and {{its release}} to the {{environment}} {{has been the subject}} of review, as has the speciation of cadmium in the environment.|$|E
5|$|The {{ecology of}} global carbon budgets gives {{one example of}} the linkage between {{biodiversity}} and <b>biogeochemistry.</b> It is estimated that the Earth's oceans hold 40,000 gigatonnes (Gt) of carbon, that vegetation and soil hold 2070 Gt, and that fossil fuel emissions are 6.3 Gt carbon per year. There have been major restructurings in these global carbon budgets during the Earth's history, regulated to a large extent by the ecology of the land. For example, through the early-mid Eocene volcanic outgassing, the oxidation of methane stored in wetlands, and seafloor gases increased atmospheric CO2 (carbon dioxide) concentrations to levels as high as 3500ppm.|$|E
5|$|Biomes {{are larger}} units of {{organization}} that categorize {{regions of the}} Earth's ecosystems, mainly according to the structure and composition of vegetation. There are different methods to define the continental boundaries of biomes dominated by different functional types of vegetative communities that are limited in distribution by climate, precipitation, weather and other environmental variables. Biomes include tropical rainforest, temperate broadleaf and mixed forest, temperate deciduous forest, taiga, tundra, hot desert, and polar desert. Other researchers have recently categorized other biomes, such as the human and oceanic microbiomes. To a microbe, {{the human body is}} a habitat and a landscape. Microbiomes were discovered largely through advances in molecular genetics, which have revealed a hidden richness of microbial diversity on the planet. The oceanic microbiome plays {{a significant role in the}} ecological <b>biogeochemistry</b> of the planet's oceans.|$|E
5|$|Ecologists {{study and}} measure {{nutrient}} budgets {{to understand how}} these materials are regulated, flow, and recycled through the environment. This research {{has led to an}} understanding that there is global feedback between ecosystems and the physical parameters of this planet, including minerals, soil, pH, ions, water, and atmospheric gases. Six major elements (hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and phosphorus; H, C, N, O, S, and P) form the constitution of all biological macromolecules and feed into the Earth's geochemical processes. From the smallest scale of biology, the combined effect of billions upon billions of ecological processes amplify and ultimately regulate the biogeochemical cycles of the Earth. Understanding the relations and cycles mediated between these elements and their ecological pathways has significant bearing toward understanding global <b>biogeochemistry.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Biogeochemistry</b> is {{a systems}} science that synthesizes {{the study of}} biological, geological, and {{chemical}} processes to understand the reactions and composition of the natural environment. It is concerned primarily with global elemental cycles, {{such as that of}} nitrogen and carbon. The father of <b>biogeochemistry</b> was James Lovelock, whose “Gaia hypothesis” proposed that Earth’s biological, chemical, and geologic systems interact to stabilize the conditions on Earth that support life.|$|E
25|$|Example {{research}} projects are {{to examine the}} <b>biogeochemistry</b> and microbial ecology of septic drain field soils used to treat domestic wastewater, the role of anecic earthworms in controlling the movement of water and nitrogen cycle in agricultural soils, and the assessment of soil quality in turf production.|$|E
25|$|Geobiology is a {{field of}} {{scientific}} research that explores the interactions between the physical Earth and the biosphere. It is a relatively young field, and its borders are fluid. There is considerable overlap with the fields of ecology, evolutionary biology, microbiology, paleontology, and particularly <b>biogeochemistry.</b> Geobiology applies the principles and methods of biology and geology {{to the study of}} the ancient history of the co-evolution of life and Earth as well as the role of life in the modern world. Geobiologic studies tend to be focused on microorganisms, and on the role that life plays in altering the chemical and physical environment of the lithosphere, atmosphere, hydrosphere and/or cryosphere. It differs from <b>biogeochemistry</b> in that the focus is on processes and organisms over space and time rather than on global chemical cycles.|$|E
25|$|Hydrogen isotope <b>biogeochemistry</b> is the {{scientific}} study of biological, geological, and chemical processes in the environment using the distribution and relative abundance of hydrogen isotopes. There are two stable isotopes of hydrogen, protium 1H and deuterium 2H, which vary in relative abundance on the order of hundreds of permil. The ratio between these two species can be considered the hydrogen isotopic fingerprint of a substance. Understanding isotopic fingerprints and the sources of fractionation that lead to variation between them can be applied to address a diverse array of questions ranging from ecology and hydrology to geochemistry and paleoclimate reconstructions. Since specialized techniques are required to measure natural hydrogen isotope abundance ratios, the field of hydrogen isotope <b>biogeochemistry</b> provides uniquely specialized tools to more traditional fields like ecology and geochemistry.|$|E
25|$|Biotic {{metabolism}} {{is directly}} {{tied to the}} global cycling of elements and compounds on Earth. The geochemical environment fuels life, which then produces different molecules that go into the external environment. (This is directly relevant to <b>biogeochemistry.)</b> In addition, biochemical reactions are catalyzed by enzymes which sometimes prefer one isotope over others. For example, oxygenic photosynthesis is catalyzed by RuBisCO, which prefers carbon-12 over carbon-13, resulting in carbon isotope fractionation in the rock record.|$|E
25|$|Geobiochemistry {{is similar}} to <b>biogeochemistry,</b> but differs by placing {{emphasis}} {{on the effects of}} geology on the development of life’s biochemical processes, as distinct from the role of life on Earth’s cycles. Its primary goal is to link biological changes, encompassing evolutionary modifications of genes and changes in the expression of genes and proteins, to changes in the temperature, pressure, and composition of geochemical processes to understand when and how metabolism evolved. Geobiochemistry is founded on the notion that life is a planetary response because metabolic catalysis enables the release of energy trapped by a cooling planet.|$|E
25|$|Kinetic isotope {{effects are}} common in {{biological}} systems and are especially important for hydrogen isotope <b>biogeochemistry.</b> Kinetic effects usually result in larger fractionations than equilibrium reactions. In any isotope system, kinetic effects are stronger for larger mass differences. Light isotopes in most systems also tend to move faster but form weaker bonds. At high temperatures, entropy explains a large signal in isotope composition. However, when temperature decreases isotope effects are more expressed and randomness plays less of a role. These general trends are exposed in further understanding of bond breaking, diffusion or effusion, and condensation or evaporation reactions.|$|E
25|$|As {{its name}} suggests, geobiology {{is closely related}} to many other fields of study, and does not have clearly defined {{boundaries}} or perfect agreement on what exactly they comprise. Some practitioners take a very broad view of its boundaries, encompassing many older, more established fields such as <b>biogeochemistry,</b> paleontology, and microbial ecology. Others take a more narrow view, assigning it to emerging research that falls between these existing fields, such as with geomicrobiology. The following list includes both those that are clearly a part of geobiology, e.g. geomicrobiology, as well as those that share scientific interests but have not historically been considered a sub-discipline of geobiology, e.g. paleontology.|$|E
25|$|Continuing {{with the}} {{knowledge}} obtained by the HERMES project (EC FP6), which contributed significantly {{to our understanding of}} deep-sea ecosystems, the HERMIONE project investigates ecosystems at critical sites on Europe's deep-ocean margin, aiming to make major advances in knowledge of their distribution and functioning, and their contribution to ecosystem goods and services. HERMIONE places special emphasis on human impact on the deep sea and on the translation of scientific information into science policy for the sustainable use of marine resources. To design and implement effective governance strategies and management plans to protect our deep seas for the future, understanding the extent, natural dynamics and interconnection of ocean ecosystems, and integrating socio-economic research with natural science, are important. To achieve this, HERMIONE uses a highly interdisciplinary and integrated approach, engaging experts in biology, ecology, biodiversity, oceanography, geology, sedimentology, geophysics and <b>biogeochemistry,</b> who will work alongside socio-economists and policy-makers.|$|E
500|$|Research on subfossil lemur diets, {{particularly}} in southern and southwestern Madagascar, {{has indicated that}} ecological communities have been significantly affected by their recent extinction. [...] Many extinct subfossil lemurs were large-bodied leaf-eaters (folivores), seed predators, or both. Today, leaf-eating along with seed predation is only seen in mid-sized lemurs, and is far less common {{than it was in}} the past. [...] Strict folivory is also less common, now found primarily in small lemurs. [...] In certain cases, subfossil lemurs, such as the sloth lemurs and koala lemurs, may have used leaves as an important fallback food, whereas other species, such as the monkey lemurs and the giant aye-aye, specialized on structurally defended resources, such as hard seeds and wood-boring insect larvae. [...] Last, Pachylemur was primarily a fruit eater (frugivorous). Subfossil lemur diets have been reconstructed using analytical tools, including techniques to compare tooth anatomy, structure, and wear; <b>biogeochemistry</b> (analysis of isotope levels, like carbon-13); and the dissection of fecal pellets associated with subfossil remains.|$|E
500|$|Giant subfossil lemurs {{are thought}} to have also played a {{significant}} role in seed dispersal, possibly targeting species that did not attract the seed dispersal services of the extinct elephant birds. [...] <b>Biogeochemistry</b> studies have shown that they may have been the primary seed dispersers for the endemic and native C3 trees in the spiny forests. [...] Terrestrial species may even have dispersed seeds for small bushes in addition to tall trees. [...] Seed dispersal can involve passing seeds through the gut (endozoochory) or attaching the seeds to the animal's body (epizoochory), and both processes probably occurred with subfossil lemurs. [...] Seeds from Uncarina species embed themselves in lemur fur, and likely did the same with subfossil lemurs. [...] Seed dispersal biology is known for very few species in the spiny forest, including genera of plants suspected of depending on giant lemurs, such as Adansonia, Cedrelopsis, Commiphora, Delonix, Diospyros, Grewia, Pachypodium, Salvadora, Strychnos, and Tamarindus. [...] For example, Delonix has edible pods that are rich in protein, and Adansonia fruits have a nutritious pulp and large seeds that may have been dispersed by Archaeolemur majori or Pachylemur insignis.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>biogeochemistry</b> {{of arsenic}} {{is complex and}} {{includes}} various adsorption and desorption processes. The toxicity of arsenic is connected to its solubility and is affected by pH. Arsenite (...) is more soluble than arsenate (...) and is more toxic; however, at a lower pH, arsenate becomes more mobile and toxic. It was found that addition of sulfur, phosphorus, and iron oxides to high-arsenite soils greatly reduces arsenic phytotoxicity.|$|E
2500|$|The {{study of}} {{hydrogen}} isotope <b>biogeochemistry</b> {{relies on the}} fact that various physicochemical processes will preferentially enrich or deplete deuterium relative to protium (see kinetic isotope effect, etc.). [...] There are various measures that have been developed to described the fractionation in an isotope between two pools, often the product and reactant of a physiochemical process. [...] α notation describes the difference between two hydrogen pools A and B with the following equation: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{study of}} stable isotope <b>biogeochemistry</b> {{involves}} {{the description of}} the relative abundances of various isotopes in a certain chemical pool, as well as the way in which physicochemical processes change the fraction of those isotopes in one pool vs. another. [...] Various type of notation have been developed to describe the abundance and change in the abundance of isotopes in these processes, and these are summarized below. [...] In most cases only the relative amounts of an isotope are of interest, the absolute concentration of any one isotope is of little importance.|$|E
2500|$|Dr. Carlos Del Castillo (PhD) was the Program Scientist for the Ocean Biology and <b>Biogeochemistry</b> Program at NASA Headquarters, in Washington, D.C.. Del Castillo is the {{recipient}} of the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE) award, the highest honor bestowed by the United States government on scientists and engineers beginning their independent careers.

2500|$|George Evelyn Hutchinson [...] (January 30, 1903 – May 17, 1991), was a British {{ecologist}} sometimes described [...] as the [...] "father {{of modern}} ecology." [...] He contributed {{for more than}} sixty years to the fields of limnology, systems ecology, radiation ecology, entomology, genetics, <b>biogeochemistry,</b> a mathematical theory of population growth, art history, philosophy, religion, and anthropology. He worked on the passage of phosphorus through lakes, the chemistry and biology of lakes, the theory of interspecific competition, and on insect taxonomy and genetics, zoo-geography and African water bugs. [...] He is {{known as one of}} the first to combine ecology with mathematics. He became an international expert on lakes and wrote the four-volume Treatise on Limnology in 1957.|$|E
2500|$|CRREL staff {{continued}} to make a mark in polar research, both in the Arctic and Antarctic. In the Arctic, CRREL researchers were active in modeling shipping in the Northern Sea Route and the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean (SHEBA) experiment, conducted in the Arctic Ocean from October 1997 to October 1998 to provide polar input to global climate models. Other researchers performed traverses of Antarctica and Greenland to collect data, pertinent to global climate change. In 2010, a CRREL researcher was co-chief scientist on another icebreaker-based scientific mission, called [...] "Impacts of Climate Change on Ecosystems and Chemistry of the Arctic Pacific Environment" [...] or ICESCAPE, to determine [...] "the impact of climate change on the <b>biogeochemistry</b> and ecology of the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas." ...|$|E
2500|$|In <b>biogeochemistry,</b> {{scientists}} {{focused primarily}} on the stable isotope of deuterium as a tracer for environmental processes, especially the water cycle. The American geochemist Harmon Craig, once a graduate student of Urey's, discovered the relationship between rainwater's hydrogen and oxygen isotope ratios. The linear correlation between the two heavy isotopes is conserved worldwide and {{referred to as the}} Global Meteoric Water Line. By the late 1960s, the focus of hydrogen isotopes shifted away from water and towards organic molecules. Plants use water to form biomass, but a 1967 study by Zebrowski, Ponticorvo, and Rittenberg found that the organic material in plants had less deuterium than the water source. Zebrowski's research measured the deuterium concentration of fatty acids and amino acids derived from sediments in the Mohole drilling project. Further studies by Bruce Smith and Samuel Epstein in 1970 confirmed the depletion of deuterium in organics compared to environmental water. Another duo in 1970, Schiegl and Vogel, analyzed the composition of hydrogen isotopes as water became biomass, as biomass became coal and oil, and as oil became natural gas. In each step they found deuterium further depleted. A landmark paper in 1980 by Marilyn Epstep, now M. Fogel, and Thomas Hoering titled [...] "Biogeochemistry of the stable hydrogen isotopes" [...] refined the links between organic materials and sources.|$|E
