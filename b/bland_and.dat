5|$|The work is unfinished; {{a number}} of details, most noticeably the pope's right hand, are missing. Other {{passages}} are <b>bland</b> <b>and</b> uniform, with some key areas still blocked by the underdrawing. Many of Titian's characteristic finishing touches are missing; Paul's fur-lined sleeves do not contain the polishing white strokes of the 1543 portrait, or his usual final overglaze or glossing.|$|E

Elizabeth was the {{daughter}} of Richard <b>Bland</b> <b>and</b> Elizabeth Randolph Bland of Jordan's Point, and the sister of statesman Richard Bland.

5|$|At {{the time}} McKinley was nominated, {{it was not}} clear who his Democratic rival would be. Cleveland's opponents within his party had mobilized into an {{organized}} effort to take over the Democratic Party and pass a platform supporting free silver. The platform was deemed of highest priority, and only once that fight was won was a candidate for president to be considered. Despite this resolution, several Democrats sought the nomination, with the foremost being former Missouri representative Richard P. <b>Bland</b> <b>and</b> former Iowa governor Horace Boies. Others either seeking or spoken of for the nomination included South Carolina Senator Benjamin Tillman, Senator Joseph C. Blackburn of Kentucky, and former Nebraska representative William Jennings Bryan.|$|E

5|$|Saturn's {{interior}} is probably {{composed of a}} core of iron–nickel and rock (silicon and oxygen compounds). This core {{is surrounded by a}} deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and finally a gaseous outer layer. Saturn has a pale yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere. Electrical current within the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to Saturn's planetary magnetic field, which is weaker than Earth's, but has a magnetic moment 580 times that of Earth due to Saturn's larger size. Saturn's magnetic field strength is around one-twentieth of Jupiter's. The outer atmosphere is generally <b>bland</b> <b>and</b> lacking in contrast, although long-lived features can appear. Wind speeds on Saturn can reach , higher than on Jupiter, but not as high as those on Neptune.|$|E
5|$|The article follows Gibson's {{observations}} of the architecture, phenomenology and culture of Singapore, and the clean, <b>bland</b> <b>and</b> conformist impression the city-state conveys during his stay. Its title and central metaphor—Singapore as Disneyland with the death penalty—is {{a reference to the}} authoritarian artifice the author perceives the city-state to be. Singapore, Gibson details, is lacking any sense of creativity or authenticity, absent of any indication of its history or underground culture. He finds the government to be pervasive, corporatist and technocratic, and the judicial system rigid and draconian. Singaporeans are characterized as consumerists of insipid taste. The article is accentuated by local news reports of criminal trials by which the author illustrates his observations, and bracketed by contrasting descriptions of the Southeast Asian airports he arrives and leaves by.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} when Leonardo {{commenced}} painting, it was unusual for figures to be painted with extreme contrast of light and shade.

50|$|In The Honourable Schoolboy, it is {{revealed}} that Esterhase, unlike Alleline <b>and</b> <b>Bland,</b> {{has managed to}} retain {{a position in the}} Circus, albeit one much more humble than his former one. Partially this may be explained by his (cosmetic) switch of loyalty to Smiley's side just before the mole's exposure, and partially by the fact that his expertise is more technical than Alleline's or <b>Bland's,</b> <b>and</b> thus has not been rendered completely useless by Haydon's treachery.|$|R

25|$|Meanwhile, Lucas {{attempted}} to branch out into non-minstrel material. In 1875, for instance, he performed alongside Emma and Anna Hyer in Out of Bondage, a musical {{drama about a}} freed slave who is made over to fit into upper-class, white society. He followed this by another stint in black minstrelsy, and in 1876, he was playing with Sprague's Georgia Minstrels, alongside both James A. <b>Bland</b> <b>and</b> Billy Kersands.|$|E

It has a slightly <b>bland</b> <b>and</b> starchy flavor. It is sometimes called the Polynesian potato.|$|E
25|$|Stephenson's first novel, The Big U, {{published}} in 1984, was a satirical take on life at American Megaversity, a vast, <b>bland</b> <b>and</b> alienating research university beset by chaotic riots. His next novel, Zodiac (1988), was a thriller following {{the exploits of}} a radical environmentalist protagonist in his struggle against corporate polluters. Neither novel attracted much critical attention on first publication, but showcased concerns that Stephenson would further develop in his later work.|$|E

He is still alive as of 2015.|$|E
25|$|Clavering Mill was a Post mill. It {{was marked}} {{on a map}} dated c.1625 {{and then in the}} {{ownership}} of Sir Francis Barrington. In 1702 it was conveyed to Sir Charles Barrington.

White’s Directory of 1848 records three millers in Clavering, the last date at which the post mill can be assumed to have been standing.|$|E
25|$|Development was resumed in {{all areas}} of the country, {{including}} the hitherto neglected and largely undeveloped semi-arid or arid north. Many sectors of the economy recovered from total collapse pre-2003. Numerous state corporations that had collapsed during the Moi years were revived and have begun performing profitably. The telecommunications sector boomed. Rebuilding, modernisation and expansion of infrastructure began in earnest, with several ambitious infrastructural and other projects, such as the Thika Superhighway, which would have been seen as unattainable pipe dreams during the <b>bland</b> <b>and</b> largely stagnant Moi years, completed. The country's cities and towns also began being positively renewed and transformed.|$|E
