500|$|Once the frivolities had ended, minds {{turned to}} post-war policy, and {{particularly}} how soldiers returning from Europe would be reintegrated into society. The Company had already, in 1916, set aside [...] of farmland {{to be given}} free of charge to white war veterans. In early 1919 it set up a government department to help returning men find work. Many former soldiers failed to find jobs, and some remained unemployed for years after they returned home. Some of the more seriously wounded from the European theatre never came <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> instead remaining in England because of the better medical facilities and public benefits. Demobilised Western Front veterans began to arrive back in Rhodesia in January 1919, and continued {{to do so for}} nearly a year afterwards. On 30 May 1919, the Southern Rhodesian Legislative Council passed a resolution thanking the territory's veterans.|$|E
500|$|Tal's {{return for}} the seventh season was {{announced}} at the 2011 Comic-Con. On the choice to bring Jo back for [...] "Defending Your Life", writer and co-executive producer Adam Glass explained, [...] "Knowing the history there, knowing the emotion that Dean would feel for her, we knew it'd be great. Jo's a favorite, too, {{so we wanted to}} see her back on the show." [...] Tal was happy to return to the show, saying, [...] "I didn't care that it took me over a season to come back. Just to be <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> was a blessing." [...] Feeling that she herself had grown as a person since her appearance in the fifth season, Tal tried to mirror that in her performance. She noted, however, [...] "Obviously, [...] died.

500|$|Some reviewers {{said the}} stereo sound helped gamers to locate events that {{occurred}} outside the current viewport. K. Bailey of 1UP liked units' speech effects, especially in response to repeated clicks, while Scott Love and the J-Man found this monotonous. Game Revolution’s review of the Mac version complained that Warcraft: Orcs & Humans’s graphics, which were ported from the DOS version's VGA, did not exploit the Macintosh's superior resolution. However, Game Revolution and Mac Gamer agreed that visual shortcomings did not reduce Mac gamers' enjoyment of the engrossing gameplay. Both also complained that the Macintosh was released {{about a year later}} than the DOS version. In contrast, a reviewer for Next Generation, while not overlooking the fact that Warcraft II was already out by the time the Macintosh version was released, made no criticism on this point, and asserted that [...] "Amazingly easy to pick up and play, Warcraft still manages to offer enough challenge to keep gaming veterans happy for hour after hour. Completed by sharp graphics, and good voice acting, the only thing holding this game <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> is its somewhat limited play options ..." ...|$|E

500|$|Skyrim {{is powered}} by Bethesda's Creation Engine, created {{specifically}} for Skyrim. After Fallout 3s release, the team devised numerous design objectives to meet for Skyrim, and according to Howard, the team [...] "got all those done and kept going". Had the team {{not been able to}} meet their design goals with current hardware, they would have waited for the next generation and released Skyrim then, but Howard felt that the technology of the time did not hold the team <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> The Creation Engine allows for numerous improvements in graphical fidelity over Bethesda's previous efforts. For example, the draw distance renders farther than in previous Elder Scrolls games; Howard provided an example where the player can stare at a small object such as a fork in detail, and then look up at a mountain and run to the top of it. Dynamic lighting allows shadows to be created by any structure or item in the game world, and the Creation Engine allowed for greater detail in flora production than SpeedTree had in previous Bethesda games. For example, with Bethesda's own technology, developers were able to give weight to the branches of trees, which affects how trees blow in the wind. In addition, the technology allows wind to affect the flow of water in channels such as rivers and streams. Because of the large presence of snow in Skyrims game world, the technological upgrades were applied to weather effects and allow for dynamic snow fall upon the terrain, instead of snow that was rendered as a textural effect in previous games.|$|E

The pilot, having eased the control column forward to build up speed after take-off, found that he was unable to move it <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> the elevator controls being virtually jammed somewhere in the system. It is impossible, from the evidence available and examination of the wreckage, to offer any concrete reason as to why the elevator system should have become jammed." ...|$|E

And it's just about that striving to get there. t was kind of like looking <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> of the things I've been through, just kind of putting that into the song." [...] The song was released with two B-sides: [...] "Let It Rain" [...] in Europe and Japan, and [...] "Fly Here Now", only in Japan.|$|E
50|$|Mark & John St. John are {{identical}} twins who serve in Bravo Company, with John being the hard-working, smart and capable NCO and Mark being the fighter. While the two maintain a low-level sibling argument throughout the March over every possible topic - from pranks in bygone days to who their mother loves more - they cover each other's <b>backs</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> times.

The weather had been hot (high of 94°F) and water was scarce, causing many men to nearly faint from their exertions. During the night the Confederates slept within 600 yards of the Union works, and Van Dorn readjusted his lines for the attack the next day. He abandoned his sophisticated plans for double envelopments. Shelby Foote wrote, [...] "His blood was up; it was Rosecrans he was after, and he was after him in the harshest, most straightforward way imaginable. Today he would depend not on deception to complete the destruction begun the day before, but on the rapid point-blank fire of his guns and the naked valor of his infantry." ...|$|E

The typical scale had a vertical pair of holes at each side near the top, plus one or two holes at the top.|$|R
