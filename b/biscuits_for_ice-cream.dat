40|$|Presented diploma thesis {{was focused}} on study of {{influence}} of stabilizers and other components on final quality of mixtures <b>for</b> <b>ice-cream</b> production. This thesis was worked out in cooperation with Frujo Co., Ltd., Tvrdonice {{to find out the}} most suitable stabilizer with positive influence on the quality of final product. In experimental part six mixtures of stabilizers, three mixtures <b>for</b> <b>ice-cream</b> production and particular ingredients for production of mixtures <b>for</b> <b>ice-cream</b> production were analysed. Saccharides and lipids were analysed only in mixtures of stabilizers. Content of saccharides was analyzed using spectrophotometry and HPLC/RI. Lipid components were analysed by TLC. Viscosity was measured by rotatory viscosimeter and the differences of flow curves of each mixture with different stabilizers were monitored. Based on viscosity measurements some ice-creams with different stabilizers were chosen for sensory analysis. Mixture of stabilizers “Stobicol” was analysed for active compounds and antioxidant stability. Microbiological stability was tested in all of the stabilizers and also in particular ingredients including final mixture <b>for</b> <b>ice-cream</b> production. In three ice-cream mixtures of different flavour protein composition was measured by microfluidic electrophoresis. The highest content of total and reducing saccharides was determined in hydrolyzed samples. The highest values of total saccharides were found in mixture of stabilizers “Meyprogen”, the highest values of reducing saccharides were detected in stabilizer “Swissgum”. Content of triglycerides was found out almost in all of the measured mixtures of stabilizers using TLC method even though according to formulas provided by producers there should not be any. Diglycerides were detected in “Meyprogen” too even though this mixture of stabilizers should contain only saccharides. Based on results of rheology measurements and in connection with sensory analysis “Meyprogen” stabilizer could be recommended as the best material for the industrial production...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{exploration}} of the mechanisms underlying the tendency toward overeating by investigating the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire (DEBQ) /Revised Eating Disorders Inventory (EDI-R) disinhibition, in sequence to the milkshake-ice cream study (van Strien, Cleven, and Schippers, in press). METHOD: In hierarchical multiple regression analyses, the relative predictive power <b>for</b> <b>ice-cream</b> consumption was assessed, that is, emotional versus external versus bulimic eating using scales of the DEBQ and the EDI-R. In nonplanned stepwise multiple regression analyses, the association was assessed between these three types of eating behaviors and non-eating-related EDI-R scales. RESULTS: Emotional eating {{was the most important}} variable <b>for</b> <b>ice-cream</b> consumption. External eating was borderline significant and bulimic eating nonsignificant when emotional and external eating had been partialled out. Emotional eating was best predicted by the EDI-R scales Asceticism, Interoceptive Awareness, and Social Insecurity. DISCUSSION: Results are consistent with psychosomatic theory, which focuses on emotional eating as the result of confusion and apprehension in recognizing and accurately responding to emotional and visceral states related to hunger and satiety...|$|R
