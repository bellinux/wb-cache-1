We destroyed twenty-five perfectly good fighters. They would <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> in museums now.|$|E
500|$|Every {{episode of}} Inside No. 9 {{features}} an ornamental hare somewhere on-screen. According to Pemberton, [...] "Because each episode is so wildly different {{there was nothing}} really linking them {{other than the fact}} they were all inside a Number Nine, I just thought it would <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> an object that you could hide and just have there on every set." [...] There is, however, no particular significance to the hare itself. The hare is visible in [...] "The Riddle of the Sphinx" [...] on a table in Squires's fireplace. However, there is also a [...] "second" [...] hare. While it is not visible in the partially completed crossword shown {{at the end of the}} episode, the crossword published in The Guardian contains a nina spelling ONELEPUS, Lepus being the generic name for hares.|$|E
500|$|Bob Mould of Hüsker Dü, one of Grohl's idols, {{was brought}} in to do vocals in a song Grohl {{conceived}} as a duet with him, [...] "Dear Rosemary". Mould also played guitar on the track, even though Vig's plans had him just singing. Grohl's and Smear's former Nirvana bandmate Krist Novoselic appeared in [...] "I Should Have Known" [...] as Grohl thought [...] "it would <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> him come down and share the experience" [...] and that the song would be enhanced by his bass and accordion-playing." [...] "Miss the Misery" [...] features Fee Waybill of The Tubes, a personal friend of Grohl who said that the frontman invited him because [...] "the background vocal sounded like him". Other guest musicians included three members of the expanded touring band, keyboardist Rami Jaffee, violinist Jessy Greene and percussionist Drew Hester.|$|E

5000|$|I {{think what}} we did on ... How the West was Won - that 1972 gig - is pretty much a {{testament}} of how good it was. It would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> had a little more visual recordings, but there you go. That’s the conundrum of Led Zeppelin! ...|$|R
50|$|It <b>is</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a real humorist {{recruited}} to {{the ranks of}} gifted painters. She is to be congratulated on livening up our dreary lives.|$|R
2500|$|The protests also {{received}} international coverage – Jon Stewart referenced the audio recordings and the protests in The Daily Show, noting that [...] "It must <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a democracy {{so young and}} idealistic you can still be disappointed in it." ...|$|E

5000|$|Montiel {{said that}} he made the film because “I wanted to walk down those streets again and {{fall in love with}} Laurie again, it would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> had that moment {{at the end of the}} film where Dito met Laurie, reconnecting as adults." [...] The real-life Laurie was white instead of Hispanic and died two years earlier from AIDS.|$|R
5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Scott Yanow awarded the album 3 stars stating [...] "Pearson {{performs}} {{music in a}} style that would have fit in quite well on Blue Note... This is not an essential date, but it <b>is</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> this rarity back in print again.|$|R

6000|$|For {{some time}} past Mary's grave blue eyes had been fixed upon him. [...] "What {{have you been}} writing lately?" [...] she asked. It would <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a little {{literary}} conversation.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wish there}} really were fairies," [...] said Jane. [...] "Wouldn't it <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> three wishes granted you [...] . or even only one? What would you wish for, girls, {{if you could}} have a wish granted? I'd wish to be rich and {{beautiful}} and clever." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, that's {{a weight}} off my mind," [...] said Paul. [...] "I'm {{perfectly}} happy now, teacher, thanks to you. It wouldn't <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> something wrong in your upper story, would it, teacher? I suppose the reason Mary Joe imagines I have is because I {{tell her what}} I think about things sometimes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do n't mind," [...] bleated a young lamb named Frisky, as it {{kicked up}} its heels and gambolled about upon the grass; [...] "it <b>'s</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> all that heavy wool cut off my back, for I sha' n't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> carry it around {{wherever}} I go." ...|$|R
60|$|She did not reply. She did {{not know}} what to say. She knew nothing of love. She had never given it a thought; but she did know that it <b>was</b> very <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> loved, {{whatever}} it meant. It <b>was</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> people kind <b>to</b> one. She <b>had</b> known so little of kindness or affection.|$|R
5000|$|Alter Echo {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from video game critics. Jeff Gerstmann, writing for GameSpot, commented: [...] "It would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> seen some more variety in the environments, and the instances of backtracking through areas you've already visited are disappointing. But the game's exciting, free-form combat {{makes up for}} those deficiencies." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now this is lovely! I do {{wish the}} boys were here. Won't it <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> them with us all their vacation? Why, it begins to-day, doesn't it? Oh, I wish I'd remembered it sooner, and perhaps they would have come with us," [...] she said, as they lay luxuriously eating {{sandwiches}} under the old apple-tree.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thought of}} {{something}} last night that we could do, Anne. You know that three-cornered piece of ground where the roads from Carmody and Newbridge and White Sands meet? It's all grown over with young spruce; but wouldn't it <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> them all cleared out, and just leave {{the two or three}} birch trees that are on it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The other matrons echoed Juanita. Carol {{was dismayed}} by the casualness of their cruelty, but she persisted. Miles had exclaimed to her, [...] "Jack Elder says maybe he'll come to the wedding! Gee, it would <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> Bea meet the Boss as a reg'lar married lady. Some day I'll be so well off that Bea can play with Mrs. Elder--and you! Watch us!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Hick was {{appointed}} Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2009 Birthday Honours. He said, [...] "I am very honoured with the award.

5000|$|A {{road test}} by Motor Trend {{reported}} the 2009 truck [...] "crawled up rock steps, ran through sand washes, and navigated steep ledges with confidence and capability to spare."

6000|$|Mrs. Ferrand dropped half a mock curtsey. [...] "A polite partner {{would have}} said 'bar one,' Harry," [...] she murmured petulantly. [...] "How awfully {{in love with her}} you are, my dear boy. It must <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a man so {{perfectly}} devoted to one.... And I don't believe either she half appreciates you. Some women would give their very eyes, do you know, to be as much loved by any man as she's loved by you, Harry." [...] And she looked at him significantly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Where's the niceness then? If {{a man has}} {{his time}} at his command and has studied the art of {{legislation}} it may be nice, because he will be doing his duty;--or {{if he wants to}} get into the government ruck like your brother-in-law, it may be nice;--or if he be an idle man with a large fortune it may <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> some place to go to. But why it should be nice for Ferdinand Lopez I cannot understand. Everett has some idea in his head when he talks about Parliament,--though I cannot say that I agree with him." [...] It may easily be understood that after this Emily would say nothing further in Manchester Square as to her husband's prospects at Silverbridge.|$|E
60|$|Elizabeth {{returned}} to her room to dress. She was conscious of a feeling that nothing was quite perfect in this world. It would <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{a great deal of}} money, for she had a scheme in her mind which called for a large capital; but she was sorry that it could come to her only through the death of her uncle, of whom, despite his somewhat forbidding personality, she had always been fond. She was also sorry that a large sum of money was coming to Nutty at that particular point in his career, just when there seemed the hope that the simple life might pull him together. She knew Nutty too well {{not to be able to}} forecast his probable behaviour under the influence of a sudden restoration of wealth.|$|E
2500|$|When he was 14 {{years old}} he formed the Alphatones when the Northern Jubilee Gospel Singers {{decided to try}} their luck in {{downtown}} Chicago and Mayfield stayed behind.

60|$|Sally was disappointed, but it {{was such}} a {{beautiful}} morning, and New York was so wonderful after the dull voyage in the liner that {{she was not going to}} allow herself to be depressed without good reason. After all, she could go on to Detroit tomorrow. It <b>was</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> something <b>to</b> which she could look forward.|$|R

6000|$|... "No," [...] said Miriam, [...] "because it is a secret; but it {{is nearly}} finished, and as I shall {{have to tell you}} about it very soon, I may as well do it now: I have been {{altering}} Judith Pacewalk's teaberry gown for Cicely. It was altered once for me, and that makes it all the harder to make it fit her now. I am not very good at that sort of thing, and so it has taken me a long time. I expected to have it ready for her when she came back from the wedding trip, but I could not do it. I shall finish it to-day, however, and to-morrow I am going to invest her with it. She is now the head of the house, and it is she who should wear the teaberry gown. Don't tell her, please, until to-morrow; I thought it would <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a little ceremony about it, and in that case I shall have to have some one to help me." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Blythe did not {{smile at}} Rilla's italics. Perhaps {{she did not}} feel like smiling or perhaps she {{detected}} a real grain of serious purpose behind Rilla's romantic pose. So here was Rilla hemming sheets and organizing a Junior Red Cross in her thoughts as she hemmed; moreover, she was enjoying it--the organizing that is, not the hemming. It was interesting and Rilla discovered a certain aptitude in herself for it that surprised her. Who would be president? Not she. The older girls would not like that. Irene Howard? No, somehow Irene was not quite as popular as she deserved to be. Marjorie Drew? No, Marjorie hadn't enough backbone. She was too prone {{to agree with the}} last speaker. Betty Mead--calm, capable, tactful Betty--the very one! And Una Meredith for treasurer; and, if they were very insistent, they might make her, Rilla, secretary. As for the various committees, they must be chosen after the Juniors were organized, but Rilla knew just who should be put on which. They would meet around--and there must be no eats--Rilla knew she would have a pitched battle with Olive Kirk over that--and everything should be strictly business-like and constitutional. Her minute book should be covered in white with a Red Cross on the cover--and wouldn't it <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> some kind of uniform which they could all wear at the concerts they would have to get up to raise money--something simple but smart? ...|$|E
6000|$|While {{they were}} thus conversing, the Frogman joined them {{and looked down}} at the plain with his big eyes and seemed unusually thoughtful. In fact, the Frogman was {{thinking}} that he'd like to see more of the world. Here in the Yip Country he had become the most important creature of them all, and his importance was getting to be a little tame. It would <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> other people defer to him and ask his advice, and there seemed no reason so far as he could see why his fame should not spread throughout all Oz. He knew nothing of the rest of the world, but it was reasonable to believe that there were more people beyond the mountain where he now lived than there were Yips, and if he went among them he could surprise them with his display of wisdom and make them bow down to him as the Yips did. In other words, the Frogman was ambitious to become still greater than he was, which was impossible if he always remained upon this mountain. He wanted others to see his gorgeous clothes and listen to his solemn sayings, and here was an excuse for him to get away from the Yip Country. So he said to Cayke the Cookie Cook, [...] "I will go with you, my good woman," [...] which greatly pleased Cayke because she felt the Frogman could be of much assistance to her in her search.|$|E
30|$|Settings of insufflation, light fountain, laser, or electro surgery {{are chosen}} before surgery or during surgery by the theater nurse or the surgeon. That the surgeon, while being sterile, can change {{settings}} himself, or {{can make a}} phone call, <b>is</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have.</b> It might decrease the nursing need, but finally it will not affect much the quality of surgery performed.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{always say}} a fellow ought <b>to</b> <b>have</b> Vision and Ideals. I guess {{some of the}} fellows in my {{business}} think I'm pretty visionary, but I just let 'em think {{what they want to}} and go right on--same as you do.... By golly, this <b>is</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a chance <b>to</b> sit and visit and kind of, you might say, brush up on our ideals." ...|$|R
5000|$|In a 2008 review, Lee's [...] "Peek n Poke" [...] said of Robot Tank: [...] "In a toss {{between the}} {{official}} Atari Battlezone and this — {{each one is}} just as good and its hard to choose — maybe the Atari effort wins? But it <b>is</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> two versions I can play and enjoy — a near perfect slant on Battle Zone".|$|R
