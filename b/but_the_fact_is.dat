25|$|It {{may seem}} a vast {{depletion}} of the downtown shopping area, it now having only one department store, the Hudson's Bay Company. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> that for many years, until {{the arrival of the}} Hudson's Bay Company there were only two department stores downtown, Simpson's and the discount department store on Broad Street — the wholesale wing of Simpson's and Sherwood Department Store being outside city centre. Reaching a balance between convenience for residents of Regina and the desire to make the city appealing and impressive is not a novelty.|$|E
500|$|The use of {{a safety}} car to start the race had a mixed {{response}} within the sport. Coulthard agreed with the FIA's decision: [...] "I know {{there will be a}} debate over it <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> I was asked beforehand and I said that, based on the previous years we've had here, the safest thing is to have a safety-car start". He added that although the safety-car start eliminated overtaking, it also prevented a major accident. Ralf Schumacher also agreed with the decision to start under safety-car conditions. However, ITV commentator and former driver Martin Brundle felt that the track was not wet enough for a safety car. Journalist Nigel Roebuck said that the length of time under safety-car conditions was inadequate, and raised the possibility of abandoning standing starts. FIA race director Charlie Whiting consulted Coulthard, the drivers' representative, before making his decision.|$|E
500|$|Jayma Mays commented {{of their}} relationship: [...] "Oh no! I don’t know if I can say! That’s a hard {{question}} {{because when you}} see the scenes of Emma and Will, you obviously think 'Oh of course they’re supposed to be together, of course, of course!' <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is,</b> is that he’s a married man and Emma knows that’s wrong, and she doesn’t want to be a homewrecker. She doesn’t want to ruin a relationship. So I guess in a perfect world, she could find someone like Will, or maybe Ken Tanaka (laughs) can become a little bit more like Will. But maybe it’s all about respect. Maybe if she can respect Ken enough, that will develop into true love." [...] She also commented of her co-star Matthew Morrison (Will): [...] "We were friends. We knew each other before we started this job. We worked together once before. So, that’s always helpful when you know the person that you’re working with, and you already feel comfortable around them. But yeah, he’s a really good friend, so that makes that stuff a little bit easier." ...|$|E

500|$|The two French sailors {{that reached}} Leander {{immediately}} began a systematic pillaging of the British officers' personal effects. Rather than tossing the men into the sea, as historian William James suggests {{they should have}} done, Thompson instead ordered one of the British boats to be repaired and launched to transport him to the French ship and bring back Captain Lejoille {{in the belief that}} he would end the looting. However, when the French captain arrived he immediately joined his officers, commandeering all but two of Captain Thompson's shirts and the wounded officer's cot. When Captain Berry complained that a pair of ornamental pistols had been stolen from him, Lejoille summoned the thief to the quarterdeck and took them for himself. The sailors who accompanied Lejoille were equally voracious: among the many things taken were the ship surgeon Mr Mulberry's operating tools, stolen {{in the middle of an}} operation. Without the correct equipment, the surgeon could not assist the many wounded, including Captain Thompson, who had a musket ball still embedded deeply in his arm. When Captain Berry complained, Lejoille replied [...] "J'en suis fâché, mais le fait est, que les Français sont bons au pillage" [...] ("I'm sorry, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is,</b> that the French are good at plunder").|$|E
500|$|Speer {{managed to}} reach a {{relatively}} safe area near Hamburg as the Nazi regime finally collapsed, but decided on a final, risky visit to Berlin to see Hitler one more time. Speer stated at Nuremberg, [...] "I {{felt that it was}} my duty not to run away like a coward, but to stand up to him again." [...] Speer visited the Führerbunker on April22. Hitler seemed calm and somewhat distracted, and the two had a long, disjointed conversation in which the dictator defended his actions and informed Speer of his intent to commit suicide and have his body burned. In the published edition of Inside the Third Reich, Speer relates that he confessed to Hitler that he had defied the Nero Decree, but then assured Hitler of his personal loyalty, bringing tears to the dictator's eyes. Speer biographer Gitta Sereny argued, [...] "Psychologically, it is possible {{that this is the way}} he remembered the occasion, because it was how he would have liked to behave, and the way he would have liked Hitler to react. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> that none of it happened; our witness to this is Speer himself." [...] Sereny notes that Speer's original draft of his memoirs lacks the confession and Hitler's tearful reaction, and contains an explicit denial that any confession or emotional exchange took place, as had been alleged in a French magazine article.|$|E
500|$|In July 1999, the Democratic polling firm Schroth and Associates {{conducted}} {{a poll of}} 400 Reform Party leaders and found Trump tied for third place for the Reform Party presidential nomination. [...] Both the Reform Party and Trump denied having commissioned the poll. Days later, Newsweek raised speculation when it cited an unnamed [...] "close friend" [...] of Trump who said Trump was [...] "toying" [...] {{with the idea of}} a presidential campaign, allegedly in response to rumors of Ventura's courting of Weicker for a run. [...] Trump purportedly held a grudge against Weicker for blocking his plans to build a casino in Bridgeport in 1994. [...] The two had an exchange of insults in which Weicker labeled Trump a [...] "dirt bag" [...] and Trump referred to Weicker as [...] "a fat slob who couldn't get elected dog catcher." [...] In response to the Newsweek report, Trump sent out a press release in which he criticized the two party system, praised the Reform Party, and stated [...] "If the Reform Party nominated me, I would probably run and probably win." [...] However, he added that if the party nominated him, he would ask for [...] "an immediate recount." [...] In an interview, he told The New York Times, [...] "I'm honored and I'm flattered , <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> I've never had more fun than I'm having right now, building the most spectacular buildings in New York." [...] Chairman Verney denied that the Reform Party had any interest in Trump, explaining that party members had [...] "never spent one second thinking about him." [...] A CNN-Time poll conducted later in July showed Trump with seven percent support nationally in a match up against Republican candidate George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore.|$|E

2500|$|Sting's drawing ability {{has been}} disputed. Journalist Dave Scherer of PWInsider wrote: [...] "Sting is an all timer for sure, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> {{that when he}} was the man in WCW, even before the NWO came in, he didn't draw huge". Pro wrestling {{historian}} Dave Meltzer also reported that Sting was not a formidable draw. Fin Martin of Power Slam felt that while Sting did not make [...] "essential improvements" [...] nor [...] "grow into the champion's role" [...] during his first NWA World Heavyweight Championship reign from 1990 to 1991, he suffered from a weak line-up of potential opponents and poor creative handling. Martin said that Sting never truly established himself as 'The Man'.|$|E

2500|$|In early 1983, Mitchell began a world tour, visiting Japan, Australia, Ireland, the United Kingdom, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy and Scandinavia {{and then}} {{going back to the}} United States.

As 1984 ended, Mitchell was writing new songs, when she received a suggestion from Geffen that perhaps an outside producer with experience in the modern technical arenas that they wanted to explore might be a worthy addition. British synthpop performer and producer Thomas Dolby was brought on board. Of Dolby's role, Mitchell later commented: [...] "I was reluctant when Thomas was suggested because he had been asked to produce the record , and would he consider coming in as just a programmer and a player? So on that level we did have some problems... He may {{be able to do it}} faster.

2500|$|After {{the battle}} Thompson was joined aboard the Leander by Captain Edward Berry, and sent with Nelson's despatches to Gibraltar. [...] Whilst sailing there, they were spotted on 18 August by the Généreux, which had escaped the Battle of the Nile. The French pursued the Leander. Being a 60 gun ship to the Généreux′s 78, and still having battle damage and men wounded from the Nile, Thompson {{attempted}} to escape, but was eventually forced {{to come to}} battle. The two eventually clashed in a long running engagement, which eventually resulted in Leander being disabled and unmanageable. [...] After conferring with Berry, Thompson agreed to surrender. The Généreux had suffered 100 killed and 188 wounded, to the Leander′s 35 killed and 57 wounded. [...] Arriving on board the French ship, Berry and Thompson were almost immediately stripped of their possessions. The French went on to plunder their prize, even {{going so far as}} to steal the surgeon's equipment as he tried to attend to the wounded. [...] When Thompson protested, and reminded the French captain of how French prisoners were treated under Nelson, he received the reply 'I am sorry for it; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is,</b> that the French are expert at plunder.' ...|$|E
