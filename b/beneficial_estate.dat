50|$|The House of Lords (with {{the leading}} {{judgment}} being given by Lord Wilberforce) unanimously {{held that the}} money was held by Rolls Razor on trust for the payment of the dividends; that purpose having failed, the money was held on trust for Quistclose. The fact that the transaction was a loan did not exclude the implication of a trust. The legal rights (to call for repayment) and equitable rights (to claim title) could co-exist. Barclays, having notice of the trust, could not retain the money as against Quistclose. Similarly, the liquidator of Rolls Razor could not claim title to the money, as the assets did not form part the <b>beneficial</b> <b>estate</b> of Rolls Razor. Lord Reid, Lord Morris of Borth-Y-Gest, Lord Guest and Lord Pearce all agreed with the judgment that Lord Wilberforce gave.|$|E
40|$|On 1 st January 1992, the Act on {{management}} of agricultural land {{owned by the}} State Treasury of 19 th October 1991 (hereinafter {{referred to as the}} Act) came into effect, which introduced new legal regulations concerning the principles of management of property owned by the State Treasury with reference to agricultural land and other kinds of real estate as well as property left after liquidation of state agricultural enterprises (Polish: państwowe przedsiębiorstwo gospodarki rolnej; hereinafter referred to as ppgr), real estates which {{on the day of the}} Act’s coming into effect were under management of state organisational units as well as real estate in perpetual usufruct by natural and legal persons; in usufruct or <b>beneficial</b> <b>estate</b> by natural persons, legal persons and other organisational units; in the State Land Fund. With this Act the process of changes in the structure of ownership of agricultural real estate began, real estate that had been taken over to the benefit of the State Treasury on grounds of the decree on agricultural reform of 6 th September 1944, as well as on grounds of other legal titles (e. g. in exchange for allowance or retirement pension, or taken over by the state by way of other titles on grounds of later legal acts). In order to accomplish the goal of introducing changes in the structure of ownership of agricultural real estate by virtue of the Act of 19 th October 1991, the Agricultural Property of the State Treasury Agency was established. The Agency was invested with attributes of a state–owned legal person, which the State Treasury in accordance with art. 5 of the Act entrusted with exercising ownership rights and other property rights to the benefit of the State Treasury in relation to the aforementioned property. As a consequence whereof, on the day of the Act’s coming into effect, i. e. on 1 st January 1992, the Agency entered into possession of elements of property of the State Treasury it was entrusted with (above all property left after liquidation of state agricultural enterprises), and exercises on its own behalf the rights and obligations related to them towards third parties, as well as on its own behalf exercises public law liabilities related to these elements, and liabilities resulting from administrative decisions. The Agency also inherited the liabilities of ppgr, what is to be considered an exception to the principle voiced in the Civil Code that state–owned legal persons are not responsible for the liabilities of the State Treasury. Thus the Act {{on management}} of agricultural land owned by the State Treasury, being a unique legal instrument, modifies the ruling of art. 40 § 1 of the Civil Code. The Agency is only a trust institution of the State Treasury, an institution which is the administrator of the right the State Treasury is entitled to. In no way is the Agency entitled to property rights in relation to property entrusted to it, whereas the State Treasury in no way ceases to hold ownership of the property entrusted to the Agency. However, one has to assume that the Agency is entitled, in relation to the property entrusted to it, to any and all rights listed in art. 140 of the Civil Code. The activity of the Agency as trustee constitutes, in a sense, a statutory specification of tasks of the administrative body that the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development is. However, describing the Agency as a unique state–owned legal person seems most appropriate, a state–owned legal person executing statutory and public administration tasks, including appointed to it public administration functions. Executing the tasks imposed on it by the legislators, the Agency not only makes use of civil law, but also of administrative law mechanisms.

50|$|Often the {{mechanism}} is employed {{to avoid a}} specific tax. For example, a wealthy testator could transfer his house into an offshore company; he can then settle the shares of the company on trust (with himself being a trustee with another trustee, whilst holding the <b>beneficial</b> life <b>estate)</b> for himself for life, and then to his daughter. On his death, the shares will automatically vest in the daughter, who thereby acquires the house, without the house {{having to go through}} probate and being assessed with inheritance tax. Most countries assess inheritance tax, and all other taxes, on real estate within their jurisdiction, regardless of the nationality of the owner, so this would not work with a house in most countries. It {{is more likely to be}} done with intangible assets.|$|R
40|$|While style {{analysis}} {{has been studied}} extensively in equity markets, applications of this valuable tool for measuring and benchmarking performance and risk in a real estate context are still relatively new. Most previous real estate studies on this topic have identified three investment categories (rather than styles) : sectors, administrative regions and economic regions. However, the low explanatory power reveals the need to extend this analysis to other investment styles. We identify four main real estate investment styles and apply a multivariate model to randomly generated portfolios to test the significance of each style in explaining portfolio returns. Results show that significant alpha performance is significantly reduced when we account for the new investment styles, with small vs. big properties being the dominant one. Secondly, {{we find that the}} probability of obtaining alpha performance is dependent upon the actual exposure of funds to style factors. Finally we obtain that both alpha and systematic risk levels are linked to the actual characteristics of portfolios. Our overall results suggest that it would be <b>beneficial</b> for real <b>estate</b> fund managers to use these style factors to set benchmarks and to analyze portfolio returns. investment styles, commercial real estate, portfolio analysis, performance measurement...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Title: The Mediator’s Qualities - How are the {{negotiating}} parties effected by the mediator's persistence and patience? Level: Final assignment for Bachelor Degree Author: Johanna Strandberg and Emma Hjalmarsson Supervisor: Jens Eklinder Frick and Jonas Molin Date: May 2015 Aim: Our {{aim is to}} create a greater understanding of {{the negotiating}} parties' experience of the mediator's persistence and patience. Method: We have chosen a deductive approach that we have based our empirical data on already existing research. Theoretical material has been gathered through literature, theses and scientific articles. With the background to our aim, we have chosen to use a qualitative approach where we have interviewed ten people who have been in contact with a real estate agent the last 24 months. The empirical data was then analysed and discussed in our analysis and conclusion. Result & Conclusions: We have found that the mediator's persistence and patience affect negotiating partners in various ways. Patient is seen as a positive quality while persistence can be perceived as negative. Our survey shows that when persistence and patience are combined, the result is successful. Our survey also showed that the main characteristics of the mediator were not at all persistence and patience, which earlier research has shown, but instead it was nice, impartial and knowledgeable. Suggestions for further research: What we think would be interesting for further research is to investigate the mediator's perspective because we only looked at the negotiating parties' perspective. We would encourage further research on qualities in general and also on the specific persistence and patience because we fount that it was a limited amount of research based on these qualities. Contribution of the thesis: The contribution {{of this study is that}} it has created a larger understanding for the characteristics that negotiation parties perceive as important for a real estate agent. This can be <b>beneficial</b> for real <b>estate</b> agents to know what properties the parties prefer and how they should act in their efforts to make the parties satisfied. Key words: Negotiation, mediation, characteristics, persistence, patience...|$|R
