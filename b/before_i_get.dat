5|$|Before the 1998 {{release of}} Tony Fletcher's Dear Boy: The Life of Keith Moon, Moon's {{date of birth}} was presumed to be 23 August 1947. This {{erroneous}} date appeared in several otherwise-reliable sources, including the Townshend-authorised biography <b>Before</b> <b>I</b> <b>Get</b> Old: The Story of The Who. The incorrect date had been supplied by Moon in interviews before it was corrected by Fletcher to 1946.|$|E
500|$|The London 2012 Summer Olympic Committee {{contacted}} Curbishley about Moon {{performing at}} the games, 34 {{years after his}} death. In an interview with The Times Curbishley quipped, [...] "I emailed back saying Keith now resides in Golders Green Crematorium, having {{lived up to the}} Who's anthemic line 'I hope I die <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> old'... If they have a round table, some glasses and candles, we might contact him." ...|$|E
500|$|Manning is a Christian. At age 13, he said, [...] "I {{committed}} {{my life to}} Christ, {{and that}} faith has been most important to me ever since." [...] Manning said his priorities ranked in order are [...] "...faith, family, friends, and football." [...] Manning said he prays every night and before games and added, [...] "I hope (and pray) I don't do too many things that displease Him <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> to Heaven myself. I believe, too, that life is much better and freer when you're committed to God in that way." ...|$|E

500|$|Acknowledging the album's lack of {{commercial}} success, Dixon {{said she would}} always prefer to [...] "take a chance creatively" [...] than release what she perceived to be stultifying records. She commented: [...] "I knew the single 'Drummer Boy' was a risk. It {{was a very difficult}} record and so far removed from anything I'd done <b>before.</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> that... I take full responsibility for that, but I'm glad I did it. I'd rather make a unique record like 'Drummer Boy' and have it fail than play it safe and release bland, generic music that doesn't excite me." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{production}} {{consists of}} various computer beats and electronic effects. The song contains an ascending bridge {{incorporated into the}} chorus, which consists of the lines: [...] "If you're ready for me boy / You'd better push the button {{and let me know}} / <b>Before</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> the wrong idea and go." [...] Lyrically, the song is about a woman's sexual frustration of being unnoticed by a man. [...] Joe Macare of Stylus Magazine described Buena's delivery of the lyric [...] "my sexy ass" [...] as [...] "carefree", and noted that the lyrics adapt an [...] "idiosyncratic approach" [...] to the English language. Musically, [...] "Push the Button" [...] received comparisons to the sound of pop group ABBA.|$|E
500|$|The next single, [...] "My Generation", {{followed}} in October. Townshend had written it as a slow blues, but after several abortive attempts, it {{was turned into}} a more powerful song with a bass solo from Entwistle. The song used gimmicks such as a vocal stutter to simulate the speech of a mod on amphetamines, and two key changes. Townshend insisted in interviews that the lyrics [...] "Hope I die <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> old" [...] were not meant to be taken literally. Peaking at No.2, [...] "My Generation" [...] is the group's highest-charting single in the UK. The début album My Generation was released in late 1965. Among original material by Townshend, including the title track and [...] "The Kids Are Alright", the album has several James Brown covers from the session earlier that year that Daltrey favoured.|$|E

2500|$|Henderson {{bounced back}} from his inauspicious start in the UFC with a victory over Rousimar Palhares at UFC 88, winning by {{unanimous}} decision. It was his first win in the UFC in over ten years. After the bout, Henderson laughed and said, [...] "Hopefully I don't have to wait that long <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> my next win." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dylan {{talked about}} his {{difficulty}} at the recording sessions {{in an interview with}} Guitar World magazine. [...] "I lose my inspiration in the studio real easy, and it's {{very difficult for me to}} think that I'm going to eclipse anything I've ever done <b>before.</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> bored easily, and my mission, which starts out wide, becomes very dim after a few failed takes and this and that." [...] In the same interview Dylan cited Buddy Holly as an influence during the recording sessions.|$|E
2500|$|Three songs— [...] "Fly", [...] "Someone's Watching over Me" [...] and [...] "Jericho"— {{were used}} in Raise Your Voice, a drama film {{released}} shortly after the album in which Duff starred as an aspiring singer who attends a prestigious performing arts summer school. Duff has described [...] "Fly" [...] as [...] "an uplifting song" [...] about [...] "how people are scared to open up and show who they are inside because they're afraid of what others are going to say". Her character performs [...] "Someone's Watching over Me" [...] at the film's climax and [...] "Jericho" [...] during the end credits, with the other characters performing the instruments. The album's release in Japan includes three bonus tracks: an acoustic version of [...] "Who's That Girl?", a cover of The Go-Go's' [...] "Our Lips Are Sealed" [...] recorded with Haylie for the soundtrack to Duff's film A Cinderella Story ("We really wanted to work together, and my label knew that, so we found this song and we're like, 'Yes! We have to do this!'", Duff said), and a cover of The Who's [...] "My Generation" [...] in which the lyric [...] "I hope I die <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> old" [...] was changed to [...] "I hope I don't die <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> old". Duff began performing it in concert after a suggestion from her manager, who was {{a fan of the}} song.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hang {{these new}} ideas," [...] he said. [...] "It's you they're after, Mr. Brooks. As a rule, they're off <b>before</b> <b>I</b> can <b>get</b> near my cigar-box." ...|$|R

6000|$|... “It {{ought to}} pay,” {{declared}} Jaques. “The coasting trade’s pretty good; in fact, I {{often have to}} wait some time <b>before</b> <b>I</b> can <b>get</b> my truck brought up.” ...|$|R
2500|$|The rest of Dammeier's {{argument}} {{was devoted to}} the issue of the other respondents' privacy expectations in communicating with Quon, after Sotomayor asked him if they could prevail even if Quon did not. Dammeier likened the department's actions to going to the post office to get letters sent to Quon instead of his house. Scalia pointed out that Quon could have obtained hard copies of the messages and circulated them himself. [...] "hen I get a piece of mail from somebody, I could do that as well", the lawyer replied, [...] "but that doesn't mean that the government gets to go to the post office and get my mail <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> it". Richland replied in his rebuttal argument that [...] "the truth is that all of these plaintiffs admitted that they knew that this was a department-issued pager, and this wasn't a post office".|$|E
2500|$|With the {{assistance}} of Lambert, the Who caught the ear of American record producer Shel Talmy, who had the band signed to a record contract. Townshend wrote a song, [...] "I Can't Explain", as a deliberate sound-alike of the Kinks, another group Talmy produced. Released as a single in January 1965, [...] "I Can't Explain" [...] was the Who's first hit, reaching number eight on the British charts. A follow-up single ("Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere"), credited to both Townshend and Daltrey, also reached the top 10 in the UK. However, it was {{the release of the}} Who's third single, [...] "My Generation", in November that, according to Who biographer Mark Wilkerson, [...] "cemented their reputation as a hard-nosed band who reflected the feelings of thousands of pissed-off adolescents at the time. The Townshend-penned single reached number two on the UK charts, becoming the Who's biggest hit. The song and its famous line [...] "I hope I die <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> old" [...] was [...] "very much about trying to find a place in society," [...] Townshend stated in an interview with David Fricke.|$|E
