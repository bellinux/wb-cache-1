This transposes one equally {{tempered}} scale to another. Shifting down three courses transposes the D-major scale to A-major, <b>but</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>the</b> first Do-Re-Mi would be shifted off the instrument.|$|E
25|$|The {{discovery}} and elucidation of aberration is now {{regarded as a}} classic case of the application of scientific method, in which observations are made to test a theory, but unexpected results are sometimes obtained that in turn lead to new discoveries. It is also worth noting that part of the original motivation of the search for stellar parallax was to test the Copernican theory that the Earth revolves around the Sun, <b>but</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>the</b> existence of aberration also establishes the truth of that theory.|$|E
25|$|Ibrahim ibn al-Aghlab (r.800-812) and his descendants, {{known as}} the Aghlabids (800-909), ruled in Ifriqiya from 800 to 909. The Aghlabids also ruled lands to the west (Constantine) and lands to the east (Tripolitania). The Aghlabids were {{predominantly}} of an Arab tribe the Bani Tamim. At that time there were perhaps 100,000 Arabs living in Ifriqiya, <b>but</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>the</b> Berbers constituted the great majority. The Aghlabid military forces were drawn from: (a) immigrant Arab warriors (both those recently sent against the Berber Kharajite revolts, and those descendants of earlier Arab invasions), (b) Islamized and bilingual natives (Afariq) {{most of whom were}} Berbers, and (c) black slave soldiers from the south. The black soldiery formed the ruler's last resort.|$|E

2500|$|This group {{looked to}} be {{getting away from the}} peloton at first, but {{suddenly}} [...] started working for Robbie McEwen as sprinters Bennati and Hushovd were in this group. They were working hard to keep the gap between the peloton and the group reasonable, <b>but</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>the</b> leaders tried to stay ahead too. This led to the gap fluctuating between 45" [...] and 1'15" [...] for a very long time. From this group which formed after about 30 kilometres, six riders dropped as they waited for the peloton after 70 kilometres, knowing that they would not let the group go. Meanwhile, Albasini, Bennati, Goubert, Guerini, Hincapie, Millar, Moncoutié, Verdugo and Voigt pushed on. Bennati then won the intermediate sprint and [...] stopped working, but now the teams from [...] and Team Milram were trying to close the gap as they did not have any riders up front. Finally they succeeded at kilometre 94. As soon as the breakaway group was caught, a new group formed which now consisted of only four riders: ...|$|E
2500|$|The phenomenalist {{phase of}} post-Humean {{empiricism}} ended by the 1940s, for {{by that time}} it had become obvious that statements about physical things could not be translated into statements about actual and possible sense data. [...] If a physical object statement is to be translatable into a sense-data statement, the former {{must be at least}} deducible from the latter. But it came to be realized that there is no finite set of statements about actual and possible sense-data from which we can deduce even a single physical-object statement. Remember that the translating or paraphrasing statement must be couched in terms of normal observers in normal conditions of observation. There is, however, no finite set of statements that are couched in purely sensory terms and can express the satisfaction of the condition of the presence of a normal observer. According to phenomenalism, to say that a normal observer is present is to make the hypothetical statement that were a doctor to inspect the observer, the observer would appear to the doctor to be normal. [...] <b>But,</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>the</b> doctor himself must be a normal observer. If we are to specify this doctor's normality in sensory terms, we must make reference to a second doctor who, when inspecting the sense organs of the first doctor, would himself have to have the sense data a normal observer has when inspecting the sense organs of a subject who is a normal observer. And if we are to specify in sensory terms that the second doctor is a normal observer, we must refer to a third doctor, and so on (also see the third man).|$|E
