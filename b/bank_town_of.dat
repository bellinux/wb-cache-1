2500|$|The Main South Line from Dunedin to Invercargill {{was built}} {{on the west side of}} the Mataura River north of Edendale, thereby leaving the small east <b>bank</b> <b>town</b> <b>of</b> Wyndham off the route. [...] To satisfy local residents, a 6.5 km long branch was built from Edendale to the town and it opened on 2 October 1882. [...] A further section had been let to a contractor, but with half of the works complete, they {{abandoned}} the project. [...] Further processes of plan review and granting of contracts meant that the branch did not reach the town of Glenham until 1 May 1890. [...] There were proposals to continue the branch into the lower Mataura River area, but in August 1888, the Public Works Department stated that no further expenditure on the line was proposed once it was complete to Glenham, and the Tokanui Branch (which at the time terminated in Mokotua) was extended into the lower Mataura instead. [...] As Glenham was now established as the terminus, a locomotive depot was established in the town. [...] Along the route from Wyndham to Glenham, a tunnel was required, and it became the second to southernmost railway tunnel in New Zealand and thereby one of the most southern railway tunnels in the world.|$|E
2500|$|Hussein later {{stated that}} {{during one of}} his {{meetings}} with Israeli representatives: [...] "I told them I could not absorb a serious retaliatory raid, and they accepted the logic of this and promised there would never be one." [...] The Palestinian nationalist organization Fatah under the PLO started organizing cross-border attacks against Israel in January 1965, often drawing Israeli reprisals on Jordan. One such reprisal was the Samu Incident, an attack launched by Israel on 13November 1966 on the Jordanian-controlled West <b>Bank</b> <b>town</b> <b>of</b> As-Samu after three Israeli soldiers were killed by a Fatah landmine. The assault inflicted heavy Arab casualties. Israeli writer Avi Shlaim argues that Israel's disproportionate retaliation exacted revenge on the wrong party, as Israeli leaders knew from their coordination with Hussein that he was doing everything he could to prevent such attacks. The incident drew fierce local criticism of Hussein amid feelings he had been betrayed by the Israelis; Hussein also suspected that Israel had changed its attitude towards Jordan and was intending to escalate matters in order to capture the West Bank. Yitzhak Rabin, the then Israel Defense Forces chief of staff, later admitted the disproportionate reaction by Israel, and that the operation would have been better directed at Syria, which was supporting such attacks: [...] "We had neither political nor military reasons to arrive at a confrontation with Jordan or to humiliate Hussein." ...|$|E
