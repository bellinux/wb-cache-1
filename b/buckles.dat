5|$|There were {{numerous}} types of belts produced for the Confederate Military during the Civil War. There were literally dozens {{of types of}} <b>buckles</b> used and produced by or for the Confederacy. The <b>buckles</b> ranged from single plates with hooks, to two piece interlocking <b>buckles,</b> to simple roller <b>buckles</b> and countless other variations. Many <b>buckles</b> use plates that bore the state seal or motto of their home states. The vast majority used simple roller buckle plates of the type found on a common dog collar. As the War progressed, more and more men used captured US belt plates, often wearing them upside down.|$|E

30|$|The {{differences}} among the results from different researchers mainly arise from two aspects. Firstly, previous <b>buckling</b> solutions are only approximate results with simplified assumptions. The accurate <b>buckling</b> solutions under sinusoidal <b>buckling</b> and helical <b>buckling</b> stages have not been obtained with the <b>buckling</b> differential equation and energy method. Secondly, a comprehensive description of {{the transition from the}} sinusoidal <b>buckling</b> to helical <b>buckling</b> has not been proposed due to the significant difference between these two <b>buckling</b> modes. The critical point between the sinusoidal <b>buckling</b> and helical <b>buckling</b> stages is usually assumed in theoretical analyses, but no distinct dividing point is found in experiments. Therefore, sophisticated description of the <b>buckling</b> state transition and accurate <b>buckling</b> solutions under these two <b>buckling</b> modes still needs an in-depth research.|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{work was}} {{conducted}} on oriented strand board webbed wood I-joists to investigate the <b>buckling</b> behavior.

The <b>buckling</b> modes and usually overestimated <b>buckling</b> loads of a joist were obtained from linear eigenvalue <b>buckling</b> analysis. The <b>buckling</b> modes were then introduced into a joist as initial geometric imperfections to conduct nonlinear <b>buckling</b> analysis, and more reliable <b>buckling</b> loads were obtained. Based on statistics of the analytical results, the local web <b>buckling</b> capacity at a support was empirically expressed by the postbuckling load.

5|$|According to Stodart, the fess checquy and <b>buckles,</b> {{prominent}} in 'MacAulay heraldry', {{are derived from}} {{the arms of the}} Stewarts. The basic Stewart coat of arms is blazoned: Or, a fess chequy azure and argent. The <b>buckles</b> used in 'Stewart heraldry' are ultimately derived from the canting arms of Alexander Boncle (d. by 1300), blazoned: gules, three <b>buckles</b> Or. Boncle's daughter (who in time became his heiress) married Sir John Stewart (d. 1298), younger son of Alexander Stewart, 4th High Steward of Scotland.

40|$|International audienceA new {{drill pipe}} <b>buckling</b> model {{provided}} excellent predictions for each full-scale <b>buckling</b> test performed, {{not only in}} terms of deformed <b>buckling</b> shape but also in terms of weight transfer. Existing models, on the other hand, failed to predict observed drill pipe <b>buckling</b> behavior. This is the first time in the drilling industry that a <b>buckling</b> model was successfully validated in the field, and this model can predict realistically the onset and severity of <b>buckling</b> for any 3 D trajectory. Many articles discuss <b>buckling</b> inside a wellbore but an increasing number of field observations suggest that existing <b>buckling</b> theories fail to predict <b>buckling</b> phenomenon such as lockup. Indeed, existing <b>buckling</b> theories generally assume that the wellbore is idealistically perfect without any doglegs. Recent advancements in drillstring mechanics modeling have demonstrated that doglegs, friction, and rotation affect greatly the <b>buckling</b> phenomenon.

In particular, explicit expressions are obtained for embedded double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWNTs). Numerical results show that, for both the DWNTs and embedded DWNTs, the <b>buckling</b> form shifts from the lower <b>buckling</b> mode to the higher <b>buckling</b> mode with increasing the <b>buckling</b> load, but the <b>buckling</b> mode is invariable for a certain domain of the <b>buckling</b> load.

30|$|Chen et al. (1990) first deduced the {{critical}} force to cause helical <b>buckling</b> {{with the energy}} method and stated that critical helical <b>buckling</b> load was \(\sqrt 2 \) times {{the critical}} sinusoidal <b>buckling</b> load. In Chen’s research, the axial force on the tubular string {{was assumed to be}} constant during the process from the starting of sinusoidal <b>buckling</b> to helical <b>buckling.</b> By assuming that the axial force increases linearly from the start of sinusoidal <b>buckling</b> to helical <b>buckling,</b> Wu (1992) refined Chen’s method and pointed out that Chen’s result was an average value of the critical sinusoidal and helical <b>buckling</b> loads. According to Wu, the critical helical <b>buckling</b> load is \(2 \sqrt 2 - 1 \) times the critical sinusoidal <b>buckling</b> load. Miska et al. (1996) assumed that the axial force increased linearly in the entire loading process and found that the critical helical <b>buckling</b> load was \(2 \sqrt 2 \) times the critical sinusoidal <b>buckling</b> load. Miska et al. (1996) also proved that the sinusoidal <b>buckling</b> configuration became unstable (\(\beta = 1.875 \)) before the tubular string changes to the helical <b>buckling</b> configuration. Therefore, the tubular string may be in a sinusoidal or helical <b>buckling</b> state when the axial force satisfies \(1.875 < \beta < 2 \sqrt 2 \). Cunha (1995) pointed out that there are two critical helical <b>buckling</b> loads, where the lower limit value is equal to Chen’s result and the upper limit is equal to Miska’s result. The upper limit means the minimum axial force causing helical <b>buckling</b> in the loading process, while the lower limit refers to the minimum axial force to keep the tubular string in the helical <b>buckling</b> stage for the unloading process. Mitchell (1997) obtained similar conclusions with the <b>buckling</b> differential equation. On the basis of previous studies, Gao et al. (2002) summarized the previous assumptions (Fig.  2) and considered that the axial force increases linearly in the sinusoidal <b>buckling</b> stage and then remains constant until the start of helical <b>buckling</b> based on experimental results.|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} the <b>buckling</b> behaviors of short multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) under axial compression by using molecular mechanics (MM) simulations. The {{effects of the}} number of walls, length and chiral angle of MWCNTs on the <b>buckling</b> behaviors are examined. The results show that the <b>buckling</b> behaviors of short MWCNTs are rather different from single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and slender MWCNTs. Moreover, it is observed that the <b>buckling</b> strains of short MWCNTs vary inversely proportional to the number of nanotube walls. For slender MWCNTs, the <b>buckling</b> strains fluctuate as the number of walls increase. It increases for beam-like <b>buckling</b> mode, decreases for shell-like <b>buckling</b> mode and is approximately constant for the shell-beam-like <b>buckling</b> mode.

40|$|Abstract. The out-of-plane {{secondary}} bifurcation <b>buckling</b> load-displacement equilibrium {{paths of}} the elastic circle pipe arch {{with and without}} out-of-plane brace {{at the top of}} the arch are traced using a new numerical tracing strategy. The out-of-plane secondary bifurcation <b>buckling</b> loads of the arch with the same sections and different rise-span ratios are obtained under the concentrated load {{at the top of the}} arch and the full span uniformly distributed load, which are compared with out-of-plane linear <b>buckling</b> load and in-plane primary <b>buckling</b> load. The calculation results show: for the same section circle pipe arches without the out-of-plane brace and under the concentrated load at the top the arch, the out-of-plane secondary <b>buckling</b> load is always less than the in-plane primary <b>buckling</b> load and the out-of-plane <b>buckling</b> will occur before the in-plane primary <b>buckling.</b> The out-of-plane secondary bifurcation <b>buckling</b> load of the arch with 0. 2 rise-span ratio is the biggest.
