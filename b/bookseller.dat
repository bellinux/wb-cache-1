5|$|At {{the age of}} fifteen, Johnson was apprenticed to George Keith, a London <b>bookseller</b> who {{specialized}} in publishing religious tracts such as Reflections on the Modern but Unchristian Practice of Innoculation. As Gerald Tyson, Johnson's major modern biographer, explains, it was unusual for the younger son of a family living in relative obscurity to move to London and to become a <b>bookseller.</b> Scholars have speculated that Johnson was indentured to Keith because the <b>bookseller</b> was associated with Liverpool Baptists. Keith and Johnson published several works together later in their careers, {{which suggests that the}} two remained on friendly terms after Johnson started his own business.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the award}} {{was created by}} The <b>Bookseller,</b> {{the idea of an}} award celebrating books with odd titles was {{proposed}} by Trevor Bounford of the Diagram Group in order to provide entertainment during the Frankfurt Book Fair in 1978. Originally known as the Diagram Group Prize for the Oddest Title at the Frankfurt Book Fair, any book that was at the fair could be nominated, but other books outside of the fair were also included. In 1982, Horace Bent, diarist for The <b>Bookseller,</b> took over administrative duties. Following two occasions in 1987 and 1991 when no prize was given {{due to a lack of}} odd titles, The <b>Bookseller</b> opened suggestions to the readers of the magazine. In 2000, the winner was voted for by the public instead of being decided by Bent. In 2009, online submissions sent on Twitter were accepted. This resulted in the highest number of submissions for the prize in its history, with 90 books being submitted (50 from Twitter), almost three times the number from the previous year (32). However, Bent also expressed his annoyance at people who gave submissions that broke the rules, with some of the books mentioned being published as far back as 1880. The 2014 prize allowed nominations from self-published works, the first book being Strangers Have the Best Candy by Margaret Meps Schulte, which won the prize.|$|E

50|$|When the {{statutory}} copyright term provided {{for by the}} Statute of Anne began to expire in 1731 London <b>booksellers</b> thought to defend their dominant position by seeking injunctions from the Court of Chancery for works by authors that fell outside the statute's protection.

The Scottish <b>booksellers</b> argued that no common law copyright existed in an author's work. The London <b>booksellers</b> argued that the Statute of Anne only supplemented and supported a pre-existing common law copyright. The dispute was argued out in a number of notable cases, including Millar v. Kincaid (1749-1751) and Tonson v. Collins (1761-1762).|$|R

5|$|The Bookseller/Diagram Prize for Oddest Title of the Year, {{originally}} {{known as}} the Diagram Group Prize for the Oddest Title at the Frankfurt Book Fair, commonly {{known as the}} Diagram Prize for short, is a humorous literary award that is given annually to a book with an unusual title. The prize is named after the Diagram Group, an information and graphics company based in London, and The <b>Bookseller,</b> a British trade magazine for the publishing industry. Originally organised to provide entertainment during the 1978 Frankfurt Book Fair, the prize has since been awarded every year by The <b>Bookseller</b> and is now organised by the magazine's diarist Horace Bent. The winner was initially decided by a panel of judges, but since 2000 the winner has been decided by a public vote on The Bookseller′s website.|$|E
