25|$|Madame Patti has {{practically}} {{opened the}} Severn Tunnel… It {{is true that}} very few people knew it, and perhaps Madame Patti herself did not know it, but everybody will <b>be</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> to everybody else. The facts are these. On Sunday Madame Patti and party—a large one—wanted to get from London to Neath with comfort and speed. A special train was arranged for, and the great songstress paid for {{it out of her}} own pocket, or wherever she keeps the great piles of money she has made. Many people will be interested to know that the special train ran along the new route through the Severn Tunnel, and that the whole distance from Paddington to Neath was comfortably traversed in four hours and twelve minutes. This was the first through train from London to South Wales via Bristol and the Severn Tunnel, and Madame Patti chartered it, rode in it, and paid for it, and therefore she has the honour of having opened the Severn Tunnel route to London.|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1958, Hoyland {{prompted}} controversy by offering the island to the American TV quiz show Bid 'n' Buy as a prize. After an outcry {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic, the show's producers settled for offering a car instead. In December 1960, he sold Stroma to James Simpson, an islander whose family had moved to farm on the mainland near the Castle of Mey in 1943. Simpson had not originally intended to buy the island but happened to <b>be</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> with a lawyer: [...] "I said, 'I see Stroma was sold last week, and it's not sold this week. Is it on the market?' 'Yes,' he said, 'Stroma's for sale.' I said, [...] "What kind of money?" [...] So he told me what kind of money, and there and then, the lawyer wrote that I, James Simpson, offered to buy the island of Stroma at a certain figure, and I signed my name at the end of it." [...] His wife was not enthusiastic about the purchase: [...] "Lena nearly flew at me for being so stupid. She says, 'Stroma? What on earth are you going to do with an island?'". He was successful in his bid and used the island to graze his animals, repopulating it with around 200 sheep and 30 cattle.|$|E
500|$|Thom Brennaman {{immediately}} {{hailed the}} game {{as one of the}} greatest upsets in the history of sports; Charissa Thompson told coach Jerry Moore that it was [...] "one of the greatest upsets in college football history." [...] Many media outlets described it as one of, if not the greatest, upsets in the history of college football. The win marked the first time an FCS team had beaten a ranked FBS program. [...] Dan Wetzel of Yahoo! Sports wrote that: [...] "This game was supposed to be the prime example of what had gone wrong in money hungry college football. The powers that be had expanded the season a couple years back, adding an extra game so big schools could bring in cream-puff opponents while collecting millions in revenue. Michigan had never played a I-AA opponent in its history. Now we know why, the Wolverines were ducking them. Instead of an easy tune-up for Michigan, Appalachian State leaves with its most profound victory ever and a check for $400,000 that was supposed to be their pay for getting punished." [...] Sports Illustrated writer Stewart Mandel wrote that he felt [...] "utterly unqualified" [...] to put the game into perspective, and said [...] "there's no logical reason whatsoever this should have happened. But it did. And it wasn't the slightest bit fluky." [...] He also expressed disappointment that he would not be able to vote for the Mountaineers in his AP Poll ballot, explaining that [...] "it may well turn out that Michigan was grossly overrated, but all I know is this: There will not be 25 other teams that accomplish more this opening weekend than Appalachian State did Saturday. There won't even be five." [...] Pat Forde of ESPN.com called it [...] "the most astonishing college football result I can remember," [...] saying that [...] "we'll still <b>be</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> a few decades from now. Especially in the locker rooms of every huge underdog, where they'll say, 'If Appalachian State can beat Michigan, why can't we shock the world, too?.'" [...] He felt the upset was particularly impressive because upsets of such a magnitude do not happen often in college football. The New York Times writer Viv Bernstein called the game [...] "one of the biggest upsets in college football history" [...] and called it [...] "a stunning upset by any measure." [...] The game was the lead story on SportsCenter and was the cover story for the following week's edition of Sports Illustrated; Appalachian State wide receiver Dexter Jackson was featured on the cover, which has the headline [...] "Alltime Upset: Appalachian State Stuns No. 5 Michigan." ...|$|E

They have expressed satisfaction regarding the finale; Daniel Dae Kim stated [...] "If you think about how many pieces the writers had to put together {{in order to make it}} fall into place, it’s mind-boggling, and they did such a great job... For me it was very satisfying. After I read it, I had to sit for five or 10 minutes, just reflecting and digesting, because it definitely makes an impact." [...] Emerson said: [...] Carbonell described the finale as being [...] "all about everyone’s resolutions." [...] Cusick said [...] "There are so many walks of life getting together to talk about the show and so many issues to be brought up and that's exactly what the ending will bring up.

60|$|It was now eleven o'clock. When had the Port house {{been open}} so late as that? The {{people in the}} town must <b>be</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> {{and there would be}} more talking the next day. Perhaps it might be in the town paper. The morning would be worse than the night. She could not bear it any longer. There was now nothing to be heard in front but that maddening chatter in the parlor, and up the back stairs came the snores of the servant. She got a traveling-bag from a closet and {{proceeded}} to pack it; then she put on her bonnet and shawl and put into her bag all the money she had with her, trembling all the time {{as if she had been}} a thief: robbing her own house. She could not go down the back stairs, because, as has been said, she could have been seen from the parlor; but a carpenter had been mending the railing of a little piazza at the back of the house, and she remembered he had left his ladder. Down this ladder, with her bag in her hand, Miss Port silently moved. She looked into the kitchen; she could not see the servant, but she could hear her snoring on a bench. Clapping her hand over the girl's mouth, she whispered into her ear, and without a word the frightened creature sat up and followed Miss Port into the yard.|$|E

6000|$|They had at first, {{none the}} less, in the {{scattered}} hours spent together, made no allusion to that view of it; {{which was a}} sign he was handsomely alert to give that he didn't expect, that he in fact didn't care, always to <b>be</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Such a feature in one's outlook was really like a hump on one's back. The difference it made every minute of the day existed quite independently of discussion. One discussed of course like a hunchback, for there was always, if nothing else, the hunchback face. That remained, and she was watching him; but people watched best, as a general thing, in silence, so that such would be predominantly the manner of their vigil. Yet he didn't want, at the same time, to be tense and solemn; tense and solemn was what he imagined he too much showed for with other people. The thing to be, with {{the one person who}} knew, was easy and natural--to make the reference rather than be seeming to avoid it, to avoid it rather than be seeming to make it, and to keep it, in any case, familiar, facetious even, rather than pedantic and portentous. Some such consideration as the latter was doubtless in his mind for instance when he wrote pleasantly to Miss Bartram that perhaps the great thing he had so long felt as in the lap of the gods was no more than this circumstance, which touched him so nearly, of her acquiring a house in London. It was the first allusion they had yet again made, needing any other hitherto so little; but when she replied, after having given him the news, that she was by no means satisfied with such a trifle as the climax to so special a suspense, she almost set him wondering if she hadn't even a larger conception of singularity for him than he had for himself. He was at all events destined to become aware little by little, as time went by, that she was all the while looking at his life, judging it, measuring it, {{in the light of the}} thing she knew, which grew to be at last, with the consecration of the years, never mentioned between them save as [...] "the real truth" [...] about him. That had always been his own form of reference to it, but she adopted the form so quietly that, looking back at the end of a period, he knew there was no moment at which it was traceable that she had, as he might say, got inside his idea, or exchanged the attitude of beautifully indulging for that of still more beautifully believing him.|$|E
6000|$|One day a {{woman that}} I know {{came face to face}} with heroic beauty, that highest beauty which Blake says changes least from youth to age, a beauty which has been fading out of the arts, since that {{decadence}} we call progress, set voluptuous beauty in its place. She was standing at the window, looking over to Knocknarea where Queen Maive is thought to be buried, when she saw, as she has told me, [...] "the finest woman you ever saw travelling right across from the mountain and straight to her." [...] The woman had a sword by her side and a dagger lifted up in her hand, and was dressed in white, with bare arms and feet. She looked [...] "very strong, but not wicked," [...] that is, not cruel. The old woman had seen the Irish giant, and [...] "though he was a fine man," [...] he was nothing to this woman, [...] "for he was round, and could not have stepped out so soldierly"; [...] "she was like Mrs.-----" [...] a stately lady of the neighbourhood, [...] "but she had no stomach on her, and was slight and broad in the shoulders, and was handsomer than any one you ever saw; she looked about thirty." [...] The old woman covered her eyes with her hands, and when she uncovered them the apparition had vanished. The neighbours were [...] "wild with her," [...] she told me, because she did not wait to find out if there was a message, for they were sure it was Queen Maive, who often shows herself to the pilots. I asked the old woman if she had seen others like Queen Maive, and she said, [...] "Some of them have their hair down, but they look quite different, like the sleepy-looking ladies one sees in the papers. Those with their hair up are like this one. The others have long white dresses, but those with their hair up have short dresses, so that you can see their legs right up to the calf." [...] After some careful questioning I found that they wore what might very well be a kind of buskin; she went on, [...] "They are fine and dashing looking, like the men one sees riding their horses in twos and threes on the slopes of the mountains with their swords swinging." [...] She repeated over and over, [...] "There is no such race living now, none so finely proportioned," [...] or the like, and then said, [...] "The present Queen[FN#7] is a nice, pleasant- looking woman, but she is not like her. What makes me think so little of the ladies is that I see none as they be," [...] meaning as the spirits. [...] "When I think of her and of the ladies now, they are like little children running about without knowing how to put their clothes on right. Is it the ladies? Why, I would not call them women at all." [...] The other day a friend of mine questioned an old woman in a Galway workhouse about Queen Maive, and was told that [...] "Queen Maive was handsome, and overcame all her enemies with a bawl stick, for the hazel is blessed, and the best weapon that can be got. You might walk the world with it," [...] but she grew [...] "very disagreeable in the end--oh very disagreeable. Best not to <b>be</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Best leave it between the book and the hearer." [...] My friend thought the old woman had got some scandal about Fergus son of Roy and Maive in her head.|$|E

[...] This rivalry {{is said to have}} been one of the most contentious and embittered in all of tennis history.|$|E

5000|$|Mike Mahardy from GameSpot {{scored the}} game a perfect 10/10, saying: [...] "Uncharted 4 is a {{challenge}} to the medium. In its writing, in its design, in its understanding of what makes games unique, Uncharted 4 is something to aspire to. Its a shining example. And well <b>be</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> for years to come." [...] In giving the game a score of 4/5, Leon Hurley for GamesRadar commended the visuals, the combat and exploration, which he said was the best in the series, and the larger environments. However, Hurley disliked Sam for feeling like an unnecessary character, and the first portion of the game for not being as well paced as the later portion.|$|E
5000|$|According to UFO author David Clarke in 2014, the [...] "spaceman" [...] is {{most likely}} Templeton's wife, Annie, who {{was present at the}} time and was seen on other {{photographs}} taken that day. [...] "I think for some reason his wife walked into the shot and he didn't see her because with that particular make of camera you could only see 70% of what was in the shot through the viewfinder", said Clarke. Annie Templeton was wearing a pale blue dress on the day in question, which was overexposed as white in the other photos; she also had dark bobbed hair. It has been argued that, when using photo software to darken the image and straighten the horizon, the figure increasingly appears to be a regular person viewed from behind. Of its impact, Clarke said: [...] "People will still <b>be</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> in another 50 years." ...|$|E

5000|$|Coulter, citing various {{critics of}} {{evolution}} and proponents of intelligent design, devotes approximately {{one-third of the}} book to attacks on evolution, which Coulter terms [...] "Darwinism." [...] Coulter turned to leading intelligent design proponents for tutors in writing {{this section of the}} book: [...] "I couldn't have written about evolution without the generous tutoring of Michael Behe, David Berlinski, and William Dembski…" [...] Behe, Dembski and Berlinski are all fellows of the Discovery Institute, the hub of the intelligent design movement, which Coulter endorses in the book. Chapter 8, [...] "The Creation Myth: On the Sixth Day, God Created Fruit Flies", advances the book's thesis that liberalism is a religion, this time by attempting to show what she argues is its cosmogony. The chapter begins: Liberals' creation myth is Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, which is about one notch above Scientology in scientific rigor. It's a make-believe story, based on a theory that is a tautology, with no proof in the scientist's laboratory or the fossil record—and that's after 150 years of very determined looking. We wouldn't still <b>be</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> but for the fact that liberals think evolution disproves God.|$|E

He subsequently purchased the rights to Drawn to Trouble , Hebborn's 1991 confessional autobiography, which was republished as Confessions of a Master Forger [...] following Hebborn's death in 1996, with an epilogue written by Balfour-Oatts. In 1997 he completed and published The Art Forger's Handbook [...] from Hebborn's manuscript notes, a book that achieved something approaching cult status amongst the art student and art crime communities, a second-hand copy of which can command a price of several hundred dollars. Speaking about the project in a recent interview with the BBC World Service, he said [...] "I was so young and rebellious...there was nothing happening in the market so I had to be creative.
