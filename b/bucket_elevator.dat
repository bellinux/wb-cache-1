500|$|In 1783, two of Evans's {{brothers}} {{began building}} a mill in Newport {{on part of}} the family's farm estate which they purchased from their father, and Evans was recruited to oversee its construction on the Red Clay Creek. When the mill opened in 1785 it was of a conventional design, {{but over the next}} five years Evans began to experiment with inventions to reduce the reliance upon labor for milling. Moving wheat from the bottom to the top of the mill to begin the process was the most onerous task of all in contemporary mills. Evans's first innovation was a <b>bucket</b> <b>elevator</b> to facilitate this process. Chains of buckets to raise water was a Roman technology had been used in various guises since antiquity. Evans had seen diagrams of their use for marine applications and realized with some modification and careful engineering they could be used to raise grain, so a series of bucket elevators around a mill could move grain and flour from one process to the next. Another labor-intensive task was that of spreading meal. This came out of the grinding process warm and moist, needing cooling and drying before it could be sifted and packed. Traditionally the task was done by manually shoveling meal across large floors. In response, Evans developed the [...] "hopper boy", a device which gathered meal from a <b>bucket</b> <b>elevator</b> and spread it evenly over the drying floor—a mechanical rake would revolve around the floorspace. [...] This would even out newly deposited meal for cooling and drying, while a gentle incline in the design of the rake blades would slowly move the flour towards central chutes, from which the material would be sifted. Used in conjunction, the two innovations saved many hours of labor and greatly reduced the risk of contamination.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: <b>Bucket</b> <b>elevators</b> are {{devices for}} the {{vertical}} conveying of bulk materials. They {{can be found}} in many plants where silos are used. There are different designs of <b>bucket</b> <b>elevators,</b> whereby for the conveying of combustible bulk materials twin-leg <b>bucket</b> <b>elevators</b> are widely used. The conveyed bulk materials might be quite different, e. g. granulates, grains or pellets, which can contain more or less fine dust. The fine dust will be whirled up and dispersed by the moving buckets. Explosive dust/air mixtures can occur inside the <b>elevator.</b> <b>Bucket</b> <b>elevators</b> are frequently reported as causes of dust explosions [1, 2]. Depending on both the practical operating conditions and the explosion characteristics of the bulk material in many cases explosion protection by prevention of ignition sources are not sufficient to minimize the risk of a dust explosion. Therefore, additional explosion protection by design measures is required in order to limit the dangerous effects of a dust explosion. The technical rules or standards, however, which are available for the layout of explosion protection by design measures, e. g. explosion pressure venting or explosion suppression can not be used due to the specific geometry of <b>bucket</b> <b>elevators.</b> Because there was no sufficient data base to design explosion resistant <b>bucket</b> <b>elevators</b> in combination with explosion venting or explosion suppression, large scale tests were carried out on the test site of BGN and FS...|$|R

50|$|The grain {{elevator}} may contain {{several types of}} these conveyors, such as belt or drag conveyors. In addition, they utilize <b>bucket</b> <b>elevators</b> to lift the grain from the drop off point to the storage bins. <b>Bucket</b> <b>elevators</b> {{can be used in}} many places of final storage or use, after grain is dropped off by whatever form of transportation was used to get it there. Bucket conveyors often impart little mechanical damage because the grains are not continually moving with respect to each other. Grain damage is only imparted when the kernels are loaded into the buckets {{at the bottom of the}} elevator and when they are discharged at the top.|$|R

50|$|The battery {{contains}} three components, {{the battery}} shed, an associated cottage and a water pump. The battery shed is constructed on a bush timber frame with heavy bush timber uprights. The shed is clad in corrugated iron. Components of the crushing plant include timbered ore chutes to two primary crusher pits (one jaw crusher remains in situ), connected by two external ore <b>bucket</b> <b>elevators</b> to the ore bins, self-feeding 3 five-head stamp batteries. The two <b>bucket</b> <b>elevators</b> have been removed; however, their vertical housings form a distinctive external feature. The battery launders are intact {{but there are}} no copper amalgam plates. Only one of three slimes tables remain. A gas engine which formed the main power plant has recently been removed. Two berdan pans and a grinding pan remain in situ. A lean-to section alongside the battery building contains a smithy and a small workshop.|$|R
5000|$|To prevent dust {{explosions and}} fires, {{employers}} must (among other things):Develop {{and implement a}} written housekeeping program with instructions to reduce dust accumulations on ledges, floors, equipment and other exposed surfaces.Identify [...] "priority" [...] housekeeping areas in grain elevators. The [...] "priority" [...] housekeeping areas include floor areas within 35 feet of inside <b>bucket</b> <b>elevators,</b> floors of enclosed areas containing grinding equipment and floors of enclosed areas containing grain dryers located inside the facility. Dust accumulations in these priority housekeeping areas shall not exceed 1/8th inch. Employers should {{make every effort to}} minimize dust accumulations on exposed surfaces since dust is the fuel for a fire or explosion, and it is recognized that a 1/8 inch dust accumulation is more than enough to fuel such occurrences.Inside <b>bucket</b> <b>elevators</b> can undergo primary explosions. OSHA's grain handling standard requires that belts for these <b>bucket</b> <b>elevators</b> purchased after March 30, 1988 are conductive and have a surface electrical resistance not exceeding 300 megohms. <b>Bucket</b> <b>elevators</b> must have an opening to the head pulley section and boot section to allow for inspection, maintenance, and cleaning. Bearings must be mounted externally to the leg casing or the employer must provide vibration, temperature, or other monitoring of the conditions of the bearings if the bearings are mounted inside or partially inside the leg casing. These <b>bucket</b> <b>elevators</b> must be equipped with a motion detection device which will shut-down the elevator when the belt speed is reduced by no more than 20% of the normal operating speed.Implement a preventative maintenance program with regularly scheduled inspections for mechanical and safety control equipment, which may include heat producing equipment such as motors, bearings, belts etc. Preventive maintenance is critical to controlling ignition sources. The use of vibration detection methods, heat sensitive tape or other heat detection methods can help in the implementation of the program.Minimize ignition sources through controlling hot work (electric or gas welding, cutting, brazing or similar flame producing operations).Install wiring and electrical equipment suitable for hazardous locations.Design and properly locate dust collection systems to minimize explosion hazards. All filter collectors installed after March 1988 shall be located outside the facility or located in an area inside the facility protected by an explosion suppression system or located in an area that is separated from other areas by construction having at least a one-hour fire resistance rating and which is located next to an exterior wall vented to the outside.Install an effective means of removing ferrous material from grain streams so that such material does not enter equipment such as hammer mills, grinders and pulverizers.|$|R
50|$|Bulk {{materials}} such as coal, ores, grains and wood chips are handled by belt, chain, slat, pneumatic or screw conveyors, <b>bucket</b> <b>elevators</b> and mobile equipment such as front-end loaders. Materials on pallets are handled with forklifts. Also used for handling heavy items like reels of paper, steel or machinery are electric overhead cranes, sometimes called bridge cranes because they span large factory bays.|$|R
50|$|In {{agriculture}} and manufacturing, an elevator/lift is {{any type of}} conveyor device used to lift materials in a continuous stream into bins or silos. Several types exist, such as the chain and <b>bucket</b> <b>elevator,</b> grain auger screw conveyor using the principle of Archimedes' screw, or the chain and paddles or forks of hay elevators.|$|E
50|$|Early bucket {{elevators}} used a flat chain with small, steel buckets attached every few inches. While some elevators still are manufactured {{with a chain}} and steel buckets, most current <b>bucket</b> <b>elevator</b> construction uses a rubber belt with plastic buckets. Pulleys several feet in diameter are used {{at the top and}} bottom. The top pulley is driven by an electric motor.|$|E
50|$|A sand slinger {{is a type}} {{of machine}} used for filling and uniform ramming of sand in molds, and is {{particularly}} adopted with advantage of large molds.This machine consists of a heavy base, a bin or hopper to carry sand, a <b>bucket</b> <b>elevator</b> to which a heavy number of buckets and a swinging arm are attached, which carries a conveyor belt and the sand impeller head.|$|E
50|$|Once mixed, {{the coal}} would {{continue}} up on another system of <b>bucket</b> <b>elevators</b> to the coal distribution conveyor belt that {{ran along the}} top of the boiler building. From this conveyor, the coal would fall into the loaders and from there was directed through downspouts to the rotating grate conveyor inside the boiler, where it burned slowly, producing a temperature inside the boiler of approximately 1200°C.|$|R
50|$|It all {{begins at}} the Praça do Carvão (Coal Square), the {{reception}} space, also a venue for exhibits and events; it was here in this location that, arriving from the Tagus River, tons of coal was unloaded to supply the boilers. In this same square, visitors can observe the sieve, the silos and the <b>bucket</b> <b>elevators</b> that mixed and carried the coal to the building’s upper section and the High-Pressure boilers.|$|R
50|$|Bulk {{material}} handling systems are typically composed of stationary machinery such as conveyor belts, screw conveyors, tubular drag conveyors, moving floors, toploaders, stackers, reclaimers, <b>bucket</b> <b>elevators,</b> truck dumpers, railcar dumpers or wagon tipplers, shiploaders, hoppers and diverters and various mobile {{equipment such as}} loaders, mobile hopper loaders / unloaders, various shuttles, combined with storage facilities such as stockyards, storage silos or stockpiles.
