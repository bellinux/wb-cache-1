25|$|The {{standard}} allows indexed color PNGs to have 1, 2, 4 or 8 bits per pixel; grayscale {{images with}} no alpha channel may have 1, 2, 4, 8 or 16 <b>bits</b> <b>per</b> <b>pixel.</b> Everything else uses a bit depth per channel of either 8 or 16. The combinations this allows {{are given in}} the table above. The standard requires that decoders can read all supported color formats, but many image editors can only produce a small subset of them.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the options}} in the JPEG {{standard}} are not commonly used, and as mentioned above, most image software uses the simpler JFIF format when creating a JPEG file, which among other things specifies the encoding method. Here is {{a brief description of}} one of the more common methods of encoding when applied to an input that has 24 <b>bits</b> <b>per</b> <b>pixel</b> (eight each of red, green, and blue). This particular option is a lossy data compression method.|$|E
25|$|The format {{supports}} up to 8 <b>bits</b> <b>per</b> <b>pixel</b> {{for each}} image, allowing a single image to reference its own palette {{of up to}} 256 different colors chosen from the 24-bit RGB color space. It also supports animations and allows a separate palette of up to 256 colors for each frame. These palette limitations make GIF less suitable for reproducing color photographs and other images with color gradients, but it is well-suited for simpler images such as graphics or logos with solid areas of color.|$|E
50|$|The typical {{data rate}} of an I-frame is 1 <b>bit</b> <b>per</b> <b>pixel</b> while {{that of a}} P-frame is 0.1 <b>bit</b> <b>per</b> <b>pixel</b> and for a B-frame, 0.015 <b>bit</b> <b>per</b> <b>pixel.</b>|$|R

Rate distortion curves and derived power spectra are used to develop coding algorithms in the preprocessed "perceptual space. " Black and white image compressions down to. 1 <b>bit</b> <b>per</b> <b>pixel</b> are obtained. In addition, color images are compressed to 1 <b>bit</b> <b>per</b> <b>pixel</b> (1 / 3 <b>bit</b> <b>per</b> <b>pixel</b> <b>per</b> color) with less than 1 % mean square error and no visible degradations. Minor distor-tions are incurred with compressions down to 1 / 4 <b>bit</b> <b>per</b> <b>pixel</b> (1 / 12 <b>bit</b> <b>per</b> <b>pixel</b> <b>per</b> color).

25|$|Proper {{reproduction}} of colors, especially in professional environments, requires color management {{of all the}} devices involved in the production process, many of them using RGB. Color management results in several transparent conversions between device-independent and device-dependent color spaces (RGB and others, as CMYK for color printing) during a typical production cycle, {{in order to ensure}} color consistency throughout the process. Along with the creative processing, such interventions on digital images can damage the color accuracy and image detail, especially where the gamut is reduced. Professional digital devices and software tools allow for 48 bpp (<b>bits</b> <b>per</b> <b>pixel)</b> images to be manipulated (16 bits per channel), to minimize any such damage.|$|E
25|$|Windows Color System {{is based}} on a {{completely}} new Color Infrastructure and Translation Engine (CITE). It is backed up by a new color processing pipeline that supports bit-depths more than 32 <b>bits</b> <b>per</b> <b>pixel,</b> multiple color channels (more than 3), alternative color spaces and high dynamic range coloring, using a technology named Kyuanos developed by Canon. The color processing pipeline allows device developers to add their own gamut mapping algorithm into the pipeline to customize the color response of the device. The new pipeline also uses floating point calculations to minimize round-off losses, which are inherent in integer processing. Once the color pipeline finishes processing the colors, the CITE engine applies a color transform according to a color profile, specific to a device to ensure the output color matches to what is expected.|$|E
25|$|For information, the {{uncompressed}} 24-bit RGB {{bitmap image}} below (73,242 pixels) would require 219,726 bytes (excluding all other information headers). The filesizes indicated below include the internal JPEG information headers and some metadata. For highest quality images (Q=100), about 8.25 bits per color pixel is required. On grayscale images, {{a minimum of}} 6.5 <b>bits</b> <b>per</b> <b>pixel</b> is enough (a comparable Q=100 quality color information requires about 25% more encoded bits). The highest quality image below (Q=100) is encoded at nine bits per color pixel, the medium quality image (Q=25) uses one bit per color pixel. For most applications, the quality factor should not go below 0.75 bit per pixel (Q=12.5), {{as demonstrated by the}} low quality image. The image at lowest quality uses only 0.13 bit per pixel, and displays very poor color. This is useful when the image will be displayed in a significantly scaled-down size. A method for creating better quantization matrices for a given image quality using PSNR instead of the Q factor is described in Minguillón & Pujol (2001).|$|E

2500|$|Whereas GIF {{is limited}} to 8-bit indexed color, PNG gives a much wider range of color depths, {{including}} 24-bit (8 bits per channel) and 48-bit (16 bits per channel) truecolor, allowing for greater color precision, smoother fades, etc. [...] When an alpha channel is added, up to 64 <b>bits</b> <b>per</b> <b>pixel</b> (before compression) are possible.|$|E

40|$|Concerning Data-processing {{this thesis}} dealed with two topics: The {{handling}} of the especial radiometry of ERS- 1. SAR data and the processing of the ERS- 1. UILR product, which is unique among other SAR products because of its degraded resolution (8 <b>bit</b> <b>per</b> <b>pixel</b> radiometric-, 100 m geometric resolution). The images of almost all other ERS- 1. SAR products come with a radiometric resolution of 16 <b>bit</b> <b>per</b> <b>pixel.</b> Investigations led to the demand for processing the data in this resolution instead of converting them to 8 <b>bit</b> <b>per</b> <b>pixel</b> before processing. Especially for further interpretation and analysis, which depends upon the radiometry of the images, a satisfying conversion to 8 <b>bit</b> <b>per</b> <b>pixel</b> is not possible. In the context of that demand the applicability of common 'speckle'-filter-algorithms to 16 -bit SAR data has been shown. For ERS- 1. UILR images a complete processing-chain has been developed, {{taking into account the}} especial product-parameters. The processing includes the removal of fill-pixel, the correction of shading and the rectification of the images. All processing steps can be applied without user-interaction. The utilization of the ERS- 1, UILR product beyond its specifications has been made possible. The enormous potential of ERS- 1. SAR data for monitoring tasks has been shown with two examples for data-interpretation: The flooding of the river Rhine (1993 / 94) has been documented, {{and the use of the}} 100 -m ERS- 1. SAR data for ice-dirft monitoring has been demonstrated. Finally an integrated SAR data-management and -processing system has been implemented, however limited to a single SAR product: ERS- 1. UILR. It was shown that the management of SAR-data in a georeferenced meta-database, as well as the processing of the images supported by this database is possible. The integrated system has been applied to various tasks in education and research. An easy and comfortable SAR-Data handling has been made possible. (orig.)
