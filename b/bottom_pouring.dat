Metal permanent forced cooling effect increases the undercooling degree, {{and the formation of}} Ti 5 Si 3 can hinder the grain growth and the formation of nucleation particles, and Nb elements are conducive to the formation of B 2 phase, and these three reasons refined the grain size. Intorduction In recent decades, TiAl based alloy as the next generation of new lightweight high-temperature structural materials attracted wide attention from scholars [1 - 5], especially in the aerospace field. The NASA estimates that in 2020 the amount of material throughout the engine for 20 % to 25 % will be TiAl based alloys. TiAl based alloy has many outstanding characteristics, it has a good combination property, such as: (1) has a relatively low density, high temperature resistant material than the current-temperature nickel based alloy is even lower than 50 %; (2) having high specific strength and specific modulus, and high temperature can maintain sufficiently high strength and rigidity; (3) has a good resistance to creep and oxidation resistance.

Hitherto it had usually been calm at night, but on this {{occasion}} we had a strong westerly squall with rain, which turned our prau broadside, and obliged us to anchor. When it had passed we went on rowing all night, but the wind ahead counteracted the current in our favour, and we advanced but little. Soon after sunrise the wind became stronger and more adverse, and as we had a dangerous lee-shore which we could not clear, {{we had to put}} about and get an offing to the W.S.W. This series of contrary winds and bad weather ever since we started, not having had a single day of fair wind, was very remarkable. My men firmly believed there was something unlucky in the boat, and told me I ought to have had a certain ceremony gone through before starting, consisting of boring a hole in the <b>bottom</b> and <b>pouring</b> some kind of holy oil through it. It must be remembered that this was the season of the south-east monsoon, and yet we had not had even half a day's south-east wind since we left Waigiou.

The night was equally squally and changeable, and kept us hard at work taking in and making sail, and rowing in the intervals.|$|R

The hardness test and its comparison show that the hardness value of SiC composite is higher than TiB 2 composite. Mechanical testing was carried out on the tensile samples prepared from the two cast composite specimens. From tensile test results it has been observed that the tensile strength of TiB 2 composite is 30 % higher than SiC composite.

40|$|The fPN {{actuators}} {{were made}} similarly to sPN actuators, as described previously 1 - 3. First, molds {{were made in}} acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) using a three-dimensional (3 D) printer (Dimension 3 D; Stratasys, Inc.) based on a computer-aided-design (CAD) drawing (Solidworks Corp, Waltham, MA). The fPN actuator required three molds: an interior and exterior mold for the top extensible layer and a third mold for the bottom inextensible layer (Fig. S 1). The interior mold consisted of chambers connected by a single channel, so that all chambers inflate simultaneously. The connecting channel had a smaller height (1 mm) than the chambers (10. 5 mm); this difference caused the chambers to expand preferentially when pressurized. The features of the exterior mold consisted of straight parallel plates that fit in between each chamber of the interior mold. The plates separate the elastomeric material between each chamber such that no two chambers shared an inside wall. We fabricated the <b>bottom</b> layer by <b>pouring</b> elastomer in a flat mold that contained a piece of paper, which served as the inextensible material. The top layer was placed inside the bottom layer before curing so that the elastomer was cured in place.

40|$|Scientific and {{practical}} {{interest is the}} application of alloying alloy-modifiers for secondary treatment of high-strength cast iron to stabilize the process of spheroidization graphite and achieving higher physical-mechanical properties of castings. The peculiarity of the high-strength cast irons manufacturing technology is their tendency to supercooling during solidification in the mold. This leads {{to the formation of}} shrinkage defects and structurally free cementite, especially in thin-walled sections of the finished castings. To minimize these effects in foundry practice during production of ductile iron the secondary inoculation is widely used. In this regard, the question of the choice of the additives with effective impact not only on the graphitization process but also on the formation of the metallic base of ductile iron is relevant. The aim of the present work is to study the peculiarities of structure formation in cast iron with nodular graphite when alloying alloy-modifier based on tin with additions of nanoparticles of titanium carbide, yttrium oxide and graphite nano-pipes is used for secondary treatment. Melting of iron in laboratory conditions was performed in crucible induction furnace IST- 006 with an acid lining held. Spheroidizing treatment of melt was realized with magnesium containing alloying alloy FeSiMg 7 by means of ladle method. Secondary treatment of high strength cast iron was carried out by addition of alloying alloy-modifier in an amount of 0. 1 % to the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>pouring</b> ladle. Cast samples for chemical composition analysis, study of microstructure, technological and mechanical properties of the resultant alloy were made. Studies have shown that the secondary treatment of high strength cast iron with developed modifier-alloying alloy results in formation of the perlite metallic base due to the tin impact and nodular graphite with regular shape under the influence of titanium carbide, yttrium oxide and graphite nano-pipes. The tendency of high strength cast iron to Â«white cast ironÂ» formation has been minimized, and the mechanical properties of the alloy produced correspond to HSCI 80. </p...|$|R

The percentages of SiC particles used were m the range o f 5 to 25 volume percent, samples were cast into ingot or tensile specimen, and some samples were heat treated by precipitation hardening with T 6 artificial ageing. It was found that the both increasing the silicon carbide content, and T 6 artificial treatment increase the mechanical properties such as hardness and tensile strength of the matrix alloy. Charactenzation of the MMCs produced included observation of microstructure, porosity content measurement, tensile strength, microhardness, and compression strength measurements. The fabrication approach was successful in producing cast MMCs samples which have reasonable mechanical properties The use of clean SiC particles, magnesium as a wetting agent, and continuous stirring while the MMC slurry is solidifying were found to promote the wettability o f SiC and A 359 matrix alloy Decreasing the solidifying time was found to improve the wettability significantly...|$|E

Research limitations/implications: It was concluded that all stages of ultra-pure steel production must be conducted conscientiously and meticulously. It is also necessary to improve the conditions of vacuum steel refining process by equipping steelworks with a new vacuum device, e. g. of VOD type. Practical implications: If all stages of steel making are conducted conscientiously and meticulously and the steelworks are equipped with a device for vacuum steel refinement, then the produced steel (from {{the point of view of}} quality) can be competitive in the market of the ultra-pure steel intended for forged products. Originality/value: The simulation results concerning the production of refining slag show that the use of bauxite as a slag forming material leads to an increase in the share of liquid phase. Refining steel under a heating layer contributes to the improvement of steel purity â€“ which is measured by analysing the share of surface nonmetallic inclusions. Refining steel under refining slag with a basic character and physical properties adapted to the temperature close to the liquidus temperature of steel contributes to a decrease in the amount of non-metallic inclusions, a decrease in their size. It can aslo affect the shape of inclusions - making them almost spherical in shape.

Efforts were taken to develop composite with three emerging reinforcements like SiC/Al 2 O 3 /TiB 2 and its compositions were 5 %, 3 % and 2 % respectively. The aluminium metal matrix designed for this composite is aluminium alloy Al 6061. Stir casting <b>bottom</b> <b>pouring</b> technique was used to fabricate the specimen successfully. The fabricated Hybrid metal matrix composite after various attempts was made to undergo various tests to examine its strength and property. Specimen was made from the casting and micro structural analysis was carried out using optical microscope and SEM. Results of micro structural analysis prove the existence and dispersion of reinforcements in the matrix phase [...] Specimens were prepared {{in order to test}} its hardness due to the addition reinforcements. Vickers hardness test and its value which is equal to 122. 13 HRC indicate elevated hardness value upto 50 % when compare to the hardness value of parent alloy. Tensile specimens were prepared using wire EDM as per ASTM E 8 standards. There is no considerable improvement in tensile strength due to addition of above reinforcements. Failure analysis was carried and the factors caused failure was analyzed. In order to study and understand the wear resistance property of Composite which it is mainly known for, wear test was carried out and test results proves the increase in wear resistance property of Composite in terms of frictional force and coefficient of friction. Introduction. Requirement of engineering materials paves the way for invention of advanced materials like super alloys, ceramics, and composites. In these advanced materials Composites have distinguished properties such as increased wear resistance, high specific strength, strength-to-weight ratio, strength to cost ratio etc. This unique property finds application in aerospace, defense, marine, etc. This motivates researchers to fabricate composite with constitution of various reinforcements with aluminum matrix. The addition any one of the reinforcements like SiC, B 4 C, Al 2 O 3, ZrSiO 4, TiN, and TiB 2 have been carried out and in process as well. Efforts have been initiated to fabricate metal matrix using in situ salt reactions [1]. The stir casting process parameters were thoroughly examined by Pai. It has been concluded that, stir casting process is relatively simple and less expensive as compared to other processing methods [2, 3]. Production of composites using stir casting process needs equal distribution of abrasive particles with the metal matrix. S.

The metal matrix selected was Al- 6061. The composition of reinforcement with the metal matrix is 10 wt percent. Stir casting <b>bottom</b> <b>pouring</b> technique was chosen to fabricate the composite. From the cast specimen various samples were cut to study its mechanical and tribological property after the addition of reinforcement. The optical and SEM image shows the presence and dispersion of reinforcements in the metal matrix phase. The spectrum processing was carried out and the result confirms the presence of Zirconium, Silicon, oxygen and aluminium. The Vickers hardness test shows elevated hardness value due to the addition of reinforcement ZrSiO 4 and its value is 101. 1 HRC. The tensile specimens were prepared using wire-EDM process as per ASTM-E 8 standard. The tensile value reveals that there was an improvement in tensile strength of composite and its value is 0. 094 Gpa. Also, fractography study was done using scanning electron microscope to understand the causes of failure of specimen. Wear test was carried out on the composite using a linear reciprocating tribometer. The wear test result confirms high wear resistance due to the addition of ZrSiO 4 reinforcement in aluminium matrix. Introduction. Composites material has high stiffness and high strength, low density, improved wear resistance, etc. When designed precisely, the newly combined materials produce enhanced strength than would each individual material. The addition of ceramic particles like SiC, Al 2 O 3, B 4 C, Al 2 O 3 to an aluminum based matrix does not much alter the density of material but instead it usually leads to a considerable rise in strength and modulus of composite. Alaneme, studied the mechanical behaviour of alumina reinforced with 6063 metal matrix composite developed by two step â€“ stir casting process. AA 6063 â€“ Al 2 O 3 particulate composites having 6, 9, 15, and 18 volume percent of reinforcement were produced [...] [1] Sreenivasan fabricated TiB 2 /Al metal matrix composites by stir casting route with 5, 10 and 15 % of TiB 2 and studied the wear behaviour of composite. It was observed that the wear rate was higher for the unreinforced aluminium alloy when compared to the reinforced composites. Wear rate was decreased with increasing TiB 2 content in the MMC composites[2]. The composite fabricated using stircasting technique exhibit uniform distribution. Result of uniform distribution of reinforcement in the metal matrix confirm elevated mechanical behavior[3]. Also addition of reinforcements like Al 2 O 3, SiC, TiB 2 in the metal matrix improves hardness and thermal property [4]. It has been observed that, elongation decreses when the percentage reinforcement increases, but tensile and hardness value will be high[5, 6]. The homogeneity of reinforcement and uniform distribution of reinforcement particles in metal matrix depend upon stir casing parameters [7]. From the literature review it was noted that the most commonly used abrasive reinforcement with aluminium matrix are SiC, Al 2 O 3, B 4 C and TiB 2 and not much published literature on Zirconium silicate as reinforcement.
