5|$|In 1991, the Athens Airport {{charged a}} 25% higher landing fee for those {{aircraft}} arriving between 11:00 and 17:00 during the high tourism season during summer. Hong Kong charges an additional flat fee to the <b>basic</b> <b>weight</b> charge. In 1991–92 peak pricing at London's main airports Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted was implemented; airlines were charged different landing fees for peak and off-peak operations {{depending on the}} weight of aircraft. For example, {{in the case of}} a Boeing 757, the peak landing fee was about 2.5 times higher than the off-peak fee in all three airports. For a Boeing 747 the differential was even higher, as the old 747 carries a higher noise charge. Though related to runway congestion, the main objective of these peak charges at the major British airports was to raise revenue for investment.|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{popularity}} of Gill Sans, some reviews have been critical. Robert Harling, who knew Gill, wrote in his 1976 anthology examining Gill's lettering that {{the density of the}} <b>basic</b> <b>weight</b> made it unsuitable for extended passages of text, printing a passage in it as a demonstration. The regular weight has been used to print body text for some trade printing uses such as guides to countryside walks published by the LNER system. William Addison Dwiggins described it and Futura as [...] "fine in the capitals and bum in the lower-case" [...] while proposing to create a more individualistic competitor, Metro, for Linotype around 1929. Modern writers, including Stephen Coles and Ben Archer, have criticised it for failing to improve on Johnston and for unevenness of colour, especially in the bolder weights (discussed below). More generally, modern font designer Jonathan Hoefler has criticised Johnston and Gill's designs for rigidity, calling their work [...] "products more of the machine than the hand, chilly and austere designs shaped by unbending rules, whose occasional moments of whimsy were so out of place as to feel volatile and disquieting.” ...|$|E

5000|$|Antique Olive is a humanist {{sans-serif}} typeface ("antique" [...] being {{equivalent to}} sans-serif in French typographic conventions).

In “Taking Prisoners in Munzano,” the town seems made of mountain huts, dotted with sienna roofs, as a firing squad exercises its duty much as a monk washes his bowl. The forests are rendered in smoky hues, stacked atop one another in billowy calligraphic curls. Notan theory, wherein the composition is unchanged in its <b>basic</b> <b>weight</b> no matter what direction the picture is held, applies to these early works and is something that Fontaine carried throughout his life as a painter.|$|E

40|$|Optical {{character}} recognition (OCR) {{is the most}} commonly used technique to convert printed material into electronic form. Using OCR, large repositories of machine readable text can be created in a short time. An information retrieval system can then be used to search through large information bases thus created. Many information retrieval systems use sophisticated term weighting functions to improve the eectiveness of a search. Term weighting schemes can be highly sensitive to the errors in the input text, introduced by the OCR process. This study examines the eects of the well known cosine normalization method in the presence of OCR errors, and proposes a new, more robust, normalization method. Experiments show that the new scheme is less sensitive to OCR errors and facilitates use of more diverse <b>basic</b> <b>weighting</b> schemes. When used in a correct text collection, the new normalization scheme yields signicant improvements in retrieval eectiveness over cosine normalization. ...|$|R
50|$|Once the {{character}} has been selected, the actual design process begins with sketches {{of the proposed}} figure. The next step {{is the creation of}} a clay prototype, but other materials such as wax can also be used for the prototype. This model is made by bending aluminum wires to form the backbone of the figure, known as an armature. The wire form includes the outline of the arms and legs posed in the general stance that the figure will assume. The sculptor then adds clay to the armature to give the <b>basic</b> <b>weight</b> and shape that is desired. The clay may be baked slightly during the prototyping process to harden it. Then, the sculptor uses various tools, such as a wire loop, to carve the clay and shape details on the figure.|$|E

50|$|The first {{full-sized}} car {{designed by}} Durand was the Atla, {{also called the}} A.T.L.A. in some references. Durand designed a small berlinette body {{to be made in}} fibreglass. The design was notable for having gullwing doors like the 300SL. The car received a tubular steel spaceframe chassis courtesy of engineer Charles Cusson. Most of the cars used a rear-engine powertrain sourced from the Renault 4CV, although at least one Atla was built with the air-cooled boxer-twin engine and transaxle from a Panhard Dyna Z in a front-engine, front-wheel-drive configuration. <b>Basic</b> <b>weight</b> for the car was just 500 kg. Financing to built a series of Atlas was provided by Renault dealer Jean Schwab, who also assigned one of his employees to help with painting and trimming the cars. The prototype was complete by 1957 and the car went into production the next year. A major price increase near the end of 1958 caused orders to come to a halt, so the Atla was only built for one year. The total number of Atlas built is estimated to have been fewer than thirty cars.|$|E
