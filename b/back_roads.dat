5|$|Homer, {{envious of}} Ned Flanders's new motor home, goes to Bob's RV Round-up {{to buy one}} of his own, but because of his poor credit rating, he is only {{qualified}} for a smaller dilapidated one, much to his family's disgust. Thrilled with the new RV, Homer takes his family on an excursion. Driving on remote <b>back</b> <b>roads</b> and ignoring Marge's suggestion to turn back on the main road, the Simpsons find themselves teetering over a precipice. The family escapes the RV before it plummets over the cliff, leaving themselves stranded in the wilderness.|$|E

5|$|Swedish and Ghanaian {{troops were}} ordered out of Kamina Air Base the {{following}} morning at 05:20. By 06:00 they were advancing down the main road towards the town of Kamina (dubbed Kamina-ville), while a detached Swedish company took <b>back</b> <b>roads</b> to the city through Kiavie. At 06:20 the company spearheading the advance came under heavy machine gun and mortar fire from the Katangese two or three kilometers northeast of Kamina and was ordered by Major Sture Fagerström to retreat 600 meters. The Swedes took cover and regrouped while Fredman organised an armoured car unit. He arrived at the front lines at 07:05 and the peacekeepers began their attack. Supported with mortars, a combat patrol advanced {{down the road and}} by 07:55 it had broken through the gendarmerie's defences. Swedish medics attended to the wounded Katangese that were left behind {{while the rest of the}} forces began entering the city.|$|E

25|$|He {{was awarded}} the {{fellowship}} and took to the <b>back</b> <b>roads</b> in the ten poorest districts of five states. It meant covering close to 100,000km across India using 16 forms of transportation, including walking 5,000km on foot. He credits two sympathetic editors at the Times with much of his success in getting the articles published in their present form, since it is one among the very newspapers that {{has been accused of}} shifting the onus from page one to page three. The paper ran 84 reports by Sainath across 18 months, many of them subsequently reprinted in his book, Everybody Loves A Good Drought.|$|E
25|$|The provincial {{government}} and police were criticised by the locals for having allowed the attack to take place, especially since police roadblocks {{on the way}} to Beslan were removed shortly before the attack. Many blamed rampant corruption that allowed the attackers to bribe their way through the checkpoints; in fact, this was even what they had openly boasted to their hostages. Others say the militants took the <b>back</b> <b>roads</b> used by smugglers in collusion with the police. Yulia Latynina alleged that Major Gurazhev was captured after he approached the militants' truck to demand a bribe for what he thought was an oil-smuggling operation. It was also alleged the federal police knew of the time and place of the planned attack; according to internal police documents obtained by Novaya Gazeta, the Moscow MVD knew about the hostage taking four hours in advance, having learned this from a militant captured in Chechnya. According to Basayev, the road to Beslan was cleared of roadblocks because the FSB planned to ambush the group later, believing the rebels' aim was to seize the parliament of North Ossetia in Vladikavkaz.|$|E

[...] Morrison described it as [...] "one of those songs {{where you can see}} {{the light at the end}} of the tunnel... I don't think I can elaborate on it any more than that." [...] The words in the song: [...] "Talkin' to Huddie Ledbetter/Showin' pictures on the wall" [...] appear to be based on Morrison's real life custom of carrying around a poster of Lead Belly and hanging it on the wall wherever he lived. (This was revealed in a Rolling Stone interview in 1978.) ...|$|E
500|$|On July 1, 1919, M-93 was a spur routing from M-18 to the [...] "State Military Camp", {{what is now}} Camp Grayling. The {{designation}} {{was extended}} in 1929 along North Down River Road, and several <b>back</b> <b>roads</b> to Bob Cat Trail and Hartwick Pines State Park. A new routing was completed in 1932 north of downtown Grayling to the park. The highway extended north of the park to County Road 612 east of Frederick at this time as well. When I-75 was completed {{in the area in}} 1963, the US27 designation was dropped, and BL I-75 was designated through town in its place. The northern end was truncated to the state park in 1968. When the park's entrance was moved in the early 1990s, the highway designation was not truncated again, and MDOT still maintains M-93 to the former park entrance at Bob Cat Trail.|$|E
500|$|On the {{afternoon}} of August 16, the eight cars of the lynch mob left Marietta separately for Milledgeville. They arrived at the prison at around 10:00p.m., and the electrician cut the telephone wires, {{members of the group}} drained the gas from the prison's automobiles, handcuffed the warden, seized Frank, and drove away. The [...] trip took about seven hours at a top speed of [...] through small towns on <b>back</b> <b>roads.</b> Lookouts in the towns telephoned ahead to the next town as soon as they saw the line of cars pass by. A site at Frey's Gin, two miles (3km) east of Marietta, had been prepared, complete with a rope and table supplied by former Sheriff William Frey. The New York Times reported Frank was handcuffed, his legs tied at the ankles, and that he was hanged from a branch of a tree at around 7:00a.m., facing the direction of the house where Phagan had lived.|$|E

500|$|In {{the second}} {{statement}} she alleged that, between July and October 1984, Bamber said {{he wished he}} could [...] "get rid of them all". He had talked disparagingly about his [...] "old" [...] father and [...] "mad" [...] mother, she said, who were trying to [...] "run his life". He said his sister had nothing to live for, and that the twins were disturbed. That his parents were paying for Sheila's expensive flat in Maida Vale annoyed him, she said. In discussions she said she had dismissed as [...] "idle talk", Bamber had talked about sedating his parents with sleeping pills, shooting them, then setting fire to the farmhouse. He reportedly said Sheila would make a good scapegoat. Mugford alleged he had discussed cycling along the <b>back</b> <b>roads</b> to the house, entering the house through the kitchen window because the catch was broken, and leaving it via a different window that latched when it was shut from the outside. A telephone call would be made from White House Farm to his home in Goldhanger [...] "because the last phone call made would be recorded". He claimed to have killed rats with his bare hands to test whether he was able to kill, but he said it had taught him {{that he would not be}} able to kill his family, although he allegedly continued to talk about doing so.|$|E
500|$|Kripke instead {{favored the}} [...] "unique and {{structurally}} interesting" [...] self-enclosed episodes, which sometimes {{arose from the}} writers' unused ideas. From the series' beginning, Kripke desired to feature an evil clown because he felt that [...] "clowns in a context where they're {{not supposed to be}} are friggin' terrifying". To fit with the series, the clown became a shapeshifting Rakshasa of Hindu mythology. This decision made the clown [...] "less satisfying", to Kripke's chagrin, because it limited the clown-related scenes. Another element of folklore favored by Kripke was the story of Robert Johnson, which he focused on in his first screenplay as a writer. He found the legend similar to Supernatural, noting, [...] "It's a piece of real life American history and folklore, it's an American horror story, it takes place on the dusty <b>back</b> <b>roads</b> of rural America, and it's got great music." [...] However, the lore takes place in the early 20th century, and prevented the inclusion of Sam and Dean. To circumvent this, writer Sera Gamble suggested Johnson's story be made into a subplot detailed in flashbacks, with the Crossroads Demon returning in the present to make more deals. Although Gamble envisioned the demon's hellhound as being similar in appearance to a Rottweiler, Kripke felt it would [...] "look stupid". The creature was instead made invisible, which Gamble believes gave it a more terrifying presence.|$|E
500|$|The {{surviving}} group regroups on {{the highway}} {{which they had been}} taking to reach Fort Benning {{at the start of the}} season, and assume Andrea is dead. With their remaining vehicles, they travel on <b>back</b> <b>roads</b> to avoid hordes, until one runs out of gas. They camp for the night, where Daryl pressures Rick on how Randall's body had reanimated without a walker bite. Rick reveals what Dr. Edwin Jenner whispered in his ear: they are all infected carriers of the walker pathogen, and become walkers if they die for any reason. Rick also reveals that he had been forced to kill Shane, and Carl had shot his reanimated form, shocking Lori. As they continue to debate, the others, save for Daryl and Hershel, start to lose their faith in Rick as a leader. A noise echoing in the distance places the group on high alert, but Rick does not allow anyone to investigate. Carol Peletier (Melissa McBride) urges Rick to take action, causing Rick to snap, saying that he never asked that he be put in charge, and blurting out that he had killed Shane for their sake. He dares anyone to leave the safety of the camp. When nobody leaves he issues a final warning: [...] "If you're staying, this isn't a democracy anymore," [...] establishing his position as leader of the group. Afterwards it is shown that the group is unknowingly camped near a prison.|$|E
