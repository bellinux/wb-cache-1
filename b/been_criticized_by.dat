5|$|Gregory {{was also}} one of the first Christian voices to say that slavery as an {{institution}} was inherently sinful. He believed that slavery violated mankind's inherent worth, and the nature of humanity to be free; a departure from classical, and Judeo-Christian precedent which he rooted in Genesis, arguing that man was given mastery of animals but not of mankind. Although aspects of the slave system had <b>been</b> <b>criticized</b> <b>by</b> Stoics such as Seneca, this was the first and only sustained critique of the institution of slavery itself made in the ancient world.|$|E
5|$|Neuro: Supernatural Detectives manga {{has been}} popular in Japan, {{frequently}} ranking {{in the weekly}} Top Ten list of best-selling manga. It has sold over four million volumes as of April 2009 in Japan. The anime, however, has <b>been</b> <b>criticized</b> <b>by</b> fans because it deviates from Matsui's work, and received a low viewership. Critics of anime and manga often compared it to Case Closed, noting supernatural themes as {{the only difference between}} them.|$|E
5|$|Over the years, {{there have}} been various small controversies, the most infamous being the scandal {{involving}} the Steinmetz High School team, which was caught cheating at the 1995 Illinois state finals.

Academic Decathlon has <b>been</b> <b>criticized</b> <b>by</b> educators {{for the amount of}} time it requires students to spend on the material, as it constitutes an entire curriculum beyond the one provided by the school.

5|$|Some {{have argued}} that the pyramids were laid out as a map of the three stars in the belt of Orion, {{although}} this theory has <b>been</b> <b>criticized</b> <b>by</b> reputable astronomers. The site was instead probably governed by a spectacular hierophany which occurs at the summer solstice, when the sun, viewed from the Sphinx terrace, forms - together with the two giant pyramids - the symbol Akhet, which was also the name of the Great Pyramid. Further, the south east corners of all the 3 pyramids align towards the temple of Heliopolis, as first discovered by the Egyptologist Mark Lehner.|$|E
5|$|Stein's {{formulation}} has <b>been</b> <b>criticized</b> <b>by</b> historian Sanjay Subrahmanyam, in part, {{on account}} of the lack of extensive historiography for the period. The 18th-century Wodeyar rulers of Mysore—in contrast to their contemporaries in Rajputana, Central India, Maratha Deccan, and Tanjavur—left little or no record of their administrations. Surveying the historiography, Subrahmanyam, says:A major problem attendant on such generalisations by modern historians concerning pre-1760 Mysore is, however, the paucity of documentation on this older 'Old Regime'.|$|E
5|$|The {{controversial}} {{study has}} met with mixed reactions since its publication. Though praised by some contemporary and modern reviewers, and once cited in a speech by Harold L.

5|$|A {{point of}} {{contention}} among scholars is {{the role played by}} Armenian clerics in that process. According to a number of scholars and medieval Armenian sources, Mesrop Mashtots, generally acknowledged as the creator of the Armenian alphabet, also created the Georgian and Caucasian Albanian alphabets. This tradition originates in the works of Koryun, a fifth century historian and biographer of Mashtots, and has been quoted by Donald Rayfield and James R. Russell, but has <b>been</b> <b>criticized</b> <b>by</b> scholars, both Georgian and Western, who judge the passage in Koryun unreliable or even a later interpolation. Other scholars quote Koryun's claims without taking a stance on its validity. Many agree, however, that Armenian clerics, if not Mashtots himself, must {{have played a role in}} the creation of the Georgian script.|$|E
5|$|D.O.-granting U.S. {{medical schools}} have {{curricula}} identical {{for the most}} part to those of M.D.-granting schools. Generally, the first two years are classroom-based, while the third and fourth years consist of clinical rotations through the major specialties of medicine. Some schools of Osteopathic Medicine have <b>been</b> <b>criticized</b> <b>by</b> the osteopathic community for relying too heavily on clinical rotations with private practitioners, who {{may not be able to}} provide sufficient instruction to the rotating student. Other D.O.-granting and M.D.-granting schools place their students in hospital-based clinical rotations where the attending physicians are faculty of the school, and who have a clear duty to teach medical students while treating patients.|$|E

The Wii release received mixed reviews, and the Windows release received generally unfavorable reviews.|$|E
