5|$|Enron {{shareholders}} filed a $40 billion lawsuit {{after the}} company's stock price, which achieved {{a high of}} US$90.75 per share in mid-2000, plummeted to less than $1 {{by the end of}} November 2001. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) began an investigation, and rival Houston competitor Dynegy offered to purchase the company at a very low price. The deal failed, and on December 2, 2001, Enron filed for <b>bankruptcy</b> under Chapter 11 of the United States <b>Bankruptcy</b> Code. Enron's $63.4 billion in assets made it the largest corporate <b>bankruptcy</b> in U.S. history until WorldCom's <b>bankruptcy</b> the next year.|$|E
5|$|Enron's European {{operations}} {{filed for}} <b>bankruptcy</b> on November 30, 2001, and it sought Chapter 11 protection {{two days later}} on December 2. It became the largest <b>bankruptcy</b> in U.S. history, surpassing the 1970 <b>bankruptcy</b> of the Penn Central (WorldCom's <b>bankruptcy</b> the next year surpassed Enron's <b>bankruptcy</b> so the title was short held), and resulted in 4,000 lost jobs. The day that Enron filed for <b>bankruptcy,</b> the employees were told to pack their belongings and were given 30 minutes to vacate the building. Nearly 62% of 15,000 employees' savings plans relied on Enron stock that was purchased at $83 in early 2001 and was now practically worthless.|$|E

But the level of farmer <b>bankruptcies</b> is not a good indicator of rural financial health. <b>Bankruptcies</b> are only a subset of all farm business exits and a lagging indicator of economic stress.

5|$|Immediately {{after the}} <b>bankruptcy,</b> Rail Management {{established}} a new company, Ofotbanen Drift AS, {{to take over}} the estate in <b>bankruptcy.</b> They also stated that the cause of the <b>bankruptcy</b> was that Autolink had not let them make a private placement of NOK 10 million. The new company received an operation and safety licence from the inspectorate in January 2009, and plans to start operation again in February. On 9 April 2010, the Norwegian Railway Inspectorate withdrew Ofotbanen's operating certificate because it was not economically sound to operate. The company filed for <b>bankruptcy</b> in May, after the Norwegian Tax Administration could not claim NOK700,000 in due taxes.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, Warren {{was asked}} to advise the National <b>Bankruptcy</b> Review Commission. She helped to draft the commission's report and worked for several years to oppose {{legislation}} intended to severely restrict the right of consumers to file for <b>bankruptcy.</b> Warren and others opposing the legislation were not successful; in 2005 Congress passed the <b>Bankruptcy</b> Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, which curtailed the ability of consumers to file for <b>bankruptcy.</b>|$|E
5|$|Moran's {{support for}} harsher <b>bankruptcy</b> law {{provisions}} and sponsorship of stricter <b>bankruptcy</b> legislation brought allegations in 2002 that his support came {{in return for}} financial favors by financial institutions which could benefit from such laws. In January 1998, one month before he introduced the legislation, credit card bank MBNA advocated that it would restrict the ability of consumer debtors to declare <b>bankruptcy.</b> Moran received a $447,000 debt consolidation loan at over 10% interest rate.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} Finnish <b>bankruptcies.</b> It shows that <b>bankruptcies</b> are {{strongly}} related to the business cycle {{and that they are}} perhaps even more {{strongly related to}} indebtedness, real interest rates and asset prices. The importance of these financial factors probably increased when the financial markets were liberalized in the early 1980 s. Although {{there is a lot of}} seasonal and cyclical variation in <b>bankruptcies</b> the long run level (especially when adjusted to the number of firms) is almost constant representing some sort of "a natural rate of bankruptcies". What makes <b>bankruptcies</b> so important is the fact that they directly affect production, employment and credit expansion.

Empirical work based on data from both the USA and the UK finds a significant Granger causality relationship between <b>bankruptcies</b> and births and these four macroeconomic variables. The standard Granger causality regression is supplemented by non-linear Granger causality tests. ...|$|R

Mark Vogel loaned the track $350,000 and offered to buy the track, but a <b>bankruptcy</b> court judge refused to approve the plan.
