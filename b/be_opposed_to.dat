5|$|Later in June, Johnson and Stanton battled {{over the}} {{question}} of whether the military officers placed in command of the South could override the civil authorities. The President had Attorney General Henry Stanbery issue an opinion backing his position that they could not. Johnson sought to pin down Stanton either as for, and thus endorsing Johnson's position, or against, showing himself to <b>be</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> his president and the rest of the Cabinet. Stanton evaded the point in meetings and written communications.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland {{agreed with}} Blount's report, which found the populace to <b>be</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> annexation. Liliuokalani {{initially}} refused to grant amnesty {{as a condition}} of her reinstatement, saying that she would either execute or banish the current government in Honolulu, but Dole's government refused to yield their position. By December 1893, the matter was still unresolved, and Cleveland referred the issue to Congress. In his message to Congress, Cleveland rejected the idea of annexation and encouraged the Congress to continue the American tradition of non-intervention (see excerpt at right). The Senate, under Democratic control but opposed to Cleveland, commissioned and produced the Morgan Report, which contradicted Blount's findings and found the overthrow was a completely internal affair. Cleveland dropped all talk of reinstating the Queen, and went on to recognize and maintain diplomatic relations with the new Republic of Hawaii.|$|E

25|$|The 1950s brought {{important}} changes. Zalaegerszeg got a more industrial profile {{with the}} construction of the textile factory and the discovery of oil resources in 1952. The railway line was expanded, too. Lots of workers were commuting from the nearby villages, because it was almost impossible to find a flat in the city, so several residents of Zalaegerszeg (mostly those who were considered to <b>be</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> the Socialist system) were forced to relocate.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, in Rossio, after Paiva de Couceiro's {{departure}} {{with the}} battery, {{the morale of}} the monarchical troops, which considered themselves helpless, deteriorated even more due to the threats of bombardment by the naval forces.

Public opinion steadily turned against the war following 1967, and by 1970 only a third of Americans believed that the U.S. had not made a mistake by sending troops to fight in Vietnam. During the late-1960s opponents of the war turned to teach-ins and street protests, such as those at the 1968 Democratic National Convention and the 1969 Vietnam Moratorium, in an effort to turn U.S. political opinion.|$|E
25|$|At {{their general}} {{assembly}} on 23 January 1983, Askøy Commuter Association unanimously supported the advanced tolls. Bech-Sørensen {{stated that the}} commuter has been betrayed by their own organization and proposed that a new commuter association be established which would <b>be</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> the advanced tolls. This resulted in a petition being established against the advanced tolls, which gradually was formalized as the Action Against Advanced Tolls (AMF). Representatives for the movement stated that no parties had had advanced tolls in their party programs in the previous election, and that a referendum had been rejected by the council, and the people thus {{had not had a}} possibility to influence the issue.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to his high profile in government, Bassett was a devout and energetic convert to Methodism. Having met Francis Asbury in 1778 {{at the home of}} their mutual friend, Judge Thomas White, Bassett soon had a conversion experience, and for the remainder of his life devoted much of his attention and wealth to the promotion of Methodism. He and Asbury remained lifelong friends. This association caused him to become linked in many people’s minds to the loyalists, as both White and Asbury were viewed to <b>be</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> the war. But it also led to a strong abolitionist belief, which led him to free his own slaves and advocate the emancipation of others.|$|E

25|$|As President Bush's AIDS Coordinator, Tobias was {{responsible}} for setting policy detailing which countries would receive monies from various US agencies, how much, and what the rules governing assignment of those funds would be. As AIDS Coordinator, he discussed the rules {{in an interview with}} PBS' Frontline where he detailed a legal requirement that recipients of U.S. aid denounce prostitution:The Congress I think very appropriately has put into the legislation that created this program that organizations, in order to receive money, need to have a policy opposed to prostitution and sex trafficking. I don't think it's too difficult for people to <b>be</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> prostitution and sex trafficking, which are in fact two contributing causes to the spread of HIV/AIDS. I think when organizations initially became aware of that requirement, some organizations were concerned about what the implications of that might be, but we implemented that in the first year with non-U.S. organizations. We're now implementing that requirement with U.S. organizations. And so far, I really know of no problems that we've had on the ground.|$|E
25|$|Although not all Afrikander Bond leaders liked Kruger, {{they were}} ready to support him whether or not he granted reforms and, by the same result, {{contrived}} to make Milner's position untenable. His difficulties were increased when, at the general election in Cape Colony, the Bond obtained a majority. In October 1898, acting strictly in a constitutional manner, Milner called upon William Philip Schreiner to form a ministry, though aware that such a ministry would <b>be</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> any direct intervention of Great Britain in the Transvaal. Convinced that the existing state of affairs, if continued, would end in the loss of South Africa by Britain, Milner visited England in November 1898. He returned to Cape Colony in February 1899, fully assured of Joseph Chamberlain's support, though the government still clung to the hope that the moderate section of the Cape and Orange Free State Dutch would induce Kruger to give the vote to the Uitlanders. He found the situation more critical than when he had left, ten weeks previously. Johannesburg was in a ferment, while William Francis Butler, who acted as high commissioner in Milner's absence, had allowed the inference that he did not support Uitlander grievances.|$|E

500|$|... "Ron and Tammy" [...] {{was written}} by Mike Scully and {{directed}} by Troy Miller. The episode featured comedian and actress Megan Mullally in a guest appearance as Ron's ex-wife, Tammy. Mullally is the real-life wife of Nick Offerman, who plays Ron. Parks and Recreation co-creator Michael Schur conceived {{the idea for the}} story, and asked Offerman whether he and Mullally would <b>be</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> her playing such a terrible character. Offerman was extremely responsive to the idea. Mullally said she enjoyed the script, particularly the dialogue of Ron describing Tammy, more than Tammy's part herself. Offerman and Mullally improvised many of their on-screen fights, as well as the varied methods of unusual kissing between the two characters. During the diner scene, in which Ron and Tammy switch between violent fighting and passionate kissing, Offerman accidentally pulled a diner table out of the wall after placing Mullally on top of it and kissing her. The scene was used in the final episode. Offerman said of filming the diner scenes, [...] "At the end of doing that for a few hours, we said, you know that feels like it was five weeks worth of really good therapy." ...|$|E

500|$|By 1989, the Soviet {{alliance}} {{system was}} on the brink of collapse, and, deprived of Soviet military support, the communist leaders of the Warsaw Pact states were losing power. [...] Grassroots organizations, such as Poland's Solidarity movement, rapidly gained ground with strong popular bases. In 1989, the communist governments in Poland and Hungary became the first to negotiate the organizing of competitive elections. In Czechoslovakia and East Germany, mass protests unseated entrenched communist leaders. The communist regimes in Bulgaria and Romania also crumbled, in the latter case {{as the result of a}} violent uprising. Attitudes had changed enough that US Secretary of State James Baker suggested that the American government would not <b>be</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> Soviet intervention in Romania, on behalf of the opposition, to prevent bloodshed. The tidal wave of change culminated with the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989, which symbolized the collapse of European communist governments and graphically ended the Iron Curtain divide of Europe. The 1989 revolutionary wave swept across Central and Eastern Europe and peacefully overthrew all of the Soviet-style communist states: East Germany, Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria; Romania was the only Eastern-bloc country to topple its communist regime violently and execute its head of state.|$|E
500|$|Wood (2006) has {{maintained}} that Adams' political philosophy had become irrelevant {{by the time}} the Federal Constitution was ratified. By then, American political thought, transformed by {{more than a decade of}} vigorous debate as well as formative experiential pressures, had abandoned the classical perception of politics as a mirror of social estates. Americans' new understanding of popular sovereignty was that the citizenry were the sole possessors of power in the nation. Representatives in the government enjoyed mere portions of the people's power and only for a limited time. Adams was thought to have overlooked this evolution and revealed his continued attachment to the older version of politics. Yet Wood ignored Adams' peculiar definition of the term [...] "republic," [...] and his support for a constitution ratified by the people. He also underestimated Adams' belief in checks and balances, such as Adams' statement that, [...] "Power must <b>be</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> power, and interest to interest." [...] This sentiment was later echoed by James Madison's famous statement that, [...] "mbition must be made to counteract ambition", in The Federalist No. 51, explaining the separation of powers established under the new Constitution. Adams was unsurpassed in his dedication to establishing checks and balances as a governing strategem.|$|E

In regard to the grievance [...] "He has taken from her all right in property, even to the wages she earns," [...] Assemblyman Ansel Bascom stood {{to say that he}} had recently been at the New York State Assembly which passed the Married Woman's Property Act. Bascom spoke at length about the property rights it secured for married women, including property acquired after marriage. Further discussion of the Declaration ensued, including comments by Frederick Douglass, Thomas and Mary Ann M'Clintock, and Amy Post; the document was adopted unanimously. The question of men's signatures was solved by having two sections of signatures, one for women followed by one for men. One hundred of the 300 present signed the Declaration of Sentiments, including 68 women and 32 men. Amelia Bloomer was one of the participants who did not endorse the Declaration; she was focused at that time on the temperance movement. Ansel Bascom was the most conspicuous attendee who chose not to sign the Declaration. The National Reformer reported that those in the audience who evidently regarded the Declaration as [...] "too bold and ultra", including the lawyers known to <b>be</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> the equal rights of women, [...] "failed to call out any opposition, except in a neighboring BAR-ROOM." ...|$|E
