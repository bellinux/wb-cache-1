25|$|Set {{off from}} the main {{building}} by approximately 13 metres to the north-west and south-east are two wide butterfly-roofed, steel-framed shelters with built-in seating that faces both tracks. Four steel T-shaped components support steel perforated purlins, which inturn support the corrugated metal roof sheeting. The former divide the seating lengths. Set about {{four and a half}} metres apart, they are made with two cantilevered, tapering I-beams bolted to a rectangular hollow steel column (made with two C-sections welded together) which is founded in a concrete upstand. A perpendicular upstand runs the length of the shelter along the midline. Welded to the steel columns and beams are lighter steel frames. The infill panels of glass have been removed, as have some of the steel ones, while others are corroded. The seating is made with painted timber slats supported on timber studs and some steel framing. The downpipes taking water from the <b>box</b> <b>gutter</b> continue the rhythm of the columns, piercing the timber caps that join the two sides of seating at the centre of each gap.|$|E

50|$|Side {{elevations}} {{finished in}} face brickwork terminate as parapets {{to conceal the}} corrugated iron gabled roof and <b>box</b> <b>gutters</b> behind. The right hand (east) wall has original window openings at first floor level.|$|R
50|$|There is a {{hipped roof}} {{on the central}} brick core, with inward sloping skillion roofs on each side wing that drain to <b>box</b> <b>gutters</b> fixed to the brick walls, and a skillion roof to the rear extension.|$|R
50|$|Low-pitched {{corrugated}} iron roofs are {{hidden from view}} behind brick parapet walls. Rainwater, collected in concealed <b>box</b> <b>gutters,</b> is discharged through the parapet walls into painted metal rainwater heads and downpipes. Metal ladders bolted to external walls provide access to the roofs.|$|R
50|$|The former Harbour Board building, a two-storeyed {{rendered}} masonry structure, {{is located}} fronting Quay Street {{to the northeast}} overlooking the Fitzroy River. The building has a twin gable roof, the front section of which is hipped with central <b>box</b> <b>gutter</b> draining to the rear.|$|E
50|$|The stone {{core and}} western brick {{extension}} have separately framed hip roofs clad in painted corrugated iron. A <b>box</b> <b>gutter</b> runs {{between the two}} main roofs. A rendered masonry chimney emerges from both roofs. The chimney on the stone core is larger, having multiple flues.|$|E
50|$|A <b>box</b> <b>gutter,</b> {{parallel}} gutter, or trough gutter is a {{rain gutter}} on a roof usually rectangular in shape; {{it may be}} lined with EPDM rubber, metal, asphalt, or roofing felt, and may be concealed behind a parapet or the eaves, or in a roof valley.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} is sheltered by a gabled roof {{hidden from view}} behind the pediment. The roof is timber-framed and clad with corrugated metal sheeting and rests within parapet walls on all four sides. <b>Box</b> <b>gutters</b> drain to two rainwater heads {{at each end of}} the northern elevation. A masonry chimney with moulded cornice rises through the roof on the eastern side of the building.|$|R
50|$|The roof of {{the house}} has been amalgamated and {{extended}} over time. Once a pair of simple hip roofs surrounded by lower pitched verandah roofs, various extensions and alterations have created a complex roofscape of interlocking hipped roofs with <b>box</b> <b>gutters,</b> valleys and ridges. The roof is modest in scale and appearance due to the relatively low pitches used and {{the small size of}} the original elements.|$|R
50|$|The {{main roof}} is hipped {{and covered with}} painted {{corrugated}} iron. This has been continued over the masonry extension to the south. There are four roof ventilators conspicuously ranged {{along the line of}} the ridge. The verandahs are bull nose. Where the courtyard has been enclosed the roof is in separate sections linked together with <b>box</b> <b>gutters.</b> At the rear the veranda roof, although enclosed is still legible and consists of convex curved corrugated iron.|$|R
50|$|The {{house itself}} is a two-story, seven-by-two-bay house of {{limestone}} in rough courses with a metal-clad gabled roof pierced by two brick chimneys near either end. The roofline has a <b>box</b> <b>gutter,</b> modillions and simple frieze, all done in wood. A smaller stone wing extends from the south, and a two-story frame wing is on the rear.|$|E
50|$|Normanby Station {{is located}} on an eastern slope {{overlooking}} Warroolaba Creek and is accessed from the west via a driveway {{from the town of}} Warril View. The single-storeyed chamferboard building has a double hipped corrugated iron roof with a central <b>box</b> <b>gutter</b> and is encircled by a skillion roofed verandah. The building has a concrete block and stump base with brick steps.|$|E
50|$|It is {{constructed}} {{of a local}} sandstone, possibly from Woogaroo Quarry with brick walls internally. The form of construction is rare, incorporating timber tie beams at lintel level through the stone work. The framing for the original double hipped roof including the <b>box</b> <b>gutter</b> and some battening for slates, remains under the current roof which is single hipped and is clad with corrugated iron.|$|E
50|$|An area of {{a similar}} size {{to the west of}} the {{southeast}} section is independently roofed with similar triple hip roofs with <b>box</b> <b>gutters</b> and skylights. The first floor in this area has a boarded timber ceiling which rakes up around the skylights. A further area to the west retains, on the ground floor, the original columns and pressed metal ceiling in a wide variety of patterns and has a diagonal boarded ceiling on the first floor.|$|R
50|$|<b>Box</b> <b>gutters</b> are {{essentially}} placed between parallel surfaces, as {{in a valley}} between parallel roofs or at the junction of a roof and a parapet wall. They {{should not be confused}} with so-called valley gutters or valley flashings which occur at the non-parallel intersection of roof surfaces, typically at right angled internal corners of pitched roofs. Provision is made in the design of the gutter to have a rain flow to the outlet with a maximum slope of 1:200 and a minimum of 1:400.|$|R
50|$|The Mossman Shire Hall, {{with its}} drop screen, stage and {{orchestra}} pit and dressing rooms, was subsequently {{used for a}} range of community events and functions. In 1938, alterations and additions were made by Hill & Taylor. These included: extending the awning to the pavement from the hall, a new area for storing chairs on the northern side of the building, new kitchen facilities in the commercial premises, and renewing flashing and <b>box</b> <b>guttering</b> on the southern side of building. During World War II, the hall was used by troops as a dance hall.|$|R
50|$|Access is {{achieved}} through three large sliding doors {{on each side}} with an additional door on the interior Showground end. The original decorative facade with parapet end, providing street access (Ingham Road) has been modified to a flat sheeted wall. Internally there is a central row of columns supporting timber trusses and a <b>box</b> <b>gutter.</b> Hardwood tongue and groove flooring is laid throughout and supported on timber framing on top of concrete piers.|$|E
50|$|The railway {{platform}} has tall sash windows, {{some of which}} have been painted out, and timber panelled doors with fanlights open from the adjoining offices and service rooms. Rainwater heads, draining the <b>box</b> <b>gutter</b> between the station building and the carriage shade, protrude into the platform area, with the downpipe inset into the station building wall. The signal box protrudes from the station building on a raised concrete base, and has sliding multi-paned windows to three sides.|$|E
50|$|The Fulton House is a {{modified}} {{example of the}} International style in the materials, detailing and asymmetrical massing. It is a two-storey buff-coloured brick house with contrasting red brick to the lower levels and a terra cotta tiled roof. A large <b>box</b> <b>gutter</b> is concealed behind a deep fascia board and this combined with the horizontal raked joints and the concrete balcony and steel balustrade serves to emphasise the horizontal lines. The chimney is built in a red brick emphasising the vertical line.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} part of {{the house}} is the kitchen wing at the rear which is constructed of red bricks. The rear verandah is partially enclosed and lined with plasterboard and now operates as a laundry. Fireplaces and brick ovens remain on either side of a wall which divides the space into two rooms. This section is connected to the principal building by enclosed verandahs. An early verandah post below <b>box</b> <b>guttering</b> remains in this room, as do a series of bells, mounted on what would have been an external wall.|$|R

50|$|The {{house is}} a post-Regency style cottage and has an {{asymmetrical}} floor-plan. It has the low lines and broad proportions of early colonial dwellings. The front elevation describes three stages of building. The original section of the house, which has six rooms, has a Georgian facade with a central front door and French doors to either side. The front verandah which is supported by cast iron columns and is flanked by later editions of Italianate style. The slate hipped roof has metal ridge capping and <b>box</b> <b>gutters.</b> The walls are cement rendered brick ashlar with sandstone lime rendered ashlar coursing.|$|R
50|$|When The Crystal Palace was {{designed}} in 1851 by Joseph Paxton with its innovative ridge-and-furrow roof, the rafters than spanned {{the space between}} the roof girders of the glass roof also served as the gutters. The wooden Paxton gutters had a deep semi-circular channel to remove the rainwater and grooves at the side to handle the condensation. They were under trussed with an iron plate and had preformed notches for the glazing bars: they drained into a wooden <b>box</b> <b>gutter</b> that drained into and through structural cast iron columns.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} has a simple rectangular plan, with kitchen wing extension {{on the rear}} and a verandah on the eastern, entrance facade. The corrugated iron gabled roof runs north south, and is partially concealed by a moulded stone parapet on the eastern facade, behind which is a <b>box</b> <b>gutter.</b> Stone chimney shafts extend from {{the apex of the}} stone capped gable ends on the north and south elevations. The sandstone blocks used in the construction of Pringle Cottage are generally coursed rubble, with picked faces. The cottage sits on a plinth of margined rock faced sandstone.|$|E
50|$|The {{main section}} of the {{building}} has twin corrugated iron hipped roofs with a central <b>box</b> <b>gutter</b> and is surrounded by verandahs with skillion roofs. The two wings have corrugated iron broken hipped roofs with verandahs to the courtyard. A chamferboard schoolroom with a corrugated iron gambrel roof {{is attached to the}} north end of the servants wing and a chamferboard bedroom wing with a corrugated iron gable roof is attached to the southeast corner of the main house. The building sits on timber stumps and has a windmill pump in the centre of the courtyard and an arched entrance gate.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} is constructed {{of a light}} coloured brick in stretcher bond and the solid, monumental, asymmetrical massing of the exterior form follows its internal function. A wide L-shaped entrance stair toward {{the western end of}} the {{building is}} concealed from view from Fernberg Road by a large solid balustrade with concrete capping. This leads to the entrance foyer which is located asymmetrically within a volume that projects forward toward the street and above the adjacent western stairwell and north facing corridor that gives access to the rooms on all three levels. Each of the volumes has low pitched metal roofs which are drained by <b>box</b> <b>gutters</b> to rainwater heads and downpipes that are concealed behind the parapet walls.|$|R
25|$|Minor {{improvements}} to Woodland Cemetery {{were made in}} {{the last decade of the}} 19th century. In 1888, a small wooden, enclosed pavilion was erected on the ground to provide employees with a place to eat and store tools. A fence was erected around the cemetery's stoneyard to screen it from view, a stone path was built from the Woodland Avenue gatehouse to the chapel, and all walks were cindered. The central water main was replaced, and a public drinking fountain added near the chapel. The chapel's receiving vault was updated to accommodate a trend toward larger caskets, <b>box</b> <b>gutters</b> were installed throughout the cemetery to replace ditch gutters, and the two gatekeeper's houses and the foreman's house were both repaired and refurbished. In 1889, the chapel was connected to the water main for the first time. Due to limited burial space, two grassy areas around the chapel were converted into burial plots.|$|R
50|$|From the 1950s, various renovations and {{modifications}} {{were carried}} out on the Graceville Methodist Church. In 1955 repairs were needed to the church floor and to the roof, and in November 1956 the vestry roof and floor of the tower were resurfaced. A new concrete sump was placed under the church and an automatic electric pump to remove water from the sump was installed. A 1957 report by architects Cook and Kerrison, found the church in serious need of repair. It was agreed to allow Cook and Kerrison to proceed with preparing specifications for renewing the floor and <b>box</b> <b>guttering.</b> The trustees approved that the new church floor should be concrete with a suitable covering. The £1972 tender of A. L. Paice was accepted. To complete the work, the existing pulpit and communion rail were removed and later re-installed to one side. In 1958 a new septic toilet block was constructed and a new memorial window was unveiled in the church. A new organ was donated in 1959. The interior of the church was also repainted by Ash and Nephew, and Brisbane Lead Light Service repaired and installed various windows. In 1960 new stairs from the Minister's Vestry to the choir stalls were constructed, and in 1962 a new pulpit chair was installed.|$|R
5000|$|Among the {{contents}} were goods {{owned by the}} first and second appellants, which had been stored in terms of oral contracts of deposit. The main section of the store containing the cold rooms was steel-framed and roofed with two pitches of fibre cement separated by a fibreglass <b>box</b> <b>gutter.</b> The roof was insulated with panels of expanded polystyrene sheathed in aluminium. The cold rooms themselves were constructed of similar panels, although both the polystyrene core and aluminium cladding were thicker. The roof sheets were non-combustible, but the fibreglass guttering, though requiring a [...] "fairly substantial heat source" [...] to ignite, was combustible, as was the polystyrene core of the insulation panels, although the aluminium cladding would provide some initial protection.|$|E
50|$|This {{single-storeyed}} building, L-shaped in plan, has a twin hipped {{corrugated iron}} roof {{with a central}} <b>box</b> <b>gutter,</b> hipped projecting bays, a gable pediment to the south entrance and a central curved roof section to the northwest wing. The building is encircled by verandahs with lower skillion roofs, fluted square timber verandah posts and timber floors. The south elevation is symmetrical, and the entrance pediment, the central section of which is glazed in leadlight with the inscription VACY HALL, is supported by two large, rendered, square fluted columns framing concrete steps. Step out bays with sash windows and shutters open onto south, west and east verandahs from principal rooms. The panelled entrance door has a fanlight and sidelights with leadlight glazing.|$|E
5000|$|The building's {{corrugated}} iron roof has a [...] "U" [...] shaped hipped configuration, which {{is worthy of}} note. While giving the perception of symmetry when viewed from the street, this type of roof was often constructed {{in order to reduce}} the height of the roof. Builders usually employed the technique where poor quality or undersize timber framing was not readily available, even though the original architects plans may have been for another style of roof. As evidenced by this building, the configuration created a central <b>box</b> <b>gutter</b> (in the valley of the roof) that was prone to flooding, placing increased pressure upon the internal structure of the building. A central supporting wall, forming part of the hallway of the upper level, supports the increased load.|$|E
5000|$|The Main Wing is a long, narrow, {{symmetrical}} {{building of}} timber-framed construction with external parapet walls formed in reinforced concrete. It {{has a large}} hipped roof clad in corrugated metal sheeting with gablets at each end. The concrete walls are finished with a smooth render painted white and are punctuated {{with a series of}} arched windows to an enclosed verandah space. These frame a larger arched central entranceway. The building is raised off the ground and supported on concrete stumps. The external concrete walls extend down to the ground and are finished with a concrete plinth running around the base of building. A suspended concrete-formed ramp runs across the front of the building leading to a secondary entrance at the southern end. The arched entranceway is trimmed in red/ochre-coloured paint and is accessed via concrete formed splayed steps. The words [...] "MOSSMAN DISTRICT HOSPITAL" [...] is lettered above the opening. <b>Box</b> <b>gutters</b> run behind the length of the parapet wall and large painted metal rain heads are located at the southern and northern ends. Decorative features include brackets located between the windows and the top of the parapet wall, a circular Maltese cross motif pressed into the walls below each of the windows, and scalloped edging and a circular motif above the entranceway.|$|R
50|$|In 1983, {{the pool}} area {{underwent}} renovation. This work included {{the replacement of}} the circulation pipe work, the plant room and water treatment plant, the concrete concourses around the pool and the substitution of skimmer <b>boxes</b> for scum <b>gutters.</b> More recently, the pools have been lined with fibreglass and fibreglass features {{have been added to the}} children's pool.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} Swaylands house, a villa (below), {{was built}} from around 1837 for William Woodgate. <b>Guttering</b> <b>boxes</b> {{on the original}} villa are marked [...] "1842", which indicates the date the house was likely completed. When William Woodgate built this three gabled villa {{on the top of}} the hill, it was described as a smaller version of his birthplace, Somerhill House, in Tonbridge. In 1842 William’s aunt recorded in her diary “William Woodgate brought his family to his new house, the bells gave a merry peal as they passed through the village.” He arrived with his wife Harriet and children (of which there were eventually 12).|$|R
