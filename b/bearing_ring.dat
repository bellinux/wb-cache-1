5000|$|In 1986 Oliver Saari {{was awarded}} a patent for a <b>bearing</b> <b>ring</b> roller screw, {{commonly}} referred to by its trademark, Spiracon. [...] This type matches the orbit of the rollers to {{the rotation of the}} nut assembly. The actuator contains more load transfer elements than the other types, a <b>bearing</b> <b>ring</b> and thrust bearings, but manufacture of component parts is relatively simple (e.g. gearing teeth may be eliminated).|$|E
5000|$|Timothy A. Erhart {{was awarded}} a US patent in 1996 for a linear {{actuator}} effectively incorporating an inverted <b>bearing</b> <b>ring</b> roller screw. [...] The screw shaft is grooved the length of and to match the grooved rollers, which travel with the shaft. The <b>bearing</b> <b>ring</b> is elongated and internally threaded {{for the length of}} screw shaft travel. The nut assembly housing and sealed end ring forms the exterior of the actuator assembly.|$|E
50|$|The screw has a multi-start thread. The rollers and {{encapsulating}} {{rotating ring}} are identically grooved, not threaded, {{so there is}} no axial movement between the two. The nut assembly includes a cylindrical housing capped by non-rotating spacer rings. The spacer rings have equidistant holes that act as rotary bearings for the smooth pivot ends (studs) of the rollers. Roller-type thrust bearings between the spacer rings and <b>bearing</b> <b>ring</b> permit free rotation of the <b>bearing</b> <b>ring</b> while transferring the axial load between the two.|$|E

50|$|The rollers {{act as the}} “threads” of the nut assembly, causing axial {{movement}} of the rotating screw due to their orbital restraint. Screw rotation spins the rollers, which spin the <b>bearing</b> <b>ring,</b> dissipating the load-induced friction along the way.|$|E

50|$|Many detail {{changes were}} made over the years, and a major change from JAP petrol engines to Lister's own diesel engines. The <b>bearing</b> <b>ring</b> was moved above the chassis members and no longer enclosed. This gave better access for {{greasing}} and adjusting the rollers.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the other}} roller screw types above, loads are {{transferred}} from the nut through the rollers to the screw (or in the reverse order). In this type of actuator, thrust bearings and a freely rotating internally grooved <b>bearing</b> <b>ring</b> transfer loads between the rollers and the nut.|$|E
50|$|Late {{vehicles}} had diesel engines, the Lister {{single cylinder}} LD1 or twin cylinder LD2 engines of 3.5 or 7 bhp @ 1800 rpm. The LD engines were already shrouded around their flywheel, cooling fan and the cylinder head fins {{and so there}} was no longer any need for the distinctive Auto-Truck engine cover or front plate. These late machines also used leaf spring front suspension, where the <b>bearing</b> <b>ring</b> was supported on the engine group by a pair of leaf springs. This gave much better isolation between front wheel bumps and the chassis, but the high unsprung weight, a drawback for all monowheel tractors, meant that they were still not high speed or effective road vehicles. By the mid 1950s, all production was diesel engined.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Residual {{stresses}} are {{the sources}} of the typical deformation failures of <b>bearing</b> <b>rings</b> called “ovality”. An innovative X-ray diffractometer was used to measure the tangential residual stress state of <b>bearing</b> <b>rings</b> after the different manufacturing steps. The measurement requires no sample cutting, thus, the stress state of the same rings were measured. This way the evolution of the stress states of the same rings was possible to follow through their processing steps. It was shown that the residual stress state of the rings varied in a wide range from compressive to tensile stresses. It was also found that surface carburisation occurred at some positions on the circumference of some of the rings during heat treatment. The composition change resulted in a non-uniform stress distribution...|$|R

According to the special requirement of high reliability, long life of wind power bearing, the current manufacturing defects {{of it has been}} analyzed, such as flange, pits, fish-tail, folding, and comparing with its current manufacturing method, which is called ring rolling, therefore, a new method called rolling and bulging-matching techniques is proposed, as wind power <b>bearing</b> <b>ring</b> should be released stress after rolling, then sized through bulging and once again to stress. Ring bulging is still a blank space in China; this project plans to research bulging process kinematics and dynamics analysis first.

40|$|Machining induced {{residual}} stress states {{contribute to the}} distortion of machined components during heat treatments. Thus, ideally a complete characterization of the components {{residual stress}} state is required. Magnetic and micromagnetic analysis of residual stresses can represent an important gain of time if compared to X-ray diffraction. Another important advantage is the access of inner faces of components like ball <b>bearing</b> <b>rings.</b> This study presents a comparison of these two methods for the characterization of outer and inner surfaces of ball <b>bearing</b> <b>rings.</b> A good calibration of micromagnetic measurements with X-ray diffraction data is necessary. Reliable results then can be achieved and the residual stress states of rings can be characterized.
