Also, the practical safety coefficient of some wells {{is lower than}} the design standard according to the current API 5 C 3 standard, which brings some perplexity to the design. The ISO 10400 : 2007 provides the model which can calculate the <b>burst</b> <b>strength</b> of tubing and casing better than API 5 C 3 standard, but the calculation accuracy is not desirable because about 50 percent predictive values are remarkably higher than real burst values.

The required bottle performance criteria vary with its application but typically include top-load strength, <b>burst</b> <b>strength,</b> optical clarity, thermal stability, and barrier properties. An experimental study of the preform reheat temperature was carried out for a 1. 5 -l PET bottle produced by a two-stage ISBM machine. The overall temperature of the preform was changed by controlling the reheat temperature of the preform; all the other process variables and preform dimensions were kept constant. Performance of the PET bottles for differing preform reheat temperatures was measured experimentally in terms of top-load strength, burst pressure resistance, environmental stress cracking resistance (ESCR), and thermal stability.

The following results have been obtained from our experiments. 	(1) The <b>bursting</b> <b>strengths</b> of warp knitted fabrics made of same material are subject to the densities of fabrics and the toughness of underlap yarns. As the differences of underlap lengths are very little among warp knitted fabrics with same weave and various densities, the <b>bursting</b> <b>strengths</b> of such fabrics are mostly determined by their densities. As the density of the fabric is increased, the <b>bursting</b> <b>strength</b> is greatly increased within certain limits of smaller density, and then with the gradually diminishing rate of increase. But the <b>bursting</b> <b>strength</b> does not noticcably increase beyond a certain limit of density. 	(2) The <b>bursting</b> <b>strengths</b> of warp knitted fabrics with same density and various weaves are determined by their underlap lengths and the numbers of the crossing of underlap with loop. The <b>bursting</b> <b>strengths</b> of the same density fabrics are increased with the underlap length of the fabric. 	(3) The absorbability of warp knitted fabrics made of same material is determined by the porosity of yarn itself and the inclined porosity between each crossing yarn in unit areas of the fabrics. In case of fabrics knitted with same density, both the total amount of water absorbed (a) and the rate of absorption of water (b) are increased with the increase of the density of the fabric. 	(4) Among same density fabrics, the values of (a) and (b) of the fabric are increased as the underlap length is increased, the increase being especially great in the value of (b) in course direction.

Between the electrospun layers of each double-layered prosthetic, zero, one or two 6 - 0 sutures were wound, maintaining 1 mm spacing with a pitch of 9 degrees.

In 17 healthy subjects, the ABR control over MSNA (burst incidence, <b>burst</b> <b>strength</b> and total MSNA) was evaluated by analysing the relationship between beat-to-beat spontaneous variations in diastolic blood pressure (DAP) and MSNA during supine rest (control) and during progressive, stepwise increases in lower body negative pressure (LBNP) that were incremented by − 10 mmHg every 5 min until presyncope (nine subjects) or − 60 mmHg was reached. (1) The linear relationships between DAP and <b>burst</b> <b>strength</b> and between DAP and total MSNA were shifted progressively upward as LBNP increased until the level at which syncope occurred. The relationship between DAP and burst incidence, however, gradually shifted upward from control only to LBNP = − 30 mmHg; there was no further upward shift at higher LBNPs. (2) Although the slope of the relationship between DAP and <b>burst</b> <b>strength</b> and between DAP and total MSNA remained constant at all LBNPs tested, except at the level where syncope occurred, the slope of the relationship between DAP and burst incidence was reduced at LBNPs of − 40 mmHg and higher (versus control). (3) In syncopal subjects, the slopes of the relationships between DAP and burst incidence, <b>burst</b> <b>strength,</b> and total MSNA were all substantially reduced during the 1 – 2 min period prior to the onset of syncope.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Composite Overwrapped Pressure Vessels (COPVs) are {{frequently}} used for storing pressurized gases aboard spacecraft and aircraft when weight saving is desirable compared to all-metal versions. Failure mechanisms in fibrous COPVs and variability in lifetime {{can be very}} different from their metallic counterparts; in the former, catastrophic stress-rupture can occur with virtually no warning, whereas in the latter, a ‘leak before burst ’ design philosophy can be implemented. Qualification and certification typically requires only one burst test on a production sample (possibly after several pressure cycles) and the vessel need only meet a ‘design <b>burst</b> <b>strength</b> ’ (the maximum operating pressure divided by a ‘knockdown ’ factor). Typically there is no requirement to assess variability in <b>burst</b> <b>strength</b> or lifetime, much less determine production and materials processing parameters important to control of such variability. Characterizing such variability and its source is crucial to models for calculating required reliability over a given lifetime (e. g. R = 0. 9999 for 15 years). In this paper we present a case study of how lack of control of certain process parameters in COPV manufacturing can result in variations among vessels and between production runs that can greatly increase uncertainty and reduce reliability.
