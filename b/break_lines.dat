But as θ approaches 90°, the curvature transforms into a saddle shape. Understanding this, then, the team could carefully control {{the effects of}} anisotropy and <b>break</b> <b>lines</b> of symmetry to create helicoids, ruffled profiles, and more.David Correa et al. is working with wood composite materials that change shape based on their printed grain direction and anisotropic swelling when water is absorbed. This work is 3D printed and studied on the macro scale rather than micro scale, with layer heights at fractions of millimeters rather than microns. The filament used in this research is a wood composite which is 60% co-polyester and 40% cellulose. The co-polyester binds the cellulose together while the cellulose provides the hygroscopic properties to the composite. Two methods {{have been developed for}} this kind of printing. The first method uses only the wood composite material. Designed deformation shape is printed by controlling the grain pattern, grain orientation, print layer thickness, and print layer interaction. In this method, hygroscopic bending occurs perpendicular to the grain direction. The second method uses both the wood composite as well as standard 3D printing plastics. This is an extension of the first method that introduces a separate layer of non-hygroscopic material that will not swell when exposed to water. This idea builds off of previous research of thermal bimetal  properties based on their relative expansion. Hygroscopic bending occurs only within the wood composite layers when prints of this method are exposed to water. Therefore, deformation shape is a product of both the patterning of material layers as well as the grain of the wood composite layers, offering quicker and more severe deformation than wood composite construction alone. Both methods allow their materials to deform when subject to moisture, as well as regain their shape. The quickest method observed for shape change is by fully submerging prints in warm water.|$|E

Hydro flattening follows the detection and delineation of water bodies (lakes, rivers, ponds, reservoirs, streams etc.) with hydro <b>break</b> <b>lines.</b> Manual hydro break line generation is time consuming and expensive. Accuracy and processing time depend {{on the number of}} vertices marked for delineation of <b>break</b> <b>lines.</b> Automation with minimal human intervention is desired for this operation. This paper proposes using a novel histogram analysis of LiDAR elevation data and LiDAR intensity data to automatically detect water bodies. Detection of water bodies using elevation information was verified by checking against LiDAR intensity data since the spectral reflectance of water bodies is very small compared with that of land and vegetation in near infra-red wavelength range. Detection of water bodies using LiDAR intensity data was also verified by checking against LiDAR elevation data. False detections were removed using morphological operations and 3 D <b>break</b> <b>lines</b> were generated. Finally, a comparison of automatically generated <b>break</b> <b>lines</b> with their semi-automated/manual counterparts was performed to assess the accuracy of the proposed method and the results were discussed...|$|E

40|$|Laser {{scanning}} {{with its}} ability to penetrate vegetation and its extremely high point density allows for a completely new approach to semi-automatically delineate man-made features (“objects”) in forested areas {{as a basis for}} the management of such data in a GIS. In this paper, emphasis is laid on the detection of roads and buildings from laser scanning data. The basis of our analysis is the generation of a DTM actually representing the earth surface (no tree tops, no building roofs). From a slope model of the terrain, <b>break</b> <b>lines</b> can be detected by applying standard edge extraction techniques. However, the slope model is still too noisy to deliver “good ” (long, continuous) <b>break</b> <b>lines.</b> Thus, a pre-processing step making use of an edge-enhancing filter becomes necessary. From the results of break line detection, a new, geomorphologically revised terrain model can be derived. The <b>break</b> <b>lines</b> contain the road edges which can be interactively selected by the user. With respect to roads, the line extraction results can be improved using a snake algorithm. Building candidate regions can be detected from the differences of surface models derived from the original “last-pulse ” and “first-pulse ” laser data and the rectified ground model. The algorithm is based on a classification of elevation difference models followed by the improvement of classification results by a despeckle filter, the main problem being the distinction of tree tops from buildings. In this paper the algorithms involved for the solution of the above tasks are described and first test results are presented. KURZFASSUN...|$|E

40|$|The {{part of the}} Czech Republic – West Bohemia is {{well known}} for mining activities, {{different}} types of raw materials have been extracted from mines near Jáchymov, Sokolov and other sites since medieval times till today. There are original maps of some sites, as well there is effort of some geologists to find and map relics of mining activities (such as digs visible in terrain) by land survey. The quality of these available maps is unfortunately questionable – due to its age or used methods. Our aim was to find resource useful for searching for these sites, than to use field survey to confirm our findings. We used available digital terrain model (DTM) based on airborne laser scanning (ALS) technology to map relics of mining activities in West Bohemia. The Czech Office for Surveying, Mapping and Cadastre started in 2008 project for terrain mapping using the ALS method. The aim of mapping was to get authentic and detailed DTM of the Czech Republic. About 2 / 3 of area is currently covered by the DTM based on ALS, this year the mapping should be complete. The dataset is characterised by the density of 1 – 2 points/m 2 and the standard deviation in altitude of model points is up to 30 cm (in forested areas). We had DTM in form of shaded surface for one third of the Czech Republic. The shaded surface enables to highlight terrain <b>break</b> <b>lines,</b> which is suitable for archaeological research.

40|$|Aiming at {{solving the}} problem of {{fracture}} at the discontinuities area and the challenges of line fitting in each partition, an innovative line extraction algorithm is proposed based on phase grouping using overlapped partition. The proposed algorithm adopted dual partition steps, which will generate overlapped eight partitions. Between the two steps, the middle axis in the first step coincides with the border lines in the other step. Firstly, the connected edge points that share the same phase gradients are merged into the line candidates, and fitted into line segments. Then to remedy the <b>break</b> <b>lines</b> at the border areas, the break segments in the second partition steps are refitted. The proposed algorithm is robust and does not need any parameter tuning. Experiments with various datasets have confirmed that the method is not only capable of handling the linear features, but also powerful enough in handling the curve features...|$|E

This work presents the outline of an innovative method, designed by the authors, to generate synthetic pictures from point clouds to use in classical photogrammetric software (digital restitution or stereoscopic vision).

40|$|Digitized {{contours}} {{are increasingly}} being applied as a data source for generating regular grid digital elevation models (OEMs). The special characteristics of contours as a DEM data source, and some published contour-specific interpola tion algorithms, are reviewed in this paper. Test results for three algorithms are presented, employing both synthetic and real surface data. The algorithms are: linear interpo lation with four data points found in the grid axis direc tions (LIXY), linear interpolation within two data points found in the approximate direction of steepest slope (LISS), and cubic interpolation within four data points found in the approximate direction of steepest slope (CISS). The results indicate that high fidelity OEMs can be generated from cont ours, particularly when associated terrain features, such as <b>break</b> <b>lines,</b> ridges and spot heights, are incorporated into the input data. The root mean square errors of interpolated heights, relative to the contour data, range from 3 % to 27 % of the contour interval, depending on the interpolation al gorithm, surface structure, and composition of the input data. Error surface contours are employed to illustrate the extent of systematic errors in the interpolated OEMs. The fidelities of the OEMs interpolated {{by means of the}} steepest slope algorithms are significantly higher than those result ing from grid axis interpolation...|$|E

The aerial DEM at 25 m posting interval and aerial orthophoto 0. 25 m resolution are generated in WGS- 84 ellipsoid, UTM projection. The aerial DEM 25 m is resampled to 90 m posting interval for comparsion with SRTM DEM. The validation of SRTM DEM is carried out by three methods viz.

40|$|Abstract. The slot {{coating process}} in the {{production}} of polymer films has a wide range of applications. However, the process cannot be systemized. This study used the computational fluid dynamics software Polyflow to analyze the slot coating process and investigate the influence that the process parameters have on the characteristics of thin-film coating to reduce the time and cost consumed in the experimental methods. The rheological characteristics of the non-Newtonian fluid used in this study were first identified by conducting experiments, and then configured in the simulation software for fitting with mathematical models. In addition, the models of the slot coating process were constructed, and the Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) calculation methods were then used in the Polyflow software. The simulation results were then compared to the experimental results and the findings reported in relevant literature, to determine the influence that the process parameters have on the characteristics of thin-film coating. The simulation results were represented graphically in a coating window plot. The comparison results indicate that the viscosity-shear rate characteristic of the material in the shear rate range of optical film coating is an excellent fit for the Cross Law. When the coating speed is too high or the amount of fluid supply is insufficient, phenomena such as <b>break</b> <b>lines,</b> uneven thickness, and air entrainment can occur...|$|E
