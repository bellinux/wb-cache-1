5000|$|Ball splines (<b>Ball</b> <b>Spline</b> bearings) are {{a special}} type of linear motion bearing {{that are used}} to provide nearly {{frictionless}} linear motion while allowing the member to transmit torque simultaneously. There are grooves ground {{along the length of the}} shaft (thus forming splines) for the recirculating ground balls to run inside. The outer shell that houses the balls is called a nut rather than a bushing, but is not a nut in the traditional sense—it is not free to rotate about the shaft, but is free to travel up and down the shaft.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{advanced}} actuator {{is a kind}} of swaying mechanism specially {{developed for}} certain aircraft, having low rotational speed and great torque. Utilizing criterions of mass equivalent and bending stiffness equivalent, this paper firstly applies simplification to the actuator, getting a piece of continuous beam with varying circular sections. According to the mounting condition of actuator, then establishes the finite element dynamic analyzing model, using I-DEAS software, selecting method of synchronous vector iteration, finishes normal modal analyzing. Next, carries Hertzian contact resonance analyses to ball straight-rotary pair, <b>ball</b> <b>spline</b> pair and ball unload pair, calculates contact resonance frequencies. Considering the resistance torque being moving still concludes formulae of quantity of contact resonance frequencies. Lastly, based on load spectra, makes a conclusion that antiresonance behavior of the actuator is well, showing that the design plan is feasible. Experimentation of prototype indicates that the above theoretical analyses are correct...|$|E
40|$|This Master of Science thesis {{depicts the}} {{mechanical}} design and physical implementa-tion of double H’-gantry manipulator called DOHMAN. The H’-gantry mechanism is belt driven, two dimensional positioning device {{in which the}} belt is arranged in capital “H” form, and enables one linear and one rotary movement. The Ball-Screw Spline, in addition, is mechanism that consists of Ball Screw Nut, <b>Ball</b> <b>Spline</b> Nut, and Lead Screw with screw and spline grooves that fit both nuts. This mechanism enables linear and rotary displacement along the same axis. The DOHMAN robot is made of two par-allel kinematic H’-gantry structures linked with a miniature Ball Screw-Spline mecha-nism. The resulting structure is capable of performing four degrees-of-freedom (DOF) displacements along the three Cartesian axes X, Y and Z {{as well as a}} rotation W around the Z axis. The size and the other geometries of the DOHMAN robot aim to fit into the microfactory concept (TUT-μF) developed at Tampere University of Technology. For position control and visual servoing of the robot, an additional module was de-signed and implemented. Custom design of mechanical parts along with the selection of off-the-shelf components was done for building the robot prototype. The chapters and the appendix of this thesis thoroughly explain the design decisions and the implementa-tion. During the design development a new innovative homing strategy for linear Z and angular W axes was suggested and later implemented. This innovative homing provides efficient use of space for mounting the limit switches, avoiding huge loss in the overall Z-axis movement, and significantly reduces the cabling issues in the moving structure. Besides the innovative homing, other advantages of DOHMAN are distributed actuation and homogeneous workspace. The distributed actuation decreases the overall mass of the moving structure and also reduces the cabling within the overall mechanical system. The consistency in the workspace eases the control of the robot because there are no regions to avoid while moving the end effector...|$|E

A properly completed standards based system which is composed of the SBI and SBT in a hybrid system will provide two modes of lightning protection: (1) a stroke prevention mode that {{reduces the risk of}} a strike to the protected facility in proportion to the size of that facility and the size and number of SBI/SBT's used; and (2) a Stroke Collector-Diverter System that is far superior to any system now in use because it collects strokes entering the protected area from any direction and angle...|$|R
5000|$|Dodge {{versions}} were {{passenger side}} differential drop, standard rotation gears, kingpin knuckles and 35 spline axle shafts in early models. The 2nd Generation axles were driver's side with <b>ball</b> joints. 30 <b>spline</b> axle shafts were {{used instead of}} 35 splines, except 2000, 2001 and 2002 models which were equipped with 32 spline axle shafts.|$|R
50|$|The {{slipper clutch}} {{consists}} of two bases, one with dog clutches and ramps with <b>ball</b> bearings, a <b>splined</b> hub, and clutch plates. In normal operation, the dog clutches mate, driving the transmission. When a back torque comes from the transmission, the splined hub slides up the bearing ramps, disconnecting from the clutch plates and allowing a limited slip between input and output.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{the problem of}} {{estimating}} an unknown function f ∈ L 2 (0, 1) observed with some fractional Brownian noise. This problem is equivalent to estimation in the inverse problem of fractional integration. Since {{we are interested in}} boundary effect, we consider nonperiodic functions which belong to some Sobolev <b>ball.</b> Using a <b>spline</b> basis we construct an estimator and give its exact asymptotic risk. As an inverse problem this framework presents some interest. Indeed, the best basis for the functions is not the best one for the operator. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} splines for the {{approximation of}} harmonic functions on a 3 -dimensional <b>ball.</b> Those <b>splines</b> are {{combined with a}} multiresolution concept. More precisely, at each step of improving the approximation we add more data and, at the same time, reduce the hat-width of the used spline basis functions. Finally, a convergence theorem is proved. One possible application, that is discussed in detail, is {{the reconstruction of the}} Earth's density distribu-tion from gravitational data obtained at a satellite orbit. This is an exponentially ill{posed problem where only the harmonic part of the density can be recovered since its orthogonal complement has the potential 0. Whereas classical approaches use a truncated singular value decomposition (TSVD) with the well{known disadvantages like the non-localizing character of the used spherical harmonics and the bandlimitedness of the solution, modern regularization techniques use wavelets allowing a localized reconstruction via convolutions with kernels that are only essentially large in the region of interest. The essential remaining drawback of a TSVD and the wavelet approaches is that the integrals (i. e. the inner product in case of a TSVD and the convolution in case of wavelets) are calculated on a spherical orbit, whic...|$|R
40|$|A {{robot system}} {{for use in}} an {{enclosed}} environment was designed and tested. The conceptual design {{will be used to}} assist in research performed by the Controlled Ecological Life Support System (CELSS) project. Design specifications include maximum load capacity, operation at specified environmental conditions, low maintenance, and safety. The robot system must not be hazardous to the sealed environment, and be capable of stowing and deploying within a minimum area of the CELSS chamber facility. This design consists of a telescoping robot arm that slides vertically on a shaft positioned {{in the center of the}} CELSS chamber. The telescoping robot arm consists of a series of links which can be fully extended to a length equal to the radius of the working envelope of the CELSS chamber. The vertical motion of the robot arm is achieved through the use of a combination <b>ball</b> screw/ball <b>spline</b> actuator system. The robot arm rotates cylindrically about the vertical axis through use of a turntable bearing attached to a central mounting structure fitted to the actuator shaft. The shaft is installed in an overhead rail system allowing the entire structure to be stowed and deployed within the CELSS chamber. The overhead rail system is located above the chamber's upper lamps and extends to the center of the CELSS chamber. The mounting interface of the actuator shaft and rail system allows the entire actuator shaft to be detached and removed from the CELSS chamber. When the actuator shaft is deployed, it is held fixed at the bottom of the chamber by placing a square knob on the bottom of the shaft into a recessed square fitting in the bottom of the chamber floor. A support boot ensures the rigidity of the shaft. Three student teams combined into one group designed a model of the CELSS chamber robot that they could build. They investigated materials, availability, and strength in their design. After the model arm and stand were built, the class performed pre-tests on the entire system. A stability pre-test was used to determine whether the model robot arm would tip over on the stand when it was fully extended. Results showed the stand tipped when 50 Newtons were applied horizontally to the top of the vertical shaft while the arm was fully extended. This proved that it was stable. Another pre-test was the actuator slip test used to determine if there is an adequate coefficient of friction between the actuator drive wheels and drive cable to enable the actuator to fully extend and retract the arm. This pre-test revealed that the coefficient of friction was not large enough to prevent slippage. Sandpaper was glued to the drive wheel and this eliminated the slippage problem. The class preformed a fit test in the CELSS chamber to ensure that the completed robot arm is capable of reaching the entire working envelope. The robot was centered in the chamber and the arm was fully extended to the sides of the chamber. The arm was also able to retract to clear the drain pipes separating the upper and lower plant trays...|$|R
