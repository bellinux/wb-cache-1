25|$|Larger chains {{have felt}} the impact of {{discount}} retailers, with some customers switching from larger supermarket retailers for everyday necessities. To entice customers into their stores from larger supermarket chains, Poundland advertise familiar brands at competitive prices, with the hope customers may then be inclined to impulse buy other products such as own-brand that they otherwise wouldn't have purchased. Asda reduced some <b>branded</b> <b>product</b> prices such as Colgate toothpaste to £1 in January 2009, in competition with Poundland who offered the same products at the £1 price; in response, Poundland introduced multi-buy offers to provide a larger quantity of the products for the same price.
