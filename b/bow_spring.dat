40|$|In {{compliance}} with European Regulation and with particular reference to EN 14081, grade assignment of timber {{is based upon}} observation of three properties: strength, stiffness and density. Timber is hereby segregated into different grades. However, characteristic values are statistical properties: strength and density are described by 5 % percentile values and stiffness by the mean value. In other words, even though every piece is assigned to a single grade, the properties can only be determined for the overall population of observations and not for every single piece of timber. ViSCAN, with it’s built in laser interferometer, measures the frequency of vibration. X-ray scanning is used to compute density on cross (DENSCAN) and longitudinal (GoldenEye) transport. These measurement units can be used stand-alone or in combination. In this paper different combinations are compared {{with respect to their}} performance in grade prediction. Since moisture content influences wood properties an in-line moisture meter (M 3 SCAN) optionally can be installed so to adjust the measured properties to reference conditions. By using camera based systems, visual override and aesthetical requirements can be considered during grading. Most common are limitations on warp (twist, <b>bow,</b> <b>spring,</b> cup), wane, fissures, knot size and colour changes...|$|E
40|$|Latent class {{regression}} is {{a statistical}} method {{which is not}} well known in wood science for predicting distortion of sawn timber from structural wood characteristics. The method identifies unknown subgroups in a dataset and allows more accurate regression models to be derived. We identified two separate classes to describe the relationship between bowdry, springdry, or twistdry and the predictors: initial distortion bowfresh, springfresh, or twistfresh, wood density, ring width, ring orientation, wood type (juvenile or adult), percentage compression wood measured separately on the four faces, and the contagion index which is a measure for the distribution of compression wood. The latent class regression models developed for the separate classes explained the variation in <b>bow,</b> <b>spring,</b> and twist to a higher degree than a single regression model over the entire dataset. For bow, R 2 increased from 0. 13 to 0. 24 and 0. 41 for Class 1 and Class 2, for spring from 0. 24 to 0. 45 and 0. 67, and for twist from 0. 15 to 0. 38 and 0. 33. For individual regression models, the predictors showed a varying effect. In classes with significant compression wood on the faces, the effect of wood type seemed weaker, and vice versa. It was concluded that latent class regression analysis allows a more detailed explanation {{of the effects of}} wood structure on sawn timber distortion for heterogeneous datasets...|$|E
40|$|This thesis gives {{a summary}} and {{discussion}} of results from five studies concerned with: the distribution of compression wood in relation to external stem and log geometry {{and the impact of}} the compression wood distribution on deformations of sawn timber. Moreover the straightening process of trees is discussed. In order to study the distribution of compression wood in stems and logs, 63 trees of Norway spruce and Scots pine representing different age and curvature categories were sliced into 621 discs. In order to study the impact of compression wood on deformations of sawn timber, 146 logs of Scots pine and Norway spruce were processed into studs and battens. Before crosscutting, the external geometry of stems and logs were assessed. A 3 D-logscanner was used for the assessment of logs. Deformations such as <b>bow,</b> <b>spring</b> and twist were measured on studs and battens at green condition, at 18 % moisture content and at 12 % moisture content. Compression wood content in thin cross sections of discs, studs and battens were analysed using transmitted light and image analysis. The analyses showed that a majority of all discs and cross sections contained compression wood. In all studies, the pith eccentricity was significantly correlated to the discs´ compression wood content. For the 6 -year-old Scots pine trees, the compression wood content was significantly correlated to the size of basal sweep but not to out-of-roundness. For the 22 -year-old Scots pine trees, the compression wood content was not correlated to either bow height or size of basal sweep. For the 60 -year-old Norway spruce trees, the compression wood content was significantly correlated to compression wood content in log ends, pith eccentricity and bow height. For sawn timber, the compression wood content and its position was significantly correlated to bow and spring but not twist. Twist was significantly correlated to grain angle measured on tangential faces of studs and spiral grain angle measured under bark on the surface of logs. Results indicate that eccentric growth and compression wood formation play major roles in the development of stem straightness. Moreover, young trees with basal sweep will be straighter over time. Consequently, the straightness of a log is not a reliable measure of the compression wood content within the stem. By combining data describing external geometry with information regarding compression wood content and pith eccentricity obtained from log ends it is possible to detect logs that are prone to contain compression wood. The results also indicate that the distribution of compression wood in sawn timber influences the direction and size of bow and spring...|$|E

40|$|Timber is {{a natural}} {{material}} that is environmentally friendly, renewable, light, strong and, {{in the eyes of}} most people, beautiful. Timber does, however, have one important drawback when it is used in a modern mechanised building process - its lack of straightness. This {{is one of the main}} reasons for the building industry to choose materials other than timber. The main objective of this work was to identify the cause of moisture-induced distortion and create statistical and analytical models to predict distortion on the basis of material parameters. The work also gives recommendations on the parameters that should be focused on in order to develop methods to remove material prone to distortion. Studies were conducted in which the distortion in a large number of studs was measured at several moisture content levels. The changes in moisture content were made without outer restraints in order to study the effect of the material without the effect of restraints. Several material parameters were also measured on the studs; spiral grain angle, annual ring curvature, juvenile wood, knots, annual ring width, compression wood, cracks, wane, density, shrinkage and skew sawing. Spiral grain angle and annual ring curvature together explain about 65 % of the variation in twist. An analytical model for twist created by Stevens and Johnston (1960) was used. The same level of coefficient of determination was found as that produced by the statistical method. This model was based on annual ring curvature, spiral grain angle and tangential shrinkage strain. None of the measured parameters was able to explain <b>bow</b> and <b>spring</b> statistically. Detailed studies to determine how the longitudinal shrinkage varies within a stud were conducted. A simple model was developed to calculate <b>bow</b> and <b>spring</b> on the basis of the variation in longitudinal shrinkage. This model shows that the most of the <b>bow</b> and <b>spring</b> caused by changes in moisture content can be explained by the variation in longitudinal shrinkage. The most important parameters which can be used to remove timber prone to distortion are, in the case of twist, annual ring curvature and spiral grain angle and, in the case of <b>bow</b> and <b>spring,</b> the variation in longitudinal shrinkage...|$|R

The tool is anchored in place. Stretch and or torque is then applied to the pipe. This allows the pipe recovery engineer to obtain a baseline reading of the free pipe. This will give him a starting point to compare his later freepoint readings to. The tool is then run roughly 500 feet past the estimated stuck point. Stretch and torque are applied, and readings are taken. If the tool indicates that the pipe is stuck at that point the tool is pulled uphole and readings are taken again. By applying the bracketing technique, the pipe recovery engineer is quickly able to identify the exact point that the pipe is free.|$|R

40|$|Heavy {{hardwoods}} are difficult-to-dry timbers as {{they are}} prone to checking and internal stresses when dried using a conventional kiln drying system. These timbers are usually dried naturally to reach 15 % to 19 % moisture content with an acceptable defects. Besides long drying time, timbers at these moisture contents are not suitable for indoor applications since they will further dry and causing, for example, jointing and lamination failures. Drying to a lower moisture content could only be achieved in artificial drying kilns such as conventional kiln, dehumidification kiln, solar kiln, radio frequency-vacuum, etc. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the characteristics of 30 mm and 50 mm thick kekatong (Cynometra spp.) timber dried using kiln drying (KD) and radio frequency-vacuum drying (RFV) system. The investigation involved drying time, moisture content (MC) variations between and within boards, drying defects, shrinkage, and drying stress. Drying defects include checks (surface, end, and internal checks) and warping (<b>bowing,</b> cuping, <b>spring,</b> and twisting). The results showed that RFV drying time was reduced to 50 % compared to the KD. RFV dried boards demonstrated a more uniform MC between and within boards. Shrinkage in width and thickness, as well as tangential/radial and volumetric shrinkages were substantially less in RFV boards. The amount of cupping, <b>bowing</b> and <b>spring</b> were very low and negligible in all drying runs. There was no twisting observed in all drying methods.

Dental Laboratory of RSGM Faculty of Dental Medicine Universitas Airlangga provides services for Faculty of Dental Medicine, Universitas Airlangga students enrolled in a dental profession program. One of services offered is making of removable orthodontic appliances. Until now there has been no research on customer satisfaction after the appliances made in the laboratory. Purpose: This study was conducted to determine whether Universitas Airlangga dental students as customers were satisfied with the work of the RSGM Dental laboratory, particularly in orthodontics. Method: An analytic observational study was carried out on 48 Faculty of Dental Medicine Universitas Airlangga students who were enrolled in a dental profession program and made removable orthodontic appliances in RSGM Dental Laboratory. The students were asked to fill out a questionnaire about satisfaction regarding the timeliness, the suitability of results, the services provided, the quality of both active and passive components, the ease of insertion and activation. Data were analyzed descriptively. The relationship between satisfaction towards the quality of clasp, <b>spring,</b> <b>bow</b> and satisfaction towards the quality of acrylic plate to the ease of insertion were analyzed with Fischer exact test. The relationship between satisfaction towards the quality of clasp, <b>spring,</b> <b>bow</b> and satisfaction towards the quality of acrylic plate to the ease of activation were analyzed by chi square. Result: Respondents who were satisfied with the timeliness of work were 54. 17 %, the suitability of the results of the query were 79. 17 %, the services provided were 95. 83 %, the results of clasp, <b>bow</b> and <b>spring</b> were 72. 92 %, the results of acrylic plate were 77. 08 %, the ease of insertion were 54. 17 %, and the ease of activation were 89. 58 %.

This type of a bow was convergently formed in Eastern China {{in the middle of the}} 2 nd millennium B. C. and in the North Caucasus in the middle of the 4 th millennium B. C. It gets transferred to the Northern Black Sea Region by the Scythians in the late 7 th - early 6 th centuries B. C. that resulted in the dramatic transformation of arrowheads’ types. The Greeks became aware of this weapon in the last third of the 6 th century B. C. Bows can be divided into simple and complex ones. The simple bows are made from one solid bar, while the complex bows are made of several layers of different wood species. Composite bows are constructed from a few consequently connected bars. These types also include a reinforced bow – the <b>bow</b> <b>springing</b> qualities of which are reinforced by bone or tendon plates. Since the ancient masters combined different production methods, the definition of a composite reinforced bow can be found in the literature. European small arms development was focused on improving a simple bow. The strength of such bow was achieved by its size. However, massive bows are unsuitable for firing from a horse. Therefore, in cultures associated with the development of riding the search of methods of bow strength increase at the condition of reducing its size, was going on. In Asia, the focus was made on the material rather than shoulders design. As a result, complex composite bows appear in the East, which were made from several pieces of wood, connected with the central part of the handle at an angle.

In the same subjects, the sagittal outline of the articular eminence and glenoid fossa was traced in panoramic radiographs. The sagittal condylar path inclination was constructed by joining the heights of curvature in the glenoid fossa and the corresponding articular eminence. This was then related to the constructed Frankfurt′s horizontal plane to determine the radiographic angle of sagittal condylar guidance. Results: A strong positive correlation existed between right and left condylar guidance by the protrusive interocclusal method (P 0. 000) and similarly by the radiographic method (P 0. 013). The mean difference between the condylar guidance obtained using both methods were 1. 97 ° for the right side and 3. 18 ° for the left side.

40|$|This work {{describes}} deformation {{and crack}} formation in sawn timber of pine and spruce after first drying and subsequent cycles of resoaking {{in water and}} drying. The influence of annual ring orientation and the occurrence of juvenile wood was determined. In addition, the influence of compression wood, annual ring orientation {{at the edges of}} the cross section, the position of the board surface in relation to the pith, and the condition of the board surface i. e. whether wet or dry during resoaking were studied. When timber is exposed to repeated cycles of wetting and drying, warp, viz <b>spring,</b> <b>bow,</b> twist and cup, increases and is greater after the first cycle. The influence of annual ring orientation on <b>spring,</b> <b>bow</b> and twist depends on the type of deformation and on the kind of wood. Generally, the results indicated that timber with vertical and semi (half) vertical annual rings show less deformation (mean values) than plain sawn timber and timber containing pith. Cup is mainly caused by transverse anisotropy and is strongly influenced by the radius of the annual ring. Therefore, timber with vertical annual rings do not show any cup. Spring, twist and, especially bow are strongly influenced by compression wood. Large amount of compression wood in sawn timber increases such deformation. The distance between sawn timber in the log and the pith with surrounding juvenile wood is of vital significance for cracking. During moisture cycling, the amount of boards that develop cracks increased irrespective of their prior location in the cross section of the stem. Timber sawn from near the pith or distinctly containing pith has a higher relative crack length compared to timber sawn away from and lacking pith.

40|$|About {{half the}} total volume of sawlogs end up as sawn timber. The rest is lostdue to drying {{shrinkage}} or is turned into byproducts like wood chips, sawdustand shavings. As the raw material is a large expense for a sawmill, {{it is important to}} fully utilize the logs. The inherent properties of timber are such that warp, such as <b>bow,</b> cup, <b>spring</b> and twist, is inevitable, and extensive knowledge of whether and to what extent warp will appear is therefore important for managing the production. It is also important to develop strategies to handle warped timber, for example in the planing process. This thesis focuses on how twisted timber is affected by the planing process with regard to twist reduction, cross-sectional shape, planer misses and cutting depth. This was studied in three practical tests on sawn timber with differentapproaches. In one test, sawn pine timber with a large variation of twist withinthe group was planed with standard settings, and five evenly spaced crosssections {{along the length of the}} sawn timber were subjected to more detailed studies. In the second test, the main yield from spruce logs was planed. One sample board from each log was planed with the normal pressure settings of the planing mill, while the second sample was planed with a pressure either higher or lower than the normal settings. In this study, seven cross-sections were studied in more detail, three close to the top end, three close to the butt end, and one in the middle of the sawn timber.

60|$|He had not lain {{thus more}} than {{quarter of an}} hour when he was startled by the report of a gun, which was {{followed}} by a wild scream and a chorus of unearthly yells. At the same instant, and ere he could attempt to rise, his legs and arms were pinioned to the ground by four powerful Indians. For an instant Maximus was paralysed. Then the terrible reality of his position, the scream of Aneetka, and the sight of the thong with which his captors were about to bind him, caused his spirit to rebound with a degree of violence that lent him for the moment the strength of a giant. With a shout, in which even a tone of contempt seemed to mingle the Esquimau hurled his captors right and left, and sprang to his feet. The Indians fled; but one, who was a moment later in rising than the others, received a blow that felled him instantly. Maximus glanced quickly round in search of his wife, and observed her being hurried away by two Indians. As the arrow leaps from the <b>bow</b> the Esquimau <b>sprang</b> forward in pursuit. The Indians saw him coming. In bitter anger they prepared to let her go and fly, for having dropped their guns in the scuffle they were unable to fire upon their approaching foe. But there were other Indians in the bush whose weapons were levelled at the breast of Maximus, and the next moment would have been his last, but for a stone thrown from the cliffs above, which struck him on the forehead and stretched him bleeding and insensible upon the ground.|$|R
