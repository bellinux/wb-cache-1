40|$|The {{dry powder}} towpreg process overcomes {{many of the}} {{difficulties}} associated with melt, solution and slurry prepregging of advanced composite materials. In the process, fluidized powder is deposited on spread tow bundles and melted on the fibers by radiant heating to adhere the polymer to the fiber. Bench scale design and operating data have been correlated for use in process scale up to commercial operation. Powdered towpreg has been woven and molded into preform material of good quality. Cost estimates suggest that processing costs are {{comparable to those of}} conventional hot melt prepreg. In the future, from a part fabrication point of view, powder coated prepreg tape, woven <b>broad</b> <b>goods</b> and woven and braided preforms may be considered as options to similar materials made by other methods...|$|E
40|$|Using a {{new data}} set on Swiss {{state and local}} governments from 1890 to today, we analyze how the {{adoption}} of proportional representation affects fiscal policy. We show that proportional systems shift spending toward <b>broad</b> <b>goods</b> (e. g. education and welfare benefits) but decrease spending on targetable goods (e. g. roads and agricultural subsidies). Our evidence does not suggest that proportional representation increases the overall size of government. We provide new evidence on the mechanism behind these estimates. We show that proportional elections lead to better political representation of left-wing parties, which are associated with more spending. Furthermore, proportional elections lead to higher political fragmentation. However, since political fragmentation increases spending in a plurality system only, proportional elections reduce spending through its more moderate effects of fractionalized parliaments. electoral system, public finance, political fragmentation, matching...|$|E

Most {{are aware of}} the significant impact food choices can play in health conditions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular function and the importance of nutrition for physical and psychological well-being. Importantly, nutrition for brain function and cognitive performance is a rapidly increasing area of interest for scientists, industry and the general public. As a modifiable lifestyle choice, diet and nutrition are important contributors to brain health across the lifespan. In the chapters that follow, exciting, innovative research regarding the role of nutrition and diet in brain health is discussed.
