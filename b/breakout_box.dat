25|$|A {{breakout}} dock is conceptually a <b>breakout</b> <b>box</b> in {{the form}} of a dock. It is an extension to a typical port replicator in that it not only replicates existing ports already on the computer, but also offers additional ports. Modern computers most often accomplish this by using a special, often proprietary, connector that consolidates the signals from many concealed traces from onboard external buses into one connector. As such, the dock can offer a greater number of ports than is physically present on the computer. This allows the basic unit to have fewer physical ports while still allowing users a way to access to the full range of features of its motherboard.|$|E
2500|$|Cirrus Logic {{provides}} a software application known as CobraCAD, which assists {{in the design}} of the network on which the CobraNet system will run. [...] It helps to identify if there are too many routers between two CobraNet devices, if a certain latency is possible given the network configuration, and other tasks. [...] However, Cirrus Logic does not provide software to manipulate their hardware. [...] In fact, in the simplest of cases, no software is required by the end user. [...] For instance, a simple <b>breakout</b> <b>box</b> which converts a CobraNet signal to eight analog audio signals would require little or no configuration by the end user apart from possibly selecting the bundle number. [...] If configuration is required (for example, in a DSP box with integrated CobraNet I/O), then the manufacturer of the device typically supplies proprietary software for that purpose.|$|E

50|$|An Ethernet-based {{protocol}} can distribute multiple DMX universes {{through a}} single cable from a control location to <b>breakout</b> <b>boxes</b> closer to fixtures. These boxes then output the conventional DMX512 signal. ANSI E1.31—2009 Entertainment Technology—Lightweight streaming protocol for transport of DMX512 using ACN, published May 4, 2009, and Art-Net are two free-to-use protocols used to achieve this.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} <b>breakout</b> <b>boxes</b> use D-subminiature {{connectors}} (sometimes {{referred to as}} D-sub connectors and sometimes erroneously as DB connectors) and are configured with {{both male and female}} DE-9, DA-15, DB-25, DC-37 or DD-50 standard density connectors and related test points. These units {{can also be used to}} simulate special cables, interconnect RS-232 devices, or adapt test equipment to an RS-232 device.|$|R
50|$|Punch-down blocks are a {{very quick}} and easy way to connect wiring, {{as there is no}} {{stripping}} of insulation and no screws to loosen and tighten. Punch-down blocks are often used as patch panels, or as <b>breakout</b> <b>boxes</b> for PBX or other similar key phone systems with a 50-pin RJ21 (Amphenol) connector. They are sometimes used in other audio applications, such as in reconfigurable patch panels.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>breakout</b> <b>box</b> {{serves as}} a {{troubleshooting}} tool to determine the wiring of an electrical connector interface on a networking device or computer. Typically, a <b>breakout</b> <b>box</b> is inserted between two electrical devices to determine which signal or power interconnects are active. Breakout boxes are extremely useful in troubleshooting connection problems resulting from manufacturing errors (e.g., miswiring) or defective interconnects resulting from broken wiring. Breakout boxes are specific examples of a more general category of network testing equipment called [...] "status monitors".|$|E

5000|$|Because the {{standard}} did not foresee {{the requirements of}} devices such as computers, printers, test instruments, POS terminals, and so on, designers implementing an RS-232 compatible interface on their equipment often interpreted {{the standard}} idiosyncratically. The resulting common problems were non-standard pin assignment of circuits on connectors, and incorrect or missing control signals. The lack of adherence to the standards produced a thriving industry of <b>breakout</b> <b>boxes,</b> patch boxes, test equipment, books, and other aids for the connection of disparate equipment. A common deviation from the standard was to drive the signals at a reduced voltage. Some manufacturers therefore built transmitters that supplied +5 V and −5 V and labeled them as [...] "RS-232 compatible".|$|R

The <b>breakout</b> <b>box</b> sits between {{two pieces of}} equipment and usually has some LEDs to display {{the status of the}} different signals in the serial cable. It will also often have DIP switches to let the user connect or disconnect different signals in the cable, and it will usually have connector pins that let the user short pins together using electrical jumpers, or gain access to individual signal lines with an oscilloscope or other test equipment.|$|E
40|$|This UK review aims {{to provide}} a {{critical}} introduction to the policies and research on the subjects of digital literacy and digital participation, seeking to show what they mean for classroom practice. Aimed at teachers and practitioners, especially those involved in continuing professional development programmes, and providers of teacher training or practice-based Masters courses, it reviews the major research and evidence on developing digital literacy and digital participation in the classroom. It highlights {{the fact that there}} is extensive theory, conceptual development and policy on digital literacy and digital participation, yet little evidence about how this can be translated into practice. The review aims to support and enable practitioners to start developing informed strategies to promote digital participation in real school settings by introducing them to a range of debates and key concepts and by relating these concepts to practice. It should be used as the basis for supporting the development of teachers’ professional knowledge and skills in the critical use of digital media and technology for learning and for the enhancement of the curriculum. Throughout, examples of existing and emerging practices are included as <b>breakout</b> <b>boxes</b> to illustrate the conceptual content. The document supports Futurelab’s Digital Participation project, a programme of research and development in collaboration with teachers in primary and secondary schools which seeks to model, trial and evaluate practical strategies for enhancing young people’s digital literacy in the classroom and their development of digital participation for life...|$|R
40|$|Digital audio {{networks}} are becoming the preferred {{solution for the}} interconnection of professional audio devices. Prominent amongst their advantages are: reduced noise interference, signal multiplexing, {{and a reduction in}} the number of cables connecting networked devices. In the context of professional audio, digital networks have been used to connect devices including: mixers, effects units, preamplifiers, <b>breakout</b> <b>boxes,</b> computers, monitoring controllers, and synthesizers. Such {{networks are}} governed by protocols that define the connection management rocedures, and device synchronization processes of devices that conform to the protocols. A wide range of digital audio network control protocols exist, each defining specific hardware requirements of devices that conform to them. Device parameter control is achieved by sending a protocol message that indicates the target parameter, and the action that should be performed on the parameter. Typically, a device will conform to only one protocol. By implication, only devices that conform to a specific protocol can communicate with each other, and only a controller that conforms to the protocol can control such devices. This results in the isolation of devices that conform to disparate protocols, since devices of different protocols cannot communicate with each other. This is currently a challenge in the professional music industry, particularly where digital networks are used for audio device control. This investigation seeks to resolve the issue of interoperability between professional audio devices that conform to different digital audio network protocols. This thesis proposes the use of a proxy that allows for the translation of protocol messages, as a solution to the interoperability problem. The proxy abstracts devices of one protocol in terms of another, hence allowing all the networked devices to appear as conforming to the same protocol. The proxy receives messages on behalf of the abstracted device, and then fulfills them in accordance with the protocol that the abstracted device conforms to. Any number of protocol devices can be abstracted within such a proxy. This has the added advantage of allowing a common controller to control devices that conform to the different protocols...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presented}} {{the design of}} SRPS, ground function test, and the deployment test on a high speed taxi of KC- 100 airplane. KAI has developed a spin recovery system in collaboration with Airborne Systems for KC- 100 general aviation airplane. Spin mode analysis, rotary balance and forced oscillation tests were performed to obtain the rotational, dynamic derivatives in the preliminary design phase. Prior to the detailed design process of SRPS, approximations for initial estimation of design parameters- fineness ratio, parachute porosity, parachute canopy filling time, and deployment method- were considered. They were done based on the analytical disciplines such as aerodynamics, structures, and stability & control. SRPS consists of parachute, tractor rocket assembly for deployment, attach release mechanism (ARM) and cockpit control system. Before the installation of SRPS in KC- 100 airplane, all the control functions of this system were demonstrated by using SBTB(System <b>Breakout</b> Test <b>Box)</b> in the laboratory. SBTB was used to confirm if it can detect faults, and simulate the firing of pyrotechnic devices that control the deployment and jettison of SRPS. Once confirmed normal operation of SRPS, deployment and jettison of parachute on the high speed taxiing were performed...|$|R
