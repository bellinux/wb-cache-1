40|$|Abstract. Rod-like Al 3 Ni {{intermetallic}} structures {{have been}} widely studied by <b>Bridgman</b> <b>techniques</b> of solidification. However, {{there is a lack}} of experiments conducted under unsteady-state solidification conditions. Such conditions are very close to the industrial reality since the thermal solidification variables (tip cooling rate, tip growth rate and thermal gradient) are freely changing as solidification progresses. In this research, Al 3 Ni structures found in hypoeutectic Al-Ni alloys were characterized under transient solidification conditions. Two Al-Ni alloys (1. 0 and 5. 0 wt%Ni) were directionally solidified. SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope) micrographs were obtained along the casting length (P). It was possible to observe with adequate magnifications the distribution of rod-like Al 3 Ni particles along the interdendritic regions. In order to emphasize the examination of morphology and distribution of such particles, the aluminum-rich matrix was dissolved by immersion of the sample in a fluoride acid solution (0. 5 %HF + 99. 5 % H 2 O). The effects of nickel content, dendritic arrangement and Al 3 Ni distribution on mechanical properties were investigated by tensile tests...|$|R
50|$|Modern {{superalloys}} {{were developed}} in the 1980s. The first generation superalloys incorporated increased aluminium, titanium, tantalum, and niobium content {{in order to increase}} the γ' volume fraction in these alloys. Examples of first generation superalloys include: PWA1480, René N4 and SRR99. Additionally, the volume fraction of the γ' precipitates increased to about 50-70% with the advent of single crystal, or monocrystal, solidification techniques (see <b>Bridgman</b> <b>technique)</b> for superalloys that enable grain boundaries to be entirely eliminated from a casting. Because the material contained no grain boundaries, carbides were unnecessary as grain boundary strengthers and were thus eliminated.|$|E

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{numerical}} simulation of heat transfer by natural convection in a rectangular enclosure, filled with a liquid metal (low Prandtl number) partially heated from below with a sinusoidal temperature. The value of the study lies in its involvement in the crystal growth for the manufacture of semiconductors and electronics cooling. Indeed, the occurrence of convection during crystal growth can lead to in homogeneities that lead to striations and defects that {{affect the quality of}} the crystals obtained by the <b>Bridgman</b> <b>techniques</b> or Chochrawlski. Temperature of the oscillations, due to the instabilities of the convective flow in the liquid metal, also induces non-uniform cooling in the solidification front. Convection is then studied in order to reduce it. A modelling of the problem in two dimensions was conducted using Comsol computer code that is based on the finite element method, by varying the configuration of the control parameters, namely, the Rayleigh number, the nature of fluid (Prandtl number) and amplitude of temperature on heat transfer rate (Nusselt number) on convective structures that appear...|$|R

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{study of}} the buoyancy driven natural convection of liquid materials is presented. There is experimental evidence that at low values of the Grashof number (Gr) the flow is laminar and steady while is periodic and generally time dependent as the value of Gr increases. This behaviour affects the products in many applications, for instance the quality of semi-conductor crystals grown by the Czochralski and <b>Bridgman</b> <b>techniques.</b> The bifurcation pattern of this flow has been almost completely identified in the two dimensional case whereas in three dimensions we cannot mention any published result due to the inadequacy of the computational resources. In this work we shall present the flow configurations occuring {{in the case of}} a shallow (4 Δ 1 Δ 1) box where the temperature gradient is applied at the smaller vertical faces. The fluid considered has Prandtl number equal to 0. 015. The vorticity-velocity formulation of the Navier-Stokes equations has been integrated by means of a fully implicit finite difference scheme. By starting from a steady flow configuration as Gr increases we shall describe the transition to a periodic flow, and then from this one the transition to a non-periodic timedependent flow. ...|$|R

Twin boundaries in several 2 mm thick large area specimens were first documented using infrared transmission imaging. These specimens were then fabricated into either 2 mm pixel or planar detectors in order to examine the effect of the twin boundaries on detector performance. Preliminary results show that twin boundaries, which are decorated with tellurium inclusions, produce a reduction in detector efficiency and a degradation in resolution. The extent of the degradation appears to be a function of the density of tellurium inclusions...|$|R
