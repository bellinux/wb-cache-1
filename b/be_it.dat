5|$|Due to {{the status}} of its builder, Doune {{reflected}} current ideas of what a royal castle building should <b>be.</b> <b>It</b> was planned as a courtyard with ranges of buildings on each side, although only the northern and north-western buildings were completed. These comprise a large tower house over the entrance, containing the rooms of the Lord and his family, and a separate tower containing the kitchen and guest rooms. The two are linked by the great hall. The stonework is almost all from the late 14th century, with only minor repairs carried out in the 1580s. The restoration of the 1880s replaced the timber roofs and internal floors, as well as interior fittings.|$|E

5|$|The {{life cycle}} of a bee, <b>be</b> <b>it</b> a solitary or social species, {{involves}} the laying of an egg, the development through several moults of a legless larva, a pupation stage during which the insect undergoes complete metamorphosis, followed {{by the emergence of}} a winged adult. Most solitary bees and bumble bees in temperate climates overwinter as adults or pupae and emerge in spring when increasing numbers of flowering plants come into bloom. The males usually emerge first and search for females with which to mate. The sex of a bee is determined by whether or not the egg is fertilised; after mating, a female stores the sperm, and determines which sex is required at the time each individual egg is laid, fertilised eggs producing female offspring and unfertilised eggs, males. Tropical bees may have several generations in a year and no diapause stage.|$|E

5|$|The player {{generally}} has {{to explore the}} dungeon to reveal its contents similar to a fog of war. Many roguelikes include factors related to light sources such as a torch to provide illumination to see monsters in nearby squares, and line of sight can also limit what monsters are visible. Dungeons tend to be connected by stairs; lower dungeon levels generally are more difficult than higher ones, so that a character that is underdeveloped may have difficulty by progressing too fast. Dungeon levels and the population of monsters and treasure within them are generated randomly using procedural generation, so that no game is the same on subsequent playthroughs. Most roguelikes have an ultimate goal of either claiming an item located at the deepest level of the dungeon, or to defeat a specific monster that lives on that level. Typical roguelikes include a scoreboard, ranking the player's performance once their game is over (<b>be</b> <b>it</b> through permadeath or completing the objective) based {{on the amount of}} treasure, money, and experience earned, and how fast the player completed the game in such cases.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{the other}} kings of the Fifth Dynasty, Shepseskare's name appears neither in the {{personal}} names of people of the time nor {{in the names of}} funerary estates. He is also absent from the titles and biographies of state officials.

The omission of Shepseskare, <b>be</b> <b>it</b> between Neferirkare and Neferefre or between Neferefre and Nyuserre, indicates that his reign must have been very short. Since Manetho's Aegyptiaca dates to the 3rd century BC, Khau-Ptah's contemporary account can be regarded as a more accurate indication of the political situation during the Fifth Dynasty.|$|E

Eventually, the Princess Royal fell ill, but the incompetent Dr. Clark declared it a minor ailment, incorrectly prescribing her with calomel. In fact, the young Princess Victoria had become seriously ill. Albert, who was devoted to his first-born, confronted Victoria on the incompetence of the staff selected by the Baroness. There was a quarrel, after which Albert declared that he would leave the affair in her queenly hands, and <b>be</b> <b>it</b> on her head if the child died. Soon after this argument, Victoria gave in to him and ultimately dismissed Lehzen, ostensibly for her health. To Albert, Lehzen was a servant who had attempted to rise above her place in life, and he wanted Victoria to rely on him alone.|$|E
