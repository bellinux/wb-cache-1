The basic principles remain the same, anatomy of the donkey and criteria for a donkey harness, but the concept is to make a comfortable harness from locally available materials. The most simple pulling device is opted for, the <b>breast</b> <b>strap</b> harness.

40|$|A {{number of}} struts or <b>straps</b> <b>support</b> a rigid, {{delicate}} mass (dewar) {{which must be}} successfully launched and maintained in orbit {{for a long time}} at very low temperature. The support system must be designed so that the heat flow into the mass is minimized subject to constraints on minimum allowable natural frequency of the mass during launch, minimum natural frequency of the mass in orbit, maximum allowable stress in any support member during launch, and no buckling or slackening of any support member during launch. Optimum designs are obtained via the CONMIN program for a support system consisting of simple tension <b>straps</b> and <b>support</b> systems with passive thermal disconnect features by means of which the thermal conductance is greatly reduced during the transition from the launch condition to the orbital condition. The theory indicates that either of the optimized thermal disconnect support systems will allow the mass to stay cold far longer than will the optimized tension <b>strap</b> <b>support</b> system...|$|R

500|$|Horse harness, ("trace" [...] or [...] "breast"): Throughout {{the ancient}} world, the 'throat-and-girth' harness {{was used for}} {{harnessing}} horses that pulled carts; this greatly limited a horse's ability to exert itself as it was constantly choked at the neck. A painting on a lacquerware box from the State of Chu, dated to the 4th century BC, shows the first known use of a yoke placed across a horses's chest, with traces connecting to the chariot shaft. The hard yoke across the horse's chest was gradually replaced by a <b>breast</b> <b>strap,</b> which was often depicted in carved reliefs and stamped bricks of tombs from the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD). Eventually, the horse collar was invented in China, at least by the 5th century.|$|R

50|$|Being {{the classic}} {{breastplate}} for English riding, campdrafting or stockwork, the stockman's or hunting breastplate {{is the most}} common type. It consists of a yoke (with a neck and wither <b>strap),</b> a <b>breast</b> <b>strap</b> {{at the bottom of the}} yoke which runs through the horse's front legs and attaches to the girth, and two straps at the top of the yoke which attach to the D-rings of a saddle. There are usually buckles for adjusting the size of the yoke as well as the length of the straps which attach to the saddle and girth. The hunting breastplate not only helps to prevent the saddle from slipping, but also may be used to attach a Market Harborough or standing and running martingales, which are clipped or buckled onto a ring at the chest.|$|R
5|$|Although {{horse and}} ox-drawn carts and spoke-wheeled chariots had existed in China {{long before the}} Han dynasty, {{it was not until}} the 1st century BCE that {{literary}} evidence pointed to the invention of the wheelbarrow, while painted murals on Han tomb walls of the 2nd century CE show the wheelbarrow in use for hauling goods. While the 'throat-and-girth' harness was still in use throughout much of the ancient world (placing an excessive amount of pressure on horses' necks), the Chinese were placing a wooden yoke across their horses' chests with traces to the chariot shaft by the 4th century BCE in the State of Chu (as seen on a Chu lacquerware). By Han times, the Chinese replaced this heavy yoke with a softer <b>breast</b> <b>strap,</b> as seen in Han stamped bricks and carved tomb reliefs. In the final stage of evolution, the modern horse collar was invented in China by the 5th century CE, during the Northern Wei period.|$|R

40|$|The tension straps, {{which are}} {{primarily}} {{part of the}} preload structure, are also used to support the leads.

In addition to the Lorentz loading, the displacements of the straps due to the global structural behavior should be imposed on the short runs of lead connections that bridge from the straps to the coils. In the present design the transfer of support of the lead between coil and strap is abrupt, and prone to stress concentration. A support concept that is schematically shown in figure 2 is recommended.

40|$|The {{focal plane}} of the AXAF X-Ray Spectrometer {{requires}} an operating temperature of 0. 1 K with a mission lifetime of 5 yrs. This demanding task is accomplished with a hybrid cryogenic subsystem consisting of mechanical coolers, a superfluid helium dewar and an adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator. By using mechanical coolers to remove heat from the dewar outer vapor-cooled shield, a 5 -yr lifetime is achievable with only a 483 -liter tank. This approach takes advantage of flight-proven, high-performance dewar technology and recent success {{in the development of}} split, Stirling-cycle mechanical coolers. Although the dewar design principles are similar to those used previously, parasitic heat flow is reduced to a new level by an optimized tension <b>strap</b> <b>support</b> system and careful attention to insulation system details. The benefit of the mechanical coolers is maximized by dewar interface design features that minimize parasitic heating and thermal impedance of the coupling. The dewar design and thermal performance analysis are discussed. Helium lifetime sensitivities and the effects of mechanical cooler failures are predicted...|$|R
40|$|Anklebot is a {{general-purpose}} therapeutic robot {{designed to}} guide the human ankle through motions with appropriate assistance.

This study seeks to quantify the slippage that exists using the current shoulder <b>strap</b> <b>support</b> system and seeks to identify new methods of support that warrant further investigation. An exoskeleton support system and a waist support system made of bungees attached to a belt were prototyped methods to improve upon the current shoulder strap design. Variance in the separation between markers on the knee brace and leg was used as a measure of slippage. The exoskeleton did not decrease slippage primarily due to high tolerances in the inversion-eversion joint at the heel of the shoe. The waist support system decreases slippage when enough bungees were attached. Further work on the waist support system is recommended. by Gregory Daniel Tao. Thesis (S. B.)

2500|$|The Macedonian phalangite shield, also {{termed the}} 'Telamon shield', was {{circular}} and displayed a slight convexity; its outer surface was faced {{by a thin}} bronze sheet. The inner face of the shield was of wood or a multilayered leather construction, with a band for the forearm fixed to {{the centre of the}} shield. Plutarch noted that the phalangites (phalanx soldiers) carried a small shield on their shoulder. This probably meant that, as both hands were needed to hold the sarissa, the shield was worn suspended by a shoulder strap and steadied by the left forearm passing through the armband. The left hand would project beyond the rim of the shield to grip the sarissa. Recent reconstructions of the sarissa and phalangite shield showed that the shoulder <b>strap</b> <b>supporting</b> the shield effectively helps to transfer some of the weight of the sarissa from the left arm to the shoulders when the sarissa is held horizontally in its fighting position.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the electromyographic (EMG) activity level of two back muscles and two lower limb muscles during a leg holding exercise in <b>strapped</b> (<b>supported)</b> and unstrapped positions. The strapped position is usually used in clinical situations while the unstrapped position is commonly adopted by the patient in the home environment. Muscle activity of the longissimus thoracis, multifidus, gluteus maximus and biceps femoris muscles of 15 healthy young males was recorded by surface electrodes. During the leg holding exercise in the strapped position, normalized EMG activity of longissimus thoracis (64 %) and multifidus (71 %) were shown to be higher than that of gluteus maximus (39 %) and biceps femoris (47 %). Similarly, higher activity of longissimus thoracis (66 %) and multifidus (67 %) than that of gluteus maximus (43 %) and biceps femoris (46 %) was found in unstrapped position. No significant differences were demonstrated in the activity of the back and lower limb muscles between strapped and unstrapped positions. The present study may suggest that more training effect will be expected for back muscles than for lower limb muscles when using leg holding as a training exercise. The leg holding exercise using hands for stabilization (common in home environment) may be regarded as effective as the exercise stabilized with straps (common in clinical situations).
