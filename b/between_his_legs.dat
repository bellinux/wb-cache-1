Williams retained the championship in the match by jumping off of the top rope and landing on his feet with Styles' head <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>legs,</b> connecting with the Canadian Destroyer. Williams followed by pinning Styles to win the encounter.|$|E
5|$|Furious, Presto {{tries to}} attack Alec, {{but in an}} act to defend himself, Alec puts an offstage ladder into the wizard hat, and Presto is hit <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>legs.</b> Presto {{attempts}} to hit Alec with it, but it misses and hits a backstage door, and Presto ends up getting pushed across the stage. Presto antagonizes Alec again, covering the carrot with a cloth before smashing it into a pulp {{with a piece of}} the ladder. Alec furiously retaliates by aiming the opening of the wizard's hat towards an electrical socket which Presto's fingers go into, shocking Presto into dancing wildly to bluegrass music.|$|E
5|$|In Greek mythology, Serpens {{represents}} a snake {{held by the}} healer Asclepius. Represented in the sky by the constellation Ophiuchus, Asclepius once killed a snake, but the animal was subsequently resurrected after a second snake placed a revival herb on it before its death. As snakes shed their skin every year, they were known as the symbol of rebirth in ancient Greek society, and legend says Asclepius would revive dead humans using the same technique he witnessed. Although this is likely the logic for Serpens' presence with Ophiuchus, the true reason is still not fully known. Sometimes, Serpens was depicted as coiling around Ophiuchus, {{but the majority of}} atlases showed Serpens passing either behind Ophiuchus' body or <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>legs.</b>|$|E

50|$|QB Matt Scott {{missed a}} handful of open {{receivers}} in the third quarter, and — on a play that could have changed {{the momentum of the}} game — WR Delashaun Dean dropped what would have been a 50-yard gain. Dean appeared to trap the ball <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>leg</b> and the ground; a video replay rule confirmed that it was an incomplete pass.|$|R
5|$|Sinden made {{changes for}} the third period. He benched Awrey and the Jean Ratelle line, going with three lines. In the third, Clarke scored to bring Canada within one. The Canadians {{attempted}} to get the equalizer, and Yvan Cournoyer put a puck off the post, but the Soviets broke out afterwards and Boris Mikhailov scored on the counter-attack to restore the two-goal lead with six minutes to play. Mikhailov skated across the Canadian net about 20 feet out, lured Dryden away from the net, then back-handed the puck into the net <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>legs.</b> The strategy of three lines, combined with the heat in the arena, had left the Canadians exhausted by then and the Soviets scored twice in the final minutes to finish with a 7–3 victory.|$|E
5|$|The TNA X Division Championship was contested for in an Iron Man {{match in}} the seventh match, as then-champion, A.J. Styles, defended the title against Christopher Daniels. The first fall of the match came when Daniels pinned Styles {{following}} bending Styles forward, placing Styles' head <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>legs,</b> tucked Styles' arms behind Styles' back, lifted him up, turned 90°, and dropped to the mat to force Styles' face into the mat in what Daniels dubbed the Angel's Wings. Styles scored the second fall by pinning Daniels with a roll-up, tying the match one fall apiece. Before the deciding fall to break the tie could take place, the thirty-minute time limit ran out. Daniels then demanded the match go into overtime/sudden death, which he was granted by Dusty Rhodes. The deciding pinfall saw Styles grab Daniels, lift him up, hold him upside down, trap Daniels' arms behind his legs, and jump forward to implant Daniels entire body into the mat in a move Styles dubbed the Styles Clash to retain the X Division Championship.|$|E
5|$|The first {{match that}} aired {{was for the}} WWE Intercontinental Championship in a Steel cage match, a match fought within a cage formed by placing four sheets of mesh metal around, in, or against {{the edges of the}} wrestling ring. Jeff Hardy was {{defending}} the title against Johnny Nitro. The match included various high-flying moves like top-rope kicks and powerbombs {{off the top of the}} cage. Near the end of the match, Hardy pulled Nitro from the top of the cage and nearly scored a pinfall after a Swanton Bomb, but Nitro put his foot on the bottom rope. Nitro then made it over the cage, but just as Nitro was about to jump, Hardy dropkicked the door open, and Nitro fell onto the top of the door, paining him <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>legs.</b> As Nitro was on top of the door, Hardy kicked the cage door, and walked out the door to win the match and retain his Intercontinental Championship.|$|E

25|$|At Lord's in 1959, {{he had two}} ribs broken {{early in}} the first innings by Brian Statham, despite which he scored 81. Later in the year, his 74 in the second innings at Kanpur was crucial in India winning its first Test against Australia. This innings ended when he pulled Alan Davidson, who was bowling left-arm spin at the time. Neil Harvey at short leg ducked and turned, but the ball got stuck <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>legs.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the Second Test at Lord's—the spiritual home of cricket— Waugh {{started on}} six one the second morning scored quickly to reach 99. He {{was looking for}} his century during an over by Phil Tufnell. Tufnell was {{employing}} his customary defensive approach of pitching the ball outside the leg stump with a leg side field. The first ball was a half-volley and Waugh hit it straight {{from the middle of}} the bat. However, the ball hit the short leg fielder in the shins. Later in the over, another leg side ball hit his pads, rolled <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> and onto the stumps, meaning that Waugh missed out on his century.|$|E

Sometimes, in fact, the placement didn't matter so much because the power sent the ball through men recognized as outstanding fielders. Once such stroke, a cover-drive, was through Thomas's legs just as he got his hands there. I felt glad that the ball went <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> and that his hands were not behind it. Not even Jehu drove more furiously than Dexter, and a direct hit on the leg or hands might well have put this accomplished fieldsman out of action.|$|E

25|$|By {{the third}} day of his capture, Bryson had earned {{sufficient}} trust from Berdella to persuade him to establish a regime of tying his hands in front of him after his sexual abuse rather than above his head and to the bed upon the excuse that his (Berdella's) doing so was restricting the circulation to his arms; he had also persuaded Berdella to leave a television on within the room, with the remote control placed <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> whenever Berdella was out of the room. However, he would later state to investigators that he had thought almost constantly about escaping. The following day, he managed to break free of his restraints by burning through them using a book of matches Berdella had inadvertently left in the room and within his reach when he had left the house to go to his place of work.|$|E

25|$|In Bernini’s sculpture, you see Neptune {{towering over}} Triton. He {{appears to be}} a man in his early thirties, with a beard and wavy locks. Neptune has his legs spread apart and is {{balancing}} on a large seashell that carries both himself and Triton. Neptune only has a large sheet covering his right shoulder and gliding in <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>legs,</b> revealing parts of the male anatomy. The anatomy of the entire body is defined and the twisting of his torso gives him a more trimmed outline of his muscles, allowing the viewer to pay particular attention to his muscles and how they are contracted or relaxed in his state of movement. While standing, Neptune also holds a trident downward in motion that makes it look like he is about to thrust it at someone. “(H)e turns his angry look towards the water, which gushes forth at his feet, imposing his command by thrusting down with his trident.” His arms are tense, forcefully gripping it to dictate his divine power. There is an implication of wind in the long sheet and Neptune’s hair drift backwards, aiding the illusion of reality.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the {{continued}} Edmonton injuries trickle-down effect, the Barons started November with few veterans and nine skaters who had played for the ECHL last season. Oklahoma City suffered their second shutout loss of the season on November 1 with a 6–0 loss to the Chicago Wolves, one of the worst losses in the franchise's four-year history. They responded with a 4–2 victory over Chicago the next day. Goalie Olivier Roy, who was pulled from the net after allowing five goals in the first 21 shots in the first game, made 31 saves in the rematch. Lander was reassigned to the Barons after Ryan Hamilton was reactivated by the Oilers. Oklahoma City struggled with inconsistency problems due to the turnover with Edmonton: they had scored an average of about four goals in their five wins of the season thus far, but only about 1.1 in their seven losses. The Oilers signed a goaltender Ilya Bryzgalov to a $1.7 million contract on November 8, and he began practicing with the Barons. Goalie Tyler Bunz made 34 saves in his first AHL start against San Antonio on November 9, but the team fell 3–2 after the Rampage scored two shootout goals and only Ryan Hamilton scored for Oklahoma City. The Barons defeated San Antonio by the same score on November 12, with Omark getting the game-winner after sliding the pick behind his back and <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> before scoring against goalie Jacob Markström. The goal generated a great deal of attention, becoming the most-viewed video on the Oklahoma City Barons website with over 75,000 views in the first 24 hours, and making ESPN SportsCenter's top ten plays, a rarity for the AHL.|$|E
500|$|... "Big Two-Hearted River" [...] {{has strong}} autobiographical elements. During World War I, Hemingway {{signed on as}} a member of the Red Cross at age 19, [...] and was sent to the Italian Front at Fossalta as an {{ambulance}} driver. On his first day there, he helped to retrieve the remains of female workers killed in a munitions factory explosion, about which he later wrote in Death in the Afternoon: [...] "I remember that after we searched quite thoroughly for the complete dead we collected fragments". A few days later, on July8, 1918, he was severely wounded when a mortar bomb exploded <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>legs.</b> He was sent to a hospital in Milan where he recuperated for six months; after his return home, he went on a week-long fishing and camping trip in September 1919 with two high school friends to the backcountry near Seney in Michigan's Upper Peninsula—a trip that became the inspiration for [...] "Big Two-Hearted River". The manuscript shows the use of plural pronouns, suggesting that in an early version more characters were included, but by publication any mention of his friends or the townspeople had been removed—leaving Nick alone in the woods.|$|E

500|$|After {{consecutive}} European Cup wins, Guttmann {{approached the}} club's {{board of directors}} asking for a pay rise. As his demand was turned down, he left the club and professed his famous curse. [...] Benfica replaced him with Fernando Riera, and while the Chilean manager led the team to a third-straight European Cup final, he failed to emulate Guttmann's success. On 25 May 1963, against Milan, Benfica's chances were slim after a harsh tackle from Giovanni Trapattoni on Coluna severely debilitated him. In a time when substitutions did not exist, Benfica played {{the rest of the}} match crippled and two second-half goals from José Altafini sent the trophy to Italy. After a poor performance in the 1963–64 European Cup, Benfica returned to the final in the following season. Led by Romanian manager Elek Schwartz, Benfica eliminated Real Madrid 5–1 in the quarter-finals on their way to meet the holders Internazionale in the final, which was played at Inter's home ground, San Siro, in a muddy and waterlogged pitch. A mistake from Alberto da Costa Pereira, allowing a shot from Jair to pass <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>legs,</b> cost Benfica their second attempt at a European Cup treble.|$|E
500|$|Mary is {{the most}} {{prominent}} figure in the composition, taking up much {{of the center of}} the image. [...] She sits directly on the ground without a cushion between herself and the ground, to better communicate the theme of her relationship to the earth. The grass directly below the figure is green, which sharply contrasts to the grassless ground surrounding her, although the green is now darker and less visible than it was originally. [...] Joseph has a higher position in the image compared to Mary, perhaps {{as the head of the}} family, although this is an unusual feature in compositions of the Holy Family. [...] Mary is located <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>legs,</b> as if he is protecting her. [...] There is some debate as to whether Mary is receiving the Christ child from Joseph or vice versa. [...] Saint John the Baptist, the patron saint of Florence, is very commonly included in Florentine works depicting the Madonna and Child. He is in the middle-ground of the painting, between the Holy Family and the background. [...] The elements around the family include plants and perhaps water.|$|E
500|$|Sednaoui {{experimented with}} a variety of {{cinematography}} techniques including wide-angle lenses, shots from below the subjects, superimposition, vertically cut screens displaying different angles of the same shot, reverse film effects, multiple lighting situations and flashy clothing to convey his concept. Frusciante noted the feeling of the video to be extremely vibrant and over the top: [...] "When it was us just painting ourselves silver and wearing these big silver boots and stuff, I mean it felt like glam rock or something." [...] The video begins with a wide-angle shot of Flea in a desert setting wearing pants with several gold colored horns protruding from each leg. The bassist is standing in a meditative stance and brings his arms together above his head when the music begins to play. The video then transitions between a variety of shots edited together that consist of the four band members standing with their eyes closed; the band dancing around in a dimly lit setting; a ground view of Frusciante playing a reflective silver Fender Stratocaster in <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> while wearing pants made up entirely of small pieces of mirror; the band members moving around with full makeup on; and the band members dancing frenziedly. Kiedis adopted a deliberately outlandish wardrobe which incorporated gold lipstick, thinly braided hair, revealing meshed shorts and bright silver boots.|$|E
