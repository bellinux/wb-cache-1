The problem of <b>blind</b> <b>rivets,</b> <b>blind</b> <b>rivet</b> setting, setting equipment, terminology and definitions, characteristic, and special <b>blind</b> <b>rivet</b> setting is also analysed. The experiment itself, the experimental method and the evaluation of the test are described. Mechanism of riveted joint damage produced by galvanic corrosion is proposed. Considerable corrosion damage occurred at combination of the joint members and connected materials with different electrochemical potentials. Exposition to the corroding environment produces release of rivet clam, together with decrease of rivet stiffness.

5000|$|While {{structural}} <b>blind</b> <b>rivets</b> using {{a locked}} mandrel are common, {{there are also}} aircraft applications using [...] "non-structural" [...] <b>blind</b> <b>rivets</b> where the reduced, but still predictable, strength of the rivet without the mandrel is used as the design strength. A method popularized by Chris Heintz of Zenith Aircraft uses a common flat-head (countersunk) rivet which is drawn into a specially machined nosepiece that forms it into a round head rivet, taking up much of the variation inherent in hole size found in amateur aircraft construction. Aircraft designed with these rivets use rivet strength figures measured with the mandrel removed.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Blind</b> <b>rivets,</b> {{commonly}} referred to as [...] "pop" [...] rivets (POP is the brand name of the original manufacturer, now owned by Stanley Engineered Fastening, a division of Stanley Black & Decker) are tubular and are supplied with a mandrel through the center. The rivet assembly is inserted into a hole drilled through the parts to be joined and a specially designed tool is used to draw the mandrel into the rivet. This expands the blind end of the rivet and then the mandrel snaps off. These types of <b>blind</b> <b>rivets</b> have non-locking <b>mandrels</b> and are sometimes avoided for critical structural joints because the mandrels may fall out, due to vibration or other reasons, leaving a hollow rivet that has a lower load-carrying capability than solid rivets. Furthermore, because of the mandrel they are more prone to failure from corrosion and vibration. Unlike solid <b>rivets,</b> <b>blind</b> <b>rivets</b> can be inserted and fully installed in a joint from only one side of a part or structure, [...] "blind" [...] to the opposite side.|$|R

40|$|A <b>blind</b> <b>rivet</b> nut is a {{mechanical}} fastener enabling a fast installation from one side. The setting process relies on plastic deformation due to axial compression of the rivet nut {{in such a}} way that a bulge is formed on the underside of the work piece. The mechanical performance of such a connection partly depends on the final geometry of the rivet nut after forming. In this contribution, the torque-to-turn resistance of an internally threaded round tubular rivet is studied with the aid of finite element techniques. A strategy is presented to simulate the setting process involving large plastic strains and contact pressures. An FE-based inverse method was used to identify the local plastic material properties of the <b>blind</b> <b>rivet</b> nut. The forming simulation was validated in terms of predicted shape of the rivet nut and the evolution of the setting force. A quasi-static FE model using the shape and solution variables of the deformed rivet nut was used to reproduce the torque-to-turn resistance as a function of the setting force. Finally, the aim is to apply the presented modelling strategy to explore innovative possibilities to increase the torque-to-turn resistance of a <b>blind</b> <b>rivet</b> nut. status: accepte...|$|R
40|$|The steel {{thin-walled}} {{structures are}} widespread in civil and industrial engineering nowadays. Self-drilling screws or rivets {{are used to}} interconnect thin-walled elements. <b>Blind</b> <b>rivets</b> and nuts as connectors are considered in the frames of this paper. Rivets have some benefits over self-drilling screws. They are: we can obtain more dense connection when using rivets. So we can increase bearing capacity of connection; a lower cost of riveted connection; a large variety of installation tools for riveted connection: manual, pneumatic, battery; side; an easy installation: access to the connected element is required only from one. These benefits provide increasingly growling popularity to rivets. In the paper 4 types of rivets are considered: combined (aluminum/steel) <b>blind</b> <b>rivets,</b> zinc-coated steel <b>blind</b> <b>rivets,</b> stainless steel <b>blind</b> <b>rivets</b> and <b>blind</b> nuts. The features of each type of rivets are described in the paper. The influence on the behaviour of connections is revealed. The results of experimental research performed by the authors are presented in the paper. A bearing capacity shear of riveted connections is studied in the experiment. There are 3 types of riveted connections subjected to experiment: connection made by blind combined rivets; connection made by zinc-coated steel blind rivets; connection made by blind nuts. A connection between elements with significantly different thicknesses is modeled in the experiment. In reality this situation takes place, for example, in the roofing of buildings, where trapezoidal sheet can be fastened to purlin by rivets. As {{a result of the}} experiment the authors found out that the local deformations occuring under rivet head in the thick element significantly affect the behaviour and bearing capacity of the connection. That’s why the results of connection's bearing capacity obtained in tests were lower than the bearing capacity of rivet declared by manufacturers...|$|R

These splits cause the shaft to fold and flare out (similar to the wings on a toggle bolt's nut) as the mandrel is drawn into the rivet.

On the other side, dynamic properties of joints (for example fatigue and corrosion) significantly affect final function of structures during their service life.

40|$|The {{yield load}} {{equivalent}} for mechanical joints is a characteristic joint value, which appraises the joint specific deformation behavior. The value considers the maximum load {{of a joint}} {{as well as the}} ductility of the joint. Therefore the value is a combined strength / deformation value with high information content. The value guaranties an adequate joint deformation reserve. The shown examples and the application variety prove the adaptability of the yield load equivalent. Those examples as been verified for different fastener types and joint geometries. Based on the appraisal of shear loaded lock bolt and <b>blind</b> <b>rivet</b> joints the yield load equivalent has been used and proven for the appraisal of: 1. punch rivets / self piercing riveting 2. clinching 3. spot welding 4. tension loaded joints 5. peel loaded joints The appraisal of multiple joint specimens was difficult and is now possible with the yield load equivalent. For this kind of joints the yield load equivalent de liver the possibility to describe the complex joint characteristic with one comparable value. The easy appraisal of the transition area between force and form closure is an additional and important issue for the characterization of load bearing characteristic of mechanical joints. Due to this value a comparability of test result is possible without knowledge of the exact test assembly.

The rivet is placed in a drilled hole and is set by pulling the mandrel head into the rivet body, expanding the rivet body and causing it to flare against the reverse side.
