5|$|The first {{international}} cricket match was played <b>between</b> <b>Canada</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States, on 24 and 25 September 1844. However, the first credited Test match was played in 1877 between Australia and England, {{and the two}} teams competed regularly for The Ashes in subsequent years. South Africa was admitted to Test status in 1889. Representative cricket teams were selected to tour each other, resulting in bilateral competition. Cricket was also included as an Olympic sport at the 1900 Paris Games, where Great Britain defeated France to win the gold medal. This was the only appearance of cricket at the Summer Olympics.|$|E
5|$|These laws put U.S.-flagged vessels at an {{economic}} disadvantage against countries lacking such safeguards. By moving their ships to the Panamanian flag, owners could avoid providing these protections. Belen Quezada, the first foreign ship flagged in the Panamanian registry, was employed in running illegal alcohol <b>between</b> <b>Canada</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States during Prohibition. In addition to sidestepping the Seamen's Act, Panamanian-flagged ships in this early period paid sailors on the Japanese wage scale, which was {{much lower than}} that of western merchant powers.|$|E

5|$|The IIHF {{assigned}} Norway's Hans Rønning as {{the referee}} for this game. The assignment was made {{based on his}} neutrality despite his inexperience officiating at the international level. Upon hearing of Rønning's assignment, Canadian representative Dennis McDonald sought out IIHF supervisor of officials, René Fasel, hoping to convince him to select a different referee. Aside from the question of his competence to call a game of this magnitude, the Canadians were concerned about Rønning following an earlier game in the tournament he officiated <b>between</b> <b>Canada</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States. A wild brawl had broken out during the pre-game warm-ups against the Americans three days earlier. The officials {{were not on the}} ice when the melee occurred; however, Rønning ejected one player from each team at random for starting the brawl. Canadian captain Steve Chiasson was thus barred from the game against the Americans, as well as the following game after being assessed a match penalty. Unable to convince IIHF officials to change the assignment, McDonald was concerned about how the game would be played. Rønning's inexperience at that level was later identified as a significant cause of the brawl, as several stick infractions by both sides had gone uncalled, causing anger to rise between both teams.|$|E

25|$|The {{boundary}} <b>between</b> <b>Canada</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States {{along the}} Alaska Panhandle was only vaguely defined then (see Alaska boundary dispute).

25|$|Spanish {{rights in}} the Pacific Northwest were later {{acquired}} by the United States via the Adams-Onís Treaty, signed in 1819. The United States argued that it acquired exclusive sovereignty from Spain, which became {{a key part of}} the American position during the Oregon boundary dispute. In countering the US claim of exclusive sovereignty the British cited the Nootka Conventions. This dispute was not resolved until the signing of the Oregon Treaty in 1846, dividing the disputed territory, and establishing what later became the current international boundary <b>between</b> <b>Canada</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States.|$|E

Prime Minister Sir Charles Tupper then sought British Royal Navy aid in patrolling Canadian fisheries, but his request was rejected. The Canadian government then ordered the construction of three new armed patrol vessels. Petrel was constructed by Polson Iron Works Limited at their shipyard in Owen Sound, Ontario. The vessel entered service in 1892 patrolling the Great Lakes. Petrel was given directives to target illegal fishing by Americans in Canadian waters.|$|E

25|$|During {{these two}} decades, the {{government}} nationalized British Columbia Electric and the British Columbia Power Company, {{as well as}} smaller electric companies, renaming the entity BC Hydro. West Kootenay Power and Light remained independent of BC Hydro, being {{owned and operated by}} Cominco, though tied into the regional power grid. By the end of the 1960s, several major dams had been begun or completed in—among others—the Peace, Columbia, and Nechako River watersheds (the Nechako Diversion to Kemano, was to supply power to the Alcan Inc. aluminum smelter at Kitimat, and {{was not part of the}} provincial power grid but privately owned). Major transmission deals were concluded, most notably the Columbia River Treaty <b>between</b> <b>Canada</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States. The province's economy was also boosted by unprecedented growth in the forest sector, as well as oil and gas development in the province's northeast.|$|E

25|$|Beukema and Saint Lawrence Seaway proponents were {{convinced}} that such a nautical link would lead to development of the communities and economies of the Great Lakes region by enabling ocean-going ships. In this period, grain exports to Europe were highly important to the national economy, along with other commodities. The negotiations on the treaty resumed in 1938 and by January 1940, substantial agreement was reached <b>between</b> <b>Canada</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States. By 1941, President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Mackenzie King made an executive agreement to build the joint hydro and navigation works, but this failed to receive the assent of the U.S. Congress. Proposals for the seaway were met with resistance; primary opposition came from interests representing existing harbors on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts and internal waterways, and from the railroads associations. The railroads carried freight and goods between the coastal ports and the Great Lakes cities.|$|E
25|$|The {{signing of}} the Treaty of Paris in 1783 {{formally}} ended the war. Britain made several concessions to the Americans {{at the expense of}} the North American colonies. Notably, the borders <b>between</b> <b>Canada</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States were officially demarcated; all land south of the Great Lakes, which was formerly a part of the Province of Quebec and included modern day Michigan, Illinois and Ohio, was ceded to the Americans. Fishing rights were also granted to the United States in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and on the coast of Newfoundland and the Grand Banks. The British ignored part of the treaty and maintained their military outposts in the Great Lakes areas it had ceded to the U.S., and they continued to supply their native allies with munitions. The British evacuated the outposts with the Jay Treaty of 1795, but the continued supply of munitions irritated the Americans in the run-up to the War of 1812.|$|E
25|$|By the 1850s, {{fears of}} an American {{invasion}} {{had begun to}} diminish, and the British felt able to start reducing {{the size of their}} garrison. The Reciprocity Treaty, negotiated <b>between</b> <b>Canada</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States in 1854, further helped to alleviate concerns. However, tensions picked up again during the American Civil War (1861–65), reaching a peak with the Trent Affair of late 1861 and early 1862, touched off when the captain of a US gunboat stopped the RMS Trent and removed two Confederate officials who were bound for Britain. The British government was outraged and, with war appearing imminent, took steps to reinforce its North American garrison, increasing it from a strength of 4,000 to 18,000. However, war was averted and the sense of crisis subsided. This incident proved to be the final major episode of Anglo-American military confrontation in North America, as both sides increasingly became persuaded of the benefits of amicable relations. At the same time, many Canadians went south to fight in the Civil War, with most joining the Union side, although some were sympathetic toward the Confederacy.|$|E
