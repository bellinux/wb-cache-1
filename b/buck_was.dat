25|$|The {{function}} of the Master of the Revels was to supervise the arrangements for entertainments presented at court, at the various royal residences or wherever the monarch was in attendance, and to censor plays before they were performed in public theatres. <b>Buck</b> <b>was</b> thus responsible for censoring, among other works, Shakespeare's later plays, and for supervising performances of them and of any earlier Shakespeare plays revived for court performance, which he had to re-censor, due to the regulations added against blasphemy in 1606.

Censorship was exercised in matters of profanity and in sensitive issues of religion and politics, particularly the portrayal of royalty.
