5000|$|Jesse Dukeminier, {{author of}} one of the leading series of {{textbooks}} on property, traces the use of Blackacre and Whiteacre for this purpose to a 1628 treatise by Sir Edward Coke. Dukeminier suggests that the term might originate with references to colors associated with certain crops ("peas and beans are <b>black,</b> <b>corn</b> and potatoes are white, hay is green"), or with the means by which rents were to be paid, with black rents payable in produce and white rents in silver. A 1790 treatise by Francis Buller similarly uses these placeholder names, stating: [...] "If A. have Black Acre and C. have White Acre, and A. has a way over White Acre to Black Acre, and then purchases White Acre, the way will be extinct; and if A. afterwards enfeoff C. of White Acre without excepting the road, it is gone".|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} avoid the loss of {{anthocyanins}} during the preparation of <b>black</b> <b>corn</b> (Zea mays L.) as food, and for the extraction of these metabolites for industrial purposes, it is necessary to determine the effect of several factors that influence its final content. The objective of this work was to extract anthocyanins from <b>black</b> <b>corn</b> cultivated in Tunshi-Chimborazo, Ecuador subjected to different heat treatments for scalding. <b>Black</b> <b>corn</b> seeds were used and planted manually. The corn cobs harvests were subjected to three scalding treatments (immersion in boiling water, steam and microwave with 160 W of power) with three times (3, 5 and 7 minutes). In addition, a control treatment was included without application of heat treatment. The content of total anthocyanins per sample was calculated as cyanidin 3 -glucoside equivalent per kg fresh mass (mg kg- 1). The content of anthocyanins was found to vary with the heat treatment applied. The extraction times conditioned the differences in anthocyanin content only at the extreme values for immersion in boiling water. Heat treatment methods of <b>black</b> <b>corn</b> for sclading such as immersion in boiling water, steam and microwave with 160 W of power condition the anthocyanin content. The maximum reduction of the anthocyanin equivalent content of cyanidin in the <b>black</b> <b>corn</b> grains was obtained in the treatment with immersion in boiling water during 7 min where it was reduced in 79 %, while the preservation in these of the content of anthocyanins was achieved with the use of microwave with 160 W of power for 3 min.   Keywords: microwave, secondary metabolites, Zea may...|$|E

Also, the effects of piperine and pepper oil on growth and aflatoxin production were studied. Under laboratory conditions, black and white pepper supported aflatoxin production (62. 5 and 44 ppb (ng/g), respectively) over 30 days of incubation. Fungal growth measured in terms of chitin was considerably less in white pepper than in black pepper. A histological study of <b>black</b> pepper <b>corn</b> showed the fungus penetrating up to the inner mesocarp and establishing itself in the middle mesocarp. Piperine and pepper oil were found to inhibit fungal growth and toxin production in a dose-dependent manner.
