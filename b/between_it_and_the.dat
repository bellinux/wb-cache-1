5|$|At about 75 Jupiter radii {{from the}} planet, the {{interaction}} of the magnetosphere with the solar wind generates a bow shock. Surrounding Jupiter's magnetosphere is a magnetopause, located at the inner edge of a magnetosheath—a region <b>between</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> bow shock. The solar wind interacts with these regions, elongating the magnetosphere on Jupiter's lee side and extending it outward until it nearly reaches the orbit of Saturn. The four largest moons of Jupiter all orbit within the magnetosphere, which protects them from the solar wind.|$|E
5|$|During gunnery {{trials in}} March 1880 shortly after {{entering}} service, one of Caio Duilios guns in her aft turret burst. After joining the fleet, both ships {{served in the}} Active Squadron, though they alternated <b>between</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Reserve Squadron throughout their careers. During this period, they were chiefly occupied with conducting training maneuvers. Italy joined the Triple Alliance with the German Empire and Austria-Hungary in 1882, shortly after the two Caio Duilios entered service; as a result, the country's most likely opponent became France. The exercises in which the ships took part therefore frequently simulated defensive operations against a hostile, numerically superior French Mediterranean Fleet. For the 1893 maneuvers, Caio Duilio {{was part of the}} squadron that simulated the defending Italian fleet, while Enrico Dandolo operated on the opposing force.|$|E

It returned in June 1994 and completed airing its initial production run. The Critic was moved to the Fox network for its second season.

Antarctica's status is regulated by the 1959 Antarctic Treaty and other related agreements, collectively called the Antarctic Treaty System. Antarctica is defined as all land and ice shelves south of 60° S {{for the purposes of}} the Treaty System. The treaty was signed by twelve countries including the Soviet Union (and later Russia), the United Kingdom, Argentina, Chile, Australia, and the United States. It set aside Antarctica as a scientific preserve, established freedom of scientific investigation and environmental protection, and banned military activity on Antarctica. This was the first arms control agreement established during the Cold War.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{named the}} Muskegon, Grand Traverse and Northport State Road, {{and later the}} Newaygo and Northport State Road, today's modern highway {{can be traced back}} to the 19th century and earlier. The southernmost section between Grand Rapids and Battle Creek {{parallels}} an early Indian trail. The modern highway was formed by July 1, 1919 along this segment. By the 1940s, a second section of highway was designated M-37, creating a gap <b>between</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> original section. This gap was eliminated in the 1950s, completing the M-37 corridor in the state. Additional changes to the routing were made through the Grand Rapids area into the 1970s.|$|E

5|$|The Danish {{name is not}} unexpected; the {{language}} of the Ormulum, an East Midlands dialect, is stringently of the Danelaw (Bennett and Smithers 1982, pp.174–75). It includes numerous Old Norse phrases (particularly doublets, where an English and Old Norse term are co-joined), but there are very few Old French influences on Orm's language (Bennett 1986, p.33). Another—likely previous—East Midlands work, the Peterborough Chronicle, shows a great deal of French influence. The linguistic contrast <b>between</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> work of Orm demonstrates both the sluggishness of the Norman influence in the formerly Danish areas of England and the assimilation of Old Norse features into early Middle English (Bennett 1986, pp.259–63).|$|E
5|$|The airline was {{established}} {{in response to the}} opening of Gardermoen, which would allow any airline sufficient landing slots to compete with the incumbents Braathens and Scandinavian Airlines (SAS). Color Air commenced operations on 1 August 1998, with the two other airlines moving from Oslo Airport, Fornebu on 8 October. Following the airline's establishment, a price war broke out <b>between</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> two incumbents. All three increased capacity and dropped prices, giving a 40% increase in seats on the dominant domestic routes and seat loads of between 30 and 50 percent. After thirteen months and NOK400 million in losses, Color Air gave up and filed for bankruptcy. The price war cost the three airlines more than NOK3 billion, and ultimately forced the other two to merge.|$|E

The upper and lower jaws each have 13 or 14 teeth (usually 14 in the upper and 13 in the lower). The upper teeth are triangular with slanted cusps, while the bottom teeth have narrower, erect cusps. The tooth serrations are larger in the upper jaw than in the lower. The first dorsal fin is medium-sized, {{and there is no}} ridge running <b>between</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> second dorsal fin. The pectoral fins are narrow and falcate (sickle-shaped).|$|E
40|$|Abstract Thellungiella salsuginea (Brassiaceae) is {{a typical}} {{halophyte}} which can tolerate extreme cold, drought, and salinity. In {{order to understand the}} adaptive evolution of this species in the arid habitats, {{it is important to know}} its genetic structure. In this study, 17 polymorphic micro-satellite loci were isolated and characterized from an enrichment genomic library of this species. We further assessed the polymorphisms of each locus in 18 individuals from nine geographically distant populations. The number of alleles per locus ranged from six to fourteen. <b>The</b> observed <b>and</b> expected heterozygosity ranged from 0. 17 to 0. 28 and 0. 32 to 0. 45, respectively. These markers have been crossly checked in another congeneric species, T. halophila.
