40|$|Stretch <b>blow</b> <b>moulding</b> is {{a widely}} used {{technique}} e. g. {{for the production of}} PET bottles. In a stretch <b>blow</b> <b>moulding</b> process a hot preform of polymer is simultaneously stretched and <b>blown</b> into a <b>mould</b> shape. The process takes place at a fast rate and is characterised by large deformations and temperature gradients. In this paper a computer simulation model for stretch <b>blow</b> <b>moulding</b> is presented. The model is based on finite element methods and uses a level set method to track the interfaces between air, polymer and stretch rod. The PET behaviour is modelled as a non-newtonian, isothermal fluid flow, based on a viscoplastic material model. An application presented is the stretch <b>blow</b> <b>moulding</b> of a realistic PET water bottle. The model is validated by verifying volume conservation...|$|R
40|$|Conventionally, stretch <b>blow</b> <b>moulds</b> for bottles are {{designed}} as three moulding blocks. The first moulding block {{is the bottom}} of the bottle with integrated cooling. The other moulding blocks are the outside shape of the part, mostly related to the design aspect of the bottle and limited cooling. Where it concerns optimizing the cycle time and the related quality of <b>blow</b> <b>moulded</b> products, it is essential to modify the mould design, manufacturing and final applied mould materials. The thermal characteristics of several conventional, high-tech and rapid tooling mould materials have been analysed. These results are implemented in the final mould design strategy for <b>blow</b> <b>moulding,</b> having in mind the effect on the final cooling time and related part quality. To achieve optimal integration of mould design issues such as conformal cooling and mould material selection, a modular and fast exchange design principle for <b>blow</b> <b>moulding</b> of hybrid moulds is developed at University College Ghent.

40|$|Purpose: The {{main purpose}} of the {{performed}} investigations was a multi-aspect analyzes of the <b>blow</b> <b>moulding</b> process in a mould which takes two-stage nature {{of the process and}} the occurrence of uncontrolled phenomena which influence the shape, size and quality of the products into consideration. Design/methodology/approach: The value for the Barus number for different dimensions of the nozzle gap and the distribution of the temperature field during <b>blow</b> <b>moulding</b> process have been determined; the product thickness profile has been defined; phenomena which occur during blowing stage have been registered. The investigations have been performed by means of the <b>blow</b> <b>moulding</b> machine of UFP- 05 type by IPTS – Metalchem Toruń using the designed and prepared <b>blow</b> <b>mould</b> with the sight-glass made of polycarbonate. Findings: The performed investigations enabled the insight study of uncontrolled phenomena which occur during each individual stage of the process and they showed the dependencies between these phenomena and the process parameters. Moreover, the detailed analyses enabled to determine the influence of these parameters on the physical features and dimensions of the finished goods. Research limitations/implications: The continuation of the investigations with use of extended <b>blow</b> <b>mould</b> design equipped in polycarbonate sight-glass which enabled the determination of the influence of the structure and mould cavity dimensions on the finished product wall thickness seems to be justified. It would be also useful to design the station for the precise non-touch measurements of Barus effect which enabled, except the measurements of the external diameter, the measurements of the finished product wall thickness.

40|$|Injection <b>moulding</b> and <b>blow</b> <b>moulding</b> are {{probably}} the most widely used process for manufacturing parts by using plastic materials. A wide variety of products are manufactured by using these two technologies, which vary greatly in their size, complexity, and application. The injection moulding process requires the use of an injection moulding machine, raw plastic material and a mould. The process cycle for injection moulding consists of the following four stages: clamping, injection, cooling and ejection. <b>Blow</b> <b>moulding</b> is a manufacturing process that is used to create hollow plastic parts by inflating a heated plastic tube until it fills a mould and forms the desired shape. The manufacturing process is divided into three stages: injection, blowing and ejection. There are many types of materials that may be used in the injection <b>moulding</b> and <b>blow</b> <b>moulding</b> process. Most polymers may be used, including all thermoplastics, some thermosets, and some elastomers. Injection moulding industry is used to create many things such as milk cartons, packaging, bottle caps, automotive dashboards, pocket combs, and most other plastic products available today. Parts made from <b>blow</b> <b>moulding</b> are plastic, hollow, and thin-walled, such as bottles and containers that are available in a variety of shapes and sizes.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Plastics fuel tanks have been used successfully abroad; metal counterparts are still predominant in this country plastics tanks have to satisfy stringent performance regulations : low temperature impact tests; permeability; and fire resistance. <b>Blow</b> <b>moulded</b> high density polyethylene (HDPE) fuel tanks have superior strength to mass ratio compared with metal equivalents (the density of steel is about 8000 kg/m 3 compared with HDPE, which has a density of under 1000 kg/m 3). HDPE will tend to drip in a fire situation, thus reducing explosion risk. HDPE is the chosen material because it possesses inherent properties suitable for the <b>blow</b> <b>moulding</b> process : it has a high viscosity at low stresses; and is highly inert. Rotational moulded HDPE fuel tanks can also be considered. However, these are shown to have inferior properties when compared with <b>blow</b> <b>moulded</b> tanks; attraction of rotational moulding is the cheapness of equipment. Petrol immersion was found to enhance impact properties of HDPE, although yield stresses were lowered slightly. The thickness distributions of <b>blow</b> <b>moulded</b> fuel tanks were found to vary; {{this is because of}} the present difficulty of predicting parison behaviour with respect to time. Thickness is important because of impact strength and permeation considerations. Impact properties of fuel tanks were assessed; peak force of impact was found to be heavily dependent on thickness (raised to the power 1. 1) and temperature of <b>mould</b> in the <b>blow</b> <b>moulding</b> process (a low mould temperature led to inferior properties). Pinch-offs were found to be particularly detrimental to impact properties. Cooling behaviour was investigated. With the aid of a cooling model for blow mouldings, it was found that a warm mould (40 ·C) could be used with internal air circulation to obtain a cooling time the same as that with a cold mould and no air circulation. Thus optimising mechanical strength and maintaining economic viability. Welding of injection moulded fittings to the main <b>blow</b> <b>moulded</b> body of the fuel tank was found to be faulty, in all of the tanks examined; many weld failures have been reported in use.

To quantify the achievable improvements with the cross-corrugated absorbing and <b>bottom</b> <b>plates,</b> flat-plate solar air-heaters which have both a flat absorbing plate and a flat <b>bottom</b> <b>plate,</b> are also considered. The thermal performance of these three types of solar air-heaters are analyzed, measured and compared under several configurations and operating conditions. All the analytical and experimental results show that, although the thermal performance of the type 2 heater is just slightly superior to that of the type 1 heater, both of these cross-corrugated solar air-heaters have a much superior thermal performances to that of the flat-plate one. It is also found that the use of selected coatings on the absorbing plates of all the heaters considered can substantially enhance the thermal performances of the heaters, whereas such a selected coating on the <b>bottom</b> <b>plates</b> or/and the glass covers does not have such a significant effect on the thermal performances of the heaters.
