5|$|However, {{this plan}} only applied to men manning {{the walls of}} the fort, not the artillerymen who would <b>be</b> <b>serving</b> the fort's guns.

These crews would be permanently located at the fort, unlike the men assigned to {{the walls of the}} fort. To fire Fort Greble's planned complement of 15 guns, Barnard assigned 255 artillerymen. This plan was affected by the needs of the war. As the fighting dragged on and casualties mounted, the various commanders of the Army of the Potomac repeatedly raided the Washington garrison for trained artillerymen and infantry replacements. By 1864, Washington had been stripped to a total less than half that of Barnard's 1861 recommendation.|$|E
