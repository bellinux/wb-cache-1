It moved west to southwest through an unfavorable environment. On the morning of July 27, it dissipated due to strong wind shear caused by an upper-level trough. The system never impacted land, thus no damage was reported.|$|E
5|$|The 300-seat {{theater was}} {{designed}} by Charles A. Duke in 1913 and opened in 1915 as The Clinton. Its main entrance faced 26th Avenue until 1922. The venue {{became known as the}} 26th Avenue Theatre in 1945 and the Encore in 1969, before reverting to a variation of its original name on May 30, 1975. At that time, a five-person collective bought the theater. The movie house had <b>been</b> <b>showing</b> X-rated films, which the collective replaced {{with a wide variety of}} movies including foreign films, The Rocky Horror Picture Show, and older films like The African Queen.|$|E
5|$|The Nightmare Before Christmas was reissued by Disney {{under the}} Walt Disney Pictures banner and re-released on October 20, 2006, with {{conversion}} to Disney Digital 3-D.

The El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood, California has <b>been</b> <b>showing</b> the film in 4-D screenings annually in October, ending on Halloween, since 2010.

However, Natasha continues {{to see him in}} secret and when Ivan asks her for some naked pictures, she sends him some. Natasha learns Ivan has <b>been</b> <b>showing</b> the pictures to his friends and that they are on the internet. She initially lies to Michael about who took the photos, but Michael learns the truth from Ivan. Natasha becomes desperate to win her father's favour back and she sprays the street with derogatory graffiti about herself. However, Michael discovers she was responsible for the graffiti and he disowns her. After she is taunted about her appearance, Natasha decides to get rhinoplasty and uses Michael's credit card to pay the deposit. Natasha then sells some of her father's records to raise the money and Michael decides to send her to a boarding school. He changes his mind after Natasha nearly drowns in the pool at Number 30 and their relationship begins to improve.|$|E

25|$|Mangubat {{was born}} on December 21, 1990, and raised in Calamba City, Laguna, Philippines.

25|$|Regardless of {{the success}} that Parker and Presley had achieved, Parker was still {{struggling}} to believe that Presley's career would last longer than a year or two. He had seen many acts come and go during his earlier years in management, and felt that to think that Presley, despite being Parker's most successful act to date, would be any different, was foolish. In January 1958 Presley received his draft notice from the United States Army. He was upset {{about the possibility of}} it affecting his career, but Parker was secretly overjoyed. Presley had <b>been</b> <b>showing</b> signs of rebellion against him recently, and Parker believed that a stint in the Army would cure him of this.|$|E

Early development work on the Avro 720 was also proceeding smoothly; by 1956, the first prototype was claimed to have been virtually completed and that Avro viewed it as being capable of flying up to a year ahead of the rival SR.53. However, neither development programmes had managed to secure the backing of the Royal Air Force (RAF), which had <b>been</b> <b>showing</b> signs of hesitancy and had apparent intentions to wait until after both aircraft flight evaluations had been conducted before the service would expressly make any determination on its preference.|$|E

25|$|While white Cuban {{elites and}} their colonial administrators debated {{civil rights and}} public policy, black Cubans had already <b>been</b> <b>showing</b> initiative. The first step toward {{property}} rights came when farm owners allowed their slaves to own a pig. A pig could grow, accrue value, be sold for profit or consumed. Many people quickly seized upon the potential of this and began raising as many pigs as possible, even feeding them from their own rations to keep them growing. The pigs would then be sold to either the plantation owner or someone else, and a profit would be made. These profits would sometimes parlay into the ownership of a horse, which implied {{a certain degree of}} freedom and mobility. Worker mobility was also important in spreading information (concerning revolution, property rights, etc.) to other interested communities.|$|E
25|$|The {{immediate}} {{cause of the}} disaster was identified as the Turbo train passing signal SN109 (located on an overhead gantry—gantry 8—with four other signals serving other tracks) at which {{it should have been}} held. It was established that the signal had <b>been</b> <b>showing</b> a red aspect, and the preceding signal (SN87) had <b>been</b> <b>showing</b> a single yellow which should have led the driver to be prepared for a red at SN109. Since the Thames Turbo driver, 31-year-old Michael Hodder, had been killed in the accident, {{it was not possible to}} establish why he had passed the signal at danger. However, Hodder was inexperienced, having qualified as a driver only two weeks before the crash. His driver training was found to be defective, whilst the signalling in the Paddington area was known to have caused problems – SN109 had been passed at danger on eight occasions in six years, but Hodder had no specific warning of this. Furthermore, 5 October 1999 was a day of bright sunshine and at just past 8 o'clock the sun would have been low and behind Hodder, with low sunlight reflecting off yellow aspects. Poor signal placement meant that Hodder would have seen sunlit yellow aspects of SN109 at a point where his view of the red aspect of SN109 (but not of any other signal on the gantry) was still obstructed. The inquiry considered it more probable than not that the poor sighting of SN109, both in itself and in comparison with the other signals on and at gantry 8, allied to the effect of bright sunlight at a low angle, were factors which had led Hodder to believe that he had a proceed aspect. Since 1998 a campaign to have the signal SN109 properly sited had been running, and the Bristol HST drivers were re-routed as not to pass this signal.|$|E
25|$|By 18:42 on 27 August {{there had}} been two {{earthquakes}} in the caldera above M5 and about 1300 events {{in the range of}} M2-3 around the tip of the dyke which had propagated a further 1km to the north and now extended some 13km past the edge of the glacier. Approximately another 20million cubic metres of magma had entered the dyke over the previous 24 hours. The intrusion of the dyke was now causing stress changes over a large area {{to the north of the}} dyke's extent. A M4.5 event was recorded just east of the Askja caldera, which had <b>been</b> <b>showing</b> signs of increased geothermal activity since April 2012. At 20:50, scientists on a surveillance flight reported a 4–6km line of 10–15m deep cauldrons to the south of the Bárðarbunga caldera, which were possibly a result of melting or a sub glacial eruption, although they didn't know when they had formed. No heightened tremor level was observed.|$|E
