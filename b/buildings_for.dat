5|$|At Hanford, top {{priority}} was initially {{given to the}} installations in the 300 area. This contained <b>buildings</b> <b>for</b> testing materials, preparing uranium, and assembling and calibrating instrumentation. One of the buildings housed the canning equipment for the uranium slugs, while another contained a small test reactor. Notwithstanding the high priority allocated to it, work on the 300 area fell behind schedule due to the unique and complex nature of the 300 area facilities, and wartime shortages of labor and materials.|$|E
5|$|Bramantyo {{attempted}} to make his film as historically accurate as possible. However, as no documentation of Dahlan's life {{before he went to}} Mecca exists, the scenes showing Dahlan's youth were fictionalized. The script underwent 12 revisions before the film was completed. Much of the film's budget of Rp. 12 billion (US$ 1.3 million) was spent on costumes and sets to ensure accuracy. The crew restored several old <b>buildings</b> <b>for</b> their shots and custom-ordered 19th-century style traditional garments for their scenes.|$|E

5|$|Imaginative spectators {{would climb}} {{the church and}} watch a {{football}} game from the rooftop however they have now been deterred from doing so with the installation of security measures such as barbed wire and anti-climb paint. In addition, {{the introduction of the}} 'all-seater' ruling following the Taylor Report has meant that spectators no longer resort to climbing nearby <b>buildings</b> <b>for</b> a glimpse of the event as a seat is guaranteed with a purchased ticket.|$|E

Neither was constructed.|$|E
5|$|The Socialist-dominated French {{authorities}} actively supported PADESM. The French characterized {{this support}} {{as an effort}} to champion the oppressed masses and strengthen their protection against exploitative Hova elites. Governor General Jules Marcel de Coppet provided the party with space in public <b>buildings</b> <b>for</b> meetings. PADESM candidates in the January 1947 provincial elections received financial support from French settlers owing to the party's favorable disposition to the French administration.|$|E
5|$|The State Secretary and {{assistant}} to Vanhanen, Risto Volanen, said that attacks on schools {{could no longer}} be considered isolated incidents, and that police and security forces had to approach them with a new perspective in the aftermath of Kauhajoki. In December 2009, plans were announced to include an emergency SMS system in schools, more emergency exits, and better access to the architectural lay-out of school <b>buildings</b> <b>for</b> police.

5|$|The {{level was}} {{designed}} by Jordan Thomas and Randy Smith, with a soundscape composed by Eric Brosius. Using theories of interactive horror design developed by Smith in 2000, the team sought to create the scariest level ever to appear in a game. They took influence from works such as House of Leaves, Session 9 and the Silent Hill series, and they studied mental asylums and reportedly haunted <b>buildings</b> <b>for</b> inspiration.|$|E
5|$|The lower-level <b>buildings</b> <b>for</b> Humans and Orcs {{have the}} same functions, but {{different}} sprites. The Town Hall stores resources and produces units that collect resources and construct buildings. Each Farm provides food for up to four units, and additional units cannot be produced until enough Farms are built. The Barracks produces all non-magical combat units, including melee, ranged, mounted, and siege units. However all except the most basic also need assistance from other buildings, some of which can also upgrade units.|$|E

The Town Center can fire arrows at enemy units within range if villagers or archers are garrisoned while under attack. Other economic buildings available include storage <b>buildings</b> <b>for</b> resources, farms, docks (the dock may also produce several military ships), and houses to support a higher population.|$|E

5|$|Christian baptisteries and shrines were domed in the 4th century, {{such as the}} Lateran Baptistery and {{the likely}} wooden dome over the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.

The first domed basilica may have been built in the 5th century, with a church in southern Turkey being the earliest proposed example, but the 6th century architecture of Justinian made domed church architecture standard throughout the Roman east. His Hagia Sophia and Church of the Holy Apostles inspired copies in later centuries.|$|E
