40|$|AbstractThe HTS {{power cable}} is cooled by the {{circulation}} of liquid nitrogen. The cooling capacity of refrigerator increases with cable length. As the length of power cable increases, a <b>joint</b> <b>box</b> should be installed to reduce the cooling capacity and pressure drop for unit cooling system. The type of <b>joint</b> <b>box</b> {{can be divided into}} two groups. There are NJB(Normal <b>Joint</b> <b>Box)</b> and SJB(Stop <b>Joint</b> <b>Box).</b> Generally, SJB can separate each cooling system. In case of long distance DC cable, it is necessary to separate the cooling line in the regular distance of cooling system so SJB should be used. However, SJB, which has a difference from the insulation method of existing <b>joint</b> <b>box,</b> uses solid electrical insulation method. At the primary cooling time, thermal stress is generated by the temperature difference between the internal and external epoxy. So to prevent the damage stress analysis is required for the electrical insulation structure of SJB. In this paper, using the FEM analysis we study the cooling method and optimal shape of SJB to reduce the thermal stress result from temperature difference during the cooling time...|$|R

Previous work represented clothing regions by either bounding <b>boxes</b> or human <b>joints.</b> This work presents fashion landmark detection or fashion alignment, which is to predict the positions of functional key points defined on the fashion items, such as the corners of neckline, hemline, and cuff. To encourage future studies, we introduce a fashion landmark dataset with over 120 K images, where each image is labeled with eight landmarks. With this dataset, we study fashion alignment by cascading multiple convolutional neural networks in three stages. These stages gradually improve the accuracies of landmark predictions.

Eventually, the Corps solidified its various teachings into the LINE combat system, but its inherent inflexibility was evident. In 2001, the Marine Corps initiated a new program, called Marine Corps Martial Arts Program (MCMAP). Due to an expectation that urban and police-type peacekeeping missions would become more common in the 21st century, placing Marines in even closer contact with unarmed civilians, MCMAP was implemented to provide Marines with a larger and more versatile set of less-than-lethal options for controlling hostile, but unarmed individuals.

The Marine Corps Martial Arts program is an eclectic mix of different styles of martial arts melded together and consists of <b>boxing</b> movements, <b>joint</b> locking techniques, opponent weight transfer (Jujitsu), ground grappling (mostly wrestling), bayonet, knife and baton fighting, non-compliance joint manipulations, and blood restriction chokes.

Typically, the normal approximation does not mean convergence. We show that the convergence of the full vector of counts only holds under a condition of regular variation, thus giving a complete characterization of possible limit correlation structures...|$|R
40|$|Decontamination is a {{combination}} of processes (including cleaning, disinfection and/or sterilization) used to render a reusable item safe for return to the operating theatre. Critical to this process are the prevention of drying and the implementation of an effective washer-disinfector process commonly utilizing enzymatic or alkaline detergents within an automated cycle. At this stage the choice of the main wash chemistry is crucial. A balance must be obtained between the vigorous removal of often dense contamination and the maintenance of surface integrity and instrument function. However, ineffective cleaning of surgical instruments may be a vector for the transmission of hospital acquired infections and assessment of cleaning efficacy is dependent on the minimal level of detection of the analytical method. Currently, following disinfection, instruments are subjected to visual evaluation often using magnifying/illuminated lenses to detect any evidence of residual soiling of damage whereby instruments are reprocessed or discarded. Although this method is clearly both rapid and simple to perform it undoubtedly suffers from serious issues of variability and sensitivity, in addition to being non-quantitative. Whilst this method readily detects the haem pigment in haemoglobin to levels as low as 10 ?g/cm 2, bodily fluids without pigments are more difficult to visualise (REF?). Cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) is both colourless and odourless and {{has been shown to be}} a carrier of prion disease infection. Due to the realisation of these facts, European guidelines ISO EN 15883 and the British Health Technical Memorandum (HTM) 2030 outline two techniques for the further assessment of instrument cleanliness: the Biuret and Ninhydrin test kits. Both require prior swabbing of an instrument surface to obtain a result and are based on colorimetric chemical changes although the methodologies behind these reactions differ. The Biuret technique utilises the reaction of copper ions with peptide bonds under alkaline conditions to form a complex which is then added to bicinchoninic acid (BCA) causing a purple colour change that can be readily visualised. The Ninhydrin test kit uses a reaction of amino acids, peptides and proteins with 1, 2, 3 -indantrione monohydrate followed by a 30 min incubation at 110 ºC, although a Ninhydrin gel kit can also be used requiring incubation at only 57 ºC for 60 min. However, a recent study has shown that both the Biuret and Ninhydrin tests suffer from poor sensitivity, demonstrating a minimum level of detection by 75 % of volunteers of 6. 7 ?g and 9. 25 ?g of protein, respectively, on surgical grade stainless steel tokens 1. The authors suggests that, as a result, large amounts of protein (up to 6. 5 ?g) may remain undetected, therefore seriously underestimating levels of residual contamination. In practice, sensitivity is likely to be reduced further due to the difficulty in swabbing areas of surgical instruments such as teeth and <b>box</b> <b>joints</b> where contamination is likely to be harder to remove for analysis...|$|R

SETTING: Research laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: Volunteer sample of 7 women with pain (positive pain drawing, no physical examination) and 9 female controls (not matched). INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Duration of downward and upward phases, relative instant of <b>box</b> lift-off, <b>joint</b> angles, spatial angles of trunk and pelvis, pelvic angle relative to trunk, and phase angle relationships between joints. RESULTS: The duration of the upward phase +/- standard deviation was longer in the pain group (1731 +/- 290 ms vs 1489 +/- 187 ms, P=. 031). At box lift-off, this group had less hip joint flexion (101. 9 degrees +/- 20. 8 degrees vs 78. 7 degrees +/- 12. 4 degrees, P=. 015) but more backward pelvis tilt relative to the trunk, that is, more lumbar spine flexion (126. 3 degrees +/- 16. 8 degrees vs 109. 0 degrees +/- 12. 3 degrees, P=. 031). The pain group showed an immediate transition from lumbar spine flexion to extension, whereas the controls maintained peak flexion for about 600 ms. The peak phase lag between knee and hip joint extension in the upward phase was larger for the pain group (- 29. 7 degrees +/- 8. 3 degrees vs - 17. 2 degrees +/- 5. 5 degrees, P=. 003).

40|$|A kinematically {{redundant}} robot {{with limited}} motion capabilities, expressed by inequality {{constraints of the}} <b>box</b> type on <b>joint</b> variables and commands, needs to perform a set of tasks, expressed by linear equality constraints on robot commands, possibly organized with priorities. Robot motion capabilities cannot be exceeded at any time, and the resulting constraints are to be considered as hard bounds. Instead, robot tasks can be relaxed by velocity scaling if no feasible solution exists. To address this redundancy resolution problem, we developed a method in which joint space commands are successively saturated and their effect compensated in the null space of a suitable task Jacobian (SNS, Saturation in the Null Space). Computationally efficient versions of the basic and optimal SNS algorithms are proposed here, based on a task augmentation reformulation, a QR factorization of the main matrices involved, and a so-called warm start procedure.

Unlike other complex pattern recognition algorithms, the statistical technique {{described in this}} article is model-independent. This avoids the need to generate accurate numerical models of the structure which is time and resource intensive. Instead, the training data for the damage detection engine is derived from actual measurements of the virgin (undamaged) structure using embedded sensors. The sensor measurements are normalized to remove the effect of varying loads acting on the structure and desensitized to reduce the probability of false alarm before being used to train the statistical engine. Damage detection is based on box plot outlier analysis, and damage location is determined by knowing the absolute spatial positions of the embedded sensors. This technique has been applied to both simulated and experimental data for joints made of glass fiber reinforced polymer composite, and {{has been shown to be}} effective in the automated characterization of disbonds with an acceptable level of accuracy.

Despite {{the gravity of the}} disease, the current knowledge on its molecular pathogenesis is still inadequate to improve the disease management. The present study seeks to understand the molecular mechanism of NPC, with an aim to identify potential therapeutic targets or biomarkers. From a previous expression microarray study, Four – <b>Jointed</b> <b>Box</b> 1 (FJX 1) gene was found to be upregulated in NPC compared to non-cancerous controls with negligible expression in 5 vital normal human organs. Human FJX 1 is a Drosophila orthologue of four-jointed (fj) gene which codes for a Golgi-resident kinase that phosphorylates specific cadherin domains and functions downstream of the Notch and Hippo signaling pathways. The overexpression of FJX 1 in primary NPC tissues was confirmed at both mRNA and protein levels, while its low expression was validated in 16 normal human organs. Both overexpression and knockdown experiments showed that FJX 1 increased the aggressiveness of NPC cells by promoting cell proliferation, invasion and anchorageindependent growth. Concomitant change of Cyclins D 1 and E 1 levels were observed with FJX 1 level, suggesting FJX 1 enhances cell proliferation through cell cycle regulation.
