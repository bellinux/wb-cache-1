5|$|Due to the {{determined}} {{resistance of}} the 99th Division, which was composed of relatively inexperienced troops, along with the experienced 2nd and 30th Divisions, the northern shoulder of the Battle of the <b>Bulge</b> was a sticking point for the entire offensive operation.

We {{present a}} classication for <b>bulges</b> of a com-plete sample of 1350 edge-on disk galaxies {{derived from the}} RC 3 (Third Reference Catalogue of Bright Galaxies, de Vaucouleurs et al. 1991). A visual classication of the <b>bulges</b> using the Digitized Sky Survey (DSS) in three types of b/p <b>bulges</b> or as an {{elliptical}} type is presented and sup-ported by CCD images. NIR observations reveal that dust extinction does almost not influence the shape of <b>bulges.</b> There is no substantial dierence between the shape of <b>bulges</b> in the optical and in the NIR. Our analysis reveals that 45 % of all <b>bulges</b> are box- and peanut-shaped (b/p). The frequency of b/p <b>bulges</b> for all morphological types from S 0 to Sd is> 40 %. In particular, {{this is for the}} rst time that such a large frequency of b/p <b>bulges</b> is reported for galaxies as late as Sd.

40|$|The {{factors that}} {{influence}} inverse <b>bulging</b> effect during sheet hydro-mechanical deep drawing are especially researched in this paper. According to the different inverse <b>bulging</b> process, two modes can be singled: the initial inverse <b>bulging</b> (IIB) and the local inverse <b>bulging</b> (LIB). IIB includes two parameters: inverse <b>bulging</b> height ratio (HIb/t) and inverse <b>bulging</b> pressure ratio (PIb/t). LIB is influenced by IIB and has a direct relationship with liquid chamber pressure in the forming process. The optimal inverse <b>bulging</b> parameters of hemispherical bottom cylindrical part and flat bottom cylindrical part are obtained by numerical simulation. Process parameters including the clearance between the punch and the blank holder and the blank holder entrance radius that have a large influence on inverse <b>bulging</b> effect are optimized, {{so as to make}} inverse <b>bulging</b> effect behave better in hydroforming process. Finally, the accuracy of the numerical simulation results was verified by experiments...|$|R

5|$|The US {{casualty}} count at Yongsan is also {{difficult to}} know, as the division's scattered units were engaged {{all along the}} Naktong <b>Bulge</b> without communication and total casualty counts in each area could not be ascertained. The US 2nd Infantry Division suffered 1,120 killed, 2,563 wounded, 67 captured and 69 missing during its time at the Second Battle of Naktong <b>Bulge.</b> This included about 180 casualties it suffered during the First Battle of Naktong <b>Bulge</b> the previous month. American forces were continually repulsed but able to prevent the North Koreans from breaking the Pusan Perimeter. The division had numbered 17,498 on September 1, but was in excellent position to attack despite its casualties. The 1st Provisional Marine Brigade suffered 185 killed and around 500 wounded during the Battle of Pusan Perimeter, most of which probably occurred at Yongsan.|$|E

50|$|Conserved <b>bulges</b> {{regularly}} affect protein functionality. The {{most basic}} function of <b>bulges</b> is to accommodate an extra residue added due to mutation etc., {{while maintaining the}} bonding pattern and thus the overall protein architecture.

5|$|American counterattacks {{continued}} into the morning of August 7, but the gains were slow, hampered by the hot weather {{and a lack of}} food and water. The North Koreans were able to press forward and regain the Cloverleaf Hill and Oblong-ni Ridge, critical terrain astride the main road in the <b>bulge</b> area. By 16:00 that day, the 9th Infantry Regiment, 2nd US Infantry Division, a unit newly arrived in Korea, was sent to the region. Church immediately ordered it to attack the North Korean salient at the <b>bulge.</b> 9th Infantry was fresh and well-equipped. They were also inexperienced, many of their number being reservists. Despite a tenacious attack, the 9th Infantry was only able to regain part of Cloverleaf Hill before intense fighting stalled its movement.|$|E

40|$|We take {{advantage}} of the exceptional depth of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF) images and the deep GRism ACS Program for Extragalactic Science (GRAPES) grism spectroscopy to explore the stellar populations of 34 <b>bulges</b> belonging to late-type galaxies at 0. 8 ≤z ≤ 1. 3. We selected these galaxies based on the presence of a noticeable Balmer break (at 4000 ˚A) in their GRAPES spectra, and by visual inspection of the HUDF images. The narrow extraction of these GRAPES spectra around the galaxy center enable us to study the spectrum of the <b>bulges</b> in these late-type galaxies. The 4000 ˚A break in the <b>bulges</b> spectra allows us to estimate the <b>bulges</b> redshifts and stellar ages. We first used the HUDF images to measure <b>bulges</b> color and Sérsic index, and then we analyze the <b>bulges</b> spectra by fitting stellar population models. Our results show that, (1) the average age of late-type <b>bulges</b> in our sample is ∼ 1. 3 Gyr and stellar masses are in the range of 10 6. 5 - 10 10 M⊙, (2) late-type <b>bulges</b> are younger and less massive compared to <b>bulges</b> in early-type galaxies at similar redshifts, (3) <b>bulges</b> and inner disks in these late-type galaxies show similar dominant stellar populations, suggestive of an inside-out formation scenario, and (4) late-type <b>bulges</b> are better fitted by exponential surface brightness profiles. The overall picture emerging from the GRAPES data is that, in late-type galaxies at z ≃ 1, <b>bulges</b> form through secular evolution and disks via an inside-out process...|$|R

5|$|Spiral galaxies {{consist of}} a {{rotating}} disk of stars and interstellar medium, along with a central <b>bulge</b> of generally older stars. Extending outward from the <b>bulge</b> are relatively bright arms. In the Hubble classification scheme, spiral galaxies are listed as type S, followed by a letter (a, b, or c) that indicates the degree of tightness of the spiral arms {{and the size of}} the central <b>bulge.</b> An Sa galaxy has tightly wound, poorly defined arms and possesses a relatively large core region. At the other extreme, an Sc galaxy has open, well-defined arms and a small core region. A galaxy with poorly defined arms is sometimes referred to as a flocculent spiral galaxy; in contrast to the grand design spiral galaxy that has prominent and well-defined spiral arms. The speed in which a galaxy rotates is thought to correlate with the flatness of the disc as some spiral galaxies have thick bulges, while others are thin and dense.|$|E

40|$|We present first {{results from}} an {{on-going}} {{survey of the}} stellar populations of the <b>bulges</b> and inner disks of spirals at various points along the Hubble sequence. In particular, we are investigating the hypotheses that <b>bulges</b> of early-type spirals are akin to (and may in fact originally have been) intermediate-luminosity ellipticals while <b>bulges</b> of late-type spirals are formed from dynamical instabilities in their disks. Absorption-line spectroscopy of the central regions of Sa [...] Sd spirals is combined with stellar population models to determine integrated mean ages and metallicities. These ages and metallicities are used to investigate stellar population differences both between the <b>bulges</b> and inner disks of these spirals and between <b>bulges</b> and ellipticals {{in an attempt to}} place observational constraints on the formation mechanisms of spiral <b>bulges.</b> Comment: 4 pages, 2 figures; STScI mini-workshop "When and How do <b>Bulges</b> Form and Evolve?", September 1998, ed.

The fact that <b>bulges</b> lie so close to the FP of ellipticals and S 0 s implies that their formation epoch must have been similar, at most about 2. 5 Gyr earlier, than cluster Es and S 0 s, and and that the surrounding disk does not significantly affect their structure.
