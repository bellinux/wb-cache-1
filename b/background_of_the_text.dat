Since uniform areas are easy to find in natural images, and since text backgrounds define areas which contain "holes" (where the text is written) we thus look for uniform areas containing "holes" and label them as text backgrounds candidates. Each candidate area is then further tested for the presence of text within its convex hull. We tested our method on a database of 65 images including English and Urdu text.

40|$|In this Master's thesis, I {{attempt to}} capture the {{disparate}} semiosis of two musical genres - a traditional opera, Rusalka, which has a unique position in Czech national music, and a musical of the same name. On the basis of theoretical findings from semiotics as a science, from the approaches of F. de Saussure, C. S. Peirce and R. Barthes, and by means of semiotic analysis, the thesis unravels semantic elements that are specific for theatrical art. Attention is directed at the symbol as a major tool for semiosis and the classification of symbols {{on the basis of}} Peirce's three ontological categories. The analysis focuses on decoding the semiotic systems used in the two genres (the libretto, the music, the characters, the story, and the technical and symbolic means that are employed).

The article states that in the fiction by Nicolai Gogol a graduated sequence of various states and degrees of madness is fully represented in “The Collected Petersburg Tales”. Here, this paradigm {{is considered to be}} the principle of graduation in all levels of manner as a key suggestive genre construct of “Dead Souls”. The mental isomorphism of the paradigm meaning content, associated with the peculiarities of the religious, as well as the verbal, consciousness is emphasized in the article. The author stresses that the anthropological vector of Gogol's attention is directed towards the ordinary “despicable and stupid in the life”. The ironic example of the discursive metaphor of a pendulum of history (the philosophical <b>background</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>text)</b> is the slip-in parable of Kif Mokievich and his son Mokii Kifovich. Both characters are at opposite sides of the proper. The world of human relations in “Dead Souls” is reflected in the most straightforward analogies with constant teeming world of different microscopic creatures. To give prominence to the human image Gogol refers to the colourful ontological metaphor, ultimately identifying and equating the person with ordinary fly, which in this text is a significant element of the whole hyper-realistic person-sphere.

40|$|This study {{provides}} the first complete translation into a Western language of a fairly unknown but yet important Chinese work, titled the Zhong tianzhu shewei guo qiyuan si tujing (Illustrated Scripture of Jetavana Monastery in the Sravasti Kingdom in Central India), which describes Jetavana Monastery through textual and diagrammatic representations. To understand better the <b>background</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>text,</b> I first discussed {{the life and}} times of its author Daoxuan (596 - 667 C. E.), an important figure in the history of Chinese Buddhism particularly in relation to the formation of Chinese Buddhist monasticism. I also explored the scriptural and historical records which might have served as sources for Daoxuan's own portrayal for the history and myth of the Jetavana Monastery. Finally, I offered a synoptic analysis of the text itself. The significance of Daoxuan's representation of Jetavana lies precisely in its function as a blueprint of a utopian Buddhist monastery for the early Tang Buddhists rather than as a faithful reconstruction of the historical site in India. The spatial complex and architectural design of the monastery visibly appropriates the symmetrical structure of the Chang'an City. The monastic compound is spatially organized into specialized cloisters and halls for the Buddha, the various ranks of Buddhist saints, the immortals and heavenly beings, the different commoners and laity who are visiting or living in the monastery. The text interfuses fact and fantasy, historical reality and religious vision; its description of extraordinary artifacts, divine creatures, and plants certainly mirror the Buddhist paradisal representations in texts and art. It is equally important to realize that such imagery is also derived in part from the exotic products, cultural curiosities, fantastical creatures imported from foreign lands that pervaded the markets of the cosmopolitan Chang'an in the Tang. Further investigation in my study of Daoxuan's portrayal of Jetavana suggests that the influence of this text is not only found in the Chinese monastic setting and Dunhuang cave art in the later periods, but its impact is also visible in Japanese Buddhism...|$|E
40|$|The {{question}} of the Fourth Gospel 2 ̆ 7 s origins has occasioned a very large amount of scholarship over the last century, ranging from the arguments of Rudolph Bultmann for a proto-Gnostic <b>background</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>text</b> to those of Raymond E. Brown and J. Louis Martyn for a strongly Jewish one. While both approaches have advanced {{our understanding of the}} Johannine milieu, neither accounts adequately for the Gospel 2 ̆ 7 s preoccupation with the concepts of power, kingship, and divinity [...] all of which were closely interrelated in the Augustan Ideology. Moreover, after expulsion from the synagogue and loss of Jewish religious privileges, Johannine Christians would unavoidably have come into conflict with the Roman authorities charged with defending both the political interests and the divine image of the emperor. The evangelist could not have ignored the grave practical and theological dangers this situation posed for his community. I argue that, in matters both of grand design and of minor detail, and on both a structural and a lexical level, the final redactor(s) of the Fourth Gospel made a conscious effort to address issues raised for his community by the religio-ideological and socio-legal claims of the Augustan Ideology. I begin by reconstructing a history of the Johannine community based on the writings of Brown and Martyn, before carefully examining the function of the Augustan Ideology in first-century Roman society, particularly but not exclusively as mediated through the Imperial Cult in the provinces of Asia Minor. I next apply these researches to several key christological terms and titles in the Gospel, {{as well as to the}} Prologue and parts of the Passion Narrative. In all these we can find substantive parallels and allusions which would have clearly connoted the person of the emperor to John 2 ̆ 7 s audience. These parallels and allusions, in turn, are pervasive and systematic enough to suggest the existence of a polemic governing the final redaction of John and directed at least in part against the Augustan Ideology. In short, the final redactor(s) of the Gospel wanted to distinguish clearly the nature of Christ 2 ̆ 7 s divinity and power from the religious and political authority of the Emperor...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{represents a}} watershed in an extended artistic career and, for that reason, the early chapters trace a detailed pathway through {{a diversity of}} artistic influences. Apart from exploring the impact of significant others, additional influences include Museum and Gallery collections, Library collections, and a multiplicity of literary interests which encompass {{the development of an}} early predisposition for exploring the potential of a synthesis between the spiritual and material. The thesis documents and analyses previous practice as well as the effect of a dramatic move in geographic location. This overview is provided as a backdrop to the current research. However the primary focus of the research derives from the possibilities inherent in a literary work and its potential for generating the conceptual underpinning and compositional framework of a visual work. Significant factors in this regard are the identification of ideas allied to various aspects of temporality and their relationship and translation from literary sources to their development and realization as visual interpretations. Outcomes of the research include exhibitions of artwork in Brisbane and Townsville, the realization of two Public Artworks, and the fabrication of an Artist’s Book. Issues relating to the translation of work designed for exhibition in a gallery situation and the translation of selected pieces into Public Artworks are explored. In treating the evolution of an Artist’s Book, the origins and conceptual <b>background</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>text</b> are scrutinized in concert with the eisegetical approach adopted in terms of its visual interpretation and structural development. Although the commercial publication of the book represents a post examination outcome, the research cites earlier ideas for its replication and editioning up to that point.

40|$|This thesis aims {{to address}} two {{principal}} questions: What is <b>the</b> relative chronology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Johannine literature? And, {{how does this}} affect our understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Johannine community and <b>the</b> origins <b>of</b> Christianity? [...] It is argued herein that <b>the</b> Epistles <b>of</b> John were written before <b>the</b> final form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gospel <b>of</b> John. Evidence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> communal <b>background</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>texts</b> is examined {{in an effort to}} glean some knowledge of those who stand behind these documents.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 95 - 97) Set in 1919 {{during the}} Great Migration, William Attaway???s 1941 Proletarian novel, Blood on the Forge, a text too often overlooked {{by the mainstream}} of literary studies, follows the three Moss brothers from their experience tenant farming in the agrarian South to steel working in the newly industrialized North. Seemingly anticipating Louis Althusser???s highly influential work, ???Ideology and the Ideological State Apparatuses,??? Blood on the Forge portrays indissoluble cultural, ideological, and material conditions. The cumulative spectrum of the novel???s portrayal links the Mosses??? immediate struggles to a broader system of exploitation. Attaway???s depiction of the South foregrounds dialectical relationships between black folk culture and the white aristocracy, while undercurrents in the text emphasize ideological underpinnings that work to maintain dominance in these dialectical relationships. An overwhelming presence of violence pervades {{all aspects of the}} Mosses??? lives. Work life, family life, social engagement, and thus conscious and subconscious ideologies are shaped by repression consisting of physical and mental violence. While Attaway portrays racism and repression dominating the South, and although the dialectics of race discrimination persist in the North, the role of ideological and repressive state apparatuses become more qualitatively distinctive as separately functioning institutions, and ideological state apparatuses are the dominant means of manipulation in the class warfare waged against the Mosses and the working community in the industrial setting. The issues of racism that were overt and foregrounded in the Southern setting slip into the <b>background</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>text</b> and operate more covertly as part of the substructure of the Northern mill town culture. The novel depicts racism persisting in Northern culture; however, it is clearly different from the racism of the South, and it reveals fluidity in the conceptualization of race, of which variations depend on the exploitative relationships in the local culture. As the Mosses come from a violently racist culture, their individual ideologies reflect such violence and racism, as well as resistance to it. In the North, however, the Mosses are swept away by the currents of social recreations that are ritualized in a manner comparable to those described in Althusser???s theoretical system. All the while, racist ideology continues to factor into policymaking in the North, {{as it is in the}} South, dictated by demands for labor. Although Attaway portrays a tenuous hold on authority by both repressive and ideological state apparatuses in contrast to Althusser???s model, by showing the continuity from South to North of exploitative relationships that produce the Mosses??? material conditions interconnected to institutionalized manners of thinking and corporal enforcement within Southern and Northern cultures, Blood on the Forge reaffirms as well as informs Althusser???s theory through representations of the powerful yet tenuous influence of the state apparatuses, the dialectical clash of humanistic freewill, ideological determinism, and the deterministic effect of brute force in relation to institutionalized racism and labor exploitation of early 20 th century America...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Memorial University of Newfoundland, 1997. Religious StudiesBibliography: leaves 146 - 150. This thesis aims {{to address}} two {{principal}} questions: What is <b>the</b> relative chronology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Johannine literature? And, {{how does this}} affect our understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Johannine community and <b>the</b> origins <b>of</b> Christianity? [...] It is argued herein that <b>the</b> Epistles <b>of</b> John were written before <b>the</b> final form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gospel <b>of</b> John. Evidence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> communal <b>background</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>texts</b> is examined {{in an effort to}} glean some knowledge of those who stand behind these documents. Arguments in favour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> priority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Epistles are presented, arguments which cumulatively accentuate the more natural progression <b>of</b> placing <b>the</b> epistolary writings first. [...] The assertion that the Epistles hold chronological priority over the Gospel leads us to a different reconstruction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Johannine community from that given in conventional scholarly circles, one which sees <b>the</b> origins <b>of</b> <b>the</b> written Gospel as outside the accepted Christian tradition. In reconstructing the Johannine community's history through an examination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> writings <b>of</b> John, this thesis places the community within the wider historical and sociological context <b>of</b> <b>the</b> origins <b>of</b> Christianity, and concludes that <b>the</b> sources <b>of</b> <b>the</b> modern Christian faith — as played out in <b>the</b> microcosm <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Johannine fellowship — are indeed diverse...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn our papers we {{estimated}} to student's {{perception of a}} literary translation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>text</b> in historical and cultural context. <b>The</b> best translation <b>of</b> any text from one language to another is not simple translation of some words and sentences. There are necessary an adaptation and interpretation. And also means difference between languages and cultures with these languages are connected. In our opinion it is given an important place in this process to translator, who goes {{through a number of}} perception phases, from acquiring outline <b>background</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original <b>text,</b> to <b>the</b> high level, when this perception becomes systematic. The thoughts put forward in the theses are specified on the Russian poetry...|$|R
40|$|Faithfulness is <b>the</b> {{fundamental}} standard <b>of</b> translation. People have different opinions on faithfulness. This study, taking <b>the</b> translation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chinese classic A Dream of Red Mansions as an example, investigates <b>the</b> translation <b>of</b> cultural information and proposes that cultural faithfulness {{is of great}} importance for cultural communication in literary translation. The translator should use appropriate strategies and methods to convert the cultural information in <b>the</b> target <b>text.</b> To be faithful to the source culture, the translator should {{be familiar with the}} political, historical and cultural <b>background</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original <b>text</b> to avoid over-domestication, over-foreignization, zero translation and mistranslation and use zero compensation, compensation in the version, compensation by annotations and compensation by transformation to compensate for the cultural default in specific translations...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{will discuss}} both the artistic {{processes}} {{as well as}} the background and the related theoretical premises of a collaborative art undertaking that emerged as an evolving combination of creative output which was displayed in Second Life® Fall 2013, and Spring 2014. Despite the idiosyncratic, highly individualized nature <b>of</b> its components, <b>the</b> project nevertheless achieved a remarkable state of cohesion. What may have contributed to this visual unity will be the subject under investigation at <b>the</b> core <b>of</b> this <b>text.</b> Since these constitute <b>the</b> <b>background</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> project, <b>the</b> <b>text</b> will commence with a survey <b>of</b> <b>the</b> creative mechanisms and strategies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> metaverse, also bringing in Axel Bruns's term 'produsage' and Brian Eno's notion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 'unfinished artifact' as strongly related terms; after which a description <b>of</b> <b>the</b> project, its curatorial premises, including <b>the</b> usage <b>of</b> metaverse geography and climate as an agent of visual harmony will also be delivered. The chapter will then conclude with an examination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> collective art process within <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 'unfinished artifact' and John Dewey's deliberations on <b>the</b> experiential nature <b>of</b> artwork/art process as a potential framework for metaverse artistic collaborations...|$|R
