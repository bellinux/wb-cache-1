Therefore, it is of great importance there are treatments available which are low in costs and high in efficacy. In view of the resistance to antibiotics and any residues in milk or meat, non-antibiotic treatment is preferred. In this article a clinical trial is described {{with the aim of}} testing non-antibiotic spray to cure bovine digital dermatitis lesions. The trial is preformed at seven Dutch dairy farms between October and December 2013. Repiderma-spray® (Copper, zinc, aloe vera, alcohol, IntraCare <b>BV,</b> <b>Netherlands)</b> was used as non-antibiotic spray and chlortetracycline-spray, CTC® (chlorinetetracyclinehydrochloride®, Eurovet Animal Health <b>BV,</b> <b>Netherlands),</b> which is officially registered, as positive control. Claws were alternately treated with Repiderma® or CTC® following the manufacturer’s protocol and photographed and scored at day 0 and day 10. If there was no longer an M 2 lesion at day 10, the claw was defined cured. The average cure rate of claws treated with Repiderma®-spray at day 10 was 89. 15...|$|R
