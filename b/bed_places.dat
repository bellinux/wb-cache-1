On the fifth day it {{was found to be}} totally deserted, and Major Russell moved the headquarters of his regiment down into it. The white officers were much surprised with the structure of the huts of this place, which was exactly similar to that of those of Coomassie, with their red clay, their alcoved <b>bed</b> <b>places,</b> and their little courts one behind the other. Major Russell established himself in the chief's palace, which was exactly like the other houses except that the alcoves were very lofty, and their roofs supported by pillars. These, with their red paint, their arabesque adornments, and their quaint character, gave the courtyard the precise appearance of an Egyptian temple.|$|E

These cabins were very resplendent with gilding and carving, and were adorned with curtains and mirrors on every side. They presented to Mr. George, as he walked through them, a very imposing spectacle. Along the sides of them were a great many little bed rooms, called state rooms. These state rooms were all very beautifully finished, and were furnished with every convenience which passengers could require. Mr. George selected two of these state rooms. They were two that were adjoining to each other, and they were connected by a door. There were two beds, or rather <b>bed</b> <b>places,</b> in each state room, one above the other. Mr. George chose the lower berth in one state room for Rollo, and the lower one in the next state room for Jane. When he had chosen the berths in this manner, he wrote the name of each of the children on a card, and then pinned the cards up upon the curtains of the respective berths.|$|E

Montgomerie reported on 16 November 1840 that there were 22 insane patients and he expected that the yearly average of seventeen patients would increase with growth of the settlement. In the report, he also suggested the Lunatic Asylum be built for 24 patients and should any more room be needed, buildings would be added on. In addition, floors [...] "should be laid with bricks on edge, embedded in good mortar so as to admit of being washed, and prevent the patients lifting the floors, which constructed with tiles as in the Jail, they have been enabled to do so;" [...] and [...] "wood for the walls and <b>bed</b> <b>places</b> in consequence of very bad effects having arisen from patients in the Jail having destroyed the <b>bed</b> <b>places</b> and by squatting on the floor and leaning against cold walls, have in several instances cramped their limbs and stiffened their joints so as to cause lameness".

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} the tourist developments {{that have taken}} the Mediterranean basin in recent years. This paper studies the internal differences, the intervention {{of political and social}} factors and key trends. Maintenance of tourism is checked despite the stagnation in tourist arrivals. The Mediterranean basin is the main tourist area of the world, despite strong competition from other tourist areas. The distribution of this tourism is very unbalanced, with most concentrated in the north shore, and especially in the western side (75. 4 % tourists and 78. 9 % <b>bed</b> <b>places,</b> 2012). The southern and eastern Mediterranean shore has been affected by conflict which has caused a loss of tourist flows.

We first explored tourism in NUT 2 regions in the EU with a spatial data analyses and then we applied spatial econometric analyses on tourism where we {{take into account the}} RDP spending on the measures that encourage tourism. For the spatial regression analyses, we use the indicators of the CMEF framework. The data were collected from Eurostat. The spending on the RDP measure 313 encouragement of tourism is not uniformly distributed over the NUTS 2 regions in the EU. The spatial analyses of tourism measured by the number of nights spent by non-residents showed the presence of spatial dependencies in tourism. Based on the spatial dependency tests of the classical regression model, a spatial error model is estimated. The number of <b>bed</b> <b>places</b> positively affected the total number of night spent by non-residents. RDP spending on encouraging tourism did not {{have a significant impact on}} tourism.

Results: Between 2002 and 2006 the number of conventional psychiatric inpatient beds tended to fall and changes in involuntary admissions were inconsistent. The number of forensic <b>beds,</b> <b>places</b> in supervised and supported housing, and the prison population increased in most, but not all, of the countries studied. Conclusions: The findings suggest an ongoing although not consistent trend toward increasing provision of institutionalized mental health care across Europe...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is {{identification}} {{of the relationship between}} the amount of expenditure for tourism born by mountain communes (gminas) in Poland and intensity of tourist traffic in their areas. The analysis of tourist traffic in mountain communes in Poland in the first place allowed to establish that an average intensity of tourist traffic is greater than generally in Poland. The observation does not refer to the whole of the analyzed area, since tourist traffic reveals a very high concentration, reaching extreme cases in the communes where not a single tourist used bed-places. Registered increase in tourist traffic intensity did not apply to the whole area of mountain communes in Poland. Mountain communes only to some extent get involved in realization of expenditure on tourism – less than half of communes participated in them in 2009 and only few communes spent considerable amounts of money. Average expen-diture from commune budgets on tourism, both total and per one tourist using <b>bed</b> <b>places</b> in mountain communes, were higher than the average for all communes in Poland. None of the applied methods of identification of correlative dependence allowed to establish its occurrence on a significant level, therefore the number of tourists in mountain communes in Poland does not directly depend on the amount of expenditure on tourism realized by these communes.

40|$|The {{destination}} {{image is}} multidimensional {{in nature and}} the knowledge the individuals have of the destination and also their personal traits and opinions {{play an important role}} in it. Therefore, it is a complex construction in which the different information sources are decisive. Thus, the destination image plays a key role in both marketing and tourism location. The city of Malaga, located in Southern Spain, lies on the Costa del Sol (Coast of the Sun), a tourist area largely identified with seaside tourism. In recent years Malaga city has been trying to distance itself from the “sun and sand” tourism segment and it has chosen to position itself as a cultural destination (Diario Sur, 2014; The New York Times, 2015). In this regard, the effectiveness of the image of Malaga differentiated from a seaside destination image is analysed in the present study. The main objective of this research is to perform an analysis of the current image of the city and of the target one. A detailed study of the obtained results will enable us to take a close look at the tourists’ attitudes towards Malaga city and it will provide us with information to improve or design new differentiation strategies. This is the first academic study on Malaga’s destination image. Malaga is a Spanish municipality in Andalusia and it is located, as already mentioned, in the Costa del Sol, beside the Mediterranean Sea. The city had 566, 913 inhabitants (2014) and an accommodation supply of 9, 598 <b>bed</b> <b>places</b> and nearly one million of tourists (2013).

60|$|His {{first step}} was to cut a stout stick, and he then {{proceeded}} to the other cell, which was partially blocked up with stone from the fallen roof. It took him two hours to carry this stuff out, and he killed no less than nine snakes that he disturbed in his work. The prospect of sleeping in a place so frequented was not a pleasant one, especially as the cell had no door to it; and he resolved at once to erect some sort of <b>bed</b> <b>place,</b> where he might be beyond their reach. For this purpose he cut two poles, each three or four inches longer than the cell. One end of each he sharpened, and drove in between the interstices of the stone, at a distance of some two feet and a half apart and four feet from the ground. The other ends he hammered with a heavy stone against the opposite wall, until they would go down no farther. Then he split up some more wood and lashed strips, almost touching each other, underneath the two poles, by the aid of some strong creepers. Then he filled up the <b>bed</b> <b>place,</b> between the poles, with dry leaves.|$|R
