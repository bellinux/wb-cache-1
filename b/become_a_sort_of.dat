5|$|Toriyama was {{commissioned}} {{to illustrate the}} characters and monsters for the first Dragon Quest video game (1986) in order to separate it from other role-playing games of the time. He has since worked on every title in the series. For each game Yuji Horii first sends rough sketches of the characters with their background information to Toriyama, who then re-draws them. Lastly, Horii approves the finished work. Toriyama explained in 1995 that for video games, because the sprites are so small, {{as long as they}} have a distinguishing feature so people can tell which character it is, he can make complex designs without concern of having to reproduce it like he usually would in manga. Besides the character and monster designs, Toriyama also does the games' packaging art and, for , the boats and ships. The series' Slime character, which has <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> mascot for the franchise, is considered to be one of the most recognizable figures in gaming.|$|E

500|$|In a {{retrospective}} review, Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic called The Holy Bible [...] "Richey James' last will and testament", concluding: [...] "Every song has a passage frightening in its imagery. Although the music itself isn't as scarily intense, its tight, terse hard rock and glam hooks accentuate the paranoia behind the songs, making the lyrics cut deeper." [...] Upon its re-release ten years later, Dan Martin of NME described The Holy Bible as [...] "a work of genuine genius". Joe Tangari of Pitchfork wrote: [...] "In a way, {{the story of}} Edwards' spiral into some unknown oblivion {{is tied to the}} experience of The Holy Bible, which in retrospect has <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> horror-show eulogy for a man who couldn't live with the world around him." [...] David Fricke of Rolling Stone wrote that [...] "even the pall of [...] absence can't cancel out the life-affirming force that hits you with the very first song".|$|E
500|$|Rabites, {{known as}} [...] in the Japanese {{versions}} of the games, are cute, fictional, rabbit-like creatures appearing as a common enemy in the series since its beginning. The Rabite has <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> mascot for the Mana series, {{much the same way}} as the Chocobo represents Final Fantasy, and is one of its most recognizable icons. The Rabite resembles a bodiless, one-toothed rabbit with large ears that curve upward and form a point at the tip, and a round, puffy pink tail that moves by hopping along the ground. It is most commonly yellow colored, but also pink, lilac, black, and white, and are variously minor enemies, [...] "superboss" [...] characters and even friendly units and pets. Rabites are also mentioned in Final Fantasy X-2 with an accessory comically named [...] "Rabite's Foot", which increases a character's luck statistic; as well as Final Fantasy Tactics Advance, where they appear in the description of one of the game's optional missions as an endangered species due to being poached for good luck charms. Rabites have appeared prevalently in several pieces of Mana merchandise, including plush dolls, cushions, lighters, mousepads, straps, telephone cards, and T-shirts.|$|E
500|$|The first {{mentions}} of Palsgraf in law reviews were case notes {{written by}} law students, appearing {{over the course}} of the year following the decision by the Court of Appeals. Professor Robert L. Goodhart, in the Yale Law Journal in 1930, was at the front of an avalanche of commentary to such an extent that by 1938, Louisiana State University professor Thomas A. Cowan deemed Palsgraf [...] "a legal institution". The case entered the standard legal casebooks, from which law students learn, in the early 1930s, usually to illustrate the necessary connection between defendant's misconduct and plaintiff's injury in negligence cases. According to Posner, writing in 1990, [...] "Palsgraf is now the subject of a large scholarly literature, and is, I believe, the only case reprinted in all American casebooks on tort law." [...] Manz wrote, [...] "everyone who has sat in an American law school torts class can recall the basic facts—the crowded railroad platform, the running men, the dropped package, the explosion, and the falling scale. Palsgraf has <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> legal 'urban legend'—an allegedly true, but improbable, tale told and retold to each new class of law students." [...] Professor W. Jonathan Cardi noted, [...] "in law school classrooms, 'Palsgraf Day' is often celebrated with food and drink, dramatic reenactments, interpretive poems, and even mock duels between Judges Cardozo and Andrews".|$|E

500|$|Working with Ashfield, Pick's {{impact on}} London's {{transport}} system was considerable. Transport historian Christian Wolmar considers it [...] "almost impossible {{to exaggerate the}} high regard in which [...] was held during its all too brief heyday, attracting official visitors {{from around the world}} eager to learn the lessons of its success and apply them in their own countries" [...] and that [...] "it represented the apogee of a type of confident public administration... with a reputation that any state organisation today would envy... only made possible by the brilliance of its two famous leaders, Ashfield and Pick." [...] In his obituary of Pick, Charles Holden described him as [...] "the Maecenas of our time." [...] Writing in 1968, Nikolaus Pevsner described Pick as [...] "the greatest patron of the arts whom this century has so far produced in England, and indeed the ideal patron of our age." [...] Considering Pick's public statements on art and life, art historian Kenneth Clark suggested that [...] "in a different age he might have <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> Thomas Aquinas". Historian Michael Saler compared Pick's influence on London Transport to that of Lord Reith on the BBC's development during the same inter-war period. Urban planner Sir Peter Hall suggested that Pick [...] "had as much influence on London's development in the twentieth century as Haussmann had on that of Paris in the nineteenth", and historian Anthony Sutcliffe compared him to Robert Moses, the city planner responsible for many urban infrastructure projects in New York.|$|E

2500|$|From the 1920s to his {{retirement}} in the 1980s, many students utilized Griffin's [...] "Hip Pocket Fund," [...] an unofficial loan slush fund financed by area businessmen.

2500|$|Various {{concepts}} within modern Islamism can {{be attributed}} to Ibn Taymiyyah. His influence is noted by Yahya Michot who says Ibn Taymiyyah [...] "has thus <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> forefather of al-Qaeda." [...] One reason for this was his categorising the world into distinct territories: the domain of Islam (dar al-Islam), where the rule is of Islam and sharia law is enforced; the domain of unbelief (dar-al-kufr) ruled by unbelievers; and the domain of war (dar al-harb) which is territory under the rule of unbelievers who are involved in an active or potential conflict with the domain of Islam. (Ibn Taymiyyah included a fourth. When the Mongols, whom he considered unbelievers, took control of the city of Mardin the population included many Muslims. Believing Mardin was neither the domain of Islam, as Islam was not legally applied with an armed forces consisting of Muslims, nor the domain of war because the inhabitants were Muslim, Ibn Taymiyyah created a new [...] "composite" [...] category, known as dar al-`ahd.) ...|$|E
2500|$|In stark contrast, in the United States, {{the car was}} {{frequently}} subjected to ridicule and mockery {{and it has a}} universally negative rating. Car Talk has rated it the [...] "worst car of the century", and many car magazines and TV shows rate it as the worst car of the 1980s and also the worst car to be ever made {{in the history of the}} automotive industry. Despite the very low price setting in the US (with Yugo being the cheapest new car ever sold in the US when adjusted for inflation), it was ridiculed for the overall ugly design, poor quality, and large number of technical issues. Many American Yugos had faulty designs that were stressed in owners' manuals to be regularly serviced, but this caused even more ridicule due to owners overlooking these issues. [...] The car has <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> a symbol for a lemon car. The car was also featured in many TV shows and films, satirizing the car's poor design (the most famous example being a rusty, beige-colored Yugo GV featured in Die Hard with a Vengeance).|$|E
2500|$|Three months later, in January 1878, Reading was {{the site}} of the first {{national}} convention of the Knights of Labor, which grew into one of the important U.S. labor organizations of the nineteenth century. As with many early labor organizations, its membership rolls and meetings were secret, to help avoid infiltration and blacklisting. The Knights creed and organization crossed occupational lines, attempting to <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> [...] "union of unions." [...] As such, {{after the collapse of the}} WBA/M&LBA, miners in the anthracite region formed locals of the Knights of Labor. In one incident, when Coal & Iron Co. workers struck for back pay, Gowen once again raised the issue of terrorism. [...] Seeking to avert the spread of the strike, he sent an open letter to the Miner's Journal newspaper in Pottsville exposing the names of the officers and membership of the Knights assemblies. [...] He also implied that there was a [...] "gang" [...] within the union, similar to the Mollies, whose task was to sabotage coal company property. The Knights fought back by challenging the Schuylkill County authorities to arrest the alleged terrorists, but as Gowen's charges were unsubstantiated, the matter went no further.|$|E
