60|$|On {{the first}} landing {{she met him}} coming <b>back</b> <b>bearing</b> the {{astronomer}} in his arms. He stopped and let loose the practised scalpel of his tongue, not loudly. Gradually Mrs. Parker crumpled as a stiff garment that slips down from a nail. Ever afterward there remained crumples in her mind and body. Sometimes her curious roomers would ask her what the doctor said to her.|$|E
5000|$|The number {{immediately}} following the [...] "ZR" [...] indicates the mill [...] "section" [...] size comprising {{a combination of the}} <b>backing</b> <b>bearings,</b> the work rolls, and so on. For example, a ZR 23 has <b>backing</b> <b>bearings</b> with a diameter of 8.858 inches (225 mm) and work rolls with a diameter of 1.578 inches (40 mm). A ZR 32, on the other hand, has <b>backing</b> <b>bearings</b> of 1.875 inches (48mm) in diameter and work rolls of 0.250 inches (6.5mm) in diameter. The significance of the difference is that a ZR 23 can roll ferrous and nonferrous materials down to a minimum gauge of 0.002 inches (50 microns), while a ZR 32 can roll ultra-thin nonferrous foil down to 0.0001 inches (2.5 microns), which is 20 times thinner! ...|$|R

50|$|The {{reverse of}} the {{intersection}} technique is appropriately termed resection. Resection simply reverses the intersection process by using crossed <b>back</b> <b>bearings,</b> where the navigator's position is the unknown. Two or more bearings to mapped, known points are taken; their resultant lines of position drawn from those points {{to where they}} intersect will reveal the navigator's location.|$|R
60|$|She {{was just}} trying to impress upon her mind that Amoy was two hundred and eighty miles from Hong Kong, when Fun came scuffling <b>back,</b> <b>bearing</b> what she thought was a small sword, till he unfurled an immense fan, and {{presented}} it with a string of Chinese compliments, the meaning of which would have amused her even more than the sound, if she could have understood it.|$|E
6000|$|After {{a time he}} came <b>back,</b> <b>bearing</b> {{with him}} a great brown loaf of bread, and a fair, round cheese, and a {{goatskin}} full of stout March beer, slung over his shoulders. Then Will Scarlet took his sword and divided the loaf and the cheese into four fair portions, and each man helped himself. Then Robin Hood took a deep pull at the beer. [...] "Aha!" [...] said he, drawing in his breath, [...] "never have I tasted sweeter drink than this." ...|$|E
60|$|Now I saw the abbess enter {{that passage}} whence the victim had been led. Presently she came <b>back</b> <b>bearing</b> {{a cup of}} water in her hand and with it a loaf of bread, and I knew by her mien that my draught was in the water. But of what befell {{afterwards}} I cannot say certainly, for I prayed the Dominican to open the door by which we had entered the vault, and passing through it I stood dazed with horror at some distance. A while went by, I do not know how long, till at length I saw the abbess standing before me, a lantern in her hand, and she was sobbing bitterly.|$|E
6000|$|As {{we walked}} <b>back,</b> I <b>bearing</b> the candlesticks, she the sword--a strange burthen for that woman--she had another thought. [...] "Should we tell Henry?" [...] she asked.|$|R

60|$|Now {{every living}} being whom {{they could find}} was slain, and the Romans drew <b>back,</b> <b>bearing</b> their spoil with them. But the {{remainder}} of the Jews, to the number of some thousands, escaped by the bridges, which they broke down behind them, across the valley into the Upper City, whence that piercing, sobbing wail echoed without cease. Miriam watched till she could bear the sight no longer. The glare blinded her, the heat of the incandescent furnace shrivelled her up, her white dress scorched and turned brown. She crouched behind the shelter of her pinnacle gasping for breath. She prayed that she might die, and could not. Now she remembered the drink that remained in the leathern bottle, and swallowed it to the last drop. Then she crouched down again against the pillar, and lying thus her senses left her.|$|E

5000|$|Viking Age stylized silver amulets {{depicting}} {{women with}} long gowns, their hair pulled <b>back,</b> sometimes <b>bearing</b> drinking horns, {{have been discovered}} throughout Scandinavia. These figures are commonly considered to represent valkyries or dísir. According to Mindy MacLeod and Bernard Mees, the amulets appear in Viking Age graves, and were presumably placed there because [...] "they were thought to have protective powers".|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This {{study was}} focused on the {{theoretical}} modeling and numerical simulation about the unbalanced response for coupled double-rotor spindle system of high speed grinder. Based on the rotor dynamics, a theoretical model was established using the transfer matrix method. The moment balance equations, and the transition matrix, the state vector, field matrix of coupled double-rotor spindle system of high speed grinder were analyzed and calculated. The numerical results showed that the amplitude of unbalance response increased by the same multiple as that of the amount of unbalance at different locations and at different speeds. Furthermore, the position most sensitive to the unbalance was the front end of rotor 2, followed by the middle and back end of rotor 2. Rotor 2 was especially sensitive to unbalance. Moreover, the vibration amplitudes of the front end, front and <b>back</b> <b>bearings</b> of rotor 1 increased in response to unbalanced increase of rotate speed. The vibration amplitude abruptly increased at 17500 r/min corresponding to first-order critical speed...|$|R

She was a little afraid of him, {{out there in the}} animal grossness of the <b>back.</b> His <b>bearing</b> also changed, as he smelt the familiar, indefinable odour that pervaded his wife's surroundings, a delicate, refined scent, very faintly spicy. Perhaps it came from the pot-pourri bowls.|$|R

50|$|Local {{attraction}} {{at a place}} can {{be detected}} by observing bearings from {{both ends of the}} line in the area. If fore bearing and <b>back</b> <b>bearing</b> of a line differ exactly by 180°, there is no local attraction at either station. But if this difference is not equal to 180°, then local attraction exists there either at one or both ends of the line.|$|E

5000|$|Thesan was {{depicted}} on several Etruscan mirror <b>backs,</b> <b>bearing</b> a great pair of wings {{on her back}} like many other Etruscan goddesses, especially appropriate to a sky-goddess. One meaning of Her name is simply “Dawn”, and related words are thesi, meaning “illumination”, and thesviti, “clear or famous”. The other meaning of her name connects her {{with the ability to}} see the future, for thesan also means [...] "divination", as seen in the related Etruscan word thesanthei, “divining”, “illuminating”, or “brilliant”. This relates to Her function as a dawn goddess [...] - [...] since divination throws light on the dark future and enables one to see what may happen, like the dawn, which illuminates what was previously dark. She was called by some as a childbirth goddess, as she was present {{at the beginning of the}} day, which finds its parallel in the beginning of a new baby’s life. Similar to the Roman goddess Lucina, goddess of Light and Childbirth, who brought the infant into the light of day.|$|R

When the group came <b>back</b> <b>bearing</b> Atys's body, Adrastus held his hands out to King Croesus in supplication - he begged that he himself be ritually slaughtered over the prince's body, saying that he could no longer go on living with the blood-guilt of yet another person on his hands. Croesus refused him this, saying this was vengeance from the gods, not Adrastus's personal fault; nevertheless, Adrastus took his own life.|$|E

5000|$|By circa 686, Zufar's {{participation}} in the Qaysi-Yamani conflict in the Syrian Desert was highly restricted by persistent campaigns against his safe haven at al-Qarqisiyah by the Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik (r. 685-705); Zufar was replaced in this regard by Umayr ibn al-Hubab of the Banu Sulaym. Umayr's Sulaymi tribesmen began encroaching on the lands of the Banu Taghlib along the northern Khabur Valley, prompting the Banu Taghlib to request Zufar intervene and force the Banu Sulaym {{to withdraw from the}} area. Not wanting to push the neutral and Christian Banu Taghlib into joining the Umayyad-Yamani cause, Zufar attempted but failed to calm the situation. Umayr opened hostilities against the Banu Taghlib in a number of punishing raids in Upper Mesopotamia, and dragged Zufar into assisting him in some of these clashes. Umayr was killed by the Banu Taghlib in 689, obliging Zufar to avenge his death. To that end, Zufar attacked a Taghlibi camp at the northern Tigris River town of Kuhail and executed two hundred Taghlibi captives taken in that raid. Referencing this event, the poet Jarir taunted his Taghlibi rival al-Akhtal, stating: The warriors of Qays bore down on you with steeds Ungroomed and grim-faced, <b>backs</b> <b>bearing</b> heroes You kept thinking everything after them Was steeds and men charging over and over Zufar Abu al-Hudhayl, their chieftain, annihilated youmen Then captured your women and plundered your herds.
