25|$|White {{and yellow}} {{dextrins}} from starch roasted {{with little or}} no acid are called <b>British</b> <b>gum.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{printing}} thickeners used {{depend on}} the printing technique, the fabric and the particular dyestuff [...] Typical thickening agents are starch derivatives, flour, gum arabic, guar gum derivatives, tamarind, sodium alginate, sodium polyacrylate, gum Senegal and gum tragacanth, <b>British</b> <b>gum</b> or dextrine and albumen.|$|E
50|$|<b>British</b> <b>gum</b> or dextrin is {{prepared}} by heating starch. It varies considerably in composition, sometimes being only slightly roasted and consequently only partly converted into dextrine, {{and at other}} times being highly torrefied, and almost completely soluble in cold water and very dark in colour. Its thickening power decreases and its gummy nature increases as the temperature at which it is roasted is raised. It is useful for strongly acid colours, and with the exception of gum Senegal, it is the best choice for strongly alkaline colours and discharges. Like the natural gums, it does not penetrate as well into the fibre of the cloth pr as deeply as pure starch or flour and is unsuitable for very dark, strong colours.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} work {{is aimed at}} producing dextrins from cassava starch and also to investigate the effects of acid concentration, roasting temperature and time on dextrin produced using 8 run screen experimental design before the preparation of adhesive. It was shown in the result that the best of white dextrin, yellow dextrin and <b>British</b> <b>gum</b> were obtained at concentrations of acid of 0. 3 M, 0. 3 M, and 0. 23 M and at roasting time of 30, 180 and 180 minutes and at roasting temperature of 60 oC, 90 oC and 120 oC respectively. The best of white dextrin which had the highest solubility of 36. 1 per cent was used to formulate the adhesive...|$|E
