40|$|ABSTRACT: Conventionally, {{because it}} is {{difficult}} to control a ship in shallow water and because attempting to do so creates unwanted environmental effects, maneuvering ships in the harbor area for berthing is usually done with the assistance of tugboats. In this paper, we propose a new method for berthing ships automatically by using <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> <b>stern</b> <b>thrusters.</b> Specifically, a steering motion model of a ship is considered, and parameters in the equation are evaluated by the system identification technique. An optimal controller based on observations was designed from the linearization of the non-linear ship motion in the horizontal plane. It is used to reduce the uncertainty about the ship’s dynamics and reduce measurement requirements. The performance of the controller was also analyzed for its robustness relative to avoiding disturbing the environment due to winds, currents, and wave-drift forces. Experiments were conducted to estimate the potential for identifying result and the design of the controller. Specifically, in this paper, the system modeling and tracking control approach are discussed based on a two-degree-of-freedom (2 DOF) servo-system design...|$|R

50|$|Two <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> two <b>stern</b> <b>thrusters</b> provide port manoeuvrability, and {{two pairs}} of {{stabilizer}} fins reduce rolling. A special silicone-based paint, instead of biocides used by much of the industry, keeps barnacles off of the hull. This increases her efficiency by reducing drag while also protecting the ocean from biocides that may leak. The paint is credited with lowering the water drag enough to save 1,200 tonnes of fuel per year. The ship has a bulbous bow, a standard feature for cargo ships.|$|R
50|$|Manoeuvring {{thruster}} (bow <b>thruster</b> or <b>stern</b> <b>thruster)</b> is {{a transversal}} propulsion device built into, or mounted to, either the bow or stern, {{of a ship}} or boat, {{to make it more}} maneuverable. Bow thrusters make docking easier, since they allow the captain to turn the vessel to port or starboard side, without using the main propulsion mechanism which requires some forward motion for turning; indeed, the effectiveness of a thruster is curtailed by any forward motion due to the Coandă effect. A <b>stern</b> <b>thruster</b> is of the same principle, fitted at the stern. Large ships might have multiple <b>bow</b> <b>thrusters</b> <b>and</b> <b>stern</b> <b>thrusters.</b>|$|R

In the accommodation space at underway, the highest noise level was measured 62. 4 dB in the cadet’s room on the tank top floor, the 2 nd highest noise level was 59. 4 dB in the crew’s room on the 2 nd deck floor and 54. 1 dB on the boat deck floor. The noise level decreases on the upper floor.
