5|$|After the Second Punic War, {{there was}} a great {{increase}} in income inequality. While the middle class was drafted to serve in increasingly long campaigns, their farms and homesteads fell into <b>bankruptcy.</b> <b>And</b> with Rome's great military victories, vast numbers of slaves were imported into Italy. In the middle of the second century BC, the tribunate of Tiberius Gracchus led to a breakup of the long-standing norms of the republican constitution. Graccus' legislation effectively established a parallel administration challenging the socio-political power of the old aristocracy and establishing a precedent that the popular assemblies could vote themselves whatever they wanted. His younger brother, Gaius Gracchus, further challenged the Senate's political preeminence, by threatening it with new judicial procedures. The Senate's violent reaction against both the Gracchi, which led to their deaths, also served to legitimise the use of violence for political ends.|$|E

40|$|Forthcoming in Economica We {{study the}} impact of {{macroeconomic}} instability on business exit {{in a world where}} acquisition <b>and</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> are co-determined.

We find that macroeconomic instability has opposite effects on <b>bankruptcy</b> hazard <b>and</b> acquisition hazard, raising the former and lowering the latter. While {{it is not surprising that}} bankruptcy hazard is counter-cyclical and acquisition hazard pro-cyclical, it is noteworthy that the US business cycle is a better predictor of UK acquisitions <b>and</b> <b>bankruptcies</b> than the UK cycle itself...|$|R

The system, primarily intended to track aircraft, was called Radio Determination Satellite Service (RDSS). In April 1983 Geostar applied to the FCC for a license to broadcast from three satellites, which would cover the entire United States. Geostar launched GSTAR-2 into geosynchronous orbit in 1986. Its transmitter package permanently failed two months later, so Geostar began tests of RDSS by transmitting from other satellites. With his health failing, O'Neill became less involved with the company {{at the same time it}} started to run into trouble. In February 1991 Geostar filed for <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>and</b> its licenses were sold to Motorola for the Iridium satellite constellation project.
