50|$|In 2004 Drill Doctor {{sold its}} one-millionth unit and Darex was {{named one of}} Oregon's top 50 places {{to work for the}} third year in a row. In 2013, and 2014 Darex was again named as one of Oregon's top workplace. In 2006 Darex secured a {{contract}} from the US Army for a drill <b>bit</b> <b>sharpener</b> that would be included in tool kits to support soldier’s safety. Darex developed the V390 drill <b>bit</b> <b>sharpener</b> that was used in Iraq by soldiers to repair the armor plating on Humvees and install antennas for GPS units.|$|E
5000|$|In 1973 Darex {{was founded}} by Richard Bernard in Beecher, Illinois. David, Arthur and Richard Bernard founded the company and their {{initials}} make up the first three letters of “Darex”. While at Bernard Welding Equipment Co., Arthur and Richard saw {{how difficult it was}} to sharpen drill bits. Richard brought his father, Arthur, into the business to help develop a drill sharpener. At a 1976 Cleveland regional trade show, Darex released their first drill <b>bit</b> <b>sharpener,</b> the M-1. In 1978 Darex moved to Ashland, Oregon.|$|E

5000|$|Darex L.L.C. is an American {{manufacturer}} of industrial <b>bit</b> <b>sharpeners,</b> and are currently based in Ashland, Oregon. Darex L.L.C. owns two other brands, Work Sharp Tools which creates knife and tool sharpeners and Drill Doctor which creates hobbyist drill <b>bit</b> <b>sharpeners.</b> Darex is a fourth generation family owned company {{that began in}} 1973 in Beecher, Illinois until 1979 when it relocated to Ashland.|$|R
5000|$|After {{several years}} of {{manufacturing}} drill <b>bit</b> <b>sharpeners</b> for industrial customers, Darex created a line of endmill sharpeners. In 1988 Darex released the E80, E85, and E90. With the success of industrial sharpeners, Darex decided {{to create a new}} consumer brand, Drill Doctor, which debuted in 1996 at the International Hardware Show in Chicago, Illinois. Both the DD500 and DD750 were launched.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} design and {{development}} of the drill bit sharpening jigs for bench grinder. The objective of this thesis is to design the drill <b>bit</b> <b>sharpener</b> jig that enhance the better outcome rather than manual sharpening operation. The thesis follows with the development of the drill bit sharpening jig that can be attached to the bench grinder. The structural three-dimensional solid modeling of drill bit sharpening jig was developed using the computer-aided drawing software which is CATIA V 5 R 21. The strategy of validation of the model design was developed. The generative part structural analysis was then performed using simulation in CATIA V 5 R 21 to detect the Von Mises distribution. The design and suitable material will be validated. The fabrication of the jig may undergoes in various machining process such as milling, turning, electrical discharge wirecut and grinding. The assembled part shall be tested on the bench grinder. Besides, several dull drill bits will be sharpen using the jig. These assessment results are significant to improve the component design at the early developing stage. Further analysis will be conducted by testing the drilling process on the workpiece. The resharpen drill bits and the new drill bits will results on the difference surface roughness. Thus, the surface roughness analysis is performed to distinguish hole surface roughness outcomes for both drill bits. The results shows the difference of surface roughness between both hole surface is small and insignificant. Thus, it means that the outcomes is relatively same. The jig can also significantly reduce the cost and time to market, and improve product reliability and customer confidence...|$|E
