50|$|Baking blind (sometimes called pre-baking) is {{the process}} of baking a pie crust or other pastry without the filling. Blind baking a pie crust is {{necessary}} when it will be filled with an unbaked filling (such as with pudding or cream pies), in which case the crust must be fully baked. It is also called for if the filling has a shorter bake time than the crust, in which case the crust is partly <b>baked.</b> <b>Blind</b> baking is also used to keep pie crust from becoming soggy due to a wet filling.|$|R

We interviewed six site creators {{to understand the}} motivations they felt and the challenges they encountered. We found that these challenges ultimately resulted {{from a lack of}} information visibility, particularly concerning work in progress. Less technically skilled interviewees coped with these challenges by collaborating with other people, but they were less positive about their respective site’s success compared to interviewees whose skills enabled them to work alone. We conclude by outlining opportunities for research aimed at helping people more rapidly and effectively collaborate on future web-centric projects...|$|R
