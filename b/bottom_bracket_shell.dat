25|$|On some gearbox bicycles, the <b>bottom</b> <b>bracket</b> <b>shell</b> may be {{replaced}} by an integrated gearbox or a mounting location for a detachable gearbox.|$|E
25|$|The chain stays run {{parallel}} to the chain, connecting the <b>bottom</b> <b>bracket</b> <b>shell</b> to the rear fork ends or dropouts. When the rear derailleur cable is routed partially along the down tube, it is also routed along the chain stay. Occasionally (principally on frames made since the late 1990s) mountings for disc brakes will {{be attached to the}} chain stays. There may be a small brace that connects the chain stays in front of the rear wheel and behind the <b>bottom</b> <b>bracket</b> <b>shell.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>bottom</b> <b>bracket</b> <b>shell</b> is a {{short and}} large {{diameter}} tube, relative to the other tubes in the frame, that runs side to side and holds the bottom bracket. It is usually threaded, often left-hand threaded on the right (drive) side of the bike to prevent loosening by fretting induced precession, and right-hand threaded on the left (non-drive) side. There are many variations, such as an eccentric bottom bracket, which allows for adjustment in tension of the bicycle's chain. It is typically larger, unthreaded, and sometimes split. The chain stays, seat tube, and down tube all typically connect to the <b>bottom</b> <b>bracket</b> <b>shell.</b>|$|E

50|$|Wittson Cycles is a Northern European {{handmade}} bicycle manufacturer {{located in}} Klaipeda, Lithuania. Wittson works exclusively with titanium and sources the European Grade 9 tubes from Baltic neighbor Sweden and the VSMPO Titan Scandinavia corporation, which also supplies aerospace luminaries Boeing and Airbus. Wittson uses 3/2.5 Ti for their frame production, and 6/4 Ti, which has greater tensile strength but {{is much harder}} to weld, for dropouts and <b>bottom</b> <b>bracket</b> <b>shells,</b> along with smaller bits such as brake cable stops.|$|R
50|$|While every large bicycle {{manufacturer}} sponsored or {{participated in}} bicycle racing competition {{of some sort}} {{to keep up with}} the newest trends in technology, Schwinn had restricted its racing activities to events inside the United States, where Schwinn bicycles predominated. As a result, Schwinns became increasingly dated in both styling and technology. By 1957, the Paramount series, once a premier racing bicycle, had atrophied from a lack of attention and modernization. Aside from some new frame lug designs, the designs, methods and tooling were the same as had been used in the 1930s. After a crash-course in new frame-building techniques and derailleur technology, Schwinn introduced an updated Paramount with Reynolds 531 double-butted tubing, Nervex lugsets and <b>bottom</b> <b>bracket</b> <b>shells,</b> as well as Campagnolo derailleur dropouts. The Paramount continued as a limited production model, built in small numbers in a small apportioned area of the old Chicago assembly factory. The new frame and component technology incorporated in the Paramount largely failed to reach Schwinn's mass-market bicycle lines. Another change occurred in 1963 following the death of F. W. Schwinn, when grandson Frank Valentine Schwinn took over management of the company.|$|R
25|$|Certain {{companies}} such as Cannondale (BB30 open standard, introduced in 2000) have made their own unique bottom bracket standards requiring changes in the <b>bottom</b> <b>bracket</b> <b>shell</b> of the bicycle frame {{in order to accommodate}} the bottom bracket/crank design. The open BB30 standard is gaining popularity on high end bicycle and component manufacturers (Zipp, Specialized, FSA).|$|E
25|$|The {{down tube}} connects the head tube to the <b>bottom</b> <b>bracket</b> <b>shell.</b> On racing {{bicycles}} and some mountain and hybrid bikes, the derailleur cables {{run along the}} down tube, or inside the down tube. On older racing bicycles, the shift levers were mounted on the down tube. On newer ones, they are mounted with the brake levers on the handlebars.|$|E
25|$|Even newer designs {{have the}} bottom bracket spindle, usually hollow and larger {{diameter}} than {{is possible for}} bottom brackets with bearings held inside the <b>bottom</b> <b>bracket</b> <b>shell</b> of a bike frame, for reduced weight and increased stiffness, permanently attached to the right crank (Shimano and others) or the left crank (Race Face). The left crank slides onto a spline and is tightened {{with one or more}} pinch bolts (Shimano) or is pressed onto a spline by a bolt on the bottom bracket spindle (Race Face).|$|E

50|$|French {{bicycles}} before 1980 {{often used}} French-threaded <b>bottom</b> <b>brackets</b> (now {{difficult to find}} replacement parts for). French <b>bottom</b> <b>brackets,</b> like Italian ones, used right-hand threading on the fixed cups, making them subject to loosening by precession. Motob√©cane broke ranks with most other French manufacturers in the mid-70s, using Swiss-threaded <b>bottom</b> <b>brackets</b> (also difficult to find replacement parts for now). Swiss <b>bottom</b> <b>brackets</b> were identical to French, save that the fixed cups were reverse-threaded (like English ones), making them immune to loosening by precession. For more information, see <b>bottom</b> <b>bracket</b> specifications.|$|R
50|$|The <b>bottom</b> <b>bracket</b> {{height is}} the {{vertical}} {{distance from the}} center of the <b>bottom</b> <b>bracket</b> to the ground, and it expresses clearance of the frame over obstacles. The height of the <b>bottom</b> <b>bracket</b> is of concern when designing the frame. The height of the <b>bottom</b> <b>bracket</b> is the baseline for the rider's height while riding. Combined with the length of the cranks, it determines the bicycle's ground clearance.|$|R

2500|$|The {{head tube}} {{contains}} the headset, the interface with the fork. The top tube connects the head tube {{to the seat}} tube at the top. [...] The top tube may be positioned horizontally (parallel to the ground), or it may slope downwards towards the seat tube for additional stand-over clearance. [...] The down tube connects the head tube to the <b>bottom</b> <b>bracket</b> <b>shell.</b>|$|E
50|$|They may be held {{in place}} by a {{built-in}} wedge, set screws threaded into the <b>bottom</b> <b>bracket</b> <b>shell,</b> or pinch bolts that tighten a split <b>bottom</b> <b>bracket</b> <b>shell.</b> As a standard sized bottom bracket threads into the eccentric, an oversized <b>bottom</b> <b>bracket</b> <b>shell</b> is required to accommodate the eccentric.|$|E

5000|$|The Thompson {{bottom bracket}} uses {{adjustable}} spindle cones and cups {{pressed into the}} <b>bottom</b> <b>bracket</b> <b>shell</b> like the Ashtabula bottom bracket. Unlike the Ashtabula crank, the non-drive side crank is removable, allowing for a smaller <b>bottom</b> <b>bracket</b> <b>shell.</b> Frames with either Italian or English <b>bottom</b> <b>bracket</b> <b>shell</b> diameters (independent of threading) may be fitted with Thompson bottom brackets. [...] Thompson bottom brackets are rare. The design {{is similar to a}} typical hub bearing and theoretically supports the load better, but is hard to seal effectively against dirt and water.|$|E

50|$|Q Factor is a {{function}} of both the <b>bottom</b> <b>bracket</b> width (axle length) and the crank arms. <b>Bottom</b> <b>brackets</b> axles vary in length from 102mm to 127mm. Mountain bike cranks are typically about 20mm wider than road cranks.|$|R
