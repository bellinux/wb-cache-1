40|$|In a {{study in}} which {{patients}} were allocated non-systematically to surgeries <b>booked</b> <b>at</b> 5, 7. 5, and 10 minute intervals 623 consultations were taperecorded. In surgeries <b>booked</b> <b>at</b> longer intervals doctors used the extra {{time to take a}} fuller history from their patients. In surgeries <b>booked</b> <b>at</b> 10 minute intervals doctors spent more time explaining the patient's problem, explaining the proposed management, and in discussing prevention and health education, these increases not being evident in surgeries <b>booked</b> <b>at</b> 7. 5 minute intervals...|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} in which patients who were seeking appointments for a consultation in a general practice in south London attended consulting sessions <b>booked</b> <b>at</b> 5, 7. 5, or 10 minute intervals. The particular session that the patient attended was determined non-systematically. The clinical content of the consultation was recorded on an encounter sheet and on audio-tape. At the end of each consultation patients were invited to complete a questionnaire designed to measure satisfaction with the consultation. The stress engendered in doctors carrying out surgery sessions <b>booked</b> <b>at</b> different intervals of time was also measured. <b>At</b> surgery sessions <b>booked</b> <b>at</b> 5 minute intervals, compared with 7. 5 and 10 minute intervals, the doctors spent less time with the patients and identified fewer problems, and the patients were less satisfied with the consultation. Blood pressure was recorded twice as often in surgery sessions that were <b>booked</b> <b>at</b> 10 minute intervals compared with those <b>booked</b> <b>at</b> 5 minute intervals. There was no evidence that patients who attended sessions <b>booked</b> <b>at</b> shorter intervals received more prescriptions, were investigated or referred more often to hospital specialists, or returned more often for further consultations within four weeks. There was no evidence that the doctors experienced more stress in dealing with consultations that were <b>booked</b> <b>at</b> 5 minute intervals than <b>at</b> consultations <b>booked</b> <b>at</b> 7. 5 and 10 minute intervals, though they complained of shortage of time more often in surgery sessions that were <b>booked</b> <b>at</b> shorter intervals...|$|R

5|$|In Malaysia, {{a similar}} price war caused {{controversy}} regarding {{sales of the}} book. Four of the biggest bookstore chains in Malaysia, MPH Bookstores, Popular Bookstores, Times and Harris, decided to pull Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows off their shelves as a protest against Tesco and Carrefour hypermarkets. The retail price of the book in Malaysia is MYR 109.90, while the hypermarkets Tesco and Carrefour sold the <b>book</b> <b>at</b> MYR 69.90. The move by the bookstores {{was seen as an}} attempt to pressure the distributor Penguin Books to remove the books from the hypermarkets.

5|$|At {{one stop}} on the book tour {{associated}} with the publication and release of the <b>book</b> <b>at</b> the David A. Clarke School of Law of the University of the District of Columbia, Jackson's message was perceived as saying that American history can be studied as an analysis of race, but that economics and the tension between states’ rights and federal rights are the true basis of a domestic history revolving around pursuit of economic development, political power, and personal freedom. He then advanced the theory that these pursuits would most be most readily attained by adopting a set of new constitutional amendments, guaranteeing rights primarily grounded in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which the U.S. has ratified. Each is discussed in a separate chapter: the rights to quality health care, housing, education, a clean environment, fair taxes, full employment, equality for women, {{and the right to}} vote.|$|E
5|$|Blake Harrison {{conceived}} {{of the idea}} that would become Flocabulary while in high school. Inspired by hip hop artists like Outkast and A Tribe Called Quest, Harrison wanted to combine the easy retainability of hip hop lyrics with educational content. Harrison graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a degree in English. He then moved to San Francisco, where he met Alex Rappaport, a music graduate of Tufts University. Harrison shared his idea with Rappaport, and in 2004 the two made a demo recording of two songs with a combined total of 80 SAT words. Within two months Sparknotes made the songs available for free streaming, and soon afterward Harrison and Rappaport set up a Flocabulary website. Cider Mill Press published Flocabulary books and distributed them through Sterling Publishing to sell the <b>book</b> <b>at</b> Barnes & Noble and Borders stores. The Hip Hop Approach to SAT Vocabulary sold 10,000 copies in its first year of publication and was reprinted five times. In 2005, Flocabulary went on a promotional tour of concerts at schools.|$|E
