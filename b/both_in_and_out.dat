5|$|After high school, Mitsuda {{decided to}} leave town and become independent. With {{encouragement}} from his father and sister, he moved to Tokyo and enrolled in the Junior College of Music. Despite the school's low prestige, Mitsuda received solid instruction from his professors, most of them practicing musicians who would take Mitsuda to gigs with them to help carry and set up equipment. At the cost of being used for free physical labor, Mitsuda got a first-hand view of the Japanese music world and valuable training <b>both</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> of the classroom. As part of his college course, he was granted an intern position at the game development studio Wolf Team, studying under composer and musician Motoi Sakuraba, whom Mitsuda would work with together on game projects decades later.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the size effects of monetary unions (MU). Employing a stylized model of international macroeconomics for large countries with imperfect competition and nominal rigidities, the closed-form solutions are derived as {{functions of the}} terms of trade (ToT). We found that, whilst both MU and Home gain from a larger MU, the gain is larger for MU because of the change in ToT by the size effect. We also addressed the effects of changes <b>in</b> productivity <b>and</b> the market power of workers <b>in</b> MU, <b>and</b> found that <b>both</b> <b>ins</b> <b>and</b> <b>outs</b> gain with plausible values of the underlying parameters...|$|R
40|$|If Stage Three of EMU {{starts on}} 1 January 1999, {{transition}} issues remain on two time scales. Until 1 July 2002, national currencies and the euro coexist as legal tender. We argue that intra-EMU currency risk exists in principle during that period, but that no EMU member can be forced out through speculative attacks. Cohabitation of <b>Ins</b> <b>and</b> <b>Outs</b> has an open-ended time scale. We discuss {{the effect of}} EMU on incentives for <b>both</b> <b>Ins</b> <b>and</b> <b>Outs</b> to undertake structural reform and the coordination {{problems associated with the}} distribution of seigniorage revenue and the Stability and Growth Pact.

5|$|In his {{civilian}} life, Harvey pursued {{political interests}} and spent three spells as a Member of Parliament for Maldon and later Essex. During this period {{he was also}} knighted. However, Harvey was not a peaceable man and his life <b>both</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> of the Navy was frequently punctuated by disputes with fellow officers and politicians. One such dispute, {{a consequence of the}} Battle of Basque Roads, eventually cost Harvey his career; a bitter exchange with Lord Gambier forcing Harvey into early retirement in 1809. Although reinstated a year later, Harvey was never again employed in an official capacity and further promotions were only bestowed as a matter of seniority.|$|E
5|$|Under Wilkes' ownership, the Spirit, which {{previously}} had covered mainly sporting events, expanded its coverage to include political matters. When the American Civil War began in 1861, Wilkes covered the battles also. He {{was present at}} the First Battle of Bull Run and wrote an account of it. He continued to serve as a correspondent throughout the war and contracted the kidney disease which he later died from during his war journalism. Wilkes also used literary feuds with other newspapers, <b>both</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> of the sporting press, to help his subscription rates. After the Civil War, Wilkes' Spirit was one of the three leading newspapers in New York City. Two, including the Spirit, of the three were mainly devoted to horse racing– the other being The Turf, Field and Farm by Sanders D. Bruce.|$|E
5|$|An {{endpoint}} of a pipe is addressable with a tuple (device_address, endpoint_number) as {{specified in}} a TOKEN packet that the host sends when {{it wants to}} start a data transfer session. If {{the direction of the}} data transfer is from the host to the endpoint, an OUT packet (a specialization of a TOKEN packet) having the desired device address and endpoint number is sent by the host. If the direction of the data transfer is from the device to the host, the host sends an IN packet instead. If the destination endpoint is a uni-directional endpoint whose manufacturer's designated direction does not match the TOKEN packet (e.g. the manufacturer's designated direction is IN while the TOKEN packet is an OUT packet), the TOKEN packet is ignored. Otherwise, it is accepted and the data transaction can start. A bi-directional endpoint, on the other hand, accepts <b>both</b> <b>IN</b> <b>and</b> <b>OUT</b> packets.|$|E

40|$|Coaching Islamic {{dress is}} one of the tasks that must be {{implemented}} by Islamic education knowledge (Pendidikan Agama Islam/PAI) teachers, <b>both</b> <b>in</b> school <b>and</b> <b>out</b> of school. Contribution PAI teachers are expected to have relevance to the role of educators in Islam, so that the teacher's role in fostering ethical PAI Islamic dress can give a good change to students. This research was conducted at SMAN Sabang, which is considered representative for the study, because students and teachers are very homogeneous, tribes, nations and religions. This research is a qualitative research with method of collecting data through interviews, observation and document study. The researcher found that 1) Ethics dress that is set the school has met the criteria of Islamic dress code; but students’ practicing islamic dress <b>both</b> <b>in</b> school <b>and</b> <b>out</b> of school is less than perfect. 2) the contribution of PAI teachers in coaching dress code is good. 3) In coaching, PAI teachers have enabling and inhibiting factors, so that there are students who still dress out of school environment do not meet the criteria of Islamic dress...|$|R
5|$|Athletes have {{historically}} been willing to take legal and health risks to improve their performance, with some even stating their willingness to risk their lives, as exemplified by research by Mirkin, Goldman and Connor in researching attitudes to the so-called Goldman dilemma. To prevent use of performance-enhancing substances, athletes must submit to drug tests that are conducted <b>both</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> of competition by anti-doping officials or accredited medical staff. Penalized athletes are susceptible to higher testing upon return to competition. Athletes found to have taken substances on the World Anti-Doping Agency's banned list receive sanctions and may be banned from competition {{for a period of}} time that corresponds to the seriousness of the infraction. However, the use of substances not on the prohibited list may also result in sanctions if the substance is deemed similar to a banned substance in either composition or effect. Athletes may also be sanctioned for missing tests, seeking to avoid testing or tampering with results, refusing to submit to testing, through circumstantial evidence, or confession of use.|$|E
