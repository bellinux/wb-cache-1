25|$|In 1977, Bush announces he {{will run}} for Congress to {{represent}} Texas' 19th district. At a barbecue, Bush meets his future wife, Laura Lane Welch. During a debate, Bush is criticized by his Democratic opponent, Kent Hance, who says that <b>Bush</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a real Texan and has spent campaign contributions to throw an alcohol-fueled party for underage Texas Tech University students. Bush does poorly in the debate and loses the election, but with {{the highest number of}} votes for a Republican candidate in the state's history.|$|E

5000|$|The SEC's {{exhaustive}} investigation examined {{thousands of}} pages of documents. Additionally, and in an unusual move, Bush waived client-attorney privileges so the attorneys could be questioned, in order to leave no remaining doubts on the subject. Regarding whether Bush knew in advance about the losses, the SEC investigators found: [...] "The evidence establishes that George W. <b>Bush</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> aware {{of the majority of the}} items that comprised the loss Harken announced on August 20." [...] The SEC investigators concluded that the loss resulted from write-downs and expenses that occurred after he sold his stock. Basically an outsider, Bush did not usually receive the Executive Committee's Weekly Flash Reports on the company's financial condition. In short, concluded an SEC investigative memo, George W. <b>Bush</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> particularly informed about the company's finances.|$|R

[...] "Saddam was executed for killing 148 people, Iraqi Shi'a Muslims, while Bush {{is responsible for the}} killing of about 600,000 Iraqis since the March 2003 invasion." ...|$|E
5000|$|In English common law, for example, forest {{laws and}} game laws have {{specified}} which animals are res nullius {{and when they}} become someone's property. Wild animals are regarded as res nullius, and as not being the subject of private property until reduced into possession by being killed or captured (see, e.g. Pierson v. Post). A bird in the hand is owned; a bird in the <b>bush</b> <b>is</b> <b>not.</b> Even bees do not become property until hived.|$|E

5000|$|Carlson {{has stated}} that former U.S. {{president}} George W. <b>Bush</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a true conservative. In an August 27, 2004, Washington Post interview, Carlson expressed his [...] "displeasure with Bush". Carlson asked: [...] "Why do so many antiwar liberals give John Kerry a pass when he adopts the Bush view on Iraq, as he has? The amount of team-playing on the left depresses me." [...] Carlson did not vote in the 2004 election, citing his disgust with the Iraq War and his disillusionment with the once small-government Republican Party. He {{would go on to}} say: ...|$|E
5000|$|Despite lampooning him on stage, Bush {{described}} Tony Blair as [...] "a {{decent man}} who made some bad decisions", and stated that she had [...] "come to ridicule beautiful Blair not vilify him". Some have argued that <b>Bush</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> critical enough of New Labour. Writing in The Daily Telegraph, Dominic Cavendish claimed that [...] "the country is angrier than The Blair Musical allows". Contrarily, Paul Lowman of The Press (York) has praised Bush's even-handedness, stating that her greatest strength is her ability to [...] "camouflage complex issues in a vastly entertaining, glossy, media friendly package." ...|$|E
5000|$|A Reuters {{reporter}} {{based in}} Afghanistan cited a top Taliban commander saying {{the death of}} Saddam Hussein [...] "will boost the morale of Muslims.

5000|$|In March 2006 Republican Colorado State Representative Jim Welker {{was criticized}} for {{forwarding}} a WorldNetDaily article by Jesse Lee Peterson. http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=46440 Congressmen criticized Welker for uncritically sending {{a copy of the}} article by email, which included the statements [...] "President <b>Bush</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> to blame for the rampant immorality of blacks" [...] and accused [...] "welfare-pampered blacks" [...] of waiting {{for the federal government to}} save them from Hurricane Katrina. Welker stated that he did not agree with everything in the article. He said that the reason he sent it was because of its message [...] "about society victimizing people by making them dependent on government programs." ...|$|E
5000|$|Linguist Mark Liberman of Language Log has {{suggested}} that <b>Bush</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> unusually error-prone in his speech, saying: [...] "You can make any public figure sound like a boob, if you record everything he says and set hundreds of hostile observers to combing the transcripts for disfluencies, malapropisms, word formation errors and examples of non-standard pronunciation or usage... Which of us could stand up to a similar level of linguistic scrutiny?" [...] Nearly a decade after George W. Bush said [...] "misunderestimated" [...] in a speech, Philip Hensher called the term one of his [...] "most memorable additions to the language, and an incidentally expressive one: {{it may be that}} we rather needed a word for 'to underestimate by mistake'." ...|$|E
5000|$|Large scale land-clearing for crops, grazing {{and urban}} {{development}} has reduced native vegetation cover including the warrior bush and led to landscape salinisation, increased sediment, nutrient and salt loads in rivers and streams, loss of habitat {{and a decline in}} biodiversity. As a general note, we see introduced and invasive plant and animal species into any ecosystem is a major threat to floral biodiversity; 20 introduced species have been declared Weeds of National Significance (many of which are located within the semi-arid vegetation zones of the warrior bush) and since European settlement of Australia, 61 plant species are known to have become extinct; a further 1,239 species are presently considered threatened. Fortunately, the warrior <b>bush</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> classified as a threatened flora species and its conservation status classifies as [...] "LC" [...] - least concern.|$|E

40|$|Investigation {{showed that}} the damages seen on the <b>bush</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> caused by wear. It appears most {{probable}} that the bush got damaged during assembly, {{which resulted in the}} formation of thin ridges and loosely adhered material. These were retained in the assembly and thereby liberated loose material time to time during service leading to repeated chip warnings...|$|R
60|$|Toby's story, when at last, hot and tired, {{he reached}} the alder <b>bushes,</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> nearly so {{exciting}} as his partners anticipated. He had clung to the pony until they entered the woods, where he was brushed off by {{the branches of the}} trees as easily {{as if he had been}} a fly, and with as little damage.|$|R
50|$|The warrior <b>bush</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> {{usually more}} than a small bush, however it {{sometimes}} develops into a small tree like the specimen, the largest recorded being still only approximately 4 metres high. The young branches and berries are browsed by stock and frequently grazed on by wild goats. When it is flowering during November and December, the warrior bush attracts clouds {{of black and white}} migratory caper white butterflies, and their larvae frequently cause much damage. The sight of these butterflies encompassing this harsh shrub is an unusual image for a species which in a sense has no foliage to speak of. The timber of the warrior bush is surprisingly dense and close grained with a very fine medullary ray making this species highly drought resistant. It has also been noted that macropods such as kangaroos and wallabies are commonly associated with the habitat of the warrior bush.|$|E
50|$|Economic growth, though positive, has {{not been}} {{sufficient}} to generate jobs and prevent unemployment from rising. In fact,there {{are now more than}} two million fewer private sector jobs than {{at the start of the}} current recession. Overcapacity,corporate scandals, and uncertainty have and will continue to weigh down the economy.The tax cut plan proposed by President <b>Bush</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> the answer to these problems. Regardless of how one views the specificsof the Bush plan, there is wide agreement that its purpose is a permanent change in the tax structure and not the creationof jobs and growth in the near-term. The permanent dividend tax cut, in particular, is not credible as a short-term stimulus.As tax reform, the dividend tax cut is misdirected in that it targets individuals rather than corporations, is overlycomplex, and could be, but is not, part of a revenue-neutral tax reform effort.Passing these tax cuts will worsen the long-term budget outlook, adding to the nation’s projected chronic deficits. Thisfiscal deterioration will reduce the capacity of the government to finance Social Security and Medicare benefits as well asinvestments in schools, health, infrastructure, and basic research. Moreover, the proposed tax cuts will generate furtherinequalities in after-tax income.To be effective, a stimulus plan should rely on immediate but temporary spending and tax measures to expand demand,and it should also rely on immediate but temporary incentives for investment. Such a stimulus plan would spur growthand jobs in the short term without exacerbating the long-term budget outlook.|$|E
5000|$|In the USA {{reaction}} to the record was mixed. Awarding the record the title of [...] "platter du jour" [...] (i.e. album of the month), Spin observed that [...] "with traces of classical, operatic, tribal and twisted pop styles, Kate creates music that observes no boundaries of musical structure or inner expression". The review noted [...] "while her eclecticism is welcomed and rewarded in her homeland her genius is still ignored here - {{a situation that is}} truly a shame for an artist so adventurous and naturally theatrical", and hoped that [...] "this album might gain her some well-deserved recognition from the American mainstream". However, Rolling Stone, in their first ever review of a Kate Bush record, was unimpressed: [...] "The Mistress of Mysticism has woven another album that both dazzles and bores. Like the Beatles on their later albums, <b>Bush</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> concerned about having to perform the music live, and her orchestrations swell to the limits of technology. But unlike the Beatles, Bush often overdecorates her songs with exotica ... There's no arguing that Bush is extraordinarily talented, but as with Jonathan Richman, rock's other eternal kid, her vision will seem silly to those who believe children should be seen and not heard." [...] The New York Times characterized the album's music as [...] "slightly precious, calculated female art rock" [...] and called Bush [...] "a real master of instrumental textures," [...] while The Independent called Hounds [...] "a prog-pop masque of an album." [...] Pitchfork Media gave the album a score of 10/10. Spin called it an [...] "art-pop classic." ...|$|E

50|$|A linear <b>bushing</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> usually {{pressed into}} a housing, but rather secured with a radial feature. Two such {{examples}} include two retaining rings, or a ring that is molded onto the OD of the bushing that matches with a groove in the housing. This {{is usually a}} more durable way to retain the bushing, because the forces acting on the bushing could press it out.|$|R
