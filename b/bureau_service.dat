50|$|Picquart {{was then}} {{appointed}} to the General Staff in Paris. As a staff officer he acted as reporter of the debates in the first Dreyfus court martial for the then Minister of War and the Chief of the General Staff. Picquart was subsequently promoted {{to the rank of}} lieutenant-colonel on 6 April 1896. He was appointed chief of the army's intelligence section (Deuxième <b>Bureau,</b> <b>service</b> de renseignement militaire) in 1895. The following year Picquart discovered that the memorandum (bordereau) used to convict Captain Alfred Dreyfus, had actually been the work of Major Ferdinand Walsin Esterhazy. Several high-ranking generals warned Colonel Picquart to conceal his discovery but Picquart persisted and continued his investigation. In this he was hindered and sabotaged by subordinate officers, notably Major Henry. As a consequence Picquart was relieved of duty with the Deuxième Bureau and sent (December 1896) to regimental duty, commanding the 4th Regiment of Tirailleurs (native infantry) in French Tunisia.|$|E

We present a two-phase rating process that allows rating engines generate charge information for dynamically composed services without having to have a priori knowledge of the structure of these services. In the first phase individual services comprising the composed service are rated as if they were executed standalone. In the second phase these interim charges are modified in line with providers' rules regarding whether monetary discounts or penalties should be applied when their services are used with other services. We discuss the ongoing implementation of this process {{in the context of an}} enhanced Rating <b>Bureau</b> <b>Service</b> and its deployment in the "Digital Business Ecosystem" environment...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} innovations to take place in local government in the 1980 s has been the introduction of microcomputers and associated software across a wide spectrum of municipal functions. Use of computers in local government is not a new phenomenon [...] -a decade ago one in five municipalities in Australia owned a computer and a further one in five utilized a computer <b>bureau</b> <b>service</b> (Davis and Walker 1980). At that time, however, computing was a 'central' mainframe-based facility functionally linked to a limited array of financial-administrative activities and accessible to only a small elite within the EDP session. We now have a clear break with this earlier pattern. Microcomputers are being introduced at 'departmental' levels enabling practitioners to use a growing range of analytical packages. Therein lies the raison d'&# 0234;tre of this book. Two principal factors have accounted for the diffusion of this innovation into local government, namely technology push (i. e. the opportunities provided by new technology to solve a range of existing local area problems) and market need (whereby practitioner needs are made known within the marketplace and new technology, either products or processes, are devised in response; Voss 1984) ...|$|E
