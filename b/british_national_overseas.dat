25|$|Due to the {{international}} status of Hong Kong and <b>British</b> <b>National</b> (<b>Overseas),</b> both HKSAR passports and BN(O) passports are ineligible for Visa Waiver Program of the United States, and required to obtain a visa prior to traveling to the United States. However, HKSAR passport holders may travel Guam and Northern Mariana Islands visa-free for 45 days.|$|E
25|$|The Hong Kong Immigration Department {{cites the}} number of {{countries}} and territories offering visa-free access for Hong Kong SAR passport holders as 158 (this figure excludes countries and territories not officially recognised by the People's Republic of China, e.g. Kosovo and Taiwan). The British Consulate-General in Hong Kong states 119 as {{the number of}} countries and territories providing visa-free access to <b>British</b> <b>National</b> (<b>Overseas)</b> passport holders.|$|E
25|$|As Chinese citizens, those {{travelling}} on Hong Kong SAR passports {{are entitled}} to the consular protection offered by the People's Republic of China government while overseas. However, {{it is not uncommon}} for PRC authorities overseas to offer consular assistance to PRC citizens of Hong Kong origin travelling on their <b>British</b> <b>National</b> (<b>Overseas)</b> passports, as their British nationality is not recognised by the Chinese government.

25|$|Although Hong Kong SAR and Macau SAR are {{constituents}} of China, they maintain their own immigration policies, which are vastly {{different from those}} of Mainland China, and individual border controls, which separate the territories from the Mainland. The Chinese government, however, does not consider Chinese nationals with resident status of Hong Kong and Macau travelling to China as international travelers, and hence the SAR passports or <b>British</b> <b>National</b> (<b>Overseas)</b> passports cannot be used when entering or transiting through China, regardless of whether they are arriving from Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan or from overseas.|$|E
25|$|The issuing of Hong Kong SAR {{passports}} {{began on}} 1 July 1997, following {{the transfer of}} sovereignty over Hong Kong from the United Kingdom to the People's Republic of China. PRC citizens who have right of abode in the HKSAR and who hold Hong Kong permanent resident identity cards, {{whether or not they}} are holders of <b>British</b> <b>National</b> (<b>Overseas)</b> passport or Hong Kong Certificate of Identity or other travel documents, are eligible to apply for the Hong Kong SAR passport. Note that acquisition of British citizenship in the British Nationality Selection Scheme itself does not affect the eligibility for a HKSAR passport. Nor does the holding of any foreign passport itself affect the eligibility for a HKSAR passport, provided that one remains a PRC citizen.|$|E

50|$|Prior to the {{enactment}} of European Union directive of 1932/2006, <b>British</b> <b>Nationals</b> (<b>Overseas)</b> {{were not included in}} the Annex II of Council Regulation (EC) No 539/2001, and hence needed a Schengen visa to visit the Schengen Area. Only <b>British</b> <b>Nationals</b> (<b>Overseas)</b> using Hong Kong SAR passports to enter Schengen Area could be exempted from obtaining a visa as HKSAR passport was included in the Annex II.|$|R
500|$|Citizenship matters were {{complicated}} by the fact that British nationality law treated those born in Hong Kong as British subjects (although they did not enjoy full rights and citizenship), while the People's Republic of China (PRC) did not recognise Hong Kong Chinese as such. The main reason for this was that recognising these people as British was seen as a tacit acceptance of a series of historical treaties that the PRC labelled as [...] "unequal", including the ones which ceded Hong Kong Island, the Kowloon Peninsula and the New Territories to Britain. The British government, however, recognising the unique political situation of Hong Kong, granted 3.4 million Hong Kongers a new type of nationality known as <b>British</b> <b>National</b> (<b>Overseas),</b> which is established in accordance with the Hong Kong Act 1985. Among those 3.4 million people, there are many British Nationals (Overseas) who are eligible for full British citizenship. Both British Nationals (Overseas) and British citizens are British nationals and Commonwealth citizens according to the British Nationality Law, which enables them to various rights in the United Kingdom and the European Union.|$|E
