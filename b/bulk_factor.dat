40|$|Abstract: A better {{understanding}} of the mechanical properties of prepreg in the uncured state is required to establish process models for automated layup of thermoset prepregs. Such models would enable control of the <b>bulk</b> <b>factor</b> and defects, such as fibre waviness and voidage, during layup. Pressure application time and temperature during automated layup are typically low while the through-thickness strains can be high due to a reduction of gaps between the plies. A visco-elastic analysis for the through-thickness compression response of a toughened carbon/epoxy prepreg is compared against an elastic–plastic material behaviour with respect to automated layup for three representative temperatures. It is shown that a simple plastic material law with strain hardening can be used to accurately model the material response during automated layup of toughened epoxy prepreg. A finite-element model shows good agreement with experimental results...|$|E

As a consequence a large analysis effort started within the community to characterize the phenomenon {{and at the same}} time a variety of theoretical speculations have been proposed to explain it. In this presentation we discuss part of the results we obtained analyzing a first statistical sample of GRBs observed with Swift.

In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} fully selfconsistent SSC model with {{particle}} acceleration due to shock and stochastic acceleration (Fermi-I and Fermi-II-Processes re-spectively) to model the quiescent spectral energy distribu-tion (SED) observed from PKS 2155. The simultaneous August/September 2008 multiwavelength data of H. E. S. S., Fermi, RXTE/SWIFT and ATOM give new constraints to the high-energy peak in the SED concerning its curvature. We find that, in our model, a monoenergetic injection of electrons at γ 0 = 910 into the model region, which are ac-celerated by Fermi-I- and Fermi-II-processes while suffering synchrotron and inverse Compton losses, finally leads to the observed SED of PKS 2155 - 30. 4 shown in H. E. S. S. and Fermi-LAT collaborations (2009). In contrast to other SSC models our parameters arise from the jet’s microphysics and the spectrum is evolving selfconsistently from diffusion and acceleration.

40|$|A {{reliable}} {{prediction of}} the strata behavior and support capacity of longwall workings {{has always been}} a challenge for mining engineers. It is still difficult to quantitatively predict some important mining parameters, such as support capability and the interval of periodic caving of the major roof under given mining and strata conditions. The reason is that several factors controlling the strata behavior are difficult to determine, such as the <b>bulk</b> <b>factor</b> of the caving zone, strength factor of the major roof and load factor of the overlying rock strata. In this study, the back analysis method is employed to address this problem. This paper illustrates an integrated approach to predict the strata movement behavior and optimum capability of powered roof supports for safe mining. First, this approach uses the empirical method to qualitatively analyze the mining influence zone, then establishes a quantitative prediction model by theoretic analysis method, and solves the optimum values of the factors described in the model with the back analysis method. On the basis of the above research, the support capability and interval of periodic caving of the major roof under similar geological conditions may be calculated by using these suitable values of the factors.

With an initial Lorentz <b>bulk</b> <b>factor</b> in the range Γ_ 0 65 - 220, the X-ray afterglow evolution can be explained by a time-dependent photoionization of the local circumburst medium, within a compact and dense environment.

Compliance is usually not compulsory but rather planning incentives draw the attention of the developers and capitalise on these, therefore revitalising the designated areas. In some situations planning incentives such as building lines, <b>bulk</b> <b>factor</b> and rezoning may lure developers, investors and even encourage property owners to develop structures that are more profitable. For example rezoning a residential area into a mixed zone with offices and flats may be helpful since residential use is a low competitor in terms of returns on the land use. The provision of social services such as water supply, refuse collection and street lighting may appear as trivial issues but these actually contribute immensely in the success of revitalisation plans thus the need to consider this when revitalising the inner city. Thus, inner-city revitalisation may be achieved through the provision of adequate and reliable social services in the inner city. Indicative planning does not really conform to the concept of ecological planning. Ecological planning as discussed earlier on is founded on politics of an area, thus there has to be some directives from high above on the strategies for revitalisation. There has to be some compliance to say the use of solar power by households, in such a way a common goal is sought. Incentives are rather contextual and may fail to spur some interest in some individuals. Therefore, revitalisation plans are framed from citizen needs and what they feel is right for them without need for incentives, which often fail to achieve the required goals.|$|E

Static strength and dynamic strength factors in strength domain were interpreted and the former's value was significantly higher in KC group than in GS group.

40|$|Radio-loud active galactic nuclei {{are among}} the most {{powerful}} objects in the universe. In these objects, most of the emission comes from relativistic jets getting their power from the accretion of matter onto supermassive black holes. However, despite the number of studies, a jet's acceleration to relativistic speeds is still poorly understood. It is widely known that jets contain relativistic particles that emit radiation through several physical processes, one of them being the inverse Compton scattering of photons coming from external sources. In the case of a plasma composed of electrons and positrons continuously heated by the turbulence, inverse Compton scattering can lead to relativistic bulk motions through the Compton rocket effect. We investigate this process and compute the resulting <b>bulk</b> Lorentz <b>factor</b> in the complex photon field of an AGN composed of several external photon sources.

Photons above this range are subject to electron-positron pair production with fireball photons and would be absent from the spectrum escaping the gamma-ray burst.

On the other hand, for sufficiently large fireball <b>bulk</b> Lorentz <b>factors,</b> the fireball is optically thin at all energies.

In such a conic beam, the relativistic ejecta may have a spatial variation in the <b>bulk</b> Lorentz <b>factor</b> and the density distribution of gamma-ray emitting jet material. An apparent luminosity function arises because the axis of the cone is randomly oriented with respect to the observer’s line of sight. The width and the shape of the luminosity function are determined by the ratio of the beam opening angle of the conical jet to the inverse of the <b>bulk</b> Lorentz <b>factor,</b> when the <b>bulk</b> Lorentz <b>factor</b> and the jet material density is uniform on the photon emitting jet surface. We calculate effects of spatial variation of the Lorentz factor and the spatial density fluctuations within the cone on the luminosity function and the statistics of gamma-ray bursts. In particular, we focus on the redshift distribution of the observed gamma-ray bursts. The maximum distance to and the average redshift of the gamma-ray bursts are strongly affected by the beaming-induced luminosity function. The bursts with the angle-dependent Lorentz factor which peaks at the center of the cone have substantially higher average gamma-ray burst redshifts. When both the jet material density and the Lorentz factor are inhomogeneous in the conical beam, the average redshift of the bursts could be 5 times higher than that of the case in which relativistic jet is completely homogeneous and structureless. Even the simplest models for the gamma-ray burst jets and their apparent luminosity distributions have a significant effect on the redshift distribution of the gamma-ray bursts.

40|$|Abstract. Compact radio sources can be {{strongly}} affected by relativistic motion. The relativistic motion {{is characterized by}} 2 quantities: the speed or <b>bulk</b> Lorentz <b>factor</b> of the outflow, and the angle subtended by the outflow direction and the line of sight to the observer. One combination of these yields the Doppler factor of the outflow, and a different combination yields the apparent (sometimes superluminal) speed with which a feature {{moves away from the}} core. Since there are two observed quantities, the Doppler factor and the apparent velocity, the two unknowns, the <b>bulk</b> Lorentz <b>factor</b> and the outflow angle, can be estimated separately. Thus, the <b>bulk</b> Lorentz <b>factor</b> and the outflow angle can be estimated separately for a source that has an estimate of both the Doppler factor and an apparent velocity, assuming that the apparent velocity is due to physical motion rather than a pattern speed. Two key results are presented in this paper. First, equipartition Doppler factors have been estimated for a sample of 105 sources with previously estimated inverse Compton Doppler factors. The different categories of active galactic nuclei (AGN) have different ranges and typical values of the Doppler factor; lobe dominated AGN tend to have low Doppler factors, core-dominated quasars tend to have large Doppler factors, and BL Lacertae objects span the full range of Doppler factors. These results support the “orientation unified model ” for different categories of AGN. The second key result comes from combining equipartition Doppler factors and apparent velocities from superluminal motion studies. There are 43 sources for which apparent speeds and equipartition Doppler factors are available. The <b>bulk</b> Lorentz <b>factor</b> and outflow angle are estimated for each of these 43 sources. Again, typical parameter values for different categories of AGN are quite interesting, and generally agree with expectations based on the orientation unified model. 1...|$|R

It is found that the fractional charge q which appears in the classical shot-noise formula S_I= 2 q is q=e/(2 p+χ) on the conductance plateau at G=ν G_ 0 whereas on the plateau at G=G_ 0 /(p+χ) it is given by q=e/(p+χ). For p= 2 and χ=- 1 an alternative hierarchy constructions is also discussed to explain the suppressed shot-noise experiment at <b>bulk</b> filling <b>factor</b> ν= 2 / 3. Comment: Typos in Eqs.

40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{implications}} of Fermi/LAT observations on several aspects of gamma-ray burst (GRB) physics, including the radiation process, the emission sites, the <b>bulk</b> Lorentz <b>factor,</b> and the pre-shock magnetic field: (1) MeV-range emission favors synchrotron process but the highest energy (> 10 GeV) emission may not be synchrotron origin, more likely inverse Compton origin; (2) GRB should have multi-zone emission region, with MeV emission produced at smaller radii while optical and > 100 MeV emission at larger radii; (3) the <b>bulk</b> Lorentz <b>factor</b> can be a few 100 's, much lower than 10 ^ 3, in multi-zone model; (4) the upstream magnetic field of afterglow shock is strongly amplified {{to be at least}} in mG scale.

40|$|Abstract. GRB 990123 was a long, complex gamma-ray burst {{accompanied}} by an extremely bright optical flash. We present the collective constraints on the <b>bulk</b> Lorentz <b>factor</b> for this burst based on estimates from burst kinematics, synchrotron spectral decay, prompt radio flash observations, and prompt emission pulse width. Combination of these constraints leads to an average <b>bulk</b> Lorentz <b>factor</b> for GRB 990123 of Γ 0 = 1000 ± 100 which implies a baryon loading of M jet = 8 + 17 − 2 × 10 − 8 M⊙. We find these constraints {{to be consistent with}} the speculation that the optical light is emission from the reverse shock component of the external shock. In addition, we find the implied value of M jet to be in accordance with theoretical estimates: the baryonic loading is sufficiently small to allow acceleration of the outflow to Γ> 100...|$|R

40|$|OutÑow {{angles and}} <b>bulk</b> Lorentz <b>factors</b> for 43 sources that have proper motions (compiled by Ver-meulen and Cohen in 1994) are {{computed}} {{on the basis}} of Doppler factors and observed apparent motions in the plane of the sky. These estimates of outÑow angles and <b>bulk</b> Lorentz <b>factors</b> are discussed along with their agreement with orientation uniÐed models of active galactic nuclei. Intrinsic (i. e., rest frame) brightness temperatures computed by using the inverse Compton and equi-partition Doppler factors are discussed along with their relevance to the “ “ inverse Compton catastrophe. ÏÏ Intrinsic luminosity densities and luminosities are presented, and the role of systematic errors is discussed. These studies are carried out using a sample of 100 compact radio sources that was compiled by Ghisellini and coworkers in 1993. Error estimates for previously computed inverse Compton Doppler factors and equipartition Doppler factors are presented for these sources, along with a few updates of these Doppler factor estimates...|$|R

40|$|The polarimetric {{measurement}} on the prompt phase of GRB 100826 A {{shows that the}} polarization angle changes ∼ 90 ^∘ between two adjacent time intervals. We will show that this phenomenon can be naturally interpreted {{in the framework of}} the magnetic-dominated jet (MDJ) model. The MDJ model suggests that the <b>bulk</b> Lorentz <b>factor</b> of the outflow increases as Γ∝ r^ 1 / 3, until reaching a saturated value Γ_ sat. Electrons move in the globally ordered magnetic field advected by the jet from the central engine and produce synchrotron photons. The polarized synchrotron photons travel alone the jet direction and then collide with the cold electrons {{at the front of the}} jet. After the Compton scattering process, these photons escape from the jet and are detected by the observer locating slightly off-axis. If photons are emitted before the <b>bulk</b> Lorentz <b>factor</b> saturates, the change of polarization angle is a natural result of the acceleration of the outflow.
