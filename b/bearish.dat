25|$|<b>Bearish</b> pressure, {{influenced}} by speculation {{but also by}} investor suspicion, continued to affect Société Générale's share price {{through to the end}} of 2011. Over the year, the share lost 57.22 percent of its value, the third-worst CAC 40 performance of 2011 (after Veolia and Peugeot).|$|E
25|$|During {{the summer}} of 2011, the {{financial}} markets, fearing {{the collapse of the}} euro zone associated with the European sovereign debt crisis, were severely shaken. European and French bank shares recorded substantial falls. It was within this context that Britain's Mail on Sunday (Daily Mail) published, on Sunday August 7, an article in which it announced Société Générale's imminent bankruptcy. The newspaper quickly published a retraction and its apologies but, despite that, the rumour gathered pace, notably on social networks, resulting in a spectacular fall in Société Générale's share price and in <b>bearish</b> speculation.|$|E
25|$|Overall, Tehran stock {{exchange}} posted {{the second highest}} gains in global markets in 2011 (TEPIX up 29.6%). Meanwhile, the German's DAX (DAX INDEX) lost 16.5% due and the FTSE 100(UKX INDEX) performed poorly, down 6.7%. Stock markets of emerging economies, like Brazil's Brazil Bovespa Index (IBOV INDEX), shed 18.4%. Equally, MENA stock markets had a poor year in 2011, reflecting both the political turbulence across {{the region and the}} battering suffered by most global markets {{as a result of the}} eurozone crisis and the increasingly <b>bearish</b> outlook for the global economy.|$|E
25|$|The {{trade deficit}} induced Buffett {{to enter the}} foreign {{currency}} market {{for the first time}} in 2002. He substantially reduced his stake in 2005 as changing interest rates increased the costs of holding currency contracts. Buffett remained <b>bearish</b> on the dollar, stating that he was looking to acquire companies with substantial foreign revenues. Buffett emphasized the non-productive aspect of a gold standard for the United States dollar in 1998 at Harvard: It gets dug out of the ground in Africa, or someplace. Then we melt it down, dig another hole, bury it again and pay people to stand around guarding it. It has no utility. Anyone watching from Mars would be scratching their head. In 1977, about stocks, gold, farmland and inflation, he stated:Stocks are probably still the best of all the poor alternatives in an era of inflation – at least they are if you buy in at appropriate prices.|$|E
500|$|The euro fell {{against the}} US dollar {{for the two}} trading days {{preceding}} the vote on speculation that a win for the True Finns would hinder the prospects for the Portuguese bailout. Questions were raised whether {{the fall of the}} US dollar to a one-year low could be stemmed. The questions were partially answered on the last trading day before the election, when the dollar rose on concern for a shake-up for European confidence {{as a result of the}} election which caused <b>bearish</b> traders to cover their open positions. The strong showing by the True Finns and the Social Democrats caused EU leaders to worry that they may not be able to count on Finland's future support for any such bailout measure. Concerns for the euro grew in the run-up to the election and caused worry after the result. Eurozone stock markets were also upset and could be further upset as the bailout talks, expected to be concluded in mid-May, were affected. While there was no expectation that the bailout wound be derailed, [...] "caution" [...] was said to be the [...] "watchword." [...] The London Stock Exchange also considered the result a possible obstruction to the bailout.|$|E
2500|$|Whitney's {{extremely}} <b>bearish</b> view on banks landed her on {{the cover}} of the August 18, 2008, issue of Fortune magazine. Even before the problems that befell Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers in September, she said, [...] "It feels like I'm at the epicenter of the biggest financial crisis in history." [...] That year, Fortune listed her among the [...] "50 Most Powerful Women in Business", The New York Post listed her among the [...] "50 Most Powerful Women in New York City", and a CNBC viewer survey named her as [...] "Power Player of the Year" [...] over Jamie Dimon, Ben Bernanke, and Hank Paulson.|$|E
2500|$|Hugh 'The Polar Bear' Rowland (born 1957): A very rough-around-the-edges, 20-year {{veteran of}} ice-road trucking, based in Kelowna in {{southern}} British Columbia. He is of French descent and {{claims to be}} known by the ice road trucking community as [...] "The Polar Bear", which he says refers to his overbearing, annoying personality, <b>bearish</b> attitude, stamina, and consistently high number of loads delivered per season. Rowland owns four trucks and drives one; the other three are manned by ice road rookies Drew Sherwood, Todd White, and Rowland's associate and year-round employee Rick Yemm. Rowland's trucks all have the emblem R Hoe Service on the doors - the company Rowland owns in Kelowna (actually Winfield, BC).|$|E
6000|$|Isolani (returning). Forgive me too my <b>bearish</b> ways, old father! [...] Lord God! {{how should}} I know, then, {{what a great}} [...] Person I had before me.|$|E
60|$|She {{took him}} in hand in other ways. She would not let him be <b>bearish</b> and laughed at {{him when he was}} out of temper. She made him more urbane.|$|E
60|$|His loving, <b>bearish</b> onslaught and {{his words}} quite silenced Carley. How at {{critical}} moments {{he always said}} the thing that hurt her or inhibited her! She essayed a smile as she drew back from him.|$|E
60|$|Theodora {{was called}} away to assist Mrs. Nesbit up-stairs; and as Violet followed, {{she heard the}} aunt observing that Percival Fotheringham was more <b>bearish</b> than ever; {{and that it was}} {{intolerable}} to see him encouraged in his free-and-easy manner when he had thrown away all his prospects.|$|E
60|$|And the old gentleman {{was less}} <b>bearish</b> than {{she thought he}} would have been. He {{occasionally}} became rusty about shillings and sixpences, and scolded because his niece would have a second fire lighted; but by degrees he forgot even this grievance, and did not make himself more disagreeable or exacting than old age, wealth, and suffering generally are when they come together.|$|E
60|$|But {{the gentle}} gray, {{unprepared}} for the crash of a tree that was being felled {{on the edge of}} Halsell wood, took fright, and caused a worse fright to Rosamond, leading finally to the loss of her baby. Lydgate could not show his anger towards her, but he was rather <b>bearish</b> to the Captain, whose visit naturally soon came to an end.|$|E
60|$|The {{struggle}} {{seemed too}} deadly, too terrible, to last long. The Indian and the outlaw {{were at a}} disadvantage. They could not strike freely. The whirling conflict grew more fearful. During one second the huge, brown, <b>bearish</b> figure of Legget appeared on top; then the dark-bodied, half-naked savage, spotted like a hyena, and finally the lithe, powerful, tiger-shape of the borderman.|$|E
6000|$|... "I see you," [...] {{said the}} Egyptian in a sepulchral voice, and {{speaking}} slowly, [...] "become very frail. Your eyesight has almost gone. You are {{sitting alone in}} a cauld room, cooking your ain dinner ower a feeble fire. The soot is falling down the lum. Your <b>bearish</b> manners towards women have driven the servant lassie frae your house, and your wife beats you." ...|$|E
60|$|Just {{then there}} was a slight rustle behind her. Before she could turn someone seized her in {{powerful}} arms. She was bent backward in a <b>bearish</b> embrace, so that she could neither struggle nor cry out. A dark face loomed over hers--came closer. Swift kisses closed her eyes, burned her cheeks, and ended passionately on her lips. They had some strange power over her. Then she was released.|$|E
6000|$|... "I've been kissed--hugged {{and kissed}} {{by one of}} those shameless cowboys! It was so pitch-dark outside I couldn't see a thing. And so noisy I couldn't hear. But {{somebody}} {{was trying to help}} me off my horse. My foot caught in the stirrup, and away I went--right into somebody's arms. Then he did it, the wretch! He hugged and kissed me in a most awful <b>bearish</b> manner. I couldn't budge a finger. I'm simply boiling with rage!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It was not, however, {{till after}} a good space of time, during which I passed through that <b>bearish</b> age in boys, their early teens, when girls are their especial contempt. I was about seventeen, and was sitting one evening {{over a cup of}} tea in a confectioner's at the very same watering-place, when {{opposite}} me a lady took her seat with a little girl. We looked at each other awhile, the child made advances, till I said: [...] "She's a good little thing." ...|$|E
60|$|Bub {{waved his}} hand in farewell, and his mates {{clustered}} along the rail as they answered with a cheering shout. He found room in the stern-sheets, where he fell to regarding the lieutenant. He didn't look so wild or <b>bearish</b> after all--very much like other men, Bub concluded, and the sailors were {{much the same as}} all other man-of-war's men he had ever known. Nevertheless, as his feet struck the steel deck of the cruiser, {{he felt as if he}} had entered the portals of a prison.|$|E
60|$|For awhile, the {{shifting}} system, together with some modifications in {{the arrangement of}} a black silk scarf, answered my purpose; but, by-and-by, he found out, that whether he came to this side or to that, Miss Fanshawe was still his neighbour. The course of acquaintance between Ginevra and him had never run so smooth that his temper did not undergo a certain crisping process whenever he heard her English accent: nothing in their dispositions fitted; they jarred if they came in contact; he held her empty and affected; she deemed him <b>bearish,</b> meddling, repellent.|$|E
60|$|This was not cheerful to Lady Scatcherd; {{but what}} was the poor woman to do? When she spoke to him on any subject he only snarled at her; and now that the heavy fit was on him, she did not dare even to mention the subject of his drinking. She had never known him so savage in his humour as he was now, so <b>bearish</b> in his habits, so little {{inclined}} to humanity, so determined to rush headlong down, with his head between his legs, into the bottomless abyss.|$|E
6000|$|It {{should be}} so, and yet I have {{sometimes}} thought the tiny hand seemed as a wedge, dividing. It is a <b>bearish</b> task to quarrel with that purest {{of all human}} affections--that perfecting touch to a woman's life--a mother's love. It is a holy love, that we coarser-fibered men can hardly understand, and I would not be deemed to lack reverence for it when I say that surely it need not swallow up all other affection. The baby need not take your whole heart, like the rich man who walled up the desert well. Is there not another thirsty traveler standing by? ...|$|E
60|$|The lost box was {{announced}} {{while we were}} at dinner, and Jane is gone with her faithful Avice to unpack it. Her mother {{would have done it}} and sent her boating with the rest, but submitted as usual when commanded to adhere to the former plan of driving with grandmamma. These Druce children must be excellent, according to their mother, but they are terribly brusque and <b>bearish.</b> They are either seen and not heard, or not seen and heard a great deal too much. Even Jane and Meg, who ought to know better, keep up a perpetual undercurrent of chatter and giggle, whatever is going on, with any one who will share it with them.|$|E
60|$|The {{second week}} was prosperous: the {{treasury}} made progress; and Christabel {{began to feel}} as if her pupils were not beyond her management, as at first she had feared. Collectively they were less uncouth and <b>bearish,</b> not so noisy at their meals, nor so needlessly rude to one another; and the habit of teasing Elizabeth whenever {{there was nothing else to}} do was greatly lessened. Indeed Sam did not plague her himself, nor let his brothers do so, unless she tempted him by some very foolish whine or bit of finery; and in such eases a little friendly merriment is a sound cure, very unlike the hateful fault of tormenting for tormenting's sake.|$|E
60|$|Cocklepickers. They waded {{a little}} way in the water and, stooping, soused their bags and, lifting them again, waded out. The dog yelped running to them, reared up and pawed them, {{dropping}} on all fours, again reared up at them with mute <b>bearish</b> fawning. Unheeded he kept by them as they came towards the drier sand, a rag of wolf's tongue redpanting from his jaws. His speckled body ambled ahead of them and then loped off at a calf's gallop. The carcass lay on his path. He stopped, sniffed, stalked round it, brother, nosing closer, went round it, sniffling rapidly like a dog all over the dead dog's bedraggled fell. Dogskull, dogsniff, eyes on the ground, moves to one great goal. Ah, poor dogsbody! Here lies poor dogsbody's body.|$|E
60|$|What is temper? Its primary meaning, the {{proportion}} and mode in which qualities are mingled, is much neglected in popular speech, yet even here the word often carries {{a reference to}} an habitual state or general tendency of the organism in distinction from what are held to be specific virtues and vices. As people confess to bad memory without expecting to sink in mental reputation, so we hear a man declared to have a bad temper and yet glorified as the possessor of every high quality. When he errs or in any way commits himself, his temper is accused, not his character, and it is understood that but for a brutal <b>bearish</b> mood he is kindness itself. If he kicks small animals, swears violently at a servant who mistakes orders, or is grossly rude to his wife, it is remarked apologetically that these things mean nothing--they are all temper.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, {{that is in}} {{your own}} manner," [...] {{answered}} Dickie; [...] "you think fine speeches will pass muster instead of good-will. However, as to this honest porter, you must know that when we presented ourselves at the gate yonder, his brain was over-burdened with a speech that had been penned for him, and which proved rather an overmatch for his gigantic faculties. Now this same pithy oration had been indited, like sundry others, by my learned magister, Erasmus Holiday, so I had heard it often enough to remember every line. As soon as I heard him blundering and floundering like a fish upon dry land, through the first verse, and perceived him at a stand, I knew where the shoe pinched, and helped him to the next word, when he caught me up in an ecstasy, even as you saw but now. I promised, {{as the price of}} your admission, to hide me under his <b>bearish</b> gaberdine, and prompt him in the hour of need. I have just now been getting some food in the Castle, and am about to return to him." ...|$|E
6000|$|Luckily for Mrs. Carbuncle, Sir Griffin took {{delight in}} the show. He did this after a <b>bearish</b> fashion, putting his finger upon little flaws with an {{intelligence}} for which Mrs. Carbuncle had not hitherto given him credit. As to certain ornaments, he observed that the silver was plated and the gold ormolu. A [...] "rope" [...] of pearls he at once detected as being false,--and after fingering certain lace he turned up his nose and shook his head. Then, on the Sunday, in Albemarle Street, he pointed out to Mrs. Carbuncle sundry articles which {{he had seen in}} the bedroom on the Saturday. [...] "But, my dear Sir Griffin,--that's of course," [...] said Mrs. Carbuncle. [...] "Oh;--that's of course, is it?" [...] said Sir Griffin, turning up his nose again. [...] "Where did that Delph bowl come from?" [...] "It is one of Mortlock's finest Etruscan vases," [...] said Mrs. Carbuncle. [...] "Oh,--I thought that Etruscan vases came from--from somewhere in Greece or Italy," [...] said Sir Griffin. [...] "I declare that you are shocking," [...] said Mrs. Carbuncle, struggling to maintain her good humour.|$|E
60|$|The bears were {{constant}} and dangerous sources of annoyance to the bee-hunter. It was not often that an armed man--and le Bourdon seldom moved without his rifle--has much to apprehend {{from the common}} brown bear of America. Though a formidable-looking animal, especially when full grown, it is seldom bold enough to attack a human being, nothing but hunger, or care for its young, ever inducing it to go so much {{out of the ordinary}} track of its habits. But the love of the bear for honey amounts to a passion. Not only will it devise all sorts of <b>bearish</b> expedients to get at the sweet morsels, but it will scent them from afar. On one occasion, a family of Bruins had looked into a shanty of Ben's, that was not constructed with sufficient care, and consummated their burglary by demolishing the last comb. That disaster almost ruined the adventurer, then quite young in his calling; and ever since its occurrence he had taken the precaution to build such a citadel as should at least set teeth and paws at defiance. To one who had an axe, with access to young pines, this was not a difficult task, as was proved by the present habitation of our hero.|$|E
60|$|Betty and Lydia {{had been}} Alice's maids of honor. This being Betty's first {{experience}} at a frontier wedding, it developed {{that she was}} much in need of Lydia's advice, which she had previously disdained. She had rested secure in her dignity. Poor Betty! The first man to kiss Alice was George Martin, a big, strong fellow, who gathered his brother's bride {{into his arms and}} gave her a <b>bearish</b> hug and a resounding kiss. Releasing her he turned toward Lydia and Betty. Lydia eluded him, but one of his great hands clasped around Betty's wrist. She tried to look haughty, but with everyone laughing, and the young man's face expressive of honest fun and happiness she found it impossible. She stood still and only turned her face a little to one side while George kissed her. The young men now made a rush for her. With blushing cheeks Betty, unable to stand her ground any longer, ran to her brother, the Colonel. He pushed her away with a laugh. She turned to Major McColloch, who held out his arms to her. With an exclamation she wrenched herself free from a young man, who had caught her hand, and flew to the Major. But alas for Betty! The Major was not proof against the temptation and he kissed her himself.|$|E
60|$|In {{the first}} week in January Lord George and Sir Griffin {{returned}} to the castle with the view of travelling up to London with the three ladies. This arrangement was partly thrown over by circumstances, as Sir Griffin was pleased to leave Portray two days before the others and to travel by himself. There was a bitter quarrel between Lucinda and her lover, and it was understood afterwards by Lady Eustace that Sir Griffin had had a few words with Lord George;--but what those few words were, she never quite knew. There was no open rupture between the two gentlemen, but Sir Griffin showed his displeasure to the ladies, who were more likely to bear patiently his ill-humour in the present circumstances than was Lord George. When a man has shown himself to be so far amenable to feminine authority as to have put himself in the way of matrimony, ladies will bear a great deal from him. There was nothing which Mrs. Carbuncle would not endure from Sir Griffin,--just at present; and, on behalf of Mrs. Carbuncle, even Lizzie was long-suffering. It cannot, however, be said that this Petruchio had as yet tamed his own peculiar shrew. Lucinda was as savage as ever, and would snap and snarl, and almost bite. Sir Griffin would snarl too, and say very <b>bearish</b> things. But {{when it came to the}} point of actual quarrelling, he would become sullen, and in his sullenness would yield.|$|E
60|$|By {{the time}} {{care for her}} brother's health had ceased to be Henrietta's grand object, and she was obliged once more to see him depart to pursue his education, a whole circle of pursuits and occupations had sprung up around her, and given her the {{happiness}} of feeling herself both useful and valued. Old Mr. Langford saw in her almost the Mary he had parted with when resumed in early girlhood by Mrs. Vivian; Mrs. Langford had a granddaughter who would either be petted, sent on messages, or be civil to the Careys, as occasion served; Aunt Roger was really grateful to her, as well for the Latin and Greek she bestowed upon Willy and Charlie, as for the braided merino frocks or coats on which Bennet used to exercise her taste when Henrietta's wardrobe failed to afford her sufficient occupation. The boys all liked her, made a friend of her, and demonstrated it in various ways more or less uncouth: her manners gradually acquired the influence over them which Queen Bee had only exerted over Alex and Willy, and when, saving Carey and Dick, they grew less awkward and <b>bearish,</b> without losing their honest downright good humour and good nature, Uncle Geoffrey only did her justice in attributing the change to her unconscious power. Miss Henrietta was also the friend of the poor women, the teacher and guide of the school children, and in their eyes and imagination second to no one but Mr. Franklin. And withal she did not cease to be all that she had ever been to her brother, if not still more. His heart and soul were for her, and scarce a joy and sorrow but was shared between them. She was his home, his everything, and she well fulfilled her mother's parting trust of being his truest friend and best-loved counsellor.|$|E
50|$|If the trader is <b>bearish</b> (expects {{prices to}} fall), {{you use a}} <b>bearish</b> call spread. It's named this way because you're buying and selling a call and taking a <b>bearish</b> position.|$|E
50|$|In options trading, a {{bear spread}} is a <b>bearish,</b> {{vertical}} spread options strategy {{that can be}} used when the options trader is moderately <b>bearish</b> on the underlying security.|$|E
50|$|Next, Cardwell {{noted that}} <b>bearish</b> divergence: 1) only occurs in uptrends, and 2) mostly only {{leads to a}} brief {{correction}} instead of a reversal in trend. Therefore, <b>bearish</b> divergence is a sign confirming an uptrend. Similarly, bullish divergence is a sign confirming a downtrend.|$|E
50|$|A <b>bearish</b> {{reversal}} bar {{would be}} the opposite.|$|E
