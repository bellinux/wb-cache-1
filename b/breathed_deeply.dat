60|$|We {{heard it}} in the corner where the light had been, {{something}} which <b>breathed</b> <b>deeply</b> and fidgeted in the darkness.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Go' lumme!' remarked the shepherdess, smacking her lips, 'that was somethin' like!' And she put out {{her tongue}} and licked her lips, and then <b>breathed</b> <b>deeply.</b>|$|E
60|$|Bella ceased and <b>breathed</b> <b>deeply,</b> {{the while}} she clasped her fine small {{hands in her}} ample silken lap. But her pink {{fairness}} blushed faintly through her skin and warmed {{her eyes as she}} relived her prince-days.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Breathing</b> <b>deeply</b> and {{coughing}} {{to clear}} mucus as the pain eases. Otherwise, pneumonia may develop.|$|R
50|$|<b>Breathing</b> <b>deeply</b> as {{this will}} release any tension and promote {{relaxation}} {{which will allow}} you to reflect on the true emotions.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, it isn't like {{anything}} but itself!" [...] answered Diana, <b>breathing</b> <b>deeply.</b> [...] "Why, it's all cold, {{and yet it}} feels like fire." ...|$|R
6000|$|Lord Harry <b>breathed</b> <b>deeply.</b> [...] "If {{the man is}} in {{so serious}} a condition," [...] he said, [...] "is it safe or prudent {{for us to be}} alone in the house without a servant and without a nurse?" ...|$|E
6000|$|There was a portentous silence. Percy {{stared at}} the floor. Lady Caroline <b>breathed</b> <b>deeply.</b> Lord Marshmoreton, feeling that {{something}} was expected of him, said [...] "Good Gad!" [...] and gazed seriously at a stuffed owl on a bracket. Maud and Reggie Byng came in.|$|E
60|$|A sheet-iron stove {{made the}} place fairly comfortable. By a window sat a meek-faced woman, bent over some sewing. On a couch {{opposite}} lay Louise, {{covered by a}} heavy shawl. She was fast asleep, her hair disheveled and straying over her crimson cheeks, flushed from exposure to the weather. Her slumber seemed the result of physical exhaustion, for her lips were parted and she <b>breathed</b> <b>deeply.</b>|$|E
50|$|Being aware or {{conscious}} of one's <b>breathing.</b> <b>Breathing</b> <b>deeply</b> {{in a natural}} rhythm without being preoccupied by breathing. Inhaling and exhaling whilst in remembrance of God.|$|R
60|$|She paused, <b>breathing</b> <b>deeply,</b> {{a little}} frightened {{at her own}} eloquence. Something {{told her that she}} was not only {{addressing}} her own soul--she was speaking to his.|$|R
6000|$|... "And now," [...] {{said the}} incensed skipper, <b>breathing</b> <b>deeply</b> {{as the door}} closed and they walked up Liston Street, [...] "what the deuce {{do you mean by}} it?" ...|$|R
60|$|He <b>breathed</b> <b>deeply,</b> {{stirring}} at the thought. But {{he would}} not grow impatient. The train had halted over the town, where scarlet soldiers, and ludicrous blue sailors, and all the brilliant women from church shook like a kaleidoscope down the street. The train crawled on, drawing near to the sea, for which Siegmund waited breathless. It was so like Helena, blue, beautiful, strong in its reserve.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now," [...] said old Mr Clare to his wife, when he {{had read}} the envelope, [...] "if Angel proposes leaving Rio for a visit {{home at the end}} of next month, as he told us that he hoped to do, I think this may hasten his plans; for I believe it to be from his wife." [...] He <b>breathed</b> <b>deeply</b> at the thought of her; and the letter was {{redirected}} to be promptly sent on to Angel.|$|E
60|$|Perhaps it {{was that}} no man could expect {{to have the most}} momentous {{question}} of his life settled in a voice so level, so toneless, so devoid of joy or energy. At any rate William made no answer. She waited stoically. A moment later he stepped briskly from his dressing-room, and observed that if she wanted to buy more oysters he thought he knew where they could find a fishmonger's shop still open. She <b>breathed</b> <b>deeply</b> a sigh of relief.|$|E
60|$|STEPHEN: (With {{elaborate}} gestures, <b>breathing</b> <b>deeply</b> and slowly) You are my guests. Uninvited. By {{virtue of}} the fifth of George and seventh of Edward. History to blame. Fabled by mothers of memory.|$|R
5000|$|Reduced lung function, {{making it}} more {{difficult}} to <b>breathe</b> <b>deeply</b> and vigorously. <b>Breathing</b> may become more rapid and more shallow than normal, and a person's ability to engage in vigorous activities may be limited.|$|R
60|$|Billy {{grinned and}} rolled {{over on his}} side, his head uphill and his feet toward the fire. A couple of feet away Bridge paralleled him, and in five minutes both were <b>breathing</b> <b>deeply</b> in healthy slumber.|$|R
6000|$|As {{the hours}} of the {{afternoon}} went by he {{became more and more}} uneasy. [...] "I hope she'll turn up before dark, fer Harf is liable to get back any minute," [...] he said a dozen times, and when at last he saw her coming up the street with a woman in the seat beside her he <b>breathed</b> <b>deeply</b> and swore heartily in his relief. [...] "I guess my parable kind o' worked," [...] he said, exultantly. [...] "She's kept clear of the old goat this trip." ...|$|E
60|$|The day {{was spent}} before she {{realized}} it. At sunset the carpenters and mechanics left in two old Ford cars for town. The Mexicans had a {{camp in the}} cedars, and the Hoyles had theirs at the spring under the knoll where Carley had camped with Glenn and the Hutters. Carley watched the golden rosy sunset, and as the day ended she <b>breathed</b> <b>deeply</b> as if in unutterable relief. Supper found her with appetite {{she had long since}} lost. Twilight brought cold wind, the staccato bark of coyotes, the flicker of camp fires through the cedars. She tried to embrace all her sensations, but they were so rapid and many that she failed.|$|E
60|$|Otter loosed his grip, {{and diving}} {{beneath the surface}} swam hard for {{the north side of}} the pool, for there he had noticed that the current was least strong, and there also the rock bank {{overhung}} a little. He reached it safely, and rising once more grasped a knob of rock with one hand, and lay still where in the shadow and the swirl of waters he could not be discovered by any watching from above. He <b>breathed</b> <b>deeply</b> and moved his limbs; it was well, he was unhurt. The priest whom he had taken with him, being heaviest, had met the water first, so that though the leap was great the shock had been little.|$|E
50|$|IPPB may be {{indicated}} {{for patients}} {{who are at risk}} for developing atelectasis and who are unable or unwilling to <b>breathe</b> <b>deeply</b> without assistance. In patients with severe lung hyperinflation, IPPB may decrease dyspnea and discomfort during nebulized therapy.|$|R
60|$|Austen did not smile. She was {{speaking}} quietly, {{but he saw}} that she was <b>breathing</b> <b>deeply,</b> and he knew that she possessed a courage which went far beyond that of most women, and an insight into life and affairs.|$|R
60|$|What o'clock it was {{she could}} not guess. Averil was sound asleep, <b>breathing</b> <b>deeply</b> and regularly, so that it was; a {{pleasure}} to listen to her; and Mary did not fear wakening her by a shoeless voyage of discovery to the place whence Dr. May was visible.|$|R
60|$|Here {{they were}} within a {{plantation}} which formed the Abbey grounds, {{and taking a}} new hold of her he went onward a few steps till they reached the ruined choir of the Abbey-church. Against the north wall was the empty stone coffin of an abbot, in which every tourist with a turn for grim humour was accustomed to stretch himself. In this Clare carefully laid Tess. Having kissed her lips a second time he <b>breathed</b> <b>deeply,</b> as if a greatly desired end were attained. Clare then {{lay down on the}} ground alongside, when he immediately fell into the deep dead slumber of exhaustion, and remained motionless as a log. The spurt of mental excitement which had produced the effort was now over.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I <b>breathed</b> <b>deeply,</b> I revelled in {{the vastness}} of the opened horizon, in the {{different}} atmosphere that seemed to vibrate with the toil of life, with the energy of an impeccable world. This sky and this sea were open to me. The girl was right--there was a sign, a call in them--something to which I responded with every fibre of my being. I let my eyes roam through space, like a man released from bonds who stretches his cramped limbs, runs, leaps, responds to the inspiring elation of freedom. [...] "This is glorious!" [...] I cried, and then I looked at the sinner by my side. He sat with his head sunk on his breast and said [...] "Yes," [...] without raising his eyes, as if afraid to see writ large on the clear sky of the offing the reproach of his romantic conscience.|$|E
60|$|Laughingly, then bitterly, he rebuked {{himself for}} fear. And {{presently}} he was bespelled by {{the wonder of}} the unknown. Beyond the water through which they slid, black and smooth as polished basalt, he saw a lighthouse winking. From his steamer time-table he learned {{that it must be}} Great Gull Island light. Great Gull Island! It suggested to him thunderous cliffs with surf flung up on beetling rock, screaming gulls, and a smuggler on guard with menacing rifle. He lost his fear of fear; he ceased to think about his accustomed life of two aisles and the show-case of new models and the background of boxes and boxes and boxes of shoes--tokens of the drudgery that was ground into him like grit. The Father who worried was changing into the adventurous wanderer that henceforward he would be--for two weeks. He stretched out his short arms and <b>breathed</b> <b>deeply</b> of the night wind.|$|E
50|$|The {{practice}} of vegetotherapy involves the analyst enabling {{the patient to}} physically simulate the bodily effects of strong emotions. In this technique, the patient is asked to remove his or her outer clothing, lie down on a sheet-covered bed in the doctor's office, and <b>breathe</b> <b>deeply</b> and rhythmically.|$|R
50|$|This is {{your chance}} to travel back in time nearly 180 years. Hear the blasts of muskets firing; the {{pounding}} of horses' hooves; the chanting songs of Indiana braves. <b>Breathe</b> <b>deeply</b> of the evening air filled with the sharp scent of gunpowder. Enjoy the breeze of a star-studded Indiana night.|$|R
5000|$|As the rebreather has {{a single}} [...] "pendulum" [...] {{breathing}} tube, the diver must <b>breathe</b> <b>deeply</b> to avoid carbon dioxide build-up. The counterlung is eight litres. As with all rebreathers, the diver should breathe continuously to keep the gas flowing over the absorbent. Dives on the unit are limited to 90 minutes.|$|R
6000|$|When {{the concert}} was over, the stout, pink lady--who was {{the wife of}} an American millionaire--took her under her wing, and {{introduced}} her to everybody; and everybody was very nice to her. The professional elocutionist, Mrs. Evans, came and chatted with her, telling {{her that she had}} a charming voice and [...] "interpreted" [...] her selections beautifully. Even the white-lace girl paid her a languid little compliment. They had supper in the big, beautifully decorated dining room; Diana and Jane were invited to partake of this, also, since they had come with Anne, but Billy was nowhere to be found, having decamped in mortal fear of some such invitation. He was in waiting for them, with the team, however, when it was all over, and the three girls came merrily out into the calm, white moonshine radiance. Anne <b>breathed</b> <b>deeply,</b> and looked into the clear sky beyond the dark boughs of the firs.|$|E
6000|$|Across {{the black}} {{square of the}} window drifted the stray lights of the countryside, {{and from time to}} time, when the train stopped, she gazed out, unheeding, at the figures moving along the dim station platforms. Suddenly, without premeditation or effort, she began to live over again the day, {{beginning}} with the wonders, half revealed, half hidden, of that journey through the whiteness to Boston.... Awakened, listening, she heard beating louder and louder on the shores of consciousness the waves of the storm which had swept her away--waves like crashing chords of music. She <b>breathed</b> <b>deeply,</b> she turned her face to the window, seeming to behold reflected there, as in a crystal, all her experiences, little and great, great and little. She was seated once more leaning back {{in the corner of the}} carriage on her way to the station, she felt Ditmar's hand working in her own, and she heard his voice pleading forgiveness--for her silence alarmed him. And she heard herself saying:--"It was my fault as much as yours." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good-bye, Lise," [...] she said. [...] "I'll {{come down}} again I'll come down {{whenever}} you want me." [...] Lise suddenly seized her and clung to her, sobbing. For a while Janet submitted, and then, kissing her, gently detached herself. She felt, indeed, pity for Lise, but something within her seemed to have hardened--something that pity could not melt, possessing her and thrusting heron to action. She knew not what action. So strong was this thing that it overcame and drove off the evil spirits of that darkened house as she descended the stairs to join Mr. Tiernan, who {{opened the door for}} her to pass out. Once in the street, she <b>breathed</b> <b>deeply</b> of the sunlit air. Nor did she observe Mr. Tiernan's glance of comprehension.... When they arrived at the North Station he said:--"You'll be wanting a bite of dinner, Miss Janet," [...] and as she shook her head he did not press her to eat. He told her that a train for Hampton left in ten minutes. [...] "I think I'll stay in Boston the rest of the day, as long as I'm here," [...] he added.|$|E
60|$|She swung {{about with}} a start, her music {{dropping}} to the floor, {{and stared at}} him. Her tattered blue kimono fell away at her elbows, her full throat was bare, and a slipper she had kicked off {{lay on the floor}} beside her. He recoiled a little, <b>breathing</b> <b>deeply.</b> She stared at him.|$|R
50|$|Different {{types of}} {{diseases}} or conditions {{that affect the}} chest include pleurisy, flail chest, atelectasis, and the most common condition, chest pain. These conditions can be hereditary or caused by birth defects or trauma. Any condition that lowers the ability to either <b>breathe</b> <b>deeply</b> or to cough is considered a chest disease or condition.|$|R
25|$|Rib fractures, {{common in}} breast, {{prostate}} and other cancers with rib metastases, can cause brief severe pain on twisting the trunk, coughing, laughing, <b>breathing</b> <b>deeply</b> or moving between sitting and lying. In breast, prostate or lung cancer, multiple myeloma {{and some other}} cancers, sudden onset limb or back pain may indicate pathological bone fracture (most often in the upper femur).|$|R
