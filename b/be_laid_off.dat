5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} the company confirmed, on 19 February 2007, that 130 workers would <b>be</b> <b>laid</b> <b>off</b> {{for a period}} of twenty days due to a drop in product sales. The Transport and General Workers' Union then called for the government to provide compensation to the workers affected. The Transport and General Workers' Union paid out hardship monies from union funds to union members, on top of any state benefits to which the laid-off workers were entitled and a one-off £100 payment from Bernard Matthews.|$|E
5|$|Lester becomes {{infatuated}} with Jane's vain cheerleader friend, Angela Hayes, after seeing her perform a half-time dance routine {{at a high}} school basketball game with Jane. He starts having sexual fantasies about Angela, in which red rose petals are a recurring motif. Carolyn begins an affair with her married business rival, Buddy Kane. When Lester's boss and efficiency expert, Brad, tells him that he is to <b>be</b> <b>laid</b> <b>off,</b> Lester instead blackmails him for $60,000 and quits his job. Lester continues his liberation by taking a minimum-wage job at a fast-food restaurant, trading his Toyota Camry for a 1970 Pontiac Firebird, and starts working out after he overhears Angela tell Jane that she would find him sexually attractive if he got in shape. He begins smoking marijuana supplied by Ricky. The girls' friendship wanes after Jane starts a relationship with Ricky. Jane and Ricky bond over what Ricky considers the most beautiful imagery he has filmed: a plastic bag being blown in the wind.|$|E

Later that year, CCA joined the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) Local 200United, members of which also protested in September 2015. The school was also demanding CCA cut ties with SEIU {{in order for the}} union workers to keep their jobs. On September 22, 2017, CCA held another protest; 17 of the 45 workers represented in the union are scheduled to <b>be</b> <b>laid</b> <b>off</b> and replaced by workers of LCS Facility Group.

Those players {{went as far as}} taking strike action before a pre-season friendly at Hull City, even though Wetherall, as their Professional Footballers' Association representative, had initially denied they would do so, before the club was saved and players reinstated. Wetherall played in the club's opening game of the season as Bradford drew 0–0 with Wolverhampton Wanderers live on television, but was again ruled out through an injury, this time to his hip. A planned comeback was put off five weeks later, before he sought the advice of a specialist in Denmark. After sitting out another three months through injury, Wetherall made his return as a substitute against Gillingham in December 2002 but was again injured in a reserve team comeback three days later. He again returned in February 2003 against Coventry City and played 15 games during the final three months of the season.|$|E

25|$|The {{introduction}} of new legislation has made offshore financial services a rapidly growing economic sector in Nevis. Incorporation of companies, international insurance and reinsurance, {{as well as several}} international banks, trust companies, asset management firms, have created a boost in the economy. During 2005, the Nevis Island Treasury collected $94.6 million in annual revenue, compared to $59.8 million during 2001. In 1998, 17,500 international banking companies were registered in Nevis. Registration and annual filing fees paid in 1999 by these entities amounted to over 10 percent of Nevis’ revenues. The offshore financial industry gained importance during the financial disaster of 1999 when Hurricane Lenny damaged the major resort on the island, causing the hotel to be closed down for a year and 400 of the 700 employees to <b>be</b> <b>laid</b> <b>off.</b>|$|E

In 1866, he served as {{chairman}} of the town council during {{one of the most difficult}} years the council has ever faced. A ratepayers' revolt nearly bankrupted the council, and many staff had to <b>be</b> <b>laid</b> <b>off,</b> and basic services discontinued. In December 1872, he was elected by his fellow city councillors as mayor for the coming year. Bishop later acted as returning officer for some of Christchurch City Council's elections. He was involved with many organisations in Christchurch's early history, often in a leading role as chairman, secretary, or treasurer. Bishop died at his home in Cranmer Square in 1887 having never been married, and he is buried in a family grave in Barbadoes Street Cemetery.|$|E
25|$|On 5 January 2009, Waterford Wedgwood entered receivership. On 30 January, {{workers at}} the Waterford Crystal plant in Kilbarry were told they would be losing their jobs. A {{statement}} issued by the receiver, Deloitte's David Carson, confirmed that, of the 670 employees, 480 of them would <b>be</b> <b>laid</b> <b>off.</b> The workers responded angrily to this unexpected decision and at least 100 of them began an unofficial sit-in in the visitors' gallery at the factory that night. They insisted they would refuse to leave until they had met with Carson. Following the revelations, there was a minor scuffle during which the main door to the visitors' centre was damaged. Local Sinn Féin Councillor Joe Kelly was amongst those who occupied the visitors' gallery. A meeting held the following day did little to resolve the conflict, with the sit-in continuing for almost two months until 22 March.|$|E

500|$|However, Looking Glass Studios {{experienced}} serious {{financial trouble}} as development progressed into mid-1997. The company's Austin branch closed, costing Spector and several game engine programmers; this team relocated to ION Storm, and released Deus Ex in 2000. Spector later called his impact on Thief, [...] "at best, minimal". Levine too had left The Dark Project project before the Keepers factions {{was added to}} the game. By April 18, Looking Glass Studios laid off half of its entire staff in six months, which damaged morale of The Dark Project team, which at this point was vastly different from the one with which the development began. [...] "Few emotions can compare to the stress of heading to work not knowing who might <b>be</b> <b>laid</b> <b>off,</b> including yourself, or whether the doors would be locked when you got there," [...] lead programmer Tom Leonard later said. This stress caused several team members to voluntarily quit, including the lead programmer (Briscoe Rogers) who had designed the game's AI system, which suffered from software bugs and problems with complexity.|$|E
500|$|In 1980, Buczynski and Muto went on {{a package}} holiday to Greece, further inspiring the former's {{interests}} in the region's ancient cultures. Deciding to explore this topic further, he enrolled to study for an undergraduate degree in Classics and Ancient History at Hunter College, {{a part of the}} City University of New York (CUNY) located in Manhattan's Upper East Side, beginning there in September 1980. At the university, he became friends with one of his mentors, the classical archaeologist Clairève Grandjouan, and was saddened by her death before he had completed the course. He devoted himself to his studies, which he greatly enjoyed, and was sufficiently successful to be placed on the Thomas Hunter Honors Program. In June 1982, he returned to Greece in order to take part in his first archaeological excavations, which were run by the American School of Classical Studies at Athens (ASCSA). Returning to New York City, he began to take all of the modules that he could which were devoted to field archaeology, considering a potential career in the profession. In the winter break between 1982 and 1983, he once more returned to the Mediterranean, [...] touring Greece and Italy with Muto. He would subsequently <b>be</b> <b>laid</b> <b>off</b> from his job, but gained work in the Hunter College Classics Office. His increased interest in academic archaeology came at the expense of his involvement in the occult, and in the Spring of 1981 he stepped down from his leadership of the Knossos Grove coven, handing control over to Tony Fiara. As his studies at Hunter College came to an end, he decided to continue his education to a postgraduate level, and successfully obtained a scholarship from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.|$|E
