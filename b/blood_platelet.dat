Hollenberg, {{professor of medicine}} at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School found that flavonols may also help vessels dilate and help keep platelets from clustering on the blood vessel walls. Flavonoids found in hot chocolate are beneficial to health mainly because they shield the walls of blood vessels from free radical damage. Flavanols are also thought to help reduce <b>blood</b> <b>platelet</b> buildup and can balance levels of compounds called eicosanoids, which may be beneficial to cardiovascular health.|$|E

40|$|The {{concentration}} and uptake of taurine in the umbilical and adult <b>blood</b> <b>platelets</b> were studied. Taurine {{was the most}} abundant free amino acid in both umbilical and adult <b>blood</b> <b>platelets.</b> The taurine concentration in umbilical <b>blood</b> <b>platelets</b> (2. 30 pmoles/ 10 (4) cells) was significantly {{lower than that of}} adult <b>blood</b> <b>platelets</b> (3. 27 pmoles/ 10 (4) cells) in contrast to the reverse relationship in taurine concentrations in umbilical and adult blood plasma. No other amino acid showed such significant difference in the concentrations between umbilical and adult <b>blood</b> <b>platelets.</b> Taurine uptake into umbilical <b>blood</b> <b>platelets</b> was temperature sensitive and sodium-dependent {{in a manner similar to}} that of adult <b>blood</b> <b>platelets.</b> The uptake conformed well to Hanes-plot. The Vmax of the uptake into adult <b>blood</b> <b>platelets</b> was about 3. 6 times higher than that of umbilical <b>blood</b> <b>platelets,</b> but no significant difference was seen in the Km value between the two groups. </p...|$|R

One 2015 study reported that Imetelstat caused partial or complete remission in seven of 33 patients, while a second reported that it decreased <b>blood</b> <b>platelet</b> levels in all 18 study patients with essential thrombocythemia, a disorder in which the body overproduces blood platelets, increasing the risk of blood clots.|$|E

500|$|While {{promoting}} See You on the Other Side in Europe, Jonathan Davis {{was diagnosed}} with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, a <b>blood</b> <b>platelet</b> disorder that hospitalized him for the weekend and prevented him from performing at the renowned Download Festival. Despite the illness, the band still performed, with guest singers including Corey Taylor of Slipknot and Stone Sour fame, Trivium's Matt Heafy, Skindred's Benji Webbe and Avenged Sevenfold's M. Shadows. This led to Korn canceling {{the rest of their}} European bill for 2006, including the Hellfest Summer Open Air.

2500|$|Gaucher's {{disease or}} Gaucher disease (...) (GD) is a genetic {{disorder}} in which glucocerebroside (a sphingolipid, {{also known as}} glucosylceramide) accumulates in cells and certain organs. The disorder is characterized by bruising, fatigue, anemia, low <b>blood</b> <b>platelet</b> count and enlargement of the liver and spleen, and {{is caused by a}} hereditary deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase (also known as glucosylceramidase), which acts on glucocerebroside. When the enzyme is defective, glucocerebroside accumulates, particularly in white blood cells and especially in macrophages (mononuclear leukocytes). Glucocerebroside can collect in the spleen, liver, kidneys, lungs, brain, and bone marrow.|$|E

Despite various scientific papers that focused on early stage of MS, our study targets selective group of late stage secondary progressive MS patients. The presented work is concerned with the reactivity of <b>blood</b> <b>platelets</b> in primary hemostasis in SP MS patients. 50 SP MS patients and 50 healthy volunteers (never diagnosed with MS or other chronic diseases) were examined to evaluate the biological activity of <b>blood</b> <b>platelets</b> (adhesion, aggregation), especially their response to the most important physiological agonists (thrombin, ADP, and collagen) and the effect of oxidative stress on platelet activity. We found that the <b>blood</b> <b>platelets</b> from SP MS patients were significantly more sensitive to all used agonists in comparison with control group. Moreover, the platelet hemostatic function was advanced in patients suffering from SP MS and positively correlated with increased production of in these cells, as well as with Expanded Disability Status Scale. We postulate that the increased oxidative stress in <b>blood</b> <b>platelets</b> in SP MS may be primarily responsible for the altered haemostatic properties of <b>blood</b> <b>platelets.</b> Grants nos. 506 / 1136 and 545 / 785 from University of Lodz...|$|R

40|$|A {{study has}} been made of the {{variation}} in number of the <b>blood</b> <b>platelets,</b> and the red and white blood cells of white mice injected with pneumococcus extract. The <b>blood</b> <b>platelets</b> were greatly diminished after the injection, the greatest decrease usually occurring after 24 hours. Purpuric lesions usually developed when the number of <b>blood</b> <b>platelets</b> became less than 500, 000 per c. mm. Regeneration of the platelets was accomplished by the 4 th to the 9 th day but there was an overregeneration and the return to normal did not take place until 2 weeks had elapsed. The red cells were also greatly reduced in number, but the rate of their destruction and regeneration was somewhat slower than that of the platelets. The leucocytes were slightly if at all influenced by the pneumococcus extract. Pneumococcus extracts were shown to be thrombolytic and hemolytic. Heat destroyed the activity of both the lysins in vitro. Heated extract produced purpura in mice but did not cause a severe anemia. Extracts adsorbed with either <b>blood</b> <b>platelets</b> or red <b>blood</b> cells showed a marked diminution in their thrombolytic and hemolytic activity in vitro.
