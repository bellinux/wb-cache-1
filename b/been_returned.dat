5|$|In 1847 a small {{political}} crisis occurred which removed Bentinck from {{the leadership and}} highlighted Disraeli's differences with his own party.

As a practising Jew he could not take the oath of allegiance in the prescribed Christian form, and therefore could not take his seat.

5|$|None of the {{submarines}} were complete when World War I {{began in}} August 1914. With the boats under construction at Kiel, the Austrians {{became convinced that}} {{it would be impossible to}} take delivery of the boats, which would need to be towed into the Mediterranean past Gibraltar, a British territory. As a result, the five boats of the class were transferred to the Imperial German Navy on 28 November 1914 after the advance payment of 2 million Kronen had <b>been</b> <b>returned.</b> Germaniawerft was then awarded Kriegsauftrag D, hence the type was known as UD.|$|E

At the Diet assembled on this occasion, the newly crowned King confirmed the liberties of the nobility. Hereafter the legality of Matthias's reign could not be questioned.|$|E
5|$|Security, {{services}} and logistics {{at the reception}} centres were provided by the military component of UNTAG, {{and a number of}} secondary reception centres were also established. The movement of returnees through the centres was quick, and the repatriation programme was very successful; a UN official report stated that the psychological impact of the return of so many exiles was perceptible throughout the country. There were some problems reported in the north, where ex-Koevoet elements searched villages for SWAPO returnees; however, the UN reported that this was kept under constant surveillance by UNTAG's police monitors. By the end of the process, 42,736 Namibians had <b>been</b> <b>returned</b> from exile.|$|E

5|$|The Klondike's {{choice of}} {{programming}} earned it a negative reputation, and Towne Cinema {{was unable to}} run the Klondike profitably. The company sought buyers for the theatre as early as 1976, asking $600,000. But, despite all of the theatre's problems under Towne Cinema, {{it is unlikely that}} it would have <b>been</b> <b>returned</b> to its original use without the money they poured into its renovation. Their efforts to restore the building are a significant reason why the Princess is a cinema today.|$|E
5|$|The {{object of}} the game is to collect the eight pieces of the Android Queen's body then stitch her back {{together}} again. The player must first find and approach the refrigerator in order to be told where the first body part can be found. Once this has <b>been</b> <b>returned</b> to the player's trapped father, the next body part location will be revealed. Once all eight body parts have been collected and returned to the refrigerator, the player must find a needle and thread in order to restore the Android Queen. The location of the refrigerator is randomized {{at the beginning of each}} new game.|$|E
5|$|The ponies {{collect the}} Elements and re-approach Discord, who casually passes off their threat. However, with all six ponies restored, the Elements activate, firing a rainbow-beam {{of light that}} engulfs Discord and Ponyville. In moments, Ponyville has <b>been</b> <b>returned</b> to normal and Discord is once again turned to stone. The ponies' victory is celebrated by a large {{ceremony}} at Canterlot, led by Celestia, who praises their heroism {{and the power of}} their friendship and reveals a new stained-glass window of the six ponies defeating Discord.|$|E
