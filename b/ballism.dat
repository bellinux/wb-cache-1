25|$|Paroxysmal kinesigenic choreathetosis (PKC) {{also called}} {{paroxysmal}} kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD) is a hyperkinetic movement disorder characterized by attacks of involuntary movements, which are triggered by sudden voluntary movements. The number of attacks can increase during puberty and decrease in a person's 20s to 30s. Involuntary movements {{can take many}} forms such as <b>ballism,</b> chorea or dystonia and usually only affect {{one side of the}} body or one limb in particular. This rare disorder only affects about 1 in 150,000 people with PKD accounting for 86.8% of all the types of paroxysmal dyskinesias and occurs more often in males than females. There are two types of PKD, primary and secondary. Primary PKD can be further broken down into familial and sporadic. Familial PKD, which means the individual has a family history of the disorder, is more common, but sporadic cases are also seen. Secondary PKD can be caused by many other medical conditions such as multiple sclerosis (MS), stroke, pseudohypoparathyroidism, hypocalcemia, hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, central nervous system trauma, or peripheral nervous system trauma. PKD has also been linked with infantile convulsions and choreoathetosis (ICCA) syndrome, in which patients have afebrile seizures during infancy (benign familial infantile epilepsy) and then develop paroxysmal choreoathetosis later in life. This phenomenon is actually quite common, with about 42% of individuals with PKD reporting a history of afebrile seizures as a child.|$|E

50|$|ITB TherapyIntrathecal {{baclofen}} (ITB) {{therapy is}} used to treat a variety of movement disorders such as cerebral palsy and multiple sclerosis. It {{can also be a}} possibility to help treat hemiballismus. In one case, before ITB the patient had an average of 10-12 <b>ballism</b> episodes of the right lower limb per hour. During episodes, the right hip would flex up to about 90 degrees, with a fully extended knee. After an ITB pump was implanted and the correct dosage was found, the frequency of ballistic right leg movements decreased to about three per day, and the right hip flexed to only 30 degrees. The patient was also able to better isolate individual distal joint movements in the right lower limb. The patient currently receives 202.4 microg/day of ITB and continues to benefit almost 6 years after the ITB pump was implanted.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Ballism</b> {{was defined}} by Meyers in 1968 as [...] "Repetitive, but {{constantly}} varying, large amplitude involuntary movements of the proximal parts of the limbs. This activity is almost ceaseless and movements are often complex and combined". Hemiballismus is usually characterized by involuntary flinging motions of the extremities. The movements are often violent and have wide amplitudes of motion. They are continuous and random and can involve proximal or distal muscles {{on one side of}} the body. Some cases even include the facial muscles. It is common for arms and legs to move together. The more a patient is active, the more the movements increase. With relaxation comes a decrease in movements. Physicians can measure the severity of the disorder by having the patient perform a series of basic, predetermined tasks and counting the hemiballistic movements during a set time session. The physicians then rate the patient on a severity scale. This scale gives scientists and clinicians a way to compare patients and determine the range of the disorder.|$|E

40|$|In {{previous}} studies {{we have shown}} that hemichorea can be induced in the conscious monkey by localized injection of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) antagonists into the contralateral lentiform complex. It {{has been argued that}} the primary site of drug action in inducing chorea is the lateral segment of the globus pallidus. In the present study, the neural mechanisms which underlie this experimental dyskinesia were investigated by two separate approaches. First, the efferent projections of the lentiform complex were mapped using neuroanatomical tracing techniques. This involved injecting horseradish peroxide into sites which had previously given chorea when injected with the GABA antagonist bicuculline. Secondly, the 2 -deoxyglucose (2 -DG) metabolic mapping technique was applied to animals during active dyskinesia. This procedure permitted the autoradiographic measurement of local cerebral glucose uptake which was used as an index of regional synaptic activity. In both instances, the strongest labelling was seen in the dorsolateral region of the subthalamic nucleus. On the basis of this finding it is suggested that the pallidosubthalamic pathway plays {{a crucial role in the}} mediation of experimentally-induced chorea. Specifically, the pallidosubthalamic pathway arising from the lateral pallidal segment is abnormally overactive, which causes physiological inhibition of the subthalamic nucleus. The pattern of 2 -DG uptake in the medial segment of the globus pallidus and thalamus was similar to that seen in animals with experimentally-induced <b>ballism.</b> This similarity is interpreted as suggesting that a common neural mechanism underlies both experimentally-induced chorea and <b>ballism...</b>|$|E
40|$|Models of {{basal ganglia}} {{function}} are described which encapsulate the principal pathophysiological mechanisms underlying parkinsonian akinesia {{on the one}} hand and abnormal involuntary movement disorders (dyskinesias) on the other. In Parkinson's disease, degeneration of the nigrostriatal dopamine system leads to overactivity of the ‘indirect’ striatopallidal projection to the lateral (external) segment of the globus pallidus. This causes inhibition of lateral pallidal neurons, which in turn project to the subthalamic nucleus. Disinhibition of the subthalamic nucleus leads to abnormal subthalamic overactivity and, as a consequence, overactivity of medial (internal) pallidal output neurons. Dyskinesias, such as are observed in Huntington's disease, levodopa-induced dyskinesia and <b>ballism,</b> share mechanistic features in common and are associated with decreased neuronal activity in both the subthalamic nucleus and the medial globus pallidus...|$|E

40|$|Dystonia {{is defined}} as a {{neurological}} syndrome characterized by involuntary sustained or intermittent muscle contractions causing twisting, often repetitive movements and postures. Paroxysmal dyskinesias are episodic movement disorders encompassing dystonia, chorea, athetosis and <b>ballism</b> in conscious individuals. Several decades of research have enhanced the understanding of the etiology of human dystonia and dyskinesias that are associated with dystonia, but the pathophysiology remains largely unknown. The spontaneous occurrence of hereditary dystonia and paroxysmal dyskinesia is well documented in rodents used as animal models in basic dystonia research. Several hyperkinetic movement disorders, described in dogs, horses and cattle, show similarities to these human movement disorders. Although dystonia is regarded as the third most common movement disorder in humans, it is often misdiagnosed because of the heterogeneity of etiology and clinical presentation. Since these conditions are poorly known in veterinary practice, their prevalence may be underestimated in veterinary medicine. In order to attract attention to these movement disorders, i. e. dystonia and paroxysmal dyskinesias associated with dystonia, and to enhance interest in translational research, this review gives a brief overview of the current literature regarding dystonia/paroxysmal dyskinesia in humans, and summarizes similar hereditary movement disorders reported in domestic animals...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Normal brain {{development}} and function {{depend on the}} active transport of folates across the blood-brain barrier. The folate receptor- 1 (FR 1) protein is localized at the basolateral surface of the choroid plexus, which {{is characterized by a}} high binding affinity for circulating 5 -methyltetrahydrofolate (5 - MTHF). Patients and Methods: We report on the clinical and metabolic findings among five children with normal neurodevelopmental progress during the first four to six months followed by the acquisition of a neurological condition which includes marked irritability, decelerating head growth, psychomotor retardation, cerebellar ataxia, dyskinesias (choreoathetosis, <b>ballism),</b> pyramidal signs in the lower limbs and occasional seizures. After the age of six years the two oldest patients also manifested a central visual disorder. Known disorders have been ruled out by extensive investigations. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis included determination of biogenic monoamines, pterins and 5 -MTHF. Results: Despite normal folate levels in serum and red blood cells with normal homocysteine, analysis of CSF revealed a decline towards very low values for 5 -methyltetrahydrofolate (5 -MTHF), which suggested disturbed transport of folates across the blood-brain barrier. Genetic analysis of the FR 1 gene revealed normal coding sequences. Oral treatment with doses of the stable compound folinic acid (0. 5 - 1 mg/kg/day Leucovorin®) resulted in clinical amelioration and normalization of 5 -MTHF values in CSF. Conclusion: Our findings identified a new condition manifesting after the age of 6 months which was accompanied by low 5 -MTHF in cerebrospinal fluid and responded to oral supplements with folinic acid. However, the cause of disturbed folate transfer across the blood-brain barrier remains unknown. Peer reviewe...|$|E
