2500|$|Buffett {{favors the}} {{inheritance}} tax, saying that repealing {{it would be}} like [...] "choosing the 2020 Olympic team by picking the eldest sons of the gold-medal winners in the 2000 Olympics". In 2007, Buffett testified before the Senate and urged them to preserve the estate tax so as to avoid a plutocracy. Some critics argued that Buffett (through Berkshire Hathaway) has a personal interest in the continuation of the estate tax, since Berkshire Hathaway benefited from the estate tax in past business dealings and had developed and marketed insurance policies to protect policy holders against future estate tax payments. Buffett believes government should not <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>business</b> of gambling, or legalizing casinos, calling it a tax on ignorance.|$|E

It's {{not part of the}} Constitution. If you allow an economy to thrive, they'll decide how R works or where they invest their monies. But when the politicians get in and direct things, you get the malinvestment.” Similarly, in an October 2011 presidential primary campaign debate, he said, “The government shouldn't <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>business</b> of subsidizing any form of energy.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Much of Walt Disney's {{plans for}} his Progress City were {{abandoned}} {{after his death}} after the company board decided {{that it did not}} want to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>business</b> of running a city. The concept evolved into the resort's second theme park, EPCOT Center (renamed Epcot in 1996), which opened in 1982. While still emulating Walt Disney's original idea of showcasing new technology, it is closer to a world's fair than a [...] "community of tomorrow". Some of the urban planning concepts from the original idea of EPCOT would instead be integrated into the community of Celebration much later. The resort's third theme park, Disney-MGM Studios (renamed Disney's Hollywood Studios in 2008), opened in 1989 and is inspired by show business. The resort's fourth theme park, Disney's Animal Kingdom, opened in 1998.|$|E

There is a great deal of difference between being diligent in the business in the shop, and leading the whole business of the shop. An apprentice who is diligent may be master of his business, but should never be master of the shop; the one is to be useful to his master, the other is to be master of his master; and, indeed, this shows the absolute necessity of diligence and application in a tradesman, and how, for want of it, that very thing which is the blessing of another tradesman's business is the ruin of his.|$|E
