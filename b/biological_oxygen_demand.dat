Lake Nasser has good water quality with only small organic {{substance}} concentrations, which makes its water a reference point for water quality along the river and its branches. According to reports by the Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency, in 2007 average organic loads in 11 governorates along the Nile remained below the allowed limit of 6mg/liter of <b>biological</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>demand</b> (BOD). This is due to the high self-assimilation capacity of the Nile. However, in the same year chemical oxygen demand was above the allowed limit of 10mg/liter in 7 of 11 governorates. The report does not include data for some governorates on the Nile such as Monufia and Sharqia. The average level of dissolved oxygen was slightly higher than the allowed minimum of 5mg/liter in all governorates.

25|$|The {{advantages}} of manure treatment are {{a reduction in}} the amount of manure that needs to be transported and applied to crops, as well as reduced soil compaction. Nutrients are reduced as well, meaning that less cropland is needed for manure to be spread upon. Manure treatment can also reduce the risk of human health and biosecurity risks by reducing the amount of pathogens present in manure. Undiluted animal manure or slurry is one hundred times more concentrated than domestic sewage, and can carry an intestinal parasite, Cryptosporidium, which is difficult to detect but can be passed to humans. Silage liquor (from fermented wet grass) is even stronger than slurry, with a low pH and very high <b>biological</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>demand.</b> With a low pH, silage liquor can be highly corrosive; it can attack synthetic materials, causing damage to storage equipment, and leading to accidental spillage. All of these advantages can be optimized by using the right manure management system on the right farm based on the resources that are available.|$|E
25|$|The {{impacts of}} human habitation, {{particularly}} the inadequate {{treatment of sewage}} effluent, {{and the growth of}} mining in the upper reaches and the processing of metals in the Sheffield area have resulted in serious pollution of the river, and the depletion of fish stocks, to the extent that large parts of the Don contained no fish until the mid-1980s. Concerted efforts have been made to improve the water quality, by reducing the concentration of metals, the ammonia content, and the <b>biological</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>demand</b> (BOD), which {{is a measure of the}} amount of oxygen that is needed by organisms to break down organic matter in the water. Sewage treatment works on the Don, notably those at Cheesebottom, on the west bank of the river at Thurgoland and Blackburn Meadows at Tinsley, have been upgraded, as has that at Darton on the River Dearne. This has led to a great improvement in ammonia levels and BOD, further aided by the construction of biological treatment facilities for the processing of industrial effluent in the Doncaster area, while the decline in the steel industry in Sheffield has reduced the discharge of metals into the river.|$|E
25|$|Surface and {{groundwater}} in the Barada basin is polluted by industrial and domestic wastewater, {{as well as}} by agricultural non-point sources such as fertilizers and pesticides. Much of the wastewater generated from industrial activities in Greater Damascus is discharged into the environment, mainly to the Barada River, without prior treatment. The uncontrolled disposal of toxic, chemical products, primarily from lead industries and battery manufactories, has also resulted in severe soil pollution. There is no pre-treatment of industrial wastewater discharged into the sewer network. As a result, the largest wastewater treatment plant of Damascus in Adra frequently malfunctions. Measured concentrations of <b>biological</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>demand</b> (BOD), a measure of organic water pollution, exceeded the allowed limits in most of the branches of the Barada River. According to the Syrian National Environmental Action Plan of 2003, concentrations of BOD and ammonia in the Barada River exceeded Syrian Standards for 86% of collected samples between 1995 and 2000. Well and spring water in the basin is bacteriologically contaminated because of sewage discharge.

In parallel, enhanced levels of total proteins, total lipids, cholesterol, glucose and creatinine were estimated in blood of fish inhabiting the polluted areas. It can be concluded that biochemical parameters that fluctuated in response to deleterious effects of pollution could be ranked as possible biomarkers of pollution.

2500|$|Due to the {{increase}} in temperature of the soil, CO2 levels in our atmosphere increase, the mean average temperature of the Earth is rising. This is due to man's activities such as forest clearing, soil denuding, developments that destroy autotrophic processes. With the loss of photosynthetic plants covering and cooling the surface of the soil, the infrared energy penetrates the soil heating it up and causing a rise in heterotrophic bacteria. Heterotrophs in the soil quickly degrade the organic matter and soil structure crumbles thus it dissolves into streams, rivers into the sea. Much of the organic matter swept away in floods caused by forest clearing goes into estuaries, wetlands and eventually into the open ocean. Increased turbidity of surface waters causes <b>biological</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>demand</b> and more autotrophic organisms die in the wake of man's destruction. Carbon dioxide levels rise with increased respiration of soil bacteria after temperatures rise due to loss of soil cover.|$|E

In industrial processes, recycling of process streams is necessary to minimise fresh water requirements and decrease the amount of wastewater produced. This leads to increases in various substances, both volatile and non-volatile which inhibit fermentation.

In this paper, the physicochemical characteristics of paper mill effluents and the accumulation of heavy metals (Cu, Zn, Pb, Co, Cd, Cr, and Ni) in the soil and different parts (roof, leaf, and seed) of the paddy crops growing in the irrigated area are described and compared with the soil and paddy crops irrigated by natural waters (unpolluted). Chemical and <b>biological</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>demands</b> of wastewater were found to be 437 and 1070 ppm respectively, which are beyond the tolerance limits set by Indian standards. The total dissolved and suspended solids are 1754 and 990 ppm respectively.

The heavy metal uptake by plants shows the greatest accumulation of Cu, Cr, Co, and Pb in the roots: Cd and Ni in the leaves; and Zn in the seeds of rice. The heavy metal content of the soil and their total uptake by paddy roots has the relation: Pb > Zn > Cu > Cd and Pb > Cu > Zn > Cd.

Dietary plant polyphenols are the subject of increasing scientific interest because of their possible beneficial effects on human health. Recent studies suggested that action of polyphenols goes beyond the modulation of oxidative stress and can improve several physiopathological conditions. In the present study, we investigated the possible effects of polyphenols extracted from olive pomace (PEOP) and of the main single phenolic compounds present in the extract (tyrosol, apigenin and oleuropein) in protecting hepatocytes against excess fat and oxidative stress. PEOP were extracted using a high pressure-temperature agitated reactor (25 bar, 180 °C for 90 min). A mixture of ethanol:water (50 : 50 v/v) was used as extraction solvents resulting to total polyphenol concentration of 5. 77 mgCaffeic Acid Equivalent/mL. In order to test the biological effects of the extract we used rat hepatoma FaO cells exposed to a mixture of oleate/palmitate (2 : 1 molar ratio) for 3 h which represent a reliable in vitro model for hepatic steatosis. After lipid-loading, hepatic cells were incubated for 24 h in the absence or in the presence of 10 μg/mL tyrosol, 13 μg/mL apigenin or 50 μg/mL oleuropein.
