Just {{north of the}} toll booth is {{northbound}} access to Harding Avenue and Pennyfield Avenue.

The only other interchange between there and the terminus is Randall Avenue.|$|E
5|$|Campbell's dwarf hamster has cheek pouches, {{which are}} an {{extension}} of the mouth, extending from the mouth {{all the way to the}} rear legs. Food is transferred into these pouches through the diastema. The inside of the pouch contains a large number of folds of dermal papillae. When the pouch is full, it extends and <b>becomes</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> structure of the skin. By 11 days of age, the cheek pouches are fully grown and can carry objects up to the size of a sunflower seed. When the cheek pouches become full, they extend back to the shoulder blades, which restrict movement.|$|E

5|$|In Mahoning County, {{the route}} <b>becomes</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eastern city limits of Canfield, meeting US 224 at a parclo interchange. The highway crosses over the Ohio Turnpike, and becomes {{concurrent}} with I-80 few miles later. Here, {{most of the}} route is surrounded by urban areas. The interchange with I-80 and I-680 is incomplete, with ramps from I-680 west to I-80 east and I-80 west to I-680 east missing. I-80 and SR 11 travel northeast, leaves Mahoning County, and enters Trumbull County. SR 11 and I-80 split at the interchange at SR 711, east of Girard. This interchange is also incomplete, with ramps from I-80 east to SR 711 south and SR 711 to I-80 west missing.|$|E
5|$|The short channel splits into Newmill Channel and Reading Sewer {{a little}} further to the north, the first flowing southwards, and the second {{originally}} flowing northwards, when it was the main channel for the River Rother. A public footpath follows the eastern bank of Potman's Heath Channel, and continues along the north {{bank of the river}} to Blackwall Bridge, where it <b>becomes</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sussex Border Path, a long-distance footpath that follows the county boundary.|$|E
5|$|As it {{continues}} through the Laguna Coast Wilderness Park, SR 133 follows a four-lane alignment {{on the west}} side of the canyon, moved from the old two-lane road in the center of the canyon in late 2006. Laguna Canyon Road splits to the northwest where the canyon ends in Irvine. North of the park, the highway becomes the Laguna Freeway after crossing an at-grade intersection with Laguna Canyon Road, followed by an interchange at exit 8, San Diego Freeway (I-405). SR 133 then continues as a freeway and serves Barranca Parkway and the Santa Ana Freeway (I-5). After crossing I-5, SR 133 <b>becomes</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Eastern Toll Road along the northwest side of Marine Corps Air Station El Toro, crossing an interchange with Irvine Boulevard at exit 12 before ending at SR 241.|$|E

50|$|In Czechoslovakia, {{the county}} {{continued}} to exist as the Hont county (Hontianska župa). In 1923, it <b>became</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Zvolen county. In 1928, it <b>became</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> newly created Slovak Land (Slovenská krajina/zem). Following <b>the</b> provisions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> First Vienna Award, <b>the</b> southern <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Czechoslovak Hont <b>became</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Hungary again in November 1938.

5|$|At a wye in the Porter {{hamlet of}} Blairville, NY18 breaks from its northsouth {{alignment}} {{and turns to}} the northeast before curving northward once more, returning to a perfect northsouth alignment at an intersection with NY93 in the hamlet of Towers Corners. Southwest of the Four Mile Creek State Park, NY18 turns a full 90 degrees {{to the east and}} begins to parallel the southern shore of Lake Ontario. Here, NY18 meets the northern terminus of NY18F, changes names from Creek Road to Lake Road, and <b>becomes</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Seaway Trail, a National Scenic Byway. The route proceeds northeast to Four Mile Creek State Park, where it intersects the northern end of the Robert Moses State Parkway.

5|$|Chief of Section D Ros Myers (Hermione Norris) {{introduces}} Lucas North (Richard Armitage) {{to one of}} Adam Carter's assets, Pakistani {{intelligence officer}} Marlin (Emilio Doorgasingh). Marlin has information about a planned attack by Al-Qaeda; a cell intends to create Internet chatter, followed by a dry run, after which they will commence a series of suicide attacks. The ringleader behind this is Nadif Abdelrashid (Ariyon Bakare) who was previously responsible for similar attacks in Turkey and Somalia. Ben Kaplan is in his first undercover operation disguised as a recent convert to Islam and <b>becomes</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cell. As part of his cover, Ben shares a flat with Jawad (Tariq Jordan), another member. However, {{over the course of}} the operation Ben becomes close to Jawad, which Ben's handler Lucas advises against, as Jawad is not an innocent.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the river}} reaches the {{outskirts}} of Hull, its course {{is marked by a}} series of bridges, most of which open to allow boats to pass. There are swing bridges, lift bridges and bascule bridges, and the river <b>becomes</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Port of Hull. The river, which is the dividing line between West and East Hull, bisects the city's industrial area. The bridges can cause traffic delays during high tides, though river traffic is less than it once was. The Beverley and Barmston Drain rejoins the river above Scott Street Bridge. Below North Bridge, an unused dry dock on the west bank marks the former entrance to Queens Dock. Below Drypool Bridge, a muddy basin on the east bank was once the entrance to Drypool Basin and Victoria Dock. The river reaches its confluence with the Humber estuary in the centre of Kingston upon Hull. At its mouth, a tidal barrier has been constructed to prevent tidal surges from entering the river. In the past, these had regularly flooded the town and the flat countryside to the north.|$|E

5|$|To make {{brominated}} polymers and plastics, bromine-containing compounds can {{be incorporated}} into the polymer during polymerisation. One method is to include a relatively small amount of brominated monomer during the polymerisation process. For example, vinyl bromide can be used in the production of polyethylene, polyvinylchloride or polypropylene. Specific highly brominated molecules can also be added that participate in the polymerisation process For example, tetrabromobisphenol A can be added to polyesters or epoxy resins, where it <b>becomes</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> polymer. Epoxys used in printed circuit boards are normally made from such flame retardant resins, indicated by the FR in the abbreviation of the products (FR-4 and FR-2). In some cases the bromine containing compound may be added after polymerisation. For example, decabromodiphenyl ether can be added to the final polymers.|$|E
5|$|Even more remarkably, {{there is}} a general set of laws known as black hole mechanics, which is {{analogous}} to the laws of thermodynamics. For instance, by the second law of black hole mechanics, the area of the event horizon of a general black hole will never decrease with time, analogous to the entropy of a thermodynamic system. This limits the energy that can be extracted by classical means from a rotating black hole (e.g. by the Penrose process). There is strong evidence that the laws of black hole mechanics are, in fact, a subset of the laws of thermodynamics, and that the black hole area is proportional to its entropy. This leads to a modification of the original laws of black hole mechanics: for instance, as the second law of black hole mechanics <b>becomes</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second law of thermodynamics, it is possible for black hole area to decrease—as long as other processes ensure that, overall, entropy increases. As thermodynamical objects with non-zero temperature, black holes should emit thermal radiation. Semi-classical calculations indicate that indeed they do, with the surface gravity playing the role of temperature in Planck's law. This radiation is known as Hawking radiation (cf. the quantum theory section, below).|$|E
