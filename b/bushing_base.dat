The relaxation in these constraints is inversely proportional to the streaming speed of the data. Since the caching and mining the streaming-data is sensitive, here in this paper a scalable, memory efficient caching and frequent itemset mining model is devised.

50|$|Jones also {{received}} considerable attention {{for his work}} with Ambassador James Dobbins on nation-building. Their RAND book America's Role in Nation-Building, which examined the U.S. history of nation-building since World War II, suggested that the U.S. needed nearly 500,000 soldiers to stabilize Iraq after the overthrow of Saddam Hussein's government. L. Paul Bremer, head of the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq, took the study to U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and President George W. <b>Bush.</b> <b>Based</b> on the study's conclusions, Bremer suggested that the United States military needed to reconsider downsizing its forces in Iraq and, on the contrary, increase them to help patrol cities and villages.

5000|$|Rimless glasses lenses {{are held}} in place (or [...] "mounted") {{by way of a}} series of screws, or hollow plastic double rivets (called [...] "{{bushings}}" [...] or [...] "compression plugs") that fit into two holes in the lens. When bushings are used, the temples and bridge have barbed metal pins that lock into the bushings, creating a pressure seal that holds the lenses in place. Although they are more cosmetically appealing, the bushing method is more fragile than the screw and nut method, and more difficult for laypersons to repair themselves in the event of loosening or breakage. <b>Bushing</b> <b>based</b> rimless mounts are, however, designed so that the pins can pull out of the lenses without causing damage, which reduces repair cost and duration.|$|R

3000|$|A {{plethora of}} {{methods have been}} {{proposed}} to solve the UE-TAP efficiently. As such, one easy way to solve a SO-TAP is to transform it to a UE-TAP. To do so, one simply needs to replace the delay function t̅_a (x̅_a + x_a [...]) with the marginal delay function: t̅_a (x̅_a + x_a [...]) = x̅_a [...]. [...] ∂t̅_a (x̅_a + x_a [...])/∂x̅_a. Therefore, both UE-TAP and SO-TAP can be combined as a single UE-TAP but with two different delay functions and travel demand matrices. This approach is very common in transportation modeling and {{is known as a}} multiclass traffic assignment problem (MC-TAP). Solving a MC-TAP is computationally more intensive than a single class TAP for which a variety of methods such as Variational Inequality, Complementarity Method, Fixed-Points and Entropy Maximization, as well as origin-based (or <b>bush</b> <b>based)</b> methods have been proposed [84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94].|$|R

50|$|The <b>Bush</b> {{administration}} <b>based</b> its {{rationale for}} war principally on {{the assertion that}} Iraq possessed {{weapons of mass destruction}} (WMDs) and that Saddam's government posed an immediate threat to the United States and its coalition allies. Some U.S. officials accused Saddam of harboring and supporting al-Qaeda, while others cited the desire to end a repressive dictatorship and bring democracy to the people of Iraq. After the invasion, however, no substantial evidence was found to verify the initial claims about WMDs. The rationale and misrepresentation of pre-war intelligence faced heavy criticism within the U.S. and internationally.|$|R
