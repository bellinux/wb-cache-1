5|$|Dopaminergic {{medications}} {{that are used}} to treat Parkinson's disease are sometimes associated with the development of a dopamine dysregulation syndrome, which involves the overuse of dopaminergic medication and medication-induced compulsive engagement in natural rewards like gambling and sexual activity. The latter <b>behaviors</b> <b>are</b> similar to those observed in individuals with a behavioral addiction.|$|E
5|$|In {{regards to}} {{pathogenic}} care, or {{the type of}} care in which these <b>behaviors</b> <b>are</b> present, a new criterion for Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder now includes chronically harsh punishment or other types of severely inept caregiving. Relating to pathogenic care for both proposed disorders, a new criterion is rearing in atypical environments such as institutions with high child/caregiver ratios that cut down on opportunities to form attachments with a caregiver.|$|E
5|$|Mainly on {{the basis}} of their reunion {{behaviour}} (although other <b>behaviors</b> <b>are</b> taken into account) in the Strange Situation Paradigm (Ainsworth et al., 1978; see below), infants can be categorized into three 'organized' attachment categories: Group B (later called 'secure'), Group A (later called 'anxious avoidant'), and Group C (later called 'anxious ambivalent'). There are subclassifications for each group (see below).|$|E
30|$|Retrospective {{rationality}} theories, unlike {{theories that}} assert that <b>behavior</b> <b>is</b> prospectively rational and consciously chosen to obtain some goal, suggest that <b>behavior</b> <b>is</b> largely under some external control and <b>behavior</b> <b>is</b> rationalized {{after the fact}} (e.g. Aronson 1972).|$|R
50|$|Abnormal <b>behavior</b> <b>is</b> {{broken up}} to two types: {{atypical}} and maladaptive. Atypical <b>behavior</b> <b>is</b> not necessarily harmful, but maladaptive <b>behavior</b> could potentially <b>be</b> harmful.|$|R
50|$|The first form of {{defensive}} <b>behavior</b> <b>is</b> evaluation. These {{are known as}} “you” statements and put all {{the focus on the}} other person. This kind of <b>behavior</b> <b>is</b> about judging the other communicator. In return the supportive <b>behavior</b> <b>is</b> description. This focuses on the communicator’s ideas rather than putting blame on someone else. Description <b>behavior</b> <b>is</b> about the feelings of the speaker and can be described as “I” statements.|$|R
5|$|Stereotyped and {{repetitive}} motor <b>behaviors</b> <b>are</b> a {{core part}} of the diagnosis of AS and other ASDs. They include hand movements such as flapping or twisting, and complex whole-body movements. These are typically repeated in longer bursts and look more voluntary or ritualistic than tics, which are usually faster, less rhythmical and less often symmetrical.|$|E
5|$|Some affiliative <b>behaviors</b> <b>are</b> {{seasonal}} or gender-specific, such as {{the male}} squeal approach and anogenital inspections performed during the mating season. Another example is the female greeting behavior, where two females will use their anogenital scent glands to mark each other's backs, jump over one another, writhe together, and emit squealing vocalizations. This behavior is not seen during {{the end of the}} cool, dry season or around gestation. The frequency of other affiliative behaviors can be affected by age. All ruffed lemurs over five months of age allogroom, and, in captivity, subadults participate in play more frequently than adults.|$|E
5|$|Suicidal {{thoughts}} and <b>behaviors</b> <b>are</b> rare in clinical trials, and the FDA requires all antidepressants, including bupropion, {{to carry a}} boxed warning stating that antidepressants may {{increase the risk of}} suicide in persons younger than 25. This warning is based on a statistical analysis conducted by the FDA which found a 2-fold increase in suicidal thought and behavior in children and adolescents, and 1.5-fold increase in the 18–24 age group. For this analysis the FDA combined the results of 295 trials of 11 antidepressants in order to obtain statistically significant results. Considered in isolation, bupropion was not statistically different from placebo.|$|E
50|$|Operant {{conditioning}} (or instrumental conditioning) {{is a form}} {{of learning}} in which an individual's <b>behavior</b> <b>is</b> modified by its consequences. Two complementary motivations drive instrumental learning: the maximization of positive outcomes and minimization of aversive ones. There are two ways in which <b>behavior</b> <b>is</b> reinforced or strengthened: positive reinforcement occurs when a <b>behavior</b> <b>is</b> strengthened by producing some desirable consequence; negative reinforcement occurs when a <b>behavior</b> <b>is</b> strengthened by avoiding some undesirable consequence. There are two ways in which <b>behavior</b> <b>is</b> decreased or weakened: negative punishment occurs when a <b>behavior</b> <b>is</b> weakened by not producing a reinforcing consequence; and positive punishment occurs when a <b>behavior</b> <b>is</b> weakened by producing a consequence that is a disincentive. In combination, these basic reinforcing and punishing contingencies provide four ways for modifying behavior. Reinforcement increases the relative probability or frequency of the behavior it follows, while punishment decreases the relative probability or frequency of the behaviour it follows.|$|R
5000|$|In his 1943 cybernetic {{classification}} [...] "Behavior, Purpose and Teleology", purpose <b>is</b> a <b>behavior</b> subclass. <b>Behavior</b> <b>is</b> active or {{passive and}} active <b>behavior</b> <b>is</b> purposeful or random. Active purposeful <b>behavior</b> <b>is</b> then either feedback teleological on non-teleological. Negative feedback {{is important to}} guide the positive goal route. Purposeful teleological feedback helps guide the predictive <b>behavior</b> orders. Teleology <b>is</b> feedback controlled purpose.|$|R

5|$|Because of {{its size}} and {{electrical}} defenses, the marbled electric ray does not often fall prey to other animals such as sharks. This species exhibits different defensive behaviors depending on whether a prospective predator grasps it by the disc or the tail. A ray touched on the disc will quickly turn toward the threat while producing electric shocks; {{this is followed by}} it fleeing in a straight line, after which it may re-bury itself. A ray touched on the tail will propel itself upward into a loop; if it has not escaped after the maneuver, the ray will curl into a ring with the belly facing outward, so as to present the area of its body with the highest electric field gradient (the underside of the electric organs) towards the threat; these <b>behaviors</b> <b>are</b> accompanied by short, strong electric shocks. The ray tends to produce more electric bursts when protecting its tail than when protecting its disc.|$|E
5|$|Combat is turn-based, {{with each}} {{character}} in the player's party receiving action points {{at the beginning of}} the player's turn. The number received is dependent on the items the player character has equipped and the skills the character or creations possess. Each action uses a specific number of points, for example, moving one square takes a single point and attacks or spells take five. Attacking or spellcasting with fewer than ten action points immediately ends the character's turn, otherwise a character can continue to act until they run out of points. Most enemies will attack the player on sight, retreating in terror if they reach a certain threshold of damage without being killed. Other specialized <b>behaviors</b> <b>are</b> also present, including creatures which call for help, or creatures which act as sentries and retreat to an ambush location when threatened. Creations made by the player character can also be controlled by a similar artificial intelligence, or the player can invest more essence in the creation's intelligence and control them manually.|$|E
5|$|However, {{despite their}} vulnerability, some women in rural Malawi {{believe that they}} do, to a certain extent, have {{control over their own}} health and well-being. They tell their husbands that the HIV/AIDS {{epidemic}} has made sexual infidelity extremely dangerous and encourage them to refrain from engaging in extramarital sexual contact. In addition, many women are convinced that, by appealing to the vulnerability of their children (who will probably be orphaned if their parents contract HIV), they can convince their husbands to use condoms consistently during extramarital sexual encounters. Other women seek support from their friends and family members when they believe that their husbands' unsafe <b>behaviors</b> <b>are</b> putting their lives at risk. Finally, as a last resort, women might warn their husbands that they will visit the ankhoswe, or traditional marriage counselor, and demand divorce if their husbands refuse to remain faithful and actively prevent the transmission of the disease.|$|E
5000|$|Violation valences are {{determined}} by three factors: (1) The evaluation of the behavior; (2) {{whether or not the}} <b>behavior</b> <b>is</b> more or less favorable than the expectation; and (3) the magnitude of the violation. A positive violation occurs when the <b>behavior</b> <b>is</b> more favorable than the expectation. A negative violation occurs when the <b>behavior</b> <b>is</b> less favorable.|$|R

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} by some {{within the field of}} attachment therapy that RAD may be quite prevalent because severe child maltreatment, which is known to increase risk for RAD, is prevalent and because children who are severely abused may exhibit behaviors similar to RAD behaviors. The APSAC Taskforce consider this inference to be flawed and questionable. Severely abused children may exhibit similar behaviors to RAD behaviors but there are several far more common and demonstrably treatable diagnoses which may better account for these difficulties. Further, many children experience severe maltreatment and do not develop clinical disorders. Resilience is a common and normal human characteristic. RAD does not underlie all or even most of the behavioral and emotional problems seen in foster children, adoptive children, or children who are maltreated and rates of child abuse and/or neglect or problem <b>behaviors</b> <b>are</b> not a benchmark for estimates of RAD.|$|E
5|$|Many {{performances}} {{deal with}} behaviors {{that occur in}} daily life. However, {{in accordance with the}} overriding principle of beauty, such <b>behaviors</b> <b>are</b> stylized to be presented on stage. Peking opera does not aim to accurately represent reality. Experts of the art form contrast the principles of Peking opera with the principle of Mo, mimes or imitation, that is found in western dramas. Peking opera should be suggestive, not imitative. The literal aspects of scenes are removed or stylized to better represent intangible emotions and characters. The most common stylization method in Peking opera is roundness. Every motion and pose is carefully manipulated to avoid sharp angles and straight lines. A character looking upon an object above them will sweep their eyes in a circular motion from low to high before landing on the object. Similarly, a character will sweep their hand in an arc from left to right in order to indicate an object on the right. This avoidance of sharp angles extends to three-dimensional movement as well; reversals of orientation often {{take the form of a}} smooth, S-shaped curve. All of these general principles of aesthetics are present within other performance elements as well.|$|E

5000|$|Gender, as {{identified}} through gender normative play, self-identification with a gender, and tendency {{to engage in}} aggressive <b>behavior</b> <b>is</b> influenced by prenatal hormone exposure. Studies on other gendered <b>behavior</b> <b>are</b> inconsistent, however some evidence indicates other gendered <b>behavior</b> <b>is</b> influenced by prenatal and early life androgen exposure.

40|$|When a civil-engineering {{material}} like concrete, rockis {{subjected to}} amechanical loading, a nonlinear hysteretic <b>behavior</b> <b>is</b> observed. Experiments {{have shown that}} this <b>behavior</b> <b>is</b> caused by the bond system (e. g. ITZ in concrete). Cracking occurs in the bond system and the matrix, therefore it changes the bond system and its nonlinear hysteretic behavior. In addition, {{it is observed that}} the degree of saturation changes the nonlinear hysteretic behavior. In the doctoral thesis, a model is proposedto capture the nonlinear hysteretic behavior. Upon implementation, a mesh-dependent <b>behavior</b> <b>was</b> observed as well as the non-closing of hysteretic loops.
