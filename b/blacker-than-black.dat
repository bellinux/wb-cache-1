5000|$|Of her cartoons, Cooke {{said in a}} geekgirl {{interview}} in 1996: “I’m learning to get {{a whole lot better}} at making stuff happen on computer, but I still really love drawing in old-fashioned pen and a bottle of the <b>blacker-than-black</b> waterproof ink - delicious.” In c.1996-97 she wrote a weekly column in the Sydney Morning Herald’s 'Good Weekend’ magazine, whose illustrations she described as [...] "bizarrely incongruous photographic vignettes of famous people such as Queen Elizabeth II and Princess Diana as joke self-portraits", while in 1999 she returned to using her own cartoons to illustrate her weekly column in The Australian. In 1997 she released a calendar printed on “paper” made from sugarcane pulp.|$|E
5000|$|The album {{received}} positive reviews. In the NME, Terry Staunton {{gave the}} record an 8 out of 10, writing, [...] "It {{can be a}} struggle at first, as Johnson never lets up from his <b>blacker-than-black</b> world-view, but 'Dusk' is a rich and hugely rewarding experience which draws you to its cold bosom again and again." [...] In Melody Maker David Bennun observed that it was [...] "a remarkably straightforward album" [...] for Johnson and wrote, [...] "Like Nick Cave, Johnson protects himself from the ridicule he invites with bombastic self-caricature. When he lets this slip, he's left with an album that, although frequently absorbing, is still as inherently laughable as any The The album. [...] "Dusk" [...] needs time to grow; it deserves it. But while it takes it, the Dogs of Lust are closing in, howling with mirth." [...] Sam Samuelson of AllMusic gave the record four stars out of five, declaring it one of Johnson's [...] "most accomplished products to date." ...|$|E
5000|$|For Leeds Music Scene, Rob Paul Chapman wrote “Rarely has {{an album}} that'd still fit {{on one side}} of a C90 broken so much new ground and yet still {{remained}} perfectly accessible. It can be hard work at times and if you make it through in one sitting you may end up with brain-ache the first time around, but it'll be one you come back to again and again. Quite simply, indispensable.” Chapman also took note of the album’s underlying themes and execution, writing “Soul Destroyer may well be one of the finest opening tracks committed to disc anywhere, let alone in Leeds. It is an evocative and biting hymn to the desolation, frustration and all round miserable experience that can be life in an up-and-coming band sometimes… If this all sounds like some kind of contrived muso-winge, the truth couldn't be any more different. Underneath the self-depreciating <b>blacker-than-black</b> humour lays the distinct strain of optimism found uniquely in people who, through a mixture of belief and sheer bloody-mindedness, continue to carry the torch for what they set out to achieve. The theme for both track and the album seems to be triumph over adversity. It's the notion that if you want something enough, are prepared to work for it and have the raw determination to plough stubbornly on towards your goal despite all of the logic, misfortune and outside advisors telling you otherwise, then you will eventually get there.” ...|$|E
