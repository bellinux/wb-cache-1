5|$|The {{treatment}} of HIT requires stopping heparin treatment, and both protection from thrombosis and choice of an agent {{that will not}} reduce the platelet count any further. Several alternatives are available for this purpose and mainly used are danaparoid, fondaparinux, argatroban and <b>bivalirudin.</b>|$|E
500|$|Various non-heparin {{agents are}} used to provide anticoagulation in those with {{strongly}} suspected or proven HIT: danaparoid, fondaparinux, <b>bivalirudin</b> and argatroban. These are alternatives to heparin therapy. Not all agents are available in all countries, and not all are approved for this specific use. For instance, argatroban is only recently licensed in the United Kingdom, and danaparoid is not available in the United States. Fondaparinux, [...] a Factor Xa inhibitor, is commonly used off label for HIT treatment in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|Discontinuation of heparin is {{critical}} {{in a case of}} HIT. [...] Beyond that, however, clinicians generally treat to avoid a thrombosis, often by starting patients directly on warfarin. [...] For this reason, patients are usually treated with a direct thrombin inhibitor, such as lepirudin or argatroban, which are approved by the FDA for this use. [...] Other blood thinners sometimes used in this setting that are not FDA-approved for treatment of HIT include <b>bivalirudin</b> and fondaparinux. [...] Platelet transfusions are not routinely used to treat HIT because thrombosis, not bleeding, is the primary problem.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bivalirudin</b> is an anticoagulant. Therefore, {{bleeding}} is {{an expected}} adverse event. In clinical trials, <b>bivalirudin</b> treated patients exhibited statistically significantly {{lower rates of}} bleeding than patients treated with heparin plus a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor. The most common (≥10%) adverse events of <b>bivalirudin</b> are back pain, pain, nausea, headache, and hypotension.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bivalirudin</b> is {{contraindicated}} {{in patients}} with active major bleeding and hypersensitivity to <b>bivalirudin</b> or its components. (In the EU <b>bivalirudin</b> is also contraindicated {{in patients with}} {{an increased risk of}} bleeding due to hemostasis disorders and/or irreversible coagulation disorders, severe uncontrolled hypertension, subacute bacterial endocarditis, and severe renal impairment ml/min and in dialysis-dependent patients).|$|E
50|$|<b>Bivalirudin</b> is {{intended}} for IV use only and is supplied as a sterile, lyophilized product in single-use, glass vials. After reconstitution, each vial delivers 250 mg of <b>bivalirudin.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Bivalirudin,</b> a 20 {{amino acid}} polypeptide, is a {{synthetic}} analog of hirudin. Like the hirudins {{it is also}} a bivalent DTI. It has an amino-terminal D-Phe-Pro-Arg-Pro domain that is linked via four Gly residues to a dodecapeptide analog of the carboxy-terminal of hirudin. The amino-terminal domain binds to the active site and the carboxy-terminal domain binds to exosite 1 on thrombin. Different from the hirudins, once bound thrombin cleaves the Arg-Pro bond at the amino-terminal of <b>bivalirudin</b> and as a result restores the functions to the active site of the enzyme. Even though the carboxy-terminal domain of <b>bivalirudin</b> is still bound to exosite 1 on thrombin, the affinity of the bond is decreased after the amino-terminal is released. This allows substrates to substartes to compete with cleaved <b>bivalirudin</b> for access to exosite 1 on thrombin. The use of <b>bivalirudin</b> has mostly been studied in the setting of acute coronary syndrome. A few studies indicate that <b>bivalirudin</b> is non-inferior compared to heparin and that <b>bivalirudin</b> is associated with a lower rate of bleeding. Unlike the hirudins, <b>bivalirudin</b> is only partially (about 20%) excreted by the kidneys, other sites such as hepatic metabolism and proteolysis also contribute to its metabolism, making it safer to use in patients with renal impairment; however, dose adjustments are needed in severe renal impairment.|$|E
50|$|The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted {{pediatric}} exclusivity for <b>bivalirudin,</b> {{based on}} studies submitted {{in response to}} a written request by the FDA to investigate the use of <b>bivalirudin</b> in pediatric patients aged birth to 16-years old.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bivalirudin</b> is a DTI that overcomes many {{limitations}} {{seen with}} indirect thrombin inhibitors, such as heparin. <b>Bivalirudin</b> is a short, synthetic peptide that is potent, highly specific, and a reversible inhibitor of thrombin. It inhibits both circulating and clot-bound thrombin, while also inhibiting thrombin-mediated platelet activation and aggregation. <b>Bivalirudin</b> has a quick {{onset of action}} and a short half-life. It does not bind to plasma proteins (other than thrombin) or to red blood cells. Therefore, it has a predictable antithrombotic response. There is no risk for Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia/Heparin Induced Thrombosis-Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (HIT/HITTS). It {{does not require a}} binding cofactor such as antithrombin and does not activate platelets. These characteristics make <b>bivalirudin</b> an ideal alternative to heparin.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bivalirudin</b> is {{supported}} by 7 major randomized trials. These trials include REPLACE-2 (Randomized Evaluation of PCI Linking Angiomax to Reduced Clinical Events-2), BAT (<b>Bivalirudin</b> Angioplasty Trial), ACUITY (Acute Catheterization and Urgent Intervention Triage Strategy Trial), and HORIZONS AMI (Harmonizing Outcomes With Revascularization and Stents in AMI). A total of 25,000 patients with a low to high risk for ischemic complications undergoing PCI were evaluated. <b>Bivalirudin</b> with or without provisional GPIIb/IIIa demonstrated similar angiographic and procedural outcomes and improved clinical outcomes when compared with heparin plus GPIIb/IIIa.|$|E

50|$|<b>Bivalirudin</b> {{clinical}} studies demonstrated consistent positive outcomes {{in patients with}} stable angina, unstable angina (UA), non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) undergoing PCI in 7 major randomized trials. Patients receiving <b>bivalirudin</b> had fewer adverse events compared to patients that received heparin.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bivalirudin</b> {{should be}} {{administered}} with aspirin and clopidogrel.|$|E
50|$|Continuation of the <b>bivalirudin</b> {{infusion}} following PCI {{for up to}} 4 hours post-procedure is optional, at {{the discretion}} of the treating physician.

50|$|Anticoagulants {{in acute}} {{coronary}} syndrome are targeted against the coronary blood clot, as well as towards prevention of thrombotic complications, like formation of blood clots in the ventricles, stroke, pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis. Patients undergoing PCI also need an anticoagulant to prevent catheter thrombosis. Options include unfractionated heparin, enoxaparin (a low molecular weight heparin), fondaparinux (a pentasaccharide antagonist of factor Xa) and <b>bivalirudin</b> (a direct thrombin inhibitor); all the above agents are given parenterally (subcutaneously or intravenously). Unfractionated heparin has the disadvantage of requiring dose adjustment based on a laboratory exam, {{activated partial thromboplastin time}} (APTT). In STEMI patients choice depends on the reperfusion strategy used (see below); <b>bivalirudin</b> is used when PCI is employed only, while in the same case fondaparinux is not preferred. Similarly, in Non-STE ACS <b>bivalirudin</b> too is only used when an early invasive strategy is chosen.|$|E
