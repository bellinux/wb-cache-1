25|$|Even {{when not}} under indictment, he {{prepared}} for inevitable charges (knowing the FBI was watching him). Almost {{every day he}} would return from his residence to his mother's apartment at 225 Sullivan Street in Greenwich Village and emerge dressed in a <b>bathrobe</b> <b>and</b> pajamas or a windbreaker and shabby trousers. Accompanied by one or two bodyguards, he crossed {{the street to the}} Triangle Civic Improvement Association — a dingy storefront club that served as his headquarters — where he played pinochle and held whispered conversations with his associates. Regular visitors to the Triangle included senior Genovese caporegimes Liborio Bellomo, John Ardito, Tino Fiumara, Ernest Muscarella and Daniel Leo. From Gigante's 1990 indictment and after his incarceration (in La Tuna, Texas) these men ran the crime family, with all major choices authorized by Gigante from his prison cell.|$|E
500|$|... "Wintour's {{approach}} hit a nerve—this {{was the way}} {{real women}} put clothes together (with the likely exception of wearing multi-thousand-dollar T-shirts)," [...] one reviewer says. On the June 1989 cover, another model was shown in wet hair, with just a <b>bathrobe</b> <b>and</b> no apparent makeup.

According to Hecht's story, he found articles of women's clothing in a <b>bathrobe</b> <b>and</b> stumbled across several love letters Wanderer had written to a man called [...] "James". Many writers dispute Hecht's account; records of Wanderer's interrogation and trial make no mention of [...] "James." [...] However, a police psychologist would accuse Wanderer of [...] "latent homosexuality" [...] during his trial.|$|E

2500|$|In August 2009, Arudou—acting as {{the chair}} of FRANCA (the Foreign Residents and Naturalized Citizens Association)—began a letter-writing {{campaign}} to protest an advertisement by McDonald’s Japan featuring a bespectacled, mildly geeky, 43-year-old American Japanophile known as Mr. James—a burger mascot who proclaims his love for the fast-food outlet in broken katakana Japanese. Writing in The Japan Times, Arudou argued that the [...] "Mr. James" [...] campaign perpetuates negative stereotypes about non-Japanese Caucasian minorities living in Japan, and demanded that McDonald’s Japan withdraw the advertisement: [...] "Imagine McDonald's, a multinational that has long promoted cultural diversity, launching a McAsia Menu in America featuring a deep-bowing, grimacing Asian in a <b>bathrobe</b> <b>and</b> platform sandals saying 'Me likee McFlied Lice!' or 'So solly, prease skosh honorable teriyaki sandrich?'" [...] Time magazine's Coco Masters concluded: [...] "To protest Mr. James as a stereotype of a minority population in Japan because the Ohio native fails to speak or write Japanese fluently, dresses like a nerd and blogs about burgers only ends up underscoring {{the fact that there}} really aren't a lot of foreigners who fit the bill running around Japan." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gigante quickly rose {{to power}} during the 1960s and 1970s. By 1981 {{he became the}} family's boss, while Anthony [...] "Fat Tony" [...] Salerno served as front boss {{during the first half}} of the 1980s. He also ordered the failed murder attempt of Gambino crime family boss John Gotti in 1986. With the arrest and {{conviction}} of Gotti and various Gambino family members in 1992, Gigante was officially recognized as the most powerful crime boss in the United States. [...] For the better part of 30 years, Gigante feigned insanity in an effort to throw law enforcement off his trail. [...] Dubbed [...] "The Oddfather" [...] and [...] "The Enigma in the Bathrobe" [...] by the press, Gigante often wandered the streets of Greenwich Village in his <b>bathrobe</b> <b>and</b> slippers, mumbling incoherently to himself, in what Gigante later admitted was an elaborate act to avoid prosecution. He was indicted on federal racketeering charges in 1990, but was determined to be mentally unfit to stand trial. In 1997 he was tried and convicted of racketeering and was given a 12-year sentence. [...] Facing new charges in 2003, he pleaded guilty and admitted that his supposed insanity was an elaborate effort to avoid prosecution. [...] He died while in prison custody in 2005 at the United States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners.|$|E

60|$|If {{ever there}} was an angry man, it was Asa Lemm at that {{particular}} moment. He had to change all his night clothing, and then don a <b>bathrobe</b> <b>and</b> slippers and go down below once more and {{get some of the}} hired help to clean up his room and take away the wet mattress of his bed. A dry mattress was substituted from a vacant bedroom, but it was all of half an hour before this work was accomplished; and in the meantime the professor stormed around, threatening about everything he could imagine.|$|E
6000|$|He draped himself grotesquely in his toweling <b>bathrobe</b> <b>and</b> a {{pink and}} white couch-cover, and sat lumpishly in a wing-chair.

He napped and woke, napped and woke, a hundred times. He heard her move and sigh in slumber; he wondered if there wasn't some officious brisk thing he could do for her, and before he could quite form the thought he was asleep, racked and aching. The night was infinite. When dawn came and the waiting seemed at an end, he fell asleep, and was vexed to have been caught off his guard, to have been aroused by Verona's entrance and her agitated [...] "Oh, what is it, Dad?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Sibella, Count Dracula's pre-teen daughter. She has green eyes, light purple skin, purple hair, red shoes, {{and a dark}} purple {{dress with}} a red belt.

Unlike traditional vampires like her father, she is immune to sunlight and can go out during the day. She is also shown to be the most strongly willed of the five Grimwood girls—she is the last to undergo Revolta's hypnosis spell and tries to fight back. She often uses phrases with vampire-related puns such as [...] "fangtastic" [...] and [...] "You bat" [...] (you bet). She is talented at making bat-robes (<b>bathrobes)</b> <b>and</b> dragon fire-proof robes as seen when she gives her father and Matches each one.|$|R
5000|$|Though {{acknowledging}} a lack {{of direct}} proof, some historians speculate that Louie and May could have been what in modern times would be called lesbian partners. This is based largely on the seemingly erotic connotations of their biographies that appeared in Children's Friend; for example, the statement that while the couple was working on Primary matters, [...] "when they were too tired to sit up any longer they put on their <b>bathrobes</b> <b>and</b> crawled into bed to work until the wee small hours of the night". Other Mormon historians argue that female-female sexual intimacy would have been regarded as sinful at the time, and argue for a presumption that their relationship was purely platonic. Other researchers have been non-committal on the issue; one has stated only that Anderson [...] "was as close to President Felt as any woman could be". Both sides acknowledge, however, {{that the relationship between}} Louie and May was an intense one, and that they shared a deep love for one another.|$|R

60|$|As he {{was coming}} in that evening he passed her in the hall. She was clad in {{what he called a}} <b>bathrobe,</b> <b>and</b> what she called an Arabian burnoose, of black {{embroidered}} with dull-gold crescents and stars, showing a V of exquisite flesh at her throat. A shred of tenuous lace straggled loose {{at the opening of the}} burnoose. Her radiant hair, tangled over her forehead, shone with a thousand various gleams from the gas-light over her head as she moved back against the wall and stood waiting for him to pass. She smiled very doubtfully, distantly--the smile, he felt, of a great lady from Mayfair. He bobbed his head, lowered his eyes abashedly, and noticed that along the shelf of her forearm, held against her waist, she bore many silver toilet articles, and such a huge heavy fringed Turkish bath-towel as he had never seen before.|$|E

Happy with his invention, the man then walks outside in his <b>bathrobe,</b> headphones <b>and</b> sunglasses past three frolicking teenagers, and hugs one of them. He continues {{to walk down the}} street where he finally meets the members of Miike Snow at a crosswalk. He removes his <b>bathrobe,</b> headphones <b>and</b> sunglasses, and walks away happily. The video premiered online in September 2009, before being released to the iTunes Store on 9 October 2009. Regarding the video, Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music remarked: [...] "It's basically what Santa does on his days off." ...|$|R
50|$|Velour: Velour is {{a fabric}} with cut loops. Velour bathrobes are {{typically}} made with terry inside, as terrycloth absorbs water better than velour. Velour gives the <b>bathrobe</b> luxury, coziness, <b>and</b> makes the garment softer to the touch.|$|R
