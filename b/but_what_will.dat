2500|$|At 17:00, Mussolini, {{dressed in}} a blue suit and a soft grey hat, and escorted by several cars bearing agents of the [...] "presidenziale" [...] (which halted outside the villa), arrived at the Villa Savoia. He brought with him {{the law of the}} Grand Council, the OdG Grandi and the letter of Cianetti. The King awaited him {{at the foot of the}} patio stair of the villa. The Duce started to speak, trying to {{convince}} Victor Emmanuel that the OdG had no legal value, and that many of its supporters had changed their minds in the night. The King interrupted him, and told him softly that the country was broken and that the situation required him to quit his post: the new President of the Council of Ministers would be Marshal Badoglio. Mussolini, visibly shaken, answered: [...] "Then is it over? It is over, it is over. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>will</b> happen to me, to my family?". The King assured him that he would personally take care of his security and that of his family. Victor Emmanuel accompanied him to the door, where he met Captain Vigneri. The Duce went to his car, but the captain told him to go to a nearby ambulance, for his security. Mussolini answered that there was no need for that, but followed the captain. When the rear door opened, he saw three Carabinieri and three policemen sitting on the side banks, and said: [...] "The policemen too? No!" [...] but the captain took his left elbow and led him into the ambulance, which then left the villa's park and rushed through the streets of Rome until reaching the [...] "Podgora" [...] army barracks in Trastevere. After one hour, he was moved to the [...] "Legnano" [...] Carabinieri barracks, in Prati.|$|E

Of course the police would arrest him at sight, and he was led toward the guardhouse. He struggled with them, but was overpowered. A crowd of warriors rushed to his rescue, and there was confusion and a general shout of [...] "Hurry up with them! Kill them all!" [...] I saw American Horse walk out of the agent's office and calmly face the excited mob. [...] "What are you going to do?" [...] he asked. [...] "Stop, men, stop and think before you act! Will you murder your children, your women, yes, destroy your nation to-day?" [...] He stood before them like a statue and the men who held the two policemen helpless paused for an instant. He went on: [...] "You are brave today because you outnumber the white men, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>will</b> you do tomorrow? There are railroads on all sides of you. The soldiers will pour in from every direction by thousands and surround you. You have little food or ammunition. It will be the end of your people. Stop, I say, stop now!" [...] Jack Red Cloud, son of the old chief rushed up to him and thrust a revolver almost in his face. [...] "It is you and men like you," [...] he shouted, [...] "who have reduced our race to slavery and starvation!" [...] American Horse did not flinch but deliberately reentered the office, followed by Jack still flourishing the pistol. But his timely appearance and eloquence had saved the day. Others of the police force had time to reach the spot, and with a large crowd of friendly Indians had taken command of the situation. When I went into the office I found him alone but apparently quite calm. [...] "Where are the agent and the clerks?" [...] I asked. [...] "They fled by the back door," [...] he replied, smiling. [...] "I think they are in the cellar. These fools outside had almost caught us asleep, but I think it is over now." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lee {{claimed that}} he found slavery bothersome and {{time-consuming}} as an everyday institution to run. In an 1856 letter to his wife he maintained that slavery was a great evil, but primarily due to adverse impact that it had on white people:In this enlightened age, there are few I believe, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>will</b> acknowledge, that slavery as an institution, is a moral & political evil in any Country. It is useless to expatiate on its disadvantages. I think it however a greater evil to the white man than to the black race, & while my feelings are strongly enlisted in behalf of the latter, my sympathies are more strong for the former. The blacks are immeasurably better off here than in Africa, morally, socially & physically. The painful discipline they are undergoing, is necessary for their instruction as a race, & I hope will prepare & lead them to better things. How long their subjugation may be necessary is known & ordered by a wise Merciful Providence.After {{the end of the}} Civil War, it was often claimed that Lee was in some sense opposed to slavery. In the generation following the war, Lee, though he died just a few years later, became a central figure in the Lost Cause interpretation of the war. The argument that Lee had always somehow opposed slavery helped maintain his stature as a symbol of Southern honor and national reconciliation. Douglas Southall Freeman's Pulitzer prize-winning four-volume R. E. [...] Lee: A Biography (1936), which was for a long period considered the definite work on Lee, downplayed his involvement in slavery and emphasized Lee as a virtuous person. Eric Foner, who describes Freeman's volume as a [...] "", notes that on the whole, Freeman [...] "displayed little interest in Lee’s relationship to slavery. The index to his four volumes contained 22 entries for 'devotion to duty', 19 for 'kindness', 53 for Lee's celebrated horse, Traveller. But 'slavery', 'slave emancipation' and 'slave insurrection' together received five. Freeman observed, without offering details, that slavery in Virginia represented the system 'at its best'. He ignored the postwar testimony of Lee’s former slave Wesley Norris about the brutal treatment to which he had been subjected." ...|$|E
