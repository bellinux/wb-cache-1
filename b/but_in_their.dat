5|$|Intrigued by {{an ominous}} figure {{in one of}} Vincent van Gogh's paintings, alien time {{traveller}} the Doctor (Matt Smith) and his companion Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) {{go back in time}} to meet Van Gogh (Tony Curran) and discover that Provence has been plagued by an invisible monster, known as the Krafayis, which only Van Gogh can see. The Doctor and Amy work with Van Gogh to defeat the Krafayis, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> attempt to have Van Gogh realise his legacy through bringing him to the future they ultimately realise that not all of time can be rewritten and there are some evils which are out of the Doctor's reach.|$|E
5|$|Many {{families}} of moths have special organs to help detect bat echolocation. These organs {{are known as}} tympana (singular – typanum). The Pyraloidea and almost all Geometroidea have tympana located on the anterior sternite of the abdomen. The Noctuoidea also have tympana, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> case, the tympana are located {{on the underside of}} the metathorax, the structure and position of which are unique and a taxonomic distinguishing feature of the superfamily.|$|E
5|$|String {{and wind}} {{instruments}} {{play an important}} role in Barbadian folk culture, especially the bow-fiddle, banjo and acoustic guitar; more modern groups also use an electric and bass guitar. The shukster is a distinctive instrument, made by stretching a guitar string between two sides of a house. Traditional Barbadian wind instruments are largely metal, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> folk origins, were made out of locally found materials. Barbadian villagers burned fingerholes, for example, on bamboo tubes, made trumpets out of conch shells and pipes from pumpkin vines. Many modern groups use harmonica, accordion, alto and tenor saxophone, trumpet and trombone.|$|E

5|$|The group {{released}} several successful albums, including December's Children (And Everybody's), Aftermath and Between the Buttons, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> {{personal lives}} their behaviour {{was brought into}} question. In 1967, Jagger and Richards were arrested on drug charges and were given unusually harsh sentences: Jagger was sentenced to three months' imprisonment for possession of four over-the-counter pep pills he had purchased in Italy. The traditionally conservative editor of The Times, William Rees-Mogg, wrote an article critical of the sentences; and on appeal Richards' sentence was overturned and Jagger's was amended to a conditional discharge (although he ended up spending one night inside London's Brixton Prison). The Rolling Stones continued to face legal battles for the next decade.|$|E
5|$|The {{reproductive}} {{habits of}} the Sumatran rhinoceros have been studied in captivity. Sexual relationships begin with a courtship period characterized by increased vocalization, tail raising, urination, and increased physical contact, with {{both male and female}} using their snouts to bump the other in the head and genitals. The pattern of courtship is most {{similar to that of the}} black rhinoceros. Young Sumatran rhino males are often too aggressive with females, sometimes injuring and even killing them during the courtship. In the wild, the female could run away from an overly aggressive male, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> smaller captive enclosures, they cannot; this inability to escape aggressive males may partly contribute to the low success rate of captive-breeding programs.|$|E
5|$|The sparsely haired tail {{is about}} as long as the head and body. It is dark brown above and lighter below. In contrast, the tail of H.megacephalus has little to no {{difference}} in color between the upper and lower surface. In 2006, Weksler and colleagues noted tail coloration as a difference between the two species of Transandinomys (bicolored in T.talamancae and unicolored in T.bolivaris), <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> 1998 study, Musser and colleagues could not find differences in tail coloration between their Panamanian samples of the two species.|$|E

5|$|Virginia Tech rebounded {{from the}} upset loss to Temple by {{shutting}} out the University of Alabama Birmingham, 410, then beating No. 21 West Virginia, 2713. After the two wins, the Hokies had a 71 record, were ranked No. 16 in the AP Poll, and {{traveled to the}} Carrier Dome to play Syracuse University. In New York, Syracuse gave the Hokies their second loss of the season, 2826. The loss came {{despite the presence of}} Al Clark, who had returned from injury prior to the West Virginia game. Tech again rebounded from a losing effort, this time by defeating Rutgers, 477. <b>But</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> final regular-season game, the Hokies lost to Virginia in the annual competition for the Commonwealth Cup, 3632. Tech led by 22 points at halftime, but Virginia quarterback Aaron Brooks led a comeback that won the game for Virginia with two minutes remaining in the game.|$|E
