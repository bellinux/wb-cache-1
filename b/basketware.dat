More popular was the heavily modelled Harvest ware, jugs and bowls modelled with corn and fruit. After the war this range was heavily marketed in North America (very patriotically) as England. This later modelled ware attracts relatively low prices at auction.|$|E

50|$|The helmets are {{constructed}} on a basket type construction which gives {{a light and}} strong frame. The frame is decorated usually with feathers obtained from local birds {{although there have been}} variations which have used human hair instead. The plant used to make the baskets is Freycinetia arborea, a plant often used to make <b>basketware.</b> In addition to Freycinetia arborea the makers also used fibre from the Touchardia latifolia plant which is a type of nettle. Touchardia latifolia was used to create string or thread to tie the feathers to the basketry.|$|E
50|$|The outer islands produce {{traditional}} weaving of fans, mats, <b>basketware</b> and hats. Particularly fine {{examples of}} rito hats are worn by women {{to church on}} Sundays. They are made from the uncurled fibre of the coconut palm and are of very high quality. The Polynesian equivalent of Panama hats, they are highly valued and are keenly sought by Polynesian visitors from Tahiti. Often, they are decorated with hatbands made of minuscule pupu shells which are painted and stitched on by hand. Although pupu are found on other islands, the collection and use of them in decorative work has become a speciality of Mangaia.|$|E

50|$|In the 19th century, Neroth was no {{exception}} among the Eifelâ€™s many villages insofar as it was poverty-stricken. Agriculture was extremely scant. Commercial and artisanal opportunities were hard to come by. Some of the villagers therefore plied sidelines to their usual work, peddling carved spoons or <b>basketware.</b> There was a further, smaller sector of the population made up of non-nomadic Jenische pedlars and tinkers. The stage was thus set for a new handicraft industry to arise, one that produced much sought-after articles: mousetraps and rat traps. The needed skills {{were brought to the}} community by a former teacher from Neroth, who saw such an industry as {{a way out of the}} otherwise intractible chronic wretchedness that had hitherto beset the village - and indeed most of the Eifel.|$|E

Several hardware stores also operate catering {{to the needs of the}} city's construction industry.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to study the making of {{traditional}} <b>basketware</b> in Penafiel district. We attempted to trace the profession of basket making and its artisans within {{the background of the}} local crafts, since the Modern Age. We identified also the forms and know-how which are characteristic, with emphasis on the basketry products made of woven, plaited and checkered ribbon-like strips of peeled off wood, as well as the ancient manufacture of fine painted baskets of woody plant twigs. Both these handicrafts are nearing extinction...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} reconstructs, wherever possible, {{the interior}} of the Cape house between 1670 and 1714 from the evidence preserved in surviving inventories and vendu rolls located in the Cape Archives. Chapter I examines those inventories which contribute something to our knowledge of the architecture of the period. Chapter II reconstructs certain features of doors, windows, fireplaces etc., from clues in the inventories and vendu rolls. Chapter III considers the way the different rooms in a cape house were furnished, and relates this to the developments in interior organisation and design that were taking place in seventeenth-century Europe in general and the Hague in particular. Chapter IV examines beds, window curtains, seat furniture, footstools, footwarmers and screens. Chapter V examines tables, carpets, chests, coffers, cupboards, cabinets, writing boxes, cellarets, mirrors, pictures, and wall racks. Chapter VI deals with lighting equipment, aids to cleanliness, <b>basketware,</b> skins, leatherware and cooperage. Chapter VII examines the various items devoted to eating and drinking. Chapter VIII covers the domestic pursuits: smoking, reading, writing, sewing, knitting, spinning, music, indoor games, clocks, watches, scientific instruments, weapons and domestic pets. The Conclusion attempts to place the domestic world at the Cape in the context of contemporary Dutch culture. Comparisons are drawn between the Cape and other Dutch societies, and particularly between the Cape inventories and those of the Hague and New York, in order to pinpoint those qualities and features which are unique to the Cape house and the people who lived in it.
