While there, Bond witnesses a mysterious nurse named Fatima <b>Blush</b> giving a sadomasochistic beating to a patient in a nearby room.

5|$|For {{the main}} villain in the film, Maximillian Largo, Connery {{suggested}} Klaus Maria Brandauer, {{the lead of}} the 1981 Academy Award-winning Hungarian film Mephisto. Through the same route came Max von Sydow as Ernst Stavro Blofeld, although he still retained his Eon-originated white cat in the film. For the femme fatale, director Irvin Kershner selected former model and Playboy cover girl Barbara Carrera to play Fatima <b>Blush</b> – the name coming from one of the early scripts of Thunderball. Carrera's performance as Fatima <b>Blush</b> earned her a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress, which she lost to Cher for her role in Silkwood.|$|E
5|$|Under {{orders from}} the Prime Minister, M reluctantly reactivates the double-0 section and Bond is {{assigned}} the task of tracking down the missing weapons.

Bond follows Largo and his yacht to the Bahamas, where he spars with <b>Blush</b> and Largo.|$|E
6000|$|Poor Bertha, {{she could}} not help blushing. It was her unfortunate nature to do so. When her {{feelings}} were touched--ever so little--she <b>blushed,</b> and then she <b>blushed</b> because she had <b>blushed,</b> and <b>blushed</b> again to think herself so silly! ...|$|R

5|$|Wine critics {{considered}} white Zinfandel to be insipid and uninteresting in the 1970s and 1980s, although modern white Zinfandels {{have more}} fruit and less cloying sweetness. Nevertheless, {{the success of}} this <b>blush</b> wine saved many old vines in premium areas, which came into their own {{at the end of the}} 20th century as red Zinfandel wines came back into fashion. Although the two wines taste dramatically different, both are made from the same (red) grapes, processed in a different way.|$|E
5|$|Bond {{investigates the}} {{hijacking}} of two cruise missiles with live nuclear warheads {{which had been}} taken by SPECTRE. He meets Domino Petachi, the pilot's sister, and her lover, Maximillian Largo, a SPECTRE agent. Following them to France, Bond informs Domino of her brother's death and subsequently finds his MI6 colleague killed by Fatima <b>Blush,</b> another SPECTRE agent: Bond kills her. Bond and Felix Leiter then attempt to board Largo's motor yacht, the Flying Saucer, {{in search of the}} missing nuclear warheads. Bond becomes trapped and is taken, with Domino, to Palmyra, Largo's base of operations in North Africa, but Bond subsequently escapes with Domino. The two agents ambush Largo while he is placing one of the bombs.|$|E
5|$|The B. z. zonarius and B. z. semitorquatus {{subspecies}} have a dull black head; back, rump {{and wings}} are brilliant green; throat and breast bluish-green. The {{difference between these}} two subspecies is that B. z. zonarius has a yellow abdomen while B. z. semitorquatus has a green abdomen; the latter has also a prominent crimson frontal band that the former lacks (the intermediate shown in the box has characteristics of both subspecies). The two other subspecies differ from these subspecies by the bright green crown and nape and <b>blush</b> cheek-patches. The underparts of B. z. barnardi are turquoise-green with an irregular orange-yellow band across the abdomen; the back and mantle are deep blackish-blue and this subspecies has a prominent red frontal band. The B. z. macgillivrayi is generally pale green, with no red frontal band, and a wide uniform pale yellow band across the abdomen.|$|E

5|$|Finn and Jake then {{attempt to}} find new homes. Initially {{they are unable to}} find a {{suitable}} home until they stumble upon a cave. They clean up the cave and hold a house-warming party, which Marceline crashes. She explains that the cave also belongs to her. Finn, having had enough starts a fight with Marceline, who grows into a huge demonic bat. After she seemingly kills Jake, Finn goes into a rage and violently punches Marceline, who promptly shape-shifts into her regular form and then kisses Finn on the cheek, making him <b>blush.</b> Jake—who was able to use his shape-shifting powers to save himself—runs over to Finn, and Marceline states that the fight they had was fun and {{that the two of them}} can have their old house back, as a gift. Once Finn and Jake return to their old abode, they are promptly hypnotized by King Worm (voiced by Erik Estrada).|$|E
5|$|In mid-1958 Fleming and his friend, Ivar Bryce, {{began talking}} about the {{possibility}} of a Bond film. Later that year, Bryce introduced Fleming to a young Irish writer and director, Kevin McClory, and the three of them, together with Fleming and Bryce's friend Ernest Cuneo, formed the partnership Xanadu Productions, named after Bryce's Bahamian home, but which was never actually formed into a company. In May 1959 Fleming, Bryce, Cuneo and McClory met first at Bryce's Essex house and then in McClory's London home as they came up with a story outline which was based on an aeroplane full of celebrities and a female lead called Fatima <b>Blush.</b> McClory was fascinated by the underwater world and wanted to make a film that included it. Over the next few months, as the story changed, there were ten outlines, treatments and scripts. Numerous titles were proposed for these works, including SPECTRE, James Bond of the Secret Service and Longitude 78 West.|$|E
25|$|Intensely colored <b>blush</b> {{carried over}} from the 1960s to the early 1970s. Tube <b>blush</b> was also {{extremely}} popular. Lipstick in the 1970s tended to be either color or gloss; popular hues included deep pink, purple, and raspberry.|$|E

50|$|In {{the late}} summer of 1988, <b>Blushing</b> John {{was sent to the}} United States to prepare for the 1988 Breeders' Cup Mile held the first Saturday of November at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky. With his regular jockey, Freddy Head, riding stablemate Miesque, <b>Blushing</b> John was ridden by American jockey Pat Day. As a coupled entry, Miesque and <b>Blushing</b> John went off at post time as the even-money favorite. As the gates opened, <b>Blushing</b> John was forced back into ninth in a field of twelve. At the halfway point in the race, he was taken out of his game as an up-close stalker and was placed {{in the back of the}} pack. He was never in contention, {{finishing}} tenth. Following the Breeders' Cup, <b>Blushing</b> John was freshened for the winter.|$|R

50|$|During the 1920s, {{the messy}} elixir <b>blushes</b> of past years were {{replaced}} by creams, powders, liquids, and rouge papers. Powder <b>blushes</b> became more popular after the invention of spill-proof containers and the compact.|$|R

25|$|In {{several of}} the Bond films, the Bond girl is revealed, after her tryst with Bond, to be a villainess. Examples are Fatima <b>Blush</b> (Barbara Carrera) in Never Say Never Again (1983), Elektra King (Sophie Marceau) in The World Is Not Enough (1999), and Miranda Frost (Rosamund Pike) in Die Another Day (2002).|$|E
25|$|Hair in the 1980s was {{typically}} big, curly, bouffant and heavily styled. Television {{shows such as}} Dynasty helped popularize the high volume bouffant and glamorous image associated with it. Women from the 1980s wore bright, heavy makeup. Everyday fashion in the '80s consisted of light-colored lips, dark and thick eyelashes, and pink or red rouge (otherwise known as <b>blush).</b>|$|E
25|$|Erythematotelangiectatic rosacea {{exhibits}} permanent redness (erythema) with {{a tendency}} to flush and <b>blush</b> easily.

People with this type often have sensitive skin. Skin can also become very dry and flaky. In addition to the face, signs can also appear on the ears, neck, chest, upper back, and scalp.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, quite sure, sir." [...] He <b>blushed</b> {{as he said}} that--and rather hurriedly {{left the}} room. How would Frau Meyer have {{interpreted}} Joseph's <b>blushes,</b> and the widow's liberality? I went to bed without caring to pursue that question.|$|R
50|$|During {{the third}} week of May in the $750,000 Grade I Pimlico Special Handicap at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland, <b>Blushing</b> John was listed at post time as the third choice in a field of twelve graded stakes winners at 7-1. The field broke well, and <b>Blushing</b> John was a factor early, being forwardly placed. He held back in fourth under patient Pat Day going into the famous clubhouse turn. Slew City Slew and local {{favorite}} Little Bold John led down the back stretch. Then <b>Blushing</b> John made his move on the far turn and came into contention, challenging Laffit Pincay, Jr. on Slew City Slew. In the stretch, <b>Blushing</b> John passed Slew City Slew, but Proper Reality went by them both with Jerry Bailey aboard. <b>Blushing</b> John then bore down on Proper Reality and passed him with a sixteenth to go to win by two lengths.|$|R
