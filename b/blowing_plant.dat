50|$|The organ, {{parts of}} which date from 1841 and earlier, is {{essentially}} a Harrison and Harrison of 1914 vintage, but incorporating significant amounts of pipework by Edmund Schulze. It was restored in 1927 and 1949 by Harrison and Harrison; in 1965 by Wood, Wordsworth and in 1997 by Andrew Carter. The restoration of the <b>blowing</b> <b>plant</b> and refurbishment of the blower house were undertaken in 1997 by Allfab Engineering of Methley.|$|E
50|$|In 1935 J W Walker & Sons {{provided}} a new electro-pneumatic action and radiating terraced stop tab console {{on the south}} side of the choir (see plate VI). Further work was carried out by Walkers in 1959 including the replacement of the original pedal chests, which after 100 years service were no longer reliable. The Walker console was removed in 1999 when Andrew Carter installed a replacement 5 manual drawstop console built by Nicholson. The <b>blowing</b> <b>plant</b> and Great action were overhauled at this time.|$|E
50|$|All Saints' organ is {{a superb}} four-manual Harrison and Harrison {{instrument}} with 65 speaking stops, built in 1910 to a specification {{drawn up by}} Walter Vale. It retains {{the best of the}} pipe work of its predecessor, the original and considerably smaller Hill organ. Though as big as those found in most cathedrals, it is perfectly tailored to All Saints' smaller dimensions - powerful, but not excessively so, sounding intimate when played quietly, and monumental when loud. Harrison rebuilt it in 1957, replacing the tubular pneumatic action with electro-pneumatic. Electrical blowers replaced the hydraulic <b>blowing</b> <b>plant.</b>|$|E

500|$|In 1905 American Window Glass sold {{some of its}} smaller plants, {{including}} Hartford City's {{plant number}} 32. [...] Plant number 3 still continued operations. It employed 500 people in 1910. Before the start of World War I, American Window Glass Company was still the dominant window glass manufacturer, accounting [...] for {{over half of the}} nation's window glass manufacturing capacity. [...] In 1913, the company continued to close many of its smaller plants, while the large plants were equipped with the glass <b>blowing</b> machines. <b>Plant</b> number 3 was the third largest window glass factory in the United States, and the largest west of Pennsylvania. [...] The Belgian portion of Hartford City's glassmaking workforce was dramatically reduced because of two factors: [...] the glass-blowing machine replaced human glass blowers; and Belgians had difficulty returning from summer vacations in their European homeland after the start of World War I.|$|R
50|$|To {{dispatch}} {{power when}} the wind isn't <b>blowing,</b> backup power <b>plants</b> would be needed, according to Paul Fremont, an electric-utility analyst at the investment bank Jefferies & Co. Natural gas plants can quickly be brought online to supply peaking capacity during periods of low wind or peak demand.According to Art Holland, a director at Pace Global Energy Services, the US will need to replace 140,000 MW of gas plant capacity over the next 10 years due to plant retirements.This translates to twice as much wind capacity due to the difference in capacity factors.|$|R
50|$|The {{management}} of dune restoration projects includes planting vegetation successfully. Merely scattering and leaving seeds over sandy areas {{is perceived as}} a potential waste as strong winds can <b>blow</b> seeds away. <b>Planting</b> of nurseries should be conducted in the hollows of any present sand hills or in depressions of sandy areas. Seeds should be planted in moist conditions and should be lightly covered by a layer of sand and large mature grass individuals should be planted in deep holes with the tops of the plants cut short so as to reduce wind resistance.|$|R

5000|$|Seneca Glass Company {{opened a}} second plant, known as “Plant B” in 1911. [...] This plant {{was located in}} Star City, West Virginia, about {{two miles from the}} Morgantown works. Plant B {{employed}} about 80 people. Products were mostly undecorated tumblers. Lime, instead of lead, was used to make the glass in two small tanks. The glassware was hand <b>blown.</b> [...] The <b>plant</b> was originally managed by Otto Sigwart, who had been president of the company earlier in his career. Sigwart was well-liked by the local members of the American Flint Glass Workers union. In 1914, Otto’s son Charles became manager. [...] The plant operated until the 1930s.|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this project}} is to develop an {{indirectly}} heated gasification system that converts switchgrass into hydrogen-rich gas suitable for powering fuel cells. The project includes investigations of the indirectly-heated gasifier, development of particulate removal equipment, evaluation of catalytic methods for upgrading producer gas, development of contaminant measurement and control techniques, modeling of the thermal performance of the ballasted gasifier, and estimation {{of the cost of}} hydrogen from the proposed gasification system. Specific technologies investigated include a thermally ballasted gasifier, a moving bed granular filter, and catalytic reactors for steam reforming and water-gas shift reaction. The approach to this project was to employ a pilot-scale (5 ton per day) gasifier to evaluate the thermally ballasted gasifier as a means for producing hydrogen from switchgrass. A slipstream from the gasifier was used to evaluate gas cleaning and upgrading options. Other tests were conducted with laboratory-scale equipment using simulated producer gas. The ballasted gasifier operated in conjunction with a steam reformer and two-stage water-gas shift reactor produced gas streams containing 54. 5 vol-% H 2. If purge gas to the feeder system could be substantially eliminated, hydrogen concentration would reach 61 vol-%, which closely approaches the theoretical maximum of 66 vol-%. Tests with a combined catalyst/sorbent system demonstrated that steam reforming and water-gas shift reaction could be substantially performed in a single reactor and achieve hydrogen concentrations exceeding 90 vol-%. Cold flow trials with a laboratory-scale moving bed granular filter achieved particle removal efficiencies exceeding 99 %. Two metal-based sorbents were tested for their ability to remove H 2 S from biomass-derived producer gas. The ZnO sorbent, tested at 450  C, was effective in reducing H 2 S from 200 ppm to less than 2 ppm (> 99 % reduction) while tests with the MnO sorbent were inconclusive. A computer model was developed that successfully predicted the thermal performance of the ballasted gasifier. An economic comparison of an air-blown gasification plant and a ballasted gasifier plant found that operating costs for ballasted gasification plant are about 31 % higher than for the air <b>blown</b> gasifier <b>plant.</b> Hydrogen from the ballasted gasification <b>plant</b> and air <b>blown</b> gasification <b>plant</b> are projected to be $ 2. 43 /kg and $ 1. 85 /kg, respectively.
