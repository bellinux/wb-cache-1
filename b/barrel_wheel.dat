40|$|The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) is {{a general}} purpose detector, {{designed}} to run at the highest luminosity at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Its distinctive features include a 4 T superconducting solenoid with 6 -m-diameter by 12. 5 -m-length free bore, enclosed inside a 10, 000 -ton return yoke made of construction steel. The flux return yoke consists of five dodecagonal three-layered <b>barrel</b> <b>wheels</b> and four end-cap disks at each end comprised of steel blocks up to 620 mm thick, which serve as the absorber plates of the muon detection system. To measure the field {{in and around the}} steel, a system of 22 flux loops and 82 3 -D Hall sensors is installed on the return yoke blocks. A TOSCA 3 -D model of the CMS magnet is developed to describe the magnetic field everywhere outside the tracking volume that was measured with the field-mapping machine. The voltages induced in the flux loops by the magnetic flux changing during the CMS magnet standard ramps down are measured with six 16 -bit DAQ modules. The off-line integration of the induced voltages reconstructs the magnetic flux density in the yoke steel blocks at the operational magnet current of 18. 164 kA. The results of the flux loop measurements during three magnet ramps down are presented and discussed.

40|$|The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) is {{a general}} purpose detector, {{designed}} to run at the highest luminosity at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Its distinctive features include a 4 T superconducting solenoid with 6 -m-diameter by 12. 5 -m-length free bore, enclosed inside a 10000 -ton return yoke made of construction steel. The return yoke consists of five dodecagonal three-layered <b>barrel</b> <b>wheels</b> and four end-cap disks at each end comprised of steel blocks up to 620 mm thick, which serve as the absorber plates of the muon detection system. Accurate characterization of the magnetic field everywhere in the CMS detector is required. To measure the field {{in and around the}} steel, a system of 22 flux-loops and 82 3 -D Hall sensors is installed on the return yoke blocks. Fast discharges of the solenoid (190 s time-constant) made during the CMS magnet surface commissioning test at the solenoid central fields of 2. 64, 3. 16, 3. 68 and 4. 01 T were used to induce voltages in the flux-loops. The voltages are measured on-line and integrated off-line to obtain the magnetic flux in the steel yoke close to the muon chambers at full excitations of the solenoid. The 3 -D Hall sensors installed on the steel-air interfaces give supplementary information on the components of magnetic field and permit to estimate the remanent field in steel {{to be added to the}} magnetic flux density obtained by the voltages integration. A TOSCA 3 -D model of the CMS magnet is developed to describe the magnetic field everywhere outside the tracking volume measured with the field-mapping machine. The results of the measurements and calculations are presented, compared and discussed.

50|$|Used in {{mechanical}} watches and clocks, a barrel is a cylindrical metal box closed by a cover, with {{a ring of}} gear teeth around it, containing a spiral spring called the mainspring, which provides power to run the timepiece. The barrel turns on an arbor (axle). The spring is hooked to the barrel at its outer end and to the arbor at its inner end. The barrel teeth engage the first pinion of the wheel train of the watch, usually the center <b>wheel.</b> <b>Barrels</b> rotate slowly: for a watch mainspring barrel, the rate is usually one rotation every 8 hours. This construction allows the mainspring to be wound (by turning the arbour) without interrupting the tension of the spring driving the timepiece.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{interaction}} possibilities enabled when {{the barrel of}} a digital pen is augmented with a multitouch sensor. We present a novel multi-touch pen (MTPen) prototype and discuss its alternate uses beyond those of a standard stylus, such as allowing new touch gestures to be performed using the index finger or thumb and detecting how users grip the device as a mechanism for mode switching. We also discuss the hardware and software implementation challenges in realizing our prototype, and showcase how one can combine different grips (tripod, relaxed tripod, sketch, wrap) and gestures (swipe and double tap) to enable new interaction techniques with the MTPen in a prototype drawing application. One specific aim is the elimination of some of the comfort problems associated with existing auxiliary controls on digital pens. Mechanical controls such as barrel buttons and <b>barrel</b> scroll <b>wheels</b> work best in only a few specific hand grips and pen rotations. Comparatively, our gestures can be successfully and comfortably performed regardless of the rotation of the pen or how the user grips it, offering greater flexibility in use. We describe a formal evaluation comparing MTPen gestures against the use of a barrel button for mode switching. This study shows that both swipe and double tap gestures are comparable in performance to commonly employed barrel buttons without its disadvantages.

2500|$|The {{idea of a}} driverless tractor {{has been}} around since as early as 1940, when Frank W. Andrew invented his own.

In the 1950s Ford developed a driverless tractor that they called [...] "The Sniffer" [...] but it was never produced because it could not be operated without running wire underground through the field. There were no major advances in driverless tractor technologies until 1994 when engineers at the Silsoh Research Institute developed the picture analysis system, which was used to guide a small driverless tractor designed for vegetable and root crops.

50|$|A special type of overshot/backshot {{wheel is}} the {{reversible}} water wheel. This has {{two sets of}} blades or buckets running in opposite directions, {{so that it can}} turn in either direction depending on which side the water is directed. Reversible wheels were used in the mining industry in order to power various means of ore conveyance. By changing the direction of the <b>wheel,</b> <b>barrels</b> or baskets of ore could be lifted up or lowered down a shaft or inclined plane. There was usually a cable drum or a chain basket (German: Kettenkorb) on the axle of the wheel. It is essential that the wheel have braking equipment to be able to stop the wheel (known as a braking wheel). The oldest known drawing of a reversible water wheel was by Georgius Agricola and dates to 1556.|$|R

25|$|For obtaining {{drinking}} water, wealthier Parisians {{usually had}} wells in their residences, {{often in the}} basement. For ordinary Parisians, {{it was much more}} difficult. The water of the Seine had been polluted since the Middle Ages by the discharge of human and animal waste, the dumping of chemicals by the tanneries, and by the decomposition of bodies in the many cemeteries not far from the river. In the 18th century the Lieutenant General of Police banned taking drinking water from between the present Quai des Celestins and the modern quai de Louvre. Average Parisians depended upon the fountains around city, which were not numerous, did not run at night, were crowded, and required a payment for each bucket taken. Parisians either collected water themselves, sent a servant, or depended upon water bearers, men who carried covered buckets of water or rolled large <b>barrels</b> on <b>wheels</b> to the residence and charged a fee for the service. There were frequent fights at public fountains between water bearers and domestic servants, and water bearers were known to avoid paying the fee at fountains by simply taking the water from the Seine. In the 18th century, a few enterprising Parisians dug Artesian wells; one well at the École Militaire sent a jet of water eight to ten meters into the air; but the artesian well water was hot and had a poor taste. In 1776 the Perrier brothers started a business delivering three million liters a water a day using steam-powered pumps at Chaillot and Gros-Caillou. Facing the organized hostility of the water bearers, the company went bankrupt in 1788 and was taken over by the city. The water supply problem was not resolved until the First Empire, when Napoleon commissioned a canal from the Ourcq River.|$|R
40|$|In {{the years}} 1993 - 1997 archaeological field works were {{conducted}} at site 2 in Janiszewo. The works resulted in uncovering of a rural manor house which presumably functioned {{since the end}} of the 14 th century until the beginning of the 19 th century. Some of the articles found within the confines of the house can be numbered among armament and horseman equipment. We can ennumerate here: an axe, knives, a ball, a crossbow stirrup, a pistol, a spur and a horseshoe. The axe was identified as type IX (according to the typology by M. Glosek) and thereby it can be assumed that this tool was used only on special occasions. Since the axe bears features characteristic both for the period between the first half of the 13 th century and the present times and since it was found within the limits of the house yard, its dating is very much limited. Similar problem with accurate dating arises in case o f recovered in the same place seventeen knives. Their pommels were from 5 to 15 cm long. Among the knives a fragment of a kitchen chopper was distinguished. An iron ball, 17 mm in diameter, was presumably either a musket bullet or a bullet shot from a crossbow. The 16 th or 17 th century stirrup from a hunting or sports crossbow was helpful not only while tightening the bowstring, but also while hanging the crossbow on the wall. A pistol, with an octahedral 10 mm calibre <b>barrel</b> and a <b>wheel</b> lock, probably belongs to an early form of a pistol, still with a characteristic smooth barrel. Its origin may be dated to the end o f the 16 th or the beginning of the 17 th century. However, the 17 th century spur with a star-shaped spike does not fit any o f the known spur typologies. A stirrup from the specimen from Janiszewo had been evidently damaged and repaired to be used again. Some of the features of the recovered horseshoe allow to identify it as the type IV, of the II nd group, with the fasteners o f type D, according to the typology by J. Kaźmierczyk. The above described finds were presumably used as either military, hunting or sports equipment. Only the destination of the pistol is unquestionable. The present work should be treated as my contribution to the researches on so far vaguely accentuated issue of archaeologically registered home arsenals from the rural manor foundations.
