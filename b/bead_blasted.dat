50|$|<b>Bead</b> <b>blasting</b> is {{the process}} of {{removing}} surface deposits by applying fine glass beads at a high pressure without damaging the surface. It is used to clean calcium deposits from pool tiles or any other surfaces, remove embedded fungus, and brighten grout color. It is also used in auto body work to remove paint. In removing paint for auto body work, <b>bead</b> <b>blasting</b> is preferred over sand blasting, as sand blasting tends create a greater surface profile than <b>bead</b> <b>blasting.</b> In creating a uniform surface finish on machined parts. It is additionally used in cleaning mineral specimens, most of which have a Mohs hardness of 7 or less and would thus be damaged by sand.|$|R
40|$|The <b>bead</b> <b>blasting</b> {{process is}} {{widespread}} {{in both the}} automotive and aerospace industry and is performed {{in order to improve}} the fatigue strength of various components. <b>Bead</b> <b>blasting</b> is a cold plastic forming process during which the surface of the material processed is hit by small, hard particles consisting of steel pellets, bearing balls or glass beads. It increases the hardness of the outer layer and establishes compression stresses inside it, which is why this processing is often used to improve fatigue strength. Contrary to other peening methods, <b>bead</b> <b>blasting</b> does not result in a reduction in the height of the processed surface’s unevenness in most cases. Shot peening changes the residual tensile stresses into residual compression stresses, thanks to which, the lifetime of the parts processed is extended and their carrying capacity is increased. The double shot peening process proposed by the authors consists in a two-stage <b>bead</b> <b>blasting</b> process. The first stage consists in blasting with round cast steel pellets, pellets cut from wire or cast iron pellets. During the second stage the same samples underwent glass <b>bead</b> <b>blasting.</b> The tests conducted on the RSA- 501 aluminum alloy indicate {{that as a result of}} the processing medium’s impact in the form of glass beads or pellets of different diameter and shape, a permanent plastic deformation of the material surface occurs. On the basis of the obtained results it is possible to infer that the choice of parameters of both conventional shot peening and the double shot peening determine the impact thereof on the material’s mechanical properties. Thanks to the application of the double shot peening process there is a noticeable decrease in value of the Ra parameter, by about 40 % on average. When analyzing the compressive stress results it is possible to state that after the first blasting process the value of stress was increasing when moving deeply into the sample from its surface, while after the glass <b>bead</b> <b>blasting</b> the value of compressive stress was significantly higher already near the surface. Double shot peening results in an increase in the value of compressive stresses by 40 - 50 % when compared to conventional blasting...|$|R

25|$|Sandblasting or <b>bead</b> <b>blasting</b> is {{a generic}} {{term for the}} process of smoothing, shaping, and {{cleaning}} a hard surface by forcing solid particles across that surface at high speeds. Sandblasting equipment typically consists of a chamber in which sand and air are mixed. The mixture travels through a hand-held nozzle to direct the particles toward the surface or workpiece. Nozzles {{come in a variety}} of shapes, sizes, and materials. Boron carbide is a popular material for nozzles because it resists abrasive wear well. In 1870, the sandblasting process was invented and patented by Benjamin Chew Tilghman.|$|R

In the therapy of periodontitis, supra- and subgingival scaling and root planing plays a main role. The procedure described combines perfect root cleaning without scaling and root planing and minimal invasive periodontal surgery without a scalpel. Material and methods: Glass beads of 90 &micro;m were used with the kinetic preparation unit PrepStart&reg; under a pressure of 0. 5 &ndash; 5 bar. This technique was practised only under visual control using the OPMI&reg; PRO Magis microscope. Seven examinations were carried out at baseline after 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months. Results: Time shows a statistically significant influence on all of the considered target variables (P &lt; 0. 0001 for all). As the according estimate is negative, probing depth decreases over time. The major decrease seems to be during the first 6 months. Considering probing depth, plaque on the main effect root shows significant influence (again, P &lt; 0. 0001 for all). Observations with high probing depth at the beginning were faster than those with low probing depth. The same characteristic appears by attachment level. Patients with more loss of attachment show more gain. Conclusions: Using microscope-controlled glass <b>bead</b> <b>blasting</b> results in a perfectly clean root surface using visual control (magnification 20 &times;). Microscope-controlled glass <b>bead</b> <b>blasting</b> is therefore a good alternative to periodontal surgery. Keywords: {{periodontal therapy}}, microscope, periodontiti...|$|R

50|$|A {{total of}} 217,682 Star BM pistols were made between 1972 and 1992. BM serial numbers ranged from 1,226,501 to somewhere around 1,942,445. The pistols were made without {{mechanical}} variation throughout that period, {{but there may}} be a lot of different cosmetic variations depending on agency issue and commercial sales. In general, earlier pieces were more highly polished and later ones were more of a matte finish. After serial number 1,560,901 in 1981, all BM pistols were fitted with a ramped and serrated front sight. At approximately this same serial number a few other shortcuts were used to expedite production - a shorter rollmark/slide legend, coarser polish limited to side of the slide and frame, and all the small parts were given a <b>bead</b> <b>blast</b> matte finish. The slide cocking serrations are also reduced in number on these later pistols.|$|R

5000|$|The {{original}} Trooper {{was basically}} a heavy-barreled version of the Officers Model Match, and was based on Colt’s medium Iframe. It was offered in [...]22 Long Rifle and [...]38 Special chamberings. Manufactured with fine carbon steel, it was available in both blued and nickel-plated finishes. Early blued Troopers boasted a two-tone color scheme with dull Colt Royal Blue on the flat surfaces and a black <b>bead</b> <b>blasted</b> texture on the edges and cylinder flutes. Both Target and Service versions of the Trooper were available, the Target models sporting hand-filling Walnut grips, larger and wider target hammers, and adjustable iron sights. Service versions featured smaller more basic hammers and stocks, and fixed sights. Barrel lengths available included four inch in [...]22 caliber and four and six inch in [...]38 Special; the [...]22 {{was intended as a}} ‘practice’ weapon. All the Troopers from this series had hammer mounted firing pins.

50|$|After {{degating}} {{and heat}} treating, sand or other molding media may remain {{adhered to the}} casting. To remove any mold remnants, the surface is cleaned using a blasting process. This means a granular media will be propelled against {{the surface of the}} casting to mechanically knock away the adhering sand. The media may be blown with compressed air, or may be hurled using a shot wheel. The cleaning media strikes the casting surface at high velocity to dislodge the mold remnants (for example, sand, slag) from the casting surface. Numerous materials may be used to clean cast surfaces, including steel, iron, other metal alloys, aluminium oxides, glass beads, walnut shells, baking powder, and many others. The blasting media is selected to develop the color and reflectance of the cast surface. Terms used to describe this process include cleaning, <b>bead</b> <b>blasting,</b> and sand blasting. Shot peening may be used to further work-harden and finish the surface.|$|R
40|$|For {{high quality}} {{electroplated}} products, surfaces must be thoroughly pre-treated. For this purpose electroplating currently needs {{a variety of}} chemical baths.

40|$|AbstractElectrical {{discharge}} machining (EDM) {{has been known}} for many years to induce degradation of fatigue strength. Outdated or coarse EDM processing methods can reduce the fatigue strength of titanium alloy Ti– 6 Al– 4 V by as much as factors of 2 – 5, but a paucity of fatigue data exists for this important aerospace alloy processed with modern EDM techniques. An experimental study is presented in which the degradation of fatigue strength of Ti– 6 Al– 4 V due to improved EDM processing is measured in axial tension at a load ratio of R= 0. 1. It is shown that, relative to specimens finely milled, state-of-the-art EDM processing causes a reduction of fatigue strength by 15 – 30 %. This strength degradation is found to correlate directly to the thickness and roughness of recast layers created by the solidification of melt material formed during EDM. Post-processing with either electrochemical polishing or <b>bead</b> <b>blasting</b> is demonstrated to remove the deleterious effects of EDM, such that specimens possessed intrinsic fatigue behavior as indicated by crack initiation at interior locations...|$|R
