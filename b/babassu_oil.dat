40|$|AbstractCurrently, biodiesel, a biofuel {{obtained}} from vegetable oils or animal fats, {{is becoming increasingly}} important in power generation. The properties of biodiesel {{are tied to the}} chemical composition of the oil or fat from which it was obtained. Esters prepared with saturated fatty acids have a high cloud point, high viscosity, while the unsaturated esters are less viscous and more easily oxidized. In this sense, the present study aimed to evaluate the oxidative stability as well as the hydrodynamic properties of quaternary mixtures of soybean (SBO), cotton (CTO), jatropha curcas (JCO) and <b>babassu</b> <b>oils</b> (BBO). The samples M 4 O (12. 50 JCO: 25. 00 SBO: 12. 50 CTO: 50. 00 BBO, w/w%) and SBO showed the best kinematic viscosities, while the samples M 1 O (16. 67 JCO: 33. 33 SBO: 33. 33 CTO: 16. 67 BBO, w/w%) and CTO showed the best pour point and fluidity point. The oxidation induction time (OIT) was measured using pressure differential scanning calorimetry (PDSC) and also Rancimat and Petro-Oxy apparatuses. The replacement of the studied individual oils by their quaternary mixtures was shown to improve the deficiencies of the individual oils. Among the individual oils, BBO displayed the highest and CTO the lowest OIT values. As for the mixtures, the best and the worst OIT were M 4 O and M 1 O, respectively.

40|$|The {{oil palm}} (Elaeis guineensis) and the babassu (Orbignya phalerata) are palms of {{commercial}} interest in tropical countries and {{are found in}} the Brazilian Amazon. The oil from these palms has diverse uses, such as food, production of charcoal, soap and, most recently, biodiesel. The remainder of the plant, which is the bulk, is not normally commercialized, making it an ideal alternative source of low-cost energy for animal feed. The systems for breeding wild animals in captivity for commercialization and sustainability have an important role in conservation, because these species of game animals are under constant environmental pressure. For the collared peccary (Pecari tajacu) production system, the major part of the cost is feed.

Methods: The microemulsion was formulated using distilled water, babassu as the oil phase component, Sorbitan monooleate-Span 80 ® (SP), Polysorbate 80 -Tween 80 ® (TW), and 1 -butanol (BT). Pseudoternary diagrams were prepared, and microemulsion diagram regions were preselected. Rheological characterization and preliminary and accelerated stability tests were performed. The effect of the microemulsion on the interactions between leukocytes and bacteria was determined by superoxide release, phagocytosis, and microbicidal activity. Results: The developed formulation SP/TW/BT (4. 2 / 4. 8 / 1. 0) was classified as oil/water, showed a Newtonian profile, and had linear viscosity.

40|$|Several alkyl esters were synthesized, purified, {{characterized}} by ¹H NMR and employed as standards for establishing chromatographic methods {{to monitor their}} formation in the synthesis of biodiesel. The efficiency of the chromatographic methods was confirmed with the products of enzymatic transesterification of <b>babassu</b> <b>oil</b> with different alcohols (C 2 to C 4), using Lipozyme as catalyst...|$|E
40|$|Different {{strategies}} to avoid the lipid feedstock oxidation in the enzymatic synthesis of monoglycerides (MAG) from glycerolysis of <b>babassu</b> <b>oil</b> were tested. The reactions were catalyzed by Burkholderia cepacia lipase immobilized on SiO 2 -PVA and the tests carried out in batchwise. The best strategy was tested in a continuous packed-bed reactor. Different antioxidants and emulsifiers were used, including: Buthyl-hydroxy-toluene (BHT), tocopherol, soy lecithin and Triton X- 100. The influence of inert atmosphere (N 2) on the MAG production was also investigated. Results were compared with those attaining in the control reaction. The best performance was obtained using N 2 in the reaction medium, preventing the oxidation of <b>babassu</b> <b>oil.</b> MAG concentrations were 60 and 24 % in batch and continuous mode, respectively. Among the tested antioxidant and emulsifying agents, only soy lecithin {{was found to be}} efficient but its application showed limit performance to be used in continuous runs.  </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{physicochemical}} {{properties and}} fatty acid composition of Attalea dubia (Mart.) Burret (indaiá) seed oil were investigated. The oil was extracted in a soxhlet apparatus using petroleum ether and evaluated for iodine, acid, peroxide, ester, and saponification values. The oil was also analyzed using infrared and {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} spectroscopy. The fatty acid profile of the oil was determined by GC-MS. For each analysis indaiá oil was compared to Orbignya phalerata (<b>babassu)</b> <b>oil.</b> The two oils appeared to be very similar in their fatty acid composition, in which lauric acid (the most abundant), myristic acid, caprylic acid, and capric acid were the four main fatty acids detected. The unsaturated fatty acids content was lower for indaiá oil (5. 8 %) than for <b>babassu</b> <b>oil</b> (9. 4 %). The results suggest that indaiá palm tree could be cultivated as {{a new source of}} vegetable oil with potential for food and cosmetic industries...|$|E
40|$|Oil/Water nanoemulsions were obtained, {{employing}} PEG {{castor oil}} derivatives/fatty esters surfactant, <b>babassu</b> <b>oil,</b> and purified {{water from a}} study based on phase diagrams. The nanoemulsions had been prepared {{by a low energy}} process inversion phase emulsion. Different parameters, such as order of addition of the components, temperature, stirring speed, and time, were studied to prepare O/W nanoemulsions. The influence of vegetable extract addition on size distribution of nanoemulsions was also analyzed. Evaluation of the nanoemulsions was studied in vitro by HET-CAM and RDB methods. Stable transparent bluish O/W <b>babassu</b> <b>oil</b> nanoemulsion were obtained with surfactant pair fatty ester/PEG- 54 castor oil, in an HLBrequired value = 10. 0 and with a particle droplet size of 46 ± 13 nm.

The results obtained for in vitro and in vivo nanoemulsion evaluation, based on the hydration and oiliness, and pH of the skin, shows O/W nanoemulsions as potential vehicle for topical application...|$|E
40|$|AbstractFive {{microbial}} lipase preparations {{from several}} sources were immobilized by hydrophobic adsorption on small or large poly-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) beads {{and the effect}} of the support particle size on the biocatalyst activity was assessed in the hydrolysis of olive oil, esterification of butyric acid with butanol and transesterification of <b>babassu</b> <b>oil</b> (Orbignya sp.) with ethanol. The catalytic activity of the immobilized lipases in both olive oil hydrolysis and biodiesel synthesis was influenced by the particle size of PHB and lipase source. In the esterification reaction such influence was not observed. Geobacillus thermocatenulatus lipase (BTL 2) was considered to be inadequate to catalyze biodiesel synthesis, but displayed high esterification activity. Butyl butyrate synthesis catalyzed by BTL 2 immobilized on small PHB beads gave the highest yield (≈ 90 mmolL− 1). In biodiesel synthesis, the catalytic activity of the immobilized lipases was significantly increased in comparison to the free lipases. Full conversion of <b>babassu</b> <b>oil</b> into ethyl esters was achieved at 72 h in the presence of Pseudozyma antarctica type B (CALB), Thermomyces lanuginosus lipase (Lipex® 100 L) immobilized on either small or large PHB beads and Pseudomonas fluorescens (PFL) immobilized on large PHB beads.
