5|$|Another {{method that}} {{is widely used}} in these {{analyses}} is mass spectrometry. Here, accurate measurement {{of the mass of}} the unmodified native enzyme and the inactivated enzyme gives the increase in mass caused by reaction with the inhibitor and shows the stoichiometry of the reaction. This is usually done using a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer. In a complementary technique, peptide mass fingerprinting involves digestion of the native and modified protein with a protease such as trypsin. This will produce a set of peptides that can be analysed using a mass spectrometer. The peptide that changes in mass after reaction with the inhibitor will <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> contains the site of modification.|$|E
5|$|When the {{children}} that work for the Vulture are discussing what to do after Superior Spider-Man (Otto Octavius's mind in Spider-Man's body) brutally defeats the Vulture, the Green Goblin approaches them and tells them that he will <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> crushes Superior Spider-Man. Green Goblin is later shown having gathered a new gang of followers together in the sewers formed from discarded members of other villains' gangs like Vulture, Owl and the third White Dragon's gangs. These henchmen escaped their organizations unharmed because Superior Spider-Man is more focused on the larger threats (where the original Spider-Man would focus on individuals).|$|E

25|$|The alga Cyanophora, a glaucophyte, {{is thought}} {{to be one of the}} first organisms to contain a {{chloroplast}}. The glaucophyte chloroplast group is the smallest of the three primary chloroplast lineages, being found in only 13 species, and {{is thought to}} <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> branched off the earliest. Glaucophytes have chloroplasts that retain a peptidoglycan wall between their double membranes, like their cyanobacterial parent. For this reason, glaucophyte chloroplasts are also known as muroplasts. Glaucophyte chloroplasts also contain concentric unstacked thylakoids, which surround a carboxysome – an icosahedral structure that glaucophyte chloroplasts and cyanobacteria keep their carbon fixation enzyme RuBisCO in. The starch that they synthesize collects outside the chloroplast. Like cyanobacteria, glaucophyte chloroplast thylakoids are studded with light collecting structures called phycobilisomes. For these reasons, glaucophyte chloroplasts are considered a primitive intermediate between cyanobacteria and the more evolved chloroplasts in red algae and plants.|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} {{score for}} Legend of Mana was composed, arranged, and produced by Yoko Shimomura.

So you will do things as an actor that are compromising to your physical health and safety." [...] As for the scene were Andy rebelliously plays music over the prison announcement system, it was Robbins' idea for Andy to turn the music up and not shut it off. While in the finished film the inmates watch Rita Hayworth in Gilda (1946), they were originally intended to be watching Billy Wilder's The Lost Weekend (1945), a film about the dangers of alcohol. However, the footage was too costly to procure from Paramount Pictures, and producer Niki Marvin approached The Shawshank Redemptions domestic distribution rights-holder Columbia Pictures, who offered a list of lower-priced titles, one of which was Gilda.|$|E
500|$|Despite another lockout {{beginning}} on 15 September 2012, the Sedins {{decided that they}} would only return to Modo, now managed by former teammate Markus Näslund, if the entire 2012–13 season wound up cancelled. Instead, the shortened season begun on January 2013, and during it Henrik passed Näslund as the franchise's all-time leading scorer with 757 points. After scoring the record-setting point, Sedin was given a standing ovation that carried on as play continued. After three minutes, the play stopped and Sedin saluted the crowd. During a commercial break, the Canucks ran a tribute video for the accomplishment, featuring congratulations from Näslund and Trevor Linden, the third-leading scorer in team history. In {{the final game of}} the season, Head Coach Alain Vigneault wanted to rest his regulars ahead of the playoffs. However, he played Henrik in the game though only for 22 seconds; he left the bench after just one shift. For his part, Henrik told Vigneault that [...] "he would be okay with sitting out the game" [...] and to him the streak is just [...] "a number in the paper." [...] Vigneault responded by telling Sedin that [...] "he's not going to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> breaks the streak", and he gave him the choice to remain on the bench or return to the locker room. Sedin felt remaining on the bench would have been a further distraction and chose to leave. Henrik finished the season with 11 goals and 45 points in 48 games.|$|E

Minnesota slumped {{towards the end of the}} season and the Canucks won their fifth-straight Northwest Division title with a 2–1 victory over the Blackhawks. In the game, Schneider suffered a groin injury and was unable to play the last two games of the season; he was listed by the Canucks as day-to-day with a [...] "body" [...] injury. With Schneider out, the Canucks lost their final two regular season games. In their final loss, Vigneault rested many of his regulars, though he received criticism for playing Henrik Sedin for only 22 seconds. Furthermore, Sedin left the bench after his one shift. The Los Angeles Times Helene Elliott called it a cheap way of keeping Sedin's ironman streak intact. For his part, Henrik Sedin told Vigneault that [...] "he would be okay with sitting out the game" [...] and to him the streak is just [...] "a number in the paper." [...] Vigneault responded by telling Sedin that [...] "he's not going to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> breaks the streak," [...] and he gave him the choice to remain on the bench or return to the locker room. Sedin felt remaining on the bench would have been a further distraction and chose to leave. By season's end, the Sedin twins' point production dropped from the previous years. Henrik's point points-per-game average was the lowest it had been since 2007–08, while Daniel's was his worst since 2003–04. The Cauncks' power play also struggled throughout the year dropping from fourth in 2011–12 to 23rd in the League.|$|E
