40|$|Low {{power has}} emerged as a {{principal}} theme in today’s electronics industry. With ever increasing level of device integration and the growth in complexity of electronic circuits, increasing the demand of portable electronics devices and also dependence on the battery operated devices motivating the VLSI designers to reduce the power dissipation, of the VLSI circuits. The reduction of power is the most often used measures of the efficiency of VLSI circuits. Low power circuits have long battery life. Power consumption due to memory accesses in a computing system often constitutes the dominant portion of the total power consumption. Measures have to be taken to reduce power consumption in memories. FPGA provide a short time to market and low design cost, which make them increasingly attractive. So a FPGA is designed with various blocks in it. The basic motive {{of this paper is to}} analyze the SRAM memory cell which will consume lesser power. FPGA consists of memory block, logical <b>block,</b> <b>switch</b> block, connection block. The memory block consists of memory cell. The memory cell used is 10 T SRAM cell. The 10 T SRAM cell is designed using c 2 mos logic which consumes less power. The designed 10 T SRAM cell is used in the read circuit of the memory block. The logic block and switch block is also designed. Power results of FPGA blocks have been obtained and power results of existing system and proposed system have been compared.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the preliminary {{work in the}} development of an MPEG- 4 audio transcoder between the time/frequency (T/F) and the structured audio (SA) formats. Our approach consists in not going from T/F format through to waveform data and back again to SA, but extracting the score information from an intermediate stage. For this intermediate form we have chosen the input of the filterbank and <b>block</b> <b>switching</b> tool, which consists of frequency data. This data is the result of windowing and applying the modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT) to the signal. The size of the window to be used is determined in a frame-by-frame basis by a psychoacoustics analysis of the data. In this paper we show that this approach is feasible by developing a system which extracts the score information from the filterbank and <b>block</b> <b>switching</b> tool output in a MPEG- 4 T/F encoder by adapting and fine-tuning some existing processing techniques.

40|$|Abstract—This paper explores {{theories}} on designing optimal multipoint interconnection structures, and proposes a simple switch box design scheme {{which can be}} directly applied to field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), switch box designs, and communication switching network designs. We present a new hyperuniversal switch box designs with four sides and terminals on each side, which is routable for every multipin net-routing requirement. This new design is proved to be optimum for a I FFF S and close to optimum for T with T &quot;Q switches. We also give a formal analysis and extensive benchmark experiments on routability comparisons between today’s most well-known FPGA switch boxes like disjoint <b>switch</b> <b>blocks</b> (Xilinx XC 4000 Type), Wilton’s <b>switch</b> <b>blocks,</b> Universal <b>switch</b> <b>blocks,</b> and our Hyperuniversal switch boxes. We apply the design scheme to rearrangeable switching network designs targeting for applications of connecting multiple terminals (e. g., teleconferencing). Simply using a-sided hyperuniversal <b>switch</b> <b>block</b> with a crossbar attached to each side, one can build a three-stage one-sided polygonal switching network capable of realizing every multipoint connection requirement on terminals. Besides, due to the fine-grained decomposition property of our design scheme, the new switch box designs are highly scalable and simple on physical layout and routing algorithm implementations.

50|$|A {{crossbar}} switch is an assembly of individual switches between {{a set of}} inputs {{and a set of}} outputs. The switches are arranged in a matrix. If the {{crossbar switch}} has M inputs and N outputs, then a crossbar has a matrix with M × N cross-points or places where the connections cross. At each crosspoint is a switch; when closed, it connects one of the inputs to one of the outputs. A given crossbar is a single layer, non-blocking switch. Non-blocking means that other concurrent connections do not prevent connecting other inputs to other outputs.
