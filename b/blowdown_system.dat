50|$|Rocket engines were {{selected}} {{due to their}} inherent compactness and light weight as well as {{eliminating the need for}} a large and destabilizing air inlet duct. The drawback to rocket engines is the large mass of fuel and oxidizer they require, and the potential for explosion. The amount of rocket propellant needed for RV-1 is minimized by keeping the size and weight of the vehicle as small as possible, while still storing enough energy on board to achieve the target speed. RV-1 will have a capacity for approximately 4,200 lbs combined weight of liquid oxygen (LOX) and kerosene. This will be sufficient to support a continuous thrust of 35,000 lbs for a minimum of 30 seconds or 50,000 lbs for a minimum of 17 seconds. The thrust will be variable {{so that it can be}} tailored to match the planned trajectory for each run. Trajectories will be plotted based on drag curves calculated through detailed computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis. To avoid the mechanical complexity of a pump-fed system, a <b>blowdown</b> <b>system</b> will be used with nitrogen pressurizing the LOX and kerosene tanks. The explosion hazard is minimized by placement of the LOX and kerosene tanks in separate compartments, divided by bulkheads and further separated with the cockpit and the nitrogen tanks.|$|E
40|$|To {{enable a}} more {{realistic}} and accurate calculation of the radiological consequences of a steam generator tube rupture (SGTR), a fission product transport model was developed. As the radiological releases strongly depend on the thermal-hydraulic transient, the model {{was included in the}} RELAP 5 input decks of the Belgian Nuclear Power Plants. This enables the coupled calculation of the thermal-hydraulic transient and the radiological release. The fission product transport model tracks the concentration of the fission products in the primary circuit, in each of the SGs {{as well as in the}} condenser. This leads to a system of six coupled, first order ordinary differential equations with time dependent coefficients. Flashing, scrubbing, atomisation and dry out of the break how are accounted for. Coupling with the thermal-hydraulic calculation and correct modelling of the break position enables an accurate calculation of the mixture level above the break. Pre-and post-accident spiking in the primary circuit are introduced. The transport times in the FW-system and the SG <b>blowdown</b> <b>system</b> are also taken into account, as is the decontaminating effect of the primary make-up system and of the SG <b>blowdown</b> <b>system.</b> Physical input parameters such as the partition coefficients, half life times and spiking coefficients are explicitly introduced so that the same model can be used for iodine, caesium and noble gases.

A <b>blowdown</b> <b>system</b> was designed, built, and used for conducting the experiments. This system included a special test section containing a unique converging-diverging nozzle system designed for this investigation. In the end, cavitation was achieved by flowing the test fluid through a converging-diverging nozzle.

40|$|The {{parameters}} {{that affect}} {{the design of a}} hybrid rocket for small satellites are highlighted, and the benefit of the oxidizer flow rate control is analyzed. A single-port circular-section polyethylene grain is considered; the oxidizer is 85 % hydrogen peroxide. The engine design is optimized to search for the minimum engine mass when the initial satellite mass and the required velocity increment are assigned. First, the simplest blowdown feed system is considered. The analysis shows that the optimal design depends on a lower limit for the regression rate and sometimes on a further constraint, which is related to the occurrence of thermal choking. The initial values of the mixture ratio, the thrust level and the initial port area to the throat area ratio seem {{to be the most important}} parameters for an optimal design. As far as the oxidizer flow rate control is concerned, several control strategies, namely, constant mixture ratio, repressurization, constant combustion chamber pressure, and constant propellant tank pressure, are compared to the simplest <b>blowdown</b> <b>system.</b> The constant mixture ratio control is the worst case, as the mass and volume are similar to the blowdown case, while a large thrust variation occurs. Repressurization reduces the thrust variation. Constant pressure controls (both combustion chamber and tank pressures) guarantee a quasi-constant thrust and reduce engine dimensions, with a limited mass penalty...|$|E

40|$|Safety-instrumented {{systems are}} {{implemented}} in the industry to prevent accidents to occur and escalate. The <b>blowdown</b> <b>system</b> on a oil production ship {{is one example of}} such system. If a fire breaks out on the ship, the blowdown system's role is to remove the flammable gases from the current production lines on the ship. This is done by opening of the blowdown valves, that are installed on the different production lines. In this thesis, the <b>blowdown</b> <b>system</b> on a new Teekay ship, and espesically the valves, are applied as case. Since such systems are imporant to maintain the safety on the installation, they are subject to strict reliability performance requirements. Before the SIS is put into operation, it is required to state a certain reliability target for the system. At present, Teekay estimates the reliability based on generic reliability data or reliability data provided from the manufacturer of the equipment. There are uncertainties related to both of these sources. Generic reliability data are collected from different installations where the equipment are operating under different conditions and environment. The reliability is affected by its surroundings, and the generic data then reflects the average reliability in the entire industry. This implies that this data may not be accurate for equipment on a new ship, which has brand new equipment. The manufacturer data, on the other hand are tested under controlled conditions, typically in a laboratory. This implies that the reliability reflects how the equipment performs when it is applied just as intended by the manufacturer. In industry, the equipment will most likely be handled more thoughly, and failures can be introduced during for example, maintenance. This thesis suggests a new way of predicting the reliability. The estimated reliability is based on the mentioned sources, in addition to reliability data collected from the other ships in the Teekay fleet. By using expert opinions (e. g., opinions from operators and engineers) these sources are weighted to create a best possible estimate of the reliability. From these estimates, a probability distribution is constructed. This distribution states how likely the different estimates of the reliability are, where the thesis suggests to choose a rather conservative estimate even if it is not the most likely estimate. After the system is put into operation, failure data becomes available from operation and testing. This data constitutes a reliability estimate based on operational data alone. Since safety systems are designed to be highly reliable, few failures occur and this estimate is uncertain. Because of this, the thesis provides a method on how the operational data can be included in the probability distribution constructed in the design phase. As more operational data become available, the less is the contribution from the design phase assumptions. If it comes to a point where the operational data proves that the reliability of the system differs significantly from what was assumed, it can be assessed whether the regular testing of the system can or should be changed. This thesis suggests that only operational data should be applied to decide such a change. A point which indicates that a sufficient amount of operational data is collected to trust this estimate solely, is provided. Teekay performs annual testing on the entire <b>blowdown</b> <b>system</b> where the results are recorded and applied in further reliability calculations. In addition to these test, they perform monthly manual testing on the blowdown valves. This is because the valves fail more often than the other parts, and the operators on the ship {{want to be sure that}} they are functioning. It is shown how these tests influence on the average availability of the valves, and it is discussed how these tests can be applied as a means to increase the length between the more comprehensive annual tests. The last part of the thesis investigates the uncertainty aspects related to the provided methods, models, and other relevant aspects in the process of collecting and applying reliability data. It is shown that there are a high degree of uncertainty related to all the aspects. Application of generic reliability data is a high contributor to uncertainty. The thesis provides a method on how the generic data can be compared to the data collected in Teekay. This comparison aims at providing a factor which reflects how the specific conditions on Teekay ships influences the reliability, compared to the average reliability found in generic data sources. </p...|$|E
40|$|This study {{takes place}} on a medium sized gas process plant called {{reference}} plant. In this thesis several escalation scenarios, as well as gas dispersion, is evaluated through Kameleon KFX and Vessfire. It has previously been conducted similar escalation studies. However, a normal approach to conduct these studies is to use reference values of a uniform property for heat flux both global and peak, and will only record/evaluate if rupture occurs. In this thesis uses every scenario transient curves for leak flow in KFX to represent the leak (jet fire). From these results individual values for heat flux, both peak and global, is found and used in Vessfire as heat flux exposure on process segment, to evaluate escalation and effect of blowdown. The effect of use of insulation, increased blowdown flow to vent stack and increased wall thickness is also evaluated in this thesis. How a jet fire develops could in some cases be dependent on the geometry of the process site. This is a factor that could get lost when using standardized values for exposure by fire (ref NORSOK S- 001). The results indicates that pressurized pipes with the given properties for carbon steel and utilization as used in reference plant (pipes {{in the range of}} 2 and 3 inch of diameter) is expected to rupture, when exposed to heat flux over 300 kW/m 2 over a time period of 2 to 3 minutes. With the restriction value for flow in the <b>blowdown</b> <b>system</b> today and an increase in flow of 50 %, blowdown alone will not prevent rupture of smaller pipe diameters when exposed as described above. However an increase in depressurization flow and a sequential blowdown philosophy, combined with early activation time for initiation of blowdown is proven to minimize the risk of escalation from one process train to another. When a jet fire passes objects the heat flux could increase on the other side as a result of increased turbulence. When a jet fire is directed into larger objects, the location of hot spots (peak flux values) on pipes and nearby equipment will not vary significantly, with time and strength in the release for the chosen scenarios. The values for global and peak flux will actually in some cases be almost constant. Objects can work as flame stabilizers. However, when the jet is unaffected by objects the hot spots could move over larger distances as the release flow decreases...|$|E
40|$|Compressors {{are used}} {{throughout}} the natural gas industry to move natural gas from production and processing sites to customer distribution systems. Compressors must periodically be taken off-line for maintenance, operational stand-by, or emergency shut down testing, and as a result, methane may be released to the atmosphere {{from a number of}} sources. When compressor units are shut down, typically the high pressure gas remaining within the compressors and associated piping between isolation valves is vented to the atmosphere (‘blowdown’) or to a flare. In addition to blowdown emissions, a depressurized system may continue to leak gas from faulty or improperly sealed unit isolation valves. Natural Gas STAR Partners have found that simple changes in operating practices and in the design of <b>blowdown</b> <b>systems</b> can save money and significantly reduce methane emissions by keeping systems fully or partially pressurized during shutdown. Though pressurized systems may also leak from the closed blowdown valve and from reciprocating compressor rod packing, total emissions can be significantly reduced. Four options for reducing emissions when taking compressors off-line are discussed in this paper. These include: ��Keeping compressors pressurized when off-line. ��Connecting blowdown vent lines to the fuel gas system and recovering all, or a portion, of the vented gas to the fuel gas system. ��Installing static seals on compressor rod packing. ��Installing ejectors on compressor blowdown vent lines. Keeping compressors fully pressurized when off-line achieves immediate payback—there are no capital costs and emissions are avoided by reducing the net leakage rate. Routing blowdown vent lines to the fuel gas system or to a lower pressure gas line reduces fuel costs for the compressor or other facility equipment, in addition t...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the Reusable Reentry Satellite (RRS) Propulsion System Trade Study {{described}} in this summary report was to investigate various propulsion options available for incorporation on the RRS and to select the option best suited for RRS application. The design requirements for the RRS propulsion system were driven by the total impulse requirements necessary to operate within the performance envelope specified in the RRS System Requirements Documents. These requirements were incorporated within the Design Reference Missions (DRM's) identified for use in this and other subsystem trade studies. This study investigated the following propulsion systems: solid rocket, monopropellant, bipropellant (monomethyl hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide or MMH/NTO), dual-mode bipropellant (hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide or N 2 H 4 /NTO), liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen (LO 2 /LH 2), and an advanced design propulsion system using SDI-developed components. A liquid monopropellant <b>blowdown</b> propulsion <b>system</b> {{was found to be}} best suited for meeting the RRS requirements and is recommended as the baseline system. This system was chosen because it is the simplest of all investigated, has the fewest components, and is the most cost effective.

In addition, no new hardware qualification is required for a monopropellant system. Although the bipropellant systems offered some weight savings capability for missions requiring large deorbit velocities, the advantage of a lower mass system only applies if the total vehicle design can be reduced to allow a cheaper launch vehicle to be used.

40|$|The {{continuing}} {{growth in}} the importance of oil and gas production and processing overall the globe increase the need for accurate prediction of various parameters and their impact on unit operations, process simulation and design. Because of the particular nature of various parameters, sometimes existing methods encounter difficulties. Currently several models are available to predict various design parameters in the oil and gas processing industries. However, their calculations may require rigorous computer solutions. Therefore, developing the new predictive tools to which are easier than the existing methods, less complicated with fewer computations to minimize the complex and time-consuming calculation steps is an essential need. It is apparent that mathematically compact, simple, and reasonably accurate predictive tools, as proposed in this thesis, would be preferable for computationally intensive simulations. In fact, the development of engineering correlations by a modification to the well-known Vogel-Tammann-Fulcher (VTF) [1921 - 1926] equation and Arrhenius equation (1889) was the primary motivation of the present thesis, which, nevertheless, yielded predictive tools with accuracy comparable to that of the existing rigorous simulations. Hence, some existing approaches lead to complicated equations for the purposes of engineering importance. This problem has been circumvented conveniently by resorting to simpler approaches, as described in this thesis. The purpose of the proposed Dissertation work is to develop and formulate accurate and reliable predictive tools to serve two purposes. First, being conversion of a set of highly correlated variables to a set of independent variables by using linear transformations. Second one is for variable reductions. When a dependent variable is specified, the method is very efficient for dimensional reduction due to the supervised nature of its methodology. The developed tools in this study can be immense engineering value to predict different process design parameters, including the prediction of hydrate forming conditions of natural gases, hydrate forming pressure of pure alkanes in the presence of inhibitors, water-hydrocarbon systems mutual solubilities, water content of natural gas, density, thermal conductivity and viscosity of aqueous glycol solutions, optimum size of inlet scrubber and contactor in natural gas dehydration systems, estimation of water-adsorption isotherms, estimation of equilibrium water dew point of natural gas in triethylene glycol dehydration systems, true vapour pressure (TVP) of LPG and natural gasoline, hydrocarbon components solubilities in hydrate inhibitors, methanol vaporization loss and solubility in hydrocarbon liquid phase for gas hydrate inhibition, storage pressure of gasoline in uninsulated tanks, emissivity of combustion gases, filling losses from storage containers,bulk modulus and volumetric expansion coefficient of water for leak tightness test of pipelines, silica solubility and carry-over in steam, carbon dioxide equilibrium adsorption isotherms, estimation of packed column size, estimation of thermal insulation thickness, transport properties of carbon dioxide, aqueous solubility of light hydrocarbons, estimation of economic thermal insulation thickness, water content of air at elevated pressures, surface tension of paraffin hydrocarbons, aqueous solubility and density of carbon dioxide, aqueous solubility of light hydrocarbons, thermal conductivity of hydrocarbons, downcomer design velocity and vapour capacity correction factor in fractionators, estimation of convection heat transfer coefficients and efficiencies for finned tubular sections, estimation of heat losses from process piping and equipment surfaces, prediction of absorption/stripping factors, correlating theoretical stages and operating reflux in fractionators, design of radiant and convective sections of direct fired heaters and many other engineering parameters. Following the development of predictive tools, experimental work was undertaken to measure the density and viscosity, of ethylene glycol + water, diethylene glycol + water, and triethylene glycol + water mixtures at temperatures ranging from 290 K to 440 K and concentrations ranging from 20 mol % glycol to 100 mol % glycol. Our data were correlated using a novel Arrhenius-type equation based predictive tool and a thermodynamical method (the generalized corresponding states principle (GCSP)). Both novel Arrhenius-type equation based predictive tool and GCSP method, with two adjustable parameters for each property, offer the potential for judicious extrapolation of density and viscosity data for all glycol + water mixtures. In addition, in this thesis, the PreTOG software package has been developed, which covers a wide range of parameters in oil, gas and chemical processing industries and is using PC-based Windows and Matlab graphical user interfaces and tool boxes. The PreTOG software is also available on an stand-alone CD.

40|$|Salinity Gradient Power by Reverse Electrodialysis (SGP-RE) {{technology}} {{allows the}} production of electricity from the different chemical potentials of two differently concentrated salty solutions flowing in alternate channels suitably separated by selective ion exchange membranes. In SGP-RE, {{as well as in}} conventional ElectroDialysis (ED) technology, the process performance dramatically depends on the stack geometry and the internal fluid dynamics conditions: optimizing the system geometry in order to guarantee lower pressure drops (DP) and uniform flow rates distribution within the channels is a topic of primary importance. Although literature studies on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis and optimization of spacer-filled channels have been recently increasing in number and range of applications, only a few efforts have been focused on the analysis of the overall performance of the process. In particular, the proper attention should be devoted to verify whether the spacer geometry optimization really represents the main factor affecting the overall process performance. In the present work, realized within the EU-FP 7 funded REAPower project, CFD simulations were carried out in order to assess the effects of different parameters on the global process efficiency, such as the choice of spacer material and morphology, and the optimization of feed and <b>blowdown</b> distribution <b>systems.</b> Spacer material and morphology can affect the fluid dynamics inside each channel. In particular, the appropriate choice of net spacer material can influence the slip/no-slip condition of the flow on the spacer wires, thus significantly affecting the channel fluid dynamics in terms of pressure drops. A Unit Cell approach was adopted to investigate the effect of the different choices on the fluid flow along the channel. Also, the possibility of choosing a porous medium to substitute the net spacer was theoretically addressed. Such investigation focused on the porosity and the fiber radius required to respect the process constrains of pressure drops and mechanical stability. On the other hand, the overall pressure drops of a SGP-RE or ED stack can be considered as resulting from different contributions: the pressure drop relevant to the feed distributor, the pressure drop inside the channel, and the pressure drop in the discharging collector. The choice of the optimal stack geometry is, therefore, strongly related to the need of both minimizing each of the above terms and obtaining the most uniform feed streams distribution among the stack channels. In order to investigate such aspects, simulations were performed on a simplified ideal planar stack with either 50 spacer-less or 50 spacer-filled channels. The effect of the distribution/collector channel thickness and geometry on single-channel flow rates and overall pressure drops in the system was analyzed and a significant influence of distributor layout and size on the overall process performance was found...|$|R
40|$|The {{next phase}} of Mars {{exploration}} will utilize a network of small low-cost landers, penetrators, microrovers and other surface devices to provide site-diversity. Direct Earth communications link, if required for these landers, will drive the lander design for two reasons: a) mass and complexity of a steerable high-gain antenna and b) electric power supply for high-power X-band amplifier (solar panel and battery mass). Total mass of the direct-Earth-link hardware for several recent small-lander designs exceeded mass of scientific payload. Alternatively, local UHF communication link via a relay spacecraft can be used. Resource requirements of this link are comparatively trivial; a simple whip antenna and less than 1 Watt power. Clearly, using a Mars Relay Space craft (MRS) is the preferred option if MRS can be accomplished in an affordable and robust way. Our paper describes a point design of such mission. We have asked the following question: What is the lowest-cost MRS spacecraft design {{that can be used}} for relaying scientific data from stations on Martian surface to Earth as well as for commanding these stations? Specifically, requirements for our MRS study were based on the latest IMEWG mission model for post- 2001 era. The typical data return is total 65 Mbit/sol from six landers to be relayed in one 4 -hour DSN contact using 34 -m subnet. The mission design assumes dedicated MRS launch on the NASA Small Expendable Launch Vehicle to LEO parking orbit. Small spin-stabilized upper stage (Star- 27) will inject the space craft to the Mars transfer orbit. The capability of this configuration is 98 kg (to C 3 = 10. 2 kg 2 /m 2). The spacecraft provides all propulsion after injection: trajectory corrections, Mars orbit insertion and maintenance, and attitude control. The simple <b>blowdown</b> monopropellant hydrazine <b>system</b> has Δv capability of 1850 m/sec. The spacecraft is spin-stabilized, with the high-gain antenna pointing towards the Earth. Solar panel is behind this optically transparent (mesh) antenna and is sized for continuous transmitter operation under the worst-case conditions. Highly-integrated electronics is contained in a single unit with the exception of RF hardware and attitude sensors. The attitude determination is performed with a simple V-slit star and sun crossing sensors. Standard X-Band Small Deep-Space Transponder (SDST) is used for the DSN communications and UHF transceiver is used for the in-situ communications at 400 MHz. No antenna switching nor reconfiguration is required. Estimated spacecraft dry mass of 42 kg has 20 % margin. Power requirement is 23 W for spacecraft housekeeping and 17 - 40 W DC for high-power transmitter (depending on orbit geometry). This MRS point design requires no post-launch deployments, has no moving parts and its full functional redundancy and expendables budget is compatible with five year lifetime in Mars orbit. The estimated life-cycle cost of this mission is less than $ 50 M (including launch and mission operations) ...|$|R
