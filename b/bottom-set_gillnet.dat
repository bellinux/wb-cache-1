40|$|The fishery and {{population}} {{dynamics of the}} sacred chank, Turbinella pyrum exploited by <b>bottom-set</b> <b>gillnet</b> off Kayalpattinam, Gulf of Mannar were studied during 2004 - 2006. The size/weight range was between 80 - 290 mm / 60 to 1600 g. The age of the chanks {{was estimated to be}} 20 + years and it reaches 94 / 135, 154 / 453, 197 / 833 and 227 mm / 1195 g in 1 st, 2 nd, 3 rd and 4 th year of life. The length–weight relationship (L-W) of T. pyrum was W = 0. 001728 * L (2. 47087), length–maximum shell diameter (L-MSD) was W = 0. 0011749 * MSD (2. 851393). The VBGF parameters estimated are L∝ = 306. 1 mm, K = 0. 33 yr- 1 and Wα = 2. 5 kg. Estimated total mortality, natural mortality and the fishing mortality are 1. 6913 yr- 1, 0. 45909 yr- 1 and 1. 2322 yr- 1 respectively.

40|$|Gillnet {{fisheries}} exist {{throughout the}} oceans {{and have been}} implicated in high bycatch rates of sea turtles. In this study, we examined the effectiveness of illuminating nets with light-emitting diodes (LEDs), placed on floatlines {{in order to reduce}} sea turtle bycatch in a small-scale <b>bottom-set</b> <b>gillnet</b> fishery. In Sechura Bay, Northern Peru, 114 pairs of control and illuminated nets were deployed. The predicted mean Catch Per Unit of Effort (CPUE) of target species, standardized for environmental variables using generalized additive model analysis, was similar for both control and illuminated nets. In contrast, the predicted mean CPUE of green turtles (Chelonia mydas) was reduced by 63. 9 % in illuminated nets. One hundred twenty-five green turtles were caught in control nets while 62 were caught in illuminated nets. This statistically significant reduction (GAM analysis, p< 0. 05) in sea turtle bycatch suggests that net illumination could be an effective conservation tool. Challenges to implementing the use of LEDs include equipment costs, increased net handling times, and limited awareness among fishermen regarding the effectiveness of this technology. Cost estimates for preventing a single sea turtle catch are as low as $ 34 USD, while the costs to outfit the entire gillnet fishery in Sechura Bay can be as low as $ 9200 USD. Understanding these cost challenges emphasizes the need for institutional support from national ministries, international non-governmental organizations and the broader fisheries industry to make possible widespread implementation of net illumination as a sea turtle bycatch reduction strategy.

2500|$|Drift and <b>bottom-set</b> <b>gillnets</b> are {{the biggest}} {{conservation}} threat to these dolphins in the Indian Ocean. There have only been assessments in some areas, such as Zanzibar. Hunting, until 1996, reduced the population and contributed to its decline. Now hunting has been replaced with eco-tourism. It was estimated in 2001 that there are 161 bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) and 71 Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphin (Sousa chinensis) that are left based on photo-identification mark-recapture techniques. A study on bycatch revealed over 160 incidences of bycatch since 2000. Approximately 30% of bycatch is in drift and <b>bottom-set</b> <b>gillnets.</b> Mortality is about 8% and 5.6% for bottlenose and humpback dolphins respectively [...] The mitigation of bycatch is imperative for these species and eco-tourism.|$|R
50|$|Dolphin {{deaths in}} <b>bottom-set</b> <b>gillnets</b> and trawl {{fisheries}} {{have been responsible}} for substantial population declines in the last four decades. Gillnets are made from lightweight monofilament that is difficult for dolphins to detect, especially when they are distracted (e.g. chasing fish) or moving around without using echolocation. Hector's and Maui's dolphins swim into the nets, get caught, and drown - or more accurately, suffocate (breathing is active in dolphins). Hector's dolphins are actively attracted to trawling vessels and can frequently be seen following trawlers and diving down to the net. Occasional mistakes can lead to injury or death.|$|R
50|$|The longtail {{butterfly}} ray is widely caught for meat and as bycatch in artisanal and commercial fisheries, including in India, Thailand, and Indonesia. It is taken using bottom trawls, <b>bottom-set</b> <b>gillnets,</b> {{and to a}} lesser degree trammel nets and other fishing gear. Though specific population and catch data are lacking, the longtail {{butterfly ray}} is thought to be susceptible to overfishing due to its low reproductive rate and the fact that pregnant females often abort their young when captured. Given the high intensity of fishing pressure across most of its range, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Near Threatened.|$|R
40|$|Lactarius lactarius, {{commonly}} known as false trevally is exploited mainly by trawlers from the inshore waters (5 - 30 m depth) along the Karnataka coast. <b>Bottom-set</b> <b>gillnets</b> and purseseines also land minor quantities of whitefish, besides the indigenous gears operated during monsoon. The average annual production of false travelly from multiday trawls operated along Mangalore coast remained at 416 t {{during the period from}} 2000 to 2002. A declining trend in the fishery was noticed since the year 2000 consequent to reduction in catch rates and the production reached an all-time low of 117 t in 2004.

40|$|Whilst the harbour {{porpoise}} {Phocoena phocoena) {{is the most}} frequently observed cetacean in the UK, it is at risk from habitat degradation, pollution, incidental capture in fishing nets and anthropogenic disturbance. UK, European and international initiatives have highlighted the conservation need to obtain {{a better understanding of}} this species. This research, conducted over 5 years (1999 - 2004) aimed to further the scientific knowledge of the {{harbour porpoise}} in order to influence future conservation initiatives. Studies into the relative abundance, density, distribution, habitat use and behaviour were conducted through combinations of shore- and boat-based research. Technical trials of a towed acoustic device (T-POD) were also conducted from onboard the research vessel. Additional analysis of previously collected acoustic data from <b>bottom-set</b> <b>gillnets</b> was carried out This research presents some of the first examination of the west coast for the harbour porpoise. Porpoise density was found to be exhibit significant inter-anniial differences, with increases noted off West Scotiand and a decrease observed for the South West In the case of Northern freland these results are some of the first quantitative analysis of the harbour porpoise within the region. A statistically significant relationship with depth and in particular the 100 m depth contour was also observed. The area off north Devon (Morte Point) is considered to offer an important feeding site for the species, where porpoises were found to aggregate in areas of high tidal flow. Site-specific differences in behaviour, group size and distance from shore were observed depending on time of day and tidal cycle. A full description of the ethology of the harbour porpoise is also given and the potential affects of dolphin watching tourism assessed. Porpoises were observed to regularly engage in cooperative feeding and aerial activity, previously considered rare. The behaviours, as recorded from shore, differed considerably to those recorded from the boat. This highlights the need for precautionary management to increasing numbers of dolphin watching tour operators in UK waters. Acoustic detection of harbour porpoises around <b>bottom-set</b> <b>gillnets</b> revealed that porpoises are present around the nets on a 24 hour basis. This is highly significant in terms of bycatch mitigation as it indicates that porpoises are successfiilly avoiding entanglement for 99. 75 % of encounters. In terms of monitoring populations the T-POD was found to present a cheap and quick method which detected an additional 10 % of all porpoise encounters which were not detected visually. The results presented here make a significant contribution to the scientific knowledge of the harbour porpoise, which will provide a basis for future research and conservation initiatives.

40|$|The Gulf of California {{supports}} the largest ray fishery in Mexico. Sonora {{is a major}} ray-fishing state, reporting 56 % (live weight) of the Pacific Ocean rays production. <b>Bottom-set</b> <b>gillnets</b> are the principal fishing gear deployed in this artisanal fishery. In the absence of long-term monitoring and complex biological data for fishery stock assessment, {{an understanding of the}} selectivity properties of gillnets can provide a basis for implementation of a standard mesh-size as regulation tool for fishery management. Ideally, gillnet selectivity parameters are determined from fishing trials with several gillnets of a range of mesh-sizes constructed and used in a way to control for factors likely to affect the fishing power nets. In the absence of such experimental data, the present study uses available fishery-dependent monitoring data standardized to construct a data set that meets as near as possible the conditions met in a controlled experiment. A likelihood-based method was used to estimate the selectivity parameters for the shovelnose guitarfish (Rhinobatos productus) caught in the Gulf of California. The values of the selectivity parameters were θ 1 = 105. 7 and θ 2 = 21 741 for 3. 5, 5, 6, 8, and 8. 5 inch mesh sizes.

40|$|The {{coral reef}} areas of Gulf of Mannar support a rich fauna of fishes and bottom set gill net {{is one of}} the {{important}} gears employed in this area. Reef fishes landed at Pamban fish landing centre by <b>bottom-set</b> <b>gillnets</b> operated in Gulf of Mannar, for a period of three years from January, 2009 to December, 2011 were studied based on fortnightly sampling. A total of 69 species belonging to 29 families were recorded during the study and as per IUCN, two species, Himantura uarnak and Rhinoptera javanica are included under the Vulnerable category. The landings amounted to 1761 tonnes during the period with a maximum contribution of 44 % during 2011 and it was the minimum during 2010 with a share of 27 %. Species-wise landings indicated the dominance of Lethrinus nebulosus (11. 5 %) followed by Neotrygon kuhlii (10. 6 %). The richness and diversity indices showed a gradual increase from 2009 to 2011 and all the year wise points in the funnel plot for variation in taxonomic distinctness (λ+) are within the expected limit. The qualitative and quantitative abundance along with different diversity measures are presented and discussed in this paper.

40|$|Approximately 2 - 3 % of the Dutch {{fishing quota}} for sole (Solea solea) is caught by a 60 -vessel strong inshore fleet of gillnetters. From their home ports in IJmuiden, Scheveningen and Den Helder, these vessels fish {{typically}} with <b>bottom-set</b> <b>gillnets</b> for sole during 1 day trips between March and October. Sole caught by gillnetters is typically of good quality and reserves {{a niche in}} the market. Some of the vessels are certified with the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) or Friends of the Sea (FOS). As a condition of these certificates, fishers self-report via logbooks during each trip the kg landings and {{count the number of}} discards by species. Under the European Data Collection Framework (DCF), gillnetters qualify to be monitored by observers. However, their deployment is often difficult {{due to a lack of}} space on board, in particular for vessels smaller than 12 m length. In 2013, for the first time, two trips for sole were accompanied by an observer from IMARES. In 2011 as part of a pilot project, an electronic monitoring system (CCTV) was installed onboard a single vessel to monitor the bycatch of harbour porpoises. In this document, data from these three sources (self-reporting, observer trips and CCTV) were used to describe landings and discard compositions. Because IMARES was only involved in setting up the protocol for the self-reporting and analysing the data, IMARES cannot guarantee the validity of the results herei...|$|R
40|$|Data from a {{monitored}} segment (about 20 vessels) of {{the fleet}} of about 6000 small vessels (less than 15 meters length overall) operating <b>bottom-set</b> <b>gillnets</b> for cod (Gadus morhua) and monkfish (Lophius piscatorius) in the Norwegian coastal zone were used to estimate the bycatch rates of harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena), harbour seal (Phoca vitulina) and grey seal (Halichoerus grypus). Bycatch was estimated using the traditional stratified ratio technique and a GLM-based approach. Bycatch rates were then applied to the landing statistics for the target species for the whole fleet to estimate total bycatch. The stratified ratio estimates ranged from 2211 (CV 0. 16) to 3218 (CV 0. 17) harbour porpoises, 459 (CV 0. 24) to 565 (CV 0. 18) harbour seals and 68 (CV 0. 27) to 128 (CV 0. 41) grey seals. In the model-based approaches, estimates ranged from 2317 (CV 0. 16) to 3218 (CV 0. 17) harbour porpoises, 424 (CV 0. 13) to 600 (CV 0. 31) harbour seals and 83 (CV 0. 36) grey seals. There were difficulties fitting the models, and the design-based estimators might be considered “best”. Unless the population of harbour porpoise along the Norwegian coast exceeds 176, 500 animals, then current levels of harbour porpoise bycatch are unsustainable. Current levels of harbour seal bycatch (coupled with current hunting quotas) are most likely unsustainable. Estimates for grey seal bycatch based on CRF data were not considered reliable, because of insufficient data {{and the possibility of}} seal misidentification...|$|R
40|$|Commercial {{exploitation}} of palinurid lobsters {{has been on}} the increase due to high demand and lucrative price for live lobsters in the international market. The spiny lobster Panulirus homarus caught generally by traps and <b>bottom-set</b> <b>gillnets</b> support significant commercial catches along the southern Indian coast. Fishery along the southwest coast is seasonal, extending from September to March and peak landings are during October to December. The catch gradually declines from January and the landing is negligible in April and May. The paper presents results of a field study carried out on the ecology of the lobster fishing ground at Khadiyapatanam, on the southwest coast of India. Hydrographical parameters were used to correlate the lobster catch from the coastal fishing grounds during the fishing (October-November) and the non-fishing season (April-May) for which lobster catch and the entangled associated fauna and flora from 8 bottom-set-gillnets operated at different depth zones were monitored. Mean catch in the bottom-set- gillnet varied from 1. 6 to 0. 68 kg/net/day during October-January and 0. 1 kg/net/day during April-May. Negative correlation between bottom sea water temperature and the catch of P. homarus was observed. The environmental and ecological conditions, widespread beds of the brown mussel Perna indica are likely to be impacting the abundance of P. homarus at Khadiyapatanam fishing ground. The major groups of organisms in the fishing ground were echinoderms, fishes, sponges, crustaceans and molluscs.

50|$|The next {{greatest}} {{source of}} human-induced mortality is entanglement in fixed fishing gear such as <b>bottom-set</b> groundfish <b>gillnet</b> gear, cod traps and lobster pots. Between 1970 and October 2006, {{there have been}} 8 instances where entanglements have been the direct cause of death of North Atlantic right whales. This represents 11% of all deaths documented during that period. From 1986 to 2005, there were a total of 61 confirmed reports of entanglements, including the aforementioned mortalities. It is likely that official figures underestimate the actual impacts of entanglement. It is believed that chronically entangled animals may in fact sink upon death, due to loss of buoyancy from depleted blubber reserves, and therefore escape detection.|$|R
