As to Alkan's pedal-piano works, due to a recent revival of the instrument, they are once again being performed as originally intended (rather than on an organ), such as by Italian pedal-pianist Roberto Prosseda, and recordings of Alkan on the pedal piano have been made by Jean Dubé and Olivier Latry.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the series}} is {{extremely}} popular in Japan, by 2002 the success in Japan had not transferred to North America. Although the first four games {{to be released in}} America generally received good reviews, Nintendo had to give away copies of Dragon Warrior.

It was not until Dragon WarriorVII was released that Dragon Quest became critically acclaimed in North America, although reception was still mixed. The series gained more universal praise with Dragon QuestVIII, and began to sell better outside Japan and Dragon QuestIX sold over 1million copies outside Japan.|$|E

5|$|Cambodian Rocks is a {{compilation}} of 22 uncredited, untitled Cambodian psychedelic and garage rock songs from the late 1960s and early 1970s. When the tracks were recorded, musicians in the thriving music scene were combining Western rock and pop genres with their own styles and techniques.

The volcano formed during the Pleistocene epoch, about one million years ago, and since the most recent ice age, it has {{produced}} some of largest and most explosive eruptions in the state.

5|$|Goodrich Castle {{appears to}} have been in {{existence}} by 1101, when it was known as Godric’s Castle, named probably after Godric of Mappestone, a local Anglo-Saxon thane and landowner mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086. Victorian historians, however, believed the castle to date back further to the pre-Norman conquest days of King Canute, and the site may have <b>been</b> <b>among</b> a small number of Saxon fortifications along the Welsh border. By Norman times, Goodrich formed part of the Welsh Marches, a sequence of territories granted to Norman nobles in, and alongside, Wales. Although Goodrich lay on the safer, English side of the border, the threat of raids and attacks continued throughout most of the period.|$|E

5|$|Many of the {{innovations}} attributed to Andriamanelo were not his personal invention. Rather, their origins {{can be traced}} back to the southeastern part of the island that the Hova had left behind as they migrated into the central highlands. Astrology, for instance, had been introduced early to the island by way of trade contacts between coastal Malagasy communities and Arab seafarers. Similarly, archaeological evidence proves the existence of iron implements in Madagascar at least four centuries prior to the war between Andriamanelo and the Vazimba, suggesting that while the technology was not discovered during his reign, Andriamanelo may have <b>been</b> <b>among</b> the first sovereigns in Imerina to make wide-scale use of it in military campaigns.|$|E
