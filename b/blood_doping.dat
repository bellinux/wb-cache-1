5|$|The 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin became {{notable for}} a scandal {{involving}} the emerging trend of <b>blood</b> <b>doping,</b> {{the use of}} blood transfusions or synthetic hormones such as Erythropoietin (EPO) to improve oxygen flow and thus reduce fatigue. The Italian police conducted a raid on the Austrian cross-country ski team's residence during the Games where they seized blood-doping specimens and equipment. This event followed the pre-Olympics suspension of 12 cross-country skiers who tested positive for unusually high levels of haemoglobin, which is evidence of <b>blood</b> <b>doping.</b>|$|E
5|$|On February 13, it was {{announced}} that the Amaury Sport Organisation would not invite Astana to any of their races that season, which included the Tour de France, Paris–Nice, and numerous one-day races. The decision was made because of the doping perpetrated by Astana in its previous seasons; chief among these scandals was the <b>blood</b> <b>doping</b> perpetrated by Alexander Vinokourov in the 2007 Tour de France. The team reacted with surprise and disappointment, particularly since the ban seemed to punish a team that no longer existed, and as a result Contador {{would not be able to}} defend his Tour de France championship.|$|E
5|$|Track {{and field}} athletes are banned from ingesting or using certain {{substances}} by governing bodies for the sport, {{from the national}} to the international level. The IAAF's constitution incorporates the World Anti-Doping Code among other anti-doping measures. Practices such as <b>blood</b> <b>doping</b> {{and the use of}} anabolic steroids, peptide hormones, stimulants, or diuretics can give athletes a physical competitive advantage in track and field. The use of such substances in track and field is opposed on both ethical and medical grounds. Given that the sport functions by measuring and comparing athletes' performances, performance-enhancing substances create an uneven playing field — athletes who do not use doping substances have a disadvantage over rivals who do. Medically, the use of banned substances may have an adverse effect upon athletes' health. However, some exemptions are made for athletes who take banned substances for therapeutic use, and athletes are not sanctioned for usage in these cases, such as Kim Collins' failed drug test due to asthma medication.|$|E
50|$|In 2009 {{allegations}} emerged {{claiming that}} Andreas Klöden used the Freiburg University Clinic for an illegal blood transfusion during the 2006 Tour de France. Later, Kloden and others apart of the T-Mobile Team, Matthias Kessler and Patrick Sinkewitz were confirmed by Freiberg doctors to have <b>blood</b> <b>doped</b> at the University during the 2006 Tour de France where their blood was held.|$|R
50|$|In 2009, the band's own SleazeBox Records {{joined forces}} with Italy's Rustblade label and have {{together}} released TKK's most recent CDs <b>Blood</b> + <b>Dope</b> + Sin + Gold (2008), Death Threat (2009) and Sinister Whisperz (2011).|$|R

5|$|While riding for Astana in the 2007 Tour de France, Alexander Vinokourov tested {{positive}} for <b>blood</b> <b>doping,</b> causing the entire team {{to be removed from}} the race and Vinokourov to retire after being banned from the sport by his national federation and the UCI. After confirming in October 2008 his intention to return to competitive cycling, Vinokourov stated {{on the eve of the}} 2009 Tour de France that he would rejoin Astana, the team he believes was created expressly for him, at the expiration of his two-year ban on July 24. He indicated that Astana manager Johan Bruyneel will be bound by the team's sponsors to accept him, or else Bruyneel would be forced from the team. Bruyneel publicly stated in April 2008 that he did not want Vinokourov on a team he ran.|$|E
25|$|Then on 24 July it was {{revealed}} that Alexander Vinokourov had tested positive for <b>blood</b> <b>doping</b> after the time trial in Albi, which he won by more than a minute As a result, the Astana Team withdrew. Vinokourov's teammates Andreas Klöden and Andrey Kashechkin were fifth and seventh at the time. Vinokourov also tested positive for <b>blood</b> <b>doping</b> after winning Monday's stage 15.|$|E
25|$|Vinokourov {{originally}} won {{the stage}} in 1h 06'34", but on April 30, 2008 he was officially stripped of the victory due to his subsequent positive test for <b>blood</b> <b>doping.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Oprah Winfrey that aired January 17 and 18, 2013, on the Oprah Winfrey Network, Armstrong confessed that he has used banned performance-enhancing drugs throughout much of his cycling career, most recently in 2005. He admitted that he used erythropoietin and human growth hormone, {{and that he had}} <b>blood</b> <b>doped</b> as well as falsifying documents saying he passed drug tests. Doping helped him for each of his seven Tour de France wins, Armstrong told Winfrey. According to USADA, samples from Armstrong taken in 2009 and 2010 as well are [...] "fully consistent with blood manipulation including EPO use and/or blood transfusions". Armstrong is fighting to avoid paying millions of dollars in prize money back.|$|R
500|$|LeMond has {{acknowledged}} since 2010 that the increasing prevalence of doping in cycling {{contributed to his}} lack of competitiveness. Said LeMond: [...] "Something had changed in cycling. The speeds were faster and riders that I had easily out performed were now dropping me. At the time, the team I was on, Team Z, {{became more and more}} demanding, more and more concerned..." [...] He stated he had been told in 1994 that he would need to <b>blood</b> <b>dope</b> in order to win again. LeMond did not focus solely on doping for his difficulties. He frankly admitted to Abt in 1999: [...] "I figure I had three months that went right for me after the hunting accident," [...] three months in which he won the two Tours and a world road race championship. [...] "The rest were just pure suffering, struggling, fatigue, always tired." ...|$|R
40|$|A simple, precise, {{and rapid}} pulse nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance technique for measuring the rate of water exchange across the erythrocyte membrane is presented. The technique {{is based upon the}} nonlinear fit of Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) transverse relaxation time data of <b>blood</b> <b>doped</b> with 1. 7 mM MnCl 2 to the general two-compartment exchange condition. Previous approaches using CPMG data required high MnCl 2 concentrations (25 - 53 nM), shown in this work to induce systematic errors ranging from 35 to 45 %. At 23 degrees C the average residence time of a water molecule inside the erythrocyte (tau a) is 21. 0 +/- 0. 6 ms (SE). The Arrhenius plot for water exchange is linear over the range of 3 degrees - 37 degrees C and th Arrhenius activation energy is 4. 79 +/- 0. 03 kcal (SE). This value does not differ significantly from the energy required for bulk water flow. Results are compared with previous determinations, and sources of systematic error in tau a and the activation energy are evaluated...|$|R
25|$|Vinokourov {{originally}} won {{the stage}} in 5h 34'28", but on April 30, 2008, he was formally stripped of the victory due to his positive test for <b>blood</b> <b>doping</b> the next day.|$|E
25|$|Hamilton's later {{career was}} marred by <b>blood</b> <b>doping</b> scandals. The first case came in the 2004 Olympics, when {{he was accused of}} <b>blood</b> <b>doping</b> by Olympic officials. Hamilton was allowed to keep his medal. Later that year, he was accused again of doping, in the Vuelta a España, and {{subsequently}} served a two-year suspension from racing. He returned to the sport for the 2007 season only to be suspended by his team after being implicated in the Operation Puerto drug scandal. He returned a second time to the sport and retired in April 2009 when he failed an out-of-competition check for taking an herbal anti-depressant which contained the banned substance DHEA.|$|E
25|$|On 30 June 2006, the {{management}} of the Tour de France announced at a press conference that a number of riders, including Ivan Basso, would not be riding in the 2006 Tour de France due to rumours of <b>blood</b> <b>doping</b> stemming from the Operación Puerto investigation in Spain. According to the investigation, Basso was allegedly given <b>blood</b> <b>doping</b> by the Dr. Fuentes in a Spanish clinic. No formal charges had been raised, but following an agreement between the managers of all the ProTour teams, any rider under suspicion of doping {{would not be allowed to}} start in ProTour races. This forced CSC to remove Basso from their squad for the 2006 Tour.|$|E
50|$|Jan Ullrich - DNA tests {{confirmed}} that the 9 bags that were marked Jan, number 1 or Hijo Rudicio (Son of Rudy) all contained Jan Ullrich's <b>blood.</b> An alleged <b>doping</b> plan {{was published in the}} newspaper, Süddeutsche Zeitung, where Ullrich's suspected doping {{during the first week of}} the 2005 Tour de France was described. In 2013, Ullrich admitting to cooperate with Dr. Fuentes saying it was a mistake.|$|R
5000|$|In 2004, a {{test for}} {{detection}} allogeneic/homologous <b>blood</b> transfusion <b>doping</b> was implemented. Flow Cytometry is the method of choice. By examining markers {{on the surface of}} blood cells, the method can determine whether blood from more than one person is present in an athlete’s circulation. The test utilizes 12 antisera directed against the blood group antigens, obtained from donor plasma. The antigens are labeled with secondary antibodies, which are conjugated with phycoerythrin to label IgG or IgM-coated RBCs and enhance the detection by flow cytometry [...] The flow cytometry is able to detect minor variance in blood group antigens. The assessment was able to distinguish the blood of subjects who had earlier received at least one unit of allogeneic blood. [...] This technique is able to detect small (<5%) populations of cells that are antigenically distinct from an individual’s own RBCs.|$|R
50|$|Her {{upward trend}} {{continued}} at the 2016 London Marathon as, after {{a battle for}} third with Florence Kiplagat, she took fourth place with a near two-minute improvement of 2:23:54 hours. The manner of her performance was questioned by fellow runner Mara Yamauchi, as Mazuronak had run {{the second half of}} the race three minutes faster than the first - despite the first half being downhill and the second half being uphill. Her second half of the marathon was also over a minute faster than she had ever run for the half marathon. The London Marathon organisers defended Mazuronak, noting she had given a <b>blood</b> test for <b>doping</b> before the race.|$|R
25|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the 1998 Festina affair, anti-doping measures were put into effect by race organizers and the UCI, including more frequent testing and new tests for <b>blood</b> <b>doping</b> transfusions and EPO use. The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) was also created to help governments in anti-doping.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, Ullrich {{was barred}} from the Tour de France amid {{speculation}} of having doped. In February 2012, Ullrich {{was found guilty of}} a doping offence by the Court of Arbitration for Sport. He was retroactively banned from 22 August 2011, and all results gained since May 2005 were removed from his Palmarès. He admitted to <b>blood</b> <b>doping</b> in 2013.|$|E
25|$|News of {{a failed}} <b>blood</b> <b>doping</b> test by Astana rider Alexander Vinokourov after Stage 15 {{filtered}} through late on Monday evening. On Tuesday, the rest day, Marc Biver announced that the entire Astana squad remaining in the Tour would be withdrawn. Two of their riders, Andreas Klöden (5th) and Andrey Kashechkin (8th), were in the top 10. This altered the general classification standings.|$|E
25|$|As the Tour {{entered the}} second week of racing stage ten saw the first {{mountains}} stage, the summit finish of La Pierre Saint-Martin, where Froome would go on to take the stage win, putting significant time into his general classification rivals. During the remainder of the race the team faced intense scrutiny regarding their dominant performances; Porte was punched in the ribs by a spectator in the Pyrenees, and Froome had urine thrown at him by another spectator. Much of the blame for the poor spectator behaviour has been levelled at the French press for 'irresponsible' reporting. Team Sky then released some of Froome's power data from stage ten in an attempt to calm claims of <b>blood</b> or mechanical <b>doping.</b>|$|R
40|$|Sport {{as a kind}} of {{physical}} activity should, above all, be a way of entertainment for people. However, one cannot forget to mention the other aspects, which sport provides to people, whether {{from the point of view}} of health or psychology. It particularly concerns the improvement of both physical and mental form, prevention against health problems, relaxation, improvement of communication, cooperation etc. Sport has become a phenomena of these days. Shining careers, tremendous popularity and last but not least sometimes huge amounts of money offered to the best sportsmen lead to swindles as a matter of course. Nowadays, the desire for success can overcome the limits of fair play, and therefore a lot of sportsmen tend to the use of illegal aids in order to have an advantage over their rivals. In spite of that, doping is not the term only connected with top-performance sports, but also with recreation sports. Dope substances are used on all sporting levels at the present. The main aim of this work is to introduce readers to the problems of using dopes and their detection. The work describes the ways in which doping checks proceed, and in which sports and on which levels doping checks can be anticipated.

40|$|Haemoglobin (Hb) and haematocrit (Hct) are {{measured}} as indirect markers of doping in athletes. We studied {{the effect of}} posture on these parameters in a typical antidoping setting. Venous blood samples were obtained from nine endurance athletes (six males, three females) and nine control subjects (six males, three females) immediately and after 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 min after having adopted a seated position from normal daily activity. Hb (CV 0. 72 %) and Hct (CV 0. 87 %) were determined using an automated cell counter, plasma volume changes were calculated. Differences between the time points, gender and groups were calculated using a mixed-model procedure. Significant changes were observed in the first 10 min after sitting down but no further changes were noted between 10 and 30 min. Mean directional change for Hb and Hct between 0 min and {{the average of the}} period from 10 to 30 min was - 2. 4 % (- 0. 35 g/dl) for Hb and - 2. 7 % (- 1. 2 %) for Hct. Plasma volume increased accordingly. Neither group nor gender had significant effects. Under typical conditions encountered during <b>blood</b> testing in <b>doping</b> control, a period of 10 min in a seated position is sufficient for the vascular volumes to re-equilibrate and to adapt to the new posture...|$|R
25|$|According to a 2012 {{investigation}} by de Volkskrant, doping {{was used by}} Rabobank riders since 1998 and condoned by the team, with team physicians actively monitoring the health of those riders. According to Stefan Matschiner, a key witness in the Humanplasma scandal, three (former) Rabobank riders were customers of the Swiss <b>blood</b> <b>doping</b> expert. Matschiner mentioned Michael Boogerd, the most successful Dutch Rabobank rider, and said one other team member was a customer. Theo de Rooij, Rabo's manager since 2003 and responsible for pulling Michael Rasmussen from the 2007 Tour de France, did not deny doping was used by team riders, but said {{that the use of}} doping was neither suggested nor paid for by the team. In the 2015 USADA report against Dr. Geert Leinders, it was found that he, and other team doctors, supported and organized a <b>blood</b> <b>doping</b> program within the team for much of the 2000s, which included EPO, blood transfusions, hGH, and cortisones. Riders included in the report that doped during their Rabobank tenure include Denis Menchov, Michael Boogerd, Michael Rasmussen, and Levi Leipheimer.|$|E
25|$|In the 2007 Tour de France, Rasmussen, {{while wearing}} the yellow jersey and {{well on his}} way to winning the Tour, had his {{contract}} terminated by his team and was removed from the Tour. He served a two-year ban from July 2007 to July 2009 for lying about his whereabouts. At a press conference on 31 January 2013, Rasmussen admitted that he had used performance-enhancing drugs and methods, including EPO, growth hormones, insulin, testosterone, DHEA, IGF-1, Oxyglobin, cortisone and <b>blood</b> <b>doping,</b> for most of his professional career.|$|E
25|$|<b>Blood</b> <b>doping</b> {{is often}} used by athletes, drug addicts or {{military}} personnel for reasons such as to increase physical stamina, to fake a drug detection test or simply to remain active and alert during the duty-times respectively. However {{a lack of knowledge}} and insufficient experience can turn a blood transfusion into a sudden death. For example, when individuals run the frozen blood sample directly in their veins this cold blood rapidly reaches the heart, where it disturbs the heart's original pace leading to cardiac arrest and sudden death.|$|E
25|$|The {{positive}} sample at the Olympics, and {{the positive}} test at the Vuelta {{were not the}} only indications that Hamilton was manipulating his hematocrit level. In April 2004 his blood was found to have a high ratio of hemoglobin to reticulocytes (young red blood cells), indicative of EPO or <b>blood</b> <b>doping.</b> His score was 132.9; a clean athlete would score 90. The UCI suspends a rider if the score exceeds 133. This sample also showed someone else's blood was in his bloodstream. However, neither piece of evidence in isolation constituted a positive drug test (and the test for a mixed cell population had not yet been adopted), so no action was taken.|$|E
25|$|At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Hamilton won {{the gold}} medal in the men's {{individual}} time trial. That medal was placed in doubt on September 20, 2004, after he failed a test for <b>blood</b> <b>doping</b> (receiving blood transfusions to boost performance) at the Olympics. Two days after the announcement of his positive test at Athens, the IOC announced Hamilton would keep his medal because results could not be obtained from the second sample. The Athens lab had frozen the backup, which made it impossible to repeat the test. The Russian Olympic Committee appealed to the International Court of Arbitration for Sport to give Hamilton's medal to Russian silver medalist Viatcheslav Ekimov. However, on June 27, 2006, the court rejected the request.|$|E
25|$|On 24 May 2007, Erik Zabel {{admitted}} using EPO {{during the}} first week of the 1996 Tour, when he won the points classification. Following his plea that other cyclists admit to drugs, former winner Bjarne Riis admitted in Copenhagen on 25 May 2007 that he used EPO regularly from 1993 to 1998, including when he won the 1996 Tour. His admission meant the top three in 1996 were all linked to doping, two admitting cheating. On 24 July 2007 Alexander Vinokourov tested positive for a blood transfusion (<b>blood</b> <b>doping)</b> after winning a time trial, prompting his Astana team to pull out and police to raid the team's hotel. The next day Cristian Moreni tested positive for testosterone. His Cofidis team pulled out.|$|E
25|$|Further {{measures}} were introduced by race organisers and the UCI, including more frequent testing and tests for <b>blood</b> <b>doping</b> (transfusions and EPO use). This {{would lead the}} UCI to becoming a particularly interested party in an International Olympic Committee initiative, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), created in 1999. In 2002, the wife of Raimondas Rumšas, third in the 2002 Tour de France, was arrested after EPO and anabolic steroids were found in her car. Rumšas, who had not failed a test, was not penalised. In 2004, Philippe Gaumont said doping was endemic to his Cofidis team. Fellow Cofidis rider David Millar confessed to EPO after his home was raided. In the same year, Jesus Manzano, a rider with the Kelme team, alleged he had been forced by his team to use banned substances.|$|E
25|$|On May 20, 2010, {{midway through}} the 2010 Amgen Tour of California, The Wall Street Journal {{reported}} that Floyd Landis had sent a series of emails to senior cycling and anti-doping officials in which he admitted to doping from June 2002 through his victory in the 2006 Tour de France. It was also reported that Landis and his coach Dr. Brent Kay sent emails to Tour of California director Andrew Messick. Landis had asked Messick to be allowed last-minute entry to the 2010 race; when Messick refused, Landis released his allegations regarding cycling to the media. He accused several former teammates, including Lance Armstrong and George Hincapie, of using EPO and blood transfusions in the 2002 and 2003 seasons. Landis also claims there was <b>blood</b> <b>doping</b> at the 2004 Tour de France.|$|E
25|$|The Copenhagen daily, Politiken, {{published}} further charges {{stemming from}} Operación Puerto on August 19, 2006. The article summarizes Hamilton's alleged doping program during 2003. It quotes Danish doping researcher Rasmus Damsgaard {{on the organization}} Hamilton's program would have required. It cites Bjarne Riis, Hamilton's directeur sportif in 2003, denying knowledge of Hamilton's doping. And the article states that the reporters attempted to contact Hamilton on numerous occasions but were unable to reach him. The article's allegations {{are based on the}} rider's doping and racing calendar obtained by the paper. The calendar was seized in Operación Puerto. The doping calendar indicates use of EPO, growth hormone, testosterone, <b>blood</b> <b>doping,</b> and insulin on 114 days over seven months during the 2003 season. The racing program correlates with Hamilton's races in 2003, according to Politiken. The calendar includes two blood transfusions during the Tour de France. “The first time before the three stages in the Alps and the second before the 12th stage – a 47 km individual time trial,” write the reporters. The article stated that such an ambitious program would have required assistance – “at least four or five people,” according to Damsgaard.|$|E
25|$|Oxygen {{consumption}} (VO2) {{during exercise}} is best {{described by the}} Fick Equation: VO2=Q x (a-vO2diff), which states {{that the amount of}} oxygen consumed is equal to cardiac output (Q) multiplied by the difference between arterial and venous oxygen concentrations. More simply put, oxygen consumption is dictated by the quantity of blood distributed by the heart as well as the working muscle's ability to take up the oxygen within that blood; however, this is a bit of an oversimplification. Although cardiac output is thought to be the limiting factor of this relationship in healthy individuals, {{it is not the only}} determinant of VO2 max. That is, factors such as the ability of the lung to oxygenate the blood must also be considered. Various pathologies and anomalies cause conditions such as diffusion limitation, ventilation/perfusion mismatch, and pulmonary shunts that can limit oxygenation of the blood and therefore oxygen distribution. In addition, the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood is also an important determinant of the equation. Oxygen carrying capacity is often the target of exercise (ergogenic aids) aids used in endurance sports to increase the volume percentage of red blood cells (hematocrit), such as through <b>blood</b> <b>doping</b> or the use of erythropoietin (EPO). Furthermore, peripheral oxygen uptake is reliant on a rerouting of blood flow from relatively inactive viscera to the working skeletal muscles, and within the skeletal muscle, capillary to muscle fiber ratio influences oxygen extraction.|$|E
500|$|The {{investigation}} into Cherepanov's death continued for several months. [...] In December, reports out of Russia indicated that blood and urine samples collected from Cherepanov {{showed that he}} had been engaged in <b>blood</b> <b>doping.</b> [...] This was later clarified, as Russian officials said that what initially appeared to be <b>blood</b> <b>doping</b> was actually an attempt by team officials and doctors to treat Cherepanov's condition surreptitiously. [...] After this revelation in January 2009, the KHL suspended five Avangard officials and doctors for attempting to treat a condition which should have only been managed by experienced cardiologists. [...] The {{investigation into}} Cherepanov's death was reopened in August 2009, after federal prosecutors ruled that the previously suspended team physicians were unaware of his heart condition, and had not prescribed the medications he was taking.
