40|$|Nicks have {{important}} {{functions in the}} biological functions of DNA-mediated systems. However, the configuration transitions of DNA molecules induced {{by the presence of}} nicks have not been quantitatively investigated. This study aims to analyze the configuration transitions of free circular DNA system induced <b>by</b> <b>nicks.</b> Using atomic force microscopy, two configuration states were observed in the free circular DNA system with different nick numbers. To understand the transmission of torsional energy among DNA base pairs, we defined the effective length and nicking angle. In the free DNA system, a torsional energy of 233 [*]bp can be completely released <b>by</b> <b>nicks.</b> Based on the experimental and quantitative results, we propose a physical mechanism to explain the configuration transitions of the free circular DNA system induced <b>by</b> <b>nicks.</b> This study and the presented method are very useful in understanding the physical mechanism of nicks in DNA-mediated systems...|$|R
