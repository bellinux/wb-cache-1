Based on the above, authorgot a number of findings as follows. In the vocational high school curriculum of Bahasa Indonesia Lesson, there is a different emphasis on <b>life</b> <b>skills</b> <b>education,</b> especially for aspects of self-awareness, academic skills, and vocational. In general, BahasaIndonesia Lesson textbooks of the vocational high school had not yet developed a <b>life</b> <b>skills</b> <b>education</b> optimally.

Meanwhile, the teachers argued that they are easy on developing of the curriculum in conjunction with importance of <b>life</b> <b>skills</b> <b>education.</b> The concept of <b>life</b> <b>skills</b> <b>education</b> is not new at all because for them as a vocational high school teachers has been required to direct the lesson materials to the practical things.

The <b>life</b> <b>skills</b> emphasized in the curriculum are psychosocial. The {{purpose of this study was}} to explore how <b>life</b> <b>skills</b> <b>education</b> is being implemented in Ugandan primary schools. It investigated teachers’, education officials’ and parents’ perceptions, competencies and attitudes towards <b>life</b> <b>skills</b> <b>education.</b> The study further explored children’s experiences of <b>life</b> <b>skills</b> and <b>life</b> <b>skills</b> <b>education.</b> It also identified the challenges in the development of pupils’ <b>life</b> <b>skills</b> in primary schools in Uganda. A purposive sample of Primary 2 and Primary 5 classrooms from twelve schools across Uganda was selected. Interviews were conducted with school head teachers, primary school teachers who were trained to teach <b>life</b> <b>skills</b> in the primary school and were teaching the classes used in the study, primary school children, parents and guardians and Co-ordinating Centre Tutors who were the tutors on site in pilot schools’ catchment areas and were the organisers and trainers of <b>life</b> <b>skills</b> in primary schools and were also the monitors of the <b>life</b> <b>skills</b> implementation in the primary schools, and district education officials. Classroom observations were conducted and teachers completed a questionnaire which asked to them to identify the methods they used to teach <b>life</b> <b>skills</b> and the indicators of <b>life</b> <b>skills</b> they witnessed. The results of the study indicate that all stakeholders value <b>life</b> <b>skills</b> although the definition of <b>life</b> <b>skills</b> is not clear amongst parents and teachers. Parents seem to value <b>life</b> <b>skills</b> that are academic and vocational. There was evidence of <b>life</b> <b>skills</b> amongst children from children’s own accounts, the researcher’s observations and the testimony of parents and children. In some cases, the <b>life</b> <b>skills</b> as articulated in the curriculum clash with the cultural values of communities.

40|$|<b>Life</b> <b>skills</b> <b>education</b> is {{a concept}} which {{originated}} in thinking about training and <b>education</b> about <b>skills</b> and competencies that an individual needs for sustaining and enriching life (Bender, 2002). At the heart of <b>life</b> <b>skills</b> <b>education</b> is the learning of <b>life</b> <b>skills.</b> <b>Life</b> <b>skills</b> are abilities for adaptive behaviour that enable individuals {{to deal effectively with}} the demands and challenges of everyday life. In particular, <b>life</b> <b>skills</b> are a group of psychological competencies and interpersonal skills that help people make informed decisions, solve problems, think critically and curatively, communicate effectively, build healthy relationships, empathize with others, and cope with and manage their lives in a healthy and productive manner’ (WHO, 2001, p. 8). The ten core <b>life</b> <b>skills</b> as laid down by WHO (1997) are: Self-awareness, Empathy Critical thinking, Creative thinking, Decision making, Problem Solving, Effective communication, Interpersonal relationship, Coping with stress, and Coping with emotion. <b>Life</b> <b>skills</b> are developed {{as a result of a}} constructive processing of information, impressions, encounters and experiences, - both individual and social - that are a part of one’s daily life and work and the rapid changes that occur in the course of one’s life. The social dimensions are particularly important as they condition life itself and compel individuals to purposefully acquire skills, develop attitudes and values in order to face and master real life situations (Ouane 2002). Considering these benefits, countries are now considering the development of <b>life</b> <b>skills</b> <b>education</b> in response to the need to reform traditional education systems, which appear to be out of step with the realities of modern social and economic life.
