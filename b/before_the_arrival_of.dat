In 1520 Ferdinand Magellan arrived {{to what is}} currently known as San Julián Bay.15 years later Martín de Alcazaba explored the area near the Chico River, which he named Gallegos River. Because of the attacks of British privateers, and after the visit of Francis Drake in 1578, the Spaniards sent Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa to fortify and map the Strait of Magellan and prevent access to Spanish posts in the Pacific.|$|R
5|$|<b>Before</b> <b>the</b> <b>arrival</b> <b>of</b> humans, an {{estimated}} 80% {{of the land}} was covered in forest, with only high alpine, wet, infertile and volcanic areas without trees. Massive deforestation occurred after humans arrived, with around half the forest cover lost to fire after Polynesian settlement. Much of the remaining forest fell after European settlement, being logged or cleared {{to make room for}} pastoral farming, leaving forest occupying only 23% of the land.|$|E
5|$|<b>Before</b> <b>the</b> <b>arrival</b> <b>of</b> the Jurchens the Song dynasty was {{for centuries}} {{engaged in a}} {{stand-off}} against the Western Xia and the Khitan Liao dynasty.

5|$|Scotland {{also has}} {{numerous}} vitrified forts but again an accurate chronology {{has proven to}} be evasive. Extensive studies of such a fort at Finavon Hill near Forfar in Angus, using a variety of techniques, suggest dates for the destruction of the site in either the last two centuries or the mid-1st millennium. The lack of Roman artifacts (common in local souterrain sites) suggests that many sites were abandoned <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>arrival</b> <b>of</b> the legions.|$|E

After the fall of Bari, the cities of Trani, Giovinazzo, Andria, Taranto, and Brindisi were also captured. William arrived with his army, including 2,000 knights, but was heavily defeated.|$|E
5|$|The first {{description}} of B.nothofagi {{was published in}} 2012 by Jerry A. Cooper and Patrick Leonard.

The fungus is most likely a native species of New Zealand and was present there <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>arrival</b> <b>of</b> Europeans. As it is very rare and possibly threatened, B.nothofagi is listed in the Red List of Threatened Species as an endangered species.|$|E

5|$|As is {{discussed}} below, {{the reason for}} the delay was probably simply that neither the Athenians nor the Persians were willing to risk battle initially. This then raises the question of why the battle occurred when it did. Herodotus explicitly tells us that the Greeks attacked the Persians (and the other sources confirm this), {{but it is not clear}} why they did this <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>arrival</b> <b>of</b> the Spartans. There are two main theories to explain this.|$|E
5|$|Because adult great spotted kiwis {{are large}} and powerful, {{they are able to}} fend off most predators that attack them, such as stoats, ferrets, weasels, pigs, brush possums and cats, all of which are {{invasive}} species in New Zealand. However, dogs are able to kill even adults. Stoats, ferrets, possums, cats and dogs will feed on the eggs and chicks, meaning most chicks die within their first five months of life. <b>Before</b> <b>the</b> <b>arrival</b> <b>of</b> mammalian predators, the great spotted kiwi's natural predators would have been birds of prey like the extinct Haast's eagle and Eyles' harrier and the extant Swamp harrier.|$|E
5|$|<b>Before</b> <b>the</b> <b>arrival</b> <b>of</b> Euro-Americans in the 19thcentury, the John Day basin was {{frequented by}} Sahaptin people who hunted, fished, and {{gathered}} roots and berries in the region. After road-building made the valley more accessible, settlers established farms, ranches, {{and a few}} small towns along the river and its tributaries. Paleontologists have been unearthing and studying the fossils in the region since 1864, when Thomas Condon, a missionary and amateur geologist, recognized their importance and made them known globally. Parts of the basin became a National Monument in 1975.|$|E

50|$|The privacy issue {{became even}} more salient as it was <b>before</b> with <b>the</b> <b>arrival</b> <b>of</b> mobile data networks.
