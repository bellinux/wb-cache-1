40|$|Abstract: During Mesoscale Alpine Program (MAP) IOP- 8, {{a strong}} stable layer formed over the Po Valley and {{northern}} Ligurian Sea. Based on observations, reanalysis data and prior studies, we hypothesize that differential advection (Lin et al., 2005) {{led to the}} formation of the stable layer and differential advection along with <b>blocking</b> of <b>cool</b> easterly <b>flow</b> by the western flank of the Alps over the Po Valley played significant roles in the maintenance of the stable layer. Numerical sensitivity tests with the MM 5 model were performed to examine these possible formation and maintenance mechanisms of the IOP- 8 stable layer. When the western flank of the Alps was removed, the stable layer still formed, but eroded more quickly and became much shallower and narrower at the later stage of IOP- 8, which is consistent with the hypothesis. It was also found that the Dinaric Alps and evaporative cooling did not play significant roles in forming and maintaining the stable layer...|$|R
40|$|We examine recent {{developments}} in the cluster <b>cooling</b> <b>flow</b> scenario following recent observations by Chandra and XMM-Newton. We show that the distribution of gas emissivity verses temperature determined by XMM-Newton gratings observations demonstrates that the central gas in <b>cooling</b> <b>flow</b> clusters cannot be in simple steady-state.

While the old steady-state isobaric <b>cooling</b> <b>flow</b> model is incompatible with recent observations, a "moderate <b>cooling</b> <b>flow</b> model", in which the gas undergoes intermittent heating that effectively reduces the age of a <b>cooling</b> <b>flow</b> is consistent with observations.

40|$|We {{propose that}} the outer {{portions}} of <b>cooling</b> <b>flows</b> in clusters of galaxies are frequently disrupted by radio jets, and that their effective ages are much shorter than the cluster ages. The inner regions, where the gas density is higher, {{are more difficult to}} disrupt, and may continue to harbor <b>cooling</b> <b>flows</b> even after disruption events. The main assumption of the proposed scenario is that, on a time scale of ∼ 2 − 4 × 10 9 yrs, the cD galaxies in <b>cooling</b> <b>flow</b> clusters undergo powerful bursts of AGN activity that produce strong radio jets. The radio jets excite shocks in the inner regions (r ∼ < 100 kpc) of <b>cooling</b> <b>flow</b> clusters. A radio burst may result from the accretion of cooling material by the central black hole or from a collision with a subcluster. We assume that the jets remain strong, with kinetic powers of ∼ 10 47 erg s − 1 for ∼ 10 7 years.

40|$|We {{argue that}} the {{presence}} of diffuse synchrotron emission forming the so-called radio mini-halos in some <b>cooling</b> <b>flow</b> clusters can be explained by reacceleration of relativistic electrons, the necessary energetics being supplied by the <b>cooling</b> <b>flows</b> themselves. In particular, the reacceleration due to MHD turbulence has the correct radial dependence on the parameters to naturally balance the radiative losses. As an application we show that the main properties of the radio mini-halo in the Perseus cluster (brightness profile, total radio spectrum and radial spectral steepening) can be accounted for by the synchrotron radiation from relic relativistic electrons in the cluster, which are efficiently reaccelerated by MHD turbulence via Fermi-like processes due to the compression of the cluster magnetic field in the <b>cooling</b> <b>flow</b> region. Since the presence of an observable radio mini-halo in a <b>cooling</b> <b>flow</b> region critically depends on the combination of several physical parameters, we suggest that the rarity of radio mini-halos found in <b>cooling</b> <b>flow</b> clusters {{is due to the fact}} that the physical conditions of the ICM are intermediate between those which lead to the formation of extended radio halos and those holding in <b>cooling</b> <b>flows</b> without radio halos.

If we crudely compare the sample to that of Arnaud (1988), in which approx. 40 percent of his 104 x ray clusters have <b>cooling</b> <b>flows,</b> the result implies that <b>cooling</b> <b>flows</b> may actually be a more common phenomenon in the past than in the present. The connection between the <b>cooling</b> <b>flow</b> and the H alpha emission is a mystery. The straightforward calculation of 1 (photoionization) to 3 (shocks) recombinations per H atom in the <b>cooling</b> <b>flow</b> gives mass infall rates 3 to 100 times greater than M derived from x ray observations. Researchers have made some preliminary theoretical calculations in an attempt to resolve this problem...|$|R
40|$|We review {{observations}} on the chemical enrichment of the intracluster medium (ICM) performed using BeppoSAX MECS data. The picture emerging is that non-cooling flow clusters have flat metallicity profiles, whereas a strong enhancement in the abundance {{is found in the}} central regions of the <b>cooling</b> <b>flow</b> clusters. All the non-cooling flow clusters present evidence of recent merger activity suggesting that the merger events redistributes efficiently the metal content of the ICM. The observed abundance excess in the central regions of <b>cooling</b> <b>flow</b> clusters is probably due to metals ejected from the cD galaxy located in the cluster core. <b>Cooling</b> <b>flow</b> cluster have also enhanced Nickel abundances in their cores with respect to the non <b>cooling</b> <b>flow</b> clusters.

40|$|Similarity {{solutions}} are presented for the time-dependent evolution of <b>cooling</b> <b>flows.</b> A <b>cooling</b> <b>flow</b> expands when the cooling time computed {{from the initial}} gas distribution increases with radius. If certain simplifying conditions are met, {{the evolution of the}} resulting cooling wave becomes self-similar. The similarity solutions obtained here assumed subsonic flow, which is valid in the outer parts of observed cooling flows; they are matched to transonic accretion solutions valid in the central parts. The models are applied to the <b>cooling</b> <b>flow</b> onto M 87, with unsatisfactory agreement at small radius. A local linear stability analysis shows that the similarity solution suffers isobaric thermal instability, suggesting that the neglect of star formation may be responsible for the poor agreement. The similarity solution suggests that the <b>cooling</b> <b>flow</b> around M 87 was more vigorous in the past...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{is made of}} the dynamical effects of the intracluster magnetic field, whose radial inflow and shear can produce {{a dramatic increase in}} the field's strength while rendering it more radial, with <b>cooling</b> <b>flows.</b> It is found that field reconnection is the most likely dominant-loss mechanism, so that buoyancy effects are probably not important. Attention is given to the effect of the magnetic field on thermal instabilities. The most important observable effect of the magnetic field in <b>cooling</b> <b>flows</b> will probably be very strong Faraday rotation of the polarization of radio sources within or behind the <b>cooling</b> <b>flow...</b>|$|R
