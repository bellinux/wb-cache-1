40|$|<b>Barrel</b> <b>electroplating</b> is an {{extremely}} useful method to coat {{a large number of}} components. Despite its successful use for many years it does have drawbacks, often stemming from poor electrolyte movement within the barrel. This can result in issues associated with mass transport, i. e. low limiting current, slow electroplating rates and, in the case of alloy electroplating, inconsistent alloy composition. Field trials carried out at an industrial facility, using ultrasonic agitation during the <b>barrel</b> <b>electroplating</b> of a Sn–Pb alloy, are reported. It was found that if electroplating was performed in a low frequency ultrasonic field then the limiting current could be increased, resulting in higher electroplating rates; the incidence of ‘burning’ was also reduced. In addition, the proportion of components having an alloy coating composition within the customer specification was higher, lowering the defect rate and increasing production capacity...|$|E
40|$|New <b>barrels</b> for <b>electroplating</b> {{have been}} {{developed}} and manufacturers {{of some of these}} newer designs have claimed significant improvements in drag-out losses by their new barrels. Since water consumption and waste generation are directly tied to dragout rate from processing solutions, it is clear {{that there is a need}} to produce a method of evaluating such barrels, so that the user minimizes pollution. This study, funded by The Illinois Waste Management Research Center (WMRC) produced a benchmark test to compare drag-out rates of plating barrels. The study used this test to compare two size ranges of plating barrels, small and large. For small barrels (6 ??? x 12 ???), testing showed that a reduction in dragout rate, as high as 48 %, may be achieved. For large barrels (16 ??? x 36 ???), testing showed that a reduction as high as 44 % may be obtained. A survey was conducted to determine the relative durability of the barrels under study. The survey indicated that some of the barrels that produce lower levels of dragout (those using fine mesh) may unfortunately provide less service life, but other low dragout rate barrels offered service life that is similar to traditional barrels. published or submitted for publicatio...|$|R
