5|$|Colonization and {{expansion}} {{of the kingdom of}} Nri was achieved by sending mbùríchi, or converts, to other settlements. Allegiance to the eze Nri was obtained not by military force but through ritual oath. Religious authority was vested in the local king, and ties were maintained by traveling mbùríchi. By the 14th century, Nri influence extended well beyond the nuclear northern Igbo region to Igbo settlements on {{the west bank of the}} Niger and communities affected by the Benin Empire. There is strong evidence to indicate Nri influence well beyond the Igbo region to Benin and Southern Igala areas like Idah. At its height, the kingdom of Nri had influence over roughly a third of Igboland and <b>beyond.</b> <b>It</b> reached its furthest extent between 1100 and 1400.|$|E
5|$|Depth and {{dimension}} are rendered {{by the use}} {{of linear}} perspective, by the overlapping of the layers of shapes, and in particular, as stated by Clark, through the use of tone. This compositional element operates within the picture in a number of ways. First, there is the appearance of natural light within the painted room and <b>beyond</b> <b>it.</b> The pictorial space in the midground and foreground is lit from two sources: by thin shafts of light from the open door, and by broad streams coming through the window to the right. The 20th-century French philosopher and cultural critic Michel Foucault observed that the light from the window illuminates both the studio foreground and the unrepresented area in front of it, in which the king, the queen, and the viewer are presumed to be situated. For José Ortega y Gasset, light divides the scene into three distinct parts, with foreground and background planes strongly illuminated, between which a darkened intermediate space includes silhouetted figures.|$|E

5|$|Following the abdication of the Russian Tsar in 1917, the Caucasus Front collapsed, leaving Central Asia—and <b>beyond</b> <b>it</b> India—open to the Turkish Army. The War Office {{responded with}} a plan to send a force of {{hand-picked}} British officers and NCOs to organise any remaining Russian forces or civilians who were ready to fight the Turkish forces. This force became known as Dunsterforce after its commander, Major General Lionel Charles Dunsterville, the inspiration for the titular character of Rudyard Kipling's novel Stalky & Co.. It arrived in Baku in August 1918. It was hoped that Dunsterforce could raise an army from the Christian Georgian, Armenian and Assyrian people who had supported the Russians and had historically feared the Turks. While Dunsterforce had some success the task proved beyond its ability.|$|E
5|$|Further along {{from the}} Welsh Bridge is the Porthill Bridge, a {{pedestrian}} suspension bridge running between the Quarry and Porthill, built in 1922. The next bridge {{along the river}} is Kingsland Bridge, a privately owned toll bridge, and the subsequent bridge is the Greyfriars Bridge, a pedestrian bridge between Coleham and the town centre. Following the Greyfriars Bridge is the English Bridge, historically called Stone Bridge, which was rebuilt in the 1930s. <b>Beyond</b> <b>it</b> is the railway station, which is partly built over the river.

5|$|Just beyond East Norwood, the Pennsylvania built McCullough Yard in 1927, {{improving}} switching {{operations for}} the growing industrial base in Norwood. A connection was included to the Pennsylvania's Chicago-bound Richmond Branch, which the CL crossed over north of the yard. In Butler County, north of Brecon, the CL curved abruptly northeast onto the original line, partially graded in the 1850s between Sharonville and Lebanon. Just <b>beyond,</b> <b>it</b> began to descend slowly through Mason to Hageman, where it crossed the Middletown Branch, and then rose slightly, alongside Turtle Creek, to Lebanon. The Pennsylvania tore down the original Lebanon passenger station in 1960, replacing it (for freight purposes) with a smaller building from Kings Mills on the Little Miami Railroad. The Lebanon Council of Garden Clubs acquired the land in 1972, tore down the freight depot, and erected {{a replica of the}} old passenger depot in its place, with a gift shop inside.|$|E

5|$|Neptune's orbit has a {{profound}} impact on the region directly <b>beyond</b> <b>it,</b> known as the Kuiper belt. The Kuiper belt is a ring of small icy worlds, similar to the asteroid belt but far larger, extending from Neptune's orbit at 30AU out to about 55AU from the Sun. Much {{in the same way that}} Jupiter's gravity dominates the asteroid belt, shaping its structure, so Neptune's gravity dominates the Kuiper belt. Over the age of the Solar System, certain regions of the Kuiper belt became destabilised by Neptune's gravity, creating gaps in the Kuiper belt's structure.

The type locality, Lagoa Santa, lies far northeast of the nearest record of live L. molitor; there, it is known only from three skull fragments from a cave known as Laga da Escrivania Nr.5.

5|$|The A1 is {{the most}} recent {{in a series of}} routes north out of London to York and <b>beyond.</b> <b>It</b> was {{designated}} in 1921 by the Ministry of Transport under the Great Britain road numbering scheme, comprising existing roads and streets, mostly historic, and later using stretches of purpose-built new roads in what is now the outer London borough of Barnet.

The route closely follows the historic route of the Great North Road, though from 1954 it has diverted round the congested suburbs of Finchley and High Barnet along modern roads constructed in the 1920s and 1930s.|$|E
