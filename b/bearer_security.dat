50|$|In February 2015, UBS {{announced}} that it was being investigated by the Office of the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York and the Securities Exchange Commission over new allegations that UBS facilitated tax evasion by its U.S. clientele. The focus of the investigation is the possible sale of bearer bonds. Bearer bonds are a type of unregistered security that provide a degree of anonymity to the owner as they can be transferred anonymously when held in paper form, thus enabling tax evasion as such transfers would allow the owner to conceal their financial assets. Although the <b>bearer</b> <b>security</b> can be traded electronically (which would create an electronic record), when the security exited the system via a clearing house, the transaction would still essentially be anonymous unless a party actually sought the information.|$|E
50|$|Regulatory {{and fiscal}} {{authorities}} sometimes regard <b>bearer</b> <b>securities</b> negatively, {{as they may}} be used to facilitate the evasion of regulatory restrictions and tax. In the United Kingdom, for example, the issue of <b>bearer</b> <b>securities</b> was heavily restricted firstly by the Exchange Control Act 1947 until 1953. Bearer securities are very rare in the United States because of the negative tax implications they may have to the issuer and holder.|$|R
50|$|Each divided {{security}} {{constitutes a}} separate asset, which is legally distinct {{from each other}} security in the same issue. Pre-electronic <b>bearer</b> <b>securities</b> were divided. Each instrument constitutes the separate covenant of the issuer and is a separate debt.|$|R

50|$|To {{overcome}} the prohibition to issue currency (exclusive prerogative of the Bank of Italy), banks emitted real bank drafts made payable to cut small entities and companies already equipped their turn; in practice, as well <b>bearer</b> <b>securities,</b> were exchanged {{from hand to}} hand as if they were real currency.|$|R

6000|$|... (iv.) It {{is certain}} that since the Armistice {{there has been a}} great flight abroad of the foreign {{securities}} still remaining in private hands. This is exceedingly difficult to prevent. German foreign investments are as a rule in the form of <b>bearer</b> <b>securities</b> and are not registered. They are easily smuggled abroad across Germany's extensive land frontiers, and for some months before the conclusion of peace it was certain that their owners {{would not be allowed to}} retain them if the Allied Governments could discover any method of getting hold of them. These factors combined to stimulate human ingenuity, and the efforts both of the Allied and of the German Governments to interfere effectively with the outflow are believed to have been largely futile.|$|R

40|$|The {{practice}} of securities holding, transfer and collateral has significantly {{changed over the}} past 200 years – moving from paper certificates and issuer registers to an intermediated environment, {{and from there to}} computerisation and globalisation. These changes made transacting more efficient and thus rendered markets more liquid. However, the law has lagged behind and is now itself an obstacle to efficiency because international securities transactions are subject to considerable legal uncertainty. The latest global market development, a cryptographic transfer process commonly called ‘the blockchain’, is the most recent efficiency-enhancing change. It offers a unique possibility to create a consistent legal framework for securities from scratch, {{on the basis of a}} legal concept that to some extent resembles <b>bearer</b> <b>securities.</b> This paper shows what the new international legal framework could look like, in the light of experience gained from earlier developments...|$|R
50|$|The Court also {{addressed}} {{the question of}} where the situs of shares issued by a company is under the English conflict of laws. Sadly, the three judges (all of whom gave reasoned judgments) appeared to take different approaches; a majority seemed to be in favour of the historical rule preferred by Dicey & Morris - that shares should be deemed to be located where they can be dealt with, which in the case of registered shares will normally be the place of the share register - but there also appeared to be some support for the alternative line of authority in certain Canadian cases - that the shares should be deemed to be located in the jurisdiction where the company was incorporated. On {{the facts of the case}} both were the state of New York, and so the decision made little practical difference. The Court also confirmed that <b>bearer</b> <b>securities</b> are considered to be located in the place where the certificate is physically present under English law.|$|R
50|$|Dematerialisation {{involves}} {{dispensing with}} paper instruments and certificates altogether. Dematerialised securities exist {{only in the}} form of electronic records.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the future {{instrument}} is to promote legal certainty and economic efficiency {{with respect to the}} cross-border holding and disposition of securities held with an intermediary, by harmonising certain legal aspects in this regard. This has become a necessary venture due to the considerable change in market practices within the last 50 years, combined with an everincreasing volume of cross-border activities in the capital markets. It has been widely recognised in recent years that these developments in the practice of holding and disposition of securities have, in a number of respects, outrun the traditional legal framework. The basic rules on the legal nature, transfer and collateral provision of securities were formulated in the days when securities were transferred individually by physical delivery of certificates representing them. Under these rules, there was always a direct relationship between issuers and holders. In the case of registered securities, the investor’s name was always registered in the issuer’s books. In the case of <b>bearer</b> <b>securities,</b> the mere possession of a securities certificate represented or evidenced the direct property interest. The tokens were either physically held by the investors or under their names by an agent, for example a bank or a broker. Any type of transfer of the securities involved a direct or indirect possessory transfer and sometimes entailed the physical transfer of the tokens from one vault to another...|$|R
50|$|The UE (User Equipment) {{interface}} of the RAN (Radio Access Network) primarily {{consists of}} RRC (Radio Resource Control), PDCP (Packet Data Convergence Protocol), RLC (Radio Link Control) and MAC (Media Access Control) protocols. RRC protocol handles connection establishment, measurements, radio <b>bearer</b> services, <b>security</b> and handover decisions. RLC protocol primarily divides into three Modes—Transparent Mode (TM), Unacknowledge Mode (UM), Acknowledge Mode (AM). The functionality of AM entity resembles TCP operation whereas UM operation resembles UDP operation. In TM mode, {{data will be}} sent to lower layers without adding any header to SDU of higher layers. MAC handles the scheduling of data on air interface depending on higher layer (RRC) configured parameters.|$|R

5000|$|In {{a system}} that used paper {{certificates}} for securities, the doctrine of lex loci rei sitae ({{the law of the}} place of location of the securities) was applied to determine the validity of certain rights in or transfers of securities. In the case of <b>bearer</b> <b>securities,</b> this is taken to be the law of the jurisdiction where the certificates actually are (e.g., in a pledge, where the recipient of the collateral takes possession of the securities certificate at the time of transfer). In the case of registered securities, the lex loci rei sitae is either the law of the issuer's jurisdiction or the law of the jurisdiction where the securities records of the issuer or its official recordholder are located at the time of transfer. In a system in which securities are mostly held indirectly through brokers and banks (as discussed above) or in which securities are evidenced mainly on accounts (referred to as [...] "dematerialization") rather than by certificates, an alternative rule of [...] "the law of the relevant intermediary" [...] has come to be used. According to this rule, the law chosen in the account agreement with the financial institution that holds the account in which the securities are evidenced or the place where the office of the intermediary with which the account holder normally deals is the law used. This is the technique used in the Hague Convention on The Law Applicable to Certain Rights in Respect of Securities Held with an Intermediary, and also used in the Article 8, [...] "Investment Securities" [...] of the United States Uniform Commercial Code. The advantages of this rule for international financial transactions is that wherever securities are located or regardless of how many offices and branches a financial institution has, persons dealing in the securities can know the law that will govern a transaction such as a sale, a pledge or a loan of securities.|$|R

40|$|A random {{matching}} model with money {{is used to}} study the nominal yield on small denomination, <b>bearer,</b> safe, discount <b>securities</b> issued by the government. There is always one steady state with matured securities circulating at par and, for some parameters, another with them circulating at a discount. In the former, a necessary and sufficient condition for a positive nominal yield on not-yet-matured securities is exogenous discriminatory treatment of them by the government. In the latter, the post-maturity discount on securities induces a deeper pre-maturity discount even without such discriminatory treatment. Money; Securities...|$|R
40|$|MM - P&DMThis study {{examined}} the rationale for formulating a national security policy for Botswana. The study probed the various ways in which national security is conceptualised by different actors in Botswana. These range from key government officials with portfolio responsibilities linked to national security and to civil society representatives and academics {{in the area of}} political science and security studies. The study also investigated the various threats, past, present and future, to Botswana‟s national security. These are categorised into national security vulnerabilities and shortcomings in terms of territorial integrity and sovereignty, key institutions and actors, security policy instruments, strategic national interests and human security. The latter was also used as a framework to assess the country‟s strengths and achievements in the area of national security with a view to informing the advisability or its lack thereof, of formulating a national security policy. The key research question was whether or not Botswana needs to formulate a National Security Policy in order to better contain its national security vulnerabilities. The study carried out a series of in-depth interviews with key office <b>bearers</b> in Botswana‟s <b>security</b> sector and a focus group discussion with members of various non-governmental organisations in Botswana. These interviews were both structured and unstructured. It also involved a content analysis of policy reports, documents and media reports involving decisions with a bearing on the country‟s national security. The study then compared information obtained in the interviews to what was found in the literature about national security policies. A key finding in this research is {{the fact that there is}} no commonly known and owned concept of national security in Botswana. Security means different things to different people depending on who one is talking to. Botswana is also confronted with many threats to its national security. These range from violent crime, poaching, espionage, HIV/AIDS, Foot and Mouth disease to illegal cross border traffic and a large number of illegal immigrants to mention a few. The country has many institutions in its security sector. The problem is that they are not well coordinated with clearly defined roles. The result has therefore been turf wars, imbalances in resource allocations and institutional jealousies which have resulted in a situation where institutions work and talk past each other. 13 The security policy environment in Botswana is also characterised by many pieces of legislation rather than clearly thought out and expressed, codified policy documents providing guidance and legitimacy for security policy decision making in the country. What the country has on the ground at present is ad-hoc and disjointed. Security related decisions are taken in a policy vacuum especially in the face of crisis. The absence of a codified foreign and security policy has also meant that the country has failed to clearly define its national interests and values in order for it to allocate appropriate resources towards realising them. This state of affairs has the potential of putting the country at risk with its neighbours who may view it with suspicion as it has inadequate confidence building measures in place to underpin its foreign and security policy. A key finding of this study has also been the need to premise the country‟s national security policy on the concept of human security which identifies the individual as the referent object of security and not the state. The study also raised a need for the government to begin to include more institutions on its national security radar screen in line with the agenda of security sector governance and reform. The study commended the government of Botswana for its efforts at formulating a national security strategy without being pushed by donors or a history of conflict as is the case in many countries in post-conflict situations. At the end, the study argues the case for Botswana to embark on a security sector reform drive which will result in a clear, codified national security policy and strategy which stipulates how the policy goals are to be met. The study contributes to the steadily growing research on Botswana‟s National Security Policy by offering a sector-wide approach encompassing all key institutions and actors in the country‟s security sector, as opposed to previous researches which were biased towards law enforcement and defence. This research hopes to contribute to and provide guidance to the process of formulating policy propositions on the theory, practice, and teaching of Security Studies, Civil – Military Relations, Security Sector Governance and Public Policy Analysis in Botswana. It also contributes to enhancing the processes of security policy decision making and formulation in Botswana...|$|R
