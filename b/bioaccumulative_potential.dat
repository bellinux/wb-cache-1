50|$|A large Canadian {{study from}} 2002 (funded by automakers, {{who are against}} its use) {{concluded}} that MMT impairs the effectiveness of automobile emission controls and increases pollution from motor vehicles. However, a later study by the Canadian government found that “no Notice of Defect {{was found to be}} potentially caused by MMT.” Many studies have been undertaken over time that confirmed the use of mmt is compatible with vehicles and safe for human health and the environment. In particular, a 2013 risk assessment on MMT was undertaken by ARCADIS Consulting, following a methodology developed by the European Commission. This risk assessment was verified by an independent panel and found by the EU Commission to be compliant with their methodology. It concluded that “when MMT is used as a fuel additive in petrol, no significant human health or environmental concerns related to exposure to either MMT or its transformation combustion products (manganese phosphate, manganese sulphate and manganese tetroxide) were identified even in locations where mmt is approved for use at levels up to 18 mg Mn/l.” As stated by Health Canada in their risk assessment on the widespread use of MMT in Canadian gasoline, “all analyses indicate that the combustion products of MMT in gasoline do not represent an added health risk to the Canadian population” MMT is manufactured by reduction of bis(methylcyclopentadienyl) manganese using triethylaluminium. The reduction is conducted under an atmosphere of carbon monoxide.MMT is a so-called half-sandwich compound, or more specifically a piano-stool complex (since the three CO ligands are like the legs of a piano stool). The manganese atom in MMT is coordinated with three carbonyl groups {{as well as to the}} methylcyclopentadienyl ring. These hydrophobic organic ligands make MMT highly lipophilic, which may increase bioaccumulation. While the structure of mmt suggests lipophilicity and potential to bioaccumulate, comparison of bioconcentration factors (BCF) reported for plant and animal species in comparison to regulatory-based cutoffs (i.e., US EPA and EU REACH) indicates a low <b>bioaccumulative</b> <b>potential</b> of mmt. Figures 2 and 3 of the study (pages 182 & 184) shows the BCF plotted against time and illustrates the potential BCF of mmt. From these figures, the upper curve (A) demonstrates the 9-day mmt BCF plateauing at approximately 400 in plants and 200 in fish, with both values well below the Bioaccumulative/very Bioaccumulative (B/vB) thresholds of US EPA, EU REACH and Environment & Climate Change Canada. A variety of related complexes are known, including ferrocene, which is also under consideration as an additive to gasoline.|$|E

Here, novel 3, 4 -propylenedioxythiophene (ProDOT) monomers containing a branched perfluorocarbon chain or a linear perfluorocarbon chain with {{the same number of}} C-F bonds are synthesized and used to produce superhydrophobic films by electropolymerization. The branching induces higher steric hindrance during electropolymerization, which reduces the mean polymer backbone length, decreases the polymer electrical conductivity and changes the surface morphology. Here, we show that these changes can be beneficial in the case of super-liquid repellent properties. Indeed, superhydrophobic properties are obtained with linear and branched perfluorocarbon chains. However, while superoleophilic properties are obtained with both linear perfluorocarbon chains, much higher oleophobic properties are obtained with branched perfluorocarbon chains. Here, the differences are due to changes in the surface morphology and roughness. This work open new strategies to obtain surfaces with high hydrophobicity and oleophobicity...|$|R

We used a generic physiologically-based toxicokinetic (PBTK) model that based on in vitro human liver metabolism data, minimal renal excretion and a constant exposure was able to assess the <b>bioaccumulative</b> <b>potential</b> of a chemical.

Our model, based on a 100 % intestinal absorption assumption, suggests that metabolic clearance, plasma protein-binding properties and renal excretion are the main factors in determining if bioaccumulation will occur and its amount. It is essential that in vitro metabolic clearance tests with metabolic competent cell lines as well as plasma protein binding assays be performed for suspected bioaccumulative compounds...|$|E

40|$|Biotransformation is an {{important}} factor in determining the extent that chemicals bioaccumulate. Since most anthropogenic chemicals lack data on biotransformation, this research used rainbow trout isolated hepatocytes to determine the depletion rates of several hydrophobic chemicals (benzo(a) pyrene, chrysene, 9 -methylanthracene, polychlorinatedbiphenyl- 153). These results were extrapolated to the organism level and bioconcentration factors (BCFs) modelled. Since concurrent chemical exposure and temperature modify biotransformation, they were investigated for effects on modelled BCF values. Depletion rate constants were generally lower for chemical mixture than for individual incubations. At acclimation temperatures, chrysene biotransformation exhibited thermal compensation; for benzo(a) pyrene and 9 -methylanthracene, lower acclimation temperature resulted in lower rate constants and increased BCFs. Acute temperature increases significantly increased depletion rate constants for benzo(a) pyrene and chrysene, and decreased BCF values. Acute temperature decreases had no effect.

The potential associations between in utero exposure to ΣPCBs (pmol/ml), Σdioxin like-(DL) PCBs (PCB- 118 and - 156) (pmol/ml), and p,p'-DDE and semen quality and reproductive hormone levels were investigated using multiple regression.

Results suggested that in utero exposure to ΣPCB, ΣDL-PCB, and p,p'-DDE was not statistically significantly associated with semen quality measures or reproductive hormone levels.

Zinc and Cu were found at the highest concentration in complete dairy (total mixed and aggregated component) rations and reflected the deliberate addition of these metals to meet animal nutrient requirements although more than half the farms fed Cu and Zn above US recommended levels. Concentrations of Cr, As, Cd, and Pb were present in much lower concentrations and decreased in the order Cr>As>Pb>Cd. No complete Wisconsin dairy ration contained heavy metal concentrations above US maximum acceptable concentrations and would be unlikely to induce any toxic effects in dairy cattle. Concentrations of Cd in complete dairy rations were closest to US maximum acceptable concentrations, suggesting the greatest potential long-term risk to exceed US maximum acceptable concentrations if whole farm levels of Cd were to increase in the future. With the exception of Pb, the main sources of Zn, Cu, Cr, As, and Cd in the complete dairy feed ration originated from imported feed. The continued importation of heavy metals in dairy feed is likely to be associated with accumulation of these metals in soils where manure is applied. Although the cycling of many heavy metals through the dairy food chain will be limited by factors such as a soil's cation exchange capacity, pH, salinity, and phytotoxicity of the metal, these may be less limiting for Cd.

These nanostructures display parahygrophobic properties (apparent contact angle θ > θY for various liquid probes, where θY is the Young angle of the corresponding smooth surface) with an extremely high liquid adhesion. These properties are due to the presence of nanoporosity between the nanosheets, which favours the Cassie-–Baxter state but with high adhesion due to an important contact between the nanosheets and the liquids. These results are extremely important also in a theoretical point of view in the aim to study surfaces with high contact angles and high adhesion.

Fig.  2), starting from a critical literature review through pioneering laboratory scale studies over assay standardization and repeatability evaluation, to a technology that is mature for regulatory acceptance. It is important to highlight that the in vitro biotransformation assays are not intended as a full replacement of the in vivo OECD 305 test [108], but as part of a tiered weight-of evidence approach to bioaccumulation assessment [90]. In a first tier, in silico methods would identify those compounds which are unlikely to show significant bioaccumulation based on their physicochemical properties; this step sorts out already a substantial amount of chemicals resulting in a reduction of testing needs [101]. In a next step, the in vitro biotransformation assays can deliver information whether the compound is likely to be metabolized by fish and at which rates. The in vitro values are then extrapolated by appropriate models to predict in vivo BCF values. In this scenario, the utilization of the in vivo fish bioconcentration test would only be applied in doubtful cases when the <b>bioaccumulative</b> <b>potential</b> of the test chemical cannot be unequivocally classified by the in silico and in vitro methods.|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} to bioconcentrate {{is generally considered}} to be an unwanted property of a substance. Consequently, chemical legislation, including the European REACH regulations, requires the chemical industry to provide bioconcentration data for chemicals that are produced or imported at volumes exceeding 100 tons per annum or if there is a concern that a substance is persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic. For the filling of the existing data gap for chemicals produced or imported at levels that are below this stipulated volume, without the need for additional animal experiments, physiologically-based toxicokinetic (PBTK) models can be used to predict whole-body and tissue concentrations of neutral organic chemicals in fish. PBTK models have been developed for many different fish species with promising results. In this study, we developed PBTK models for zebrafish (Danio rerio) and roach (Rutilus rutilus) and combined them with existing models for rainbow trout (Onchorhynchus mykiss), lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush), and fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas). The resulting multispecies model framework allows for cross-species extrapolation of the <b>bioaccumulative</b> <b>potential</b> of neutral organic compounds.

The PTB properties and PTB criteria can be used for simplified hazard identification for human health and the environment. A substance-specific PTB profile can thus be derived to include the PTB properties. Comparing PTB properties to 'cut-off' values for substances in relation to a particular policy aim can result in categorization of substances into a PTB class. The establishment of 'cut-off' values is a policy choice still under discussion, as is the use of PTB criteria for policy purposes, both are therefore outside the scope of the report...|$|E
40|$|The {{exposure}} pathways of perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) {{to humans}} {{are still not}} clear because of the complex living environment, and few studies have simultaneously investigated the bioaccumulative behaviour of different PFAAs in humans. In this study, serum, dust, duplicate diet, and other matrices were collected around a manufacturing plant in China, and homologous series of PFAAs were analysed. PFAA levels in dust and serum of local residents in this area were considerably higher than those in non-polluted area. Although dietary intake was the major exposure pathway in the present study, dust ingestion {{played an important role}} in this case. Serum PFAAs in local residents was significantly correlated with dust PFAAs levels in their living or working microenvironment. Serum PFAAs and dust PFAAs were significantly higher in family members of occupational workers (FM) than in ordinary residents (OR) (p< 0. 01). After a careful analysis of the PFAAs exposure pathway, a potential pathway in addition to direct dust ingestion was suggested: PFAAs might transferred from occupational worker&# 39;s clothes to dinners via cooking processes. The <b>bioaccumulative</b> <b>potential</b> of PFHxS and PFOS were higher than other PFAAs, which suggested a substantial difference between the bioaccumulative ability of perfluorinated sulfonic acids and perfluorinated carboxylic acids...|$|E
40|$|Within {{the context}} of current {{international}} initiatives on the control of persistent organic pollutants (POPs), an overview is given of the scientific knowledge relating to POP sources, emissions, transport, fate and effects. At the regional scale, improvements in mass balance models for well-characterised POPs are resulting in an ability to estimate their environmental concentrations with sufficient accuracy to be of help for some regulatory purposes. The relevance of the parameters used to define POPs within these international initiatives is considered {{with an emphasis on}} mechanisms for adding new substances to the initial lists. A tiered approach is proposed for screening the large number of untested chemical substances according to their long-range transport potential, persistence and <b>bioaccumulative</b> <b>potential</b> prior to more detailed risk assessments. The importance of testing candidate POPs for chronic toxicity (i. e. for immunotoxicity, endocrine disruption and carcinogenicity) is emphasised as is a need for the further development of relevant SAR (structure activity relationship) models and in vitro and in vivo tests for these effects. Where there is a high level of uncertainty at the risk assessment stage, decision-makers may have to rely on expert judgement and weight-of-evidence, taking into account the precautionary principle and the views of relevant stake-holders. Close co-operation between the various international initiatives on POPs will be required to ensure that assessment criteria and procedures are as compatible as possible.

40|$|International audienceDue to the {{extremely}} {{low surface tension}} of oils, the elaboration of superoleophobic surfaces implies the development of well-defined strategies to impede their tendency to spread. Usually, these strategies combine the presence of re-entrant structures (overhang, mushroom-like, T-like structures, etc.) with perfluorinated compounds containing long perfluorinated tails. Due to the toxicity (<b>bioaccumulative</b> <b>potential)</b> of long perfluorinated tails, our strategy is to develop superoleophobic properties with short perfluorinated tails (perfluorobutyl or F-butyl). However, almost all our strategies failed because of their much lower intrinsic oleophobicity. Here, we show the possibility to reach superoleophobic properties by electrodeposition of original fluorinated (F-butyl, F-hexyl and F-octyl) 3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene derivatives containing an amide connector. Surprisingly, if superhydrophobic properties are obtained whatever the fluorinated chain length, superoleophobic properties are only obtained with F-butyl tails (contact angle sunflower oil = 150. 0 ° and contact angle hexadecane = 132. 1 °). Here, the fibers, only obtained with F-butyl chains, have a much higher tendency to repel oils than spherical particles. It seems {{that the presence of}} nanofibrils (re-entrant structures) and amide connectors allow the stabilization of the Cassie-Baxter state (fakir state) to be increased with oil droplets, which makes it possible to reach a state close to the Cassie- Baxter state with a polymer containing F-butyl tails. We think that the amide connectors increase the presence of the F-butyl tails at the extreme surface by reducing their mobility...|$|E

These compounds {{have been found to}} persist in the environment and potentially promote detrimental biological effects. The lack of research on bioaccumulation and bioconcentration and especially dietary transfer on aquatic life has resulted in challenges in assessing ecological risks. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the potential trophic transfer of the explosive compounds 2, 4, 6 -trinitrotoluene (TNT) and hexahydro- 1, 3, 5 -trinitro- 1, 3, 5 -triazine (RDX) using a realistic freshwater prey/predator model and using dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), a highly bioaccumulative compound, to establish relative dietary uptake potential. The oligochaete worm Lumbriculus variegatus was exposed to 14 C-labeled TNT, RDX or DDT for 5 hours in water, frozen in meal-size packages and subsequently fed to individual juvenile fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas). Fish were sampled for body residue determination on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 14 following an 8 -hour gut purging period. Extensive metabolism of the parent compound in worms occurred for TNT but not for RDX and DDT. Fish body residue remained relatively unchanged over time for TNT and RDX, but did not approach steady-state concentration for DDT during the exposure period. The bioaccumulation factor (concentration in fish relative to concentration in worms) was 0. 018, 0. 010, and 0. 422 g/g for TNT, RDX and DDT, respectively, confirming the expected relatively low <b>bioaccumulative</b> <b>potential</b> for TNT and RDX throug...|$|E
40|$|International audienceTo obtain superoleophobic properties, {{fluorinated}} compounds are necessary {{but they are}} toxic due to their <b>bioaccumulative</b> <b>potential.</b> This is why, in this article, we investigate superoleophobic materials with minimal fluorinated functions. The strategy used is to associate fluorinated monomer with hydrocarbon monomer, both having the same core (EDOP) {{in order to have}} the same oxidation potential for the electrodeposition. Smooth and rough copolymers are produced by the electrodeposition method controlling the deposition charge. In this article, we present the static and dynamic wettability properties of these copolymers with different proportions of fluorinated monomer with water (probe liquid for superhydrophobicity), sunflower oil, hexadecane, dodecane and octane (probe liquids of various surface tension for superoleophobicity) using scanning electron microscopy and optical profilometry. The study of wettability properties of smooth and rough copolymers also permits the determination of their intrinsic hydrophobicity/oleophobicity and to separate the effect of the chemical part from the physical one in the static contact angles. In this article, we show that EDOP-F 8 proportion above about 75 % is sufficient to obtain wettability properties close to PEDOP-F 8 homopolymer, which has exceptional properties with water, sunflower oil and hexadecane. These performances are due to surface nanoporosities promoted by the presence of fluorinated functions. Moreover, the production of smooth copolymers reveals the effect of the chemical part from the physical one in the static contact angles. The chemical part represented between 57 % and 74 % following the EDOP-F 8 fraction for water, about 55 % for sunflower oil and about 44 % for hexadecan...|$|E

40|$|International audienceTo {{enlarge the}} {{possibilities}} of using organisms of the soil fauna to assess the <b>bioaccumulative</b> <b>potential</b> of chemicals, the kinetic of soil cadmium (Cd) transfer to the terrestrial gastropod Helix aspersa was investigated under laboratory conditions during a long-term experiment (6 months). During the exposure phase (3 months), juvenile snails were subjected to three different concentrations of Cd spiked in artificial ISO soil (ISO 0, 20 and 100 mg Cd kg(- 1)) and to a field soil (ME 4) industrially contaminated by 20 mg Cd kg (- 1). For both soils, internal steady-state Cd concentrations were reached in the viscera of the snails, the main storage organ for Cd, after 2 weeks of exposure whatever the Cd concentration in soil. The equilibrium concentrations in the viscera were 0. 7 (+/- 0. 1), 11. 3 (+/- 2. 4), 73. 3 (+/- 4. 8) and 6. 3 (+/- 1. 3) mg Cd kg(- 1) dry mass for ISO 0, ISO 20, ISO 100 and ME 4, respectively. During the depuration phase (3 months), from 0 to 52 % of the accumulated Cd in the viscera were removed by excretion or relocation in the foot. However, the snails {{were not able to}} depurate down to initial concentrations. Data were modelled by integrating a specific growth rate constant into one-compartment toxicokinetic models. This allowed the calculation of Cd uptake rates that can be used as indicators of metal bioavailability. Since this parameter was found to be lower for snails exposed to the field soil ME 4, we concluded that lower Cd bioavailability in this field soil was responsible of the lower transfer to the snails compared to the ISO 20 soil, even though they were polluted to similar extents. Internal validation showed that the toxicokinetic models could be applied for predictive purposes, promising {{for the development of a}} bioaccumulation directive for terrestrial environment...|$|E
30|$|OW-based (Q)SARs {{or other}} models. Since in silico BCF models often neglect the {{contribution}} of fish metabolism as a clearance mechanism, they might overestimate the <b>bioaccumulative</b> <b>potential</b> of a chemical and, as a consequence, trigger unnecessary in vivo tests. Inclusion of biotransformation rates would enhance {{the reliability of the}} in silico models for BCF prediction. Marlies Halder, EC DG JRC, Ispra, presented a summary on current investigations in this field including an in vitro approach using rainbow trout S 9 liver fractions [17, 18] or rainbow trout hepatocytes [19]. Accumulation of a chemical in an organism is the result of several physiological processes, namely absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME). The in vitro approaches aim at determining loss of substance via metabolism, and use a model to extrapolate from in vitro to whole body transformation rates [19]. This is useful information which adds to the overall picture of bioaccumulation. Some regulations, e.g., REACH [3], expressively consider all available data (weight of evidence approach). In vitro test on metabolic rates can be used to predict “baseline” BCF and thus seem to be very useful for screening chemicals for bioaccumulative properties. However, so far the in vitro approaches may only be used as supportive data in assessment given the limited experience with these in vitro systems at present. In order to facilitate broad regulatory use of these in vitro methods, standardised protocols and evidence of their validity are needed. Arnot et al. [20] made a first step by developing and applying methods to provide guidance in the selection of whole-body in vivo metabolic biotransformation rate constants and to explore some factors that may contribute to observed differences in metabolic rates, such as chemical structure and fish species. A multi-laboratory ring trial coordinated by the ILSI-HESI Bioaccumulation Committee is currently carried out to assess the reliability, transferability, and predictive value of two in vitro systems using either rainbow trout S 9 liver fractions or cryopreserved rainbow trout hepatocytes as in vitro systems.|$|E
