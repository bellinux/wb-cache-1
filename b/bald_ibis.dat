5|$|The first {{member of}} the genus to be {{described}} was the red-billed chough, named as Upupa pyrrhocorax by Linnaeus in his Systema Naturae in 1758. His genus Upupa contained species that had a long curved bill and a short blunt tongue. These included the northern <b>bald</b> <b>ibis</b> and the hoopoe, birds now known to be completely unrelated to the choughs.|$|E

50|$|Geronticus {{contains}} two living species. The northern <b>bald</b> <b>ibis</b> (G. eremita) has a neck crest of elongated feathers. It is a Critically Endangered species found around the Mediterranean. Its range had expanded {{after the last}} glacial period to the Alps of Germany and even a bit further north, but it was rendered extinct there mainly due to habitat destruction and unsustainable hunting. The southern <b>bald</b> <b>ibis</b> (G. calvus) with a red crown patch but no crest is classified as Vulnerable and is found in subtropical southern Africa.|$|E
5000|$|Zenobia, {{a female}} {{northern}} <b>bald</b> <b>ibis,</b> {{was named for}} Zenobia, a 3rd-century Queen of the Palmyrene Empire. She is an adult who has nested with her male companion Odeinat.|$|E
50|$|Founded 22 September 1962 by the Austrian {{zoologist}} Hans Psenner, Alpenzoo {{became famous}} because of reintroduction {{of endangered species}} like bearded vulture, Alpine ibex, and northern <b>bald</b> <b>ibis</b> in the wild.|$|E
50|$|Geronticus apelex is {{apparently}} the direct ancestor {{of the southern}} <b>bald</b> <b>ibis.</b> Its remains were found in Early Pliocene deposits near Langebaanweg, South Africa, which date back about five million years.|$|E
50|$|The {{northern}} <b>bald</b> <b>ibis</b> {{is readily}} distinguished from its close relative, the southern <b>bald</b> <b>ibis</b> of Southern Africa, {{by the southern}} species' whitish face. The northern bald can also {{be confused with the}} similarly dark-plumaged glossy ibis, which overlaps its range, but it is larger and stockier than that species. In flight, when the bill and face colouration may not be visible, the bald ibis' less rounded wings and shorter neck give it a different profile from glossy ibis, and its relatively short legs mean that its feet do not project beyond the tail, unlike those of the glossy ibis.|$|E
50|$|In {{his work}} on birds he {{describes}} the wood-crow (northern <b>bald</b> <b>ibis)</b> from a stuffed specimen, being probably the last description of this bird made while the species was still extant in Europe.|$|E
50|$|A decree {{promulgated by}} Archbishop Leonhard in 1504 {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} actions in Europe to officially protect threatened animal species, including the northern <b>bald</b> <b>ibis,</b> which nevertheless became extinct in Central Europe.|$|E
50|$|The {{northern}} <b>bald</b> <b>ibis</b> {{lives for}} an average of 20 to 25 years in captivity (oldest recorded male 37 years, oldest recorded female 30 years). The average age in the wild has been estimated as 10 to 15 years.|$|E
50|$|The {{northern}} <b>bald</b> <b>ibis</b> used to nest {{here and}} {{winter in the}} deserts of Arabia, up to 1,000 pairs in the 1960s. Now a few dozen birds remain and these no longer migrate but remain protected year-round in Birecik.|$|E
50|$|The {{northern}} <b>bald</b> <b>ibis</b> {{was thought}} to be extinct in the Middle East until about 2005, when seven of the birds were spotted nesting near Palmyra. However, by 2012 the Palmyra population had declined to four, of which Zenobia is one.|$|E
50|$|Several {{countries}} have produced postage stamps which depict the northern <b>bald</b> <b>ibis.</b> They include Algeria, Morocco, Sudan, Syria, Turkey, and Yemen, which are breeding or migration locations; Austria, which {{is seeking to}} reintroduce the bird; and Jersey, which has a small captive population.|$|E
50|$|The {{southern}} <b>bald</b> <b>ibis</b> (Geronticus calvus) is {{an uncommon}} bird endemic to the highlands {{of the southern}} African region. In South Africa, the speciesâ€™ total breeding population is estimated around 4 600 birds. However, {{little is known about}} the biology of this species.|$|E
50|$|The {{southern}} <b>bald</b> <b>ibis</b> {{is part of}} {{the genus}} Geronticus, which includes two distinct species. The southern <b>bald</b> <b>ibis</b> (Geronticus calvus) is restricted primarily to the southern regions of Africa whereas its counterpart, the waldrapp (Geronticus eremita) is found in the northern regions of the continent. Both species share common characteristics regardless of their geographic separation. Both species nest on rock cliffs and display distinct breeding behaviours adapted for their particular locations. Similarly, they both show evolutionary adaptations in foraging behaviours due to their dry habitats. The separation between these two species is believed to have occurred relatively recently. This separation, between G. calvus and G. eremita, is believed to have occurred only 335 000 to 1 million years ago.|$|E
50|$|The park is {{threatened}} by increasing pressures of the growing human population {{and the construction of}} summer chalets is increasing around Aglou. A large-scale hotel development planned for the coast at Tifnit, an area that includes important feeding areas for the <b>bald</b> <b>ibis,</b> has been suspended.|$|E
50|$|Herodotus {{wrote of}} the man-eating Stymphalian birds, which had wings of brass and sharp {{metallic}} feathers they could fire at their victims. Ridding Lake Stymphalia in Arcadia of these creatures {{was one of the}} twelve labours of Heracles. These mythical birds are sometimes considered {{to be based on the}} northern <b>bald</b> <b>ibis,</b> but since they were described as marsh birds, and usually depicted without crests, the legendary species is more likely to be derived from the sacred ibis. Some depictions, such as the 6th-century BC Athenian black-figure amphora in the British Museum, clearly show the black head and white body of the sacred ibis. After the <b>bald</b> <b>ibis</b> became extinct in Central Europe, some later writers thought that Gesner's description was one of several in his book depicting mythical creatures.|$|E
50|$|Birds {{associated}} with flowering plants {{of the higher}} slopes include Gurney's sugarbird and malachite sunbird. A breeding colony of <b>bald</b> <b>ibis</b> occurs in the grassy uplands, besides small numbers of cape eagle-owl and red-breasted sparrowhawk. Forest birds include crowned eagle, Knysna lourie, cinnamon dove, olive bushshrike, green twinspot and wood owl.|$|E
50|$|According {{to local}} legend in the Birecik area, the {{northern}} <b>bald</b> <b>ibis</b> {{was one of}} the first birds that Noah released from the Ark as a symbol of fertility, and a lingering religious sentiment in Turkey helped the colonies there to survive long after the demise of the species in Europe.|$|E
50|$|Since 1998, SEO/BirdLife {{has also}} {{implemented}} an international programme in a North Africa and Latin America. The main focus as of 2008 is Morocco, carrying out different projects, mainly in wetlands. It {{is involved in}} monitoring the critically endangered northern <b>bald</b> <b>ibis</b> in its Moroccan stronghold in the Souss-Massa National Park.|$|E
50|$|The {{southern}} <b>bald</b> <b>ibis</b> {{is currently}} listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. However, {{there is no}} immediate threat of the species going extinct. The bird is also listed in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), signifying that the trade of this species is substantially regulated.|$|E
50|$|Unlike other ibises, which nest {{in trees}} and feed in wetlands, the {{northern}} <b>bald</b> <b>ibis</b> breeds on undisturbed cliff ledges, and forages for food in irregularly cultivated, grazed dry {{areas such as}} semi-arid steppes, and fallow fields. The close proximity of adequate steppe feeding areas to breeding cliffs is an important habitat requirement.|$|E
