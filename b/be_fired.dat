5|$|The M4 was {{developed}} to meet the need for a specialized mortar carrier based on the M2 Half Track Car, which the M21 soon replaced. The initial M4 was designed to carry a mortar. In emergencies, the mortar could <b>be</b> <b>fired</b> from the vehicle. The improved M4A1 had a reinforced floor so that the mortar could <b>be</b> <b>fired</b> from the vehicle, but the mounting faced to the rear and lacked traverse. This caused problems when the troops who operated the mortar mounted the vehicle, so the US 2nd Armored Division relocated the mortars so that they could fire from the front.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fires</b> <b>are</b> regular {{features}} in Burrabazar. In January 2000, rows of shops were gutted at Manohar Das Katra. In December 2002, there <b>was</b> <b>fire</b> in the wholesale market of woollen goods. In April 2003, fire struck Satyanarayan Park AC market. In September 2004 there <b>was</b> <b>fire</b> in a sari shop in Hari Ram Goenka Street. In July 2005, there <b>was</b> <b>fire</b> at a hosiery warehouse, off Kalakar Street.

5|$|Based on the M-13, the M-30 rocket was {{developed}} in 1942. Its bulbous warhead required it to <b>be</b> <b>fired</b> from a grounded frame, called the M-30 (single frame, four round; later double frame, 8 round), instead of a launch rail mounted on a truck. In 1944 it {{became the basis for}} the BM-31-12 truck-mounted launcher.|$|E
5|$|Bud Carson was Tech's {{defensive}} coordinator in 1966. His {{job was to}} appease the massive Tech fan base Bobby Dodd had accumulated. Carson was not the charismatic leader like Dodd but rather a strategy man that enjoyed intense game planning. Carson's most notable achievements included recruiting Tech's first ever African American scholarship athlete and being the first Tech head coach to <b>be</b> <b>fired.</b>|$|E
5|$|By January 1957, {{with the}} tests just months away, a {{tentative}} schedule had emerged. Short Granite would <b>be</b> <b>fired</b> first. Green Bamboo would follow if Short Granite was unsuccessful, but be omitted as unnecessary otherwise. Orange Herald (small) would <b>be</b> <b>fired</b> next. Because Short Granite was {{too large to}} fit into a missile or guided bomb, this would occur whether or not Short Granite was a success. Finally, Green Granite would be tested. In December 1956, Cook had proposed another design, known as Green Granite II. This was smaller than Green Granite I, and could fit into a Yellow Sun casing that could be used by the Blue Steel guided missile then under development; but it could not be made ready to reach Christmas Island before 26 June 1957, and extending Operation Grapple would cost another Â£1.5 million.|$|E

America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm) {{defeated}} Team 3D (Brother Devon and Brother Ray) to retain the NWA World Tag Team Championship at the show. On the undercard, Sean Waltman fought Raven in a No Disqualification match with the stipulation that if Raven lost, he would <b>be</b> <b>fired</b> from TNA. Waltman won the encounter, causing Raven to <b>be</b> <b>fired</b> from TNA in the storyline.|$|E
5|$|As well as copper, a new {{substance}} was found, extracted and exploited: this was variously called wad, black lead, plumbago or black cauke, {{and is now}} known as graphite. Many uses were quickly discovered for the mineral: it reduced friction in machinery, made a heat-resistant glaze for crucibles, and when used to line moulds for cannonballs, resulted in rounder, smoother balls that could <b>be</b> <b>fired</b> further by English naval cannon. Later, from {{the second half of the}} 18th century, it was used to make pencils, for which Keswick became famous.|$|E

25|$|Two bullet casings {{were found}} by a {{civilian}} under {{a police car}} after it was driven away. The casings found suggested that only two shots <b>were</b> <b>fired</b> at the motorcade.

5|$|Brocius waived the {{preliminary}} hearing so he and his case could be immediately transferred to Tucson. Wyatt and a deputy took Brocius in a wagon {{the next day to}} Tucson to stand trial, possibly saving him from being lynched. Wyatt testified that he thought the shooting was accidental. It was also demonstrated that Brocius' pistol could <b>be</b> <b>fired</b> from half-cock. Fred White left a statement before he died two days later that the shooting was not intentional. Based on the evidence presented, Brocius was not charged with White's death.|$|E
5|$|Despite being {{designed}} to fire at trajectories with a steep angle of descent, howitzers can <b>be</b> <b>fired</b> directly, {{as was done}} by the 11th Marine Regiment at the Battle of Chosin Reservoir, during the Korean War. Two field batteries fired directly upon a battalion of Chinese infantry; the Marines were forced to brace themselves against their howitzers, as they had no time to dig them in. The Chinese infantry took heavy casualties, and were forced to retreat.|$|E
5|$|Director of {{photography}} Mark Irwin was fired during filming of Screams finale, {{a week before}} principal photography was to be completed. Upon review of the dailies, Craven found the footage was out of focus and unusable. Irwin was initially ordered to fire his camera crew. He retorted that if his crew were to <b>be</b> <b>fired,</b> they {{would also have to}} fire him. The producers fired him and replaced him with Peter Deming, who finished the film.|$|E
50|$|Overglaze {{colors are}} {{low-temperature}} glazes that give ceramics a more decorative, glassy look. A piece <b>is</b> <b>fired</b> first, this initial firing {{being called the}} glost firing, then the overglaze decoration is applied, and it <b>is</b> <b>fired</b> again. Once the piece <b>is</b> <b>fired</b> and {{comes out of the}} kiln, its texture becomes smoother because of the glaze.|$|R

Marge does not disclose the entire truth of the house she sells to Ned Flanders and his family, which had been the site of a multiple homicide. The Flanders purchase the house and bid farewell to the Simpsons.|$|E
5|$|Flaming arrows {{required}} the shooter to get {{quite close to}} their desired target and most will have extinguished themselves before reaching the target. In response, another form of fire arrow was developed which consisted of curved metal bars connecting a tip and hollow end for the shaft. The resulting cage was filled with hot coals or other solid object which could <b>be</b> <b>fired</b> from a much stronger bow or ballista without fear of extinguishing and {{would be used to}} ignite straw or thatch roofs from a safer distance.|$|E
5|$|Following Against All Odds, Team 3D {{were forced}} to weigh in before each contest, which created a feud with the team of Curry Man and Shark Boy, leading to a Fish Market Street Fight between the two teams, with the {{stipulation}} that if Team 3D could not make weight they would <b>be</b> <b>fired</b> from TNA. At the event, Management Director Jim Cornette announced that if Team 3D made weight that night {{they would not have}} to abide by a weight restriction henceforth. Team 3D marked in below the mark prior to the contest; however eventually lost the encounter.|$|E

5|$|It was determined, however, {{that both}} crewmembers aboard the Marine F-4B could {{have survived the}} collision. Further {{investigation}} by the NTSB revealed a design flaw in the ejector seat and canopy assemblies of the fighter plane whereby the pilot would probably {{not be able to}} eject if the radar intercept officer ejected first. Since the specific design of ejector seats installed in the F-4B were not intended to <b>be</b> <b>fired</b> through the aircraft's canopy, a circuit breaker kept the seat from ejecting if the canopy was in place. Once the canopy was manually unlocked, the ejector seat circuit was completed and could <b>be</b> <b>fired.</b> This specific design of ejector seat, however, had a tendency of being unable to complete the circuit in the pilot's ejector seat if the aft ejector seat was fired first. The F-4B aircraft {{were in the process of}} being modified with a newly designed canopy when the collision occurred. Aircraft based at MCAS El Toro were slated to begin upgrades in July 1971; at the time of the collision, BuNo 151458 was still operating with the original canopy configuration, and the pilot was consequently unable to eject from the aircraft.|$|E
