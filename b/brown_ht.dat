40|$|AbstractIn this study, trace {{amounts of}} <b>Brown</b> <b>HT</b> were extracted, pre-concentrated and {{determined}} by cloud point extraction-scanometry (CPE-scanometry) as a simple, fast and inexpensive method. The procedure {{is based on}} CPE of <b>Brown</b> <b>HT</b> from an aqueous solution, diluting the extracted surfactant-rich phase with ethanol to 500 μL, transferring the appropriate volume to Plexiglas® cells and scanning the cells. Then, the colour of each cell was analyzed by software written in visual basic (VB 6) into red, green and blue values. Effective parameters for the extraction efficiency, such as the pH of the system, the concentration of surfactant, the equilibration temperature and equilibration time, were investigated and optimized. Under optimal conditions, the calibration curve was linear {{in the range of}} 0. 06 – 2. 60 mgL− 1. The detection limit of the proposed method was 0. 04 mgL− 1. In addition, the effects of some foreign species, including cations, anions and dyes, were investigated. The method was applied successfully for the determination of <b>Brown</b> <b>HT</b> in some water samples...|$|E

Manage a wide range of juice drinks labeled in large numbers usually require a Material Supplementary Food (BTM). Use of synthetic dyes are always in fear that every moment of this material could otherwise unfit for use as a food additive. If the use of dyes can cause excessive disruption of health. Dyes contained in foods can be a promoter for a tumor or cancer causing substances can be classified as karsiogenik. This research was conducted {{in order to determine the}} type and concentration of dyes on various labeled brands of juice drinks in the market of the city of Malang. The population in this study are all labeled fruit juice beverage products that circulate in the large market town of Malang 20 samples labeled fruit juice beverage with 10 different brands purchased at merchants, is done in two replications.

The heat and light stabilities of the 16 UK-permitted synthetic food colouring matters were investigated in aqueous solution. A specially constructed light box was used to provide exaggerated lighting conditions with fan-cooling of the samples. Comparison of stability has been {{made on the basis}} of the shape of the entire decay curve rather than by simple comparison of loss after a fixed degradation period. Indigo carmine and erythrosine showed little light stability, while ponceau 4 R, chocolate <b>brown</b> <b>HT</b> and brown FK all showed fairly mediocre stability. The thermal stabilities of chocolate <b>brown</b> <b>HT,</b> ponceau 4 R and, most especially, indigo carmine, all proved poor. A new polarographic peak which appeared during the thermal degradation of red 2 G was shown to be due to the deacetylation product, red lOB. Identification was made by polarographic and chromatographic (hplc) comparison with a red lOB standard. A method for the analysis of red 2 G and red lOB present in the same solution was developed using differential pulse polarography. This method included the use of tetrapheny 1 phosphonium chloride to produce a differential shift 1 n the E 1 / 2 values of the respective colouring matters, and so increase the resolution of their polarographic peaks. Hplc analysis was conducted using reversed-phase ion-pair chromatography. A temperature control system was devised for the hplc column (water jacket) which was shown to improve the resolution and reproducibility of retention of the chromatographic peaks. An eluent comprising 63 / 37 / 0. 25 v/v/w methano 1 /water/cetrimide, an SAS-Hypersil packing and thermos tatting at 40 °C were found to be suitable for most of the thermal degradation solutions. A series of 13 chromatograms of thermally degraded solutions were produced under these conditions for comparative purposes. An unexpectedly large number of decay product chromatographic peaks were observed for some food colours. Whereas thermally degraded ponceau 4 R only showed four peaks, most colours showed up to about ten peaks, and a few, e. g. amaranth, green S and sunset yellow FCF showed a dozen or more. Tentative identifications were made of some products from azo colours by reference to standard phenols and aromatic amines. Growth curves were plotted by hplc for a number of the products from the thermal degradation of yellow 2 G. Polarographic and/or chromatographic evidence clearly showed that the thermal degradations of yellow 2 G and of red 2 G were not single step, single pathway processes. The large number of products observed by hplc indicate that this is true of most of the colours. Moreover, thermal degradation pathways need not be the same as photodegradation pathways. This has been shown simply for ponceau 4 R by comparison of UV spectra. Qualitative analysis linked to hplc was also investigated. The construction of UV spectra of decay products by repeated chromatography at different detection wavelengths proved to be quite straightforward. It was found that the use of diazotisation as a pre-column reaction for the differentiation of aromatic amines from phenolic analogues was not suitable: the acidic and strongly ionic conditions employed for diazotisation disrupted the chromatographic ion-pair mechanism beyond correction. Use of fluorescamine proved rapid and simple for sulphanilic acid, but no significant reaction occurred in the aase of naphthionic acid. A method was devised for the analysis of phenol- 4 -sulphonic acid and sulphanilic acid when chromatographically unresolved by comparison of peak absorbance at two wavelengths. Finally, preliminary work was carried out to find how the dependence of retention on eluent composition was affected by the presence of specific functional groups in the analyte. This was seen as of particular application where functional group (e. g. carboxylate) analysis was required for decay products present in low concentration...|$|E

Acid and basic dyes and food colours have been determined by electroanalytical techniques, i. e., amperometric titration, potentiometry using ion selective electrodes developed here, and differential pulse polarography. Several procedures for {{the determination of the}} food colours Sunset Yellow FCF and Tartrazine in sparkling orangeade, Green S and Tartrazine in sparkling limeade, Amaranth and Green S in blackcurrant health drink, and Chocolate <b>Brown</b> <b>HT,</b> Green S and Tartrazine in sparkling dandelion & burdock have been developed by differential pulse polarography in Britton-Robinson buffer. Tetraphenylphosphonium chloride removes the large polarographic maximum obtained with Tartrazine at pH values greater than 4 and causes the peak potential of the colour to be shifted towards more negative potentials. The addition of tetramethylammonium chloride improves the polarographic baseline for the peaks of colours by suppressing polarographic maxima. The food colours in each drink could be simultaneously determined by the control of pH in addition to the use of tetraphenylphosphonium chloride. PVC and liquid state ion-selective electrodes have been developed for the determination of acid and basic dyes. The electrodes are based on basic dye 12 -tungstosilicate, basic dye tetraphenylborate, tetraphenylphosphonium 12 -tungstosilicate, quinoline phosphomolybdate and CI Basic Orange 30 : 1 -Reineckate. PVC electrodes based on Crystal Violet tetraphenylborate and tetraphenylphosphonium 12 -tungstosilicate have produced satisfactory results for the potentiometric titration of several acid dyes with Crystal Violet and basic dyes with sodium tetraphenylborate. The response of the electrodes was sufficiently fast that the electrodes could be used in connection with an automatic titrator. In general, the slope factor of these PVC electrodes was Nernstian, but it gradually decreased with time. Liquid state electrodes using a natural rubber membrane containing Crystal Violet 12 -tungstosilicate or Crystal Violet tetraphenylborate as active material dissolved in o-dichlorobenzene have also been applied successfully to the potentiometric titration of dyes. The life of these electrodes is relatively long because of their easy regeneration. Amperometric titration employing differential pulse polarography showed a promising applicability for the determination of dyes. The end points for the titration curves of acid dyes with a standard Crystal Violet solution and basic dyes with a sodium tetraphenylborate solution were easily determined by a simple graphical method. The high solubility of the precipitate formed causes the curves to be rounded and also the end point to be reached late...|$|E
