5000|$|A <b>bonded</b> <b>seal</b> {{consists}} of an outer annular ring of a hard material, typically steel, and an inner annular ring of an elastomeric material {{that acts as a}} gasket. It is the compression of the elastomeric part between the faces of the parts {{on either side of the}} <b>bonded</b> <b>seal</b> that provides the sealing action. The elastomeric material, typically nitrile rubber, is bonded by heat and pressure to the outer ring, which holds it in place. This structure increases resistance to bursting, increasing the pressure rating of the seal. Because the <b>bonded</b> <b>seal</b> itself acts to retain the gasket material, there is no need for the parts to be sealed to be shaped to retain the gasket. This results in simplified machining and greater ease of use as compared to some other seals, such as O-rings. Some designs come with an additional flap of rubber on the internal diameter to locate the <b>bonded</b> <b>seal</b> at the centre of the hole, these are called self-centring bonded washers ...|$|E

Use of these ceramics as a peripheral seal component has permitted development of bipolar Li/FeS{sub 2 } batteries. This bipolar battery has a molten lithium halide electrolyte and operates at 400 to 450 C.

40|$|In {{the present}} work, planar anode-supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cell short-stacks have been designed, assembled, tested and characterized. The {{design of the}} stacks and its {{components}} (frame, housing, interconnect, compressive and bonded seals) required a great attention to the materials properties (i. e. thermal expansion coefficient compatibility, durability, strength and oxidation resistance, conductivity and so on), {{as well as to}} the fluid-dynamic analysis focused on flow field and gas distribution. Then, a careful analysis was done based on a multidisciplinary approach to select the stack components materials, geometries, and dimensions; in order to assure a high performing stack at elevated temperatures with cost reduction of materials, parts manufacturing and assembly procedure. The materials selected were: Crofer® 22 APU for the interconnect and the frame; AISI 316 L for bolts and housing; Thermiculite® 866 for the compressive seal placed between the frame and the interconnect plate; Flexible Mica Paper for the compressive seal positioned between the interconnect endplate and the housing; SiO 2 -CaO-Al 2 O 3 -Na 2 O glass-ceramic sealant for the <b>bonded</b> <b>seal</b> to join the frame with the cell. On the other hand, the stack assembly was focused on the implementation of innovative and simple procedures, which allowed power capacity scale-up in accordance to power requirements. In this work, two different stack configurations were produced: with one cell (for initial testing of the materials and fluid-dynamic selected solutions) and with three cells. It must be mentioned that all developed stacks in this research were assembled with commercial cells "ASC 3 " from H. C. Starck. Also, calculations at ambient temperature and 800 °C were done in the stack compression system to determine the proper tightening torque to be applied: this value was 50 N. Although this calculation took into consideration the loss of tightening torque at high temperatures, some marks were found in housing and micas during the stack inspection after disassembly. These marks are a clear indicator of gas leakage. Additionally, a study was carried out related to the effect of the protective Mn 1. 5 Co 1. 5 O 4 coating deposited on interconnect surface to prevent the cathode Cr poisoning.

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the microtensile bond strength of the different composite core materials and bonding systems to a fiber post.   Materials and Methods: To evaluate the bond strength of the composite resins to a fiber post (DT light post) 60 posts were divided into six groups : group A: Heliomolar Flow + <b>Seal</b> <b>Bond,</b> group B: Heliomolar Flow + SE Bond, group C: Valux Plus + <b>Seal</b> <b>Bond,</b> group D: Valux Plus + SE Bond, group E: Corecem + <b>Seal</b> <b>Bond,</b> group F: Corecem + SE Bond. All samples were thermocycled for 5000 cycles (5 - 55 0 C) and cut into four bars for the microtensile bond strength test. Failure modes were identified using a stereomicroscope. Data were analysed using One-way ANOVA and Tukey HSD post hoc test (P< 0. 05).   Results: The interaction between composite resin materials and bonding systems were positive. The conventional hybrid composite (Valux Plus) had significantly higher bond strength compared with the core specific flowable composite (Corecem) when <b>Seal</b> <b>Bond</b> was applied as bonding agent (P< 0. 05). However, when SE Bond was utilized hybrid composite demonstrated significantly lower bond strength than that of other two groups (P< 0. 05).   Conclusion: The performance of a particular composite is affected by the bonding system that is applied. A single composite resin may have different bond strength when combined with different bonding system...|$|R

40|$|In the {{development}} of solid oxide fuel cells, the components most in need ofimprovement are still the sealants. Over the last decade, several types of sealants havebeen investigated for use under high temperatures, such as compressive, compliant,and rigidly <b>bonded</b> <b>seals.</b> Of these three types, rigidly <b>bonded</b> glass-ceramic <b>seals</b> arethe most promising. Their properties can be tailored to match the requirements of SOFCsealants. These include the coefficient of thermal expansion, joining temperature,crystallization behavior, electrical insulation, and gas-tightness. Nevertheless, in thepast, the developed sealant compositions failed to demonstrate sufficient mechanicalstrength. This property is extremely important to avoid catastrophic failure of the rigidseals during SOFC operation. Additionally, {{there is a lack}} of standardized methods tocharacterize the mechanical strength of joined components in the research community. This makes it difficult to rely on the results of the state of art measurements, toreproduce them, and indeed to compare them. In order to improve the mechanical strength of glass-ceramic sealants, this workproposes reinforcing the glass-ceramic sealant with different metallic and ceramicparticles. A new concept of laminate sealant, known as a multilayer design, wasdeveloped in an attempt to combine the properties of two types of composites in onejoint. In addition, three possible methods for mechanical strength characterization weredeveloped. The reinforcement concept is mainly based on adding fillers to the glass matrixnamed “ 87 ”, which is a composition from the system BaO-CaO-SiO 2. The chosen fillerswere metallic particles including nickel (Ni), nickel-chromium (NiCr) (80 - 20), copper(Cu), and silver (Ag), as well as ceramic fillers such as gadolinium-doped ceria (CGO) particles and yttrium-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) particles or fibers. These materials weretested in different weight concentrations in the glass matrix to form the composites. Thisapproach showed that adding filler materials (metallic or ceramic) improved themechanical strength values. The multilayer design was also proven to be effective incombining the properties of two different composite layers in one joint. Electricallyinsulating samples with sufficient mechanical strength were produced with single layersof reinforced sealant as well as with the multilayer approac...|$|R

In the current study we have investigated the application of scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM) for assessing the quality of metal thermocompression bonds, both by evaluating its capabilities of localizing areas of poor bonding, and by finding defects in the integrity of the <b>bond</b> <b>seal.</b> Wafer laminates containing a test vehicle of sealing frames with pre-defined defects in the bond metal layer were sealed by Au–Au and Al–Al thermocompression bonding. Employing SAM, an area of five chips of poor bonding was identified non-destructively on the Al–Al laminate. Line defects of width 3. 6 µm and point defects of diameter 22. 4 µm have also been identified by SAM. The dicing yield for sealing frames was above 96 % for all frames of widths 100 – 400 µm and for both bond metal systems. The average bond strength was 31. 5 ± 11. 9 MPa for Al–Al thermocompression bonds and 37. 3 ± 9. 7 MPa for Au–Au thermocompression bonds.

40|$|A {{fission reactor}} {{combined}} with a free-piston Stirling convertor {{is one of many}} credible approaches for producing electrical power in space applications. This study assumes dual-opposed free-piston Stirling engines/linear alternators that will operate nominally at 825 K hot-end and 425 K cold-end temperatures. The baseline design options, temperature profiles, and materials of construction discussed here are based on historical designs as well as modern convertors operating at lower power levels. This notional design indicates convertors primarily made of metallic components that experience minimal change in mechanical properties for fast neutron fluences less than 10 (sup 20) neutrons per square centimeter. However, these radiation effects can impact the magnetic and electrical properties of metals at much lower fluences than are crucial for mechanical property integrity. Moreover, a variety of polymeric materials are also used in common free-piston Stirling designs for <b>bonding,</b> <b>seals,</b> lubrication, insulation and others. Polymers can be affected adversely by radiation doses as low as 10 (sup 5) - 10 (sup 10) rad. Additionally, the absorbing dose rate, radiation hardness, and the resulting effect (either hardening or softening) varies depending {{on the nature of the}} particular polymer. The classes of polymers currently used in convertor fabrication are discussed along possible substitution options. Thus, the materials of construction of prototypic Stirling convertor engines have been considered and the component materials susceptible to damage at the lowest neutron fluences have been identified...|$|R
