5|$|All recent {{specimens}} of the <b>Borneo</b> shark {{have been collected}} solely from fishery landing sites at Mukah in Sarawak, despite thorough surveys across the rest of <b>Borneo</b> (including at the locality of the type specimen). Thus, its range may now be restricted to shallow, inshore waters in northwestern <b>Borneo.</b> Of the five earlier specimens, four came from <b>Borneo</b> and one from Zhoushan Island in China, hinting at a wider historical distribution. This species was also recorded from Borongan in the Philippines in 1895, and Java in 1933; these records cannot be substantiated {{and there have been}} no subsequent sightings from these areas.|$|E

5|$|During June and July 1945 the 56th Independent Mixed Brigade saw combat against Australian {{forces in}} the <b>Borneo</b> Campaign. Its units were greatly under-strength at this time due to the {{casualties}} suffered while moving across <b>Borneo,</b> and the elements which engaged Australian forces were rapidly defeated. The remainder of the brigade withdrew into central <b>Borneo,</b> and surrendered to the Australians {{following the end of}} the war.|$|E
5|$|In 1878, the Sultanate of Sulu {{sold their}} land in {{north-eastern}} <b>Borneo</b> to an Austro-Hungarian consul named Baron von Overbeck. After efforts by Overbeck to sell northern <b>Borneo</b> to the German Empire, Austria-Hungary and the Kingdom of Italy {{for use as}} a penal colony were unsuccessful, he withdrew in 1879. This left Alfred Dent to manage and establish the North <b>Borneo</b> Provisional Association Ltd, as Sandakan became the capital of North <b>Borneo</b> in 1884.|$|E
5|$|As the Allies {{advanced}} towards <b>Borneo,</b> {{additional units}} were dispatched from Japan {{during the second}} half of 1944 and the 37th Army was established in September to coordinate the island's defence. In December 1944, Japanese staff officers deduced that it was likely that Australian troops would be landed at strategic points on the east and west coasts of <b>Borneo</b> in about March the next year (by which time they also expected United States forces to have liberated the Philippines). Accordingly, several Japanese units stationed in north-east <b>Borneo</b> were ordered to march to the western side of <b>Borneo.</b> This movement proceeded slowly, owing to the distances involved and disruptions caused by Allied air attacks.|$|E

5|$|Due {{to massive}} {{destruction}} {{in the town}} of Sandakan since the war, Jesselton was chosen to replace the capital with the Crown continued to rule North <b>Borneo</b> until 1963. The Crown colony government established many departments to oversee the welfare of its residents and to revive the economy of North <b>Borneo</b> after the war. Upon Philippine independence in 1946, seven of the British-controlled Turtle Islands (including Cagayan de Tawi-Tawi and Mangsee Islands) off the north coast of <b>Borneo</b> were ceded to the Philippines as had been negotiated by the American and British colonial governments.|$|E
5|$|Faced {{with the}} {{prospect}} of a takeover by the pro-communists, UMNO changed their minds about the merger. On 27 May, Malaya's Prime Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman, mooted the idea of a Federation of Malaysia, comprising existing Federation of Malaya, Singapore, Brunei and the British <b>Borneo</b> territories of North <b>Borneo</b> and Sarawak. The UMNO leaders believed that the additional Malay population in the <b>Borneo</b> territories would offset Singapore's Chinese population. The British government, for its part, believed that the merger would prevent Singapore from becoming a haven for communism.|$|E

5|$|On 3 January 1942, Japanese forces {{captured}} Labuan unopposed {{during the}} Battle of <b>Borneo.</b> The Japanese developed two airfields (Labuan and Timbalai) on the island, which were built by labourers {{who had been}} conscripted from the Lawas and Terusan regions of mainland <b>Borneo.</b> The island population was also subjected to harsh occupation policies. After Japanese forces suppressed a revolt at the town of Jesselton in late 1943, which was led by Chinese-ethnic civilians, 131 of the rebels were held on Labuan. Only nine rebels survived to be liberated by Australian forces in 1944. Until mid-1944, few Japanese combat units were stationed in <b>Borneo.</b>|$|E
5|$|Orangutans {{were known}} to the native people of Sumatra and <b>Borneo</b> for millennia. While some {{communities}} hunted them for food and decoration, others placed taboos on such practices. In central <b>Borneo,</b> some traditional folk beliefs consider it bad luck {{to look in the}} face of an orangutan. Some folk tales involve orangutans mating with and kidnapping humans. There are even stories of hunters being seduced by female orangutans.|$|E
5|$|The 56th Independent Mixed Brigade was an Imperial Japanese Army unit of World War II. It {{was raised}} in June 1944 to {{reinforce}} the defences of Japanese-occupied <b>Borneo,</b> and was initially stationed in the north-east of the island. In early 1945 most of the brigade's units were ordered {{to move to the}} Brunei Bay area of west <b>Borneo,</b> with the brigade's personnel subsequently making a difficult march across the centre of the island.|$|E
5|$|The BDF and its {{superior}} headquarters, the Seventh Area Army, initially disagreed {{over where}} the 56th Independent Mixed Brigade should be deployed. In July 1944 the BDF {{believed that the}} Allies were likely to invade northern <b>Borneo</b> in January 1945 or later, and wanted to station the brigade in this area. However, the Seventh Area Army judged that Allied forces {{were more likely to}} attack the Brunei Bay region in western <b>Borneo</b> to support a drive on Singapore. Moreover, the area army believed that {{it would be difficult to}} transfer units from northern to western <b>Borneo</b> due to the island's rugged terrain. The BDF eventually won the debate, and the 56th Independent Mixed Brigade's units were landed in the Sandakan area of north-east <b>Borneo</b> as they arrived from Japan.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Labuan was an {{engagement}} fought between Allied and Imperial Japanese {{forces on the}} island of Labuan off <b>Borneo</b> during June 1945. It formed part of the Australian invasion of North <b>Borneo,</b> and was initiated by the Allied forces as part of a plan to capture the Brunei Bay area and develop it into a base to support future offensives.|$|E

5|$|The Sumatran rhino {{is widely}} {{scattered}} across its range, {{much more so}} than the other Asian rhinos, which has made it difficult for conservationists to protect members of the species effectively. Only five areas are known to contain Sumatran rhinoceros: Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park, Gunung Leuser National Park, and Way Kambas National Park on Sumatra; Danum Valley in Sabah, Malaysia, on the island of <b>Borneo,</b> and on Indonesian <b>Borneo</b> west of Samarindah.|$|E

5|$|The {{next phase}} began on 10June when the 9thDivision {{conducted}} simultaneous assaults in north-west Labuan {{and on the}} coast of Brunei. While Brunei was quickly secured, the Japanese garrison on Labuan held out for over a week. After the Brunei Bay region was secured the 24thBrigade was landed in North <b>Borneo</b> and the 20thBrigade advanced along the western coast of <b>Borneo</b> south from Brunei. Both brigades rapidly advanced against weak Japanese resistance and most of north-west <b>Borneo</b> was liberated {{by the end of the}} war. During the campaign the 9thDivision was assisted by indigenous fighters who were waging a guerrilla war against Japanese forces with the support of Australian special forces such as Z Special Unit.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} {{establishing}} the 56th Independent Mixed Brigade took longer than expected, which delayed its deployment to <b>Borneo.</b> While three battalions worth of personnel departed Japan in mid-July 1944, the first did not arrive at <b>Borneo</b> until September. The final {{elements of the}} 56th Independent Mixed Brigade reached <b>Borneo</b> in mid-November. The 8,000 personnel allocated to the brigade had not trained together while in Japan, and were organised into fighting units after their arrival in <b>Borneo.</b> They were also shipped to <b>Borneo</b> separately from their weapons and other equipment. Once its organisation was complete, the 56th Independent Mixed Brigade comprised six infantry battalions (the 366th to 371st Independent Infantry Battalions), each with an authorised strength of 997 men, and small artillery, engineer and signal units. Like the other independent mixed brigades raised in mid-1944, the 56th had only 18 trucks and {{a small number of}} horses to transport its equipment and supplies. The brigade was commanded by Major General Taijiro Akashi.|$|E
5|$|The {{second phase}} of the <b>Borneo</b> Campaign began on 10 June when the 9th Division {{conducted}} simultaneous assaults on the north-west on the island of Labuan and the coast of Brunei. While Brunei was quickly secured, the Japanese garrison on Labuan held out for over a week. After the Brunei Bay region was secured the 24th Brigade was landed in North <b>Borneo</b> and the 20th Brigade advanced along the western coast of <b>Borneo</b> south from Brunei. Both brigades rapidly advanced against weak Japanese resistance, and most of north-west <b>Borneo</b> was liberated {{by the end of the}} war. During the campaign the 9th Division was assisted by indigenous fighters who were waging a guerrilla war against Japanese forces with the support of Australian special forces.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} storms tracked in January. On February 2, a storm was {{observed}} northwest of <b>Borneo</b> in the South China Sea. It {{moved to the}} west and later to the west-southwest, dissipating on February 5 between <b>Borneo</b> and Vietnam. There was a storm in April and another two in May.|$|E
5|$|A {{railway system}} {{formerly}} known as the North <b>Borneo</b> Railway was established in 1896 by the British North <b>Borneo</b> Company. It was built for the main purpose of transporting commodities from the Interior Division to the port in Jesselton (now Kota Kinabalu) during the British occupation. The railway line connects Tanjung Aru in Kota Kinabalu to Tenom and several other towns in between, and it is the only railway system operating in East Malaysia. Today, the railway line is known as the Western Line and managed by the Sabah State Railway, providing daily services for commuters, travellers, as well as for cargo transportation. A separate company operates the leisure tour also called the North <b>Borneo</b> Railway, which caters mainly for tourists. This antique steam train service only running on Saturday and Wednesday mornings from Tanjung Aru station to Kinarut station before returning back to the former station. In 2016, the Tanjung Aru railway station was moved to Aeropod with a new terminal and more public facilities.|$|E
5|$|After {{a series}} of transfers, Overbeck tried to sell the {{territory}} to Germany, Austria-Hungary and Italy but all rejected his offer. Overbeck then co-operated with the British Dent brothers (Alfred Dent and Edward Dent) for financial backing to develop the land, with the Dent company persuading him that any investors would need guarantees of British military and diplomatic support. Overbeck agreed to this co-operation, {{especially with regard to}} the counterclaims of the Sultan of Sulu, part of whose territory in the Sulu Archipelago had been occupied by Spain. Overbeck, however, withdrew in 1879 and his treaty rights were transferred to Alfred Dent, who in 1881 formed the North <b>Borneo</b> Provisional Association Ltd to administer the territory. In the following year, Kudat was made its capital but due to frequent pirate attacks, the capital was moved to Sandakan in 1884. To prevent further disputes over intervention, the governments of the United Kingdom, Spain and Germany signed the Madrid Protocol of 1885, recognising the sovereignty of the King of Spain over the Sulu Archipelago in return for the relinquishment of all Spanish claims over northern <b>Borneo.</b> The arrival of the company brought prosperity to the residents of northern <b>Borneo,</b> with the company allowing indigenous communities to continue their traditional lifestyles, but imposing laws against headhunting, ethnic feuds, slave trade, and piracy. North <b>Borneo</b> then became a protectorate of the United Kingdom in 1888 despite facing local resistance from 1894 to 1900 by Mat Salleh and Antanum in 1915.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{nothing is}} known about the natural history of the <b>Borneo</b> shark. It is {{viviparous}} like other requiem sharks; the females bear litters of six pups, which are provisioned through gestation by a placental connection. The International Union for Conservation of Nature last assessed this species as Endangered, at which time it had not been seen since 1937. While an extant population has since been found, the <b>Borneo</b> shark continues to merit conservation concern given its highly limited range within heavily fished waters.|$|E
5|$|Australian Army {{units were}} {{deployed}} as occupation forces following the Japanese surrender. Under {{the terms of}} an agreement reached between Blamey and Admiral Louis Mountbatten, the head of South East Asia Command, Australia was responsible for providing occupation forces for all of <b>Borneo,</b> the NEI east of Lombok (including western New Guinea) and the pre-war Australian and British territories in eastern New Guinea and the Solomon Islands as well as Nauru and Ocean Islands in the Pacific. The Australian forces in <b>Borneo</b> and the NEI were to remain in place only until they were relieved by British and Dutch units in late 1945. I Corps was responsible for garrisoning <b>Borneo</b> and the eastern NEI, and the First Army disarmed Japanese forces in the pre-war British and Australian territories in and around New Guinea. After the surrender documents were signed the 7th and 9th Divisions took control of <b>Borneo</b> and five forces were dispatched from Morotai and Darwin to the key islands in the eastern NEI. While the British forces in the western NEI took part in fighting against Indonesian nationalists, the Australians were careful to not {{become involved in the}} Indonesian National Revolution and sought to hand control of their occupation zones to the Netherlands Indies Civil Administration as quickly as possible. Relations between the Australian troops and Indonesians were generally good, {{due in part to the}} decision by the Waterside Workers' Federation of Australia to not load Dutch ships which were carrying military supplies bound for the NEI. The last Australian occupation troops left the NEI in February 1946.|$|E
5|$|Australian and United States air units {{began their}} pre-invasion attacks on north <b>Borneo</b> in late May. The first {{attack on the}} Brunei Bay area took place on 3 May, and {{included}} a raid targeting the town of Victoria on Labuan. A large number of further attacks were conducted to suppress Japanese airfields and other facilities throughout north-western and north-eastern <b>Borneo.</b> The plans for the invasion of Brunei Bay had specified that the landings would be supported by aircraft based at Tarakan, but delays in rebuilding the airfield there rendered this impossible and reduced {{the scale of the}} pre-invasion bombardment.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} 1899, {{construction}} {{had started}} on shoplots, a pier and government buildings. This new administrative centre was renamed Jesselton after Sir Charles Jessel, who was the then Vice-Chairman of BNBC. Eventually, Jesselton became a major trading post of North <b>Borneo,</b> dealing in rubber, rattan, honey, and wax. The North <b>Borneo</b> Railway was used to transport goods to the Jesselton harbour. The Malay and Bajau uprisings during those times were not uncommon, and BNBC worked to quell the long-standing threat of piracy in the region. Jesselton suffered a large-scale destruction when it was razed by the British in their retreat from the Japanese and suffered more destruction when the Allies bombed it in 1945. After the Japanese takeover of <b>Borneo,</b> it was again renamed Api. Several rebellions against the Japanese military administration took place in Api. One major rebellion in the town occurred on 10 October 1943 by a group called Kinabalu Guerrillas in the Jesselton Revolt consisting of local inhabitants. Japanese forces quelled the rebellion after its leader, Albert Kwok, was arrested and executed in 1944. At the later stages of the war, {{what remained of the}} town was destroyed again by Allied bombings day and night for over six months as part of the <b>Borneo</b> Campaign in 1945, leaving only three buildings standing. The war in North <b>Borneo</b> ended with the official surrender of the Japanese 37th Army by Lieutenant General Baba Masao in Labuan on 10 September 1945.|$|E
5|$|During 1945 two 4th Armoured Brigade regimental groups saw {{action in}} the <b>Borneo</b> campaign. C Squadron of the 2/9th Armoured Regiment was {{attached}} to the 26th Brigade Group during the invasion of Tarakan in May 1945. The remainder of this regiment subsequently supported the 9th Division during {{the early stages of the}} Battle of North <b>Borneo</b> from 10 June. The 1st Armoured Regiment and Armoured Squadron (Special Equipment) were attached to the 7th Division, and took part in the Battle of Balikpapan from 1 July.|$|E
5|$|During March 1945, Wells {{acted as}} one of the eight pallbearers for Major General George Alan Vasey at the latter's funeral. Vasey had been killed in a plane crash just off the coast of Cairns, while en route to assume command of the 6th Division in New Guinea. That same month, it was decided that I Corps would lead an assault against the island of <b>Borneo.</b> As a consequence, {{headquarters}} of I Corps moved to Morotai, where it opened on 24 April. The initial <b>Borneo</b> landings took place on 1 May, with the Australian force in action at Tarakan. Over the proceeding engagements, Wells assisted in the organisation and implementation of the operations in <b>Borneo.</b> As the war drew to a close in September 1945, Wells returned to Australia and was posted to Army Headquarters in Melbourne.|$|E
