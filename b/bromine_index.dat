40|$|International audienceThe {{cathodic}} {{reduction of}} propargyl bromide in regular polar solvents such as N,N-dimethylformamide or acetonitrile (ACN) {{results in a}} two-electron scission of the Csingle bondBr bond. In contrast to this, the use of solvents of higher dielectric permittivity like propylene carbonate (PC) containing tetraalkylammonium iodide as electrolyte permits the quasi instantaneous formation of the corresponding iodide that can be electrochemically cleaved in a different way. Using gold, platinum, palladium or copper under those conditions allows obtaining the propargyl radical at quite low potentials. Unexpectedly, glassy carbon (GC) as cathode material causes a neat splitting of two one-electron transfers (ET) usually observed for most of organic halides as a single two-electron step. A dense propargylation of these solid surfaces was noticed. The propargyl group surface coverage was checked by FTIR, by its derivatization with alkyl ferrocene using azide-yne click chemistry, and by <b>bromine</b> <b>index</b> (coulometric reduction of halogenated surface-grafted layers); its level {{was found to be}} (4 - 6) × 10 − 9 mol cm− 2 of the apparent starting electrode area...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA facile {{immobilization}} {{method of}} vinyl groups onto glassy carbon is described using ω-bromo- 1 -alkenes as model substrates. The process {{is based on}} the cathodic charging of the carbon electrode at E < − 2 V vs. Ag/AgCl performed in organic polar solvents containing tetraalkylammonium salts. This cathodic charging of carbons permits the SN displacement of the bromide out of bromo-alkenes and leads to a thorough surface coating with a thin layer of unsaturated chain. The surfacial level of vinylation (~ 5 × 10 − 9 mol cm− 2) was efficiently estimated by means of <b>bromine</b> and iodine <b>indexes.</b> Additionally, the efficiency of this halogen addition reaction to the alkene functional group was confirmed by EDS measurement...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{cathodic}} {{reduction of}} allyl bromide (AllBr) in polar solvents of high dielectric constant containing tetraalkylammonium iodide at precious metals (Au, Pd, Pt, Rh) permits the one-electron scission of the Csingle bondBr bond easily generating allyl radical. Glassy carbon (GC) used as cathode material also allows splitting the two one-electron transfers, usually observed {{with most of}} organic halides. A facile and dense allylation of several solid surfaces (in particular, at GC, Au and Pt) is obtained. The level of ethylenic moiety coverage was calculated by means of <b>bromine</b> and iodine <b>indices</b> (coulometric reduction of halogenated surface-grafted layers) and found to be between 1 and 6 × 10 − 9 mol cm− 2 of the original electrode area...|$|R
40|$|Sea ice is an {{important}} parameter in the climate system and its changes impact upon the polar albedo and at- mospheric and oceanic circulation. Iodine (I) and bromine (Br) have been measured in a shallow firn core drilled at {{the summit of the}} Holtedahlfonna glacier (Northwest Spitsber- gen, Svalbard). Changing I concentrations can be linked to the March–May maximum sea ice extension. <b>Bromine</b> en- richment, <b>indexed</b> to the Br / Na sea water mass ratio, appears to be influenced by changes in the seasonal sea ice area. I is emitted from marine biota and so the retreat of March–May sea ice coincides with enlargement of the open-ocean surface which enhances marine primary production and consequent I emission. The observed Br enrichment could be explained by greater Br emissions during the Br explosions that have been observed to occur mainly above first year sea ice during the early springtime. In this work we present the first compari- son between halogens in surface snow and Arctic sea ice ex- tension. Although further investigation is required to charac- terize potential depositional and post-depositional processes, these preliminary findings suggest that I and Br can be linked to variability in the spring maximum sea ice extension and seasonal sea ice surface area...|$|R
