5|$|Ebert was {{a strong}} {{advocate}} for Maxivision 48, in which the movie projector runs at 48 frames per second, {{as compared to the}} usual 24 frames per second. He was opposed to the practice whereby theatres lower the intensity of their projector <b>bulbs</b> <b>in</b> order to extend the life of the bulb, arguing that this has little effect other than to make the film harder to see. Ebert was skeptical of the recent resurgence of 3D effects in film, which he found unrealistic and distracting.|$|E

5|$|This {{case had}} a lamp and socket used by Hammer {{for the first}} {{electric}} sign ever made. It lit up the name EDISON letter by letter in sequence when a set of switches were turned on by hand – {{one at a time}} in order. It was constructed in December 1881 and hung up in 1882 at the Crystal Palace in London. The lamp <b>bulbs</b> <b>in</b> this case display were numbered 782 to 1031. Below are some of the incandescent electric lamps that were in this case.|$|E
5|$|In Mackay's account, the panicked tulip speculators {{sought help}} from the {{government}} of the Netherlands, which responded by declaring that anyone who had bought contracts to purchase <b>bulbs</b> <b>in</b> the future could void their contract by payment of a 10 percent fee. Attempts were made to resolve the situation to the satisfaction of all parties, but these were unsuccessful. The mania finally ended, Mackay says, with individuals stuck with the bulbs they held {{at the end of the}} crash—no court would enforce payment of a contract, since judges regarded the debts as contracted through gambling, and thus not enforceable by law.|$|E
5|$|People were {{purchasing}} bulbs {{at higher}} and higher prices, intending to re-sell them for a profit. However, such a scheme could not last unless someone was ultimately willing to pay such high prices and take possession of the <b>bulbs.</b> <b>In</b> February 1637, tulip traders could no longer find new buyers willing to pay increasingly inflated prices for their bulbs. As this realization set in, the demand for tulips collapsed, and prices plummeted—the speculative bubble burst. Some were left holding contracts to purchase tulips at prices now ten times greater than those on the open market, while others found themselves in possession of bulbs now worth {{a fraction of the}} price they had paid. Mackay claims the Dutch devolved into distressed accusations and recriminations against others in the trade.|$|E

5|$|To {{the south}} of the church there are the {{remnants}} of a stone preaching cross. The cross was originally situated on Poulton's boundary and marked a resting place for mourners travelling long distances to bury corpses at St Chad's. Only the two circular steps into which the original structure was set remain; the cross shaft has been replaced by an octagonal pillar. The pillar was used as a sundial until the early 20th century when the gnomon was stolen. The steps function as a memorial for present-day mourners at St Chad's, in a small garden of remembrance. The churchyard is noted locally for its display of crocuses and other flowering <b>bulbs</b> <b>in</b> early springtime.|$|E
5|$|Bulbs {{offered for}} sale are {{referred}} to as either 'round' or 'double nose'. Round bulbs are circular in cross section and produce a single flower stem, while double nose bulbs have more than one bulb stem attached at the base and produce two or more flower stems, but bulbs with more than two stems are unusual. Planted narcissi bulbs produce daughter <b>bulbs</b> <b>in</b> the axil of the bulb scales, leading to the dying off of the exterior scales. To prevent planted bulbs forming more and more small bulbs, they can be dug up every 5–7 years, and the daughters separated and replanted separately, provided that a piece of the basal plate, where the rootlets are formed, is preserved. For daffodils to flower {{at the end of the}} winter or early spring, bulbs are planted in autumn (September–November). This plant does well in ordinary soil but flourishes best in rich soil. Daffodils like the sun but also accepts partial shade exposure.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, Emily B. Griffin {{found that}} Stegoceras and other pachycephalosaurs {{had a good}} sense of smell (olfaction), based on the study of cranial endocasts that showed large {{olfactory}} <b>bulbs</b> <b>in</b> the brain. In 2014, Jason M. Bourke and colleagues found that Stegoceras would have needed cartilaginous nasal turbinates {{in the front of the}} nasal passages for airflow to reach the olfactory region. Evidence for the presence of this structure is a bony ridge to which it could have attached. The size of the olfactory region also indicates that Stegoceras had a keen sense of smell. The researchers found that the dinosaur could have had either a scroll-shaped turbinate (like in a turkey) or a branched one (as in an ostrich) as both could have directed air to the olfactory region. The blood vessel system in the passages also suggest that the turbinates served to cool down warm arterial blood from the body that was heading to the brain. The skull of S. validum specimen UALVP 2 was suited for a study of this kind due to its exceptional preservation; it has ossified soft tissue in the nasal cavity, which would otherwise be cartilaginous and therefore not preserved through mineralization.|$|E
