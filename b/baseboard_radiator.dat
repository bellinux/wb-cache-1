50|$|Ground source {{heat pumps}} are {{especially}} well matched to underfloor heating and <b>baseboard</b> <b>radiator</b> systems which only require warm temperatures 40 °C (104 °F) to work well. Thus they {{are ideal for}} open plan offices. Using large surfaces such as floors, as opposed to radiators, distributes the heat more uniformly and allows for a lower water temperature. Wood or carpet floor coverings dampen this effect because the thermal transfer efficiency of these materials is {{lower than that of}} masonry floors (tile, concrete). Underfloor piping, ceiling or wall radiators can also be used for cooling in dry climates, although the temperature of the circulating water must be above the dew point to ensure that atmospheric humidity does not condense on the radiator.|$|E
5000|$|Radiators are {{sometimes}} installed inside or {{in front of}} <b>baseboards</b> (<b>baseboard</b> <b>radiators).</b> These radiators rely on hot water as their heat source. [...] Electric heating is also used in this manner.|$|R
5000|$|Liquid-to-water {{heat pumps}} (also called water-to-water) are {{hydronic}} systems that use water to carry heating or cooling through the building. Systems such as radiant underfloor heating, <b>baseboard</b> <b>radiators,</b> conventional cast iron radiators {{would use a}} liquid-to-water heat pump. These heat pumps are preferred for pool heating or domestic hot water pre-heat. Heat pumps can only heat water to about [...] efficiently, whereas a boiler normally reaches 65 - 95 C. Legacy radiators designed for these higher temperatures {{may have to be}} doubled in numbers when retrofitting a home. A hot water tank will still be needed to raise water temperatures above the heat pump's maximum, but pre-heating will save 25-50% of hot water costs.|$|R
50|$|Traditional {{cast iron}} {{radiators}} {{are no longer}} common in new construction, replaced mostly with forced hot water <b>baseboard</b> style <b>radiators.</b> They consist of copper pipes which have aluminium fins to increase their surface area. These conduction boiler systems use conduction to transfer heat from the water into the metal radiators or convectors.|$|R
50|$|Klaus Hammes {{continued}} through the 1960s and ’70s to adapt the air filter for other heating systems such as <b>radiators,</b> <b>baseboard</b> heating and forced-air heating and cooling systems. In 1982, Klaus Hammes relocated the company headquarters to Switzerland, from which the company continued to expand.|$|R
40|$|A {{new method}} of test for {{residential}} thermal distribution efficiency {{is currently being}} developed {{under the auspices of}} the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE). The initial version of this test method is expected to have two main approaches, or ``pathways,`` designated Design and Diagnostic. The Design Pathway will use builder`s information to predict thermal distribution efficiency in new construction. The Diagnostic Pathway will use simple tests to evaluate thermal distribution efficiency in a completed house. Both forced-air and hydronic systems are included in the test method. This report describes an approach to predicting and measuring thermal distribution efficiency for residential hydronic heating systems for use in the Design and Diagnostic Pathways of the test method. As written, it is designed for single-loop systems with any type of passive radiation/convection (<b>baseboard</b> or <b>radiators).</b> Multiloop capability may be added later...|$|R
50|$|In the 20th century, mass-produced {{plumbing}} pipes {{were made}} from galvanized steel. As users experienced problems with the internal build-up of rust, which reduced water volume, these were replaced by copper tubing in the late 1960s. Plastic pipes with fittings using glue were used as well in later decades. Initially PEX tubing {{was the most popular}} way to transport water in hydronic radiant heating systems, and it was used first in hydronic systems from the 1960s onwards. Hydronic systems circulate water from a boiler or heater to places in the house needing heat, such as <b>baseboard</b> heaters or <b>radiators.</b> PEX is suitable for recirculating hot water.|$|R
