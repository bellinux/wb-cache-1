A {{new type}} {{all-terrain}} tracked water carrier is customized for water transportation with complicated terrains such as marsh, lake or dessert etc. The vehicle is designed based on combination of all-terrain tracked chassis and water storage tank. The tracked chassis provides the ferrying possibility, while tank {{structure and the}} thickness of heat-insulating layer is the key for successful ferrying. To further research the ferrying characteristics, the floatability <b>and</b> initial <b>stability</b> are analyzed. Then to optimize design of the vehicle, mathematic model of buoyancy center, reserve <b>buoyancy</b> <b>and</b> initial <b>stability</b> is established. At last, the field ferrying test is done.

40|$|The {{depth of}} the {{planetary}} boundary layer (PBL) is a climatologically important quantity that has received little attention on regional to global scales. Here a 10 -yr climatology of PBL depth from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) atmospheric GCM is analyzed using the PBL mass budget. Based on the dominant physical processes, several PBL regimes are identified. These regimes tend to exhibit large-scale geographic organization. Locally generated <b>buoyancy</b> fluxes <b>and</b> static <b>stability</b> control PBL depth nearly everywhere, though convective mass flux has a large influence at tropical marine locations. Virtually all geographical variability in PBL depth can be linearly related to these quantities. While dry convective boundary layers dominate over land, stratocumulus-topped boundary layers are most common over ocean. This division of regimes leads to a dramatic land–sea contrast in PBL depth. Diurnal effects keep mean PBL depth over land shallow despite large daytime surface fluxes. The contrast arises because the large daily exchange of heat and mass between the PBL and free atmosphere over land is not present over the ocean, where mixing is accomplished by turbulent entrainment. Consistent treatment of remnant air from the deep, daytime PBL is necessary for proper representation of this diurnal behavior over land. Many locations exhibit seasonal shifts in PBL regime related to changes in PBL clouds. These shifts are controlled by seasonal variations in <b>buoyancy</b> flux <b>and</b> static <b>stability.</b> 1...|$|R

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} develop nutritionally {{balanced}} and costeffective processed diets for milkfish larvae (Chanos chanos). Two larval diets (feed A and feed B) were formulated and prepared to contain 45 % protein and 10 % lipid. Several larval diet preparations were tried such as microbound/unpelleted (freeze-dried), microbound /pelleted (oven-dried) and microbound/flaked (drum-dried) and assessed in terms of feed particle size <b>and</b> <b>buoyancy,</b> water <b>stability</b> <b>and</b> feed acceptability. The preparation that gave the best particle size <b>and</b> <b>buoyancy</b> as well as good water stability was prepared as the microbound diet (using K-carrageenan as a binder) and flaked using a drum drier. A series of feeding experiments were conducted to determine the growth and survival of milkfish larvae reared on various feeding schemes using these processed larval diets which were fed either solely or in combination with live feed. Larvae in control treatments were reared on live foods such as Brachionus plicatilis and Artemia nauplii. Larvae were observed to ingest the diets, indicating that the feeds had suitable physical characteristics and were attractive to the larvae. The overall results of the feeding trials showed that the artificial diets could be fed to milkfish larvae in combination with Brachionus rotifers starting on day 2 or day 8, and could be fed alone starting from day 15. These promising results would reduce the dependence of milkfish larvae on live feed and would have significant economic benefits {{in the form of}} simplified milkfish hatchery procedures.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} static {{stability}} of a sailboat is presented with focus on rotation about its longitudinal axis. For {{an explanation of}} basic concepts which are connected to <b>buoyancy</b> <b>and</b> static <b>stability</b> of the boat, the boat’s hull is simplified to the extent which allows for description of all parameters with simple mathematical expressions. In the theoretical part basic terms which are important for the description of a floating body are intoduced and the curve of static stability of the vessel is explained, which represents {{the central part of}} the thesis. A computer program Geogebra is used for analytical determination of the position of the water line for different angles of inclination and the total potential energy of the system is introduced. Further, static stability is discussed in terms of three variables – ballast, cross-sectional shape of the hull and the width of the hull. In the practical part of this thesis the impact of all previously introduced variables (ballast, width and shape) is analyzed with the help of three simplified models of hulls. For each case, the curve of static stability is plotted. Data, obtained at measurements is linked to the theoretical results, presented in the first part of the thesis. Experimental method used for determining the balancing torque without determining the center of buoyancy is also explained in this part. ...|$|R

40|$|Military {{intelligence}} has considered various coastal scenarios {{in which the}} submarine is the only platform -available to engage waterborne infiltration forces. Torpedoes are meant for large ships, and cruise missiles are strategic weapons not to be wasted on small craft. Therefore, the submarine {{does not have a}} weapons capability to engage and destroy high-speed marine craft (HSMC) that would be used for coastal infiltration. The most practical scenario would utilize a torpedo stow for a weapon system that would be tube launched, thus ensuring the maximum cruise missile capability of the submarine with a minimal sacrifice to anti-surface and anti-submarine warfare capabilities. The maintaining of the submarine's stealth will be paramount, therefore, an off-hull launcher is desired. The weapon *needs to be highly discriminative due to high shipping traffic in coastal waters. In all, the major factors associated with the design and employment of a sub-launched weapon system for engaging HSMC are the threat, the missile, the launcher and the deployment method. In a hostile coastal environment, there are numerous targets ranging from surface threats to air threats. Missile design is dependent on the threat and can be varied for different scenarios. However, the launcher and deployment of a tube launched weapon system are only restricted by the dimensions of the torpedo tube and the <b>buoyancy</b> <b>and</b> <b>stability</b> of the designed system. These parameters can be quantified and modeled. This thesis focused on designing a weapon system, SEABAT, to meet the basic <b>buoyancy</b> <b>and</b> <b>stability</b> requirements.
