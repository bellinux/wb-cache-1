25|$|A {{series of}} scandals around the {{approval}} of generic drugs in the late 1980s shook public confidence in generic drugs; there were several instances in which companies obtained <b>bioequivalence</b> data fraudulently, by using the branded drug in their tests instead of their own product, and a congressional investigation found corruption at the FDA, where employees were accepting bribes to approve some generic companies' applications and delaying or denying others.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bioequivalence</b> {{does not}} mean generic drugs must be {{exactly the same as}} the brand-name product ("pharmaceutical equivalent"). Chemical {{differences}} may exist; a different salt or estermay be used, for instance. However, the therapeutic effect of the drug must be the same ("pharmaceutical alternative"). Most small molecule drugs are accepted as bioequivalent if their pharmacokinetic parameters of area under the curve (AUC) and maximum concentration (Cmax) are within a 90% confidence interval of 80–125%; most approved generics are well within this limit. For more complex products—such as inhalers, patch delivery systems, liposomal preparations, or biosimilar drugs—demonstrating pharmacodynamic or clinical equivalence is more challenging.|$|E
500|$|On 11 October 2007, two {{providers}} of consumer information on nutritional products and supplements, ConsumerLab.com and The People's Pharmacy, released {{the results of}} comparative tests of different brands of bupropion. The People's Pharmacy received multiple reports of increased side effects and decreased efficacy of generic bupropion, which prompted it to ask ConsumerLab.com to test the products in question. The tests showed that [...] "one of a few generic versions of Wellbutrin XL 300mg, sold as Budeprion XL 300mg, didn't perform {{the same as the}} brand-name pill in the lab." [...] The FDA investigated these complaints and concluded that Budeprion XL is equivalent to Wellbutrin XL in regard to bioavailability of bupropion and its main active metabolite hydroxybupropion. The FDA also said that coincidental natural mood variation is the most likely explanation for the apparent worsening of depression after the switch from Wellbutrin XL to Budeprion XL. On 3 October 2012, however, the FDA reversed this opinion, announcing that [...] "Budeprion XL 300mg fails to demonstrate therapeutic equivalence to Wellbutrin XL 300mg." [...] The FDA did not test the <b>bioequivalence</b> of any of the other generic versions of Wellbutrin XL 300mg, but requested that the four manufacturers submit data on this question to the FDA by March 2013. As of October 2013 the FDA has made determinations on the formulations from some manufacturers not being bioequivalent.|$|E
2500|$|Before {{a company}} can market a generic drug, it needs to file an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) with the Food and Drug Administration, seeking to {{demonstrate}} therapeutic equivalence to a previously approved [...] "reference-listed drug" [...] and proving that it can manufacture the drug safely and consistently. [...] For an ANDA to be approved, the FDA requires the <b>bioequivalence</b> of a generic drug to be between 80% and 125% of the innovator product. (This range {{is part of a}} statistical calculation, and does not mean that generic drugs are allowed to differ from their brand-name counterparts by up to 25 percent.) The FDA evaluated 2,070 studies conducted between 1996 and 2007 that compared the absorption of brand-name and generic drugs into a person’s body. The average difference in absorption between the generic and the brand-name drug was 3.5 percent, comparable to the difference between two batches of a brand-name drug. [...] Non-innovator versions of biologic drugs, or biosimilars, require clinical trials for immunogenicity in addition to tests establishing bioequivalency. These products cannot be entirely identical because of batch-to-batch variability and their biological nature, and they are subject to extra rules.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} {{to data from}} <b>bioequivalence</b> studies, other data {{may need to be}} submitted to meet regulatory requirements for <b>bioequivalence.</b> Such evidence may include: ...|$|E
50|$|While the {{mechanisms}} by which a formulation affects bioavailability and <b>bioequivalence</b> have been extensively studied in drugs, formulation factors that influence bioavailability and <b>bioequivalence</b> in nutritional supplements are largely unknown. As a result, in nutritional sciences, relative bioavailability or <b>bioequivalence</b> {{is the most common}} measure of bioavailability, comparing the bioavailability of one formulation of the same dietary ingredient to another.|$|E

5000|$|When two {{drugs have}} the same bioavailability, {{they are said to}} be {{biological}} equivalents or bioequivalents. This concept of <b>bioequivalence</b> is important because it is currently used as a yardstick in the authorization of generic drugs in many countries [...]|$|E
50|$|Using <b>bioequivalence</b> as {{the basis}} for {{approving}} generic copies of drug products was established by the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, also known as the Hatch-Waxman Act. This Act expedites the availability of less costly generic drugs by permitting FDA to approve applications to market generic versions of brand-name drugs without conducting costly and duplicative clinical trials. At the same time, the brand-name companies can apply for up to five additional years longer patent protection for the new medicines they developed to make up for time lost while their products were going through FDA's approval process. Brand-name drugs are subject to the same <b>bioequivalence</b> tests as generics upon reformulation.|$|E
50|$|The Cmax {{is often}} {{measured}} {{in an effort}} to show <b>bioequivalence</b> (BE) between a generic and innovator drug product. According to the FDA, drug quality bioavailability (BA) and BE rely on pharmacokinetic measurements such as AUC and Cmax that are reflective of systemic exposure.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bioequivalence</b> {{is a term}} in {{pharmacokinetics}} used {{to assess}} the expected in vivo biological equivalence of two proprietary preparations of a drug. If two products are said to be bioequivalent it means that they would be expected to be, for all intents and purposes, the same.|$|E
50|$|In the {{presence}} of such CPP, WHO recommends to national authorities to ensure that analytical methods can be confirmed by the national laboratory, to review and if necessary to adapt product information as per local labelling requirements, and to assess <b>bioequivalence</b> and stability data if necessary.|$|E

50|$|The {{characteristics}} of a medication's excipient play {{a fundamental role in}} creating a suitable environment for the correct absorption of a drug. This can mean that the same dose of a drug in different forms can have different <b>bioequivalence,</b> as they yield different plasma concentrations and therefore have different therapeutic effects.|$|E
5000|$|The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{has defined}} <b>bioequivalence</b> as, [...] "the {{absence of a}} {{significant}} difference in the rate and extent to which the active ingredient or active moiety in pharmaceutical equivalents or pharmaceutical alternatives becomes available at the site of drug action when administered at the same molar dose under similar conditions in an appropriately designed study." ...|$|E
50|$|Many {{scientific}} endeavors {{are dependent}} upon accurate quantification {{of drugs and}} endogenous substances in biological samples; the focus of bioanalysis in the pharmaceutical industry {{is to provide a}} quantitative measure of the active drug and/or its metabolite(s) for the purpose of pharmacokinetics, toxicokinetics, <b>bioequivalence</b> and exposure-response (pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics studies). Bioanalysis also applies to drugs used for illicit purposes, forensic investigations, anti-doping testing in sports, and environmental concerns.|$|E

50|$|In 2016, a {{group of}} high school {{students}} from Sydney Grammar supported by the University of Sydney prepared pyrimethamine as an illustration that the synthesis is comparatively easy and the price-hike unjustifiable. Shkreli said the schoolboys were not competition, likely because the necessary <b>bioequivalence</b> studies require a sample of the existing medication provided directly by the company, and not simply purchased from a pharmacy, which Turing could decline to provide.|$|E
5000|$|Generic drug {{applications}} are termed [...] "abbreviated" [...] because (in comparison with a New Drug Application) {{they are generally}} not required to include preclinical (animal and in vitro) and clinical (human) trial data to establish safety and effectiveness. Instead, generic applicants must scientifically demonstrate that their product is bioequivalent (i.e., performs {{in the same manner}} as the innovator drug). One way scientists demonstrate <b>bioequivalence</b> is to measure the time it takes the generic drug to reach the bloodstream in 24 to 36 healthy volunteers. This gives them the rate of absorption, or bioavailability, of the generic drug, which they can then compare to that of the innovator drug. The generic version must deliver the same amount of active ingredients into a patient's bloodstream in the same amount of time as the innovator drug. In cases of topically active drugs, the <b>bioequivalence</b> of a drug can be demonstrated by comparing drugs dissolution or transdermal drug absorption is compared with the innovator drug. In cases of systemically active drugs, active drug blood concentration of that drug is compared with the innovator drug.|$|E
50|$|Unlike generics, biosimilars {{cannot be}} {{approved}} {{on the basis}} of minimal and inexpensive tests to prove <b>bioequivalence.</b> Since biological drugs are complex, heterogeneous products derived from living cells, they can only be shown to be highly similar to the appropriate reference product and therefore require demonstration that there are no clinically meaningful differences in safety and efficacy. The extent to which clinical trials are required will largely determine the cost of development.|$|E
50|$|Solubility class {{boundaries}} {{are based on}} the highest dose strength of an immediate release product. A drug is considered highly soluble when the highest dose strength is soluble in 250 ml or less of aqueous media over the pH range of 1 to 7.5. The volume estimate of 250 ml is derived from typical <b>bioequivalence</b> study protocols that prescribe administration of a drug product to fasting human volunteers with a glass of water.|$|E
