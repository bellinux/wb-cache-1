40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effects of heat flux, {{saturation}} temperature, and outlet conditions on HFO 1234 ze(E) <b>boiling</b> <b>inside</b> a Brazed Plate Heat Exchanger (BPHE). The effect of the heat flux on the heat transfer coefficients was remarkable. Similar consideration applies for outlet condition effects whereas the impact of saturation temperature {{was found to be}} lower. The frictional pressure drop shows a linear dependence on the refrigerant kinetic energy per unit volume. The two-phase flow boiling heat transfer coefficients were compared with a new model for refrigerant <b>boiling</b> <b>inside</b> BPHE (Longo et al., 2015) : the mean absolute percentage deviation between calculated and experimental data is 7. 2 %. The present data points were compared with those of HFC 134 a and HFO 1234 yf previously measured inside the same BPHE under the same operating conditions: HFO 1234 ze(E) exhibits heat transfer coefficients very similar to HFC 134 a and HFO 1234 yf and frictional pressure drops slightly higher than HFC 134 a and HFO 1234 yf...|$|R

25|$|A BWR {{is like a}} PWR {{without the}} steam generator. A boiling water reactor is cooled and moderated by water like a PWR, but at a lower {{pressure}}, which allows the water to <b>boil</b> <b>inside</b> the pressure vessel producing the steam that runs the turbines. Unlike a PWR, there is no primary and secondary loop. The thermal efficiency of these reactors can be higher, {{and they can be}} simpler, and even potentially more stable and safe.

50|$|The first {{thermostats}} used {{a sealed}} capsule of an organic liquid with a boiling point {{just below the}} desired opening temperature. These capsules {{were made in the}} form of a cylindrical bellows. As the liquid <b>boiled</b> <b>inside</b> the capsule, the capsule bellows expanded, opening a sheet brass plug valve within the thermostat. As these thermostats could fail in service, they were designed for easy replacement during servicing, usually by being mounted under the water outlet fitting at the top of the cylinder block. Conveniently this was also the hottest accessible part of the cooling circuit, giving a fast response when warming up.|$|R
