50|$|As {{a result}} of his {{interest}} in gene regulation in mammalian cells, Riggs became curious about X chromosome inactivation, in which one of the two copies of the X chromosome present in a female mammal is inactivated. One of its co-discoverers, Susumu Ohno, worked at the City <b>of</b> <b>Hope</b> National Medical Center. In 1969 Riggs joined the department <b>of</b> molecular <b>biology</b> at the City <b>of</b> <b>Hope</b> National Medical Center as an associate research scientist.

Through {{mutations}} and genomic alterations, the cell acquires specific and stem cell-like characteristics necessary for invasion {{of a distant}} organ and ultimately metastasis. Metastatic brain cancer is a particularly formidable disease because of its poor prognosis and the highly resistant nature of the tumor to chemotherapy. Although several types of primary tumors {{have a tendency to}} metastasize to the brain, the incidence of brain metastases has increased dramatically in some subsets of breast cancer patients. Several conventional treatments are available, but success is limited and often short-lived. Given that no standard treatment options exist, there is a significant need to investigate the <b>biology</b> <b>of</b> these clinically recalcitrant tumors.

50|$|During his {{childhood}} and early adolescent years, Beutler developed a lasting interest in biological science. Some of his formative experiences in biology included {{studies in the}} laboratory of his father, and later, in the City <b>of</b> <b>Hope</b> laboratory <b>of</b> Susumu Ohno, a mammalian geneticist known {{for his work on}} evolution, genome structure, and sex differentiation. In addition, he worked in the laboratories of Abraham Braude, an expert in the <b>biology</b> <b>of</b> lipopolysaccharide (LPS), also known as endotoxin, and Patricia Spear, an authority on Herpes simplex virus. Later, Beutler was to perform extensive research on both LPS and herpesviruses, aimed principally at understanding inborn host resistance to infectious diseases, often referred to as innate immunity.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to analyze a popular pseudo-scientific {{discourse}} in Germany in the twenties that developed an idea of a state as a living organism. The discourse was sometimes named “the <b>biology</b> <b>of</b> the state”. The aim of this analysis {{is to provide a}} genealogy of the term “biopolitics” that was first used by a Swedish theoretician <b>of</b> the <b>biology</b> <b>of</b> the state Rudolf Kjellén and to show the influence, that the idea <b>of</b> the <b>biology</b> <b>of</b> the state had {{on the development of the}} Nazi biopolitics. The paper reconstructs the main aspects of Michel Foucault’s genealogy of the modern biopolitics and subsequently shows, how the idea <b>of</b> the <b>biology</b> <b>of</b> the state constituted the extreme development of the naturalistic tendencies diagnosed by Foucault in the modern theories of (bio) politics. </p...|$|R
