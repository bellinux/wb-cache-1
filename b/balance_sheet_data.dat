The general empirical evidence point to a positive effect of high performance work practices, within which high commitment/involvement practices may be encompassed, on labour productivity, despite the heterogeneity of approaches and of available data. As a matter of fact, empirical studies on {{the main issue of}} the paper are not scanty, but they rarely utilize an integrated perspective that take into consideration, contextually, worker representation and high performance work practices as determinants of firm’s economic performance.

40|$|Existing {{literature}} has identified domestic {{restrictive monetary policy}} and deteriorating funding conditions as the predominant factors explaining the increase in net interoffice accounts of global banks, that is, the net liabilities of parent offices due to their related foreign offices. The purpose {{of this research is}} twofold. Firstly, it quantifies the responsiveness of net interoffice accounts to variations in different types of domestic funding. Secondly, the paper assesses whether the relationship between net interoffice accounts and domestic policy-steered rates depends on cross-sectional differences in the funding structure of global banks. Using US banks' <b>balance</b> <b>sheets</b> <b>data</b> collected by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, the results highlight the importance of domestic repo borrowings in explaining net interoffice accounts, especially for larger banks during the crisis.

Class I banks are categorized {{as those with}} tier 1 capital in excess of $ 4 billion and internationally active while Class II banks are the rest. A Cointegrated Vector Autoregressive (CVAR) approach was used on <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> liquidity <b>data</b> to ascertain the behavior of variables in relation to bank failure. The study also demonstrated the nature {{of each of the}} variables containing estimated Basel III and Traditional liquidity measures for Class I and II banks. The estimated Basel III liquidity standards were made up of the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) while the liquidity measures involved Government Securities Ratio (GSR) and Brokered Deposit Ratio (BDR). Results showed that a response of Net Stable Funding Ratio to a shock in Liquidity Coverage Ratio decreased in the first quarter and a steady continuous increase in the next quarters was observed. A shock on the Liquidity Coverage Ratio therefore would cause banks to increase their level of Net Stable Funding Ratio. This explains why the Liquidity Coverage Ratio is considered for a short term stress period of 30 calender days while the Net Stable Funding Ratio will be considered for a longer stress period of 1 year when fully implemented by banks...|$|R

For that using the ratios of the benchmark set a reference CP ideal point is obtained, and with it for each ratio a reduced Ratio Quality Index (RQI) is obtained containing a relative CP quality evaluation.

In this closely knit context, the outsourcing of some of the productive and trade activities abroad {{has become one of the}} focal points of the policies followed by businesses in order to handle competition at worldwide level. In the 80 s Italian clothing and footwear firms faced the increased competition in the international markets by outsourcing to domestic subcontractors and in the 90 s transferred much of the previous outsourcing abroad, in countries with low labour costs, mainly in Eastern Europe, North Africa and East Asia. This paper is aimed to assess the impact of the offshoring strategy on firms. performance. It is based on a survey delivered to a group of 70 final producers, operating in the Veneto, that during the 90 s began to manage production on a global scale.

On this basis, by combining direct observations with <b>balance</b> <b>sheets</b> <b>data,</b> and data on employment stock at the firm’s level, the impact of the offshoring decision is evaluated.
