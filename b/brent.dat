5000|$|Regarding <b>Brent's</b> {{ministry}} in St. Stephen's, Frederick Ward Kates (one of <b>Brent's</b> biographers) wrote that <b>Brent's</b> [...] "humble {{work in a}} struggling parish in a crowded neighborhood of underprivileged people proved good schooling for his naturally aristocratic mind. These years deepened not only his ideas of religion but also his insight into human character. … He came to know people, all sorts of people." ...|$|R
50|$|During the 1870s, Thomas Wesley <b>Brents,</b> a {{physician}} who had recently relocated to Spencer, offered his assistance to Burritt, and began raising money for the college. With his help, the campus {{more than doubled in}} size, and a new administration building was constructed. However, <b>Brents</b> demanded he be made president. This angered Carnes, who resigned in 1878, allowing <b>Brents</b> to take over. During his four-year tenure, <b>Brents</b> increased the college's enrollment and overhauled its curriculum. By the time he had resigned in 1882, however, enrollment had started to decline. In subsequent years, the school struggled financially, and was finally forced to close in 1889. The Board of Trustees considered selling the college's campus, but ultimately decided to reopen the school.|$|R

60|$|When Margaret Delandre {{went to live}} at <b>Brent's</b> Rock {{the whole}} {{neighbourhood}} awoke to the pleasure of an entirely new scandal. Scandals in connection with either the Delandre family or the <b>Brents</b> of <b>Brent's</b> Rock, were not few; and if the secret history of the county had been written in full both names would have been found well represented. It {{is true that the}} status of each was so different that they might have belonged to different continents--or to different worlds for the matter of that--for hitherto their orbits had never crossed. The <b>Brents</b> were accorded by the whole section of the country a unique social dominance, and had ever held themselves as high above the yeoman class to which Margaret Delandre belonged, as a blue-blooded Spanish hidalgo out-tops his peasant tenantry.|$|R

50|$|<b>Brent's</b> {{method is}} a {{combination}} of the bisection method, the secant method and inverse quadratic interpolation. At every iteration, <b>Brent's</b> method decides which method out of these three is likely to do best, and proceeds by doing a step according to that method. This gives a robust and fast method, which therefore enjoys considerable popularity.|$|R

5|$|The {{iterative}} algorithms were independently {{published in}} 1975–1976 by American physicist Eugene Salamin and Australian scientist Richard <b>Brent.</b> These avoid reliance on infinite series. An iterative algorithm repeats a specific calculation, each iteration using the outputs from prior steps as its inputs, and produces a result in each step that converges {{to the desired}} value. The approach was actually invented over 160 years earlier by Carl Friedrich Gauss, {{in what is now}} termed the arithmetic–geometric mean method (AGM method) or Gauss–Legendre algorithm. As modified by Salamin and <b>Brent,</b> it is also referred to as the Brent–Salamin algorithm.|$|E
