25|$|Alec Bedser {{dominated}} the England bowling (and the Australian batsmen) {{as much as}} Len Hutton did the batting {{and by the end}} of the tour the Australians rated him the best new-ball bowler in the world. He sent down almost twice as many overs as anybody else in the Tests and took 30 wickets (16.06), including 10/105 in England's final victory at Melbourne. Bedser carried the England bowling on his broad back against in the 1940s and 1950s with a long list of short-term new-ball partners. His huge hands and powerful shoulders allowed him to bowl a lethal combination of in-swingers and leg-cutters off a short run-up and only Keith Miller - briefly - was able to cut loose from his control. In 1950-51 series he did have the support of his captain Freddie Brown, another big medium paced bowler, who surprised everybody by taking 18 wickets (21.61) despite celebrating his 40th birthday on the tour. There was also Trevor Bailey who took 14 wickets (14.14) with his naggingly accurate out-swingers that mirrored his monotonous batting as he settled on containing batsmen, but could be dangerous in the right conditions. After these three the quality of the England bowling dropped dramatically, for which the selectors must bear the brunt of the blame. Doug Wright was a mercurial leg-spinner who the MCC liked sent on tour instead of Jim Laker because he was more suited to the harder wickets abroad. He was potential match-winner, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>liked</b> to buy his wickets and asking him to bowl was always a gamble as he could equally snap up a few quick wickets, concede a slew of runs, or both. Eric Hollies bowled one of the most famous balls in cricket when his googly dismissed Don Bradman for a duck in his last Test innings, but the Warwickshire leg-spinner was not a great turner of the ball, instead relying on line and length. Unfortunately the 1950-51 tour was the first to use extensive air travel. Hollies was scared stiff of flying and had to be drunk before he could get on a plane. He failed to turn the ball on Australian wickets and was kept out of the team by Wright. Roy Tattersall and Bob Berry were off-spinners who were supposed to tie down the Australian batsmen, but like many of their kind failed to adjust to the faster, harder Australian pitches. John Warr quickly proved himself to be the worst player in the team, he took only one test wicket - for 281 runs - when Ian Johnson walked after the umpire declined to give him out, an almost unheard of practice in Australia at the time. He improved his game during the tour, but was never more than a decent county bowler. Let loose from the hard life at Yorkshire and the Army Brian Close was undisciplined and failed on a tour for which he should not have been chosen.|$|E

500|$|After {{failing to}} impress {{a number of}} record companies, most {{recently}} at the Decca audition, Epstein went to the HMV store on Oxford Street in London to transfer the Decca tapes to discs. There, recording engineer Jim Foy referred him to Sid Coleman, who ran EMI's publishing arm. Epstein eventually met with EMI's George Martin, who signed the group to the Parlophone label on a one-year renewable contract. The Beatles' first recording session was scheduled for 6 June 1962 at EMI's Abbey Road Studios in north London. Martin had not been particularly impressed by the band's demo recordings, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>liked</b> the Beatles' personalities when he met them. He concluded that they had raw musical talent, but stated in later interviews that what made the difference for him was their wit and humour.|$|E
500|$|The A.V. Club writer Josh Modell {{said the}} episode [...] "was pretty damn funny, but I'm {{predisposed}} to Butters in general {{as well as}} the wide world of pimping." [...] Wired writer Chris Kohler said the topical and timely jokes in [...] "Butters' Bottom Bitch", such as the satire on ACORN, were a strong example of what kept South Park funny and relevant. Not all reviews were positive. Sean O'Neal, also of The A.V. Club, gave the episode a C grade, and said [...] "It was basically one note held for the run of the ep, in service of a simple little story without many surprises." [...] O'Neal said the subplot involving the police was [...] "similarly repetitious", <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>liked</b> how the two plots came together to resolve each other.|$|E

Sir Henry Wood regarded him as an upstart and was envious of his success; the scrupulous Sir Adrian Boult found him [...] "repulsive" [...] as {{a man and a}} musician; and Sir John Barbirolli mistrusted him. Sir Malcolm Sargent worked with him in founding the London Philharmonic and was a friend and ally, but he was the subject of unkind, though witty, digs from Beecham who, for example, described the image-conscious Herbert von Karajan as [...] "a kind of musical Malcolm Sargent". [...] Beecham's {{relations with}} foreign conductors were often excellent. He did not get on well with Arturo Toscanini, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>liked</b> and encouraged Wilhelm Furtwängler, admired Pierre Monteux, fostered Rudolf Kempe as his successor with the RPO, and was admired by Fritz Reiner, Otto Klemperer and Herbert von Karajan.|$|E

For the main event, James said that [...] "this didn't feel like a ladder match. Dallas simply {{did not take the}} risks needed to show that he really wanted to retain his title". However, he was not disappointed because he did not [...] "expect too much from a Bo Dallas match". James felt that it was a problem to close the show with Dallas-Neville because [...] "the show could only go down" [...] from Cesaro-Zayn. Lastly, James had some technical issues viewing the live stream of the event, where the video paused during the Cesaro-Zayn match, and the feed cut out during Rusev's appearance, but returned before the main event match started.|$|E
500|$|Koshiro's track, [...] "Wrath of the Reset Bomb", {{used the}} motif {{associated}} with Viridi, {{which would be}} reused in multiple tracks. According to Sakurai, it was only intended {{to be used in}} one level, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>liked</b> it so much that he made it the theme for Viridi's Forces of Nature. A track that went through multiple redrafts was [...] "Aurum Island", the theme associated with the titular alien invaders: while every attempt made to create a theme ended up as a [...] "techno-pop song", the tune underwent multiple adjustments so it would not clash {{with the rest of the}} soundtrack while retaining its form. [...] "Lightning Chariot Base", due to the size of the level, was designed so players would notice its presence without growing tired of it. [...] "Practice Arena", the tune for the pre-multiplayer training area, was designed by Takada to have a light, analogue feel; it was originally composed for a different unspecified area, but it was decided that it fitted well with the build-up to a multiplayer match.|$|E
500|$|After {{winning a}} prestigious local talent contest, the Primettes' sights were set on making a record.

Robinson liked [...] "the girls" [...] (as they were then known around Motown) and agreed to help, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>liked</b> their guitarist even more; with the Primettes' permission he hired Tarplin, who became the guitarist for the Miracles. Robinson arranged for the Primettes to audition a cappella for Gordy—but Gordy, feeling the girls too young and inexperienced to be recording artists, encouraged them to return when they had graduated from high school. Undaunted, later that year the Primettes recorded a single for Lu Pine Records, a label created just for them, titled [...] "Tears of Sorrow", which was backed with [...] "Pretty Baby". The single failed to find an audience, however. Shortly thereafter, McGlown became engaged and left the group. Local girl Barbara Martin was McGlown's prompt replacement.|$|E

500|$|In late 1942, Como {{made the}} {{decision}} to quit the Weems band, even if it meant giving up singing. He returned to Canonsburg, his family, and his trade, tired of life on the road without his wife and young son. Como received an offer to become a Frank Sinatra imitator, but chose to keep his own style. While Perry was negotiating for a store lease to re-open a barber shop, he received a call from Tommy Rockwell at General Artists Corporation, who also represented Ted Weems. Como fielded many other calls that also brought offers, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>liked</b> and trusted Rockwell, who was offering him his own sustaining (non-sponsored) Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) radio show and offering to get him a recording contract. The offers were also appealing because it meant staying in New York with no more road tours. As Perry pondered the job offer, Roselle told him, [...] "You can always get another barber shop if it doesn't work out!" [...] Until the radio show and recording contract offers, he did not really view singing as his career, believing the years with Carlone and Weems had been enjoyable, but now {{it was time to get}} back to work. Como said in an 1983 interview, [...] "I thought I'd have my fun and I'd go home to work." ...|$|E
500|$|In early 1998, the Deus Ex team grew to 20 {{people and}} the game entered a 28-month {{production}} phase. Spector hired new staff for his Austin studio and was assigned an art team from Ion Storm's Dallas branch. The development team consisted of three programmers, six designers, seven artists, a writer, an associate producer, a [...] "tech", and Warren Spector, the producer, and director. Two writers and four testers were hired as contractors. Chris Norden was the lead programmer and assistant director, Harvey Smith the lead designer, Jay Lee the lead artist, and Sheldon Pacotti the lead writer. However, Spector's initial management structure, which involved two competing design teams and the matrix management of the Dallas art team, was a failure. According to Spector, the team was interested in multiple video game genres, and it contained both design maximalists who wanted to [...] "do everything" [...] and design minimalists who {{wanted to do a}} few things well. Close friends of the team who understood the intentions behind the game were invited to playtest and give feedback. The wide range of input led to debates in the office and changes to the game. Spector later concluded that the team was [...] "blinded by promises of complete creative freedom", and by their belief that the game would have no budget, marketing or time restraints. By mid-1998, the game's title had become Deus Ex, derived from the Latin literary device deus ex machina ("god from the machine") in which a plot is resolved by an unpredictable intervention. Spector acknowledged its grammatical faults as a title, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>liked</b> it because of its relevance to the in-game struggle for power, to the medium's storytelling difficulties, to the game being played on a computer, and to the [...] "self-referential" [...] acceptance of trying one's best to resolve affairs.|$|E
500|$|Carla Gugino {{revealed}} in August 2009 {{that she had}} begun taking singing lessons for her part in the film. One month later, Jamie Chung announced {{in an interview with}} E! Entertainment that recording for the soundtrack had begun. When Emily Browning auditioned for her role as Babydoll, Snyder asked her to sing because of the musical element in the film. He told her to record herself while singing, and the actress did a version of [...] "Killing Me Softly with His Song". Browning later said, [...] "I was terrified, of course. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>liked</b> it. I have no idea why, but he thought me capable of carrying a tune on the screen." [...] The crew liked the result and offered her to sing more songs. At first it was just a cover of [...] "Where Is My Mind?" [...] by Pixies, which ended up becoming a duet with Yoav, but the producers extended to three songs. One, a version by [...] "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)" [...] by Eurythmics, is used to open the movie, and Bates noted that [...] " [...] first line of dialogue is actually 27 minutes into the film so it is an interesting way to introduce her character." [...] The other came up when during a discussion on her favorite music with Snyder, Browning said that The Smiths was her favorite band. Several weeks later, Snyder informed her that he had acquired the rights to The Smiths' song [...] "Asleep", and asked her if she would like to perform the lead vocals. At first, she hesitated, saying that [...] "The offer was flattering, but there was so much pressure". However, she recorded the song and according to Snyder, The Smiths' frontman Morrissey was happy with the result. Regarding Browning's performance, de Vries considered that [...] "having Emily sing—essentially commenting in song on her character’s situation in the film — provided an interesting texture, real resonance and depth, and tied the music to the visuals in a way that might otherwise not have been so clearly defined", and Snyder found the actress' [...] "emotional delivery" [...] to [...] "make the songs even more poignant". To work with Browning between takes, de Vries used a portable recording rig on a room with a piano - [...] "a very distressed, out-of-tune, almost-unusable instrument (...) which turned out to have real charm in it." ...|$|E
