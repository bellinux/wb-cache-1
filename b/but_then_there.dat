2500|$|After the June 5 sentencing, Walton {{said he was}} {{inclined}} to jail Libby after the defense laid out its proposed appeal, but the judge told attorneys he was open to changing his mind"; however, on June 14, 2007, Walton ordered Libby to report to prison while his attorneys appealed the conviction. [...] Libby's attorneys asked that the order be stayed, but Walton denied the request and told Libby {{that he would have}} 10 days to appeal the ruling. In denying Libby's request, which had questioned Fitzgerald's authority to make the charges in the first place, Walton supported Fitzgerald's authority in the case. He said: [...] "Everyone is accountable, and if you work in the White House, and if it's perceived that somehow (you're) linked at the hip, the American public would have serious questions about the fairness of any investigation of a high-level official conducted by the attorney general." [...] The judge was also responding to an Amicus curiae brief that he had permitted to be filed, which had not apparently convinced him to change his mind, as he subsequently denied Libby bail during his appeal. His [...] "order grant the [...] scholars permission to file their brief..." [...] contained a caustic footnote questioning the motivation of the legal academics and suggesting he might not give a great deal of weight to their opinion ... It is an impressive show of public service when twelve prominent and distinguished current and former law professors are able to amass their collective wisdom in the course of only several days to provide their legal expertise to the court on behalf of a criminal defendant. The Court trusts that this is a reflection of these eminent academics' willingness in the future to step to the plate and provide like assistance in cases involving any of the numerous litigants, both in this Court and throughout the courts of this nation, who lack the financial means to fully and properly articulate the merits of their legal positions even in instances where failure to do so could result in monetary penalties, incarceration, or worse. The Court will certainly not hesitate to call for such assistance from these luminaries, as necessary in the interests of justice and equity, whenever similar questions arise in the cases that come before it." [...] Moreover, when the hearing started, [...] "in the interest of full disclosure," [...] Walton informed the court that he had [...] "received a number of harassing, angry and mean-spirited phone calls and messages. Some wishing bad things on me and my family... hose types of things will have no impact... I initially threw them away, <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>there</b> were more, some that were more hateful... hey are being kept." ...|$|E
