25|$|The Democratic Republican Party (or the Democratic Party) and the Whig Party (which had <b>been</b> <b>pretty</b> well {{destroyed}} {{after the}} 1852 elections) {{had been the}} major political parties in the United States. Corbett had been a Whig and follower of Henry Clay but when the Republican Party was founded on July 6, 1854, in Jackson, Michigan, {{he was one of}} its early and enthusiastic supporters. The Republican Party was founded as the anti-slavery party in opposition to the pro-slavery Democratic Party {{in one of the few}} fundamental reorganizations of the American political system.|$|E

Nottinghamshire Outlaws {{had won the}} toss and bowled first, and ought to have <b>been</b> <b>pretty</b> pleased with restricting the Foxes to 150 for 4, even though they conceded 15 extras. The opening {{partnership}} of HD Ackerman and Darren Maddy for 67 runs had promised more for Leicestershire. However, West Indian Ottis Gibson dug out two early wickets in Graeme Swann and Stephen Fleming - Darren Maddy and David Masters then took wickets at leisure, and Nottinghamshire were 96 for 7. Despite a rescue mission from Gareth Clough who hit 30 off 16 balls, there was no hitting power from the other players, and Nottinghamshire finished on 129 for 8.|$|E

25|$|In 1899 {{the station}} manager, Mr T. Cahill and his stockmen were {{attacked}} by Aborigines {{while they were in}} camp while out mustering. The men had been mustering in an area where a man known as Paddy the Lasher had been murdered two years earlier, and once they had made camp and were sitting down to a meal several spears were thrown at them, hitting none of the men. The party made to defend themselves and the attackers scattered.

[...] Afterward, Ohno said, [...] "I was in the moment at the time. I thought I timed the start just perfect. The starter had <b>been</b> <b>pretty</b> quick all day, so that's why there were so many false starts at the beginning. But that was really good for me." ...|$|E

He held his final campaign event in Dallas outside his headquarters, and thanked his supporters, stating: [...] "What you've been through hasn't <b>been</b> <b>pretty,</b> but by golly, you're taking your country back." [...] At the end, his campaign song [...] "Crazy" [...] by Patsy Cline was played.

500|$|After reading Pride and Prejudice, playwright Richard Sheridan {{advised a}} friend to [...] "uy it immediately" [...] for it [...] "was one of the cleverest things" [...] he had ever read.

[...] She commented that the novel [...] "is the most probable fiction I have ever read" [...] and had become [...] "at present the fashionable novel". The Dowager Lady Vernon told a friend that Mansfield Park was [...] "ot much of a novel, more {{the history of a}} family party in the country, very natural"—as if, comments one Austen scholar, [...] "Lady Vernon's parties mostly featured adultery." [...] Lady Anne Romilly told her friend, the novelist Maria Edgeworth, that [...] " [...] has <b>been</b> <b>pretty</b> generally admired here" [...] and Edgeworth commented later that [...] "we have been much entertained with Mansfield Park".|$|E
500|$|During the {{production}} of Rocko's Modern Life, Martin Olson, one of the writers, read The Intertidal Zone and encouraged Hillenburg to create a television series with a similar concept. At that point, Hillenburg had not even considered creating his own series: [...] "After watching Joe [...] tear his hair out a lot, dealing with all the problems that came up, I thought I {{would never want to}} produce a show of my own." [...] However, he realized that if he ever did, this would be the best approach: [...] "For all those years it seemed like I was doing these two totally separate things. I wondered what it all meant. I didn't see a synthesis. It was great when [...] all came together in [...] I felt relieved that I hadn't wasted a lot of time doing something that I then abandoned to do something else. It has <b>been</b> <b>pretty</b> rewarding," [...] Hillenburg said in 2002. He claimed that he finally decided to create a series as he was driving to the beach on the Santa Monica Freeway one day.|$|E

On {{the topic of}} O'Malley's longtime crush on Meredith in the second season, Knight said: [...] "What's {{going to be very}} interesting to see is what he's going to do with Meredith. It's getting close to time. Whatever he chooses to do will inform who he is the rest of his life." [...] After their sexual encounter occurred onscreen, Knight {{said in an interview with}} Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune: [...] "George wasn't really paying full attention. He was letting his own feelings override his respect for Meredith. A person really clued in would get that there wasn't anything coming back, but he was so in his head about it and caught up in his own feelings that he wasn't listening. It's not just that he loves her...it's a kind of selfish love he had for her." [...] He also added that, [...] "I think George has a lot of growing up to do. Part of that is making horrible, stupid mistakes. He's <b>been</b> <b>pretty</b> sheltered." ...|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Isaac Hempstead-Wright, who portrays Bran Stark in the series, Wright {{was asked about the}} significance of Bran witnessing the scene at the Tower of Joy, saying [...] "I don't think Bran knows why this is significant, but he knows that it is significant because he wouldn't have seen it if it wasn't earth-shattering, because everything we've learned so far during his visions has <b>been</b> <b>pretty</b> big and important, from the creation of the first White Walker to the origins of Hodor. This is clearly another important milestone in the history of Westeros. For Bran, he sat there sitting, 'This isn't my brother. This is my cousin somehow, but who's the dad? And why have I been shown this? If I find out who the dad is and why I need to know who the dad is, then let Jon know quick.'" [...] The scene reveals neither Lyanna Stark's son's name nor his father's, with the transition between the newborn's face and Jon Snow's visually conveying the identity. HBO released an infographic shortly after the episode aired, confirming Ned Stark as Jon's guardian, and Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen as his parents.|$|E
500|$|The {{concert was}} {{entitled}} [...] "Money Can't Buy" [...] as no tickets were {{made available for}} purchase publicly; only competition winners and guests with invitations were allowed to attend the show. Additionally, Minogue donated two tickets to the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC). These tickets were auctioned at a charity ball for the society's [...] "Full Stop" [...] campaign. The Sydney Morning Herald found it surprising that Minogue chose to perform in an [...] "intimate" [...] setting as she had chiefly embarked on large arena tours in the past. The newspaper felt it was similar to Madonna's decision to perform at a small show at Brixton Academy, London, in 2000. Before the show, Minogue held a media press conference and discussed the development of Money Can't Buy, saying: [...] "It's <b>been</b> <b>pretty</b> intense. I'm trying to look pretty calm {{but it has been}} an intense few weeks leading up to this. There's going to be a few old , but they're not-very-oldies. We're stepping marginally back in time. It's always difficult choosing which songs to play from the new album and then what's going to work. There's a couple of surprises in store and there's a couple of real ‘train spotter' surprises." ...|$|E
500|$|Selman {{told the}} Los Angeles Times that the episode praises {{collaborative}} writing, and answers {{the question of}} whether or not writing in a group is as valuable as writing alone. He commented: [...] "I've been with The Simpsons for 15 years and [...] it's <b>been</b> <b>pretty</b> much writing as a team. We’re proud of what we've done even if it's not the traditional idea of one writer sitting down with a passion and a vision. In a strange way this episode ends up as a defense of writing in a group and celebrating the way it makes you feel connected to the work and to the people in that group in ways you didn't expect. It's all about a writers room ... and you know, in the story, Homer's cynical heist team does end up being incredibly productive." [...] The episode features several references to literature and parodies several popular young-adult book series, particularly Twilight, a vampire-themed fantasy book series by Stephenie Meyer that has received much popularity. While chasing T. R. Francis through the stadium where the dinosaur show took place, Lisa passes a bathroom in which a group of dinosaurs are smoking in reference to a Far Side comic of dinosaurs smoking. The dinosaur show itself, Sitting with Dinosaurs, is based on the live Walking with Dinosaurs show.|$|E

500|$|Despite general favor from female viewers' perspective, {{reaction}} from most male viewers was negative. The music video {{was presented to}} a crowd during a promotional party at the Chelsea nightclub Centro-Fly, thrown in celebration of Voodoos January 2000 release. According to a New York Times correspondent, one female viewer at the party [...] "recalled sitting at home, staring at the video, while her boyfriend snapped, 'Turn the channel — I don't {{want to see that}} gay stuff'". D'Angelo made an appearance at the WQHT Hot 97 studio as the DJ's Angie Martinez and Funkmaster Flex fielded calls from listeners about the video. Tracy Cloherty, program director for the radio station at the time, later commented on the divided reaction to the music video in an interview for The New York Times in 2000, stating [...] "Of course, most of the women loved it. Some of the men said things like: 'We don't wanna see that kind of stuff. Why do {{we have to look at}} that?' Men definitely seem to be threatened by male nudity". Some viewers and music writers have attributed the male discomfort of the video to fear of male sexual objectification and homophobia. In a 2000 phone interview for The New York Times, D'Angelo maintained a neutral attitude towards general viewer opinion of the video, stating [...] "With men, if there's any negative reaction, I'm not really going to get an honest feedback ... women love it, most definitely. But for me personally, the response I've got from both men and women has <b>been</b> <b>pretty</b> cool".|$|E

[...] Digital Spy also noted chemistry between AJ and Roxy, saying they [...] "clearly enjoy each other's company". Tony Stewart from the Daily Mirror said the relationship between Roxy and AJ is [...] "played for laughs", contrasting with Roxy's relationship with Michael Moon (Steve John Shepherd).|$|E
