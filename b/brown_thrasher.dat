5|$|The {{species was}} first named Toxostoma curvirostre by William John Swainson in 1827. Since then, six {{subspecies}} have been recognized, {{and have been}} divided into two branches. Genetic {{research has indicated that}} the curve-billed thrasher is the sister species of a clade consisting of the ocellated thrasher, <b>brown</b> <b>thrasher,</b> long-billed thrasher, and Cozumel thrasher. This contrasts with an earlier suggestion that curve-billed and ocellated thrashers are closest relatives.|$|E
5|$|Both {{male and}} female mockingbirds sing, with the latter being {{generally}} quieter and less vocal. Male commencement of singing is in late January to February and continues into the summer and the establishing of territory into the fall. Frequency in female singing is more sporadic, as it sings less often {{in the summer and}} fall, and only sings when the male is away from the territory. The mockingbird also possesses a large song repertoire that ranges from 43 to 203 song types and the size varies by region. Repertoire sizes ranged from 14 to 150 types in Texas, and two studies of mockingbirds in Florida rounded estimates to 134 and 200, approximately. It continually expands its repertoire during its life, though it pales in comparison to mimids such as the <b>brown</b> <b>thrasher.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The ground, {{with its}} limited boundaries, hard outfield and {{excellent}} pitch, has seen many high scores during the festival. [...] The Surrey dynamo Ali <b>Brown</b> <b>thrashed</b> 133 in company with Graham Thorpe (102*) to help Surrey to 375 for 4 in just 40 overs in a Sunday League match in 1994 while Yorkshire themselves clobbered Nottinghamshire for 352 in 45 overs in 2001 thanks to Darren Lehmann's incredible 191 which came off 103 balls in 115 minutes with 20 fours and 11 sixes.|$|R

25|$|Canoe Creek State park is on {{the path}} {{followed}} by many species of migratory birds including waterfowl, bald eagles and ospreys. The wetlands provide habitat for birds like the bluebird, oriole, red-winged blackbird and the <b>brown</b> <b>thrasher.</b>|$|E
25|$|Since 1970, {{reduction}} of farmland {{has resulted in}} reduced environment for, and reduced numbers of various shrubland birds including the American woodcock, <b>brown</b> <b>thrasher,</b> eastern towhee, willow flycatcher, golden-winged warbler, blue-winged warbler, field sparrow, and Baltimore oriole.|$|E
25|$|Nyssa sylvatica is an {{important}} food source for many migrating birds in the fall. Its early color change (foliar fruit flagging) is thought to attract birds to the available fruit, which ripen before many other fall fruits and berries. The fruit is quite marked, dark blue, in clusters of two or three. The sour fruits are eagerly sought by many kinds of birds, including: American robin, Swainson's thrush, gray-cheeked thrush, hermit thrush, wood thrush, northern cardinal, northern mockingbird, blue jay, red-bellied woodpecker, yellow-bellied sapsucker, northern flicker, pileated woodpecker, eastern phoebe, <b>brown</b> <b>thrasher,</b> eastern bluebird, European starling, scarlet tanager, gray catbird, cedar waxwing, and American crow, all primarily eastern North American birds migrating or residing year-round within the tree's range.|$|E
2500|$|The {{nickname}} [...] "Thrashers," [...] after Georgia's state bird, the <b>brown</b> <b>thrasher,</b> {{was selected}} from a fan poll. [...] "Thrashers" [...] had actually been runner-up to [...] "Flames" [...] in the poll (as a homage to the old Atlanta Flames), and Philips Arena, the Thrashers' new home, {{was built on the}} site of the former Omni, which had been home to the Flames. By coincidence, the first encampment (circa 1839) which would later become Atlanta was called Thrasherville, and a historical marker of this is located just down from the arena in front of the State Bar of Georgia (the former home of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta).|$|E
60|$|Here Tennyson is so merged in {{his subject}} as {{to produce the}} {{impression}} that the lyric must have been written not by an aged poet but by the bird himself. Reading the poem one seems to hear the <b>brown</b> <b>thrasher</b> on a twig of the wild-apple tree, pouring his heart out over the thicket which his mate has just chosen for a nesting place.|$|E
6000|$|There {{might be}} seen here {{on the bank of}} the Merrimack, near Goff's Falls, in what is now the town of Bedford, famous [...] "for hops and for its fine {{domestic}} manufactures," [...] some graves of the aborigines. The land still bears this scar here, and time is slowly crumbling the bones of a race. Yet, without fail, every spring, since they first fished and hunted here, the <b>brown</b> <b>thrasher</b> has heralded the morning from a birch or alder spray, and the undying race of reed-birds still rustles through the withering grass. But these bones rustle not. These mouldering elements are slowly preparing for another metamorphosis, to serve new masters, and what was the Indian's will erelong be the white man's sinew.|$|E
6000|$|Early in May, the oaks, hickories, maples, {{and other}} trees, just putting out amidst the pine woods around the pond, {{imparted}} a brightness like sunshine to the landscape, especially in cloudy days, {{as if the}} sun were breaking through mists and shining faintly on the hillsides here and there. On {{the third or fourth}} of May I saw a loon in the pond, and {{during the first week of}} the month I heard the whip-poor-will, the <b>brown</b> <b>thrasher,</b> the veery, the wood pewee, the chewink, and other birds. I had heard the wood thrush long before. The ph≈ìbe had already come once more and looked in at my door and window, to see if my house was cavern-like enough for her, sustaining herself on humming wings with clinched talons, as if she held by the air, while she surveyed the premises. The sulphur-like pollen of the pitch pine soon covered the pond and the stones and rotten wood along the shore, so that you could have collected a barrelful. This is the [...] "sulphur showers" [...] we hear of. Even in Calidas' drama of Sacontala, we read of [...] "rills dyed yellow with the golden dust of the lotus." [...] And so the seasons went rolling on into summer, as one rambles into higher and higher grass.|$|E
50|$|The <b>brown</b> <b>thrasher</b> is {{the state}} bird of Georgia. The <b>brown</b> <b>thrasher</b> also was the {{inspiration}} for the name of Atlanta's former National Hockey League team, the Atlanta Thrashers.|$|E
50|$|The <b>brown</b> <b>thrasher</b> (Toxostoma rufum) is {{a bird in}} {{the family}} Mimidae, which also {{includes}} the New World catbirds and mockingbirds. The dispersal of the <b>brown</b> <b>thrasher</b> is abundant throughout the eastern and central United States, southern and central Canada, {{and is the only}} thrasher to live primarily east of the Rockies and central Texas. It is the state bird of Georgia.|$|E
50|$|The long-billed thrasher (Toxostoma longirostre) is a {{medium-sized}} resident songbird of South Texas and eastern Mexico. It bears a strong resemblance to its close relative the <b>brown</b> <b>thrasher</b> in appearance, calls, {{and various other}} behaviors; however, the two species do not overlap in range except in the winter when the <b>brown</b> <b>thrasher</b> will temporarily reside in the northern range of the long-billed.|$|E

50|$|The <b>brown</b> <b>thrasher</b> {{utilizes}} {{its vision}} while scouring for food. It usually forages for food under leaves, brushes, and soil debris {{on the ground}} using its bill. It then swipes the floor in side-to-side motions, and investigates the area it recently foraged in. The <b>brown</b> <b>thrasher</b> forages in a similar method to the Long-billed thrasher and Bendire's thrasher (T. longirostre & bendirei), picking food {{off the ground and}} under leaf litter, whereas thrashers with sharply decurved bills are more likely to dig into the ground to obtain food. Foraging success is 25% greater in dry leaf litter as compared to damp leaf letter. The <b>brown</b> <b>thrasher</b> can also hammer nuts such as acorns in order to remove the shell. It has also been noted for its flexibility in catching quick insects, as the amount of vertebrae in its neck exceeds giraffes and camels. In one case, a <b>brown</b> <b>thrasher</b> was observed to dig a hole about 1.5 cm deep, place an acorn in it and hit the acorn until it cracked, considered to be a form of tool usage. In a laboratory experiment, a <b>brown</b> <b>thrasher</b> was found to be able to discern and reject the toxic eastern newt (Notophthalmus viridescens) and a palatable mimic of that species, the red salamander (Pseudotriton ruber), but continued to eat palatable dusky salamanders (Desmognathus spp.).|$|E

50|$|The <b>brown</b> <b>thrasher</b> {{resides in}} various habitats. It prefers {{to live in}} {{woodland}} edges, thickets and dense brush, often searching for food in dry leaves on the ground. It can also inhabit areas that are agricultural and near suburban areas, but {{is less likely to}} live near housing than other bird species. The <b>brown</b> <b>thrasher</b> often vies for habitat and potential nesting grounds with other birds, which is usually initiated by the males.|$|E
50|$|The <b>brown</b> <b>thrasher</b> {{has been}} {{observed}} either solo or in pairs. The <b>brown</b> <b>thrasher</b> is usually an elusive bird, and maintains its evasiveness with low-level flying. When it feels bothered, it usually hides into thickets and gives cackling calls. Thrashers {{spend most of their}} time on ground level or near it. When seen, it is commonly the males that are singing from unadorned branches. The <b>brown</b> <b>thrasher</b> has been noted for having an aggressive behavior, and is a staunch defender of its nest. However, the name does not come from attacking perceived threats, but is believed to have come from the thrashing sound the bird makes when digging through ground debris. It is also thought that the name comes from the thrashing sound that is made while it is smashing large insects to kill and eventually eat.|$|E
50|$|The song is {{described}} as a rich varied warbling, slightly scratchy with little repetition. Bond described its alarm note being similar to the <b>brown</b> <b>thrasher.</b>|$|E

50|$|Genetic {{studies have}} found that the <b>brown</b> <b>thrasher</b> is most closely related to the long-billed and Cozumel thrashers (T. longirostre & guttatum), within the genus Toxostoma.|$|E
50|$|The <b>brown</b> <b>thrasher</b> {{is bright}} reddish-brown above with thin, dark streaks on its buffy underparts. It has a whitish-colored chest with {{distinguished}} teardrop-shaped markings on its chest. Its long, rufous tail is rounded with paler corners, and eyes are a brilliant yellow. Its bill is brownish, long, and curves downward. Both male and females {{are similar in}} appearance. The juvenile appearance of the <b>brown</b> <b>thrasher</b> from the adult is not remarkably different, except for plumage texture, indiscreet upper part markings, and the irises having an olive color.|$|E
50|$|The <b>brown</b> <b>thrasher</b> {{methods of}} {{defending}} itself include using its bill, which can inflict significant damage to species smaller than it, along with wing-flapping and vocal expressions.|$|E

50|$|Along {{with the}} <b>brown</b> <b>thrasher</b> and Cozumel thrasher, the three {{are part of}} a {{superspecies}} rufum clade. Plumage patterns and bill shapes were originally used for grouping, and the birds also were shown as closely related with genetic studies.|$|E
50|$|About 347 {{bird species}} make {{their home in}} Georgia. Many of these birds are migratory. These species are divided into four categories: {{permanent}} residents birds, summer-breeding birds, winter residents and spring/fall migrants. Species of birds in Georgia are the <b>brown</b> <b>thrasher,</b> Georgia's state bird and the northern bobwhite, the state gamebird.|$|E
50|$|The <b>brown</b> <b>thrasher</b> is an omnivore, {{with its}} diet ranging from insects to fruits and nuts. The usual nesting areas are shrubs, small trees, or at times on ground level. Brown thrashers are {{generally}} inconspicuous but territorial birds, especially when defending their nests, and will attack species {{as large as}} humans.|$|E
50|$|This bird {{is closely}} related to the long-billed and <b>brown</b> <b>thrasher.</b> It has been {{generally}} described as shy, but there have been descriptions to the contrary. It was once abundant throughout Cozumel before two hurricanes greatly affected its numbers. Invasive species are also thought to have impacted the population of the thrasher.|$|E
50|$|Pondberry fruit are {{eaten by}} hermit thrushes, {{northern}} cardinals, and perhaps other birds. Animals observed to consume pondberry seeds {{located on a}} cleared soil surface in a hardwood forest included: northern cardinal, <b>brown</b> <b>thrasher</b> (Toxostoma rufum), swamp rabbit (Sylvilagus aquaticus), armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus), and gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis). Swamp rabbits have been observed browsing on stems.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>brown</b> <b>thrasher</b> was {{originally}} described by Linnaeus in his 18th century work Systema Naturae as Turdus rufus. The genus name Toxostoma {{comes from the}} Ancient Greek toxon, [...] "bow" [...] or [...] "arch" [...] and stoma, [...] "mouth". The specific rufum is Latin for [...] "red", but covers {{a wider range of}} hues than the English term.|$|E
50|$|Pokeweed berries are {{reported}} {{to be a good}} food source for songbirds such as gray catbird (Dumetella carolinensis), northern mockingbird (Mimus polyglottos), northern cardinal (Cardinalis cardinals), and <b>brown</b> <b>thrasher</b> (Toxostoma rufum), other bird species including mourning dove (Zenaida macroura), and cedar waxwing (Bombycilla cedrorum), and small mammals apparently tolerant of its toxins, including raccoon, opossum, red and gray fox, and the white-footed mouse.|$|E
5000|$|A gray catbird's song {{is easily}} {{distinguished}} {{from that of}} the northern mockingbird (Mimus polyglottos) or <b>brown</b> <b>thrasher</b> (Toxostoma rufum) because the mockingbird repeats its phrases or [...] "strophes" [...] 3 to 4 times, the thrasher usually twice, but the catbird sings most phrases only once. The catbird's song is usually described as more raspy and less musical than that of a mockingbird.|$|E
50|$|It has simple {{leaves on}} green to red or purplish stems {{and a large}} white taproot. The flowers are green to white, {{followed}} by purple to almost black berries which are a food source for songbirds such as gray catbird, northern mockingbird, northern cardinal, and <b>brown</b> <b>thrasher,</b> {{as well as other}} birds and some small animals (i.e., to species that are unaffected by its mammalian toxins).|$|E
