40|$|We {{presented}} {{a case of}} penile torsion due to previous hypospadias surgery. A patient applied to our clinic for treatment of hypospadias fistula and accompanying penile torsion. Patient’s urethral fistula was repaired first and penile torsion was corrected in the second stage due to multiple fistula tracts. Proximal based flip flap technique was used for closure of the fistula and simple degloving with release of fibrous tissue and pedicle of the previous preputial island flap was used for correction of the penile torsion.

40|$|The buried penis is {{an unusual}} anomaly, whose {{etiology}} is not fully understood. The fascia Dartos is not developed to its normal elastic configuration {{that would allow the}} free sliding of the skin over the deeper layers of the penis. These non-elastic fibers retract the extension of the penis, which has an appropriate length. Other conditions that promote the hidden penis: deficit of penile skin, abnormal adhesion of the tunica albuginea to the <b>Buck</b> <b>fascia,</b> excessive pre-pubic fat. Among complications associated we found recurrent balanitis. The Paediatricians must diagnose and guide early. It is a benign disease and the surgery is justified, with excellent outcome, immediate results and few complications...|$|E
50|$|An {{injury to}} the urethra leaving <b>Buck's</b> <b>fascia</b> intact results in a {{collection}} of urine (extravasation) limited to the penis, deep to <b>Buck's</b> <b>fascia.</b> However, if the {{injury to the}} bulb of the penis results in urethral injury accompanying a tear of the <b>Buck's</b> <b>fascia,</b> then extravasated blood and urine would accumulate in the superficial perineal space, passing into the penis (outer to <b>Buck's</b> <b>fascia)</b> as well as the scrotum and lower anterior abdominal wall. Extravasation of urine involving a compromised <b>Buck's</b> <b>fascia</b> can be appreciated clinically by blood collecting in the superficial pouch, resulting in a 'butterfly'-shaped region around the penis.|$|R

30|$|Urethritis may {{be further}} {{complicated}} by a periurethral abscess through infection of Littré's glands. Since the penile tunica albuginea prevents the dorsal spread of infection, abscesses tends to track ventrally along the corpus spongiosum.

50|$|Deep fascia is a {{layer of}} dense fibrous {{connective}} tissue which surrounds individual muscles, and also divide groups of muscles into fascial compartments.This fascia has a high density of elastin fibre that determines its extensibility or resilience. Deep fascia was originally considered to be essentially avascular. However, more recent investigations confirmed a rich presence of thin blood vessels. Deep fascia is also richly supplied with sensory receptors. Examples of deep fascia are fascia lata, fascia cruris, brachial fascia, plantar fascia, thoracolumbar <b>fascia</b> and <b>Buck's</b> <b>fascia.</b>|$|R

This study reports our experience in management of penile augmentation complications associated with selfpenile injection of silicone liquid. After a careful ultrasound study, the penile skin was excised through a circumferential sub-coronal incision and dissected with the silicon mass. Histology was well-compatible with silicone granulomas. The patient was discharged after 24 hours.

40|$|Knowledge of penile {{embryology}} and anatomy {{is essential}} to any pediatric urologist in order to fully understand and treat congenital anomalies. Sex differentiation of the external genitalia occurs between the 7 thand 17 th weeks of gestation. The Y chromosome initiates male differentiation through the SRY gene, which triggers testicular development. Under the influence of androgens produced by the testes, external genitalia then develop into the penis and scrotum. Dorsal nerves supply penile skin sensation and lie within <b>Buck's</b> <b>fascia.</b> These nerves are notably absent at the 12 o'clock position. Perineal nerves supply skin sensation to the ventral shaft skin and frenulum. Cavernosal nerves lie within the corpora cavernosa and are responsible for sexual function. Paired cavernosal, dorsal, and bulbourethral arteries have extensive anastomotic connections. During erection, the cavernosal artery causes engorgement of the cavernosa, while the deep dorsal artery leads to glans enlargement. The majority of venous drainage occurs through a single, deep dorsal vein into which multiple emissary veins from the corpora and circumflex veins from the spongiosum drain. The corpora cavernosa and spongiosum are all made of spongy erectile tissue. <b>Buck's</b> <b>fascia</b> circumferentially envelops all three structures, splitting into two leaves ventrally at the spongiosum. The male urethra is composed of six parts: bladder neck, prostatic, membranous, bulbous, penile, and fossa navicularis.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the outcomes of the modified Nesbit procedure using different techniques for dissecting the neurovascular bundle (NVB) to correct ventral congenital penile curvatures (CPCs). The bundle was mobilized using the medial and lateral dissection technique in 21 (Group 1) and 13 (Group 2) patients, respectively. In the medial technique, <b>Buck's</b> <b>fascia</b> is opened at the dorsal side of the penis, the deep dorsal vein is removed at the most prominent site of the curvature and a diamond-shaped tunica albuginea (TA) is excised from the midline of the penis. In the lateral technique, the bundle is mobilized using a longitudinal lateral incision of the <b>Buck's</b> <b>fascia</b> above the urethra at the 5 and 7 o'clock positions via a bilateral approach. The localization and degree of curvature was evaluated using the combined intracavernous injection stimulation test or from the patients' photographs. The mean patient age and degree of curvature were similar between groups. The mean operation time was longer for Group 2 (P = 0. 01). In Group 1, nine patients (42. 8 %) required one diamond excision, 10 (47. 6 %) required two diamond excisions and two (9. 5 %) required more than two excisions; in Group 2, six patients (46. 2 %) required two diamond excisions and seven patients (53. 8 %) required more than two diamond excisions (P = 0. 019). The differences in penile shortening, penile straightening and numbness of the glans penis were not statistically significant. Medial dissection of the bundle for the modified Nesbit procedure reduces the number of diamond-shaped removals of TA and thus shortens operation time in comparison with its lateral counterpart...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBuried penis is a {{congenital}} anomaly {{in which the}} penis is normal in size but appears to be small (i. e., the external genitalia appear small). This anomaly is usually associated with inadequate outer penile skin, fibrosis of the Dartos fascia, inadequate subcutaneous attachment to <b>Buck's</b> <b>fascia,</b> and narrow opening of the prepuce. Various systems {{have been used to}} classify this anomaly and its related conditions. Several symptoms such as difficulty maintaining hygiene and holding the penis during voiding, balanitis, urinary tract infection, and embarrassment when naked have been reported. Adults may present with painful erection, sexual embarrassment, and difficulty with vaginal penetration. Several surgical techniques have been developed to correct this anomaly. Most studies have suggested early surgery. Accurately diagnosing the anomaly and avoiding circumcision are crucial in these patients...|$|R
40|$|Penile torsion can be {{congenital}} {{and associated}} with hypospadias and chordee, {{or can be}} acquired after circumcision. The incidence of isolated neonatal penile torsion was 1. 7 to 27 % in the literature. The majority were between 10 and deg; and 20 and deg;. Generally, torsion was to the left in cases. The techniques for correction of penile torsion described in the literature are penile de-gloving and reattaching of skin, resection of <b>Buck's</b> <b>fascia</b> incising {{the base of the}} penis and removing angular ellipses of corporeal tissue with subsequent plication of tunica, and dorsal dartos flap rotation in severe cases.

40|$|In the {{treatment}} of urethral stricture, Buccal Mucosa Graft (BMG) and reconstruction is applied with different patch techniques. Recently often prefered, this approach is, in bulber urethra strictures of BMG’s; by “ventral onley”, in pendulous urethra because of thinner spingiosis body, which provides support and nutrition of graft; by means of “dorsal inley” being anastomosis. In the research that Cordon et al. did, they compared conventional BMJ “onley” urethroplast and “pseudo-spongioplasty” which base on periurethral vascular tissues to be nourished by closing onto graft.

40|$|Fracture of the penis, a {{relatively}} uncommon emergency in Urology, consists in the traumatic rupture of the tunica albuginea of the corpus cavernosum.

40|$|A 22 -year-old man {{reported}} cracking sound and acute pain during sexual intercourse followed by rapid penile detumescence and ecchymosis. He experienced more pain {{because he could}} not urinate and had a palpably full bladder. Moreover, his urethra was bleeding. Physical examination revealed swollen, ecchymotic and deviated penis and penis ultrasonography showed an injury of the tunica albuginea and <b>Buck's</b> <b>fascia</b> with an expanding hematoma. Suprapubic catheter was positioned. Surgical exploration revealed a tear of tunica albuginea of both corpora cavernosa and complete urethral dissection. End-to-end urethral anastomosis and suture of corpora cavernosa lesion were performed. Vescical catheter was mantained for 6 days and suprapubic catheter for 3 months to allow a complete urethral healing. A pseudodiverticulum was found at anastomosis level on the urethrocistography 1 month after surgery. It disappeared by allowing micturition via the suprapubic catheter. The patient presented regular urinary flow and physiological erections 30 days later. In our experience, prompt surgical repair preserved erectile function and keeping the suprapubic catheter protected the urethra; this was the correct management for repairing the urethral lesion. © 2013 Canadian Urological Association...|$|R
40|$|A 42 -year-old man {{was hospitalized}} with urinary {{retention}} due to strangulation of the penis in December, 1981. He placed {{a stainless steel}} ring {{on the base of}} the penis to prolong erection one month earlier, but subsequent penile edema made it impossible to remove the ring. On admission the penis was extremely swollen (15 cm in length and 7 cm in diameter). Gangrenous patches covered the surface of the penis almost completely and the ring had cut through all the tissues superficial to <b>Buck's</b> <b>fascia.</b> Even slight tension would have probably divided the penis at the site of obstruction and we thought that amputation would be necessary. However, we decided to try conservative therapy since pulsation was felt in the glans. A high-speed airdriven drill with a diamond tip was used to sever the ring. This took ninety minutes. The ring was 2 cm in diameter. The wound was sutured in one layer after through debridement. The skin ulceration healed slowly and a urethral fistula was present in the penoscrotal region until the 66 th postoperative day when it closed spontaneously.

40|$|Objective: Disadvantages of {{two-stage}} hypospadias repair are {{the necessity}} of 2 or 3 surgeries, loss of time/money, complications like splaying of the stream, dribbling of urine or ejaculate and milking of the ejaculate due to a poor-quality urethra. The current article details our modifications of flap repair allowing to manage such patients in one stage and reducing the complications. Subjects and methods: Twenty one patients (aged 2 – 23 years, between January 2006 and June 2012 mean 11. 5 years) of severe hypospadias were managed with flap tube urethroplasty combined with TIP since June 2006 and June 2012. Curvature was corrected by penile de-gloving, mobilization of urethral plate/urethra with corpus spongiosum and transecting urethral plate at corona. <b>Buck's</b> <b>fascia</b> was dissected between the corporeal bodies and superficial corporotomies were done as required. Mobilized urethral plate was tubularized to reconstruct proximal urethra up to peno-scrotal junction and distal tube was reconstructed with raised inner preputial flap after measuring adequacy of skin width. Both neo-urethrae were anastomosed in elliptical shape and covered with spongiosum. Distal anastomosis was done 5 – 8  mm proximal to tip of glans preventing protrusion of skin on glans. Tubularized urethral plate was covered by spongioplasty. Skin tube was covered by dartos pedicle and fixed to corpora. Scrotoplasty was done in layers, covering the anastomosis. Results: Type of hypospadias was scrotal 10, perineo-scrotal 5, penoscrotal 4 and proximal penile in 2 cases. Chordee (severe 15 and moderate 6) correction was possible penile de-gloving with mobilization of urethral plate with spongiosum after dividing urethral plate at corona 8, next 5 cases required dissection of corporal bodies, superficial corporotomy 5 and 3 cases lateral dissection of <b>Buck's</b> <b>fascia.</b> Length of tubularized urethral plate varied from 3 to 5  cm and flap tube varied from 5. 5 to 13  cm (average 7. 5  cm). Complications were fistula 2, meatal stenosis 1, and dilated distal urethra 1 with overall success rate of 81 %. None of them had residual curvature, torsion, splaying or dribbling urine in follow up of 10 – 36 (average 18) months. Conclusions: TIPU with spongioplasty of proximal urethra and dartos cover on skin tube reconstructs functional urethra. Distal end skin sutured to glans mucosa 5 – 8  mm proximal {{to the tip of}} glans reconstructs a cosmetically normal looking meatus.
