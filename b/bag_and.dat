40|$|Abstract. To improve weak {{classifiers}} <b>bagging</b> <b>and</b> boosting {{could be}} used. These techniques {{are based on}} combining classifiers. Usually, a simple majority vote or a weighted majority vote are used as combining rules in <b>bagging</b> <b>and</b> boosting. However, other combining rules such as mean, product and average are possible. In this paper, we study <b>bagging</b> <b>and</b> boosting in Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) {{and the role of}} combining rules in <b>bagging</b> <b>and</b> boosting. Simulation studies, carried out for two artificial data sets and one real data set, show that <b>bagging</b> <b>and</b> boosting might be useful in LDA: bagging for critical training sample sizes and boosting for large training sample sizes. In contrast to a common opinion, we demonstrate that the usefulness of boosting does not directly depend on the instability of a classifier. It is also shown that the choice of the combining rule may affect the performance of <b>bagging</b> <b>and</b> boosting. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we present an {{improvement}} of the precision of classification algorithm results. Two various approaches are known: <b>bagging</b> <b>and</b> boosting. This paper describes a set of experiments with <b>bagging</b> <b>and</b> boosting methods. Our use of these methods aims at classification algorithms generating decision trees. Results of performance tests focused {{on the use of}} the <b>bagging</b> <b>and</b> boosting methods in connection with binary decision trees are presented. The minimum number of decision trees, which enables an {{improvement of the}} classification performed by the <b>bagging</b> <b>and</b> boosting methods, was found. The tests were carried out using the Reuter’s 21578 collection of documents as well as documents from an Internet portal of TV broadcasting company Markíza. The comparison of our results on testing the <b>bagging</b> <b>and</b> boosting algorithms is presented. 1...|$|R

5|$|The ships {{would have}} been {{similarly}} equipped to the preceding Deutschland-class ships. The ships would have mounted six of the same /52 C/28 quick-firing guns in the same triple turret mounts. The guns had an actual bore diameter of , and fired both armor-piercing and high-explosive shells; both shells weighed 300kg (661.4lb). The guns used two sets of propellant charges: a 36.0kg (79.4lb) fore charge in a silk <b>bag</b> <b>and</b> a 71.0kg (156.6lb) main charge in a brass case. The shells were fired at 910meters per second (2,986fps), and at maximum elevation of 40degrees, a range of 36,475m (39,890yards). The guns had a rate of fire of 2.5 rounds per minute. However, eight guns were considered, had there been a quadruple turret available. The guns were supplied {{by a total of}} 900 shells, for a total of 150 rounds per gun.|$|E
5|$|The {{succeeding}} year, {{the only}} time since 1851, the school did not hold a commencement.

When the school board was alerted of the matter, it attempted to censor the edition, passing a resolution requiring the Green Bag to be reviewed by Principal Francis A. Soper. However, the year book had already been printed, and the editors refused to have the edition censored and reprinted. The school board responded by withholding the diplomas of six of the editors of the Green <b>Bag</b> <b>and</b> the business manager, and by preventing the school from holding a commencement ceremony. One of the boys expelled, Clarence Keating Bowie, {{became a member of the}} school board in 1926.|$|E
5|$|In {{his search}} for the lime, Scott discovers a strange, {{swirling}} cloud of dust that absorbs moisture. He follows it until he collapses {{in front of a}} lake bed. He has a brief hallucination where he engages in a spiritual conversation with a priest he knew on Earth. Meanwhile, the cloud moves up to him and condenses into water, waking him. Realizing what he's found, Scott shovels as much of the lime as possible into his <b>bag</b> <b>and</b> makes his way to the Gate. Greer, having set out to look for him, finds him along the way and helps carry the lime. Wallace sticks his arm into the wormhole to delay the countdown. The team returns with the lime successfully, which is used to repair the CO2 scrubbers. In the end, a recovering Scott tells Chloe that his parents and the priest died when he was young, and {{that the best way to}} deal with the grief is to keep moving forward. As everyone starts to breathe easier, a ship detaches itself from the Destiny.|$|E

5|$|The androids {{threaten}} to decapitate Reinette, but the Doctor on Arthur crashes through {{the mirror to}} save her. The androids give up and shut down when the Doctor tells them that they now cannot return to their ship to finish the repairs. Reinette tells the Doctor that she had her fireplace moved to Versailles {{in the hope that}} he would return. The Doctor finds that the fireplace is still an operating time window and uses it to return to the spaceship. He tells Reinette to pack a <b>bag</b> <b>and</b> prepare to leave. The Doctor returns to the fireplace seconds later but discovers that seven years have passed in Reinette's time. King Louis XV finds the Doctor, tells him that Reinette has died and gives him a letter in which Reinette expresses her hopes for the Doctor's quick return and confesses her love for him. The Doctor returns to the TARDIS and watches the time windows close before leaving the ship. The TARDIS crew muse about the reasons the androids wanted Madame de Pompadour's brain to complete their repairs, and the Doctor conjectures that the ship's memory banks were damaged by the ion storm. When the TARDIS dematerializes, a portrait can be seen stating the birth and death date of Madame de Pompadour. As the episode ends, the lifeless ship drifts through space; its name is SS Madame de Pompadour.|$|E
