500|$|Five {{other music}} video were {{produced}} {{to promote the}} album's singles. While the video for [...] "Black Cat" [...] was taken from live footage of Jackson's concerts, those for [...] "Escapade" [...] and [...] "Alright" [...] utilized a Broadway-influenced production. The video for [...] "Alright" [...] was an homage to choreographer Michael Kidd, who was asked {{to participate in the}} project and also featured appearances by the flash dancing Nicholas Brothers, actress Cyd Charisse and bandleader Cab Calloway. An extended version of the video also features rapper Heavy D. The somber video for [...] "Come Back To Me" [...] was filmed near the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France. Similarly, [...] "Love Will Never Do (Without You)" [...] was a notable departure from the typically elaborate choreography associated with Jackson's other videos, focusing on her as an individual rather than {{as a part of a}} dancing troupe. Featuring appearances by Antonio Sabàto, Jr. and Djimon Hounsou, the sandy beach setting exemplifies director Herb Ritts [...] "signature style through use of graceful movements, bold contrasts, and wide-open spaces." [...] The music video is also regarded as the origin of what would later become Jackson's sexually overt persona, freely displaying her legs, torso and cleavage, as well as touching her own bare skin and Sabàto, Jr's in a sensual manner. In Present Tense: Rock & Roll and Culture (1992), Anthony DeCurtis states that [...] "he video celebrates hedonism and voyeurism; there are languorous displays of Jackson's body in ripped jeans and brief top, and of several muscular male bodies, black and white, with <b>bare</b> <b>arms,</b> and chests." [...] She received the MTV Video Vanguard Award, regarded as MTV's highest honor for artists whose videography has significantly impacted pop culture.|$|E
2500|$|Not surprisingly, corsetieres fought back, embellishing their {{products}} to be frilly and feminine in the 1870s. Advertising took on overtones of erotic imagery, even if in practice they acted {{as a deterrent to}} sexuality, especially when they started appearing in men's magazines, stressing cleavage and <b>bare</b> <b>arms</b> (then taboo). Dolls assumed the corseted image, implanting an image of the [...] "ideal" [...] female form. Corsets certainly reinforced the image of a weaker sex, unable to defend themselves, and also made it a challenge to disrobe.|$|E
2500|$|Anquetil rode on {{the inside}} by the {{mountain}} wall while Poulidor took the outer edge by the precipice. They could sometimes feel the other's hot gasps on their <b>bare</b> <b>arms.</b> At the end, Anquetil cracked, after a battle of wills and legs so intense that at times they banged elbows. Of Anquetil, Pierre Chany wrote: [...] "His face, until then purple, lost all its colour; the sweat ran down in drops through the creases of his cheeks." [...] Anquetil was only semi-conscious, he said. Anquetil's manager, Raphaël Géminiani, said: ...|$|E

60|$|She went towards him, stooping her beautiful, <b>bare</b> <b>arm,</b> and deftly turned {{some of her}} things, {{disclosing}} the box, {{which was}} exquisitely painted.|$|R

2500|$|Anquetil rode on {{the inside}} by the {{mountain}} wall while Poulidor took the outer edge by the precipice. They could sometimes feel the other's hot gasps on their <b>bare</b> <b>arms.</b> At the end, Anquetil cracked, after a battle of wills and legs so intense that at times they banged elbows. Poulidor says he was so tired {{that he has no}} memory of the two touching, although a photograph shows that they did. Of Anquetil, the veteran French reporter Pierre Chany wrote: [...] "His face, until then purple, lost all its colour; the sweat ran down in drops through the creases of his cheeks." [...] Anquetil was only semiconscious, he said. Poulidor gained time but when they reached Paris, Anquetil still had a 55-second lead and won his last Tour de France thanks to the time-trial on the final day.|$|E
2500|$|Women's fashion {{during the}} Empire {{was set to}} a large degree by the Empress Joséphine de Beauharnais and her {{favorite}} designer, Hippolyte Leroy, who was inspired by the Roman statues of the Louvre and the frescoes of Pompeii. Fashions were also guided by a new magazine, the Journal des Dames et des Modes, with illustrations by the leading artists of the day. The antique Roman style, introduced during the Revolution, continued to be popular but was modified because Napoleon disliked immodesty in women's clothing; low necklines and <b>bare</b> <b>arms</b> were banned. The waist of the Empire gowns was very high, almost under the arms, with a long pleated skirt down to the feet. Corsets were abandoned, and the preferred fabric was mousseline. The main fashion accessory for women was the shawl, inspired by the Orient, made of cashmere or silk, covering the arms and shoulders. Napoleon's military campaigns also influenced fashion; after the Egyptian campaign, women began to wear turbans; after the Spanish campaign, tunics with high shoulders; and after the campaigns in Prussia and Poland, Polish furs and a long coat called a pelisse. They also wore jackets inspired by military uniforms, with epaulettes. In cold weather women wore a redingote, from the English word [...] "riding coat", borrowed from men's fashion, or, after 1808, a witchoura, a fur coat with a hood.|$|E

60|$|For a space {{no one did}} anything. One, two, {{three seconds}} passed and then for an instant a <b>bare</b> <b>arm</b> flashed {{in the air and}} {{vanished}} again.|$|R
60|$|The {{sight of}} his white, <b>bare</b> <b>arm</b> maddened the girls. He lay {{in a kind of}} trance of fear and antagonism. They felt {{themselves}} filled with supernatural strength.|$|R
60|$|Murgh {{unfolded}} his <b>bare</b> <b>arms</b> {{and lifted}} his head, which was sunk upon his breast.|$|E

60|$|For {{a moment}} Tom Spring stood {{looking down at}} his {{unconscious}} opponent. The next he felt a soft, warm hand upon his <b>bare</b> <b>arm.</b> The woman was at his elbow.|$|R
6000|$|Lime {{put on his}} hat {{and walked}} up to the window, and, resting his great <b>bare</b> <b>arms</b> on the sill, and his chin on his arms, said: ...|$|E
60|$|He in {{his dinner}} jacket, and Clara in her green dress and <b>bare</b> <b>arms,</b> were confused. They felt they must shelter {{each other in}} that little kitchen.|$|E
60|$|She {{took the}} baby and kissed it passionately, and made extravagant love to it. A clean shaven young man with thick <b>bare</b> <b>arms</b> went across the yard.|$|E
60|$|Sullivan, who {{had been}} on top of the block-house, came down the ladder almost without {{touching}} it. Blood was running down his <b>bare</b> <b>arm</b> and dripping from the ends of his fingers.|$|R
60|$|The Judge {{drove him}} out to Councill's one afternoon. Everybody they met seemed delighted to see him. Mrs. Councill {{came out to the}} horse-block, her <b>bare</b> <b>arm</b> held up to shield her eyes.|$|R
60|$|CAESAR. Peace. Put up your swords. Apollodorus: your serpent {{seems to}} breathe very regularly. (He thrusts his {{hand under the}} shawls and draws out a <b>bare</b> <b>arm.)</b> This is a pretty little snake.|$|R

6000|$|The {{two women}} made a {{movement}} of smiling remonstrance, half coquettish, and half superior, until Mrs. Bradley, becoming conscious of her <b>bare</b> <b>arms</b> and the stranger's wandering eyes, colored faintly, and said with more decision:-- ...|$|E
60|$|But, as {{he stood}} at the altar, a globe of light {{appeared}} above his head; and when he raised his <b>bare</b> <b>arms</b> with the Host--the angels were seen round him, hanging golden chains upon them, and jewels, not of the earth.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's it, Captain; advice. That girl, there." [...] He flung out a <b>bare</b> <b>arm</b> {{to point}} to her. [...] "Bishop's girl; the Governor of Jamaica's niece.... We want her as a hostage for our safety." ...|$|R
6000|$|Still {{she did not}} speak, but {{suddenly}} stretched out to him her <b>bare</b> <b>arm.</b> Swithin pressed his face to it. With a shiver, she whispered above him, [...] "I will come," [...] and gently shut the door.|$|R
60|$|Looking ruefully at {{the marks}} of his great teeth upon my <b>bare</b> <b>arm</b> I decided to do as he seemed to wish me to do. After all, his strange {{instinct}} might be more dependable than my faulty human judgment.|$|R
60|$|One day Pan saw Jim's wife, {{a pretty}} blonde girl, strong and healthy and rosy cheeked. Her sleeves were rolled up showing round <b>bare</b> <b>arms.</b> Her smile won Pan, {{yet he was}} too shy {{to go in and}} take the cookies she offered.|$|E
60|$|He emerged {{once more}} into the sunshine. The pool lay before him, {{reflecting}} in its bronze mirror the blue and various green of the summer day. Looking at it, he thought of Anne's <b>bare</b> <b>arms</b> and seal-sleek bathing-dress, her moving knees and feet.|$|E
60|$|He heard soft steps, a breathless exclamation, then a key {{turned in}} the lock, and the door opened.

6000|$|... "Come," [...] she answered, [...] "you must go!" [...] {{and she put}} out her <b>bare</b> <b>arm</b> to {{push him}} back. But Bellew recoiled of his own accord; his eyes were fixed again on the floor a little beyond her to the left.|$|R
6000|$|... [LADY ELLA, {{prepares to}} receive EDWARD. THE SQUIRE and RECTOR [...] stand transfixed. The door opens, and a <b>bare</b> <b>arm</b> gently pushes [...] EDWARD forth. He is bandaged {{with a smooth}} towel. There is a [...] snuffle--HANNIBAL has broken the scarf, outside.] ...|$|R
60|$|Blanche {{kept her}} hand behind her head, which was bent {{slightly}} forward; her <b>bare</b> <b>arm</b> emerged from her hanging sleeve, and, {{with her eyes}} glancing upward from under her lowered brows, she smiled at her two spectators. Her husband laid his hand on Bernard's arm.|$|R
