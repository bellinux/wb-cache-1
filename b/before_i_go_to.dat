500|$|Clarke {{has been}} {{described}} by Stephen Banfield as the most distinguished British female composer of the inter-war generation. However, her later output was sporadic. She suffered from dysthymia, a chronic form of depression; the lack of encouragement—sometimes outright discouragement—she received for her work also made her reluctant to compose. Clarke did not consider herself able to balance her personal life and the demands of composition: [...] "I can't do it unless it's the first thing I think of every morning when I wake and the last thing I think of every night <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> sleep." [...] After her marriage, she stopped composing, despite the encouragement of her husband, although she continued working on arrangements until shortly before her death. She also stopped performing.|$|E
500|$|Mars' {{music has}} been noted for {{displaying}} {{a wide variety of}} styles, musical genres, and influences, including pop, rock, reggae, R, soul, and hip hop. His debut album Doo-Wops & Hooligans, a pop record, is influence by these genres. His subsequent release, Unorthodox Jukebox, as with his debut album, is infused with different influences including dance, rock reggae and soul, as well as balladry. Lyrically, the album is different than the former, addressing traditional notions of romance, male chauvinism, and sexuality. The explicit content in the song [...] "Gorilla" [...] caused a controversy in Australia. Many of his songs, particularly on Doo-Wops & Hooligans, reflect [...] "feel-good", carefree, and optimistic sentiments. However, darker subjects are addressed in his songs, detailing failed relationships and self-destructive behaviour. Mars' third album, 24K Magic, is significantly influence by R, soul music and funk. Lyrically, the album involve themes of money and sex. Mars has explained his writing process: [...] "I don't sit down and think, 'I'm going to write a song', inspiration hits me always unexpectedly: on a plane, when I'm out or just <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> bed. An idea will suddenly come to my mind, and sometimes I manage to turn it into lyrics the next day. Sometimes it'll take me one year to get something real out of it. You can’t force creativeness." ...|$|E

'Yes,' said Farnie, in the dreamy {{voice of}} one who recalls {{memories}} from the misty past, 'I was at Harrow <b>before</b> <b>I</b> came here, and at Wellington <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Harrow, and at Clifton <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Wellington.' ...|$|R

2500|$|In 2014, Kidman {{starred in}} the biopic, Grace of Monaco {{in the title role}} that chronicles the 1962 crisis, in which Charles de Gaulle {{blockaded}} the tiny principality, angered by Monaco's status as a tax haven for wealthy French subjects and Kelly's contemplating a Hollywood return to star in Alfred Hitchcock's Marnie. Opening out of competition at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival, the film received largely negative reviews. Kidman also starred in two films with Colin Firth, the first, the British-Australian historical drama, The Railway Man in which Kidman played officer's wife Patti Lomax received positive critical reviews. Katherine Monk of the Montreal Gazette said of Kidman's performance, [...] "It's a truly masterful piece of acting that transcends Teplitzky's store-bought framing, but it's Kidman who delivers the biggest surprise: For the first time since her eyebrows turned into solid marble arches, the Australian Oscar winner is truly terrific". The second, the British thriller film <b>Before</b> <b>I</b> <b>Go</b> <b>To</b> Sleep drew positive critical response of Kidman's performance, as Christine Lucas, a car crash survivor with brain damage. Kidman also appeared in the family film Paddington (2014) as a villain.|$|E

Pardon me, Miss Laura, if I tell this story before you. It is as well that you all of you should hear my confession. <b>Before</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> college, as a boy of eighteen, I was at a private tutor's, and there, like Arthur, I became attached, or fancied I was attached, to a woman of a much lower degree and a greater age than my own.
