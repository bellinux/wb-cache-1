The frieze contains words from a sermon delivered by Reverend John Davenport in 1639: [...] "Wisdom hath builded her house; she hath hewn out her seven pillars" [...] (a quote from Proverbs). Davenport {{was referring to}} the seven men who were selected to serve as the first General Court, and their names are inscribed on the building. The upper walls of the interior light court were incised with the names of five other prominent New Haven citizens and three military heroes. A carved <b>band</b> <b>tops</b> the building and includes coquillage, which are stylized seashells. An acroterion, the ornament at the apex of the gable, is also a stylized shell.|$|E
5000|$|In 2005 Csihar left Aborym {{to return}} to Mayhem and was {{replaced}} by Preben [...] "Prime Evil" [...] Mulvik of Mysticum and Amok. Faust joined the band on drums as a permanent member, and guitarist Set Teitan moved to Sweden to join Dissection. Aborym signed with a bigger label in the form of Season of Mist to release their fourth record, Generator. Chad Bowar of About.com praised the album's atmospheric elements and the vocals of Mulvik, noting also that Csihar returns to appear on one track ("Man Bites Dog"). Jeremy Garner of Metal Reviews commented: [...] "I'll be fucked if any Black Metal <b>band</b> <b>tops</b> this effort for a while. Any fan of Black Metal regardless of subgenre preferences should take the opportunity to delve into this. Pure excellence". Nathan Pearce of Ultimatemetal.com comment that: [...] "Aborym is now a band that should appeal to a wider audience without alienating their already solid fan base".|$|E
40|$|The structural, electronic, optical, and {{magneto-optical}} {{properties of}} the three Bi 12 MO 20 sillenites (BMO; M[*]=[*]Ti, Ge, and Si) have been investigated {{on the basis of}} the first-principles calculations performed by the full potential augmented plane wave method. The BMO’s linear optical responses are found to be very similar, but their optical rotatory powers and Faraday ellipticities exhibit notable differences in both visible and ultraviolet parts of the spectra. These differences originate from the subtle differences within the BMO’s electronic structures, such as different band-gaps and different offsets of the valence <b>band</b> <b>tops.</b> The latter are found to be caused not by the influence of the M ion electronic states, but by particular behavior of the M–O and the Bi–O chemical bonds...|$|E

The multiple close-to-degenerate (or "convergent") valence bands in the electronic band structure {{has been one of}} the key factors contributing to the high power factor and thus figure of merit in the SnSe single crystal. To date, there have been primarily theoretical calculations of this particular electronic band structure. In this paper, however, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we perform a systematic investigation of the electronic structure of SnSe. We directly observe three predicted hole bands with small energy differences between their <b>band</b> <b>tops</b> and relatively small in-plane effective masses, in good agreement with the ab initio calculations and critical for the enhancement of the Seebeck coefficient while keeping high electrical conductivity. Our results reveal the complete band structure of SnSe and help to provide a deeper understanding of the electronic origin of the excellent thermoelectric performances in SnSe...|$|E

After calculation, the energy results show that 4 H-SiC system energy is the lowest and stablest, while 2 H-SiC system energy is the highest and unstablest; the calculation results of the band structure show that six SiC poly-types are indirect wide band gap semiconductor, with valence <b>band</b> <b>top</b> on point Γ of Brillouin zone, conduction band bottom on point M of Brillouin zone; with the increase of hexagonality, the energy gap and valence band width are gradually getting smaller, with largest splitting of orbital energy level on 2 H-SiC valence <b>band</b> <b>top,</b> reaching to 0. 122 eV, while the splitting of orbital energy level on 8 H-SiC valence <b>band</b> <b>top</b> is the smallest, with 0. 027 eV only...|$|R

40|$|Photomodulated {{reflection}} and optical absorption spectroscopies {{were used to}} measure the composition and hydrostatic pressure dependencies of interband optical transitions in ZnSe(1 -x) Te(x) alloys. On the Te-rich side, the bandgap reduction and the reduction in the pressure dependence of the bandgap are well explained by the band anticrossing interaction between the ZnTe conduction band states and the Se localized state located at 2. 85 eV above the valence <b>band</b> <b>top</b> of ZnTe. On the Se-rich side, an interaction between the degenerate Gamma valence bands of ZnSe and the localized Te state located at 0. 1 eV above the valence <b>band</b> <b>top</b> of ZnSe is proposed to generate the bandgap reduction and the rapid increase of the spin-orbit splitting with increasing Te concentration. A linear interpolation between these two models accounts for the composition and pressure dependencies of the bandgap in the entire composition range...|$|R
