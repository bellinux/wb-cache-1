Whereas the <b>blood</b> pressure <b>of</b> SHR with <b>blood</b> pressure above 161 mmHg was decreased by aspirin, the <b>blood</b> pressure <b>of</b> SHR below 160 mmHg was increased by aspirin. The extent and direction <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> pressure change by aspirin was strongly correlated with the <b>blood</b> pressure <b>of</b> SHR before treatment (r = - 0. 88).

5|$|In 2003 the BBC {{announced}} {{the return of}} Doctor Who, {{as a series of}} webcasts to air on bbc.com. Richard E. Grant was announced as the Ninth Doctor. A webcast, written by Paul Cornell, entitled Scream of the Shalka was completed, and aired on bbc.com. This was followed by an online short story entitled The Feast of the Stone. Work was already well underway on the third webcast, entitled <b>Blood</b> <b>of</b> the Robots. This was to be written by Simon Clark. However, before production began, it was announced that Doctor Who would be returning to television, with Russell T. Davies as Producer. <b>Blood</b> <b>of</b> the Robots was never made. <b>Blood</b> <b>of</b> the Robots synopsis:- A blend of adventure, drama and humour. The Doctor arrives to find a world full of intelligent, sensitive robots that have been abandoned by their human owners, who are too squeamish to 'kill' them when they're obsolete. Now ruthless salvage squads are hunting the robots in order to make room for human settlers forced to migrate from their dangerously over-crowded home planet.|$|E

5|$|Vampire bats hunt {{only when}} it is fully dark. Like fruit-eating bats, and unlike insectivorous and {{fish-eating}} bats, they emit only low-energy sound pulses. The common vampire bat feeds mostly on the <b>blood</b> <b>of</b> mammals (occasionally including humans), whereas both the hairy-legged vampire bat and white-winged vampire bat feed on the <b>blood</b> <b>of</b> birds. Once the common vampire bat locates a host, such as a sleeping mammal, it lands and approaches it on the ground. It then likely uses thermoception to identify a warm spot on the skin to bite. They then create a small incision with their teeth and lap up blood from the wound.|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{focuses on}} the {{comparison}} of selected groups of reptiles {{with respect to the}} composition <b>of</b> <b>blood.</b> The first part of the thesis analyses selected available reference works from the current perspective of understanding in both domestic and international sources. A great deal of attention is paid to the procedure <b>of</b> collection <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> samples, preparation <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> cell films and their analysis. The thesis also comprises voluminous information on qualitative and quantitative aspects of haematology of lizards, turtles and snakes. The issue of differences in haemogram of selected group of reptiles is tackled taking into consideration the facts influencing the haemogram of the reptiles, such as the age and size of reptiles, seasonal changes, hibernation, the impact of the environment, nutrition as well as the method of breeding in - captivity or free range. The second part of the work concentrates on the collection <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> samples, preparation <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> cell films, identification <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> elements <b>of</b> green iguana Iguana iguana (Linnaeus, 1758), red-eared slider Trachemys scripta (Thunberg et Schoepff, 1792) and red-tailed boa Boa constrictor (Linnaeus, 1758). The samples collected from these creatures were analysed as for representation <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> components (erythrocytes, haematocrit, haemoglobin, leucocytes, heterophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, azurocytes, eosinophils, basophiles) and the measured values were compared against the published irreferential values and within the group of these creatures. Having analysed the blood cell films we have arrived at the conclusion that the morphological features <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> cells <b>of</b> the examined reptiles were identical with the parameters set out in the literature. Morphology <b>of</b> the <b>blood</b> cells <b>of</b> the monitored reptiles varies. Our results indicate that blood count as well as differential <b>blood</b> count <b>of</b> the examined creatures fits in the limits of the published referential works. The examined samples confirm the differences in numbers of individual types <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> cells <b>of</b> lizards, turtles and snakes. In summary it would be desirable to examine a larger number of creatures in order to obtain the optimal number of results...|$|R
