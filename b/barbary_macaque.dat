5|$|Alexander {{controversially}} {{married the}} commoner Aspasia Manos in 1919, provoking a major scandal that forced {{the couple to}} leave Greece for several months. Soon after returning to Greece with his wife, Alexander was bitten by a domestic <b>Barbary</b> <b>macaque</b> and died of sepsis. The sudden death of the sovereign led to questions over the monarchy's survival {{and contributed to the}} fall of the Venizelist regime. After a general election and a referendum, Constantine I was restored to the throne.|$|E
5|$|On 2 October 1920, Alexander {{was injured}} while {{walking through the}} grounds of the Tatoi estate. A {{domestic}} <b>Barbary</b> <b>macaque</b> belonging to the steward of the palace's grapevines attacked or was attacked by the king's German Shepherd Dog, Fritz, and Alexander attempted to separate the two animals. As he did so, another monkey attacked Alexander and bit him deeply on the leg and torso. Eventually servants arrived and chased away the monkeys, and the king's wounds were promptly cleaned and dressed but not cauterized. He did not consider the incident serious and asked that it not be publicized.|$|E
25|$|Human dissections {{were carried}} out by the Greek {{physicians}} Herophilus of Chalcedon and Erasistratus of Chios {{in the early part of}} the third century BC. During this period, the first exploration into full human anatomy was performed rather than a base knowledge gained from 'problem-solution' delving. Before and after this time investigators appeared to largely limit themselves to animals. While there was a deep taboo within the Greek culture concerning human dissection, there was a strong push by the government to build Greece into a hub of medical insight. For a time, Roman law forbade dissection and autopsy of the human body, so physicians had to use other cadavers. Galen, for example, dissected the <b>Barbary</b> <b>macaque</b> and other primates, assuming their anatomy was basically the same as that of humans.|$|E

The results demonstrate that all tested factors are important for females choice of grooming partners in given group. Moreover, {{the relative importance of}} each variable was evaluated. This approach enables to establish which factor plays the most important role in grooming distribution among female <b>Barbary</b> <b>macaques.</b> The relationship quality had the strongest effect on distribution of grooming interactions among females.

40|$|International audienceHabitat, {{diet and}} leaf {{chemistry}} are compared between Japanese and <b>Barbary</b> <b>macaques</b> {{to reveal the}} similarities and differences in dietary adaptations of temperate primates living at the eastern and western extremes of the genus Macaca. Tree species diversity and proportion of fleshy-fruited species are much higher in Japan than in North Africa. Both species spend considerable annual feeding time on leaves. Japanese macaques prefer fruits and seeds over leaves, and <b>Barbary</b> <b>macaques</b> prefer seeds. These characteristics are adaptive in temperate regions where fruit availability varies considerably with season, since animals can survive during the lean period by relying on leaf and other vegetative foods. The two species are different with respect to the higher consumption of herbs by <b>Barbary</b> <b>macaques,</b> and the leaves consumed contain high condensed and hydrolysable tannin for Barbary but not for Japanese <b>macaques.</b> <b>Barbary</b> <b>macaques</b> supplement less diverse tree foods with herbs. Because of the low species diversity and high tannin content of the dominant tree species, <b>Barbary</b> <b>macaques</b> may have developed the capacity to cope with tannin. This supports the idea that digestion of leaves is indispensable to survive in temperate regions where fruit and seed foods are not available for a prolonged period during each year...|$|R
25|$|Galen's {{understanding}} of anatomy and medicine was principally {{influenced by the}} then-current theory of humorism (also known as the four humors – black bile, yellow bile, blood, and phlegm), as advanced by ancient Greek physicians such as Hippocrates. His theories dominated and influenced Western medical science for more than 1,300 years. His anatomical reports, based mainly on dissection of monkeys, especially the <b>Barbary</b> <b>macaque,</b> and pigs, remained uncontested until 1543, when printed descriptions and illustrations of human dissections {{were published in the}} seminal work De humani corporis fabrica by Andreas Vesalius where Galen's physiological theory was accommodated to these new observations. Galen's theory of the physiology of the circulatory system endured until 1221, when Ibn al-Nafis published his encyclopedia of medicine entitled As-Shamil fi Tibb, in which he established that blood circulates, with the heart acting as a pump.|$|E

50|$|<b>Barbary</b> <b>macaques</b> {{can cause}} major {{damage to the}} trees in their prime habitat, the Atlas cedar forests in Morocco. Since {{deforestation}} in Morocco {{has become a major}} environmental problem in recent years, research has been conducted to determine the cause of the bark stripping behaviour demonstrated by these macaques. Cedar trees are also vital to this population of <b>Barbary</b> <b>macaques</b> as an area with cedars can support a much higher density of macaques than one without them. A lack of a water source and exclusion of monkeys from water sources are major causes of cedar bark stripping behaviour in <b>Barbary</b> <b>macaques.</b> Density of macaques, however, is less correlated with the behaviour than the other causes considered.|$|R
40|$|This study {{provides}} an overview of the vocalizations of <b>Barbary</b> <b>macaques,</b> Macaca sylvanus. Spectrographic displays of calls are presented along with photographs of the accompanying facial gestures. We give a general description of the contexts in which the different calls are uttered, with special regard to the age and sex of the caller. The vocal repertoire of <b>Barbary</b> <b>macaques</b> mainly consists of screams, shrill barks, geckers, low-frequency pants and grunts, with gradation occurring within and between call types. The spectrograms document that typically, <b>Barbary</b> <b>macaques</b> produce series of several consecutive calls. The influence of habitat, social structure and phylogenetic descent on the morphology of the repertoire and call diversity are discussed in comparison to other species...|$|R

50|$|The <b>Barbary</b> <b>macaque</b> {{was named}} by Carl Linnaeus in 1758, along with {{numerous}} other species named {{in that same}} year. The scientific name is Macaca sylvanus. Phylogenetic and molecular analysis with other primates has been done. Studies concerning interspecific DNA variation within the genus Macaca show that the <b>Barbary</b> <b>macaque</b> is most related to the Asian macaques. Scientists have also studied the Y-chromosome, however, this has been unfruitful. One study indicates that the <b>Barbary</b> <b>macaque</b> has origins in Morocco and Algeria. The results of a phylogenetic analysis show that M. sylvanus chromosomes resemble M. mnilatta {{with the exception of}} chromosomes 1, 4, 9, and 16.

50|$|The {{main purpose}} of calls in <b>Barbary</b> <b>macaques</b> is to alert other group members to {{possible}} dangers such as predators. <b>Barbary</b> <b>macaques</b> can discriminate calls by individuals in their own group from those by individuals in other groups of conspecific macaques. Neither genetic variation nor habitat differences are likely causes of acoustic variation in the calls of different social groups. Instead, minor variations in acoustic structure among groups similar to the vocal accommodation seen in humans are the likely cause. However, acoustic characteristics such as pitch and loudness are varied based on the vocalizations of individuals they associate with, and social situations {{play a role in}} the acoustic structure of calls.|$|R
40|$|The diet {{composition}} of two troops of Macaca sylvanus {{has been studied}} in two different habitats of the Djurdjura National Park (Algeria). 1. - In the evergreen Cedar-Green Oak forest (Tigounatine Range), quantitative observations were carried out during 16 months (April 1983 to March 1985). 2. - On the rocky ridges of the Icetcifène Range, without any arborescent vegetation, only qualitative observations were made during 1 2 months (April 1983 to August 1984). On the Tigounatine Range, the troop spent 93 % of its time feeding on plant foods, from which 75 % were leaves and seeds. Great seasonal variations were observerd : <b>Barbary</b> <b>Macaques</b> ate mainly grass and/or Cedar leaves in spring and winter. They turned to a granivorous diet in summer and autumn, consumming mainly acorns and Asphodelus microcarpus seeds. They can become insectivorous in spring, when caterpillars are swarming. These <b>Barbary</b> <b>macaques</b> spent 75 % of their feeding time on the ground. Throughout the year, young animais (0, 5 - 3 years) and subadults (3 - 4 years) spent more time feeding in trees than adults (> 4 years), {{but the kind of}} food items eaten remained similar. Adults ate preferentialy fallen acorns and caterpillars creeping on the ground, whereas young macaques gathered both acorns and caterpillars in trees. One hundred thirty six food categories were identified in the <b>Barbary</b> <b>Macaques</b> diet : However, only Quercus ilex, Cedrus atlantica, Asphodelus microcarpus, nine grass species and caterpillars contributed to 62 % of the diet. Furthermore, only one or three specie s (out of the 12 to 52 consumed each month) contributed to 43 to 85 % of the diet. Fifty nine percent of the food items originated from the grass layer, and 34 % from the arboreal layer. On the Icetcifène range, the troop's diet was mainly made of plant material. The <b>Barbary</b> <b>Macaques</b> fed on 31 plants species and 3 animal prey. In this h abitat, <b>Barbary</b> <b>Macaques</b> were essentialy terrestrial...|$|R

50|$|Although <b>Barbary</b> <b>macaques</b> {{are sexually}} active at all points during a female’s {{reproductive}} cycle, male <b>Barbary</b> <b>macaques</b> determine a female’s most fertile period by sexual swellings on the female. Mating is most common during a female’s most fertile period. The swelling {{size of the}} female reaches a maximum {{around the time of}} ovulation, suggesting that size helps a male predict when he should mate. This is further supported by the fact that male ejaculation peaks {{at the same time that}} female sexual swelling peaks. There is not a sufficient change in female sexual behaviour around the time of ovulation in order to demonstrate to the male that the female is fertile. The swellings, therefore, appear necessary for predicting fertility.|$|R
