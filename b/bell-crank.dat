5000|$|The {{account of}} the <b>bell-crank</b> steam engine may be {{referenced}} as [...] "" [...] ("O" [...] is the 8-page gathering's identifier.) ...|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Illustration from 1908 Chambers's Twentieth Century Dictionary. <b>Bell-crank,</b> n. a {{rectangular}} lever {{in the form}} of a crank, used for changing the direction of bell-wires.|$|E
5000|$|Steering: {{the width}} of the engine necessitated {{mounting}} the worm and sector reduction box on the scuttle. From there a coupling lever dropped to a <b>bell-crank</b> pivoted on the chassis side-member. A normal drag-link ran to the front axle.|$|E
25|$|Initially the {{armament}} was a Type 91 6.5Ã—50mm machine gun, {{although in}} later models carried a Type 92 7.7 mm machine gun. The suspension consisted of four bogies - two on each side. These were suspended by <b>bell-cranks</b> resisted by armored compression springs placed horizontally, one {{each side of}} the hull, externally. Each bogie had two small rubber road wheels with the drive sprocket at the front and the idler at the rear. There were two track-return rollers. In combat service the Type 94 was found to be prone to throwing its tracks in high speed turns. Further redesign work was carried out in 1937 on the suspension and the small idler was replaced by a larger diameter idler wheel suspended from a rocker arm which was now in ground contact; it did not completely solve the problem. A better suspension on a longer chassis appeared in later models of the Type 94.|$|R
5000|$|The {{geometry}} of the rack system has a large impact {{on the construction of}} turnouts. If the rack is elevated above the running rails, {{there is no need to}} interrupt the running rails to allow passage of the driving pinions of the engines. Strub explicitly documented this in his U.S. patent. [...] Strub used a complex set of <b>bell-cranks</b> and push-rods linking the throw-rod for the points to the two throw-rods for the moving rack sections. One break in the rack was required to select between the two routes, and a second break was required where the rack rails cross the running rails. Turnouts for the Morgan Rack system were similar, with the rack elevated above the running rails. Most of the Morgan turnout patents included movable rack sections to avoid breaks in the rack, but because all Morgan locomotives had two linked drive pinions, there was no need for a continuous rack. So long as the breaks in the rack were shorter than the distance between the drive pinions on the locomotive, the rack rail could be interrupted wherever there was need to cross over a running rail.|$|R
5000|$|Steamboats on the Mississippi {{benefited from}} {{technology}} and political changes. The US bought the Louisiana Purchase from France in 1803. At the time, a semi-bankrupt Napoleon {{was attempting to}} extend his hegemony over Europe in {{what came to be}} known as the Napoleonic Wars. As a result, the US was then free to expand westward out of the Ohio valley and into the Great Plains and the Southwest.The success of the Charlotte Dundas in Scotland in 1801 and Robert Fulton's Clermont on the Hudson River in 1807 proved the concept of the steamboat. At this time, walking beam mill engines, of the Boulton and Watt variety, were dropped onto wood barges with paddles to create an instant powerboat. The overhead engines of the [...] "walking beam" [...] type became the standard Atlantic Seaboard paddle engine for the next 80 years. For smaller boats, Watt perfected the side-lever engine with the engine cut down using side <b>bell-cranks</b> to lower the center of gravity. Sidewheel paddlers were the first to enter the scene. In 1811 the steamer New Orleans was built in Pittsburgh for Fulton and Livingston. Fulton started steamboat service between Natchez and New Orleans.|$|R
50|$|In {{the field}} of amphibious tanks, the Japanese proved more creative. The army built several prototypes before the war (they {{are the first to}} {{experiment}} with jet propulsion), but the whole enterprise was dropped in 1940. The Imperial Japanese Navy took over development of amphibious vehicles and in 1941 came up with the Type 2 Ka-Mi, followed in 1943 by the larger Type 3 Ka-Chi. They were adaptations of land tanks on which disposable bows and sterns were added to ensure flotation. They did not {{play a significant role in}} combat. Still, in their tank programs the Japanese introduced innovations as they built their designs, including <b>bell-crank</b> suspensions, as pioneers in amphibious tanks, and the use of diesel engines as they were less likely to catch on fire versus the regular gas engines.|$|E
40|$|The COFS (MAST I) deployer/retractor {{assembly}} (DRA) {{which has}} a cluster of mechanisms that constitute the collapsible/extensible Mast, contains mechanisms/linkages that deploy and retract. The Mast is a flexible spatial (3 D) linkage with hinges that lock into place during deployment to form a truss type structure. It is 60 meters long with repeating sections of two bays. Each bay has alternating diagonals. All joints are single degree-of-freedom hinges, arranged such that the Mast does not rotate during deployment/restow and that deformation energy is minimized. Mispan hinges are incorporated in the diagonals {{and half of the}} batten members. The various operational aspects and characteristics of the various mechanisms within the DRA are analyzed. In view of the disadvantages of statical in determinancy as well as the inefficiencies inherent in recirculating gear trains, it is recommended that the bevel gear trains and the <b>bell-crank</b> mechanisms be redesigned...|$|E
50|$|Bristol {{chose to}} base its first model {{on the best}} {{features}} of two outstanding pre-war BMWs, namely the 328's engine, and the 326's frame. These were covered with a neat mainly steel body but with aluminium bonnet, door and boot skins and inspired by the BMW 327's. The Bristol 400 featured a slightly modified version of BMW's six-cylinder pushrod engine of 1,971 cc (bore 66 mm, stroke 96 mm). This engine, considered advanced for its time due to its hemispherical combustion chambers and very short inlet and exhaust ports, developed 80 horsepower at 4,500 revs per minutes and could carry the 400 to {{a top speed of}} around 148 km/h (92 mph) with acceleration to match. In order to maintain a hemispherical combustion chamber, the valves had to be positioned at an angle to the head. In order to drive both sets of valves from a single camshaft, the Bristol engine used a system of rods, followers and <b>bell-cranks</b> to drive the valves {{on the far side of}} the engine from the camshaft. Owners soon found that setting and maintaining the numerous clearances in the system was difficult but vital to keep the engine in tune. The gearbox was a four-speed manual with synchromesh on the upper three ratios and a freewheel on first.|$|R
