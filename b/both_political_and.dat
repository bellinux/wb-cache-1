5|$|Tacitus' {{narrative}} emphasizes <b>both</b> <b>political</b> <b>and</b> psychological motivation. The characterisation of Tiberius {{throughout the}} first six books is mostly negative, and gradually worsens as his rule declines, identifying a clear breaking point {{with the death of}} his son Drusus in 23 AD.|$|E
5|$|With {{the rise}} of nation-states and the Protestant Reformation, the theory of divine right {{justified}} the king's absolute authority in <b>both</b> <b>political</b> <b>and</b> spiritual matters. The theory {{came to the fore}} in England under the reign of James I of England (1603–1625, also known as James VI of Scotland 1567–1625). Louis XIV of France (1643–1715) strongly promoted the theory as well.|$|E
5|$|Beauchamp {{arrived in}} Frankfort on November 15, 1825. New Court partisans talked of Sharp's murder {{as the work}} of the Old Court party, just as Beauchamp had hoped. One suspect was Waring, who had printed the handbills {{critical}} of Sharp. Known as a violent man, he had <b>both</b> <b>political</b> <b>and</b> personal motivation for the crime. He was cleared of suspicion when investigators learned that, {{at the time of the}} murder, Waring was in Fayette County recovering from unrelated injuries.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Ambarawa brought Sudirman greater {{attention}} {{at a national}} level, and generally silenced whispers that he was unfit for military command because of his lack of military experience and previous employment as a schoolteacher. Ultimately, Sudirman was chosen as his loyalty was undoubted, while Oerip's former pledge of loyalty to the Dutch led to him being viewed with suspicion. Sudirman was confirmed as commander-in-chief on 18December 1945. He was replaced {{as head of the}} Fifth Division by Colonel Sutiro, and began to focus on strategic problems. This was done partly by establishing a board of advisors, which gave the general advice on <b>both</b> <b>political</b> <b>and</b> military issues. Oerip handled many of the military matters.|$|E
5|$|The {{disaster}} had <b>both</b> <b>political</b> <b>and</b> military dimensions. In Parliament, Churchill {{suggested that}} an official {{inquiry into the}} disaster should be held after the war. When this wartime speech was published in 1946, the Australian government asked if the British government still intended to conduct the inquiry. The Joint Planning Staff considered the matter, and recommended that no inquiry be held, as {{it would not be}} possible to restrict its focus to the events surrounding the fall of Singapore, and it would inevitably have to examine the political, diplomatic and military circumstances of the Singapore strategy over a period of many years. Prime Minister Clement Attlee accepted this advice, and no inquiry was ever held.|$|E
5|$|Two essays written {{during this}} time {{foreshadow}} Smuts's later views, <b>both</b> <b>political</b> <b>and</b> philosophical. The first of these, entitled South African Customs Union, was written in 1890 in competition for the JB Ebden prize offered by the University of the Cape of Good Hope. This essay, {{an examination of the}} economic relations of the colonies and states of South Africa, though 'Highly Commended' by the judges, failed to win the prize. Nevertheless, despite achieving only modest success, it is unsurpassed as a clear and authoritative statement of Smuts's political outlook at this time.|$|E

5|$|Jervis {{was also}} {{recognised}} by <b>both</b> <b>political</b> <b>and</b> military contemporaries {{as a fine}} administrator and naval reformer. As Commander-in-chief of the Mediterranean, between 1795 and 1799 he introduced a series of severe standing orders to avert mutiny. He applied those orders to both seamen and officers alike, a policy {{that made him a}} controversial figure. He took his disciplinarian system of command with him when he took command of the Channel Fleet in 1799. In 1801, as First Lord of the Admiralty he introduced a number of reforms that, though unpopular at the time, made the Navy more efficient and more self-sufficient. He introduced innovations including block making machinery at Portsmouth Royal Dockyard. St Vincent was known for his generosity to officers he considered worthy of reward and his swift and often harsh punishment of those he felt deserved it.|$|E
5|$|Later {{that spring}} Bryant and Reed heeded Vorse's call {{to spend the}} warm season in Provincetown, Massachusetts, {{at the tip of}} Cape Cod, and {{to take part in the}} {{communal}} theater productions of the Provincetown Players. Others from the Village went as well and joined the group, organized in 1915 by George Cram Cook and his wife, Susan Glaspell, who hoped to produce plays that were <b>both</b> <b>political</b> <b>and</b> artistic. Among the works the group staged in 1916 were Bryant's The Game, in which characters named Life and Death play dice for the lives of Youth (a poet) and Girl (a dancer). It appeared on the same bill as Not Smart by Wilbur Steele and Bound East for Cardiff by O'Neill.|$|E
5|$|Sexual Politics {{originated}} as Millett's PhD dissertation and {{was published}} in 1970, {{the same year that}} she was awarded her doctorate from Columbia University. The bestselling book, a critique of patriarchy in Western society and literature, addressed the sexism and heterosexism of the modern novelists D. H. Lawrence, Henry Miller, and Norman Mailer and contrasted their perspectives with the dissenting viewpoint of the homosexual author Jean Genet. Millett questioned the origins of patriarchy, argued that sex-based oppression was <b>both</b> <b>political</b> <b>and</b> cultural, and posited that undoing the traditional family was the key to true sexual revolution. In its first year on the market, the book sold 80,000 copies and went through seven printings and is considered to be the movement's manifesto.|$|E
