50|$|Restoration of Framsden Windmill {{commenced}} in June 1966. A stock {{had broken}} {{and half a}} sail had fallen shortly before, so the remaining half sail and its partner were removed, along with the stock. The roof was made watertight and the left side <b>bottom</b> <b>side</b> <b>rail</b> was strengthened. This work {{was carried out by}} Frank Farrow, Stanley Freese, Christopher Hullcoop, Vincent Pargeter and Peter Stenning. In 1967, the main post was strengthened with iron bars and steel hoops as it was badly split. The mill was at that time head-sick, and leant to the right. This was attended to, and the mill put back on an even keel. The right hand side girt was found to have broken at the joint with the crown tree. It was reinforced with a heavy angle iron bolted on top. In 1968, the two remaining sails were lowered for repair and the stock was reinforced by fitting a pair of clamps. In 1969, the Brake Wheel was repaired, with two new elm segments being made and fitted. The repaired sails were refitted in March and July. The striking gear was repaired, with the cross from Victoria Mill, Eye replacing that broken when the sail fell. On 7 February 1970, the mill turned by wind again. A lightning conductor was fitted and the Brake Wheel was re-cogged with hornbeam. The Brake Wheel originally had 61 cogs, and was refitted with 78 cogs when the mill was modernised. In 1971, work was done to get the left-hand pair of millstones into working order and repair the fantail carriage. In May 1972, the mill ground wheat {{for the first time in}} preservation. The rear steps were repaired and the fantail carriage fitted in 1973.|$|E
40|$|Two {{dimensional}} stable suspension {{forces at}} the upper side of the magnetically active rail and sufficiently high stiffness in vertical and lateral directions are the basis for application in High, low and medium speed ranges for modern transportation concepts. As has been demonstrated by the Peking Model {{at the beginning of}} this year the linear propulsion concept can be adapted to the rail structure in such a way, that thrust can be developed at the <b>bottom</b> <b>side</b> of the <b>rail.</b> There the interaction of field modulation and coil currents generates the propulsive forces. Especially for high speed application the long primary linear motor exhibits the most favourable performance characteristics. With some modifications a shift to the short primary propulsion concept is possible. I may be successfully used for the low speed range of application. Due to the reduced amount of coil material a low cost-track arrangements results. Under low speed operation conditions the current transmission of the train does not cause servere problems. Tworail arrangements obviously are the natural expansions of the monorail configuration on which the Peking Demonstrator is based. (orig.)

40|$|This article {{explores the}} use of <b>side</b> <b>rails</b> {{within the context of}} {{physical}} restraint in gerontological practice. It is debated that <b>side</b> <b>rails</b> can be considered as a form of physical restraint if the individual cannot voluntarily remove/lower the device if he/she wishes to do so. The value of <b>side</b> <b>rails</b> as a protective medium is debated with regard to their association with injuries sustained as a result. <b>Side</b> <b>rails</b> should be used with caution and within a risk management context.

40|$|To {{examine the}} effect of an {{advanced}} practice nurse (APN) intervention on restrictive <b>side</b> <b>rail</b> usage in four nursing homes and with a sample of 251 residents. A secondary question explored the association between restrictive <b>side</b> <b>rail</b> reduction and bed-related falls. DESIGN : Pre- and posttest design. SETTING : Four urban nursing homes. PARTICIPANTS : All nursing home residents present in the nursing home at three time points (n= 710, 719, and 707) and a subset of residents (n= 251) with restrictive <b>side</b> <b>rail</b> use at baseline. INTERVENTION : APN consultation with individual residents and facility-wide education and consultation. MEASUREMENTS : Direct observation of <b>side</b> <b>rail</b> status, resident and nurse interview for functional status, mobility, cognition, behavioral symptoms, medical record review for demographics and treatment information, and incident reports for fall data. RESULTS : At the institutional level, one of the four nursing homes significantly reduced restrictive <b>side</b> <b>rail</b> use (P =. 01). At the individual participant level, 51. 4 % (n= 130) reduced restrictive <b>side</b> <b>rail</b> use. For the group that reduced restrictive <b>side</b> <b>rails,</b> there was a significantly (P <. 001) reduced fall rate (− 0. 053; 95 % confidence interval (CI) =− 0. 083 to − 0. 024), whereas the group that continued restrictive <b>side</b> <b>rail</b> did not demonstrate a significantly (P =. 17) reduced fall rate (− 0. 013; 95 % CI=− 0. 056 – 0. 030). CONCLUSION : An APN consultation model can safely reduce <b>side</b> <b>rail</b> use. Restrictive <b>side</b> <b>rail</b> reduction does not lead to an increase in bed-related falls. Although <b>side</b> <b>rails</b> serve many purposes, routine use of these devices to restrict voluntary movement and prevent falls is not supported...|$|R
40|$|Källsner and Girhammar have {{developed}} plastic design methods for light-frame timber shear walls {{that can be}} used for determining the load-carrying capacity when the shear walls are partially anchored. For such walls, the leading stud is not fully anchored against uplift and tying down forces are developed in the sheathing-to-framing joints. Since the forces in the anchor bolts and the sheathing-to-framing joints do not act in the same vertical plane, the bottom rail will be subjected to cross-wise bending, leading to possible splitting along the <b>bottom</b> <b>side</b> of the <b>rail.</b> Another possible brittle failure mode is splitting along the edge of the bottom rail in line with the sheathing-to-framing fasteners. An experimental program has been conducted using different anchor bolt locations, washer sizes and pith orientations. A fracture mechanics approach for the two failure modes is used to evaluate the experimental results. The comparison shows a good agreement between the experimental and analytical results. The failure mode is largely dependent on the distance between the edge of the washer and the edge of the bottom rail. The size of the washer seems also to have some influence on the failure load. The fracture mechanics models seem to capture the essential behaviour of the splitting modes and to include the decisive parameters. These parameters can easily be adjusted to experimental results and be used in design equations for bottom rails in partially anchored shear walls. Godkänd; 2012; 20120905 (giucap...|$|R
40|$|To {{explore the}} safety of the {{standard}} and the low hospital bed, we report on a microanalysis of 15 patients’ ability to ingress, move about the bed, and egress. The 15 participants were purposefully selected with various disabilities. Bed conditions were randomized with <b>side</b> <b>rails</b> up or down and one low bed with <b>side</b> <b>rails</b> down. We explored the patients’ use of the <b>side</b> <b>rails,</b> bed height, ability to lift their legs onto the mattress, and ability to turn, egress, and walk back to the chair. The standard bed was too high for some participants, both for ingress and egress. <b>Side</b> <b>rails</b> were used by most participants when entering, turning in bed, and exiting. We recommend that <b>side</b> <b>rails</b> be reconsidered as a means to facilitate in-bed movement, ingress, and egress. Furthermore, single deck height settings for all patients are not optimal.

40|$|Background: The use of {{hospital}} bed <b>side</b> <b>rails</b> for increased mobility and safety for elderly and high fall risk patients {{has become a}} controversial topic. The suggested removal of <b>side</b> <b>rails</b> to prevent entrapment, as recommended by Consumer Federation of America, increases the risk that a patient may {{fall out of the}} bed. Additionally, without <b>side</b> <b>rails,</b> patients may require additional assistance from nurses to reposition patients in bed, which increases the risk of back injuries among nurses (Jang et al. 2007). Objective: To examine the biomechanics associated with a patient’s ability to move freely in bed with and without <b>side</b> <b>rails.</b> Methods: Biomechanical data for in bed movements from fifty-two older adults with a history of falls (Morse Fall Scale value> 45) (mean age= 68 years, SD= 11. 4) was analyzed. An 18 -camera motion tracking system (NaturalPoint, Corvallis, OR) was used to track body biomechanics. Participants were instructed to lie down on an instrumented hospital bed. They were then instructed to turn onto their right side, then onto their left side. This was performed three times with three different <b>side</b> <b>rail</b> configurations; rail 1, rail 2 and no rails.
