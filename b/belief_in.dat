40|$|This study {{investigated}} the relationship between <b>beliefs</b> <b>in</b> procedural fairness, humanitarian values, and attitudes toward asylum seekers amongst a sample of first year university students in Western Australia (N = 148). <b>Beliefs</b> <b>in</b> procedural fairness were measured <b>in</b> terms of <b>beliefs</b> <b>in</b> the fairness of decision making and <b>beliefs</b> <b>in</b> the fairness of treatment. Findings supported the hypotheses, <b>in</b> that <b>beliefs</b> <b>in</b> procedural fairness {{were significantly related to}} attitudes and humanitarian values. Regression analyses revealed that <b>beliefs</b> <b>in</b> the fairness of treatment and humanitarian values made unique contributions in predicting attitudes. However <b>beliefs</b> <b>in</b> the fairness of decision making did not make a unique contribution to the prediction of attitudes.

40|$|<b>Beliefs</b> <b>in</b> {{the future}} are an {{internalization}} of hope and optimism about future outcomes. This paper reviews and compares several theories of hope and optimism and highlights the features constituting <b>beliefs</b> <b>in</b> the future. This paper points out that <b>beliefs</b> <b>in</b> the future include a series of goal-directed thoughts and motivation, such as setting up valued and attainable goals, planning pathways, and maintaining self-confidence and mastery, so as to keep adolescents engaged {{in the pursuit of}} goals. This kind of personal mastery, together with sociocultural values, family, school, and peers are the antecedents leading to <b>beliefs</b> <b>in</b> the future, which is related to adolescents' well-being and positive development. In order to cultivate adolescents' <b>beliefs</b> <b>in</b> the future, enabling their ability to manipulate goal-directed thoughts and motivation and providing a supportive environment including their family, school, peers, and the society are recommended. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
40|$|The {{relation}} between children’s trust beliefs and trusting behavior in peer interaction was examined. One hundred and 5 Italian children (54 boys; mean age = 10 years- 7 months) completed standardized scales of reliability (i. e., promise keeping) trust <b>beliefs</b> <b>in</b> parents and peers. The children participated in mixed-motive interactions with classmates which assessed behavior-dependent reliability trust on peers. The children’s reliability trustworthiness towards peers/classmates {{was assessed by}} peer reports. The SEM analyses supported the hypothesized model by showing: (1) a path between trust <b>beliefs</b> <b>in</b> parents and trust <b>beliefs</b> <b>in</b> peers; (2) paths between both types of trust beliefs and behavior-dependent trust on peers; (3) a path between behavior-dependent trust in peers and trustworthiness towards peers. Trust <b>beliefs</b> <b>in</b> peers were found to mediate the {{relation between}} trust <b>beliefs</b> <b>in</b> parents and behavior-dependent trust in peers.

40|$|It is well {{established}} that students’ <b>beliefs</b> <b>in</b> skill malleability influence their academic performance. Specifically, thinking of ability as an incremental (vs. fixed) trait is associated with better outcomes. Though this was shown across many domains, little research exists into these <b>beliefs</b> <b>in</b> the writing domain and into the mechanisms underlying their effects on writing performance. The {{aim of this study}} was twofold: to gather evidence on the validity and reliability of instruments to measure <b>beliefs</b> <b>in</b> skill malleability, achievement goals, and self-efficacy in writing; and to test a path-analytic model specifying <b>beliefs</b> <b>in</b> writing skill malleability to influence writing performance, via goals and self-efficacy. For that, 196 Portuguese students in Grades 7 - 8 filled in the instruments and wrote an opinion essay that was assessed for writing performance. Confirmatory factor analyses supported instruments’ validity and reliability. Path analysis revealed direct effects from <b>beliefs</b> <b>in</b> writing skill malleability to mastery goals (ß =. 45); from mastery goals to self-efficacy for conventions, ideation, and self-regulation (ß =. 27,. 42, and. 42, respectively); and from self-efficacy for self-regulation to writing performance (ß =. 16); along with indirect effects from <b>beliefs</b> <b>in</b> writing skill malleability to self-efficacy for self-regulation via mastery goals (ß =. 19), and from mastery goals to writing performance via self-efficacy for self-regulation (ß =. 07). Overall, students’ mastery goals and self-efficacy for self-regulation seem to be key factors underlying the link between <b>beliefs</b> <b>in</b> writing skill malleability and writing performance. These findings highlight the importance of attending to motivation-related components in the teaching of writing...|$|R

5|$|Commentators {{have offered}} many {{theories}} for {{the origins of}} vampire beliefs, trying to explain the superstition – and sometimes mass hysteria – caused by vampires.

5|$|In modern times, {{the vampire}} is {{generally}} {{held to be}} a fictitious entity, although <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> similar vampiric creatures such as the chupacabra still persists in some cultures.

5|$|It is {{believed}} in Twelver Shia Islam that ‘aql, divine wisdom, {{is the source}} of the souls of the Prophets and Imams and gives them esoteric knowledge called Hikmah and that their sufferings are a means of divine grace to their devotees. Although the Imam is not the recipient of a divine revelation, he has a close relationship with God, through which God guides him, and the Imam in turn guides the people. The Imams are also guided by secret texts in their possession, such as al-Jafr and al-Jamia. Imamate, or <b>belief,</b> <b>in</b> the divine guide is a fundamental <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> the Twelver Shia doctrine and is based on the concept that God would not leave humanity without access to divine guidance.|$|E
