40|$|The "wires project" in the Gray {{group has}} been focused on characterizing {{short-lived}} intermediates of Fe heme enzyme catalytic cycles by designing and synthesizing photosensitizers (wires) that bind to the protein active site with high affinity. The heart of this thesis is on rhenium channel binding and ruthenium surface binding wires for inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Binding and inhibition studies were conducted, electron transfer (ET) kinetics were studied, and iNOS catalytic activity was assayed for nitric oxide (NO) production. Both channel and surface binding wires bind to iNOS with low micro molar affinity. Channel binding wires bind at the active site, closely interacting with the protoporphyrin IX iron heme (Fe heme). Characteristic spectral shifts of Fe heme perturbation were observed. The surface binding wires bind presumably at the hydrophobic patch of the oxygenase domain where the reductase domain was proposed to dock during electron transfer processes. The surface <b>binding</b> <b>wire</b> interacts closely with the Fe heme {{from the surface of the}} protein, but still close to where spectral shifts of the Fe heme were observed; however, the surface <b>binding</b> <b>wire</b> does not displace other channel binding wires, indicative of a second binding site. Upon photo-excitation of all rhenium wires, the resting state Fe(III) heme is reduced to Fe(II) heme in less than 10 ns, characterized by transient absorption spectroscopy. This ET rate is orders of magnitude faster than Fe(III) reduction by the reductase domain (kET = 1 s- 1) under biological conditions. In some cases, the wires were observed to ligate the Fe(II), creating a six-coordinate Fe(II) complex. The fully coordinated Fe(II) species is prevented from binding oxygen, and the catalytic mechanism is terminated. Another electron cannot be injected, and there is no production of NO. In the cases where the wire was shorter, ligation of the Fe(II) species was not observed. The Fe(II) remains five-coordinate, leaving room for oxygen to bind and for the mechanism to continue. In this case, NOS catalytic activity was assayed for the production of NO by photo-excitation of the wires. Complications of photodecomposition of NO indicators presented a challenge in data analysis. It is possible that a very small amount of NO was produced by photo-excitation of the wire; unfortunately, nothing definitely can be concluded. A new method to assay for NOS catalytic activity was proposed. Both channel and surface binding wires led to many insights on substrate binding modes at the protein active site and on the surface; ET mechanisms were redefined, including amino acid radicals participating in electron transfer processes; and future directions for new wire were designed with hopes of accomplishing the long standing goal of characterizing high-valent Fe species...|$|E

2500|$|Double wire, twin loop, or Wire-O binding {{is a type}} of binding that is {{used for}} books that will be viewed or read in an office or home type environment.

Double <b>wire</b> <b>binding</b> allows books to have smooth crossover and is affordable in many colors. This binding is great for annual reports, owners manuals and software manuals. Wire bound books are made of individual sheets, each punched with a line of round or square holes on the binding edge. This type of binding uses either a 3:1 pitch hole pattern with three holes per inch or a 2:1 pitch hole pattern with two holes per inch. The three to one hole pattern is used for smaller books that are up to 9/16" [...] in diameter while the 2:1 pattern is normally used for thicker books as the holes are slightly bigger to accommodate slightly thicker, stronger wire. Once punched, the back cover is then placed on to the front cover ready for the <b>wire</b> <b>binding</b> elements (double loop wire) to be inserted. The wire is then placed through the holes. The next step involves the binder holding the book by its pages and inserting the wire into a [...] "closer" [...] which is basically a vise that crimps the wire closed and into its round shape.

30|$|The Time 2 bracket did {{not comply}} with this correlation; {{although}} it featured a reduced mesio-distal width, it showed higher levels of RS (1.50 N) compared with the other tested brackets (Table  3). The clear angle at the mesial and distal slot edges of Time 2, which is a specific feature of this bracket, could be responsible for this finding. Indeed, when the wire contacts both opposing edges of the slot (active configuration), the presence of clear edges could increase the <b>binding</b> of the <b>wire</b> and consequently the RS[25]. Therefore, bracket slot design featuring chamfered slot edges (Figure  4) could be an important requisite for a low-friction bracket system.

40|$|We are {{investigating}} the redox chemistry of the heme domains of wild type BM 3 (WT) and mutant 1 - 12 G. Compared to WT, 1 - 12 G combines 16 amino acid mutations to produce BM 3 variants that show high activity towards a variety of substrate. We hypothesize that these differences in catalysis are partially {{due to differences in}} the redox properties of the heme. Evidence suggests that the 16 mutations in 1 - 12 G cause some perturbation of the heme?s electronics, leading to alterations in redox properties. One aspect of this project is to monitor and investigate the P 450 catalytic production of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) via an oxygen reaction. To investigate this oxygen reaction, surfactant films were cast onto the surface of glassy carbon rotated disk electrodes (GCE). Experiments using rotated electrodes allow one to apply the Levich equation.

40|$|Aggressive {{scaling of}} {{nanoscale}} CMOS integrated circuits has created significant design challenges arising from increasing power densities, thermal concerns, and rising wire delays. The main contribution of this dissertation {{is the development}} of unified physical and high-level synthesis techniques for the design of ASICs with optimal chip temperatures and interconnect delays. Thermal issues are becoming a serious problem in high-performance VLSI circuits, adversely impacting performance, reliability, power consumption, and cooling costs. To address this, we present a temperature-aware behavioral synthesis (TABS) framework that combines power minimization with temperature-aware task scheduling, resource binding, and floorplanning. Compared to conventional low-power synthesis methods, our approach is effective in synthesizing circuits with lower chip temperatures and more uniform thermal distributions, with temperature reductions up to 23 % when compared to low-power synthesis. We propose three techniques to address interconnect delays during high-level synthesis: (1) a simulated annealing (SA) based layout-aware high-level synthesis technique for 3 -D integrated circuits, that tightly couples the synthesis tasks of resource binding and 3 -D floorplanning. The proposed algorithm significantly outperforms a conventional synthesis flow that separates the binding and floorplanning steps, with improvements in the total wirelength by 29 % and of the longest wirelength by 21 %; (2) a floorplan-aware high-level synthesis technique that uses the topology of multi-terminal nets to improve interconnect delay estimates during resource binding. Experiments show that the use of accurate wire delay estimates during <b>binding</b> can reduce <b>wire</b> delays by as much as 49 % in 70 nm technology; (3) an iterative high-level design-space exploration engine that uses a priori stochastic wirelength estimates to guide binding decisions during high-level synthesis. The proposed approach offers a significant speed-up during design space exploration when compared to approaches that use traditional place-and-route to evaluate candidate solutions. Finally, we present a genetic algorithm (GA) based approach for high-level synthesis. We propose novel GA encoding, crossover, and mutation operators for the problem. The quality of the results generated by the GA are superior to those of several other techniques reported in the literature...|$|R

Prepared for exhibition {{was a group}} of combs from the late 19 th and early 20 th century originating from the collections of the MAA. This collection in particular had never been examined from a technological point of view or been assessed in terms of its conservation and preservation needs. Therefore this dissertation focuses on a selection of combs from this collection. These include four metal composite combs, showing corrosion of metal binding, as well as fifteen glass-beaded composite combs that show signs of deterioration (glass disease). In addition there are surface residues/applications, consisting of oil, fat, wax and resin, and evidence of use, such as hair. Some pigments have also been observed. From these objects an investigation of the technology, deterioration and conservation was initiated. An extensive literature review was undertaken on all aspects of the objects, including sources to elucidate possible pesticide contamination. Thereafter examinations were undertaken with a broad range of analytical techniques, including Fibre optics reflectance spectroscopy (FORS), X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The aim was to identify material composition but also to characterise corrosion products of metal and glass to assist in the conservation process. It was determined that when caring for this kind of collection of ethnographic material, a case-by-case approach is the most appropriate.

The main focus {{of this study is to}} relate the spatial and temporal variations in shear stress with the extent of oxidative stress, specifically in arterial branching points in comparison with straight regions in the vessels. For this purpose, a micro shear stress sensor has been designed and fabricated with the backside <b>wire</b> <b>binding</b> feature. The sensors were flush mounted in a 3 -D scaled up model of carotid arterial bifurcation to measure the spatial variations in shear stress. These measurements were validated by computational fluid dynamics simulations. Arteries with complex geometries develop a low profile and bidirectional type of shear stress, namely oscillatory however unidirectional and high profile of shear stress, namely pulsatile shear stress develops at straight regions of the vessels. We compared the extent of oxidative stress for the endothelial cells which were exposed to these types of flow profiles which were reconstructed by a programmed step motor.; Reactive oxygen species (ROS), particularly superoxide anion initiate the oxidative modification of low density lipoprotein (LDL) which is one of the fundamental processes to develop plaque formation in cardiovascular disease. NADPH oxidase and mitochondrial respiratory chain are considered as major sources of generation of superoxide. Conversely, nitric oxide is considered atheroprotective and vasodilator. This research has studied the pathways for expression of the enzymes and proteins involved in the generation of free radicals or antioxidants in response to oscillatory and pulsatile shear stress including: subunit NOX 4 of NADPH oxidase, eNOS, SOD isoforms, nitrotyrosine, LDL oxidation and nitration using different biochemical techniques. This investigation demonstrated that oscillatory shear stress induced LDL oxidation and nitrotyrosine formation however pulsatile shear stress downregulated both. We studied if 17 beta-estradial as a cardioprotective reagent could attenuate the oscillatory shear stressmediated LDL oxidation. Finally an application of nanotechnology for detection of oxidized LDL is introduced by application of indium oxide nanowire and carbon nanotube based field effect transistors. We observed chemical gating of these transistors upon exposure to oxidized LDL. In conclusion, this interdisciplinary study interfaces fluid shear stress with vascular oxidative stress by application of micro and nano sensors for measurement of shear stress and oxidative modification of LDL...|$|R
40|$|Nanomaterials with sizes {{comparable}} to that of features of mammalian cells have a variety of applications in the clinical setting. In this thesis, I focused on functionalized silicon nanowires (SiNWs) as well as graphene for both biological and biomedical applications. ^ First, I demonstrated the potential of using graphene as a protective coating in biological environments. As a preliminary test, I carried out a chemical experiment was conducted in a 37 °C oven for several days in order to mimic in vitro and in vivo conditions. This test was used to confirm that the presence of a graphene layer on copper substrates effectively inhibited the corrosion of the underlying metal substrate by ensuring that the Cu 2 + ion concentration was low in aqueous biological media. For the in vitro studies, osteosarcoma cells were incubated in the presences of the samples and the viability of the cells was measured daily using the metabolic activity assay, 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT). The MTT dye undergoes a color change when exposed to metabolic activity, so the solution was purple when exposed to living cells and yellow when the cells had died. Absorbance measurements were obtained for the samples as well as the control (cells without the presence of samples) and the measurements were converted to viability. The results of this cell viability test suggested that the graphene coating effectively protected the metal substrate from corrosion and thus, protected the cells from exposure to Cu 2 + ions. Additionally, to boost the protective properties of graphene, a thiol coating was assembled on the copper surface to fill in any defects in the graphene coating. This was also tested with transferred graphene, which showed acceptable protection when the thiol coating was utilized. Importantly, since metal ions are known to cause inflammatory reactions in many patients, a lymphocyte transformation test was carried out to confirm that the graphene layer present on the copper substrate inhibited an immune response. Finally, an in vivo experiment was carried out by surgically inserting either bare copper foil or copper foil with a coating of single layer graphene next to the spine of a live rat. This was used to confirm that graphene exhibits protective properties under typical physiological conditions. ^ Lastly, I utilized functionalized silicon nanowires to show, for the first time, that the uptake mechanism of these high aspect ratio one-dimensional (1 D) nanomaterials occurs via a physically-driven membrane wrapping mechanism. Experiments were carried out at two different incubation temperatures, 37 °C and 4 °C, in order to confirm that the process is physically driven rather than receptor-mediated. We chose 4 °C because it is well understood that many endocytic pathways are temperature dependent and that these pathways are limited to high temperatures, so uptake at a lower temperature suggest that the uptake is physically driven. For all experiments, the SiNWs with length of 5 µm were co-cultured with CHO-β cells and imaged at various time points. First, optical microscopy was used to confirm that the <b>wires</b> were <b>binding</b> and interacting at both incubation temperatures. These results showed that the interaction of the wires was insensitive to temperature. Next, to capture snapshots of the key features of the uptake process, I fixed the cells after culture with the wires and utilized cross-sectional TEM to visualize the cell membrane. From the samples incubated at both 37 °C and 4 °C, I was able to visualize the <b>wires</b> <b>binding</b> tangent to the membrane, the membrane changing shape to accommodate the wires, and a pocket of membrane surrounding the internalized wires. This confirmed that the membrane wrapped around the wire in order to internalize it. Finally, a fluorescent confocal experiment was carried out to further understand the membrane interactions as well as gather three-dimensional (3 D) information through a z-axis scan. To visualize the cell membrane, the cells were stained with DiI (red) after the removal of the wires and images were taken at steps along the z-axis. Notably, when the SiNWs were incubated with DiI without the presence of cells, they did not fluoresce. However, after co-culture with the cells, the wires that were internalized fluoresced. These results further confirmed that the internalization pathway occurred through membrane wrapping. ...|$|R
