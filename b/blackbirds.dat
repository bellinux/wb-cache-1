5|$|Common <b>blackbirds</b> {{spend much}} of their time looking for food on the ground where they can become infested with ticks, which are {{external}} parasites that most commonly attach to the head of a blackbird. In France, 74% of rural <b>blackbirds</b> were found to be infested with Ixodes ticks, whereas, only 2% of <b>blackbirds</b> living in urban habitats were infested. This is partly because it is more difficult for ticks to find another host on lawns and gardens in urban areas than in uncultivated rural areas, and partly because ticks are likely to be commoner in rural areas, where a variety of tick hosts, such as foxes, deer and boar, are more numerous. Although ixodid ticks can transmit pathogenic viruses and bacteria, and are known to transmit Borrelia bacteria to birds, {{there is no evidence that}} this affects the fitness of <b>blackbirds</b> except when they are exhausted and run down after migration.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} {{passerine}} birds, parasites are common. 88% of common <b>blackbirds</b> {{were found to}} have intestinal parasites, most frequently Isospora and Capillaria species. and more than 80% had haematozoan parasites (Leucocytozoon, Plasmodium, Haemoproteus and Trypanosoma species).|$|E
5|$|The {{icterids}} are a {{group of}} small to medium-sized, often colorful passerine birds restricted to the New World and include the grackles, New World <b>blackbirds</b> and New World orioles. Most species have black as a predominant plumage color, often enlivened by yellow, orange or red.|$|E

5|$|Two related Asian Turdus thrushes, the white-collared {{blackbird}} (T. albocinctus) and the grey-winged blackbird (T. boulboul), {{are also}} named <b>blackbirds,</b> and the Somali thrush (T. (olivaceus) ludoviciae) is alternatively {{known as the}} Somali blackbird.|$|E
5|$|Foreign {{animals are}} also found, {{in common with}} much of Adelaide. While red foxes, cats, European rabbits, black rats, house mice and European hares are seen, {{there has been no}} {{systemic}} recording of alien fauna species. Exotic birds, including rock pigeons, European goldfinch, house sparrow, starlings and <b>blackbirds</b> are common. Introduced bees and European wasps are present, with the aggressive wasps an issue for the park's visitors.|$|E

5|$|In Europe, {{the common}} <b>blackbird</b> can be {{confused}} with the paler-winged first-winter ring ouzel (Turdus torquatus) or the superficially similar European starling (Sturnus vulgaris). A number of similar Turdus thrushes exist far outside the range of the common <b>blackbird,</b> for example the South American Chiguanco thrush (Turdus chiguanco). The Indian <b>blackbird,</b> the Tibetan <b>blackbird,</b> and the Chinese <b>blackbird</b> were formerly considered subspecies.|$|R
50|$|<b>Blackbird</b> {{purchased}} {{this house}} in about 1858 {{for the use}} of his family. When he was appointed postmaster, the house doubled as the post office, and residents picked up their main in the <b>Blackbird</b> kitchen. As the town grew and the salary of the postmaster increased, new residents disliked the arrangement, and in 1873 petitioned to have <b>Blackbird</b> removed. In response, <b>Blackbird</b> built an addition to his house to serve as the post office. However, <b>Blackbird</b> was removed as postmaster in 1877. <b>Blackbird</b> remained in the house until his death in 1908.|$|R

5|$|Near human {{habitation}} {{the main}} predator {{of the common}} blackbird is the domestic cat, with newly fledged young especially vulnerable. Foxes and predatory birds, such as the sparrowhawk and other accipiters, also take this species when the opportunity arises. However, there is little direct {{evidence to show that}} either predation of the adult <b>blackbirds</b> or loss of the eggs and chicks to corvids, such as the European magpie or Eurasian jay, decrease population numbers.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} old-growth forests with tree species and genera such as black oak, hickory, beech, cherry birch, sweetgum, red maple, and tuliptree. The forests also contain owls, bats, chipmunks, groundhogs, gypsy moths, rabbits, raccoons, opossums, coyotes. In addition, over 130 species of {{butterflies}} {{can be found}} in the park. In 1937, it was noted that the marshlands had fauna such as red-winged <b>blackbirds,</b> yellowthroats, green bottle flies, beetles, dragonflies, tadpoles, herons, kingfishers, and ospreys. Its flora included cattail, skunk cabbage, and moss.|$|E
5|$|Within {{its native}} Northern Hemisphere range, the first-year male common {{blackbird}} of the nominate race may start singing {{as early as}} late January in fine weather {{in order to establish}} a territory, followed in late March by the adult male. The male's song is a varied and melodious low-pitched fluted warble, given from trees, rooftops or other elevated perches mainly in the period from March to June, sometimes into the beginning of July. It has a number of other calls, including an aggressive seee, a pook-pook-pook alarm for terrestrial predators like cats, and various chink and chook, chook vocalisations. The territorial male invariably gives chink-chink calls in the evening in an (usually unsuccessful) attempt to deter other <b>blackbirds</b> from roosting in its territory overnight. During the northern winter, <b>blackbirds</b> can be heard quietly singing to themselves, so much so that September and October are the only months in which the song cannot be heard. Like other passerine birds, it has a thin high seee alarm call for threats from birds of prey since the sound is rapidly attenuated in vegetation, making the source difficult to locate.|$|E

5000|$|A regular part {{of every}} episode was an {{appearance}} of the high tech powerboat. Built by scientist/inventor Logan [...] "FX" [...] Murphy (played by Steve Hytner), the <b>Blackbird</b> was a black trimaran speedboat that resembled a SR-71 reconnaissance plane. It was originally commissioned by the previous owner of <b>Blackbird</b> Castle, a drug runner. After his arrest, Tarberry took possession of the <b>Blackbird</b> from Murphy. When not in use, the <b>Blackbird</b> was moored at a secret dock at <b>Blackbird</b> Castle on San Pietro Island.|$|R
5|$|Many {{species of}} birds have been spotted in the Little Butte Creek region. Twenty-two species are known to breed in the {{chaparral}} region, including several species of wrens, <b>blackbirds,</b> and sparrows. The mixed coniferous forest is home to white-headed woodpeckers, pygmy nuthatches, green-tailed towhees, northern pygmy-owls, Vaux's swifts, winter wrens, and MacGillivray's warblers. The American coot has also been spotted in several places along the creek. Williamson's sapsuckers, black-backed woodpeckers, gray jays, and hermit warblers frequent the higher elevations. The near-threatened olive-sided flycatcher and Cassin's finch also live in this area. Eurasian three-toed woodpeckers and Clark's nutcrackers have been spotted near the tree line. The endangered Townsend's big-eared bat is known {{to live in the}} watershed.|$|E
5|$|Since European Settlement {{the native}} plant {{life has been}} {{considerably}} affected, with the native manna gum and blue gum woodlands being largely cleared for agricultural uses. The large amount of non-native vegetation in the gully is predominantly {{the result of the}} early agriculture, although some species were introduced by accident. Introduced species include olive trees, hawthorn, fennel and blackberry. With the reduction of native flora, exotic fauna have flourished around the Waterfall Gully region. These include rabbits, <b>blackbirds</b> and starlings. However, not all of the native wildlife has been lost—bats (in particular, Gould's wattled bat), {{can be found in the}} area, as can superb fairy-wrens and Adelaide rosellas, and a large number of unique Australian animals such as kangaroos, koalas and possums can be spotted on some of the walking trails.|$|E
5|$|The German birds {{wintering}} in British gardens rely on provided food, and {{the major}} items are bread and fat, each making up around 20% of the diet; one bird survived the whole winter eating only Christmas cake. Fruit is also eaten, notably cotoneaster (41% of the fruit consumed), ivy and honeysuckle, and apple if available. Some birds have learned to take peanuts from feeders. Blackcaps defend good winter food sources in the wild, and at garden feeding stations they repel competitors as large as starlings and <b>blackbirds.</b> Birds occasionally become tame enough to feed from the hand.|$|E

5|$|Waterfowl at {{the refuge}} include Canada Geese, Wood Ducks, swans, Northern Pintails, Green Herons, teal, mergansers, Belted Kingfishers, and American Wigeon among others. Birds that spend time there include, Great Blue Herons, Sandhill Cranes, Oregon Juncos, wrens, European Starlings, <b>blackbirds,</b> nuthatches, Pacific-slope Flycatchers, Red-tailed Hawks, American Goldfinches, Peregrine Falcons, Yellow Warblers, Western Flycatchers, Killdeer, Northern Harriers, Ospreys, egrets, quail, pheasants, Golden-crowned Kinglets, owls, and Black-headed Grosbeaks {{to name a}} few. There is also a pair of Bald Eagles. The year it was created {{officials}} counted 24 different bird species. By 2008 there were 185 birds species represented at the refuge.|$|E
5|$|The {{flight of}} the {{fieldfare}} is slow and direct. It takes several strong beats then closes its wings briefly before flapping on. It is highly gregarious, quite shy and easily scared {{in the winter and}} bold and noisy in the breeding season. When a group is in a tree they all tend to face in the same direction, keeping up a constant chatter. When foraging on the ground, often in association with redwings, the group works its way up wind, each bird pausing every so often to stand erect and gaze around before resuming feeding. When alarmed they fly off down wind and the feeding group reforms elsewhere. In woodland they do not skulk in the undergrowth as do <b>blackbirds</b> or song thrushes, instead they perch in the open on bushes and high branches. They roost socially, sometimes in overgrown hedges and shrubberies but usually on the ground. Common sites are in rough grass among bushes or clumps of rushes, in young plantations, on stubble and in the furrows of ploughed fields.|$|E
