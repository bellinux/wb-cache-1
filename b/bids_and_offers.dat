25|$|The {{launch of}} the Stock Exchange Automated Trading System (SEATS). It {{was a far cry}} from the {{original}} system which dated back over 100 years. During that time there had been three different forms of trading on the Australian stock exchanges. The earliest was the auction-based call system, which saw a stock exchange employee (the caller) call the name of each listed security in turn while members bid, offered, sold or bought the stock at each call. This system proved inadequate to handle the increased volume of trading during the mining booms. It was replaced by the 'post' system in the early 1960s, which involved stocks being quoted on 'posts' or 'boards'. 'Chalkies' were employed by the Stock Exchange and it was their function to record in chalk the <b>bids</b> <b>and</b> <b>offers</b> of the operators (employees of stockbrokers) and the sales made. This system stayed in place until 1991.|$|E
2500|$|Trading was {{conducted}} by a call system, where an exchange employee called the names of each company and brokers bid or offered on each. [...] In the 1960s, this changed to a post system. [...] Exchange employees called [...] "chalkies" [...] wrote <b>bids</b> <b>and</b> <b>offers</b> in chalk on blackboards continuously, and recorded transactions made.|$|E
50|$|In most {{practical}} application an order book contains <b>bid</b> <b>and</b> <b>offer</b> for one security, contract or good, with a specialist matching {{orders for the}} specific item. In his work, Jean-François Mertens extends this and constructs an order matching mechanism that works across specialists, wherehe can cross orders that are {{not only in terms}} of <b>bid</b> <b>and</b> <b>offer</b> for a given traded item, but <b>bids</b> <b>and</b> <b>offer</b> can be expressed linearly in function of other traded items.|$|R
5000|$|A {{mid-price}} {{order is}} an order whose limit price is continually {{set at the}} average of the [...] "best bid" [...] and [...] "best offer" [...] prices in the market. The values of the <b>bid</b> <b>and</b> <b>offer</b> prices used in this calculation may be either a local or national best <b>bid</b> <b>and</b> <b>offer.</b> They are also called Peg-to-Midpoint.|$|R

2500|$|In {{economic}} terms, electricity (both {{power and}} energy) is a commodity {{capable of being}} bought, sold, and traded. An electricity market is a system enabling purchases, through bids to buy; [...] sales, through offers to sell; and short-term trades, generally {{in the form of}} financial or obligation swaps. <b>Bids</b> <b>and</b> <b>offers</b> use supply and demand principles to set the price. Long-term trades are contracts similar to power purchase agreements and generally considered private bi-lateral transactions between counterparties.|$|E
2500|$|This is {{generally}} done {{by using a}} physical representation of a trader's intentions with his hands. [...] If a trader wants to buy ten contracts at a price of eight, for example, in the pit he would yell [...] "8 for 10", stating price before quantity, and turn his palm inward toward his face, putting his index finger to his forehead denoting ten; {{if he were to}} be buying one, he would place his index finger on his chin. [...] If the trader wants to sell five contracts at a price of eight, they would yell [...] "5 at 8", stating quantity before price, and show one hand with palm facing outward, showing 5 fingers. [...] The combination of hand-signals and vocal representation between the way a trader expresses <b>bids</b> <b>and</b> <b>offers</b> is a protection against misinterpretation by other market participants. For historical purposes, an illustrated project to record the hand signal language used in CBOT's trading pits has been compiled and published.|$|E
50|$|In an open outcry auction, <b>bids</b> <b>and</b> <b>offers</b> must be {{made out}} in the open market giving all {{participants}} a chance to compete for the order with the best price. New bids or offers would be made if better than previous pricing for efficient price discovery. Exchanges also value positions marked to these public market prices on a daily basis. In contrast, over-the-counter markets are where <b>bids</b> <b>and</b> <b>offers</b> are negotiated privately between principals.|$|E

5000|$|Matchbook FX {{functioned as}} an open limit order-book, {{also known as}} a Central Limit Order Book or CLOB - similar to an online {{exchange}} - where any participant subscribed to the network could either post its own <b>bids</b> <b>and</b> <b>offers</b> just like a market maker, or immediately trade on any other existing <b>bids</b> <b>and</b> <b>offers</b> for a given currency. This process allowed users to join or better the prevailing prices in the network and thus directly impact (and tighten) the bid-ask spread widths on which they traded. As such, Matchbook FX was considered {{to be one of the}} main catalysts that presaged rapid technological advances, sharp compressions in bid/ask spreads, and other sweeping changes into the currency market.|$|E

Orders, already placed by the clients, are entered in the system by the brokers sitting behind their stations in the trading floor. The system processes the orders and executes the transaction upon matching of the bid and offer prices.|$|E
50|$|For {{exchange-traded}} derivatives, {{market price}} is usually transparent (often published {{in real time}} by the exchange, based on all the current <b>bids</b> <b>and</b> <b>offers</b> placed on that particular contract at any one time). Complications can arise with OTC or floor-traded contracts though, as trading is handled manually, {{making it difficult to}} automatically broadcast prices. In particular with OTC contracts, there is no central exchange to collate and disseminate prices.|$|E
50|$|According to a 2009 Bloomberg article: Flash systems {{trace their}} roots {{as far back}} as 1978 to efforts by exchanges to {{electronically}} replicate how a trader might yell an order to floor brokers before entering it into the system that displays all <b>bids</b> <b>and</b> <b>offers.</b> Markets have evolved since the days of floor brokers’ dominance, with computer algorithms now buying and selling shares 1,000 times faster than the blink of an eye.|$|E

50|$|Initially, {{an outcry}} method of trading (a method of trading that uses verbal <b>bids</b> <b>and</b> <b>offers</b> in the trading pits) in shares was adopted which was {{replaced}} with the automated trading system (a computerized system for matching orders in securities) commonly called “ISE-CTS” in 1997.

50|$|Public company {{securities}} {{that are}} not listed, traded or quoted on any U.S. stock exchange or the OTC markets are sometimes purchased or sold over the counter (OTC) via the grey market. Grey market securities have no market makers quoting the stock. Since grey market securities are not traded or quoted on an exchange or interdealer quotation system, investors' <b>bids</b> <b>and</b> <b>offers</b> are not collected in a central spot so market transparency is diminished and effective execution of orders is difficult.|$|E
50|$|Some exchanges are {{physical}} {{locations where}} transactions {{are carried out}} on a trading floor, by a method known as open outcry. This method is used in some stock exchanges and commodity exchanges, and involves traders shouting <b>bid</b> <b>and</b> <b>offer</b> prices. The other type of stock exchange has a network of computers where trades are made electronically. An example of such an exchange is the NASDAQ.|$|R
50|$|The company {{suggested}} {{standards for}} electronic firms that call themselves market makers. Virtu believes market makers should be obligated to quote {{at or near}} the inside of the national best <b>bid</b> <b>and</b> <b>offer</b> throughout the day and quote at various price points {{in a number of different}} securities. Virtu was ranked as one of the five largest high-frequency traders of equities in Europe in 2011.|$|R
25|$|Supporting these transactions, {{there are}} three central {{securities}} depositories and four clearing organizations that assure the settlement of large volumes of trades. Market data consolidators inform investors and regulators in real time of the <b>bid</b> <b>and</b> <b>offer</b> prices of each security through one of two securities information processing systems. The basis for these transactions is controlled both through self-regulatory organizations and the two securities commissions, the SEC and the CFTC.|$|R
