40|$|To {{improve the}} {{effectiveness}} of higher education, Dutch universities implemented the <b>binding</b> study <b>advice</b> at medical faculties. Accordingly, medicine students of Radboud University need to gain >/= 42 out of 60 European Credit Transfer System (ECTS) credits to obtain a positive <b>binding</b> study <b>advice</b> and to continue their study programme. In case of a negative advice, the student is obliged to terminate the study, and he/she cannot register for the same study programme in the Netherlands within the next three years. The purpose of this manuscript is to evaluate the effect of implementation of the <b>binding</b> study <b>advice</b> on study outcomes. First, the <b>binding</b> study <b>advice</b> did not impact on student performance, as the average ECTS credits were comparable before and after its introduction. Second, study progress improved 8 % with 93 % of the students obtaining access to {{the second year of}} the study programme after <b>binding</b> study <b>advice</b> implementation. Third, the <b>binding</b> study <b>advice</b> did not impact propaedeutic graduation rates. These data demonstrate that the implementation of the <b>binding</b> study <b>advice</b> in medical faculties has only a small impact on study outcomes. The high performance levels of medical students compared with peers at other faculties are likely to contribute to these findings and suggest a 'ceiling effect' in the potential improvement of study outcomes at medical faculties...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, medical faculties at Dutch {{universities}} have implemented a legally <b>binding</b> study <b>advice</b> to students {{of medicine and}} biomedical sciences during their propaedeutic phase. Appropriate examination is essential to discriminate between poor (grade /= 8) students. Therefore, we compared the discriminatory properties of extended matching questions (EMQs) versus multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and identified the role of sex, age and examination preference on this score. Data were collected for 452 first-year medical and biomedical science students during three distinct course examinations: one examination with EMQ only, one with MCQ only and one mixed examination (including EMQ and MCQ). Logistic regression analysis revealed that MCQ examination was 3 times better in identifying poor students compared with EMQ (RR 3. 0, CI 2. 0 - 4. 5), whereas EMQ better detected excellent students (average grade >/= 8) (RR 1. 93, CI 1. 47 - 2. 53). Mixed examination had comparable characteristics to MCQ. Sex and examination preference did not impact the score of the student. Students >/= 20 years had a 4 -fold higher risk ratio of obtaining a poor grade (< 6) compared with students </= 18 years old (RR 4. 1, CI 2. 1 - 8. 0). Given the strong discriminative capacity of MCQ examinations to identify poor students, we recommend {{the use of this}} type of examination during the propaedeutic phase of medicine and biomedical science study programmes, {{in the light of the}} <b>binding</b> study <b>advice...</b>|$|R

Unlike previous aspect-oriented calculi {{and core}} languages, MiniMAO 1 allows around advice {{to change the}} target object of an advised operation before proceeding. MiniMAO 1 accurately models the ways AspectJ allows changing the target object, e. g., at call join points. Practical uses for changing the target object using advice include proxies and other wrapper objects. MiniMAO 1 was designed {{to serve as a}} core language for studying modular specification and verification in the aspect-oriented paradigm. To this end MiniMAO 1 •has an imperative, reference-based semantics,•models the control-flow effects of changing target object <b>bindings</b> with <b>advice,</b> and•has a safe static type system. The first two features make MiniMAO 1  suitable for the study of aspect-oriented mechanisms, such as those found in AspectJ. These features are important for studying the interaction of aspect-oriented language features with modular specification and verification. A statically type-safe language is also important for such research. AspectJ does not have a safe static type system. To achieve static type safety MiniMAO 1 uses a slightly different form of proceed and <b>advice</b> <b>binding</b> than in AspectJ. These changes are sufficient for static type safety, but we do not claim that they are necessary; a less restrictive type system might suffice.

40|$|Most {{universities}} in the Netherlands have an academic dismissal policy: students who gain less ECTS than a certain threshold can be expelled from the programme. The university of Groningen introduced the <b>binding</b> study <b>advice</b> (BSA) in 2010 to enhance study success. In 2010 and 2011 students had to attain 40 out of the 60 ECTS in the first year. As a consequence performance of first year students improved significantly. In 2012 the threshold was heightened to 45 ECTS. Furthermore, by means of statistical modelling, we examined what effect a raise of 5 additional ECTS would have on good, median and poor students. Not only poor but also median students would be in danger of getting expelled with a threshold of 50 ECTS. Therefore we can conclude that a threshold of 45 ECTS is sufficient as a dismissal policy...|$|R

The PMO also includes speech writers, strategists, and communications staffers who shape the prime minister's and Cabinet's message as well as keeping the prime minister informed on events that take place in government and across the country. They also act as a link between the political party organization and the government.|$|E

To remain in the study program stu-dents are required to obtain at least 40 out of a total of 60 credits during the propaedeutic phase.

Repeated study sessions are beneficial for knowledge retention [1, 2].

Students with insufficient progress {{after the first year}} and who therefore do not conform to pre-defined BSA norms have to quit their program. This study investigated whether the introduction of the BSA is associated with differences in first-year study behaviors and students' pre-university education qualifications when entering university, which has to date been unexplored. Cohorts to which the BSA did (BSA group) or did not apply (pre-BSA group) in a problem-based psychology bachelor program were compared. Results showed that students' observed learning activities were rated higher by tutors after the BSA introduction than before. The BSA group did not spend more time on self-study and obtained lower course test scores than the pre-BSA group. At enrolment, differences were found in students' level of prior education but not with respect to their pre-university grades. © 2013 Society for Research into Higher Education...|$|R
50|$|King Sobhuza II died in August 1982, and Queen Regent Dzeliwe {{assumed the}} duties of the head of state. In 1984, an {{internal}} dispute led to the replacement of the prime minister and eventual replacement of Dzeliwe by a new Queen Regent Ntombi. Ntombi's only child, Prince Makhosetive, was named heir to the Swazi throne. Real power at this time was concentrated in the Liqoqo, a supreme traditional advisory body that claimed to give <b>binding</b> <b>advice</b> to the Queen Regent. In October 1985, Queen Regent Ntombi demonstrated her power by dismissing the leading figures of the Liqoqo. Prince Makhosetive returned from school in England to ascend to the throne and help end the continuing internal disputes. He was enthroned as Ingwenyama Mswati III on April 25, 1986. Shortly afterwards he abolished the Liqoqo. In November 1987, a new parliament was elected and a new cabinet appointed.|$|E

In the extended language, the programmer can superimpose additional or alternative functionality (aka advice) onto points along the execution of a program. Adding superimposition to a language semantics comes down to three steps: (i) the semantic functions are elaborated to carry advice; (ii) the semantic equations are turned into `reflective' style so that they can be altered at will; (iii) a construct for <b>binding</b> <b>advice</b> is integrated.

40|$|In {{the female}} dog, the mammary gland tumor {{is the most}} {{prevalent}} tumor. The Progesterone Receptor exists in two independently regulated functional isoforms, Progesterone Receptor A (PRA) and Progesterone Receptor B (PRB). Dogs {{are known to have}} a different sequence and function of an important regulatory function element of PRB, compared to other species. This may be a causative factor in the very high prevalence of canine mammary gland tumors. So far, PRB expression has never been identified in dogs. The main goal of this 3 month research was thus to detect the PRB isoform in canine mammary gland tissue using immunohistochemistry and Western Blot. For PRB detection, 2 new PRB-specific antibodies were tested, the results of which were compared to an antibody that is known to detect both PRA and PRB. Using the two new antibodies did result in staining of the slides, and we continued our research with the one that we thought was best. For this antibody we found mild to moderate staining of the nucleus as well as the cytoplasm of epithelial cells. Staining of the stromal compartment was also found, but very infrequent. Testing of the specificity of this antibody for Progesterone Receptor B then followed. At present, we are unable to prove that the results obtained in immunohistochemistry were the result of specific binding of the investigated primary antibody to Progesterone Receptor B, but do have some reasons not to conclude it’s definitely not caused by specific <b>binding</b> either. The <b>advice</b> would be to continue on after this project with the antibody used, with some adjustments {{in order to be able}} to test our hypothesis...|$|R
