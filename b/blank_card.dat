5|$|Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) {{decides to}} start {{painting}} her mural in the warehouse, {{but has a}} hard time getting started as she is afraid of it not being perfect. Meanwhile, bored with having to fill out customer complaint cards (which he finds redundant because the complaints are already in the computer), Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) uses them to build a card tower in the annex with other employees. The card tower takes on a deeper meaning for the employees when Pete points out that it is composed of failures made by every one of them (excepting only Pam), and thus proves that they should not be ashamed of their failures. They decide {{to try to make it}} go all the way to the ceiling, but end up one complaint card short. Not wanting to use a <b>blank</b> <b>card</b> as it would defy the point of the tower, Pam offers to complete the tower by getting her first customer complaint. She calls one of their smaller clients, delivers a yo mama joke, and hangs up. The client, whose mother was actually obese and is now deceased, drops Dunder Mifflin as their paper supplier, leaving them simultaneously excited over getting that last complaint and disappointed over losing a client. After celebrating the completion of the card tower, Pam finally starts painting the mural, saying artists should not care too much in what others think, further asserting this by telling off Hide (Hidetoshi Imura) when he insults her artwork.|$|E
25|$|When {{the time}} for balloting arrives, the electors choose {{one or two people}} to act as tellers. Some states provide for the placing in {{nomination}} of a candidate to receive the electoral votes (the candidate for president of the political party of the electors). Each elector submits a written ballot with the name of a candidate for president. In New Jersey, the electors cast ballots by checking the name of the candidate on a pre-printed card; in North Carolina, the electors write the name of the candidate on a <b>blank</b> <b>card.</b> The tellers count the ballots and announce the result. The next step is the casting of the vote for vice president, which follows a similar pattern.|$|E
25|$|When Julieta {{drives to}} the {{location}} of the retreat in the Pyrenees three months later, she is informed that her daughter has already left, and does not want her location disclosed to her mother. Julieta is racked by the loss and her attempts to find Antía are unsuccessful. The only contact she has is a <b>blank</b> <b>card</b> on her 19th, 20th and 21st birthdays. After the latter she is enraged and destroys most traces of her daughter in her life, moving from her apartment. She visits Ava, who has multiple sclerosis and is dying. Ava tells her that Antía knew about the argument that precipitated Xoan's death and blamed Julieta and Ava, and that she had ultimately internalised guilt about this because she was away at camp at the time. At Ava's funeral, Julieta meets Lorenzo and the two embark on a happy relationship, which distracts Julieta from her loss. She tells him nothing of Antía and he respects that she has some secrets in her life.|$|E

Conrad, like his fellow candidates, underwent several days of what they considered to be invasive, demeaning, and unnecessary medical and psychological testing at the Lovelace Clinic in New Mexico. Unlike his fellow candidates, Conrad rebelled against the regimen. During a Rorschach inkblot test, he told the psychiatrist that one blot card revealed a sexual encounter complete with lurid detail.

6000|$|Rollo {{asked his}} mother {{if she would}} not be kind enough to help them fix their apparatus; but she said she would give them {{particular}} directions, though she should prefer letting them do the whole themselves, and then, if they met with any difficulties, they might come and report them to her, and she would tell them how to surmount them. So she recommended to them to go and find a <b>blank</b> <b>card,</b> or piece of white pasteboard, or of stiff white paper, as big as a common card. [...] "Then," [...] said she, [...] "choose some window where the sun shines in at noon, and put the card down upon the sill, and drive the pin down through it. But you must not drive the pin through the middle of the card, for the shadow will always be off {{to the north of the}} pin, and therefore the pin may be pretty near the south end of the card. Then the shadow will be more likely to come wholly upon the card, even when it is longest. You had better place the card in such a position, too, that its sides shall lie in the direction of north and south. Then the shadow at noon will lie along exactly in the middle of it. You must get a large and stout pin, too; and drive it in firmly, a little way, with a small hammer. It will be well, too, to drive another smaller pin into the other end of the card, so as to keep it fixed in its north and south position." ...|$|E
