40|$|The {{amount and}} {{distribution}} of intramuscular fat in beef and pork {{are some of the}} most important quality characteristics because they highly influence the nutritional value and eating quality of the meat. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a suitable non–invasive alternative method that can provide both qualitative and quantitative information on <b>beef</b> <b>meats</b> with high spatial information. In this study, we used MRI technique in combination with image processing tools for the visualization and prediction of intramuscular fat distribution in <b>beef</b> <b>meats.</b> The results from image analysis were compared with the chemical reference result for the percentage of intramuscular fat. The results show a strong correlation (R^ 2 = 0. 98) between the MRI detected and chemically measured values. The distribution uniformity of intramuscular fat within the <b>beef</b> <b>meats</b> was evaluated by calculating their distribution and pixel size in the MRI according to four levels of beef quality grade (1 +, 1, 2, and 3) ...|$|R

25|$|On 1 November 2009, {{all three}} of the McDonald's in Iceland closed, {{primarily}} due to the chain's high cost of importing most of the chain's meat and vegetables, by McDonald's demands and standards, from the Eurozone. At the time, a Big Mac in Iceland cost 650 krona ($5.29), and the 20% price increase that would have been needed to stay in business would have increased that cost to 780 krona ($6.36). Fish, lamb and <b>beef</b> <b>meat</b> is produced in Iceland, while beef is often imported (but also exported).|$|E

The <b>beef</b> <b>meat</b> industry and the lamb industry are represented by Meat and Livestock Australia (MLA). [...] Live export of cattle and sheep from Australia to Asia and the Middle East is a large part of Australian meat export. Live export practices came under scrutiny after the carrier Cormo Express carrying 52 000 animals was turned away from Saudi Arabia in 2003 due to suspected cases of scabby mouth. The sheep were eventually given to Eritrea. Media coverage has led to calls from animal rights activists for the live export trade to cease.|$|E
2500|$|India {{is one of}} {{the biggest}} {{exporters}} of beef. Though some states of India impose various types of prohibition on beef prompted by religious aspects that are fueled by Caste And Religion based Politics. Hindu religious scripts do not condemn consumption of beef and experts conclude so. [...] In 2017, a rule against the slaughter of cattle and the eating of beef was signed into law by presidential assent as a modified version of Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960. Though the original act permits the humane slaughter of animals for food. Existing meat export policy in India prohibits the export of <b>beef</b> (<b>meat</b> of cow, oxen and calf). Bone in meat, carcass, half carcass of buffalo is also prohibited and is not permitted to be exported. Only the boneless meat of buffalo, meat of goat and sheep and birds is permitted for export. In 2017 India sought a total [...] "beef ban" [...] and Australian market analysts predicted that with the total ban of beef product export from India there would be market opportunities for leather traders and meat producers. They estimate there would be a twenty per cent shortage of beef and thirteen per cent shortage of leather in the world market.|$|E
