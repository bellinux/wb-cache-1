25|$|The {{lifecycle}} of T. gondii can be broadly summarized {{into two}} components: a sexual component that occurs only within cats (felids, wild or domestic), and an asexual component {{that can occur}} within virtually all warm-blooded animals, including humans, cats, and birds. <b>Because</b> <b>T.</b> gondii can sexually reproduce only within cats, cats are therefore the definitive host of T. gondii. All other hosts – in which only asexual reproduction can occur – are intermediate hosts.|$|E
2500|$|The T key's main {{component}} is 禾, and its shortcut character is 和. [...] It {{is associated with}} the following components: 禾, 竹, 夂, [...] 攵, 彳, and the top of 乞 (i.e., without the 乙). 竹 may also be found in its smaller form, as seen on the top of 筇. 丿 is also found on this key, <b>because</b> <b>T</b> is the first key in the zone (see above). [...] This means that if one is typing a component or character stroke by stroke, they would (generally) use T to represent a left-falling stroke.

2500|$|Basic food-handling safety {{practices}} {{can prevent}} or reduce {{the chances of}} becoming infected with T. gondii, such as washing unwashed fruits and vegetable and avoiding raw or undercooked meat, poultry, and seafood. Other unsafe practices such as drinking unpasteurized milk or untreated water can increase odds of infection. <b>Because</b> <b>T.</b> gondii is typically transmitted through cysts that reside in the tissues of infected animals, meat that is not properly prepared can present {{an increased risk of}} infection. Freezing meat for several days at subzero temperatures (0°F or −18°C) before cooking eliminates tissue cysts, which can rarely survive these temperatures. During cooking, whole cuts of red meat should be cooked to an internal temperature of 145°F (63°C). [...] Medium rare meat is generally cooked between 130 and 140°F (55 and 60°C), so cooking whole cuts of meat to medium is recommended. After cooking, a rest period of 3 min should be allowed before consumption. However, ground meat should be cooked to an internal temperature of at least 160°F (71°C) with no rest period. All poultry should be cooked to an internal temperature of at least 165°F (74°C). After cooking, a rest period of 3 min should be allowed before consumption.|$|E

2500|$|The IPP {{suffered}} a catastrophic defeat and even its leader, John Dillon, was not re-elected. It won only six seats in Ireland, its losses exaggerated by the [...] "first-past-the-post" [...] system which {{gave it a}} share of seats far short of its much {{larger share of the}} vote (21.7%) and the number of seats it would have won under a [...] "proportional representation" [...] ballot system. All but one of its seats were in Ulster. The exception was Waterford City, the seat previously held by John Redmond, who had died earlier in the year, and retained by his son Captain William Redmond. Four of their Ulster seats were part of the deal to avoid unionist victories which saved some for the party but may have cost it the support of Protestant voters elsewhere. The IPP came close to winning other seats in Louth and Wexford South, and in general their support held up better in the north and east of the island. The party was represented in Westminster by seven MPs <b>because</b> <b>T.</b> P. O'Connor won the Liverpool Scotland seat due to Irish emigrant votes. The remnants of the IPP in time became the Nationalist Party (Northern Ireland) under the leadership of Joseph Devlin.|$|E

50|$|As another example, let T ∈ L(V) and Σ be the algebra {{generated}} by {1, T}, where 1 is the identity operator.

50|$|The {{proof of}} (1) is as in Gödel's {{proof of the}} first incompleteness theorem. The proof of (2) is more involved.

50|$|A {{sketch of}} the proof of Zorn's lemma follows, {{assuming}} the axiom of choice. Suppose the lemma is false. Then there exists a partially ordered set, or poset, P such that every totally ordered subset has an upper bound, and every element has a bigger one.

50|$|A T that interprets {{arithmetic}} is ω-inconsistent if, {{for some}} property P of natural numbers (defined by a formula {{in the language}} of T), T proves P(0), P(1), P(2), and so on (that is, for every standard natural number n, T proves that P(n) holds), but T also proves that there is some natural number n (necessarily nonstandard) such that P(n) fails. This may not generate a contradiction within T <b>because</b> <b>T</b> {{may not be able to}} prove for any specific value of n that P(n) fails, only that there is such an n.|$|E
50|$|Now that we {{know our}} valid {{measuring}} lives, we can see which interests in Blackacre are valid. Obviously, the life estate to T's children is valid as they are the measuring lives. The life estate to T's grandchildren is also valid. Why? <b>Because</b> all of <b>T's</b> grandchildren must be born within 21 years of a measuring life. T's children are our measuring lives, all of T's grandchildren must be born before the last of T's children dies (or, at least be in the womb, which counts as being alive for rule against perpetuities purposes), meaning their interest would vest within 21 years of a measuring life. T's great-grandchildren's interest is invalidated by the rule. Why? <b>Because</b> <b>T's</b> grandchildren are free to reproduce after all of T's children have died. It is possible that one of T's grandchildren could have a child more than 21 years after T's last child dies, meaning the interest might not vest within 21 years of a life in being and thus the gift is to that extent void under the rule.|$|R
