During the nesting season, a female <b>Blanding's</b> <b>turtle</b> {{may be found}} more than a kilometer from where it hibernated. It is omnivorous, eating crustaceans and other invertebrates, fish, frogs, crayfish, carrion, berries, and vegetable debris. It is capable of catching live fish. <b>Blanding's</b> <b>turtle</b> may live to be 80 years. Based on the extreme lack of aging symptoms and lack of age related decline, these turtles are considered a negligibly senescent species.|$|R
40|$|The <b>Blanding's</b> <b>turtle,</b> a {{semi-aquatic}} freshwater species {{found in}} North America, {{is listed as}} a species at risk in 17 of the 18 state/provincial jurisdictions across its range (NatureServe, 2009). Furthermore, approximately 20 % of the global range of the <b>Blanding's</b> <b>turtle</b> is contained in Ontario (COSEWIC, 2005). The {{purpose of this study}} was to characterise the spatial ecology of <b>Blanding's</b> <b>turtles</b> in Ontario at multiple spatial scales, from a single island population to Ontario-wide habitat suitability modeling. I followed 38 <b>Blanding's</b> <b>turtles</b> (20 males, 13 gravid females, and 5 non-gravid females) in 2008 and 2009 on Grenadier Island in the St. Lawrence River, Ontario via radio-telemetry. Furthermore, I built habitat suitability models using historical <b>Blanding's</b> <b>turtle</b> records in Ontario and two machine learning algorithms: maximum entropy modeling (MAXENT) and boosted regression trees (BRTs). At the local scale, <b>Blanding's</b> <b>turtles</b> selected colder water with more submerged and floating vegetation and avoided open water. Reproductive class and month did not have a significant effect on the mean daily movement of turtles in May, July, and August. In June, however, gravid females moved significantly more than males. Gravid females also had significantly larger home ranges than both males and non-gravid females. At the landscape level, <b>Blanding's</b> <b>turtle</b> habitat suitability was best predicted by air temperature, wetland area, open water area, cropland area, and road density. Habitat suitability increased with increasing air temperature, wetland area, forested area, alvar area, bedrock outcrop area, and decreased with increasing cropland area, pastures and field area, precipitations, terrain ruggedness, and settlements and developed land. Mean area under the operating curve (AUC) values for habitat suitability models tested on independent data ranged from 0. 878 to 0. 912. My results highlight the importance of stratifying spatial analyses by reproductive class and time and of including terrestrial habitat in management plans for <b>Blanding's</b> <b>turtles...</b>|$|R
40|$|When {{implementing}} {{management decisions}} managers should utilize {{the most cost-effective}} strategies that also provide the most benefit for the managed species. There are many different management options to consider when the objective is conservation of long lived reptiles (e. g., turtles) {{with one of them}} being headstarting. Headstarting is when reptile eggs are collected by managers, hatched in captivity, and hatchlings are raised for a certain time before being released into their native habitat. <b>Blanding’s</b> <b>Turtles</b> (Emydoidea blandingii) are a state species of special concern in Michigan, where this study takes place. Headstarted <b>Blanding’s</b> <b>Turtles</b> were raised for one and a half years and should benefit from being released in a suitable microhabitat within a wetland. This study’s aim was to investigate the success of varying release locations and the headstart program by measuring thermoregulation patterns, survival, and movements of juvenile headstarted <b>Blanding’s</b> <b>Turtles.</b> During June 2014, twenty-four <b>Blanding’s</b> <b>Turtles</b> were released and tracked for eighteen months using radio telemetry to measure survival and to look at the movements among microhabitats; water and carapace temperature data were used to measure thermoregulation patterns. The headstarted juvenile <b>Blanding’s</b> <b>Turtles</b> had an average carapace temperature lower than adults from previous studies and used basking as a thermoregulatory behavior. To evaluate factors that may potentially affect survival of <b>Blanding’s</b> <b>Turtles</b> microhabitat factors at turtle relocation points within Shiawassee National Wildlife Refuge, Saginaw, MI, USA were recorded, including water depth, vegetation type and dominance, substrate depth, and air and water temperature. GIS and ground truth data were used to investigate microhabitat factors and map turtle locations. All of the headstarted <b>Blanding’s</b> <b>Turtles</b> survived overwintering through spring 2015. Turtles were released in four different locations with different microhabitats. Minimum convex polygon home ranges and movement patterns were analyzed to see if differences occurred across release groups and age classes. Significant differences were found between turtle home range size per release group. Comparisons to studies on wild-hatched <b>Blanding’s</b> <b>Turtles</b> were made and showed that these headstarted <b>Blanding’s</b> <b>Turtles</b> behaved similar to their wild-hatched counterparts when comparing behaviors at relocations and home range sizes. Use versus availability showed that the juvenile headstarted <b>Blanding’s</b> <b>Turtles</b> avoided open water, willows, and lowland forest while preferring muskrat dens and cattails. Geographically weighted regression modeling predicted that these turtles would move towards preferred habitats and away from release sites with avoided non-preferred habitats. This research identified an estimated survival of between 63 and 96 % over the eighteen month study period with all <b>Blanding’s</b> <b>Turtles</b> surviving their first winter in the refuge. This research suggests that headstarting programs for <b>Blanding’s</b> <b>Turtles</b> should release the species in preferred habitats of dense cattails with plenty of muskrat dens for basking and refuge, if available...|$|R

40|$|Mapping {{suitable}} {{habitat for}} a species at risk {{is one of}} the first steps in a conservation plan. Creating habitat suitability maps can be very challenging when the area of interest is large and located in remote areas where field excursions can be difficult to implement. Such is the case for the <b>Blanding’s</b> <b>turtle,</b> a threatened species in Ontario, that live on the Georgian Bay archipelago. With increasing anthropogenic pressures, maps indicating suitable habitat can aid management decisions and prioritize areas for protection. We apply an interdisciplinary approach using traditional field data and generalized linear models to produce high resolution, regional maps which identify suitable habitat for <b>Blanding’s</b> <b>turtles</b> throughout the archipelago. We assessed the accuracy of our models using an independent survey dataset of 16 island sites distributed throughout the archipelago, and evaluated models using a reference island as a threshold for determining suitability of survey sites. Islands with higher proportions of wetlands and vernal pools were generally considered to be suitable for <b>Blanding’s</b> <b>turtles</b> compared to those with lower proportions. Our findings highlight the importance of both permanent and temporary wet habitats for <b>Blanding’s</b> <b>turtles.</b> Based on our final model, approximately 64 % of evaluated islands support habitat for <b>Blanding’s</b> <b>turtles.</b> Our study is the first to produce detailed habitat suitability maps for <b>Blanding’s</b> <b>turtles</b> on the Georgian Bay archipelago.

40|$|As {{habitat loss}} and {{fragmentation}} are major causes of decline in animal species, studying habitat requirements in these species {{is a key}} component of their recovery. I investigated the relationship between landscape composition and habitat use of <b>Blanding’s</b> <b>turtles,</b> Emydoidea blandingii, a freshwater turtle threatened by habitat loss and road mortality on most of its Canadian range. In 2010, I conducted a radio-telemetry survey of 44 <b>Blanding’s</b> <b>turtles</b> in southern Québec, Canada, and modelled their home range size from land cover proportions measured at many spatial scales. I also used data from a visual survey conducted in 2008 and 2009 to model wetland occupancy of the species at the landscape scale. Home range size of the <b>Blanding’s</b> <b>turtle</b> was significantly correlated to landscape composition, and the proportions of agriculture, open water and anthropogenic lands had the strongest relationships with home range size. However, those relationships were weak and the models were unable to predict home range size accurately. At the landscape scale, land cover and road density poorly predicted probability of occurrence, and <b>Blanding’s</b> <b>turtles</b> occupied wetlands in both disturbed and natural sites. Management of the species should focus on protecting sites of occurrence with high wetland density, low road density, and sufficient suitable habitat to cover their seasonal movement patterns...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We studied <b>Blanding’s</b> <b>turtle</b> (Emydoidea blandingii) {{home range}} and {{seasonal}} movement patterns at 10 sites in suburban eastern Massachusetts during 2001 and 2002.

There were significant differences in home range length between activity periods, with longest movements occurring during the period of 15 April to 31 May as animals moved to ephemeral wetlands. Mean annual home range size for <b>Blanding’s</b> <b>turtles</b> was 22 ha, and mean home range length was 856 m.

40|$|The {{development}} and implementation of effective species and population-specific management strategies requires population-specific information. To demonstrate the relative extirpation risk associated with various road mortality scenarios for a population of <b>Blanding’s</b> <b>turtles</b> at Canadian Nuclear Laboratories in Chalk River, Ontario, a Population Viability Analysis was conducted. Road mortality of two adult females every ten years resulted in population extirpation within 200 years relative to a stable population not experiencing road mortality. To accommodate informed decision-making for the management of this species at risk, the movement patterns and habitat selection of this <b>Blanding’s</b> <b>turtle</b> population were described. There {{was no significant difference between}} males and females in distance moved between relocations in either the spring or the summer, but turtles moved greater distances in the spring than in the summer. Annual and seasonal home range size did not differ between the sexes or between spring and summer periods. A compositional analysis indicated <b>Blanding’s</b> <b>turtles</b> preferred marsh habitats over bog, swamp, lake, and upland. Matched-paired logistic regression was used to determine selection of microhabitat features, such as type of vegetation, in the spring and summer. Turtles preferred sites with warmer air temperatures, shallower water, a higher availability of open water, and greater coverage of emergent and floating vegetation types in the spring period. In the summer period, turtles preferred sites characterized by cooler, deeper water, a higher availability of open water, and greater coverage of emergent and floating vegetation types. This population of <b>Blanding’s</b> <b>turtles</b> appears to be relatively small and the continued threat of road mortality indicates a delicate situation for its persistence. Considering seasonally preferred habitats will best inform management decisions for seasonal work restrictions and future development plans...|$|R

The carapace is speckled with numerous yellow or light-colored flecks or streaks on a dark background. The plastron, or lower shell, is yellow with dark blotches symmetrically arranged. The head and legs are dark, and usually speckled or mottled with yellow. <b>Blanding's</b> <b>turtle</b> is also called the [...] "semi-box" [...] turtle, for although the plastron is hinged, the plastral lobes do not shut as tight as the box turtle's.|$|R
40|$|Studies in road ecology are {{becoming}} increasingly important {{to determine the effects}} of roads on ecological processes and on wildlife populations. The fragmentation of natural landscapes by linear anthropogenic features has several negative consequences, such as decreasing connectivity between habitats, inhibiting animal movement, and isolating populations. The barrier effect limits animal movement through behavioural avoidance and mortality during crossing attempts. I investigated the impact of road networks on the movement patterns of <b>Blanding’s</b> <b>turtles</b> (Emydoidae blandingii) from 6 wetland sites in Ontario and Québec, Canada. A total of 63 <b>Blanding’s</b> <b>turtles</b> (30 females, 27 males, and 6 juveniles) were monitored via radio-telemetry during their active season from April-September 2010 and 2011. Road avoidance was quantified, for each individual, by comparing the number of observed crossings with the number of expected road crossings predicted by 1000 movement path randomizations. The results of this study demonstrated that the <b>Blanding’s</b> <b>turtle</b> population in Québec significantly avoids crossing roads, but the Ontario population does not. Roads were a significant barrier to movement of 7 of the 63 turtles and the barrier effect was not influenced by neither sex nor road surface. Preserving demographic and genetic connectivity of animal populations separated by roads is a major conservation challenge for species at risk such as the Blanding`s turtle. ...|$|R
