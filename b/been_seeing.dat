5|$|Several {{days after}} the October meeting, JG50 was disbanded and its {{personnel}} absorbed into I./Jagdgeschwader 301, a Wilde Sau night-fighter unit. While operational, JG 50 had claimed 45 Allied four-engined bombers. Graf was promoted to Oberst (Colonel) and on 11 November, appointed Geschwaderkommodore (Wing Commander) of JG11, when Mader was transferred to JG54 in the Leningrad sector. Aside from Grislawski, who was kept on as Staka (the squadron commander) of 1./ JG1, he managed to take his soccer players and friends with him. Sunday 20 February marked the start of ”Big Week” – six consecutive days of concentrated bombing by the USAAF designed to overwhelm the German defences. JG11 was heavily involved and Graf shot down a B-24 Liberator for his 208th victory on the 24 February. His 209th aerial victory, west of Berlin on 6 March, was over another B-24 Liberator, of the 453d Bombardment Group. It was actually an Herausschuss (separation shot) – a severely damaged heavy bomber forced to separate from its combat box and which the Luftwaffe counted as an aerial victory. On 29 March, Graf shot down two P-51 Mustangs that were making a fighter sweep ahead of their bomber stream. Chased and harried {{by the rest of}} their squadron, he tried to ram another before bailing out. Landing heavily, he broke both knees and fractured his arm. These would prove to be his final air victories. Prompt attention from the JG11 medic saved Graf from losing his arm. From April to early July he spent time recovering in a hospital in his home-town of Engen. On June 24, he married Jobst, whom he had <b>been</b> <b>seeing</b> over the past year.|$|E
