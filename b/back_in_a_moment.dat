25|$|Fanta and Pain's mother, an {{extremely}} powerful faerie {{even after a}} liaison with a human man and the previous Faerie of Affinity. Oran was originally a candidate to be Queen of Avalon, but a jealous rival named Seraphina tricked her {{when the two of}} them went to earth to bathe. Oran was left on earth with a torn gown and married a human man after she was raped and lost her memory. Though having three children would have trapped her on earth forever, Oran got her gown <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> of desperation to stop Sindo (in Sino's body) from being killed by Sino (in Sindo's body).|$|E
60|$|He came <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> to {{say that}} Barker was in the garden.|$|E
60|$|LADY CHILTERN. I will be <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> I am {{only going}} to take my hat off.|$|E
60|$|Ruth {{laid down}} her knitting-work, and was <b>in</b> the <b>back</b> porch <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b>|$|R
60|$|He came <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> few <b>moments</b> so much amazed, {{that she}} could see the whites all round his eyes.|$|R
60|$|He {{glanced at}} the Captain, who nodded <b>back.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> few <b>moments</b> the Doctor reappeared. He leaned down and whispered to the Captain.|$|R
60|$|At {{these words}} the whole {{audience}} burst into riotous applause, during which Loring disappeared, {{but he was}} <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b>|$|E
60|$|Cass melted. He moved. Miss Porter put {{her head}} out of the window and drew it <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> dry-eyed.|$|E
6000|$|I confounded Brett's man, {{and told}} the boy to bid him call again. Young Larkins came {{grinning}} <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> and said: ...|$|E
60|$|As {{soon as he}} {{had brought}} home the post-bag, he dashed across the road again, but came <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> few <b>moments,</b> looking beside himself.|$|R
60|$|She hurried away, {{and came}} <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> few <b>moments,</b> having evidently dried some tears, perhaps of thankfulness, but she paused as if {{reluctant}} to begin.|$|R
60|$|Ellison came hurrying <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> few <b>moments</b> {{and looked}} in vain for his companion. As he stood there {{watching}} the throng of people, Berenice called him to her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come!" [...] cried Carthoris. [...] "There {{is no time}} to be lost. Astok will be <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> {{with enough}} warriors to {{overpower}} me." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. McWilliams sped to {{the nursery}} {{to see how things}} were going on there. She was <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> with a new dread. She said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I will be <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> good mother,' said he. And {{three minutes}} later he placed a purse full of sequins in the old woman's hand.|$|E
60|$|Elsie drew <b>back,</b> all abashed. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> {{her cheek}} grew still redder, I felt sure, than my own.|$|R
6000|$|But he was <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> few <b>moments,</b> having {{discarded}} his broom {{and provided}} himself, from some mysterious source, with an exquisite bouquet of flowers. [...] "Buy a posy, buy a posy! Only a 'ap'ny!" [...] he chanted, with the melancholy drawl {{of a professional}} beggar.|$|R
60|$|I was <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> few <b>moments,</b> {{and there}} stood my Charon {{fluttering}} {{in the cool}} air. One good push sent us to the islet I made haste to undress, for {{he was ready for}} the water, Trip dancing round, barking with excitement at his new appearance.|$|R
60|$|LIZA [forcing {{a little}} smile for him through her vexation] Oh well, just to show there's no ill feeling. I'll be <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> [She goes out].|$|E
6000|$|... "It's your cousin, miss, {{from the}} country, {{and she has}} a trunk with her. Of course she's to come in?" [...] asked Maria, coming <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "They will be <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> It {{is absurd}} to doubt either of them, Ducaine. Yet I shall keep silent. I have an idea. Agree to {{everything}} I say." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am the Comtesse de Vestignes," [...] Rachael said slowly, [...] "and Bertrand Saton is my adopted son. He will be <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> few <b>moments.</b> Draw {{your chair}} {{up close to}} me. I should like to talk, {{if you do not}} mind this light. I have been resting, and my eyes are tired." ...|$|R
6000|$|All my tigerish blood flashed up <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> I {{picked up}} a billet of wood from beside the fireplace. [...] "Go," [...] I said, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> low voice, [...] "go quick, or I may do you an injury." [...] He looked at me irresolutely for <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> and then he left the house. He came <b>back</b> again <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> however, {{and stood in the}} doorway looking in at us.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{must allow}} me the honour of taking you home, madam; I {{will tell you}} who I am," [...] Basil Ransom said, <b>in</b> {{obedience}} to <b>a</b> rapid reflexion. He helped her into the car, the conductor pressed a fraternal hand upon her <b>back,</b> and <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> {{the young man was}} seated beside her, and the jingling had recommenced. At that hour of the day the car was almost empty, and they had it virtually to themselves.|$|R
60|$|The injured gondoliers {{spoke in}} low tones together; {{then one of}} them shrugged his {{shoulders}} and went out. He came <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> and laid a rope before the commissary.|$|E
60|$|At {{those last}} words, Mr. Bashwood {{suddenly}} rallied. The lawyer's passing {{reference to the}} great house had led him <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> to the purpose that he had in view.|$|E
6000|$|GLORIA (annoyed). Mother will be <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> Phil. (Severely.) Please {{wait here}} for her. (She turns {{away to the}} window, where she stands looking out {{with her back to}} them.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... {{they would}} be so much pleased that they would make his <b>back</b> {{straight}} again <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> At least, perhaps Wednesday and Thursday would not do, because the little tailor taught them those; but Friday makes them angry. But suppose he made some nice verse - ...|$|R
60|$|The man {{pushed open}} the trap-door and disappeared. He came <b>back</b> again <b>in</b> <b>a</b> few <b>moments,</b> with <b>a</b> bottle <b>in</b> one hand and <b>a</b> glass <b>in</b> the other. Fischer poured {{out some of the}} cordial and drew a small table up to Graham's side.|$|R
60|$|She came <b>back</b> again <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> with <b>a</b> tray {{on which}} were a cottage loaf, {{a slab of}} butter, and a jar of {{strawberry}} jam. While she placed the things on the table her father chaffed her. He said it was quite time she was walking out; he told Philip {{that she was very}} proud, and would {{have nothing to do with}} aspirants to that honour who lined up at the door, two by two, outside the Sunday school and craved the honour of escorting her home.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{shall have}} it then. Ring for our boots {{and tell them}} to order a cab. I'll be <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> when I have changed my dressing-gown and filled my cigar-case." ...|$|E
60|$|LORD ILLINGWORTH. With the {{greatest}} pleasure. [To MRS. ALLONBY.] I'll be <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> People's mothers always bore me to death. All women become like their mothers. That is their tragedy.|$|E
6000|$|... "An enchanted prince or princess," [...] said Prigio, [...] "such as I {{have often}} read of. Who can it be? Not Jaqueline; she could change herself <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> By the way, where is Jaqueline?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I drove {{straight}} to the milliner's shop, which I had observed, when I was there yesterday, had a back entrance into a mews, for the apprentices {{to go in and}} out by. I went in at once, leaving the cab waiting for me at the door. 'A man is following me,' I said, 'and I {{want to get rid of}} him. Here is my cab fare; wait ten minutes before you give it to the driver, and let me out at once by the <b>back</b> way!' <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> I was out in the mews; in another, I was in the next street; <b>in</b> <b>a</b> third, I hailed a passing omnibus, and was a free woman again.|$|R
6000|$|The lane {{was long}} and unvaried, and, owing to the rapid {{shortening}} of the days, dusk came upon her before she was aware. She had {{reached the top of}} a hill down which the lane stretched its serpentine length in glimpses, when she heard footsteps behind her <b>back,</b> and <b>in</b> <b>a</b> few <b>moments</b> she was overtaken by a man. He stepped up alongside Tess and said-- ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Lapham laughed, {{reddening}} consciously, {{and said}} she guessed the Colonel knew {{how to take care}} of himself. This struck Lapham, then draining his glass of sauterne, as wonderfully discreet in his wife. Bromfield Corey leaned <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his chair <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> [...] "Well, after all, you can't say, with all your modern fuss about it, that you do much better now than the old fellows who built such houses as this." ...|$|R
