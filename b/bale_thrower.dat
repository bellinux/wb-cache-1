40|$|This Alert {{described}} five {{cases in}} which persons were scalped when their hair became entangled around inadequately guarded rotating drivelines or shafts of farm equipment driven by power take offs. Four cases involved women who were baling hay. In the fifth case, a 12 year old girl was asked by her father to check the bale counter. All five of the incidents involved inadequately guarded drivelines and victims who were standing or walking near rotating drivelines. The drivelines involved were guarded by inverted U-shaped tunnel guards that did not completely enclose the drivelines. The drivelines were located about 4 feet above the ground, limiting visibility of the hazard. The drivelines concerned were associated with Models 54 A, 54 B, 58, and 62 of a <b>bale</b> <b>thrower</b> manufactured by New Holland prior to 1976. A retrofit safety shield kit has been available since 1976 for these older models. To prevent accidents, the power take off should be disengaged and the tractor turned off before leaving the tractor seat or approaching a driveline. Power take off driven machinery should be examined for U-shaped tunnel guards; all such guards should be replace with retrofit guards. Prevention and ControlOccupational Healt...|$|E
50|$|Eventually, as tractor {{horsepower}} increased, the thrower-baler became possible, which {{eliminated the}} need for someone {{to stand on the}} wagon and pick up the finished <b>bales.</b> The first <b>thrower</b> mechanism used two fast-moving friction belts to grab finished bales and throw them at an angle up in the air onto the bale wagon. The bale wagon was modified from a flatbed into a three-sided skeleton frame open at the front, to act as a catcher's net for the thrown bales.|$|R
