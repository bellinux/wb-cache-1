5|$|In 2010, Alcocer and Martinez {{described}} a new taxon of herrerasaurid, Sanjuansaurus. It could {{be distinguished from}} Herrerasaurus based on multiple features. In the phylogenetic analysis, Herrerasaurus, Sanjuansaurus and Staurikosaurus all were in a polytomy, and Herrerasauridae was the most primitive group of saurischian, outside Eusaurischia, Eoraptor and Guaibasaurus. In 2011, Martinez et al. described Eodromaeus, a basal theropod from the same formation as Herrerasaurus. In a phylogenetic analysis, Eoraptor was placed within Sauropodomorpha, Herrerasauridae was placed as the most basal theropods, and Eodromaeus was placed as the next most basal. A more recent analysis, by Bittencourt et al. (2014), placed Herrerasauridae in a polytomy with Theropoda and Sauropodomorpha, with Eoraptor also <b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> unresolved position. This cladogram is shown below.|$|E
5|$|On September 13, despite <b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> {{extremely}} {{hostile environment}} with very high wind shear, convection redeveloped {{near the center}} of Fred, and regeneration into a tropical cyclone was seen as a possibility. Two days later, the NHC noted that environmental conditions could become marginally favorable for redevelopment of the system. On September16, the circulation of Fred became less defined and only intermittent convection persisted around the system. By September17, the remnant circulation became increasingly disorganized and the system dissipated later that day without regenerating into a tropical cyclone. However, several hours later, a new area of low pressure formed in association with the remnants of Fred roughly 525mi (845km) south of Bermuda. The remnant low finally dissipated on September19, roughly 520mi (835km) southwest of Bermuda.|$|E
5|$|Late on January 1, 2009, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) {{reported}} that {{an area of}} deep atmospheric convection had persisted for the last 48hours about 730km (455mi), to the southeast of Manila in the Philippines. Deep convection was developing over the northern quadrant of a weak low level circulation center. A subtropical ridge of pressure was helping to guide the disturbance and was providing good outflow as well as low to moderate vertical wind shear. However, as the disturbance was moving into {{a higher level of}} vertical wind shear the depression was not expected to develop into a significant tropical cyclone within 48 hours. During the next 48 hours the disturbance gradually developed, with the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) and the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) reporting early on January 3 that it had become the first tropical depression of the season, with the name Auring being assigned to the depression by PAGASA whilst it was located about 140km (85mi) east of Surigao City on the Philippine island of Mindanao. This came after the low level circulation center had started to consolidate as deep convection was being fueled by a poleward diffluence despite <b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> area of strong vertical wind shear. Over {{the next couple of days}} as Auring moved towards the east, dry air started to wrap in to its low level circulation center which started to weaken the depression after it had peaked with winds of 45km/h, (30mph) 10-min sustained and a peak pressure of 1006 hPa/Mbar. As the baroclinic zone approached the depression late on January 5, PAGASA downgraded the depression to an area of low pressure as the baroclinic zone was approaching the depression, as vertical wind shear had increased and outflow became hindered. However the JMA continued to issue warnings on the depression until early the next morning when the depression was declared dissipated by the JTWC and the JMA.|$|E

40|$|Romantic relationship, a {{widespread}} feature of human society, {{is one of}} the most influential factors in daily life. Although stimuli related to romantic love or <b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> romantic relationship commonly result in enhancement of activation or functional connectivity of the reward system, including the striatum, the structure underlying romantic relationship-related regions remain unclear. Because individual experiences can alter gray matter within the adult human brain, we hypothesized that romantic relationship is associated with structural differences in the striatum related to the positive subjective experience of <b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> romantic relationship. Because intimate romantic relationships contribute to perceived subjective happiness, this subjective enhancement of happiness might be accompanied by the experience of positive events related to <b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> romantic relationship. To test this hypothesis and elucidate the structure involved, we compared subjective happiness, an indirect measure of the existence of positive experiences caused by <b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> romantic relationship, of participants with or without romantic partners (N = 68). Furthermore, we also conducted a voxel-based morphometry (VBM) study of the effects of <b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> romantic relationship (N = 113). Being <b>in</b> <b>a</b> romantic relationship was associated with greater subjective happiness and reduced gray matter density within the right dorsal striatum. These results suggest that <b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> romantic relationship enhances perceived subjective happiness via positive experiences. Furthermore, the observed reduction in gray matter density in the right dorsal striatum may reflect <b>an</b> increase <b>in</b> saliency of social reward within a romantic relationship. Thus, <b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> romantic relationship is associated with positive experiences and a reduction of gray matter density in the right dorsal striatum, representing a modulation of social reward...|$|R

25|$|A {{crash test}} dummy is a {{full-scale}} anthropomorphic test device (ATD) that simulates the dimensions, weight proportions and articulation of the human body, and is usually instrumented to record data about the dynamic behavior of the ATD in simulated vehicle impacts. The Crash Test Dummy is widely used by researchers and automobile companies to predict the biomechanics, force, impact, and injury of a human <b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> automobile crash. This data can include variables such as velocity of impact, crushing force, bending, folding, or torque of the body, and deceleration rates during a collision for use in crash tests. The more advanced dummies are sophisticated machines designed to behave as a human body and with many sensors to record the forces of an impact; they may cost over US$400,000.|$|E
25|$|About {{one third}} of the women {{experienced}} sexual dysfunction, which may lead to women's loss of confidence in their sexual lives. Since these women had sexual problems, their sexual lives with their partners became a burden without pleasure, and eventually, they may completely lose interest in sexual activity. Some of the women found it hard to be aroused mentally; however, some had physical problems. Several factors can affect female dysfunction, such as situations in which women do not trust their sex partners. The environment where sex occurs is crucial, since <b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> extremely public or extremely private place may make some women feel uncomfortable. Inability to concentrate on the sexual activity due to a bad mood or burdens from work may also cause a woman's sexual dysfunction. Other factors include physical discomfort or difficulty in achieving arousal, which could be caused by aging or changes in the body's condition.|$|E
25|$|Classical {{liberalism}} in Britain {{developed from}} Whiggery and radicalism, was also {{heavily influenced by}} French physiocracy and represented a new political ideology. Whiggery had become a dominant ideology following the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and {{was associated with the}} defence of Parliament, upholding {{the rule of law and}} defending landed property. The origins of rights were seen as <b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> ancient constitution, which had existed from time immemorial. These rights, which some Whigs considered to include freedom of the press and freedom of speech, were justified by custom rather than by natural rights. They believed that the power of the executive had to be constrained. While they supported limited suffrage, they saw voting as a privilege rather than as a right. However, there was no consistency in Whig ideology and diverse writers including John Locke, David Hume, Adam Smith and Edmund Burke were all influential among Whigs, although none of them was universally accepted.|$|E

500|$|The storm briefly re-strengthened {{slightly}} on August27, reaching its maximum sustained wind speed of 105mph (165km/h) {{for the second}} time at 1200UTC. Vertical wind shear persisted and Danielle soon began to weaken again. Later on August27, the National Hurricane Center predicted that the storm would travel along the periphery of an anticyclone centered just east of Bermuda, which would keep the storm away from the East Coast of the United States. Despite <b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> apparently favorable environment, Danielle continued to slowly weaken, as the forecast for decreasing wind shear did not initially materialize. Additionally, upwelling from Hurricane Bonnie roughly a week earlier contributed to a decrease in strength. Although the storm weakened further, reconnaissance aircraft observations on August29 concluded that the structure of Danielle had improved compared to the previous day. By early on August30, Danielle had weakened {{to the extent that it}} was only a minimal hurricane, with maximum winds of 75mph (120km/h) at the time. On August30, the National Hurricane Center noted that Danielle would soon leave the upwelling track left by Bonnie, and likely lead to intensification. Thus, the possibility of re-strengthening increased, though predictions only showed gradual intensification.|$|E
