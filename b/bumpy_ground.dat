2500|$|The second {{constraint}} of {{the differential}} is passive—it is actuated by the friction kinematics chain through the ground. The difference in torque on the roadwheels and tires (caused by turns or <b>bumpy</b> <b>ground)</b> drives the second degree of freedom, (overcoming the torque of inner friction) to equalise the driving torque on the tires. The {{sensitivity of the}} differential depends on the inner friction through the second degree of freedom. All of the differentials (so called [...] "active" [...] and [...] "passive") use clutches and brakes for restricting the second degree of freedom, so all suffer from the same disadvantage—decreased sensitivity to a dynamically changing environment. The sensitivity of the ECU controlled differential is also limited by the time delay caused by sensors and the response time of the actuators.|$|E

5000|$|Like other Ciani designs, the Spillo {{was built}} by Sezioni Sperimentale di Volo a Vela (SSVV), an {{offshoot}} of the Aeroclub Volovelistio Milanese. It first flew in 1954. In 1958 the wing trailing edge was modified, chiefly by the addition of camber changing plain flaps inboard of the ailerons which added low speed, thermalling lift as well as slowing landing approach speed. They could extend from +5° to −90°. [...] At the same time the aileron span was increased by 11% and the wing area by 3.5%; the weight also increased slightly. In 350 hours of flying the undercarriage had twice been damaged in fast landings onto <b>bumpy</b> <b>ground,</b> so the skid was reinforced.|$|E
2500|$|Leigh's cricketing {{career and}} first class stats might be {{considered}} average {{but he was a}} popular choice as President of the MCC in its first centenary year in 1887 and the Golden Jubilee year of Queen Victoria. At the centenary MCC dinner at the old Tennis Court it was said of him his speech that night rivaled Leighton at the Royal Academy. [...] "I will say that the old cricketer stood up bravely in <b>bumpy</b> <b>grounds</b> in spite of awkward knocks and ugly bruises." [...] Wisden acknowledged him as an excellent [...] "long-stop" [...] who [...] "will let a ball go through him rather than by him" [...] and his style of batting was awkward, but he is a fine hitter forward and to leg. It was said of Leigh in his maturer years by one who had played many matches with him when he was captain of I Zingari teams, that {{if ever there was a}} man to pull a match out of the fire by his management, he was that man. The same principle which he carried out on hunting when he came to a big fence, [...] "throw your heart over and the body will follow" [...] was his rule with the bat – he would not be beat.|$|R
40|$|Understanding how junior athletes {{perceive}} injury risks when {{participating in}} sport and the environment they play in {{is an important component}} of injury prevention. This study investigates how Sri Lankan junior cricketers (n = 365, aged 11 – 14 years, boys) perceive injury risks associated with playing cricket. The study used a Sri Lankan modification of an Australian junior cricket injury risk perception survey that considered playing cricket versus other sports, different cricket playing positions and roles, and different ground conditions. The risk of playing cricket was considered to be greater than that for cycling, but lower than that for rugby and soccer. Fast-bowlers, batters facing fast-bowlers, fielding close in the field, and wicket-keeping without a helmet were perceived to pose greater risks of injury than other scenarios. Playing on hard, <b>bumpy</b> and/or wet <b>ground</b> conditions were perceived to have a high risk opposed to playing on a grass field. Fielding in the outfield and wicket-keeping to fast-bowlers whilst wearing a helmet were perceived as low risk actions. The risk perceptions of junior cricketers identified in this study, do not necessarily reflect the true injury risk in some instances. This information will inform the development of injury prevention education interventions to address these risk perceptions in junior cricketers...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{underline}} any possible risk factors about the pathogenesis of humeral condyle fracture through a retrospective analysis of all 12220 dogs presented to our Section of surgery and emergency care between 1987 and 2003 and a comparison of our data with those reported in literature. In this report HCF had a greater frequency in hunting, adult, male dogs: they represented 44, 90 % of all the dogs with HCF, whereas only 22, 31 % of general population. Non hunting dogs represented 55, 10 % of dogs with HCF and 77, 69 % of the general population. Hunting dogs had a frequency of HCF of 1, 61 %, the others groups of 0, 57 %. The difference between the two groups of attitude was significant. The histological finding in the intercondylar area of amorphous and necrotic material, the absence of chondrocytes or cartilage matrix and the intense captation of 99 mTc-MDP in the affected elbow after scintigrafy were similar to stress fractures. Hunting dogs live in small boxes and during hunting season, after short period of intense training, work hard and repetitively often in <b>bumpy</b> <b>ground.</b> For this reason, because also to the analogy that exist in the etiopathology of stress fractures in other species, we think that hunting might be for dog an important risk factor in the etiology of HCF. Besides, the common finding in hunting dogs of incomplete intercondylar fissure may be the expression of a pre-fracture syndrome that, because of continuing and violent stress transmitted through the radius on to the capitulum, might fall in fatigue fractures...|$|E
