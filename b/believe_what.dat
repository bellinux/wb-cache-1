5|$|It's not my {{responsibility}} to draw (the audience) in, I just {{have to play the}} character. The way I would perform songs was always about the lyrics and always about trying to speak to everybody and make them watch and <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> I'm saying and I suppose I'm essentially doing that here but I'm not looking at the audience I'm obviously looking at the other actors.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} ending {{was to have}} John killed, and {{his image}} kept alive by the resistance by grafting his skin onto Marcus' cybernetic body. Marcus would have then murdered Kate, Barnes, Kyle, and Star. However, after the ending was leaked on the Internet, Warner Bros. decided to completely change the entire third act of the film. McG and Nolan did continue the Christ element of John's character though, {{in which he has}} some followers who <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> he knows about Skynet and others who do not.|$|E
5|$|In May 1944, it was {{announced}} that broadcast performers must organize themselves into a union, and that this union would be the only one permitted to operate in Argentina. Shortly after the union formed, Eva Duarte was elected its president. Fraser and Navarro speculate that Juan Perón made the suggestion that performers create a union, and the other performers likely felt it was good politics to elect his mistress. Shortly after her election as president of the union, Eva Duarte began a daily program called Toward a Better Future, which dramatized in soap opera form the accomplishments of Juan Perón. Often, Perón's own speeches were played during the program. When she spoke, Eva Duarte spoke in ordinary language as a regular woman who wanted listeners to <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> she herself believed about Juan Perón.|$|E
5000|$|The Grammar {{is divided}} into two sections. The first is {{entitled}} [...] "Assent and Apprehension", which deals with <b>believing</b> <b>what</b> one does not understand. The second is entitled [...] "Assent and Inference" [...] and it addresses the issue of <b>believing</b> <b>what</b> cannot be absolutely proven.|$|R

25|$|To {{make matters}} worse the tide began to flow, and the {{soldiers}} who had easily waded across the moat were washed away - 300 were drowned {{in an attempt to}} reach the camp. Parma was horrified and couldn't <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> had happened as he saw the survivors coming back to their entrenchments; he realised that the siege had to be raised.|$|E
25|$|By the 19th century, {{the liberals}} had evolved into Unitarians. Not {{only did they}} deny the {{doctrine}} of the Trinity as unscriptural, they believed the Bible should be interpreted rationally, not in a literal manner. Their preaching focused on ethics rather than on doctrine and did not limit church membership to the converted. Unitarians did not participate in evangelistic societies due to their conviction that people informed by reason and scripture should be free to <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> they wanted. When they did organize, they tended to focus on education and philanthropic causes.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{watching}} {{the tape of}} the beating, LAPD chief of police Daryl Gates said: I stared at the screen in disbelief. I played the one-minute-50-second tape again. Then again and again, until I had viewed it 25 times. And still I could not <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> I was looking at. To see my officers engage {{in what appeared to}} be excessive use of force, possibly criminally excessive, to see them beat a man with their batons 56 times, to see a sergeant on the scene who did nothing to seize control, was something I never dreamed I would witness.|$|E
25|$|If Campese wanted to, I am sure {{he could}} have sprinted for the corner and scored the try. Instead, he ran {{straight}} at Ackerman. The Welshman obviously knew enough about Campese to realise it was useless to try and tackle him front-on. Instead, he did what I suggested earlier that any defender should do against Campese – he ran with him. It was then that Campese began to zigzag, forcing Ackerman to zigzag, too, looking over one shoulder after another to see which way Campese was heading. I was following about 20 metres behind and could not <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> was happening. I {{have no doubt that}} Campese turned it on to make a personal point with Ackerman. When the defence eventually closed in on him, Campese flicked a pass over his shoulder to Michael Hawker, who scored the try.|$|E
25|$|The Carol Ferris {{version of}} Star Sapphire appears in , voiced again by Olivia d'Abo but without her accent this time. Her costume here {{is similar to}} the one {{currently}} worn by the Star Sapphires. She is hired to be part of Vandal Savage's Legion of Doom since she is the counterpart to Green Lantern. Her plan is to break Hal Jordan's will by making him believe he had let a hostage (almost identical to Carol) get killed by a terrorist that he could have easily defeated before harm befell her. As Hal mourns the dead girl, Carol walks up to him and berates him for his failure to save the woman and for hurting Carol, driving her into becoming Star Sapphire. Weeping, Hal takes off his ring, becoming a broken man as he continues to mourn the dead woman. When Batman arrives, he reveals that the woman was an android used by Star Sapphire to trick him, and that she had exposed him to the Scarecrow's fear gas in order to break his will, to which Hal dons his ring and becomes Green Lantern once more. When the Justice League storms the Hall of Doom, she faces off against him again. As they fight, Hal expresses anger over Carol's plan, saying that he couldn't <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> she did, only for her to coldly remark that he broke her heart, and she would never stop trying to kill him for it. She manages to capture him but he escapes and knock her out. Hal proceeds to take away Carol's Star Sapphire gem, reverting her back to normal, and admits that he keeps hurting her. This version is shown to be able to create both energy blasts and hard constructs. She was the only one to use the non-lethal version of Batman's contingency plans and was the last member to be defeated.|$|E

500|$|However, {{a second}} aspect of I Corinthians also enters into the sermon; Swift relies {{on it to}} promote the idea that reason {{can be used to}} {{comprehend}} the world, but [...] "excellency of speech" [...] is false when it comes to knowledge about the divine. To this, Swift said, [...] "we must either <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> God directly commandeth us in Holy Scripture, or we must wholly reject the Scripture, and the Christian Religion which we pretend to confess".|$|E

500|$|The song's success {{stunned the}} group. Guitarist Tom DeLonge, who noted {{that many of}} the band's songs were based on real events, found it unusual that a song that was not {{directly}} autobiographical wound up connecting best with the wide audience.

[...] Jones finished second with a time of 2:22.05. After the race, Soni said, [...] "It's been a long road to get here, I can't <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> just happened." [...] Soni then combined with Natalie Coughlin, Christine Magnuson, and Dara Torres in the 4×100-meter medley relay to finish second behind Australia. [...] Soni had the second best split time in the field (1:05.95) behind Jones (1:04.58).|$|E
500|$|Carter {{called the}} {{decision}} to cast O'Quinn [...] "a no-brainer"; the actor was cast without a full audition after Carter was impressed by a previous appearance on The X-Files. He summed up Watts' demeanour as [...] "dry, articulate and matter-of-fact". Watts' character {{has been described as}} a counterpoint to Black; series writer Ken Horton described them as [...] "two friends who both <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> they believe and would love to convert the other to his way of thinking". O'Quinn described his time on the series as [...] "rewarding", noting that his character often provided narrative exposition because Henriksen dislikes expository dialogue. His performance was described as [...] "a fine job" [...] and as having [...] "always been good". However, Watts' depth of personality and inconsistent motivation (particularly in the third season) have been criticized.|$|E

Gordon Sullivan of DVD Verdict thought that the film is ambitious and offers [...] "interesting insights into the modern consumption of horror." [...] Joe Leydon of Variety described the film as an [...] "uncomfortably close look at underground horror", and speculated that it may gain a cult following. David Harley of Bloody Disgusting called S a [...] "must-watch" [...] for anyone that has been scared while watching a horror film {{without being able to}} describe why. In response to the film, Richard Corliss of Time questioned whether we can always <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> we see.|$|E
