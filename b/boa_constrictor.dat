5|$|Andean {{cocks-of-the-rock}} face {{slightly larger}} predators than smaller songbirds. Predators {{are attracted to}} leks by the conspicuous behavior of the displaying males. The animals reported to prey on adult cocks-of-the-rock including hawk-eagles, hawks, forest-falcons, jaguar, mountain lion, ocelot and the <b>boa</b> <b>constrictor.</b>|$|E
5|$|The main predators of the Guianan cock-of-the-rock are harpy eagles, {{black-and-white}} hawk-eagles, black hawk-eagles, and slaty-backed forest falcons. Although {{these are}} the main predators, two species of owls, crested owls and spectacled owls, are also predators. Felines such as the jaguar, puma, and ocelot can also be predators, along with snakes such as the bird snake, tree boas, <b>boa</b> <b>constrictor,</b> tiger rat snake, and fer-de-lance.|$|E
5|$|Cuvier's dwarf caiman is {{considered}} to be a keystone species whose presence in the ecosystem maintains a healthy balance of organisms. In its absence, fish, such as piranhas, might dominate the environment. The eggs and newly hatched young of Cuvier's dwarf caiman are most at risk and are preyed on by birds, snakes, rats, raccoons and other mammals. Adult caimans are protected by the bony osteoderms under the scales and their main predators are jaguars, green anacondas (Eunectes murinus) and large boa constrictors (<b>Boa</b> <b>constrictor).</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Boa</b> <b>constrictors</b> {{are very}} popular within the exotic pet trade, {{and have been}} both {{captured}} in the wild and bred in captivity. Today, most captive <b>boa</b> <b>constrictors</b> are captive-bred, but between 1977 and 1983, 113,000 live <b>boa</b> <b>constrictors</b> were imported into the United States. These huge numbers of wild-caught snakes have put considerable pressure on some wild populations. <b>Boa</b> <b>constrictors</b> have also been harvested for their meat and skins, and are a common sight at markets within their geographic range. After the reticulated python, <b>boa</b> <b>constrictors</b> are the snake most commonly killed for snakeskin products, such as shoes, bags, and other items of clothing. In some areas, they {{have an important role}} in regulating the opossum populations, preventing the potential transmission of leishmaniasis to humans. In other areas, they are often let loose within the communities to control the rodent populations.|$|R

5|$|The feud between Bad News Brown and Jake Roberts {{began when}} Roberts sent Brown a {{birthday}} present on the April 22 episode of Wrestling Challenge. Upon opening the package, Brown found a rubber snake; {{it was revealed that}} Brown was afraid of snakes. On the May 5 episode of WWF Superstars, the two men agreed to a match; Brown later claimed that his fear of snakes was cured, although he was quickly proven wrong. On the July 28 episode of WWF Superstars, it was announced that Brown and Roberts face each other at SummerSlam with the Big Boss Man as a special referee. Brown also announced that he would bring 200 pounds of Harlem sewer rats to counteract Roberts's <b>boa</b> <b>constrictor,</b> Damien.|$|E
5|$|During the {{following}} match, a covered cage sat at ringside, supposedly containing 200 pounds of Harlem sewer rats, although {{the contents of}} the cage were not revealed. Bad News Brown controlled most of the early stages of his match against Jake Roberts. Roberts attempted to perform the DDT twice, including once when Brown was arguing with special referee Big Bossman, but Brown blocked the move both times. Outside the ring, Brown hit Roberts with a chair while the Big Bossman was not looking. Roberts gained the advantage by punching Brown repeatedly but was kicked to the outside after Brown reversed a DDT attempt into a back bodydrop. Brown hit Roberts with a chair again but was disqualified when the Bossman saw him. Brown tried to gain revenge after the match by attacking Roberts's <b>boa</b> <b>constrictor,</b> Damien, but the Bossman attacked Brown to save the snake.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduced}} snake <b>Boa</b> <b>constrictor</b> preys on O.couesi on Cozumel. Parasites {{recorded on}} O.couesi in Veracruz include unidentified ticks, mites, fleas, and fly larvae. The flea Polygenis odiosus {{was found on}} an Oryzomys couesi from Cozumel. Out of ten O.couesi in San Luis Potosí, five each were infected by the nematode worms Hassalstrongylus musculi and H.bocqueti, with about 25 worms per rat, and two were infected by one or two cestodes of the genus Raillietina. The mites Eubrachylaelaps circularis and Gigantolaelaps boneti have been found on Oryzomys couesi in Oaxaca, the sucking louse Hoplopleura oryzomydis in Nicaragua, the mites Laelaps oryzomydis, Echinonyssus microchelae, Ornithonyssus bacoti, Prolistrophorus frontalis, and Prolistrophorus bakeri in Colima, and the apicomplexan Eimeria couesii in Mexico. The species is infected by two hantaviruses—Catacamas virus in Honduras and Playa de Oro virus in western Mexico—which {{are related to the}} Bayou virus infecting the marsh rice rat, a common cause of hantavirus infections in the United States. No hantavirus infections in humans have been linked to O.couesi hantaviruses, however. Chiapas O.couesi easily survive experimental infection with several arboviruses, including the Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, suggesting that the species may serve as a reservoir for that virus.|$|E

25|$|<b>Boa</b> <b>constrictors</b> {{can sense}} heat via cells in their lips, though {{they lack the}} labial pits {{surrounding}} these receptors seen in {{many members of the}} Boidae family. <b>Boa</b> <b>constrictors</b> also have two lungs, a smaller (nonfunctional) left and an enlarged (functional) right lung to better fit their elongated shape, unlike many colubrid snakes, which have completely lost the left lung.|$|R
25|$|The <b>boa</b> <b>constrictor</b> (<b>Boa</b> <b>constrictor),</b> {{also called}} the red-tailed boa or the common boa, is a species of large, {{heavy-bodied}} snake that is frequently kept and bred in captivity. The <b>boa</b> <b>constrictor</b> {{is a member of}} the family Boidae, found in tropical North, Central, and South America, as well as some islands in the Caribbean. A staple of private collections and public displays, its color pattern is highly variable yet distinctive. Ten subspecies are currently recognized, although some of these are controversial. This article focuses on the species <b>Boa</b> <b>constrictor</b> as a whole, and on the nominate subspecies B. c. constrictor.|$|E

25|$|Scheele sourced {{uric acid}} from human calculi (such as kidney stones) {{and called the}} {{compound}} lithic acid. William Prout investigated the compound in 1818 and he used <b>boa</b> <b>constrictor</b> excrement with up to 90% ammonium acid urate.|$|E
25|$|<b>Boa</b> <b>constrictors</b> {{generally}} live {{on their}} own, {{and do not}} interact with any other snakes unless they want to mate. They are nocturnal, but they may bask during the day when night-time temperatures are too low. As semi-arboreal snakes, young <b>boa</b> <b>constrictors</b> may climb into trees and shrubs to forage; however, they become mostly terrestrial as they become older and heavier. <b>Boa</b> <b>constrictors</b> strike when they perceive a threat. Their bite can be painful, especially from large snakes, but is rarely dangerous to humans. Specimens from Central America are more irascible, hissing loudly and striking repeatedly when disturbed, while those from South America tame down more readily. Like all snakes, <b>boa</b> <b>constrictors</b> in a shed cycle are more unpredictable, because the substance that lubricates between the old skin and the new makes their eyes appear milky, blue, or opaque, so that the snake cannot see very well, causing it to be more defensive than it might be otherwise.|$|R
50|$|Both the nonvenomous <b>boa</b> <b>constrictors</b> {{and much}} of the {{colubrid}} species primarily kill their prey via constriction, grabbing their prey within their jaws before throwing coils of their muscular bodies around the prey item and squeezing a great amount of pressure, killing their prey by asphyxiation and ruptured blood capillaries. <b>Boa</b> <b>constrictors</b> are ambush hunters, while colubrids will vary between being either active hunters or ambush hunters.|$|R
25|$|All <b>boa</b> <b>constrictors</b> {{fall under}} CITES and are listed under CITES Appendix II, except B.c.occidentalis, which {{is listed in}} CITES Appendix I.|$|R
25|$|Ten {{subspecies}} of <b>Boa</b> <b>constrictor</b> are described, {{but many}} of these are poorly differentiated and further research may redefine many of them. Some appear to be based more on location than biological differences, such as B. c. orophias (the St. Lucia boa).|$|E
25|$|In some regions, <b>boa</b> <b>constrictor</b> {{numbers have}} been {{severely}} hit by predation from humans and other animals, and over collection for the exotic and snakeskin trades. Most populations, though, are not under threat of immediate extinction, thus they are within Appendix II rather than Appendix I.|$|E
25|$|This species {{does well}} in captivity, usually {{becoming}} quite tame. It {{is a common}} sight in both zoos and private reptile collections. Though still exported from their native South America in significant numbers, they are widely bred in captivity. When kept in captivity, they are fed mice, rats, rabbits, chickens, and chicks {{depending on the size}} and age of the individual. Captive life expectancy is 20 to 30 years, with rare accounts over 40 years, making them a long-term commitment as a pet. The greatest reliable age recorded for a <b>boa</b> <b>constrictor</b> in captivity is 40 years 3 months and 14 days. This <b>boa</b> <b>constrictor</b> was named Popeye and died in Philadelphia Zoo, Pennsylvania, on April 15, 1977. Proper animal husbandry is the most significant factor in captive lifespan; this includes providing adequate space, correct temperatures and humidity, and suitable food items.|$|E

25|$|Some reptile species use a ZW {{chromosome}} system, {{which produces}} either males (ZZ) or females (ZW). Until 2010, {{it was thought}} that the ZW chromosome system used by reptiles was incapable of producing viable WW offspring, but a (ZW) female <b>boa</b> <b>constrictor</b> was discovered to have produced viable female offspring with WW chromosomes.|$|E
25|$|Executing a warrant, a team {{formed by}} the Cook County sheriff's police special {{operations}} unit, Cook County animal control, and the South Holland Police Department entered the property and the soundproofed barn, seizing the dogs and evidence.

25|$|Some {{species of}} snake are {{ovoviviparous}} and retain the eggs within their bodies {{until they are}} almost ready to hatch. Recently, it has been confirmed that several species of snake are fully viviparous, such as the <b>boa</b> <b>constrictor</b> and green anaconda, nourishing their young through a placenta {{as well as a}} yolk sac, which is highly unusual among reptiles, or anything else outside of requiem sharks or placental mammals. Retention of eggs and live birth are most often associated with colder environments.|$|E

25|$|The main plaza has a 1950s era kiosk and {{contains}} two small stores in its base selling regional candies. The upper portion has a jukebox. The plaza also contains monuments to Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla and Benito Juárez {{as well as}} a ring from a Mesoamerican ball court of the 13th century. The pavement of the plaza was replaced in 1999 from paving stone to patterned concrete. In 2003, a hemicycle dedicated to Benito Juárez was added. While it {{is considered to be a}} park, the plaza is often filled with stands on market days and during festivals, but most cultural events take place at the esplanade of the municipal palace. The green areas of the plaza contain sculptures of lions made of iron, but unlike real lions, these are shown with nopal plants, with a <b>boa</b> <b>constrictor</b> and other poses and were donated by the former owners of the Hacienda of Chapingo. For this reason the plaza is also called the Jardin de Leones (Lion Garden).|$|E
25|$|The name swamp adder is an invented one, and the {{scientific}} treatises of Doyle's time do not mention any kind of adder of India. To fans of Sherlock Holmes who enjoy treating the stories as altered accounts of real events, the true identity of this snake has been a puzzle {{since the publication of}} the story, even to professional herpetologists. Many species of snakes have been proposed for it, and Richard Lancelyn Green concludes the Indian Cobra (Naja naja) is the snake which it most closely resembles, rather than <b>Boa</b> <b>constrictor,</b> which is not venomous. The Indian cobra has black and white speckled marks, {{and is one of the}} most lethal of the Indian venomous snakes with a neurotoxin which will often kill in a few minutes. It is also a good climber and is used by snake charmers in India. Snakes are deaf in the conventional sense but have vestiges to sense vibrations and low-frequency airborne sounds, making it remotely plausible to signal a snake by whistling.|$|E
