5|$|The naphtha cut, as that {{fraction}} is called, {{contains many}} different hydrocarbon compounds. Therefore, {{it has an}} initial boiling point of about 35°C and a final boiling point of about 200°C. Each cut produced in the fractionating columns has a different <b>boiling</b> <b>range.</b> At some distance below the overhead, the next cut is withdrawn {{from the side of}} the column and it is usually the jet fuel cut, also known as a kerosene cut. The <b>boiling</b> <b>range</b> of that cut is from an initial boiling point of about 150°C to a final boiling point of about 270°C, and it also contains many different hydrocarbons. The next cut further down the tower is the diesel oil cut with a <b>boiling</b> <b>range</b> from about 180°C to about 315°C. The boiling ranges between any cut and the next cut overlap because the distillation separations are not perfectly sharp. After these come the heavy fuel oil cuts and finally the bottoms product, with very wide boiling ranges. All these cuts are processed further in subsequent refining processes.|$|E

40|$|This study {{deals with}} a slow {{pyrolysis}} of rubberwood in a furnace at an atmospheric pressure to produce pyroligneous liquid or wood vinegar. Pyroligneous liquids produced were separated into two fractions based on temperatures in a furnace. The yields of wood vinegar were quantified. Also pH, SG and <b>boiling</b> <b>ranges</b> were determined. The optimum condition of pyrolysis was obtained at the heating rate of 1. 4 oC/min to the final temperature at 550 oC/min with a yield of 27. 45 %. The pH and specific gravity were attained at about 2. 9 - 3. 83 and 1. 009 - 1. 027, respectively, depend on process conditions. Also the <b>boiling</b> <b>ranges</b> of rubberwood vinegar approximately were 96 - 108 oC based on the ASTM-D 86 method. However, no significantlychanges were seen in the pH, specific gravity and <b>boiling</b> <b>ranges</b> of rubberwood vinegar regarding to hearting rates. For characterization, wood vinegar was fractionated by a distillation into three fractions. Both crude and distilled wood vinegars were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy and gas chromatography. Results showed that the wood vinegar is mainly composed of acetic acid.

50|$|The {{crude oil}} {{distillation}} unit (CDU) is the first processing unit in virtually all petroleum refineries. The CDU distills the incoming crude oil into various fractions of different <b>boiling</b> <b>ranges,</b> each of which are then processed further in the other refinery processing units.

25|$|Regardless {{of crude}} oil source or {{processing}} history, kerosene's major components are branched and straight chain alkanes and naphthenes (cycloalkanes), which normally account for at least 70% by volume. Aromatic hydrocarbons in this <b>boiling</b> <b>range,</b> such as alkylbenzenes (single ring) and alkylnaphthalenes (double ring), do not normally exceed 25% by volume of kerosene streams. Olefins are usually not present at more than 5% by volume.|$|E
25|$|Because of ammonia's {{vaporization}} properties, it is {{a useful}} refrigerant. It was commonly used prior to the popularisation of chlorofluorocarbons (Freons). Anhydrous ammonia is widely used in industrial refrigeration applications and hockey rinks because of its high energy efficiency and low cost. It suffers from the disadvantage of toxicity, which restricts its domestic and small-scale use. Along with its use in modern vapor-compression refrigeration it is used in a mixture along with hydrogen and water in absorption refrigerators. The Kalina cycle, which is of growing importance to geothermal power plants, depends on the wide <b>boiling</b> <b>range</b> of the ammonia–water mixture. Ammonia coolant is also used in the S1 radiator aboard the International Space Station in two loops which are used to regulate the internal temperature and enable temperature dependent experiments.|$|E
2500|$|An {{implication}} of one boiling {{point is that}} lighter components never cleanly [...] "boil first". At boiling point, all volatile components boil, but for a component, its percentage in the vapor {{is the same as}} its percentage of the total vapor pressure. Lighter components have a higher partial pressure and thus are concentrated in the vapor, but heavier volatile components also have a (smaller) partial pressure and necessarily evaporate also, albeit being less concentrated in the vapor. Indeed, batch distillation and fractionation succeed by varying the composition of the mixture. In batch distillation, the batch evaporates, which changes its composition; in fractionation, liquid higher in the fractionation column contains more lights and boils at lower temperatures. Therefore, starting from a given mixture, it appears to have a <b>boiling</b> <b>range</b> instead of a boiling point, although this is because its composition changes: each intermediate mixture has its own, singular boiling point.|$|E
500|$|The {{crude oil}} {{fractionator}} {{does not produce}} products having a single boiling point; rather, it produces fractions having <b>boiling</b> <b>ranges.</b> [...] For example, the crude oil fractionator produces an overhead fraction called [...] "naphtha" [...] which becomes a gasoline component after it is further processed through a catalytic hydrodesulfurizer to remove sulfur and a catalytic reformer to reform its hydrocarbon molecules into more complex molecules with a higher octane rating value.|$|R

The experimental studies were conducted in a fixed-bed continuous-reactor (cata-test unit) at temperatures (300 – 400 °C) and total hydrogen pressure (40 – 65 bar).

2500|$|The first {{automotive}} combustion engines, so-called Otto engines, {{were developed}} {{in the last quarter}} of the 19th century in Germany. The fuel was a relatively volatile hydrocarbon obtained from coal gas. With a boiling point near 85°C (octanes boil about 40°C higher), it was well suited for early carburetors (evaporators). The development of a [...] "spray nozzle" [...] carburetor enabled the use of less volatile fuels. Further improvements in engine efficiency were attempted at higher compression ratios, but early attempts were blocked by knocking (premature explosion of fuel). In the 1920s, antiknock compounds were introduced by Thomas Midgley Jr. and Boyd, specifically tetraethyllead (TEL). This innovation started a cycle of improvements in fuel efficiency that coincided with the large-scale development of oil refining to provide more products in the <b>boiling</b> <b>range</b> of gasoline. In the 1950s oil refineries started to focus on high octane fuels, and then detergents were added to gasoline to clean the jets in carburetors. The 1970s witnessed greater attention to the environmental consequences of burning gasoline. These considerations led to the phasing out of TEL and its replacement by other antiknock compounds. Subsequently, low-sulfur gasoline was introduced, in part to preserve the catalysts in modern exhaust systems.|$|E
