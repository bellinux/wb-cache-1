5|$|Utor caused {{extensive}} {{power outages}} in Cebu, Leyte, and Boracay, resulting in widespread loss of telecommunication. A single electric pole in northern Cebu caught fire during the storm, cutting out power to eight peripheral towns. Downtown Tacloban also suffered a blackout. Off of Boracay, a <b>boat</b> <b>operator</b> was killed after their ship capsized. Another 67ships, {{which consisted of}} speedboats and ferries, sunk during the storm's passage. Buildings were unroofed and trees were torn apart on the island, littering its beaches with debris. A barge was forced by large waves into the pier at San Agustin, Romblon, resulting in the spilling of 25,000L (6,600gal) of diesel fuel. Two children were killed in Tacloban and Capiz {{as a result of}} falling trees; an additional three people in Capiz were feared to have drowned due to floods. Two thousand people became stranded after the Philippine Coast Guard cancelled the operation of 43ferry services. Similarly, 8,000people became stranded at seaports after the coast guard barred vessels from sailing. Extensive damage occurred in Occidental Mindoro, where 422homes were destroyed and an additional 1,421damaged. Rough seas caused the outriggers on a ferry between Batangas and Puerto Galera, Oriental Mindoro to break apart, causing the ship to begin disintegrating offshore. However, the 104passengers and crew on board were able to escape and were later rescued. Further north in southern Luzon, roads and bridges were rendered impassable after sustaining damage.|$|E

40|$|There are {{approximately}} 1500 commercial tour <b>boat</b> <b>operators</b> in Australia {{with a combined}} fleet of approximately 3800 vessels – the majority offer marine fishing, sailing or diving tours. Most of the fishing tour <b>boat</b> <b>operators</b> employ fewer staff and use smaller vessels than the dive and sail tour <b>boat</b> <b>operators.</b> Proportionately more of the vessels used by sail and dive tour <b>boat</b> <b>operators</b> have basic environmental management measures such as ashtrays and garbage bins to reduce overboard littering, and sewage holding tanks with pump-out systems to reduce the impacts of human waste. In addition, more of the sail and dive tour <b>boat</b> <b>operators</b> claim {{to be aware of}} their boat's environmental impacts and also claim to take steps to reduce or remediate them, including the use of environmental management guidelines. These differences in environmental management measures, however, are associated principally with patterns in vessel size, which affects both the practical and regulatory requirements. In addition, more of the dive tour <b>boat</b> <b>operators</b> operate in marine protected areas (MPAs) where regulations are quite often more stringent. Once these factors are allowed for, environmental management of boating related impacts by individual fishing tour <b>boat</b> <b>operators</b> is not significantly worse than by sail or dive tour <b>boat</b> <b>operators.</b> Overall the attempts to reduce environmental impacts are part of the broader thrust to improve sustainability by ecologically modernising the industry. In this regard, there appears to be significant scope for improvement within the Australian tour boat industry in the form of ensuring that their vessels have garbage bins and ashtrays on board, that such items are clearly labelled and that clients are both advised of their location(s) and the need for their use and especially by clearly advising their clients not to throw items overboard (particularly cigarette butts).

25|$|British Aviation Services Limited (Britavia) was {{an early}} post-World War II airline holding company and air {{transport}} operator that could trace its roots back to 1946. Its main activities included trooping, inclusive tour (IT) and worldwide passenger and freight charter services. British Aviation Services' first investment in a British independent airline occurred in 1946, when it acquired a minority interest in Silver City Airways. Silver City Airways operated the world's first cross-Channel air ferry service on 13 July 1948. It subsequently became British Aviation Services' biggest operating division. In 1953, British Aviation Services took over the independent airline Air Kruise. The same year, BAS Group also took control of Aquila Airways, the last commercial flying <b>boat</b> <b>operator</b> in the United Kingdom. The completion of these acquisitions by mid-1954 resulted in a reorganisation of the British Aviation Services group, with British Aviation Services Ltd (BAS Group) becoming the group's holding company and Britavia one of its operating subsidiaries. By the late 1950s, BAS Group became Britain's largest independent airline operator. Its numerous operating divisions included Britavia's Hermes Division at Blackbushe Airport and Aquila Airways's Flying Boat Division at Hamble near Southampton. The former concentrated on trooping services and inclusive tours while the latter provided scheduled services to Portugal, the Canary Islands and Italy. In 1962, BAS Group merged with British United Airways (BUA), which by that time had replaced BAS as the UK's largest independent airline operator.|$|E

Forests surrounding the Wekiva River are home to the largest black bear (Ursus americanus floridanus) population in Florida; several troops of Rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) have adapted to live near the river as well.

40|$|In {{addition}} to providing {{an overview of the}} party boat fishery in the U. S.

Party <b>boat</b> <b>operators</b> were interviewed to determine species targeted, percent time committed to targeting each species, and opinions on current catch restrictions. Over two-thirds of the fieet was located on the west coast of Florida. Overall, most boats targeted < 5 species. Four species accounted for 90 percent of the estimated effort by party boats in the U. S. Gulf of Mexico: Snapper; Lutjanus sp.; grouper, Epinephelus sp. and Mycteroperca sp.; amberjack, Seriola dumerili; and king mackerel, Scomberomorus cavalla. Party boat effort in Texas was devoted primarily to snapper, whereas in Florida most effort was devoted to snapper and grouper collectively. Party <b>boat</b> <b>operators</b> were diverse in their opinions of management regulations in force when interviewed.
