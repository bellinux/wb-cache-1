40|$|A {{functional}} {{magnetic resonance}} imaging (fMRI) -compatible fiber-optic <b>bend</b> <b>sensor</b> was investigated to assess whether the device could be used effectively to monitor opening and closing of the jaw during an fMRI experiment at 3 T. In contrast to surface electromyography, a <b>bend</b> <b>sensor</b> fixed to the chin of the participant is fast and easy to use and is not affected by strong electromagnetic fields. <b>Bend</b> <b>sensor</b> recordings are characterized by high validity (compared with concurrent video recordings of mouth opening) and high reliability (comparing 2 independent measurements). The results {{of this study indicate that}} a <b>bend</b> <b>sensor</b> is able to record the opening and closing of the jaw associated with different overt speech conditions (producing the utterances /a/, /pa/, /pataka/) and the opening of the mouth without speech production. Data post-processing such as filtering was not necessary. There are several potential applications for <b>bend</b> <b>sensor</b> recordings of speech-related jaw movements. First, <b>bend</b> <b>sensor</b> recordings are a valuable tool to assess behavioral performance, such as response latencies, accuracies, and completion times, which is particularly important in children, seniors, or patients with various neurological or psychiatric conditions.

30|$|A {{simple and}} compact fiber <b>bending</b> <b>sensor</b> {{based on the}} Mach-Zehnder {{interferometer}} was proposed. A photonic crystal fiber (PCF) with a length of 10 mm was spliced by collapsing air holes with two conventional single mode fibers to consist of an all fiber <b>bending</b> <b>sensor.</b> The sensitivity of 0.53 nm/m− 1 was obtained at 1586 nm for the curvature range from 0 to 8.514 m− 1. The temperature sensitivity was very low. The measurement error due to the temperature effect was about 8.68 × 10 − 3 m− 1 /°c, and the temperature effect in the curvature measurement could be ignored.

30|$|In the paper, we have {{presented}} two different data gloves {{based on a}} same soft <b>bending</b> <b>sensor.</b> The sensor {{is a combination of}} electrical components and mechanical design. The sensor has excellent sensitivity as well as repeatability. Compared with existing bending sensors, the soft <b>bending</b> <b>sensor</b> is also flexible and can be stretched. The unrecoverable elongation caused by stretch is avoided by a novel structure. The size of the sensor can also be customized. The fabric data-collecting glove solves the problem of sensor slipping, {{and the size of the}} glove can be fully customized. The soft rubber data-collecting glove, in which have totally get rid of traditional design methods, provides a new way for making data gloves. The soft glove acts like a layer of personal customized skin on the back of the hand, and bending motion can be measured directly. The modular design of the glove also simplifies the design and manufacturing procedures. Besides, both the sensor and the two kinds of glove have low cost. The production cost of one such <b>bending</b> <b>sensor</b> is less than 2 dollars, and the costs of two kinds of gloves are less than 30 dollars. Such sensing technology plays a huge role in promoting data-collecting devices from science laboratory into clinical use.|$|E

Figure  10 exhibits the evaluation of Flex Sensor 2.2, the average error between theoretical value and measured value is 7.1 %. In total five flex sensors are used, and they are fixed on PIP joints. The flex sensors and the bending sensors mounted on the glove are firmly attached to each other, so the bending angles of these two sensors can be considered to be the same. Data from flex sensor and <b>bending</b> <b>sensor</b> on the glove are collected at the same time. Figure  11 and Table  2 show the testing results.|$|E

By careful design with a blend of sensitive and insensitive regions, the sensor could be stretchable while being insensitive to stretching. An analytical study was presented on how to design the sensor with the named bending/stretching feature. This feature enables the sensor to be implemented in measuring human motions where a large amount of skin stretch is involved.

30|$|Most of the {{existing}} bending sensors are non-stretchable, and they will slip when fingers bend. So traditional data gloves {{have to be made}} larger than the hand size to reserve some space for the sensors to slip. The gap between the glove and hand may cause some significant error.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Swallowing {{dysfunction}} (also {{known as}} dysphagia), {{which results in}} a deterioration of nutritional intake, slows rehabilitation and causes aspiration pneumonia, is very common following neurological impairments. Although videofluorographic (VF) examination is widely used for detecting aspiration, an objective and non-invasive method for assessing swallowing function {{has yet to be}} established {{because of a lack of}} adequate devices and protocols. In this paper, a <b>bend</b> <b>sensor</b> whose resistance is altered by bending was introduced to monitor swallowing-related laryngeal movement. METHODS: Six healthy male volunteers were recruited in the present study. Specific time points on the signal waveform produced by the <b>bend</b> <b>sensor</b> were defined to describe laryngeal movement by differential analysis. Additionally, the physiological significance of the obtained waveform was confirmed by analyzing the sequential correlations between the signal waveform from the <b>bend</b> <b>sensor</b> and hyoid bone kinetics simultaneously recorded by VF. RESULTS: Seven time points were successfully defined on the signal waveform to reference laryngeal movement. Each time point was well correlated with certain VF events, with evidence of no significant time lags, and there were positive correlations between waveform time points and matched VF events. Furthermore, obvious similarities were noticed between the duration of each phase on the signal waveform and the duration of the matched hyoid bone activity. CONCLUSIONS: The present monitoring system using a <b>bend</b> <b>sensor</b> might be useful for observing the temporal aspects of laryngeal movement during swallowing, and it was well coordinated with hyoid bone movement...|$|R

For soft robots, soft sensors are required to provide sensory and control information while not interfering with the primary compliant and adaptive features of the robotic devices. However, for both of the above application scenarios, bending and stretch are two closely coupled factors.

40|$|An {{optical fiber}} <b>bending</b> <b>sensor</b> and a quasi-distributed optical fiber sensor, where {{isolated}} sensing regions {{can be designed}} to sense strain, bending, etc., are developed as sensor candidates for smart civil engineering materials and structures. Both sensors use two-mode fibers. With the same two-mode fibers, acousto-optic frequency shifters are developed as the main components to accomplish these sensors. Elliptical-core two-mode fibers are chosen to improve the stability and sensitivity of the sensors. A perturbation theory approach is used to investigate the sensing mechanism of the <b>bending</b> <b>sensor.</b> A system to simultaneously measure all the sensing regions of the quasi-distributed sensor is also demonstrated. Because conventional polymer-based fiber coatings often do not adequately protect the fibers themselves nor the fiber sensors during their installations into the concrete or metallic structures, two different processing methods are introduced. They provide superior protection to the fibers and sensors for the installation. The first method is to coat the fiber with a thick metallic layer (aluminum or tin) using a continuous casting process. Coating thicknesses of 0. 5 to 1. 5 mm and length up to 3 m are presented. Using a birefrigent fiber coated with such a thick metallic layer, a sensor for dynamic load or pressure was also implemented. The second method uses the thermal spray technology for directly embedding optical fibers and sensors into or surface attaching them onto concrete and metallic plates. Finally, a sol-gel based process is used for coating optical fibers with piezoelectric lead zirconate titanate films. Coating thicknesses up to 120 mum have been achieved. Piezoelectric-coated fibers {{can be used as}} in-line optical fiber signal processing components for various fiber sensors relevant for smart structure applications.
