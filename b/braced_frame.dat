50|$|A buckling-restrained brace (BRB) is a {{structural}} brace in a building, {{designed to allow}} the building to withstand cyclical lateral loadings, typically earthquake-induced loading. It consists of a slender steel core, a concrete casing designed to continuously support the core and prevent buckling under axial compression, and an interface region that prevents undesired interactions between the two. <b>Braced</b> <b>frames</b> that use BRBs - known as buckling-restrained <b>braced</b> <b>frames,</b> or BRBFs - have significant advantages over typical <b>braced</b> <b>frames.</b>|$|R

40|$|There {{are many}} {{studies in the}} {{literature}} conducted {{on the subject of}} ensuring earthquake safety of reinforced concrete and steel structures using steel <b>braced</b> <b>frames,</b> but no detailed study concerning individual behavior of steel <b>braced</b> <b>frames</b> under earthquake loads and strengthening of reinforced concrete structures with outof-plane steel <b>braced</b> <b>frames</b> has been encountered. In this study, in order to evaluate behaviors of "Concentrically Steel Braced Frames" types defined in TEC- 2007 under lateral loads, dimensional analysis of Concentrically Steel <b>Braced</b> <b>Frames</b> designed with different scales and dimensions was conducted, the results were controlled according to TEC- 2007, and after conducting static pushover analysis, behavior and load capacity of the Concentrically Steel <b>Braced</b> <b>Frames</b> and hinges sequence of the elements constituting the Concentrically Steel <b>Braced</b> <b>Frames</b> were tested. Concentrically Steel <b>Braced</b> <b>Frames</b> that were tested analytically consist of 2 storey and one bay, and are formed as two groups with the scales 1 / 2 and 1 / 3. In the study, Concentrically Steel <b>Braced</b> <b>Frames</b> described in TEC- 2007 were designed, which are 7 types in total being non-braced, X-braced, V-braced, Λ-braced, braced, /-braced and K-braced. Furthermore, in order to verify accuracy of the analytic studies performed, the 1 / 2 scaled concentrically steel X-braced frame test element made up of box profiles and 1 / 3 scaled reinforced concrete frame with insufficient earthquake resistance were tested individually under lateral loads, and test results were compared with the results derived from analytic studies and interpreted. Similar results were obtained from both experimental studies and pushover analyses. According to pushover analysis results, load-carrying capacity of 1 / 3 scaled reinforced concrete frames increased up to 7, 01 times as compared to the non-braced specimen upon strengthening. Results acquired from the study revealed that reinforced concrete buildings which have inadequate seismic capacity can be strengthened quickly, easily and economically by this method without evacuating them...|$|R

50|$|Concentrically <b>braced</b> <b>frames</b> {{can further}} be {{classified}} as either ordinary or special. Ordinary concentric <b>braced</b> <b>frames</b> (OCBFs) do not have extensive requirements regarding members or connections, and are frequently used in areas of low seismic risk. OCBF steel frame buildings originated in Chicago and reinforced concrete frames originated in Germany and France - areas where earthquakes were not an engineering consideration. Accordingly, special concentrically or eccentrically <b>braced</b> <b>frames</b> were later developed with extensive design requirements, and are frequently used in areas of high seismic risk. The purpose of the concentrically- or eccentrically-braced design is to ensure adequate ductility (i.e., to stretch without breaking suddenly).|$|R

30|$|At present, in {{designing}} seismic resistant steel buildings, {{systems such as}} moment <b>frames,</b> concentrically <b>braced</b> <b>frames</b> and eccentrically <b>braced</b> <b>frames</b> are widely used. Moment resisting frames show a good ductility due to the bending yield of the beam but its stiffness in low. Concentrically <b>braced</b> <b>frames</b> have a high stiffness but due to the buckling of the compressional brace, it displays a low ductility. To overcome the problem of stiffness in moment resisting frames and also the problem of low ductility in concentrically <b>braced</b> <b>frames,</b> Hjelmstad and Popov (1983) proposed the eccentric brace. By considering the appropriate amount of eccentricity, the system contains sufficient stiffness and through the shear and bending yield of the intermediary beam, the ductility will be provided. This system has fitting ductility and stiffness but to supply its ductility, the intermediary beam, {{which is one of}} the main elements of the structure, must yield and that results in severe damage to the ceiling which makes the post-earthquake repairing difficult (Balendra and Sam 1991 b, 1994).|$|R

40|$|Abstract: <b>Braced</b> <b>frames</b> {{are often}} used to resist lateral {{earthquake}} loads in steel buildings, but braces can interfere with architectural features. Eccentrically <b>braced</b> <b>frames</b> (EBFs) will accommodate windows, doors, and halls, but have performance limitations when link-to-column connections are required. An alternative to EBFs may be buckling-restrained <b>braced</b> <b>frames</b> with eccentric configurations (BRBF-Es). This paper introduces the concept of BRBF-Es and highlights design considerations. An analytical study was conducted that compares the performance and economy of BRBF-Es with EBFs. Results from non-linear time history analyses indicate that BRBF-Es will have greater residual drifts than comparable EBFs, but are less susceptible to failures at link-to-column connections. BRBF-Es require more steel than EBFs, but savings in design, fabrication, and erection may offset higher material costs. DOI: 10. 1061 /(ASCE) ST. 1943 - 541...|$|R
