This thesis also discusses how to move an SSVEP-based <b>BCI</b> <b>system</b> from a laboratory demonstration to a real-life application. Our neurological results show that : (1) it is feasible to precisely render visual stimuli on mobile devices; (2) the signal quality of the SSVEPs measured from non-hair- bearing areas was comparable with, if not better than, that measured from hair-covered occipital areas; (3) it is practical to build a truly portable and wearable SSVEP- based <b>BCI</b> <b>system</b> integrating dry EEG sensors, miniature electronics, wireless telemetry, online signal-processing pipeline, and visual stimuli presentation on a smartphone. This work may significantly improve the practicality of an SSVEP-based <b>BCI</b> <b>system</b> for either real-life or clinical research. The second one is an On-line Closed-loop Lapse Detection and Mitigation (OCLDM) System for detecting and mitigating driving fatigue. In this thesis we translate the above-mentioned BCI platform to develop and test an OCLDM System that mitigate transient fatigue during a sustained attention task in a simulated driving environment. This system features a mobile wireless dry- sensor EEG headgear and a smartphone-based real-time EEG processing platform.
