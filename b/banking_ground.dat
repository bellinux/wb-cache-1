50|$|From then on Overpack's big wheels {{were part}} of Michigan logging history. Many {{northern}} states used them, and Michigan alone had at least 65 different lumber companies that had them. Michigan's rough and wet forest terrain made logging strictly a winter industry in the nineteenth century. The loggers used frozen ground to skid the logs from the woods to the railheads of rails or to river banks for further transporting. In the spring they would slide the logs from the <b>banking</b> <b>grounds</b> into the rivers for the log drive to the sawmills. Overpack made logging possible in all four seasons when he began manufacturing Michigan logging wheels at his Manistee wagon business.|$|R

40|$|The Samanalawewa reservoir, of Sri Lanka {{developed}} a seriouswater leakage in its right bank since the initial impounding. Thelarge scale remedial exercises implemented, incurring heavy costs toseal off the leakage, in two instances failed indicating the complexnature of the problem. The {{failure of the}} remedial measures alsoindicated the incorrectness of the established leakage mechanism. Inthis dissertation a detailed evaluation of the leakage problem wascarried out {{with the objective of}} establishing the reservoir leakagemechanism. The site hydrogeological data observed during last 15 years was used in this study. Geologically the site, specially the rightbank is a typical karstified site though it was not correctly identifiedduring the initial stages. As observed with the ground water levelbehaviour, the aquifer lying inside the right bank spreads over a widearea. The swift reaction of the right <b>bank</b> <b>ground</b> water level to thereservoir water level as observed during the evaluated period,suggests that the reservoir and the right bank aquifer are in directcommunication. When the relationship between the right bankground water level and the reservoir water level is considered itshows a linear correlation between them. The right <b>bank</b> <b>ground</b> water level behaviour and its correlation withthe reservoir water level resembles the behaviour of a twointerconnected tank system. Therefore the reservoir right banksystem could be modelled using a two tank system. The similaritiesobserved between the reservoir right bank system and the two tankmodel suggest that the leakage inlets in the reservoir are ofconcentrated nature, which is contrary to the general expectation ofwidely extended permeable zones lying along slopes. Further itshows that the reservoir leakage ingress is taking place through a setof few inlets located towards the reservoir bottom. The quantitativeassessment conducted on the leakage inlets and outlets shows thatthe leakage inlets and the outlet are of si...|$|R
