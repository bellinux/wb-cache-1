5000|$|The rise of Ottoman {{rule in the}} Balkans {{modified}} the religious picture of Bosnia and Herzegovina as the Ottomans brought with them a new religion, Islam. Throughout the entire Balkans people were sporadically converting in small numbers; Bosnia, by contrast, experienced a rapid and extensive conversion of the local population to Islam, and by the early 1600s approximately {{two thirds of the}} population of Bosnia were Muslim. Slovenian observer Benedikt Kuripečič compiled the first reports of the religious communities in the 1530s. According to the records for 1528 and 1529, there were a total of 42,319 Christian and 26,666 Muslim households in the sanjaks (Ottoman administrative units) of Bosnia, Zvornik and Herzegovina. In a 1624 report on Bosnia (excluding Herzegovina) by Peter Masarechi, an early-seventeenth-century apostolic visitor of the Roman Catholic Church to Bosnia, the population figures are given as 450,000 Muslims, 150,000 Catholics and 75,000 Orthodox Christians. Generally, historians agree that the Islamization of the Bosnian population was not the result of violent methods of conversions but was, for the most part, peaceful and voluntary. Scholars have long debated the reasons that made this collective acceptance of Islam possible among the Bosniaks, although the religious dynamic of medieval Bosnia is frequently cited. Peter Masarechi, saw four basic reasons to explain the more intensive Islamization in Bosnia: the 'heretical past' of the Bosnians, which had left them confessionally weak and capable of transferring their allegiance to Islam; the example of many Bosnians who had attained high office through the devşirme, and as powerful men were in a position to encourage their relatives and associates to convert; a desire to escape from the burdens of taxation and other services levied on non-Muslim citizens; and finally, an equally strong desire to escape the proselytizing importunities of Franciscan monks among the Orthodox population.Always on a purely religious ground, it is also said, by the orientalist Thomas Walker Arnold for instance, that because of the major heresy in the region at the time, oppressed by the Catholics and against whom Pope John XXII even launched a crusade in 1325, the people were more receptive to the Ottoman Turks. In fact, in the tradition of Bosnian Christians, there were several practices that resembled Islam; like for instance; praying five times a day (reciting the Lord's Prayer).In time, hesitant steps were made towards acceptance of Islam. At first, this Islamisation was more or less nominal. In reality, it was an attempt at reconciling the two faiths. It was a lengthy and halting progress towards their final abandoning of their beliefs. For centuries, they were not considered full-fledged Muslims, and they even paid taxes like Christians. This process of Islamisation was not yet finished in the 17th century, as is witnessed by a keen English observer, Paul Rycaut, who states in The Present State of the Ottoman Empire in 1670: [...] "But those of this Sect who strangely mix Christianity and Mahometanism together, are many of the Souldiers who live on the confines of Hungary and Bosnia; reading the gospel in the Sclavonian tongue…; besides which, they are curious to learn the mysteries of the Alchoran Quran, and the Law of Arabick tongue. ... The Potures Muslims of Bosna are of this Sect, but pay taxes as Christians do; they abhor Images and the sign of the Cross; they circumcise, bringing the Authority of Christ's example for it."Many children of Christian parents were separated from their families and raised to be members of the Janissary Corps (this practice was known as the devşirme system, 'devşirmek' meaning 'to gather' or 'to recruit'). Owing to their education (for they were taught arts, science, maths, poetry, literature and many of the languages spoken in the Ottoman Empire), Serbian, Croatian and Bosnian became one of the diplomatic languages at the porte. The Ottoman period that followed was characterized by a change in the landscape through a gradual modification of the settlements with the introduction of bazaars, military garrisons and mosques. Converting to Islam brought considerable advantages, including access to Ottoman trade networks, bureaucratic positions and the army. As a result, many Bosnians were appointed to serve as beylerbeys, sanjak-beys, mullahs, qadis, pashas, muftis, janissary commanders, writers, and so forth in Istanbul, Jerusalem and Medina. Among these were important historical figures were: prince Sigismund of Bosnia (later Ishak Bey Kraloğlu), Hersekzade Ahmed Pasha, Isa-beg Ishaković, Gazi Husrev-beg, Damat Ibrahim Pasha, Ferhad Pasha Sokolović, Lala Mustafa Pasha and Sarı Süleyman Pasha. At least seven viziers were of Bosnian origin, of which the most renowned was Sokollu Mehmed Pasha (who served as Grand Vizier under three sultans: Suleiman the Magnificent, Selim II, and Murad III). The Ottoman rule also saw many architectural investments in Bosnia and the creation and development of many new cities including Sarajevo and Mostar. This is mostly because of the high esteem the Bosniaks held {{in the eyes of the}} Sultans and the Turks. Bosnia became also a strategic base from which the Ottomans launched their armies northward and westward on campaigns of conquest and pillage. The Turks regarded Bosnia as a [...] "bastion of Islam" [...] and its inhabitants served as frontier guards (serhatlije). The presence of Bosnians in the Ottoman Empire had an important social and political effect on the country: it created a class of powerful state officials and their descendants which came into conflict with the feudal-military spahis and gradually encroached upon their land, hastening the movement away from the feudal tenure towards private estates and tax-farmers, creating a unique situation in Bosnia where the rulers were native inhabitants converted to Islam. Although geographically located in Europe, Bosnia was perceived as culturally distant. Because of the strong Islamic character of the country during the Ottoman period, Bosnia was perceived as more oriental than the Orient itself, an 'authentic East within Europe'. The English archeologist Arthur Evans, who traveled through Bosnia and Herzegovina in the 1870s, claimed that [...] "Bosnia remains the chosen land of Mahometan Muslim Conservatism ... fanaticism has struck its deepest roots among her renegade population, and reflects itself even in the dress." [...] Ottoman rule affected the ethnic and religious make-up of Bosnia and Herzegovina in additional ways. A large number of Bosnian Catholics retreated to the still unconquered Catholic regions of Croatia, Dalmatia and Hungary, at the time controlled by Habsburg Monarchy and the Republic of Venice, respectively. To fill up depopulated areas of northern and western Eyalet of Bosnia, the Ottomans encouraged the migration of large numbers of hardy settlers with military skills from Serbia and Herzegovina. Many of these settlers were Vlachs, members of a nomadic pre-Slav Balkan population that had acquired a Latinate language and specialized in stock <b>breeding,</b> <b>horse</b> raising, long-distance trade, and fighting. Most were members of the Serbian Orthodox church. Before the Ottoman conquest, that church had very few members in the Bosnian lands outside Herzegovina and the eastern strip of the Drina valley; there is no definite evidence of any Orthodox church buildings in central, northern, or western Bosnia before 1463. With time most of the Vlach population adopted a Serb identity.|$|E

40|$|In {{fisheries}} management the spawning stock biomass (SSB) {{is an important}} indicator {{of the status of}} exploited fish stocks. Knowledge on the reproductive biology is essential to estimate SSB. A large variety of reproductive strategies is found. In marine fish two extreme strategies are known, capital spawners which have a determinate fecundity (no de novo oocyte recruitment during spawning), and income spawners which have an indeterminate fecundity (de novo oocyte recruitment during spawning). In this thesis fecundity regulating mechanisms are studied in commercial fish species with contrasting life history. In capital spawning plaice Pleuronectes platessa and herring Clupea harengus, which spawn in autumn and/or winter, oocyte maturation starts around April when daylight length increases. Both species recruit a high number of oocytes which are down-regulated in the course of time in relation to the available energy. After the summer feeding period, when energy levels are highest, plaice shows a second recruitment phase. In herring, no difference was observed in the oocyte development between autumn and winter spawners, although winter spawners continue developing oocytes and spawn fewer but larger eggs. The income <b>breeding</b> <b>horse</b> mackerel Trachurus trachurus utilises food resources during spawning although the first batch of spawned eggs is developed on stored energy. Food availability, through the body condition, is the most important factor regulating fecundity. In situations where food is available during the spawning season traditional determinate spawners may switch to a pseudo-indeterminate fecundity style. In conclusion this thesis shows that fecundity type of marine fish females is not fixed at the species level but represents a plastic response to the environment through food availability and energy allocation...|$|E

However, at present rideability is evaluated rather subjectively in <b>breeding</b> <b>horse</b> performance tests. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the role horse behaviour as well as degree and quality of rein tension might play in judges ’ evaluation of horses ’ rideability. Mares (n = 33) and stallions (n = 13) from two different mare- and one stallion-testing station were observed twice during their performance test dressage training. During these rides, rein tension was measured continuously, and frequency of behaviour patterns such as head-tossing, tail swishing, and snorting was recorded. Rein tension parameters showed reasonable repeatabilities within horse-rider pairs (e. g. mean rein tension: r 2 = 0. 6160. 11; variance of rein tension: r 2 = 0. 5260. 14). Regression analysis revealed that a larger proportion of variance in rideability scores could be explained by maximum (17 %), mean (16 %) and variance (15 %) of rein tension compared to horses ’ or riders ’ behavioural parameters (tail-swishing: 5 % and rider’s use of hands: 5 %, respectively). According to mixed model analysis, rideability scores dropped (all P, 0. 05) with increasing mean, maximum and variability in rein tension (e. g. 20. 3760. 14 scores per additional 10 Newton in mean tension). However, mean rein tension differed between testing stations (P, 0. 0001) ranging between 9. 161. 6 N in one station and 21. 761. 3 N in another station.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{identify}} tests that {{include all the}} criteria necessary to characterise reliably the personality of horses on a large scale: stability of measures across situations and over time, evaluation of independent dimensions, links with use and easy to organise for {{a large number of}} animals. For this purpose, two independent experiments were carried out, involving respectively 24 (experiment 1) and 15 horses (experiment 2). Existing tests were adapted to facilitate their use during <b>breeding</b> <b>horse</b> shows, while their owners held their horses in hand. They were called the “Simplified Personality Tests” (SPT). They involved three fear tests (novel surface, novel object and suddenness), two tactile sensitivity tests (Von Frey filament and hip-stifle axis stimulation) and behavioural measurements conducted during standard horse show tests (assessment of horse conformation and jumping ability). Following the first experiment, it was demonstrated that the measurements carried out during two of the fear tests were significantly correlated (correlations between “novel surface” and “suddenness”: R = 0. 42, p = 0. 04, N = 24), as was also the case for the two tactile sensitivity measures (correlation between “filaments” and “hip-stifle axis” R = 0. 50, p = 0. 01, N = 24). However, the fear and tactile sensitivity measures were not correlated, indicating that they reflected independent dimensions. To test for stability across time, we checked whether the measurements performed during these SPT correlated with equivalent measurements recorded from another series of tests (“Complete Personality Tests”) obtained one month earlier and whose stability over several years had previously been demonstrated. These correlations were all significant except for the “novel object test”. Thus, except for the latter test, all measures were stable across situations and over time and evaluated two independent dimensions: fearfulness (disposition to react {{to a greater or lesser}} extent to new or sudden stimuli) and tactile sensitivity (disposition to react to a greater or lesser extent to tactile stimulation). To determine the relationship between these measures and the horse's behaviour while competing in show jumping competitions, we observed horses ridden during training sessions or competitions one month (experiment 1) or one year (experiment 2) after the tests. Principal component analyses showed that such relationships existed: the most fearful and to a lesser extent the least sensitive horses were more difficult to ride, but performed better when competing because they knocked down fewer bars. Finally, these tests were conducted on more than 650 horses over three years, demonstrating that they are easy to organise on a large scale...|$|E
