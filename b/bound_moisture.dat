40|$|This {{work has}} {{experimentally}} investigated {{the characteristics of}} filtration followed by consolidation dewatering of an alum sludge, with especial attention {{to the effects of}} adding ionic surfactants (SDS or CTAB). The filtration and consolidation stages at a pressure of 3000 psi were discussed separately. The efficiency of filtration is enhanced in the presence of surfactant molecules; however, the cationic surfactant (CTAB) raises the consolidation rate while the anionic surfactant (SDS) retards it. A newly pro-posed rheological model has been employed for interpreting the consolidation data. CTAB would not alter markedly the moisture distribution in the sludge, but SDS does increase markedly the amount of the tightly <b>bound</b> <b>moisture</b> by diminishing the portion occupied by pore water. The possible role of surfactants in the sludge flocs is considered. Both surfactants can be used as condi-tioning aids during the filtration stage.

40|$|Recently {{there has}} been focus on {{determining}} the drying behaviour of particulate material at low moisture contents (< 1 %), {{as a result of}} increased energy costs and purity requirements for dried products. As little is known about. the drying behaviour of particulate material at these low moisture levels, driers have been oversized by including large safety factors in the sizing calculations, thus incurring unnecessary capital expenditure. A research programme was formulated in an attempt to provide a greater understanding of the moisture movement processes occurring at these low moisture levels. The results of this work indicate the significant effects that influence the drying behaviour of particulate material, which may be implemented into drier sizing calculations. Most particulate materials require a significant amount of energy to remove residual amounts of moisture, particularly from microporous media or from strongly hydrophilic surfaces. Quantifying the energy required to remove this <b>bound</b> <b>moisture</b> is possible from a knowledge of heats of wetting as a function of moisture content. These can be calculated from isotherms under controlled conditions using the Clausius-Claperyon equation. As part of a research programme to look at this type of drying behaviour, a novel apparatus was designed and constructed. The function of this apparatus was to record drying profiles of particulate material under various drying conditions and sample sizes. The sensitivity and reproducibility of the drying profiles were the overiding parameters in the design of such an apparatus. Moisture movement at low moisture levels in thin layers and single particulate arrangements can be described by two mechanisms. Solute bound to hydrophilic and/or active pore surfaces requires a normally distributed activation energy to be overcome, for surface diffusion to occur. Solute held in "water clusters" by hydrophobic media, such as polymeric, some plastic and generally swelling solids, can be described by Fickian movement similar to the familiar transport processes known to occur at higher moisture contents. Thus, it is possible to extrapolate the drying kinetics at higher moisture contents to lower-moisture contents in this instance, but not for the surface diffusion process which takes place only at lower moisture levels. For the drying of thicker layers and beds of particles, accurate overall diffusion coefficients need to include a gas phase diffusion term for gaseous movement through the particulate bed. The studies here have extended the understanding of the drying kinetics dissimilarities between drying single isolated particles, single particle agglomerates, thin layers and beds of particulate material. In sizing calculations of drying units, preliminary kinetics tests on the material to be dried need to be performed under similar bed geometries to that in the full-scale drying unit. For example, thin-layer experiments appear to provide accurate drying kinetic data for the design of cascade rotary driers. The thickness of the thin layer in the drying kinetic tests is determined by the observed thickness of the falling film of material during operation of the cascade rotary drier. Higher gas velocities in a fluidised bed, or flash driers, may be best modelled by drying kinetics studies on single particles or single particle agglomerates. However, at lower gas velocities, thin-layer tests may be more suitable because the drying material in the fluidised bed may dry in a bubbling motion. The final section of this work looked at selective drying of various isopropyl alcohol/water mixtures at low moisture levels. Selective drying at higher moisture contents is generally well understood, by applying azeotropic principles to describe liquid-phase moisture removal from porous matrices. Two-component <b>bound</b> <b>moisture</b> in a porous particulate resides in a solid phase. It is not possible for a binary mixture bound directly to the solid to form an azeotropic mixture. Modelling the removal of this binary <b>bound</b> <b>moisture</b> was shown to fit a surface diffusion model, in which each of the two solvents was treated as a separate entity. In short, selective drying is prevalent at low moisture contents but can be described by two distinct surface diffusion models working independently on each binary species...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} binders to improve the flowability of granulates and compactibility of Metformin HCL (Met) using the moist aqueous granulation (MAG) process. The effect of the binder moisture content on granulate and tablet quality was also evaluated. Vinylpyrrolidone–vinyl acetate copolymer (Kollidon VA 64 fine: VA 64), polyvidone (Povidone K 12 : PVP), hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC SSL SF: HPC) and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (Methocel E 5 LV: HPMC) were evaluated as binders. These granulates, except for HPMC, had a lower yield pressure than Met active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). HPMC Met was not sufficiently granulated with low water volume. No problems were observed with the VA 64 Met granulates during the tableting process. However, HPC Met granulates had a bowl-forming tendency, and PVP Met granulates had the tendency to stick during the tableting process. These bowl-forming and sticking tendencies may have been due to the low moisture absorbency of HPC and the high volume of bound water of PVP, respectively. VA 64 Met granulates had the highest ambient moisture content (bulk water, <b>bound</b> water) and <b>moisture</b> absorbency. It was concluded that the type of binder used for the Met MAG process has an impact on granulate flow and compactibility, as well as moisture absorbency and maintenance of moisture balance...|$|R
40|$|The {{simplest}} {{processing of}} cassava is sun drying, yielding a product locally know as gaplek, which may further be processed later into gaplek flour. As in Indonesia the economic value of cassava is considerably low, no serius attention is given on drying the flour. Good quality gaplek flour has moisture {{close to its}} primary bound water content to prevent microbial, chemical, or enzymatic degradation. Gaplek flour is hygrocopic, easily absorb moisture from the surroundings while in transport or during storage leading to increasing water content and water activity and eventually product damage. Knowledge of moisture sorption pattern of gaplek flour is of considerable importance. The pattern can be deduced from moisture sorption curve. Objectives {{of the study were}} to obtain gaplek flour adsorption pattern toward air <b>moisture,</b> <b>bound</b> water fraction (primary, secondary, and tertiary), proper drying process, and flour stability during transportation and storage based on moisture sorption isotherm curve. The curve was determined by conditioning gaplek flour at varying water activities (aw) using saturated salt solution at 28 0 C. Data on water content at equilibrium were then plotted against water activity, and a polynomial of order three was estimated. Limit of primary bound water was determined using BET (Braunauer-Emmet-Teller) equitation. That of secondary one was determined by plotting log (1 -aw) against water content at equilibrium, and that of tertiary one realized when aw = 1.

40|$|Increased use of {{prescribed}} fire by {{land managers}} {{and the increasing}} likelihood of wildfires due to climate change require an improved modeling capability of extreme heating of soils during fires. This issue is addressed here by developing and testing the soil (heat–moisture–vapor) HMV-model, a 1 -D (one-dimensional) non-equilibrium (liquid–vapor phase change) model of soil evaporation that simulates the coupled simultaneous transport of heat, soil moisture, and water vapor. This model is intended for use with surface forcing ranging from daily solar cycles to extreme conditions encountered during fires. It employs a linearized Crank–Nicolson scheme for the conservation equations of energy and mass and its performance is evaluated against dynamic soil temperature and moisture observations, which were obtained during laboratory experiments on soil samples exposed to surface heat fluxes ranging between 10 000 and 50 000 W m − 2. The Hertz–Knudsen equation {{is the basis for}} constructing the model's non-equilibrium evaporative source term. Some unusual aspects of the model that were found to be extremely important to the model's performance include (1) a dynamic (temperature and moisture potential dependent) condensation coefficient associated with the evaporative source term, (2) an infrared radiation component to the soil's thermal conductivity, and (3) a dynamic residual soil moisture. This last term, which is parameterized as a function of temperature and soil water potential, is incorporated into the water retention curve and hydraulic conductivity functions in order to improve the model's ability to capture the evaporative dynamics of the strongly <b>bound</b> soil <b>moisture,</b> which requires temperatures well beyond 150 °C to fully evaporate. The model also includes film flow, although this phenomenon did not contribute much to the model's overall performance. In general, the model simulates the laboratory-observed temperature dynamics quite well, but is less precise (but still good) at capturing the moisture dynamics. The model emulates the observed increase in soil moisture ahead of the drying front and the hiatus in the soil temperature rise during the strongly evaporative stage of drying. It also captures the observed rapid evaporation of soil moisture that occurs at relatively low temperatures (50 – 90 °C), and can provide quite accurate predictions of the total amount of soil moisture evaporated during the laboratory experiments. The model's solution for water vapor density (and vapor pressure), which can exceed 1 standard atmosphere, cannot be experimentally verified, but they are supported by results from (earlier and very different) models developed for somewhat different purposes and for different porous media. Overall, this non-equilibrium model provides a much more physically realistic simulation over a previous equilibrium model developed for the same purpose. Current model performance strongly suggests that it is now ready for testing under field conditions...|$|R
40|$|Cheese is used {{extensively}} in cooking applications, {{mainly because of}} its flavour and heat-induced functionality, which is a composite of different attributes such as softening, flow and stretch. The functional attributes of cooked cheese generally {{have a major impact}} on the quality of foods in which cheese is included as an ingredient, e. g. pizza pie. Owing to its importance in cookery applications, numerous studies have been undertaken on the effects of different factors on the age-related changes in the functionality of cooked cheese, especially Mozzarella, and to a lesser extent, Cheddar and processed cheese. These studies have shown that the functionality of natural cheese is dynamic, with the different functional attributes undergoing marked changes during ripening, and, for a given cheese variety, the desired functional attributes are optimum within a specific time frame during maturation. The time at which the cheese becomes functional and the width of the window - and hence the functional shelf-life, are affected by the extent of chemical changes, including the increase in proteolysis and the ratio of <b>bound</b> to free <b>moisture.</b> The main aims of this project were to investigate the effects of the following on the age-related changes in heat-related functional attributes (e. g. stretchability, fluidity) of cheese: * fat reduction, * the degree of fat emulsification, * the pH and calcium content and their interaction, * the correlation between proteolysis and functional attributes, especially attributes other than flowability, e. g. rheological properties of raw cheese, stretchability of heated cheese, and * the age-related changes in the functionality of cheeses other than Mozzarella, e. g. analogue pizza cheese and Emmental.

40|$|Soil {{moisture}} is a {{key variable}} in hydrology, meteorology and agriculture. It is influenced by many factors, such as topography, soil properties, vegetation type, management, and meteorological conditions. The role of these factors in controlling the spatial patterns and temporal dynamics is often not well known. The aim {{of the current study}} is to analyze spatio-temporal soil moisture patterns acquired across a variety of land use types, on different spatial scales (plot to meso-scale catchment) and with different methods (point measurements, remote sensing, and modeling). We apply a uniform set of tools to determine method specific effects, as well as site and scale specific controlling factors. Spatial patterns of soil moisture and their temporal development were analyzed using nine different datasets from the Rur catchment in Western Germany. For all datasets we found negative linear relationships between the coefficient of variation and the mean soil moisture, indicating lower spatial variability at higher mean soil moisture. For a forest sub-catchment compared to cropped areas, the offset of this relationship was larger, with generally larger variability at similar mean soil moisture values. Using a geostatistical analysis of the soil moisture patterns we identified three groups of datasets with similar values for sill and range of the theoretical variogram: (i) modeled and measured datasets from the forest sub-catchment (patterns mainly influenced by soil properties and topography), (ii) remotely sensed datasets from the cropped part of the Rur catchment (patterns mainly influenced by the land-use structure of the cropped area), and (iii) modeled datasets from the cropped part of the Rur catchment (patterns mainly influenced by large scale variability of soil properties). A fractal analysis revealed that all analyzed soil moisture patterns showed a multifractal behavior, with at least one scale break and generally high fractal dimensions. Corresponding scale breaks were found between different datasets. The factors causing these scale breaks are consistent with the findings of the geostatistical analysis. Furthermore, the joined analysis of the different datasets showed that small differences in soil moisture dynamics, especially at the upper and lower <b>bounds</b> of soil <b>moisture</b> (at maximum porosity and wilting point of the soils) can have a large influence on the soil moisture patterns and their autocorrelation structure.

These will enable refined sugar to be transported in bulk to bottlers, canners and other bulk sugar consumers. this moisture is determined by the rate of crystallization of sucrose because the amorphous sugar recrystallizes on the crystal and the moisture becomes available for evaporation. The rate of release increases proportionally with an increase in temperature. Caking of refined sugar occurs when this <b>bound</b> <b>moisture</b> migrates through the total mass of sugar and collects in the coldest areas especially if the temperature in these areas subsequently rises thus displacing the collected moisture again.

Visibly light- and dark-colored breast fillets were divided into marinated and control groups, and vacuum-tumbled for 20 min at 4 C under 80 kPa pressure. Breast fillets from the four treatment groups were evaluated for shear values, raw and cooked meat pH, drip-loss, cook-loss, water-holding capacity, and 7 d psychrotrophic count. The light-colored fillets were significantly lighter, less red, and more yellow than the dark fillets. Lightness values increased when fillets were marinated. Moreover, the light fillets had a lower pH than dark fillets. The pH values of raw and cooked breast meat were related to meat color but not marination. Dark-colored fillets had significantly higher marination pick-up and a higher fraction of <b>bound</b> <b>moisture</b> and significantly lower drip and cook-loss.

40|$|In {{the context}} of climate change, {{increasing}} efficiency and energy security, biomass gasification is likely {{to play an important}} role in energy production. Atmospheric circulating fluidised bed (CFB) technology was selected for the current study. The primary objective of this research is to develop a computer simulation model of a CFB biomass gasifier that can accurately predict gasifier performance under various operating conditions. An original model was developed using ASPEN Plus (Advanced System for Process ENgineering Plus). The model is based on Gibbs free energy minimisation. The restricted equilibrium method was used to calibrate the model against experimental data. This was achieved by specifying the temperature approach for the gasification reactions. The model predicts syn-gas composition, process conversion efficiency and syn-gas heating values in good agreement with experimental data from a laboratory rig. Operating parameters were varied over a wide range. Parameters such as equivalence ratio (ER), temperature, air preheating, biomass moisture and steam injection were found to influence product gas (syn-gas) composition, syn-gas heating value, and process conversion efficiency. The results indicate an ER and temperature range over which hydrogen (H 2) and carbon monoxide (CO) production is maximised, which in turn ensures a high heating value and cold gas efficiency (CGE). Gas heating value was found to decrease with ER. Air preheating increases H 2 and CO production, which increases gas heating value and gasifier CGE. Air preheating is more effective at low ERs. A critical air temperature exists after which additional preheating has little influence. Steam has better reactivity than fuel <b>bound</b> <b>moisture.</b> Increasing moisture degrades gasifier performance therefore the input fuel should be pre-dried.

40|$|In many applications, it {{is highly}} {{desirable}} to operate a CO 2 laser in a sealed condition, for in an open system the laser requires a continuous flow of laser gas to remove the dissociation products {{that occur in the}} discharge zone of the laser, in order to maintain a stable power output. This adds to the operating cost of the laser, and in airborne or space applications, it also adds to the weight penalty of the laser. In a sealed CO 2 laser, a small amount of CO 2 gas is decomposed in the electrical discharge zone into corresponding quantities of CO and O 2. As the laser continues to operate, the concentration of CO 2 decreases, while the concentrations of CO and O 2 correspondingly increase. The increasing concentration of O 2 reduces laser power, because O 2 scavenges electrons in the electrical discharge, thereby causing arcing in the electric discharge and a loss of the energetic electrons required to boost CO 2 molecules to lasing energy levels. As a result, laser power decreases rapidly. The primary object of this invention is to provide a catalyst that, by composition of matter alone, contains chemisorbed water within and upon its structure. Such <b>bound</b> <b>moisture</b> renders the catalyst highly active and very long-lived, such that only a small quantity of it needs to be used with a CO 2 laser under ambient operating conditions. This object is achieved by a catalyst that consists essentially of about 1 to 40 percent by weight of one or more platinum group metals (Pt, Pd, Rh, Ir, Ru, Os, Pt being preferred); about 1 to 90 percent by weight of one or more oxides of reducible metals having multiple valence states (such as Sn, Ti, Mn, Cu, and Ce, with SnO 2 being preferred); and about 1 to 90 percent by weight of a compound that can bind water to its structure (such as silica gel, calcium chloride, magnesium sulfate, hydrated alumina, and magnesium perchlorate, with silica gel being preferred). Especially beneficial results are obtained when platinum is present in the catalyst composition in an amount of about 5 to 25 (especially 7) percent by weight, SnO 2 is present in an amount of about 30 to 40 (especially 40) percent by weight, and silica gel is present in an amount of 45 to 55 (especially 50) percent by weight. The composition of this catalyst was suggested by preliminary experiments in which a Pt/SnO 2 catalyst was needed for bound water to enhance its activity. These experimental results suggested that if the water were bound to the surface, this water would enhance and prolong catalyst activity for long time periods. Because the catalyst is to be exposed to a laser gas mixture, and because a CO 2 laser can tolerate only a very small amount of moisture, a hygroscopic support for the catalyst would provide the needed H 2 O into the gas. Silica gel is considered to be superior because of its property to chemisorb water on its surface over a wide range of moisture content...|$|E
