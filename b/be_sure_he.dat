5|$|Various biographers have {{proposed}} that Darwin avoided or delayed making his ideas public for personal reasons. Reasons suggested have included fear of religious persecution or social disgrace if his views were revealed, and concern about upsetting his clergymen naturalist friends or his pious wife Emma. Charles Darwin's illness caused repeated delays. His paper on Glen Roy had proved embarrassingly wrong, {{and he may have}} wanted to <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> was correct. David Quammen has suggested all these factors may have contributed, and notes Darwin's large output of books and busy family life during that time.|$|E

25|$|According to a {{contemporary}} account written in early 1862, Ward {{and his brother}} arrived in Shanghai, China in 1860 {{for the purpose of}} trading, perhaps as an extension of their father's New York office. This may be true, but given Ward's activities in the 1850s it is almost certain that Ward had ulterior motives for his return. We can <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> had little respect for the Shanghai business practices, which he dismissed as “lying, swindling and smuggling”. Their arrival coincided with a buildup of Taiping forces in the area.|$|E

25|$|At Pegu, Nanda was {{particularly}} concerned that Ava {{had the support}} of the Shan states. To counter the manpower of Upper Burma, Nanda secretly ordered troops from Prome, Toungoo, Lan Na, Lan Xang and Siam during the dry season of 1583–84. To <b>be</b> <b>sure,</b> <b>he</b> did not trust his remaining vassals either, especially Minkhaung II of Toungoo, his other half uncle who once revolted against none other than Bayinnaung. As a result, Nanda built a series of canals between Toungoo and Pegu. In March 1584, armies from Prome, Toungoo, Lan Na, Lan Xang and Siam marched to Ava. Mingyi Swa was left with a sizable force to guard Pegu.|$|E
25|$|Kelly {{was interviewed}} twice by his {{employers}} who {{concluded that they}} could not <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> was Gilligan's only source. Eventually they took the decision to publicly acknowledge that an employee had come forward who might be the source. The announcement contained sufficient clues for alert journalists to guess Kelly's identity, and the Ministry of Defence confirmed the name when it was put to them. It usually refuses to comment on such matters, and it was alleged by some critics of the government that the Ministry of Defence was implementing a government decision to reveal Kelly's name as part of a strategy to discredit Gilligan. Andrew Rawnsley has claimed that Blair on 8 July sanctioned a strategy designed to reveal Kelly's identity; Lord Hutton found that the decision was only to confirm that a civil servant had come forward, without giving a name, because there was uncertainty that Kelly was in fact Gilligan's source.|$|E
25|$|After {{committing}} {{to build the}} statue, Blumberg was invited to Fort Campbell, where he met veterans of Task Force Dagger. He learned that his depiction of the Green Beret wasn't at all accurate. Blumberg invited them to his studio where they worked closely with him to <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> got the horse and soldier precisely correct. Blumberg took six weeks to re-sculpt the piece until he {{was sure it was}} accurate in every detail. It depicts a Special Forces Green Beret on horseback leading the invasion into Afghanistan. He is holding field glasses in one hand. An M4 with an attached grenade launcher is slung under his shoulder. An outline of a wedding band is visible under the glove of the soldier's left hand. Blumberg said, “That’s my way of tipping my hat to wives, marriages and strain on families. It’s to acknowledge the stresses caused by multiple deployments.” Blumberg created the sculpture's face without using a model or photos. It does not represent the face of a specific individual.|$|E

500|$|... "Longshot {{does have}} one major saving grace, {{and that is}} the penciling of Arthur Adams. I'm going to once again go out on my prophetic limb and predict that Art will soon become a fan favorite. He has a dynamic style that grabs your {{attention}} and won't let go. To <b>be</b> <b>sure,</b> <b>he</b> exhibits some of the weaknesses of any young artist, the occasional awkward pose or crude drawing--but as a first effort this is incredibly impressive. In fact, this limited series should be worth buying simply to watch the progress Adams makes from issue to issue.|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} scene of Act 2, Fleance meets his father, who asks him to take his sword and tells him he is {{reluctant}} {{to go to bed}} due to the [...] "cursed thoughts that nature / gives way to in repose!" [...] On Macbeth's approach, however, Banquo demands the sword be returned to him quickly. Scholars have interpreted this to mean that Banquo has been dreaming of murdering the king. Doing so would make the throne more available for Fleance, and would fulfill the Three Witches' prophecy that his sons would become kings. Since Banquo's good nature is revolted by these thoughts, he gives his sword and dagger to Fleance to <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> does not act on them. Still, he is so nervous at Macbeth's approach that he demands their return. Other scholars have responded that Banquo's dreams {{have nothing to do with}} him killing the king, but that they have revealed to him Macbeth's bloody nature. They argue that Banquo is merely setting aside his sword for the night, but when Macbeth approaches, Banquo, having had these dark dreams about Macbeth, takes back his sword as a precaution. In any case, this scene adds to the dark, uncertain, unsettling tone of the play. Fleance and his father are not even certain of what time it is throughout, as Fleance says when asked at the beginning of the scene [...] "The moon is down; I have not heard the clock." ...|$|E

2500|$|Baldelli {{decided to}} retire {{soon after his}} medical {{condition}} forced him off the Rays' roster during the 2010 ALDS. However, Rays' executive Andrew Friedman advised him {{to take some time}} to <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> really wanted to end his playing career. After three months of consideration, Baldelli officially announced his retirement on January 26, 2011 at 29 years old, stating that due to his illness, [...] "I physically don't feel like I should be playing anymore." [...] He remained in the Rays organization as a [...] "special adviser" [...] working in scouting and player development.|$|E

"Let us at {{the same}} time reflect, seeing that Providence rescues from its perils the world itself, which is no less mortal than we ourselves, that to some extent our petty bodies can be made to tarry longer upon earth by our own providence, if only we acquire the ability to control and check those pleasures whereby the greater portion of mankind perishes. Plato himself, by taking pains, {{advanced}} to old age. To <b>be</b> <b>sure,</b> <b>he</b> was the fortunate possessor of a strong and sound body (his very name was given him because of his broad chest); but his strength was much impaired by sea voyages and desperate adventures. Nevertheless, by frugal living, by setting a limit upon all that rouses the appetites, and by painstaking attention to himself, he reached that advanced age in spite of many hindrances." ...|$|E

2500|$|Five days later, Gee got {{his second}} {{consecutive}} win, pitching a complete game {{and holding the}} Reds to seven hits and two runs. After the game, the Associated Press reported that [...] "the giant Syracusan {{has become one of}} the surprises of mid-season." [...] In early August 1946, The Sporting News published a lengthy feature story about Gee's comeback. The article noted:The six-foot-eight-inch southpaw retired last summer after trying to cure a sore arm for five years. But so determined was he to become a winning big leaguer that he reported to the Giants a month ago. Suddenly he disappeared, only to bob up again. Later he explained that before giving up a good school job in Waterloo, N.Y., he wanted to <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> was okay, so he left the Giants to pitch a semi-pro game. Satisfied, he rejoined the team and on July 21 shut out the Reds for eight innings.|$|E
2500|$|Although chronicles {{provide no}} details on his early life, the young prince {{apparently}} {{made an impression}} on his uncle the king. When he was about 14, he was appointed governor of Tharrawaddy (Thayawadi), {{a small town in}} present-day Bago Region, with the style of Minye Kyawhtin (...) [...] In October 1564, the king gave his 14-year-old nephew the command of the 12,000-man Fifth Army for the upcoming Lan Na and Lan Xang campaigns. While it was not unusual that a young Burmese prince was asked to go to the front, it was uncommon that the 14-year-old was given such a high position. Five other army commanders of the 64,000-strong invasion force were the king, the crown prince, his father, and his two other uncles, all of whom were at least a generation older, and had plenty of military experience. To <b>be</b> <b>sure,</b> <b>he</b> was there to represent the high king in an army largely consisted of Siamese regiments. In fact, his Siamese [...] "deputies" [...] all had prior military experience.|$|E
2500|$|Turning to the {{particular}} facts of this case, the Court commented that the district judge had committed no significant procedural error. [...] He correctly calculated the Guidelines range, considered the statutory factors, and [...] "thoroughly documented his reasoning." [...] In particular, the judge did not ignore {{the seriousness of the}} offense. [...] To <b>be</b> <b>sure,</b> <b>he</b> did not specifically recite the adverse health effects that ecstasy presents. [...] Yet the prosecutor did not urge those adverse health consequences as a basis for imposing the sentence it felt was reasonable. [...] "It was not incumbent upon the District Judge to raise every conceivably relevant issue on his own initiative." [...] Moreover, the probation-only sentence in this case promotes respect for the law. [...] Seven of the eight defendants in the case received prison terms. [...] Gall did not because, as the district judge explained, [...] "a sentence of imprisonment may work to promote not respect, but derision, of the law if the law is viewed merely as a means to dispense harsh punishment without taking into account the real conduct and circumstances in sentencing." [...] Finally, Gall understandably received a more lenient sentence because he withdrew from the conspiracy while the other defendants did not.|$|E
