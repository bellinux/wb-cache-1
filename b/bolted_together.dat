5|$|The spans were {{assembled}} on site. Staging {{was laid}} and rails {{put in place}} to carry a travelling crane. The long beams were hoisted in place first, followed by the vertical bracings, and then the outer and inner plates of the top chordal trusses and the diagonals. The whole structure was <b>bolted</b> <b>together</b> at first, and later riveted by blacksmiths using hand-operated forges. Some individual spans were completed within a week, with contractors being complimented on the efficiency of their work.|$|E
5|$|The {{spandrel}} {{plates were}} welded to the columns {{to create the}} modular pieces off-site at the fabrication shop. The modular pieces were typically 52inches (1.3m) deep, and extended for two full floors and half of two more floors. Adjacent modules were <b>bolted</b> <b>together,</b> with the splices occurring at mid-span of the columns and spandrels. The spandrel plates were located at each floor, transmitting shear stress between columns, allowing them {{to work together in}} resisting lateral loads. The joints between modules were staggered vertically, so the column splices between adjacent modules were not at the same floor.|$|E
5|$|The target chamber is a two-wall {{structure}} {{filled with}} liquid lithium or a lithium alloy between the walls. The lithium captures neutrons from the reactions to breed tritium, and also {{acts as the}} primary coolant loop. The chamber is filled with xenon gas that would slow the ions from the reaction as well as protect the inner wall, or first wall, from the massive x-ray flux. Because the chamber is not highly pressurized, like a fission core, {{it does not have}} to be built as a single sphere. Instead, the LIFE chamber is built from eight identical sections that include built-in connections to the cooling loop. They are shipped to the plant and <b>bolted</b> <b>together</b> on two supports, and then surrounded by a tube-based space frame.|$|E
50|$|A new 'flat-pack' wing {{was added}} to the prison site in October 2007. The {{building}} is made from steel-framed modules that <b>bolt</b> <b>together</b> like a construction toy.

5|$|Following {{the pattern}} {{adopted by the}} earlier tube lines, each of the UERL's lines was {{constructed}} {{as a pair of}} circular tunnels using tunnelling shields with segmental cast iron tunnel linings <b>bolted</b> <b>together</b> and grouted into place as the shield advanced. Generally the tunnels followed surface roads and were constructed side by side, but where the width of the road above was insufficient, tunnels were placed one above the other. Stations on all three lines were provided with surface buildings designed by the UERL's architect Leslie Green in a standardised style modified for each site. These consisted of two-storey steel-framed buildings faced with red glazed terracotta blocks with wide semi-circular windows on the upper floor. The stations had flat roofs and were designed to accommodate upward extension for commercial development. Most stations were provided with between two and four lifts and an emergency spiral staircase in a separate shaft. At platform level, the wall tiling featured the station name and an individual geometric pattern and colour scheme designed by Green.|$|E
25|$|Temporary {{structures}} using glass-reinforced plastic (GRP) segments <b>bolted</b> <b>together</b> {{and mounted}} on a frame are possible.

25|$|The third Algol {{engine was}} in {{the nose of the}} {{fuselage}}; behind it the cockpit was just ahead of the leading edge. The flat sided fuselage consisted of two parts, <b>bolted</b> <b>together,</b> and contained a cabin for ten passengers with a lavatory and luggage compartment. The tail surfaces were straight edged and conventional, with a balanced rudder.|$|E
50|$|The Fedorov Avtomat is a short-recoil operated, locked-breech weapon which fires from {{a closed}} bolt. The bolt locking is {{achieved}} by two dumbbell-shaped locking plates, mounted at {{either side of the}} breech, latching barrel and <b>bolt</b> <b>together</b> through lugs on the bolt. Those plates are allowed to tilt slightly down after about 10 mm of free recoil, unlocking the bolt. A bolt hold-open device is fitted and the firing mechanism is of hammer type.|$|R

Altogether it had 359 parts and had 3 tools supplied with the pack.|$|E
25|$|The tunnels were {{constructed}} using the technique refined by Ole Singstad with the Baltimore Harbor Tunnel, whereby a large ditch was first dug for each tunnel, into which was lowered pre-fabricated tunnel sections cable-suspended from overhead barges. Interior chambers {{were filled with}} water to lower the sections, the sections then aligned, <b>bolted</b> <b>together</b> by divers, the water pumped out, and the tunnels finally covered with earth.|$|E
50|$|Anthony Caro {{encountered}} modernism {{when working}} {{as an assistant to}} Henry Moore in the 1950s. After being introduced to the American sculptor David Smith in the early 1960s, he abandoned his earlier figurative work and started constructing sculptures by welding or <b>bolting</b> <b>together</b> pieces of steel such as I-beams, steel plates and meshes. Twenty Four Hours (1960), in Tate Britain since 1975, is one of his earliest abstract sculptures in painted steel. Often the finished piece was then painted in a bold flat colour.|$|R
50|$|Components of a {{hydraulic}} system (e.g. pumps), controls (e.g. valves) and actuators (e.g. cylinders) need connections that will contain and direct the hydraulic fluid without leaking or losing {{the pressure that}} makes them work. In some cases, the components {{can be made to}} <b>bolt</b> <b>together</b> with fluid paths built-in. In more cases, though, rigid tubing or flexible hoses are used to direct the flow from one component to the next. Each component has entry and exit points for the fluid involved (called ports) sized according to how much fluid is expected to pass through it.|$|R

50|$|The {{vessel was}} {{launched}} on February 7, 1906, by Great Lakes Engineering Works in Ecorse, Michigan. The shipyard had received {{an order to}} rivet together the plates of a 551 ft hull for {{what was then the}} booming Minnesota iron ore trade. Soon the large boat, christened William P. Snyder, was shuttling hematite for the Shenango Furnace Company. William P. Snyder was beginning her working life {{at the same time as}} the development of the assembly line for <b>bolting</b> <b>together</b> consumer goods made with steel, such as automobiles. Iron ore boats would have plenty of work to do. William P. Snyder also carried iron ore to furnaces to make munitions used in World War I and World War II.|$|R
25|$|Introduced in 1995, the single-seat Aventura has repositionable main landing gear, {{down for}} runways and up for landing on water. The {{steerable}} tail wheel is retractable {{in concert with}} the repositioning of the main gear. There is no water rudder. The wing is an aluminium frame covered with pre-sewn Dacron envelopes. The hull is constructed from fibreglass and the wingtip floats are polyethylene. The remainder of the structure is anodized aluminium tubing, <b>bolted</b> <b>together.</b> Controls are conventional three-axis, with full span ailerons and no flaps. The company claims that the fast-build kit can be constructed in 90 hours.|$|E
25|$|The lantern {{room with}} {{hemispherical}} dome roof sits {{on top of}} the tower and is accessed via a hatchway in the floor which is lined with lead. All optics have been removed from the lantern, but a pedestal similar to the original has been recently installed. The cylindrical lantern base is constructed from 4.5mm thick steel plates, with a hatch door on the northern side to allow access to the exterior gallery. Its middle section consists of eight trapezoidal frames, five of which are glazed. The remaining three frames (on the western side) are filled with galvanized sheeting with diagonal bracing. The dome is made from eight steel segments <b>bolted</b> <b>together</b> with additional bar stiffeners. It is painted red on the exterior and topped with a ventilator cowl. The narrow gallery that encircles the lantern has a hardwood timber floor supported by cast iron brackets, and a lightweight tubular balustrade, also painted red.|$|E
25|$|The Sparviero had an all wood, low mounted {{cantilever}} wing of isosceles trapezoidal plan, {{built around a}} single spar and covered with stressed plywood skin, with differential ailerons and trailing edge flaps. The fuselage was a ply skinned wooden monocoque, built in two sections which <b>bolted</b> <b>together</b> just aft of the wings. The forward part held the cabin, which seated four in two pairs, with access via two wide doors over the wings. The roof line of the cabin continued aft into that of the rear fuselage. The Sparviero was initially powered by a 250hp (187kW) Hirth inverted V-8 air-cooled engine, though it was the intention to replace this with a 260hp (194kW) Lycoming horizontally opposed engine in production models and the prototype received one later. Fuel was fed from three tanks, two in the wings {{and one in the}} fuselage. The tail unit was conventional, with the tailplane just above the fuselage. The latter tapered in height rearwards and the fin merged into it with a dorsal fillet. The empennage construction was {{similar to that of the}} wing, except that the control surfaces were fabric covered. The tricycle undercarriage was retractable and fitted with hydraulic brakes.|$|E
40|$|Coils {{employed}} in the magnets of the PHENIX Detector, presently under construction for RHIC (Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider) at the Brookhaven National Laboratory, are massive (weight {approximately} 8000 kG each).

Joints {{were made by}} <b>bolting</b> <b>together</b> either two flat surfaces or a clamp around a rod. Surfaces were gold plated, and no intermediate materials were used. A linear dependence on temperature was seen. Most of the measured conductance values fell into a narrow range: 0. 1 – 0. 2 W K− 1 at 1 K. Results in the literature for similar joints consist of predictions based on electrical resistance measurements using the Wiedemann–Franz law. There is little evidence {{of the validity of}} this law in the case of joints. Nevertheless, our results are in good agreement with the literature predictions, suggesting that such predictions are a reasonable approximation...|$|R
