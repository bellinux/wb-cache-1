60|$|Especially {{she liked}} the Rock Wall. There was a freedom about it, a wide {{spaciousness}} that she found herself instinctively trying to breathe, holding her arms out to embrace and make part of herself. It was a more natural world, a more rational world. She could understand it--understand the green crabs with white-bleached claws that scuttled before her and which she could see pasturing on green-weeded rocks when the tide was low. Here, hopelessly man-made as the great wall was, nothing seemed artificial. There were no men here, no laws nor conflicts of men. The tide flowed and ebbed; the sun rose and set; regularly each afternoon the <b>brave</b> <b>west</b> <b>wind</b> came romping in through the Golden Gate, darkening the water, cresting tiny wavelets, making the sailboats fly. Everything ran with frictionless order. Everything was free. Firewood lay about for the taking. No man sold it by the sack. Small boys fished with poles from the rocks, {{with no one to}} drive them away for trespass, catching fish as Billy had caught fish, as Cal Hutchins had caught fish. Billy had told her of the great perch Cal Hutchins caught {{on the day of the}} eclipse, when he had little dreamed the heart of his manhood would be spent in convict's garb.|$|E
6000|$|It really blows on San Francisco Bay. During the winter, {{which is}} the best {{cruising}} season, we have southeasters, southwesters, and occasional howling northers. Throughout the summer we have what we call the [...] "sea- breeze," [...] an unfailing wind off the Pacific that on most afternoons in the week blows what the Atlantic Coast yachtsmen would name a gale. They are always surprised by the small spread of canvas our yachts carry. Some of them, with schooners they have sailed around the Horn, have looked proudly at their own lofty sticks and huge spreads, then patronisingly and even pityingly at ours. Then, perchance, they have joined in a club cruise from San Francisco to Mare Island. They found the morning run up the Bay delightful. In the afternoon, when the <b>brave</b> <b>west</b> <b>wind</b> ramped across San Pablo Bay and they faced it on the long beat home, things were somewhat different. One by one, like a flight of swallows, our more meagrely sparred and canvassed yachts went by, leaving them wallowing and dead and shortening down in what they called a gale but which we called a dandy sailing breeze. The next time they came out, we would notice their sticks cut down, their booms shortened, and their after-leeches nearer the luffs by whole cloths.|$|E

5000|$|In Greek mythology, Karpos ( [...] ; Καρπός; Carpus, {{literally}} [...] "fruit"), was a youth {{renowned for}} his beauty. He {{is the son}} of Zephyrus (the <b>west</b> <b>wind)</b> and Khloris (spring, or new vegetation), forming a natural metaphor — the <b>west</b> <b>wind</b> heralds the new growth of spring, which then bears fruit.|$|R
50|$|In Greek mythology, Zephyrus was the {{personification}} of the <b>west</b> <b>wind</b> and the bringer of light {{spring and early summer}} breezes; his Roman equivalent was Favonius (hence the adjective favonian, pertaining to the <b>west</b> <b>wind).</b> In the myth of Cupid and Psyche, Zephyrus was the attendant of Cupid, who brought Psyche to his master's palace.|$|R
50|$|It also {{maintains}} consistent calm waters as the town's {{location on}} the Bellarine Peninsula helps protect it from the bay's typical year round south <b>west</b> <b>winds.</b> Thus whilst large waves may be pounding {{on the east side}} of Port Phillip Bay due to strong south <b>west</b> <b>winds,</b> the water could be rather calm at St Leonards.|$|R
40|$|When seen at frost cap minimum, Martian north polar erg dunes {{north of}} 80 deg N record east winds, while those south of that {{latitude}} record <b>west</b> <b>winds.</b> Many of the transverse dunes {{are considered to}} be reversing dunes, and dunes in the two fields may have reversed at least once during the lifetime of the Viking Orbiters. It is proposed that the average polar winds are strong, off-pole northwest winds in the fall, moderate <b>west</b> <b>winds</b> in winter, latitude-dependent weak-to-strong off-pole northeast winds in spring, and weak <b>west</b> <b>winds</b> in summer, as has been largely confirmed by Viking images of near polar clouds. Over millenia, the combination of reversing <b>west</b> and east <b>winds</b> could produce the biomodal distributions of dune orientations observed at the north pole...|$|R
