5|$|The biotechnological {{applications}} of toxin-antitoxin systems {{have begun to}} be realised by several biotechnology organisations. A primary usage is in maintaining plasmids in a large bacterial cell culture. In an experiment examining {{the effectiveness of the}} hok/sok locus, it was found that segregational stability of an inserted plasmid expressing <b>beta-galactosidase</b> was increased by between 8 and 22 times compared to a control culture lacking a toxin-antitoxin system. In large-scale microorganism processes such as fermentation, progeny cells lacking the plasmid insert often have a higher fitness than those who inherit the plasmid and can outcompete the desirable microorganisms. A toxin-antitoxin system maintains the plasmid thereby maintaining the efficiency of the industrial process.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{bacterial}} cloning vectors (e.g. pUC19 {{and later}} derivatives including the pGEM vectors) use the blue-white screening system to distinguish colonies (clones) of transgenic cells {{from those that}} contain the parental vector (i.e. vector DNA with no recombinant sequence inserted). In these vectors, foreign DNA is inserted into a sequence that encodes {{an essential part of}} <b>beta-galactosidase,</b> an enzyme whose activity results in formation of a blue-colored colony on the culture medium that is used for this work. Insertion of the foreign DNA into the <b>beta-galactosidase</b> coding sequence disables the function of the enzyme, so that colonies containing transformed DNA remain colorless (white). Therefore, experimentalists are easily able to identify and conduct further studies on transgenic bacterial clones, while ignoring those that do not contain recombinant DNA.|$|E

Clinical features are similar in both types but appear milder in Morquio Type B. Onset is between ages 1 and 3. Neurological complications include spinal nerve and nerve root compression resulting from extreme, progressive skeletal changes, particularly in the ribs and chest; conductive and/or neurosensitive loss of hearing and clouded corneas.

The purification procedure consisted of ammonium sulfate fractionation, acid precipitation, ion exchange chromatography through DEAE-sephadex and affinity chromatography through Lactosyl-sepharose columns. The three isoforms isolated from the two cultivars showed the same chromatographic patterns, same optimum of temperature for enzyme activity assay (60 ºC), identical thermal stability up to 50 °C, and similar pH optima (3 - 4). However, they differed {{from each other in}} sensitivity towards metal ions and certain chemical agents presents in the assay medium.

25|$|GM1 Storage Disease, one of {{a family}} of {{conditions}} called GM1 gangliosidoses, is a recessive, genetic disorder that is inevitably fatal. It is caused by a deficiency of <b>beta-galactosidase,</b> with resulting abnormal storage of acidic lipid materials in cells of the central and peripheral nervous systems, but particularly in the nerve cells. Because PWDs are all rather closely related to one another and share a limited gene pool, PWDs who were GM1 Storage Disease carriers were able to be genetically identified, and the condition has now been almost entirely eliminated from the breed. All breeding stock should be tested for GM-1 storage disease or GM1 gangliosidoses, which is a fatal nerve disease that typically appears when a puppy is approximately six months of age. The affected puppy will show clinical signs of cerebellar dysfunction including ataxia, tremors, paresis, and seizures. The pet may also exhibit a change in temperament. Lesions of the retina and clouding of the cornea may occur. GM-1 storage disease is a recessive deficiency of betagalactosidase.

2500|$|The {{cloning vector}} is {{treated with a}} {{restriction}} endonuclease to cleave the DNA at the site where foreign DNA will be inserted. The restriction enzyme is chosen to generate a configuration at the cleavage site that {{is compatible with the}} ends of the foreign DNA (see DNA end). Typically, this is done by cleaving the vector DNA and foreign DNA with the same restriction enzyme, for example EcoRI. Most modern vectors contain a variety of convenient cleavage sites that are unique within the vector molecule (so that the vector can only be cleaved at a single site) and are located within a gene (frequently <b>beta-galactosidase)</b> whose inactivation can be used to distinguish recombinant from non-recombinant organisms at a later step in the process. To improve the ratio of recombinant to non-recombinant organisms, the cleaved vector may be treated with an enzyme (alkaline phosphatase) that dephosphorylates the vector ends. [...] Vector molecules with dephosphorylated ends are unable to replicate, and replication can only be restored if foreign DNA is integrated into the cleavage site.|$|E
40|$|Background: Galactooligosaccharides are {{selectively}} fermented by {{the beneficial}} {{member of the}} colonic microflora contributing {{to the health of}} the host. Objective: We assessed the prebiotic potential of a novel galactooligosaccharide produced through the action of <b>beta-galactosidases,</b> originating from a probiotic Bifidobacterium bifidum strain, against a galactooligosaccharide produced through the action of an industrial P-galactosidase and a placebo. Design: Fifty-nine healthy human volunteers participated in this study. Initially, the effect of the matrix on the prebiotic properties of a commercially available galactooligosaccharide (7 g/d) was assessed during 7 -d treatment periods with a 7 -d washout period in between. During the second phase, 30 volunteers were assigned to a sequence of treatments (7 d) differing in the amount of the novel galactooligosaccharide (0, 3. 6, or 7 g/d). Stools were recovered before and after each intervention, and bacteria numbers were determined by fluorescent in situ hybridization. Results: Addition of the novel galactooligosaccharide mixture significantly increased the bifidobacterial population ratio compared with the placebo (P < 0. 05), whereas 7 g/d of the novel galactooligosaccharide significantly increased the bifidobacterial ratio compared with the commercial galactooligosaccharide (P < 0. 05). Moreover, a significant relation (P < 0. 001) between the bifidobacteria proportion and the novel galactooligosaccharide dose (0, 3. 6, and 7 g/d) was observed. This relation was similar to the effect of the novel galactooligosaccharide on the prebiotic index of each dose. Conclusions: This study showed that galactooligosaccharide mixtures produced with different <b>beta-galactosidases</b> show different prebiotic properties and that, by using enzymes originating from bifidobacterial species, an increase in the bifidogenic properties of the prebiotic product is achievable...|$|R
40|$|Four {{different}} <b>beta-galactosidases</b> (previously named BbgI, BbgII, BbgIII and BbgIV) from Bifidobacterium bifidum NCIMB 41171 were overexpressed in Escherichia coli, purified to homogeneity {{and their}} biochemical properties and substrate preferences comparatively analysed. BbgI was forming a hexameric protein complex of 875 kDa, whereas BbgII, BbgIII and BbgIV were dimers with native molecular masses of 178, 351 and 248 kDa, respectively. BbgII {{was the only}} enzyme that preferred acidic conditions for optimal activity (pH 5. 4 - 5. 8), whereas the other three exhibited optima in more neutral pH ranges (pH 6. 4 - 6. 8). Na+ and/or K+ ions were prerequisite for BbgI and BbgIV activity in Bis-Tris-buffered solutions, whereas Mg++ was strongly activating them in phosphate-buffered solutions. BbgII and BbgIII were slightly influenced from {{the presence or absence}} of cations, with Mg++, Mn++ and Ca++ ions exerting the most positive effect. Determination of the specificity constants (k(cat) /K-m) clearly indicated that BbgI (6. 11 x 10 (4) s(- 1) M- 1), BbgIII (2. 36 x 10 (4) s(- 1) M- 1) and especially BbgIV (4. 01 x 10 (5) s(- 1) M- 1) are highly specialised in the hydrolysis of lactose, whereas BbgII is more specific for beta-D-(1 -> 6) galactobiose (5. 59 x 10 (4) s(- 1) M- 1) than lactose (1. 48 x 10 (3) s(- 1) M- 1). Activity measurements towards other substrates (e. g. beta-D-(1 -> 6) galactobiose, beta-D-(1 -> 4) galactobiose, beta-D-(1 -> 4) galactosyllactose, N-acetyllactosamine, etc.) indicated that the <b>beta-galactosidases</b> were complementary to each other by hydrolysing different substrates and thus contributing in a different way to the bacterial physiology...|$|R

40|$|All the {{anomalous}} reactions {{secondary to}} food ingestion {{are defined as}} 'adverse reactions to food'. In 1995 the European Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology suggested a classification {{on the basis of}} the responsible pathogenetic mechanism; according to this classification, non-toxic reactions can be divided into 'food allergies' when they recognize immunological mechanisms, and 'food intolerances' when there are no immunological implications. The diagnostic approach to adverse reactions to food is based on accurate clinical history and objective examination, and further execution of specific tests when allergy or intolerance is suspected. The therapy for food allergies is the elimination of the food to which hypersensibility has been found; this strategy can lead, especially in pediatric age, to tolerance. If elimination diets cannot be completely performed, or if it is not possible to identify the food to eliminate, some drugs (e. g. antihistaminics, steroids, etc.) can be administered. Specific allergen immunotherapy has been recently introduced. Fundamental is food allergy prevention, especially in high-risk subjects.

Although this strain {{is generally considered}} an adult-type bifidobacterial species, {{it has also been}} shown to have pre-clinical efficacy in obesity models. In order to understand the molecular basis of its adaptation to complex carbohydrates and improve its potential functionality, we have analyzed its genome and transcriptome, as well as its metabolic output when growing in galacto-oligosaccharides derived from lactulose (GOS-Lu) as carbon source. B. pseudocatenulatum CECT 7765 shows strain-specific genome regions, including a great diversity of sugar metabolic-related genes. A preliminary and exploratory transcriptome analysis suggests candidate over-expression of several genes coding for sugar transporters and permeases; furthermore, five out of seven <b>beta-galactosidases</b> identified in the genome could be activated in response to GOS-Lu exposure. Here, we also propose that a specific gene cluster is involved in controlling the import and hydrolysis of certain di- and tri-saccharides, which seemed to be those primarily taken-up by the bifidobacterial strain. This was discerned from mass spectrometry-based quantification of different saccharide fractions of culture supernatants. Our results confirm that the expression of genes involved in sugar transport and metabolism and in the synthesis of leucine, an amino acid with a key role in glucose and energy homeostasis, was up-regulated by GOS-Lu. This was done using qPCR in addition to the exploratory information derived from the single-replicated RNAseq approach, together with the functional annotation of genes predicted to be encoded in the B. pseudocatenulatum CETC 7765 genome...|$|R
