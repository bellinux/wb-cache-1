40|$|In {{the context}} of team sport events monitoring, the various phases of the game must be delimited and interpreted. In {{the case of a}} {{basketball}} game, the detection and the tracking of the ball are mandatory. This paper deals with the detection of the <b>ballistic</b> <b>trajectory</b> of a ball thrown between two players or toward the basket. <b>Ballistic</b> <b>trajectories</b> build on the 3 D ball candidates previously detected at each timestamp. The proposed method is based on a graph, for which the nodes are the observed velocity between two 3 D candidates, the edges link two nodes that have a common 3 D candidate and the cost function is proportional to the distance between the observed acceleration and the gravity one. Hence, looking for the shortest path in this graph is equivalent to searching for 3 D candidates that follow a <b>ballistic</b> <b>trajectory.</b> It appears to be both quite efficient and effective.

Contours of launch energy requirements, {{as well as many}} other launch and Mars arrival parameters, are presented in launch date/arrival date space for all launch opportunities from 1990 through 2005. In addition, an extensive text is included which explains mission design methods. from launch window development to Mars probe and orbiter arrival design, utilizing the graphical data in this volume as well as numerous equations relating various parameters.

40|$|When {{analysing}} blood spatters, traces {{often occur}} which regarding the collision angle, cannot be allocated to any supposed centre of origin. Drops following highly curved (<b>ballistic)</b> <b>trajectories</b> usually form {{these types of}} traces. The reconstruction of such trajectories requires knowledge of the mass, the diameter (of which approximations are known) and the velocity of the blood drops.

50|$|The United States Department of Defense and NATO {{define a}} <b>ballistic</b> <b>{{trajectory}}</b> as a trajectory traced after the propulsive force is terminated {{and the body}} is acted upon only by gravity and aerodynamic drag.A special case of a <b>ballistic</b> <b>trajectory</b> for a rocket is a lofted trajectory, a trajectory with an apogee greater than the minimum-energy trajectory to the same range. In other words, the rocket travels higher and by doing so it uses more energy {{to get to the}} same landing point. This may be done for various reasons such as increasing distance to the horizon to give greater viewing/communication range or for changing the angle with which a missile will impact on landing. Lofted trajectories are sometimes used in both missile rocketry and in spaceflight.|$|R
