Luke's struggle for supremacy peaks when he leads a work crew in a seemingly impossible but successful effort to complete a road-paving job in less than one day.

This made room for the addition of five through-platform faces, while the removal of the narrow island platforms in the middle of the train shed allowed the main Up and Down platforms to <b>be</b> <b>both</b> widened and lengthened.

5|$|By 494 BC the Persian {{army and}} navy had regrouped, {{and they made}} {{straight}} for the epicentre of the rebellion at Miletus. The Ionian fleet sought to defend Miletus by sea, but was decisively beaten at the Battle of Lade, after the defection of the Samians. Miletus was then besieged, captured, and its population was brought under Persian rule. This double defeat effectively ended the revolt, and the Carians surrendered to the Persians as a result. The Persians spent 493 BC reducing the cities along the west coast that still held out against them, before finally imposing a peace settlement on Ionia which was generally considered to <b>be</b> <b>both</b> just and fair.|$|E

5|$|Displays are {{classified}} as deimatic or aposematic by {{the responses of the}} animals that see them. Where predators are initially startled but learn to eat the displaying prey, the display is classed as deimatic, and the prey is bluffing; where they continue to avoid the prey after tasting it, the display is taken as aposematic, meaning the prey is genuinely distasteful. However, these categories are not entirely mutually exclusive. It is possible for a behaviour to <b>be</b> <b>both</b> deimatic and aposematic, if it both startles a predator and indicates the presence of anti-predator adaptations.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, Gifu {{also served}} as the base for the {{creation}} of Japan's fire balloons. These paper-based, bomb-carrying hot air balloons were used in a failed attempt to cause havoc on American soil. Local high school girls made these fire balloons out of Mino washi (a thin but strong Japanese paper) and konnyaku paste. Originally, rubberized silk was used to help these bombs use the newly discovered jet stream to traverse the Pacific Ocean, but Gifu's paper was found to <b>be</b> <b>both</b> stronger, lighter, and more airtight.|$|E
5|$|In 1825, Clifford's Tower and the Waud {{house were}} {{purchased}} by the county of Yorkshire {{at the cost of}} £8,800 (£665,000 at 2009 prices). The new prison buildings, designed by architects P. F. Robinson and G. T. Andrews, were constructed in a Tudor Gothic style, including a gatehouse 35 feet (11 metres) high and a radial prison block, protected by a long, high stone wall. The prison, considered to be the strongest such building in England, was built entirely of stone to <b>be</b> <b>both</b> secure and fireproof. Dark grey gritstone was used in the construction to produce a forbidding appearance, although the prison itself was considered healthy and well ventilated.|$|E

The project eventually collapsed when Coppola's American Zoetrope experienced financial problems. Tucker was revived in 1986 when Coppola's friend, George Lucas, joined as a producer.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Nokia {{released}} a Python interpreter for the Series 60 mobile phones named PyS60.

5|$|It is an {{outstanding}} example of a late medieval aisled barn and is the largest timber-framed building in England. Barns of this type {{were based on a}} longitudinal frame, with two rows of posts connected by arcade plates. Because such barns tend to <b>be</b> <b>both</b> long and high, they experience high structural loads from the wind. They therefore have numerous internal braces, acting {{in much the same way}} as buttresses, to strengthen the structure. This gives the barn its distinctive internal appearance, with a lattice of beams and braces holding up the roof. The techniques used in its construction are similar to those employed on the great cathedrals being built at the time, and some of the same craftsmen were probably involved.|$|E
