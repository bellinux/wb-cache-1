5|$|Vessel strikes cause {{death for}} a number of marine mammals, {{especially}} whales. In particular, fast commercial vessels such as container ships can cause major injuries or death when they collide with marine mammals. Collisions occur both with large commercial vessels and recreational boats and cause injury to whales or smaller cetaceans. The critically endangered North Atlantic right whale is particularly affected by vessel strikes. Tourism <b>boats</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> whale and dolphin watching can also negatively impact on marine mammals by interfering with their natural behavior.|$|E
25|$|Traditional sailboats are monohulls, but {{multi-hull}} catamarans and trimarans {{are gaining}} popularity. Monohull boats generally rely on ballast for stability and usually are displacement hulls. This stabilizing ballast can, in <b>boats</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> racing, {{be as much}} as 50% of the weight of the boat, but is generally around 30%. It creates two problems; one, it gives the monohull tremendous inertia, making it less maneuverable and reducing its acceleration. Secondly, unless it has been built with buoyant foam or air tanks, if a monohull fills with water, it will sink.|$|E
2500|$|Turnagain Arm and Knik Arm {{are known}} for large areas of silt. At low tide, {{much of this is}} exposed, making marine {{navigation}} difficult. Historically, ships and <b>boats</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> the area had a relatively flat bottom with a modest centerboard and absence of a large keel because the boats would occasionally become beached at low tide either on purpose or by accident. [...] This design allowed the craft to support its weight on land without sustaining any serious damage to its structure. [...] An example of this design is the Nomad, a much photographed fishing boat once owned by Joe Reddington which has sat on a mudflat near Knik for several decades.|$|E

50|$|Surf kayaking is the sport, technique, and equipment, used in surfing ocean waves with kayaks. Surf kayaking {{has many}} {{similarities}} to surf board surfing, but with <b>boats</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> use in surf zones, {{and with a}} paddle.

50|$|A recent {{development}} has been the 2.4 Metre Class—a Metre class <b>boat</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> a solo sailor. As a keelboat, and unlike a dinghy, {{it does not require}} the crew to balance his weight to keep the boat from capsizing. Therefore, it has become a very popular class for the physically disabled, and is currently used in the Paralympics.|$|R
50|$|The Soling is {{a strong}} <b>boat</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> any wind and sea {{condition}} and is - above all - fun to sail.

50|$|Once {{sufficiently}} powerful marine motors {{had been}} developed to allow powerboats to plane, {{it was found that}} the flat underside of a chined boat provided maximum hydrodynamic lift, while the sharp discontinuity at the chine enabled spray to be deflected away as opposed to riding up the sides of the boat. Consequently, almost all <b>boats</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> high speed on the plane are nowadays of hard chine construction.|$|E
50|$|The Swan 57 was {{designed}} by Olin Stephens and built by Nautor's Swan and first launched in 1977. 49 boats were built during a production run that started in 1977 and ended in 1984.

50|$|The {{boats are}} made of a honeycomb-sandwich {{laminate}} that is heat-cured at high temperatures, producing stronger shells than the more traditional cold-curing method of construction. Janousek {{was one of the}} first rowing boat makers in the world to offer this method of rowing boat construction. Janousek manufacture singles, doubles, coxless pairs, coxless fours and quads (in one of three hull shapes), bow and stern-coxed fours and quads (in one of two hull shapes), and sectional eights. They offer a wide range of <b>boats</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> different average crew weights.|$|E

5000|$|During {{the era of}} Prohibition in the United States, these boats {{joined the}} ranks of [...] "rum-runners" [...] {{transferring}} illegal liquor from larger vessels waiting outside U.S. territorial waters to the mainland. The high speed of such craft enabled them to avoid interception by the Coast Guard. More recently the term [...] "cigarette boat" [...] has replaced the term [...] "rum-runner". The present era of cigarette boats, dating from the 1960s, owes much of their design to <b>boats</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> offshore powerboat racing, particularly by designer and builder Donald Aronow. During this period, these boats were used by drug smugglers to transfer drugs across the Caribbean to the United States.|$|E
50|$|A tub {{boat lift}} {{is a type}} of boat lift {{designed}} to lift tub boats between different elevations of a canal. Tub boats are small boats used to transport coal and other minerals, sometimes working singly, sometimes in long trains. A tub boat lift (Kahnhebehaus) lifts the boat out of the water. Most other types of boat lift such as locks or inclined planes are designed to move the boat afloat in some kind of water-filled tank, and, apart from maximum dimensions, are not restricted in the type of craft transported. Tub boat lifts and tub boats are designed to work together as a system. A given lift will only be able to lift <b>boats</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> the lift.|$|E
50|$|The CANT 6 was {{a flying}} <b>boat</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> Italian {{military}} service in 1925.

One of these was retained by CANT, but the other entered airline service with Società Italiana Servizi Aerei.|$|R
