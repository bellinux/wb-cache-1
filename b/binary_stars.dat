5|$|Escher's {{interest}} in geometry is well known, {{but he was}} also an avid amateur astronomer, and in the early 1940s he {{became a member of the}} Dutch Association for Meteorology and Astronomy. He owned a 6cm refracting telescope, and recorded several observations of <b>binary</b> <b>stars.</b>|$|E
5|$|These {{ideas were}} {{initially}} taken as postulates, but {{today there are}} efforts to test each of them. For example, the first assumption has been tested by observations showing that largest possible deviation of the fine structure constant {{over much of the}} age of the universe is of order 10−5. Also, general relativity has passed stringent tests on the scale of the Solar System and <b>binary</b> <b>stars.</b>|$|E
5|$|A multi-star system {{consists}} {{of two or more}} gravitationally bound stars that orbit each other. The simplest and most common multi-star system is a binary star, but systems of three or more stars are also found. For reasons of orbital stability, such multi-star systems are often organized into hierarchical sets of <b>binary</b> <b>stars.</b> Larger groups called star clusters also exist. These range from loose stellar associations with only a few stars, up to enormous globular clusters with hundreds of thousands of stars. Such systems orbit their host galaxy.|$|E
5000|$|In 2011, <b>Binary</b> <b>Star's</b> {{official}} Myspace page stated that, [...] "Recently reuniting after a 10-year hiatus, <b>Binary</b> <b>Star</b> {{is back in}} {{the studio}} working on its long awaited follow-up to the classic debut album Masters of the Universe (M.O.T.U.). Tentatively titled Light Years Apart, the duo's EP serves as a mere prequel to a full-length LP." [...] The duo released an EP in 2013, however renaming the title to <b>Binary</b> <b>Star</b> (15 Year Anniversary Edition).|$|R
50|$|Some planets orbit {{one member}} of a <b>binary</b> <b>star</b> system, and several circumbinary planets have been {{discovered}} which orbit around both members of <b>binary</b> <b>star.</b> A few planets in triple star systems are known {{and one in the}} quadruple system Kepler-64.|$|R
25|$|Indus {{is home to}} {{one bright}} <b>binary</b> <b>star.</b> Theta Indi is a <b>binary</b> <b>star</b> {{divisible}} in small amateur telescopes, 97 light-years from Earth. Its primary is a white star of magnitude 4.5 and its secondary is a white star of magnitude 7.0.|$|R
5|$|<b>Binary</b> <b>stars</b> form a {{significant}} portion of the total population of stellar systems, with up to half of all stars occurring in binary systems. Numerical simulations of globular clusters have demonstrated that binaries can hinder and even reverse the process of core collapse in globular clusters. When a star in a cluster has a gravitational encounter with a binary system, a possible result is that the binary becomes more tightly bound and kinetic energy is added to the solitary star. When the massive stars in the cluster are sped up by this process, it reduces the contraction at the core and limits core collapse.|$|E
5|$|Capella {{has long}} been {{suspected}} to be slightly variable. Its amplitude of about 0.1 magnitudes means that it may at times be brighter or fainter than both Rigel and Vega, which are also slightly variable. The system has been classified as an RS Canum Venaticorum variable, a class of <b>binary</b> <b>stars</b> with active chromospheres that cause huge starspots, {{but it is still}} only listed as a suspected variable in the General Catalogue of Variable Stars. Unusually for RS CVn systems, the hotter star, Capella Ab, has the more active atmosphere because it is located in the Hertzsprung gap—a stage where it is changing its angular momentum and deepening its convection zone.|$|E
5|$|The cluster {{core radius}} is about 8 light years and tidal radius is about 43 light years. The cluster {{contains}} over 1,000 statistically confirmed members, although this figure excludes unresolved <b>binary</b> <b>stars.</b> Its light {{is dominated by}} young, hot blue stars, up to 14 {{of which can be}} seen with the naked eye depending on local observing conditions. The arrangement of the brightest stars is somewhat similar to Ursa Major and Ursa Minor. The total mass contained in the cluster is estimated to be about 800 solar masses and is dominated by fainter and redder stars.|$|E
40|$|A <b>binary</b> <b>star</b> is a {{star system}} {{consisting}} of two stars orbiting around their common center of mass. The brighter star is called the primary {{and the other is}} its companion star, comes, or secondary. Research between the early 1800 s and today suggests that many stars are part of either <b>binary</b> <b>star</b> systems or star systems with more than two stars, called multiple star systems. The term double star may be used synonymously with <b>binary</b> <b>star,</b> but more generally, a double star may be either a <b>binary</b> <b>star</b> or an optical double star which consists of two stars with no physical connection but which appear close together in the sky as seen from the Earth. A double star may be determined to be optical if its components have sufficiently different proper motions or different radial velocities, or if parallax measurements reveal its two components to be at sufficiently different distances from the Earth. Most known double stars have not yet been determined to be either bound <b>binary</b> <b>star</b> systems or optical doubles...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we have {{reviewed}} the present status of the theory of equilibrium configurations of compact <b>binary</b> <b>star</b> systems in Newtonian gravity. Evolutionary processes of compact <b>binary</b> <b>star</b> systems due to gravitational wave emission can be divided into three stages according to the time scales and configurations. The evolution is quasi-stationary until a merging process starts, since the time scale of the orbital change due to gravitational wave emission is longer than the orbital period. In this stage, equilibrium sequences can be applied to evolution of compact <b>binary</b> <b>star</b> systems. Along the equilibrium sequences, there appear several critical states where some instability sets in or configuration changes drastically. We have discussed relations among these critical points and have stressed the importance of the mass overflow as well as the dynamical instability of orbital motions. Concerning the equilibrium sequences of <b>binary</b> <b>star</b> systems, we have summarized classical results of incompressible ellipsoidal configurations. Recent results of compressible <b>binary</b> <b>star</b> systems obtained by the ellipsoidal approximation and by numerical computations have been shown and discussed. It {{is important to note that}} numerical computational solutions to exact equations show that compressibility may lead realistic neutron <b>star</b> <b>binary</b> system...|$|R

5|$|The post–main-sequence {{evolution}} of <b>binary</b> <b>stars</b> may be {{significantly different from}} the {{evolution of}} single stars of the same mass. If stars in a binary system are sufficiently close, when one of the stars expands to become a red giant it may overflow its Roche lobe, the region around a star where material is gravitationally bound to that star, leading to transfer of material to the other. When the Roche lobe is violated, a variety of phenomena can result, including contact binaries, common-envelope binaries, cataclysmic variables, and type Ia supernovae.|$|E
5|$|The {{two towers}} of Waterfalls {{impossible}} building are topped with compound polyhedra, one {{a compound of}} three cubes, the other a stellated rhombic dodecahedron known as Escher's solid. Escher had used this solid in his 1948 woodcut Stars, which also contains all five of the Platonic solids and various stellated solids, representing stars; the central solid is animated by chameleons climbing through the frame as it whirls in space. Escher possessed a 6cm refracting telescope and was a keen enough amateur astronomer to have recorded observations of <b>binary</b> <b>stars.</b>|$|E
5|$|Other {{factors that}} broaden the main {{sequence}} band on the HR diagram include {{uncertainty in the}} distance to stars {{and the presence of}} unresolved <b>binary</b> <b>stars</b> that can alter the observed stellar parameters. However, even perfect observation would show a fuzzy main sequence because mass is not the only parameter that affects a star's color and luminosity. Variations in chemical composition caused by the initial abundances, the star's evolutionary status, interaction with a close companion, rapid rotation, or a magnetic field can all slightly change a main-sequence star's HR diagram position, {{to name just a few}} factors. As an example, there are metal-poor stars (with a very low abundance of elements with higher atomic numbers than helium) that lie just below the main sequence and are known as subdwarfs. These stars are fusing hydrogen in their cores and so they mark the lower edge of main sequence fuzziness caused by variance in chemical composition.|$|E

40|$|A planet {{revolving}} around <b>binary</b> <b>star</b> {{system is a}} familiar system. Studies of these systems are important because they provide precise knowledge of planet formation and orbit evolution. In this study, a method to determine the evolution of an exoplanet {{revolving around}} a <b>binary</b> <b>star</b> system using different rates of stellar mass loss will be introduced. Using a hierarchical triple body system, in which the outer body can be moved with the center of mass of the inner <b>binary</b> <b>star</b> as a two-body problem, the long period evolution of the exoplanet orbit is determined depending on a Hamiltonian formulation. The model is simulated by numerical integrations of the Hamiltonian equations for the system over a long time. As a conclusion, {{the behavior of the}} planet orbital elements is quite affected by the rate of the mass loss from the accompanying <b>binary</b> <b>star...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{numerical}} method to compute quasi-equilibrium sequences of general relativistic irrotational <b>binary</b> neutron <b>star</b> systems. It {{is a good}} approximation for an inspiraling <b>binary</b> neutron <b>star</b> system just before the coalescence {{as a result of}} gravitational wave emission that (1) the <b>binary</b> <b>star</b> system is irrotational, and (2) the <b>binary</b> <b>star</b> system is in quasi-equilibrium. We can introduce the velocity potential for such irrotational flow field, which satisfies an elliptic PDE with a Neumann type boundary condition at the stellar surface. For the treatment of general relativistic gravity, we use the Wilson [...] Mathews formulation. In this formulation, the basic equations are expressed by a system of PDEs. We have developed a method to solve them with appropriate boundary conditions. We have checked the reliability of our new code by comparing our results with those of other computations available. By using this code, we have obtained quasi-equilibrium sequences of irrotational <b>binary</b> <b>star</b> systems with strong gravity as models for final states of real evolution of <b>binary</b> neutron <b>star</b> systems just before coalescence. Analysis of our quasi-equilibrium sequences of <b>binary</b> <b>star</b> systems shows that the systems may not suffer from dynamical instability of the orbital motion and that the maximum density does not increase substantially...|$|R
5|$|The first direct {{measurement}} of the distance to a star (61 Cygni at 11.4 light-years) was made in 1838 by Friedrich Bessel using the parallax technique. Parallax measurements demonstrated the vast separation of {{the stars in the}} heavens. Observation of double stars gained increasing importance during the 19th century. In 1834, Friedrich Bessel observed changes in the proper motion of the star Sirius and inferred a hidden companion. Edward Pickering discovered the first spectroscopic binary in 1899 when he observed the periodic splitting of the spectral lines of the star Mizar in a 104-day period. Detailed observations of many binary star systems were collected by astronomers such as Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve and S. W. Burnham, allowing the masses of stars to be determined from computation of orbital elements. The first {{solution to the problem of}} deriving an orbit of <b>binary</b> <b>stars</b> from telescope observations was made by Felix Savary in 1827.|$|E
5|$|The {{rotational}} {{period of}} each star {{can be measured}} by observing periodic variations in the doppler shifts of their spectral lines. The absolute rotational velocities of the two stars are known from their inclinations, rotation periods, and sizes, but the projected equatorial rotational velocities measured using doppler broadening of spectral lines are a standard measure and these are generally quoted. Capella Aa has a projected rotational velocity of 4.1±0.4 km per second, taking 104 ± 3 days to complete one rotation, while Capella Ab spins much more rapidly at 35.0±0.5 km per second, completing a full rotation in only 8.5 ± 0.2 days. Rotational braking occurs in all stars when they expand into giants, and <b>binary</b> <b>stars</b> are also tidally braked. Capella Aa has slowed until it is rotationally locked to the orbital period, although theory predicts that it should still be rotating more quickly from a starting point of a rapidly-spinning main sequence A star.|$|E
5|$|Theta Muscae is {{a triple}} star system {{thought to be}} around 7,500light-years distant. It {{consists}} of a spectroscopic binary system composed of the Wolf–Rayet star (spectral type: WC5 or 6) and an O-type main-sequence star (spectral type: O6 or O7) that orbit each other every 19 days and a blue supergiant (spectral type: O9.5/B0Iab) set about 46milliarcseconds apart from them. If the system's estimated distance from Earth is accurate, the <b>binary</b> <b>stars</b> are about 0.5astronomical units (AU) apart and the supergiant about 100AU apart from them. All three are highly luminous: combined, {{they are likely to}} be over a million times as luminous as the Sun. TU Muscae is a binary star system located around 15,500light-years away made up of two hot luminous blue main sequence stars of spectral types O7.5V and O9.5V, with masses 23 and 15times that of the Sun. The stars are so close that they are in contact with each other (overcontact binary) and are classed as a Beta Lyrae variable as their light varies from Earth as they eclipse each other. The system ranges from apparent magnitude 8.17 to 8.75 over around 1.4days.|$|E
25|$|A visual <b>binary</b> <b>star</b> is a <b>binary</b> <b>star</b> {{for which}} the angular {{separation}} between the two components is great enough to permit them to be observed as a double star in a telescope, or even high-powered binoculars. The angular resolution of the telescope {{is an important factor}} in the detection of visual binaries, and as better angular resolutions are applied to <b>binary</b> <b>star</b> observations increasing number of visual binaries will be detected. The relative brightness of the two stars is also an important factor, as glare from a bright star may make it difficult to detect the presence of a fainter component.|$|R

5|$|The NGC 4038 Group is a {{group of}} galaxies across Corvus and Crater. The group may contain between 13 and 27 galaxies. The best-known member is the Antennae {{peculiar}} galaxy, located 0.25 north of 31 Crateris. It consists of two interacting galaxies—NGC 4038 and 4039—that appear to have a heart shape as seen from Earth. The name originates from the huge tidal tails that come off the ends of the two galaxies, formed because of the spiral galaxies' original rotation. Both original galaxies were spiral galaxies and are now experiencing extensive star formation due to the interaction of gas clouds. The galaxies are 45 million light-years from Earth and each has multiple ultraluminous X-ray sources, the source of which is unknown. Astronomers theorize that they may be a rare type of x-ray emitting <b>binary</b> <b>stars</b> or intermediate-mass black holes. The Antennae Galaxies appear in a telescope at the 10th magnitude. SN 2004gt was a type Ic supernova that erupted on December 12, 2004. The progenitor was not identified from older images of the galaxy, and is either a type WC Wolf–Rayet star with a mass over 40 times that of the Sun, or a star 20 to 40 times as massive as the Sun in a binary star system. SN 2007sr was a Type Ia supernova event that peaked in brightness on December 14, 2007. The galaxy has been identified as a good place to take detailed images in case of further supernovae.|$|E
5|$|The {{star system}} is the {{prototype}} {{of a group of}} eclipsing <b>binary</b> <b>stars</b> named Algol variables, though it has a third member to make up what is actually a triple star system. The brightest component is a blue-white main-sequence star of spectral type B8V, which is 3.5 times as massive and 180 times as luminous as the Sun. The secondary component is an orange subgiant star of type K0IV that has begun cooling and expanding to 3.5 times the radius of the Sun, and has 4.5 times the luminosity and 80% of its mass. These two are separated by only 0.05 astronomical units (AU)—five percent of the distance between the Earth and Sun; the main dip in brightness arises when the larger fainter companion passes in front of the hotter brighter primary. The tertiary component is a main sequence star of type A7, which is located on average 2.69 AU from the other two stars. AG Persei is another Algol variable in Perseus, whose primary component is a B-type main sequence star with an apparent magnitude of 6.69. Phi Persei is a double star, although the two components do not eclipse each other. The primary star is a Be star of spectral type B0.5, possibly a giant star, and the secondary companion is likely a stellar remnant. The secondary has a similar spectral type to O-type subdwarfs.|$|E
25|$|<b>Binary</b> <b>stars</b> {{that are}} both visual and spectroscopic {{binaries}} are rare, and are a valuable source of information when found. About 40 are known. Visual <b>binary</b> <b>stars</b> often have large true separations, with periods measured in decades to centuries; consequently, they usually have orbital speeds {{too small to be}} measured spectroscopically. Conversely, spectroscopic <b>binary</b> <b>stars</b> move fast in their orbits because they are close together, usually too close to be detected as visual binaries.
