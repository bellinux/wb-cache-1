5|$|Around 60,000 former Czar's army troopers {{remained}} {{stationed in}} Finland in January 1918. The soldiers were demoralized and war-weary, and the home-sick, former serfs were thirsty for farmland set free by the revolutions. The {{majority of the}} troops returned to Russia {{by the end of}} March 1918. In total 7,000 to 10,000 Red Russian warmen supported the Finnish Reds, <b>but</b> <b>around</b> 4,000, in separate smaller units of 100–1,000 soldiers, could be persuaded to fight in the front line.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the reactor}} itself {{commenced}} in February 1944. Watched by Compton, Matthias, DuPont's Crawford Greenewalt, Leona Woods and Fermi, who inserted the first slug, the reactor was powered up beginning on 13 September 1944. Over {{the next few}} days, 838 tubes were loaded and the reactor went critical. Shortly after midnight on 27 September, the operators began to withdraw the control rods to initiate production. At first all appeared well <b>but</b> <b>around</b> 03:00 the power level started to drop and by 06:30 the reactor had shut down completely. The cooling water was investigated {{to see if there}} was a leak or contamination. The next day the reactor started up again, only to shut down once more.|$|E
5|$|Each {{night the}} {{positions}} of the stars appear to change as the Earth rotates. However, when a star is located along the Earth's axis of rotation, it will remain in the same position and thus is called a pole star. The direction of the Earth's axis of rotation gradually changes over time in a process known as the precession of the equinoxes. A complete precession cycle requires 25,770years, during which time the pole of the Earth's rotation follows a circular path across the celestial sphere that passes near several prominent stars. At present the pole star is Polaris, <b>but</b> <b>around</b> 12,000 BC the pole was pointed only five degrees away from Vega. Through precession, the pole will again pass near Vega around AD 14,000. It is the brightest of the successive northern pole stars.|$|E

5|$|Laid up in Trieste harbor, Italy, by the war, the Rex {{was seized}} by Nazi Germany when Italy {{surrendered}} in 1943. On September 8, 1944, she was attacked twice by Royal Air Force and South African Air Force Beaufighters. She was set on fire, then rolled over and sank after being struck by numerous rockets and cannon shells. The purpose of the attack was to prevent her from being used to block the harbor entrance. The wreck was partially scrapped in the 1950s, <b>but</b> <b>around</b> one-third of it still remains.|$|E
5|$|Many {{types of}} tear gas and other riot control agents have been {{produced}} with effects ranging from mild tearing of the eyes to immediate vomiting and prostration. CN and CS are {{the most widely used}} and known, <b>but</b> <b>around</b> 15 different types {{of tear gas}} have been developed worldwide e.g. adamsite or bromoacetone, CNB, and CNC. CS has become the most popular due to its strong effect. The effect of CS on a person will depend on whether it is packaged as a solution or used as an aerosol. The size of solution droplets {{and the size of the}} CS particulates after evaporation are factors determining its effect on the human body.|$|E
5|$|Pericles, {{following}} Athenian custom, {{was first}} married {{to one of}} his closest relatives, with whom he had two sons, Paralus and Xanthippus, <b>but</b> <b>around</b> 445BC, Pericles divorced his wife.

The name of his first wife is not known; the only information about her is that she was the wife of Hipponicus, before being married to Pericles, and the mother of Callias from this first marriage.|$|E

It is bounded on the south east by the River Irwell, which forms its boundary with the Manchester, and by the Manchester Ship Canal to the south, which forms its boundary with Trafford. The metropolitan boroughs of Wigan, Bolton and Bury lie to the west, northwest and north respectively. Some parts of the city, which lies directly west of Manchester, are highly industrialised and densely populated, <b>but</b> <b>around</b> {{one third of the}} city consists of rural open space. The western half of the city stretches across an ancient peat bog, Chat Moss.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, one IK-2 force landed due to engine failure, {{reducing the}} number of serviceable IK-2s to five. Despite deteriorating weather conditions and revolts within the Yugoslav forces, combat patrols continued. At 12:00 on 11 April, all aircraft were grounded by the weather. On 12 April, aircraft of the 4th Fighter Regiment took to the air again, chasing German reconnaissance aircraft, but the IK-2s did not record any victories. The following day, the 4th Fighter Regiment continued carrying out sorties, <b>but</b> <b>around</b> 12:00 the commander of the 2nd Mixed Air Brigade ordered the remaining aircraft of the 4th Fighter Regiment to be destroyed, and all personnel to withdraw via road to Sarajevo.|$|E

5|$|The {{incubation}} period between contraction {{and the first}} obvious symptoms of the disease is around 12 days.

In the initial growth phase the virus seems to move from cell to cell, <b>but</b> <b>around</b> the 12th day, lysis of many infected cells occurs and the virus {{is found in the}} bloodstream in large numbers (this is called viremia), and a second wave of multiplication occurs in the spleen, bone marrow, and lymph nodes.|$|E
5|$|Women also volunteered {{and served}} in a {{non-combatant}} role; {{by the end of}} the war, 80,000 had enlisted. They mostly served as nurses in the Queen Alexandra's Imperial Military Nursing Service (QAIMNS), the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry (FANY), the Voluntary Aid Detachment (VAD); and from 1917, in the Army when the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps (WAAC), was founded. The WAAC was divided into four sections: cookery; mechanical; clerical and miscellaneous. Most stayed on the Home Front, <b>but</b> <b>around</b> 9,000 served in France.|$|E
5|$|In September 1944, Fermi {{inserted}} the first uranium fuel slug into the B Reactor at the Hanford Site, the production reactor designed to breed plutonium in large quantities. Like X-10, {{it had been}} designed by Fermi's team at the Metallurgical Laboratory, and built by DuPont, but it was much larger, and was water-cooled. Over the next few days, 838 tubes were loaded, and the reactor went critical. Shortly after midnight on 27 September, the operators began to withdraw the control rods to initiate production. At first all appeared to be well, <b>but</b> <b>around</b> 03:00, the power level started to drop and by 06:30 the reactor had shut down completely. The Army and DuPont turned to Fermi's team for answers. The cooling water was investigated {{to see if there}} was a leak or contamination. The next day the reactor suddenly started up again, only to shut down once more a few hours later. The problem was traced to neutron poisoning from xenon-135, a fission product with a half-life of 9.2 hours. Fortunately, DuPont had deviated from the Metallurgical Laboratory's original design in which the reactor had 1,500 tubes arranged in a circle, and had added 504 tubes to fill in the corners. The scientists had originally considered this over-engineering a waste of time and money, but Fermi realized that by loading all 2,004 tubes, the reactor could reach the required power level and efficiently produce plutonium.|$|E

5|$|Infants {{use words}} to {{communicate}} {{early in life}} and their communication skills develop as they grow older. Communication skills aid in word learning. Infants learn to take turns while communicating with adults. While preschoolers lack precise timing and rely on obvious speaker cues, older children are more precise in their timing and take fewer long pauses. Children get better at initiating and sustaining coherent conversations as they age. Toddlers and preschoolers use strategies such as repeating and recasting their partners' utterances to keep the conversation going. Older children add new relevant information to conversations. Connectives such as then, so, and because are more frequently used as children get older. When giving and responding to feedback, preschoolers are inconsistent, <b>but</b> <b>around</b> the age of six, children can mark corrections with phrases and head nods to indicate their continued attention. As children continue to age they provide more constructive interpretations back to listeners, which helps prompt conversations.|$|E
