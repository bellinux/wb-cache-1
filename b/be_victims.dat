5|$|The {{gull-billed tern}} is an opportunist predator, taking {{a wide variety}} of prey from marine, {{freshwater}} and terrestrial habitats. Depending on what is available it will eat small crabs, fish, crayfish, grasshoppers and other large insects, lizards and amphibians. Warm-blooded prey includes mice and the eggs and chicks of other beach-breeding birds; least terns, little terns and members of its own species may <b>be</b> <b>victims.</b> The greater crested tern will also occasionally catch unusual vertebrate species such as agamid lizards and green sea turtle hatchlings, and follows trawlers for discards.|$|E

The study also found a similar increase in hate crimes against {{people who may have}} been perceived as Muslims, Arabs, and others thought to be of Middle Eastern origin. A report by the South Asian American advocacy group known as South Asian Americans Leading Together, documented media coverage of 645 bias incidents against Americans of South Asian or Middle Eastern descent between September 11 and 17. Various crimes such as vandalism, arson, assault, shootings, harassment, and threats in numerous places were documented.|$|E

The Vietnamese leader also {{had to contend with}} {{the other side of the}} arguments, from those who considered themselves to <b>be</b> <b>victims</b> of the Diệm regime. During the trial, Thích Trí Quang, along with other opponents of the old regime, lobbied for a death sentence for Cẩn. He argued that if Cẩn lived, he could regain power along with his late brothers' supporters. He told Lodge that if the Americans did not support a tough sentence, then the Vietnamese Buddhist community's opinion of Washington would fall. Lodge was initially critical of Quang's campaigning against Cẩn. Cẩn was sentenced to death. He appealed to the head of state for clemency; his lawyers used a provision in the legal code to make the appeal. This placed Minh — who was still the titular head of state — in the position of approving a third death in the Ngô family, having already ordered his bodyguard Nguyễn Văn Nhung to execute Diệm and Nhu during the coup.|$|E
5|$|Oil spills {{present a}} {{localized}} threat to otter populations, especially in coastal areas. Water pollution and other diminution of aquatic and wetland habitats may limit distribution and pose long-term threats if {{the enforcement of}} water quality standards is not upheld. Acid drainage from coal mines is a persistent water quality issue in some areas, as it eliminates otter prey. This dilemma prevents, and consequently inhibits, recolonization or growth of otter populations. Recently, long-term genetic consequences of reintroduction projects on remnant otter populations has been discussed. Similarly, many perceived threats to otters, such as pollution and habitat alterations, have not been rigorously evaluated. Little effort has gone into assessing the threat of disease to wild river otter populations, so it is poorly understood and documented. River otters may <b>be</b> <b>victims</b> of canine distemper, rabies, respiratory tract disease, and urinary infection. In addition, North American river otters can contract jaundice, hepatitis, feline panleucopenia, and pneumonia. They host numerous endoparasites, such as nematodes, cestodes, trematodes, the sporozoan Isopora, and acanthocephalans. Ectoparasites include ticks, sucking lice(Latagophthirus rauschi), and fleas (Oropsylla arctomys).|$|E
5|$|Three months later, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) shows Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) a photo taken {{moments before}} Teddy's death, {{showing that the}} balloon moved {{horizontally}} against the wind. Chuck Burks (Bill Dow), a digital photo expert, uses software to uncover evidence of electromagnetic disturbances {{in the shape of}} a child, holding the balloon. During a visit by the agents, the Holveys adamantly dispute Mulder's theory that Teddy was led onto the tracks. Scully sees Golda (Lilyan Chauvin), Maggie's elderly Romanian mother, drawing a swastika on Charlie’s hand. Scully hypothesizes that the Holvey children may <b>be</b> <b>victims</b> of Munchausen by proxy, perpetrated by their grandmother. At a meeting with Steve Holvey, he explains that Golda was against his marriage to Maggie, and that strange things began to happen when Teddy was born and Golda came to live with the family. Steve hints that Golda might be hurting Charlie, leading Scully to suggest that they visit a social worker named Karen Kosseff (Christine Willes). When preparing to leave for a session with Kosseff, Steve and Charlie get in the car but the garage sliding door seems to be malfunctioning, making Steve to step out and take a double-sided ladder to reset the sliding door's motor but in doing so, his tie is caught in the door rails with the motor suddenly starting, strangling and hanging him. Meanwhile Charlie, having been mysteriously locked in the car, starts crying over his father's death.|$|E

40|$|Currently, {{the best}} {{estimate}} of the incidence and prevalence of rape {{is provided by the}} National Violence Against Women study, published in 2000 and sponsored by the National Institute of Justice and the Centers for Disease Control 1. This study employed a sampling strategy that closely matched national demographics and found the following: • 14. 8 % of women <b>were</b> <b>victims</b> of rape at some point during their lifetime • 2. 8 % of women <b>were</b> <b>victims</b> of attempted rape at some point during their lifetime • 0. 3 % of women <b>were</b> <b>victims</b> of rape during the previous 12 months, yielding an 8. 7 per 1000 “incidence rate” Extrapolating this incidence rate to the population of Metro Boston reveals the stark disparity between “official ” rape statistics and the reality of sexual violence. In 1998, there were 1, 687 rapes reported in all of Massachusetts, and 526 arrests were made 17. That same year, among the approximately 1. 75 million women in the Boston Metro area, there were actually 15, 225 rapes. The NIJ study findings described above closely match those of the Rape in America study 2, published in 1992, which found: • 13. 0 % of women <b>were</b> <b>victims</b> of rape at some point during their lifetime • 0. 7 % of women <b>were</b> <b>victims</b> of rape during the previous 12 months Two other prevalence studies have documented even higher victimization rates, probably due to the unique characteristics of their samples.
