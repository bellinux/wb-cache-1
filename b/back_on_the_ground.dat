5|$|In {{the second}} bout, Shane Roller rebounded from three losses {{in a row}} with a {{unanimous}} decision victory over John Alessio. Roller, a former four-time Oklahoma high school state wrestling champion and a Big 12 Conference Champion at Oklahoma State University, {{was able to take}} Alessio down and control his opponent's <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> but was hurt on the feet in the first and third rounds. The three judges scored the fight 29–28 in favor of Roller.|$|E
5|$|The event's five {{preliminary}} fights {{all went}} the full three rounds, ending in decisions. In the first bout of the evening, Dan Cramer {{became the first}} fighter {{to be successful in}} a professional mixed martial arts debut at a UFC pay-per-view event since Marcio Cruz at UFC 55. In his fight with Matt Arroyo, Cramer executed a takedown and attempted punches on the ground while avoiding the Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu brown-belt's submissions during the first two rounds, while the third and final round saw Arroyo taking Cramer's <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> and unsuccessfully going for a rear naked choke. Two of the three judges scored the bout 29–28 for Cramer while the remaining third judge saw it 28–29 for Arroyo, giving Cramer the split-decision victory.|$|E
5|$|A {{pastiche}} {{of following}} scenes alternates between Spears {{dancing on the}} soundstage, singing with the microphones and a scene of just red lips, {{a reference to the}} opening shot of the 1975 film The Rocky Horror Picture Show. This begins to show her losing grip, reminiscent of her break down. When the breakdown starts, she begins to eject painting through IVs in her fingers, staining the room and the monitors, symbolizing her own fall as her name becomes tainted. Then, two versions of Spears, both wearing blue and red dresses with flowing trains, are seen fighting each other, another symbolism, this time of her fighting her inner demons. After this, both versions of Spears, as well as her on the wedding dress, fall exhausted to the ground, symbolizing the lowest point of her life during the breakdown. While interspersed scenes of Spears in the soundstage are shown, the other versions of herself start to wake up, showing her getting her feet <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> and making a comeback, refusing to give up. The final scene shows Spears dressed in a short black dress with her dancers in black on a stage, with confetti and pyrotechnics around them. In the final shot a question mark (?) appears in multicolored letters. This final scene shows her as she once was, a superstar who is back to reclaim her title. The video ends with the same multicolored lettering of a question mark, symbolizing the unknown that is to come.|$|E

5|$|In his prime, Buffon was a talented, complete, aggressive, {{and often}} instinctive goalkeeper, who was {{recognised}} for his speed, prowess, and anticipation when coming off his line in {{one on one}} situations, {{as well as his}} confidence, goalkeeping technique, reactions, and ability to get to ground quickly to collect, parry, or even challenge for the ball with his feet; when playing in teams that relied upon high defensive lines, he often functioned as a sweeper-keeper, frequently rushing out of his area to clear the ball or face opponents who had beaten the offside trap. He was also highly regarded for his handling, aerial ability, and command of the area; however, throughout his career, Buffon has occasionally been accused by pundits of being overly cautious on high balls and of not always coming out to collect crosses, and has also drawn criticism for preferring to punch the ball out to his team-mates at times rather than holding on to it. Although not as adept with the ball at his feet as the newer generation of goalkeepers that emerged in his later career, Buffon also possesses good footwork, as well as reliable distribution, which allows him to play the ball out from the <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> to his defenders and start swift counter-attacks, or find his teammates further up the pitch or out on the wing with deeper kicks with his right foot; in his youth, his ball skills occasionally led him to take on opponents, whenever he was put under pressure by on-running strikers.|$|E

The WAAF had been due to change shift, but the scheduled relief time could not take place during an operation. By 13:05 the fighters were <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> [...] Rearming and refueling began immediately to return the machines back to battle ready status as soon as possible, while the pilots wrote their combat reports which included filing claims and details of their battle {{to the best of their}} recollections.

50|$|For {{the game}} against his alma mater, Hickok {{also served as}} a referee (a common {{practice}} at the time) along with an official provided by the Yale side. In a memorable moment, the Indians appeared to have scored a late touchdown to potentially tie the game when one of their players broke free with a handoff after the team's halfback had dived into the line. However, Hickok blew his whistle to call it <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> that <b>the</b> play was dead prior to the handoff, causing his own team to protest. One newspaper covering the contest would compare his action to that of a corrupt Indian agent.|$|R
50|$|The all-enclosed pitch, {{considered}} {{to be one of}} the best in the county, was officially opened in 1957 by the then GAA President Séamus McFerran. Thus St Trea's were <b>back</b> playing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> where <b>the</b> club had its beginnings in 1944.|$|R

A few feet from him Crosby, {{extended}} on his <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> was lazily puffing rings of smoke into the still air. Both of these young gentlemen were dressed in exaggerated Mexican costumes; the silver buttons fringing the edge of Crosby's calza, open from the knee down to show {{a glimpse of the}} snowy under-trouser, were richer and heavier than those usually worn; while Brace, in addition to the crimson silk sash round his waist, wore a crimson handkerchief around his head, under his sombrero.|$|E
60|$|Corona {{moved slowly}} away, {{and as she}} walked her nature {{suggested}} that she would better eat something, so she repaired {{to the scene of}} Mrs. Perkenpine's ordinary operations. There she found that good woman stretched flat on her <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> fast asleep. Her face and body were shaded by some overhanging branches, but her great feet were illumined and gilded by the blazing sun. On a camp table near by were the remains of the breakfast. It had been there for two or three hours. Arthur Raybold had taken what he wanted and had gone, and before composing herself for her nap Mrs. Perkenpine had thrown over it a piece of mosquito-netting.|$|E
60|$|It was a trying {{moment when}} about noon {{he lifted the}} knocker to Grosvenor Square. The door was not opened rapidly, and the delay made him more nervous.

60|$|Michael was {{for growing}} restless at such searching examination, but Daughtry, {{in the midst}} of feeling out the lines and build of the thighs and hocks, paused and took Michael's tail in his magic fingers, {{exploring}} the muscles among which it rooted, pressing and prodding the adjacent spinal column from which it sprang, and twisting it about in a most daringly intimate way. And Michael was in an ecstasy, bracing his hindquarters to {{one side or the other}} against the caressing fingers. With open hands laid along his sides and partly under him, the man suddenly lifted him from the ground. But before he could feel alarm he was <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> again.|$|E
60|$|It now sank rapidly; {{and in an}} hour {{he could}} stand with his head above it. Then {{he was able to}} sit down on his bed; but when the water sank to a depth of two feet, he again lay on his back and floated. He knew that a thick deposit of mud would be left, and that it was {{essential}} for his plan that he should drift to the exit hole of the water, and there be found, with the mud and slime undisturbed by footsteps or movement. Another ten minutes, and he lay on his <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> {{in a corner of the}} dungeon to which the water had floated him, having taken care towards the end to sink his head so that his hair floated partly over it, and as the water drained off remained so. He guessed it to be about midday, and he expected to be left undisturbed until night.|$|E
60|$|A {{kind and}} cordial embrace took place betwixt the relatives; and so light was Darsie's spirit, {{that he really}} felt himself more relieved, by getting quit of the embarrassments of the last half-hour, during which he {{conceived}} himself {{in danger of being}} persecuted by the attachment of a forward girl, than disappointed by the vanishing of so many day-dreams as {{he had been in the}} habit of encouraging during the time when the green-mantled maiden was goddess of his idolatry. He had been already flung from his romantic Pegasus, and was too happy at length to find himself with bones unbroken, though with his <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> He was, besides, with all his whims and follies, a generous, kind-hearted youth, and was delighted to acknowledge so beautiful and amiable a relative, and to assure her in the warmest terms of his immediate affection and future protection, so soon as they should be extricated from their present situation. Smiles and tears mingled on Lilias's cheeks, like showers and sunshine in April weather.|$|E

60|$|I beheld a man {{extended}} flat {{upon his}} <b>back,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> and, despite the forced composure of his countenance, {{it was evident}} that he was suffering agony. His tormentor bent over him, working away {{for all the world like}} a stone-cutter with mallet and chisel. In one hand he held a short slender stick, pointed with a shark’s tooth, on the upright end of which he tapped with a small hammer-like piece of wood, thus puncturing the skin, and charging it with the colouring matter in which the instrument was dipped. A cocoa-nut shell containing this fluid was placed upon the ground. It is prepared by mixing with a vegetable juice the ashes of the “armor,” or candle-nut, always preserved for the purpose. Beside the savage, and spread out upon a piece of soiled tappa, were a great number of curious black-looking little implements of bone and wood, used in the various divisions of his art. A few terminated in a single fine point, and, like very delicate pencils, were employed in giving the finishing touches, or in operating upon the more sensitive portions of the body, as was the case of the present instance. Others presented several points distributed in a line, somewhat resembling the teeth of a saw. These were employed in the coarser parts of the work, and particularly in pricking in straight marks. Some presented their points disposed in small figures, and being placed upon the body, were, by a single blow of the hammer, made to leave their indelible impression. I observed a few, the handles of which were mysteriously curved, as if intended to be introduced into the orifice of the ear, with a view perhaps of beating the tattoo upon the tympanum. Altogether, the sight of these strange instruments recalled to mind that display of cruel-looking mother-of-pearl-handled things which one sees in their velvet-lined cases at the elbow of a dentist.|$|E

5000|$|Silva {{competed in}} Hawaii's Rumble <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Rock promotion, where he fought Yushin Okami {{in the first}} round of the 175 lb tournament. Though labeled as a {{favorite}} to win the tournament, [...] Silva was eliminated from the tournament when he kicked Okami in the face from the guard position. Okami's knees were <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> at <b>the</b> time, making the attack an illegal strike to the head of a downed opponent. Silva later said that the rule had not been properly explained to him before the bout. [...] "When I fought Okami the rules really weren't explained to me properly in the event I was fighting in," [...] said Silva. [...] "You could kick a downed opponent to the groin or to the head when your <b>back's</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> So <b>the</b> rules weren’t explained to me properly." [...] While Okami was given the opportunity to recover and continue fighting, Okami opted for the disqualification win. Silva responded by saying he [...] "felt it was a cheap, cowardly way of winning," [...] and that [...] "people that were there saw that he was in the condition to come back and keep fighting, and he didn't." ...|$|R
