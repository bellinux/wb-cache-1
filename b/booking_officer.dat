5000|$|Sears concurred {{with the}} {{majority}} in Franks v. State (1997). When a suspect was booked, the <b>booking</b> <b>officer</b> {{asked him how he}} got a bloody wound that the <b>booking</b> <b>officer</b> observed. Majority concluded this question amounted to the illicit practice of [...] "custodial interrogation" [...] and said that no exception from rules governing custodial interrogation can be made for medical questions like this at booking. Sears concluded that <b>booking</b> <b>officer</b> can ask medical questions designed to determine if suspect needs medical attention, but that this question was too broad for any [...] "medical question" [...] exception.|$|E
5000|$|Critical reevaluation of {{the film}} {{continues}} to be positive. In 1998, Maxim magazine named Slap Shot the [...] "Best Guy Movie of All Time" [...] above such acknowledged classics as The Godfather, Raging Bull, and Newman's own Cool Hand Luke (which received a backhanded tribute when Newman's character, while the Hansons were being bailed out of jail, stated to the <b>booking</b> <b>officer</b> that [...] "most folk heroes started out as criminals"). Entertainment Weekly ranked the film #31 on their list of [...] "The Top 50 Cult Films".|$|E
5000|$|According to Essam Al Humaidan, the Dubai Public Prosecutor, {{the group}} of hotel {{employees}} that intervened to prevent Brown from throwing the Nepalese maid off the balcony met [...] "violent resistance" [...] as they attempted to contain him. And according to Lieutenant General Dahi Khalfan Tamim, then the Dubai Chief of Police, Brown resisted arrest, banging his head against a wall and trying to throw himself from the hotel's balcony. [...] Police officers also testified that Brown continued to beat on the metal mesh barrier in the patrol car while he was being driven to the police station. Despite repeated claims of Brown's 'violence' nobody received or reported any injuries or other damage. Indeed, the statement of the <b>booking</b> <b>officer</b> at Bur Dubai Police Station described Brown as 'calm and in good health'.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the social network structure of <b>booking</b> <b>officers</b> at the Honolulu Police Department and how the introduction of an online discussion tool affected knowledge about operation of a booking module. Baseline data provided evidence for collaboration among officers in the same district using e-mail, telephone and face-toface media but showed minimal collaboration between officers in different districts. On average, knowledge of the booking module was low. After introduction of the online discussion tool the social network structure changed, showing an increase in collaboration between different districts {{and an increase in}} knowledge of the booking module, even though frequency of collaboration did not increase significantly. The study suggests that the formation of new collaborative ties and passive participation (“lurking”) are more significant for learning through information sharing in social networks than raw frequency of interaction. 1...|$|R
30|$|The {{various forms}} of actions at law have also been the objects of {{fruitful}} investigations in matters of infrastructure development or urban planning. The study of the practices in penal law in this field reveals the maneuvers possibilities that exist at all stages of {{the treatment of the}} offence, and the possible solutions: by the administrative authorities that detects the offence, by the prosecutor who decide to not prosecute, or by the judge who decides to pass an alternative sentence. They also highlight the diversity of the origins of the offence reports submitted to the legal system, depending on the priorities determined locally by the administrations concerned – targeted prosecution campaigns over a given period so as to solve a local problem – in a field where offences are much more often reported by <b>booking</b> <b>officers</b> than by the victims of the offences (Struillou, 2004).|$|R
40|$|Report on a {{field study}} of the {{subjective}} equivalence of shipboard accoD 1 DOdation noise and vibrations. Definition of the physical "dose" by means of ISO/R 1996 noise rating scale (NR, sound pressure level in octave bands) and of a new analogous and matched vibration rating scale (VR, acceleration, mostly at discrete frequencies), evolved from VDI 2057 K-value, Definition of the subjective "effect", viz. the annoyance judgement by experienced and responsible observers (senior deck- and engineer <b>officers,</b> <b>booking</b> <b>officers,</b> acousticians) as expressed on simple category scales. Examples of evidence that hypothesis works: useful dose-effect correlations and no contradictory results in all 85 cases available in TPD files from 14 ships for which reliable data was obtained. Conclusion that shipboard vibration problems cannot be treated adequately without {{taking into account that}} people apparently undergo noise and vibrations on board as one coherent environment agent affecting their proficiency and their satisfaction. By means of the matched NR- and VR-scales it can be found out, whether annoyance due to noise or to vibrations prevails, and which should be considered for reduction primarily...|$|R

5000|$|In 1920, Lucchese {{was arrested}} in Riverhead, Long Island on auto theft charges. During his <b>booking,</b> a police <b>officer</b> {{compared}} Lucchese's deformed hand with that of Mordecai [...] "Three Finger" [...] Brown, a popular Major League Baseball pitcher. The officer nicknamed Lucchese [...] "Three Finger Brown", an alias that Lucchese always disliked. In January 1921, Lucchese was convicted of auto theft and sentenced on March 27, 1922 to three years and nine months in prison. Lucchese served thirteen months at Sing Sing Correctional Facility before he was paroled. It would be Lucchese's only conviction.|$|R
