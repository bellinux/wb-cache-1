2500|$|Winter and his wife, Monique, live in Beverly Hills. The {{couple have}} no {{children}} and Winter stated in an interview: [...] "I {{can see how}} {{that would be a}} wonderful rewarding thing, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> enough people in the world" [...] and that [...] "It might have been more problematical if I had children with a career and all of it. I tour all the time. If I were to have children, I would want to be home all the time." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{first time}} she was asked about her mother's {{handling}} of the Lewinsky scandal at a campaign stop Clinton responded, [...] "I {{do not think that}} is any of your business." [...] As she became a more experienced campaigner, she refined her responses and deflected questions on the issue with comments such as, [...] "If that's what you want to vote on, that's what you should vote on. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> other people [...] going to vote on things like healthcare and economics." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a July 2012 {{edition of}} Sports Illustrated, Jackson talked about several issues, and also was {{critical}} of the Baseball Writers' Association of America as he believes they have lowered their standards when voting for prospects in the Hall of Fame. He has also been critical of players associated with performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs), including distant cousin Barry Bonds, stating [...] "I believe that Hank Aaron is the home run king, not Barry Bonds, as great of a player Bonds was." [...] Of Alex Rodriguez, whom Jackson has worked alongside as {{special assistant to the}} Yankees, Jackson remarked, [...] "Al's a very good friend. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> real questions about his numbers. As much as I like him, what he admitted about his usage does cloud some of his numbers." [...] On July 12, the Yankees released a statement from Jackson after the Sports Illustrated interview had been released. The press release included Jackson saying, [...] "In trying to convey my feelings about a few issues that I am passionate about, I made the mistake of naming some specific players." [...] It had been reported [...] he had been told by the Yankees to steer clear from the team, although general manager Brian Cashman stated he had not been banned but only told to not join the club on a road trip to Boston and would later be free to interact with the club. After the SI article became known and Jackson's status with the Yankees being talked about, Jackson confirmed in his statement [...] "I continue to have a strong relationship with the club, and look forward to continuing my role with the team." ...|$|E

60|$|There is an air {{of realism}} and disillusionment about this position, which makes it {{attractive}} to those idealists who wish to think themselves cynics. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> various points in which it fails to be as realistic as it pretends.|$|E
60|$|I have {{retained}} all Scott's Notes (a {{few of them}} have been somewhat abridged) and all those added by Lockhart. [1] My own I have made as concise as possible. There are, of course, many of them which many of my readers will not need, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> none that may not be of service, or at least of interest, to some of them; and I hope that no one will turn to them for help without finding it.|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't take {{particular}} notice," [...] he said, dubiously, [...] "not {{knowing the}} ways of the place. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> was a person, too, come in alonger me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Cora;--it {{certainly}} does not fret me, or I should not allow it. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> should be a limit. No man is ever rich enough to squander." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{stood up}} before the waning fire and smiled at us all. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> {{was just a little}} {{hesitation}} in his smile. [...] "If I begin--" [...] he said.|$|R

"It {{takes all}} sorts of people to make a world, as I've often heard, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> some who could be spared," [...] Anne told her {{reflection}} in the east gable mirror that night. [...] "I wouldn't have mentioned the disgraceful thing to a soul anyhow, so my conscience is clear on THAT score. I really don't know who or what is to be thanked for this. I did nothing to bring it about, and it's hard to believe that Providence ever works by means of the kind of politics men like Judson Parker and Jerry Corcoran have." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In the South the {{contempt}} for labor bred of slavery has so permeated society, {{that we see}} great, coarse, vulgar lazzaroni lying about in rags and vermin, and dependent on government rations, maintaining, as their only source of self-respect, that they never have done and never will do a stroke of useful work in all their lives. In the North there are, I believe, no men who would make such a boast; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> many women--beautiful, fascinating lazzaroni of the parlor and boudoir--who make their boast of elegant helplessness and utter incompetence for any of woman's duties with equal naïveté. The Spartans made their slaves drunk, to teach their children the evils of intoxication; {{and it seems to}} be the policy of a large class in the South now to keep down and degrade the only working class they have, for the sake of teaching their children to despise work.|$|E
6000|$|Since I {{wrote to}} you what would be called in law {{proceedings}} the exhibit marked A, I have been round to the Hôtel Brighton, and personally examined and cross-examined the attendants. It is painfully {{clear to me that}} I shall not see you to-night, nor until Tuesday, the 10th of December, when, please God, I shall re-arrive here, on my way to my Italian bowers. I mean to stay all the Wednesday and all the Thursday in Paris. One night to see you act (my old delight when you little thought of such a being in existence), and one night to read to you and Mrs. Macready (if that scamp of Lincoln's Inn Fields has not anticipated me) my little Christmas book, in which I have endeavoured to plant an indignant right-hander on the eye of certain wicked Cant that makes my blood boil, which I hope will not only cloud that eye with black and blue, but many a gentle one with crystal of the finest sort. God forgive me, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> good things in the little story! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{shall be}} glad, too, Tim. We {{have been a}} {{fortnight}} in the river already. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> is a breeze getting up, {{and there is the}} captain on deck, giving orders." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Excuse me, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> {{must be some}} mistake! We {{brought up}} your luggage with you--two trunks--in the station wagon. A man has just arrived with three more, which he says are yours." ...|$|R

60|$|I {{have not}} read through all Mr. Tennyson's poems, {{which have been}} sent to me; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> some things of a good deal of beauty in what I have seen. The misfortune is, that he has begun to write verses without very well {{understanding}} what metre is. Even if you write in a known and approved metre, the odds are, if you are not a metrist yourself, that you will not write harmonious verses; but to deal in new metres without considering what metre means and requires, is preposterous. What I would, with many wishes for success, prescribe to Tennyson,--indeed without it he can never be a poet in act,--is to write for {{the next two or three}} years in none but one or two well-known and strictly defined metres, such as the heroic couplet, the octave stanza, or the octo-syllabic measure of the Allegro and Penseroso. He would, probably, thus get imbued with a sensation, if not a sense, of metre without knowing it, just as Eton boys get to write such good Latin verses by conning Ovid and Tibullus. As it is, I can scarcely scan some of his verses.|$|E
6000|$|... 84. I {{know that}} some of you, and I believe the greater number of you, would, in such a case, spend the granted days entirely as you ought. Neither in {{numbering}} the errors, or deploring the pleasures of the past; nor in grasping at vile good in the present, nor vainly lamenting the darkness of the future; but in an instant and earnest execution of whatever it might be possible for you to accomplish in the time, in setting your affairs in order, and in providing for the future comfort, and--so far as you might by any message or record of yourself,--for the consolation, of those whom you loved, and by whom you desired to be remembered, not for your good, but for theirs. How far you might fail through human weakness, in shame for the past, despair at the little that could in the remnant of life be accomplished, or the intolerable pain of broken affection, would depend wholly on the degree in which your nature had been depressed or fortified by the manner of your past life. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> few of you who would not spend those last days better than all that had preceded them.|$|E
6000|$|... (2.) The second {{advantage}} enumerated by Adam Smith as {{arising from}} {{the division of labor}} is one on which I can not help thinking that more stress is laid by him and others than it deserves. To do full justice to his opinion, I will quote his own exposition of it: “It is impossible to pass very quickly from one kind of work to another, that is carried on in a different place, and with quite different tools. A country weaver, who cultivates a small farm, must lose {{a good deal of time}} in passing from his loom to the field, and from the field to his loom. When the two trades can be carried on in the same workhouse, the loss of time is no doubt much less. It is even in this case, however, very considerable. A man commonly saunters a little in turning his hand from one sort of employment to another.” I am very far from implying that these considerations are of no weight; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> counter-considerations which are overlooked. If one kind of muscular or mental labor is different from another, for that very reason it is to some extent a rest from that other; and if the greatest vigor is not at once obtained in the second occupation, neither could the first have been indefinitely prolonged without some relaxation of energy. It is a matter of common experience that a change of occupation will often afford relief where complete repose would otherwise be necessary, and that a person can work many more hours without fatigue at a succession of occupations, than if confined during the whole time to one.(116) Different occupations employ different muscles, or different energies of the mind, some of which rest and are refreshed while others work. Bodily labor itself rests from mental, and conversely. The variety itself has an invigorating effect on what, for want of a more philosophical appellation, we must term the animal spirits—so important to the efficiency of all work not mechanical, and not unimportant even to that.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Keith {{regarded}} him affectionately. [...] "It's yours, Dick; given without reserve. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there's</b> {{nothing more to}} be said, and no doubt you're anxious to get away. Besides, the Colonel will be expecting you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now," [...] {{the captain}} said, [...] "let us {{get up the}} sails. There is but little wind, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> is enough to give us {{steerage}} way and prevent us from drifting on to the sandbanks." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The gentleman {{certainly}} is a Jew,' said Lizzie, 'and the lady, his wife, is a Jewess, and I was first brought to their notice by a Jew. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> cannot be kinder people in the world.' ...|$|R
50|$|Years later, Bruce Beresford {{said of the}} film:I {{think there}} are a few things in it that are interesting. <b>But,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> so many things that are wrong. We never liked the script... we never really caught the {{friendship}} between David and Jonathan. There weren't enough scenes between them. And David, himself - I think Richard Gere was miscast. He is a wonderful actor but he is much better in contemporary pieces.|$|E

5000|$|Bango {{has been}} {{compared}} to Elvis Costello, a comparison he initially was uncomfortable with but has since accepted. [...] "I can see why people spot the influence <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> some others that, to me seem just as obvious. But if people hear Costello that's A OK with me. I used to get worried about that but after trying to fight it for years I just decided that he was a bona fide influence". He also acknowledges the influence of Brian Wilson, Ray Davies and Charlie Rich and Jonathan Richman.|$|E
50|$|Following {{criticisms of}} the {{measures}} proposed in the Henry Tax Review, Henry said:Whenever an idea is ventured publicly by a person, whether that person is a policy advisor or whether it's a government minister, there's at least a handful of academics who will contest it. I've seen it {{on both sides of}} politics - this is not a partisan comment at all - but for governments, government ministers who are seeking to get ideas legislated - it is unbelievably frustrating, incredibly frustrating. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> occasions on which economists might, at least for a period, put down their weapons and join a consensus.|$|E
5000|$|While it is {{uncertain}} what the song is really about (like other Bowie songs), the lyrics make oblique reference to life in post-9/11 New York City. However the video clip, directed by Brumby Boylston of National Television, tells a surreal story using lenticular-postcard-like images of a spaceship almost crashing into the modern American heartland. Bowie himself said of the song: [...] "I’m not a political commentator, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> times when I’m stretched to at least implicate what’s happening politically in the songs that I’m writing. And there was some nod, in a very abstract way, toward the wrongs {{that are being made}} at the moment with the Middle Eastern situation. I think that song is a pretty good manifesto for the whole record." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am no coward, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> is {{much more}} to be feared, Peter. The arm of the Pope is long, and the arm of the crafty Ferdinand is longer, and both of them grope for the throats and moneybags of heretics." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Perhaps you did superintend {{a little}} too much at first.

5000|$|On September 21, 2008, Collider {{published}} {{an exclusive interview}} with John Davis (the producer of both AVP films) and he stated, [...] "I think we’ve logically done what we could’ve done with the two AVP movies. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there’s</b> something to go back to with Predator." ...|$|R
