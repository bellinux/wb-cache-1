40|$|Osteosarcoma (OS) is {{the most}} common primary {{malignant}} bone tumor in adolescents and young adults. The essential mechanisms underlying osteosarcomagenesis and progression continue to be obscure. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have far-reaching effects on the cellular <b>biology</b> <b>of</b> <b>development</b> and cancer. We recently reported that unique miRNA signatures associate with the pathogenesis and progression of OS. Of particular interest, we found that higher expression of miR- 27 a is associated with clinical metastatic disease. We report here that overexpression of miR- 27 a/miR- 27 a*, a microRNA pair derived from a single precursor, promotes pulmonary OS metastases formation. By contrast, sequestering miR- 27 a/miR- 27 a* by sponge technology suppressed OS cells invasion and metastases formation. miR- 27 a/miR- 27 a* directly repressed CBFA 2 T 3 expression among other target genes. We demonstrated that CBFA 2 T 3 is downregulated in majority of OS samples and its over expression significantly attenuated OS metastatic process mediated by miR- 27 a/miR- 27 a* underscoring CBFA 2 T 3 functions as a tumor suppressor in OS.

40|$|Abstract Background The ocular {{anterior}} {{segment is}} critical for focusing incoming light onto the neural retina and for regulating intraocular pressure. It is comprised of the cornea, lens, iris, ciliary body, and highly specialized tissue at the iridocorneal angle. During development, cells from diverse embryonic lineages interact to form the anterior segment. Abnormal migration, proliferation, differentiation, or survival of these cells contribute to diseases of the anterior segment such as corneal dystrophy, lens cataract, and glaucoma. Zebrafish represent a powerful model organism for investigating the genetics and cell <b>biology</b> <b>of</b> <b>development</b> and disease. To {{lay the foundation for}} genetic studies of anterior segment development, we have described the morphogenesis of this structure in zebrafish. Results As in other vertebrates, the zebrafish anterior segment derives from diverse origins including surface ectoderm, periocular mesenchyme, and neuroepithelium. Similarly, the relative timing of tissue differentiation in the anterior segment is also conserved with other vertebrates. However, several morphogenic features of the zebrafish anterior segment differ with those of higher vertebrates. These include lens delamination as opposed to invagination, lack of iris muscles and ciliary folds, and altered organization in the iridocorneal angle. In addition, substantial dorsal-ventral differences exist within the zebrafish anterior segment. Conclusion Cumulatively, our anatomical findings provide a reference point to utilize zebrafish for genetic studies into the mechanisms of development and maintenance of the anterior segment. </p...|$|E

The difficult <b>biology</b> <b>of</b> <b>development,</b> the stenotopic character of specialized habitats and ecology predetermine {{the vulnerability of}} most orchids to anthropogenic factors. Many species of orchids in {{the conditions of the}} temperate zone are extremely vulnerable and need special protection. We have studied the location of orchids in the territory of Ust-Medveditsky natural park (UMNP) in order to identify their current state and possible ways of protection. Search and collecting orchids was carried out in the nature. During the field research conducted in 2011 - 2014 in the territory of UMNP and in its vicinities, the biotopes suitable for growth of orchids were studied. We have found 5 species of orchids (Dactylorhiza cruenta, D. incarnatа, Orchis militaris, O. palustris, Platanthera chlorantha); three more species of orchids (Epipactis helleborine, E. palustris, Platanthera bifolia) are also expected to find. These types of orchids are described for the first time. The finding of Dactylorhiza cruenta is of particular interest. The studies suggest the presence of specific habitats on the territory of Ust-Medveditsky natural park that are favorable for the growth of orchids.

40|$|The histopathologic {{heterogeneity}} {{of lung cancer}} remains a significant confounding factor in its diagnosis and prognosis-spurring numerous recent efforts to find a molecular classification of the disease that has clinical relevance. Molecular profiles of tumors from 186 patients representing four different lung cancer subtypes (and 17 normal lung tissue samples) were compared with a mouse lung development model using principal component analysis in both temporal and genomic domains. An algorithm for the classification of lung cancers using a multi-scale developmental framework was developed. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was conducted for lung adenocarcinoma patient subgroups identified via their developmental association. We found multi-scale genomic similarities between four human lung cancer subtypes and the developing mouse lung that are prognostically meaningful. Significant association was observed between the localization of human lung cancer cases along the principal mouse lung development trajectory and the corresponding patient survival rate at three distinct levels of classical histopathologic resolution: among different lung cancer subtypes, among patients within the adenocarcinoma subtype, and within the stage I adenocarcinoma subclass. The earlier the genomic association between a human tumor profile and the mouse lung development sequence, the poorer the patient's prognosis. Furthermore, decomposing this principal lung development trajectory identified a gene set that was significantly enriched for pyrimidine metabolism and cell-adhesion functions specific to lung development and oncogenesis. From a multi-scale disease modeling perspective, the molecular dynamics of murine lung development provide an effective framework {{that is not only}} data driven but also informed by the <b>biology</b> <b>of</b> <b>development</b> for elucidating the mechanisms of human lung cancer biology and its clinical outcome...|$|E

40|$|Osteosarcoma {{remains a}} {{leading cause of}} cancer death in adolescents. Treatment {{paradigms}} and survival rates have not improved in two decades. Driving the lack of therapeutic inroads, the molecular etiology of osteosarcoma remains elusive. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have demonstrated far-reaching effects on the cellular <b>biology</b> <b>of</b> <b>development</b> and cancer. Their role in osteosarcomagenesis remains largely unexplored. Here we identify for the first time an miRNA signature reflecting the pathogenesis of osteosarcoma from surgically procured samples from human patients. The signature includes high expression of miR- 181 a,miR- 181 b, and miR- 181 c as well as reduced expression of miR- 16, miR- 29 b, and miR- 142 - 5 p. We also demonstrate that miR- 181 b and miR- 29 b exhibit restricted expression to distinct cell populations in the tumor tissue. Further, higher expression of miR- 27 a and miR- 181 c* in pre-treatment biopsy samples characterized patients who developed clinical metastatic disease. In addition, higher expression of miR- 451 and miR- 15 b in pre-treatment samples correlated with subsequent positive response to chemotherapy. In vitro and in vivo functional validation in osteosarcoma cell lines confirmed the tumor suppressive role of miR- 16 and the pro-metastatic role of miR- 27 a. Furthermore, predicted target genes for miR- 16 and miR- 27 a were confirmed as down-regulated by real-time PCR. Affymetrix array profiling of cDNAs from the osteosarcoma specimens and controls were interrogated according to predicted targets of miR- 16, miR 142 - 5 p, miR- 29 b, miR- 181 a/b, and miR- 27 a. This analysis revealed positive and negative correlations highlighting pathways of known importance to osteosarcoma, as well as novel genes. Thus, our findings establish a miRNA signature associated with pathogenesis of osteosarcoma as well as critical pre-treatment biomarkers of metastasis and responsiveness to therapy.

40|$|In organisms, tissue {{development}} and maintenance must be precisely timed and spatially coordinated to ensure proper form and function. This {{can be difficult}} both to develop and to maintain in the complex environments present in organisms, and thus a mechanism that can be finely tuned and regulated must be present. Therefore, when studying the underlying principles of morphogenesis, {{it is important to}} consider the crucial biochemical, cellular, and tissue scales simultaneously. This creates a need for a mathematical and computational approach to understanding the complex <b>biology</b> <b>of</b> <b>development.</b> One way of achieving a high level of precision of control is through stem cell lineages. These lineages employ the use of stem cells and their progeny to maintain certain properties necessary for proper tissue function. One such system is found in the stratified inter-follicular epidermis. Here, we develop and use a two dimensional, multi-scale, cell lineage model to explore the molecular, cellular, and physical properties of healthy and diseased epidermis. The model recapitulates a variety of healthy epithelial tissue shapes, including the formation and maintenance of undulating structures, known as rete-ridges. We find that the dermis compliance and the cell-cell adhesion at the dermis-epidermis junction, in conjunction with internal physical pressures due to cell lineage dynamics, play an important role in the tissue morphology. We explore these dynamics to get a better understanding of morphological changes found in diseased skin, including thickening of the tissue and deformation of rete-ridges. Another system in which the molecular mechanisms and cell dynamics driving morphogenesis remains unclear is in diversification of feather vane shapes. Here, we integrate a two dimensional, multi modular mathematical model with transcriptome profiling to elucidate the anisotropic signaling modules which break symmetry, alter cell shape, and generate diverse feather shapes.
