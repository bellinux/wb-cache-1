5|$|By {{the terms}} of his parole, Mallory was not {{permitted}} to hold public office, so he made a living by reopening his old law practice. Nominally excluded from politics, he managed to make his views known by writing letters and editorials for Florida newspapers. At first he urged acceptance of the reconstituted Union and acquiescence in the policies of Reconstruction, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>soon</b> came out in opposition, particularly against black suffrage.|$|E
5|$|In April 1917, Speirs {{took part}} in the Second Battle of Arras, for which he was awarded the Military Medal for bravery in May 1917, before he was {{promoted}} to Sergeant in June. The following month, he returned home to Scotland on leave, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>soon</b> returned to France and was killed during the Battle of Passchendaele on or about 20 August 1917, aged 31. He is buried at , near Ypres in Belgium.|$|E
5|$|Archer {{requests}} {{the coordinates}} of Xindus, the Xindi homeworld, from Kessick. But the alien refuses to help unless Archer helps him escape. Archer declines, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>soon</b> learns that the foreman had ulterior motives, {{since he has}} ordered three warships to overpower Enterprise and enslave his crew. Kessick claims {{to know how to}} escape the mine, but asks for Archer's help in return for guiding the Starfleet officers. Archer reluctantly agrees, and Kessick leads him and Tucker through the mine's sewage removal system. However, the group is soon detected in a conduit, and the foreman floods the system with plasma in an effort to kill them. They narrowly escape being killed, but quickly {{fall into the hands of}} the mine's security forces.|$|E
50|$|Rainey is {{maintaining}} a gap, and Gardner {{makes a mistake}} at the chicane and lets Sarron and Mackenzie through, <b>but</b> <b>he’s</b> <b>soon</b> back to 2nd. Mamola is sliding the rear and waving to the crowd.|$|R
50|$|In 1914, {{he joined}} the French Foreign Legion, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> was <b>soon</b> {{released}} on medical discharge.|$|R
50|$|In 1948, McCune was {{promoted}} to associate {{professor of history at}} Berkeley, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> died <b>soon</b> afterward.|$|R
5|$|Burnham {{eventually}} {{went back}} to California to attend high school, but he never graduated. He returned to Arizona and was appointed Deputy Sheriff of Pinal County, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>soon</b> {{went back to}} herding cattle and prospecting. After he went to Prescott, Iowa to visit his childhood sweetheart Blanche, the two were married on February 6, 1884. He was 23 years old. He and Blanche settled down soon after in Pasadena, California, to tend to an orange grove but soon Burnham returned to prospecting and scouting. Active as a Freemason, he rose to become a Thirty-Second Degree Mason of the Scottish Rite.|$|E
5|$|Carte {{started his}} career working for his father, Richard Carte, in the music {{publishing}} and musical instrument manufacturing business. As a young man, he conducted and composed music, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>soon</b> turned to promoting the entertainment careers of others through his management agency. Carte believed that a school of wholesome, well-crafted, family-friendly, English comic opera could be as popular as the risqué French works dominating the London musical stage in the 1870s. To that end, he brought together the dramatist W. S. Gilbert and composer Arthur Sullivan and, together with his wife Helen Carte, he nurtured their collaboration {{on a series of}} thirteen Savoy operas. He founded the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company and built the state-of-the-art Savoy Theatre to host the Gilbert and Sullivan operas.|$|E
5|$|Conscription was {{introduced}} in Canada during {{the final years of}} the war, which was accompanied by labour shortages, pressures for social change, and the rapid unionisation of the remaining workforce. While concerns about the Central Powers declined, fears grew in government at the end of 1918 that the new Bolshevik government in Russia might be covertly orchestrating a campaign of strikes across Canada. In response the Prime Minister, Robert Borden, created a Public Safety Branch led by the politician Charles Cahan. Cahan envisaged transforming this organisation into a much larger secret service, similar to the Bureau of Investigation in the United States, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>soon</b> fell out with Borden and ultimately resigned.|$|E
50|$|Charles Patrick's brother James was {{originally}} a member, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> left <b>soon</b> after the group's formation. John Ryanes and Warren Ryanes were also brothers.|$|R
50|$|A mysterious {{doctor who}} {{previously}} caused a car accident, killing his girlfriend Ellen. He {{was charged with}} murder, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> was <b>soon</b> released from prison.|$|R
50|$|Silumelume {{was in fact}} {{chosen by}} the nation's council, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> was <b>soon</b> assassinated, perhaps on the {{instructions}} of his brother, who thereupon succeeded him.|$|R
5|$|Keynes was {{ultimately}} a successful investor, {{building up a}} private fortune. His assets were nearly wiped out following the Wall Street Crash of 1929, {{which he did not}} foresee, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>soon</b> recouped. At Keynes's death, in 1946, his net worth stood just short of £500,000 – equivalent to about £11 million ($16.5 million) in 2009. The sum had been amassed despite lavish support for various good causes and his personal ethic which made him reluctant to sell on a falling market, in cases where he saw such behaviour as likely to deepen a slump.|$|E
5|$|Riku Seya, usually {{referred}} to by his surname, is a classmate of Maho's who meets her when they enter junior high school. He is generally a soft-spoken boy who initially takes an interest in Shuichi, whom he believes to be a girl, when they first meet. When he learns that Shuichi is assigned male, Seya becomes angry at Maho for hiding this and stringing him along, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>soon</b> reconciles with her and eventually starts dating her. Seya remains polite with Shuichi, though due to their initial meeting, there is always some awkwardness between the two.|$|E
5|$|Terry George was {{the first}} {{director}} to join the project, and he also did some revisions to the script, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>soon</b> left the project. Peter Berg was the next director to consider, but he too, eventually dropped out for undisclosed reasons. A year later {{it was confirmed that}} Phillip Noyce would direct. Noyce was attracted to Salt for its espionage themes, which are present in most of his filmography, as well as the tension of a character who tries to prove his innocence yet also does what he was previously accused of.|$|E
60|$|Then Gerda {{told her}} everything, {{and asked her}} if she had seen Kay. <b>But</b> she said <b>he</b> had not passed that way yet, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> would <b>soon</b> come.|$|R
50|$|He {{started his}} career as a striker, <b>but</b> <b>soon</b> <b>he</b> changed his {{position}} as a goalkeeper, same as his father played. He {{started his career}} with Dacia Unirea Brăila's youth, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> transferred <b>soon</b> to a Divizia A team, because he was a talented young goalkeeper. He spelled three years in Bucureşti, with a short spell at Metalul Plopeni in 2001, when he was loaned from Rocar.|$|R
50|$|After the Battle of St. Quentin (1557), he {{was charged}} with {{reinforcing}} the city's defences, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> died <b>soon</b> after from his wounds received in the battle.|$|R
5|$|Throughout Edwards' three {{terms as}} governor, he showed a {{willingness}} to surrender his own considerable powers in order to expand participatory government in the Illinois Territory. Before 1812, while Illinois had a first-grade territorial status, Edwards had vast powers to appoint county and local officials; however, he made it his practice to consider local opinion {{as much as he}} could when making appointments, often giving weight to petitions signed by local residents. He attempted to do the same for militia officers for a time, letting the men of a unit elect their leaders, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>soon</b> abandoned this policy as impractical.|$|E
5|$|When Picard {{returns to}} the Enterprise, he discovers that {{survivors}} from the Borg sphere have invaded the ship and are beginning to assimilate both the Enterprise and its crew. Once they have assimilated the ship, the Borg plan {{to use it to}} attack and conquer Earth. Picard and a team attempt to reach engineering to disable the Borg with corrosive coolant used in the warp core. The assault fails and Data is captured; he meets the Queen of the Borg Collective, who attempts to turn him to her side. A frightened Sloane ambushes the captain, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>soon</b> gains her trust and they escape the Borg-infested area of the ship by using the holodeck to create a weapon.|$|E
5|$|After the United States {{commenced}} hostilities against Germany in April 1917, Krueger {{was assigned}} to the 84th Infantry Division at Camp Zachary Taylor as its Assistant Chief of Staff G-3 (Operations). He became its chief of staff, with the rank of major as of 5 August 1917. In February 1918, he was sent to Langres, France, to attend the American Expeditionary Force General Staff School. All officers from divisions that were not under orders for France were ordered to return home in May 1918, but Krueger stayed on as G-3 of the 26th Infantry Division. The French Army requested that Krueger be sent home due to his German origin, and Krueger was re-posted to the 84th Division, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>soon</b> returned to France, as the 84th Division embarked for France in August 1918. In October, he became {{chief of staff of the}} Tank Corps. After the Armistice with Germany ended the fighting in November 1918, he became assistant chief of staff of VI and IV Corps on occupation duty, advancing to the rank of temporary colonel. For his service in the war, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal in 1919.|$|E
50|$|Suolahti, a huge {{admirer of}} Richard Wagner, was promised {{a trip to}} the Bayreuth Festival in the summer of 1937, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> died <b>soon</b> after Christmas 1936.|$|R
50|$|Vorovsky {{returned}} to Russia in 1915, landing in Petrograd — the new name of St. Petersburg — <b>but</b> <b>he</b> was <b>soon</b> sent to Stockholm by a business firm.|$|R
50|$|In 1702, {{after the}} death of Jean Bart, he was {{appointed}} head of the Dunkirkers, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> was <b>soon</b> replaced by Marc-Antoine de Saint-Pol Hécourt for lack of initiative.|$|R
5|$|Being ambitious, Grill {{aimed for}} the higher {{positions}} in the SOIC, and to achieve {{that he had to}} learn more and gain more experience. So when he returned to Sweden from China, he decided to go abroad again as soon as possible. He started out at the trading office of Kristian Holm, Swedish consul to France, in Montpellier where he worked for about six months. He stayed in France for five years, and in 1758, he was employed by the Mallet & Blancheney firm in Marseille. Grill's letters to his family during those years indicates that he enjoyed his time in France and was interested in style and his own appearance. His initial plans had been to set up a business in Marseille, but his family, especially his uncle Claes Grill, advised against it. Claes had started out as a merchant in the European market, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>soon</b> moved on to the more lucrative Canton trade and encouraged his nephew to do the same.|$|E
5|$|Boulding {{started the}} first game of his second season with Bradford City, which ended with City losing 5–0 to Notts County, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>soon</b> lost his place to new signings Gareth Evans and James Hanson and so had to wait another seven weeks for his second start which came against Northampton Town because Evans was suspended. He scored his first goal of the season in the game to give City a 2–0 lead, but his side conceded twice for the game to finish in a 2–2 draw. He scored in the club's {{following}} two games, but was then kept out of the side for two weeks by a virus. Upon his return, he scored his 100thcareer goal and his fourth goal in five games as a late consolation in an FA Cup defeat to Notts County. However, Boulding continued to struggle to maintain a first-team place and was released early from his contract in March 2010, along with his brother under mutual consent, after failing to make a single start under new manager Peter Taylor. He had played 71 games at City, although nearly one-third were as substitute, and scored 19 goals.|$|E
5|$|Henry's {{government}} relied {{primarily on}} Eleanor and her Savoyard supporters, and it proved short-lived. He attempted {{to settle the}} crisis permanently by forcing the barons {{to agree to the}} Treaty of Kingston. This treaty introduced a system of arbitration to settle outstanding disputes between the King and the barons, using Richard as an initial adjudicator, backed up by Louis of France should Richard fail to generate a compromise. Henry softened some of his policies in response to the concerns of the barons, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>soon</b> began to target his political enemies and recommence his unpopular Sicilian policy. Henry's government was weakened by the death of de Clare, as his heir, Gilbert, sided with the radicals; the King's position was further undermined by major Welsh incursions along the Marches and the Pope's decision to reverse his judgement on the Provisions, this time confirming them as legitimate. By early 1263, Henry's authority had disintegrated and the country slipped back towards open civil war.|$|E
6000|$|He {{seemed to}} look {{about for a}} use <b>he</b> could name; <b>but</b> <b>he</b> had <b>soon</b> given it up. [...] "She must die, my dear, in her own {{extraordinary}} way." ...|$|R

50|$|Coventry City signed Marsh for £450,000 on 30 December 1994 <b>but</b> <b>he</b> was <b>soon</b> on {{the move}} again after just {{nineteen}} games and two goals in six months at Highfield Road.|$|R
5|$|Leeds {{finished}} {{just five}} points above the Second Division relegation {{zone in the}} 1960–61 season and Taylor resigned; his replacement, Don Revie, was promoted from the United first team, and initially he was not fond of Charlton. Revie played Charlton up front {{at the start of}} the 1961–62 season, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>soon</b> moved him back to centre-half after he proved ineffective as a centre-forward. He soon became frustrated and difficult to manage, feeling in limbo playing for a club seemingly going nowhere whilst his younger brother was enjoying great success at Manchester United. Revie told Charlton that he was prepared to let him go in 1962, but never actually transfer listed him. Liverpool manager Bill Shankly failed to meet the £30,000 Leeds demanded for Charlton and though Manchester United manager Matt Busby was initially willing to pay the fee he eventually decided to instead try an untested youngster at centre-half. During these discussions Charlton refused to sign a new contract at Leeds, but felt frustrated by Busby's hesitance and so signed a new contract with Leeds whilst making a promise to Revie to be more professional in his approach.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of September 18, 1964, Kinne left the hotel without Pugliese, either to acquire money because the couple was running low or to get {{medicine}} she required. Kinne encountered Francisco Parades Ordoñez, a Mexican-born American citizen, at a bar that night and accompanied {{him back to his}} room in Hotel La Vada. According to Kinne's account, she went with Ordoñez to see photographs he offered to show her, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>soon</b> began to make sexual advances toward her and she was forced to fire her gun at him in an attempt to protect herself. Kinne maintained later that she had had no intention of killing or harming Ordoñez, and had intended only to frighten him, but her bullets struck him in the chest and killed him. Responding to the sound of gunfire, hotel employee Enrique Martinez Rueda entered the room. Kinne fired again and hit Rueda in the shoulder. Wounded, Rueda fled the room, locking Kinne inside, and called the police.|$|E
5|$|The Wild Flower and the Rose is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film focuses on Frank Wilson, {{the son of an}} inventor who has constructed a new airplane model. After failing to secure financing, his father suggests that he marry Rose, the daughter of his wealthy employer, to get the money they need. Jack rejects this idea because he is engaged to another woman, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>soon</b> learns she does not love him. He heads out West to seek a fortune and is quickly successful. He returns to the aviation field and meets Rose again, after a successful flight she confesses to loving him. The cast and staff credits are unknown, but the film may have included scenes from the 1910 International Aviation Meet at Belmont Park. One reviewer claimed that a Wright brothers flyer was also shown in full flight. The film was released on November 25, 1910, but is now presumed lost.|$|E
