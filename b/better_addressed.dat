25|$|Under such {{demands for}} the aircraft, {{in order that}} {{production}} shortcomings could be <b>better</b> <b>addressed,</b> along with the parallel pressure that Hawker was facing {{on the development of}} another aircraft, the newer Hunter, it was decided that production would be transferred to a new assembly line ran by Armstrong Whitworth Aircraft, which were a part of the Hawker group, at Coventry. Prior to the transfer, a total of 35 Sea Hawk F1, the initial production standard, were completed at Kingston. On 14 November 1951, the first production Sea Hawk F1, WF143, conducted its maiden flight. It possessed a 39ft (12m) wingspan and a tailplane of increased area. The first Coventry-built Sea Hawk F1 made its first flight prior to the end of 1953; a total of 60 would be produced.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the closing}} paragraph, he conceded {{one of the}} plaintiffs' arguments, that a ruling in First of Omaha's favor would make it {{difficult}} or impossible for states to enforce their anti-usury laws. But, he said, {{that had been the}} case since the National Banking Act was passed. [...] "This impairment may in fact be accentuated by the ease with which interstate credit is available by mail through the use of modern credit cards," [...] he allowed. [...] "But the protection of state usury laws is an issue of legislative policy, and any plea to alter [...] to further that end is <b>better</b> <b>addressed</b> to the wisdom of Congress than to the judgment of this Court." ...|$|E

60|$|Never {{had it been}} so {{plain to}} Mr. Britling {{that he was a}} weak, silly, ill-informed and hasty-minded writer, and never had he felt so invincible a {{conviction}} that the Spirit of God was in him, and that it fell to him to take some part in the establishment of a new order of living upon the earth; it might be the most trivial part by the scale of the task, but for him it was to be now his supreme concern. And it was an almost intolerable grief to him that his services should be, for all his desire, so poor in quality, so weak in conception. Always he seemed {{to be on the verge}} of some illuminating and beautiful statement of his cause; always he was finding his writing inadequate, a thin treachery to the impulse of his heart, always he was finding his effort weak and ineffective. In this instance, at the outset he seemed to see with a golden clearness the message of brotherhood, or forgiveness, of a common call. To whom could such a message be <b>better</b> <b>addressed</b> than to those sorrowing parents; from whom could it come with a better effect than from himself? And now he read what he had made of this message. It seemed to his jaded mind a pitifully jaded effort. It had no light, it had no depth. It was like the disquisition of a debating society.|$|E
6000|$|Not that I {{have any}} curiosity to hear {{powerful}} preachers. Time was, when I was dragged {{by the hair}} of my head, as one may say, to hear too many. On summer evenings, when every flower, and tree, and bird, might have <b>better</b> <b>addressed</b> my soft young heart, I have in my day {{been caught in the}} palm of a female hand by the crown, have been violently scrubbed from the neck to the roots of the hair as a purification for the Temple, and have then been carried off highly charged with saponaceous electricity, to be steamed like a potato in the unventilated breath of the powerful Boanerges Boiler and his congregation, until what small mind I had, was quite steamed out of me. In which pitiable plight I have been haled out of the place of meeting, {{at the conclusion of the}} exercises, and catechised respecting Boanerges Boiler, his fifthly, his sixthly, and his seventhly, until I have regarded that reverend person in the light of a most dismal and oppressive Charade. Time was, when I was carried off to platform assemblages at which no human child, whether of wrath or grace, could possibly keep its eyes open, and when I felt the fatal sleep stealing, stealing over me, and when I gradually heard the orator in possession, spinning and humming like a great top, until he rolled, collapsed, and tumbled over, and I discovered to my burning shame and fear, that as to that last stage it was not he, but I. I have sat under Boanerges when he has specifically addressed himself to us--us, the infants--and at this present writing I hear his lumbering jocularity (which never amused us, though we basely pretended that it did), and I behold his big round face, and I look up the inside of his outstretched coat- sleeve as if it were a telescope with the stopper on, and I hate him with an unwholesome hatred for two hours. Through such means did it come to pass that I knew the powerful preacher from beginning to end, all over and all through, while I was very young, and that I left him behind at an early period of life. Peace be with him! More peace than he brought to me! ...|$|E
