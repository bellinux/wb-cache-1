Blondel demonstrates that a mathematical proof of Galileo, allowing the cross-section of a beam to be parabolically shaped such that its weight was reduced by one third, only applied to cantilevered beams and did not apply to the specified aim, a beam supported at both ends, for which a semicircular or elliptical shape would apply. Some of these questions were taken up again in 1673, when he published his Résolution des quatre principaux problèmes d'Architecture.|$|E

Rice cultivars were Kadus, Khazar, Gohar, Dorfak, Sepidrood and Deylam and local rice cultivar (Hashemi; susceptible to lodging as a control). Plant height, stem length, internode length for the first, second, third and fourth internodes, diameter, thickness and cross- section area of third and fourth internodes, ratio of fresh weight and dry weight of third and fourth internodes to internode length, <b>breaking</b> <b>resistance,</b> bending moment and lodging resistance of third and fourth internodes and pushing resistance were examined. Khazar cultivar with greater thickness of third and fourth internodes (4. 11 and 4. 26 mm), diameter of third and fourth internodes (8. 33 and 9. 46 mm), cross- section area of the third and fourth internodes (40. 96 and 52. 32 mm 2) and ratio of fresh weight of third and fourth internodes to internode length (301. 48 and 444. 15 mg. cm- 1) and ratio of dry weight of third and fourth internodes to internode length (49. 46 and 50. 38 mg. cm- 1), <b>breaking</b> <b>resistance</b> of the third and fourth internodes (14. 43 and 20. 87 N, respectively) was found to be the most resistant cultivar.

Considering the strong correlation found between thickness, stem diameter, cross- section area of third and fourth internodes and ratio of fresh weight and dry weight of third and fourth internodes to internode length with <b>breaking</b> <b>resistance</b> and pushing resistance, it seems that these traits could be considered as indirect indices in selection for higher resistance of rice cultivars to lodging...|$|E

At 42 days of age, 50 birds were sacrificed for tibia analyses. There was no effect (P > 0. 05) of positive control x factorial or MOS x enzyme interactions on P and mineral matter levels, length and distal epiphysis density.

40|$|Silicon is {{considered}} {{as an important}} beneficial element for rice production as rice requires large amounts silicon for its growth. The problem of lodging is a major constraint in rice production, especially in high yielding environments. The effects of silicon on the growth of rice plants in hydroponic culture were tested in 2006 at the greenhouse of the Rice Research Institute of Iran (Amol). Treatments for the experiment were arranged in a factorial randomized complete design with nitrogen fertilizer (40 and 80 ppm), and silicon (0, 50, and 100 ppm), with four replicates. A high yielding Iranian rice variety Nemat, {{was used in the}} experiment. Measurements were taken for plant height, internode length, fresh weight, total dry weight, <b>breaking</b> <b>resistance,</b> bending moment, lodging index, column thickness and silicon and nitrogen concentrations of rice plant parts. Results showed that silicon concentration in roots, stems, green leaves and panicles increased under applications of silicon. Silicon concentration in plant parts decreased under increased nitrogen concentration in the cultural solution. Silicon had positive effects on plant height, internode length, fresh weight, <b>breaking</b> <b>resistance,</b> bending moment, culm thickness, roots, stems, green leaves and total dry weight. However the lodging index reduced under silicon treatment compared to the control. Deposits of Si in the form of silica gel reportedly serve to stiffen the stems and leaves of cereals.

However, oral viable leucocytes, obtained via mouth washes, might serve as a non-invasive alternative for the comet assay (Osswald et al., 2003). During a cross-sectional human study, comet assay of oral leucocytes in addition to PBMC and whole blood was performed. In total 146 female patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 donated oral leucocytes. Therefore, they rinsed their mouth with tap water which than was added to a sodium chloride solution. After washing the cells, the separation of oral leucocytes and buccal cells was performed with density gradient centrifugation. Oral leucocytes were counted and comet assay (strand <b>breaks,</b> <b>resistance</b> to H 2 O 2, FPG-sensitive sites) was performed. Cell counts of oral leucocytes differed substantially and therefore are the limiting step. Only 110 patients (75 %) donated enough cells to perform the Comet assay.

The aim of this thesis is to perform a sensitivity analysis of chosen ice resistance prediction methods with regard to the bow shape and thus identify the effect of the bow geometry on the <b>breaking</b> <b>resistance.</b> The desired bow shapes are generated through a parametric 3 D model developed in MATLAB. The parametric 3 D model is built up by a "bow skeleton" which consists of a mesh grid with connected control points that depend on bow length, ship beam, ice thickness and five angles describing the bow shape. To obtain a 3 D bow shape, a surface was added made up by non-uniform rational basis splines. By adjusting the control points, a desired bow shape can be generated.
