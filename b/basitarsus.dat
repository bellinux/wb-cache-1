25|$|The tarsus {{of insects}} {{corresponds}} to the penultimate segment of a generalized arthropod limb, which is the segment called the propodite in Crustacea. adult insects it is commonly subdivided into from two to five subsegments, or tarsomeres, but in the Protura, some Collembola, and most holometabolous insect larvae it preserves the primitive form of a simple segment. The subsegments of the adult insect tarsus are usually freely movable on one another by inflected connecting membranes, but the tarsus never has intrinsic muscles. The tarsus of adult pterygote insects having fewer than five subsegments is probably specialized {{by the loss of}} one or more subsegments or by a fusion of adjoining subsegments. In the tarsi of Acrididae the long basal piece is evidently composed of three united tarsomeres, leaving the fourth and the fifth. The basal tarsomere is sometimes conspicuously enlarged and is distinguished as the <b>basitarsus.</b> On the under surfaces of the tarsal subsegments in certain Orthoptera there are small pads, the tarsal pulvilli, or euplantulae. The tarsus is occasionally fused with the tibia in larval insects, forming a tibiotarsal segment; in some cases it appears to be eliminated or reduced to a rudiment between the tibia and the pretarsus.|$|E
500|$|The {{ancestors}} of bees were wasps {{in the family}} Crabronidae, which were predators of other insects. The switch from insect prey to pollen may have resulted from the consumption of prey insects which were flower visitors and were partially covered with pollen when they were fed to the wasp larvae. This same evolutionary scenario may have occurred within the vespoid wasps, where the pollen wasps evolved from predatory ancestors. Until recently, the oldest non-compression bee fossil {{had been found in}} New Jersey amber, Cretotrigona prisca of Cretaceous age, a corbiculate bee. A bee fossil from the early Cretaceous (~100 mya), Melittosphex burmensis, is considered [...] "an extinct lineage of pollen-collecting Apoidea sister to the modern bees". Derived features of its morphology (apomorphies) place it clearly within the bees, but it retains two unmodified ancestral traits (plesiomorphies) of the legs (two mid-tibial spurs, and a slender hind <b>basitarsus),</b> showing its transitional status. By the Eocene (~45 mya) there was already considerable diversity among eusocial bee lineages.|$|E
50|$|Bombus vosnesenskii has {{a number}} of {{distinctive}} features. These include short, even hair, the rounded angle of the <b>basitarsus,</b> which is the middle leg, and a square face. Additionally, the fringed hair of its hind legs forms the corbicula, or pollen basket.|$|E
50|$|They are bees of {{moderate}} size, generally 8 to 15 mm long. They are commonly oligolectic, with narrow host plant preferences. They resemble bees {{of the genus}} Andrena, though with radically different mouthparts and a scopa limited to the hind tibia and <b>basitarsus.</b>|$|E
50|$|Arachnid legs {{differ from}} those of insects by the {{addition}} of two segments {{on either side of the}} tibia, the patella between the femur and the tibia, and the metatarsus (sometimes called <b>basitarsus)</b> between the tibia and the tarsus (sometimes called telotarsus), making a total of seven segments.|$|E
5000|$|Bombus eximius is a {{very large}} species of bumblebee. The queens are 28-29 mm (29 mm) long, while the female workers are 14 - 19 mm and the male workers 18 - 19 mm. The color of the hair on the thorax is black, and that on the mid and hind tibiae and the <b>basitarsus</b> is orange. The bright {{coloration}} has also been described as [...] "yellowish red" [...] (via gelblichrot).|$|E
50|$|A. florea {{is called}} the dwarf honey bee due to its small size {{compared}} to other honeybees. A worker is typically 7-10 mm in body length and its overall coloration is red-brown. A colony builds a single, exposed comb usually on tree branches or shrubs. A. florea produce honey that is harvested and eaten in Thailand and Cambodia. They are excellent pollinators, which gives them an important ecological role in the places they inhabit. Drones carry a thumb-like bifurcation called the <b>basitarsus,</b> which is located two-thirds {{along the length of}} the tibia. The fimbriate lobe of A. florea has three protrusions and they sting using two stylet barbs.|$|E

40|$|The tribe Hilarini (Diptera: Empididae), {{commonly}} known as dance flies, can be recognised by their swollen silk-producing prothoracic <b>basitarsus,</b> a male secondary sexual characteristic. The ultrastructure and function of the silk-producing <b>basitarsus</b> from one undescribed morphospecies of Hilarini, 2 ̆ 7 Hilarempis 202 ̆ 7, is presented. Male H. 20 collect small parcels of diatomaceous algae {{from the surface of}} freshwater creeks that they bind with silk produced by the gland in the <b>basitarsus.</b> The gift is then presented to females in a nearby swarm, composed predominately of females. The <b>basitarsus</b> houses approximately 12 pairs of class III dermal glandular units that congregate on the ventral side of the cavity. Each gland cell has a large extracellular lumen where secretion accumulates. The lumen drains to the outside via a conducting canal encompassed by a canal cell and a duct extending through the shaft of a specialised secretory spine. The secretory spines lie in pairs in a ventral groove that runs the length of the <b>basitarsus.</b> A comparison of the basitarsal secretory spines with sensilla on the basitarsi of non gland-bearing legs of males, and with non gland-bearing prothoracic. basitarsi of females, suggests that the glandular units are derived from contact chemosensory sensilla.

40|$|To {{identify}} the sensory organs that {{are sensitive to}} water stimuli in the cricket Gryllus bimaculatus, cuticular structures on the legs {{and the number of}} sensory neurons innervating them were studied. Some small hair sensilla on the legs were innervated by 2 – 5 sensory neurons. All such sensilla had a tiny pore at the tip of their hairs. The diameter of the pore was approximately 0. 2 μm. These findings suggest that these are chemosensitive hairs (LCS: leg chemosensillum). Of the three pairs of legs, the anterior legs (forelegs) possessed the largest number of LCSs. Of the five leg segments (i. e., coxa, trochanter, femur, tibia and tarsus), the tarsus possessed the largest number of LCSs on each leg. Electrophysiological investigation by tip recording revealed that some of the LCSs contained water-receptor cells. Because the <b>basitarsus</b> possessed a larger number of LCSs than the other tarsomeres, the distribution of water-receptor-containing LCSs in the <b>basitarsus</b> of a foreleg was investigated morphologically and electrophysiologically. LCSs that contained water-receptor cells were mainly distributed on the ventral surface of the <b>basitarsus.</b> There were two types of water receptor that showed different response patterns to a stimulus, that is, phasic- and tonic-type water receptors. From the distribution of LCSs on the legs, the roles of these different types of water receptors in behavioral selection, that is, the initiation of swimming and the inhibition of flying, will be discussed...|$|E
