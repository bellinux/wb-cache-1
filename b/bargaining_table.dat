5|$|In June 1951, {{with peace}} talks {{underway}} in Panmunjom, the Ranger company was employed aggressively in offensive roles {{as a means}} to secure a better position for the UN at the <b>bargaining</b> <b>table.</b> After a number of operations north of the 38th parallel with the 7th Division, on 8 June the Rangers were moved to attack Hill 772, an operation crafted by Allen to win a strategically advantageous high ground position along the front line. That morning, the company, with support from 7th Division artillery, advanced on the hill, which was first blanketed with napalm strikes from U.S. Air Force P-51 Mustangs. Chinese forces resisted sporadically but withdrew {{at the end of the}} day having lost eight men killed and another thirty wounded. Against this the Rangers had lost only seven wounded. On 11 July, the Rangers continued the attack, backed by the 31st RCT who seized high ground near Sanying-ni and forced Chinese troops to retreat further. In this attack, one Ranger was killed and eight were wounded.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Research in {{the domain}} of {{electronic}} negotiations is a rather new and very interdisciplinary field, which gains more and more attention due to the in-dustry hype and momentum regarding electronic commerce and electronic markets. Negotiations in a narrow sense (not taking into account simple forms such as ”hit and take”) have been identified as an advantageous coordination mechanism for the interaction of buyers and sellers in electronic markets that transcend the selling of commodities or uniform goods. Hence, support for negotiations may become a critical success factor for electronic markets, especially regarding the recent failures of many industrial ventures. This paper presents the Montreal Taxonomy, which allows not only for the exact characterisation and comparison of a broad variety of electronic negotiation designs and systems, ranging from auctions to bilateral <b>bargaining</b> <b>tables,</b> but could also lead towards a more structured approach for the design of electronic negotiations...|$|R
40|$|How did India {{effect the}} {{transition}} from import substituting industrialization towards trade-led growth, {{in the context of}} a plural polity? It is argued that a pro-trade executive orientation at the time of a severe foreign exchange crisis can enable the executive to initiate significant policy change, if the executive takes advantage of the agreement with the IMF. Both the pro-trade orientation and the arrival of the severe foreign exchange crisis in 1991 are explained by tracing the process from India’s path of import substituting industrialization. The exogenous shock, a temporary rise in oil prices in 1990, was less significant than the ISI driven fiscal deficit, for generating the balance of payments crisis. Path reversals need not depend largely on an exogenous shock, as a path may have a built-in tendency to get reversed. The argument highlights the strategic nature of the international and domestic <b>bargaining</b> <b>tables</b> and the need to consider them simultaneously rather than additively...|$|R

30|$|Belgium {{continued}} with central wage settlements, since 2011 {{imposed by the}} government and within narrow margins set by legislation tying maximum wage increases to developments in neighbouring countries. Finland has returned to tripartite incomes policy pacts. “There are a limited number of things that Finland can affect on its own”-- so Finland’s prime minister (and current EU Commissioner) Jyrki Katainen when the deal for 2011 – 12 was announced -- “A pay contract supporting industrial peace and competitiveness, purchasing power and employment is in our hands.” In the Netherlands the main union confederations has since 1993 issued an annual recommendation on maximum wage increases, depending on past developments in inflation and productivity, and in any given year actual wage increases have stayed below this maximum (De Beer 2013). At times of economic downturn the government works hard and is usually capable to cast a “shadow of hierarchy” over <b>bargaining</b> <b>tables</b> in order to obtain a commitment to additional wage moderation (Visser and Van der Meer 2011). Moderation of wage demands in 2009 – 10 was tied to government and employer support for financing temporary shorter working hours, following the successful German example in metal engineering. In Italy the central organizations of unions and employers have set rules for sectoral and company bargaining through tripartite pacts (1993; 1998; 2009), but especially the 2009 pact was disputed by the largest union confederation and caused disunity within the employer camp, later followed by the exit of Fiat from the employers’ confederation. In Spain, the annual cross-sectoral agreements between the central union and employers’ organizations included from 2002 to 2008 rules as well as pay guidelines for sector and company negotiators based on inflation estimates. No agreement was reached in 2009, but in following years central coordination on bargaining rules was resumed without indexation-based pay recommendations.|$|R
25|$|Desperate union {{officials}} turned to violence {{to counter the}} setbacks they had suffered. Beginning in late 1906, national and local officials of the Iron Workers launched a dynamiting campaign. The goal of the campaign was to bring the companies to the <b>bargaining</b> <b>table,</b> and not to destroy plants or kill people. Between 1906 and 1911, the Iron Workers blew up 110 iron works, though {{only a few thousand}} dollars in damages was done. The National Erectors' Association was well aware who was responsible for the bombings, since Herbert S. Hockin, a member of the Iron Workers' executive board, was their paid spy.|$|E
25|$|Becker {{was sworn}} in just hours after 4,700 members struck Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel. The 11-month strike was a bitter and {{contentious}} one. But Becker {{was able to bring}} the company back to the <b>bargaining</b> <b>table</b> and win a new contract on favorable terms by using the union's enormous pension fund. The fund's trustees put pressure on Wheeling-Pitt's owners, Dewey Investors, to settle the strike. As Wheeling-Pitt's stock price fell by 50 percent and the pension fund's financial pressures increased, the owners agreed to end the strike. The union at Wheeling-Pitt emerged with a stronger contract, one which included a defined benefit pension plan.|$|E
25|$|Miller {{had also}} hurt himself. He had fired {{most of his}} {{supporters}} in the intervening three years, including press officer Bernard Aronson, research director Thomas Bethell {{and most of the}} research department staff, leaving UMWA organizationally unable to handle the needs of the negotiations and strike. Miller turned to the Stanley H. Ruttenberg Company for negotiating advice and assistance at the <b>bargaining</b> <b>table.</b> This caused confusion among UMWA negotiators as to strategy, tactics and the content of proposals, and caused mixed signals to be sent by the bargaining committee, Miller and other UMWA officers. The lack of organizational competence and flow of mixed messages helped prolong the labor dispute.|$|E

40|$|Exerpt] When {{you mention}} the words “unionization campaign,” {{most people think}} of picket lines, strikes and {{collective}} <b>bargaining</b> <b>tables.</b> Although they sometimes make headlines, labor disputes have traditionally been somewhat private affairs between companies and their employees about internal issues like better wages, benefits, hours and overall working conditions. Not anymore. Today’s unionization campaigns are more appropriately called “corporate campaigns” because they are orchestrated not just by trade unions, but NGOs, community leaders, politicians and religious groups. They attack the brand, not just the company; they target top executives and shareholders; and they focus on human rights violations — issues like child labor, human trafficking and unsafe working conditions that are more likely to garner public attention and damage the company’s reputation among consumers, business partners and investors. The purpose of a corporate campaign is still primarily to increase union membership and expand union power and influence on corporate management. The need for new members has become increasingly urgent as unions have been losing their stronghold in industrialized markets like the US, Canada and Europe as more of the historically unionized jobs are moved offshore. This decline has led to a shift in focus. Instead of organizing workers from the bottom up, unions are exerting pressure from the top down, attacking the company’s reputation and advancing public policy positions through the use of corporate campaigns. On this front, unions have partnered with NGOs to increase the strength and legitimacy of their attacks. As union membership has fallen dramatically over the past 20 years, there’s been a huge {{rise in the number of}} NGOs, organizations like Human Rights Watch, Oxfam and Save the Children that have focused much of their attention and resources on pushing their corporate citizenship standards on multinational companies. Together with trade unions, they launch corporate campaigns to turn customers against companies they believe are engaged in unsafe or unethical practices and to pressure governments to take action against those that don’t change their ways...|$|R
30|$|Enterprise-level {{collective}} agreements {{always have}} been voluntary and are {{over and above the}} provisions of general and sectoral agreements. Thus, enterprises have flexibility to react to enterprise-specific economic circumstances, subject to meeting the norms set in the general and sectoral agreements. Enterprise-level agreements are more common in large firms. According to employers’ associations, about 75 – 80 percent of large enterprises, 20 – 50  percent of medium-sized enterprises and less than 10 percent of small enterprises are covered by enterprise-level collective agreements 9. The estimates of trade union confederations are lower. The two largest trade union confederations (ZSSS and KS[*]−[*] 90) estimate that 30 – 50  percent of large enterprises, 20 – 30  percent of medium-sized enterprises and 5  percent of small enterprises are covered by enterprise-level collective <b>bargaining</b> (see <b>Table</b> twelve in European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound) 2007).

25|$|Prior to the {{acceptance}} of an employment offer, the prospective employee usually {{has the opportunity to}} negotiate the terms of the offer. This primarily focuses on salary, but extends to benefits, work arrangements, and other amenities as well. Negotiating salary can potentially lead the prospective employee to a higher salary. In fact, a 2009 study of employees indicated that those who negotiated salary saw an average increase of $4,913 from their original salary offer. In addition, the employer is able to feel more confident that they have hired an employee with strong interpersonal skills and the ability to deal with conflict. Negotiating salary will thus likely yield an overall positive outcome for both sides of the <b>bargaining</b> <b>table.</b>|$|E
25|$|Five {{days after}} Carey's {{historic}} {{victory at the}} <b>bargaining</b> <b>table</b> in the UPS strike, details of the donations kickback scheme were unveiled by the court-appointed federal official overseeing the union's elections. The report revealed that the donations kickback scheme included Citizen Action. The report said that Carey had approved a $475,000 donation to Citizen Action, and that Citizen Action had donated $75,000 of this money to the Carey re-election effort. The August 23 report also indicated that the Democratic National Committee (DNC) had been approached by Carey campaign officials. The report did not, however, conclude that Carey knew of the transactions and referred the matter to federal prosecutors for further investigation. Based on the report's findings, federal officials overturned the 1996 Teamsters presidential election, and called for new rules that would bar non-Teamsters from contributing to union election campaigns and establish a $1,000 contribution limit. The Independent Review Board opened its own inquiry into the financial scandal on August 27.|$|E
25|$|In early 1978, Medina was {{appointed}} the UFW's organizing director. In {{his first three}} months in office, the union won 13 elections and added more than 3,000 new members. He also changed the way the UFW approached strikes. In the past, the union would strike but end the walkout once the union had won the organizing election (held under the procedures of the California Agricultural Labor Relations Act). Employers would then file numerous appeals to the election, and over the many months (and sometimes years) it took for the appeals to be heard the union's support would vanish. Medina's new strategy {{was to keep the}} workers on strike even after the organizing election was won; this pressured employers to waive their legal right to appeal, recognize the union, and enter collective bargaining neogtiations immediately. If negotiations stalled, Medina's back-up strategy was ask union members to perform their jobs sloppily and then leave work. The employer would institute a lockout, a strike would begin, and the employer would return to the <b>bargaining</b> <b>table</b> to get the harvest in.|$|E
40|$|L'auteur explore deux avenues de ce qu'il faut déjà entrevoir comme la crise contemporaine du syndicalisme nord-américain. The {{past decade}} {{has not been a}} propitious time for North American unions. Regardless of {{political}} ideology, public and private sector unions have alike experienced the attenuation of their political influence, a dramatic loss of membership, a growing passivity among the members who remain, and the undermining of acquired rights, sometimes to the point of union decertification. Union-busting has become a big business in the United States, while three out of five new unions formed in Canada choose independence rather than affiliation to an existing central. For {{the first time since the}} 1920 's, the principal political powers are replacing the notion of the union as spokesperson for the exploited by the value-laden concept of the union as a labor aristocracy. What are the roots of this crisis of de-unionization? The paper looks first at the politic-economic context and argues that shifts occurring in the international division of labor have incited the major labor-intensive industries in North America to move against their unions by dramatic layoffs and cuts in benefits, at the same time as they pressure their states to reduce social supports for those who have joined the ranks of the structurally and permanently unemployed. The resulting fiscal crisis of the state has turned federal and state provincial governments, of whatever political coloration, to using their unions as scapegoats in the present crisis. «Scapegoat politics» in the industrial relations arena means cutting adrift minority unionism. The second line of analysis looks at two reasons why North American unions have not been able to defend themselves and crystallize new strategies for their changed environment. The first of these reasons concerns the post-Depression institutional dependence of unions, regardless of their ideology, upon their respective states, including the assumption that states will establish for unions the whole gamut of threshold conditions that minority unionism cannot gain et the highly decentralized <b>bargaining</b> <b>tables.</b> The second reason for the present reactive confusion of North American unions resides in their generalized abdication of bargaining over technology and production decisions, an abdication which has left them terribly vulnerable to the ravages of layoffs and retooling. The paper goes on to look at several dimensions of union dependence, through the notion of integration in relation to the state. It ends on a pessimistic note...|$|R
25|$|After {{playing the}} first two games of the season in 1987, players went on strike for free agency. In {{response}} to the strike, team owners brought in replacement players and continued the regular season after one week. Several well-known players, including Joe Montana, Lawrence Taylor and Tony Dorsett crossed the picket lines to rejoin their teams alongside these new replacements. On October 15, players voted to end the strike, to instead pursue a legal challenge to the free agency restrictions in court. In January 1988 Judge David Doty sided with the players in ruling that the clubs' continuance of the first refusal and compensation restrictions on free agents was not protected by the labor exemption to the antitrust laws. But in July 1988 Doty refused to grant an injunction which would have freed the players from the restrictions, ruling that the federal Norris-LaGuardia Act prevented courts from issuing injunctions in labor disputes. He urged both sides of the conflict to return to the <b>bargaining</b> <b>table</b> while in preparation for an anti-trust trial.|$|E
25|$|Becker {{also had}} to work to resolve an ongoing and lengthy strike in the rubber industry. The United Rubber Workers had struck the Japanese-owned Bridgestone/Firestone tire {{manufacturer}} in July 1994. The company subsequently hired more than 6,000 workers to permanently replace the strikers. The 74,000-member Rubber Workers Union voted {{to return to work}} without a contract. Although the Rubber Workers had rejected merger with the Steelworkers and other unions in the past, now the union's leadership sought merger. The merger was agreed to just as the workers returned to work, and approved by Rubber Workers' members in July 1995. The rubber workers won immediate access to the Steelworkers' $166 million strike fund, research staff, and highly influential pension fund. Becker pushed for a comprehensive campaign strategy to be used against Bridgestone/Firestone. The Steelworkers worked with Japanese labor unions to press the company to negotiate. An innovative public campaign was used to embarrass the company at major events (including the use of a blimp at the Indianapolis 500). These tactics convinced Bridgestone/Firestone management to return to the <b>bargaining</b> <b>table,</b> and the union eventually signed contract that weakened or eliminated a number of management's demands.|$|E
25|$|SDI {{was criticized}} for {{potentially}} disrupting the strategic doctrine of mutual assured destruction. MAD postulated that intentional nuclear attack was inhibited by the certainty of ensuing mutual destruction. Even if a nuclear first strike destroyed many of the opponent's weapons, sufficient nuclear missiles would survive to render a devastating counter-strike against the attacker. The criticism was that SDI could have potentially allowed an attacker to survive the lighter counter-strike, thus encouraging a first strike by the side having SDI. Another destabilizing scenario was countries being tempted to strike first before SDI was deployed, thereby avoiding a disadvantaged nuclear posture. Proponents of SDI argued that SDI development might instead cause the side {{that did not have}} the resources to develop SDI to, rather than launching a suicidal nuclear first strike attack before the SDI system was deployed, instead come to the <b>bargaining</b> <b>table</b> with the country that did have those resources and, hopefully, agree to a real, sincere disarmament pact that would drastically decrease all forces, both nuclear and conventional. Furthermore, the MAD argument was criticized on the grounds that MAD only covered intentional, full-scale nuclear attacks by a rational, non-suicidal opponent with similar values. It did not take into account limited launches, accidental launches, rogue launches, or launches by non-state entities or covert proxies.|$|E

Hitler seemed to respond; in his [...] "Reichstag" [...] speech on 30 January 1939, he stated that he wanted a [...] "long peace". Chamberlain was confident that improvements in British defence since Munich would bring the dictator to the <b>bargaining</b> <b>table.</b> This belief was reinforced by a German official's conciliatory speech welcoming Ambassador Henderson back to Berlin after an absence for medical treatment in Britain. Chamberlain responded with a speech in Blackburn on 22 February hoping that the nations would resolve their differences through trade, and was gratified when his comments were printed in German newspapers.

500|$|Further {{games were}} {{canceled}} as the lockout continued through November and December, including the 1999 All-Star Game, {{which had been}} scheduled to be played on February 14, 1999, at the First Union Center in Philadelphia. As a result of the All-Star Game's cancellation, the NBA later awarded the 2002 All-Star Game to Philadelphia. Discussions during the lockout were characterized by frequent hostility between the players and owners. One example of the heated nature of the talks came at an early December bargaining session, when Stern and NBPA executive director Billy Hunter became involved in what CBS News called [...] "an extremely heated, expletive-laden screaming match". Both men temporarily walked away from the <b>bargaining</b> <b>table,</b> and indicated after the session that the entire season might be canceled. Although the 1998 portion of the schedule was not played because of the lockout, 16 NBA players participated in a December 19 exhibition game in Atlantic City, New Jersey. The event's organizers intended to give NBPA members a share of the money raised, but the idea proved controversial, and charities ultimately received the proceeds.|$|E

On 20 August, Bottomley spoke at his final conference in Lagos, and repeated all he had previously said regarding Britain's stance on Rhodesia. Back in London three days later, he reaffirmed his previous stance regarding Lisbon, saying that he would be pleased to have a Rhodesian on the staff of the British Embassy there, but would allow no more. In the same interview, he expressed the belief that Wilson had averted a Rhodesian UDI in October the previous year by warning Salisbury of the economic consequences. Speaking in Gwelo on 27 August, Smith derided this statement, calling it [...] "incredible".
