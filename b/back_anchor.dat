50|$|The {{location}} {{to drop the}} anchor should be approached from down wind or down current, whichever is stronger. As the chosen spot is approached, the vessel should be stopped or even beginning to drift <b>back.</b> The <b>anchor</b> should be lowered quickly but under control until {{it is on the}} bottom. The vessel should continue to drift back, and the cable should be veered out under control so it will be relatively straight.|$|R

50|$|When a belayer {{needs to}} {{transfer}} the load from his harness to the anchor to escape the system:a rope grab (mechanical or friction knot/Prusik) {{is placed on the}} load line towards the load, rope is terminated on the rope grab (or the tails of accessory cord are used when using a cordelette with a Prusik as a rope grab) and runs <b>back</b> to the <b>anchor</b> where a Munter mule is tied under tension. The load can then be lowered (transferred) from the original belay onto the Munter Mule via the rope grab. The new line is often consider independent of the safety system so the original belay needs to be maintained throughout the process and secured <b>back</b> to the <b>anchor</b> before the system can be left unattended.|$|R
50|$|In {{places where}} the {{visibility}} is less than excellent {{it is necessary to}} use a guideline to find the way <b>back</b> to the <b>anchor,</b> because usually there is no boat handler on the surface to pick up the divers if they surface away from the boats.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{the year}} 1974 the Minicipality of Sofia {{approved}} the city plan containing {{the intention to}} build a metro system in Sofia. The construction works commenced in the year 1982. The route for Sofia metro Line- 1 Extension Project from Sveta Nedelya Square to Vassil Levski Stadium was financed with a loan from Japan International Cooperation Agency(JICA) and {{was carried out by}} the Japanese Contractor Taisei Corporation, under contract with the Sofia Minicipality. For this route, with length of 2, 4 km, two metro stations, two ventilations shafts and one start shaft, for strengthening of this deep excavations was design and used more than 610 tons temporary steel structures to keep the R. C. wall and pilot in vertically position. Contemporary machine methods of the tunnel excavation in the soft ground in Sofia was used for this route. The machine excavation is executed as a full-face excavation, employing tunnel-boring machines (TBM), with diameter 5820 mmThe paper provides a review of the design approach for three types of temporary steel-frame structures, called “back anchors”, used to support the TBM {{in the beginning of the}} drilling process, before the TMB enters the tunnel. The paper begins with the choice of structural configuration of the <b>back</b> <b>anchors,</b> used in the excavation of metro tunnels in Sofia. The construction process, the materials used, the static analysis methods and, the monitoring of the structure during the TBM start are also describe...|$|R

40|$|Pre-stressed tie <b>back</b> <b>anchored</b> {{diaphragm}} {{walls are}} {{considered one of}} the safest lateral supports which help in overall stability when there is a significant difference in land level between back and front of these walls. Permanent lateral supports to these walls are frequently represented by supporting it laterally with foundation and floor slabs of the building. In this paper a special study of one raw anchor diaphragm wall subjected to different earthquake dynamic loads will be presented. The wall retains an excavation of 9. 5  m and supports laterally a near-by 5 floor building. Five historical strong motions with different fundamental frequencies are subjected on the wall. The wall displacement, straining actions, anchor extreme force and the influence of variation of anchor stiffness are calculated using a dynamic Plaxis finite element program. The soil is considered as elasto-plastic material and represented using Mohr–Coulomb criteria, the wall and the anchor are considered to behave elastically. Prescribed displacement at the lower bottom boundary represents the earthquake motion. Far left and right absorbent boundaries are assumed to prevent dynamic wave reflection. Four static phases representing construction procedure and one dynamic loading phase are considered. It is found that the straining actions of different historical earthquakes match in shape with each other, the only change is in the amplitude which is affected by earthquake fundamental frequency and its intensity. The maximum dynamic lateral displacement of the wall is at its free top. The near-by building shows a differential settlement towards the wall which causes a change in the sign and amplitude of the straining actions. Increasing the stiffness of anchor was also studied and it was found that it reduces too much the maximum dynamic top wall lateral displacement...|$|R
