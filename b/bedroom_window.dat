5|$|Madeleine's {{mother had}} {{intended}} {{to check on the}} children at 21:30, but Matthew Oldfield, one of the Tapas Seven, offered to do it when he checked on his own children in the apartment next door to 5A. He noticed that the McCanns' children's bedroom door was wide open, but after hearing no noise, he left 5A without looking far enough into the bedroom to see whether Madeleine was there. He could not recall whether the <b>bedroom</b> <b>window</b> and its exterior shutter were open at this point. Early on in the investigation, the Polícia Judiciária accused Oldfield of involvement because he had volunteered to do the check, suggesting to him that he had handed Madeleine to someone through the <b>bedroom</b> <b>window.</b>|$|E
5|$|Kate Farrar {{was interviewed}} by {{investigators}} on October 26. She stated that on the night she had woken up to find the fire already burning. Seeing smoke seeping into her room, she opened the bedroom door and called to her brother, then {{closed the door and}} placed the hang-up 9-1-1 call that alerted police. She then crawled out of her <b>bedroom</b> <b>window</b> to escape the fire.|$|E
5|$|According to Kate, Farrar {{had moved}} out of the family home and spurned Green's desire for an amicable separation. Kate {{stressed}} that she loved and respected her mother and that all of the children had had good relationships with her, but that she was angry at her father for upsetting her mother by leaving. Pressed, she acknowledged that her mother had begun to drink large quantities of alcohol. She denied that she had ever seen matches in the house and expressed surprise that Tim had not escaped by the same route she had, which was via a <b>bedroom</b> <b>window</b> onto the roof.|$|E
60|$|They {{looked exactly}} like any other French <b>bedroom</b> <b>windows,</b> with neat, clean white lace {{curtains}} across them. The curtains had been put there, {{because they were the}} proper things to put there.|$|R
50|$|The {{southwest}} and northwest elevations have corrugated fibrous cement sunhoods to <b>bedroom</b> <b>windows.</b> The rear verandahs are enclosed with casement windows above fibrous cement sheeted balustrades. A metal stair is located centrally {{at the rear}} accessing back landings.|$|R
50|$|Some {{of their}} fights would also cause damage {{in other parts}} of their house (i.e.: the master <b>bedroom</b> <b>windows,</b> where Maude and Walter each threw the other's {{suitcases}} through; the kitchen window, which Walter threw a bottle of scotch through).|$|R
5|$|As well as {{artwork and}} sculptures, quotations, {{furniture}} and photography have been commissioned {{as part of}} the art strategy. A range of quotations have been inscribed onto the stonework in and around the parliamentary complex. Beneath the Canongate Building façade is the Canongate Wall, constructed from a variety of indigenous Scottish rocks such as Lewisian gneiss, Torridonian sandstone and Easdale slate. The stones are set into large concrete casts, each one inscribed with a quotation. The Canongate Wall contains a total of 24 quotations. Etched along the lower stretch of the wall is a pictorial representation of the Old Town of Edinburgh-based around a sketch by Enric Miralles showing the view of the Old Town from his <b>bedroom</b> <b>window</b> in the Balmoral Hotel.|$|E
5|$|Benjamin finds {{and brings}} his cousin Peter Rabbit into the rescue venture, {{and the two}} {{discover}} Tommy has invaded one of Mr. Tod's homes. Mr. Tod, a fox, has multiple homes but keeps moving. Often Tommy lodges in his homes. Peeping through the <b>bedroom</b> <b>window,</b> the rabbits see Tommy asleep in Mr. Tod's bed, and, peeping through the kitchen window, they see the table set for a meal. They realise the bunnies are alive, but shut in the oven. They try to dig a tunnel into the house but hide when Mr. Tod suddenly arrives in a very bad temper, which has caused him to move house.|$|E
5|$|Joe and Bonnie host a {{backyard}} barbecue, where Joe's baby daughter, Susie, {{gets into a}} fight with Stewie over a doll and attacks him. Upset by this, Peter takes Stewie to train at the local gymnasium. A trainer notices Stewie struggling with barbells and offers steroids. Peter injects the drugs into Stewie, who becomes incredibly buff and develops an aggressive personality, much to the horror of his family. Stewie becomes tormenting towards Brian. As time passes, Stewie's drugs gradually wear off, much to his shock. His skin becomes incredibly loose and flabby. Stewie jumps out of his <b>bedroom</b> <b>window</b> to avoid Brian's wrath, only to have his loosened skin help him glide to safety.|$|E
50|$|In {{some areas}} of heavily mixed {{residential}} developments like Mong Kok and Sham Shui Po, some residents have trouble sleeping as they have to bear strong neon light through their <b>bedroom</b> <b>windows,</b> emitted by the precincts which are lit up like football stadiums.|$|R
5|$|A similar {{situation}} arose outside the apartment. A crowd {{gathered by the}} front door of 5A, including next to the children's bedroom window—through which an abductor may have entered or left—trampling on evidence. An officer dusted the <b>bedroom</b> <b>window's</b> exterior shutter for fingerprints without wearing gloves or other protective clothing.|$|R
60|$|She returned, and Thomasin soon appeared. When she {{was seated}} in the gig with her husband, and the horse was turning to go off, Wildeve lifted {{his eyes to the}} <b>bedroom</b> <b>windows.</b> Looking from one of them he could discern a pale, tragic face {{watching}} him drive away. It was Eustacia's.|$|R
5|$|Two people {{disappear}} {{along the}} Appalachian Trail: {{a young man}} jogging with his girlfriend and a hermit who rarely leaves his home. Sheriff Grady Barnes (Gary Busey) finds a trail in the woods which leads him to parts of the hermit's body. That night, young Roy Satterly (Ty Wood) is reading by flashlight when a Bengal tiger briefly appears {{in front of his}} <b>bedroom</b> <b>window.</b> In the morning, his mother, Rose (Marina Stephenson Kerr), finds him sleepwalking in the woods in front of their house. A cast taken at the next victim's scene points to a tiger as the hermit's killer, so Sheriff Barnes holds a press conference to warn the public. The Bengal Tiger visits Roy's home again that night.|$|E
5|$|After hearing Sunny on the radio, Robin Hester {{turns up}} in Ramsay Street {{to try to}} get close to her. Sunny {{believes}} he is just being friendly. Robin climbs through Sunny's <b>bedroom</b> <b>window</b> and takes a photo of her. He locks Zeke in Pirate Net's storeroom, so he can spend some time with Sunny alone. Sunny and Robin go to Pirate Net to see if Zeke is there and Robin pretends to find the storeroom key and unlocks the door. Zeke tells Sunny that Robin locked him in the storeroom, but she refuses to believe him. Zeke violently attacks Robin in front of Sunny, scaring her. Zeke apologises and Sunny eventually realises that Zeke had been right about Robin. Sunny meets Robin at Charlie's and tells him that she and Zeke have broken up. Robin confesses to locking Zeke in the storeroom and tries to kiss Sunny, but Zeke appears and tells Robin to stay away them.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the rebel}} {{soldiers}} {{had been told}} that they were attacking in order to save Diệm from a mutiny by the Presidential Guard. Only one or two officers in any given rebel unit knew the true situation. A high wall, a fence and a few guard posts, surrounded the palace grounds. The mutinous paratroopers disembarked from their transport vehicles and moved into position for an attack on the main gate. Some ran forward and others raked automatic gunfire {{at the front of the}} palace, shattering most of the windows and puncturing the walls. Diệm was nearly killed in the opening salvoes. A rebel machine gun fired into Diệm's <b>bedroom</b> <b>window</b> from the adjacent Palais de Justice and penetrated his bed, but the president had arisen just a few minutes earlier.|$|E
50|$|In the {{signature}} scene that closes almost every episode, the family house is enveloped in darkness, save for one, {{two or three}} lights in the upstairs <b>bedroom</b> <b>windows.</b> Through voice-overs, two or more characters make some brief comments related to that episode's events, and then bid each other goodnight, after which the lights go out.|$|R
5000|$|Homogeneous {{interior}} temperature: it {{is impossible}} to have single rooms (e.g. the sleeping rooms) at a different temperature {{from the rest of the}} house. Note that the relatively high temperature of the sleeping areas is physiologically not considered desirable by some building scientists. <b>Bedroom</b> <b>windows</b> can be cracked open slightly to alleviate this when necessary.|$|R
30|$|The {{first part}} of the questionnaire, activity, {{included}} questions pertaining to demographics and general characteristics of the respondents’ buildings of residence. Sleeping and eating were hypothesized in this research to have taken place in <b>Bedroom</b> <b>windows</b> and kitchens. The respondents’ postcodes were also requested in order to confirm their location within their city area and their city planning zones.|$|R
5|$|Young {{was born}} in Fallowfield, Manchester, where {{he lived with his}} parents and older brother Chris. His house was half a mile from Manchester City's Maine Road ground, which was visible from the <b>bedroom</b> <b>window.</b> As a schoolboy he played for Manchester Boys, facing opponents who were two years older. After {{catching}} the eye of scout Harry Godwin, Young signed for Manchester City as an apprentice in 1959, turning down the opportunity to join Manchester United. Around this time he was capped by England at youth level. He turned professional in July 1960, and made his first team debut in November 1961, in a 2–1 defeat against Aston Villa at Villa Park. After breaking into the team for the first time, Young played every match in the remainder of the 1961–62 season. He scored his first goal for the club on 23 December 1961, in a 3–0 home win against Ipswich Town. He finished his first season with 11 goals in 26 appearances.|$|E
5|$|Another {{issue was}} whether the {{exterior}} shutter over Madeleine's <b>bedroom</b> <b>window</b> could be opened from outside. According to journalist Danny Collins, the shutter was made of non-ferrous metal slats on a roller blind that was housed in a box {{at the top of}} the inside window, controlled by pulling on a strap. Once rolled down, the slats locked in place outside the window and could be raised only by using the strap on the inside. Kate said the shutter and window were closed when Madeleine was put to bed, but open when she discovered Madeleine was missing. Gerry told the Polícia Judiciária that, when he was first alerted to the disappearance, he had lowered the shutter, then had gone outside and discovered that it could be raised only from the outside. Against this, the police said the shutter could not be raised from the outside without being forced, but there was no sign of forced entry; they also said forcing the shutter open would have caused a lot of noise.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} sees Little Mix {{adopting}} a new heavier look including leather outfits, bullet chains and gothic makeup, and explores themes of jealousy and obsession. It features the group hunting down {{men who have}} wronged them. Filmed in comic book movie style, Little Mix play female assassins who stalk and then kidnap men they are obsessed with. In one scene, Perrie Edwards is angrily driving a car while next to a male passenger who is bound and gagged. Edwards sports glossy red lipstick and a biker jacket, keeping {{her eyes on the}} road and paying no mind to the camera as wind blows through her hair. Jade Thirlwall is seen stalking a man outside his <b>bedroom</b> <b>window.</b> Standing outside the window ledge, Thirlwall spies on a man who captured her heart. Thirlwall wears metallic silver and black striped highwaisted trousers, with a white shirt, black bow tie and braces. Jesy Nelson's scene {{is similar to that of}} Edwards. Nelson races to her destination in a vintage convertible with a lace visor covering her eyes as police sirens flash behind her. In another scene, Leigh-Anne Pinnock masterminds the story's plots in a secret room with a wall of evidence the group has compiled, of which includes maps and clippings.|$|E
60|$|Something {{struck me}} as unusual about the place, but I could not tell at first what it was. One of the <b>bedroom</b> <b>windows</b> was open, and the {{customary}} short blind, with its brass upper rail partly unfastened, drooped obliquely across the vacant space. It looked negligent and odd, for usually everything about the cottage was conspicuously trim.|$|R
60|$|The {{thoroughfare}} {{leading to}} this spot was now blocked by two four-horse waggons and horses, one laden with hay-trusses, the leaders having already passed each other, and become entangled head to tail. The {{passage of the}} vehicles might have been practicable if empty; but built up with hay to the <b>bedroom</b> <b>windows</b> as one was, it was impossible.|$|R
25|$|The vast urban legend {{built around}} Spring-heeled Jack {{influenced}} {{many aspects of}} Victorian life, especially in contemporary popular culture. For decades, especially in London, his name was equated with the bogeyman, {{as a means of}} scaring children into behaving by telling them if they were not good, Spring-heeled Jack would leap up and peer in at them through their <b>bedroom</b> <b>windows,</b> by night.|$|R
25|$|A couple makes passionate love, {{as their}} toddler, Nic, climbs {{up to the}} <b>bedroom</b> <b>window</b> and falls to his death.|$|E
25|$|The {{same night}} a second {{incident}} was reported, {{this time in}} North 13th Street, {{at the home of}} Mrs. Leonard Burrell. She reported seeing a stranger break in through her <b>bedroom</b> <b>window</b> and then attempt to gas her.|$|E
25|$|As Pascal {{plays with}} his new found toy, he realizes it has a mind and will of its own. It begins to follow him {{wherever}} he goes, and not rise, at times floating outside his <b>bedroom</b> <b>window,</b> as his grandmother will not allow it in their apartment.|$|E
50|$|Morris dancing {{took place}} on Plough Monday, when the dancers went round the village to collect money. If this was refused they entered the house and refused to quit until ransom was paid either in cash or food. Fishing nets on long canes were carried to reach <b>bedroom</b> <b>windows</b> where they had locked doors. German bands also visited the village, as did {{travelling}} bears, which danced to music.|$|R
50|$|The {{video is}} a {{straightforward}} {{representation of the}} song. It intersperses shots of the band playing (later in the video, amid wind-blown blossoms) with shots of Pierre Bouvier's girlfriend, meeting (and having sex) with another man, while Bouvier, betrayed by the woman, waits in agony in his apartment. His apartment has {{a view of the}} man's apartment, with a clear view of a <b>bedroom's</b> <b>window,</b> where he sees them have sex.|$|R
60|$|He was now town councillor. They {{looked at}} the night, which {{was the same as}} the London night, only a good deal more transparent. Church bells down in the town were {{striking}} eleven o'clock. The wind was off the sea. And all the <b>bedroom</b> <b>windows</b> were dark--the Pages were asleep; the Garfits were asleep; the Cranches were asleep--whereas in London at this hour they were burning Guy Fawkes on Parliament Hill.|$|R
25|$|A {{neighbor}} named Mike {{reported that}} he observed Gosch talking to a stocky man in a blue two-toned Ford Fairmont with Nebraska plates; Mike {{did not know what}} was discussed because he was observing from his <b>bedroom</b> <b>window.</b> As Gosch headed home, Mike noticed another man following Gosch.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} morning hours of Christmas Day 1975, George looked up at the house after {{checking}} on the boathouse and saw the pig standing behind Missy at her <b>bedroom</b> <b>window.</b> When he ran up to her room he found her fast asleep with her small rocking chair slowly rocking back and forth.|$|E
25|$|As {{reported}} by the newspaper Campus, “For Lydia Canaan's first gig, she had to throw her trademark short rockish black leather skirt and studs out of her <b>bedroom</b> <b>window</b> in Brummana, put on a long skirt, lie to her conservative father about where she was going, and, after changing into her leather gear, singing her teenage heart out as Angel with the band Equation”.|$|E
50|$|Parker told {{parliament}} in 2004 {{that she had}} been raped as a teenager and nailed her <b>bedroom</b> <b>windows</b> shut in the aftermath. In 2009 it was revealed that her eldest son, Dylan, then aged 22, made and flew paper planes and had become one of the world's best, while simultaneously dealing with the sudden discovery of a brain tumour. His story was broadcast in an episode of the ABC TV program Australian Story.|$|R
50|$|The two wings {{radiating}} from the six-sided hall embody a ten-faced, symmetrical plan. The symmetry is part reinforced and part {{broken by the}} handling of voids. The north entrance porch and the arches over the <b>bedroom</b> <b>windows</b> in the south facade reinforce the symmetry, whereas the south west porch, the bays and the windows provide asymmetry. The asymmetric disposition of {{the functions of the}} rooms is reflected in the positioning of the windows.|$|R
60|$|The {{next day}} {{commenced}} as before, {{getting up and}} dressing by rushlight; but this morning we were obliged to dispense with the ceremony of washing; {{the water in the}} pitchers was frozen. A change had taken place in the weather the preceding evening, and a keen north-east wind, whistling through the crevices of our <b>bedroom</b> <b>windows</b> all night long, had made us shiver in our beds, and turned the contents of the ewers to ice.|$|R
