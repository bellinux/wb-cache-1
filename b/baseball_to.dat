5000|$|In the mid-1850s, {{teams in}} New York met in attempt <b>to</b> {{standardize}} the <b>baseball.</b> They decided <b>to</b> regulate <b>baseballs</b> <b>to</b> weighing between 5.5-6 oz {{and having a}} circumference of 8-11 inches. There were still many variations of baseballs since they were completely handmade. Balls with more rubber and a tighter winding went further and faster (known as [...] "live balls"), and balls with less rubber and a looser winding (known as [...] "dead balls") did not travel as far or fast. This is generally true for all baseballs. Teams often used this knowledge to their advantage, as players from the team usually manufactured their own <b>baseballs</b> <b>to</b> use in games.|$|R

In all, eighteen players played for the Mexican league despite the ban, including Mickey Owen, Max Lanier, and Sal Maglie.

Ted Williams, Stan Musial, and Phil Rizzuto were also offered lucrative contracts and incentives, but all eventually declined to play in Mexico.|$|E
