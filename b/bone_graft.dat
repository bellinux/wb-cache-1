5|$|On December 8, Emery {{was placed}} on injured reserve to have surgery on a torn muscle in his abdomen. Originally {{expected}} to miss about six weeks, the prognosis changed when {{it was discovered that}} he had avascular necrosis.

5|$|To {{achieve an}} {{adequate}} width and height of bone, various bone grafting techniques have been developed. The {{most frequently used}} is called guided <b>bone</b> <b>graft</b> augmentation where a defect is filled with either natural (harvested or autograft) bone or allograft (donor bone or synthetic bone substitute), covered with a semi-permeable membrane and allowed to heal. During the healing phase, natural bone replaces the graft forming a new bony base for the implant.|$|E
5|$|Other, more {{invasive}} procedures, {{also exist}} for larger bone defects including mobilization of the inferior alveolar nerve to allow placement of a fixture, onlay bone grafting using the iliac crest or another large source of bone and microvascular <b>bone</b> <b>graft</b> where {{the blood supply}} to the bone is transplanted with the source bone and reconnected to the local blood supply. The final decision about which bone grafting technique that is best {{is based on an}} assessment of the degree of vertical and horizontal bone loss that exists, each of which is classified into mild (2–3mm loss), moderate (4–6mm loss) or severe (greater than 6mm loss). Orthodontic extrusion or orthodontic implant site development can be used in selected cases for vertical/horizontal alveolar augmentation.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the temporal expression of TIMP- 1 within endochondral and intramembranous <b>bone</b> <b>grafts</b> during the early stages of healing in thirty six adult New Zealand white rabbits. Total RNA was isolated from <b>bone</b> <b>grafts</b> extracted on days 0 - 11 and day 14 post-grafting, for RT-PCR analysis. In situ hybridization was carried out on days 1 - 9 and day 14. Results showed TIMP- 1 expression coincides with osteogenesis, which indicates a role for TIMP in preserving the newly formed bone during the initial stages of <b>graft</b> healing. <b>Bone</b> <b>grafts</b> play an important role in influencing the healing process mediated by the host tissues. The temporal expression of TIMP- 1 differs in endochondral and intramembranous <b>bone</b> <b>grafts.</b> The earlier expression of TIMP- 1 by endochondral <b>bone</b> <b>grafts,</b> could be the reason for the delayed vascularization while the expression of TIMP- 1 by the intramembranous <b>bone</b> <b>grafts,</b> at a later stage could allow for earlier vascularization. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of cycling loading {{force on the}} substrate made of frozen <b>bone</b> <b>grafts</b> was investigated. Three layers of <b>bone</b> <b>grafts</b> were compacted in a spherical model of hip joint acetabulum and then subjected to a sinusoidal loading force. For each layer a series of N = 30 loading cycles were performed. The least impacted grafts were located in {{the upper part of}} the acetabulum, close to its opening, whereas the bed is the most compacted part. Compacting is a non-linear process which quickly loses its dynamics during subsequent cycles.

25|$|A rhinoplastic {{correction}} can {{be performed}} on {{a person who is}} under sedation, under general anaesthesia, or under local anaesthesia; initially, a local anaesthetic mixture of lidocaine and epinephrine is injected to numb the area, and temporarily reduce vascularity, thereby limiting any bleeding. Generally, the plastic surgeon first separates the nasal skin and the soft tissues from the osseo-cartilagenous nasal framework, and then corrects (reshapes) them as required, afterwards, sutures the incisions, and then applies either an external or an internal stent, and tape, to immobilize the newly reconstructed nose, and so facilitate the healing of the surgical cuts. Occasionally, the surgeon uses either an autologous cartilage graft or a <b>bone</b> <b>graft,</b> or both, in order to strengthen or to alter the nasal contour(s). The autologous grafts usually are harvested from the nasal septum, but, if it has insufficient cartilage (as can occur in a revision rhinoplasty), then either a costal cartilage graft (from the rib cage) or an auricular cartilage graft (concha from the ear) is harvested from the patient’s body. When the rhinoplasty requires a <b>bone</b> <b>graft,</b> it is harvested from either the cranium, the hips, or the rib cage; moreover, when neither type of autologous graft is available, a synthetic graft (nasal implant) is used to augment the nasal bridge.|$|E

30|$|The primary {{limitation}} {{of the present study}} {{is that it is a}} retrospective investigation, and not all of the patient details relating to operative time, blood loss, and pain severity were available. Despite these limitations, this study provides evidence that the use of <b>bone</b> <b>grafting</b> along with internal fixation in the treatment of intra-articular calcaneal fractures leads to better restoration of Bohler’s angle and the prevention of late collapse. Thus, in intra-articular calcaneal fractures, if the space created after open reduction is large, <b>bone</b> <b>grafts</b> may be considered as a treatment option. Also, in this study, patients with <b>bone</b> <b>grafts</b> were able to return to full weight-bearing earlier. However, the intermediate and long-term efficacy outcomes in the two groups were similar, which means that patients with intra-articular calcaneal fractures that are treated without <b>bone</b> <b>grafting</b> have functional outcomes as good as patients with such fractures that are treated with <b>bone</b> <b>grafting.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{tremendous}} {{need for}} bone tissue in numerous clinical situations {{and the limited}} availability of suitable <b>bone</b> <b>grafts</b> are driving the development of tissue engineering approaches to bone repair. In order to engineer viable <b>bone</b> <b>grafts,</b> one needs to understand the mechanisms of native bone development and fracture healing, as these processes should ideally guide the selection of optimal conditions for tissue culture and implantation. Engineered <b>bone</b> <b>grafts</b> {{have been shown to}} have capacity for osteogenesis, osteoconduction, osteoinduction and osteointegration- functional connection between the host <b>bone</b> and the <b>graft.</b> Cells from various anatomical sources in conjunction with scaffolds and osteogenic factors have been shown to form bone tissue in vitro. The use of bioreactor systems to culture cells on scaffolds before implantation further improved the quality of the resulting <b>bone</b> <b>grafts.</b> Animal studies confirmed the capability of engineered <b>grafts</b> to form <b>bone</b> and integrate with the host tissues. However, the vascularization of bone remains one of the hurdles that need to be overcome if clinically sized, fully viable <b>bone</b> <b>grafts</b> are to be engineered and implanted. We discuss here the biological guidelines for tissue engineering of bone, the bioreactor cultivation of human mesenchymal stem cells on three-dimensional scaffolds, and the need for vascularization and functional integration of <b>bone</b> <b>grafts</b> following implantation...|$|R
25|$|At {{the same}} time that Kahlo was gaining {{recognition}} in her home country, her health continued to decline. By the mid-1940s, her back had worsened to the point that she could no longer sit or stand continuously. In June 1945, she traveled to New York for an operation in which a <b>bone</b> <b>graft</b> and a steel support were fused to her spine to straighten it. The difficult operation was a failure. According to Herrera, Kahlo also sabotaged her recovery by not resting as required, and further by once physically re-opening her wounds in a fit of anger. Her paintings from this period, such as Broken Column (1944), Without Hope (1945), Tree of Hope, Stand Fast (1946), and The Wounded Deer (1946), reflect her declining health.|$|E
25|$|Nasal defects {{involving}} {{either the}} bone or the cartilage of the lateral nose are best managed with free grafts of flat septal bone and of cartilage. Small defects {{of the nasal}} dorsum can be covered with cartilage grafts harvested from either the septum or the concha of the ear. The correction of large-area defects of the nasal dorsum requires the stable support of a <b>bone</b> <b>graft</b> affixed either with a lag screw or with a low-profile plate. A costal graft (from the rib cage) is ideal for such a repair, {{because it can be}} harvested with an attached extension of cartilage that can be sculpted to blend into the nasal tip; other potential donor sites for nasal dorsum reconstruction materials are the outer table of the skull, the iliac crest, and the inner table of the ilium proper.|$|E
25|$|Early implant designs had the {{potential}} to loosen from their attachment to the bones, typically becoming painful ten to twelve years after placement. In addition, erosion of the bone around the implant was seen on x-rays. Initially, surgeons believed this was caused by an abnormal reaction to the cement holding the implant in place. That belief prompted a search for an alternative method to attach the implants. The Austin Moore device had a small hole in the stem into which <b>bone</b> <b>graft</b> was placed before implanting the stem. It was hoped bone would then grow through the window over time and hold the stem in position. Success was unpredictable and the fixation not very robust. In the early 1980s, surgeons in the United States applied a coating of small beads to the Austin Moore device and implanted it without cement. The beads were constructed so that gaps between beads matched the size of the pores in native bone. Over time, bone cells from the patient would grow into these spaces and fix the stem in position. The stem was modified slightly to fit more tightly into the femoral canal, resulting in the Anatomic Medullary Locking (AML) stem design. With time, other forms of stem surface treatment and stem geometry have been developed and improved.|$|E
40|$|Oral {{rehabilitation}} for {{a patient}} with severe loss of alveolar bone and soft tissue resulting from severe periodontitis presents a challenge to clinicians. Replacing loosening natural teeth with fixed prostheses supported by dental implants often requires either gingival surgery or <b>bone</b> <b>grafting.</b> The outcome of the <b>bone</b> <b>grafting</b> is sometimes unpredictable and requires longer healing time and/ or multiple surgeries. The presence of periodontal inflammation and periapical lesions often delay the placement of <b>bone</b> <b>grafts</b> as well as dental implants. Here we present a clinical case of a patient undergone full mouth reconstruction with implant-supported fixed prostheses. We demonstrated that early placement of implants (three weeks after extractions) with minimal <b>bone</b> <b>grafting</b> may be an alternative to conventional <b>bone</b> <b>grafting</b> followed by implant placement. We believe that primary stability during implant placement may contribute to our success.

40|$|OBJECTIVES Since the {{original}} description of osteoinduction {{in the early}} 20 th century, the study and development of innovative biomaterials has emerged. Recently, novel synthetic <b>bone</b> <b>grafts</b> have been reported with potential to form ectopic bone in vivo. However, their full characterization in comparison with other leading <b>bone</b> <b>grafts</b> has not been investigated. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the osteoinductive potential of <b>bone</b> <b>grafts</b> by comparing autogenous <b>bone</b> <b>grafts,</b> demineralized freeze-dried <b>bone</b> allografts (DFDBA), a commonly utilized natural bone mineral (NBM) from bovine origin (Bio-Oss), and a newly developed biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP). MATERIALS AND METHODS Grafts were compared in vitro for their ability to stimulate bone marrow stromal cell (BMSC) migration, proliferation, and differentiation as assessed by quantitative real-time PCR for genes coding for bone markers including Runx 2, collagen I, and osteocalcin. Furthermore, <b>bone</b> <b>grafts</b> were implanted in the calf muscle of 12 beagle dogs to determine their potential to form ectopic bone in vivo. RESULTS The in vitro results demonstrate that both autografts and DFDBA show potential for cell recruitment, whereas only autografts and BCP demonstrated the ability to differentiate BMSCs toward the osteoblast lineage. The in vivo ectopic bone model demonstrated that while NBM particles were not osteoinductive and autogenous <b>bone</b> <b>grafts</b> were resorbed quickly in vivo, ectopic bone formation was reported in DFDBA and in synthetic BCP grafts. CONCLUSION The modifications in nanotopography and chemical composition of the newly developed BCP <b>bone</b> <b>grafts</b> significantly promoted ectopic bone formation confirming their osteoinductive potential. In conclusion, the results from this study provide evidence that synthetic <b>bone</b> <b>grafts</b> not only serve as a three-dimensional scaffold but are also able to promote osteoinduction...|$|R

40|$|Morselized bone allografts {{have been}} used for the {{treatment}} of bone stock loss in orthopedic revision surgery with encouraging results. However, several parameters can influence the graft incorporation including the processing treatments. This experimental work used a cavitary bone defect in 90 rabbits to evaluate the sequence of incorporation of three different kinds of morselized bone allografts: uncryopreserved cancellous bone, freeze-dried cancellous bone, and totally demineralized cortical bone each of which were prepared in accordance with our rigid protocol.
