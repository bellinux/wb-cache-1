5|$|During {{the next}} eight years, the LPO {{appeared}} nearly a hundred times at the Queen's Hall for the Royal Philharmonic Society, played for Beecham's opera seasons at Covent Garden, and made more than 300 gramophone records. There were a few guest conductors for the Sunday concerts, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>were</b> conducted by Beecham. In the Courtauld-Sargent series the LPO played not only under Sargent but under many guests including Bruno Walter, George Szell, Fritz Busch and Igor Stravinsky.|$|E
5|$|In the Spring of 1924, Göppert {{entered the}} University of Göttingen, where she studied mathematics. A purported {{shortage}} of women mathematics teachers for schools for girls {{led to an}} upsurge of women studying mathematics {{at a time of}} high unemployment, and there was even a female professor of mathematics at Göttingen, Emmy Noether, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>were</b> only interested in qualifying for their teaching certificates.|$|E

5|$|Lee gave strict {{orders for}} his army to {{minimize}} any negative {{impacts on the}} civilian population. Food, horses, and other supplies were generally not seized outright, although quartermasters reimbursing Northern farmers and merchants with Confederate money were not well received. Various towns, most notably York, Pennsylvania, were required to pay indemnities in lieu of supplies, under threat of destruction. During the invasion, the Confederates seized some 40 northern African Americans. A few of them were escaped fugitive slaves, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>were</b> freemen; all were sent south into slavery under guard.|$|E
5|$|Most World War I war {{designers}} {{attempted to}} produce memorials that were, as cultural historian Jay Winter describes, noble, uplifting, tragic and endurably sad. There were various architectural styles used on memorials, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>were</b> essentially conservative in nature, typically embracing well established styles such as classicism and embracing mainstream Christian symbolism. This conservatism in part {{resulted from the}} age and background of the committees that were commissioning the memorials, and also from a sense that established architectural styles, rather a potentially more transitory but fashionable style, would be more enduring and appropriate.|$|E
5|$|The B and the GN were {{established}} in 1896 and 1898 respectively, but construction of both railways was delayed while funding was sought. In 1902 the UERL, which already controlled the DR, took control of both companies and quickly raised the funds, mainly from foreign investors. A number of different routes were planned, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>were</b> rejected by Parliament.|$|E

5|$|There {{were six}} deaths {{confirmed}} at the Superdome. Four {{of these were}} from natural causes, one {{was the result of}} a drug overdose, and one was a suicide. At the Convention Center, four bodies were recovered. One of these four is believed to be the result of a homicide. Body collection throughout the city began on approximately September 9. Prior to that date, the locations of corpses were recorded, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>were</b> not retrieved.|$|E
5|$|All six LSTs were {{unloaded}} by 11:45. There {{was little}} opposition. Eleven Japanese {{soldiers were killed}} by the naval bombardment or assault troops. Perhaps as many as 150 transient Japanese troops were in the Saidor area, all of whom fled into the interior. American casualties {{on the day of the}} landing came to one soldier killed and five wounded, and two sailors drowned. Nine Japanese Nakajima Ki-49 (Helen) aircraft, escorted by up to twenty A6M Zero (Zeke) and Kawasaki Ki-61 (Tony) fighters bombed the beach area at 1630. There were three more air raids during the night, and 49 over the course of the month, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>were</b> small.|$|E

5|$|Because of the {{constant}} threat by Japanese aircraft and warships, {{it was difficult for}} Allied forces to resupply their forces on Guadalcanal, which were often under attack from Imperial land and sea forces in the area. In early November 1942, Allied intelligence learned that the Japanese were preparing again to try to retake Henderson Field in another attempt. Therefore, the U.S. sent Task Force67 (TF67)—a large reinforcement and re-supply convoy, split into two groups and commanded by Rear Admiral Richmond K. Turner—to Guadalcanal on 11 November. The supply ships were protected by two task groups—commanded by Rear Admirals Daniel J. Callaghan and Norman Scott—and aircraft from Henderson Field on Guadalcanal. The transport ships were attacked several times on 11 and 12 November near Guadalcanal by Japanese aircraft based at Buin, Bougainville, in the Solomons, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>were</b> unloaded without serious damage. Twelve Japanese aircraft were shot down by anti-aircraft fire from the U.S. ships or by fighter aircraft flying from Henderson Field.|$|E
5|$|Despite 1980's playoff defeat, the Browns {{were widely}} {{expected}} to be even better the following year. But 1981 came {{with none of the}} comebacks or late-game magic the Kardiac Kids were known for. Several games were close, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>were</b> losses. Sipe threw only 17 touchdowns and was intercepted 25 times. The team finished 5–11. The 1982 NFL strike, which began in September and lasted until mid-November, shortened the regular season the following year to nine games. Coming off a poor year, Sipe split starts with his backup, Paul McDonald, and neither was able to bring back the old Kardiac Kids spark. The team ended with a 4–5 record, which qualified for an expanded Super Bowl playoff tournament created to accommodate the shorter season. The Browns faced the Raiders in a rematch of 1980's playoff thriller. This time, though, McDonald was the starter and the ending was far from tense. The Raiders won 27–10.|$|E
5|$|During the German-led Axis {{invasion}} of Yugoslavia in April 1941, {{she was the}} flagship of the 1st Monitor Division, and along with her fellow monitor , she laid mines in the Danube near the Romanian border {{during the first few}} days of the invasion. The two monitors fought off several attacks by the Luftwaffe, but were forced to withdraw to Belgrade. Due to high river levels and low bridges, the monitors' navigation was difficult, and they were scuttled by their crews on 11 April. Some of her crew may have been killed when a demolished bridge collapsed onto a tugboat after they abandoned ship. A number tried to escape cross-country towards the southern Adriatic coast, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>were</b> obliged to surrender to the Germans at Sarajevo on 14 April. The remainder made their way to the Bay of Kotor, where they were captured by the Italian XVII Corps on 17 April.|$|E

5|$|Later in the war, Young's {{farmhouse}} and Four Corners {{were the}} site of the largest military engagement near the river. By 1780, the Continentals were operating much more freely around northern Westchester, although they had to stay on the move to avoid attack. In January, one company of about 250 troops from Massachusetts lingered long enough at Four Corners for local Loyalists to inform the British, who raised a force of about 100 cavalry and 400 to 500 infantry at Fort Washington, today on the northern tip of Manhattan. The force marched to Yonkers and up the Saw Mill overnight, arriving at Four Corners the next morning. The outnumbered Continentals put up stiff resistance, aided by the cold, heavy snow cover and their opponents' fatigue, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>were</b> ultimately killed or taken prisoner. The British and their Loyalist and Hessian allies celebrated by burning down the Young house; the Continentals retreated {{to the north of the}} Croton River for the rest of the war.|$|E
5|$|Maclean {{raised a}} force of about 180 Emigrants, {{and a number of}} militia. By the time he reached Sorel on October 14, he had raised, in {{addition}} to the Emigrants, about 400 militia men, sometimes using threatening tactics to gain recruits. His and Carleton's hopes were dashed on October 30, when Carleton's attempted landing at Longueuil of a force numbering about 1,000 (mostly militia, with some Emigrants and Indian support) was repulsed by the Americans. A few of his boats were landed, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>were</b> driven off by Seth Warner's use of field artillery that had been captured at Chambly.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the bones}} {{collected}} were encased in siltstone nodules surrounded by fine sand and silt, with the rest lying in clay. The bones were disarticulated and scattered over a 5 x 2m (17 x 8ft) area, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>were</b> not far from their natural positions. The position of some bones was disturbed by a bulldozer, and some were broken by mechanical equipment before they were collected. Preparing the specimen was difficult, due to the hardness of the siltstone matrix {{and the presence of}} siderite; acid preparation was attempted, but most of the matrix was removed mechanically. The skeleton consisted of partial skull bones; teeth; cervical, dorsal and caudal vertebrae; ribs; a sternum; coracoids; arm and hand bones; claws; hip bones, and leg bones. The original specimen number was BMNH R9951, but it was later re-catalogued as NHMUK VP R9951.|$|E

5|$|On 16 April, Slavko Kvaternik {{announced}} that Serb peasants in the NDH had eight days to hand their weapons {{over to the}} Ustaše. Another influential communist, Milan Bakić, was arrested in Bjelovar on 20 April. On 22 April, the Ustaše arrested most of the town's remaining KPJ members. Communist organizers such as Stevo Šabić, Franko Winter and Sándor Király were arrested on 24 April. By 25 April, several hundred known or suspected anti-fascists had been arrested by the Ustaše. Some were spared death and given prison sentences, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>were</b> executed without trial. That same day, an Ustaše patrol discovered 80 rifles and several machine guns {{in the home of}} a local KPJ member. Forty rifles and two machine guns were found in the home of another local communist.|$|E
5|$|Other {{operators}} {{used the}} Comet either through leasing arrangements or through second-hand acquisitions. BOAC's Comet 4s were leased out to Air Ceylon, Air India, AREA Ecuador, Central African Airways, and Qantas Empire Airways; after 1965 they {{were sold to}} AREA Ecuador, Dan-Air, Mexicana, Malaysian Airways, and the Ministry of Defence. BEA's Comet 4Bs were chartered by Cyprus Airways, Malta Airways, and Transportes Aéreos Portugueses. Channel Airways obtained five Comet 4Bs from BEA in 1970 for inclusive tour charters. Dan-Air bought all of the surviving flyable Comet 4s from the late 1960s into the 1970s; some were for spares reclamation <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>were</b> operated on the carrier's inclusive tour charters; a total of 48 Comets of all marks were acquired by the airline.|$|E
5|$|The {{eighteenth century}} book {{consists}} {{of a collection of}} letters and essays written by Franklin. Most of the 25 letters in the collection were to Collinson. Some had personal content, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>were</b> about his experiments with electricity and what he had observed from them. These talked about the conclusions he came to after doing scientific experimentation on Leyden jars and lightning storm clouds. He many times related the similarities of how each of these acted and that the principles they followed were identical. This connection ultimately led Franklin to the lightning rod and that the electricity could be diverted harmlessly away from houses and wooden buildings - making it a protection device.|$|E
