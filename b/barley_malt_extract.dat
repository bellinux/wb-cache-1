40|$|The {{feasibility}} of using NIR spectral information from <b>barley</b> and <b>malt</b> hordein was assessed {{as to the}} suitability of developing improved NIR calibrations to predict protein in <b>barley</b> and <b>malt.</b> Using <b>extracted</b> hordein {{it was possible to}} gain more information on wavelengths relevant to predict protein with reduced errors. Strong correlations for grain protein and NIR wavelengths were found at 1, 116, 1, 268, 2, 040, 2, 068, 2, 188 and 2, 300 nm.

The xylose (Xyl) levels of centrifuged wort (indicative of arabinoxylan levels) made from 100 % <b>barley</b> <b>malt</b> were 0. 46, 0. 70, and 0. 55 % (% dry matter), while the corresponding malt water-extractable Xyl contents were 0. 31, 0. 44, and 0. 41 %. The Xyl levels in centrifuged worts from 60 % <b>barley</b> <b>malt</b> and 40 % wheat (0. 37 - 0. 58 %) depended mainly on the water-extractable arabinoxylan content of the starting material.

However, less effort has been dedicated to studying the main role of other non-structural carbohydrates and their interactions with other molecules such as glycolipids and lipopolysaccharides. The formation of complexes between amylose and lipids has also been highlighted, indicating that these complexes can modulate the different biochemical, chemical and physical properties of different cereal grains. Recent studies also suggested that other sugars (e. g., sucrose) can be associated with lipids in the form of lipopolysaccharides, glycol-glycerolipids or sugar esters having an important role in food properties (e. g. gelatinization of starch, formation of emulsions).
