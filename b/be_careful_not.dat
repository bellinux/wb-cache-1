25|$|By {{design the}} trireme {{was meant for}} day-long journeys, with no {{capacity}} to stay at sea overnight or carry the necessary provisions to sustain the men it carried. There were, however, storage facilities on board large enough to provide each crewman with the 2 gallons (7.6 L) of fresh drinking water {{he would need to}} stay hydrated each day. This meant that all those aboard were dependent upon the land and peoples of where they landed each night for supplies. Sometimes this would entail traveling up to eighty kilometres in order to procure the necessary provisions. In the Peloponnesian War, the beached Athenian fleet was caught unawares on more than one occasion, while out looking for food (Battle of Syracuse and Battle of Aegospotami). The cities, which suddenly found themselves needing to provide for all these sailors were usually agreeable and did not mind the extra business, but those in charge of the fleet and/or mission had to <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> to completely deplete the 'host' city of resources.|$|E

25|$|Yet the {{majority}} of World War II engines used superchargers, because they maintained three significant manufacturing advantages over turbochargers, which were larger, involved extra piping, and required exotic high-temperature materials in the turbine and pre-turbine section of the exhaust system. The size of the piping alone is a serious issue; American fighters Vought F4U and Republic P-47 used the same engine, but the huge barrel-like fuselage of the latter was, in part, needed to hold the piping {{to and from the}} turbocharger {{in the rear of the}} plane. Turbocharged piston engines are also subject to many of the same operating restrictions as gas turbine engines. Pilots must make smooth, slow throttle adjustments to avoid overshooting their target manifold pressure. The fuel/air mixture must often be adjusted far on the rich side of stoichiometric combustion needs to avoid pre-ignition or detonation in the engine when running at high power settings. In systems using a manually operated wastegate, the pilot must <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> to exceed the turbocharger's maximum rpm. The additional systems and piping increase an aircraft engine's size, weight, complexity and cost. A turbocharged aircraft engine costs more to maintain than a comparable normally aspirated engine. The great majority of World War II American heavy bombers used by the USAAF, particularly the Wright R-1820 Cyclone-9 powered B-17 Flying Fortress, and Pratt & Whitney R-1830 Twin Wasp powered Consolidated B-24 Liberator four-engine bombers both used similar models of General Electric-designed turbochargers in service, as did the twin Allison V-1710-engined Lockheed P-38 Lightning American heavy fighter during the war years.|$|E
500|$|... "The Moth" [...] {{aired on}} November 3, 2004. The episode was {{directed}} by Jack Bender and written by Jennifer Johnson and Paul Dini. The church scene with Charlie and Liam at the church in Manchester was actually filmed on Honolulu, where the scenes on the Island are filmed. Monaghan says that he feels Charlie's black hoodie {{is a sort of}} [...] "security blanket" [...] that he hides underneath and uses it when he feels [...] "lost." [...] The [...] "heroin" [...] that Charlie is supposedly snorting is actually brown sugar. Monaghan revealed this in an interview with Stuff magazine in October 2005, saying, [...] " [...] brown sugar. You get some really sweet boogers. You have to <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> to snort too much of it, but it's happened a few times. You just find dessert up your nose couple of hours later." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Lionel Steketee, [...] "Mylène [...] very professional, thorough, {{discreet}} {{and almost}} shy" [...] when she {{participated in the}} shooting of the video. He {{said she had to}} <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> to get scratched by the cat, and that the final scene was difficult to film because the cats were afraid of the water used in this scene, the rats remained hidden in a corner and the birds did not fly much. Given that the song deals with the pain caused by the absence of a dead person, the video is unrelated to the lyrics, as noted by author Alice Novak. In reviews, Yahoo! Music said that, through the video, [...] " [...] invites us into her dark and magical universe", and Premiere deemed it [...] "mysterious, provocative".

500|$|Test {{screenings}} for {{the film}} were encouraging for 20th Century Fox. Joe Roth, then president of the company, considered marketing Edward Scissorhands {{on the scale of}} [...] "an E.T.-sized blockbuster," [...] but Roth decided not to aggressively promote the film in that direction. [...] "We have to let it find its place. We want to <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> to hype the movie out of the universe," [...] he reasoned. Edward Scissorhands had its limited release in the United States on December 7, 1990. The wide release came on December 14, and the film earned $6,325,249 in its opening weekend in 1,372 theaters. Edward Scissorhands eventually grossed $56,362,352 in North America, and a further $29,661,653 outside North America, coming to a worldwide total of $86.02 million. With a budget of $20 million, the film was declared to be a box office success. The New York Times wrote [...] "the chemistry between Johnny Depp and Winona Ryder, who were both together in real life at the time (1989–1993), gave the film teen idol potential, drawing younger audiences." ...|$|E
500|$|Besides {{the great}} trilogy, Clement's only other extant {{work is the}} {{treatise}} Salvation for the Rich, also known as Who is the Rich Man who is Saved? Having begun with a scathing criticism of the corrupting effects of money and misguided servile attitudes towards the wealthy, Clement discusses the implications of [...] The rich are either unconvinced {{by the promise of}} eternal life, or unaware of the conflict between the possession of material and spiritual wealth, and the good Christian has a duty to guide them towards a better life through the Gospel. Jesus' words are not to be taken literally — we should seek the supercelestial [...] meaning in which the true route to salvation is revealed. The holding of material wealth in itself is not a wrong, {{as long as it is}} used charitably, but men should <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> to let their wealth dominate their spirit. It is more important to give up sinful passions than external wealth. If the rich man is to be saved, all he must do is to follow the two commandments, and while material wealth is of no value to God, it can be used to alleviate the suffering of our neighbor.|$|E

"The Hungry Earth" [...] and [...] "Cold Blood" [...] made up {{the fourth}} {{production}} block of the series and were filmed in late October and November 2009 in the Upper Boat Studios and Llanwynno, Wales.

The jungle walkway leading to the Silurian city was filmed in the Plantasia botanical garden in Swansea on 13 November 2009.
