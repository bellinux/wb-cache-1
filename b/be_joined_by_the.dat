5|$|The {{regiment}} conducted training until 24 September, {{when they}} received embarkation orders. Due to {{the fear of}} German warships being in the area, the wait for suitable escort ships delayed their departure until 15 October. With a short stop at Hobart, on 28 October they arrived at Albany, and anchored waiting to <b>be</b> <b>joined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Australian contingent. The combined convoy sailed on 1 November and reached Colombo on 15 November. Two days later it sailed into the Red Sea and the Suez Canal. They docked at Port Said on 2 December and Alexandria the next day. The regiment disembarked on 4 December and boarded a train for their camp in the Cairo suburb of Zeitoun. There they started a training programme, using the desert for manoeuvres, during both day and night.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} for the landing orders were issued to ensure everyone was fit and to concentrate on weapons firing and street fighting. The two French troops were still under command and just for this operation No. 4 Commando took command of a section from the Dutch Troop, No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando, and groups from the Special Boat Section (SBS), Royal Engineers and the Royal Artillery to call for artillery fire support. For some reason the old method of calling troops by {{letters of the alphabet}} was dropped and the troops were now numbered. The No.1 to No.4 Troops were British and No.s 5 and 6 French. The heavy weapons troop was No. 4 Troop. The final plan for the assault was for the SBS and a section from No. 1 Troop, to go first and reconnoitre a suitable landing point. Following them, the rest of No.1, No. 2 Troop and commando headquarters would secure the beachhead. They would then <b>be</b> <b>joined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> remaining troops, passing through the beachhead and into the town. No.1 Troop would secure the left flank and No. 2 Troop the right.|$|E
5|$|On 23 September the {{regiment}} left their camp for Lyttelton and embarked on the transport ships HMNZT Tahiti and HMNZT Athenic. Leaving the same day, {{they arrived at}} Wellington the next afternoon, and disembarked the troops. On 14 October they boarded the transports again and set sail. With a short stop at Hobart, on 28 October they arrived at Albany, and anchored waiting to <b>be</b> <b>joined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Australian contingent.

25|$|In 1892, the Golden Eagle would <b>be</b> <b>joined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Central's new station building. It mixed {{elements}} of the Italianate, Victorian Gothic and Hudson River Bracketed styles, an eclecticism common in the Central's Hudson Valley stations. It is a one-story stone building with a hipped roof that curves at the end, roof finials, and wood brackets on corbel supports. The original 1850s frame station, which {{had been on the}} site, was relocated nearby.|$|E
25|$|The Raiders {{were the}} first team to score an offensive, defensive, and special teams {{touchdown}} in the same Super Bowl.

25|$|The AW139 {{serves as}} the basis for AgustaWestland's wider {{business}} strategy, under which it aims to produce a standardised family of helicopters with common design features. The sharing of components and design philosophies is intended to simplify maintenance and training for operators, commonality also lowers the production costs. The AW139 was the first of this group, and as of 2014 it was to <b>be</b> <b>joined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> larger AW149 and AW189, aimed at military and civilian customers respectively. Advances made in the development of new models are intended to be transferrable onto existing family members, decreasing the cost of future upgrades for the AW139.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of , a group of {{officers}} commanding about 3,000 men assembled in Senate Square, where they refused to swear allegiance to the new tsar, NicholasI, proclaiming instead their loyalty to Constantine and their Decembrist Constitution. They expected to <b>be</b> <b>joined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> rest of the troops stationed in Saint Petersburg, but they were disappointed. The revolt was further hampered when it was deserted by its supposed leader Prince Trubetskoy, who had a last-minute change of heart, and failed to turn up at the Square. His second-in-command, Colonel Bulatov, also vanished from the scene. After a hurried consultation, the rebels appointed Prince Eugene Obolensky as a replacement leader.|$|E
25|$|Whether the Iranian defence {{could have}} been {{successful}} is debatable and on 29 August, after some more sporadic fighting, word reached the Iranian commanders at Ahvaz that their government had accepted a ceasefire {{and they were not}} to fight any longer. The British and Iranians agreed as part of the ceasefire that the Iranians would not lay down their arms and remain at their posts but they would <b>be</b> <b>joined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> British troops, who would carry out a parade in the city. In exchange, the Iranians would safely evacuate British residents in the city to British troops. The British with their Indian troops paraded in the city, with full military honours given by the Iranian general.|$|E

25|$|Below the lake, {{the river}} passes the hamlet of Perlethorpe, to <b>be</b> <b>joined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> River Maun, flowing northwards, and here called Whitewater. The Robin Hood Way, a long {{distance}} footpath, crosses soon afterwards, and a weir creates two channels again, the south one deemed to be the Maun and the north one the Meden. They remain roughly parallel as they are crossed by the B6387 road near Bothamsall, a freight railway and the Robin Hood Way again. They diverge {{to the west of}} Markham Moor roundabout on the A1 road, pass under the road, and combine to form the River Idle. Just below the junction, the River Poulter swells the flow.|$|E
25|$|Downriver from Kut, at Ali Gharbi, Lieutenant-General Fenton Aylmer was {{collecting}} {{forces to}} relieve the Kut garrison. Initially, the only force available in theatre which were not already in Kut was the 6th Indian Cavalry Brigade and the 35th and 28th Indian Brigades. They would soon <b>be</b> <b>joined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> first elements of the 7th (Meerut) Division. With pressure from both Townshend in Kut and Nixon in Basra, Aylmer succumbed to their demands and began his advance upriver {{as soon as his}} he had collected three full brigades of infantry. Setting out on 4 January 1916, Aylmer would be able to commit approximately 9,900 infantry, 1340 cavalry, and 42 field guns. Additionally, along the Tigris there would be four gunboats to support the advance.|$|E
25|$|Captain Charles Brown, {{in command}} of the settlers, was ordered to march down the coast until he reached the rear of the Māori {{positions}} at Waireka. The Regulars, under Lieut-Colonel G.F. Murray, marched down the main road to Omata, intending to dislodge a war party reported to be at Whalers Gate, north of Omata. Once the road was clear, it was intended they would <b>be</b> <b>joined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Volunteers and militia, who would rescue the settlers, before marching back to New Plymouth. Because of the heightened state of fear in New Plymouth, however, Murray had been ordered to return his troops to the town before nightfall. The Volunteers were armed with muzzle-loading Enfield rifles and the militia had old smooth-bore muskets from the 1840s, with each man issued with just 30 rounds of ammunition.|$|E

25|$|In {{their attack}} on Little Round Top, the 15th Alabama would <b>be</b> <b>joined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> 4th and 47th Alabama Infantry, {{and also by}} the 4th and 5th Texas Infantry regiments. All of these units were {{thoroughly}} exhausted {{at the time of}} the assault, having marched in the July heat for over 20 miles (37 kilometers) prior to the actual attack. Furthermore, the canteens of the Southerners were empty, and Law's command to advance did not give them time to refill them. Approaching the Union line on the crest of the hill, Law's men were thrown back by the first Union volley and withdrew briefly to regroup. The 15th Alabama repositioned itself further to the right, attempting to find the Union left flank which, unbeknownst to it, was held by Chamberlain's 20th Maine.|$|E
25|$|The Hawkwell Brook rises on {{the edge}} of Hockley Woods, to the north of HM Prison Bullwood Hall. It flows eastwards, through the woods and to the south of Great Bull Wood, and runs across the {{northern}} end of Belchamps Scout Centre. It is culverted under Elmwood Avenue, and re-emerges to pass under the B1013 Main Road and Thorpe Close in Hawkwell. From this point it is designated as a main river, and is therefore the responsibility of the Environment Agency. It flows to the south of the Clements Hall Sports Complex, to <b>be</b> <b>joined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Hockley Brook, which rises near Southbourne Grove, Hockley, flows under the Shenfield to Southend Railway and then alongside it, to the junction {{on the north side of}} Rectory Road. Now officially the Roach, it turns to the south east, passing under Rectory Road, and continuing to Rochford, running broadly parallel to Ironwell Lane. It then crosses beneath the railway and Hall Road, running beside Bradley Way to reach its junction with Noblesgreen Ditch by Rochford Reservoir.|$|E
25|$|In 1909 however, High Commissioner John Anderson {{expressed}} concerns over over-centralisation, which was marginalisation local sultans away from policymaking. This {{led to the}} creation of Federal Council, which the sultans were members along with representatives from the colonial government and members of the non-Malay communities. The creation of the council however failed to distribute powers to the individuals FMS states. Another attempt at decentralisation as carried out in 1925 by Laurence Guillemard, the High Commissioner from 1920 to 1927, which was termed as the Decentralisation Debate of 1925-1927. While the Malays supported the proposal because it would give them more powers, Chinese merchants and British planters argued against it, fearing decentralisation would affect efficiency badly and slow effort at building a unified modern state. The next High Commissioner, Cecil Clementi, arriving from Hong Kong in 1930, pushed harder for decentralisation, believing that it would entice the UMS to join the FMS, forming a Malayan union. He envisaged the union would eventually <b>be</b> <b>joined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Straits Settlements as well as the British Borneo.|$|E
