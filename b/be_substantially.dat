5|$|BART {{was one of}} {{the first}} U.S. systems of any size to <b>be</b> <b>substantially</b> automated. Routing and {{dispatching}} of trains, and adjustments for schedule recovery are controlled by a combination of computer and human supervision at BART's Operations Control Center (OCC) and headquarters at the Kaiser Center in Downtown Oakland. Station-to-station train movement, including speed control and maintenance of separation between successive trains, is entirely automatic under normal operation, the operator's routine responsibilities being issuing announcements, closing the doors after stations stops, and monitoring the track ahead for hazards. In unusual circumstances the operator controls the train manually at reduced speed.|$|E
5|$|Having {{arrived at}} the Olympics, Leech made her debut in the 100-metre freestyle, an event in which she, Fraser and Crapp were {{regarded}} as the three strongest competitors, although the latter two were considered to <b>be</b> <b>substantially</b> stronger. All three won their heats. Leech won her heat by 1.6 seconds {{in a time of}} 1 minute 4.9 seconds. She was third fastest qualifier behind Fraser and Crapp, who were over 1.5 seconds faster. Drawn in Fraser's semifinal, Leech finished second in a time of 1 minute 5.2 seconds, and was the third fastest qualifier for the final behind her compatriots. The semifinals followed a similar pattern to the heats, with Fraser and Crapp more than two seconds ahead of the six remaining qualifiers, who were separated by just 0.8 of a second.|$|E

A Brazilian {{study investigated the}} termite assemblages of three sites of Caatinga under different levels of anthropogenic disturbance in the semi-arid region of northeastern Brazil were sampled using 65 x 2 m transects. A total of 26 species of termites {{were present in the}} three sites, and 196 encounters were recorded in the transects. The termite assemblages were considerably different among sites, with a conspicuous reduction in both diversity and abundance with increased disturbance, related to the reduction of tree density and soil cover, and with the intensity of trampling by cattle and goats. The wood-feeders were the most severely affected feeding group.|$|E
5|$|The {{age of the}} Santa Rosa fauna remains highly uncertain, as the outcrop {{where the}} fossils were found cannot easily {{be placed in a}} known stratigraphical unit, and the fossils are so {{distinct}} from other known fossil faunas that biostratigraphy cannot provide a precise estimate. In a summary of the 2004 volume, Kenneth Campbell tentatively referred Santa Rosa to the Mustersan South American Land Mammal Age (SALMA), which he placed near the Eocene–Oligocene boundary, around 35 million years ago. However, Mario Vucetich and colleagues suggested in 2010 that the Santa Rosa fauna may <b>be</b> <b>substantially</b> later—perhaps as young as the Deseadan SALMA (late Oligocene, around 25 million years ago). According to Campbell, the Santa Rosa mammals likely lived in a savanna habitat that contained rivers.|$|E
5|$|The {{essential}} {{feature of}} defence-in-depth, according to Luttwak, was an acceptance that the Roman frontier provinces themselves {{would become the}} main combat-zone in operations against barbarian threats, rather than the barbarian lands across the border. Under this strategy, border-forces (limitanei) would not attempt to repel a large incursion. Instead, they would retreat into fortified strongholds and wait for mobile forces (comitatenses) to arrive and intercept the invaders. Border-forces would <b>be</b> <b>substantially</b> weaker than under forward defence, but their reduction in numbers (and quality) would be compensated by the establishment of much stronger fortifications to protect themselves.|$|E

5|$|The {{queen conch}} reaches sexual {{maturity}} at approximately 3 to 4 years of age, reaching a shell length of nearly 180mm and weighing up to 5 pounds. Individuals may usually {{live up to}} 7 years, though in deeper waters their lifespan may reach 20–30 years and maximum lifetime estimates reach 40 years. It is believed that the mortality rate tends to be lower in matured conchs due to their thickened shell, but it could <b>be</b> <b>substantially</b> higher for juveniles. Estimates have demonstrated that its mortality rate decreases as its size increases and can also vary due to habitat, season and other factors.|$|E

Although the fort never received its full complement of guns, by 1881 it had ten 12.5 inch, 38 ton (317mm, 39,000kg) rifled muzzle-loading (RML) guns, fifteen 10 inch, 18 ton (254mm, 18,000kg) RML guns, five 9 inch, 12 ton (228mm, 12,000kg) RML guns, and 3 64-pounders (29kg), together forming a powerful arsenal.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{that of his}} contemporary, the Finn Jean Sibelius, Nielsen's {{reputation}} abroad did {{not start}} to evolve until after World War II. For some time, international interest was largely directed towards his symphonies while his other works, many of them highly popular in Denmark, have only recently started {{to become part of}} the world repertoire. Even in Denmark, many of his compositions failed to impress.

5|$|In 2007, {{the turnpike}} {{commission}} {{announced plans to}} widen the Northeast Extension to six lanes between Mid-County and Lansdale. The project divided this stretch of highway into two sections. Work on the southern section began in January 2008 with the replacement of two bridges over the Northeast Extension to accommodate the widened highway. Construction on the actual widening phase commenced in January 2011. Completion was originally planned in 2013; however, construction fell a year behind schedule. The southern section finished up in October 2014, while work on the northern section started in May 2014. By this point the project scope was expanded to include the Lansdale interchange itself, the roadway to a point one mile north of the interchange, and two new E-ZPass-only ramps at the Lansdale interchange to relieve congestion at the toll plaza. This new northbound exit ramp opened December 4, 2016, and the companion southbound on-ramp opened a week later.. The northern section was originally planned to finish {{by the end of}} 2016 but was delayed until mid-2017. Construction is to <b>be</b> <b>substantially</b> complete, with all six lanes open, by August 31, 2017.|$|E
