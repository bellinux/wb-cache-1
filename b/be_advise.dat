40|$|It is {{estimated}} that approximately 30 % of the GERD patients is not satisfied {{about the effect of}} proton pump inhibitors on their symptoms. Esophageal hypersensitivity, persistent non-acid reflux and incomplete acid suppression all can {{play a role in the}} pathogenesis of persistent GERD symptoms. More powerful inhibitors of the proton pump are now being developed, resulting in a more prolonged and profound acid suppression. New prokinetics and inhibitors of transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations (TLESRs) can potentially reduce both acid and non-acid reflux and drugs that reduce hypersensitivity are possibly helpful for the treatment of non-erosive reflux disease. Whether these drugs will make it to the markets will mainly depend on their side effect profile and their ability to have an additional beneficial effect over the current gold standard therapy as it likely that a new antireflux drug will be used in combination with proton pump inhibitors. Over the last decade various endoscopic antireflux techniques have been introduced, most of them have been withdrawn soon after introduction due to lack of effect or after the occurrence of severe side-effects. Several endoluminal plication techniques and endoluminal radiofrequency ablation therapy are still available and being evaluated in research centres but more data on safety and efficacy is required before a more widespread use can <b>be</b> <b>advise...</b>|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The aim of {{this article}} is to {{identify}} and to balance the arguments in favor of and against lumping together gastroesophageal reflux disease and functional dyspepsia. RECENT FINDINGS: In at least half of the patients diagnosed with gastroesophageal reflux disease no organic abnormalities are found. Hypersensitivity of the esophagus to various stimuli plays a key role in the genesis of symptoms in these patients. The association between symptoms and acid reflux events can be quantified by 24 -h esophageal pH monitoring. It has also become possible to detect non-acid reflux, using the intraluminal impedance monitoring technique. Functional dyspepsia is still defined by a combination of symptoms for which no organic cause can be found. No positive diagnostic tools have yet become available and treatment with acid secretion inhibitors, Helicobacter pylori eradication or prokinetic drugs remains marginally effective. SUMMARY: Gastroesophageal reflux disease is a well defined disease which can be diagnosed objectively with endoscopy or 24 -h pH/impedance monitoring with symptom association analysis. Functional dyspepsia is a functional disorder for which no objective test has yet been discovered. Treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease is based on objectively identified abnormalities and highly effective. Treatment of functional dyspepsia is empiric and marginally effective. For these reasons, the lumping together of gastroesophageal reflux disease and functional dyspepsia is not to <b>be</b> <b>advise...</b>|$|E
40|$|Tumor {{necrosis}} factor (TNF) -α and interleukin (IL) - 10 are key cytokines {{involved in}} lymphoma development. Their pretreatment plasma levels {{were reported to}} influence the clinical course of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. In this study the impact of combined elevation of TNF-α and IL- 10 on disease features and outcome of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) were investigated. Plasma TNF-α and IL- 10 levels were determined {{at the time of}} diagnosis in a group of 106 DLBCL patients uniformly treated with anthracycline-based regimens. Three risk groups depending on the pretreatment levels of the cytokines were identified: low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups. In univariate analysis, the cytokine intermediate- and high-risk groups were associated with lower probability of achieving a complete remission (odds ratio [OR] = 0. 2, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 06 - 0. 6, p = 0. 006 and OR = 0. 05, 95 % CI 0. 01 - 0. 2, p < 0. 0001, respectively) and shorter progression-free survival (PFS) (OR = 4. 4, 95 % CI 1. 9 - 10. 2, p < 0. 001 and OR = 9. 7, 95 % CI 4. 1 - 23. 0, p < 0. 0001, respectively) and overall survival (OS) (OR = 4. 2, 95 % CI 1. 7 - 10. 1, p = 0. 002 and OR = 11. 2, 95 % CI 4. 4 - 28. 4, p < 0. 0001, respectively) in comparison with the cytokine low-risk group. In multivariate analysis, the cytokine intermediate- and high-risk groups also correlated with shorter PFS (relative risk [RR] = 4. 5, 95 % CI 1. 9 - 10. 9, p = 0. 001 and RR = 5. 8, 95 % CI 2. 2 - 15. 3, p < 0. 0001, respectively) and OS (RR = 4. 6, 95 % CI 1. 8 - 12. 0, p = 0. 001 and RR = 7. 5, 95 % CI 2. 7 - 20. 9, p < 0. 0001, respectively) regardless of the International Prognostic Index (IPI) scoring system. The TNF-α and IL- 10 level-based index may work as an additional model to the IPI for predicting the survival of DLBCL patients. This model may help to identify patients in a given IPI risk group for whom more accurate and risk-adapted treatment could <b>be</b> <b>advise...</b>|$|E

40|$|Objective: The {{relationships}} between adverse events (AEs) and plasma concentrations of nevirapine (NVP) and efavirenz (EFV) were investigated {{as part of}} the large, international, randomized 2 NN study. Methods: Treatment-naive, HIV- 1 -infected patients received NVP (once or twice daily), EFV or their combination, each in combination with lamivudine and stavudine. Blood samples were collected on day 3 and weeks 1, 2, 4, 24 and 48. Concentrations of NVP and EFV were quantitatively assessed by a validated HPLC assay. Individual Bayesian estimates of the area under the plasma concentration-time curve over 24 h (AUC(24 h)), and minimum and maximum plasma concentrations (C-min and C-max) as measures for drug exposure of NVP and EFV, were generated using a previously developed population pharmacokinetic model. Pharmacokinetic parameters were compared for patients with and without central nervous system (CNS) and psychiatric AEs, hepatic events, liver enzyme elevations (LEEs) and rash. Furthermore, it was investigated whether a clear cut-off for a pharmacokinetic parameter could be identified above which the incidence of AEs was clearly increased. AEs were also related to demographic parameters and baseline characteristics. Results: In total, from 1077 patients, NVP (3024 samples) and EFV (11694 samples) plasma concentrations and AE data (825 observations) were available. For all patients C-min, C-max and AUC(24 h) were determined. When corrected for known covariates of gender, CD 4 cell count at baseline, region, hepatitis coinfection and possible interactions between these factors, no significant associations between AEs and any tested exposure parameter of NVP was observed. Also, no target C-min value, above which patients were at increased risk for AEs, could be established. On the other hand, geographical region, hepatitis coinfection, CD 4 cell count and gender were found to be significantly related with the incidence of CNS and psychiatric AEs, hepatic events, LEEs and rash during the treatment with NVP. The occurrence of elevated liver enzymes during the first 6 weeks in the EFV-containing arm was significantly (P= 0. 036) correlated to the exposure of EFV (C-min). Only hepatitis coinfection impacted on LEEs during the first 6 weeks of treatment. With an EFV C-min above 2. 18 mg/l during the induction phase, patients were 4. 4 (range 1. 3 - 15. 5) times more at risk for elevated liver enzymes. No other correlations between AEs and EFV pharmacokinetics or patient characteristics could be identified. Conclusions: Pharmacokinetic parameters of NVP did not have a relationship to AEs in the 2 NN trial when corrected for known covariates. The value of periodical drug monitoring of NVP as a way to prevent toxicity is therefore limited. Treating physicians should instead focus on factors that are more predictive of AEs (gender, CD 4 count and hepatitis coinfection). High EFV C-min levels resulted in elevated liver enzyme values during the first 6 weeks of treatment. Regular measurement of EFV levels and liver enzymes at the start of therapy may therefore <b>be</b> <b>advise...</b>|$|E
