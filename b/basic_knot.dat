40|$|Aims: To try {{to improve}} the {{teaching}} of basic surgical skills, we developed an e-textbook and employed a novel pedagogy (the reverse classroom) and compared this to traditional teaching methods. Methods: A single-blinded, randomized control {{study was conducted to}} com-pare an iPad based e-textbook, coupled with a face to face teaching session; to a face to face teaching session alone. The intervention group had access to the e-textbook before, during and after a face to face teaching session. The control group only received a face to face teaching session. The same educational materials were used for each group. Participants were recorded tying knots immediately following the teaching session and one week later. Performance was assessed by a blinded examiner using the previously validated Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills. Results: The intervention group required significantly less time to perform the knot-tying task in the classroom (p = 0 ⋅ 02). Immediately following the teaching session, {{there was no difference between}} the control and intervention group at assessment of knot tying (p = 0 ⋅ 272). However, after one week, the intervention group performed significantly better than control participants (p= 0 ⋅ 037). Conclusions: The use of an e-textbook and the reverse classroom was shown to be both more efficient and pervasive at teaching <b>basic</b> <b>knot</b> tying skills than traditional face to face teaching sessions alone. This method of curriculum delivery could easily be expanded to other areas, with significant benefits to the education of students...|$|E

40|$|The first example ofa {{contractible}} 4 -manifold {{other than}} B 4 was constructed by Mazur [4]. That example {{was described as}} the union of S 1 X B 3 and B 2 X B 2 (the " 2 -handle") identifying the neighborhood f a knot K in •(S 1 X B 3) =- S 1 X S 2 with S 1 XB 2 C _ •(B 2 X B 2) : SIx B 2 U B 2 X S 1. The identification takes place via the "attaching map. " Any manifold constructed in this way will be contractible as long as K represents a generator of Hi(S 1 XB 3;Z). Contractible 4 -manifolds constructed by the above procedure are now referred to as Mazur manifolds and have been extensively studied. In particular, Akbulut and Kirby [2] proved that certain apparently distinct Mazur manifolds were in fact diffeomorphic. In the final section of this work it is shown that for the examples in [2] the attaching maps are in fact the same up to diffeomorphism. This observation prompted {{the question of whether}} or not a single Mazur manifold could be constructed from S 1 X B 3 by attaching the 2 -handle in two distinct ways. This paper provides such an example of a pair of diffeomorphic Mazur manifolds whose attaching maps are distinct up to diffeomorphism. Distinguishing the attaching maps mentioned above leads to an investigation of knots in S 1 X S 2. Sections 2 and 3 of this paper present results concerning the "geometric wrapping umber " ofknots in S 1 X S 2. In Section 4 some of these results are applied to distinguish the attaching mapz for the Mazur manifold constructed in Section 1. NOTATION. Throughout this paper the notation of [1] and [2] is used.

These knots are {{the result}} of habitual behaviour and individual tiers demonstrate consistency, except when certain contextual factors come into play. This survey focussed on comparing the chiralities of <b>basic</b> <b>knots</b> to those of Figure Eight Knots, which occur in case evidence and require similar tying actions. It {{is important to note that}} real-world Figure Eights are oriented relative to their working ends and are therefore chiral, whereas topological Figure Eights have no ends and are amphichiral. Data summarizing the tying habits of 184 survey respondents were collected and analysed. The majority of volunteers surveyed tied common Overhand Knots and Figure Eights of equal chirality, consistently or nearly consistently, irrespective of any general learning effect. A minority tied knots of opposite chirality. The knots tied by the remaining respondents varied, and the data suggested a potentially complex pattern which may be related to previous findings. Similar but less pronounced patterns were exhibited in the Half Hitch and Half Knot data. This information could be useful when analysing case evidence and making links to suspect samples, provided cautious attention is paid to context and knot function...|$|R
