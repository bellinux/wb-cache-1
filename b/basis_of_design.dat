5000|$|Air change {{rates are}} often used as rules of thumb in {{ventilation}} design. However, they are seldom used as the actual <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>design</b> or calculation. For example, laboratory ventilation standards indicate recommended ranges for air change rates, as a guideline for the actual design. Residential ventilation rates are calculated based on area of the residence and number of occupants. [...] Non-residential ventilation rates are based on floor area and number of occupants, or a calculated dilution of known contaminants. [...] Hospital design standards use air changes per hour, although this has been criticized.|$|E
