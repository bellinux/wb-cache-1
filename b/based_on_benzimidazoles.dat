Thus, new and more efficient treatment options are urgently needed. By employing a recently validated assay based on the release of functional phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI) from dying parasites, the activities of 26 dicationic compounds and of the (+) - and (-) -erythro-enantiomers of mefloquine were investigated. Initial screening of compounds was performed at 40 ?M, and those compounds exhibiting considerable antiparasitic activities were also assessed at lower concentrations. Of the dicationic drugs, DB 1127 (a diguanidino compound) with activities comparable to nitazoxanide was further studied. The activity of DB 1127 was dose dependent and led to severe structural alterations, as visualized by electron microscopy. The (+) - and (-) -erythro-enantiomers of mefloquine showed similar dose-dependent effects, although higher concentrations of these compounds than of DB 1127 were required for metacestode damage. In conclusion, of the drugs investigated here, the diguanidino compound DB 1127 represents the most promising compound for further study in appropriate in vivo models for Echinococcus multilocularis infection...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Transgenic {{strains of}} Caenorhabditis elegans are {{typically}} generated by injecting DNA into the germline to form multi-copy extrachromosomal arrays. These transgenes are semi-stable and their expression is silenced in the germline. Mos 1 transposon or microparticle bombardment {{methods have been}} developed to create single- or low-copy chromosomal integrated lines. Here we report an alternative method using ultraviolet trimethylpsoralen (UV/TMP) to generate single/low-copy gene integrations. Results We successfully integrated low-copy transgenes from extrachromosomal arrays using positive selection <b>based</b> <b>on</b> temperature sensitivity with a vps- 45 rescue fragment and negative selection <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>benzimidazole</b> sensitivity with a ben- 1 rescue fragment. We confirmed that the integrants express transgenes in the germline. Quantitative PCR revealed that strains generated by this method contain single- or low-copy transgenes. Moreover, positive selection marker genes flanked by LoxP sites were excised by Cre recombinase mRNA microinjection, demonstrating Cre-mediated chromosomal excision {{for the first time in}} C. elegans. Conclusion Our UV/TMP integration method, <b>based</b> <b>on</b> familiar extrachromosomal transgenics, provides a useful approach for generating single/low-copy gene integrations. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{internal}} ribosome entry site (IRES) element {{located at}} the 5 ’untranslated genomic region of various RNA viruses mediates cap-independent initiation of translation. Picornavirus IRES activity is highly dependent on both its structural organization and its interaction with host factors. Small molecules able to interfere with RNA function are valuable candidates for antiviral agents. Here we show that a small molecule <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>benzimidazole</b> (IRAB) inhibited foot-andmouth disease virus (FMDV) IRES-dependent protein synthesis in cells transfected with infectious RNA leading to a decrease of the virus titer, which was higher than that induced by a structurally related benzimidazole derivative. Interestingly, IRAB preferentially inhibited IRES-dependent translation in cell free systems in a dose-dependent manner. RNA structural analysis by SHAPE demonstrated an increased local flexibility of the IRES structure upon incubation with IRAB, which affected 3 stem-loops (SL) of domain 3. Fluorescence binding assays conducted with individual aminopurinelabeled oligoribonucleotides indicated that the SL 3 A binds IRAB (EC 18 μM). Taken together, the results derived from SHAPE reactivity and fluorescence binding assays suggested that the target site of IRAB within the FMDV IRES might be a folded RNA structure that involves the entire apical region of domain 3.

Escape mutants that confer in vitro resistance to these inhibitors map to amino acids P 495, P 496 or V 499. We here report a novel resistance mutation (T 389 S/A) that was identified following resistance selection with the benzimidazole non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitor JT- 16 in HCV Con- 1 subgenomic replicon (genotype 1 b). This JT- 16 resistant replicon retained wild-type susceptibility to protease inhibitors and nucleoside polymerase inhibitors. Replicons that carry mutations T 389 A and T 389 S have moderate levels of resistance to JT- 16 (7 - and 13 -fold, respectively). Mutation P 495 A is associated with high-level (44 -fold) resistance. Surprisingly, this previously reported 'key' mutation for benzimidazole resistance, P 495 A, was detected in only 15 % of the resistant population. Furthermore, the replication fitness of the T 389 S mutant was significantly higher than that of the P 495 A mutant. By means of molecular modeling a structural hypothesis was formulated to explain the emergence of the T 389 S/A mutation in the JT- 16 resistant replicon. Our data demonstrate that low-level resistant, but fit, variants can develop during in vitro resistance selection with the benzimidazole inhibitor JT- 16. Moreover, different substitutions to the benzimidazole scaffold can affect the (pattern of) resistance mutations that emerge during resistance selection. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.

The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of HCV is essential for viral RNA replication and is thus an excellent target for DAA. Non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitors <b>based</b> <b>on</b> a <b>benzimidazole</b> or indole scaffold have been reported. Compounds of this class can inhibit HCV replication by interacting with thumb domain 1 of the HCV polymerase. Escape mutants that confer resistance to these inhibitors in vitro map to amino acids P 495, P 496 or V 499. We report a novel resistance mutation (T 389 S/A) that was identified following resistance selection with the benzimidazole non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitor JT- 16 in a HCV genotype 1 b subgenomic replicon. Clonal sequencing analysis of the JT- 16 res replicon revealed that the T 389 S mutation was present in 60 % of all clones sequenced, whereas the P 495 A mutation was only identified in 2 clones (= 13 %). Introduction of mutations T 389 A or T 389 S into a wild-type backbone induced moderate levels of resistance to JT- 16 (7 - and 13 -fold, respectively). In contrast, P 495 A is associated with high level resistance (44 -fold). Furthermore, the replication fitness of the T 389 S mutant was significantly higher than that of P 495 A. By means of molecular modelling a structural hypothesis was formulated to explain the emergence of the T 389 S/A mutation in the JT- 16 resistant replicon. A ligplot interaction map of residue T 389 showed that T 389 makes H-bonding interactions with C 488, D 387 and K 491. Mutation of threonine 389 into an alanine or serine would disrupt this H-bonding network and possibly induce a change of rotameric state of the side chain of K 491, thereby interfering with the binding of the JT- 16 inhibitor. In conclusion, we demonstrated that less resistant, but fitter variants can develop during in vitro resistance selection with the benzimidazole inhibitor JT- 16. Surprisingly, the previously published signature mutation for benzimidazole resistance, P 495 A, was only detected in 13 % of the resistant population.

Triclabendazole was between 10 and 250 times less potent than albendazole in inducing dysmorphogenic effects in zebrafish or postimplantation rodent embryos, respectively.
