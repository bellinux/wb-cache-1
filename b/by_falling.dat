5|$|About 30 {{houses in}} San Pablo, Laguna were either {{demolished}} by strong winds or <b>by</b> <b>falling</b> coconut trees. Elsewhere, in Zambales, {{a woman was}} killed after she was struck by lighting. In Lucena City, a farmer was swept away via floods and two boys died due to fallen trees. The resort city of Legaspi suffered severe damage because hundreds of dwellings were destroyed, forcing many residents to seek shelter in schools or churches. Along {{the east coast of}} Luzon, seven people perished when hit <b>by</b> <b>falling</b> coconut trees in Quezon. Meanwhile, three casualties occurred in a fire in the province of Sorsogon. A total of 15 people drowned in the town of Sexmoan. The nearby towns of Macabebe and Masantol saw two drownings each. In the city of Manila or the provinces of Batangas, Quezon, Laguna, and Cavite, 34,000 people were displaced. Overall, damage totaled $42 million (1983 USD). Infrastructure damage totaled $31 million. However, damage to crops totaled to only $9.4 million since residents were just beginning to replant fields.|$|E
5|$|Due to high winds, {{two cars}} were crushed <b>by</b> <b>falling</b> trees, causing {{the deaths of}} two men and one 12-year-old boy. Hispaniola {{received}} heavy rain and 35mph (56km/h) winds but no deaths or damage was reported. In the Bahamas, the storm brought winds of 35mph (56km/h) but left no damage.|$|E
5|$|Gilkeson {{resided in}} Romney for the {{majority}} of his life and was involved in most of the community's organizations as either a leader, officer, or stockholder. Gilkeson's son Henry Bell Gilkeson, Jr., died on November 16, 1901, from injuries sustained <b>by</b> <b>falling</b> against a piece of sharp iron, which penetrated his stomach. Gilkeson's wife, Mary Katherine, predeceased him in February 1910 following the effects of a surgical procedure she had undergone in Cumberland, Maryland.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Isabel {{produced}} hurricane-force wind gusts throughout eastern North Carolina. The winds downed {{hundreds of}} trees, leaving up to 700,000 without power across the state. Damage from the hurricane totaled about $450million (2003USD, ($ USD)). Three {{people were killed}} in the state, a utility worker attempting to restore electricity and two <b>by</b> <b>falling</b> trees.|$|E
5|$|It was {{reported}} that Rosaviakosmos had taken out an insurance policy worth 200 million US dollars to cover damage caused <b>by</b> <b>falling</b> debris. The risk of debris from the station reaching land {{was estimated to be}} 3%. Countries located near the target zone monitored events surrounding the deorbit to determine whether precautions should be taken. In New Zealand the Satellite Reentry Committee was responsible for this, whilst Emergency Management Australia handled preparations in Australia. The head of the Japanese Defense Agency, Toshitsugu Saito, postponed a trip to the United States in case any debris fell on Japan, as the station was scheduled to pass over several Japanese islands on its final orbit. Residents of Okinawa were warned to stay indoors as the station passed overhead. Members of the South Pacific Forum requested assurance from Russia {{that they would not be}} hit <b>by</b> <b>falling</b> debris. Chan Sek Keong, the attorney general of Singapore, called for greater regulation of space debris.|$|E
5|$|Minneapolis {{was founded}} at Saint Anthony Falls, the only {{waterfall}} on the Mississippi River, {{because of the}} potential for energy created <b>by</b> <b>falling,</b> flowing water. Loring understood the city's geography—its waterfalls, lakes and river banks—and was able to use these unique aspects of his new home to slowly build his fortune.|$|E
5000|$|At the 1984 Olympics, Atiyeh's {{victories}} {{included a}} win over Vasile Pușcașu from Romania <b>by</b> <b>fall</b> in the first round. Puscassu {{went on to win}} the 1988 Olympic gold medal in the heavyweight category in Seoul, Korea. Atiyeh also beat Kartar Singh of India <b>by</b> <b>fall</b> in 33 seconds.|$|R

5|$|The {{area around}} the {{building}} was cleared of pedestrians and firefighting personnel because of falling glass and debris. The falling debris was dangerous for firefighters because they often had to cross the perimeter around the building to enter and leave the high-rise. Hose lines stretched into the building were damaged <b>by</b> <b>falling</b> debris and one firefighter was struck by debris and seriously injured while tending to the lines.|$|E
5|$|The {{criminal}} who robs {{the wrestling}} manager {{who refuses to}} pay Peter Parker for his ring performance and believed {{to be responsible for}} murdering Ben Parker when he carjacks him {{in the course of his}} escape. He dies <b>by</b> <b>falling</b> from a window when confronted by Peter. His name is Dennis Carradine, but this is not revealed until the third film.|$|E
5|$|An {{hour after}} the {{previous}} event caused destruction in Upstate New York, a new tornado family began producing significant damage in the adjacent state of Connecticut. The first tornado, {{which may have been}} three separate tornadoes, started its path of destruction in Cornwall, leveling a virgin forest known as Cathedral Pines. At the nearby Mohawk Mountain Ski Area, every ski lift was destroyed, with some lift chairs found miles away. The tornado continued south-southeast through Milton, leveling hundreds more trees, and destroyed the village of Bantam before dissipating. Strong downburst winds continued to cause damage and level trees after this tornado lifted: it was during this period between tornadoes that a 12-year-old girl was killed <b>by</b> <b>falling</b> trees in Black Rock State Park.|$|E

5|$|In January 2002, Mustaine {{was hospitalized}} {{for the removal}} of a kidney stone and was {{administered}} pain medication that triggered a relapse of his drug addiction. Following his stay, Mustaine checked himself into a treatment center in Texas, where he suffered a peculiar injury causing severe nerve damage to his left arm. The injury, induced <b>by</b> <b>falling</b> asleep with his left arm over the back of a chair, caused compression of the radial nerve. He was diagnosed with radial neuropathy, which left him unable to grasp or even make a fist with his left hand.|$|E
5|$|Keith Richards as Edward Teague: Keeper of the Pirata Codex for the Brethren Court and Jack Sparrow's father. The other pirate lords are visibly {{terrified of}} him. Richards, who {{partially}} inspired Depp's portrayal of Sparrow, {{was meant to}} appear in Dead Man's Chest, {{but there was no}} room for him in the story, as well as his being tied up with a Rolling Stones tour. He almost missed filming a scene in At World's End, following injuries sustained <b>by</b> <b>falling</b> out of a tree. In June 2006, Verbinski finally managed to make room in Richards' schedule to shoot that September.|$|E
5|$|Michael Bishop Weyland (Lance Henriksen), {{also known}} as Bishop II, is a {{scientist}} employed by Weyland-Yutani. Ripley meets him at the furnace, where he tells her that he designed the Bishop android series; his medical team will extract the Alien Queen inside her and destroy it. Ripley does not believe him, and backs away towards the furnace as he begs her {{to give him the}} creature. Aaron sneaks up behind him and strikes him with a crowbar, nearly ripping off his ear. He watches in despair as Ripley sacrifices herself <b>by</b> <b>falling</b> into the lead smelter.|$|E

5|$|On 14 February 1942, seeking {{reprisal}} {{for their}} great loss and also retaliation against retreating {{soldiers from the}} 44th Indian Brigade who had fired from Alexandra Hospital, 3 groups of Japanese soldiers went on a blind rampage and entered the hospital from the rear bayoneting everyone they found, {{regardless of whether they}} were soldiers, patients and medical staff. They killed a British officer, Lieutenant W.E.J. Weston, who was carrying a white flag to meet them. Even a young patient, Corporal Holden, who was lying on an operating table was not spared. About 200 defenceless souls were massacred. Some managed to escape death <b>by</b> <b>falling</b> to the floor and pretending to be dead.|$|E
5|$|Some {{events have}} bonus stages that add to a player's score, {{even if it}} has already reached the maximum number. In the skydiving, rocket belt, and hang glider modes, landing on moving {{platforms}} rewards players with a perfect score, and a bonus stage for extra points may be earned <b>by</b> <b>falling</b> into the water of a target area. These stages include maneuvering a diving penguin into a pool, bouncing a winged man across a series of trampolines, and flying another winged man as far as possible.|$|E
5|$|Strong ground motions {{caused many}} {{secondary}} effects, including gas leaks and widespread soil liquefaction. Consequently, sand boils emerged from asphalt roads, toppling a few cars and sinking another. Several {{houses in the}} hill suburbs of Sumner and Redcliffs were affected <b>by</b> <b>falling</b> boulders from hillsides. Following its occurrence, much of Christchurch lost water pressure; residents were thus urged to conserve water use. In {{some parts of the}} Heathcote Valley, previously dormant or non-existent natural springs surfaced {{as a consequence of the}} sudden rise in the water table, flooding some properties.|$|E

5|$|The normal {{reaction}} of a prey animal to an attacking predator is to flee by any available means, whether flying, gliding, falling, swimming, running, jumping, burrowing or rolling, {{according to the}} animal's capabilities. Escape paths are often erratic, {{making it difficult for}} the predator to predict which way the prey will go next: for example, birds such as snipe, ptarmigan and black-headed gulls evade fast raptors such as peregrine falcons with zigzagging or jinking flight. In the tropical rain forests of Southeast Asia in particular, many vertebrates escape predators <b>by</b> <b>falling</b> and gliding. Among the insects, many moths turn sharply, fall, or perform a powered dive in response to the sonar clicks of bats. Among fish, the stickleback follows a zigzagging path, often doubling back erratically, when chased by a fish-eating merganser duck.|$|E
5|$|While a grind, lip, or manual {{trick is}} underway, a balance meter appears: unless the player {{prevents}} this meter from {{falling to the}} left or right, the character will bail and need a few seconds to recover. Bailing can also be caused <b>by</b> <b>falling</b> without one's board facing downward. Completing tricks in succession without bailing is called a combo. Comboing raises the player's score and fills up the Special Meter; when it is full, the player is granted access to more elaborate tricks worth more points, such as the McTwist and 540 Flip. Underground introduces the ability to dismount one's skateboard, which allows the player to explore levels more carefully and reach new areas. Each level features at least one vehicle, usually a car, that the player can drive.|$|E
5|$|After {{three years}} as a galley slave, Judah is {{assigned}} to the flagship of the Roman Consul Quintus Arrius (Jack Hawkins), who {{has been charged with}} destroying a fleet of Macedonian pirates. Arrius admires Judah's determination and self-discipline, and offers to train him as a gladiator or charioteer. Judah declines the offer, declaring that God will aid him in his quest for vengeance. When the Roman fleet encounters the Macedonians, Arrius orders all the rowers except Judah to be chained to their oars. Arrius' galley is rammed and sunk, but Judah unchains the other rowers, and rescues Arrius. In despair, Arrius wrongly believes the battle ended in defeat and attempts to atone in the Roman way <b>by</b> <b>falling</b> on his sword, but Judah stops him. They are rescued, and Arrius is credited with the Roman fleet's victory.|$|E
