5|$|Delambre used a <b>baseline</b> {{of about}} 10km in length along a {{straight}} road, located close to Melun. In an operation taking six weeks, the <b>baseline</b> was accurately measured using four platinum rods, each of length two toise (about 3.9m). Thereafter he used, where possible, the triangulation points used by Cassini in his 1744 survey of France. Méchain's <b>baseline,</b> {{of a similar}} length, and also on a straight section of road was in the Perpignan area. Although Méchain's sector was half the length of Delambre, it included the Pyrenees and hitherto unsurveyed parts of Spain. After the two surveyors met, each computed the other's <b>baseline</b> in order to cross-check their results and they then recomputed the kilometre. Their result came out at 0.144lignes shorter than the provisional value, a difference of about 0.03%.|$|E
5|$|Early radio {{telescope}} interferometers used a single <b>baseline</b> for measurement. Later astronomical interferometers, {{such as the}} Very Large Array illustrated in Fig11, used arrays of telescopes arranged in a pattern on the ground. A limited number of baselines will result in insufficient coverage. This was alleviated by using {{the rotation of the}} Earth to rotate the array relative to the sky. Thus, a single <b>baseline</b> could measure information in multiple orientations by taking repeated measurements, a technique called Earth-rotation synthesis. Baselines thousands of kilometers long were achieved using very long <b>baseline</b> interferometry.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{examine the}} use of two superbeam {{neutrino}} oscillation experiments with <b>baselines</b> ≲ 1000  km to resolve parameter degeneracies inherent in the three-neutrino analysis of such experiments. We find that with appropriate choices of neutrino energies and <b>baselines</b> two experiments with different <b>baselines</b> can provide a much better determination of the neutrino mass ordering than a single experiment alone. Two <b>baselines</b> are especially beneficial when the mass scale for solar neutrino oscillations δm 2 sol is ≳ 5 × 10 − 5  eV 2. We also examine CP violation sensitivity and the resolution of other parameter degeneracies. We find that the combined data of superbeam experiments with <b>baselines</b> of 295 and 900  km can provide sensitivity to both the neutrino mass ordering and CP violation for sin 22 θ 13 down to 0. 03 for |δm 2 atm|≃ 3 × 10 − 3  eV 2.

40|$|Goals {{based on}} {{absolute}} targets, risk, technology, or cost are {{found throughout the}} administrative state. “Historic baselines,” {{a point in the}} past used to ground a policy goal, are just as commonplace, yet remain unexamined. Whether in budgeting or tax, criminal sentencing or environmental protection, historic <b>baselines</b> direct a wide range of agency activities. Their ubiquity begs some important questions. What makes <b>baselines</b> more attractive than other approaches for implementing regulatory goals? Conversely, when are other standard setting methods such as absolute targets and risk-based, technology-based, and cost-based standards more useful to policy makers than historic <b>baselines?</b> Unless one believes that policy makers choose between the alternative approaches randomly, or that it simply does not matter which they choose, each approach requires a clear theoretical understanding in order to make better choices and predict the comparative potential for success and failure. This Article is the first to examine historic <b>baselines.</b> Using examples from environmental and land use regulation, this Article examines the attributes, design issues, and strategic uses and abuses of historic <b>baselines.</b> Part I unpacks the structure and design of historic <b>baselines,</b> identifying four core attributes and examining the design issues particular to each to demonstrate the different forms historic <b>baselines</b> can take. Part II explores the attractiveness of historic <b>baselines</b> to policy makers and the conditions under which they may be preferable to using absolute standards or risk-based, technology-based, or cost-based standards. Part III explores the opportunities for rent seeking in more detail, delving into the gaming possibilities created by historic <b>baselines.</b> Part IV then provides a practical context by examining the role of historic <b>baselines</b> in climate change policy. The demand for action will require policy makers to consider a wide array of regulatory goals for controlling greenhouse gas emissions, sequestering carbon from the atmosphere, and adapting to climate change impacts that cannot be avoided. The analysis in Parts I, II and III speaks directly to this issue, explaining why historic <b>baselines</b> will prove effective in certain applications but decidedly problematic in others...|$|R

40|$|This article explores {{in detail}} the {{attributes}} and operation of historic <b>baselines.</b> That historic <b>baselines</b> are found throughout regulatory law is no accident. Particularly when the policy goal involves turning back the clock or halting an undesirable trend, historic <b>baselines</b> have distinct advantages compared to alternative techniques for standard setting. These advantages include rhetoric, familiarity, and flexibility. The use of the temporal reference point {{lies at the heart}} of what makes historic <b>baselines</b> distinct in this respect, yet it is also what makes them qualitatively different for purposes of gaming. Leveraging the past provides an additional dimension to the gaming potential found in other techniques, such as technology- or cost-based goals. This very attraction, however, equally limits historic <b>baselines</b> in some contexts. This limitation is most evident in climate change adaptation policy, where <b>baselines</b> simply do not easily fit because the policy goal is fundamentally about resetting the clock, not turning it back. There is no past to leverage when it comes to climate change adaptation. This may be true in other cases where massively transformative forces are at work, such as with the global financial crisis. Going back to the past may be appealing in these settings, but it is ultimately infeasible. Policymakers reaching for a more forward-looking policy thus should eye warily the appeal to the past embedded in historic <b>baselines...</b>|$|R
