5|$|While {{the number}} of losses {{incurred}} against German night fighters was not significantly large the psychological damage was substantial. A high number of crashes owed much to nervous British bomber pilots who did not feel safe over their own airfields and consequently landed too hard and fast or refused to go around a second time for fear of enemy intruders. Just as it appeared night intruder sorties were showing promise Adolf Hitler ordered a cessation of operations. For propaganda purposes, {{he thought that the}} morale of the German people would <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>served</b> <b>by</b> seeing British bombers destroyed and wrecked over German territory. Hitler was also reticent owing the fact there had been no noticeable reduction in British air raids and the RAF had not adopted these methods during The Blitz. This order came into effect on 12 October 1941. Kammhuber would unsuccessfully lobby to have intruder operations reinstated and his efforts to expand the intruder force beyond a single unit were thwarted by an uninterested High Command which was inundated with requests for reinforcements in other theatres.|$|E

25|$|Langston {{was twice}} {{threatened}} with destruction in the 1960s. In 1964, Washington, D.C., officials proposed closing {{the first nine}} holes of Langston Golf Course and building the Barney Circle Freeway on the land, but the National Park Service (which owned and managed the island at the time) refused {{to turn over the}} land to the city. In 1969, the city of Washington proposed closing all of Langston Golf Course and building extensive low-income public housing on the golf course and the rest of Kingman Island. The National Park Service rejected that plan as well. Perhaps the biggest threat to the course was a study by the Park Service in the mid-1960s which called for a new federally owned golf course to be built at Oxon Cove Park and Oxon Hill Farm (just over the District line in Maryland). This study showed that D.C. golfers would <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>served</b> <b>by</b> the new course, and that Langston should be closed. But by 1977, the Oxon Cove course had yet to be built, and the plan died.|$|E

Nogueira agreed that Reedman's words were provocative, but said Portugal {{could not be}} blamed as it did not censor public broadcasts. Britain considered withdrawing Ross in protest, but its Foreign Office ruled this out, saying Britain {{could not afford to}} be without an ambassador in Lisbon to influence Portugal's actions in the event of UDI. British Cabinet Secretary Burke Trend rejected this view, pointing to Lisbon's conduct regarding Reedman, which he said showed the Portuguese [...] "ha very clearly made up their minds" [...] to support a Rhodesian UDI. The British ambassador {{would not be able to}} affect matters, he surmised, and British interests would <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>served</b> <b>by</b> immediately taking a firm hand against Portugal, in the hope that this would send a strong message to Rhodesia. Ross then protested to the Portuguese about Reedman's calling himself [...] "head of the Rhodesian diplomatic mission" [...] on the radio; Lisbon replied impassively that this was a private expression of views by Reedman, and not Portugal's responsibility.|$|E
500|$|At the time, the Dutch {{naval force}} in the NEI, the Dutch Squadron in the East Indies, was widely seen as inadequate.

In response to the perceived threat of Japanese attack, the Dutch laid down a coastal defense ship, , and eight destroyers of the , while beginning plans for other ships. In addition, a submarine for the colony was approved in 1911. Four coast defense ships were projected in one of the two major bills to come before the House of Representatives in 1912. Specifications for these ships included an armament of four 280-mm (11-inch) and ten 102-mm (4-inch) guns and three torpedo tubes and they would have been armored with a belt of 152-mm (6-inch) and turret armor of 203mm (8inches). Two triple-expansion engines generating 10,000indicated horsepower would drive the ships through the water at [...] One ship of this design was very close to being authorized in 1912, but it was felt by experts and the House of Representatives that the Netherlands would <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>served</b> <b>by</b> constructing dreadnoughts of a type similar to the Spanish [...] Further plans for coast-defense ships were shelved pending the findings of a Royal Commission, formed on 5 June 1912.

500|$|The geopolitical {{situation}} tilted further against Smith in December 1974 when the South African Prime Minister BJ Vorster pressured him into accepting a détente initiative involving the Frontline States of Zambia, Tanzania and Botswana (Mozambique and Angola {{would join the}} following year). Vorster had concluded that Rhodesia's position was untenable and that South African interests would <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>served</b> <b>by</b> collaborating with black African governments over a Rhodesian settlement; he hoped that success in this might win South Africa some international legitimacy {{and allow it to}} retain apartheid. Détente forced a ceasefire, giving the guerrillas time to regroup, and required the Rhodesians to release the ZANU and ZAPU leaders so they could attend a conference in Rhodesia, united under the UANC banner and led by Muzorewa. When Rhodesia stopped releasing black nationalist prisoners on the grounds that ZANLA and ZIPRA were not observing the ceasefire, Vorster harried Smith further by withdrawing the South African Police, which had been helping the Rhodesians patrol the countryside. Smith remained stubborn, saying {{in the run-up to the}} conference that [...] "We have no policy in Rhodesia to hand over to a black majority government" [...] and that his government instead favoured [...] "a qualified franchise for all Rhodesians... ensure that government will be retained in responsible hands for all times".|$|E
500|$|Shocked by the Supreme Court's {{decision}} and under strong {{pressure from the}} BIA, Congress passed the Major Crimes Act in response. The Major Crimes Act placed seven serious felony offenses (with amendments over the years, now fifteen) {{under the jurisdiction of}} the federal government. [...] Those wishing to assimilate Indians into mainstream white society wanted to do away with the [...] "heathen" [...] tribal laws and apply white laws to the tribes. [...] The BIA had also been attempting since 1874 to extend federal jurisdiction over major crimes to reservations, without any success. Beginning in 1882, the Indian Rights Association (IRA) also tried to extend federal jurisdiction, but in a different manner. The IRA believed that the tribes would <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>served</b> <b>by</b> a completely separate court system, modeled after U.S. courts and called agency courts. The only appeal would be to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs. [...] The BIA opposed that approach, preferring to try only major crimes in the nearest federal court. Ex parte Crow Dog provided the BIA a perfect example of why this was needed, along with an incident involving Spotted Tail's son, Spotted Tail, Jr., in which the younger Spotted Tail participated in a fight during which three Brulé were killed. The younger Spotted Tail was also confined pending murder charges, and it took a direct order of the Secretary of the Interior for the local BIA agents to comply with the Supreme Court decision before he was released. The BIA also implemented regulations in 1883 criminalizing traditional tribal practices such as war dances and polygamy. [...] Between the BIA's efforts and the IRA efforts, the law was passed in 1885, making seven offenses federal crimes. [...] Many members of the Indian tribes were bitter with this outcome for decades afterwards.
