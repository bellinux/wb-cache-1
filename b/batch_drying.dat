The batch dryers are usually {{operating}} under this sequence and repeating this sequence for several times. The bin-batch drying methods employ a full perforated floor as the dryer. Without stirring, large variety of equipment is available and the batch {{can be used as}} both dryer and cooler, but there may be large moisture gradient from top to bottom and losing time in loading and unloading process. When adding stirring system, unequilibrium moisture content problem is avoided, however, stirrer is an added expense. When using bin-batch roof dryer, time losing problem can be solved. There is a drying floor under the bin roof and the drying fan and burner is installed high on the bin wall. When the drying process is completed, grain is put in the regular bin floor, thus unloading time is reduced. However, there is no wet grain holding in bin-batch roof dryers and there is more expense on machines.|$|E

The <b>batch</b> <b>drying</b> experiments were conducted to establish the drying kinetics of ragi mimicking the conditions in the continuous fluidized bed.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to establish whether commercial sources of dried blood meals available in New Zealand offer useful sources of digestible protein for chinook salmon. Three blood meals were evaluated to assess their suitability as ingredients in salmon feed. In vitro digestibility was determined using the pepsin and pronase digestibility assays. In vivo digestibility was determined by feeding diets to chinook salmon formulated to contain 20 % <b>dried</b> blood meal (<b>batch</b> <b>dried,</b> ring dried or spray dried), and 80 % of a basal diet and by correcting for the digestible protein supplied by the basal diet. Chromic oxide was included in the diets as an indigestible marker. The apparent digestibilities of crude protein and amino acids were determined based on samples of faeces collected after 7 days of feeding the respective test diet to chinook salmon. Feces were collected by a manual stripping of the hindgut. Crude protein contents were uniformly high, at 92. 0 %, 93. 1 % and 89. 6 % for the batch, ring and spray dried blood meals respectively. Amino acid contents were also generally high, with the exception of the essential amino acid methionine. All crude protein digestibility determinations ranked the blood meals as: spray dried > ring <b>dried</b> > <b>batch</b> <b>dried.</b> In vitro N digestibility values determined by pronase assay were 60. 5 %, 25. 5 % and 9. 0 % for spray, ring and <b>batch</b> <b>dried</b> bloods, respectively. The pronase assay yielded significantly (P< 0. 001) higher digestibility values than did the pepsin assay in the case of ring and spray dried blood meals, corresponding values for crude protein digestibility with the pepsin assay were 27. 8 %, 18. 9 % and 8. 4 % for spray, ring and <b>batch</b> <b>dried</b> bloods, respectively. The in vivo apparent faecal digestibility of protein in the dried blood meals determined in the chinook salmon were highest for the spray dried blood meal (68. 4 %), lower in ring dried blood meal (46. 3 %), and very low in the <b>batch</b> <b>dried</b> blood meal. The amino acid digestibilities were similarly ranked, with the difference between ring and spray dried blood meal being statistically significant for 9 of 17 assayed amino acids (P< 0. 05). A secondary aim of the study was an evaluation of the laboratory rat as a model animal for determining protein digestibility in the chinook salmon. <b>Batch</b> <b>dried</b> blood meal was fed to rats in an experimental design closely following that set for the chinook salmon, and the apparent digestibility of nitrogen and amino acids were determined based on sampling of ileal digesta. Ileal crude protein digestibility for this <b>batch</b> <b>dried</b> blood meal in the rat was also very low (3. 9 %), suggesting that the rat may be a suitable model animal for prediction of protein digestibility in chinook salmon. Differences in the protein digestibility of the blood meals appeared to be inversely related to the time spent in processing and drying. It appears that spray and ring dried blood meals may be suitable for inclusion in chinook salmon diets in partial replacement of fishmeal proteins.

40|$|Grass is an {{excellent}} energy crop; it may be classified as a high yielding, low energy input, perennial crop. Over 90 % of Irish agricultural land is under grass; thus farmers are familiar with, and comfortable with, this crop {{as opposed to a}} "new energy crop" such as Miscanthus. Of issue therefore is not the crop, but the methodology of generating energy from the crop. Numerous farmers across Europe (in particular Germany and Austria) use grass silage as a feedstock for biogas production; in a number of cases the produced biogas is scrubbed to biomethane and used as a transport fuel or injected into the natural gas grid. Many Irish farmers are considering converting from conventional farming such as beef production to grass biomethane production.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Batch</b> {{anaerobic}} <b>dry</b> digestion promises {{further application}} in agriculture and {{for treatment of}} municipal solid waste, especially with smaller substrate throughputs. As in other anaerobic systems, bacteriological activity is inhibited by lack of moisture and in <b>batch</b> <b>dry</b> digestion liquid is sprinkled over the substrate to encourage biomass degradation and biogas production throughout the process. Laboratory-scale experiments were carried out to investigate individual methane generation from the recirculated liquid phase and from the stacked solid material. Results clearly indicate that methane formation within the recirculated liquid significantly adds to the total methane production of the process. Up to 21 % of the total methane generation originated from the recirculated liquid. This suggests that methane generation from the liquid phase {{is not to be}} neglected and needs to be recuperated. The process water tank should be equipped with gas collection facilities. Experimental results further indicate that higher ratios of easily hydrolysable substrates increase the proportion of methane from the liquid phase while slowly hydrolysable material encourages biogas generation in the decomposing biomass bed itself. While the amount of easily hydrolysable biomass in the system and the ratio of methane produced in the liquid phase could be positively correlated, no correlation was possible between the volume of liquid in the process water tank and the methane proportion originating from the liquid phase...|$|R

This study develops a climate-based systems simulation model to investigate the economics of high moisture grain harvesting in Australia. The optimum harvesting and drying strategies were determined. The role of grain aeration cooling was also examined. The model software was developed in MATLAB. This model was run on an hourly basis using 15 years of historical weather data (1991 - 2005) for three main wheat production areas in Australia, represented by Goondiwindi (QLD), Tamworth (NSW) and Scaddan (WA). The Wheat Harvest System Simulation Model (WHSSM) consists of four submodels of weather data, machinery performance, crop loss and economic calculations. Each submodel is represented by mathematical functions and supported by available theoretical and field data. The weather submodel is used to predict dynamic grain moisture contents for a standing crop in the field. Machinery submodel was developed to calculate machinery performance and its operating costs at different grain and weather conditions. The main machinery involved are combine harvester, cooling aerator, and four categories of grain driers. Crop loss submodel is used to quantify grain losses involved during harvest and storage periods, including shedding (yield) losses, header losses, threshing losses, crop quality downgrading losses (due to rainfalls), and storage spoilage losses.
