40|$|Muscari neglectum Guss. Ex Ten, is an ornamental, {{herbaceous}} perennial {{plant species}} that {{grows in the}} Mediterranean countries with attractive and scented blue-colored flowers. The plant has low seed output, seed dormancy, low germination and propagation rates. This study aimed to develop a reliable microclonal propagation protocol for M. neglectum using TDZ (Thidiazuron) -NAA (α Naphthalene acetic acid) to induce <b>bulblets,</b> roots, and acclimatization of the regenerated <b>bulblets.</b> Maximum number of <b>bulblets</b> per explant (8. 25 ± 0. 05) was noted on MS medium containing 0. 0454 µM TDZ- 5. 37 µM NAA.

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{problems}} of Hippeastrum is {{the large amount of}} labor involved in its production. There are three common methods for the propagation of the Hippeastrum: Seeds, offset <b>bulblets</b> and twin scaling. Study on various cutting methods for the propagation of Hippeastrum was conducted in the Northern Israeli Negev Desert during two consecutive years. Fewer <b>bulblets</b> were developed when the mother bulb was divided into un-separated sections, compared to twin scales. Increasing the number of sections into which the bulb was divided resulted in larger number of <b>bulblets.</b> No correlation between the number of sections and the average weight of <b>bulblets</b> was found. The total weight of all the <b>bulblets</b> derived from one bulb, doubled after one growing year. Propagation coefficient, defined as the ratio between the <b>bulblets</b> number to the number of section into which the bulb was divided, was larger than one unit when the bulbs were cut into un-separated sections and smaller than one unit when the twin scaling method was used. Higher economic profit was found when the bulbs were divided into un-separated sections. By using the un-separated section method, it was possible to receive bulbs ready for marketing one year sooner, when compared to the twin scaling method. The greatest economical profit is expected when the mother bulb was divided into eight un-separated sections...|$|R

50|$|Many ferns {{depend on}} {{associations}} with mycorrhizal fungi. Many ferns only grow within specific pH ranges; for instance, the climbing fern (Lygodium palmatum) of eastern North America will only grow in moist, intensely acid soils, while the <b>bulblet</b> bladder fern (Cystopteris bulbifera), with an overlapping range, is only found on limestone.|$|E
5000|$|True twin-scaling {{involves}} further subdivision of {{the chips}} to create pairs of scales, joined {{together by a}} small part of the basal plate. The twin-scales are then treated with fungicide before being mixed with moist, sterile Vermiculite, sealed in plastic bags and left in a fairly warm, dark location until new bulblets form.

50|$|The {{bed rock}} is gneiss, and rounded gneiss ridges {{alternate}} with valleys filled with glacial till. Although the soils are therefore acidic, and shallow, {{the presence of}} certain plants that require calcium, such as yellow lady slipper and <b>bulblet</b> bladder fern, indicate {{that some of the}} glacial till may contain marble from landscapes further north in the county. The east side of the property lay beneath the Champlain Sea, and so has clay deposits rather than till; some of these clay plains are covered in thick organic deposits. This produces a flat, poorly drained landscape. The shoreline of the Champlain sea can still be recognized as it meanders from north east to south west across the property.|$|E
40|$|Bolting and scaly leaf {{emergence}} of Easter lily <b>bulblets</b> were investigated in the scaling fields for commercial bulb production. Leaf emergence ratio and bolting one were presented as {{the ratio of}} scale <b>bulblets</b> with leaves to the whole ones belonging to the investigated plot and as the ratio of bolted <b>bulblets</b> to scale <b>bulblets</b> provided with leaves, respectively. Findings are as follows; 1) Bolitng ratio was over 80 % with most of plots. 2) There could not be observed any differences at all among cultivars, scaling localities, dates of scaling as well as among kinds of soil texture. 3) In a few plots there was a tendency that a low leaf emergence ratio accompanied a low bolting ratio, and in other plots, the higher one the higher bolting ratio. 4) Scaly leaves appeared quite abundantly in cases where scales or <b>bulblets</b> had been half and/or fully exposed to the air in nursery beds. From these facts it is duly suggested that the scaly leaf emergence will occur comparatively earlier than the bolting, and also that the darkness can promote the bolting, and the light will, in turn, hasten the scaly leaf emergence. りん片繁殖によるテッポウユリの球根生産を目的とした圃場を対象とし,仔球の抽台およびりん片葉発生の実態を調査し,これらの発生と外的条件との関係を調べた. ほとんどの圃場で 80 %以上の抽台率がみられ,品種,調査地,植付け期,土性による差異は認められなかつた. 出葉率の低い区では抽台率が低く,出葉率の高い区では逆にそれが高くなる傾向がみられた. また,りん片葉の発生は仔球や母りん片が地表に露出している場合に多い傾向が認められた. これらの事実から,りん片葉の発生は相対的に抽台より早くおこること,母りん片を浅植えして地表に露出させることによつて,りん片葉の発生が促進され,またりん片葉の割合も多くなるのに対し,深植えすることによつて抽台が期待されることが明らかである...|$|R

50|$|Several factors {{contribute}} to the biodiversity of Bartholomew's Cobble. First, the region is so spacially and climatically located that it contains a number of species that reach the northern or southern limit of their range in North America. Second, the property {{is located at the}} boundary of two distinct state bioregions: the marble valley lowlands of The Berkshires geology and the Taconic uplands. Third, the Cobbles, twin rocky knolls abutting the Housatonic River, are composed of quartzite, an acidic rock, and marble, an alkaline (calcareous) rock. This produces high variation in soil chemistry, which in turn supports species of ferns and other plants that do not normally grow in close proximity to one another. Fern species include the walking fern, maidenhair spleenwort, mountain spleenwort, maidenhair fern, <b>bulblet</b> fern, marginal woodfern, polypody, ostrich fern, and evergreen woodfern. Flowering plant species include red columbine, herb Robert, northern prickly ash, bloodroot, spring beauty, bergamot, mayapple, and round-lobed hepatica.|$|E
50|$|The Nine Mile Creek {{corridor}} {{supports a}} high diversity of plants {{due to a}} temperate climate, wide range of wetland and terrestrial habitats, nutritious limestone bedrock, and floodplain soils. In total, some 142 different species of plants have been documented in the Nine Mile Creek corridor and its associated wetlands. Ninety-two of these species are commonly occurring throughout the Nine Mile Creek corridor, whereas the other 49 occur in specific locations along the creek. In terms of variation in plant communities along the creek, there is a rather uniform floral composition from the outlet of Otisco Lake to Masters Road. Dense herbivorous vegetation and numerous layers of forest canopy typify it. A mix of herbaceous and woody vegetation provides robust riparian buffers. This area is home {{to many of the}} 92 commonly seen plant species observed in the Nine Mile Creek area, and is also home to protected ferns and such protected or rarely seen plants as cardinal flower, button bush, speckled alder, and mild water pepper. From Masters Road to the Village center, there is vegetation similar to that in the upper sections. However, additional species include Scotch pine and butternut, both of which are occasionally seen in the area. This section includes the only regulated wetland in the town of Marcellus, MAR-11, that is located within the flood plain of Nine Mile Creek. The flora of this wetland includes blue flag, crack willow, hardstem bulrush, numerous sedges (Carex sp.) and dogwoods (Cornus sp.). Due east of the DEC parking area at Marcellus Falls and along the Nine Mile Creek corridor are steep slopes and a group of important springs which drain into the creek. The area is of considerable botanical interest. In 1983, the Adirondack Wildflower Club documented the flora north of the town center by walking down the old Martisco Railroad bed. Aside from documenting all of the 92 commonly seen species in the creek corridor, the club noted the presence of the following state protected plants: large-flowered trillium, stinking Benjamin or wake-robin, bloodroot, fancy (toothed) wood fern, fragile fern and <b>bulblet</b> fern. Also present here were trees not observed in other sections of the creek: northern white cedar, American sycamore, eastern hemlock and yellow birch.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. An {{in vitro}} culture system for Lilium auratum Lindl. zygotic embryos was {{established}} to accelerate the development of <b>bulblets.</b> High rates of germination were observed on 50 days after pollination (DAP) or later, while the rate of normal growth increased after 70 DAP. Peeling of the seed coats was necessary for rapid in vitro germination, indicating inhibition by the seed coats. We found that embryos obtained from 90 DAP capsules were the best materials for suppressing dormancy. Further development of <b>bulblets</b> was accelerated by culturing them {{in the presence of}} 9 % sucrose. In this culture system, the period for development of mature <b>bulblets</b> was reduced from a couple of years to one year after pollination...|$|R
40|$|Bulb size is an {{important}} factor determining phase change in Lilium: phase change only occurs in <b>bulblets</b> over a certain threshold weight. After phase change has occurred, <b>bulblets</b> sprout with a stem with many leaves. Juvenile <b>bulblets</b> sprout with only a few leaves. The factors contributing to bulb size were studied during in vitro regeneration of <b>bulblets</b> on scale segments. The larger the explants, the larger the regenerated <b>bulblets.</b> Explant size influenced bulb growth during the complete culture period. Bulb growth was stimulated by a high sucrose concentration. The contribution of the medium and the explant reserves to bulb growth were studied in large and small explants using labelled sucrose. Sucrose was mainly taken up through the cut surfaces. In freshly cut explants, the rate of uptake was correlated with the size of the contact area, but at later stages, when regenerating organs were present, the difference in uptake rate of small and large explants almost disappeared. Small explants had a larger sink activity than large ones. Explants with regenerating organs took up more sucrose than freshly cut explants. Sucrose uptake and bulb growth were rather constant in the later phases and doubled when the sucrose concentration was doubled. Partitioning of label from the sucrose over the various organs, was also rather constant in time: approximately 25 % was accumulated in the <b>bulblets,</b> 35 - 45 % in the explant and 30 - 35 % was converted to CO 2. About half of the label in the explant was recovered at the proximal side where regeneration takes place. Sucrose, once incorporated in the storage pools in the explant, either remained in the explant or was converted to CO 2. Redistribution to the growing <b>bulblets</b> hardly occurred. The percentage of bulb growth that could be attributed to uptake of medium components was constant over the regeneration period: 45 - 50 % for large and 65 - 75 % for small explants...|$|R
40|$|To {{optimise}} {{conditions for}} micropropagating Galanthus species, a basal medium (G) was developed based on mineral analyses of G. nivalis, G. nivalis 'Flore Pleno' and G. elwesii bulbs.

The efficacy of G medium in supporting <b>bulblet</b> initiation on bulb chip explants, <b>bulblet</b> multiplication (on media supplemented with 30 g l(- 1) sucrose, 1. 0 mg l(- 1) 6 -benzylaminopurine and 0. 1 mg l(- 1) naphthalene acetic acid), and <b>bulblet</b> growth (on plant growth regulator-free media with 60 g C sucrose and 5 g C activated charcoal) was compared with MS medium over a range of dilutions (full-, 1 / 2 -, 1 / 4 -, and 1 / 8 -strength). <b>Bulblet</b> initiation was superior on G medium for G. nivalis and G. nivalis 'Flore Pleno', but inferior for G. elwesii. The choice of basal medium did not influence <b>bulblet</b> multiplication, although multiplication was reduced on both media diluted to 1 / 8 -strength. G medium supported <b>bulblet</b> growth and rooting better than MS medium, while dilution of either medium reduced <b>bulblet</b> growth and rooting.
