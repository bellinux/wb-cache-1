500|$|Einarr's brother Hallad {{was unable}} to {{maintain}} control in Orkney due to the predations of Danish pirates. He resigned his earldom and returned to Norway as a common landholder, which [...] "everyone thought was a huge joke." [...] Hallad's failure led to Rognvald flying into a rage and summoning his sons Thorir and Hrolluag. He asked which of them wanted the islands but Thorir said the decision {{was up to the}} earl himself. Rognvald predicted that Thorir's path would keep him in Norway and that Hrolluag was destined seek his fortune in Iceland. Einarr, the youngest of the natural sons, then came forward and offered to go to the islands. Rognvald said: [...] "Considering the kind of mother you have, slave-born on each side of her family, you are not likely to make much of a ruler. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree,</b> the sooner you leave and the later you return the happier I'll be." ...|$|E

2500|$|On December 23, Go Daddy withdrew {{its support}} for SOPA, {{releasing}} a statement saying [...] "Go Daddy will support it when and if the Internet community supports it."

60|$|He {{told me on}} {{the phone}} that night that he had made the price two {{thousand}} pounds, because he needed the money, and what was two thousand to {{a man who had been}} fleecing the widow and the orphan for forty odd years without a break?

5000|$|Upon {{its release}} on June 20, 1967, Don't Make Waves {{received}} generally mixed reviews.

In American Prince, his 2009 autobiography, Tony Curtis wrote of making Don't Make Waves, [...] "The plot was utterly ridiculous, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> {{to appear in the}} film because I got a percentage of the gross."

60|$|It {{would be}} equally presumptuous and {{unreasonable}} should I, with a late writer on this subject, “exhort {{the reader to}} be particularly on his guard against loose and indefinite expressions;” <b>but</b> <b>I</b> perfectly <b>agree</b> {{that they are the}} bane of all science, and have been remarkably injurious in the different departments of physiology.|$|R
