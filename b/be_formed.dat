5|$|Carbon is {{the fourth}} most {{abundant}} chemical element in the universe by mass after hydrogen, helium, and oxygen. Carbon is abundant in the Sun, stars, comets, and in the atmospheres of most planets.

5|$|Fermium is a {{synthetic}} element with symbol Fm and atomic number 100. It {{is a member}} of the actinide series.

A total of 19 isotopes are known, with 257Fm being the longest-lived with a half-life of 100.5 days.|$|E
