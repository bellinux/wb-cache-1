50|$|Sansevieria trifasciata is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the family Asparagaceae, native to tropical West Africa from Nigeria east to the Congo. It is most {{commonly known as the}} snake plant, mother-in-law's tongue, and viper's <b>bowstring</b> <b>hemp,</b> among other names.|$|E
50|$|Like {{some other}} members of its genus, S. trifasciata yields <b>bowstring</b> <b>hemp,</b> a strong plant fiber once used to make bowstrings.It is now used {{predominantly}} as an ornamental plant, outdoors in warmer climates, and indoors as a houseplant in cooler climates. It is popular as a houseplant because it is tolerant of low light levels and irregular watering; during winter it needs only one watering every couple of months. It will rot easily if overwatered. The NASA Clean Air Study found S. trifasciata has air purification qualities, removing 4 of the 5 main toxins. By using the crassulacean acid metabolism process, {{it is one of}} the few plants which also remove carbon dioxide at night.|$|E
50|$|Ekka leaves (in Kannada), {{are also}} known as Arka (in Sanskrit, meaning a ray or flash of lightning) leaves, Jilledu in Telugu, Erukku in Tamil and Calotropis Gigantea (<b>bowstring</b> <b>hemp)</b> in English. Arka is also a synonym for Surya or Sun. Its {{significance}} to Sun God could {{be compared to the}} significance of Tulsi (Ocimum tenuiflorum) leaves to Vishnu. Arka leaves are also used for worship of god Ganesha known by the name Arka Ganesha and also for Hanuman worship. Its stems, called samidha (sacrificial offerings of wood) are used for the Yagna ritual as a sacrificial offering to a ritual fire. Its shape is said to represent the shoulders and chariot of Sun God. Its use during the ritualistic ceremonious bath involves placement of seven leaves - one on the head, two on the shoulders, two on the knees and two on the feet.On this day, in South India, Rangoli is drawn with coloured rice powder depicting a chariot and seven horses as symbolic of the Ratha Saptami. Cowdung cake is also burnt at the centre of this depiction and milk boiled on the fire is offered to the Sun God.In some of the important Vaishnavite temples such as the Tirumala, Srirangam, Srirangapattana and Melukote, Ratha Saptami is one of the important festivals of the year. Annual Car Festival of Lord Veera Venkatesha of Sri Venkatramana Temple in Mangalore is held on this day and is famously known as Kodial Teru or Mangaluru Rathotsava.|$|E
40|$|Tamil, Indian <b>bowstring</b> <b>hemp</b> in English is a {{herbaceous}} perennial {{plant with}} short fleshy stem and stout rootstock, occurring in eastern coastal region of India. The stem part (rhizome) {{of this species}} is used to heal wounds in animals and also used to treat toothache. The rhizomes are mucilaginous and used in consumptive complaints, long lasting chronic persistent coughs, for quick relief of common cough and cold, in ear pain. Despite these uses, no published works are available for the antimicrobial property of stem part of this plant. Hence in the present study, an attempt {{has been made to}} access its therapeutic potential. The study was therefore aimed to investigate the antibacterial effects of ethanolic extracts of rhizome of S. roxburghiana against gram negative bacteria such as Salmonella Typhi, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. The pathogens were tested by disc diffusion assay method and minimum inhibitory concentration was evaluated. An attempt has been made to compare the activity of extract with standard ciprofloxin...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{proximate}} and phytochemical {{composition of}} Sansevieria liberica Gérôme and Labroy leaves was investigated. The proximate composition includes moisture (56. 10 %), crude fibre (5. 88 % wet weight and 13. 39 % dry weight), total carbohydrate (4. 09 % wet weight and 9. 32 % dry weight), crude protein (21. 88 % wet weight and 49. 84 % dry weight), total ash (2. 95 % wet weight and 6. 72 % dry weight), crude lipid (0. 10 % wet weight and 0. 23 % dry weight) and caloric value (104. 78 % wet weight and 238. 68 % dry weight). The phytochemical screening revealed {{the presence of}} alkaloids, carotenoids, flavonoids (catechins and flavones), phytates, saponins and tannins; with 0. 72 % wet weight and 1. 64 % dry weight carotenoids, 2. 20 % wet weight and 5. 01 % dry weight phytates, 0. 40 % wet weight and 0. 91 % dry weight saponins, and 0. 01 % wet weight and 0. 02 % dry weight tannins. This result support the medicinal use of the plant, and in addition, unveils the possibility of its acting as a potential source of food nutrients and nutraceuticals. @ JASEM Sansevieria liberica (family Agavaceae, Ruscaceae or Dracaenaceae), {{is one of the}} <b>bowstring</b> <b>hemp</b> species (Evans, 2005), with concave, short petioled leaves that are in part transversely banded with light and dark green, also linearly striated with whitish to ligh...|$|E
