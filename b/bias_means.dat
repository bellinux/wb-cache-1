5000|$|This is {{the result}} of the action of a {{recombination}} enhancer (RE) [...] located on the left arm of chromosome III. Deletion of this region causes a cells to incorrectly repair using HMR. In a cells, Mcm1 binds to the RE and promotes recombination of the HML region. In α cells, the α2 factor binds at the RE and establishes a repressive domain over RE such that recombination is unlikely to occur. An innate <b>bias</b> <b>means</b> that the default behaviour is repair from HMR. The exact mechanisms of these interactions are still under investigation.|$|E

50|$|Since {{the engine}} is {{typically}} the heaviest component of the car, putting it near the rear axle usually results in more weight over the rear axle than the front, {{commonly referred to as}} a rear weight bias. The farther back the engine, the greater the bias. Typical weight bias for an FR (front engine, rear drive), is 55/45 front/rear; for MR, 45/55; for RR, 35/65. A static rear weight requires less forward brake bias, as load is more evenly distributed among all four wheels under braking. Similarly, a rear weight <b>bias</b> <b>means</b> that the driven wheels have increased traction when accelerating, allowing them to put more power on the ground and accelerate faster.|$|E
50|$|First, the aggrandisement of {{biological}} research creates a false impression {{both inside and}} outside the profession of the credibility of the evidence used to justify drug treatments for disorders such as depression and schizophrenia. Reading clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of depression, for example, such as that produced for the UK National Health Service by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), one might be fooled into believing that the evidence for the efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) is established beyond question. In reality this is not the case, as re-examinations of drug trial data in meta-analyses, especially where unpublished data are included (publication <b>bias</b> <b>means</b> that researchers and drug companies do not publish negative findings for obvious commercial reasons), have revealed that most of the benefits seen in active treatment groups are also seen in the placebo groups.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of display characteristics on the bias of estimates of whisker length of {{two different types of}} box-and-whisker plots. To test the hypothesis that the <b>bias</b> <b>means</b> of estimates of whisker length were significantly different for the experimental and control groups, a 2. 234 mixed design was utilized. Notched box-and-whisker plots and regular box-and-whisker plots were levels of the between-subjects factor, while within-subjects factors were the interquartile spread, whisker length, and spatial orientation of the graphs. Results indicate that although {{there was no significant difference}} in the <b>bias</b> <b>means</b> associated with the two types of plots, bias seems to be the product of a three-way interaction between spatial orientation, interquartile spread, and whisker!spread ratio.

40|$|Predictions of {{nitrous acid}} from the Community Multiscale Air Quality {{modeling}} system are {{compared with the}} measurements from the 2001 Northeast Oxidant and Particle Study. Four different sources of nitrous acid were considered in the study: gas-phase reactions, direct emissions, a heterogeneous reaction, and a surface photolysis reaction. When only gas-phase reactions were considered in the model, the diurnally averaged <b>mean</b> <b>bias,</b> the normalized <b>mean</b> <b>bias,</b> the root <b>mean</b> square error, and the normalized mean error of the model were 1. 01 ppbv, 98 %, 1. 05 ppbv, and 98 %, respectively.

Model {{results suggest that the}} heterogeneous reaction and the surface photolysis reaction are the most important sources of nitrous acid in the atmosphere, accounting for about 86 % of the predicted nitrous acid. Emissions and the gas-phase reactions were relatively minor sources and accounted for only 14 % of the predicted nitrous acid. Model predictions suggest that the heterogeneous reaction is the most significant source of nitrous acid at night, while the surface photolysis reaction is the most significant source during the day.

40|$|Background: The aim of {{the present}} {{research}} {{was to develop a}} short measure for the fi ve-factor model personality traits, which allows scores free of social desirability and acquiescence effects to be obtained. Method: Scales were created using recently developed methods to control response bias effects in a sample of 3, 838 participants from a wide age range. The scales were answered in person or on-line. Results: Exploratory and confi rmatory factor analysis showed the expected fi ve factor structure. Furthermore, the scales showed good psychometric properties in that they had good reliability, temporal stability and convergence with the widely used Big-Five measures.

40|$|Historically, {{concerns}} with jury competence have been assuaged by {{the celebration of}} trial safeguards, expressions of confidence in jury abilities, and most recently through initiatives intended to improve the presentation of expert evidence.
