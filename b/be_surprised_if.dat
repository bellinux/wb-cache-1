25|$|Originally, the Vernal Utah Temple (51) {{served as}} the Uintah Stake Tabernacle for Latter-day Saints in eastern Utah. The Tabernacle's {{foundation}} was constructed of nearby sandstone, with walls built of four layers of fired brick from local clay. Constructed using considerable donated labor from the fall of 1899, it was dedicated on August 24, 1907, by LDS Church president Joseph F. Smith. Smith reportedly {{said he would not}} <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>if</b> a temple was built there some day.|$|E

In an interview director Todd Phillips revealed that Mike Tyson would be back in the sequel. Also in November, it {{was reported}} that Paul Giamatti had joined the cast. The next day {{it was reported}} that former U.S. President Bill Clinton filmed a cameo appearance for the film in Bangkok {{while he was in the}} city to deliver a speech on clean energy. Ed Helms clarified that Clinton merely visited the set and would <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>if</b> he appeared in the film.|$|E
25|$|On 22 March at 9:38pm Islamabad, (16:38 GMT), Gillani {{was officially}} {{announced}} by the peoples party as its candidate for the premiership of the country. Many analysts {{said that they would}} not <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>if</b> Zardari succeeded Gillani after a few months. It was reported on 24 March 2008, that Zardari said he was not interested in the job of prime minister and that Gillani would serve until 2013 in the position. Speculation that Zardari might be gunning for the premiership grew stronger when he picked the less popular Gillani over Ameen Faheem, a much powerful member of the central executive committee. Fahmida Mirza, the newly elected Speaker of the Assembly, insisted there was no plan to replace Gillani. She added, however, that if Gillani did not do a good job, all options were open.|$|E
25|$|On 4 February 2005 he {{committed}} his future to Cardiff City, signing a new long-term {{contract with the}} club. This was shortly after he had won a call up to the Wales under-21 squad. A month later he scored a vital goal, to earn three points for Cardiff as they beat Sheffield United 1–0. Ledley's season ended in April as he suffered a fractured metatarsal bone in training. Before this he had played 32 times for Cardiff City and had also earned three Wales under-21 caps. His performances had provided a major boost for Cardiff City in what was a poor season for them {{as they were in}} relegation trouble {{at the bottom of the}} Championship and were suffering financial troubles as well. Lawrence said that he hoped Ledley would stay at Cardiff for the next few seasons and that he wouldn't <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>if</b> the 18-year-old earned a full Wales call-up in the near future.|$|E

500|$|However, R. A. Dunlap {{points out}} the {{contrast}} between the order of the polyhedral forms and the more chaotic biological nature of the chameleons inhabiting them. In the same vein, Beech observes that the stars themselves convey tension between order and chaos: despite their symmetric shapes, the stars are scattered apparently at random, and vary haphazardly from each other. [...] As Escher himself wrote about the central chameleon cage, [...] "I shouldn't <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>if</b> it wobbles a bit." ...|$|E

500|$|Four {{days after}} Kesler's return, Jannik Hansen was {{involved}} in a controversial hit on the Chicago Blackhawks' Marian Hossa. As both players went up for an airborne puck, Hansen struck Hossa {{in the back of the}} head with his forearm and elbow. Hossa then laid on the ice for a few minutes, during which time the training staff examined him before he was able to leave under his own power. Hansen was given a two-minute minor for roughing and Hossa did not return to the game. Opinions of the hit varied with former NHL referee Kerry Fraser, stating that he did not believe that there was any deliberate or malicious intent, and that he would <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>if</b> Hansen received a suspension for the play. Meanwhile, former Blackhawks analyst Ed Olczyk stated, [...] "there’s no doubt in my mind, once he didn’t play the puck, he had one thing in his mind, and that was to put his forearm or elbow in the back of the head of Marian Hossa," [...] and he would <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>if</b> Hansen was not suspended. Hossa returned to practice the following day. Hansen was suspended for one game due to what Brendan Shanahan called [...] "the carelessness and force of which the blow was delivered." ...|$|E
500|$|The court set out nine minimum standards. In {{response}} to the court's ruling, the General Assembly passed the 1990 Kentucky Education Reform Act, which radically altered Kentucky's school system, providing mechanisms to equalize funding among school districts and implementing {{some of the toughest}} accountability standards in the United States. Of the legislature's actions, Combs opined [...] "Kentucky has now, by reason of this legislation, decided to become educated—and we have embarked on a crusade for that purpose.

LCI operates three casinos in the London area: Fifty, Leicester Square, and The Sportsman. After the purchase of these casinos, Harrah's decided to expand its WSOP label into Europe. European casinos typically have a different environment than those in the U.S. Jeffrey Pollack, the WSOP Commissioner, indicated that the WSOPE would have a [...] "style and flair that is both unique and appropriate to the setting.

[...] John Bush from AllMusic listed the track as one of his album track picks while Michaelangelo Matos from Spin called it one of the album's best moments that were [...] "less about the successive climaxes than steady-state flow." [...] Jack Smith from BBC Music described the song as [...] "cutting edge" [...] and [...] "hook-laden", while highlighting it as [...] "a welcome return" [...] for Burgess.|$|E

Cole has written, [...] "the British {{public would}} not have <b>been</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>if,</b> in that Flensburg wood, Haw-Haw had carried in his pocket a secret weapon capable of annihilating an {{armoured}} brigade".

5000|$|Between Tom Hood and Mr. Lewis Carroll — to call Mr. D. C. Lutwidge by {{his famous}} nom de plume — {{there is more}} than a {{suspicion}} of resemblance in some particulars.

The idea of both is so similar that Mr. Carroll can hardly have <b>been</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>if</b> some people have believed he was inspired by Hood.|$|R
500|$|Kapoor {{has gone}} on record to add, [...] "I would <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>if</b> I don't get {{unbelievable}} critical acclaim for The Dirty Picture and a national award for my actress, Vidya Balan.

[...] She pointed out that the purpose of the film was neither to justify nor criticise Smitha's life but for the audience to live her life. Additionally, all actors, including Balan and Shah attended workshops for almost two months before filming began, to familiarise themselves with the body language of their characters.|$|E
500|$|The {{defending}} champion was seven-time world champion Stephen Hendry who defeated O'Sullivan 9–6 in last year's final. Hendry was still angry at his loss at the Grand Prix to McCulloch, explaining, [...] "The way I {{felt at the}} Grand Prix was down {{to the fact that}} I know what I'm still capable of". The total prize fund was £200,000 and the host broadcaster was Eurosport. O'Sullivan was considered the favourite, with his mentor Ray Reardon saying [...] "Ronnie {{is in the form of}} his life and looks very close to being unstoppable at the moment". Although few top players reached the final eight in the Grand Prix, O'Sullivan said he would not <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>if</b> they performed well in this tournament.|$|E
500|$|In August, Republicans {{began to}} argue that a vote for Paul would equate to a vote for Dukakis. Later in the month, Republicans grew weary of Dan Quayle as the party's vice presidential nominee. Paul commented that [...] "we like Dan Quayle. We also like George Bush and Mike Dukakis. They {{have been the best}} recruiters we have." [...] He {{explained}} that the Libertarian Party was receiving around 100 calls a day from people interested in the party because [...] "a large number of Americans are disenchanted with the choice they have."
