6000|$|... "Then," [...] he proceeded, [...] "I'll {{exercise}} my authority <b>by</b> <b>asking</b> <b>you</b> {{to lay out}} {{in front}} of each tent everything you have brought with you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But if I {{tell you}} what was in my mind, Fan, I should have to finish <b>by</b> <b>asking</b> <b>you</b> a question; and perhaps you {{would not like to}} be asked." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing," [...] said she, [...] "save {{to leave}} me,--that is, if--I blush to {{acknowledge}} my helplessness <b>by</b> <b>asking</b> it--if <b>you</b> can spare me {{the use of}} this apartment for the next twenty-four hours." ...|$|R
50|$|You {{can sit in}} your {{armchair}} and try {{to predict}} how people will behave <b>by</b> <b>asking</b> how <b>you</b> would behave if you had your wits around you. You get, free of charge, a lot of vicarious, empirical behavior.|$|R
50|$|To get {{a ticket}} when leaving from Takarabe station you take a {{numbered}} ticket as you enter the train. When you get off the train you pay for you amount at the fare adjustment window at any manned station. Sometimes the conductor will walk <b>by</b> and <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> to pay.|$|R
6000|$|... "Presently," [...] he answered, [...] "I {{am going}} where it is, but just now I am {{traveling}} {{and have had}} no breakfast. Therefore I honor you <b>by</b> <b>asking</b> <b>you</b> for something to eat." ...|$|E
6000|$|Do you ask, reader, why {{all this}} order? why this despotic admiral, {{and all this}} unity of action? why not [...] "every man for himself"? Let me reply <b>by</b> <b>asking</b> <b>you</b> to think for a moment.|$|E
6000|$|... 'If I {{thought that}} you {{intended}} to stay {{for any length of}} time in the city, I should venture upon a fresh extortion from your friendship <b>by</b> <b>asking</b> <b>you</b> to lend me your little villa at Aricia!' ...|$|E
6000|$|CUTHBERTSON (coming {{forward and}} confronting him). Don't play the fool with me, Charteris: I'm too old {{a hand to}} be amused <b>by</b> it. I <b>ask</b> <b>you,</b> seriously, what's the matter? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He's a true John Bull. Now, Miss Sallie, {{you shall}} {{have a chance}} without waiting to draw. I'll harrrow up your {{feelings}} first <b>by</b> <b>asking</b> if <b>you</b> don't think you are something of a flirt," [...] said Laurie, as Jo nodded to Fred {{as a sign that}} peace was declared.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not yet. Let me get {{nearer to}} {{understanding}} it <b>by</b> <b>asking</b> something before <b>you</b> go on. Did she show any attachment to you, {{when you were}} both at Windygates?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Very many thanks, my good men. I {{need not}} give you any more trouble, except <b>by</b> <b>asking</b> <b>you,</b> if possible, to get me some hot water and soap, and to invite the {{inspector}} to favour me with his company.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Gab. Then, as {{we never}} met before, and never, [...] It may be, may again encounter, why, [...] I thought to cheer up this old dungeon here [...] (At least to me) <b>by</b> <b>asking</b> <b>you</b> to share [...] The fare of my companions and myself.|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose," [...] said Jimmy very quietly, [...] "there {{would be}} nothing gained <b>by</b> <b>asking</b> <b>you</b> to allow the repairs to stand over until we have brought down {{one or two more}} loads of lumber. I expect you know it will cost us the sawmill {{contract}} if we lay the schooner off now?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Irene [rising]. Listen, Constantine, and I {{will tell}} thee all. I am Irene. In my distant home I learned thou didst not love me, and I vowed to win thy heart before I claimed it. Thus, unknown, the proud princess served thee as a slave, {{and learned to}} love thee with a woman's fondest faith. I watched above thee that no harm should fall; I cheered and gladdened life for thee, and won the heart I longed for. I knew the sorrow thou wouldst feel, but tried thy faith <b>by</b> <b>asking</b> <b>thee</b> to {{sacrifice}} thy love and keep thine honor stainless. Here let me offer up a woman's fondest trust and most undying love. Wilt thou believe, and pardon mine offence? [Kneels again before him.] ...|$|R
5000|$|Sociocratisch Centrum co-founder Reijmer has {{summarized}} the difference as follows: [...] "By consensus, I must convince you that I {{am in the}} right; <b>by</b> consent, <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> whether <b>you</b> can live with the decision." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I would <b>ask</b> <b>you,</b> dearest, to be {{very generous}} with him always, and very lenient on his faults {{when he is not}} <b>by.</b> I would <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> to believe that he has a heart he very, very seldom reveals, and that there are deep wounds in it. My dear, I have seen it bleeding." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can only}} do that, Miss Silvester, <b>by</b> <b>asking</b> <b>you</b> without {{ceremony}} for {{all the information that}} I want. Had you any object in traveling to London, which you have not mentioned to me yet? I mean, of course, any object with which I have a claim (as Arnold Brinkworth's representative) to be acquainted?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not <b>by</b> <b>asking</b> <b>you</b> {{to solve}} that problem! But let me add your name. What I want is a guardian, who will not violently break up the home and {{disperse}} the children. I believe Felix will be a competent young head if he is allowed, and I {{want you to be}} an elder brother to him, and let him act.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sit down, Mr. Ducaine," [...] he said. [...] "I do {{not blame}} you for resenting {{what seems to be}} curiosity, but you must {{take my word for it}} that it is nothing of the sort. I can perhaps explain myself better <b>by</b> <b>asking</b> <b>you</b> still another sort of question. Are you in a {{position}} to accept a post of some importance?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Couldn't you?" [...] he asked, and he {{fell into}} a forlorn silence, {{as if he could}} not say {{anything}} more. He forced her to take the word <b>by</b> <b>asking,</b> [...] "Then <b>you</b> are offended with me?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Yosemite Sam - (voiced by Maurice LaMarche) After Willie phones Bugs for advice, Taz phones Sam. He's never {{actually}} seen. He expresses surprise that Taz {{has his own}} show <b>by</b> <b>asking</b> [...] "Ain't <b>you</b> retired yet?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will answer}} your {{question}} <b>by</b> <b>asking</b> another. Suppose <b>you</b> {{were one of the}} poor, and the well-to-do offered to be friendly with you on such terms as you have mentioned, how should you feel toward them?" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{have been}} asked to preach in behalf of the Provident Society of this town. I shall begin <b>by</b> <b>asking</b> <b>you</b> to think over with me a matter which may seem at first sight to have {{very little to do with}} you or with a provident society, but which, nevertheless, I believe has very much to do with both, and is full of {{wholesome}} spiritual instruction for us all.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{will think}} of that,' said Ethelberta, with a cooler manner. 'But seriously, all these words are nothing to the purpose. I must remark that I prize your friendship, {{but it is not}} for me to marry now. You have {{convinced}} me of your goodness of heart and freedom from unworthy suspicions; let that be enough. The best way in which I in my turn can convince you of my goodness of heart is <b>by</b> <b>asking</b> <b>you</b> to see me in private no more.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "On the contrary--" [...] Brissenden {{paused and}} ran an insolent eye over Martin's {{objective}} poverty, passing from the well-worn tie and the saw- edged collar to the shiny sleeves of the coat {{and on to}} the slight fray of one cuff, winding up and dwelling upon Martin's sunken cheeks. [...] "On the contrary, hack-work is above you, so far above you that you can never hope to rise to it. Why, man, I could insult you <b>by</b> <b>asking</b> <b>you</b> to have something to eat." ...|$|E
5000|$|General:The {{results of}} the last week must {{convince}} you of the hopelessness of further resistance {{on the part of}} the Army of Northern Virginia in this struggle.

Army known as the Army of Northern Virginia.|$|R
5000|$|On January 6, 2005, Colin Newman, an {{assistant}} in the White House counsels office, wrote to David Leitch stating, [...] "Karl Rove stopped <b>by</b> to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> (roughly quoting) 'how {{we planned to}} proceed regarding U.S. Attorneys, whether {{we were going to}} allow all to stay, request resignations from all and accept only some of them or selectively replace them, etc.'". The email was then forwarded to Kyle Sampson, chief of staff to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.|$|R

6000|$|... "Gentleman," [...] he said, [...] "I won't protract your painful duties <b>by</b> <b>asking</b> <b>you</b> {{what you}} want; but I will ask at once {{for a small}} favor, which will not {{prejudice}} those duties in any way.

[...] "I find there is still some fifteen minutes. Will you wait with me here for that short time; after which I am quite at your service." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{perfectly}} sensible," [...] he resumed, [...] "that such {{a proposition}} as I now make to you, proceeding from one {{little better than}} a stranger, may cause surprise and even suspicion, at first. I can only explain it, <b>by</b> <b>asking</b> <b>you</b> to remember that I have known the young lady since childhood; and that, having assisted in forming her mind and developing her character, I feel towards her almost as a second father, and am therefore naturally interested in the gentleman who has chosen her for a wife." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{child was}} born alive, and lives still. You saw her at the window as we came in at the back way to the Grange. I {{surprised}} you, I dare say, <b>by</b> <b>asking</b> <b>you</b> {{not to speak of}} her to Miss Welwyn. Perhaps you noticed something vacant in the little girl's expression. I am sorry to say that her mind is more vacant still. If [...] "idiot" [...] did not sound like a mocking word, however tenderly and pityingly one may wish to utter it, I should tell you that the poor thing had been an idiot from her birth.|$|E
60|$|A stage {{child does}} not get up at five {{o'clock in the morning}} to {{practice}} playing on a penny whistle. A stage child never wants a bicycle and drives you mad about it.
