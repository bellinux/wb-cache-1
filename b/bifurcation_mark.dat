40|$|Traveling wavetrains in {{generalized}} two–species predator–prey {{models and}} two– component reaction–diffusion equations are considered. The {{stability of the}} fixed points of the traveling wave ODEs (in the usual ”spatial ” variable) is considered. For general functional forms of the nonlinear prey birthrate/prey deathrate or reaction terms, a Hopf bifurcation is shown to occur at two different critical values of the traveling wave speed. The post–bifurcation dynamics is investigated for five different functional forms of the nonlinearities. In cases where the bifurcation is supercritical, the post– bifurcation behaviour yields stable periodic orbits of the traveling–wave ODEs in the spatial variable. These correspond to stable periodic wavetrains of the full PDEs. Subcritical Hopf bifurcations yield more complex post–bifurcation dynamics in the PDE wavetrains. In special cases where the subcritical <b>bifurcation</b> <b>marks</b> {{the end of the}} regime of stability, the post–bifurcation behavior in the spatial ODEs is chaotic, corresponding to wavetrains of the original PDEs which are spatially coherent, but have chaotic temporal dynamics.

40|$|Phenotype {{switching}} {{is commonly}} observed in nature. This prevalence {{has allowed the}} elucidation {{of a number of}} underlying molecular mechanisms. However, little is known about how phenotypic switches arise and function in their early evolutionary stages. The first opportunity to provide empirical insight was delivered by an experiment in which populations of the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW 25 evolved, de novo, the ability to switch between two colony phenotypes. Here we unravel the molecular mechanism behind colony switching, revealing how a single nucleotide change in a gene enmeshed in central metabolism (carB) generates such a striking phenotype. We show that colony switching is underpinned by ON/OFF expression of capsules consisting of a colanic acid-like polymer. We use molecular genetics, biochemical analyses, and experimental evolution to establish that capsule switching results from perturbation of the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway. Of central importance is a bifurcation point at which uracil triphosphate is partitioned towards either nucleotide metabolism or polymer production. This <b>bifurcation</b> <b>marks</b> a cell-fate decision point whereby cells with relatively high pyrimidine levels favour nucleotide metabolism (capsule OFF), while cells with lower pyrimidine levels divert resources towards polymer biosynthesis (capsule ON). This decision point is present and functional in the wild-type strain. Finally, we present a simple mathematical model demonstrating that the molecular components of the decision point are capable of producing switching. Despite its simple mutational cause, the connection between genotype and phenotype is complex and multidimensional, offering a rare glimpse of how noise in regulatory networks can provide opportunity for evolution.

If w_ampa = 10, then {{we know from}} Fig.  6 (A) that the period-doubling bifurcation at w_inh^cr = u_ 3 is supercritical: the stable SyC becomes unstable and a stable limit cycle of double period appears. Stable double-period cycle is an in-phase type (1) limit cycle. Here we introduce the notation 2 -SyC for this synchrony cycle of double period. Some additional details {{of the evolution of}} this limit cycle (solid purple line in Fig.  6 (A)) are shown in Fig.  6 (B), panel ZOOM  3. This means that somewhere between these two points of the period-doubling bifurcation line ((w_ 4, 12) and (u_ 3, 10)) should be some bifurcation point (B), which corresponds to this change. At this point (B) the red line of subcritical period doubling (marked PD−) becomes the line of supercritical period-doubling <b>bifurcation</b> (<b>marked</b> PD+ at Fig.  5 (A)). We are unable to find point B via computational continuation. Therefore, to calculate the coordinates of this point, we use multiple simulations of the reduced model to find where the double-period limit cycle is stable outside of the SyC stability region. We started simulations from the following point (Δ = 0.1, d= 6, w_ampa = 10  nS, w_nmda = 10  nS, w_inh = 42  nS) and slightly varied parameters (w_inh, w_ampa), decreasing the value of w_ampa to find the double-period cycle and define its stability.

40|$|The {{asymptotic}} behaviour {{of a model}} of a tri-trophic food chain in the chemostat is analysed in detail. The Monod growth model is used for all trophic levels, yielding a non-linear dynamical system of four ordinary differential equations. Mass conservation makes it possible to reduce the dimension by 1 {{for the study of the}} asymptotic dynamic behaviour. The intersections of the orbits with a Poincaré plane, after the transient has died out, yield a two-dimensional Poincaré next-return map. When chaotic behaviour occurs, all image points of this next-return map appear to lie close to a single curve in the intersection plane. This motivated the study of a one-dimensional bi-modal, non-invertible map of which the graph resembles this curve. We will show that the bifurcation structure of the food chain model can be understood in terms of the local and global bifurcations of this one-dimensional map. Homoclinic and heteroclinic connecting orbits and their global bifurcations are discussed also by relating them to their counterparts for a two-dimensional map which is invertible like the next-return map. In the global bifurcations two homoclinic or two heteroclinic orbits collide and disappear. In the food chain model two attractors coexist; a stable limit cycle where the top-predator is absent and an interior attractor. In addition there is a saddle cycle. The stable manifold of this limit cycle forms the basin boundary of the interior attractor. We will show that this boundary has a complicated structure when there are heteroclinic orbits from a saddle equilibrium to this saddle limit cycle. A homoclinic bifurcation to a saddle limit cycle will be associated with a boundary crisis where the chaotic attractor disappears suddenly when a bifurcation parameter is varied. Thus, similar to a tangent local bifurcation for equilibria or limit cycles, this homoclinic global <b>bifurcation</b> <b>marks</b> a region in the parameter space where the top-predator goes extinct. The 'Paradox of Enrichment' says that increasing the concentration of nutrient input can cause destabilization of the otherwise stable interior equilibrium of a bi-trophic food chain. For a tri-trophic food chain enrichment of the environment can even lead to extinction of the highest trophic level. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc...|$|R

40|$|In {{epidemiological}} modelling, dynamics on networks, and {{in particular}} adaptive and heterogeneous networks have recently received much interest. Here we present {{a detailed analysis of}} a previously proposed model that combines heterogeneity in the individuals with adaptive rewiring of the network structure in response to a disease. We show that in this model qualitative changes in the dynamics occur in two phase transitions. In a macroscopic description one of these corresponds to a local bifurcation whereas the other one corresponds to a non-local heteroclinic bifurcation. This model thus provides a rare example of a system where a phase transition is caused by a non-local bifurcation, while both micro- and macro-level dynamics are accessible to mathematical analysis. The <b>bifurcation</b> points <b>mark</b> the onset of a behaviour that we call network inoculation. In the respective parameter region exposure of the system to a pathogen will lead to an outbreak that collapses, but leaves the network in a configuration where the disease cannot reinvade, despite every agent returning to the susceptible class.

40|$|This thesis investigates neural state {{transitions}} {{associated with}} sleep, seizure and anaesthesia. The {{aim is to}} address the question: How does a brain traverse the critical threshold between distinct cortical states, both healthy and pathological? Specifically {{we are interested in}} sub-threshold neural behaviour immediately prior to state transition. We use theoretical neural modelling (single spiking neurons, a network of these, and a mean-field continuum limit) and in vitro experiments to address this question. Dynamically realistic equations of motion for thalamic relay neuron, reticular nuclei, cortical pyramidal and cortical interneuron in different vigilance states are developed, based on the Izhikevich spiking neuron model. A network of cortical neurons is assembled to examine the behaviour of the gamma-producing cortical network and its transition to lower frequencies due to effect of anaesthesia. Then a three-neuron model for the thalamocortical loop for sleep spindles is presented. Numerical simulations of these networks confirms spiking consistent with reported in vivo measurement results, and provides supporting evidence for precursor indicators of imminent phase transition due to occurrence of individual spindles. To complement the spiking neuron networks, we study the Wilson–Cowan neural mass equations describing homogeneous cortical columns and a 1 D spatial cluster of such columns. The abstract representation of cortical tissue by a pair of coupled integro-differential equations permits thorough linear stability, phase plane and bifurcation analyses. This model shows a rich set of spatial and temporal <b>bifurcations</b> <b>marking</b> the boundary to state transitions: saddle-node, Hopf, Turing, and mixed Hopf–Turing. Close to state transition, white-noise-induced subthreshold fluctuations show clear signs of critical slowing down with prolongation and strengthening of autocorrelations, both in time and space, irrespective of bifurcation type. Attempts at in vitro capture of these predicted leading indicators form {{the last part of the}} thesis. We recorded local field potentials (LFPs) from cortical and hippocampal slices of mouse brain. State transition is marked by the emergence and cessation of spontaneous seizure-like events (SLEs) induced by bathing the slices in an artificial cerebral spinal fluid containing no magnesium ions. Phase-plane analysis of the LFP time-series suggests that distinct bifurcation classes can be responsible for state change to seizure. Increased variance and growth of spectral power at low frequencies (f < 15 Hz) was observed in LFP recordings prior to initiation of some SLEs. In addition we demonstrated prolongation of electrically evoked potentials in cortical tissue, while forwarding the slice to a seizing regime. The results offer the possibility of capturing leading temporal indicators prior to seizure generation, with potential consequences for understanding epileptogenesis.

We adopt an elastoplastic micropolar constitutive model, recently developed for dense cohesionless granular materials within the framework of thermomicromechanics. The internal variables and their evolution laws are conceived from a direct consideration of the dissipative mechanism of force chain buckling. The resulting constitutive law is cast entirely in terms of the particle scale properties. It thus presents a unique opportunity to test the potential of micromechanical continuum formulations to reproduce key stages in the deformation history: the development of material instabilities and failure following an initially homogeneous deformation. Progression of failure, initiating from frictional sliding and rolling at contacts, followed by the buckling of force chains, through to macroscopic strain softening and shear banding, is reproduced. <b>Bifurcation</b> point, <b>marking</b> the onset of shear banding, occurred shortly after the peak stress ratio. A wide range of material parameters was examined to show the effect of particle scale properties on the progression of failure.

This model is extended {{by the introduction of}} maintenance and energy reserves at all trophic levels, with two state variables for each trophic level, biomass and reserve energy. Then the dynamics of each population are described by two ordinary differential equations. For all models the bifurcation diagram for the bi-trophic food chain is simple.

40|$|Electro-cortical {{activity}} {{in patients with}} epilepsy may show abnormal rhythmic transients in response to stimulation. Even when using the same stimulation parameters in the same patient, wide variability in the duration of transient response has been reported. These transients have long been considered important for the mapping of the excitability levels in the epileptic brain but their dynamic mechanism is still not well understood. To understand the occurrence of abnormal transients dynamically, we use a thalamo-cortical neural population model of epileptic spike-wave activity and study the interaction between slow and fast subsystems. In a reduced version of the thalamo-cortical model, slow wave oscillations arise from a fold of cycles (FoC) <b>bifurcation.</b> This <b>marks</b> the onset of a region of bistability between a high amplitude oscillatory rhythm and the background state. In vicinity of the bistability in parameter space, the model has excitable dynamics, showing prolonged rhythmic transients in response to suprathreshold pulse stimulation. We analyse the state space geometry of the bistable and excitable states, and find that the rhythmic transient arises when the impending FoC bifurcation deforms the state space and creates an area of locally reduced attraction to the fixed point. This area essentially allows trajectories to dwell there before escaping to the stable steady state, thus creating rhythmic transients. In the full thalamo-cortical model, we find a similar FoC bifurcation structure. Based on the analysis, we propose an explanation of why stimulation induced epileptiform activity may vary between trials, and predict how the variability {{could be related to}} ongoing oscillatory background activity.

40|$|We {{study the}} effects of a {{non-specified}} infectious disease of the predator on the dynamics a predator–prey system, by evaluating the dynamics of a three-dimensional model. The predator population in this (PSI) model is split into a susceptible and an unrecoverable infected population, while all newborn are susceptible. The incidence rate at which susceptible become infectious is described by a Holling type II functional response giving saturation when the number of susceptibles increases. From a modeling context this three-dimensional model is in the limit case similar to the well-known 3 D Rosenzweig–MacArthur (RM) model, with the infected population replacing the top-predator. The RM model is known for the Shil’nikov bifurcation, which is associated to the chaotic behaviour. The effects of the disease are considered to be changes in the parameters that represent relative predation efficiency and mortality rates. A combination of analysis, numerical integration and numerical continuation techniques are used to perform a bifurcation analysis of the model. The positive stationary solution of the disease free, two-dimensional predator–prey system is either a stable equilibrium or a stable limit cycle where the transition occurs at the Hopf bifurcation. For a biologically applicable parameter set, it is found that when the infected individuals feed less fast or less effective than the susceptibles there is bi-stability where the two-dimensional disease free state co-exists with a stable equilibrium for the three-dimensional PSI system. The introduction of a disease can also cause chaos when the infected predator individuals are ecologically not functioning (not feeding and no offspring). However, under small parameter changes first the Shil’nikov bifurcation, and hence the chaotic behaviour, disappears followed by the Hopf <b>bifurcation</b> that <b>marks</b> the existence of limit cycles of the three-dimensional PSI system.

40|$|The dynamic {{behaviour}} of simple aquatic ecosystems with nutrient recycling in a chemostat, stressed by limited food availability and a toxicant, is analysed. The {{aim is to}} find effects of toxicants on the structure and functioning of the ecosystem. The starting point is an unstressed ecosystem model for nutrients, populations, detritus and their intra- and interspecific interactions, {{as well as the}} interaction with the physical environment. The fate of the toxicant includes transport and exchange between the water and the populations via two routes, directly from water via diffusion over the outer membrane of the organism and via consumption of contaminated food. These processes are modelled using mass-balance formulations and diffusion equations. At the population level the toxicant affects different biotic processes such as assimilation, growth, maintenance, reproduction, and survival, thereby changing their biological functioning. This is modelled by taking the parameters that described these processes to be dependent on the internal toxicant concentration. As a consequence, the structure of the ecosystem, that is its species composition, persistence, extinction or invasion of species and dynamics behaviour, steady state oscillatory and chaotic, can change. To analyse the long-term dynamics we use the bifurcation analysis approach. In ecotoxicological studies the concentration of the toxicant in the environment can be taken as the bifurcation parameter. The value of the concentration at a <b>bifurcation</b> point <b>marks</b> a structural change of the ecosystem. This indicates that chemical stressors are analysed mathematically {{in the same way as}} environmental (e. g. temperature) and ecological (e. g. predation) stressors.

The present study aimed to explore the patterns of intraspecific and interspecific variation in female genitalia in two sister taxa of watersnake (Nerodia sipedon and Nerodia fasciata) that have similar genital shape. We used a geometric morphometric (GM) approach to study variation in shape of the vagina between and within two sister species. We examined genital shape in female watersnakes ranging from small, sexually immature females to large reproductive females that had recently given birth. We found that shape variation of genitalia is strongly correlated with body size, where larger but not smaller females have a bifurcation in the vagina.

40|$|Magnetorotational dynamo {{action in}} Keplerian shear flow is a three-dimensional, {{nonlinear}} magnetohydrodynamic process whose study {{is relevant to}} the understanding of accretion and magnetic field generation in astrophysics. Transition to this form of dynamo is subcritical and shares many characteristics of transition to turbulence in non-rotating hydrodynamic shear flows. This suggests that these different fluid systems become active through similar generic bifurcation mechanisms, which in both cases have eluded detailed understanding so far. In this paper, we investigate numerically the bifurcation mechanisms at work in the incompressible Keplerian magnetorotational dynamo problem in the shearing box framework. Using numerical techniques imported from dynamical systems research, we show that the onset of chaotic dynamo action at magnetic Prandtl numbers larger than unity is primarily associated with global homoclinic and heteroclinic bifurcations of nonlinear magnetorotational dynamo cycles. These global bifurcations are supplemented by local <b>bifurcations</b> of cycles <b>marking</b> the beginning of period-doubling cascades. This suggests that nonlinear magnetorotational dynamo cycles provide the pathway to turbulent injection of both kinetic and magnetic energy in incompressible magnetohydrodynamic Keplerian shear flow {{in the absence of an}} externally imposed magnetic field. Studying the nonlinear physics and bifurcations of these cycles in different regimes and configurations may subsequently help to better understand the conditions of excitation of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence and instability-driven dynamos in various astrophysical systems and laboratory experiments. The detailed characterization of global bifurcations provided for this three-dimensional subcritical fluid dynamics problem may also prove useful for the problem of transition to turbulence in hydrodynamic shear flows.
