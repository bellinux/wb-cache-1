5|$|The pre-game buildup was {{primarily}} {{focused on the}} rematch. A slight plurality of experts picked Tulsa over Iowa State, but most predicted the game to <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>close.</b> Tulsa was considered a strong running team with a solid defense, while Iowa State was balanced offensively and struggled at times on defense. This was the only rematch of the 2012-13 college bowl season.|$|E
5|$|Examining both {{morphological}} {{and genetic}} (cytochrome b) characters in 2008, German biologist Michael Wink and colleagues {{concluded that the}} southern boobook is distinct from the morepork and Tasmanian boobook (which they proposed to be raised to species status as Ninox leucopsis), {{and that it is}} instead the sister taxon to the barking owl (N. connivens). A 2017 study by Singapore-based biologist Chyi Yin Gwee and colleagues analysing both multi-locus DNA and boobook calls confirmed a sister relationship of leucopsis and novaeseelandiae and their close relationship to connivens. Additionally, genetic and call analysis show the Christmas boobook (N. natalis) to <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>close</b> to the Australian populations of the southern boobook, leading Gwee and colleagues to suggest it be reclassified within this species.|$|E

25|$|Transliteration {{is opposed}} to transcription, which maps the sounds of one {{language}} into a writing system.

25|$|As a rule {{it is not}} {{difficult}} to guess which eyes are which in a living or preserved specimen, but sometimes it can be. Apart from the fact that in some species one or more pairs may be missing, sometimes eyes from the posterior and anterior rows may <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>close</b> to each other, or even fused. Also, either one row or both might be so grossly curved that some of the notionally anterior eyes actually may lie posterior to some of the eyes in the posterior row. In some species the curve is so gross that the eyes apparently are arranged into two anteroposterior parallel rows of eyes.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{effective}} ways to prevent electromagnetic attacks is to make it difficult for an attacker to collect an electromagnetic signal at the physical level. Broadly, the hardware designer could design the encryption hardware to reduce signal strength or to protect the chip. Circuit and wire shielding, such as a Faraday cage, are effective in reducing the signal, as well as filtering the signal or introducing extraneous noise to mask the signal. Additionally, most electromagnetic attacks require attacking equipment to <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>close</b> to the target, so distance is an effective countermeasure. Circuit designers can also use certain glues or design components {{in order to make it}} difficult or impossible to depackage the chip without destroying it.|$|E
25|$|With a young core {{of players}} led by Vincent Lecavalier, Brad Richards, Martin St. Louis and Fredrik Modin, the Lightning {{were thought to}} <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>close</b> to respectability. However, they arrived {{somewhat}} earlier than expected in 2002–03. The young team was led by the goaltending of Nikolai Khabibulin and the scoring efforts of Lecavalier, St. Louis, Modin, Richards and Ruslan Fedotenko, and also boasted a new captain, former prolific scorer Dave Andreychuk. Throughout the season, the Lightning battled the Washington Capitals for {{first place in the}} Southeast Division. They finished with a record of 36–25–16 for 93 points, breaking the 90-point barrier {{for the first time in}} team history. They won the division by just one point, giving them home-ice advantage in their first round match-up with the Capitals. At season's end, Coach Tortorella was recognized for his efforts by being named a finalist for the Jack Adams Award, losing out to Jacques Lemaire of the Minnesota Wild.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1960s U.S. nuclear {{submarines}} armed with mid-range nuclear missiles of type Polaris A-1 were deployed outside the Swedish west coast. Range and safety considerations made {{this a good}} area from which to launch a retaliatory nuclear strike on Moscow. The submarines had to <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>close</b> to the Swedish coast to hit their intended targets though. As a consequence of this, in 1960, {{the same year that}} the submarines were first deployed, the U.S. provided Sweden with a military security guarantee. The U.S. promised to provide military force in aid of Sweden in case of Soviet aggression. This guarantee was kept from the Swedish public until 1994, when a Swedish research commission found evidence for it. As part of the military cooperation the U.S. provided much help {{in the development of the}} Saab 37 Viggen, as a strong Swedish air force was seen as necessary to keep Soviet anti-submarine aircraft from operating in the missile launch area. In return Swedish scientists at the Royal Institute of Technology made considerable contributions to enhancing the targeting performance of the Polaris missiles.|$|E
25|$|Also, {{there are}} {{problems}} in basing the analysis on a single type of character, such as a single gene or protein or only on morphological analysis, because such trees constructed from another unrelated data source often differ from the first, and therefore great care is needed in inferring phylogenetic relationships among species. This is most true of genetic material that is subject to lateral gene transfer and recombination, where different haplotype blocks can have different histories. In general, the output tree of a phylogenetic analysis is {{an estimate of the}} characters phylogeny (i.e. a gene tree) and not the phylogeny of the taxa (i.e. species tree) from which these characters were sampled, though ideally, both should <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>close.</b> For this reason, serious phylogenetic studies generally use a combination of genes that come from different genomic sources (e.g., from mitochondrial or plastid vs. nuclear genomes), or genes that would be expected to evolve under different selective regimes, so that homoplasy (false homology) would be unlikely to result from natural selection.|$|E
25|$|Intense {{columns of}} Auroral {{ionization}} at 100km altitudes within the auroral oval backscatter radio waves, including those on HF and VHF. Backscatter is angle-sensitive—incident ray vs. magnetic field {{line of the}} column must <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>close</b> to right-angle. Random motions of electrons spiraling around the field lines create a Doppler-spread that broadens the spectra of the emission to more or less noise-likedepending on how high radio frequency is used. The radio-auroras are observed mostly at high latitudes and rarely extend down to middle latitudes. The occurrence of radio-auroras depends on solar activity (flares, coronal holes, CMEs) and annually the events are more numerous during solar cycle maxima. Radio aurora includes the so-called afternoon radio aurora which produces stronger but more distorted signals and after the Harang-minima, the late-night radio aurora (sub-storming phase) returns with variable signal strength and lesser doppler spread. The propagation range for this predominantly back-scatter mode extends up to about 2000km in east-west plane, but strongest signals are observed most frequently from the north at nearby sites on same latitudes.|$|E
