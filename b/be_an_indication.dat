5|$|There is no {{specific}} treatment for most thrombophilias, but recurrent episodes of thrombosis may <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> for long-term preventative anticoagulation.

5|$|Globular {{clusters}} normally {{consist of}} Population II stars, {{which have a}} low proportion of elements other than hydrogen and helium when compared to Population I stars such as the Sun. Astronomers refer to these heavier elements as metals and to the proportions of these elements as the metallicity. These elements are produced by stellar nucleosynthesis and then are recycled into the interstellar medium, where they enter {{the next generation of}} stars. Hence the proportion of metals can <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> of the age of a star, with older stars typically having a lower metallicity.|$|E

5|$|The {{kings of}} the first kingdom were buried outside the city; the last ten kings (ending with Irkab-Damu) were buried in Darib, while older kings were buried in a royal {{mausoleum}} located in Binas and only one royal tomb dating to the first kingdom was discovered in Ebla (Hypogeum G4). This first kingdom tomb was probably built {{during the reign of}} the last king and might <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> of Eblaite adoption of Mesopotamian traditions to bury the kings beneath their royal palaces.|$|E
5|$|Two prototypes {{are known}} to have been built, but some records suggest that others were also built. The {{original}} order called for three aircraft and was amended later for two additional aircraft with M-82 engines. Some sources quote dates for the latter version's first flight of January 1942 and 15 October 1941, which could <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> that two of the latter version were completed, or they could simply be clerical errors.|$|E
5|$|A neutron {{spectrometer}} {{on board the}} Lunar Prospector spacecraft detected enhanced concentrations of hydrogen close to {{the northern and southern}} lunar poles, including the crater Shackleton. At the end of this mission in July 1999, the spacecraft was crashed into the nearby crater Shoemaker in the hope of detecting from Earth-based telescopes an impact-generated plume containing water vapor. The impact event did not produce any detectable water vapor, and this may <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> that the hydrogen is not in the form of hydrated minerals, or that the impact site did not contain any ice. Alternatively, {{it is possible that the}} crash did not excavate deeply enough into the regolith to liberate significant quantities of water vapor.|$|E

5|$|Breathing quality gases do not {{normally}} deteriorate during storage in steel or aluminium cylinders. Provided there is insufficient water content to promote internal corrosion, the stored gas will remain unchanged for years if stored at temperatures within the allowed working range for the cylinder, usually below 65°C. If {{there is any}} doubt, a check of oxygen fraction will indicate whether the gas has changed (the other components are inert). Any unusual smells would <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> that the cylinder or gas was contaminated {{at the time of}} filling. However some authorities recommend releasing most of the contents and storing cylinders with a small positive pressure.|$|E
5|$|Eleanor {{probably}} {{hoped that}} Henry would be recognised as a saint, as his contemporary Louis IX of France had been; indeed, Henry's final tomb resembled {{the shrine of}} a saint, complete with niches possibly intended to hold relics. When the King's body was exhumed in 1290, contemporaries noted that the body was in perfect condition and that Henry's long beard remained well preserved, {{which at the time}} was considered to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> of saintly purity. Miracles began to be reported at the tomb, but Edward was sceptical about these stories. The reports ceased, and Henry was never canonised. In 1292 Henry's heart was removed from his tomb and reburied at Fontevraud Abbey with the bodies of his Angevin family.|$|E
5|$|Examination of M87 at far {{infrared}} wavelengths shows an excess emission at wavelengths longer than 25μm. Normally such emission may <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> of thermal emission by warm dust. However, {{in the case}} of M87, the emission appears to be fully explained by synchrotron radiation from the jet. Within the galaxy, silicate grains are expected to survive for no more than 46million years because of the X-ray emission from the core. This dust may be destroyed by the hostile environment or expelled from the galaxy. The combined mass of dust in this galaxy is no more than 70,000 times the mass of the Sun. By comparison, the Milky Way contains about a hundred million (108) solar masses worth of dust.|$|E

He did not withdraw his candidacy after John McCain won the necessary 1,191 delegates to the Republican National Convention, {{even though he was}} no longer campaigning for the Republican nomination. On March 27, 2008, Keyes's campaign website began displaying the Constitution Party's logo, along with a parody of the trademarked GOP logo {{in the form of a}} dead elephant. This appeared to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> of Keyes's intentions to quit the Republican party and to begin officially seeking the Constitution Party's presidential nomination.|$|E
5|$|Kristen LaMoreaux, {{another student}} of the University of Pittsburgh, focused on the {{emplacement}} of trachyte lava flows and domes. In 2006, LaMoreaux analyzed jointing patterns at Ornostay Bluff, a viscous series of trachyte lava flows on the western lava plateau of the Mount Edziza volcanic complex. LaMoreaux also examined trachytic lava flows from Koosick Bluff and Triangle Dome, a trachytic lava dome which last erupted during the Pleistocene period. Other studies by LaMoreaux determined criteria for understanding how lava flow thickness {{may or may not}} <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> that the progress of a lava flow was impeded by an ice barrier, resulting in an unusually thick lava flow.|$|E
5|$|The problem {{posed by}} the ratio is that the {{multiple}} specimens studied, died in the same place, but probably not in a sudden mass-death and so do not represent a single herd or contemporary population. The results may have been distorted by a greater chance for robust animals of getting fossilised or discovered. In an earlier study by Galton in 1982, {{it was suggested that}} individual difference in the sacral rib count of both Kentrosaurus and Dacentrurus might <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> of dimorphism: females would have had an extra pair of sacral ribs, having also the first sacral vertebra connected to the ilium, in addition to the subsequent four sacrals.|$|E

5|$|The sitters are {{presented}} in three-quarter view before flat, nondescript lacquer-like green backgrounds, which although lushly coloured, are thinly layered. Each has a white ground and light red imprimatura with lead content. The sitter's form and pose echo {{and in many ways}} counterbalance each other. Brand Philip draws attention to the similarities of the panels' linear construction, especially {{the manner in which the}} folds and lines of their clothing form triangular shapes. The train of Barbara's headdress across her chest corresponds with the opening of Albrecht's fur-lined coat. It was more usual in pendant portraits of this type for the male to be on the left-hand side; the positioning here may <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> that Dürer originally intended his father's panel to stand alone, given that Barbara's was painted some time later.|$|E
5|$|The text {{consists}} of different Bible {{passages from the}} Old and New Testament, {{as well as individual}} verses of hymns by Martin Luther and Adam Reusner, which all together refer to finiteness, preparation for death and dying. There are two distinct parts to the cantata: the view of the Old Testament on death shown in the first part is confronted by that of the New Testament in the second part, leading to a symmetrical structure. The juxtaposition of texts from the Old and New Testament appeared before in the Christliche Betschule (Christian school of prayer) by Johann Olearius. Markus Rathey, professor at the Yale Institute of Sacred Music, argued in 2006, that the sermon given at the funeral of Strecker is similar in ideas to the themes of the cantatas. It may <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> that Bach composed the work for this occasion.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{evidence}} that Æthelberht's influence in other kingdoms was enough for him to convert any other kings to Christianity, although this is partly {{due to the lack of}} sources—nothing is known of Sussex's history, for example, for almost all of the seventh and eighth centuries. Æthelberht was able to arrange a meeting in 602 in the Severn valley, on the northwestern borders of Wessex, however, and this may <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> of the extent of his influence in the west. No evidence survives showing Kentish domination of Mercia, but it is known that Mercia was independent of Northumbria, so it is quite plausible that it was under Kentish overlordship.|$|E

5|$|Sirius is {{a binary}} star system {{consisting}} of two white stars orbiting {{each other with a}} separation of about 20 AU (roughly the distance between the Sun and Uranus) and a period of 50.1 years. The brighter component, termed Sirius A, is a main-sequence star of spectral type early A, with an estimated surface temperature of 9,940K. Its companion, Sirius B, is a star that has already evolved off the main sequence and become a white dwarf. Currently 10,000 times less luminous in the visual spectrum, Sirius B was once the more massive of the two. The age of the system has been estimated at around 230 million years. Early in its lifespan it was thought to have been two bluish white stars orbiting each other in an elliptical orbit every 9.1 years. The system emits a higher than expected level of infrared radiation, as measured by IRAS space-based observatory. This may <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> of dust in the system, and is considered somewhat unusual for a binary star. The Chandra X-ray Observatory image shows Sirius B outshining its bright partner as it is a brighter X-ray source.|$|E
5|$|Chest x-ray is {{the initial}} imaging {{technique}} used to diagnose TBI. The film {{may not have}} any signs in an otherwise asymptomatic patient. Indications of TBI seen on radiographs include deformity in the trachea or a defect in the tracheal wall. Radiography may also show cervical emphysema, air in the tissues of the neck. X-rays may also show accompanying injuries and signs such as fractures and subcutaneous emphysema. If subcutaneous emphysema occurs and the hyoid bone appears in an X-ray to be sitting unusually high in the throat, it may <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> that the trachea has been severed. TBI is also suspected if an endotracheal tube appears in an X-ray {{to be out of}} place, or if its cuff appears to be more full than normal or to protrude through a tear in the airway. If a bronchus is torn all the way around, the lung may collapse outward toward the chest wall (rather than inward, as it usually does in pneumothorax) because it loses the attachment to the bronchus which normally holds it toward the center. In a person lying face-up, the lung collapses toward the diaphragm and the back. This sign, described in 1969, is called fallen lung sign and is pathognomonic of TBI (that is, it is diagnostic for TBI because it does not occur in other conditions); however it occurs only rarely. In as many as one in five cases, people with blunt trauma and TBI have no signs of the injury on chest X-ray. CT scanning detects over 90% of TBI resulting from blunt trauma, but neither X-ray nor CT are a replacement for bronchoscopy.|$|E
