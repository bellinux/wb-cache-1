5|$|Wallace visits Menado on the {{northeast}} coast of Celebes. The people of the Minahasa region are fair-skinned, unlike {{anywhere else in the}} archipelago. He stays high in the mountains by the coffee plantations, and is often cold, but finds that the animals are no different from those lower down. The forest was full of orchids, bromeliads, clubmosses and mosses. He experiences an earthquake, but the low timber-framed houses survive with little damage. He finds that the people, under the guidance of missionaries, are the most hard-working, peaceful and civilised of the whole archipelago. He obtains (apparently by purchase) skulls of the <b>babirusa</b> (pig-deer) and the rare sapiutan (midget buffalo).|$|E
5|$|The only {{carnivore}} in the Moluccas is the Malayan civet (Musang), {{which he}} supposes {{has been introduced}} by accident as it is kept for its musk. The Celebes <b>Babirusa</b> is, oddly, found on Bouru, which he supposes it reached partly by swimming, citing Sir Charles Lyell's Principles of Geology to confirm this ability. The other mammals are marsupial, so, he presumes, true natives. In contrast to the few mammals, {{there are at least}} 265 bird species, more than all of Europe, which had 257, but of these just three groups – parrots, kingfishers and pigeons – make up nearly a third, compared to only a twentieth of the birds of India. Wallace suggests this is because they came from New Guinea, which has a similar lack of some groups, and adds that many New Guinea birds have not reached the Moluccas, implying that the islands have been isolated for a long time.|$|E

Pigs include the domestic pig and its ancestor, the common Eurasian wild boar (Sus scrofa), along with other species; related creatures outside the genus include the peccary, the <b>babirusa,</b> and the warthog. Pigs, like all suids, are native to the Eurasian and African continents. Juvenile pigs are known as piglets. Pigs are highly social and intelligent animals.|$|E

Also included in the Land of the Tiger are wreathed and wrinkled hornbills, Visayan warty pigs, <b>babirusa</b> pigs, and Asian small-clawed otters. The zoo's other exhibits include the Plains of East Africa, highlighting African savanna animals; Great Apes of the World, featuring two of the four great apes among other primates; the Australian Outback, including lorikeets, cassowarys, and kangaroos; and Wild Florida, which features animals native to the state.|$|E
25|$|About a {{third of}} the {{population}} is indigenous, mostly Buru, but also Lisela, Ambelau and Kayeli people. The rest of population are immigrants from Java and nearby Maluku Islands. Religious affiliation is evenly split between Christianity and Sunni Islam, with some remnants of traditional beliefs. While local languages and dialects are spoken within individual communities, the national Indonesian language is used among the communities and by the administration. Most of the island is covered with forests rich in tropical flora and fauna. From the present 179 bird and 25 mammal species, about 14 are found either on Buru only or also on a few nearby islands, the most notable being the wild pig Buru <b>babirusa.</b> There is little industry on the island, and most population is engaged in growing rice, maize, sweet potato, beans, coconuts, cocoa, coffee, clove and nutmeg. Other significant activities are animal farming and fishing.|$|E
25|$|As Buru {{is located}} at the {{boundary}} between the biogeographic zones of Australia and Asia, its flora and fauna are unique and are the subject of national and international scientific research. Of 25 species of mammals found on the island, at least four are endemic to Buru and closest to it islands. The local species of the wild pig named Buru <b>babirusa</b> (Babyrousa babyrussa) is distinguished from the other Babyrousa species by having relatively long and thick body-hair. It also has very low fat content in their meat (only 1.27% compared to 5–15% for domestic pigs) and is regarded as a delicacy among the local population, which favours it to other wild pigs or deer in terms of texture and flavour. Also endemic to Buru are three types of bats: Moluccan flying fox (Pteropus chrysoproctus), Ceram fruit bat Pteropus ocularis and lesser tube-nosed bat (Nyctimene minutus).|$|E

2500|$|The {{building}} was originally designed as the zoo's [...] "Elephant House" [...] and has held all three elephant species over its history. The building {{has also been}} home to various rhinoceros species, hippopotamus, domestic bactrian camel, Malayan tapir, and North Sulawesi <b>babirusa.</b> The building also held [...] "Rapunzel", {{one of the few}} Sumatran rhinos held in U.S. zoos, until her death in 2005.|$|E
2500|$|Whereas {{local people}} {{traditionally}} occupied villages, variation of their seasonal activities – predominantly hunting and farming – tended to either disperse or gather them. Men hunted the wild pig Buru <b>babirusa,</b> deer and possum, in the forests, mostly {{during the peak}} of east monsoon (June and July); meanwhile women were gathering wild vegetables. However, during the west monsoon (November to April) {{both men and women}} were working together in the fields. The position of the villages was also changing with time, mostly because of the low soil fertility on the island – recovery of the soil took significant time urging long-distance travel to the new fields. It was rather common for a family to leave the village for most of the week to their field and return only for the religious service on Sunday. It was also rather common to move the entire village after some 20 years of exploiting a plot of land. Partly because of this, most settlements were rather small, with the smallest type accommodating one-two families (hum-hawa or hum-tapa), middle-type (hum-lolin) consisting of 3–10 houses and accommodating 20–50 people, and larger ones of 30–50 houses and 150–300 people (fen-lale). On the coast, there were several multi-ethnic settlements with more than 200 houses (ibu kota kecamatan). This local variety of terms for a [...] "settlement" [...] puzzled the Dutch colonizers trying to systematise the local registries.|$|E
60|$|Here {{again we}} have a {{resemblance}} to the Wart-hogs of Africa, whose upper canines grow outwards and curve up so as to form a transition from the usual mode of growth {{to that of the}} <b>Babirusa.</b> In other respects there seems no affinity between these animals, and the <b>Babirusa</b> stands completely isolated, having no resemblance to the pigs of any other part of the world. It is found all over Celebes and in the Sula islands, and also in Bourn, the only spot beyond the Celebes group to which it extends; and which island also shows some affinity to the Sula islands in its birds, indicating perhaps, a closer connection between them at some former period than now exists.|$|E
6000|$|The strange <b>babirusa</b> of Celebes is {{also found}} in Bouru; but in no other Moluccan island, and it is {{somewhat}} difficult to imagine how it got there. It is true that there is some approximation between the birds of the Sula Islands (where the <b>babirusa</b> {{is also found}}) and those of Bouru, which seems to indicate that these islands have recently been closer together, or that some intervening land has disappeared. At this time the <b>babirusa</b> may have entered Bouru, since it probably swims as well as its allies the pigs. These are spread all over the Archipelago, even to several of the smaller islands, and in many cases the species are peculiar. It is evident, therefore, that they have some natural means of dispersal. There is a popular idea that pigs cannot swim, but Sir Charles Lyell has shown that this is a mistake. In his [...] "Principles of Geology" [...] (10th Edit. vol. ii p. 355) he adduces evidence to show that pigs have swum many miles at sea, and are able to swim with great ease and swiftness. I have myself seen a wild pig swimming across the arm of the sea that separates Singapore from the Peninsula of Malacca, and we thus have explained the curious fact, that of all the large mammals of the Indian region, pigs alone extend beyond the Moluccas and as far as New Guinea, although it is somewhat curious that they have not found their way to Australia.|$|E
6000|$|None {{of these}} three animals last {{mentioned}} has any close allies elsewhere, and their presence in Celebes may be considered the crucial fact which must give us the clue to the past history of the island. Let us then see what they teach us. The ape is apparently somewhat intermediate between the great baboons of Africa and the short-tailed macaques of Asia, but its cranium shows a nearer approach to the former group, in its flat projecting muzzle, large superciliary crests, and maxillary ridges. The anoa, though anatomically allied to the buffaloes, externally more resembles the bovine antelopes of Africa; while the <b>babirusa</b> is altogether unlike any other living member of the swine family, the canines of the upper jaws growing directly upwards like horns, forming a spiral curve over the eyes, instead of downwards, as in all other mammalia. An approach to this peculiarity is made by the African wart-hogs, in which the upper tusk grows out laterally and then curves up; but these animals are not otherwise closely allied to the <b>babirusa.</b> {457} ...|$|E
60|$|I HAD long {{wished to}} visit the large island of Bouru, which lies due west of Ceram, and of which {{scarcely}} anything appeared to be known to naturalists, except that it contained a <b>babirusa</b> very like that of Celebes. I therefore made arrangements for staying there two months after leaving Timor Delli in 1861. This I could conveniently do {{by means of the}} Dutch mail-steamers, which make a monthly round of the Moluccas.|$|E
60|$|In the full-grown male <b>Babirusa</b> pig of Celebes (fig. 64), {{the lower}} tusks are {{formidable}} weapons, {{like those of}} the European boar in the prime of life, whilst the upper tusks are so long and have their points so much curled inwards, sometimes even touching the forehead, that they are utterly useless as weapons of attack. They more nearly resemble horns than teeth, and are so manifestly useless as teeth that the animal was formerly supposed to rest his head by hooking them on to a branch. Their convex surfaces would, however, if the head were held a little laterally, serve as an excellent guard; and hence, perhaps it is that in old animals they “are generally broken off, as if by fighting.”[323] Here, then, we have the curious case of the upper tusks of the <b>Babirusa</b> regularly assuming during the prime of life, a structure which apparently renders them fitted only for defence; whilst in the European boar the lower and opposite tusks assume in a less degree and only during old age nearly the same form, and then serve in like manner solely for defence.|$|E
60|$|The {{remaining}} twelve species are, generally speaking, of Malayan or Asiatic types, {{but some}} of them are so peculiar that they have no near allies in any part of the world; while the rest are of the ordinary Malay type or even identical with Malayan species, and some of these may be recent introductions through human agency. These twelve species of Asiatic type will be now enumerated. They consist of five peculiar squirrels--a group unknown farther east; a peculiar species of wild pig; a deer so closely allied to the Cervus hippelaphus of Borneo that it may well have been introduced by man both here and in the Moluccas; a civet, Viverra tangalunga, common in all the Malay Islands, and also perhaps introduced; the curious Malayan tarsier (Tarsius spectrum) said to be only found in a small island off the coast;--and besides these, three remarkable animals, all of large size and all quite unlike anything found in the Malay Islands or even in Asia. These are a black and almost tailless baboon-like ape (Cynopithecus nigrescens); an antelopean buffalo (Anoa depressicornis), and the strange <b>babirusa</b> (<b>Babirusa</b> alfurus).|$|E
60|$|My {{collections}} in Bouru, though not extensive, were of considerable interest; for out of sixty-six {{species of birds}} which I collected there, no less than seventeen were new, or had not been previously found in any island of the Moluccas. Among these were two kingfishers, Tanysiptera acis and Ceyx Cajeli; a beautiful sunbird, Nectarines proserpina; a handsome little black and white flycatcher, Monarcha loricata, whose swelling throat was beautifully scaled with metallic blue; and several of less interest. I also obtained a skull of the <b>babirusa,</b> one specimen of which was killed by native hunters during my residence at Cajeli.|$|E
60|$|Omitting {{those whose}} {{affinity}} may be pretty clearly traced to groups still inhabiting {{the islands of}} the western or {{the eastern half of}} the Archipelago, we find four birds which have no near allies at all, but appear to be either ancestral forms, or extreme modifications, of Asiatic or {460} African birds--Basilornis, Enodes, Scissirostrum, Ceycopsis. These may fairly be associated with the baboon-ape, anoa, and <b>babirusa,</b> as indicating extreme antiquity and some communication with the Asiatic continent at a period when the forms of life and their geographical distribution differed considerably from what they are at the present time.|$|E
60|$|Briefly to {{summarize}} these peculiarities, Celebes possesses three genera of mammals (out {{of the very}} small number which inhabit it) which are of singular and isolated forms, viz., Cynopithecus, a tailless Ape allied to the Baboons; Anoa, a straight-horned Antelope of obscure affinities, but quite unlike {{anything else in the}} whole archipelago or in India: and <b>Babirusa,</b> an altogether abnormal wild Pig. With a rather limited bird population, Celebes has an immense preponderance of species confined to it, and has also six remarkable genera (Meropogon, Ceycopsis, Streptocitta, Enodes, Scissirostrum, and Megacephalon) entirely restricted to its narrow limits, as well as two others (Prioniturus and Basilornis) which only range to a single island beyond it.|$|E
6000|$|This {{being the}} {{district}} inhabited by that singular annual the <b>Babirusa</b> (Hog-deer), I inquired about skulls and soon obtained several in tolerable condition, {{as well as}} a fine one of the rare and curious [...] "Sapi-utan" [...] (Anoa depressicornis). Of this animal I had seen two living specimens at Menado, and was surprised at their great resemblance to small cattle, or still more to the Eland of South Africa. Their Malay name signifies [...] "forest ox," [...] and they differ from very small highbred oxen principally by the low-hanging dewlap, and straight, pointed horns which slope back over the neck. I did not find the forest here so rich in insects as I had expected, and my hunters got me very few birds, but what they did obtain were very interesting. Among these were the rare forest Kingfisher (Cittura cyanotis), a small new species of Megapodius, and one specimen of the large and interesting Maleo (Megacephalon rubripes), to obtain which was one of my chief reasons for visiting this district. Getting no more, however, after ten days' search, I removed to Licoupang, at the extremity of the peninsula, a place celebrated for these birds, {{as well as for the}} <b>Babirusa</b> and Sapi-utan. I found here Mr. Goldmann, the eldest son of the Governor of the Moluccas, who was superintending the establishment of some Government salt-works. This was a better locality, and I obtained some fine butterflies and very good birds, among which was one more specimen of the rare ground dove (Phlegaenas tristigmata), which I had first obtained near the Maros waterfall in South Celebes.|$|E
6000|$|Arrived at our destination, {{we built}} a but and {{prepared}} for a stay of some days--I to shoot and skin [...] "Maleos", and Mr. Goldmann and the Major to hunt wild pigs, <b>Babirusa,</b> and Sapi-utan. The place is situated in the large bay between the islands of Limbe and Banca, and consists of steep beach {{more than a mile}} in length, of deep loose and coarse black volcanic sand (or rather gravel), very fatiguing to walk over. It is bounded at each extremity by a small river with hilly ground beyond, while the forest behind the beach itself is tolerably level and its growth stunted. We probably have here an ancient lava stream from the Klabat volcano, which has flowed down a valley into the sea, and the decomposition of which has formed the loose black sand. In confirmation of this view, it may be mentioned that the beaches beyond the small rivers in both directions are of white sand.|$|E
60|$|Celebes not Strictly a Continental Island.--A {{study of}} the {{mammalian}} and of the bird-fauna of Celebes thus leads us in both cases to the same conclusion, and forbids us to rank it as a strictly continental island on the Asiatic side. But facts of a very similar character are equally opposed {{to the idea of}} a former land-connection with Australia or New Guinea, or even with the Moluccas. The numerous marsupials of those countries are all wanting in Celebes, except the phalangers of the genus Cuscus, and these arboreal creatures are very liable to be carried across narrow seas on trees uprooted by earthquakes or floods. The terrestrial cassowaries are equally absent; and thus we can account for the presence of all the Moluccan or Australian types actually found in Celebes without supposing any land-connection on this side during the Tertiary period. The presence of the Celebes ape in the island of Batchian, and of the <b>babirusa</b> in Bouru, can be sufficiently explained by a somewhat closer approximation of the respective lands, or by a few intervening islands which have since disappeared, or it may even be due to human agency.|$|E
60|$|The wild pig {{seems to}} be of a species {{peculiar}} to the island; but a much more curious animal of this family is the <b>Babirusa</b> or Pig-deer; so named by the Malays from its long and slender legs, and curved tusks resembling horns. This extraordinary creature resembles a pig in general appearance, {{but it does not}} dig with its snout, as it feeds on fallen fruits. The tusks of the lower jaw are very long and sharp, but the upper ones instead of growing downwards in the usual way are completely reversed, growing upwards out of bony sockets through the skin {{on each side of the}} snout, curving backwards to near the eyes, and in old animals often reaching eight or ten inches in length. It is difficult to understand what can be the use of these extraordinary horn-like teeth. Some of the old writers supposed that they served as hooks, by which the creature could rest its head on a branch. But the way in which they usually diverge just over and in front of the eye has suggested the more probable idea, that they serve to guard these organs from thorns and spines, while hunting for fallen fruits among the tangled thickets of rattans and other spiny plants. Even this, however, is not satisfactory, for the female, who must seek her food in the same way, does not possess them. I should be inclined to believe rather, that these tusks were once useful, and were then worn down as fast as they grew; but that changed conditions of life have rendered them unnecessary, and they now develop into a monstrous form, just as the incisors of the Beaver or Rabbit will go on growing, if the opposite teeth do not wear them away. In old animals they reach an enormous size, and are generally broken off as if by fighting.|$|E

However, hunting remains a significant {{threat to the}} <b>babirusa.</b> Additionally, commercial logging operations threaten the <b>babirusa</b> by habitat loss, and also reduce cover, making the <b>babirusa</b> more exposed to hunters.

50|$|The Buru <b>babirusa</b> (Babyrousa babyrussa), {{also known}} as the Moluccan <b>babirusa,</b> golden <b>babirusa</b> or hairy <b>babirusa,</b> is a wild pig-like animal native to the island of Buru and the two Sula Islands of Mangole and Taliabu, all {{belonging}} to Indonesia. Traditionally, this relatively small species included the other babirusas as subspecies, but it has been recommended treating them as separate species based on differences in their morphology. As also suggested by its alternative common names, the Buru <b>Babirusa</b> has relatively long thick, gold-brown body-hair - a feature not shared by the other extant babirusas.|$|E
