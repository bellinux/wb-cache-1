The sulphides are oxidised to metal oxides or sulphates according to conditions, e. g. temperature and time of heating, composition of surrounding gases, whether under static or dynamic conditions. The mechanisms and kinetics of oxidation depend also on surface area, crystallite and aggregate sizes of the materials and the presence of any impurities. Thus, for <b>basic</b> <b>oxidation</b> studies, finely-divided zinc sulphide samples have been precipitated from solution at various pH levels and in the presence of different concentrations of eletrolytes. These experimental conditions have been correlated with changes in phase composition, surface area and crystallite and aggregate sizes during the formation of the precipitates and their subsequent ageing in solution at various temperatures. The oxidation of the two pure zinc sulphides and five ore Concentrates were investigated using the techniques of thermal analysis, gas sorption, X-ray diffraction, optical and electron microscopy.

A test condition which could be set in both facilities was used to test a C/C based material coated with two different SiC layers and a glass coating to gain information about the impact of the different types of plasma generation on this kind of material. The erosion rates in the thermal arcjet were lower than in the MPG facility although the heat flux necessary to reach the required surface temperature on the sample was significantly higher in the arcjet facility. An additional test series was performed in the MPG wind tunnel to study the influence of a composition of different protection layers made of candidate compounds for use in high-temperature TPS applications. It was found that at low temperatures and low pressures the silica based protection layer was unable to protect from substrate erosion by means of crack sealing. At higher temperatures this feature improved but erosion of the silica layer increased. The combination of a conversion SiC layer and a CVD-SiC layer revealed promising results in terms of their mechanical properties as well as their protective function against oxidation. Erosion of the C/C substrate was found to be particularly severe if a crack within the coating led down onto the graphite matrix between the fibers. It was also shown that self-passivation of a material may be strongly impeded by the high speed, high enthalpy environment typical for re-entry flight.

This study {{investigates the}} {{development}} of a strategy to simulate nuclear graphite oxidation with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to determine an estimate of graphite lost. The task was achieved by comparing the results of the CFD approach with a number of different experiments. For molecular diffusion, simulated results were compared to analytical solutions. Mass flow rates under conditions of natural convection were sourced from the 2002 NACOK experiment. Experimental data from the KAIST facility were sourced for the <b>basic</b> <b>oxidation</b> of graphite in a controlled environment. Tests included the reactions of carbon with oxygen and with carbon dioxide. Finally, the tests at NACOK from 2004 and 2005 were chosen for comparison for the simulation of oxidation. The 2005 test considered two reacting pebble bed regions at different temperatures. The 2004 test included multiple detailed structural graphite. Comparison of results indicated that the phenomenon of diffusion can be correctly simulated. The general trends of the mass flow rates under conditions of natural convection were obtained. Surface reaction rates were defined with user functions in Fluent. Good comparisons of the simulated and the KAIST experimental results were obtained. For the 2005 NACOK comparison, the pebble bed regions were simulated with a porous medium approach. Results showed that correct trends and areas of oxidation were estimated. The 2004 tests were with a combination of a porous medium and surface reaction approaches. More detailed oxidation experimental data would possibly improve the accuracy of the results. This research has shown that the CFD approach developed in the present study can identify areas of maximum oxidation although the accuracy needs to be improved. Both the porous and detailed surface reaction approaches produced consistent results. The limitations of the approach were discussed. These included transient phenomena which were estimated with steady state simulations, and the effects of change in geometry were not considered. Master...|$|E
40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this research effort was to develop methods for labeling biomolecules with higher oxidation state species of At- 211. This was {{to be done in}} an effort to develop reagents that had higher in vivo stability than the present carbon-bonded At- 211 -labeled compounds. We were unsuccessful in that effort, as none of the approaches studied provided reagents that were stable to in vivo deastatination. However, we gained a lot of information about At- 211 in higher oxidation states. The studies proved to be very difficult as small changes in pH and other conditions appeared to change the nature of the species that obtained (by HPLC retention time analyses), with many of the species being unidentifiable. The fact that there are no stable isotopes of astatine, and the chemistry of the nearest halogen iodine is quite different, made it very difficult to interpret results of some experiments. With that said, we believe that a lot of valuable information was obtained from the studies. The research effort evaluated: (1) methods for chemical oxidation of At- 211, (2) approaches to chelation of oxidized At- 211, and (3) approaches to oxidation of astatophenyl compounds. A major hurdle that had to be surmounted to conduct the research was the development of HPLC conditions to separate and identify the various oxidized species formed. Attempts to develop conditions for separation of iodine and astatine species by normal and reversed-phase TLC and ITLC were not successful. However, we were successful in developing conditions (from a large number of attempts) to separate oxidized forms of iodine ([I- 125]iodide, [I- 125]iodate and [I- 125]periodate) and astatine ([At- 211]astatide, [At- 211]astatate, [At- 211]perastatate, and several unidentified At- 211 species).

More stress on the bearing (more active, overweighted, younger patients), and more variability in the implantation technique in different small and large Hospitals may further compromise the clinical performance for many patients. The long-term in vivo performance of these materials remains to be proven. Clinical and retrieval studies after more than 5 years of in vivo use with HXLPE in THR are reviewed and consistently show a substantial decrease in wear rate. Moreover, a second generation of improved polyethylenes is backed by in vitro data and awaits more clinical experience to confirm the experimental improvements. Also, new antioxidant, free radical scavengers, candidates and the reinforcement of polyethylene through composites are currently under <b>basic</b> research. <b>Oxidation</b> of polyethylene is today significantly reduced by present formulations, and this forgiving, affordable, and wellknown material is still reliable to meet today’s higher requirements in total hip replacement...|$|R
40|$|The novel reverse phase-high {{performance}} {{liquid chromatography}} (RP-HPLC), stability indicating method {{was developed for}} determination of linagliptin (LGP) and its related substances in linagliptin and metformin HCl (MET HCl) tablets by implementing design of experiment to understand the critical method parameters and their relation with critical method attributes; to ensure robustness of the method. The separation of nine specified impurities was achieved with a Zorbax SB-Aq 250 × 4. 6 mm, 5 µm column, using gradient elution and a detector wavelength of 225 nm, and validated in accordance with International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines and found to be accurate, precise, reproducible, robust, and specific. The drug {{was found to be}} degrading extensively in heat, humidity, <b>basic,</b> and <b>oxidation</b> conditions and was forming degradation products during stability studies. After slight modification in the buffer and the column, the same method was used for liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and ultra-performance liquid chromatography -time-of-flight/mass spectrometry UPLC-TOF/MS analysis, to identify m/z and fragmentation of maximum unspecified degradation products i. e., Impurity-VII (7), Impurity-VIII (8), and Impurity-IX (9) formed during stability studies. Based on the results, a degradation pathway for the drug has been proposed and synthesis of Impurity-VII (7) is also discussed to ensure an in-depth understanding of LGP and its related degradation products and optimum performance during the lifetime of the product...|$|R
40|$|A sensitive, selective, precise, and stability-indicating {{high-performance}} thin-layer chromatographic (HPTLC) {{method for}} the analysis of stavudine both as a bulk drug and in formulations is developed and validated. The solvent system consisted of toluene–methanol–chloroform–acetone (7. 0 : 3. 0 : 1. 0 : 1. 0, v/v/v/v). Densitometric analysis of stavudine is carried out in the absorbance mode at 270 nm. This system is found to give compact spots for stavudine (retention factor value of 0. 45 ± 0. 05) following development of chromatoplates with the mobile phase. Stavudine is subjected to acid and alkali hydrolysis, oxidation, dry-heat and wet-heat treatment, and photo and UV degradation. The drug undergoes degradation under acidic and <b>basic</b> conditions, <b>oxidation,</b> and wet-heat degradation. Linearity is found to be in the range of 30 – 1000 ng/spot with a significantly high value of correlation coefficient. The linear regression analysis data for the calibration plots show a good linear relationship with r 2 = 0. 9997 ± 0. 05 in the working concentration range of 300 to 1000 ng/spot. The mean value of slope and intercept are 0. 10 ± 0. 06 and 22. 12 ± 1. 08, respectively. The method is validated for precision, robustness, and recovery. The limits of detection and quantitation are 10 and 30 ng/spot, respectively. The proposed HPTLC method is utilized to investigate the kinetics of the acid degradation process. Arrhenius plot is constructed and activation energy is calculated...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis work {{describes}} the stability-indicating {{determination of the}} H 2 -receptor antagonist nizatidine in its bulk and capsules dosage form using high performance liquid chromatography coupled with diode array detector (HPLC-DAD). The developed method involved the use of Thermo Hypersil BDS-C 8 (4. 6 × 250 mm, 5 μm particle size) column and a mobile phase composed of 0. 05 M phosphoric acid and acetonitrile (50 : 50, v/v). The mobile phase was pumped at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. Quantification of nizatidine was based on measuring its peak area at 320 nm. The retention time for nizatidine was about 3. 61 min. The reliability and analytical performance of the proposed HPLC procedure were statistically validated with respect to linearity, range, precision, accuracy, specificity, robustness, detection and quantification limits. Calibration curve of nizatidine was linear {{in the range of}} 5 – 50 μg/mL with correlation coefficient > 0. 9999. The drug was subjected to forced-degradation conditions of acidic and <b>basic</b> hydrolysis, <b>oxidation,</b> dry heat and UV photolysis where it showed considerable degradation in basic and oxidative conditions. The proposed method proved to be specific and stability-indicating by resolution of the drug from its forced-degradation products. The validated HPLC method was applied to the analysis of nizatidine in capsules dosage form where it was quantified with recoveries not less than 98. 2 %. Assay results were statistically compared to USP 2011 pharmacopeial method where no significant difference was observed between the proposed and reference methods...|$|R
30|$|Moreover, {{the land}} use {{practices}} such as cultivation and continuous use of inorganic fertilizers might {{have contributed to the}} decline in soil pH (increased soil acidity) at the surface soils of the cultivated land. In line with this, Kang and Osinama (1985) and Gebrekidan and Negassa (2006) reported that the use of acidifying mineral fertilizers and intensive cultivation enhanced leaching of <b>basic</b> cations and <b>oxidation</b> of organic matter that eventually reduced soil pH. In general, as per the soil pH (H 2 O) rating scale of Tadesse (1991), the mean soil pH (H 2 O) (1 : 2.5  H 2 O) of the study area indicated moderate acid soils in grazing and forest lands and strong acid soils in cultivated land. This soil pH of cultivated land was also lower than the most suitable soil pH range (5.5 – 7) for most grain and vegetable crops that might affect their growth and development.|$|R
40|$|The {{photocatalytic}} oxidation (PCO) of UV-irradiated aqueous solutions containing lignin on TiO 2 was {{studied for}} {{the influence of}} ferrous ions. The addition of Fe 2 +, up to 2. 8 mg L− 1, to the acidic lignin solution leads to the drastic, for about 25 %, increase in PCO efficiency. A further increase in ferrous ion concentration results in a decrease in PCO efficiency of lignin. The maximum PCO efficiency, up to 9. 2 mg W− 1 h− 1, was observed in neutral and slightly <b>basic</b> media: the <b>oxidation</b> mechanism with OH-radicals seems to prevail. Also, {{the difference in the}} PCO performance with a different attachment mode of titanium dioxide on the catalyst support was observed. Sprayed catalyst exhibited 1. 5 times higher efficiency than the one attached by submersion, although sprayed one was easily resuspended in acidic lignin solutions. The efficiency of the N-doped photocatalyst active in visible light was observed to be negligible with lignin...|$|R
40|$|Nitro {{complexes}} of bis(bipyridyl) ruthenium(III) are unstable {{with respect}} to oxidation of the coordinated nitro ligand. For the complexes Ru(bpy),(L) NOz' (L = NH,, py (pyridine), pyr (pyrazine), CH 3 CN, PPh,) and Ru(bpy),(CI) N 02, electrochemical oxidation to the ruthenium(II 1) state results in production of the corresponding nitrosyl and nitrato complexes in a 1 :l ratio. A two-electron oxidation of the nitro ligand to nitrate occurs, and the corresponding reduction is delocalized over two sites, one at the metal (Ru"' - Ru") and one at the ligand (RuNO' - Ru&O). For the chloro complex the rate of disappearance of Ru"'(bpy),(C 1) NOz+ is first order in Ru(II 1) and the rate constant, determined by monitoring the reaction by cyclic voltammetry, is 1. 8 X sd in acetonitrile at room temperature. For the pyridyl complex, variable scan-rate cyclic voltammetry experiments show the intervention of an intermediate past the initial oxidation step. A mechanism is suggested for the oxidation of coordinated nitrite which consists of an initial rearrangement of the nitro ligand from N bound to 0 bound. The 0 -bound isomer is a reactive intermediate which undergoes a bimolecular oxygen atom transfer reaction probably with the corresponding Ru"-N 02 complex to give the observed products. The acid-base properties of the R~(bpy) ~(py) NO~~-Ru(bpy) ~(pya) cNidO-~ba's e pair and formal reduction potentials for the chloro and pyridyl complexes as two-electron-acceptor, oxide ion donor oxidants have been determined.
