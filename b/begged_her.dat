5|$|Tessa Ludwick {{was born}} October 5, 1988 in Seoul, South Korea. Ludwick's career began at age {{two and a}} half when Ludwick saw a {{television}} advertisement about modeling and <b>begged</b> <b>her</b> mother to call the number. Her modeling led to acting roles.|$|E
5|$|Lexie feels guilt {{following}} George's death, having {{abandoned their}} friendship after {{he failed to}} reciprocate her romantic feelings towards him. Mark comforts her, and she eventually agrees to move into his new apartment with him. Thatcher is {{admitted into the hospital}} with liver failure stemming from his former alcoholism. When Lexie is found to not be a suitable transplant candidate, Meredith steps in and donates part of her liver, not to help Thatcher, but to spare Lexie the grief of losing her father and because Lexie inappropriately pulled Meredith's medical files and <b>begged</b> <b>her</b> to.|$|E
5|$|Kosara then <b>begged</b> <b>her</b> {{father for}} Vladimir's hand, and the tsar granted her request. He {{restored}} his new son-in-law {{to the throne}} of Duklja. In reality, the marriage was probably a result of Samuel's political assessment: he may have decided that Vladimir {{would be a more}} loyal vassal if he was married to his daughter. Resolving thus the question of Duklja, Samuel could concentrate more troops in Macedonia and Thessaly, the main site of his conflict with Byzantium. The chronicle claims that the tsar also gave Vladimir the whole territory of Dyrrachium. The prince could in fact have been given a northern part of that territory, which was partially under Samuel's rule. A brief note on Vladimir by John Skylitzes may indicate that the prince also received some territory in Raška. His paternal uncle Dragimir, ruler of Travunia and Zachlumia, who had retreated before Samuel's army, was given back his lands to rule, also as the tsar's vassal.|$|E

25|$|Since Zeus {{could not}} undo {{what she had}} done, he gave him the gift of prophecy. An {{alternative}} and less commonly told story has it that Tiresias was blinded by Athena after he stumbled onto her bathing naked. His mother, Chariclo, <b>begged</b> <b>her</b> to undo her curse, but Athena could not; she gave him prophecy instead.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, {{she watched}} the musical film Fame and {{subsequently}} {{made the decision to}} pursue a musical career. Jacqueline and Anthony Adams enrolled her at Jason Theatre School. In 1991, Beckham entered Laine Theatre Arts in Epsom, Surrey and studied dance and modelling. Beckham attended St. Mary's High School in Cheshunt, where she was embarrassed by her family's wealth and often <b>begged</b> <b>her</b> father not to drop her off outside the school in their Rolls Royce. Eventually, she became a member of a band called Persuasion.|$|E

25|$|Soon {{thereafter}} there ensued {{a massive}} famine, {{and everyone was}} reduced to devouring not only grapes, but all sorts of plants and even animals {{in an attempt to}} satiate their hunger. Of them only Hwang-gung 황궁(黃穹) came forth to Mago 마고(麻姑) and <b>begged</b> <b>her</b> for forgiveness. He swore he would not rest until mankind could recover its pure nature. From her he obtained the Three Heavenly Heirlooms, and great knowledge. He then called together all the people of the earth, taught them agriculture, and gave each clan leader a Heavenly Heirloom and then sent them off in different directions to people the earth.|$|E
25|$|Babe strikes up a {{friendship}} with Bianca Montgomery during December 2003. They grow close and become best friends. At a cabin, while a storm goes on outside, Babe helps Bianca give birth to her baby daughter, Miranda Montgomery. Bianca falls unconscious and Babe leaves to go get help. She breaks into Dr. David Hayward's cabin and calls Paul at Llanview Hospital for help. The day before (on One Life to Live), Paul helped his sister, Kelly, {{give birth to a}} baby boy, but the baby died right after birth. Kelly, believing a baby would be {{the only thing that could}} save her marriage, <b>begged</b> <b>her</b> brother to get her a child. Paul helps Babe get back to the cabin, where he delivers her son by the fireplace.|$|E
25|$|Minna {{soon found}} that being Wagner's wife {{was not the}} route to respectability that she craved. Wagner {{continued}} to run up debts, and she frequently {{had to deal with}} creditors not only from Königsberg, but also from Wagner's previous expenditure in Magdeburg. Wagner's position brought in little money and Minna's continued popularity on stage meant that she was the main bread-winner, earning 700 reichsthaler in 1836. She continued to have admirers, and on 31 May 1837 Minna ran away from Wagner with a local businessman named Dietrich, taking Nathalie with her. Wagner eventually found her at her parents' home in Dresden, and <b>begged</b> <b>her</b> to return to him. Despite another short reconciliation, Minna ran away again with Dietrich in July 1837. It was only in October that Minna finally {{had a change of heart}} and returned to Wagner, who had taken up a post in Riga as Music Director.|$|E

25|$|The {{publication}} of the book was the means of putting Booth at once into communication with the author and his wife, who <b>begged</b> <b>her</b> to visit them in Switzerland; and it subsequently brought about a correspondence with most of those European sympathizers with the North who handled a pen, such as Augustin Cochin, Edouard Laboulaye, Henri Martin, Edmond de Pressense, Conte du Montalembert, Monseigneur Dupanloup, and others, — men of all shades of religious and political belief at home, but united in the hatred of slavery, and in sympathy for the cause in whose success its extinction was involved. These gentlemen vied {{with each other in}} sending her advance-sheets of their boots, and numerous articles, letters, and pamphlets to meet the question of the day, which she swiftly translated, publishing them without money and without price, in the daily journals, and through the avenues afforded by the Union League Club. In return, she kept these noble Frenchmen accurately informed of the progress of events, and sent them such publications as could be of service.|$|E
25|$|Relevant {{evidence}} suggests that Eleanor was not fluent in English, but was accustomed to read, and so presumably to think and speak, in French, her mother's tongue, with which {{she would have been}} familiar from childhood despite spending her early years in Spain. In this she was luckier than many medieval European queens, who often arrived in their husband's realms to face the need to learn a new language; but the English court was still functionally bilingual, in large measure through the long succession of its queens, who were mostly from French-speaking lands. In 1275, on a visit to St Albans abbey in Hertfordshire, the people of the town <b>begged</b> <b>her</b> help in withstanding the abbot's exactions from them, but one of her courtiers had to act as translator before she could respond to the plea for assistance. All the literary works noted above are in French, as are the bulk of her surviving letters, and since Peckham wrote his letters and his angelic treatise for her in French, she was presumably well known to prefer that language.|$|E
25|$|In April 1889, Florence Maybrick bought flypaper {{containing}} arsenic {{from a local}} chemist's {{shop and}} later soaked it {{in a bowl of}} water. At her trial, she claimed that this method allowed her to extract the arsenic for cosmetic use. James Maybrick was taken ill on 27 April 1889 after self-administering a double dose of strychnine. His doctors treated him for acute dyspepsia, but his condition deteriorated. On 8 May Florence Maybrick wrote a compromising letter to Brierley, which was intercepted by Alice Yapp, the nanny. Yapp passed it to James Maybrick's brother, Edwin, who was staying at Battlecrease. Edwin, himself by many accounts one of Florence's lovers, shared the contents of the letter with his brother Michael Maybrick, who was effectively the head of the family. By Michael's orders Florence was immediately deposed as mistress of her house and held under house arrest. On 9 May a nurse reported that Mrs Maybrick had surreptitiously tampered with a Valentine's Meat Juice bottle that was afterwards found to contain a half-grain of arsenic. Mrs Maybrick later testified that her husband had <b>begged</b> <b>her</b> to administer it as a pick-me-up. However, he never drank its contents.|$|E

25|$|In 1927, {{she decided}} to turn down a million dollar a year (approx. $13.6 million in 2017) {{contract}} with Paramount to join the newly created United Artists, where she was her own boss and could make the films she wanted, with whom she wanted, and when. Her first independent film, The Love of Sunya, was directed by Albert Parker, based on the play The Eyes of Youth, by Max Marcin and Charles Guernon. Produced by and starring Swanson, it co-starred John Boles and Pauline Garon. It {{is the story of}} a young woman granted the ability to see into her future, including her future with different men. The story had been filmed previously as Eyes of Youth starring Clara Kimball Young (that production was also directed by Albert Parker and was responsible for the discovery of Rudolph Valentino by June Mathis). The production was marred by several problems, mainly a suitable cameraman to deal with the film's intricate double exposures, as Swanson was not used to taking charge, and filming took place in New York. The film premiered at the grand opening of the Roxy Theatre in New York City on March 11, 1927. (Swanson was pictured in the ruins of the Roxy on October 14, 1960, during the demolition of the theater, in a famous photo taken by Time-Life photographer Eliot Elisofon and published in Life magazine.) The production had been a disaster and Swanson felt its success would be mediocre at best. On the advice of Joseph Schenck, Swanson returned to Hollywood, where Schenck <b>begged</b> <b>her</b> to film something more commercial. She agreed but ended up filming the more controversial Sadie Thompson instead.|$|E

500|$|In {{the fall}} of 1846 Stone {{informed}} her family of her intention to become a woman’s rights lecturer. Her brothers were at once supportive, her father encouraged her {{to do what she}} considered her duty, but her mother and only remaining sister <b>begged</b> <b>her</b> to reconsider. To her mother's fears that she would be reviled, Stone said she knew she would be disesteemed and even hated, but she must [...] "pursue that course of conduct which, to me, appears best calculated to promote the highest good of the world.” ...|$|E
500|$|After hearing this, the Duke of Marlborough, {{realising}} that Anne {{intended to}} dismiss them, <b>begged</b> <b>her</b> {{to keep them}} in their offices for nine months, until the campaign was over, so that they could retire honourably. However, Anne told Marlborough that [...] "for her [...] honour" [...] Sarah was to resign immediately and return her gold key – the symbol of her authority within the Royal household – within two days. Years of trying the Queen's patience had finally resulted in her dismissal. When told the news, Sarah, in a fit of pride, told Marlborough to return the key to the Queen immediately.|$|E
