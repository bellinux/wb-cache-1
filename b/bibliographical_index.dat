40|$|Models of <b>bibliographical</b> <b>Indexing</b> {{concern the}} {{construction}} of effective key-word t axonomies and the represent ation of relevance between document s and keywords. The theory of evidence concerns the elicitation and manipulation of degrees of belief rendered by multiple sources of evidence to {{a common set of}} propositions. The paper presents a formal framework in which adaptive tax-onomies and probabilistic indexing are induced dynamically by the relevance opinions of the library's patrons. Different measures of relevance and mech-anisms for combining them are presented and shown to be isomorphic to the belief functions and combination rules of the theory of evidence. The paper thus has two objectives: (i) to treat formally slippery concepts like probabilis-tic indexing and average relevance, and (ii) to provide an intuitive justification to the Dempster Shafer theory of evidence, using <b>bibliographical</b> <b>indexing</b> as a canonical example...|$|R

British historians of India, such as Mountstuart Elphinstone, had largely ignored the rural aristocracy and fiscal matters, which Elliot believed could usefully be investigated by resort to hitherto neglected medieval chronicles. He saw his <b>Bibliographical</b> <b>Index</b> to the Historians of Mohammedan India , published in 1849, as a prelude to a study of 231 Arabic and Persian historians of India and also a resource that would prove to be of benefit to future historians.

The data was collected from two sources. A self-administered questionnaire was used to obtain demographic data, their opinion on {{the adequacy of the}} computer facilities made available for them and the types of use they made of the computers for research purposes. Data on the total number and type of publications authored was obtained from the questionnaire, and the annual reports of academic staff publications for the years 1990 to 1995. The results revealed that the majority of both academic engineers and scientists made frequent use of computers for research. However, the scientists indicated a more varied use than the engineers. Both groups reported frequent use of computers for word processing (83 % to 90 %), sending or receiving e-mails (66 % to 71 %) and searching for information in the Internet (41 % to 51 %). Computers are least used for keeping personal <b>bibliographical</b> <b>indexes</b> (8 % to 11 %). For the academic scientists, the total publication productivity is correlated (£ 0. 01) to using computers for creating databases, word processing, slide presenta-tions, sending or receiving emails, obtaining information from the Internet and main-taining personal <b>bibliographical</b> <b>indexes.</b> For the academic engineers the total publication output is not correlated with frequent use of computers for research, although the mean score for each type of computer use is high.

As a document, a dissertation provides data on new knowledge, but also encodes important scientometric information.

PhD records may expose a scientific relation of research-advising both at the personal and institutional levels within a certain scientific area.
