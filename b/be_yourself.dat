25|$|Activate is {{a network}} of young leaders in South Africa which aims {{to bring about change}} though {{creative}} solutions to problems in society. Youth from all backgrounds and provinces in the country participate in a two-year programme. In the first year, there are three residential training programmes, working on a particular task. In the second year, participants form action groups on specific tasks, taking their work into the public domain. In one example, an Activator describes how he works in his local community to discourage young people away from joining gangs and engaging in substance abuse. He draws on his own negative experiences with gangs and drugs, having served seven years in jail. On being interviewed, he states: “My vision for South Africa is to see young people standing up and becoming role models... <b>Be</b> <b>yourself,</b> be real and pursue your dreams”.|$|E
25|$|Back on Broadway, Arthur {{continued}} {{to appear in}} small plays that received little attention. Critics, however, {{continued to}} praise her in their reviews. It {{has been argued that}} in this period, Arthur developed confidence in her acting craft for the first time. On the contrast between films in Hollywood and plays in New York, Arthur commented:I don't think Hollywood is the place to <b>be</b> <b>yourself.</b> The individual ought to find herself before coming to Hollywood. On the stage I found myself to be in a different world. The individual counted. The director encouraged me and I learned how to be myself.... I learned to face audiences and to forget them. To see the footlights and not to see them; to gauge the reactions of hundreds of people, and yet to throw myself so completely into a role that I was oblivious to their reaction.|$|E

500|$|Learning to <b>be</b> <b>yourself,</b> to be {{authentic}} and to act with integrity, rather than conforming to any external moral system, is arguably the fundamental motif of Williams's work, according to Sophie Grace Chappell. [...] "If there's one theme in all my work it's about authenticity and self-expression," [...] Williams said in 2002. [...] "It's the idea that some things are in some real sense really you, or express what you and others aren't... The whole thing has been about spelling out the notion of inner necessity." [...] He moved moral philosophy away from the Kantian question, [...] "What is my duty?", {{and back to the}} issue that mattered to the Greeks: [...] "How should we live?" ...|$|E

500|$|In its {{original}} American broadcast, [...] "Buy, Buy Baby" [...] was watched by approximately 3.7million households, according to Nielsen ratings. The episode achieved an 11% {{in the key}} 1849 demographics among adults. It was the eighth highest-rated show on the NBC network that week. Since airing, the episode has received mixed reviews from television critics. R.D. Heldenfels of the Akron Beacon Journal said Spears' appearance on the show was [...] "uninspired". Lenny Ann Low of The Sydney Morning Herald commented that Spears as a right-wing co-host was a miss. [...] "It proves she can talk and avoid the furniture but her flitting, one-dimensional character feels like a stunt." [...] In Low's opinion, {{the only thing that}} saved the episode from a [...] "thumbs down", was [...] "its message about finding the courage to <b>be</b> <b>yourself</b> in a sea of conservatism, saccharine though that sounds." [...] Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune thought Spears [...] "bombed" [...] in the episode, and [...] Jeff Hidek of Star-News disliked the Southern accent she used in her performance. The Plain Dealers Mark Dawidziak commented: [...] "Granted, the episode wasn't very well written, but Spears seemed more out of place on the show than Megan Mullally's Karen at a sensitivity seminar." ...|$|E
500|$|Vocalist David Draiman states that, lyrically, {{the album}} was {{inspired}} by various occurrences of bad luck that happened to him. [...] "I had a motorcycle accident, and I had my garage burn down with most of my vehicles," [...] Draiman commented. [...] "...I've had really bad relationships that I've {{been in and out}} of. They've left their mark", he concluded. The song [...] "Indestructible" [...] is [...] "an anthem for soldiers", Draiman comments. [...] "It's meant to be something that would make them feel invincible, take away their fear, make them strong and that's what this whole body of work on this record does. It's music to help you feel strong," [...] he concludes. Cuts such as [...] "Deceiver" [...] and [...] "Inside the Fire" [...] are about [...] "really bad relationships". [...] "Inside the Fire" [...] is about [...] "standing over the body of my girlfriend, who just killed herself, and the Devil is standing over me, whispering in my ear to kill myself," [...] says Draiman. The song [...] "The Night" [...] is, [...] "just kind of meant to portray the night almost as like a living entity that sets you free. You're enveloped by it, enmasked by it," [...] Draiman comments. The band's vocalist also says the song [...] "Perfect Insanity" [...] is about [...] "toying with the idea of insanity. Coming at you from the perspective from the individual who is [...] and warning people around him, particularly his love interests, about his psychotic tendencies." [...] Draiman says the track [...] "Divide" [...] "is meant to detract from the idea 'oh, let's all be one, let's all be united!' Fuck that, <b>be</b> <b>yourself,</b> be an individual, stand out, make your mark, make an impact." [...] Commenting on the meaning of the song [...] "Façade", Draiman says it is, [...] "...a song {{from the perspective of a}} girl in a relationship where she's abused... she's thinking about killing him, like you see on the news." ...|$|E

[...] Virgil Thomson found this process frustrating: [...] "Anyone who allowed her in any piece to tell him what to do next would see that piece ruined before his eyes by the application of routine recipes and bromides from standard repertory." [...] Copland recalled that [...] "she had but one all-embracing principle...the creation of what she called la grande ligne - the long line in music." [...] She disapproved of innovation for innovation's sake: [...] "When you are writing music of your own, never strain to avoid the obvious."

2500|$|In his 2009 book [...] "Parkour", David Belle {{stressed}} {{that the most important}} aspect of parkour is not the physical movements, but rather the practitioner's mentality and understanding of its principles. [...] "When young trainees come to see me and give me videos telling me to check out what they are doing, I just take the tape and throw it away. What I'm interested in is what the guy's got in his head, if he has self-confidence, if he masters the technique, if he has understood the principles of parkour. I just can't deal with guys who do Parkour because they saw videos on the Internet and thought it was kinda cool and want to do even better." [...] Further, he states the importance of traceurs being aware of their abilities and limitations, and developing in their own way. [...] "When a young person asks me: 'Can you show me how to do this?' I simply answer: [...] "No, I am going to show you how I do it. Then, you'll have to learn with your own technique, your own way of moving, your style, your abilities and your limitations.

2500|$|The duo's next album, <b>Be</b> <b>Yourself</b> Tonight, was {{produced}} in a week in Paris. It showcased {{much more of a}} [...] "band style" [...] and a centred sound (with an R influence), with real drums, brass, and much more guitar from Stewart. Almost a dozen other musicians were enlisted, including members of Tom Petty's Heartbreakers, guest harmonica from Stevie Wonder, bass guitar from Dean Garcia, string arrangements by Michael Kamen, and Lennox singing duets with Aretha Franklin and Elvis Costello. It continued the duo's transatlantic chart domination in 1985, and contained four hit singles: [...] "Would I Lie to You?" [...] was a U.S. Billboard top five hit and Australian number one, while [...] "There Must Be an Angel (Playing with My Heart)" [...] (featuring Wonder's harmonica contribution) became their first and only UK number one single. The feminist anthem [...] "Sisters Are Doin' It for Themselves" [...] (a duet with Aretha Franklin, though originally intended for Tina Turner), and [...] "It's Alright (Baby's Coming Back)" [...] also rode high in the charts.

2500|$|In 1986, LaBelle {{released}} her best-selling solo album to date with Winner in You with the album reaching {{number one on}} the pop charts. The album included the international number-one hit, [...] "On My Own" [...] and the hit ballad [...] "Oh People". The success of Winner in You would prove to be the peak of her solo success, though she continued her acclaim with the 1989 release of <b>Be</b> <b>Yourself,</b> which featured [...] "Yo Mister" [...] and the hit ballad [...] "If You Asked Me To", which found bigger success in a remake by singer Celine Dion. In the year of that album's release, LaBelle began a successful stint in a recurring role on A Different World, the success of which spawned a brief sitcom of her own, titled Out All Night, which only lasted a season. In 1991, she recorded a hit duet version of the Babyface composition, [...] "Superwoman" [...] with Gladys Knight and Dionne Warwick. The trio had previously appeared in the Sisters in the Name of Love TV special in 1987. The same year of the release of [...] "Superwoman", LaBelle issued the solo album, Burnin', which went gold, with three successive top five singles on the R charts. This success led to LaBelle winning her first Grammy Award in the Best Female R Vocal Performance category in the 34th Annual Grammy Award Ceremony of 1992, sharing the win with singer Lisa Fischer, who won for her hit ballad, [...] "How Can I Ease the Pain", in a rare tie {{in the history of the}} Grammys.|$|E
