50|$|In 2010, the NSW Minister for Health {{announced}} {{again that}} a new hospital would be built in Frenchs Forest; as of January 2011, no <b>budget</b> <b>monies</b> have been allocated to the building of this hospital and no works have started. Meanwhile, the division of care between Manly and Mona Vale Hospital is being undertaken, with the two hospitals offering different services.|$|E
50|$|Deferred {{maintenance}} is {{the practice of}} postponing maintenance activities such as repairs on both real property (i.e. infrastructure) and personal property (i.e. machinery) {{in order to save}} costs, meet budget funding levels, or realign available <b>budget</b> <b>monies.</b> The failure to perform needed repairs could lead to asset deterioration and ultimately asset impairment. Generally, a policy of continued deferred maintenance may result in higher costs, asset failure, and in some cases, health and safety implications.|$|E
50|$|McDiarmid championed public schools, {{as well as}} {{improved}} {{services for}} children and women and distribution of state <b>budget</b> <b>monies</b> according to population. Several newspaper surveys ranked her among the ten most effective delegates. McDiarmid succeeded in adding kindergarten to the public school schedule, as well as helped create George Mason University and five community colleges in Northern Virginia. Early in her political career, she proposed Virginia's creation of a Committee on the Status of Women, which was defeated legislatively, but established as an executive branch committee by Governor Albertis S. Harrison Jr.. McDiarmid also advocated ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and abolition of the death penalty, but her Virginia General Assembly colleagues never passed those measures (although the 1970 Virginia constitution does include an equal rights section).|$|E
5000|$|In summary, Edinburgh Council {{was faced}} with {{increasing}} issues with private and public transport, yet it had limited options, and a challenging set of finances, being limited to its annual transportation <b>budget,</b> along with <b>monies</b> collected from parking charges.|$|R
5000|$|By {{the early}} part of the 19th century North Stonington's {{residents}} began to regard themselves as possessing a character separate from the communities of the southern part of the town to which they were still connected. The communities of Mystic, Stonington Borough, and Pawcatuck were far away—by the standards of the pre-automobile era—and, being of a seafaring nature, the [...] "southerners" [...] possessed significantly different needs and interests. Efforts by the southern communities from the late 18th century to build a number of relatively expensive construction projects along the coastline, such as a new road from Stonington Borough to Mystic and a bridge over Lambert's Cove, at first led residents of the northern end of the town to oppose <b>budgeting</b> <b>monies</b> for these projects, and eventually caused the northerners to secede and form their own town. At a town hall meeting at Stonington's Road Church in April 1807, a small majority of voters decided for division, using the old dividing line between the North and South societies of the Congregationalist Church as the demarcation line. The new town then sent a request for the State Assembly to approve the measure.|$|R

40|$|Engineering {{managers}} must routinely {{make decisions}} on how to allocate limited resources to achieve the most benefit. Energy conservation and increased or new productivity are two areas which compete for operating and capital budgets. This paper will describe how these objectives can be compared and properly addressed {{to result in a}} more satisfactory and reliable decision when allocating <b>budget</b> <b>monies.</b> Comparisons are made using a model to evaluate risk vs. return. The model numerically expresses alternatives in terms of confidence ratios or relative payouts modified by achievement probability...|$|E

40|$|Development, {{subject as}} above. 2. (C) Subsequent to {{approval}} by the Chief of Staff of reference, representatives of the Army Ballistic Missiles Agency indicated that supplementary guidance would be required concerning {{the scope of the}} preliminary investigation specified in the reference. In particular these representatives requested guidance concerning the source of funds required to conduct the investigation. 3. (S) I envision expeditious development of the proposal to establish a lunar outpost to be of critical importance to the U. S. Army of the future. This evaluation is apparently shared by the Chief of Staff in view of his expeditious approval and enthusiastic endorsement of initiation of the study. Therefore, the detail to be covered by the investigation and the subsequent plan should be as complete as is feasible in the time limits allowed and within the funds currently available within the office of the Chief of Ordnance. In this time of limited <b>budget,</b> additional <b>monies</b> are unavailable. Current programs have been scrutinized rigidly and identifiable "fat " trimmed away. Thus high study costs are prohibitive at this time. 4. (C) I leave it to your discretion to determine the source and the amount i money to bo devoted to this purpose...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedAfter {{the attacks of}} September 11, 2001, {{and the creation of}} the federal Department of Homeland Security in 2002, many local agencies formed their own homeland security entity. Since that time, significant economic downturns have resulted in reductions in the amount of homeland security funding available to local jurisdictions. Another issue involves the lack of a common definition of homeland security and what it entails and how daily operations are conducted to forward the mission. A jurisdiction wishing to continue to support a homeland security entity needs to make sound decisions as it pertains to these issues in an effort to provide the greatest service to its communities. This thesis analyzed three homeland security organizational structures located within the Metro Atlanta, GA, area to find their advantages and disadvantages using a case study method. The analysis for these structures was based on the mission of each structure, as evaluated based on the 2014 Quadrennial Homeland Security Report, or the mission of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or both if applicable, their operational functions as they pertain to the mission, and an inspection of each jurisdiction’s financial records relating to the overall department budget, homeland security <b>budget,</b> and grant <b>monies.</b> Advantages were noted for all structures along with recommendations that included the addition of mission-specific experts, the improvement of information sharing, jurisdictional relationships, cyber protection, and the proper development of a mission statement.
