Recently, high frequency (greater than 8 c/min) phasic contractions {{or absence of}} phasic activity were recorded in patients with postcholecystectomy or pancreatic complaints, possibly suggesting a sphincter of Oddi dysfunction. In the present study, sphincter of Oddi (biliary tract) phasic contractility was measured by perendoscopic manometry in 13 subjects without specific clinical symptoms of biliopancreatic disease and with a normal common bile and pancreatic duct at ERCP. Four T-tube patients with no evidence of common bile duct stones or papillary stenosis were studied for comparison (transductal sphincter of Oddi manometry). <b>Basal</b> <b>frequency</b> was found to range from 0 to 7 c/min (M +/- SE: 2. 99 +/- 0. 46) in perendoscopic manometry (85 min of recording time) and from 0 to 12 c/min (2. 0 +/- 0. 3) in transductal manometry (2546 min of recording time). Long lasting transductal recordings also showed that frequency of activity derived from the sphincter area varied cyclically in close relation with the duodenal migrating motor complex.

40|$|Background—An {{elevated}} {{level of}} homocysteine (hyperhomocysteinemia) has been implicated {{as an independent}} risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Deficiency of dietary factors like vitamin B 12, folate, and genetic variations can cause hyperhomocysteinemia. The prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia in the Indian population {{is likely to be}} high because most Indians adhere to a vegetarian diet, deficient in vitamin B 12. In the background of vitamin B 12 deficiency, variations in genes involved in homocysteine metabolism might have a greater impact on homocysteine levels. Methods and Results—We genotyped 44 nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) from 11 genes involved in homocysteine metabolism and found only 14 to be polymorphic. These 14 nsSNPs were genotyped in 546 individuals recruited from a tertiary care center in New Delhi, India, and it was found that choline dehydrogenase (CHDH A 119 C) and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR C 677 T) were significantly associated with plasma total homocysteine levels (P 0. 009 and P 0. 001, respectively). These 2 SNPs were further genotyped in 330 individuals recruited from the same center, and the association remained significant even after increasing the sample size. Furthermore, we found the possibility of a significant interaction between vegetarian diet and the 2 polymorphisms that could explain the variation of homocysteine levels.

Catecholamine secretion {{was measured by}} oxidative amperometry and cell membrane turnover was measured by voltage clamp cell capacitance measurements. The sAPs evoked inward Na+ and Ca 2 + currents that were statistically identical to those evoked by native action potential waveforms. On average, a single secretory granule underwent fusion following sAP stimulation. An equivalent amount of membrane was then quickly internalised (τ = 560 ms). Stimulation with sAP trains revealed a biphasic relationship between cell firing rate and endocytic activity. At <b>basal</b> stimulus <b>frequencies</b> (single to 0. 5 Hz) cells exhibited a robust membrane internalisation that then diminished as firing increased to intermediate levels (1. 9 and 6 Hz). However at the higher stimulation rates (10 and 16 Hz) endocytic activity rebounded and was again able to effectively maintain cell surface near pre-stimulus levels. Treatment with cyclosporin A and FK 506, inhibitors of the phosphatase calcineurin, left endocytosis characteristics unaltered at the lower basal stimulus levels, but blocked the resurgence in endocytosis seen in control cells at higher sAP frequencies. Based on these findings we propose that, under physiological electrical stimulation, chromaffin cells internalise membrane via two distinct pathways that are separable. One is prevalent at <b>basal</b> stimulus <b>frequencies,</b> is lessened with increased firing, and is insensitive to cyclosporin A and FK 506.

At a <b>basal</b> stimulation <b>frequency</b> of 1 Hz, contractile parameters of the first twitch after increasing rest intervals (2 - 240 s) were evaluated. In NF (n = 9), steady state twitch tension was 13. 7 +/- 1. 8 mN/mm 2. With increasing rest intervals, post-rest twitch tension continuously increased to maximally 29. 9 +/- 4. 1 mN/mm 2 after 120 s (P < 0. 05) and to 26. 7 +/- 4. 5 mN after 240 s rest. In DCM (n = 22), basal twitch tension was 10. 0 +/- 1. 5 mN/mm 2 and increased to maximally 13. 6 +/- 2. 2 mN/mm 2 after 20 s rest (P < 0. 05). With longer rest intervals, however, post-rest twitch tension continuously declined (rest decay) to 4. 7 +/- 1. 0 mN/mm 2 at 240 s (P < 0. 05). The rest-dependent changes in twitch tension were associated with parallel changes in intracellular Ca 2 - transients in NF and DCM (aequorin method).

LF fell between ages 6 and 10 years in boys (from 234 to 203 Hz) and girls (from 230 to 218 Hz), and a sex difference appeared.

We {{recently}} {{demonstrated that}} agrin, a protein first identified at the vertebrate neuromuscular junction, binds to and regulates {{the activity of}} alpha 3 subunit-containing isoforms of the Na,K-ATPase in the mammalian brain. Both agrin and the alpha 3 Na,K-ATPase are expressed in heart, but their potential for interaction and effect on cardiac myocyte function was unknown. Here we show that agrin binds to the alpha 3 subunit of the Na,K-ATPase in cardiac myocyte membranes, inducing tyrosine phosphorylation and inhibiting activity of the pump. Agrin also triggers a rapid increase in cytoplasmic Na(+) in cardiac myocytes, suggesting a role in cardiac myocyte function. Consistent with this hypothesis, spontaneous contraction frequencies of cultured cardiac myocytes prepared from mice in which agrin expression is blocked by mutation of the Agrn gene are significantly {{higher than in the}} wild type.

40|$|Activation of {{ventral tegmental area}} (VTA) -dopaminergic (DA) neurons by ethanol {{has been}} implicated in the {{rewarding}} and reinforcing actions of ethanol. GABAergic transmission is thought {{to play an important}} role in regulating the activity of DA neurons. We have reported previously that ethanol enhances GABA release onto VTA-DA neurons in a brain slice preparation. Because intraterminal Ca 2 + levels regulate neurotransmitter release, we investigated the roles of Ca 2 +-dependent mechanisms in ethanol-induced enhancement of GABA release. Acute ethanol enhanced miniature inhibitory postsynaptic current (mIPSC) frequency in the presence of the nonspecific voltage-gated Ca 2 + channel inhibitor, cadmium chloride, even though <b>basal</b> mIPSC <b>frequency</b> was reduced by cadmium. Conversely, the inositol- 1, 4, 5 -triphosphate receptor inhibitor, 2 -aminoethoxydiphenylborane, and the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 + ATPase pump inhibitor, cyclopiazonic acid, eliminated the ethanol enhancement of mIPSC frequency. Recent studies suggest that the G protein-coupled receptor, 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) 2 C, may modulate GABA release in the VTA. Thus, we also investigated the role of 5 -HT 2 C receptors in ethanol enhancement of GABAergic transmission. Application of 5 -HT and the 5 -HT 2 C receptor agonist, Ro- 60 - 0175 [(αS) - 6 -chloro- 5 -fluoro-α-methyl- 1 H-indole- 1 -ethanamine fumarate], alone enhanced mIPSC frequency of which the latter was abolished by the 5 -HT 2 C receptor antagonist, SB 200646 [N-(1 -methyl- 5 -indoyl) -N-(3 -pyridyl) urea hydrochloride], and substantially diminished by cyclopiazonic acid. Furthermore, SB 200646 abolished the ethanol-induced increase in mIPSC frequency and had no effect on <b>basal</b> mIPSC <b>frequency.</b> These observations suggest that an increase in Ca 2 + release from intracellular stores via 5 -HT 2 C receptor activation is involved in the ethanol-induced enhancement of GABA release onto VTA-DA neurons...|$|R

That there is a <b>basal</b> <b>frequency</b> of cell death in such populations may reflect that it is either impossible to avoid all lethal events, or alternatively, that it is too costly.

Intriguingly, these two genes both affect the levels of different sigma factors within the cell. The rssB mutant displays enhanced resistance to multiple external stresses, possibly indicating that the cell gains its increased vitality through elevated resistance to spontaneous, endogenous stresses. The loss of fliA does not result in elevated stress resistance; rather, its survival is apparently due to a decreased physical stress linked to the insertion of the flagellum through the membrane and energy saved through the loss of the motor proteins. The identification of these two mutants implies that reducing mortality is not impossible; rather, due to its cost, it is subject to trade-offs with other traits that contribute to the competitive success of the organism...|$|E

Curiously, this variant A 372 V is also resistant to amiloride. We hypothesize that amiloride has a previously undescribed mutagenic activity. Indeed, amiloride compounds increase the mutation frequencies of CVB 3 and poliovirus and high fidelity variants of both viruses are {{more resistant to}} this effect. We hypothesize that this mutagenic activity is mediated through alterations in intracellular ions such as Mg 2 + and Mn 2 +, which in turn increase virus mutation frequency by affecting RdRp fidelity. Furthermore, we show that another amiloride-resistant RdRp variant, S 299 T, is completely resistant to this mutagenic activity and unaffected by changes in ion concentrations. We show that RdRp variants resist the mutagenic activity of amiloride via two different mechanisms: 1) increased fidelity that generates virus populations presenting lower <b>basal</b> mutation <b>frequencies</b> or 2) resisting changes in divalent cation concentrations tha...|$|R
40|$|In zebrafish, the {{ventilatory}} {{response to}} hypoxia first develops at 3 days post-fertilization (d. p. f.) before O 2 -chemoreceptive neuroepithelial cells (NECs) of the gill appear at 7 d. p. f. This indicates {{the presence of}} extrabranchial chemoreceptors in embryos and a developmental transition to primarily gill O 2 sensing. This thesis examined the skin NECs, which reach peak density in embryos but decline as gill NECs appear. Exposure of embryos and larvae to chronic hypoxia prevented the loss of skin NECs, shifted peak basal ventilation to a later developmental stage, and induced a hypoventilatory response to acute hypoxia. Chronic exposure to hyperoxia rapidly diminished skin NECs, shifted peak ventilation to earlier stages and eliminated the response to acute hypoxia. Administration of the neurotoxin 6 -hydroxydopamine degraded nerve terminals that contact skin NECs and reduced both <b>basal</b> ventilation <b>frequency</b> and the hypoxic ventilatory response. Thus, skin NECs are candidates for extrabranchial O 2 chemoreceptors in developing zebrafish...|$|R

40|$|The role of {{nitric oxide}} (NO) in heart failure (HF) {{is complex and}} remains controversial. We tested the {{hypothesis}} that the role of NO in isolated atria and cardiomyocytes is altered in isoproterenol-induced HF. Rats received isoproterenol (ISO, 5 mg/kg/day, intraperitoneally) or vehicle for 1 week. Haemodynamic parameters were obtained by left ventricular catheterization. Effects of NOS inhibition on isolated atria and on electrically paced left ventricular myocytes were determined. Additionally, expressions of nitric oxide synthases and their allosteric modulators hsp 90, caveolin- 1, and caveolin- 3 proteins in the left ventricles were measured. ISO increased left ventricular mass by 33 % and decreased indices of left ventricular systolic and diastolic function dp/dtmin and dp/dtmax (both P < 0. 05). Isolated atria from HF rats had a lower spontaneous beating rate (P < 0. 05). NOS inhibition by L-NAME increased <b>basal</b> <b>frequency</b> and attenuated the positive chronotropic effect of beta-adrenergic stimulation in the HF group (P < 0. 05). Ventricular myocytes from failing hearts had impaired cell shortening. L-NAME decreased contractility of control, but not failing myocytes. Left ventricular expressions of eNOS, hsp 90, iNOS, but not nNOS or caveolins, were increased. Despite the increased capacity for NO synthesis in isoproterenol-induced HF, NO does not sustain contractility of failing myocytes. NO may contribute to the decreased basal heart rate and it may accelerate beta-adrenergic stimulation of chronotrop...|$|E
40|$|Increased {{sympathetic}} outflow {{plays an}} important role in the pathogenesis of hypertension. Glutamatergic inputs in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus maintain resting sympathetic vasomotor tone in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). In this study, we determined the synaptic and cellular mechanisms of increased glutamatergic inputs to PVN presympathetic neurons in SHR. The spinally projecting PVN neurons were retrogradely labelled by fluorescent microspheres injected into the intermediolateral cell column of the spinal cord. Blockade of NMDA and non-NMDA receptors significantly decreased the firing activity of labelled PVN neurons in brain slices in SHR, but not in normotensive Wistar–Kyoto rats (WKY). The <b>basal</b> <b>frequency</b> of glutamatergic spontaneous and miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs and mEPSCs, respectively) of labelled PVN neurons was significantly greater in SHR than in WKY. But the frequency of neither sEPSCs nor mEPSCs stimulated by 4 -aminopyridine or capsaicin differed significantly between WKY and SHR. Furthermore, the amplitude of postsynaptic NMDA currents elicited by either electrical stimulation or puff application in labelled PVN neurons was significantly higher in SHRs than in WKY. However, the evoked AMPA current amplitude in PVN neurons was similar in WKY and SHR. This study provides new evidence of how the glutamatergic synaptic inputs to PVN presympathetic neurons are increased and how they contribute to the elevated firing activity of these neurons in SHR. The augmented glutamatergic tone in the PVN is maintained by an increase in presynaptic glutamate release and an up-regulation of postsynaptic NMDA receptor function in SHR...|$|E
40|$|Haematophagous insects can ingest large {{quantities}} of blood in a single meal and eliminate high volumes of urine {{in the next few}} hours. This rise in diuresis is possible because the excretory activity of the Malpighian tubules is facilitated by an increase in haemolymph circulation as a result of intensification of aorta contractions combined with an increase of the anterior midgut peristaltic waves. It has been previously described that haemolymph circulation during post-prandial diuresis is stimulated by the synergistic activity of allatotropin (AT) and serotonin in the kissing bug Triatoma infestans; resulting in an increase in aorta contractions. In the same species, AT stimulates anterior midgut and rectum muscle contractions to mix urine and feces and facilitate the voiding of the rectum. Furthermore, levels of AT in midgut and Malpighian tubules increased in the afternoon when insects are getting ready for nocturnal feeding. In the present study we describe the synergistic effect of AT and serotonin increasing the frequency of contractions of the aorta in Rhodnius prolixus. The <b>basal</b> <b>frequency</b> of contractions of the aorta in the afternoon is higher that the observed during the morning, suggesting the existence of a daily rhythmic activity. The AT receptor is expressed in the rectum, midgut and dorsal vessel, three critical organs involved in post-prandial diuresis. All together these findings provide evidence that AT plays a role as a myoregulatory and cardioacceleratory peptide in R. prolixus...|$|E

40|$|Laser {{scanning}} cytometry (LSC) {{can be used}} {{to quantify}} the fluorescence intensity or laser light loss (absorbance) of localized modular targets within nuclear and cytoplasmic structures of cells while maintaining the morphological features of the examined tissue. It was aimed to develop as automated LSC protocol to study cellular and nuclear anomalies and DNA damage events in human buccal mucosal cells.

30|$|The {{drawback}} of {{the method}} is poorer parameter identifiability. The response variables of the models are not utilized in modelling, and the parameters of all models are estimated simultaneously. This may lead for instance to models that overestimate diameter growth, which is compensated for by underestimated survival rate. However, including both <b>basal</b> area and <b>frequency</b> distributions in the objective function decreases the likelihood {{of this kind of}} mutual cancellation of model errors. The problem may have been more serious if ingrowth model was estimated simultaneously with survival and diameter increment model. In this case, overestimated ingrowth may be compensated for by overestimated mortality among the smallest diameter classes.|$|R
