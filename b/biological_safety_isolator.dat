50|$|The American <b>Biological</b> <b>Safety</b> Association (ABSA) {{was founded}} in 1984 to promote {{biosafety}} as a scientific discipline and to serve the growing needs of biosafety professionals throughout the world. Biosafety concerns the safe handling of biological materials, particularly infectious agents that cause risk to humans working with them.Although ABSA was officially founded in 1984, almost 30 years earlier, on April 18, 1955, 14 representatives from Camp Detrick, Maryland; Pine Bluff Arsenal, Arkansas; and Dugway Proving Grounds, Utah met at Camp Detrick in Frederick, Maryland. The purpose of the meeting was to share knowledge and experiences regarding chemical, biological, radiological, and industrial safety issues that were common to the operations at the three principal biological warfare laboratories of the United States Army: the Biological Research Laboratories at Camp Detrick, the Biological Production and Development Laboratories at Pine Bluff Arsenal, and the Biological Assessment Laboratories at Dugway Proving Grounds. This meeting was the first <b>biological</b> <b>safety</b> conference. Due {{to the nature of}} the work conducted at the biological warfare laboratories, papers presented at the conference had to be cleared in advance by security officers and attendance was restricted to persons with top secret security clearances.Beginning in 1957, the <b>biological</b> <b>safety</b> conferences were planned to include non-classified sessions to enable broader sharing of <b>biological</b> <b>safety</b> information with personnel not associated with the United States Army biological warfare programs. But it was not until 1964 that the conference was held at a government installation not associated with the biological warfare program; the National Animal Disease Laboratory, in Ames, Iowa. Over the first 10 years, the <b>biological</b> <b>safety</b> conferences grew to include representatives from all federal agencies that sponsored and/or conducted research with pathogenic microorganisms, and by 1966 included representatives from universities, private laboratories, hospitals, industrial complexes, and 17 government installations.Throughout the 1970s, participation in the conferences continued to grow, and by 1983, discussions began regarding the creation of a formal organization. The American <b>Biological</b> <b>Safety</b> Association was officially established and a constitution and bylaws were written in 1984; however, the constitution was not ratified by members until 1987.As of 2008, ABSA membership includes over 1,600 professionals from across the nation, and over 20 countries, including Brazil, Canada, and Japan. Its goals are to provide a professional association that represents the interests and needs of practitioners of <b>biological</b> <b>safety,</b> and to provide a forum for the continued and timely exchange of biosafety information. In addition to conducting annual <b>biological</b> <b>safety</b> conferences to keep members informed of current biosafety issues and regulatory initiatives, and offering registration and certification, ABSA publishes and distributes a quarterly journal, Applied Biosafety, and conducts a selection of biosafety courses geared at the beginner and advanced levels. In addition, ABSA produces an annual membership directory to stimulate networking. ABSA is committed to its members in four broad areas: developing and maintaining professional standards for the field of biological safety; advancing <b>biological</b> <b>safety</b> as a scientific discipline through education and research; providing members sustained opportunities for biosafety communication, education, and participation in the development of <b>biological</b> <b>safety</b> standards, guidelines and regulations; and expanding biosafety awareness and promoting the development of work practices, equipment, and facilities to reduce the potential for occupational illness and adverse environmental impact from infectious agents or biologically derived materials.|$|R

40|$|Overall {{contamination}} (on- plus off-streak) of the Isolator (Du Pont Co.) {{blood culture}} tube (23 %) {{was greater than}} that of a conventional broth blood culture bottle (0. 6 %) or that of a biphasic blood culture bottle (1. 3 %). To determine the source of this contamination, Isolator cultures of blood from 59 healthy volunteers and of sterile broth from 60 vials were made. A total of 37 % of the blood cultures and 22 % of the broth cultures were contaminated (P = 0. 06). Staphylococcus epidermidis-contaminated cultures represented 31 and 10 % of the blood and broth cultures, respectively (P = 0. 06). Contamination of plates processed on a bench top, in front of horizontal laminar flow, and in a <b>biological</b> <b>safety</b> cabinet with vertical laminar flow were compared. Processing plates in a <b>biological</b> <b>safety</b> cabinet resulted in a significant {{reduction in the number of}} contaminated plates (P less than 0. 05). The contamination rate for 7, 874 Isolator blood cultures processed in the <b>biological</b> <b>safety</b> cabinet was significantly decreased to 6. 7 % on-streak (9. 3 % on- plus off-streak). Contamination of Isolator-processed blood cultures originated from the laboratory and the patient. The former can be reduced by inoculating plates in a vertical laminar flow <b>biological</b> <b>safety</b> cabinet and by maintaining adequate quality control of media. The latter may be unavoidable...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} integratedly {{evaluate}} the <b>biological</b> <b>safety</b> as a water quality index, an assessment method based on three toxicity tests (algae growth inhibition, daphnia immobilization and larval fish toxicity) was developed. In this study, the developed method {{was used to}} screen, evaluate and rank the <b>biological</b> <b>safety</b> of small rivers near agricultural, industrial and residential areas. Twenty-seven representative water samples were collected from the Kaname River watershed and the Hinata River watershed in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. The results indicated that (1) the <b>biological</b> <b>safety</b> {{of water from the}} Hinata River ranked much higher than those from the Suzu River and the Shibuta River due to less human activities, (2) the <b>biological</b> <b>safety</b> from outlets of paddy fields ranked much worse than those from point source discharges of toxic pollutants, (3) the use of pesticides significantly affected the water quality of nearby small rivers and ditches during the pesticide application season, (4) the effects of different kinds of pesticides could successfully be classified using one toxicity test component of the bioassay battery, and (5) there was no significant quantitative relationship between the toxicity and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) for the studied water samples. The toxicities of water samples in this study were in agreement with the concentrations of pesticides determined with chemical methods by other researchers, which demonstrated that the developed assessment method was reliable to screen site contaminated with organic chemicals for priority management.

40|$|Latex {{products}} {{have long been}} recognized {{as a cause of}} latex protein allergy. The increased usage of latex gloves, with the consequent increased occurrence of latex allergies appears to have escalated with increasing awareness of the transmission of HIV–AIDS and other infections. The use of condoms as a means to prevent the transmission of STD's (sexually transmitted diseases) and HIV–AIDS has been widely promoted. Although extensive testing is done to evaluate the physical quality of condoms, no information is available regarding the <b>biological</b> <b>safety</b> of condoms. This study was undertaken {{to determine the effects of}} short‐term exposure to physiological levels of condom surface material on cell viability (MTT assay) and cell growth (crystal violet assay). A direct contact cell culture testing method (FDA test method F 813 ‐ 83 used to evaluate the cytotoxic potential of medical materials and devices) was used. The modified test method was found to be a sensitive test system for the evaluation of the <b>biological</b> <b>safety</b> of condoms. This study reveals the importance of evaluating the <b>biological</b> <b>safety</b> of all condoms that are commercially available, because of the potential health risk that may be associated with prolonged use of certain types of condoms...|$|R

40|$|Because {{the origins}} of the <b>biological</b> <b>safety</b> {{profession}} are rooted in the control and prevention of laboratory associated infections, the vocation focuses its efforts primarily on the safe handling of specimens within the laboratory. But in many cases the specimens and samples handled in the lab are originally collected in the field, where a broader set of possible exposure considerations may be present, each with varying degrees of controllability. The failure to adequately control the risks associated with the field collection of biological specimens may result in potential illness or injury, and could have a direct impact on laboratory safety if, for example, infectious specimens were packaged or transported inappropriately. This study involved the development of a web-based survey distributed to practicing <b>biological</b> <b>safety</b> professionals to determine the prevalence and extent to which <b>biological</b> <b>safety</b> programs consider and evaluate field collection activities. In cases where such issues were considered, the associated data collected were used to characterize the types of controls and methods of oversight at the institutional level that are being employed. Sixty-one percent (61 %) of the survey respondents indicated that research involving the field collection of biological specimens is conducted at their institution of employment. A statistically significant majority (79 %) of these field collection activities occur at academic institutions. Seventy-three percent (73 %) of respondents indicated they have assigned an institutional oversight committee (either an Institutional Biosafety Committee, <b>Biological</b> <b>Safety</b> Committee, or in one case, a Field Research Safety Committee) to review such protocols, but only 25 % have generated a field research-specific risk assessment form to facilitate the assembly of pertinent information necessary for a project risk assessment review. The results also indicated that most biosafety professionals (73 % overall; 71 % from institutions conducting field collection activities) have not been formally trained on the topic, but many (64 % overall; 87 % from institutions conducting field collection activities) indicated that training on field research safety issues would be helpful and even more (71 % overall; 93 % from institutions conducting field collection activities) would consider participation in such a training course. These results obtained from this study can be used {{as the basis for the}} development of field research safety toolkit and associated training curricula specifically targeted for <b>biological</b> <b>safety</b> professionals. ...|$|R
