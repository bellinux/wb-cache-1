5|$|<b>Black</b> <b>Beauty</b> {{was first}} {{released}} only in Japan by CBS/Sony in 1973 without individual songs {{specified in the}} track listing. Columbia Records, Davis' American record label, had difficulty identifying the compositions for royalty purposes, and the album was not released in the United States until 1997. Critics were generally positive toward <b>Black</b> <b>Beauty,</b> although some were critical of its sound quality and Grossman's solos; Corea said the recording was an accurate document how that particular band of Davis' played live.|$|E

5|$|<b>Black</b> <b>Beauty</b> was {{recorded}} on April 10, 1970, at the Fillmore West in San Francisco, when Davis performed as the opening act for the Grateful Dead. It was also {{soon after his}} studio album Bitches Brew had been released to stores, and he played some songs from the album while leading an ensemble that featured soprano saxophonist Steve Grossman, bassist Dave Holland, keyboardist Chick Corea, drummer Jack DeJohnette, and percussionist Airto Moreira. After the departure of saxophonist Wayne Shorter from the group earlier that year, Grossman was enlisted by Davis {{to participate in an}} April 7 recording session for his next album Jack Johnson (1971) before joining the live band.|$|E

5|$|Many {{film and}} {{television}} horses of the Golden Age of Hollywood were also Saddlebreds, including the horses used in lead roles in My Friend Flicka, National Velvet, Fury and one version of <b>Black</b> <b>Beauty.</b> A half-Saddlebred played the lead role in the TV series Mr. Ed, and a Saddlebred was used in {{a prominent role in}} Giant. In the 1990s, William Shatner, an actor and Saddlebred breeder, rode one of his own horses, a mare named Great Belles of Fire, in his role as James T. Kirk in Star Trek Generations. Numerous other celebrities have been owners and exhibitors of the breed, including William Shatner, Clark Gable, Will Rogers, Joe Louis, and Carson Kressley.|$|E
5|$|The {{tendency}} to portray animals as having human traits was not new; Aesop's moralistic animal tales were still popular with {{readers of the}} day, and inspired such works as Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book (1894). However, one of the features separating the turn-of-the-century animal writers from those before them was the desire to have their animals set an example through their noble, sympathetic characteristics. Anna Sewell's <b>Black</b> <b>Beauty,</b> for example, {{told the story of}} a gentle horse seemingly from the animal's own point of view; after being published in the United States by the American Humane Education Society in 1890, Sewell's book helped further the cause against animal cruelty. The budding animal welfare movement helped establish a climate for wider public support of wildlife conservation, and soon nature writers similarly sought to gain sympathy for wild animals—specifically those who seemingly displayed honorable human traits—by depicting them in a positive light. One popular nature writer of the day, Mabel Osgood Wright, told of wolves nobly taking their own lives after losing their mates.|$|E

He {{did not want the}} actual segments specified on the track listing out of a distaste for critics and listeners who arduously analyzed his music; according to DeJohnette's wife Lydia, [...] "Miles really felt that critics and people spent too much time in their mental mind, analyzing and talking for hours about something that really just is." [...] Columbia spent several years identifying some of the individual compositions to ensure royalty payment for the actual composers.
