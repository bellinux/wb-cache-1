50|$|The bike {{was fitted}} with an 'anti-squat' rear <b>brake</b> <b>linkage</b> that linked the rear caliper {{to the frame}} via a rose-jointed linkage through the {{swingarm}} (reducing rear suspension displacement under braking).|$|R
25|$|The first {{motorcycles}} to use {{disc brakes}} were racing vehicles. MV Agusta {{was the first}} to offer a front disc brake motorcycle to the public on a small scale in 1965, on their relatively expensive 600 touring motorcycle, using a mechanical <b>brake</b> <b>linkage.</b> In 1969 Honda introduced the more affordable CB750, which had a single hydraulically-actuated front disc brake (and a rear drum brake), and which sold in huge numbers. Disc brakes are now common on motorcycles, mopeds and even mountain bikes.|$|R
2500|$|The {{standard}} {{brakes on}} the RS 6 are cross-drilled, radially vented and floating iron discs. At the front they are [...] diameter and [...] thick, clamped by gloss black six-piston fixed Brembo monoblock alloy calipers incorporating the [...] "RS" [...] logo, {{and at the}} rear they are [...] diameter and [...] with black single-piston floating calipers and an integrated electro-mechanical parking <b>brake</b> <b>linkage.</b> The parking <b>brake</b> serves doubles as a full emergency brake whilst the car is in motion, by applying maximum braking effort to all four wheels, resulting in activating the Anti-lock Braking System (ABS).|$|R
50|$|Although the FC {{series was}} {{substantially}} {{the same as}} the FE, it featured revisions to the radiator grille, body trim and interior. Minor mechanical improvements were also made, with changes to the engine, suspension, <b>brakes,</b> gearchange <b>linkages</b> and the steering box. The Utility now featured painted rather than chromed grille and headlight rims, as did the Panel Van.|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} the {{investigation}} is composite materials TiC - Me with a high content of copper (which are obtained by using a method of self-propagation high-temperature synthesis), and steels of austenite and ferrite grades in various structural states. The purpose is studying the structure, physical, mechanical and tribologic properties, {{the development of a}} physical approach permitting to analyse the nature of forming surface friction layers. Mechanical, tribotechnical characteristics and thermal conductivity have been measured. A concept of formation of the surface friction layers as a result of multiple thermal impact and mechanical effects has been suggested. The interrelation between the conditions of external friction, the composition and the structure of composite materials and steels has been studied. The wear resistance of boride coatings in high-loaded friction pairs has been investigated. The process of and specifications for production of the bushings of the articulated joint of the <b>braking</b> <b>linkage</b> of railway cars have been developed.

50|$|In {{comparison}} with the mass-produced gondola car of model 12-9046, a new model has an all-metal welded body volume which is increased by 2 cubic meters to 87 cubic meters. The cover of the side and the end walls is made of smooth sheet instead of the curved profile. On the end wall two zones and five efforts of the P-shaped cross section are set, which ensure high rigidity for the perception of stress in the collisions. Tare weight of the gondola car is reduced per ton. Bearing metal frame, body, parts of the <b>brake</b> <b>linkage,</b> cover of the body, the hatch covers are made of low-alloyed steel according to GOST 19281-89 14 category, the strength class of which {{is not less than}} 390. Centre girder is equipped with more technologically advanced and reliable in operation welded lugs. The running gear of the gondola car consists of 2 two-axle bogies of model 18-7020, which are equipped with elastic-rolling runner skids of a new system. In order to improve traffic safety the gondola is equipped with a new system of separate braking carts. Overhaul of the new gondola is increased to 32 years, whereas mileage of nowadays produced analogues is 22 years.|$|R
50|$|Brake {{shoes are}} {{typically}} made of {{two pieces of}} steel welded together. The friction material is either riveted to the lining table or attached with adhesive. The crescent-shaped piece is called the Web and contains holes and slots in different shapes for return springs, hold-down hardware, parking <b>brake</b> <b>linkage</b> and self-adjusting components. All the application force of the wheel cylinder is applied through the web to the lining table and brake lining. The edge of the lining table generally has three “V"-shaped notches or tabs on each side called nibs. The nibs rest against the support pads of the backing plate to which the shoes are installed.Each brake assembly has two shoes, a primary and secondary. The primary shoe is located {{toward the front of}} the vehicle and has the lining positioned differently from the secondary shoe. Quite often, the two shoes are interchangeable, so close inspection for any variation is important. Linings must be resistant to heat and wear and have a high friction coefficient unaffected by fluctuations in temperature and humidity.Materials that make up the brake shoe include, friction modifiers (which can include graphite and cashew nut shells), powdered metal such as lead, zinc, brass, aluminium and other metals that resist heat fade, binders, curing agents and fillers such as rubber chips to reduce brake noise.|$|R
40|$|Radiographic (RT) and {{ultrasonic}} (UT) methods {{usually are}} used for flaw detection in railway rolling stock casting components. At the same time both methods have some serious disadvantages. RT method is expensive, creates unhealthy radioactive emanation and is low productive for testing components with the different thickness due long time for RT apparatus retuning. UT method is not efficient for testing surfaces with different curvature, low sensitive to surface flaws and need very good surface for good acoustical contact with transducer [1, 2]. The goal {{of this paper is}} to show the eddy current (EC) method possibility to detect surface breaking flaws in casting components with rough surface. Long time EC method was supposed to be not applicable for such product inspection due high noise from the surface inhomogeneities. Another problem is low frequency signal trend during EC probe scanning due the magnetic property changes. To reduce the surface inhomogeneities influence multiplexed array EC probes are proposed [3]. But these probes are very difficult and can’t be used with conventional EC device. In Russia and Ukraine EC inspection of railway rolling stock casting components is stipulated by the regulatory documents [4, 5]. According to these documents the next components are tested:- wheel pair and tug unit;- bogies of freight, refrigerator and passenger cars;- <b>brake</b> <b>linkage</b> units;- automatic couplers...|$|R
50|$|Their {{construction}} was a wooden plank, around two feet long. It rode {{on a single}} double-flanged wheel, with a V-shaped iron slipper on {{the rear of the}} plank. It was balanced by an iron outrigger to one side, with a pipe-shaped roller over its end. This wide roller also allowed for slight variations in gauge. To control the car there was a hand brake. Pulling upwards on this applied an iron brake to the tread of the wheel. Despite the simplicity of the idea, the cars were not unsophisticated in their manufacture. Most was made by the smith, but the cast wheel was made by a foundry in Portmadoc. The <b>brake</b> <b>linkage</b> comprised several pieces, each hand-forged. The brake handle was detachable and fitted over the main lever. It was decoratively forged with a lightweight curve. When not in use it was carried in the quarryman's pocket, a primitive form of anti-theft measure. This could have tragic consequences; one of the few fatal accidents was to children in the 1920s who crashed into a slate wagon through not having the brake handle. For reasons of safety, later operation of the cars became more organised, a responsible mine foreman leading the descent as 'captain', and setting a maximum speed. At times cavalcades of up to two hundred cars would descend in close procession.|$|R
50|$|The Learjet 25 utilize {{wheel brakes}} {{as the primary}} method for {{reducing}} speed after landing. The brake system utilizes hydraulic pressure for power boost. The brake valves are controlled via the rudder pedal toe <b>brakes</b> through mechanical <b>linkages.</b> Two shuttle valves in the pressure lines prevent fluid feedback between the pilot's and copilot's pedals. Four additional shuttle valves connect the pneumatic system to the brake system for emergency braking. An integral anti-skid system in installed to affect maximum braking efficiency. In order to minimize heat build-up in the brakes and reduce brake wear, pilots are advised to deploy the spoilers upon touchdown.|$|R
40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{model of the}} design problem of an automotive brake system is developed in this article. A description of the overall system followed by {{a detailed description of}} the individual subsystems is presented. The design model of the individual subsystems is then developed. The overall system design model that includes the different subsystem models and the models that describe the performance of the entire system is then presented. A vacuum assisted hydraulic brake system is one of the common brake systems used in cars. Shown in Fig. 1 is a typical vacuum assisted hydraulic brake system for a car. It consists of many subsystems starting from a pedal linkage using which the driver applies the <b>brakes.</b> The pedal <b>linkage</b> is connected to the input of the vacuum booster that assists the driver in applyin...|$|R
5000|$|Dean Moon, {{dry lake}} racer {{and founder of}} MOON Speed Equipment, built a Devin-bodied special called Moonbeam in {{partnership}} with NHRA president Wally Parks. The car {{was meant to be}} {{the first of a series}} of cars optimized for straight-line runs on the drag strip and the Bonneville salt flats. A box-type frame was fabricated from mild steel tubing by Harley Klentz. The chassis had a track width of 50 in and a nominal wheelbase of 100 in, but the wheelbase could be adjusted by up to 4 in. Front and rear axles were both solid, with the front being an I-beam unit from a Ford and the rear also being Ford but with a Halibrand quick-change center. Suspension was done by Monroe coil-over shock absorbers and the axles were located by trailing arms and a Watt's <b>linkage.</b> <b>Brakes</b> were Mercury-Bendix and the wheels were magnesium Halibrands. The first engine used was a [...] Chevrolet small-block V8 with a GMC 4-71 Roots-type supercharger blowing through a Potvin intake manifold and Hilborn fuel injection. When this engine did not perform as expected, it was replaced with a [...] Chevrolet.|$|R
5000|$|J [...]A. Grégoire {{designed}} an 11cv 6-cylinder car for Donnet in 1932. Only four prototypes were produced, {{one being}} {{shown at the}} Paris Salon of 1932 before Donnet went into liquidation. He then worked with Lucian Chenard to design two cars for Chenard et Walcker. They were of advanced design but were not a commercial success. In 1937 he designed the Amilcar Compound, produced by Hotchkiss from 1938 to the Second World War, by which time 681 examples had been made. It was constructed using another of Grégoire's ideas, a cast Alpax (light alloy) chassis frame. Other advanced features were {{rack and pinion steering}} and all independent suspension. But the car had its bad points, cable <b>brakes</b> and gear-change <b>linkage</b> and a side-valve engine although the latter was still common at this time. An overhead valve version came later. During the Second World War he secretly worked with his design team at his works at Asnières-sur-Seine on a small car the Aluminium [...] "Francais-Gregoire". It had a chassis-body frame of light alloy, front-wheel drive, an air-cooled flat twin engine and independent suspension on all wheels. A four-seat car weighing only 880 lb and could reach 60 mi/h km/h while returning 70 mpg. This design was to form the basis of the 1950 [...] "Dyna" [...] Panhard. In 1950 another Hotchkiss car the [...] "Hotchkiss-Gregoire", was produced again with an alloy chassis and body. With independent suspension on all four wheels and fitted with a water-cooled flat four engine of 2 litres, ahead of the front axle, it was fast, with a top speed of 94 mi/h km/h, but the car was expensive and only 250 examples were made by 1954. In 1956 Grégoire produced a two-seat convertible with a 2.2-litre supercharged flat-four engine producing [...] and, {{as in the case of}} the cars mentioned previously, front-wheel drive. All ten cars made were fitted with bodies designed and built by Henri Chapron.|$|R
