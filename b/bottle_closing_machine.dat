40|$|During bottle storage {{the barrier}} against the {{external}} atmosphere {{is provided by}} the closure. In order to evaluate the influence of capsule and storage position in preserving the quality of the wine, this research project aimed to study the chemical and sensorial evolution of a red wine stored over a period of 12 months in glass <b>bottles</b> <b>closed</b> with natural cork stoppers with or without capsule and maintained in different storage position (horizontal vs vertical). The different storage conditions adopted deeply affected wine quality suggesting that their rational optimization could allow the maintenance of red wine quality during storage. In particular, wine degradation rate was higher when the wine was stored in glass <b>bottles</b> <b>closed</b> with a natural cork without the capsule, regardless of the position of storage. On the contrary wine decay was significantly delayed when it was stored in the horizontal position, independently from the closure system used...|$|R

5000|$|Glass is a {{relatively}} heavy packing material and wine bottles use quite thick glass, so the tare weight of a full wine bottle is {{a relatively}} high proportion of its gross weight. The average weight of an empty 750 ml wine bottle is 500 g (and can range from 300 to 900 g), which makes the glass 40% of the total weight of the full bottle. This has led to suggestions that wine should be exported in bulk from producer regions and <b>bottled</b> <b>close</b> to the market. This would {{reduce the cost of}} transportation and its carbon footprint, and provide a local market for recycled green glass.|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} has been to evaluate how the caps used to <b>close</b> wine <b>bottles</b> can influence {{the composition of the}} volatile fraction during storage in the case of white wines produced in the Friuli Venezia Giulia region. For this purpose, three wines by three local producers have been analyzed.

Employed closures have been classical cork cap, co-extruded synthetic cap, moulded synthetic cap and screw cap. Subsequent analyses have been carried out at 6, 12 and 24 months after bottling. That way it was possible to compare composition both of the same wine during time and of different wines depending on type of closures utilized. Neither clearly identifiable trends nor statistically significant differences between different types of caps utilized have been observed for most volatile components; however, changes that may influence sensory characteristics have been observed for some volatile components...|$|R
