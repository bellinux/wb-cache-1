40|$|This paper {{suggests}} that disappointment with knowledge <b>management</b> <b>systems</b> reflects fundamental {{problems such as}} failure of systems analysis. It examines the range of software solutions being passed <b>off</b> as Knowledge <b>Management</b> <b>Systems</b> and argues that most are straightforward Information Management tools that were never designed {{to address the needs}} of the so-called learning organisation. It concludes that the danger of technology-driven developments is especially evident in this area, in which the theories are frequently misunderstood and the top-down approach of traditional systems design is replaced by a totalising approach to corporate intellectual capital...|$|R

50|$|<b>Boil</b> <b>off</b> rate {{is governed}} by heat leakage and by the {{quantity}} of propellant in the tanks. With partially filled tanks, the percentage loss is higher. Heat leakage depends on surface area, while the original mass of propellant in the tanks depends on volume. So by the cube-square law, the smaller the tank, the faster the liquids will boil off.Some propellant tank designs have achieved a liquid hydrogen <b>boil</b> <b>off</b> rate as low as approximately 0.13% per day (3.8% per month) while the much higher temperature cryogenic fluid of liquid oxygen would <b>boil</b> <b>off</b> much less, about 0.016% per day (0.49% per month).|$|R

50|$|A soda {{locomotive}} {{could run}} for several hours, {{but eventually the}} soda would become diluted and wouldn't produce enough heat to continue generating steam. For reconcentrating, the caustic soda was either transferred out of the boiler of the locomotive and boiled in open vats, or, rather more conveniently, by injecting superheated steam at a high enough temperature to <b>boil</b> <b>off</b> the water in solution. A stationary boiler would be hooked up and feed superheated steam through the soda to <b>boil</b> <b>off</b> the water and effectively recharge the soda.|$|R
50|$|The insulation, as {{efficient}} as it is, will not keep LNG cold enough by itself. Inevitably, heat leakage will warm and vapourise the LNG. Industry practice is to store LNG as a boiling cryogen. That is, the liquid is stored at its boiling point for the pressure at which it is stored (atmospheric pressure). As the vapour <b>boils</b> <b>off,</b> heat for the phase change cools the remaining liquid. Because the insulation is very efficient, only a relatively small amount of <b>boil</b> <b>off</b> is necessary to maintain temperature. This phenomenon is also called auto-refrigeration.|$|R
