Advocates of this motion claim that this right attracts unauthorized immigration to the U.S. The repeal of <b>birthright</b> <b>citizenship</b> would have {{the greatest impact on}} second-generation Americans who are Mexican Americans, as Mexico is the country of origin for the majority of undocumented immigrants in the U.S.|$|E

The closest US location from China is Saipan in the Northern Mariana Islands, a US dependency in the western Pacific Ocean that allows Chinese visitors without visa restrictions. The island is currently experiencing an upswing in Chinese births. This option is used by relatively affluent Chinese who often have secondary motives as well, wishing their children {{to be able to}} leave mainland China when they grow older or bring their parents to the US. Canada is less achievable as their government denies many visa requests.|$|E

500|$|Historian Eric Foner, who has {{explored}} {{the question of}} U.S. <b>birthright</b> <b>citizenship</b> to other countries, argues that: ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the words}} of Lucy Salyer, [...] "the <b>birthright</b> <b>citizenship</b> {{doctrine}} of Wong Kim Ark has remained intact for over a century, still perceived by most to be a natural and well-established rule in accordance with American principles and practice. [...] It {{is unlikely to be}} uprooted easily." ...|$|E
500|$|Current U.S. law on <b>birthright</b> <b>citizenship</b> (citizenship {{acquired}} at birth) acknowledges both citizenship through {{place of}} birth (jus soli) and citizenship inherited from parents (jus sanguinis). [...] Before Wong Kim Ark, the Supreme Court had held in Elk v. Wilkins (1884) that birthplace by itself was not sufficient to grant citizenship to a Native American; however, Congress eventually granted full citizenship to American Indians via the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924.|$|E
50|$|This {{perception}} of dual loyalty can apply {{even when the}} job in question does not require security clearance. In the United States, dual citizenship is common among politicians or government employees. For example, Arnold Schwarzenegger retained his Austrian citizenship during his service as a Governor of California while US Senator Ted Cruz renounced his Canadian <b>citizenship</b> <b>birthright</b> on May 14, 2014.|$|R
30|$|The EU {{is not a}} {{replacement}} unit for a functioning multicultural society; {{it is hard to}} call it a democracy. But it is more plausible to suggest that what has been democratic about it was that it did create a genuine type of politically amenable post-national governance. It had many failings, and it was a pallid version of the nostalgic national democracy that most Europeans felt was still their <b>birthright.</b> European <b>citizenship</b> was in all kinds of ways derivative on the national citizenships that gave members of member-states their European membership privileges. It was indeed partly parasitical on the multicultural nation-state; not so much a normative paragon, then, as a functional necessity responding to the super-diversity and “neo-liberal” mobilities of our less bordered way of living in nations today. I wholeheartedly acknowledge these imperfections. But normatively, though, it has shown that our ideas of solidarity, as with our ideas of democracy and governance, of rights and sovereignty, all need updating for a world beyond the nationalist multicultural state. These resources can and do still lie in liberalism as a political ethos. The setbacks of a re-nationalising world should not deter our normative intuition that there must still be other possibilities than, simply, nostalgic roll-back. Maybe then {{we will be able to}} talk again of being liberals, of liberalism, and (even) of liberal democracy, without the slur of “neo-” affixed.|$|R
30|$|Turkish {{citizenship}} {{is defined in}} the Article 66 of the constitution by the statement that ‘Everybody linked to the Turkish state with a citizenship bond is Turk’, also codifying the <b>birthright</b> acquisition of <b>citizenship</b> through that of parents. Provisions of the Citizenship Law refers to jus soli only under special circumstances, {{and there is no}} restriction on jus sanguinis transmission abroad. With a strong genealogical component, the ethno-cultural conception of Turkish citizenship seems at odds with the republican premises of the constitution (Kasaba, 1997; Kirisci, 2000). Turkish citizenship can thus be understood in terms of its monolithic character assuming a unique identity, constituted on republican but state-centric premises, and culturally embedded in the national identity (Içduygu, Çolak, & Soyarik, 1999; Soyarik-Sentürk, 2005). While these aspects mark a continuity in the citizenship regime, major changes have resulted from this official understanding of national identity and the emerging need to address the new conditions created by emigration (Kadirbeyoglu, 2007, 2009). Therefore, the acceptance of dual {{citizenship is}} completely compatible with the general character of Turkish citizenship; given the ethno-cultural conception, a re-ethnicisation was not necessary since retaining this conception was sufficient.|$|R
500|$|In 2010 and 2011, {{state legislators}} in Arizona {{introduced}} bills proposing to deny regular birth certificates to children born in Arizona whose parents could not prove {{they were in}} the United States legally. [...] Supporters of such legislation reportedly hoped their efforts would cause the issue of <b>birthright</b> <b>citizenship</b> for U.S.-born children of illegal aliens to reach the Supreme Court, possibly resulting in a new decision narrowing or overruling Wong Kim Ark.|$|E
500|$|In {{the words}} of a 2007 legal {{analysis}} of events following the Wong Kim Ark decision, [...] "The parameters of the jus soli principle, as stated by the court in Wong Kim Ark, have never been seriously questioned by the Supreme Court, and have been accepted as dogma by lower courts." [...] A 2010 review {{of the history of the}} Citizenship Clause notes that the Wong Kim Ark decision held that the guarantee of <b>birthright</b> <b>citizenship</b> [...] "applies to children of foreigners present on American soil" [...] and states that the Supreme Court [...] "has not re-examined this issue since the concept of 'illegal alien' entered the language". [...] Since the 1990s, however, controversy has arisen over the longstanding practice of granting automatic citizenship to U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants, and legal scholars disagree over whether the Wong Kim Ark precedent applies when alien parents are in the country illegally. Attempts have been made from time to time in Congress to restrict <b>birthright</b> <b>citizenship,</b> either via statutory redefinition of the term jurisdiction, or by overriding both the Wong Kim Ark ruling and the Citizenship Clause itself through an amendment to the Constitution, but no such proposal has been enacted.|$|E
500|$|According to Salyer, the San Francisco {{attorney}} George Collins {{had tried}} to persuade the federal Justice Department to bring a Chinese <b>birthright</b> <b>citizenship</b> case before the Supreme Court. [...] An article by Collins {{was published in the}} May/June 1895 American Law Review, criticizing the Look Tin Sing ruling and the federal government's unwillingness to challenge it, and advocating the international law view of jus sanguinis citizenship. [...] Eventually, Collins was able to convince U.S. Attorney Henry Foote, who [...] "searched for a viable test case and settled on Wong Kim Ark".|$|E
40|$|This article {{interrupts}} {{the linear}} narrative that posits the conferment of citizenship (legal naturalisation) as the ‘natural’ outcome of citizenisation. Where the scholarship on citizenship and migration privileges the institutional life of citizenisation – where naturalisation {{appears as a}} discrete event {{at the end of}} the ‘citizenisation’ continuum – the social life of citizenisation includes naturalisation as an ontological process but is not reducible to it. ‘Ontological process’ refers to the ways in which different categories or locales of existence (the self, society, culture, the state, the nation, histories, geographies) are combined to produce understandings of what citizenship ‘really is’. Drawing on critical policy studies, ‘the social life’ of citizenisation and naturalisation rejects a conception of policy as a coercive instrument of the state or as a fixed document. I then turn to feminist science and technology scholars Annemarie Mol’s (2002) ‘ontological politics’ and Charis Thompson’s (2005) ‘ontological choreographies’ as useful frameworks to work with for tracing ontological processes within practices of citizenisation and naturalisation. To illustrate, the article builds on the widely used opposition between ascribed (<b>birthright)</b> and chosen <b>citizenship</b> (naturalisation) to show how the distinction falls apart when we understand naturalisation as part of the normalisation of such assumptions and their effects on global inequalities. The analysis demonstrates how the proposed analytical framework puts into relief joint processes of ontologising, normalising, subjectification, and stratification. Understanding how citizenisation and naturalisation function in tandem institutionally and socially is important if we are to gain a fuller grasp of how old and new forms of inequalities are refigured in twenty-first century citizenship...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the DREAM Act and current United States citizenship laws from a normative perspective. I {{argue that there}} are certain moral claims to citizenship that a non-citizen may hold and that citizenship status is not constituted by legal status alone. Furthermore, liberal democratic states should provide a pathway to citizenship that accounts for these certain moral claims. The principles of jus sanguinis, citizenship through bloodline, and jus soli, citizenship though birth within the territory of a state, have dictated citizenship laws thus far. These principles are problematic from a moral standpoint and scholars have largely failed to criticize the moral arbitrariness of this system of ?<b>birthright</b> entitlements? to <b>citizenship.</b> United States citizenship laws, based on the principle of jus soli, fail to recognize people who should be considered U. S. citizens based on their long-term residence and membership within the political community. The law does not account for one?s relationship with the political community and other members of that community and thus fails to identify who should be considered a citizen of the state. Rather, the law provides for a superficial sort of citizenship that states that one?s place of birth is relevant to, and definitive of, one?s membership within a polity. The DREAM Act poses one practical solution to compensate for this flaw in the U. S. legal system created by morally arbitrary citizenship laws. First proposed to Congress in 2001 and recently reintroduced in 2011, the DREAM Act provides a way for undocumented college students and members of the armed forces to acquire legal status and be put on a pathway {{that would allow them to}} acquire full citizenship status eventually. This piece of legislation provides a practical policy solution to morally problematic citizenship laws and takes into account the normative claims of non-citizens. I argue that the DREAM Act should be passed not only because it offers one practical solution to the issue of illegal immigration but also because it offers an appropriate response to the larger issue of morally arbitrary citizenship laws...|$|R
500|$|The Supreme Court's 1873 Slaughterhouse Cases {{decision}} {{contained the}} statement that [...] "The phrase, 'subject to its jurisdiction,' was intended to exclude from its operation children of ministers, consuls, and citizens or subjects of foreign states born within the United States." [...] However, since the Slaughterhouse Cases did not deal with claims of <b>birthright</b> <b>citizenship,</b> this comment was dismissed in Wong Kim Ark and later cases as a passing remark (obiter dictum) lacking any force as a controlling precedent. [...] As to whether the Wong Kim Ark was correct on this point or not, modern scholars are divided.|$|E
500|$|Ever {{since the}} {{affirmation}} by Congress, in the Expatriation Act of 1868, that individuals had an inherent right to expatriation (giving up of citizenship), it {{has historically been}} accepted that certain actions could result in loss of citizenship. This possibility was noted by the Supreme Court in United States v. Wong Kim Ark, an 1898 case involving a man born in the United States to Chinese parents who were legally domiciled in the country. After ruling {{in this case that}} Wong was born a U.S. citizen despite his Chinese ancestry, the Court went on to state that his <b>birthright</b> <b>citizenship</b> [...] " [...] not been lost or taken away by anything happening since his birth." ...|$|E
500|$|James R. Doolittle of Wisconsin objected {{that the}} {{citizenship}} provision {{would not be}} sufficiently narrow to exclude American Indians from citizenship, and {{in an attempt to}} address this issue, he proposed to add a phrase taken from the Civil Rights Act—"excluding Indians not taxed". [...] Although most Senators agreed that <b>birthright</b> <b>citizenship</b> should not be extended to the Indians, a majority saw no need to clarify the issue, and Doolittle's proposal was voted down. [...] Upon its return to the House of Representatives, the proposed Fourteenth Amendment received little debate; no one spoke in opposition to the Senate's addition of the Citizenship Clause, and the complete proposed amendment was approved by the House on June 13, 1866, and declared to have been ratified on July 28, 1868.|$|E

Barr presented a [...] "common sense" [...] approach to the issue by promising {{to put an end}} to <b>birthright</b> <b>citizenship</b> and public education for illegal immigrants, while supporting an increase in green cards. Claremont McKenna College professor John Pitney argued that the candidate was sending mixed messages since [...] "the Libertarian Party essentially supports open borders," [...] and was unlikely to gain the support of anti-immigration activists. A Zogby poll released on August 15, 2008 indicated that most Republicans and Democrats wanted Barr included in the presidential debates. The poll also indicated that nearly 70% of independent voters would have liked to see him included.|$|E
2500|$|Price {{believes}} that {{illegal immigrants in}} the United States should be deported, saying in 2005 of George W.

2500|$|Paul also {{believes}} children {{born in the}} U.S. to illegal aliens should not be granted automatic <b>birthright</b> <b>citizenship.</b> He {{has called for a}} new Constitutional amendment to revise Fourteenth Amendment principles and [...] "end automatic birthright citizenship", and believes that welfare issues are directly tied to the illegal immigration problem.|$|E
2500|$|The heavy {{qualification}} to {{that provision}} of the Belfast Agreement is contained in Annex 2 to the Belfast Agreement. That Annex clarifies that the above-mentioned reference to [...] "the people of Northern Ireland" [...] only means [...] "all persons born in Northern Ireland and having, {{at the time of}} their birth, at least one parent who is a British citizen, an Irish citizen or is otherwise entitled to reside in Northern Ireland without any restriction on their period of residence."

2500|$|The Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution {{guarantees}} citizenship {{status to}} anyone born on United States soil [...] "and {{subject to the}} jurisdiction thereof". This means that, regardless of parents' citizenship status, their children who are born in the United States are full citizens and are eligible for the rights and privileges that such status confers; {{this is called a}} mixed immigrant status family. Thus, within mixed-status families are a range of documentation patterns involving siblings: some born in the U.S. with <b>birthright</b> <b>citizenship,</b> some in the process of attempting to obtain documentation, and some fully undocumented.|$|E
2500|$|Under United States law {{during this}} period, {{particularly}} the Naturalization Act of 1790, only [...] "free white persons" [...] were eligible to naturalize as American citizens. Ineligibility for citizenship prevented Asian immigrants from accessing {{a variety of}} rights such as voting. In a pair of cases, Ozawa v. United States (1922) and United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind (1923), the Supreme Court upheld the racial qualification for citizenship and ruled that Asians were not [...] "white persons." [...] Second-generation Asian Americans, however, could become U.S. citizens due to the <b>birthright</b> <b>citizenship</b> clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; this guarantee was confirmed as applying regardless of race or ancestry by the Supreme Court in United States v. Wong Kim Ark (1898).|$|E
2500|$|The Americo-Liberian {{settlers}} did {{not relate}} {{well to the}} indigenous peoples they encountered, especially those in communities of the more isolated [...] "bush." [...] They knew nothing of their cultures, languages or animist religion. Encounters with tribal Africans in the bush often developed as violent confrontations. The colonial settlements were raided by the Kru and Grebo from their inland chiefdoms. Because of feeling set apart and superior by their culture and education to the indigenous peoples, the Americo-Liberians developed as a small elite that held on to political power. It excluded the indigenous tribesmen from <b>birthright</b> <b>citizenship</b> in their own lands until 1904, in a repetition of the United States' treatment of Native Americans. Because of ethnocentrism and the cultural gap, the Americo-Liberians envisioned creating a western-style state to which the tribesmen should assimilate. They promoted religious organizations to set up missions and schools to educate the indigenous peoples.|$|E
2500|$|The primary was {{initially}} fought primarily between Juppé and Sarkozy, {{the top two}} candidates in primary polls.

He proposed to end family reunifications and reform the right to <b>birthright</b> <b>citizenship,</b> halt the flow of economic migrants, and increase residence requirements to secure French nationality. He reaffirmed {{his interest in the}} [...] "assimilation" [...] of immigrants, and intended to ban other menus for school canteens (i.e., options for Muslim students) as well as Muslim headscarves at universities. Sarkozy also suggested that radical imams be expelled and suspected terrorists be detained by authorities and tried by a special anti-terrorist court, in addition a reduction in the age of criminal responsibility from 18 to 16. He proposed to postpone the increase the retirement age to 64 until 2024, permit exemptions to the 35-hour workweek, cut 300,000 civil service jobs by increasing working hours to 37 per week, and abolish the wealth tax (ISF). Like Le Maire, he did not rule out the possibility of a referendum on the European Union (EU). He also sought a European treaty [...] "refounding", the creation of a European monetary fund, to commit 2% to defense spending by 2025, and to reduce public spending by €100 billion and taxes by €40 billion while reducing the budget deficit to under 3% of GDP.|$|E

5000|$|A {{report by}} an {{organization}} called the National Foundation for American Policy (NFAP) in 2012 asserted that revoking <b>birthright</b> <b>citizenship</b> would be bureaucratic, expensive, {{would result in a}} national ID card, and would not slow illegal immigration. Under current law, if a citizen parent gives birth in a foreign country, they must prove their own citizenship in order for their baby to have citizenship. The NFAP estimated this to cost $600 per baby, not including legal fees. The report alleged that if <b>birthright</b> <b>citizenship</b> were eliminated, every baby in the United States would be subject to this cost. For the four million babies born each year in the U.S., this would total $2.4 billion per year. In addition, currently the US government does not keep any record of births, instead using the records of individual states to issue passports. The report alleged that the end of <b>birthright</b> <b>citizenship</b> would leave the states unable to verify whether a new baby should be granted citizenship, requiring the federal government instead to issue birth certificates, and likely a national ID card. Finally, the report claimed that eliminating <b>birthright</b> <b>citizenship</b> would not reduce illegal immigration. The report said that immigrants come to the United States for economic reasons, and illegal immigrants cannot use a citizen child to be granted citizenship. The report also said that all proposals to end <b>birthright</b> <b>citizenship,</b> aside from a constitutional amendment, would be unconstitutional and quickly be overturned in court. The Center for Immigration Studies disputed these conclusions, asserting in its own 2012 report that the NFAP's claims were [...] "unsupported", that a bureaucratic overhaul would not be necessary, and that ending automatic <b>birthright</b> <b>citizenship</b> would not cost parents money, result in a caste system, or create stateless children.|$|E
