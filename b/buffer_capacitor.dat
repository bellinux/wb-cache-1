The operational {{principle of the}} circuits and the design considerations are described. The main advantage of the circuit is that step-down voltage can be achieved in the circuit by simply configuring with cascaded stages, which {{will be much more}} convenient to be modular development and easy for replacement and maintenance; the voltage and current stresses of most components are smaller than the conventional converter. Using <b>buffer</b> <b>capacitor</b> to reserve energy, there are no magnetic energy storage elements in the circuits. Weight and size can be further reduced due to high-frequency-power line operation. Zero current switching (ZCS) is achieved by introducing small resonant inductors.

40|$|Electrostatic {{transducers}} for {{vibration energy}} scavenging {{have been an}} object to numerous studies, but are still facing major issues relating to their conditioning circuit. One {{of the most popular}} ones uses a charge pump and a flyback circuit based on a Buck DC-DC converter (Fig. 1). A commutation between the energy accumulation in the charge pump and the recharge of the <b>buffer</b> <b>capacitor</b> Cres is assured by a switch which is the major bottleneck in the energy harvester circuit. The commutation timing of the switch determines the efficiency of the energy harvesting. In previous papers [1] the switch commutates periodically with some fixed duty ratio.

40|$|Piezoelectric {{injectors}} {{allow to}} inject precise proportional quantities of fuel at extremely high speed. Controlled by pulses {{from the engine}} management unit, they work like solenoid valves, opening and closing back very rapidly, spraying the exact quantity of fuel determined by the injection computer into the engine combustion chambers. However, {{for this type of}} injectors an impulse of a hundred volts is applied in order to actuate them. This is a big concern in automotive environment, where the 12 V battery voltages is still the main power source available. Therefore, a power converter is needed to interface battery voltage and piezo actuator; for mechanical and electrical reasons (weight, dimensions and power losses) a switching amplifier is preferred with respect to linear amplifier, especially for this type of applications where efficiency and weight are the main issues. Fig. 1 presents a switching amplifier for piezo actuator: it consists of two components, a unidirectional DC/DC converter with a small input power that loads a large <b>buffer</b> <b>capacitor</b> and a bidirectional DC/DC converter, which controls the energy alternating between the <b>buffer</b> <b>capacitor</b> and the piezo actuator. The requirements on the unidirectional DC/DC converter are few. It only needs to compensate for the power losses of the two stages plus the energy dissipated in the actuator and the connected mechanical system [6]. Conventional DC/DC boost converter is not the best solution in piezoelectric based applications where a high step up ratio (more than 20) and high efficiency power conversion is required. Flyback converter could be an alternative topology but presents high switching losses and it has an insulated output, so not compliant with electrical load specification. An efficient high-step up DC/DC converter is presented for interfacing the standard 12 V battery with the high voltage DC-bus used for piezoelectric actuators system. In the proposed converter, two coupled inductor boost converters are interleaved and controlled by an FPGA. Different types of control techniques could be used to limit the input current [7]; the solution presented herein allows fast transient response and best performances with respect to traditional control techniques. Moreover the implemented technique has the advantages of lower electromagnetic emission and higher operating frequency capability, compared to the standard fixed frequency control; on the other hand it is difficult to design the EMI filter due to the intrinsic variable frequency. The high computational load of the control algorithms forces the use of an FPGA implementation in order to achieve the desired accuracy in real time control at the frequency of the PWM signal needs for the DC/DC converter, which will be 200 kHz. Design and analysis of the proposed converter are presented. Finally, experimental results are reported in order to validate the proposed converte...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Harmonic {{pollution}} and low power factor in power systems caused by power converters {{have been of}} great concern. To overcome these problems several converter topologies using advanced semiconductor devices and control schemes have been proposed. This investigation is to identify a low cost, small size, efficient and reliable ac to dc converter to meet the input performance index of UPS. The performance of single phase and three phase ac to dc converter along with various control techniques are studied and compared. This project presents a novel ac/dc converter based on a quasi-active power factor correction (PFC) scheme. In the proposed circuit, the power factor is improved by using an auxiliary winding coupled to the transformer of a cascade dc/dc fly back converter. The auxiliary winding is placed between the input rectifier and the lowfrequency filter capacitor {{to serve as a}} magnetic switch to drive an input inductor. Since the dc/dc converter is operated at high-switching frequency, the auxiliary windings produce a high frequency pulsating source such that the input current conduction angle is significantly lengthened and the input current harmonics is reduced. Since the use of a single inductor, the cost z reduced a lot and the efficiency of the system is improved. The power factor is maintained constant by using a <b>buffer</b> <b>capacitor</b> in parallel to the system for compensating the inductive components.

40|$|Grid-connected {{photovoltaic}} (PV) {{power systems}} have been sustaining an exponential growth rate during the past decade. This steep growth is driven by a growing concern about climate change, the adoption of an aggressive regional renewable portfolio standard, rebates and tax incentives, and reduction in PV system cost. One of the main technical barriers that can ultimately limit further PV penetration is the fast variations in the PV system 2 ̆ 7 s output power induced by cloud transients. Such events are known to cause voltage fluctuations which may lead to excessive operations of voltage regulation equipment and light flickering. Solar irradiance variability, which can be easily recorded using a pyranometer and a data logger, is used in numerous studies to assess the AC power injected into the electrical network by PV systems. But in reality, the two variables are not perfectly proportional with one another, nor synchronized in time due to delays within the inverter circuit elements and controls. As a consequence, computer models that accurately simulate the dynamic behavior of PV systems under moving clouds would thus be of high value. In this thesis, a dynamic MATLAB/Simulink model of a single phase single stage grid-connected PV system {{that can be used}} to predict the deviations in AC power output under variable solar irradiance is presented.

It comprises of a line-frequency rectifier, a stack of capacitors, a set of regulating converters, and a power combining converter (or set of power combining converters).

40|$|Capacitive micromachined {{ultrasonic}} transducers (CMUTs) {{represent an}} effective alternative to piezoelectric transducers for medical ultrasound imaging applications. They are microelectromechanical devices fabricated using silicon micromachining techniques, {{developed in the}} last two decades in many laboratories. The interest for this novel transducer technology relies on its full compatibility with standard integrated circuit technology that makes it possible to integrate on the same chip the transducers and the electronics, thus enabling the realization of extremely low-cost and high-performance devices, including both 1 -D or 2 -D arrays. Being capacitive transducers, CMUTs require a high bias voltage to be properly operated in pulse-echo imaging applications. The typical bias supply residual ripple of high-quality high-voltage (HV) generators is in the millivolt range, which is comparable with the amplitude of the received echo signals, and it is particularly difficult to minimize. The aim of this paper is to analyze the classical CMUT biasing circuits, highlighting the features of each one, and to propose two novel HV generator architectures optimized for CMUT biasing applications. The first circuit proposed is an ultralow-residual ripple (< 5 μV) HV generator that uses an extremely stable sinusoidal power oscillator topology. The second circuit employs a commercially available integrated stepup converter characterized by a particularly efficient switching topology. The circuit is used to bias the CMUT by charging a <b>buffer</b> <b>capacitor</b> synchronously with the pulsing sequence, thus reducing the impact of the switching noise on the received echo signals.

40|$|Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a {{promising}} treatment for numerous kinds of cancer. A potential advantage of PDT {{compared to other}} cancer treatments like radiotherapy and chemotherapy is its selectivity. PDT {{is based on a}} photosensitive substance that is administered to a patient. The substance has selective uptake by cancerous tissue and when illuminated with a certain wavelength it destroys the tissue in close proximity. Metronomic PDT is a new proposed technique for treating patients with cancer. For this technique a new kind of light source is needed. The purpose of this thesis is to develop the light source needed for this technique. This light source also needs to monitor the treatment and should be controlled and powered from the outside. An optode chip has been developed which carries one or two LEDs used as light source and up to four photodiodes. The photodiodes were designed after Monte Carlo simulations to get an indication of the amount of incident light. The readout of the photodiodes consists of a transimpedance amplifier and an A/D converter. The LED is driven with pulse width modulation to adjust intensity. The communication is implemented with a Radio Frequency Identification technique. The power for the implant is provided by an inductive power link that was designed for low power dissipation in the coil. The power is <b>buffered</b> in a <b>capacitor</b> in case the coupling of the two coils is lost. It also allows the field to be switched off during measurement. The whole implant is controlled with a microcontroller, which has PWM and A/D conversion on chip. The several devices are soldered on a flexible printed circuit board. The flexible PCB was shaped {{in such a way that}} the coils for communication and power could be big enough to get a reasonable coupling and was designed for an animal model. The big part is placed on the shoulders of the rat, the optode is attached to the head of the rat. The electronic components are encapsulated with medical grade silicone.

40|$|Solar {{photovoltaic}} {{power generation}} is a promising clean {{and renewable energy}} technology that can draw upon the planet's most abundant power source - the sun. However, relatively high levelized cost of energy (LCOE), {{the ratio of the}} total cost of ownership to the total energy extracted over the lifetime of the generation system, has limited the grid penetration of solar power. Mismatch loss remains an important issue to address in PV systems, and a solar power system can lose as much as 30 % of its energy generation capability over a year due to mismatch. Maximum power point tracking (MPPT) using power electronics converters can increase the overall solar energy extraction efficiency and thus reduce the LCOE. Many power electronics solutions have been proposed at the module and submodule levels, which only partially addresses the mismatch problem. However, scaling the existing solutions to finer optimization granularity has been cost-prohibitive. In {{the first part of this}} thesis, a new cell-level strategy, termed diffusion charge redistribution (DCR), is proposed to fully recover mismatch loss. The proposed technique processes power by leveraging the intrinsic solar cell capacitance rather than relying on externally added intermediate energy storage in order to drastically reduce to the cost of MPPT while enabling the finest optimization granularity. Moreover, strings balanced by this technique exhibit power versus current curves that are convex, which simplifies the required MPPT algorithm. Cell-level power balancing may also ease the testing and binning criteria during manufacturing, which leads to additional cost savings. Differential power processing (DPP) is a key concept to further improve energy efficiency by minimizing the amount of power conversion. In the second part of this thesis, the concept of differential power processing is introduced to the proposed cell-level power balancing technique by rethinking the string-level power electronics architecture. This enhancement can improve the overall efficiency of DCR by more than 3. 5 % while permitting the use of a slower DCR switching frequency. It can also be applied to many other cascaded converter architectures to reduce insertion loss. In particular, the proposed differential DCR (dDCR) architecture simultaneously achieves maximum power point tracking without any external passive components at the cell-level, and maintains differential power processing with zero insertion loss. This is accomplished by decoupling the MPPT functional block from the DPP functional block. The new power optimization aims to not only maximize energy extraction from each solar cell but also minimize the amount of processed power. The new multi-variable optimization space for the dDCR topology is evaluated and shown to be convex, which simplifies the required optimization algorithm. The inverter represents a large part of the overall cost and is often the most failure-prone component in a photovoltaic power system. In order to improve the cost and reliability of a grid-tie inverter, switched-capacitor techniques are adopted to reduce the required capacitance and rated voltage of the dc-link capacitor. The proposed switched-capacitor energy <b>buffer</b> can improve <b>capacitor</b> energy utilization by more than four times for a system with a 10 % peak-to-peak ripple specification, and enable the use of film or ceramic capacitors to prolong the system lifetime to over a hundred years. The third part of this thesis explores the SC energy buffer design space and examines tradeoffs regarding circuit topology, switching configuration, and control complexity. Practical applications require control schemes capable of handling source and load transients. A two-step control methodology that mitigates undesirable transient responses is proposed and demonstrated in simulation. Finally, dc power system architectures have attracted interest as a means for achieving high overall efficiency and facilitating integration of renewable and distributed energy sources, such as a photovoltaic system. However, to enable widespread adoption of dc systems, the reliability of fault protection and interruption capability is essential. A new dc breaker topology, called the series-connected Z-source circuit breaker, is introduced to minimize the reflected fault current drawn from a source while retaining a common return ground path. Analogous in some respects to an ac thermal-magnetic breaker, the proposed Z-source breaker can be designed for considerations affecting both rate of fault current rise and absolute fault current level. The proposed manual tripping mechanism also enables protection against both instantaneous large surges in current and longer-term over-current conditions. by Arthur Hsu Chen Chang. Thesis: Ph.
