After {{eight years of}} service, the TSA coating on the production risers and tethers was still in good condition. The condition in the splash zone was indistinguishable from other inspected components. However, there were notable differences between the production risers and the tethers. The tethers, having a vinyl sealer, showed a <b>blistered</b> <b>surface,</b> while the risers, with a silicone sealer, did not show any blistering. No corrosion has been observed underneath any of the blisters. The importance of adequate sealers in connection with blistering has been documented by testing. The excellent performance of TSA coating in the splash zone is further documented by field studies published {{in the last few}} years. Initial confidence in the splash-zone performance of the thermal-sprayed aluminum (TSA) coating for the Hutton TLP was based on results of in-house salt fog tests, the experience of the American Welding Society (AWS) and the US Navy, and information from the British Standard Institution. 1 - 3 The AWS study evaluated various parameters such as coating thickness, surface preparation, and sealer coatings in long term exposures in several environments. Sealed TSA-coated panels (80 microns) at Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina, showed no damage to the underlying steel after 19 years exposure. 1 The main result from the US Navy study was the successful performance of a 125 micron unsealed TSA coating after a 15 -year exposure and a 100 micron TSA coating after 18 - 1 / 2 years (Port Hueneme Harbor, California). ...|$|E

The effect of varying pH (4, 9 and 11) on fresh and dry mesa flour (pH 5, 7 and 10) tortillas was also evaluated. Nixtamal was washed at three different levels to obtain tortillas containing about 0, 50 and 100 % pericarp. Fumaric acid and lime solutions were used to produce acidic and alkaline tortillas respectively. Tortilla texture was evaluated at 0, 1 and 7 days of storage objectively using a texture analyzer and subjectively using a solvability test. As pericarp content and pH increased tortillas were softer, more flexible and extensible with a darker yellow color. Acidic tortillas were harder with a white color. Pericarp improved texture of tortillas during storage. Commercial corn bran was alkaline treated to obtain NCB with functionality similar to nixtamalized corn pericarp. Dry masa flour (DMF) (1 kg) was mixed with 0, 50 and 100 g dry basis of NCB and processed into tortillas. Tortillas containing NCB had a pH of 9, were more flexible and rollable than control tortillas. Alkaline pH tortillas puffed during baking; these tortillas were yellow with a soft, moist texture. Tortillas containing nixtamalized rice and wheat brans were soft and flexible. A sensory panel found that tortillas containing nixtamalized cereal brans had a strong alkaline flavor and aroma and a <b>blistered</b> <b>surface,</b> with a soft, moist texture. NCB tortillas had the highest overall acceptability scores. Pericarp from nixtamal and alkaline pH slowed the staling mechanisms of tortillas.

40|$|Recent {{work has}} {{demonstrated}} {{that the process of}} silicon thin film separation by hydrogen implantation, as well as the more basic phenomenon of <b>surface</b> <b>blistering,</b> can occur at a much lower total dose when H and He are co-implanted than when H is implanted alone.

The second experiment involved co-implantation of H and He at a temperature of 77 K to retain a larger amount of damage for the same gas dose. In the third experiment, Li was co-implanted with H, to create additional damage without introducing additional gas. These experiments together show that increasing the implantation damage itself hampers the formation of <b>surface</b> <b>blisters,</b> and that the increased efficiency observed for He co-implantation with H is due to the supplementary source of gas provided by the He...|$|R

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Cultured skin substitutes consisting of collagen-glycosaminoglycan substrates populated with autologous fibroblasts and keratinocytes have been demonstrated to close full-thickness skin wounds in athymic mice and to express normal skin antigens after closure of excised wounds in burn patients. METHODS: Data were collected from 17 patients between days 2 and 14 to determine incidence of exudate, incidence of regrafting, coloration, keratinization, and percentage of site covered by graft (n = 17). Outcome was evaluated on an ordinal scale (0 = worst; 10 = best) beginning at day 14, with primary analyses at 28 days (n = 10) and 1 year (n = 4) for erythema, pigmentation, epithelial <b>blistering,</b> <b>surface</b> roughness, skin suppleness, and raised scar. RESULTS: Sites treated with CSSs had increased incidence of exudate (p = 0. 06) and decreased percentage of engraftment (p < 0. 05) compared with STAG. Outcome parameters during the first year showed no differences in erythema, blistering, or suppleness. Pigmentation was greater, scar was less raised, but regrafting was more frequent in CSS sites than STAG. No differences in qualitative outcomes were found after 1 year, and antibodies to bovine collagen were not detected in patient sera. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that outcome of engrafted CSSs is not different from STAG and that increased incidence of regrafting is related to decreased percentage of initial engraftment. Increased rates of engraftment of CSSs may lead to improved outcome for closure of burn wounds, allow greater availability of materials for grafting, and reduce requirements for donor skin autograft...|$|R
40|$|Clastic injectites {{are widely}} {{recognized}} in deep-water stratigraphic successions, although their sediment transport processes, propagation direction, {{and depth of}} injection are poorly constrained. Understanding how they form is important, as injectites are increasingly being recognised as significant components of sedimentary basin-fills, yet are not predicted by standard sedimentary facies models. Here, analysis of features {{on the margins of}} exhumed clastic sills and dykes, and clasts within them, enables their genesis to be determined. A diverse array of diagnostic structures is found on the margins of injectites in the Karoo Basin, South Africa, where the net direction of injection and position of the parent sand are well constrained. Injectite margin features include mudstone clast-rich surfaces, planar or smooth <b>surfaces,</b> <b>blistered</b> <b>surfaces,</b> and parallel and plumose ridged surfaces. Combined, these features are critical in distinguishing injected sands, where injectites are strata-concordant, from those of primary deposition. All features are indicative of propagation through brittle, very fine-grained sediments, at depths where the applied shear stress is at least four times the tensile strength of the host rock. Additionally, the presence of parallel ridges, plumose ridges, and steps allows local fracture propagation to be constrained, and in turn injection direction. The features described provide evidence that sands were injected at considerable depth in closed fractures with limited capacity for flow dilution and turbulence enhancement. Calculated Reynolds numbers, lack of erosion at injectite walls, and the presence of mud clasts at the top and base of sills, indicate that many flows were likely fully laminar during injection. The sedimentary features of these confined, relatively deep, laminar flow-induced injectites are very different from injectites that reach the surface and produce extrudites. Surface-linked injectites are associated with open conduits where a greater fraction of carrier fluid to particles can be accommodated, enabling highly turbulent, lower-concentration flows...|$|R

40|$|Exfoliation is a {{technique}} used to remove a thin, uniform layer of material from the bulk that involves the annealing of hydrogen ion-implanted materials in order to initiate defect nucleation and growth leading to guided crack propagation. This study presents {{an investigation into the}} annealing process required to initiate blistering (an essential precursor to exfoliation) in (0001) sapphire implanted at room temperature with hydrogen ions. Triple axis x-ray diffraction was used to characterize the evolution of the implanted layer for single crystal (0001) sapphire substrates implanted at room temperature at 360 keV with either a 5 x 1016 cm- 2 or 8 x 1016 cm- 2 dose of hydrogen ions. A simulation of the ion distribution in TRIM estimated that the projected range and thickness of the implanted layer for both doses was approximately 2. 2 ï¿½m. Following implantation, the implanted sapphire was annealed using a two-step annealing procedure. The first step was performed at a lower temperature, ideally to nucleate and coarsen defects. Temperatures investigated ranged from 550 – 650 ï¿½C. The second step was performed at a higher temperature (800 ï¿½C) to induce further defect coarsening and <b>surface</b> <b>blistering.</b> After all annealing steps, triple axis ω/ 2 θ and ω scans were taken to observe any changes in the diffraction profile – namely, any reduction in the amplitude and shift in the location of the fringes associated with strain in the crystal – which would correlate with defect growth and nucleation. It was found that significant strain fringe reduction first occurred after annealing at 650 ï¿½C for 8 hours for both doses; however, it was not clear whether or not this strain reduction was due primarily to hydrogen diffusion or to recovery of other defects induced during the ion implantation. The ω/ 2 θ curves were then fit using Bede RADS in order to quantify the strain within the crystal and confirm the reduction of the strained layer within the crystal. Finally, Nomarski optical images of the sample surfaces were taken after each step to observe any visual changes or blistering that might have occurred. These optical images showed that the strain reduction observed using XRD did not correlate to blistering, as no blisters were observed in any of the optical images. 	Experimental results showed that at temperatures below 650 ï¿½C, no significant strain reduction occurs in hydrogen ion implanted (0001) sapphire. It has also been determined that for (0001) sapphire implanted at room temperature, {{it was not possible to}} produce <b>surface</b> <b>blistering</b> after a two-step annealing process at 650 ï¿½C and 800 ï¿½C, although significant strain reduction did occur, and ω scans showed peak broadening with subsequent annealing, indicating increasing mosaicity and potential defect nucleation. This was in contrast to previous findings that asserted that for sapphire annealed at 650 ï¿½C, <b>surface</b> <b>blistering</b> was observable. [7] As previous findings were based on sapphire implanted at elevated temperatures, this may imply that the sapphire substrate reaches a higher temperature than expected during such implantation processes, which may account for the capability for <b>surface</b> <b>blistering</b> at a lower temperature.
