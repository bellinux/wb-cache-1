5|$|The Delichon martins were {{originally}} cliff nesters, breeding in colonies situated under an overhang on a vertical cliff. However, the house martin now largely uses human structures, as, {{to a lesser}} extent, does the Asian house martin. The typical nest is a grass or feather-lined deep closed mud <b>bowl</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> small opening at the top, but many Asian house martins leave {{the top of the}} nest open.|$|E
5|$|Bhikshatana {{is often}} {{accompanied}} by women and bhuta-gana (goblin attendants of Shiva). One of the attendants placed {{to the left of}} Bhikshatana should carry a large bowl used for storing the food alms of Shiva. The women, often seven in number, are variously pictured as enamoured of Shiva, eager to embrace him, blessing him, or serving him food in his begging <b>bowl</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> ladle. The clothes of some of these women are slipping from their loins, symbolising their lust. The woman giving Bhikshatana alms is also interpreted as Annapurna, the goddess of grain. Various gods, celestial beings, and sages bow to him with folded hands. In some scenes, the sages are depicted as angry and trying to beat Bhikshatana, alluding to the Deodar Forest legend.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} week, {{the team}} played the Bengals in the playoffs, {{this time at}} Paul Brown Stadium, and secured a 24–14 victory over Cincinnati. That victory meant that the Jets would travel to San Diego to play the Chargers, who had won eleven straight games, in the divisional round. Strong performances by Sanchez, running back Shonn Greene, and the Jets defense helped the Jets to a 17–14 win over the Chargers. New York played the top-seeded Colts in the AFC Championship Game and secured an early 17–6 lead. They had little luck {{in the second half}} as the Colts went to the Super <b>Bowl</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 30–17 victory.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of the 1982 {{television}} contract signed by the NFL with the three networks, this game was the first Super Bowl to be televised in the United States by ABC, as they earned their first turn at the Super <b>Bowl,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> new alternation process started for the 1983 game. Previously, the Super Bowl telecast alternated between CBS and NBC, while the networks simulcast the first AFL-NFL World Championship Game.|$|E
25|$|Although the Super Bowl {{had grown}} into America's biggest one-day {{sporting}} event by this point, many believe the 13th edition began the game's evolution to unofficial national holiday. It was the first Super <b>Bowl</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> true heavyweight title-fight feel, given the Steelers' and Cowboys' unquestioned status as the two best teams in the NFL, and {{the honor of the}} first three-time Super Bowl champion (and likely team of the 1970s designation) that would go to the winner.|$|E

25|$|One week later, the Rams {{advanced}} to the Super <b>Bowl</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 29–24 win over the Philadelphia Eagles in the NFC Championship Game. Philadelphia managed to build a 17–13 halftime lead, but St. Louis scored 16 consecutive second half points (2 touchdown runs by Faulk and a Wilkins field goal) to earn the win. Warner finished the game with 22 of 33 pass completions for 212 yards and a touchdown, with no interceptions, while Faulk rushed for 159 yards and 2 touchdowns.|$|E
25|$|Carolina's defense {{shut down}} the Eagles offense, only {{allowing}} a field goal and holding Donovan McNabb to just 10 of 22 completions for 100 yards. Rookie cornerback Ricky Manning intercepted McNabb three times, while the Panthers defense recorded {{a total of five}} sacks. McNabb also sustained a lower-rib injury early in the game but stayed in until the second half. Although Carolina's offense only scored 14 points, it was more than enough for the team to earn their first trip to the Super <b>Bowl</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 14–3 win. For the Eagles, it was their third straight NFC Championship Game loss.|$|E

Snubbed from a BCS Bowl despite a higher ranking than teams who {{received}} bids, the Gamecocks finished {{the regular season}} ranked number nine in the country. South Carolina began their season by winning against North Carolina, but losing to Georgia. From there, they won four consecutive games, including a win against Central Florida, the Knights' only loss of the regular season. After a narrow loss to Tennessee, South Carolina closed their season winning five consecutive games before entering the bowl.|$|E
25|$|A {{set of four}} bowls with wide, {{horizontal}} rims {{represent a}} later development of the flanged bowl form. The rims, or flanges, are edged with large beads, and have low-relief decoration that once more follows the traditional pagan, Bacchic theme, with pastoral scenes, numerous animals, natural and mythical, and Bacchic masks. They also have circular medallions of figural decoration within the bowl. One (no.5) has a scene showing a hunter attacking a bear. This <b>bowl,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> diameter of 300mm, is a little larger than the other three, which all have a diameter of 268mm and central medallions depicting single heads in profile: a young woman, a veiled matron, and a helmeted head. The identification of these remains uncertain.|$|E
25|$|The Bruins {{were ranked}} No. 7 in preseason {{national}} polls, and {{were expected to}} contend for not {{only one of the}} four berths in the College Football Playoff, but also the national championship. They started the season 4–0, often struggling, before suffering consecutive home losses to the Utah Utes and Oregon Ducks. After dropping out of the polls, they re-emerged as playoff contenders with five straight wins. However, UCLA lost their final home game to the Stanford Cardinal. They concluded their season in the 2015 Alamo <b>Bowl</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> win over the Kansas State Wildcats, 40–35, and a 10-win season. It was the ninth 10-win season in school history, and just the third time in their history that they have won 10 games in consecutive seasons.|$|E

This capstone victory marked the end of the most successful season in school history, in which the Jayhawks went 12–1 (.923). The team plays at Memorial Stadium, which recently underwent a $31 million renovation to add the Anderson Family Football Complex, adding a football practice facility adjacent to the stadium complete with indoor partial practice field, weight room, and new locker room.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the Giants {{became the}} first NFC team (third overall) {{to advance to the}} Super Bowl by winning three playoff games on the road. After beating the fourth-seeded Tampa Bay Buccaneers 24–14, the Giants upset the top-seeded Dallas Cowboys 21–17 when McQuarters intercepted a pass from Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo in the end zone as time expired. New York {{advanced}} to the Super <b>Bowl</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 23–20 overtime win over the second-seeded Green Bay Packers in the third coldest game in NFL history (−1°F at kickoff, −24°F wind chill) with an interception by Corey Webster that set up Lawrence Tynes's game-winning 47-yard field goal. The field goal was the longest by a visiting kicker in Lambeau Field postseason history. This {{turned out to be the}} final game Brett Favre played for the Packers.|$|E
25|$|The trapper who has {{located a}} cricket must catch and contain the insect without causing it any injuries. Present-day trappers use zhao, a soft {{catching}} net {{on a wire}} frame, to contain the cricket on the ground. The captured crickets are then placed into a clay pot and stay there until being sold; they are fed a few boiled rice grains per day. Earlier, the Chinese used cage-like traps made of bamboo or ivory rods. Pavel Piassetsky, who visited Beijing in the 1880s, described a different technique. The Beijing people used two kind of tools: a bell-like <b>bowl</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hole in its bottom, and a tube several inches long. When a cricket {{was forced to leave}} its hideout, the trapper would quickly cover it with the bell. When the trapped cricket emerged from the hole, the trapper would present the tube, and the cricket would eagerly hide inside it. The plugged tube then became a convenient cricket cage.|$|E

50|$|Traditionally, finger spinners <b>bowled</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> {{emphasis}} on side spin. With {{the advent of}} covered and better batting pitches the focus changed to <b>bowling</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> component of top spin. The top spin provides loop which {{makes it harder for}} the batsman to make an early judgement of the length of the delivery. The ball tends to be released <b>with</b> <b>a</b> slightly upward trajectory which raises the ball above the batsman's eye line. The topspin on the ball then causes the ball to dip earlier and bounce higher.|$|R
