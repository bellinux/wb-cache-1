5|$|There was a {{sense of}} closure for Grove <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> the 1945 season, as he was awarded $310 ($ today) in damages for the auto {{accident}} in 1941. He held out for a new contract in the off-season, and finally signed with the White Sox a couple weeks <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> the season after becoming the last remaining holdout. Grove was the workhorse of the White Sox, leading the team in games pitched (33) and started (30), while remaining the youngest pitcher on the roster. He finished the season with 217 pitched innings, a career best four shutouts, a 14–12 record, and a 3.44 ERA.|$|E

40|$|Analyses of {{selected}} samples {{coming from a}} well exposed plio-pleistocenic stratigraphic section located along the coastline of northwestern Sardinia, allow us to evaluate the recent geomorphological evolution of a sector belonging to an ancient valley infilled by sedimentary deposits, mainly of continental environment. The palaeovalley filling has been favored by erosional processes in post-Tyrrhenian regression times under climate exchange recorded during Holocene. The occurrence of halite mineral phase in the studied stratigraphic sequence, suggests the prolonged occurrence of salt environments during the early phase of post- Tyrrhenian regression <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>begin</b> <b>of</b> an aeolian regime. Assuming a uniform erosive process for the last 80 Ka, we evaluate its the efficiency {{on the basis of}} the volume of deposits infilling the investigated palaeovalley.

5|$|A {{resolution}} to this apparent inconsistency {{is offered by}} inflationary theory in which a homogeneous and isotropic scalar energy field dominates the universe at some very early period (before baryogenesis). During inflation, the universe undergoes exponential expansion, and the particle horizon expands much more rapidly than previously assumed, so that regions presently {{on opposite sides of}} the observable universe are well inside each other's particle horizon. The observed isotropy of the CMB then follows from the fact that this larger region was in causal contact <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> inflation.|$|E

40|$|Introduction The NA 48 {{experiment}} has {{originally been}} designed to precisely measure direct CP violation in the decay of neutral kaons to two pions. It is a typical fixed target experiment: Neutral kaons and hyperons are produced by protons interacting with two targets and decay in a roughly 100 m long decay region (Fig. 1). One target (far target) is located 126 m <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>begin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decay region, a distance large enough that all K S mesons and neutral hyperons have decayed <b>before</b> reaching <b>the</b> final collimator. The other target (near target) is located only 6 m <b>before</b> <b>the</b> decay region. Decays observed from this target therefore are predominantly K S and and neutral hyperon (#, #) decays, but may also be K L decays. In both neutral beams charged particles are deflected from the beam line by sweeping magnets. During the CP violation measurement, both targets were used simultaneously, producing two almost collinear beams of neutral kaons. Apart from the CP violation measurement, s...|$|R
