40|$|Flow processes, {{taking place}} during the {{concreting}} of diaphragm wall panels (D-wall panels), are of great importance {{for the quality of}} the wall. During this phase, the bentonite, present in the excavated trench, should be completely replaced by concrete in a controlled way. In literature several cases are described in which this process resulted in bentonite inclusions in the panel. These inclusions often lead to severe problems, like leakages, for the <b>building</b> <b>pit</b> to be excavated within the diaphragm wall panels. Beside the risks for the <b>building</b> <b>pit,</b> leakages caused by bentonite inclusions can also have large consequences for nearby constructions. In this article, set up and results of a full-scale diaphragm wall test are described. Conclusions are drawn with regard to the influence of several parameters on the flow process and subsequently {{on the quality of the}} wall and the risk on bentonite inclusions.
