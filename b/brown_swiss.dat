25|$|It {{is unknown}} exactly when people started cooking beef. Cattle were widely used across the Old World as draft animals (oxen), for milk, or {{specifically}} for human consumption. With the mechanization of farming, some breeds were specifically bred to increase meat yield, resulting in Chianina and Charolais cattle, or {{to improve the}} texture of meat, giving rise to the Murray Grey, Angus, and Wagyū. Some breeds have been selected for both meat and milk production, such as the <b>Brown</b> <b>Swiss</b> (Braunvieh).|$|E

Commercial dairy farming using automated milking equipment produces the vast majority of milk in developed countries. Dairy cattle such as the Holstein have been bred selectively for increased milk production. About 90% of the dairy cows in the United States and 85% in Great Britain are Holsteins.

40|$|The {{composition}} and physical nature of milk is very complex. The stability of milk {{depends upon the}} different constituent of milk. Determination of heat stability of milk {{is one of the}} factors that assess the stability of milk. In this study an attempt was made to measure the heat stability of milk obtained from different varieties of cows and also made an attempt to identify the different components on heat stability. The genetic variants and protein concentration of casein in the milk of six different varieties of cows were evaluated. The protein concentration in inbreed varieties are more than that of others followed by Holstein and Holstein-Friesian was found least. We also found that the concentration of casein was highest in inbreed varieties followed by Holstein and was least in Holstein-Friesian. The heat stability was maximum in <b>Swiss</b> <b>Brown</b> followed by inbreed and was least in Holstein-Jersey and Holstein. Lactose concentration was maximum in inbreed varieties followed by Sindhi cross and was least in <b>Swiss</b> <b>Brown.</b> Calcium concentration in inbreed variety was found to be maximum followed by Holstein, however, least was found in <b>Swiss</b> <b>Brown.</b> In Holstein varieties, the potassium concentration was found to be maximum, however the concentration was least in inbreeds.

The strictly formularized iBCS could only explain 47. 3 % of the BFT variance. The pin bone region was identified to cause the biggest assessing problems.

40|$|In recent years, {{brown trout}} catches have been declining in many Swiss rivers. One {{hypothesis}} is that this declining catch is linked to environmental estrogens, known to {{have the potential to}} adversely affect fish reproduction. In order to assess if the reproductive health of brown trout is impaired, we sampled fish at three sites along four rivers with a well documented catch decline. These rivers are affected by inputs of treated sewage effluent. The sampling was conducted during two years; we measured plasma vitellogenin (Vtg) concentrations and surveyed gonadal histology. Analysis of plasma Vtg revealed elevated concentrations (up to 8 mu g/mL) in only 10 out of 197 males. Furthermore, there were no site specific patterns to this induction. These results indicate that the exposure to estrogenic compounds is low. Also the incidence of ovarian atresia was low and we found no male intersex fish. In contrast to males, females caught along two rivers had spermatogenic activity in ovarian tissue. However, this intersex condition {{does not appear to be}} connected to exposure to environmental estrogens. At one of 12 sites there was a high incidence of gonadal parasites in ovarian tissue, which may affect reproductive output but was not a general problem across sites. In conclusion, the exposure to estrogenic compounds does not appear to significantly affect the reproductive parameters we investigated in <b>Swiss</b> <b>brown</b> trout...|$|R
