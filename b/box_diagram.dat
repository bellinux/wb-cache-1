5000|$|Assume the {{existence}} of an economy with two agents, Octavio and Abby, who consume two goods X and Y of which there are fixed supplies, as illustrated in the above Edgeworth <b>box</b> <b>diagram.</b> Further, assume an initial distribution (endowment) of the goods between Octavio and Abby and let each have normally structured (convex) preferences represented by indifference curves that are convex toward the people's respective origins. If the initial allocation is not at a point of tangency between an indifference curve of Octavio and one of Abby, then that initial allocation must be at a point where an indifference curve of Octavio crosses one of Abby. These two indifference curves form a lens shape, with the initial allocation at one of the two corners of the lens. Octavio and Abby will choose to make mutually beneficial trades — that is, they will trade to a point that is on a better (farther from the origin) indifference curve for both. Such a point will be in the interior of the lens, and the rate at which one good will be traded for the other will be between the marginal rate of substitution of Octavio and that of Abby. Since the trades will always provide each person with more of one good and less of the other, trading results in movement upward and to the left, or downward and to the right, in the diagram.|$|E

5000|$|In microeconomics, the {{contract}} curve is {{the set of}} points representing final allocations of two goods between two people that could occur {{as a result of}} mutually beneficial trading between those people given their initial allocations of the goods. All the points on this locus are Pareto efficient allocations, meaning that from any one of these points there is no reallocation that could make one of the people more satisfied with his or her allocation without making the other person less satisfied. The contract curve is the subset of the Pareto efficient points that could be reached by trading from the people's initial holdings of the two goods. It is drawn in the Edgeworth <b>box</b> <b>diagram</b> shown here, in which each person's allocation is measured vertically for one good and horizontally for the other good from that person's origin (point of zero allocation of both goods); one person's origin is the lower left corner of the Edgeworth box, and the other person's origin is the upper right corner of the box. The people's initial endowments (starting allocations of the two goods) are represented by a point in the diagram; the two people will trade goods with each other until no further mutually beneficial trades are possible.

40|$|Abstract. We {{show that}} because of the milder GIM suppression, the four-quark dipenguin {{operator}} contributes to the short distance piece of the D 0 − ¯ D 0 mixing amplitude at the same order of magnitude as the <b>box</b> <b>diagram.</b> In addition, we put an upper bound ∆mLDR D ≤ 5 × ∆mbox D on a long-distance resonant contribution induced by the penguin mixing. The phenomenon of meson mixing has been studied for a long time. Observed in the K 0 − ¯ K 0 and B 0 − ¯ B 0 systems, it provides an extremely sensitive test of the Standard Model (SM). Extremely large value of the top quark mass makes the short distance <b>box</b> <b>diagram</b> (e. g. Fig. 1 a) dominate B 0 − ¯ B 0 and K 0 − ¯ K 0 mixing amplitudes. This fact effectively turns GIM cancellation mechanism (vanishing of the total ∆Q = 2 contribution in the limit of equal internal quark masses) into the ”GIM-enhancement ” of the short-distance contribution to ∆mP for P = {K, B}. Long-distance contributions associated with the propagation of the hadronic degrees of freedom and higher-order QCD effects are relatively unimportant for the mixing of B and K mesons. The situation is drastically different {{in the case of the}} D 0 − ¯ D 0 system: the only available heavy b-quark contribution to the <b>box</b> <b>diagram</b> providing ∆C = 2 transition is greatly reduced by a tiny Vub CKM matrix element and can be safely neglected in the analysis of the <b>box</b> <b>diagram</b> contribution to ∆mD (the inclusion of the b-quark further decreases the <b>box</b> <b>diagram</b> contribution [1]). This forces the vanishing of the effect in the SU(3) limit and implies that only the light quark mass difference guarantees that mixing does take place. Calculating a <b>box</b> <b>diagram</b> and constructing the effective Hamiltonian, we realize that the smallness of the short distance piece is guaranteed by a factor of (m 2 s − m 2 d) 2 /m 2 c [2] (we define L = (1 + γ 5) / 2) Heff = G 2 F 2 π 2 ξsξd (m 2 s − m 2 d) 2 m 2 [ūγµLcūγµLc + 2 ūRcūRc c (1) ic Viu.

It is shown to contribute to the short distance piece at the same order of magnitude as the <b>box</b> <b>diagram.</b> Typeset using REVTEX 1 The phenomenon of meson mixing has been studied for a long time. Observed in the K 0 − ¯ K 0 and B 0 − ¯ B 0 systems, it provides an extremely sensitive test of the Standard Model (SM) and essential for the CP violation in the neutral meson system. It is well known that because of the GIM cancellation mechanism and large mass of the top quark the short distance <b>box</b> <b>diagram</b> dominates in B 0 − ¯ B 0 system and constitutes a significant fraction of the K 0 − ¯ K 0 mixing amplitude. The case of D 0 − ¯ D 0 system is somewhat special: the b-quark contribution to the fermion loop of the <b>box</b> <b>diagram</b> providing ∆C = 2 transition is diminished by a tiny Vub CKM matrix element. Thus, only the light quark mass difference guarantees that mixing does take place. The effect vanishes in the limit of the SU(3) invariance.
