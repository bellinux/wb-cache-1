50|$|The Blandford fly (Simulium posticatum) is {{a species}} of black fly, a <b>biting</b> <b>insect</b> found in Europe, Turkey and western Siberia. It spends its larval stage in the weedbeds of slow flowing rivers and when the fly emerges, the female seeks a blood meal before mating. It usually bites the lower legs causing pain, itching and swelling. Scratching the irritated areas can lead to breaks in the skin, after which {{secondary}} infection may set in.|$|E

50|$|These traps are not {{effective}} at killing <b>biting</b> <b>insects</b> (female mosquitoes and other insects), being {{much more effective}} at attracting and killing other harmless and beneficial insects. A study by the University of Delaware showed that over period of 15 summer nights 13,789 insects were killed among six devices. Of those insects killed, only 31 were <b>biting</b> <b>insects.</b> Mosquitoes are attracted to carbon dioxide and water vapor in the breath of mammals, not ultraviolet light. However, there are now bug zappers that emit carbon dioxide or use an external bait, such as octenol, to better attract <b>biting</b> <b>insects</b> into the light.|$|R
50|$|Insect sting allergy is {{the term}} {{commonly}} given to the allergic response of an animal {{in response to the}} bite or sting of an insect. Typically, insects which generate allergic responses are either stinging insects (wasps, bees, hornets and ants) or <b>biting</b> <b>insects</b> (mosquitoes, ticks). Stinging insects inject venom into their victims, whilst <b>biting</b> <b>insects</b> normally introduce anti-coagulants into their victims.|$|R

40|$|Background: Forcipomyia taiwana (biting midge) allergy is {{the most}} {{prevalent}} <b>biting</b> <b>insect</b> allergy in Taiwan. An animal model corresponding to the human immuno-pathologic features of midge allergy is needed for investigating the mechanisms and therapies. This study successfully developed a murine model of Forcipomyia taiwana allergy. Methods: BALB/c mice were sensitized intra-peritoneally with midge extract on days 0, 7, 14, 21 then intra-dermally on days 28, 31 and 35. Serum midge-specific IgE, IgG 1, and IgG 2 a were measured every 14 days by indirect ELISA. The mice were challenged intradermally with midge extract at day 40 and then sacrificed. Proliferation and cytokine production of splenocytes after stimulation with midge extract were determined by MTT assay and ELISA, respectively. The cytokine mRNA expression in response to midge stimulation was analyzed by RT-PCR. Results: Serum IgE, total IgG, and IgG 1 antibody levels against midge extract were significantly higher in the midge-sensitized mice than in the control mice. After the two-step sensitization, all mice in the midge-sensitized group displayed immediate itch and plasma extravasation reactions in response to challenge with midge extract. Skin histology from midge-sensitized mice showed marked eosinophil and lymphocyte infiltrations similar to that observed in humans. Stimulation of murine splenocytes with midge extract elicited significant proliferation, IL- 4, IL- 10, IL- 13 and IFN-c protein production, and up-regulation of mRNA in a dose-dependent manner in the midge-sensitized group, {{but not in the}} control group...|$|E
