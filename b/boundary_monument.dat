A consideration of these policies is necessary for a reasoned approach to judging the admissibility and weight of evidence needed to prove a <b>boundary</b> <b>monument.</b> San Juan County v. Ayer illustrates the confusion which can result when a court attempts to apply these rules in a technical manner divorced from their historical background. Many boundary disputes could properly be resolved by using the rule of monument control as a rule of construction, thereby allowing the court to weigh the equities of the dispute before it, rather than as a rule of law to be contrasted with the Statute of Frauds...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to develop}} operational methodologies in integrating cadastral data into the Philippine Plane Coordinate System – Transverse Mercator / Philippine Reference System (PPCS-TM/PRS 92) through evaluation of different methods of data conversion and transformation in five (5) municipal cadastres.

The execution of the developed methodologies for each of the tasks resulted in findings which includes quality issues in the cadastral data and survey of some approved cadastre which do not permit effective cadastral transformation; severity of problem in the cadastral data record system which causes damage and lost of cadastral survey records necessary for the data build-up, transformation, and integration; and difficulty of integrating adjacent cadastral projects caused by unreliable <b>boundary</b> <b>monument</b> positioning.

40|$|Abstract. Theunited States-Mexico {{international}} boundary from El Paso, Texas to the Pacific Coast shows clear differences in plant communities that were homogeneous {{prior to being}} split by a continuous fence {{at the turn of}} the century. This study evaluates how disparate fire regimes in California (fire suppression) and northern Baja California (little or no fire control) have influenced succession in the chamise (Adenostoma fasciculatum) chaparral communities spanning the {{international boundary}} between the border towns of JacumC and Tecate. Fire history was reconstructed using U. S. Forest Service fire maps and repeat aerial photography. Once plotted onto topographic maps and dated, the bums were divided into age-classes and sampled using 50 m point-quarter transects to develop successional chronosequences. Although fires are more frequent and smaller on the Mexican side of the border, our repeat photographs of the <b>boundary</b> <b>monument</b> markers together with field samples show that chaparral succession is similar across the international boundary in species composition, stem densities, and average mass shrub height. Chamisechaparral appears to be stable under disparate fire regimes because sprouting habits and latent seed pools permit efficient stand establishment under either short or long fire intervals. Chaparral recovery during the period examined here is unrelated to fire size because recolonization of bums by longrange seed dispersal is not a trait of the majority of the local shrub species and the shrubs either resprout or germinate from soil seed reservoirs...|$|E

60|$|The {{stranger}} {{had turned}} into a deserted lane still cushioned with untrodden snow. A stone wall on one hand--in better keeping and condition than the <b>boundary</b> <b>monuments</b> of the outlying fields--bespoke protection and exclusiveness. Half-way up the lane the rider checked his speed, and, dismounting, tied his horse to a wayside sapling. This done, he went cautiously forward {{toward the end of the}} lane, and a farm-house from whose gable window a light twinkled through the deepening night. Suddenly he stopped, hesitated, and uttered an impatient ejaculation. The light had disappeared. He turned sharply on his heel, and retraced his steps until opposite a farm-shed that stood a few paces from the wall. Hard by, a large elm cast the gaunt shadow of its leafless limbs on the wall and surrounding snow. The stranger stepped into this shadow, and at once seemed to become a part of its trembling intricacies.|$|R
