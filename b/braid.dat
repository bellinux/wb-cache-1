40|$|Abstract: Considering {{that there}} were very a few {{varieties}} of 3 D <b>braided</b> materials at present, some novel 3 D <b>braided</b> geometry structures were derived based on symmetry group theory. Group theory {{was used for the}} first time to describe the 3 D <b>braided</b> geometry structures was discussed. The whole analyzing procedure from the existing <b>braided</b> geometry structure to the <b>braided</b> symmetry group was described in detail. It is found that because the reflection operation does not exist in some point groups and space groups of <b>braided</b> structure and some odd lattices appeared, the <b>braided</b> symmetry group is not always the same as symmetry groups of crystallographic. The representative volume element of 3 D <b>braided</b> geometry structure was deduced from <b>braided</b> space point group, and 3 D <b>braided</b> geometry structure was obtained from <b>braided</b> space group. 3 D <b>braided</b> geometry structures can not only be classified based on <b>braided</b> group theory, but some of novel 3 D <b>braided</b> structures can be deduced through the group's symmetry operators. It is proved that some novel 3 D <b>braided</b> processes are feasible. <b>Braided</b> symmetry theory is an effective mathematical method for developing more and rational 3 D <b>braided</b> materials.

The latter is obtained by a specific elaborated construction introducing a <b>braided</b> tensor algebra functor as a left adjoint of the forgetful functor from the category of <b>braided</b> algebras to the one of <b>braided</b> objects.

40|$|International audienceWe use {{physical}} {{experiments to}} investigate the response of submarine <b>braided</b> channels driven by saline density currents to increasing inflow discharge and bed slope. We find that, similarly to <b>braided</b> rivers, {{only a fraction of}} submarine <b>braided</b> networks have active sediment transport. We then find similar response to imposed change between submarine and fluvial <b>braided</b> systems: (1) both the active and total <b>braiding</b> intensities increase with increasing discharge and slope; (2) the ratio of active <b>braiding</b> intensity to total <b>braiding</b> intensity is 0. 5 in submarine <b>braided</b> systems regardless of discharge and slope; and (3) the active <b>braiding</b> intensity scales linearly with dimensionless stream power. Thus, <b>braided</b> submarine channels and <b>braided</b> rivers are similar in some important aspects of their behavior and responses to changes in stream power and bed slope. In light of the scale independence of <b>braided</b> channel planform organization, these results are likely to apply beyond experimental scales...|$|R

5|$|Originally {{announced}} in 2009, The Witness had a lengthy development period. Blow started {{work on the}} title in 2008 shortly after releasing <b>Braid.</b> The financial success of <b>Braid</b> allowed him to hire a larger production team without ceding control over the final product. In order to create the game's visual language, the team developed their own game engine and retained artists, architects, and landscape architects to design the structures on the island. This required a protracted development process, and the game's release was delayed from 2013 to 2016. Original plans for release on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 were abandoned as the game engine became more demanding, and the team ultimately opted for an initial release on Windows and the PlayStation 4, with support for other platforms following.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Braided</b> bialgebras {{were defined}} by {{mimicking}} {{the definition of}} bialgebras in a <b>braided</b> category; see [Ta]. In this paper {{we are interested in}} those <b>braided</b> bialgebras that are connected as a coalgebra, and such that, up to multiplication by a certain scalar, their <b>braiding</b> restricted to the primitive part is a Hecke operator. To every <b>braided</b> bialgebra as above we associate a <b>braided</b> Lie algebra. Conversely, for each <b>braided</b> Lie algebra we construct a <b>braided</b> bialgebra, namely its enveloping algebra. <b>Braided</b> symmetric and exterior algebras are examples of enveloping algebras (they correspond to a trivial Lie bracket). We show many of the properties of ordinary enveloping algebras still hold in the <b>braided</b> case: the graded associated (with respect to the standard filtration) is a <b>braided</b> symmetric algebra; the coalgebra counterpart is isomorphic to the coalgebra structure of a <b>braided</b> symmetric algebra; the coradical filtration and the standard filtration are identical. As in the classical case, <b>braided</b> symmetric and exterior algebras are Koszul algebras. The proof of this fact is based on a new characterization of Koszul algebras. These properties are used to prove a Milnor-Moore type theorem for infinitesimally cocommutative connected <b>braided</b> bialgebras (see Theorem 5. 5). We apply our result to three different classes of <b>braided</b> bialgebras: connected bialgebras in the category of comodules over a coquasitriangular cosemisimple Hopf algebra (e. g. superbialgebras and enveloping algebras o...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{development}} of <b>braided</b> reinforced composite rods as a substitute for the steel reinforcement in concrete. The research work aims at understanding the mechanical behaviour of core-reinforced <b>braided</b> fabrics and <b>braided</b> reinforced composite rods, namely concerning the influence of the <b>braiding</b> angle, the type of core reinforcement fibre, and preloading and postloading conditions. The core-reinforced <b>braided</b> fabrics were made from polyester fibres for producing <b>braided</b> structures, and E-glass, carbon, HT polyethylene, and sisal fibres were used for the core reinforcement.

5|$|<b>Braid</b> was {{originally}} {{developed as a}} Windows title with possible console versions, though Blow was not committed to releasing either a PC or console version first. Blow signed up with Microsoft to release the game on Xbox Live in mid-2007, with that version officially announced at the 2007 Tokyo Game Show. Blow was critical of the Xbox Live certification process, as he believed the effort to meet all the requirements could have been better spent on polishing the game. At the same time, the certification team allowed him to retain certain aspects of his vision for the game that were otherwise contrary to the process, including giving the player immediate control of the game instead of requiring a start-up title screen. Microsoft also requested that Blow include some additional hints to the player based on results of playtesting, but Blow held his ground, refusing to release the game if {{he was forced to}} add these. He said he would likely not release a game again on the Xbox Live service under the same business model. Blow later released a <b>Braid</b> theme for Xbox Live; though he wanted to release this theme for free, Microsoft required the theme to be priced at a nominal level.|$|E

30|$|<b>Braiding</b> is {{a method}} used to {{interweave}} two or more fibre yarns to produce textile composites. The angle between the longitudinal direction of a <b>braided</b> preform and bias yarns is generally defined as <b>braiding</b> angle θ; it ranges typically from 15 ° to 75 °. Both two-dimensional (2 D) and three-dimensional (3 D) <b>braided</b> architectures can be fabricated in many ways, such as two-step or four-step method of rectangular <b>braiding,</b> tri-axial <b>braiding,</b> circular <b>braiding,</b> and other displacement <b>braiding</b> techniques (Bilisik 2012). The main feature of a <b>braided</b> method is its flexibility to achieve variable geometric shapes with high volumes of parts in a cost-effective way. Thanks to the unique undulations of the <b>braided</b> structure, macro cracks have no clear path to grow in epoxy matrix, and their propagation can be arrested at inter-sections of yarns. As a result, <b>braided</b> textile composites enjoy higher fracture toughness, structural stability and better damage tolerance compared to pre-preg and laminated composites (Mouritz et al. 1999). With their high stiffness-to-weight and strength-to-weight ratios, <b>braided</b> composites are attractive materials for aerospace and automotive components as well as sports protective equipment (Ayranci and Carey 2008).|$|R
