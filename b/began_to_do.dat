The Nimrod was a replacement for the Shackleton and it <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so on 2 October 1969. However, less than eight weeks later, Coastal Command was disbanded and ceased to exist on 27 November 1969, when it was subsumed into RAF Strike Command.|$|E

By the time Dickinson began to compile her writing into book format she had become established in her career and resided in Los Angeles, California with her two children. She started formally putting her notes together into a book after successfully gaining sobriety.|$|E
5|$|The {{events of}} the Fishing Creek Confederacy were widely covered in both Democratic and Republican newspapers.

5|$|With {{the passage}} of the Pittman Act in 1918, the United States Mint was {{required}} to strike millions of silver dollars, and <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so in 1921, using the Morgan dollar design. Numismatists began to lobby the Mint to issue a coin that memorialized the peace following World War I; although they failed to get Congress to pass a bill requiring the redesign, they were able to persuade government officials to take action. The Peace dollar was approved by Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon in December 1921, completing the redesign of United States coinage that had begun in 1907.|$|E
5|$|In 1780, {{approximately}} 5,500 French soldiers {{landed in}} Rhode Island to assist their American allies in operations against British-controlled New York City. Following {{the arrival of}} dispatches from France that included the possibility {{of support from the}} French West Indies fleet of the Comte de Grasse, Washington and Rochambeau decided to ask de Grasse for assistance either in besieging New York, or in military operations against a British army operating in Virginia. On the advice of Rochambeau, de Grasse informed them of his intent to sail to the Chesapeake Bay, where Cornwallis had taken command of the army. Cornwallis, at first given confusing orders by his superior officer, Henry Clinton, was eventually ordered to build a defensible deep-water port, which he <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in Yorktown, Virginia. Cornwallis' movements in Virginia were shadowed by a Continental Army force led by the Marquis de Lafayette.|$|E

He then <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> paperwork, paying no attention to the continuing match, and was not made aware that play was continuing until a spectator got his attention by striking his window with an empty beer can. He then sounded the siren a second time, just after Baker's first kick for goal.|$|E
25|$|By this point, the Arabs {{appeared}} to the Romans as invincible, and thus, could only hinder themselves. Fortunately for Byzantium, the Arabs <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> just that. The Caliph Uthman ibn Affan {{was assassinated in}} Medina. As a result, Ali, the Islamic Prophet Muhammed's son-in law was elected as his successor. However, Muawiya, the governor of Syria who led the Arab fleet against Byzantium, was proclaimed Caliph in Syria, as well. Only when Ali was assassinated in 661 did the civil strife end, much to Byzantium's disappointment.|$|E

While it is reported that he began this work after Kirkpatrick's death on 19 May 1915, he was photographed with a donkey carrying a wounded man on 12 May 1915 by Sergeant James Gardiner Jackson.

25|$|In {{the latter}} half of the 19th century, San Francisco saw {{administrative}} graft, boss politics, and a persistent lawlessness. For a while after the hangings of Whittaker and McKenzie, San Francisco functioned as a law-abiding city. The hangings frightened corrupt judges and government officials, who then <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> their duties with a rare diligence, not seen so far in San Francisco. This new competency in government would not last long, and by 1852 corrupt government officials developed a system of high salaries and expensive projects with political kickbacks that would drain the city's treasury to near bankruptcy. This financial crisis at city hall would create a great strain on commerce and also affect individual businesses.|$|E
25|$|The {{plan was}} carried out {{on the night of}} August 1. Mu'izz al-Dawla led a number of men north, instructing them to light torches and blast {{trumpets}} along the way. The Hamdanid army, seeing his movements, moved north as well to prevent him from crossing the river. Saymari and his soldiers were therefore free to cross to the eastern side and <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. When the Hamdanid army realized what was happening, they sent a number of men in zabzabs to stop him, and a fierce fight broke out. Eventually the Dailamites were victorious and the Hamdanid forces were pushed back to the Shammasiyyah gate at the northeastern corner of the city.|$|E
25|$|The Jardín del Arte Sullivan (literally Sullivan Garden of Art) is {{an outdoor}} art market {{which takes place}} every Sunday near the {{historic}} center of Mexico City in a neighborhood called Colonia San Rafael. This market began in the 1950s, when young artists who could not show their works in traditional galleries and shows decided to set {{up in front of}} their studios and in local parks to exhibit and sell their work. A number <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so {{at the base of the}} Monumento a la Madre (Monument to Mothers) at Sullivan Park and in 1959, the Asociación Jardín del Arte, a non profit civil association was established affiliated with the Instituto Nacional de la Juventud Mexicana. Since then the market has shown works by a number of artists who moved on to better things such as Rodolfo Morales, established a second and third art market in the San Ángel neighborhood and has grown to 700 members. However, the original San Rafael neighborhood has deteriorated since the 1950s, and this has had a negative impact on the original Jardín del Arte.|$|E
