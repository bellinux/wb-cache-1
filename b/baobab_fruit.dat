Results showed high variability in biochemical characteristics and mineral content between the five Malagasy species and the Sudano-Sahelian species.

40|$|International audienceIntroduction. Very {{characteristic}} of Sahelian areas, Adansonia digitata L. {{belongs to the}} Bombacaceae family. Essentially exploited in a spontaneous state for its fruits or its leaves, the baobab {{plays an important role}} in the local traditional cultures. The plant. This very big tree is clearly distinguishable from the other Adansonia species endemic in Madagascar and Australia, mainly by its very large trunk (up to 10 m in diameter), its pendular flowers and its rounded crown. It produces (150 to 300) g dry berries with a woody epicarp, most of the time ovoid, called “monkey bread”. These fruits contain many seeds in a whitish and floury pulp. The compounded leaves consist of five to seven digitate leaflets. The baobab distribution area is very large. Very rustic, it is found in most of South Sahara's semi-arid and sub-humid regions as well as in the west side of Madagascar. The plant phenology depends on the rains profile, flowering and foliation occurring during the rainy season. Pollination is done by bats. The tree can be propagated by seeding or vegetative multiplication. The fruit. It consists of (14 to 28) % of pulp with a low moisture content, acidic, starchy, rich in vitamin C, in calcium and magnesium. After separating of the seeds, the pulp is traditionally used as an ingredient in various preparations or to make beverages. In spite of some deficiency in lysine and the presence of some anti-nutritional factors, the seeds are an interesting protein source. They contain about 15 % of lipids. After cooking or grilling, they are either directly consumed or used like thickeners in powder form. The leaves. They are rich in vitamins (especially C and A) and in iron, and contain mucilage (10 % dm). The youngest can be consumed as vegetables, but they are often dried and then reduced into powder. Conclusion. Among the food products obtained from the <b>baobab,</b> the <b>fruit</b> pulp seems to have the strongest economic potential. Nevertheless, the local markets have to be evaluated. The development of the production of <b>baobab</b> <b>fruits</b> needs more investigation into the agronomy of the tree...|$|R

50|$|Hadza men usually forage individually, {{and during}} the course of day usually feed {{themselves}} while foraging, and also bring home some honey, fruit, or wild game when available. Women forage in larger parties, and usually bring home berries, <b>baobab</b> <b>fruit</b> http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0002106, and tubers, depending on availability. Men and women also forage cooperatively for honey and fruit, and at least one adult male will usually accompany a group of foraging women. During the wet season, the diet is composed mostly of honey, some fruit, tubers, and occasional meat. The contribution of meat to the diet increases in the dry season, when game become concentrated around sources of water. During this time, men often hunt in pairs, and spend entire nights lying in wait by waterholes, hoping to shoot animals that approach for a night-time drink, with bows and arrows treated with poison. The poison is made of the branches of the shrub Adenium coetaneum. The Hadza are highly skilled, selective, and opportunistic foragers, and adjust their diet according to season and circumstance. Depending on local availability, some groups might rely more heavily on tubers, others on berries, others on meat. This variability is the result of their opportunism and adjustment to prevailing conditions.|$|E

30|$|Baobab is {{the common}} name of the trees of a genus (Adansonia digitate), meaning hand-like, in {{reference}} to the shape of the leaves. The tree grows in abundance in Malawi and is found to be widely distributed in the southern region of Malawi, lakeshore region in the central and the northern regions. The baobab tree is very important for humans and animals in the arid regions of Malawi because it can provide shelter, food, clothing and water for the animals and inhabitants of that region (Anchez 2011). Many animals feed on its leaves, flowers and fruits. The fruit, which grows up to a foot long, contains tartaric acid and vitamin C and can either be sucked, or soaked in water to make a refreshing drink. They can also be roasted and ground up to make a coffee-like drink. In Mangochi and surrounding areas, where baobab trees are in abundance, the <b>baobab</b> <b>fruits</b> are collected from the trees and sold to vendors who sell them further to individuals or commercial companies for the production of fruit juice or fruit pulp powder. The fruit shell is a waste produced when the ovoid fruits of the tree are removed from the powdery white flesh seeds. As far as the authors are aware, there is currently no any commercial use for the shells and as such they are often discarded wantonly around the harvesting areas and around the factory’s sites, thereby littering the environment.|$|R

3000|$|The {{study has}} {{demonstrated}} {{the possibility of}} developing low-cost activated carbon from cheap and abundantly available Malawian <b>baobab</b> <b>fruit</b> shells and its potential as an effective adsorbent {{for the removal of}} copper ions from water and wastewater. The textural properties of the synthesized activated carbon are highly competitive to commercial activated carbon. Results showed that a pyrolysis temperature of 700  °C was the optimum pyrolysis condition to prepare carbon with maximum BET surface area, total pore volume and micropore volume of 1089  m 2 /g, 0.4330  cm 3 /g and 0.3764  cm 3 /g, respectively. At this temperature, the material was faster to release volatile matters from the char to increase the specific surface area and the microporous volume. Thus, the carbon prepared at activation 700  °C showed excellent physicochemical properties than the other carbons (prepared at different temperatures) and was used as optimized sample in this study. The adsorption of copper onto <b>baobab</b> <b>fruit</b> shell-derived activated carbon (optimized sample) depends on factors such as pH, concentration of metal ions, contact time, adsorbent dosage, and temperature. The adsorption process revealed that the initial uptake was rapid and equilibrium was attained in about 75  min. The adsorption data fitted well into Langmuir isotherm model with a maximum adsorption capacity of 3.0833  mg/g. The separation factor, [...] R_L, lies in between 0 and 1, indicating a favourable adsorption of copper from aqueous solution. Kinetic study shows that pseudo-second-order kinetic model fitted the adsorption process best. Cost analysis revealed that <b>baobab</b> <b>fruit</b> shell-derived activated carbon is cheaper than the commercially available activated carbon. Overall, the material (baobab tree) is not only economical but the fruit shell is an agricultural waste product. Thus, activated carbon prepared from <b>baobab</b> <b>fruit</b> shells would be useful for the economic treatment of wastewater containing some heavy metals ions such as copper metal ions because of its outstanding adsorption capacity, low-cost, non-toxic and biocompatibility. Based on the above findings, {{it is obvious that the}} <b>baobab</b> <b>fruit</b> shell-derived AC could be used as sorbent for the removal of other divalent metal ions such as Zn(II), Pb(II), Cd(II) and Ni(II), etc. from wastewater.|$|E

The sample activated at 700  °C was chosen as our optimized sample because its physicochemical properties and BET results were similar to those of a commercial sample. The N 2 -adsorption–desorption results of the optimized sample revealed a BET surface area of 1089  m 2 /g, micropore volume of 0.3764  cm 3 /g, total pore volume of 0.4330  cm 3 /g and pore size of 1.45  nm. Operational parameters such as pH, initial copper concentration, contact time, adsorbent dosage and temperature were studied in a batch mode. Equilibrium data were obtained by testing the adsorption data using three different isotherm models: Langmuir, Freundlich and Dubinin–Radushkevish (D–R) models.

The study showed that all the dietary inclusion are satisfactory as feed for small ruminant without any deleterious effect on performance and blood profile. Inclusion level of 20 % baobab appeared to have better overall performance when fed to red sokoto goat...|$|E
30|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that a wide range of indigenous fruit trees have the potential to provide rural households with a means to meet their nutritional and medicinal needs (Ekesa et al. 2009). In the past decades several reports have been published on the nutritional composition of wild fruits and vegetables growing in different areas in various African countries and on the effect they could have on combating malnutrition and poverty in the continent (FAO 2011). In June 2008, the European Commission authorised the placing on the market of dried pulp of one wild <b>fruit,</b> <b>Baobab</b> (Adansonia digitata), as a novel food ingredient (Commission Decision 2008). Three components are of special importance for determining whether such ingredients are health-enhancing: the kind and amount of minerals, organic acids and dietary fiber.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this study was to prepare and {{formulated}} ready to use snack meal (paste) for school children from some local Sudanese common fruits, mango (Mangifera indica); forest <b>fruits,</b> <b>baobab</b> (Adansonia digitata) and godeim (Grewia tenax); also, vegetables, pumpkin (Telfairia occidentalis). In addition, the physico-chemical properties, storage stability and sensory quality of the product was evaluated. The results showed that the fruit paste contains high level of protein (19. 36 %), carbohydrates (64. 25 %), vitamin C (575. 06 mg/ 100 g) and energy value (365. 24 kcal). The fruit paste is containing abundant amounts of potassium and magnesium, excellent quantities of iron, calcium and phosphorous, while, its poor source for sodium for school age children from 4 - 17 years. The product is kindly stable during storage for 12 months at ambient temperature. However, the product is acceptable for sensory attributes as compare to control sample...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} the {{physical}} and thermal properties of <b>baobab</b> (Adansonia digitata) <b>fruit</b> pulp powder which are essential for designing engineering processes, material handling, storage, equipment design and fabrication were determined. The physical properties, namely, mean particle size, bulk density, true density and porosity were determined. Also, angle of repose and coefficient of friction were tested on mild steel, plywood and PVC plastic which are probable engineering materials for construction of food processing equipment. The specific heat capacity, thermal diffusivity and thermal conductivity were also determined. The mean particle size of the powder was 0. 953 mm, while the bulk density, true density and porosity {{were found to be}} 301 kg/m 3, 1167 kg/m 3 and 73 %, respectively. The angle of repose and coefficients of static friction of the fruit pulp powder were found to be 40. 63 o and 0. 8339, 39. 18 o and 0. 7796, 37. 28 o and 0. 7501, respectively for mild steel, plywood and PVC plastic surfaces. The specific heat capacity and thermal conductivity decreased with increase in temperature, while thermal diffusivity increased from 1. 217 × 10 - 5 to 2. 341 × 10 - 5 m 2 /s within the temperature range of 40 and 60 o C...|$|R
