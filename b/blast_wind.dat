50|$|Blast waves {{cause damage}} by a {{combination}} of the significant compression of the air in front of the wave (forming a shock front) and the subsequent wind that follows. A blast wave travels faster than the speed of sound and the passage of the shock wave usually only lasts a few milliseconds. Like other types of explosions, a blast wave can also cause damage to things and people by the <b>blast</b> <b>wind,</b> debris, and fires. The original explosion will send out fragments that travel very fast. Debris and sometimes even people can get swept up into a blast wave, causing more injuries such as penetrating wounds, impalement, broken bones, or even death. The <b>blast</b> <b>wind</b> is the area of low pressure that causes debris and fragments to actually rush back towards the original explosions. The blast wave can also cause fires or even secondary explosions {{by a combination}} of the high temperatures that result from detonation and the physical destruction of fuel-containing objects.|$|E

50|$|A {{blast wave}} in fluid {{dynamics}} is {{the pressure and}} flow resulting from the deposition of {{a large amount of}} energy in a small very localised volume. The flow field can be approximated as a lead shock wave, followed by a 'self-similar' subsonic flow field. In simpler terms, a blast wave is an area of pressure expanding supersonically outward from an explosive core. It has a leading shock front of compressed gases. The blast wave is followed by a <b>blast</b> <b>wind</b> of negative pressure, which sucks items back in towards the center. The blast wave is harmful especially when one is very close to the center or at a location of constructive interference. High explosives, which detonate, generate blast waves.|$|E

30|$|Although {{the rate}} of primary blast injury (damage caused by blast waves) has {{historically}} been {{lower than that of}} secondary blast injury (damage caused by projectiles propelled by <b>blast</b> <b>wind),</b> this rate is currently approaching that of secondary blast injury.

One explanation for why the clinical importance of BLI in warfare has been increasing is the increased prevalence of personal body armor for soldiers capable of protecting against secondary, but not primary, blast injuries [6, 7, 22]. In civilian settings, terrorists tend to set bombs in confined spaces, such as trains, busses or buildings in order to magnify the duration and range of blast waves by forcing energy to rebound off surfaces [1, 5 – 7, 9, 20, 23].|$|E

40|$|Blast {{exposure}} {{is associated with}} traumatic brain injury (TBI), neuropsychiatric symptoms, and long-term cognitive disability. We examined a case series of postmortem brains from U. S. military veterans exposed to blast and/or concussive injury. We found evidence of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a tau protein-linked neurodegenerative disease, that {{was similar to the}} CTE neuropathology observed in young amateur American football players and a professional wrestler with histories of concussive injuries. We developed a blast neurotrauma mouse model that recapitulated CTE-linked neuropathology in wild-type C 57 BL/ 6 mice 2 weeks after exposure to a single blast. Blast-exposed mice demonstrated phosphorylated tauopathy, myelinated axonopathy, microvasculopathy, chronic neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration in the absence of macroscopic tissue damage or hemorrhage. Blast exposure induced persistent hippocampal-dependent learning and memory deficits that persisted fo r at least 1 month and correlated with impaired axonal conduction and defective activity-dependent long-term potentiation of synaptic transmission. Intracerebral pressure recordings demonstrated that shockwaves traversed the mouse brain with minimal change and without thoracic contributions. Kinematic analysis revealed blast-induced head oscillation at accelerations sufficient to cause brain injury. Head immobilization during blast exposure prevented blast-induced learning andmemory deficits. The contribution of <b>blast</b> <b>wind</b> to injurious head acceleration may be a primary injury mechanism leading to blast-related TBI and CTE. These results identify common pathogenic determinants leading to CTE in blast-exposed military veterans and head-injured athletes and additionally provide mechanistic evidence linking blast exposure to persistent impairments in neurophysiological function, learning, and memory...|$|E
40|$|Since the terroristic {{attacks in}} 2001, {{a lot of}} {{important}} government buildings, embassies and critical public infrastructure (railway stations, airports) are protected against blast load. Most of these buildings have standard glazing with float glass, and replacing all float glass with tempered or laminated glass would be too expensive. Therefore the glass windows are retrofitted with safety film, a thermoplastic polyester film that sticks to the glass and holds all glass fragments together when the glass is breaking. These safety films are also applied as protection against hurricanes and burglary. As the exact physical mechanisms {{of the interaction between}} glass and safety film are not understood quite well, research is conducted on the assembly of float glass retrofitted with safety film. Also the adhesive between glass and safety film plays a big role, as well as the tin and air side of the glass. Because the loadings on the glass/film assembly are typically dynamic (<b>blast,</b> <b>wind</b> pressure, impact), the lab tests are done on a drop weight set-up, where a mass is falling on the glass plate, retrofitted with safety film. In this paper, the instrumentation of the drop weight setup with projection moire measurement is presented, so that the time history of the out-of-plane deformations of the glass/film assembly can be investigated. On {{the back side of the}} specimen a high intensity infrared grating was projected and the whole process was recorded by a high speed camera. For the processing of the projected moire fringes, dedicated phase wrapping algorithms were needed because the fracturing of the glass causes a lot of discontinuities in the phase. Local routines based on Fast Fourier Transform were used to process the captured images, and to extract the phase. The exact out-of-plane displacements were calculated by means of calibration based on previous shape measurements of several different objects with known dimensions...|$|E
40|$|The main {{shock of}} the 2015 Gorkha Earthquake in Nepal induced {{numerous}} avalanches, rockfalls, and landslides in Himalayan mountain regions. A major village in the Langtang Valley was destroyed and numerous people were victims of a catastrophic avalanche event, which consisted of snow, ice, rock, and <b>blast</b> <b>wind.</b> Understanding the hazard process mainly depends on limited witness accounts, interviews, and an in situ survey after a monsoon season. To record the immediate situation and to understand the deposition process, we performed an assessment by means of satellite-based observations carried out no later than 2 weeks after the event. The avalanche-induced sediment deposition was delineated with the calculation of decreasing coherence and visual interpretation of amplitude images acquired from the Phased Array-type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar- 2  (PALSAR- 2). These outline areas are highly consistent with that delineated from a high-resolution optical image of WorldView- 3  (WV- 3). The delineated sediment areas were estimated as 0. 63  km 2  (PALSAR- 2 coherence calculation), 0. 73  km 2  (PALSAR- 2 visual interpretation), and 0. 88  km 2  (WV- 3). In the WV- 3 image, surface features were classified into 10  groups. Our analysis suggests that the avalanche event contained a sequence of (1)  a fast splashing body with an air blast, (2)  a huge, flowing muddy mass, (3)  less mass flowing from another source, (4)  a smaller amount of splashing and flowing mass, and (5)  splashing mass without flowing on {{the east and west}} sides.

40|$|Although {{there is}} a {{significant}} literature on the philosophy of Jacques Derrida, there are few analyses that address the deconstructive critique of phenomenology as it simultaneously plays across range of cultural productions including literature, painting, cinema, new media, and the structure of the university. Using the critical figures of 'ghost' and 'shadow'-and initiating a vocabulary of phantomenology-this book traces the implications of Derridean 'spectrality' on the understanding of contemporary thought, culture, and experience. This study examines the interconnections of philosophy, art in its many forms, and the hauntology of Jacques Derrida. Exposure is explored primarily as exposure to the elemental weather (with culture serving as a lean-to); exposure in a photographic sense; being over-exposed to light; exposure to the certitude of death; and being exposed to all the possibilities of the world. Exposure, in sum, is a kind of necessary, dangerous, and affirmative openness. The book weaves together three threads in order to format an image of the contemporary exposure: 1) a critique of the philosophy of appearances, with phenomenology and its vexed relationship to idealism as the primary representative of this enterprise; 2) an analysis of cultural formations-literature, cinema, painting, the university, new media-that highlights the enigmatic necessity for learning to read a spectrality that, since the two cannot be separated, is both hauntological and historical; and 3) a questioning of the role of art-as semblance, reflection, and remains-that occurs within and alongside the space of philosophy and of the all the 'posts-' in which people find themselves. Art is understood fundamentally as a spectral aesthetics, as a site that projects from an exposed place toward an exposed, and therefore open, future, from a workplace that testifies to the <b>blast</b> <b>wind</b> of obliteration, but also in that very testimony gives a place for ghosts to gather, to speak {{with each other and with}} humankind. Art, which installs itself in the very heart of the ancient dream of philosophy as its necessary companion, ensures that each phenomenon is always a phantasm and thus we can be assured that the apparitions will continue to speak in what Michel Serres's has called the 'grotto of miracles. ' This book, then, enacts the slowness of a reading of spectrality that unfolds in the chiaroscuro of truth and illusion, philosophy and art, light and darkness.

40|$|Traumatic {{brain injury}} (TBI) {{is a common}} cause of {{mortality}} and morbidity among civilians and servicemen alike. The spectrum of TBIs encompasses mild to severe cases, with the predominate number of TBIs being mild (mTBI). Combat-related TBI inflicted by explosive blast (bTBI) is highly prevalent among military personnel. The injurious environment caused by explosive blast includes the high-energy shock wave that dissipates energy at the boundaries of anatomical structures with distinct acoustical impedance, and the <b>blast</b> <b>wind</b> that can propel the body resulting in acceleration/ deceleration type of injury. mTBI can also occur in the civilian population often {{as a result of}} contact sports and because of the mild acute symptoms it is often repeated. mTBI causes transient mood and cognitive changes, but it may also increase the risk for late onset chronic neurodegenerative conditions such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Little is known about the mechanism of mTBI and its post-sequelae. Monoamine projections from the brainstem {{play a key role in}} modulating the forebrain regions, and galanin, a neuropeptide that, in the rat, is co-localised with two of these key neurotransmitters. Dysfunctions in these systems have been associated with mood/anxiety disorders. In this thesis we set out to examine changes in the monoamine and galanin systems following single and repeated blast exposure, in male and female rats. mTBI was induced using an experimental blast tube which uses real explosives. For one of the studies a shock tube that uses compressed air was also used to produce a blast-induced mTBI (mbTBI). The models appeared to cause mbTBI, given that no injury was observed when staining for degeneration, blood vessel damage, or disruption to the white matter tracts in either model, following single or repeated exposure. The noradrenaline (NA) system was found to be particularly sensitive to mbTBI. The transcript levels of the biosynthetic enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) were found elevated immediately post-exposure bilaterally in the locus coeruleus (LC) in both males and females. This was concurrent with a transient increase in NA levels in a number of forebrain regions, and translated into decreased immobility in the forced swim test. This was only explored in the males and using the blast tube. Sex-specific differences were found in the serotonin system (5 -HT). Here the transcript levels of the biosynthetic enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH 2), were elevated across the mid/caudal-rostral dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) in females. The elevation occurred acutely post-TBI and remained even after day (D) 7, the last time point evaluated. In the males TPH 2 was similarly elevated, but more modestly and only transiently. The increase was limited to only the mid/caudal part of the DRN, and by D 3 TPH 2 levels were similar to levels detected in sham animals. No changes in 5 -HT levels were seen in the forebrain regions of male rats. Exposure induced changes in the expression of galanin and its receptors were also examined by in situ hybridisation but in males only. Galanin mRNA levels increased bilaterally in the LC and gradually in the mid/caudal, but not in the rostral DRN and remained elevated, even at D 7 in both nuclei [...] However, quantitative polymerase chain reaction only confirmed the acute galanin increase in the LC, and in addition revealed galanin transcripts in the hippocampus. In terms of the galanin receptor 1 - 3 (GalR 1 - 3), GalR 1 was increased in the ventral periaqueductal grey and this increase persisted at D 7 post-TBI, at this time-point GalR 2 was decreased. In the forebrain regions GalR 3 appeared to be the most dynamic receptor, decreasing in most regions immediately following TBI, and recovering on D 7 post-exposure, except in the ventral hippocampus, where changes persisted. A cumulative effect of repeated exposure to blast was not apparent in the levels of the transcripts for TH, TPH 2, and galanin using either the blast or shock tube in male rodents. Serum analyses revealed sex-specific differences acutely following a single blast exposure, including an increase in corticosterone and substance P in female and decreased BDNF levels in male exposed rats. Taken together, these findings indicate a role for both the monoamine and the galanin systems following blast exposure, these changes appear robust across models and sexes (although some sex-specific differences are apparent). Hence these systems are possibly mediators of post-TBI sequelae and tartargeting the persistent dysfunctions in these systems may bring about therapeutic benefits...|$|E
