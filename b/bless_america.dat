25|$|In 1997, when Irish {{documentary}} filmmaker Alan Gilsenan made God <b>Bless</b> <b>America,</b> {{consisting of}} six American cities {{seen through the}} eyes of six American authors, Hunt was invited to participate. Her participation resulted in Marsha Hunt's Philadelphia. According to Gilsenan, Hunt attributes the success of American democracy and capitalism to the crime of slavery, a crime that must be understood if America is to have peace. Hunt fell in love with Gilsenan and moved to the Wicklow mountains near Dublin with him, where in 1999 she helped him fight colon cancer, drawing on her own experiences with the disease. Hunt is no longer romantically involved with Gilsenan, who has since married and fathered a child, but as of 2008 still sees him.|$|E

2500|$|The pregame show {{currently}} {{performed by}} Auburn's band {{was first introduced}} in 2004, and incorporates elements from previous pregame shows. [...] During {{the first year of}} the new pregame, it was featured several times on ESPN and called [...] "The most entertaining band performance yet." [...] The band enters from the team tunnel underneath the south end zone and performs the pregame fanfare, before marching down the field to War Eagle.

[...] The band will then form an USA set with an American [...] "shield" [...] in the bottom of the S to perform God <b>Bless</b> <b>America</b> and the Star Spangled Banner before continuing on to perform The Horse, Tiger Rag, and some school spirit tunes. Often the end of the National Anthem will incorporate a flyover. On some occasions, the band will also play the Alma Mater between God <b>Bless</b> <b>America</b> and the National Anthem. At the end of pregame the band forms an interlocking AU tunnel through which the football team enters the field. In 2006, the band began to start its pregame performances with a trailer of the band on the video screen, now the AU HD (as of 2007), to warm up the crowds and add to the excitement of the performance.|$|E

2500|$|Though Madison {{argued for}} a large and diverse republic, the writers of the Federalist Papers {{recognized}} {{the need for a}} balance. They wanted a republic diverse enough to prevent faction but with enough commonality to maintain cohesion among the states. In Federalist No. 2, John Jay counted as a <b>blessing</b> that <b>America</b> possessed [...] "one united people—a people descended from the same ancestors, the same language, professing the same religion". Madison himself addresses a limitation of his conclusion that large constituencies will provide better representatives. He notes that if constituencies are too large, the representatives will be [...] "too little acquainted with all their local circumstances and lesser interests". He says that this problem is partly solved by federalism. No matter how large the constituencies of federal representatives, local matters will be looked after by state and local officials with naturally smaller constituencies.|$|R
