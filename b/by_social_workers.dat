2500|$|Opportunities {{for mutual}} aid {{to be found}} in the group {{encounter}} offer the major rationale for the provision of group services <b>by</b> <b>social</b> <b>workers.</b> Gitterman (2006), a social work educator and group work scholar has elaborated on the role of mutual aid in the small group noting that [...] "as members become involved with one another, they develop helping relationships and become invested in each other and in participating in the group" [...] (p.93). The mutual aid processes that unfold help group members [...] "to experience their concerns and life issues as universal," [...] to [...] "reduce isolation and stigma," [...] to [...] "offer and receive help from each other," [...] and to [...] "learn from each other's views, suggestions and challenges" [...] (Gitterman, 2006, p.93).|$|E
2500|$|The early 1980s, {{during the}} {{implementation}} of mandatory reporting laws, saw a large increase in child protection investigations in America, Britain, and other developed countries, along with a heightened public awareness of child abuse. The investigation of incest allegations in California was also changed, with cases led <b>by</b> <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> who used leading and coercive interviewing techniques that had been avoided by police investigators. Such changes in the prosecution of cases of alleged incest resulted {{in an increase in}} confessions by fathers in exchange for plea bargains. Shortly thereafter, some children in child protection cases began making allegations of horrific physical and sexual abuse by caregivers within organized rituals, claiming sexual abuse in Satanic rituals and the use of Satanic symbols. These cases garnered the label [...] "satanic ritual abuse" [...] both in the media and among professionals. Childhood memories of similar abuse began to appear in the psychotherapy sessions of adults.|$|E
2500|$|Some feminist {{critics of}} the SRA diagnoses {{maintained}} that, {{in the course of}} attempting to purge society of evil, the panic of the 1980s and 1990s obscured real child-abuse issues, a concern echoed by Gary Clapton. In England, the SRA panic diverted resources and attention from proven abuse cases; this resulted in a hierarchy of abuse in which SRA was the most serious form, physical and sexual abuse being minimized and/or marginalized, and [...] "mere" [...] physical abuse no longer worthy of intervention. In addition, as criticism of SRA investigation increased, the focus <b>by</b> <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> on SRA resulted in a large loss of credibility to the profession. SRA, with its sensational makeup of many victims abused by many victimizers, ended up robbing the far more common and proven issue of incest of much of its societal significance. The National Center for Abuse and Neglect devised the term [...] "religious abuse" [...] to describe exorcism, poisoning, and drowning of children in non-satanic religious settings in order to avoid confusion with SRA.|$|E
