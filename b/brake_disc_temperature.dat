At elevated temperatures, brake fade may occur, leading to potentially catastrophic brake failure in a vehicle. The heat-dissipating characteristic of a brake disc is a function both of the physical design of the brake disc, and also the brake disc material.

40|$|Advanced driver {{assistance}} systems in {{cars and trucks}} are getting ever more sophisticated {{with an emphasis on}} improving fuel efficiency, safety, and driver convenience. In a few years advanced navigation systems that can provide detailed real-time information about the road ahead are expected to become available. For this reason, it is important to investigate how assistance systems can be improved when this type of information becomes available. In this thesis, the assignment is to improve an existing cruise control algorithm using foundation brakes by integrating information about the road ahead. The goal is that the behavior should resemble that of an experienced truck driver. By doing this, the algorithm assimilates potential energy available in downhill slopes. At the same time, speed conditions must be fulfilled and the brakes should be used in an effective way. An algorithm has been developed that achieves the desired behavior. Before entering a descent, the speed is allowed to drop down to a defined minimum speed. When in the slope, the auxiliary brakes are used continuously while the foundation brakes are used for short periods of time when the speed reaches a defined maximum value. The brakes are controlled so that the vehicle leaves the slope at the maximum allowed speed. In order to avoid brake disc wear and, in worst case, a sudden reduction of the brake capacity, the <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> <b>temperature</b> is monitored. If necessary, the speed is reduced to reduce the utilization rate of the foundation brakes. The results show that the behavior of an experienced driver can be approximated when introducing preview information in to the cruise controller algorithm. It has further been shown that the algorithm has the potential to reduce the foundation brake use with up to 10 % in specific scenarios, compared to an existing cruise controller. The same comparison shows that the developed algorithm assimilates more available energy due to the speed reduction before a slope starts. This is achieved with only small effects on the average speed...|$|E

Depending on the application, {{a wide variety of}} <b>brake</b> <b>discs</b> have been developed, with a multitude of designs, geometries and materials. The <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> materials used for heavy-duty vehicles are still mostly based on traditional grey cast iron, due to its favourable performance and low cost. Gradual improvements of the thermal and mechanical properties of grey cast iron for production of <b>brake</b> <b>discs</b> have been introduced over the years through fine-tuning of the alloying elements. Nevertheless, because of a material behaviour that comprises non-linear elasticity and non-symmetric yield stress in tension and compression, the mechanical properties of grey cast iron are not as well established as those of steel or aluminium alloys. The subject of the present work is {{a better understanding of the}} mechanisms that control the life of cast iron <b>brake</b> <b>discs.</b> In the end, the aim is an enhanced vehicle performance and reduced maintenance costs of heavy-duty vehicles. First, a state of the art survey has been carried out with a review of <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> technology and mechanisms related to <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> life. Second, full-scale brake dynamometer experiments have been carried out and analysed, with <b>brake</b> <b>discs</b> made from eight different grey cast iron alloys, at controlled torque, speed and cooling conditions.

40|$|An {{automobile}} <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> {{system is}} used to perform three basic functions, i. e. to reduce speed of a vehicle, to maintain its speed when travelling downhill and to completely stop the vehicle.

40|$|The {{subject of}} {{retarding}} a moving vehicle or object {{in a controlled}} manner has been investigated over hundreds of years with many different solutions being developed over the years. As time has progressed a common overall design has almost uniformly been agreed upon for vehicle use; a <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> and caliper or brake drum arrangement. As vehicle refinement has improved there has been increasing focus on the refinement of such designs with regards to their noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) characteristics. Whilst brake noise has had significant research analysing its cause, effect and solutions, brake judder has had less research focussed upon it. The principal reason for past research priorities and the recent interest in judder is because of the increased demands being placed on brakes – higher power absorption with lighter structures. The subject of this thesis was to address the least known phenomena of brake judder, that of the thermo-elastic deformation of vented <b>brake</b> <b>discs.</b> The research utilised experimental, analytical and empirical methods to give a broader understanding of the transient deformation process, both thermo-plastic and thermo-elastic, of a high performance vehicle <b>disc</b> <b>brake.</b> Initial characterisation of thermal judder was carried out on-vehicle where it was identified that brake pressure {{could be used as a}} reliable indicator to show the developing nature of this phenomenon. The brake pressure pulsation was shown to change from low order (first or second order) to high order (up to eighth order) over the duration of a high speed vehicle brake test which involved up to thirty braking events. The pressure pulsation indicated a link to <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> deformation with the magnitude and order of brake pressure variation increasing with increasing <b>disc</b> <b>temperature.</b> The highly dynamic, transient, nature of <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> distortion was also investigated on a bespoke quarter car suspension brake dynamometer. Thermoelastic wave-like deformation was shown to occur during the process of a single braking event with the order of deformation corresponding to the brake pressure variation. The order of this wave-like deformation was shown to be linked to the amount of energy transferred into the braking system with higher energy braking events resulting in higher order deformation. Thermal images of the <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> have shown an equispaced formation of hot-spots on the inboard and outboard friction ring surfaces which was linked to the disc waveform. The wave-like deformation was attributed to circumferential buckling of the <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> as suggested by Lang [1]. This resulted from rapid thermal expansion of the friction rings due to the sudden - 4 - influx of heat during braking. Thermal gradients between the hot and cold regions of the <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> constrained the radial thermal expansion of the friction ring and caused compressive stresses to build up. When the tangential load causing the stress was in excess of the critical buckling load, buckling of the <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> occurred with the mode order of the buckled disc related to the temperature of the friction ring. Stress relieving of the <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> was shown to occur during brake testing on the brake dynamometer causing a thermo-plastic effect. This “in service” stress relieving effect removed the retained stresses resulting from the casting and machining processes and allowed the disc to adopt a second order mode of deformation. Data from the on-vehicle and dynamometer testing was used to generate and validate finite element analysis simulations which were used to investigate thermal inputs and heat dissipation from the <b>brake</b> <b>disc.</b> These findings were then combined with that of an associated aerodynamic study [2] to generate a modified <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> vent profile which reduced the surface temperature variation, thermal gradients and maximum <b>disc</b> <b>temperature.</b> On-vehicle testing of the prototype design showed an average 14 % reduction in maximum <b>disc</b> <b>temperature</b> and it was proposed that this would reduce the propensity for the disc to generate judder by reducing the thermal deformation of the <b>brake</b> <b>disc.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

Thus, it can be concluded that the variation direction of material properties in FG <b>brake</b> <b>discs</b> can affect the results...|$|R

The {{hot spot}} {{generation}} {{has been considered}} as the main degradation mechanism in railway <b>brake</b> <b>disc.</b> Therefore, the understanding of hot spots, also called hot judder, which is undesirable low frequency vibrations developed by non-uniform contact area between brake pad material and <b>brake</b> <b>disc,</b> is important for {{a better understanding of}} material design as well as enhancement of materials properties in railway <b>brake</b> <b>disc.</b> Also, infrared (IR) thermography is a powerful NDE technique for the characterization of thermal phenomenon in engineering components and/or systems including engineering materials. The high-speed IR camera provides the measurement of temperature change during brake operation as well as the images of temperature contour on the <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> surface. In this investigation, damage evolution due to generation of hot spots on railway <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> was investigated using the infrared thermography method. Moreover, based on obtained thermographic images of hot spots, the hot spots and thermal damage of railway <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> during <b>braking</b> operation were qualitatively analyzed...|$|R

Thermal performance {{was a key}} factor which was studied to measure <b>disc</b> surface <b>temperature</b> using chassis dynamometer in a drag braking with constant speed. The experimental work presented here to find friction coefficient and heat transfer coefficient, and evaluate temperatures for a ventilated <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> and for a prototype lightweight disc using a Rototest chassis dynamometer. Heat transfer coefficient and friction coefficient of friction material can be determined from cooling analysis. The results from experiments on a prototype lightweight <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> were shown to illustrate the effects of RBS/friction combination in terms of weight reduction. The design requirement, including reducing the thickness, would affect the temperature distribution and increase stress at the critical area. Based on the relationship obtained between rotor weight, and thickness, criteria have been established for designing lightweight <b>brake</b> <b>discs</b> in a vehicle with regenerative braking...|$|R

30|$|In this study, {{numerical}} optimisation {{and experimental}} validation of a divided rail freight <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> crown made of {{grey cast iron}} EN-GJL- 250 is presented. The analysed <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> is used in rail freight wagons and possesses a load capacity of 22.5 tons per axle. Two of the divided rail freight <b>brake</b> <b>discs</b> are mounted on each axle. With the aid of numerical analysis, the thermal dissipation properties of the <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> were optimised and ventilation losses were reduced, and the numerical results were compared with experimental results. A one-way fluid–structure interaction analysis was performed. A computational fluid dynamic model of a divided rail freight <b>brake</b> <b>disc,</b> used to predict air flow properties and heat convection, was incorporated into a finite element model of the disc and {{used to evaluate the}} <b>temperature</b> of the <b>disc.</b> A numerical parametrical optimisation of cooling ribs of the <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> was also performed, and novel optimised cooling ribs were developed. A transient thermal numerical analysis of the <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> was validated using temperature measurements obtained during a braking test on a test bench. The ventilation losses of the <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> were measured on a test bench specifically designed for the task, and the losses were compared to the simulation results. The experimentally obtained ventilation losses and temperature measurements compared favourably with the simulation results, confirming that this type of simulation process may be confidently applied in the future. Through systematic optimisation of the divided rail freight <b>brake</b> <b>disc,</b> ventilation losses were reduced by 37 % and the mass was reduced by 21 %, resulting in better thermal performance that will bring with it substantial energy savings.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Analyzing {{thermal load}} of {{friction}} pair of the <b>disc</b> <b>brakes</b> {{was not only}} an indispensable part but also a key theoretical basis for choosing materials of friction pair. In this paper, a <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> of a mining dump truck with 220 t loads was researched. In accordance with the brake test requirements of ISO 3450 - 1996 standard, the finite element model was built using ANSYS software and then the transient simulation analysis of the temperature field for the <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> was conducted. Finally the temperature distribution and its variation of the <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> were analyzed in detail based on the simulation results. Huge total weight of a 220 t mining dump truck with full loaded and few numbers of axles and discs lead to the <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> loading greatly and absorbing a large sum of energy on per unit area. At the same time, because of its 390 t full load and its 1 : 2 load ratio of the front axle to the rear axle, the weight undertaken by the rear axle is much heavier than the front bridge. In another word, compared with the front axle of the <b>brake</b> <b>disc,</b> the work conditions of the <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> on the rear axle is much more disadvantageous, the load undertaken and energy absorbed by per unit area is even bigger. Therefore, it’s very necessary to analyze the thermal load of the <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> of rear axle. Using {{the experience of the}} thermal analysis method of <b>brake</b> <b>discs</b> on high-speed train, the transien...|$|R
