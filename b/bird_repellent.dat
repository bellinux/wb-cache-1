40|$|Wildlife {{managers}} need chemical repellents {{that are}} effective at deterring damage by <b>birds,</b> but these <b>repellents</b> must be environmentally and toxicologically safe. The number of commercially available <b>bird</b> <b>repellents</b> {{has been reduced}} {{because of concerns about}} environmental safety. Currently, there are 2 categories of avian repellents. Chemicals that are reflexively avoided by birds because they irritate the peripheral chemical senses are referred to as primary repellents. Chemicals that cause gastrointestinal illness and learned avoidance of ancillary sensory cues that are paired with the illness are known as secondary repellents. Secondary repellents most often identified as the most effective avian repellents are derived from synthetic agrichemical pesticides and generally are regulated against because of their toxicity and concerns about the consequences of adding them to the environment. Primary repellents are usually derived from natural products and human food and flavor ingredients, and their use as <b>bird</b> <b>repellents</b> has been promoted as fulfilling the need for environmentally safe repellents. However, primary repellents are considered to be less potent than secondary repellents. We found that if the primary repellent, methyl anthranilate, was delivered enterically in European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris), we could achieve the same level of repellency as with the secondary repellent, methiocarb. Equal repellent effects for the 2 chemicals were found despite differences in their mode of action. Also, birds given an enteric delivery of the primary repellent methyl anthranilate showed fewer signs of behavioral distress (e. g., immobility and regurgitation) relative to those birds given the secondary repellent, methiocarb. By redirecting the site of action of a primary repellent, we have shown the feasibility to optimally combine the potency levels of secondary repellents with the biological and environmental safety attributes of primary repellents, without sacrificing efficacy. Primary repellents may be converted to secondary repellents via gastrointestinal delivery, thus potentially increasing efficacy and economic viability of these chemicals. Formulations that mask the irritating qualities of primary repellents are needed so that the chemical will be freely consumed by the target animal and exert its effect in the gastrointestinal tract...|$|R

40|$|Rejex-it® <b>bird</b> <b>repellents</b> {{are used}} to repel birds and reduce bird predation. Rejex-it® {{represents}} a long-needed, logical alternative to inhumane bird control methods such as poisoning and shooting. Its effectiveness as a nuisance bird repellant {{is based on a}} common, naturally-occurring, com lly recognized as safe 2 ̆ 2 food and ponent of food that has been designated by the FDA as a 2 ̆ 2 generafragrance additive. Methyl Anthranilate (MA), the active ingredient in Rejex-it® <b>Bird</b> <b>Repellents,</b> acts as a sensory repellent by irri tating the bird 2 ̆ 7 s taste buds, skin, and trigeminal chemoreceptors in the beaks, gizzards, eyes, and mucous membranes. Irritation occurs as a result of exposure to or ingestion of the formulation similar to how people react to chili pepper extract. Stimulation of the trigeminal chemoreceptors leads {{to a wide variety of}} protective, but not adverse, physiological reflexes. These reflexes are an important part of the common chemical sense to prevent exposure to irritants (Parker 1912, Journal of the Academy of Natural Sciences 15 : 221 - 224). As a result, birds modify their behavior by avoiding places where they have been exposed to this stimulus. Significantly, they cannot habituate to these reflexes. Indeed, they remember and avoid the geographic location where this experience took place. However, because the impact on the olfactory nerves (odor) is minimal, subsequent visits by other, more welcomed birds are possible. So far, no bird species is to be unaffected by Rejex-it®. Furthermore, birds do not habituate to this action. Rather, they become more sensitized with repeated exposure. The exposure to the birds can be either in the form of a dry fog to their eyes and mucous membranes or through the ingestion of treated food. Food sources treated with Rejex-it® in sufficient quantities are unpalatable to all species of birds. Even if they swallow larger quantities, the birds will unwillingly regurgitate the treated food and thus will not gain any energy benefit and will look elsewhere for other sources of nourishment...|$|R

Thus, treating grain with cement or plaster will not kill redwings but cement or plaster might serve as useful <b>bird</b> <b>repellents</b> for seed grain.

However, on day two there was an 80 % rejection of the seed containing the selected ryegrass/endophyte compared to the endophyte-free seed. The same rejection of 80 % was observed after a 3 -month endophyte-free feeding period, suggesting the rejection was a long-term, learned response or post-digestion feedback.

40|$|The use of organophosphorus and {{carbamate}} pesticides {{has increased}} markedly {{during the past}} two decades. Currently, more than 100 different organophosphorus and carbamate chemicals are registered as the active ingredients in thousands of different pesticide products in the United States. More than 160 million acre-treatments of these pesticides are estimated to be applied to agricultural crops and forests each year. Clearly, these two groups of chemicals constitute a major portion of all pesticides used today. Organophosphorus and carbamate compounds have histories dating back long before their use as pesticides. Carbamates were developed during investigation of 2 ̆ 2 ordeal 2 ̆ 2 poisons used in Africa and made from the calabar bean, which contains the only known naturally occurring carbamate ester (Kuhr and Dorough 1976). The insecticidal activity of carbamates was discovered in 1931 and developed in the mid-to-late 19402 ̆ 7 s. Large quantities were being produced and used by the late 19502 ̆ 7 s (Kuhr and Dorough 1976). Although much research on organophosphorus compounds was done in the 19 th century, the insecticidal activity of these chemicals was not discovered until 1937 (Eto 1974). In Germany, during World War II, the compounds were rapidly developed as insecticides, and during the 19502 ̆ 7 s the commercial use of organophosphates expanded markedly (Eto 1974). Presently, organophosphorus and carbamate pesticides are used as insecticides, herbicides, nematicides, acaricides, fungicides, rodenticides, and <b>bird</b> <b>repellents</b> throughout the world. The discovery that organochlorine pesticides, such as DDT, are highly persistent, bioconcentrate in food chains, and can severely affect whole populations or species of wildlife has led to bans and use restrictions (Stickel 1975). The decreased use of organochlorine pesticides has further expanded the market for the less-persistent organophosphates and carbamates (Murphy 1975 : Stickel 1975). Today, organophosphorus and carbamate pesticide use is widespread On agricultural crops, rangelands, forests, and wetlands, and undoubtedly exposes many wildlife species to chemical hazards. Organophosphorus compounds represent the largest group of insecticides known (McEwen and Stephenson 1979). During the past decade, there has been {{an increase in the number}} of reports of wildlife die-offs related to organophosphorus and carbamate pesticide use.

40|$|Bird {{damage has}} plagued orchardists since the {{earliest}} times of cultivation. In {{a matter of}} minutes, a flock of birds can literally strip a tree of all harvestable fruit or render hanging fruit unmarketable. While this level of damage is rare, significant economic impact can occur to those orchards where birds select to forage. Crop protection techniques available to orchardists are primarily limited to hazing (scarecrows, propane cannons, flagging) and physical exclusion (netting). Given the propensity of birds to habituate to hazing techniques, hazing methods offer limited protection for crops.
