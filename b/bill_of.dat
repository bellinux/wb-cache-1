5|$|Although Madison's {{proposed}} amendments {{included a}} provision {{to extend the}} protection {{of some of the}} <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights to the states, the amendments that were finally submitted for ratification applied only to the federal government. The door for their application upon state governments was opened in the 1860s, following ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment. Since the early 20th century both federal and state courts have used the Fourteenth Amendment to apply portions of the <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights to state and local governments. The process is known as incorporation.|$|E

5|$|Article I {{contains}} the entire original Virginia Declaration of Rights from the 1776 Constitution. Several of the sections have been expanded to incorporate concepts from the United States <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights, {{including the right}} to due process, the prohibition against double jeopardy, and the right to bear arms. Like the Federal Constitution, the Virginia <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights, in §17, states that the listing of certain rights is not to be construed to exclude other rights held by the people.|$|E
50|$|In England and Wales, logbook {{loans are}} {{regulated}} by the <b>Bills</b> <b>of</b> Sale Act 1878 and <b>Bills</b> <b>of</b> Sale Act (1878) Amendment Act 1882. Logbook loans and the <b>Bills</b> <b>of</b> Sale Acts {{have been subject to}} much criticism. In 2009, a consultation by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills examined the <b>Bills</b> <b>of</b> Sale Acts and proposed that <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> sale for consumer lending, such as logbook loans, should be banned. The government's response to the consultation was published in 2011. The response left the <b>Bills</b> <b>of</b> Sale Acts intact and led to the introduction of a voluntary code of practice for logbook lenders.|$|R
50|$|As a result, Parliament {{passed the}} <b>Bills</b> <b>of</b> Sale Act 1878. This largely {{replicated}} the provisions <b>of</b> an earlier <b>Bills</b> <b>of</b> Sale Act 1854. It requires all <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> sale {{to be registered}} at the High Court so that interested third parties could check whether the person in possession has already transferred away ownership of goods.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bills</b> <b>of</b> sale {{exist at}} common law quite {{independently}} of any legislation. In England and Wales, they are regulated by two Victorian pieces <b>of</b> legislation: the <b>Bills</b> <b>of</b> Sale Act 1878 and the <b>Bills</b> <b>of</b> Sale Act (1878) Amendment Act 1882. This {{area of the}} law was subject to review by the Law Commission, which published a consultation paper on 9 September 2015.|$|R
5|$|Black's view on {{due process}} drew from his reading of British history; to him, due process meant all persons {{were to be}} tried in {{accordance}} with the <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights' procedural guarantees and in accordance with constitutionally pursuant laws. Black advocated equal treatment by the government for all persons, regardless of wealth, age, or race. Black's view of due process was restrictive {{in the sense that it}} was premised on equal procedures; it did not extend to substantive due process. This was in accordance with Black's literalist views. Black did not tie procedural due process exclusively to the <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights, but he did tie it exclusively to the <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights combined with other explicit provisions of the Constitution.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights was {{submitted}} to the states for ratification, opinions had shifted in both parties. Many Federalists, who had previously opposed a <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights, now supported the Bill {{as a means of}} silencing the Anti-Federalists' most effective criticism. Many Anti-Federalists, in contrast, now opposed it, realizing that the Bill's adoption would greatly lessen the chances of a second constitutional convention, which they desired. Anti-Federalists such as Richard Henry Lee also argued that the Bill left the most objectionable portions of the Constitution, such as the federal judiciary and direct taxation, intact.|$|E

5|$|Section 25 {{was not a}} more {{significant}} source of criminal appeals in large part becauseas Barron v.

5|$|The <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights is {{the first}} ten {{amendments}} to the United States Constitution. Proposed following the oftentimes bitter 1787–88 battle over ratification of the U.S. Constitution, and crafted to address the objections raised by Anti-Federalists, the <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights amendments add to the Constitution specific guarantees of personal freedoms and rights, clear limitations on the government's power in judicial and other proceedings, and explicit declarations that all powers not specifically delegated to Congress by the Constitution are reserved for the states or the people. The concepts codified in these amendments are built upon those found in several earlier documents, including the Virginia Declaration of Rights and the English <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights 1689, along with earlier documents such as Magna Carta (1215). In practice, the amendments had little impact on judgements by the courts for the first 150 years after ratification.|$|E
5|$|The Federalist Papers (specifically Federalist No. 84) are {{notable for}} their {{opposition}} to what later became the United States <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights. The idea of adding a <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights to the Constitution was originally controversial because the Constitution, as written, did not specifically enumerate or {{protect the rights of}} the people, rather it listed the powers of the government and left all that remained to the states and the people. Alexander Hamilton, the author of Federalist No. 84, feared that such an enumeration, once written down explicitly, would later be interpreted as a list of the only rights that people had.|$|E

5|$|The First Amendment {{guarantees}} {{the rights of}} freedom of speech and peaceable assembly, among others. While not explicitly mentioned, the Supreme Court has held that the right to assembly includes the freedom of association, particularly political association. These protections not only prohibit the government from passing laws which infringe upon these rights, but also from taking actions which would violate them. While the <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights—which includes the First Amendment—applied originally only to the federal government, the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment allowed for the application of the <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights to the states under the incorporation doctrine.|$|E
5|$|The Second Amendment {{protects the}} {{individual}} {{right to keep}} and bear arms. The concept of such a right existed within English common law long before the enactment of the <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights. First codified in the English <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights of 1689 (but there only applying to Protestants), this right was enshrined in fundamental laws of several American states during the Revolutionary era, including the 1776 Virginia Declaration of Rights and the Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776. Long a controversial issue in American political, legal, and social discourse, the Second Amendment has been at the heart of several Supreme Court decisions.|$|E
