40|$|The {{dominant}} {{modes of}} blocking frequency {{variability in the}} Atlantic-European region are evaluated for the 1871 – 2010 period. An Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis of a two-dimensional <b>blocking</b> <b>indicator</b> field reveals three dominant EOFs, describing about 35 % of interannual to multidecadal blocking variability. The first EOF captures an out-of-phase blocking frequency anomaly over Greenland and Western Europe regions. The corresponding principal component time series is strongly correlated with the North Atlantic Oscillation index, but shows also significant correlations with indices of the East Atlantic, Scandinavian and East Atlantic-Western Russia patterns. The second EOF shows a dominant center over the North Sea region {{as well as a}} less pronounced center with anomalies of the same sign over southeastern Greenland. The multidecadal variations of this mode of blocking variability are related with a basin wide North Atlantic sea surface temperature anomaly which projects partly on the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). The third mode is an east–west dipole of blocking frequency anomalies from Scandinavian and southern Greenland regions and shows enhanced variability at ~ 20 [*]year time scales. The coherent variations of the time coefficients of this pattern with open solar flux suggest a possible solar influence on blocking variability at these time scales. Furthermore the dominant patterns of blocking variability are related with distinct anomaly patterns in the occurrence of extreme low temperature events over Europe at interannual to multidecadal time-scales. AMO as well as the solar signals were detected also in the corresponding extreme low temperature blocking patterns. We argue that multivariate analysis of <b>blocking</b> <b>indicators</b> gives additional information about blocking and related extreme climate phenomena variability and predictability comparative with classical sectorial approach...|$|R
40|$|Atmospheric {{blocking}} {{plays an}} important role in the mid-latitude climate variability and can be responsible for anomalous mean and/or extreme climate. In this study, a potential vorticity based <b>blocking</b> <b>indicator</b> is used to investigate the representation of Euro-Atlantic atmospheric blocking events in the ECHAM 5 /MPI-OM climate model. The impact of blocking events on present and future mean and extreme climate is studied by means of composite maps and correlation analyses. In comparison to ERA- 40 re-analysis, the model represents the blocking frequency and seasonal distribution well. We show that European blocking events have a sustained influence particularly on anomalous cold winter temperatures in Europe. In a future climate, the blocking frequency is slightly diminished but the influence on the European winter climate remains robust. Due to a northeastward shift of the blocking pattern and an increase in maximum blocking duration, cold winter temperature extremes can still be expected in a future climat...|$|R

5000|$|While {{attempting}} {{to allow the}} South London train into the station, Childs made his third mistake; he attempted to clear the home signal for this train before setting the points correctly. This again caused the Sykes apparatus to lock up, and, on this occasion, {{it would have to}} be released by Battersea Pier box. Childs sent the bell signal, but (his fourth mistake), he pressed the wrong release button, leaving the apparatus locked. Rather than attempting the release again, or contacting Battersea Pier by telephone to investigate the problem, Childs assumed the apparatus had failed, and decided to open the case and reset it manually. He was permitted to do this by the regulations then in force, but this procedure should only have been used in an emergency. While resetting the signal slide for the South London train, Childs inadvertently also cleared the interlock for the London Bridge train, which was still standing at the home signal.

All three trains were due to depart Battersea Park on the Up Local line, the South London train from the Wandsworth Road line, and the other two from the Clapham Junction line; the box immediately on the country side of this line from Battersea Park was Pouparts Junction. Childs accepted the South London train at 0758, and the London Bridge train at 0759, intending to hold the London Bridge train at the Up Local home signal until the South London train had cleared the section. He made his second mistake at this point; he failed to put the switch-hook on the Clapham line Up Local plunger, which had to be pressed to accept a train on the line.

30|$|While the PLS-SEM {{method has}} become popular to {{estimate}} complex models with latent variables, its goal {{to explain and}} predict a target construct of interest makes it particularly useful for estimating DCMs. For this purpose, a <b>block</b> of <b>indicators</b> per measurement model establishes a latent variable. Consequently, DCE data represent a suitable foundation for the estimation of PLS path models, which this paper illustrates. We outline that PLS-SEM offers features to estimate PLS path models when employing binary indicator data only. For this purpose, the researcher must create a PLS path model that only uses Boolean blocks for each categorical variable, whereby a Boolean indicator variable represents each category (Step 1, Model). The PLS path model estimation uses orthonormal data, which have no correlations between the Boolean indicators and that are standardized to unit variance (Step 2, Data). Then, the standard PLS-SEM algorithm estimates PLS path models using categorical indicator data and multiple latent variables. More specifically, when the data is orthonormal, Mode A and Mode B model estimations produce the same results (Step 3, Estimation). Lastly (Step 4, Rescaling), the estimated inner and outer weights and outer loadings require transformation into the metric of the Boolean variables (i.e., the metric of interpretation).|$|R
40|$|Principal {{components}} analysis (PCA) for numerical {{variables and}} multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) for categorical variables are wellknown dimension reduction techniques. PCA and MCA provide {{a small number}} of informative dimensions: the components. However, thesecomponents are a combination of all original variables, hence some dif?culties in the interpretation. Factor rotation (varimax, quartimax etc.) has a long history in factor analysis for obtaining simple structure, ie looking for combinations with a large number of coef?cients either close to zero or to 1 or - 1. Only recently, rotations have been used in Multiple Correspondence Analysis. Sparse PCA and group sparse PCA are new techniques providing components which are combinations of few original variables: rewriting PCA as a regression problem, null loadings are obtained by imposing the lasso (or similar) constraint on the regression coef?cients. When the data matrix has a natural block structure, group sparse PCA give zero coef?cients to entire blocks of variables. Since MCA is a special kind of PCA with <b>blocks</b> of <b>indicator</b> variables, we de?ne sparse MCA as an extension of group sparse PCA. We present an application of sparse MCA to genetic data (640 SNP?s with 3 categories measured on 502 women) and a comparison between sparse and rotated components...|$|R

To verify our research question, we first regress the market to book ratio over performance measures and risk indicators. Then, we verify whether bank business size and composition affect bank market valuation.

40|$|Graduation date: 2015 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from Aug. 21, 2014 - Feb. 21, 2015 Invasion by non-native plants into natural areas {{is an important component}} of global change that threatens biodiversity and ecosystem structure and function. Mountains are currently among the least invaded ecosystems, however, these biodiversity hotspots are increasingly under threat of exotic plant invasion. Evaluation of plant species distribution patterns in mountain ecosystems can provide insight into dominant processes of plant invasion and inform management to reduce the spread of non-native plants in mountains. The objectives of this study were to: 1) evaluate the main drivers of plant invasions in the Wallowa Mountain Range of northeastern Oregon, and the extent patterns of native species distributions and their causes differed from non-native species along an elevation gradient; and 2) investigate inter- and intra-annual understory vascular plant species variability along an elevation gradient to inform long-term monitoring of plant invasion dynamics in the Wallowa Mountains. We sampled understory vascular plant communities in summer 2012 along three forest roads in the Wallowa Mountains. Transects (n= 20) were evenly stratified by elevation (60 meters) along each road. Indicator species analysis (ISA) was used to identify habitat tendencies for non-native species. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS) related community composition to environmental and species trait factors. Predictors of non-native and native species abundance and richness were evaluated using Non-parametric multiplicative regression (NPMR). Canopy openness and elevation niche widths were modeled for all common species and evaluated for evidence of high elevation or closed canopy specialization. Non-native species richness decreased continuously with increasing elevation. In contrast, native species richness displayed a unimodal distribution with maximum richness at the mid-elevations. According to NMS and NPMR, elevation, canopy openness, and disturbance were the strongest correlates of non-native species abundance. Non-native species were concentrated in low elevation bunchgrass, roadside, and open forest habitats with high canopy openness, and moderate to high disturbance intensity. Overlays of species trait factors onto ordinations revealed that the transition into the subalpine community and over-story canopy closure exceeding approximately 60 percent were potential barriers to non-native species establishment. Vegetation sampling was repeated three times (June, July, and August 2013) during the growing season in summer 2013 for a subset (n= 10) of our transects. Blocked Multi Response Permutation Procedure (MRBP) was used to test the hypothesis of no change in species composition between years (summer 2012 and summer 2013) and between each sampling period (June, July, and August) within one growing season. NMS related community composition at different times to environmental and trait category factors. <b>Blocked</b> <b>Indicator</b> Species Analysis was used to identify species with tendencies towards specific sampling periods. Important predictors of vegetation change were identified and indicator species distributions were related to NMS axes using NPMR. Vegetation composition changed both between years and between each sampling period within one growing season. Species richness increased with sampling effort, dominant species were consistently found throughout all sampling periods and rare species showed the highest rate of turnover between sampling periods. The highest species richness and greatest number of indicator species were associated with the early summer (June) sampling period. Approximately 25...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the infrastructure {{as one of the}} important elements of the economic system. Authors have considered the stages of formation of this concept in the scientific world, the ideas of a number of scientists on a role and place of infrastructure in the economic system are given. Short genesis of approaches to the description of infrastructure and to assignment of its functions to certain branches is created. The paper emphasized the importance of strengthening the infrastructural support to the transition of the economy to the machine mode of production. Two main methodological approaches describing the nature and content of infrastructure are allocated: branch-wise and functional. The author's technique of the assessment of infrastructure security of territories at the regional level is offered. A basis of this technique is the allocation of the set of special indicators which values allow to see the level of development of separate elements of infrastructure. Indicative analysis, which is the basis of the methods, allows to judge any phenomenon by comparing the current observed values with the previously accepted threshold levels. This comparison allows one to classify the observations on the scale of "norm-pre-crisis-crisis". The essential advantage of this method is the normalization of indicators, i. e. their reduction to one comparable conditional size. It allows to receive the assessment on certain <b>blocks</b> of <b>indicators</b> and a complex assessment on all set in general.

The authors consider the development stages of this concept in the scientific community and provide the opinions of a number of researchers as to the role and place of the infrastructure in the economic system. The article provides a brief genesis of approaches to describing the infrastructure and conferring its functions on individual branches. The authors emphasize the higher importance of infrastructure coverage with the economy transition to machine production. Two key methodological approaches are identified to describe the substance and content of the infrastructure: industrial and functional. The authors offer their methodology of assessing the infrastructure coverage of regional-level territories. The methodology is based on identifying a combination of specific indicators the values of which can be used to evaluate the development level of individual infrastructure elements. The indicative analysis being the basis of the methodological apparatus helps make a judgment of any phenomenon by comparing the current observed values with the previously adopted threshold levels. Such comparison makes it possible to classify the observations by the «norm—pre-crisis—crisis» scale. An essential advantage of this method is the possibility of standardizing the indicators, or, in other words, bringing them to one comparable conditional value.

40|$|The {{cervical}} {{facet joint}} is a prevalent {{source of pain}} in patients with chronic cervical spine pain. Patients with persistent, disabling neck pain, are increasingly being referred for diagnostic facet joint blocks, {{with the aim of}} assessing their suitability for interventional procedures such as radiofrequency neurotomy (RFN). A positive response to the <b>block</b> is an <b>indicator</b> of more substantive benefits from RFN. Physiotherapists and medical practitioners are challenged to make appropriate referrals for diagnostic facet joint blocks. This lack of selection contributes to lengthy wait-lists, unnecessary invasive procedures for those who have a negative response and significant costs to the health care system. Physiotherapists use manual examination to identify the facet joint as the primary source of a patient’s pain but its diagnostic accuracy and reliability is variable. It is reasoned that a combination of findings of a physical, manual and psychological assessment may better indicate that a patient will respond positively or negatively to a diagnostic facet joint block. Clinical prediction guides (CPG) allow practitioners to use the results of the patient history, self-report measures and physical examination toward optimal diagnostic and therapeutic decisions. It is proposed that the development and validation of a CPG may aid in the appropriate selection of patients for this diagnostic procedure...|$|R
