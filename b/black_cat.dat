5000|$|<b>Black</b> <b>cats</b> {{have been}} found to have lower odds of {{adoption}} in American shelters compared to other colors except brown, although black animals in general take more time to find homes. Some shelters also suspend or limit adoptions of <b>black</b> <b>cats</b> around Halloween for fear they will be tortured, or used as [...] "living decorations" [...] for the holiday and then abandoned. Despite this, no one has ever documented in the history of humane work any relationship between adopting <b>black</b> <b>cats</b> and cats being killed or injured. When such killings are reported, forensic evidence has pointed to natural predators, such as coyotes, eagles, or raptors as the likely cause. August 17 is [...] "Black Cat Appreciation Day".|$|R

By December 2009, John Malkovich was in negotiations to play Vulture and Anne Hathaway would play Felicia Hardy, though {{she would not have}} transformed into the <b>Black</b> <b>Cat</b> as in the comics but a new superpowered figure, the Vulturess. According to sources online, an early draft of the film would have had the Vulture buying out the Daily Bugle, forcing Spider-Man to kill him. Felicia Hardy, Vulture's daughter in this version of the script, would have had an affair with Peter Parker in order to shatter his engagement with Mary Jane. These rumors were never confirmed. Raimi stated years later during an interview in 2013, however, that Hathaway was going to be <b>Black</b> <b>Cat</b> if Spider-Man 4 had been made.|$|E
