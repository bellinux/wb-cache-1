5|$|Montcalm, wary of a British counterattack, and {{concerned}} about the fatigue of his troops {{after a long day}} of battle, had barrels of <b>beer</b> <b>and</b> <b>wine</b> brought forward to the lines. The troops spent the night alternating between sleeping and working on the defenses in anticipation of a renewed attack.|$|E
5|$|Special permits {{exist to}} allow for the sale of {{alcoholic}} beverages at golf courses, government-owned facilities, and at social events run by non-profit organizations (for example, church carnivals). A restaurant in New Jersey without a liquor license can sell wine from a New Jersey winery by becoming an offsite retail sales outlet of the winery. Since the early 1990s, there have been a handful of unsuccessful proposals to create a separate restaurant license allowing eating establishments to sell <b>beer</b> <b>and</b> <b>wine.</b> Such proposals have been strongly opposed by current retail license holders who believe that it would decrease their income, and thus the value of their liquor license.|$|E

5|$|The Pitched Stone Court {{forms the}} {{north-east}} {{corner of the}} castle, and provided a centre for the castle services and servants; it {{takes its name from}} the late-Tudor cobbling, or pitched stones. On {{the east side of the}} court is the former office wing, a 16th-century construction mostly destroyed during the siege of 1646. The castle kitchens and pantries are on the north side, containing two large fireplaces and storage facilities for food and supplies in their cellars. In the 1460s, the first floors to these buildings included chambers for the senior servants. The buttery in the north-west corner would have been used to store and serve <b>beer</b> <b>and</b> <b>wine.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{hours of}} sale for {{on-premises}} consumption are regulated by local ordinance, and closing times vary by town. Atlantic City {{does not have}} closing hours, and alcohol {{can be purchased at}} its casinos and local bars 24 hours a day. With the exception of Newark and Jersey City, the law forbids hard liquor packaged goods sales before 9 am and after 10 pm any day of the week. This can be restricted further by local ordinance. Liquor stores may sell <b>beer</b> <b>and</b> <b>wine</b> during any hours that on-premises sales are allowed.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} staple crops {{consumed}} during Han were wheat, barley, foxtail millet, proso millet, rice, and beans. Commonly eaten {{fruits and vegetables}} included chestnuts, pears, plums, peaches, melons, apricots, strawberries, red bayberries, jujubes, calabash, bamboo shoots, mustard plant and taro. Domesticated animals that were also eaten included chickens, Mandarin ducks, geese, cows, sheep, pigs, camels and dogs (various types were bred specifically for food, while most were used as pets). Turtles and fish were taken from streams and lakes. Commonly hunted game, such as owl, pheasant, magpie, sika deer, and Chinese bamboo partridge were consumed. Seasonings included sugar, honey, salt and soy sauce. <b>Beer</b> <b>and</b> <b>wine</b> were regularly consumed.|$|E
25|$|GHB is also {{produced}} {{as a result}} of fermentation and so is found in small quantities in some <b>beers</b> <b>and</b> <b>wines,</b> in particular fruit wines. The amount found in wine is pharmacologically insignificant and not sufficient to produce psychoactive effects.|$|R
50|$|Brettanomyces claussenii is {{used for}} a variety of purposes. As a yeast, it is able to ferment cereals and fruits to produce <b>beers</b> <b>and</b> <b>wines</b> with unique flavor profiles. Brettanomyces claussenii can ferment a variety of other {{substances}} as well.|$|R

5|$|University {{president}} Robert Bruininks {{originally planned}} to have the school apply for a state liquor license in order to serve <b>beer</b> <b>and</b> <b>wine</b> in limited areas of the stadium. Under his proposal, alcohol would have been available only to occupants of premium season ticket seats ranging in price from $1,800 to $45,000 a year. This is/was consistent with the University's long-held alcohol policy at other on-campus athletic venues, such as Williams Arena and Mariucci Arena. This {{is also consistent with}} other NCAA institutions (including all other Big Ten Conference teams except for the University of Michigan) with on campus stadiums. No Big Ten stadiums serve alcohol in their general seating.|$|E
5|$|Yeasts {{have been}} used since ancient times to leaven bread and to ferment <b>beer</b> <b>and</b> <b>wine.</b> More recently, fungi {{have been used}} {{for a wide variety of}} {{industrial}} fermentations, whether working directly for their effects on materials such as processing paper pulp or bioremediating industrial waste, or serving as the source of enzymes for many purposes, such as fading and softening denim for fashionable blue jeans. Fungi yield a wide variety of industrial enzymes including amylases, invertases, cellulases and hemicellulases, pectinases, proteases, laccases, phytases, alpha-glucuronidases, mannanases, and lipases.|$|E
5|$|Vinegar {{was known}} early in civilization {{as the natural}} result of {{exposure}} of <b>beer</b> <b>and</b> <b>wine</b> to air, because acetic acid-producing bacteria are present globally. The use of acetic acid in alchemy extends into the 3rd century BC, when the Greek philosopher Theophrastus described how vinegar acted on metals to produce pigments useful in art, including white lead (lead carbonate) and verdigris, a green mixture of copper salts including copper(II) acetate. Ancient Romans boiled soured wine to produce a highly sweet syrup called sapa. Sapa that was produced in lead pots was rich in lead acetate, a sweet substance also called sugar of lead or sugar of Saturn, which contributed to lead poisoning among the Roman aristocracy.|$|E
5000|$|Alcoholic {{beverages}} {{are under}} the jurisdiction of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB), and as of 2012 are not required to have a nutrition facts label. Since at least 2003, consumer groups have lobbied the TTB to require labelling disclosing relevant information. [...] Marketing terms such as [...] "light" [...] for <b>beers</b> <b>and</b> <b>wines,</b> <b>and</b> [...] "table wine" [...] do have specific requirements, and in certain cases alcohol content must be disclosed.|$|R
5000|$|Plans are {{currently}} underway for a microbrewery {{to open in}} the community; <b>beers</b> <b>and</b> <b>wines</b> that emulate those found in Belgium and the Netherlands will be manufactured here. Producing very little noise or steam pollution, the microbrewery will bolster the economy of Norfolk County. Trappist beers will be brewed on site for the purpose of getting the higher-class members of Norfolk County to spend money more locally. The municipal government approved the rezoning of the surrounding land to [...] "light industrial" [...] in order for Norfolk County's third microbrewery to be possible according to the local by-laws. This community is the westernmost community to receive water from the Lynn River; which flows directly into Lake Erie. <b>Beers</b> <b>and</b> <b>wines</b> produced in the Nixon microbrewery will use the Lynn River as a source of their water.|$|R

5|$|A speaker for the Anti-Saloon League, Barkley co-{{sponsored}} the 1916 Sheppard–Barkley Act which banned alcohol {{sales in}} Washington, D.C. It {{was passed in}} 1917. He sponsored {{an amendment to the}} Lever Food and Fuel Act forbidding the use of grain – rendered scarce by World War I and a poor harvest in 1916 – to make alcoholic beverages. The amendment passed the House, but a conference committee amended it to allow production of <b>beer</b> <b>and</b> <b>wine.</b> Both measures increased Barkley's national visibility and set the stage for future prohibition legislation, including the Eighteenth Amendment. By 1917, the state Democratic Party was divided over prohibition, and the prohibitionist faction tried to enlist Barkley for the 1919 gubernatorial race. The Memphis Commercial Appeal noted in late 1917 that Barkley had not declined the invitations, but his continued silence reduced the prohibitionists' enthusiasm. He also showed little interest in the faction's attempts to recruit him to challenge incumbent anti-prohibition Senator Ollie James in the 1917 Democratic primary.|$|E
5|$|On the {{practical}} side, microbes {{have been used}} in activities from biological warfare to fermentation in food processing; bread, <b>beer</b> <b>and</b> <b>wine</b> have been produced by yeasts from the dawn of civilisation, such as in ancient Egypt. Microorganisms such as bacteria and viruses are important as pathogens, causing disease to humans, crop plants, and domestic animals. Fermentation is an important source of chemicals, as industrial chemists discover how to manufacture a widening variety of organic chemicals including enzymes and bioactive molecules such as hormones and competitive inhibitors for use as medicines. Fermentation is used, too, to produce substitutes for fossil fuels in forms such as ethanol and methane; fuels may also be produced by algae. Anaerobic microorganisms are important in sewage treatment. In scientific research, yeasts serve as model organisms especially in genetics and related fields.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{many other}} states, New Jersey imposes no {{restrictions}} on the types or quantities of alcoholic beverages that a person of legal age may purchase. Grain alcohol, caffeinated alcoholic beverages, and absinthe can be legally sold, and state law imposes no limitations on the alcohol content of beer or wine. New Jersey does not require kegs to be registered, and state ABC regulations prohibit municipal keg registration laws. A resident can import any amount of alcohol into the state for personal use, but a $50 permit is required if more than 3 gallons of beer, 1 gallon of wine, or a half-gallon of spirits are being imported within a 24-hour period. Any person who is 21 years or older may produce up to 200 gallons of beer or wine per year. No permit is required, but any brewing or winemaking must take place at a private home or non-commercial property, and any <b>beer</b> <b>and</b> <b>wine</b> produced cannot be sold. It is a criminal offense to possess an unregistered still, or distill any amount of hard liquor.|$|E

5|$|Yeasts {{have been}} used since ancient times to leaven bread and to ferment <b>beer</b> <b>and</b> <b>wine.</b> More recently, mould fungi have been {{exploited}} to create {{a wide range of}} industrial products, including enzymes and drugs. Medicines based on fungi include antibiotics, immunosuppressants, statins and many anti-cancer drugs. The yeast species Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an important model organism in cell biology. The fruiting bodies of some larger fungi are collected as edible mushrooms, including delicacies like the chanterelle, cep, and truffle, while a few species are cultivated. Mould fungi provide the meaty (umami) flavour of fermented soybean products such as tempeh, miso and soy sauce, and contribute flavour and colour to blue cheeses including Roquefort and Stilton. Moulds also yield vegetarian meat substitutes like Quorn. Some fungi, especially the fly agaric and psilocybin mushrooms are used for the psychoactive drugs that they contain; these in particular are the focus of academic study in the field of ethnomycology.|$|E
