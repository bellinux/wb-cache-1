5|$|Despite the {{excitement}} surrounding Lester's and King's performances, the Americans did not fare well overall. Fifteen matches were played, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> were won, while the team lost nine {{and earned a}} draw in four. The other win came against Warwickshire. During this match at Edgbaston, Lester scored 35 runs in the first innings and 67 in the second. Lester was the best batsmen on the Philadelphian side; beginning with 72 not out in his first match, he kept up his form all through the tour, scoring 891 runs for an average 37.12. Several counties offered him contracts to play in England.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{realization}} in February 1915 {{that the war}} would not be won quickly, the Navy department decided to replace the six armored cruisers that had been lost thus far. The ships were improved versions of the Derfflinger class; the primary alterations being {{the adoption of the}} 35cm (13.8in) gun for the main battery, along with a full-length forecastle deck. Four ships were ordered and laid down, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> of them, Mackensen and Graf Spee, were launched. None of the ships were completed, as work had been diverted to U-boat construction. All four ships were broken up in Germany between 1921 and 1924.|$|E

5|$|In the 1620s, the Spanish sent five {{military}} {{expeditions to}} investigate rumors of mines and other Europeans in the interior, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> reached La Tama, in 1625 and 1627. The first crossed the Wilderness of Ocute but was turned back at Cofitachequi {{due to the}} old war, while the second was allowed into Cofitachequi. After this, Spanish expansion efforts focused on the Timucua and Apalachee provinces west of St. Augustine rather than Georgia.|$|E
5|$|Kenneth Marlar Taylor (December 23, 1919 – November 25, 2006) {{was a new}} United States Army Air Corps Second Lieutenant pilot {{stationed}} at Wheeler Field during the Japanese attack on December 7, 1941. Along with his fellow pilot and friend George Welch, {{he managed to get}} a fighter plane airborne under fire. Taylor claimed to have shot down four Japanese dive bombers <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> were confirmed. Taylor was injured during the incident and received several awards for his efforts, including the Distinguished Service Cross and the Purple Heart.|$|E
5|$|Marine {{conservation}} {{has recently}} garnered support in Puerto Rico. The archipelago has an estimated 700miles (1,126.5km) of coastline and 1,300mi2 (3,370km2) of coral reef communities. The Department of Natural Resources of Puerto Rico maintains 25 areas with marine components <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> of these (11km2) are designated as no-take zones. All turtle species occurring in Puerto Rico's waters {{are classified as}} either endangered or threatened. Earthwatch-supported turtle conservation programs and U.S. federal programs have raised local awareness and {{have contributed to the}} decline of egg-poaching and turtle meat consumption.|$|E

5|$|Regenbald first {{appears in}} the {{historical}} record in 1050, when he witnesses a charter of King Edward. King Edward gave him large estates {{as a reward for}} his service to the king as a royal chaplain. The Domesday Book records him owning at least seven churches, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> of them have any indication that he performed any ecclesiastical services personally. Another royal reward was the grant to Regenbald of the status, without the actual office, of a bishop. He probably was unable to be promoted to a bishopric, either because he was married or because his style of life was known to be unchaste.|$|E
5|$|The section {{immediately}} {{south of}} Highway401 is often congested at all hours. Traffic studies have attributed congestion in the southbound lanes {{to the number}} of lanes merging from Highways401 and404 into the parkway and the lane changing that results from merging traffic from Highway401 clashing with exiting traffic to the nearby York Mills exit. Congestion in the northbound lanes is attributed to truck traffic coping with the steep grade of the valley, lane changing, and insufficient advanced signage for Highway401. Most traffic in this section travels north on Highway404, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> of the five lanes lead to it.|$|E
5|$|The short-finned {{pilot whale}} was described, from {{skeletal}} materials only, by John Edward Gray in 1846. He presumed from the skeleton that the whale had a large beak. The long-finned pilot whale was first classified by Thomas Stewart Traill in 1809 as Delphinus melas. Its scientific name was eventually changed to Globicephala melaena. Since 1986, the specific name of the long-finned pilot whale was changed to its original form melas. Other species classifications have been proposed <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> have been accepted. There exist geographic forms of {{short-finned pilot whale}}s off {{the east coast of}} Japan, which comprise genetically isolated stocks.|$|E

5|$|The toothcomb of {{treeshrews}} is {{like the}} lemuriform toothcomb in that it uses interdental spaces to form the comb tines, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> of its three pairs of lower incisors {{are included in the}} toothcomb and the canines are also excluded. The lateral two incisors in the toothcomb are generally larger. In the extinct arctocyonids, all six lower incisors were part of the toothcomb. In African antelopes, the toothcomb is strikingly similar to that of lemuriforms in that it consists of two pairs of incisors and a pair of canines.|$|E
5|$|When Deacon Adams died in 1748, Adams {{was given}} the {{responsibility}} of managing the family's affairs. In October 1749, he married Elizabeth Checkley, his pastor's daughter.

In July 1757, Elizabeth died soon after giving birth to a stillborn son. Adams remarried in 1764 to Elizabeth Wells, but had no other children.|$|E
5|$|Alloa led {{the match}} 2–1 at half-time <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> {{minutes after the}} {{interval}} both teams scored to make it 3–2 by the 47th minute. Paul Sheerin scored a second penalty for Inverness in the 56th minute to make the score 3–3 which is how the scoreline remained after 90 minutes, which forced an additional 30 minutes of extra time to be played. Martin Cameron scored his second goal for Alloa in the 104th minute to take a 4–3 lead but was cancelled out when Sheerin completed a hat-trick of goals for Inverness to make it 4–4 and take the game to penalties. Alloa Athletic emerged victorious after winning the shoot-out 5–4.|$|E

5|$|Anderson met Todd and Quantrill on September 24, 1864; {{although}} they had clashed in the past, they agreed to work together. Anderson suggested that they attack Fayette, Missouri, targeting the 9th Missouri Cavalry, which was based at the town. Quantrill disliked the idea because the town was fortified, but Anderson and Todd prevailed. Clad in Union uniforms, the guerrillas generated little suspicion {{as they approached the}} town, even though it had received warning of nearby guerrillas. However, a guerrilla fired his weapon before they reached the town, and the cavalry quickly withdrew into their fort while civilians hid. Anderson and Todd launched an unsuccessful attack against the fort, leading charge after futile charge without injury. The defeat resulted in the deaths of five guerrillas <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> Union soldiers, further maddening Anderson.|$|E
5|$|Little {{attempt was}} made during the 17th and 18th centuries to pump water, {{possibly}} because the coal-driven Newcomen steam engines would have been uneconomical. It is unclear why windmills were not employed, as {{they were on the}} Fens of East Anglia, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> examples have been recorded on the Levels: one at Bleadon {{at the mouth of the}} River Axe, where a sea wall had been built, and the other at Common Moor north of Glastonbury, which was being drained following a private Act of Parliament in 1721. The first steam pumping station was Westonzoyland Pumping Station in 1830, followed by more effective ones from 1860. Automatic electric pumps are used today.|$|E
5|$|Morton {{returned}} to eastern Indiana {{as a young}} man, and joined his family at Centerville. Leaving school {{at the age of}} fifteen, Morton briefly worked as an apothecary's clerk, but left after a dispute with the proprietor and apprenticed as a hat maker. After four years in the hat-making business he became dissatisfied and quit to enroll at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, where he studied for two years, and briefly attended Cincinnati College to continue his law studies. In 1845 he {{returned to}} Centerville and was admitted to the Indiana bar in 1846. Morton formed a law practice with Judge Newman and became a successful and moderately wealthy attorney. Morton married Lucinda Burbank in 1845. The couple had five children, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> survived infancy.|$|E

5|$|Several {{women in}} Carnivàle {{are tied to}} Avatars, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> have Avataric blood: Belyakov's {{daughter}} Iris is a Vectorus by definition, and Justin's daughter Sofie is the Omega. Although Sofie is {{two years older than}} Ben, her father's Avataric generation places her in the next Avataric generation. The other affected women are human mothers who began to suffer from mental illness or strange behavior after giving birth to an Avatar. Ben's mother Flora was a religious fanatic who would not touch her son. Scudder's mother Emma cut her eyes out and killed several of her family members the night Scudder was born. Sofie's mother Apollonia became catatonic after Sofie's birth. Justin's and his older sister Iris's mother receives no special mention in the series, but the Pitch Document mentions her chronic paranoid schizophrenia after Justin's birth. As far as known, none of these mothers became pregnant after giving birth to an Avatar.|$|E
5|$|The match {{began on}} Saturday 5 April 1890 at the Eclectics Cricket Club Ground in Kimberley. The toss was {{won by the}} Kimberley captain, Walter Woodthorpe, who opted to bat first. Bernard Tancred and Robert Snedden opened the batting, and scored 25 runs {{together}} before the first wicket fell. The Transvaal bowlers took three more wickets for the addition of just 27 runs, leaving Kimberley on 52 for 4. The batsmen then shared a partnership of 40 runs, but upon {{the loss of the}} next wicket, Kimberley suffered a collapse, and were eventually bowled out for 98 runs. Tancred top-scored for the side, accruing 42 runs, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> other batsmen reached double figures; Snedden and John Coghlan, both of whom scored 13. Transvaal only used three bowlers during the innings; Aubrey Smith and Bentley Wimble each took four wickets, while Charles Vintcent took the remaining two.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} other {{skeletal}} features are shared by dinosaurs. However, because they are either common to other groups of archosaurs or were not present in all early dinosaurs, these features are {{not considered to be}} synapomorphies. For example, as diapsids, dinosaurs ancestrally had two pairs of temporal fenestrae (openings in the skull behind the eyes), and as members of the diapsid group Archosauria, had additional openings in the snout and lower jaw. Additionally, several characteristics once thought to be synapomorphies are now known to have appeared before dinosaurs, or were absent in the earliest dinosaurs and independently evolved by different dinosaur groups. These include an elongated scapula, or shoulder blade; a sacrum composed of three or more fused vertebrae (three are found in some other archosaurs, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> are found in Herrerasaurus); and a perforate acetabulum, or hip socket, with a hole at the center of its inside surface (closed in Saturnalia, for example). Another difficulty of determining distinctly dinosaurian features is that early dinosaurs and other archosaurs from the late Triassic are often poorly known and were similar in many ways; these animals have sometimes been misidentified in the literature.|$|E
