5|$|At night, Evelyn {{takes the}} Book of the Dead and reads a page aloud, accidentally {{awakening}} Imhotep. The expeditions return to Cairo, but Imhotep follows {{them with the}} help of Beni. Imhotep returns to full strength by killing the Americans one by one, and brings the ten plagues back to Egypt. Seeking a way to stop Imhotep, Rick, Evelyn and Jonathan meet Ardeth at a museum. Ardeth hypothesizes that Imhotep wants to resurrect Anck-su-Namun again and plans to do so by sacrificing Evelyn. Evelyn <b>believes</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the Book of the Dead brought Imhotep back to life, the Book of the Living can kill him again, and deduces the book's whereabouts. Imhotep corners the group with an army of slaves. Evelyn agrees to accompany Imhotep if he spares the rest of the group.|$|E
25|$|A 2008 {{analysis}} of a single-payer bill by Physicians for a National Health Program estimated the immediate savings at $350 billion per year. The Commonwealth Fund <b>believes</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> the United States adopted a universal health care system, the mortality rate would improve and the country would save approximately $570 billion a year.|$|E
25|$|Despite Saudi Arabia {{asking for}} Pakistan's support {{to join the}} coalition, the Pakistan {{government}} has also called for a ceasefire {{in order to help}} negotiate a diplomatic solution. Alongside Turkey, Pakistan has taken initiatives to arrange a ceasefire in Yemen. Analysis written in U.S. News, Pakistan's strategic calculations firmly <b>believes</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the Saudis enter into a ground war in Yemen– with or without Pakistani military– it will become a stalemate; therefore, Pakistan is increasing its efforts to potentially help engineer a face-saving solution to achieve a ceasefire and end the war.|$|E
50|$|Teeth {{falling out}} - Sigmund Freud <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> {{a woman had}} a {{recurring}} dream of her teeth falling out that she unconsciously longed to have children. He <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> a man had this dream {{he was afraid of}} castration.|$|R

50|$|The media <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> the Aggies' {{chances of}} winning {{depended}} on the play of Bob Kurland, the nation's leading scorer. An Associated Press writer <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> Kurland played like {{he had in the}} past eleven games, then the Aggies would be the first team to repeat as NCAA champions. Sportswriters <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> McKinney - who was assigned to guard Kurland - could play well enough defense and Dillon make enough shots, the Tar Heels would have a chance at winning.|$|R
25|$|Astaire's {{last major}} musical film was Finian's Rainbow (1968), {{directed}} by Francis Ford Coppola. Astaire shed his white tie and tails {{to play an}} Irish rogue who <b>believes</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he buries a crock of gold {{in the shadows of}} Fort Knox the gold will multiply. Astaire's dance partner was Petula Clark, who played his character's skeptical daughter. He described himself as nervous about singing with her, while she said she was worried about dancing with him. The film was a modest success both at the box office and among critics.|$|E
25|$|Van Zyl {{took the}} voice {{recorder}} to the National Transportation Safety Board in Washington, DC, {{to show his}} goodwill and to ensure neutral observers. Van Zyl <b>believes</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he kept the CVR in South Africa {{he could have been}} accused of covering up the truth. At the NTSB, Van Zyl felt frustration that the degraded CVR, which had been in the deep ocean for fourteen months, did not initially yield any useful information. Around 28 minutes into the recording the CVR indicated that the fire alarm sounded. Fourteen seconds after the fire alarm, the circuit breakers began to pop. Investigators believe that around 80 circuit breakers failed. The CVR cable failed 81 seconds after the alarm. The recording revealed the extent of the fire.|$|E
25|$|Hamlet {{struggles to}} turn his desire for revenge into action, and spends {{a large portion of}} the play waiting rather than doing. Scholars have {{proposed}} numerous theories as to why he waits so long to kill Claudius. Some say that Hamlet feels for his victim, fearing to strike because he <b>believes</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he kills Claudius he will be no better than him. The story of Pyrrhus, told by one of the acting troupe, for example, shows Hamlet the darker side of revenge, something he does not wish for. Hamlet frequently admires those who are swift to act, such as Laertes, who comes to avenge his father's death, but at the same time fears them for their passion, intensity, and lack of logical thought.|$|E

I <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> she's bad she's not a little bad. I can't tell you why, but that's how I see her. She'll really live or she'll really not. She'll have it all or she'll miss it all. Now I don't think she'll have it all." ...|$|R

25|$|It was {{reported}} in May 2007 that local Conservative councillors were investigating the possibility of securing a grant to reconstruct the pier. Councillor Richard Fulford-Brown <b>believes</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the circumstances regarding the pier's demolition were an issue today, it would be considerably more difficult {{to follow through with}} it and takes the view that a pier visitor attraction offers something interesting for residents and visitors alike. A similar suggestion had previously been made by a local architect, who proposed an eco-friendly boardwork complete with a viewing station. As of 2007, Lytham St Annes Civic Society were opposed to any reconstruction proposal {{on the grounds that the}} town centre should be protected, especially as there are already piers in nearby St Annes-on-the-Sea and Blackpool (North and Central) respectively.|$|E
25|$|Hauerwas finds little {{justification}} for human experimentation through informed consent. He {{argues that a}} patient’s understanding of an experimental procedure will never approach that {{of his or her}} physician. He questions even the possibility of a patient reaching a state of “informed consent.” He further <b>believes</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> individuals reach such a state of “informed consent”, this does not mean individuals should consent, or fully understand the meaning of their consent. “For persons can misuse themselves even if they do so voluntarily and with full knowledge.” Individuals consenting to experimentation through the justification of the human good, turn themselves into objects {{for the use of the}} experimentation. The issue is further complicated for Hauerwas as to whom should be considered for medical experimentation. The use of prisoners only proliferates social stereotypes and denigration. He believes that informed consent is necessary for human experimentation, but it does not provide {{justification for}} our willingness to submit and participate in experimentation.|$|E
25|$|Princeton University {{professor}} and animal rights activist Peter Singer <b>believes</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> alternative means of survival exist, one ought {{to choose the}} option that does not cause unnecessary harm to animals. Most ethical vegetarians argue that the same reasons exist against killing animals in the flesh to eat as against killing humans to eat. Singer, in his book Animal Liberation, listed possible qualities of sentience in non-human creatures that gave such creatures the scope to be considered under utilitarian ethics, {{and this has been}} widely referenced by animal rights campaigners and vegetarians. Ethical vegetarians also believe that killing an animal, like killing a human, can only be justified in extreme circumstances and that consuming a living creature for its enjoyable taste, convenience, or nutrition value is not a sufficient cause. Another common view is that humans are morally conscious of their behaviour in a way other animals are not, and therefore subject to higher standards.|$|E

25|$|In {{the second}} season finale, Cameron denies that {{exposure}} to Terminators and their shielded nuclear power cells cause cancer in humans, as John <b>believes</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> his mother is sick it could be from living with her for so long. Cameron states that she has internal sensors to detect radiation leakage. While rescuing Sarah from the Los Angeles County lockup, Cameron sustains heavy damage, including {{the loss of her}} left eye covering. Cameron then enters the basement of ZeiraCorp to find John Henry. The cyborg's body is subsequently found inside the room where John Henry was kept, but missing its chip; the original chip (from Cromartie) was destroyed by Sarah Connor. When John and the T-1001 give chase into the future, a character portrayed by Summer Glau is present, but it is Allison Young, and not Cameron, as Josh Friedman stated in the audio commentary to the finale episode of the show (the dog is not barking at her and she acts as a human female rather than as Cameron).|$|E
500|$|Rosenbaum {{realizes that}} the {{friendship}} between Lex and Clark is destined to fail, but that Clark's friendship truly is important to Lex early in the series. The actor also <b>believes</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> Clark could see the darkness that Lex is constantly fighting then he would understand more of Lex's actions. Reviewer Brian Byun expressed that the choice to explore the friendship between Clark and Lex, before they become sworn enemies, which was something {{that had been used}} in the past but never to the depth of what Smallville is doing, helped keep the show from becoming [...] "Dawson's Creek with superpowers".|$|E
500|$|Thirty-nine days later, the {{survivors}} attend {{a memorial service}} for the victims. That night, Tod is killed when a chain reaction causes him to be strangled in his bathtub. His death is [...] deemed a suicide; however, Alex does not believe that Tod killed himself. He and Clear sneak into the funeral home to see Tod's body, where they meet mortician William Bludworth, who tells them that they have ruined Death's plan, and Death is now claiming the lives of those who were meant to die on the plane. The next day, Alex and Clear discuss what the mortician said at a cafe. Alex <b>believes</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> they look out for omens they can cheat Death again, although Clear is skeptical. They encounter the rest of {{the survivors}}; and when Carter provokes Alex, Terry storms off in anger and is suddenly killed by a speeding bus.|$|E

500|$|... "Good Vibrations" [...] {{became the}} band's most popular hit {{after it was}} {{released}} on October 10, 1966. The A.V. Club Noel Murray theorized that its success helped turn around the perception of Pet Sounds; that the [...] "un-hip orchestrations and pervasive sadness baffled some longtime fans, who didn't immediately get what Wilson was trying to do." [...] In the final quarter of 1966, the Beach Boys became the strongest selling album act in the UK, ending the three-year reign of native bands such as the Beatles. Love <b>believes</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the lyrics did not have [...] "anything to connect to people intellectually or emotionally, then {{it would have been}} a brilliant piece of music, but perhaps not gone to No 1." [...] According to songwriter-producer Jonathan King, the single drew some criticism for its elaborate production; [...] "Computerized pop, mechanized music. Take a machine, feed in various musical instruments, add a catch phrase, stir well, and press seven buttons. It is long and split. ... impressive, fantastic, commercial—yes. Emotional, soul-destroying, shattering—no." ...|$|E
500|$|Central to Colbert's {{personality}} is his rigid belief that [...] "what I say is right, and [...] anyone else says {{could possibly be}} true", regardless of any evidence to the contrary. He discussed this in the Reports first Wørd segment, using the term [...] "truthiness" [...] as he explained what he perceives to {{be the difference between}} [...] "those who think with their head and those who know with their heart". He has further gone on to ascribe [...] "truthiness" [...] to other institutions including Wikipedia, which he believes upholds his view that reality can be determined by consensus opinion, and often encourages viewers to use Wikipedia to [...] "change reality". Colbert <b>believes</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> a majority of people want something to be true, that thing therefore must become the truth. For instance, after months of scoffing at global warming, Colbert suddenly reversed his position, conceding its existence only due to the box office success of An Inconvenient Truth, a sign that [...] "the free market has spoken".|$|E
500|$|Spielberg {{said that}} the arrest of criminals before {{they have a chance}} to commit their crimes in the movie had some {{real-world}} background in post-9/11 America, saying that [...] "e’re giving up some of our freedom so that the government can protect us." [...] The future world in Minority Report of retinal scans, robotic human inspectors, and intrusive, individualized, public advertising arrived in American theaters as the country was debating how much governmental intrusion into personal matters was necessary to ensure safety of its citizens. Spielberg said he would be against a PreCrime system if it were ever possible, as he <b>believes</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> it did exist, those in control of it would undoubtedly abuse its powers. Kowalski questions what the benevolent precogs in the film could become in the hands of those who trained their skills for political intrigue. Science fiction scholar Gary Westfahl asserts that in a political context, PreCrime may be seen [...] "a metaphor for racial profiling, and one could view the liberation of the precogs as the end of a form of slavery." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Brother, Brother", {{the first}} song on the album, is {{inspired}} by the band members' experience with the drug use of friends. Bawinkel stated {{in an interview that}} [...] "a bunch of the tunes cover what we wanted to say to them during those times [...]" [...] Michael Weaver, writing for Jesus Freak Hideout, interpreted the song as an attempt to convince this individual to turn his or her life around and return to the Christian faith. The next track, named [...] "The Rich, The Strong and The Poor", tells the story of three men looking for happiness. The first tries to find it in money, but he returns unfulfilled. The second tries looking for happiness in physical strength. He <b>believes</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he proves himself, that he will find peace. Like the first man, he ends up unfulfilled. The final man looks for happiness in basic life needs and likewise ends up in the same position as the first two men. Bawinkel explains that, [...] "all three are very much in the same position in that happiness hasn’t been found in chasing these various desires. There is something more which is hopeful for some and frustrating for others." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ibn Khaldun also anticipates Niccolò Machiavelli by {{attempting}} {{to answer the question}} of whether it is better for the ruler to be feared or loved. [...] Ibn Khaldun, like Machiavelli, answers that it is best to be both (though in The Prince, Machiavelli argues it's ultimately more effective for a ruler to retain power through fear). However, unlike Machiavelli, Khaldun <b>believes</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> that is not possible then it is better to be loved than feared because fear creates many negative effects in the state's population.|$|E
