40|$|Coarse grain yields have {{remained}} relatively constant and production has stagnated in Niger {{during the past}} six years, while the population has risen. This paper examines one proposed government intervention to increase cereal production: {{the application of a}} one-time <b>basal</b> <b>dressing</b> using phosphates fertilizers. This intervention may provide a means of raising production to keep pace with increasing cereal demand; it may also augment soil fertility in the short run. This evaluation presents a preliminary economic analysis and suggests areas for further work towards a phosphate <b>basal</b> <b>dressing</b> scheme. In order to simplify the analysis, the scheme is only considered for millet production in the Niamey Department.

40|$|Loss {{of ammonia}} (NH 3) {{as a result}} of {{intensive}} N fertilization, especially due to agronomic practices in South China, is not well characterized. To investigate mechanisms and characteristics of NH 3 volatilization after urea application, an on-line monitoring system, with 30 -min data resolution, was used to study vegetable and rice fields from January 2009 to September 2010. Ammonia emissions and concurrent meteorological conditions were monitored for up to 20 days after fertilization in 12 experiments. Standard recovery test results indicated that the on-line measurement system was both stable and accurate. The NH 3 emission factors (EFs) related to broadcast (soil surface) <b>basal</b> <b>dressing</b> and top dressing to Brassica rapa L were 23. 6 % and 21. 3 %, respectively. The NH 3 EFs from holing <b>basal</b> <b>dressing</b> and broadcasting top dressing for lettuce were 17. 6 % and 24. 0 %, respectively. The NH 3 EFs for early rice in parallel broadcast <b>basal</b> <b>dressing</b> process were 10. 7 % and 14. 2 %, while in parallel top dressing process were 24. 0 % and 22. 6 %, respectively. The NH 3 EFs for late rice were 15. 4 % and 21. 0 % in parallel broadcasting <b>basal</b> <b>dressing</b> process, while 13. 2 % and 17. 6 % in parallel top dressing process. Emission of NH 3 from vegetable and rice fields occurred mainly in the first 2 - 3 weeks after fertilization. Ammonia emission flux was positively correlated with air temperature and soil temperature in the majority of the experiments. Relationships between NH 3 emissions and humidity, soil moisture or wind speed were explored, which were not consistent among all tests. Ammonia emission in vegetable and rice fields was primarily associated with temperature. High-resolution data, such as those gathered in the current investigation, will contribute to a more thorough quantitative understanding of the relationship between fertilizer application, environmental conditions, and NH 3 volatilization which, in turn, will improve the accuracy of atmospheric modeling on local, regional and global scales.

40|$|Abstract,Smallholder {{farmers are}} facing {{problems}} of low soil fertility causing maize yield reduction {{of up to}} 1. 5 tonnes per hectare (t/ha) compared to 5 t/ha obtained in the commercial sector. A maize trial was conducted on two wetlands in Natural Region IV of Zimbabwe at Zungwi vlei to determine effects of different rates of compound D and cattle manure as <b>basal</b> <b>dressing</b> with different rates of ammonium nitrate as top-dressing. The maize used was a two-way early maturing hybrid developed by Seed Co. (SC 513) for marginal areas. Four basal applications were applied in the trial as treatments for two seasons with four different levels of nitrogen applied as subplots factor. The analysis revealed a highest significant increase in grain yield when 300 kilogrammes per hectare (kg/ha) of compound D was applied with 150 kg/ha of ammonium nitrate (N) as top-dressing. Significant increase in grain yield was also observed when cattle manure was applied with 150 kg/ha top-dressing of N. There was a significant yield advantage when the nitrogen was increased after applying a <b>basal</b> <b>dressing</b> in both sites for the two seasons. In order to achieve high yields, the use of compound D at 300 kg/ha as <b>basal</b> <b>dressing</b> and top-dressing at 150 kg/ha N is highly recommended to farmers. However, for the lowresourced and poor farmers, the use of cattle manure which is generally cheaper and affordable is recommended...|$|E
40|$|Intensification of crop {{production}} in the mid-hills of Nepal has led to concerns that nitrogen loss by leaching may increase. This study estimated the amount of N leached during two years from rainfed terraces (bari-land) at three locations in Nepal. Maize or upland rice grown in the monsoon season was given either no nutrient inputs or inputs via either nitrogen fertilizer or farmyard manure. Nitrate concentration in soil solution was measured regularly with porous ceramic cup samplers and drainage estimated from a simple soil water balance. Estimated losses of nitrogen by leaching ranged from 0 to 63. 5 kg N ha(- 1) depending on location and the form of nitrogen applied. Losses from plots receiving no nutrient inputs were generally small (range: 0 - 35 kg N ha(- 1)) and losses from plots where nitrogen was applied as manure (range: 2 - 41 kg N ha(- 1)) were typically half those from plots with nitrogen applied as fertilizer. Losses during the post-monsoon crops of finger millet were small (typically < 5 % of total loss) although losses from the one site with blackgram were larger (about 13 %). The highest concentrations of nitrate in solution were measured {{early in the season}} as the monsoon rains began and immediately following fertilizer applications.

The results indicate that: In the 2 nd crop, N uptake increased linearly with increasing N application rate were estimate as 45, 37 and 75 percents for the <b>basal</b> <b>dressing,</b> {{the first and the}} second top dressing, respectively. In the 1 st crop, however, only the N applied at the second top dressing showed significant effect on N uptake. And the recovery rate was aboult 77 percent. The partitioning pattern of the current absorbed N among plant organs did not differ much across the range of treatments. During vegetative period, the absorbed N was allotted with largest proportion to leaf blade, lesser to stem and sheath and the least to root. After heading, the proportion of current absorbed N that was distributed to vegetative organs declined rapidly and panicle soon became redistribution and thus formed a second source for the H remobilization were more prominent in the 2 nd crop season than in the first. In the 2 nd crop, the amount of N remobilized from stem and sheath to panicle decreased as application rate of <b>basal</b> <b>dressing</b> increased.

The {{purpose of this}} study was to investigate the effect of mulching {{and nitrogen}} fertilizer on the soil water content, soil nitrate-N content and vertical distribution in maize root-zone. The experiment was conducted over two consecutive years and used randomly assigned field plots with three replicates. The six treatments consisted of no fertilizer without plastic film (CK), plastic film mulching with no basal fertilizer and no top <b>dressing</b> (MN 0), <b>basal</b> fertilizer with no top dressing and no mulching (BN 1), plastic film mulching and basal fertilizer with no top <b>dressing</b> (MN 1), <b>basal</b> fertilizer and top dressing with no mulching (BN 2) and plastic film mulching with basal fertilizer and top dressing (MN 2). In the top soil layers, the soil water content was a little high in the plastic film mulching than that without mulching. The mean soil water content from 0 to 40 cm without mulching were 3. 35 % lower than those measured in the corresponding mulching treatments in 31 days after sowing in 2012. The mulching treatment increased the soil nitrate-N content was observed in the 0 - 40 -cm soil layers. The results indicate that high contents of soil nitrate-N were mainly distributed at 0 - 20 -cm at 31 days after sowing in 2012, and the soil nitrate-N concentration in the MN 2 treatment was 1. 58 times higher than that did not receive fertilizer. The MN 2 treatment greatly increased the soil nitrate-N content in the upper layer of soil (0 - 40 -cm), and the mean soil nitrate-N content was increased nearly 50 mg kg- 1 at 105 days after sowing compared with CK treatment in 2012. The soil nitrate-N leaching amount in MN 1 treatment was 28. 61 % and 39. 14 % lower than BN 1 treatment, and the mulch effect attained to 42. 55 % and 65. 27 % in MN 2 lower than BN 2 in both years. The yield increased with an increase in the <b>basal</b> fertilizer, top <b>dressing</b> and plastic film mulching, and the grain yield increase ranged from 31. 41 % to 83. 61 % in two consecutive years.

40|$|Effect {{of dietary}} energy level on female goat kid growth and carcass characteristics: The {{present study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the effect of different dietary energy levels on performance and carcass characteristics of female goat kids. Graded proportions of dietary energy (8. 5, 9. 5, 10. 5 and 11. 5 MjME/kg) were incorporated in four iso-nitrogenous diets for the experiment. Sixty yearling female goat kids of Nubian ecotype with an average initial weight of 16. 54 kg, were used. These kids were divided randomly into 4 groups A, B, C and D in a complete randomized design. Group A was fed the highest dietary energy level (11. 5 MjME/kg) followed by group B (10. 5 MjME/kg), group C (9. 5 MjME/kg) and group D which was offered the lowest dietary energy level (8. 5 MjME/kg). The goat kid groups were fed these diets for 105 days. The dietary energy level had a significant effect on body and carcass measurements, where group D which was raised on the lowest dietary energy level had the lowest values of body measurements while group A had the highest body measurements. Total gain was 9. 12, 7. 81, 4. 75 and 0. 35 Kg/head for group A, B, C and D respectively, which was highly significant (P< 0. 001). The weekly and daily rate of weight gain and feed conversion ratio were also significantly higher in the goat kid group A that was raised on the highest level of dietary energy. Dietary energy level produced significant effect on carcass characteristics as well as hot and cold dressing percentages. Dietary energy level also produced significant effects on total carcass bone and trim tissues which tended to increase with the decrease of dietary energy level. Total carcass fat was significantly decreased as the dietary energy level decreased. The effect of dietary energy level was clearly shown in fat distributed throughout the body of the goat kid. Total body, carcass and visceral fat were significantly (P< 0. 01) decreased with the decrease of dietary energy level. Generally all non-carcass components weights were significantly affected by the level of dietary energy. These components tended to decrease in weight with the decrease of dietary energy level. Yield of wholesale cuts was not significantly affected by the level of dietary energy level, except the breast joint which was lower in group D which was raised on the lowest dietary energy level. Meat chemical composition was significantly (p< 0. 001) affected by the level of dietary energy. Meat moisture and protein content increased, while fat decreased with the decrease of dietary energy level. Meat quality attributes showed significant effect for water holding capacity and cooking loss, indicating that group A which was raised on the highest dietary energy level had superior water holding capacity and lower cooking loss. Meat colour revealed significant (P< 0. 01) effect among the dietary treatments for lightness and redness, indicating that meat from group D which was raised on the lowest dietary energy level was darker red in colour than the meat from the other treatment groups. The meat from goats of group A which received the highest dietary energy level was the most tender compared with that from the other treatment groups. The dietary energy levels induced significant (P< 0. 01, P< 0. 05) effects among the tested groups for taste panel scores of flavour, tenderness and overall acceptability. Meat from female goats of group A which was raised on the highest dietary energy was most tender and acceptable than that from the other treatment groups. Exp. II Effect of rehabilitation of underfed female goat kids on growth and carcass characteristics: Seven kids from group D in the first experiment which were raised on the lowest dietary energy level (8. 5 MjME/kg) were used to study the effect of rehabilitation on performance and carcass characteristics of the female goat kids. These kids were found to maintain their initial body weight throughout the feeding period which lasted for 105 days. These goat kids were rehabilitated on the high energy diet (11. 5 MjME/kg) that was offered to group A and were kept until they reached the body weight attained by group A. They took 175 days to reach that weight. Rehabilitation had significant (P< 0. 001) effect on weekly, daily rate of gains and total dry matter intake which were lower in the compensating female goats than the <b>basal</b> group. <b>Dressing</b> percentage increased significantly (P< 0. 05) in the rehabilitated group. However carcass characteristics were not affected by rehabilitation. Carcass fat, bone and muscles were increased in the compensating group. Gut fill was slightly decreased in the rehabilitated group. Rehabilitation did not significantly affect fat distribution throughout the body, but total body, carcass and visceral fat were increased in the rehabilitation group. All non carcass components were not affected by the rehabilitation except the liver which was significantly (P< 0. 05) increased and the udder which was significantly (P< 0. 05) decreased in the rehabilitated group. Meat chemical composition was significantly affected by rehabilitation. Percentages of fat, sacroplasmic and Myofibrillar proteins increased significantly (P< 0. 01) in the meat from the compensating goats. Moisture, ash, non-protein nitrogen percentages and pH values decreased but not significantly so in the meat from the rehabilitated goat group. Meat from the rehabilitated goat group showed superior water hold capacity and less cooking loss value. Meat from goats that experienced rehabilitation was significantly lighter in colour possibly due to increased fatness. However redness values of the meat, though not significant were lower compared with that from normally growing goat kids. Carcass measurements as heart girth and abdomen circumference were significantly (P< 0. 05) increased by rehabilitation, while measurements, as body length and scapular and thigh circumference were not significantly affected. Taste panel scores for meat quality revealed that the rehabilitated goat group had significantly (p< 0. 01) less odour intensity, less tender meat and less meat colour values than the basal group. While juiciness scores were significantly (p< 0. 05) increased in the meat from the rehabilitated goat group...|$|R

And grain yield, protein content in grain and stability time of paste, reduced as a result. When the topdressing fertilizer N was postponed from jointing stage to booting stage, the regularity of above index changed conversely.

A 3 -years trial (2008 / 2011) was conducted in Alicante (Southeastern Spain), testing four SSC application rates (0, 30, 50 and 70 t/ha) on a heavy textured Anthrosol. The addition of SSC enhanced soil fertility, primarily increasing organic carbon (Cox), Kjeldahl nitrogen (Nk), available P (PBurriel), CuDTPA and ZnDTPA levels. Comparatively with the control (0 t/ha), 30, 50 and 70 t/ha treatments induced a rise of 11 %, 19 % and 25 % in Nk (Control= 1. 11 g/kg) and PBurriel (Control= 79 mg/kg), while for Cox (Control= 11. 8 g/kg) was 14 %, 21 % and 30 %.

To investigate the processes affecting the dynamics of N and pH under Mediterranean conditions, rice (Oryza sativa L. cv.

Plants were grown under an intermittent flooding regime. Soil and water samples were taken at eight different stages of plant growth, including before and after N basal and topdressing. Our study indicated that the processes underlying N changes {{in response to the}} timing of N fertilization were different depending on the N form. After <b>basal</b> <b>dressing</b> under aerobic conditions, both available and non-exchangeable NH 4 + contents were increased. Following the topdressing under flooded conditions, the available content of soil N increased, whereas the non-exchangeable NH 4 + content decreased. A negative relationship was found between soil pH and NH 4 + “fixation” when roots were active, and vice-versa. Elevated temperature alone or in combination with elevated [CO 2] had no effect on the total available N content in the soil and floodwater. Under elevated temperature, however, the non-exchangeable NH 4 + content was significantly reduced (11 %), with the same magnitude of change (10 %) observed under co-elevation of temperature and [CO 2]. These results suggested that non-exchangeable NH 4 + in paddy fields might be insensitive to [CO 2] elevation under Mediterranean conditions, while reductions observed under co-elevation of [CO 2] and temperature might be associated with temperature alone.

The rubber plant generally grows well in soils with a pH range between 4.0 and 6.5 (Bolton 1964; Krishnakumar and Potty 1992; Priyadarshan 2003). Application of compost and phosphate rock as the <b>basal</b> <b>dressing</b> has increased the soil pH from 4.37 to 5.30 and biochar application further increased the soil pH upto 6.25 (with 1 % biochar) and 6.58 (with 2 % biochar) immediately after mixing. However, {{by the end of the}} 8 -month experimental period, pH in no LF treatments ranged from 5.57 to 5.69 with no significant effect observed due to biochar application. Dharmakeerthi et al. (2010) observed that increase in soil pH due to timber mill waste charcoal remained high by about 1 pH units at the end of the nursery period, but without compost and phosphate rock as a basal application. Several others also have observed an increase in soil pH after mixing soils with biochar (Uzoma et al. 2011; Van Zwieten et al. 2010; Chan et al. 2007). When combined with chemical fertilizers, the increase in soil pH has been decreased significantly, almost down to the original soil value (Table 4), again with no significant difference due to biochar application. The decrease in pH could probably be due to the release of protons from NH 4 + during nitrification in sulfate of ammonia added treatments, and even due to reduced K and/or Ca concentrations in the soil due to high plant uptake (Wallace 1994). Zhang et al. (2007) observed that decrease in K and Ca in a rubber growing Ferrosol in China has decreased soil pH significantly. Increased cation uptake can decrease pH in the rhizosphere soils (Riley and Barber 1971). However this finding is contrary to findings of others (Uzoma et al. 2011; Van Zwieten et al. 2010; Chan et al. 2007) who have observed that the increase in soil pH in biochar amended soils remained high till the end of experiment even when fertilizers were applied. The differences could be attributed to the much shorter experimental period of less than 3 months compared to this study, type of fertilizers used or may even be due to the differences in pH buffer capacities. Our findings suggest that application of high alkali rubber wood biochar will not have any lasting effect on pH of this soil when applied together with sulphate of ammonia as the N source. In fact, this is essential given the fact that Mn content in this soil is very low and maintaining an acidic pH is needed to supply Mn requirement of the plant (Kalpage and Silva 1968), if not supplied as a chemical fertilizer.|$|E

At the world level, Tamil Nadu ranks first in yield, with 28. 7 t/ha, as compared to the Indian average of 22. 8 and a world average of 9. 6 t/ha. In Tamil Nadu cassava is grown mainly in Salem and Kanyakumari districts located in the dry western zone (60 % irrigated and 40 % rainfall) and the high rainfall southern zone (mostly rainfed), respectively. The area under cassava is increasing in other districts of Tamil Nadu as well. With respect to varieties, about 50 % of the total area is grown with high-yielding varieties, like H- 226 and MVD- 1 in most areas of Salem district, and with Co- 1, Co- 2, Co- 3 in different parts of Tamil Nadu. Locally adapted and traditional varieties, like Burma and Malabar, are still under cultivation, but they are low yielding and susceptible to cassava mosaic disease. The cassava germplasm collection has now increased to 480 accessions, including some CIAT clones. Two early maturing clones were identified, i. e., H- 1 19 from CTCRI, Trivandrum, and Co- 3 developed by Tamil Nadu Agr. Univ. in Coimbatore. The crop duration is 7 1 / 2 to 8 months with a high yield of 32 and 35 t/ha, respectively, and a starch content of about 30 %. For the high rainfall zone of Kanyakumari district, the local clone Adukkumuttan performs well, giving a 15 to 28 % increase in yield compared to the released varieties. For coastal areas of South Arcot district, two clones, i. e. ME- 46 and ME- 10, were shown to be better, with a yield of 44 t/ha; these are now under further evaluation. Under the Asian cassava breeding network a total number of 85 hybrid progenies were received from CIAT/Colombia and the Thai-CIAT program. Preliminary evaluation has indicated that a few clones have high root yields of more than 5 kg/plant, high starch content of over 35 %, field tolerance to mosaic virus and a shorter crop duration of 7 to 8 months. The optimum fertilizer rate for Co- 3 cassava under irrigated conditions was found to be 60 : 60 : 120 kg N-P 2 O 5 -KO/ha, which increased the yields by 36 % over the control. For the recently developed short-duration clones, like H- 1 19, CI- 590 and S- 856, under irrigated conditions the optimum spacing and fertilizer requirements are 75 x 75 cm and 75 : 25 : 75 kg N-P 2 O 5 -K 2 O/ha, respectively.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2007. Low soil {{nitrogen}} (N) {{and drought}} impede maize {{production in the}} small-scale farming sector in Zambia; and adoption of new cultivars with improved tolerance might enhance production. This study: a) assessed farmer preferences for maize cultivars; b) determined genotype x environment interaction effects among popular maize cultivars under contrasting soil fertility levels and; c) investigated landraces for tolerance to low N and drought using S 1 selection. The study {{was carried out in}} Zambia from 2004 - 07. Farmer preference influencing the adoption of maize cultivars was investigated using both formal and informal surveys in Luangwa, Chibombo and Lufwanyama rural districts representing the three agro-ecological regions of Zambia. Focus group discussions and personal interviews were used to collect data on issues that affected maize production in these areas. It has been found that although farmers perceived landraces to be low yielding, they believed that they were superior to improved cultivars for: tolerance to drought; tolerance to low soil fertility; grain palatability; grain storability; and poundability. The need for food security, their inability to apply fertiliser, and their need for drought tolerant cultivars significantly (p ≤ 0. 05) influenced farmers in adopting cultivars. The farmers would readily adopt cultivars that address these concerns. The predominant use of certain landraces (76 %) reflected their superiority in meeting some of these needs. The performance of nine popular cultivars (three for each of hybrids, OPVs and landraces) under contrasting levels of soil fertility, across six environments (ENVs) in the three agro-eological regions, was evaluated. An ENV was defined as season x location combination. The fertilizer treatments were full fertilization, <b>basal</b> <b>dressing,</b> top dressing and nil fertilization. The cultivars exhibited significant non-crossover type of genotype x fertilisation interaction effects at three ENVs, while the genotype x fertilisation interaction effects, were non-significant at the other three ENVs. The cultivars exhibited dynamic stability by increasing grain yield (GY) when fertilization was increased. Landraces yielded higher than all open pollinated varieties and were generally higher yielding than two hybrids. Based on average rank for GY, the five highest yielding cultivars were MRI 724, Gankata, MM 603, Kazungula and Pandawe. Superiority of landraces revealed their genetic potential for GY under low soil fertility and they should be used as germplasm in developing cultivars targeting such environments. Ninety-six local landraces were selfed to generate S 1 lines (2004 / 05 season) which were crossed to a tester (2005 / 06 season). Testcrosses were evaluated under optimal, low N, and drought conditions (2006 / 07 season). Data on GY, anthesis-silking interval, number of ears per plant, leaf senescence, leaf rolling, tassel size and grain texture were recorded in all the trials during the study period. Testcrosses, their S 1 parents and landraces that were superior under low N, drought, optimal conditions and across environments were identified; these should be used to develop varieties targeted to a particular environment. Selection for tolerance to drought also selected for tolerance to low N. Selection for low N tolerance also selected for GY under drought and optimal conditions. Therefore, in selecting for tolerance to abiotic stresses, use of optimal and managed stress environments was effective. The following landraces were superior at 10 % selection intensity: LR 38, LR 84 and LR 86 (optimal, low N and drought conditions); LR 11, LR 35 and LR 76 (low N and drought conditions); LR 12 (optimal and drought conditions); LR 40 and LR 93 (low N conditions only); LR 79 (drought conditions only) and; LR 74 and LR 85 (optimal conditions only). These landraces should be used as source germplasm targeting respective environments. Significant (p ≤ 0. 05) positive general combining ability effects for GY under both low N and drought conditions were found implying that additive gene action conditioned GY under the abiotic stresses. The heritability for GY under low N (0. 38), and drought (0. 17) conditions, was low suggesting that selection based on GY alone was not effective. The genetic correlation for GY between optimal, and either low N (rG= 0. 458), or drought (rG = 0. 03) environments, was low (rG < 0. 5) suggesting that indirect selection would not be effective either. Therefore, use of secondary traits for selection is discussed. The study established that most farmers depended on local landraces for seed and would adopt low input improved varieties that yield higher than the landraces. Some landraces were found superior to some improved cultivars under contrasting fertilisation regimes. The study also found that landraces had genetic variation for tolerance to low N and drought. Landraces, S 1 lines and testcrosses superior under low N, drought, optimal conditions and across environments were selected and they should be used to develop cultivars targeting respective environments. Policy implications of these results are discussed...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} experiments, using both field trial and pot trial techniques, were {{undertaken}} {{to investigate the}} effect of N addition at high rates on the growth and nutrition of radiata pine. Two field trials were designed to investigate the effect of increasing rates of N addition on young radiate pine plantation (Taheke) growing in a fertile ex-pasture soil north east of Rotorua {{and the effect of}} increasing rates of N and B addition on young radiata pine growing in the nutritionally poorer soils of Ashley Forest in Canterbury. One pot trial in sand culture investigated the effect of N source on the growth of radiata pine seedlings while a further two pot trials investigated the effect of increasing N and B addition at two rates of P. In 1989 urea was added at 0, 250 or 500 kg N ha⁻¹ to enhance the mild stem deformities that had been observed in young radiata pine trees at the Taheke site. The soil had a high nutrient status, presumably because of its pastoral land-use history, a high potential to nitrify and the major form of inorganic N was nitrate. While the amount of radiata pine stem deformity did increase during the trial, this was not a result of the fertiliser addition. The measurements of tree height and diameter were also not significantly affected by N addition. Subsequent soil analysis indicated that the amount of native N in the top soil was already high, approximately 3. 1 and 1. 8 t ha⁻¹ in the 0 to 10 and 10 to 20 cm depths respectively, and therefore the fertiliser additions did not represent a large input to the system and the addition of N did not significantly affect the amount of total N% or mineral N in the soil. At Taheke, the increasing addition of N significantly increased the foliar concentrations of N in the short-term and significantly decreased the concentrations of P, Ca and Mg during the trial presumably as a result of dilution and/or translocation. There appeared to be a relationship between Cu and N, in the foliage, and the number of kinks in the upper stem of the radiata pine trees. As Cu:N ratios in the foliage increased, the number of kinks decreased. The characteristics of the trial site at Ashley Forest contrasted to those at Taheke because the soils had a low nutrient status, had a very low potential to nitrify and the major form of inorganic N was ammonium. The B status of the soil was also marginal for radiata pine growth. The fertiliser treatments consisted of N, added as urea, at 0, 200 or 400 kg N ha⁻¹ by B, added as ulexite, at 0, 3. 7 or 7. 4 kg ha⁻¹. The foliage sampling technique followed the life of fascicles from just after initiation in November, 1989, to full extension in May, 1990. The results showed that the concentrations and of amounts per fascicle of N and B significantly increased in response to the addition of the respective fertilisers while P and Mg significantly declined with increasing N addition. Retranslocation occurred for both P and B particularly during times of low soil moisture. The amount of retranslocation was increased with increasing N addition while the increasing addition of B reduced the amount of B retranslocation. The results indicated that without B addition the foliar concentrations of B were marginal (i. e. 8 to 12 µg g⁻¹) and were further reduced by the addition of N. This also occurred for P where the foliar concentrations were low (i. e. < 0. 12 %) and significantly declined with increasing N addition even though a <b>basal</b> <b>dressing</b> of 14 kg of P ha⁻¹ had been added. The addition of N increased fascicle weights, compared to the control, particularly at 200 kg N ha⁻¹, but had no significant effect on tree heights at 6 months or at 3 years after fertiliser addition. However, when twelve trees were biomassed 1 year after fertiliser addition at Ashley, the total above-ground weight of trees that had received 7. 4 kg B ha⁻¹ and/or 400 kg N ha⁻¹ was significantly greater then the control trees. The results from the biomass indicated that 3. 2 % of the added N and 0. 5 % of the added B was had been taken up into the above-ground portion of the tree. There was no evidence of residual fertiliser N in the soil, however the addition of B at 7. 4 kg ha⁻¹ had significantly increased the non-specifically adsorbed and specifically adsorbed soil B fractions in the 0 to 10 cm and 10 to 20 cm depths. The weed components at Ashley, mainly gorse and broom, may have been important sinks for the added fertiliser. A sand culture pot trial further investigated the effect of the inorganic N-source, either ammonium or nitrate, on the growth and nutrition of radiata pine seedlings. The results indicated that nitrate-N nutrition increased the uptake of cations, particularly Ca, Mg and Fe, while reducing the uptake of P. The roots of the nitrate-fed seedlings were darker in colour and were more numerously and finely branched than the ammonium-fed seedlings. Two sand culture pot trials, one at 4 µg P m 1 ⁻¹ and the other at 8 µg P m 1 ⁻¹, further investigated the interaction between the addition of ammonium (at rates of 14, 35 and 70 µg N ml⁻¹) and B (at rates 0. 01, 0. 05 and 0. 1 µg B m 1 ⁻¹) on radiata pine seedlings. Increasing N addition increased: N uptake, shoot dry weights, the dilution of nutrient concentrations in the shoots, the translocation of nutrients to the shoots, the efficiency of nutrient uptake by the roots, the physiological use efficiency of nutrients and the seedling height difference. The root dry weights decreased with increasing N addition. As B:N ratios declined in the shoots, with increasing N addition, the amount of seedling height difference (a simple measure of stem deformity) increased. The correlation was significant. The increasing addition of B, in the sand culture pot trials, increased seedling B concentrations and B:N ratios and the amount of B in the roots. Across the two ammonium by B pot trials, the higher addition of P affected radiata pine growth by increasing the amount of N in the shoots...|$|E

Distinctive differences were found particularly in the dry matter increase (ΔW), relative growth rate (RGR) and net assimilation rate (NAR). Several varieties always showed a higher value of ΔW for all nutrient levels. Also highly positive correlations were found between ΔW and RGR, RGR and NAR, and NAR and the nitrogen content per leaf area (NCLA), while being highly significantly negative between NAR and SLA, and NCLA and SLA for all nutrient levels. However, NAR did not correlate with the nitrogen content per leaf dry weight (NCLW). Based on these results, NCLA was specified as a very important factor related to various differences in the growth rate. Consequently, it was concluded that the high ability to increase NCLA {{is one of the most}} important characteristics for high growth rate at lower nutrient levels, as well as at higher levels where SLA has a tendency to increase. However, neither ecotypes nor the growth type corresponded with these characteristics. II. Types of the Fundamental Growth Response During the Seedling Stage Fundamental growth response to fertilizer and low- and high-fertilizer-response characteristics in rice plants were examined using 35 rice varieties of different ecotypes and growth types, which were grown until the 8. 5 -leaf stage under seven levels of nutrient concentrations of the Kimura B culture solution. Though various differences in the response of RGR to fertilizers were not observed clearly before the 6. 5 -leaf stage, four types of responses were observed during the following grown stage. They were based on the changes in the specific leaf area (SLA) and nitrogen content per leaf area (NCLA), which showed four typical patterns to the nutrient levels. The critical concentration of the nutrients and response intensity with the increase in nutrient concentration in the types of RGR response to fertilization indicated the concentration of culture solution which SLA increase depressed and the degree of NCLA increase, respectively. Moreover, it was clarified that change in SLA and NCLA affected the photosynthetic rate of a single leaf with a change in CO 2 diffusion resistance through the stomata and in the mesophyll. On the other hand, three patterns to nutrient level were observed in nitrogen content per leaf dry weight (NCLW). These results show that both high NCLW and NCLA under a low nutrient level, being found to a small extent in indica rice, are important characteristics for low-fertilizer-response varieties, while higher stable RGR with a small increase of SLA under a high nutrient level, being seen in most of japonica rice, is for high-fertilizer-response ones. As a result of simulation in case SLA did not change in three various groups which SLA was easy to increase and NCLA was hard to increase, it was presumed that the production efficiency increased by 30 - 40 ％. Then, utility of heightening NCLA without SLA increase was pointed out. III. Various Differences in Morphological Change in Leaf Blade by Different Nutrient Concentrations of the Culture solution in Rice seedlings To clarify the internal leaf morphology concerned with various differences in specific leaf area (SLA) response to concentrations of a culture solution during the seedling stage, various differences in leaf morphological change with the advance of leaf position and in the response of leaf morphogenesis to nutrient concentrations were investigated. Vascular bundle number (VBN) in the transverse section of leaf blade and leaf width increased as the position advanced, but VBN did not increase with leaf width. Increase in leaf length with the advance in position was greatest in NNN-type wherein the nitrogen content per leaf area (NCLA) increased but SLA did not increase as the nutrient concentration increased. The increase in VBN and leaf width in NNN-type were less than the others. However, Dular was an exception, which was a variety in SSN-type wherein SLA increased with the nutrient concentration, the VBN did not increase with the nutrient concentration and was much more than others for all concentrations. In the relationship between leaf width and length, leaf area expansion of NNN-type depended on leaf length, but others depended on the leaf width increase. From these results, it become clear that SLA increased when fertilization was heavily applied in the varieties having many VBN by nature, and showing a remarkable increase of VBN in response to the increase in fertilizer. Then, presumably, to improve efficiently rice productive ability in connection with fertilization, it is important that varieties have certain characteristics, i. e. VBN and leaf width do not increase, leaf area expansion depending on the increase in leaf length, and moreover, leaves remain erect even under heavy fertilization. IV. Effect of the High Nitrogen Treatment Prior to Transplanting on the Growth and Yield in Rice The effect of temporally high N application was investigated to develop a fertilization method that increase the N content per leaf area (NCLA) without increasing of specific leaf area. The change in N content of the seedlings treated with high N concentration (230, 1150, 2300, 4600, 11500 and 23000 ppm) for 12 - 48 hrs, the effect of this treatment prior to transplanting on the growth and yield were analyzed. The result showed that the treatment with 2300 ppmN for 12 hrs did not affect leaf thickness, but increased NCLA by 40 %. Seedlings pretreated and planted to a lower level of the <b>basal</b> <b>dressing</b> showed remarkable enhancement of net assimilation rate, relative growth rate (RGR) and relative leaf growth rate. As a result of the measurement of the photosynthetic and respiration rates in plants, an increase in the photosynthetic rate with this treatment was confirmed. From the result of field trial under a lower level of soil fertility, various differences were detected in this treatment, such as a dry matter increased of 5 - 90 %, tiller number increased of 10 - 90 % during the early stage of growth. However, this treatment had no effect on plant length for any of varieties. It was considered that this treatment influenced growth directly for 3 weeks, due to the change in RGR. Moreover, increased tillers were lower order ones which were to be productive tillers, clearly, the increasing of tiller number caused a yield increase through an increase in the spikelet number per hill...|$|E
40|$|Malawi?s paprika {{producers}} needing help Cue: High value cash crops, are usually, by definition, {{difficult to}} grow. If they were easy, {{everyone would be}} growing them, and they {{would no longer be}} of high value. For example, some high value crops can only be grown in glasshouses, or in very carefully managed conditions, with a heavy investment of inputs such as fertilizers, chemical fungicides or pesticides. Only farmers who have the expertise to manage these inputs, and the plants themselves, in an efficient and effective manner, can expect to get good yields and earn the high prices that the crops can fetch. For small scale farmers, such management can be extremely difficult - which is why high value crops tend to be grown by larger, commercial farmers. In Malawi, however, the growing of paprika is now becoming popular with even fairly small scale farmers, as an alternative to tobacco, a crop which has suffered in recent years from a falling market price. But there are some serious challenges facing Malawi?s paprika growers, not only growing the crop, but getting a good price from the buyers. Excello Zidana found out more when he spoke to Lyson Nkhukhuzalira, General Manager of the Paprika Association of Malawi. IN:		?Paprika just like any other crop requires enough rain? OUT:		? rocking the market at the moment. ? DUR?N		 5 ? 28 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Lyson Nkhukhuzalira, General Manager of the Paprika Association of Malawi. Transcript Lyson	Paprika just like any other crop requires enough rain, requires good soils. And paprika does well in the sandy loam soils. Why sandy loam soils? Paprika requires soils that can actually drain water away. If the soils can retain the water then paprika will not do well because it is also prone to diseases. If you talk in terms of pH it has to be between 6. 5 to 7. 0 pH. These are the kind of situations where paprika can best be grown. Acidic soils are no good for paprika. Alkaline soils are no good for paprika. In our situation I should mention here and repeat that wherever burley tobacco is doing very well paprika will do the same. Excello	What are the recommended varieties of paprika which are grown in this region? Lyson	Well southern Africa being the region that depends on rainfed situations, varieties that are recommended are actually what we call Papriqueen, it is a sweet variety. There is ?UF 5 ?, it is also a sweet variety and there is ?Brine 3 ? it is also a sweet variety. These crops are forgiving crops. When the rains are coming and you happen to have a dry spell like 2005 these crops should still be able to harvest quality paprika. Excello	Any enterprise has got its own problems. What are the major problems associated with the paprika production? Lyson	Predominantly it is inputs. If we talk of inputs we are talking of fertiliser and chemicals. Farmers could manage to buy maybe a bag of fertiliser, <b>basal</b> <b>dressing</b> and fail to buy top dressing fertiliser. If they fail to do that, you find that the crop will not do well, pods will drop down. On the other hand if the farmer manages to have these two fertilisers but he does not buy the chemicals, the fungicides in particular and pesticides, again the farmer is the loser. So the major challenge that faces the Malawi nation in this smallholder sub-sector at the moment, is actually input acquisition, and if anything, subsidy is an issue that can bail Malawians out of this mess. The other challenge that is coupled to this is that the current buyers {{do not seem to be}} straightforward. When they are buying the paprika they will tell you this paprika is of low quality, just because we do not have the machinery in Malawi to determine the quality of the paprika produced in Malawi. This is a challenge. If anything, we actually need to have our own paprika laboratory in Malawi that should be able to tell the quality of Malawi paprika. Excello		Which countries in the world import paprika from Africa? Lyson	Predominantly Spain is the major importer of paprika in the whole world. In Spain you have all sorts of factories or processing machines that can actually extract the oil which is the culinary agent, why paprika is grown, and they can also make good spices out of it. Excello	What are the prices like? Are farmers very happy with the prices Spain and other countries are offering on the crop? Lyson	My history or my experience tells me that the buyers across there, overseas, they pay very well but these other brokers, because they want to make money, sometimes they actually rip the farmers off. But over the years prices are improving every time, and we can even see on the website what kind of prices are being offered by the Spaniards or whosoever is importing paprika from this region. Excello	Since many countries are campaigning that tobacco should be completely phased out, how would you look at paprika? Is it really fitting to come in in the place of tobacco? Lyson	Paprika has to come in as a supplement so that where tobacco is failing farmers should have similar returns through paprika production. Paprika alone cannot really replace tobacco, because tobacco it is a huge production quota compared to paprika. Excello	Finally let?s look at the market. If you will look at the paprika do we have market? Lyson	The demands that we are sitting on at the moment are amounting to 15 million kilograms but Malawi can hardly produce one million kilograms. We have five buyers in a row now, the competition is high for this year for Malawi paprika simply because Malawi paprika is sweet and is of high quality. As such the competition is high. Regarding market Malawi paprika will never have no market in this world because we have a quota that we are not even filling. That is why other buyers are now flocking to Malawi to say ?Where is Malawi paprika that is known for being sweet and of good quality?? Excello	So is there any organisation that is linking up all the countries in maybe SADC or maybe some countries in Africa on this enterprise, paprika? Lyson	Well all I can see now is that they are loose entities scattered all over. Because you talk of Zimbabwe they grow on their own. You talk about South Africa they grow on their own. You talk of Malawi, Zambia, just like that. I believe there is a need that we have an international body that should link up all these countries just like the way tobacco is with the ITG. I think through that way we should be able to have a good voice and at the same time silence all the croakers that are actually rocking the market at the moment. End of track.
