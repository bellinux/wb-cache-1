5|$|In {{the second}} part, David devotes {{chapters}} to recipes for {{various forms of}} <b>baking.</b> <b>Bread</b> comes first, followed by recipes for, among many other things, buns, yeast cakes, soda-bread, brioches, croissants, pain au chocolat, and pizza. As in her earlier books, the recipes are interspersed with excerpts from earlier authors, including Fernand Braudel, Auguste Escoffier, and the painter John Constable.|$|E
5|$|With computer-generated imagery {{looking to}} make up {{so much of the}} commercial, Kleinman {{attempted}} to use film of real elements wherever possible. To this end, 200 mudskippers were brought to the studio from South Africa for the final scene, arriving via Singapore. An entire afternoon was set aside for filming the mudskipper sequence. The footage obtained formed the major part of the final cut of the scene, with only one or two post-production changes: the addition of tail fins and animation of the expression of disgust that closes the piece. Stop motion footage of other real elements was taken, including a stage-by-stage blowtorching of plants, used to show flora coming back to life in the reverse sequence, and shots of <b>baking</b> <b>bread,</b> used to model the geological changes to background rock formations. Additional real elements were to have been incorporated into the commercial, mostly from stock footage of several animal species, but only short segments of apes and lizards appeared in the final cut.|$|E

25|$|Historian Victor Dupuis {{attributed}} the French defeat to the inactivity of the Army of the Ardennes and to Desjardin's mistaken {{belief that he}} was outnumbered when he actually had a superiority of 35,000 to 22,000 men over Kaunitz. While Charbonnier was busy <b>baking</b> <b>bread,</b> Desjardin's shoeless and badly-clothed men, lacking heavy artillery and with damp gunpowder were making a frontal attack on a well-organized defensive position covered by the repeated charges of the Austrian cavalry. Duhesme wrote that Jacob's division might {{have been used to}} turn the Coalition flank but instead it remained inert.|$|E
25|$|Pollen {{analyses}} {{confirms the}} Iron Age as {{a period of}} intense deforestation in Galicia and Northern Portugal, with meadows and fields expanding {{at the expense of}} woodland. Using three main type of tools, ploughs, sickles and hoes, together with axes for woodcutting, the Castro inhabitants grew a number of cereals: (wheat, millet, possibly also rye) for <b>baking</b> <b>bread,</b> as well as oats and barley which they also used for beer production. They also grew beans, peas and cabbage, and flax for fabric and clothes production; other vegetables where collected: nettle, watercress. Large quantities of acorns have been found hoarded in most hill-forts, as they were used for bread production once toasted and crushed in granite stone mills.|$|E
25|$|Taíno {{groups in}} the more {{developed}} islands, such as Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, and Jamaica, relied more on agriculture (farming and other jobs). Fields for important root crops, such as the staple yuca, were prepared by heaping up mounds of soil, called conucos. This improved soil drainage and fertility as well as delaying erosion, allowing for longer storage of crops in the ground. Less important crops such as corn were raised in simple clearings created by slash and burn technique. Typically, conucos were three feet high and nine feet in circumference and were arranged in rows. The primary root crop was yuca/cassava, a woody shrub cultivated for its edible and starchy tuberous root. It was planted using a coa, a kind of hoe made completely from wood. Women processed the poisonous variety of cassava by squeezing it to extract the toxic juices. Then they would grind the roots into flour for <b>baking</b> <b>bread.</b> Batata (sweet potato) was the next most important root crop.|$|E

50|$|In <b>baking</b> <b>breads,</b> {{cakes and}} cookies, sodium {{aluminum}} sulfate (SAS) {{is used as}} an ingredient in baking powder as a second acting agent. SAS is activated at baking temperatures and reacts with baking powder's sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) to create carbon dioxide gas bubbles that helps leaven the baked items. The uses of SAS is seen by some consumers as a health concern.|$|R

25|$|The French {{offensive}} {{began on}} 10 May with an advance on the Sambre. By the 12th Kaunitz had withdrawn his forces from Merbes-le-Château into an intrenched position between Binche {{on the left}} and Grand-Reng on the right. In the Battle of Grandreng on 13 May, Muller and Despeaux assaulted Kaunitz's right flank, Fromentin attacked his center and the garrison of Maubeuge mounted a diversion. Austrian cavalry defeated Fromentin's division, then commanded by Duhesme after its commander was injured. Kaunitz counterattacked and compelled Desjardin to retreat to the south bank of the Sambre. The French suffered the loss of 4,000 men and 12 artillery pieces while Coalition losses numbered 2,800 killed, wounded and captured. During the fighting, the Army of the Ardennes divisions were inactive, leaving Desjardin's 35,000 men to fight Kaunitz's 22,000 Austrian and Dutch troops in a strong position. Screened by a handful of enemies, Jacob's division did not help though it was nearby at Buverinnes. Marceau's division, accompanied by Charbonnier in person, was at Fontaine-l'Évêque <b>baking</b> <b>bread!</b> After Desjardin's withdrawal, Charbonnier's two idle divisions quickly followed suit.|$|E

40|$|Background: Students are {{challenged}} to make healthy and independent food choices. Unhealthy diets {{can increase the}} risk of non-communicable diseases, which constitutes a public health concern. Universities represents an arena for interventions to promote healthy dietary habits. Aim: To investigate the effect of a <b>bread</b> <b>baking</b> intervention on (1) baking habits, (2) changes in motivation for <b>bread</b> <b>baking</b> and (3) assess if there was a correlation between changes in <b>bread</b> <b>baking</b> habits and motivation among university students. Method: Students (18 - 43 years of age, 65 % women) was randomized into an intervention group (n= 21) or control group (n= 25). The intervention group was given a <b>bread</b> recipe, <b>baking</b> equipment and were encouraged to bake whole grain bread, during the four weeks’ intervention period. Baking habits and motivation were measured with questionnaires; at baseline, after two- and four weeks. Self-determination theory was used to evaluate motivation, and these statistical tests were used: Friedman, Mann-Whitney U, Wilcoxon, Spearman and Pearson Chi-square. Results: Significant differences in <b>bread</b> <b>baking</b> between the groups at the second (p< 0, 001) and third (p= 0, 006) time point was shown. There were no significant changes in motivation in the intervention group, however a moderate, positive correlation (p= 0, 01) between the changes in <b>bread</b> <b>baking</b> habits and motivation was identified. Conclusion: The intervention was effective in increasing whole grain <b>bread</b> <b>baking</b> among students, at least in short term. However, it was not sufficiently effective in increasing motivation for <b>bread</b> <b>baking,</b> however a correlation between changes in motivation and <b>bread</b> <b>baking</b> was observed.

2500|$|These volumes {{come from}} a period when luxury books of hours for the wealthy were {{produced}} for their artistic and decorative effect.

[...] He decorated his borders with beautiful trompe l’oeil depictions of nature: mussels, fruit, birds, fish, and more. [...] The Master also depicts man-made beauty, such as jewelry, tiles, coins, and furniture. [...] These border decorations would greatly influence the Master of Mary of Burgundy.

Some [...] was occupied by the single, large mudbrick building that was excavated by Langdon, and where the clay tablets were found. In and around this building, kilns for firing pottery and <b>baking</b> <b>bread</b> were found, and other crafts like weaving. Many of these crafts, and also agricultural production, feature prominently in the proto-cuneiform tablets – indicating {{that much of the}} economy was centrally controlled and administered. In the texts from Jemdet Nasr, the term [...] "SANGA AB" [...] appears, which may denote a high official. The building was probably destroyed by fire. There is no evidence for far-reaching trade-contacts; no precious stones or other exotic materials were found. However, the homogeneity of the pottery that is typical for the Jemdet Nasr period suggests that there must have been intensive regional contacts. This idea is strengthened by the finding of sealings on the tablets of Jemdet Nasr that list a number of cities in southern Mesopotamia, including Larsa, Nippur, Ur, Uruk and Tell Uqair.|$|E
