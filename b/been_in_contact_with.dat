5|$|By early February {{the program}} coding {{switched}} from legal pads to the PDP-10 and a preliminary version {{was completed by}} March 1975. Gates and Allen had <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> Roberts and MITS and the older looking Paul Allen would travel to Albuquerque in March. MITS needed more {{time to get a}} computer with 7k bytes of memory working, and they needed more time to get the software finished. When Allen arrived at MITS it took a day to get the software running; Allen remembers this being caused by computer memory problems while Roberts remembers the delay was due to software problems.|$|E
5|$|Less {{than three}} weeks before the primary, Comer's former girlfriend told the Courier-Journal in a letter that Comer had abused her {{physically}} and mentally in 1991 and that he had accompanied her to an abortion clinic. Other newspapers, including the Lexington Herald-Leader, which citied the Courier-Journal, then reported the allegations. The Lexington Herald-Leader had reported earlier that the Lexington-area blogger who had been publishing stories about the allegations for months had <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> the husband of Heiner's running mate, K.

His parents divorced when he was seven. McAvoy's mother suffered from poor health and subsequently decided it was best that he live with his maternal grandparents, Mary and James Johnstone, a butcher {{who lived in a}} terraced council house in the nearby Drumchapel area of Glasgow. His mother lived with them intermittently. McAvoy has a sister, Joy, and a younger half-brother, Donald.

5|$|Musical {{instruments}} {{used by the}} Egyptian culture before 2700 BC bore striking {{similarity to}} those of Mesopotamia, leading historians {{to conclude that the}} civilizations must have <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> one another. Sachs notes that Egypt did not possess any instruments that the Sumerian culture did not also possess. However, by 2700 BC the cultural contacts seem to have dissipated; the lyre, a prominent ceremonial instrument in Sumer, did not appear in Egypt for another 800 years. Clappers and concussion sticks appear on Egyptian vases as early as 3000 BC. The civilization also made use of sistra, vertical flutes, double clarinets, arched and angular harps, and various drums.|$|E
5|$|On 20 June 2010, 611 C3 Picassos built between January and March 2010 were {{recalled}} due to incorrectly routed fuel pipes, {{which were}} believed to have <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> the heat shield. This fault may have caused chafing and {{may lead to a}} fuel leak. The models were built between January and March 2010 and were sold in the UK. On 24 August 2010, all 13,234 Picassos sold in the UK were recalled because the windscreen trim could deteriorate, and could eventually detach, leading to a loose-fitting windscreen.|$|E

After leaving Kaminsky, Incanto finds and kills Monica in his apartment after she discovers Cross' body in his bathtub. When Jessie asks Incanto about her mother's whereabouts, he denies seeing her. However, Jessie smells her mother's perfume in Incanto's apartment and calls the police. When they arrive, Incanto is gone, but his computer gives a list of women he has <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with.</b> After trying to contact each woman in the given list, only two are unreachable, one being Kaminsky.|$|E

5|$|Schmid {{declined}} {{a contract}} offer from Columbus after the 2008 season and became coach of Seattle Sounders FC. The Crew's ownership believed that Schmid had <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> Sounders FC despite being denied permission {{to talk to}} other teams during the season. It was also alleged that he shared confidential information with Seattle after his contract with the Crew had ended. The MLS ruled that no tampering had occurred, but ordered Sounders FC to financially compensate the Crew.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} a number of {{documented}} cases in which a female shark who has not <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> a male has conceived a sharklet on her own through parthenogenesis. The details of this process are not well understood, but genetic fingerprinting showed that the sharklets had no paternal genetic contribution, ruling out sperm storage. The extent of this behavior in the wild is unknown, as is whether other species have this capability. Mammals are now the only major vertebrate group in which asexual reproduction has not been observed.|$|E
5|$|Cranmer's eucharistic views, {{which had}} already moved away from {{official}} Catholic doctrine, received another push from Continental reformers. Cranmer had <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> Martin Bucer since the time when initial contacts were made with the Schmalkaldic League. However, Cranmer and Bucer's relationship became ever closer due to Charles V's victory over the League at Mühlberg, which left England as the sole major nation that gave sanctuary to persecuted reformers. Cranmer {{wrote a letter to}} Bucer (now lost) with questions on eucharistic theology. In Bucer's reply dated 28 November 1547, he denied the corporeal real presence and condemned transubstantiation and the adoration of the elements. The letter was delivered to Cranmer by two Italian reformed theologians, Peter Martyr and Bernardino Ochino who were invited to take refuge in England. Martyr also brought with him an epistle written allegedly by John Chrysostom (now regarded as a forgery), Ad Caesarium Monachum, which appeared to provide patristic support against the corporeal real presence. These documents were to influence Cranmer's thoughts on the eucharist.|$|E

5|$|Gilbert surveils Watts, {{finding that}} the latter has <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> Means. Black travels to where Means is living, where he {{remotely}} observes a cult-like ceremony in which Means is ritually inducted into the Group. He contacts Watts, divulging {{the results of his}} tests—they were injected with a vaccine while quarantined. Black warns Watts that the Group is dangerous; Watts neither confirms nor denies this, but predicts the arrival of an earthquake, urging Black that should this prediction come to pass, he should accept full membership of the Group. That night, Black answers a telephone call from Means, who tells him that the Group mean no harm. The line suddenly cuts, and the tremors of an earthquake begin just as Watts had predicted. Black moves through his home, noticing that his pet bird is dead in its cage, covered in blood.|$|E
5|$|In April 1918, {{after the}} German-Russian Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, Austrian Foreign Minister Count Ottokar Czernin {{made a speech}} attacking {{incoming}} French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau as being the main obstacle to a peace favouring the Central Powers. Clemenceau was incensed and, after seeing the Emperor Charles's letter of 24 March 1917, had it published. For a while, the life of Sixtus {{appeared to be in}} danger, and there were even fears that Germany might occupy Austria. Czernin persuaded Charles to send a 'Word of Honour' to Austria's allies saying that Sixtus had not been authorised to show the letter to the French Government, that Belgium had not been mentioned, and that Clemenceau had lied about the mentioning of Alsace. Czernin had actually <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> the German Embassy throughout the whole crisis and attempted to persuade the Emperor to step down because of the Affair. After failing to do so, Czernin resigned as Foreign Minister.|$|E
5|$|People in the Vanni districts {{considered}} themselves separate from Tamils of the Jaffna peninsula {{but the two}} groups did intermarry. Most of these married couples moved into the Vanni districts where land was available. Vanni consists {{of a number of}} highland settlements within forested lands using irrigation tank-based cultivation. An 1890 census listed 711 such tanks in this area. Hunting and raising livestock such as water buffalo and cattle is a necessary adjunct to the agriculture. The Tamil-inhabited Vanni consists of the Vavuniya, Mullaitivu, and eastern Mannar districts. Historically, the Vanni area has <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> what is now South India, including during the medieval period (see Vanniar). Northern Tamils follow customary laws called Thesavalamai, codified during the Dutch colonial period.|$|E
