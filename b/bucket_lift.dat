25|$|MARTA {{has had two}} fatal {{accidents}} {{which resulted}} in a formal investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board. On February 25, 2000 a train near Avondale station struck two automatic train control technicians who were inspecting a relay box; one was fatally injured and the other technician suffered serious injuries. The workers had failed to apply for a safe clearance restriction for the track work. In addition, the rail system center controller, who was aware of the workers, failed to notify train drivers of the technicians' presence. A second accident occurred on April 10, 2000 when a train struck a <b>bucket</b> <b>lift</b> containing two contract workers at Lenox station; the workers were fatally injured. Although the MARTA employee who was accompanying the workers notified the rail control center of the work over the track, the control center employee failed to block off the section of the track in the automated rail control system and also failed to notify the unscheduled southbound train of the workers' presence. In 2001 MARTA settled with the families of the two killed workers for US$10.5million.|$|E

60|$|Ten {{minutes later}} they saw two heads appear above, and {{instantly}} withdrew their {{feet from the}} bucket and made a stroke to the side, which was but four feet distant, being careful as they did that no motion was imparted to the rope.

50|$|Until {{the early}} 20th century, {{concrete}} was mixed {{on the job}} site and transported from the cement mixer to the formwork, either in wheelbarrows or in <b>buckets</b> <b>lifted</b> by cranes. This required {{a lot of time}} and labor. In 1927, the German engineers Max Giese and Fritz Hull came upon the idea of pumping concrete through pipes. They pumped concrete to a height of 38 m and a distance of 120 m. Shortly after, a concrete pump was patented in Holland in 1932 by Jacob Cornelius Kweimn (Jacobus Cornelius Kooijman). This patent incorporated the developer's previous German patent.|$|R

60|$|So saying, Marco {{took up the}} <b>bucket,</b> <b>lifted</b> {{it gently}} over the side, and let it down slowly by the rope into the water. There was a knot {{in the end of}} the rope; and Marco held the knot firmly in his hand, so as to draw up the bucket by means of it, as soon as he should get it full. He found, however, that, {{although}} he could let the pail down easily enough, it was no easy matter to dip up any water into it; for the rope, being fastened to the bail or handle, kept the handle, and of course the open part of the pail, upwards, so that the water could not run in. If Marco let the rope down more, the pail, being light, would not sink, but skipped along upon the surface of the water, drawn by the motion of the steamboat.|$|R
50|$|On the Delaware Division canal, the Delaware River {{was made}} to pump its own water into the canal, using an {{undershot}} water wheel which was connected to another wheel which had <b>buckets</b> attached, thereby <b>lifting</b> the river water up to the canal.|$|R
50|$|In a Genroku period yōkai tale {{told about}} in the Kuroe part of Kainan, Wakayama Prefecture, {{it is said that}} a certain old tree would have {{something}} shining at its base when passer-bys would look, and when someone would reach out to it thinking that it was a koban (coin), they would get dragged into a <b>bucket</b> and <b>lifted</b> up to above the tree where they would be menaced and then devoured by the tsurube-otoshi living there, finally losing their life as they strike the ground.|$|R
50|$|Treadmills as muscle powered engines {{originated}} roughly 4000 years ago. Their {{primary use}} was to <b>lift</b> <b>buckets</b> of water.

2500|$|The term {{work was}} {{introduced}} in 1826 by the French mathematician Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis as [...] "weight lifted through a height", {{which is based on}} the use of early steam engines to <b>lift</b> <b>buckets</b> of water out of flooded ore mines. The SI unit of work is the joule (J).|$|R

50|$|On {{the surface}} above the shaft stands a {{building}} {{known as the}} headframe. This contained a wheel called a gin wheel which <b>lifted</b> <b>buckets</b> of rock up to a raised platform called a Brace. Wheeled buckets then carried the rock along elevated tracks to waste dumps or processing works. The steel cable that hoisted the bucket passed over the gin wheel.|$|R
50|$|In early designs {{the coal}} {{would still be}} shovelled by the fireman into a hopper which would feed into a crusher and then a screw or <b>bucket</b> {{elevator}} would <b>lift</b> the pulverised coal to a position where it could be mechanically scattered across the burning coals of the furnace by a spreader. The spreader could be jets of steam, mechanical arms, or a fast rotating plate.|$|R
5000|$|The {{mine was}} opened by the Cyprus Anvil Mining Corporation in 1969, which {{was formed to}} mine the deposit. From the late 1960s until 1982 the mine {{became one of the}} largest lead-zinc mines in the world. At one time it was the largest open-pit mine in the world. During its history, 320 million tonnes of waste rock was removed to access the ore. The mine {{remained}} in more-or-less constant production until 1982. Trucks carried the ore concentrate from the mill by highway to Whitehorse, where the <b>buckets</b> were <b>lifted</b> from the trucks and lowered onto cars of the White Pass and Yukon Route railway. The trains took the buckets another 106 miles to Skagway, Alaska, where the contents were poured out into the holds of ships.|$|R

50|$|Alternatively, a {{grapple fork}} {{may be used}} to lift and {{transport}} large round bales. The grapple fork is a hydraulically driven implement attached {{to the end of a}} tractor's bucket loader. When the hydraulic cylinder is extended, the fork clamps downward toward the bucket, much like a closing hand. To move a large round bale, the tractor approaches the bale from the side and places the bucket underneath the bale. The fork is then clamped down across the top of the bale, and the <b>bucket</b> is <b>lifted</b> with the bale in tow. Grab hooks installed on the bucket of a tractor are another tool used to handle round bales, and be done by a farmer with welding skills by welding two hooks and a heavy chain to the outside top of a tractor front loader bucket.|$|R
50|$|In {{a typical}} cycle of excavation, the bucket is {{positioned}} above {{the material to}} be excavated. The bucket is then lowered and the dragrope is then drawn so that the bucket is dragged along {{the surface of the}} material. The <b>bucket</b> is then <b>lifted</b> by using the hoist rope. A swing operation is then performed to move the bucket to the place where the material is to be dumped. The dragrope is then released causing the bucket to tilt and empty. This is called a dump operation.|$|R

50|$|The grain {{elevator}} may contain {{several types of}} these conveyors, such as belt or drag conveyors. In addition, they utilize <b>bucket</b> elevators to <b>lift</b> the grain from the drop off point to the storage bins.

Bucket conveyors often impart little mechanical damage because the grains are not continually moving with respect to each other. Grain damage is only imparted when the kernels are loaded into the buckets {{at the bottom of the}} elevator and when they are discharged at the top.|$|R
50|$|This book is {{extensively}} illustrated {{and describes}} {{the tools and}} machinery associated with mining. Handtools and different sorts of buckets, wheelbarrows and trucks on wooded plankways are described. Packs for horses and sledges are used to carry loads above ground. Agricola then provides details of various kinds of machines for lifting weights. Some of these are man-powered and some powered by up to four horses or by waterwheels. Horizontal drive shafts along tunnels allow lifting in shafts not directly connected to the surface. If this is not possible treadmills will be installed underground. Instead of lifting weights similar machines use chains of <b>buckets</b> to <b>lift</b> water. Agricola also describes several designs of piston force pumps which are either man or animal powered or powered by waterwheels. Because these pumps can only lift water about 24 feet, batteries of pumps are required for the deepest mines. Water pipe designs are also covered in this section. Designs of wind scoop for ventilating shafts or forced air using fans or bellows are also described. Finally ladders and lifts using wicker cages are used to get miners up and down shafts.|$|R

50|$|One such wheel from Spain {{was rescued}} {{and part of}} it is now on display in the British Museum. Some of the {{components}} are numbered, suggesting that it was prefabricated above ground before assembly in the underground passages. In the 1930s, a fragment of a wooden bucket from a drainage wheel was found in deep workings at the Dolaucothi gold mine in west Wales, and is now preserved in the National Museum of Wales in Cardiff. It has been carbon dated to about 90 AD. From the depth of 160 feet below known open workings, it can be inferred that the drainage wheel was part of a sequence just like that found in Spain. The shape of the edge of one of the <b>lifting</b> <b>buckets</b> is almost identical with that from Spain, suggesting that a template was used to make the devices.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} measuring the in-bucket payload volume on a dragline excavator {{for the purpose of}} estimating the material's bulk density in real-time. Knowledge of the payload's bulk density can provide feedback to mine planning and scheduling to improve blasting and therefore provide a more uniform bulk density across the excavation site. This allows a single optimal bucket size to be used for maximum overburden removal per dig and in turn reduce costs and emissions in dragline operation and maintenance. The proposed solution uses a range bearing laser to locate and scan full <b>buckets</b> between the <b>lift</b> and dump stages of the dragline cycle. The bucket is segmented from the scene using cluster analysis, and the pose of the bucket is calculated using the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm. Payload points are identified using a known model and subsequently converted into a height grid for volume estimation. Results from both scaled and full scale implementations show that this method can achieve an accuracy of above 95...|$|R
50|$|In {{the seventeenth}} century, {{a system of}} pipes brought water to the citadel. However, this made the citadel {{vulnerable}} to siege as an enemy could easily destroy the pipe system. Therefore, in 1692, Vauban had a well cut {{to a depth of}} 132 m through the rock to the water table. A wheel with a diameter of four metres, operated by a man who walked within it, served to <b>lift</b> <b>buckets.</b> Unfortunately, the water turned out to be brackish and undrinkable. Instead, the citadel relied on cisterns that stored rainwater. There was one at the front. The water was still of average quality. The Citadel's chapel is dedicated to Saint Stephen. It was consecrated in 1683 and commemorated the cathedral and cloisters that Vauban demolished when constructing the Royual Front. Vauban included a chapel in each of his fortresses for the garrison to attend Sunday mass. The chapel has an attractive portal adorned with Doric columns but is otherwise simple. Otto I, Count of Burgundy was buried there.|$|R
5000|$|There is no {{specific}} {{technology that is}} advocated with self-supply. Self-supply is rather an approach of how to improve access to water and sanitation services, {{commonly referred to as}} [...] "moving up the water and sanitation ladders". [...] At the bottom of the [...] "water ladder" [...] are unprotected sources of water. The users [...] "climb the water ladder" [...] by adding protection to their water source or additional technology for convenience. For example, a user with an unlined hand dug well with a rope and <b>bucket</b> as a <b>lifting</b> device would be {{at the bottom of the}} water ladder. A user with a lined hand dug well would be higher on the water ladder since the water source has a lower risk of contamination due to the lining. A user with a hand pump would have the benefit of being able to get a larger volume of water more quickly than with a bucket, and contamination of the source is reduced. Finally, a user with a motorized pump would have the convenience of not having to expend any manual energy on pumping water. It should be noted that even sources on the lowest rungs of the ladder would provide service all day, every day, all year round.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} calculating the in-bucket payload volume on a dragline {{for the purpose of}} estimating the material’s bulk density in real-time. Knowledge of the bulk density can provide instant feedback to mine planning and scheduling to improve blasting and in turn provide a more uniform bulk density across the excavation site. Furthermore costs and emissions in dragline operation, maintenance and downstream material processing can be reduced. The main challenge is to determine an accurate position and orientation of the bucket with the constraint of real-time performance. The proposed solution uses a range bearing and tilt sensor to locate and scan the <b>bucket</b> between the <b>lift</b> and dump stages of the dragline cycle. Various scanning strategies are investigated for their benefits in this real-time application. The bucket is segmented from the scene using cluster analysis while the pose of the bucket is calculated using the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm. Payload points are segmented from the bucket by a fixed distance neighbour clustering method to preserve boundary points and exclude low density clusters introduced by overhead chains and the spreader bar. A height grid is then used to represent the payload from which the volume can be calculated by summing over the grid cells. We show volume calculated on a scaled system with an accuracy of greater than 95 per cent...|$|R
