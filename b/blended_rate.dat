40|$|Variable pricing, or {{demand-based}} pricing, is {{a popular}} revenue management technique by which hotel managers set different nightly rates for the same room based on expected room demand. Operational policies and procedures associated with variable pricing may be confusing to customers, {{especially if they are}} not familiar with the practice. Best-available-rate (BAR) pricing is an attempt to reduce that confusion and to guarantee that the guest is quoted the lowest available rate for each night of a multiple-night stay. As a result, instead of paying the same price for each room-night, the guest would pay different prices each night. Understanding customers 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of a BAR policy can help hotel managers better apply revenue management tools that maximize revenue without compromising guest satisfaction. This study surveyed 153 travelers to measure their reactions to BAR pricing and their perception of its fairness, acceptability, reasonableness, and honesty. We found that for a multiple-night stay, customers prefer to be quoted individual rates for each night (non-blended rates) rather than the average price per night over the stay (<b>blended</b> <b>rates).</b> Overall, customers found individual rates to be significantly more fair, acceptable, reasonable, and honest than <b>blended</b> <b>rates.</b> However, customer reactions to non-blended and <b>blended</b> <b>rates</b> differed between frequent and infrequent travelers. Frequent travelers found no difference in fairness between <b>blended</b> and non-blended <b>rates</b> while infrequent travelers perceived non-blended rates to be more favorable. The findings of this study can help managers more precisely tailor the way that they give rates and information to customers during the reservation process. Respondents preferred to be quoted individual rates, so that they know they are paying the lowest available nightly <b>rates,</b> rather than <b>blended</b> <b>rates,</b> which conceal the actual nightly rates. To ensure that customers have positive perceptions of price fairness and honesty, managers should quote non-blended rates, such as those that accompany BAR guarantees.

30|$|Considering the {{interaction}} of the various sub-systems in determining pointing performance is a significant systems engineering challenge spanning all parties and disciplines. There are several potential sources of pointing error either leading to low frequency biases or high frequency noise in the transmitted beam direction. Low frequency drift will misalign the telescope bore axis from the OGS direction and if left unchecked could bring the deviation outside of the angular limits of the BSM. As long as the coarse pointing system can keep the optical boresight to within these limits, the final pointing performance will be determined mainly by the fine pointing mechanism. This will be mainly impacted by high frequency noise leading to jitter or beam wandering. A high optical OBT detection bandwidth is essential for rejecting this source of noise. Noise with higher frequency components than the OBT frame rate can be tackled by the IMUs and <b>blended</b> <b>rate</b> sensor fusion to compensate for any motion occurring in-between frames of the OBT [69, 70]. Quantum communication experiments have achieved a few μrad accuracy under demanding conditions such as in a propeller driven airplane [3] or lofted on a hot air balloon [8]. The more benign microgravity environment and lower vibrational background of a space-based experiment should allow at least as good performance and we consider residual effects that may affect pointing performance.|$|E
40|$|The {{electronic}} {{medical record}} (EMR), a. k. a. health information technology (HIT), is being widely promoted by governments, HMOs, large employers, hospitals, and even organized medicine. Doctors are now being urged to restrict EMR purchases to systems that will ultimately be certified by CCHIT (Certification Commission for Healthcare Information Technology). Why {{is it so important}} to have CCHIT? The key word is interoperability. CCHIT is supposedly a nonprofit entity with a contract with HHS to accelerate the development of interoperable systems. CMS Secretary Michael Leavitt has formed a committee to spur the development of the interoperable EMR: the American Health Information Community (AHIC). Buried deep in these deliberations is the true purpose of interoperability: We want the data. Why do they want the data? Most importantly, it will enable them to implement standards that will easily translate into pay for performance (P 4 P). P 4 P will lead to cost savings to payers who will refuse payment for what is considered poor performance. Could poor performance be the new label for superior or costlier care? Interestingly, one of the arguments served up for enticing physicians to buy into the EMR is that better documentation will translate into higher reimbursements! This actually happened when some Ohio doctors started coding more Level 4 visits when using EMRs. Anthems response, however, was to blend the rates for levels 3 and 4 in order to circumvent the higher payout: Anthem regional executives refuse to discontinue their <b>blended</b> <b>rate</b> policy until the company can devise a solution that allows them to maintain their profit margins. Make no mistake about this: once enough physicians are fully interoperable, P 4 P will become a nightmareall in the name of quality, of course.

Optimal integrated scheduling of gasoline blending and order delivery operations can significantly increase profit by avoiding ship demurrage, improving customer satisfaction, minimizing quality give-aways, reducing costly transitions and slop generation, exploiting low-quality cuts, and reducing inventory costs. In this article, we first introduce a new unit-specific event-based continuous-time formulation for the integrated treatment of recipes, blending, and scheduling of gasoline blending and order delivery operations.

40|$|Globally green {{business}} has witnessed tremendous growth and {{is seen as}} an alternative to fossil fuel and a solution to global climate change. Among the {{green business}}es, biofuel industry has witnessed a tremendous growth globally. Brazil is the leading producer of ethanol at 27 billion sugarcane based liters in 2009. This report discusses the history of ethanol in Brazil by considering the role played by the government in making the ethanol program successful the challenges and impact faced by sugarcane ethanol and the future sustainability of sugar and ethanol. Ever since the spike in oil prices globally and the increasing concern about carbon emissions and global climate change, Brazil has pursued a policy of promoting international climate change commitments. The blossoming of the ethanol industry can be traced to a number of public policy initiatives. The initiatives taken by the Brazilian government to enhance the productivity of sugarcane cultivation through large investment in R&D is one crucial factor. The enhanced production of ethanol was accompanied by the initial development of a vehicle operating purely on ethanol in the 1980 s, as well as the revolutionary introduction of Flexible-Fuel Vehicles (FFVs), which are capable of running on gasoline and ethanol or at any <b>blending</b> <b>rates</b> of both fuels. FFVs to a large extent have contributed to the development and sustenance of the biofuel industry in Brazil. However, many analysts have cast doubt about the sustainability of the Brazilian ethanol program as the government has recently suggested lowering the current ethanol-to-gasoline <b>blending</b> <b>rate</b> for fuel in Brazil from 25 to 20 percent. The system seems to be facing a need for changes through better planning and consideration for internal consumers. If ethanol prices continue to rise due to demand-supply unbalances, carbon emission targets could be impacted due to potential switching to gasoline.

40|$|The Purpose {{of these}} studies was to {{investigate}} the ability of surface energy measurements and rates of mixing in dry powder inhaler formulations to predict aerosol dispersion performance. Two lactose carrier systems comprising either spray dried or milled particles were developed such that they had identical physical characteristics except for surface morphology and surface energies avoiding confounding variables common in other studies.

Spray dried lactose had a higher surface entropy (0. 20 vs. 0. 13 mJ/m 2 K) and surface enthalpy (103. 2 vs. 79. 2 mJ/m 2) compared to milled lactose.

It is {{the purpose}} of this {{research}} to provide a brief background to the South African Petroleum Industry and to focus in particular to Petronet with regards to finding an amicable solution to dispose the excess intermixture created, {{as a result of the}} Oil Industry reviewing the current <b>blend</b> <b>rate</b> at which intermixtures can be blended into pure products. The pipelines operated by Petronet are mainly multi-product pipelines i. e. many different refined petroleum products use the same pipeline at the same time and there is a level of co-mixing between each product which is termed intermixture. The primary method that Petronet disposes intermixture is on continuous process into pipeline deliveries to clients (commonly known as blending). This means that while a delivery to a client is being made, careful analysis and calculation are done to blend some intermixture into this delivery, making absolute certain that the end product to the client remain within the predetermined specification. Originally, Petronet was allowed to blend 0, 5 % diesel into petrol and 0, 25 % petrol into diesel, provided that in the case of petrol the FBP of 215 °C was not exceeded and that the residue content did not exceed 2 %. With Motorcar manufacturers now producing hi-tech cars that require high quality fuel to be compatible with the extended service intervals, Industry have revised the original <b>blending</b> <b>rates</b> of diesel into petrol from 0, 5 % to 0, 25 %. This means that Petronet cannot blend more intermixture as it did in the past, as a result there will be an accumulation of excess intermixture. The impact of this revision has and is adversely affecting the nature in which Petronet operates. This research seeks to explore alternative methods in which Petronet can use to address the excess intermixture problems. Three solutions are identified namely: short, medium and long term solution. The short being the sale of excess intermixture, the medium being the re-processing of excess intermixture by refineries and the long term sustainable solution is for Petronet to invest in its own Refractionator unit. This unit would be the ultimate and the best solution as it allows Petronet to re-process the intermixture back to its base and this product can then be blended back at a much higher rate...|$|R

This paper describes a test method developed that is able to predict the effects of specific fuels on engine components that are not possible to be revealed by initial fuel properties as tested according to fuel standards EN 590 and EN 14214. The method is able to simulate long engine operation within a feasible test duration with controllable acceleration of involved phenomena and in a cost effective manner including the use of limited amount of fuel and only engine components affected by the fuel degradation.

40|$|Super star {{clusters}} (SSCs) are typically found in interacting galaxies and trace an extreme form of star-formation. We present a K-band study of SSC candidates {{in a sample}} of local luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) using two adaptive optics instruments (VLT/NACO and Gemini/ALTAIR/NIRI). In addition to facilitating SSC detections in obscured environments, this work introduces SSC studies in hosts with higher star-formation rates (SFRs) than most previous studies. We find that the luminosity functions (LFs) of the clusters are reasonably well-fitted by a single power-law with the values of the index α ranging between 1. 5 to 2. 4 with an average value of α 1. 9. This value appears to be less steep than the average α 2. 2 in normal spiral galaxies. Due to the host galaxy distances involved (median D_L 70 Mpc) blending effects have to be taken into account, and are investigated using Monte Carlo simulations of blending effects for LFs and a photometric SSC analysis of the well-studied Antennae system which is artificially redshifted to distances of our sample. While blending tends to flatten LFs our analyses show that Δα is less than 0. 1 in our sample. The simulations also show that in the luminosity range, M_K < - 13, considered in this work the extracted SSC luminosities are generally dominated by a single dominant star cluster rather than several knots of SF.

40|$|Under the Biofuels Obligation Scheme in Ireland, the {{biofuels}} {{penetration rate}} target for 2013 {{was set at}} 6 % by volume from a previous 4 % from 2010. In 2012 the fuel blend reached 3 %, with approximately 70 million L of biodiesel and 56 million L of ethanol blended with diesel and gasoline, respectively. Up to and including April 2013, the current <b>blend</b> <b>rate</b> in Ireland for biodiesel was 2. 3 % and for bioethanol was 3. 7 % which equates to approximately 37. 5 million L of biofuel {{for the first four}} months of 2013. The target of 10 % by 2020 remains, which equates to approximately 420 million L yr− 1. Achieving the biofuels target would require 345 ktoe by 2020 (14, 400 TJ). Utilizing the indigenous biofuels in Ireland such as tallow, used cooking oil and oil seed rape leaves a shortfall of approximately 12, 000 TJ or 350 million L (achieving only 17 % of the 10 % target) that must be either be imported or met by other renewables. Other solutions seem to suggest that microalgae (for biodiesel) and macroalgae (for bioethanol) could meet this shortfall for indigenous Irish production. This paper aims to review the characteristics of algae for biofuel production based on oil yields, cultivation, harvesting, processing and finally in terms of the European Union (EU) biofuels sustainability criteria, where, up to 2017, a 35 % greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction is required compared to fossil fuels. From 2017 onwards, a 50 % GHG reduction is required for existing installations and from 2018, a 60 % reduction for new installations is required...|$|R
