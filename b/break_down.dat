5|$|Some enzymes {{are used}} commercially, for example, in the {{synthesis}} of antibiotics. Some household products use enzymes to speed up chemical reactions: enzymes in biological washing powders <b>break</b> <b>down</b> protein, starch or fat stains on clothes, and enzymes in meat tenderizer <b>break</b> <b>down</b> proteins into smaller molecules, making the meat easier to chew.|$|E

5|$|An {{important}} function of enzymes {{is in the}} digestive systems of animals. Enzymes such as amylases and proteases <b>break</b> <b>down</b> large molecules (starch or proteins, respectively) into smaller ones, {{so they can be}} absorbed by the intestines. Starch molecules, for example, are too large to be absorbed from the intestine, but enzymes hydrolyze the starch chains into smaller molecules such as maltose and eventually glucose, which can then be absorbed. Different enzymes digest different food substances. In ruminants, which have herbivorous diets, microorganisms in the gut produce another enzyme, cellulase, to <b>break</b> <b>down</b> the cellulose cell walls of plant fiber.|$|E

5|$|Metabolism {{is usually}} {{divided into two}} categories: catabolism, the <b>breaking</b> <b>down</b> of organic matter for example, the <b>breaking</b> <b>down</b> of glucose to pyruvate, by {{cellular}} respiration, and anabolism, the building up of components of cells such as proteins and nucleic acids. Usually, <b>breaking</b> <b>down</b> releases energy and building up consumes energy.|$|R
50|$|Labile kerogen <b>breaks</b> <b>down</b> to form heavy {{hydrocarbons}} (i.e., oils), refractory kerogen <b>breaks</b> <b>down</b> to form light hydrocarbons (i.e., gases), and inert kerogen forms graphite.|$|R
5|$|One of {{the most}} common methods for {{estimating}} the parameters of a distribution from data, the method of maximum likelihood (MLE), can <b>break</b> <b>down</b> in various cases, such as involving certain mixtures of continuous distributions. In these cases the method of maximum spacing estimation may be successful.|$|E
5|$|Several Parkinson-related {{genes are}} {{involved}} in the function of lysosomes, organelles that digest cellular waste products. It has been suggested that some cases of PD may be caused by lysosome dysfunctions that reduce the ability of cells to <b>break</b> <b>down</b> alpha-synuclein.|$|E
5|$|Small {{quantities}} of methane and formaldehyde detected by Mars orbiters are both {{claimed to be}} possible evidence for life, as these chemical compounds would quickly <b>break</b> <b>down</b> in the Martian atmosphere. Alternatively, these compounds may instead be replenished by volcanic or other geological means, such as serpentinization.|$|E
25|$|The process <b>breaks</b> <b>down</b> {{almost all}} {{materials}} that are fed into it. TDP even efficiently <b>breaks</b> <b>down</b> many types of hazardous materials, such as poisons and difficult-to-destroy biological agents such as prions.|$|R
50|$|Common saliva {{detection}} {{techniques are}} based on the activity of the enzyme alpha-amylase which <b>breaks</b> <b>down</b> starches from food into smaller oligosaccharide molecules, starting digestion in the mouth. In testing, the alpha-amylase <b>breaks</b> <b>down</b> starches present and creates a color change.|$|R
50|$|Antigorite Serpentine {{is another}} {{important}} water bearing phase that <b>breaks</b> <b>down</b> at eclogite facies conditions. Antigorite <b>breaks</b> <b>down</b> at 600-700 °C and between 2-5 GPa. Antigorite contains 13 wt.% water and therefore causes substantial mantle melting. The reaction is listed below.|$|R
5|$|Some dinosaurs {{are known}} to have used gizzard stones like modern birds. These stones are {{swallowed}} by animals to aid digestion and <b>break</b> <b>down</b> food and hard fibers once they enter the stomach. When found in association with fossils, gizzard stones are called gastroliths.|$|E
5|$|The {{bacterium}} Paenibacillus tylopili {{has been}} {{isolated from the}} mycorrhizosphere of T.felleus; this is the region around its subterranean hyphae where nutrients released from the fungus affect {{the activity of the}} microbial population in the soil. The bacterium excretes enzymes that allow it to <b>break</b> <b>down</b> the biomolecule chitin.|$|E
5|$|The genetic {{sequence}} information from A.bisporigera {{has been used}} to identify molecular polymorphisms in the related A.phalloides. These single-nucleotide polymorphisms may be used as population genetic markers to study phylogeography and population genetics. Sequence information has also been employed to show that A.bisporigera lacks many of the major classes of secreted enzymes that <b>break</b> <b>down</b> the complex polysaccharides of plant cell walls, like cellulose. In contrast, saprobic fungi like Coprinopsis cinerea and Galerina marginata, which <b>break</b> <b>down</b> organic matter to obtain nutrients, have a more complete complement of cell wall-degrading enzymes. Although few ectomycorrhizal fungi have yet been tested in this way, the authors suggest that the absence of plant cell wall-degrading ability may correlate with the ectomycorrhizal ecological niche.|$|E
60|$|This Bowes only puts {{forth as}} a working hypothesis. It <b>breaks</b> <b>down</b> on the King’s {{narrative}} to Lennox about Ruthven’s captive and hoard. It <b>breaks</b> <b>down</b> on ‘one other attending’—the man in the turret—whatever else he may have been, he was no harmless attendant. It <b>breaks</b> <b>down</b> on the locked door between the King, and Lennox and Mar, which Bowes omits. It is ruined by Gowrie’s repeated false assurances that the King had ridden away, which Bowes ignores.|$|R
25|$|Hyaluronidase (also {{known as}} {{spreading}} factor) <b>breaks</b> <b>down</b> hyaluronic acid and helps in spreading it. S. aureus also produces deoxyribonuclease, which <b>breaks</b> <b>down</b> the DNA, lipase to digest lipids, staphylokinase to dissolve fibrin and aid in spread, and beta-lactamase for drug resistance.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the exact}} {{biochemical}} {{nature of the}} symbiosis remains unclear, the bacteria likely assist the fish in <b>breaking</b> <b>down</b> algal nutrients. Many bacteria of the genus Clostridium are gut symbionts {{in a variety of}} other species, including humans, often involved in <b>breaking</b> <b>down</b> complex carbohydrates.|$|R
5|$|All {{living things}} on Earth (including methanogens) use liquid {{water as a}} solvent; it is speculated that life on Titan might instead use a liquid hydrocarbon, such as methane or ethane. Water is a {{stronger}} solvent than methane. Water is also more chemically reactive, and can <b>break</b> <b>down</b> large organic molecules through hydrolysis. A life-form whose solvent was a hydrocarbon would not face the risk of its biomolecules being destroyed in this way.|$|E
5|$|All-electric and plug-in hybrid {{vehicles}} {{also have}} lower maintenance costs {{as compared to}} internal combustion vehicles, since electronic systems <b>break</b> <b>down</b> much less often than the mechanical systems in conventional vehicles, and the fewer mechanical systems on board last longer due to the better use of the electric engine. PEVs do not require oil changes and other routine maintenance checks.|$|E
5|$|Alston is also {{credited}} with helping to <b>break</b> <b>down</b> the barriers for female sports journalists. On October 1, 1974, after the Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Houston Astros to clinch the NL Pennant at the Houston Astrodome, he invited Anita Martini to the post-game {{press conference in}} the locker room. She became the first female journalist allowed in any major league locker room.|$|E

5|$|At halftime, Air Force still led by 10–7. Following the half, Virginia Tech's defense {{began to}} <b>break</b> <b>down</b> under Air Force's rushing offense. The Hokies and Air Force battled defensively {{throughout}} the third quarter, {{but in the}} fourth quarter, Air Force's offense broke free for 13unanswered points. Tech's offense was stifled by two Air Force interceptions and twolost fumbles, allowing Air Force to earn the easy victory, 23–7.|$|E
5|$|Baroš {{scored in}} Lyon's opening {{game of the}} 2007–08 season as his club won 2–0 against Auxerre. However, he played {{significantly}} less under new manager Alain Perrin, making just six starts and scoring {{a total of three}} league goals. In mid-November, Baroš revealed a <b>break</b> <b>down</b> in his relationship with Perrin and hinted at a move to another club.|$|E
5|$|Bautista throws three pitches: a fastball, a curveball, and a changeup. His fastball {{travels in}} the high 90mph range. His curve can <b>break</b> <b>down</b> sharply, and he learned the changeup from Pedro Martínez. Wildness had {{been a problem for}} Bautista {{throughout}} his career. He has trouble controlling his fastball and walks a great deal of hitters, which has often contributed to his departure from teams.|$|E
5000|$|Eco-friendly fuel source: The gastrobot, by <b>breaking</b> <b>down</b> food, {{potentially}} runs on {{a completely}} green fuel source. After the food <b>breaks</b> <b>down</b> into energy, {{what is left}} is H2O and O2 (water and oxygen). This type of energy source might let robots function without adding to pollution.|$|R

5|$|Carbohydrates, {{the main}} energy source in most rations, are usually fed {{in the form}} of hay, grass, and grain. Soluble {{carbohydrates}} such as starches and sugars are readily broken down to glucose in the small intestine and absorbed. Insoluble carbohydrates, such as fiber (cellulose), are not digested by the horse's own enzymes, but are fermented by microbes in the cecum and large colon to <b>break</b> <b>down</b> and release their energy sources, volatile fatty acids.|$|E
5|$|In a {{difficult}} return leg, Celtic toiled to <b>break</b> <b>down</b> a dour Boavista side {{who knew that}} a scoreless draw was all the Portuguese side required to reach the final. However, an opportunistic strike by Larsson on 80 minutes won the match and the tie for Celtic, meaning that Celtic would go through to the UEFA Cup Final, preventing an all-Portugal, and all-Oporto, final.|$|E
5|$|In a flashback, Lori Grimes (Sarah Wayne Callies) {{is talking}} with other mothers about a fight {{she had with}} her husband, Rick (Andrew Lincoln). Rick's partner, Shane Walsh (Jon Bernthal), pulls up in a police cruiser and tells Lori that Rick has been {{severely}} wounded in a highway shootout. Lori then tells her and Rick's son, Carl (Chandler Riggs) the news, causing him to <b>break</b> <b>down</b> in tears.|$|E

50|$|Elastase <b>breaks</b> <b>down</b> elastin, {{an elastic}} fibre that, {{together}} with collagen, determines the mechanical properties of connective tissue. The neutrophil form <b>breaks</b> <b>down</b> the Outer membrane protein A (OmpA) of E. coli and other Gram-negative bacteria. Elastase {{also has the}} important immunological role of <b>breaking</b> <b>down</b> Shigella virulence factors. This is accomplished through the cleavage of peptide bonds in the target proteins. The specific peptide bonds cleaved are those on the carboxyl side of small, hydrophobic amino acids such as glycine, alanine, and valine. For more on how this is accomplished, see serine protease.|$|R
