40|$|Certain techniques, {{comprising}} machining and GTAW dressing, {{have been}} used in the weld <b>bead</b> <b>edge</b> (region of the welded joint between the weld metal and the base metal) to increase the fillet radius of the region by reducing the stress concentrator factor, decreasing roughness, and increasing the life of weldings. Moreover, TIG Dressing may also provide a smooth change in the radius of the curvature and change the average grain size and promote a microstructural variation through the reflow of this region. Current study analyzes the effect of surface finish of the Heat Affected Zone (HAZ) on resistance to corrosion of welded joints of simple deposition under plate by using machining techniques with sandpaper of different particle sizes and GTAW Dressing, comparing the effect of the two techniques in the resistance to corrosion in environments with chloride ions. ACE P 410 D ferritic stainless steel was employed as base metal and austenitic wire 308 L for welding.

40|$|This report {{studies the}} effect of the local spatial density of {{monoclonal}} antibody (mAb) immobilized within a low-solids content, large-particle diameter cellulose support. A novel epoxide-gradient activation method (epoxy-GAM) for creating a gradient of support activation was compared to classical bulk activation/bulk coupling (BA/BC) methods using different coupling chemistries. In addition to using epoxy-GAM, a two-step coupling (TSC) sequence comprised of mAb permeation under slow coupling conditions followed by conditions having fast coupling reaction kinetics was used to further assist in the goal of distributing the mAb within the matrix. Immunosorbents containing volume-averaged mAb densities of 1 – 12 mg/ml of support were studied. A gradient of immobilized fluorescein label and fluorescein-labeled mAb was observed by fluorescent imaging within 10 µm thick cross-sections of the epoxy-GAM supports. The antigen-binding efficiency (ηeff) of an immunosorbent is defined in this study as the experimentally observed binding capacity of an antigen (mg antigen (Ag) /ml support) divided by the maximum theoretical antigen-binding capacity based upon a 2 : 1, Ag: mAb stoichiometric ratio and is expressed as a percentage. The ηeff of immunosorbents obtained using epoxy-GAM/TSC contained a more uniform spatial distribution of immobilized mAb and were significantly more active (ηeff = 30 – 50 %) relative to those immunosorbents made using epoxy-BA/BC methods that contained locally high mAb densities that were immobilized only near the <b>bead</b> <b>edge</b> (ηeff = 1 – 10 %). In spite of the mAb distribution occurring well within the interior of the large-particle diameter cellulose beads, no limitation in mass transport was observed using HETP anaysis. 16...|$|E

Geltrusion is the {{production}} of thin (= 10 pm), unfilled and ceramically-filled ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene films. These films are made by extruding and subsequent stretching of a coniinüoüs îape. The ~liain pïûbleril faced dmirig prodwiiûn is {{the existence of a}} non-uniform thickness profile after stretching: a uniform centre of the film surrounded by thick <b>edges</b> termed <b>edge</b> <b>beads.</b> <b>Edge</b> <b>beads</b> are caused by the edge stress effect: a difference in stress condition between the edge and centre of the tape, caused by the free-surface boundary condition during stretching.

To solve the <b>edge</b> <b>bead</b> problem, a methodology based on modelling and simulation has to be used.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - A transducer (8) clamped to the component being processed, imparts oscillation to the component. Alternatively, an oscillating jet of liquid is directed at a surface of the component to impart oscillation. Alternatively, gas with a superimposed oscillation is directed at the region of the molten phase, for imparting oscillation. The oscillations are tuned to a resonance range of the molten phase.
