Downsized <b>barchan</b> <b>dune</b> slices are observed in a narrow water flow tube. The relaxation time from an initial symmetric triangular heap towards an asymmetric shape attractor increases with dune mass and decreases with grain size.

40|$|A {{wide variety}} of aeolian sand dunes are found in Chah Jam erg, in central part of IRAN, best known type of them are the <b>barchan</b> <b>dunes,</b> shaped in a crescent, which occur if the wind comes {{steadily}} from the same direction throughout the year {{and if there is}} not enough sand to cover the entire surface. <b>Barchan</b> <b>dunes</b> in studied area are moving to 20 m/year toward S-SW.

40|$|High-resolution particle-image {{velocimetry}} (PIV) {{experiments have}} been conducted over a fixed-bed {{to examine the effects}} of interacting barchan dunes on the flow structure. The <b>barchan</b> <b>dune</b> models were based upon an idealized contour map, the shape and dimensions of which were based upon previous empirical studies of dune morphology. The experimental setup comprised two, co-axially aligned <b>barchan</b> <b>dune</b> models that were spaced at different distances apart. Three volumetric ratios (Vr, upstream barchan dune: downstream <b>barchan</b> <b>dune)</b> of 0. 025, 0. 056, 0. 175, replicated the different behaviors of interacting barchan dunes as observed in the field and laboratory by Endo et al. (2004), and were accompanied by an investigation of identically-sized dunes. Models were placed in an Eiffel-type, open-circuit wind tunnel with a working test-section 6090 mm long by 914 mm wide by 457 mm high and a free-stream turbulence intensity of 0. 16 %. Flow quantification was achieved using particle imaging velocimetry (PIV) at 0. 5 Hz. PIV measurements of the mean and turbulent flow field were made in the streamwise–wall-normal plane, along the centerline of the barchans(s), at an average Reynolds number of 59, 000. The presence of an upstream <b>barchan</b> <b>dune</b> of equal volume to the downstream <b>barchan</b> <b>dune</b> (Vr= 1) induces a ‘sheltering effect’ on the flow, manifested by a significantly shorter separation bubble and both reduced streamwise velocity and turbulence intensity in the downstream <b>barchan</b> <b>dune</b> leeside, as compared to an isolated barchan. The volumetric ratio associated with the ‘splitting’ behavior (Vr= 0. 175) of Endo et al. (2004) shows enhanced turbulence production over the downstream <b>barchan</b> <b>dune</b> leeside, that is proposed to be caused by interacting shear layers from the up- and down- stream dunes. The upstream dune also creates a shear layer in its leeside that extends onto the stoss-side of the downstream barchan, and is proposed to be responsible for dune ‘splitting’. For volumetric ratios associated with ‘ejection’ and ‘absorption’ behaviors (Vr= 0. 056 and 0. 025, respectively), the upstream <b>barchan</b> <b>dune</b> does not significantly impact the flow in the leeside of the downstream <b>barchan</b> <b>dune.</b> In these cases, the small coherent turbulent structures generated from the upstream dune lose their coherence before reaching the downstream barchan crest, or may reach the downstream dune shear layer but are too insignificant in intensity and size to interact with the larger flow structures generated in the leeside of downstream <b>barchan</b> <b>dune.</b> The upstream dune leeside for the ‘ejection’ and ‘absorption’ behaviors is characterized by smaller separation zone lengths, and smaller turbulence intensities, than the ‘splitting’ behavior. In this case, it is speculated the potential for downstream erosion is reduced and the downstream barchan maintains its morphology...|$|E

40|$|Barchan dunes are crescentic shape dunes with horns {{pointing}} downstream. The present paper {{reports the}} formation of subaqueous barchan dunes from initially conical heaps in a rectangular channel.

After a certain time, horns appear and grow, until an equilibrium length is reached. Our results show the existence of the timescales $ 0. 5 t_c$ and $ 2. 5 t_c$ for the appearance and equilibrium of horns, respectively, where $t_c$ is a characteristic time that scales with the grains diameter, gravity acceleration, densities of the fluid and grains, and shear and threshold velocities.

40|$|Sand dunes {{are found}} {{in a wide variety}} of shapes in deserts and coasts, and also on the planet Mars. The basic {{mechanisms}} of dune formation could be incorporated into a continuum saltation model, which successfully reproduced the shape of the <b>barchan</b> <b>dunes</b> and has been also applied to calculate interaction of barchans in a field. We have recently extended our dune model to investigate other dune shapes observed in nature. Here, we present the first numerical simulation of the transformation of <b>barchan</b> <b>dunes,</b> under influence of vegetation, into parabolic dunes, which appear frequently on coasts. Further, we apply our model to reproduce the shape of <b>barchan</b> <b>dunes</b> observed on Mars, and we find that an interesting property related to the martian saltation is relevant to predict the scale of dunes on Mars. Our model could also reproduce unusual dune shapes of the Martian north polar region, like rounded barchans and elongated linear dunes.

In the present study, we developed a method that based on GIS-based spatial analysis to calculate the blown sand movement above the surface of a <b>barchan</b> <b>dune.</b> To do so, we sampled the diameters of sand grains, wind velocity and sand flux above the surface of a <b>barchan</b> <b>dune</b> in Taklimakan Desert. Interpolated the sand grain diameters and wind velocity by means of Kriging and Inverse Distance Weighting, respectively, we got the continuous distribution of sand grain diameters and wind velocity above this dune. Integrated these interpolated results, we computed the aerodynamic roughness length, the friction velocity and the sand flux by blown sand models. By this calculation method, the continuous distribution of the aerodynamic roughness length, the friction velocity and the sand flux were obtained. To test this calculation method, we compared these predicted data with the observed values. The tested results showed that the predicted results (the aerodynamic roughness length, the friction velocity and the sand flux) by this method are all satisfied except the sand flux above the dune's foot. We thought that the not enough accurately modeling result of sand flux above the dune's foot is caused by unsaturated sand flux was generated above there, and the models we used are all based the theory of saturated sand flux.

To avoid or {{to minimize the}} hazards associated with sand dunes, {{it is critical to}} determine their rates and patterns of migration at high accuracy and over wide spatial coverage.

The co-registration of optically sensed images and correlation (COSI-Corr) complements traditional approaches to provide accurate measurements at wide spatial coverage. Applying the COSI-Corr technique to two SPOT 4 panchromatic images acquired above North Sinai, we measured lateral migration of 6. 0 to 19. 4 m/yr with an average of 7. 7 m/yr, and 9. 3 to 15. 0 m/yr with an average of 11. 9 m/yr for the whole <b>barchans</b> <b>dune</b> areas and a selected sample of <b>barchan</b> <b>dunes,</b> respectively.
