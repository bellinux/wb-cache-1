5|$|Albert R. <b>Broccoli</b> and Harry Saltzman co-produced {{most of the}} Eon films until 1975, when <b>Broccoli</b> {{became the}} sole producer. The single {{exception}} during this period was Thunderball, on which <b>Broccoli</b> and Saltzman became executive producers while Kevin McClory produced. From 1984 <b>Broccoli</b> was joined by his stepson Michael G. Wilson as producer and in 1995 <b>Broccoli</b> stepped aside from Eon {{and was replaced by}} his daughter Barbara, who has co-produced with Wilson since. Broccoli's (and until 1975, Saltzman's) family company, Danjaq, has held ownership of the series through Eon, and maintained co-ownership with United Artists since the mid-1970s. The Eon series has seen continuity both in the main actors and in the production crews, with directors, writers, composers, production designers, and others employed through a number of films.|$|E
5|$|Cabbage (Brassica oleracea or B.oleracea var. capitata, var. tuba, var. sabauda or var. acephala) is {{a member}} of the genus Brassica and the mustard family, Brassicaceae. Several other cruciferous {{vegetables}} (sometimes known as cole crops) are considered cultivars of B.oleracea, including <b>broccoli,</b> collard greens, brussels sprouts, kohlrabi and sprouting <b>broccoli.</b> All of these developed from the wild cabbage B.oleracea var. oleracea, also called colewort or field cabbage. This original species evolved over thousands of years into those seen today, as selection resulted in cultivars having different characteristics, such as large heads for cabbage, large leaves for kale and thick stems with flower buds for <b>broccoli.</b>|$|E
5|$|Initially <b>Broccoli</b> and Saltzman {{had wanted}} to produce the eighth Bond novel, 1961's Thunderball, as the first film, {{but there was an}} ongoing legal dispute between the screenplay's co-author, Kevin McClory and Ian Fleming. As a result, <b>Broccoli</b> and Saltzman chose Dr. No: the timing was apposite, with claims that American rocket testing at Cape Canaveral had {{problems}} with rockets going astray.|$|E
50|$|<b>Broccoli's</b> {{business}} model allows for expansion by directly operating the business or via managing staff.|$|R
50|$|The {{exception}} came {{towards the}} end of his career, when he would work directly with Michael G. Wilson, <b>Broccoli's</b> stepson.|$|R
50|$|He {{entered the}} world of film after the war as a draughtsman. His {{worked his way up}} to being an {{assistant}} art director with Albert R. <b>Broccoli's</b> and Irving Allen's Warwick Films beginning with Cockleshell Heroes. He became one of Warwick's stock company working on several of Warwick's films including location work on Fire Down Below. He became a full-fledged art director after an injury to the planned art director just prior to the filming of Stanley Kubrick's Lolita (1962). After work on the spy spoof Road to Hong Kong Cain rejoined <b>Broccoli's</b> Eon Productions.|$|R
5|$|The film is {{localized}} {{to accommodate}} international audiences: in the Japanese version, for example, Riley is disgusted by green bell peppers, {{rather than by}} <b>broccoli</b> (the only topping offered by the local pizzeria), to {{reflect the fact that}} <b>broccoli</b> is generally less undesirable to Japanese children.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{produced}} by Albert R. <b>Broccoli,</b> his stepson Michael G. Wilson, and his daughter, Barbara <b>Broccoli.</b> The Living Daylights was generally well received by most critics and was also a financial success, grossing $191.2 million worldwide.|$|E
5|$|<b>Broccoli</b> {{agreed to}} Wood's {{proposed}} changes, {{but before he}} could set to work there were more legal complications. In the years since Thunderball, Kevin McClory had set up two film companies and was trying to make a new Bond film in collaboration with Sean Connery and novelist Len Deighton. McClory got wind of Broccoli's plans to use SPECTRE, an organisation that had first been created by Fleming while working with McClory and Jack Whittingham on the very first attempt to film Thunderball, back even before it was a novel, in the late 1950s. McClory threatened to sue <b>Broccoli</b> for alleged copyright infringement, claiming that he had the sole right to include SPECTRE and its agents in all films. Not wishing to extend the already ongoing legal dispute that could have delayed the production of The Spy Who Loved Me, <b>Broccoli</b> requested Wood remove all references to Blofeld and SPECTRE from the script.|$|E
50|$|The Red Beret is {{the fictional}} {{story about an}} American who enlists in the British Parachute Regiment in 1940, {{claiming}} to be a Canadian. It is notable as the first film made by Irving Allen and Albert R. <b>Broccoli's</b> Warwick Films, {{with many of the}} crew later working on various films for Warwick Films and <b>Broccoli's</b> Eon Productions. It is partly based on the 1950 non-fiction book with the same title written by Hilary Saint George Saunders, about the Parachute Regiment and its first operation, Operation Biting, in February 1942.|$|R
50|$|Irving Allen and Albert R. <b>Broccoli's</b> Warwick Films had {{previously}} {{had a successful}} financing and distribution arrangement with Columbia Pictures, but there was occasionally friction between the two organisations. Allen thought they would increase their profits by creating their own distribution company to release films of a more highbrow nature than their successful action films. The two acquired Eros from the Hyams brothers in 1959, though the brothers remained on the board. Eros distributed Allen and <b>Broccoli's</b> The Trials of Oscar Wilde and Johnny Nobody, but both films failed at the box office.|$|R
5000|$|He {{worked on}} a number of films for Irving Allen and Albert R. <b>Broccoli's</b> Warwick Films, {{including}} Cockleshell Heroes, Zarak, Johnny Nobody and No Time to Die, as well as their more high-minded 1960 production The Trials of Oscar Wilde.|$|R
5|$|<b>Broccoli</b> and Hunt {{eventually}} chose Lazenby {{after seeing}} {{him in a}} Fry's Chocolate Cream advertisement. Lazenby dressed the part by sporting several sartorial Bond elements such as a Rolex Submariner wristwatch and a Savile Row suit (ordered for, but uncollected, by Connery), and going to Connery's barber at the Dorchester Hotel. <b>Broccoli</b> noticed Lazenby as a Bond-type man based on his physique and character elements, and offered him an audition. The position was consolidated when Lazenby accidentally punched a professional wrestler, who was acting as stunt coordinator, in the face, impressing <b>Broccoli</b> with his ability to display aggression. Lazenby was offered a contract for seven films; however, he was convinced by his agent Ronan O'Rahilly that the secret agent would be archaic in the liberated 1970s, {{and as a result}} he left the series after the release of On Her Majesty's Secret Service in 1969.|$|E
5|$|<b>Broccoli</b> and Saltzman {{then decided}} to start {{production}} on The Man with the Golden Gun after Live and Let Die. This was the final Bond film to be co-produced by Saltzman as his partnership with <b>Broccoli</b> was dissolved after the film's release. Saltzman sold his 50% stake in Eon Productions's parent company, Danjaq, LLC, to United Artists to alleviate his financial problems. The resulting legalities over the Bond property delayed production of the next Bond film, The Spy Who Loved Me, for three years.|$|E
5|$|During the credits, Stewie tries (and fails) to make {{believe he}} is eating his <b>broccoli</b> by pouring it onto Brian's plate.|$|E
50|$|After {{directing}} a few English films, Young directed several films for Irving Allen and Albert R. <b>Broccoli's</b> Warwick Films in the 1950s, including The Red Beret with Alan Ladd. Young {{was also a}} story editor at Warwick. This association led to his being offered the directorship {{of the first two}} James Bond films.|$|R
5000|$|British labour and thespians {{were not}} only of high quality but also more {{economical}} to use than the conditions and salaries set by American film unions. Columbia Pictures agreed to match Allen and <b>Broccoli's</b> funding dollar for dollar; in other words for every dollar/pound the producers raised, Columbia would provide the same amount.|$|R
50|$|The {{film was}} the second of four {{produced}} by Albert R. <b>Broccoli's</b> former partner Irving Allen and Martin's Meadway-Claude Production company for Columbia Pictures in the mid-1960s starring Martin as secret agent Matt Helm. Euan Lloyd, a former Warwick Films publicity specialist and producer of The Poppy Is Also a Flower, assisted Allen in production chores.|$|R
5|$|For {{the scene}} {{involving}} {{the opening of}} the musical electronic laboratory door lock in Venice, producer Albert R. <b>Broccoli</b> requested special permission from director Steven Spielberg to use the five-note melody from his film Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977). In 1985, <b>Broccoli</b> would return the favour by fulfilling Spielberg's request to use the James Bond theme music for a scene in his film, The Goonies (1985).|$|E
5|$|In 1965, {{the film}} Thunderball was released, {{starring}} Sean Connery as James Bond. The film was produced as the fourth Eon Productions film and, {{as well as}} listing Albert R. <b>Broccoli</b> and Harry Saltzman as producers, Kevin McClory was {{also included in the}} production team: <b>Broccoli</b> and Saltzman made a deal with McClory, to undertake a joint production of Thunderball, which stopped McClory from making any further version of the novel for a period of ten years following the release of the Eon-produced version. Thunderball premiered in Tokyo on 9 December 1965, grossing $141.2 million at the global box office.|$|E
5|$|In 1990 the {{situation}} was further complicated when MGM/UA was sold to Qintex, which wanted to then merge with Pathé Communications; the Bond back catalogue was leased to Pathé at a lower-than-market value, without consulting Danjaq – who sued MGM/UA Communications, which was itself {{the target of a}} failed takeover bid by Pathé. In August 1990 Albert <b>Broccoli</b> appointed his daughter Barbara <b>Broccoli</b> alongside Michael G. Wilson as producers at Eon, while he concentrated on matters at Danjaq. The dispute between Danjaq and MGM/UA was protracted and delayed production of Bond 17, but was finally settled in 1993.|$|E
50|$|According to Albert R. <b>Broccoli's</b> {{autobiography}} When the Snow Melts, Eon Productions {{was originally}} contracted by United Artists {{to make two}} films a year for them; one James Bond film and one non-Bond film. Many original suggestions were meant to showcase Sean Connery, who turned them all down, as {{he did not want}} his career totally in the hands of Eon.|$|R
50|$|Mallet grabbed <b>Broccoli's</b> {{attention}} before Goldfinger: she {{was tested}} for the lead Bond girl role, Tatiana Romanova in From Russia with Love. Even though her mother is Russian, Mallet did not receive the Russian role, supposedly because of her provincial British accent. This is ironic however, considering that the Italian actress Daniela Bianchi, who eventually played Tatiana, had her voice redubbed.|$|R
5000|$|By {{the late}} 1960s, Columbia had an {{ambiguous}} identity, offering old-fashioned fare like A Man for All Seasons and Oliver! {{along with the}} more contemporary Easy Rider and The Monkees. After turning down releasing Albert R. <b>Broccoli's</b> Eon Productions James Bond films, Columbia hired <b>Broccoli's</b> former partner Irving Allen to produce the Matt Helm series with Dean Martin. Columbia also produced a James Bond spoof, Casino Royale (1967), in conjunction with Charles K. Feldman, which held the adaptation rights for that novel. By 1966, the studio was suffering from box-office failures, and takeover rumors began surfacing. Columbia was surviving solely on the profits made from Screen Gems, whose holdings also included radio and television stations. On December 23, 1968, Screen Gems merged with Columbia Pictures Corporation and {{became part of the}} newly formed Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc. for $24.5 million. [...] Following the merger, in March 1969, CPI purchased Bell Records for $3.5 million (mainly in CPI stock), retaining Larry Uttal as label president.|$|R
5|$|Telly Savalas as Ernst Stavro Blofeld aka Comte Balthazar de Bleuchamp – Bond's nemesis, {{leader of}} SPECTRE and in hiding. Savalas had {{appeared}} in The Dirty Dozen in 1967, leading to <b>Broccoli</b> suggesting him to director Peter Hunt, for the role, in place of Donald Pleasence, who {{had appeared in}} You Only Live Twice. Both <b>Broccoli</b> and Hunt felt Pleasence was unsuited to the more physical side of the Blofeld role in On Her Majesty's Secret Service.|$|E
5|$|To {{create a}} {{realistic}} compost pile, the Art Department photographed fifteen {{different kinds of}} produce, such as apples, berries, bananas, mushrooms, oranges, <b>broccoli,</b> and lettuce, {{in the process of}} rotting.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of Quantum of Solace in 2008, {{producer}} Barbara <b>Broccoli</b> commented that Skyfall, untitled at the time, may continue {{the plot of the}} Quantum organisation, introduced in Casino Royale and continued in Quantum of Solace. Ultimately, Skyfall was a stand-alone film.|$|E
50|$|Allen's Helm series had {{one major}} effect on <b>Broccoli's</b> Bond movies (produced {{at the time}} in {{partnership}} with Harry Saltzman). To get Dean Martin on board as Matt Helm, Allen had to make the actor a partner in the enterprise. Dean Martin ended up making more money on The Silencers (1966) than Sean Connery made on Thunderball (1965). This did not go unnoticed by Connery.|$|R
50|$|Galaxy Angel II (Gyarakushī Enjeru Tsū) is {{a sequel}} to the games, anime, and manga {{franchise}} of Galaxy Angel, and is the continuation of <b>BROCCOLI's</b> Project G.A.. It features a brand new cast of Angels called the Rune Angel Troupe, {{and according to the}} game Galaxy Angel II: Zettai Ryōiki no Tobira, is set 4 {{years after the end of}} the previous game, Galaxy Angel: Eternal Lovers.|$|R
50|$|Based on <b>Broccoli's</b> novel Florinda, {{its title}} is derived {{not from the}} {{sparkling}} wine but for the Spanish word for a scarlet woman. The plot {{is based on the}} legend of Florinda la Cava, daughter of Julian, Count of Ceuta, whose love triangle involving King Roderic sets a massive war in motion. In the 8th century, Roderic was the last ruler of Visigothic Spain and was overthrown by the Moorish invasion.|$|R
5|$|Cassandra Harris as Countess Lisl von Schlaf: Columbo's mistress. At {{the time}} of filming Harris was married to future Bond actor Pierce Brosnan, and the couple lunched with the film's {{producer}} Albert R. <b>Broccoli</b> during filming.|$|E
5|$|Die Another Day, {{produced}} by Michael G. Wilson and Barbara <b>Broccoli,</b> {{and directed by}} Lee Tamahori, marked the James Bond franchise's 40th anniversary. The series began in 1962 with Sean Connery starring as Bond in Dr. No. Die Another Day includes references {{to each of the}} preceding films.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, {{after five}} films, Sean Connery {{resigned}} from the role of James Bond and—during the filming of You Only Live Twice—was not on speaking terms with Albert <b>Broccoli.</b> The confirmed front runners were Englishman John Richardson, Dutchman Hans De Vries, Australian Robert Campbell, Englishman Anthony Rogers and Australian George Lazenby.|$|E
5000|$|Callan {{has written}} biographies of Sean Connery, long time friend Richard Harris and Anthony Hopkins. The Connery book was {{referred}} to as [...] "a necessity for Connery and Bond fans" [...] by the Los Angeles Times and is the sole reference work on Connery quoted in Albert [...] "Cubby" [...] <b>Broccoli's</b> autobiography. A new edition, revised and updated to cover Connery's formal retirement, was published by Nouveau Monde Editions, Paris, in March 2012.|$|R
500|$|Maibaum, who {{had worked}} on six Bond films previously, {{delivered}} his own draft based on Mankiewicz's work. Much of the plot involving Scaramanga being Bond's equal was sidelined in later drafts. For {{one of the two}} main aspects of the plot, the screenwriters used the 1973 energy crisis as a backdrop to the film, allowing the MacGuffin of the [...] "Solex agitator" [...] to be introduced; <b>Broccoli's</b> stepson Michael G. Wilson researched solar power to create the Solex.|$|R
50|$|At {{the same}} time, it backed two {{expatriate}} North Americans in Britain, who had acquired screen rights to Ian Fleming's James Bond novels. For $1 million, UA backed Harry Saltzman and Albert <b>Broccoli's</b> Dr. No in 1963 and launched the James Bond series. The franchise outlived UA's {{time as a}} major studio, continuing half a century later. Other successful projects backed in this period included the Pink Panther series, which began in 1964, and Spaghetti Westerns, which made a star of Clint Eastwood.|$|R
