25|$|A {{few years}} later, it seemed highly likely that Kim Philby, in SIS {{at the time}} of the Burgess–Maclean defections, had been tipped off that he was about to <b>be</b> <b>confronted</b> <b>with</b> {{conclusive}} evidence of his treachery, and this led to his decampment from Beirut to Moscow in 1963. A complicating factor was that Sir Dick White had been director general of MI5 between 1953 and 1956 before he became director general of SIS in 1956.|$|E

25|$|The Tunisians populace {{appreciated}} {{the introduction of}} such improvements, but noticed the advantages the Protectorate bestowed on the European newcomers. Community leaders began {{to appeal to the}} self-proclaimed public virtues of the French state, e.g., droit humane, in order to obtain equal treatment with the French colons. Yet at first such appeals resulted more often than not in disappointment, increasingly so, enough that many Tunisians turned cynical regarding the Protectorate's claims. Mass movements arose. Yet not all French officials were non-responsive. From the start, the fundamental nature of the colonial enterprise had been disputed. Various causes and/or justifications were proposed during the period of the Protectorate as its self-explanation: for revenue and natural resources, for export markets, for cultural expansion and national prestige, for career opportunities and jobs for the arriving colons, or as a frontier for the military. French policy, in attempting to satisfy such a variety of rationals, could shift in focus from one to another, often depending on which French administrator made the choices and the immediate circumstances. As a natural result French policy was not always consistent over time. During the latter decades of the Protectorate, local French officials increasing also sought to better address the needs, complaints, and demands of the Tunisian people. On many issues, the Protectorate could <b>be</b> <b>confronted</b> <b>with</b> its own contradictory objectives, and underlying political conflicts, leading to difficult decisions or negotiations.|$|E

Although Pembleton does not typically discuss his own feelings, Yoshimura {{wanted him to be}} placed in a situation in which he not only discussed death, but is also led by the unique circumstance of Lange's subway incident to confide his stroke experience to an almost complete stranger. From the beginning of the writing process, Yoshimura specifically wanted the Lange character to be mean and unpleasant, rather than the nice and innocent victim more typically portrayed in such television episodes: [...] "Tragedy can happen to jerky people too and I think it'd be much more interesting to see how that kind of character's circumstances transcends the typical cliched TV kind of victim." ...|$|E
500|$|In the meantime, MacArthur's {{amphibious assault}} at Inchon went ahead on 15 September. [...] "The success of Inchon {{was so great}} and the {{subsequent}} prestige of General MacArthur was so overpowering," [...] Collins later recalled, [...] "that the Chiefs hesitated thereafter to question later plans and decisions of the general, which should have been challenged." [...] In response to a rumor that the Eighth Army planned to halt at the 38th parallel and await United Nations authorization to cross, Marshall {{sent a message to}} MacArthur informing him that: [...] "We want you to feel unhampered tactically and strategically to proceed north of 38th parallel. Announcement above referred to may precipitate embarrassment in the UN where evident desire is not to <b>be</b> <b>confronted</b> <b>with</b> necessity of a vote on passage, rather to find you have found it militarily necessary to do so." [...] A few days later, MacArthur was instructed not to issue an announcement that his forces had crossed the 38th parallel. On 7 October a United Nations General Assembly Resolution was passed that could be broadly construed as permitting the invasion of North Korea.|$|E

500|$|Three months later, the EPB {{issued a}} joint press release with the PRT and the PRTP announcing {{the death of}} one of its members, William Pintado Burgos. After {{emphasizing}} that he had joined the armed resistance from a young age as a believer in independence and socialism, the organizations proceeded to posthumously grant him the title of Commander of the Puerto Rican Revolution, which is only granted to those that are deemed to have [...] "stood firm and battled the motherland's enemy". Months later, on the birthday of Ramón Emeterio Betances, the EBP joined Jornada Betances in a homage to the Puerto Rican students involved in the protests against the Fortuño administration. Remembering that September 23, 1868, is now celebrated as [...] "the birth of the Puerto Rican nation", having been the date of the Cry of Lares when Betances and several other revolted against Spain and proclaimed the first Republic of Puerto Rico under Francisco Ramírez Medina, the group insisted {{that it was time to}} do the same as that day. Citing Pedro Albizu Campos's phrase [...] "it's difficult to give a speech while the mother is lying on bed and there is a killer prowling", the Macheteros anthropomorphized the influence of the United States as that murderer and labeled the Via Verde project and cases of government corruption as examples of actions being taken against the motherland, urging the public to mimic the actions of Lares. Blaming Fortuño, Figueroa Sancha and Fraticelli for a violent response to the UPR strike, the EPB congratulated the students for precipitating a negotiation procedure. Despite this, the organization urged the public to continue its resistance against the measures adopted by the Fortuño administration. The Macheteros also informed that they were [...] "gathering strength, preparing the stage and studying" [...] its opponents, quoting Betances' strategy of patiently and convertly planning every revolutionary action before executing them. The group stated that public education would be defended by [...] "an army of students and communities". The EBP concluded its statement by warning that [...] "the enemy was to <b>be</b> <b>confronted</b> <b>with</b> proper planning and intelligence [...] knowing when to strike". In lobbying for an unified national front, the Macheteros insisted that to accomplish independence the only way to do it was by following the armed resistance promoted by Betances, Albizu, Corretjer and Ojeda Ríos.|$|E

The focus of the Clause is on getting the truth out of a witness, and allowing a trier of fact {{to determine whether the}} witness indeed told the truth.

2500|$|Jackson {{believed}} that evil should <b>be</b> <b>confronted</b> <b>with</b> power. His support {{for civil rights}} and equality at home, married to his opposition to détente, his support {{for human rights and}} democratic allies, and his firm belief that the United States could be a force for good in the world inspired a legion of loyal aides who went on to propound Jackson's philosophy as part of neoconservatism. In addition to Richard Perle, neoconservatives Paul Wolfowitz, Elliott Abrams, Charles Horner, and Douglas Feith were former Democratic aides to Jackson who, disillusioned with the Carter administration, supported Ronald Reagan and joined his administration in 1981, later becoming prominent foreign policy makers in the 21st-century Bush administration. Neoconservative Ben Wattenberg was a prominent political aide to Jackson's 1972 and 1976 presidential campaigns. Wolfowitz has called himself a [...] "Scoop Jackson Republican" [...] on multiple occasions. Many journalists and scholars across the political spectrum have noted links between Senator Jackson and modern neoconservatism.|$|E
