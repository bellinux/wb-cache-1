50|$|Unlike {{conventional}} composites, {{which typically}} fail catastrophically, RCCM fail incrementally {{because of the}} non-linear deformation phase and the multiplicity of joints and links. These results matched finite-element simulations with finely-meshed rigid body models. In addition to convergence to the observed coordinated buckling mode, these simulations accurately predict the relative strength scaling observed in load test experiments. These {{results are consistent with}} the observation that open-cell lattice materials fail through micro-structural strut <b>bending</b> <b>failures</b> with σmax ∝. The simulations also suggest that the coordinated buckling phenomenon as well as the modulus measurements are not dominated by edge effects, with minimal influence on overall results beyond characteristic lengths exceeding several units.|$|R
5000|$|There {{is other}} {{evidence}} of long-bladed swords bending during battle from later periods. The Icelandic Eyrbyggja saga, describes a warrior straightening his twisted sword underfoot {{in a manner}} similar to Polybius's account: [...] "whenever he struck a shield, his ornamented sword would bend, and he had to put his foot on it to straighten it out". Peirce and Oakeshott in Swords of the Viking Age note that the potential for bending may have been built in to avoid shattering, writing that [...] "a <b>bending</b> <b>failure</b> offers a better chance of survival for the sword's wielder than the breaking of the blade...there was a need to build a fail-safe into the construction of a sword to favor bending over breaking".|$|E
50|$|Tensile and {{compressive}} stresses increase proportionally with bending moment, {{but are also}} dependent on the {{second moment of area}} of the cross-section of a beam (that is, the shape of the cross-section, such as a circle, square or I-beam being common structural shapes). Failure in bending will occur when the bending moment is sufficient to induce tensile stresses greater than the yield stress of the material throughout the entire cross-section. In structural analysis, this <b>bending</b> <b>failure</b> is called a plastic hinge, since the full load carrying ability of the structural element is not reached until the full cross-section is past the yield stress. It is possible that failure of a structural element in shear may occur before failure in bending, however the mechanics of failure in shear and in bending are different.|$|E

40|$|Design {{procedures}} for Geosynthetic Reinforced Column Supported (GRCS) embankments generally consider the sliding failure for external stability and the shear failure mode for internal stability. However, other failure modes such as collapse failure, slip circle failure, punching shear failure around column heads (overall or local), and <b>bending</b> <b>failure</b> of DCM columns are also significant for GRCS embankments. Although some design procedures have considered {{some of these}} failure modes and proposed design criteria to check against these failure modes, they are not currently used in practice due to uncertainties related to some assumptions used in developing these methods, unreliable results given by them and difficulty in finding some parameters. Still there are uncertainties in identifying the critical failure modes for these embankments at the ultimate limit state (ULS) conditions. In this paper, two-dimensional finite element modeling incorporating strain softening behavior of cement admixed soils is used to identify the failure modes of GRCS embankments at the ULS. <b>Bending</b> <b>failure</b> of columns with subsequent shear failure {{is found to be}} critical for internal stability of GRCS embankments.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} and compare the biomechanical effects of locking plate superior and anteroinferior positioning on the osteosynthesis of the clavicles osteotomized obliquely. Materials and methods: Ten matched pairs of fresh cadaveric clavicles osteotomized through the mid-shaft obliquely were repaired with a titanium 7 -hole 3. 5 -mm reconstruction locking plate in the superior or the anteroinferior position. The maximal failure loads and the displacement of the specimens at 166  N, 183  N, 203  N loads were recorded by the machine in 3 -point cantilever bending. <b>Bending</b> <b>failure</b> stiffness was calculated between 10 – 150  N and 151  N to maximal <b>bending</b> <b>failure</b> loads. Results: The mean maximal failure load was 396. 2  N (SD, 117. 3) for superior constructs and 220. 1  N (SD, 51. 1) for anteroinferior one (P <  0. 05). There was significant difference in displacement between superior and anteroinferior plated specimens at 183  N (6. 3 [SD, 2] vs. 9. 9 [SD, 3. 6]) and 203  N (6. 4 [SD, 0. 6] vs. 11. 7 [SD, 6. 6]) loads; P <  0. 05). Mean <b>bending</b> <b>failure</b> stiffness between 151  N and maximal loads was 22. 6  N/mm (SD, 13. 2) for superior plates and 11  N/mm (SD, 9) for anteroinferior plated clavicles (P <  0. 05). Conclusions: The superior plating of obliquely osteotomized clavicles with the titanium 7 -hole 3. 5 -mm locking reconstruction plate had a significantly greater biomechanical stability at fixed loads of 183  N and 203  N than the anteroinferior plating in the inferior directed cantilever bending.

30|$|The dynamic {{resistance}} of timber joints {{has been discussed}} primarily by converting dynamic forces into equivalent static forces as products of given mass and input accelerations [7]. This simple conversion is convenient for practical design, however, the actual dynamic behavior is more complicated. A principal incompatibility between actual {{dynamic resistance}} and equivalent static resistance is frequency dependence in dynamic response. The current design codes in Japan provide design procedures that take into consideration this frequency dependence related to the load-deformation characteristics of entire structures or principal structural elements [8]. Another important behavior of timber joints under dynamic forces is the low-cyclic <b>bending</b> fatigue <b>failure</b> of metal fasteners. The low-cyclic <b>bending</b> fatigue <b>failure,</b> which also is frequency dependent, has occasionally been observed in shaking table tests of full-scale wooden structures and structural elements, however, this observation has not been discussed in detail until now.|$|R
40|$|Objectives To (1) define {{mechanical}} properties in flexion, extension, and left lateral bending of cadaveric equine 4 th and 5 th cervical (C 4 -C 5) articulations, (2) compare bio{{mechanical properties}} of C 4 -C 5 when stabilized with a kerf cut cylinder (KCC) {{compared with a}} ventrally placed 4. 5 mm locking compression plate (LCP). Study Design In vitro biomechanical investigation. Sample Population Cadaveric adult equine cervical vertebral columns (n= 54). Methods Cervical vertebrae aged by horse dentition and size measured from radiographs were divided into 3 age groups then randomly allocated to 3 groups. The C 4 -C 5 articulation was treated differently {{in each of the}} groups: KCC group; KCC-implanted LCP group; 8 -hole 4. 5 mm LCP implanted and intact group; no implant. Specimens were randomly subdivided into 1 of 3 loading conditions, before testing to failure under 4 -point bending. Stiffness, yield <b>bending</b> moment, <b>failure</b> <b>bending</b> moment, and <b>failure</b> mode were recorded. General linear models were performed to analyze associations between biomechanical properties and test variables. Results All specimens failed at the C 4 -C 5 intervertebral articulation. The cervical vertebrae with the LCP construct had significantly higher stiffness, yield <b>bending</b> moment, and <b>failure</b> <b>bending</b> moment than the KCC-implanted cervical vertebrae. Failure modes differed between groups and varied with loading direction: KCC group, fractures of C 5 associated with the KCC were common; LCP group, screw pull out or fractures (of C 4 and C 5 bodies, during extension and the caudal aspect of C 4 during left lateral bending) were common; and intact group, subluxations were most common. Conclusions In this model, LCP constructs had superior biomechanical properties compared with KCC constructs. Further research investigating the effect of repetitive loading is indicated...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{temperature}} on the bend radius that a c-axis-oriented sapphire fiber can withstand was determined for fibers of various diameter. Bend stress rupture tests were performed for times of 1 - 100 h and temperatures of 300 - 1700 C. Fibers would survive the bend test undeformed, would fracture or would deform. The bend survival radius {{was determined to}} be the radius above which no fibers fractured or deformed for a given time-temperature treatment. It was found that the ability of fibers to withstand curvature decreases substantially with time and increasing temperature and that fibers of smaller diameter (46 - 83 micron) withstood smaller bend radii than would be expected from just a difference in fiber diameter when compared with the bend results of the fibers of large diameter (144 micron). This was probably due to different flaw populations, causing high temperature <b>bend</b> <b>failure</b> for the tested sapphire fibers of different diameters...|$|R

40|$|Earlier {{studies have}} shown that {{stainless}} steel 304 (SS 304) containing martensite is susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement. This generated concern regarding the structural integrity of SS 304 tubing we use in the W 87 pit tube. During surveillance operations, the pit tube undergoes a series of bending and straightening as it goes through a number of surveillance cycles. This motivated the study to characterize austenitic SS 304 tubing obtained from Rocky Flats. The tubes continued to display structural soundness even after numerous repeated bending and straightening cycles. The minimum and maximum number of <b>bends</b> to <b>failure</b> occurred after 13 and 16 cycles, respectively. After 5 bends, both the inner and outer surfaces of the tubing showed no microcracks. When the bent tubing samples were pressurized and tested using deuterium at 74 {degrees}C and at {approximately} 78 {degrees}C, they failed away from the bent area. Thus deuterium embrittlement of the bent SS 304 tubing should not be a problem. Moreover, to increase our 95 % confidence level to 5 bends, we are planning to perform at least four additional <b>bends</b> to <b>failure</b> tests...|$|R

However, in these current codes, the limit load estimation method is only derived for pipes containing a flaw with uniform depth, although many flaws with complicated shapes, such as stress corrosion cracks, have actually been detected in pipes. In order to evaluate the integrity of the flawed pipes in a more rational way, a limit load estimation method has been proposed by authors considering the complicated circumferential surface flaw in its shape.

The model proved to be relatively sensitive to changes in the tensile behaviour, but the differences were not prominent until entering the nonlinear area of the load-displacement curve. A constant curve with tensile stress equal to the residual tensile strength of the SFRC provided a robust numerical model and results on the conservative side. Including a peak stress with a multilinear tensile curve provided a less stable analysis but more accurate results, however the model behaviour was stiffer than the experiment, providing too small deformations at failure.

The Nation’s aging infrastructure suggests that many structures no longer meet current design standards, placing many bridge susceptible to failure if subjected to an extreme loading event. This research aims to study the structural response of reinforced concrete bridge piers subjected to vehicle collisions. A sensitivity analysis is conducted to observe the causes of shear and <b>bending</b> <b>failures</b> of bridge piers subjected to vehicle collision. Parameters, such as pier diameter, transverse reinforcement spacing, vehicle impact velocity, pile cap height, and multi-pier configuration, are investigated in this study. The finite element code LS-DYNA is utilized to simulate and analyze the vehicle collisions to obtain accurate and detailed results. The vehicle models offered by the National Crash Analysis Center and the National Transportation Research Center, Inc. are used to conduct this research. The finite element modeling controls and material properties are validated by conducting an impact drop hammer experiment. The bridge pier collision models are validated by comparing vehicle damage and impact forces with published research results. Conservation of energy is also checked to assure stability within the impact simulation. A sensitivity analysis suggests that different pier parameters {{have a profound effect}} on failure modes and distribution of impact forces. Piers with large stiffness result in high impact forces, low lateral displacements, and high resistance to shear forces and bending moments.
