40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} {{the causes of}} childhood blindness and severe visual impairment in pupils attending schools for the blind in Burundi in order to assist planning for services in the country. Materials and Methods: All pupils attending three schools for the blind in Burundi were examined. A modified WHO/PBL eye examination record form for children with blindness and low vision was used to record the findings. Data was analyzed for those who became <b>blind</b> <b>or</b> severely <b>visually</b> impaired {{before the age of}} 16 years. Results: Overall, 117 pupils who became visually impaired before 16 years of age were examined. Of these, 109 (93. 2 %) were <b>blind</b> <b>or</b> severely <b>visually</b> impaired. The major anatomical cause of blindness or severe visual impairment was cornea pathology/phthisis (23. 9 %), followed by lens pathology (18. 3 %), uveal lesions (14. 7 %) and optic nerve lesions (11. 9 %). In the majority of pupils with blindness or severe visual impairment, the underlying etiology of visual loss was unknown (74. 3 %). More than half of the pupils with lens related blindness had not had surgery; among those who had surgery, outcomes were generally poor. Conclusion: The causes identified indicate the importance of continuing preventive public health strategies, as well as the development of specialist pediatric ophthalmic services in the management of childhood blindness in Burundi. The geographic distribution of pupils at the schools for the blind indicates a need for community-based programs to identify and refer children in need of services...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In assistive {{technology}} design, it is indispensible {{to consider the}} sensory, physical and cognitive level of target users. Cognitive load is an important indicator of cognitive feedback during interaction and became the critical research issue in designing assistive user interfaces, incorporated with smartphone based {{assistive technology}} like in the android platform. In this paper, we proposed a cognitive load based user interface integrated with reconfigured mobile android phone (R-MAP) based on user‟s cognitive load level. We performed some cognitive tasks within {{a small group of}} sighted but blindfolded people and <b>blind</b> people <b>or</b> <b>visually</b> impaired using R-MAP. Based on task performance and cognitive load levels we manually annotated some data of 24 participants and finally applied some machine learning algorithms to automate the mobile interface. Based on our novel design and experimental finding, we recommended that “cognitive load enabled feedbacks based assistive user interface ” would be a useful assistive tool for the people who use mobile phone for their daily operations...|$|R
