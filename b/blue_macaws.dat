500|$|The Lesser Antillean macaw is {{well-documented}} compared to most other extinct Caribbean macaws, {{since it was}} mentioned and described by several contemporary writers.

In 1774, the French naturalist Comte de Buffon stated that the Italian explorer Christopher Columbus had found macaws in Guadeloupe. The French botanist Jean-Baptiste Du Tertre gave the first detailed descriptions in 1654 and 1667, and illustrated the bird and other animals found in Guadeloupe.

50|$|Anodorhynchus is a genus {{of large}} <b>blue</b> <b>macaws</b> from open and semi-open {{habitats}} {{in central and}} eastern South America. It includes two endangered species, the hyacinth macaw and Lear's macaw also known as the indigo macaw, and one probably extinct species, the glaucous macaw. At about 100 cm in length the hyacinth macaw is the longest parrot in the world. Glaucous and Lear's macaws are exclusively cliff nesters; hyacinth macaws are mostly tree nesters. The three species mainly feed on the nuts from a few species of palms (notably Acrocomia aculeata, Attalea phalerata, Butia yatay and Syagrus coronata).|$|E
5000|$|While <b>blue</b> <b>macaws</b> {{have been}} known from taxidermic and captive {{specimens}} since at least 1790, location of the Lear's macaw's endemic habitat wasn't known until 1978. [...] The glaucous macaw was extirpated in the 1800s by clearance for agriculture and cattle grazing of the yatay palm (Butia yatay) groves upon which it fed, though rumors of its continued existence persist. Lear's macaws have made a comeback from near extinction in the early 1980s (about 60 birds) to over 1000 {{as a result of}} conservation programs. Hyacinth macaws remain locally common within parts of their range, but their range has become fragmented into three known distinct populations in southern Brazil, eastern Bolivia and northeastern Paraguay; populations are declining due to extensive trapping for the pet trade as well as habitat loss.|$|E

Also, Blu and Jewel's old nemesis, Nigel the cockatoo, has survived the plane crash from the first film, but he is now unable to fly and is working as a fortune teller/con artist. When he sees Blu and his family flying overhead, he immediately decides to seek revenge on them. He enlists two minions to help him in his plans; a silent anteater named Charlie and a poison dart frog named Gabi, who is in love with Nigel. Blu and his family use a boat to get to the jungle (with Nigel's first plan of revenge being inadvertently foiled by Charlie); and, when they arrive, they find nothing. However, they are eventually taken to a flock of <b>blue</b> <b>macaws</b> that are hiding in a secret paradise land.

50|$|This {{bird was}} native to north Argentina, south Paraguay, the chaco and llano region of Bolivia {{near the city}} of Santa Cruz de la Sierra, {{northeast}} Uruguay, and Brazil. It became rare during the 19th century due to trapping and loss of habitat, and only two possible reports of wild birds were received in the 20th century. Expeditions by ornithologists to southwestern Paraguay during the 1990s failed to turn up any evidence of the species. Furthermore, only the oldest residents of the region had knowledge of the macaw, with the species last recorded in the 1870s. The bird's disappearance probably is linked to trapping of live adults for the wild bird trade and the wholesale felling of the yatay palm, Butia yatay, the nuts of which appear to have constituted its main food. However, suitable habitat remains in El Palmar National Park, in the Argentine province of Entre Ríos, as well as southern Brazil; however, no rumours of the bird's continued existence in the past several decades have been proven credible. A search conducted by Joe Cuddy and Tony Pittman in the mid-1990s concluded that the birds were extinct in their former range. Rumours persisted that <b>blue</b> <b>macaws</b> were seen in Argentina and Bolivia with a dealer in Rosario, Argentina, offering live specimens. The late George Smith gave many talks rich in conservation information on macaws, including this species, which he stated was not extinct in the wild, but existed in remote areas of Bolivia where he had encountered trappers who could identify this species. Moreover, he stated that stands of pure palm existed “as {{far as the eye could}} see” when he flew over the area which is yet to be investigated.|$|E
