5|$|The creek's use as {{a tribal}} {{boundary}} is disputed. As other southern California Native Americans have done, a tribe typically claimed <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> stream or river—and used drainage divides as boundaries instead. However, the presence of Aliso Canyon, a steep and difficult-to-traverse gorge, suggests the opposite. Kroeber (1907) {{was the first to}} support this theory, and many other archaeologists have followed as well. The Juaneño disagree, arguing that their boundary stretches north to the northern drainage divide of the Aliso Creek watershed, which supports the practice of claiming <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> stream.|$|E
5|$|Saga is an epic space opera/fantasy {{comic book}} series written by Brian K. Vaughan and {{illustrated}} by Fiona Staples, published monthly by the American company Image Comics. The series is heavily influenced by Star Wars {{and is based on}} ideas Vaughan conceived both as a child and as a parent. It depicts a husband and wife, Alana and Marko, from long-warring extraterrestrial races, fleeing authorities from <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> galactic war as they struggle to care for their daughter, Hazel, who is born {{in the beginning of the}} series and who occasionally narrates the series as an unseen adult.|$|E
5|$|Various {{types of}} pancake {{machines}} exist, {{such as those}} that run pancake batter through a heated conveyor inside of a box unit, and those that automatically drop pancake batter onto a flattop grill. Some pancake machines, such as one developed by Crepe-Coer, cook <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pancake simultaneously. Semi-automatic pancake machines also exist, which require some human interaction to function, such as the pouring of batter. Commercial pancake machines may be used in the foodservice industry, in cafeterias and by restaurants, and can serve to reduce the waste of stale pancake batter. Some hotels have pancake machines that guests are allowed to operate. They are also used in other environments in a self-service manner, such as in upscale airport lounges and hotels.|$|E

5|$|Lleyton Hewitt and Roger Federer played {{each other}} on 27 occasions. Early in their careers, Hewitt {{dominated}} Federer, winning seven of their first nine meetings, including a victory from two sets down in the 2003 Davis Cup semifinal which allowed Australia to defeat Switzerland. However, from 2004 onward, Federer dominated the rivalry, winning 16 of the last 18 meetings to finish with an 18–9 overall head-to-head record. This is Hewitt's longest rivalry as these two first played each other as juniors in 1996. They met in one Grand Slam tournament final, the 2004 US Open final, where Federer won his first US Open title in a lopsided encounter in which Federer scored a bagel on <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> second-set tiebreak. Federer met Hewitt at six of the Grand Slam tournaments in which he lifted the trophy, including all five of his triumphs between 2004 and 2005. Their last meeting was at the 2014 Brisbane International, where Hewitt triumphed over Federer in three sets for his first title since 2010, when he also beat Federer to the Halle title.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the artists}} conferred in New York and responded in a joint letter {{that they would be}} willing to participate, but not on the terms set. They {{proposed}} a competition with set fees for sketches and designs submitted by the invited artists, to be judged by a jury of their peers, and with the Mint committed to replace the Seated Liberty coins with the result. They also insisted that the same artist create <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> given coin, and that more time be given to allow the development of designs. Leech was unable to meet these terms, as there was only enough money available for the single prize. In addition to inviting the ten artists, he had sent thousands of solicitations through the country; a number of designs were submitted in response to the circulars. To judge the submissions, he appointed a jury consisting of Saint-Gaudens, Barber, and Henry Mitchell, a Boston seal engraver and member of the 1890 Assay Commission. The committee met in June 1891 and quickly rejected all entries.|$|E
5|$|Wind {{and water}} damage across the Outer Banks was extensive. Strong waves and {{the storm surge}} from Hurricane Isabel knocked about 30 to 40 houses and several motels off of their pilings. Two {{families}} who did not evacuate were nearly swept out to sea when their home was destroyed. Local rescue was unable to reach them; however, they were ultimately able to reach safety. The rough waves greatly affected piers in Nags Head, Rodanthe, and Frisco, with three being completely destroyed. Several locations along North Carolina Highway 12 were partially washed out or covered with debris, and 15foot (4.5m) sections of pavement on <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bridge near Ocracoke were washed away. Strong waves destroyed a beach access ramp, as well. Several thousand homes and businesses were damaged by {{the passage of the}} hurricane, and damage in Dare County totalled nearly $350million (2003USD, ($ USD)). In the Outer Banks, no deaths or injuries were reported.|$|E

5|$|Perhaps Szigeti's most {{fruitful}} musical partnership {{was with}} his friend Béla Bartók. The first piece Bartók dedicated to him was the First Rhapsody for violin and orchestra (or piano) of 1928; the rhapsody, based on both Romanian and Hungarian folk tunes, {{was one of a}} pair of violin rhapsodies written in 1928 (the other being dedicated to Zoltán Székely.) In 1938, Szigeti and clarinetist Benny Goodman teamed up to commission a trio from Bartók: originally intended to be a short work just long enough to fill <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 78rpm record, the piece soon expanded beyond its modest intent and became the three-movement Contrasts for piano, violin and clarinet. In 1944, by which time Szigeti and Bartók had both fled to the United States to escape the war in Europe, Bartók's health was failing and he had sunk into depression. He was in dire need of money, but felt no inspiration to compose and was convinced that his works would never sell to an American audience. Szigeti came to his friend's aid by securing donations from the American Society of Composers and Publishers to pay for Bartók's medical treatment, and then, together with conductor and compatriot Fritz Reiner, persuaded Serge Koussevitzky to commission from Bartók what eventually became his much-beloved Concerto for Orchestra. The work's success brought Bartók some measure of financial security and provided him with a much-needed emotional boost.|$|E

25|$|As {{part of the}} project, in 2015–2016, the {{concrete}} structure received new windows and new aluminium composite rainscreen cladding, in part to improve {{the appearance of the}} building.

25|$|Callwell’s 2 volume “Life and Diaries” in 1927 damaged Wilson’s {{reputation}} – the “New Statesman” {{thought they}} showed {{him to be}} “the typically stupid militarist…fundamentally a fool” Sir Charles Deedes, who had studied under him at Staff College and later served on his staff, commented that Wilson came across in the diaries as “an ambitious, volatile and even fatuous character, an intriguer concerned mainly with his own career” {{and that this was}} “far from the truth” – Deedes commented that Wilson’s ability to see <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> question and inability to make a decision and stick to it made him a poor corps commander but a “patient, lucid and fair” adviser. Lloyd George’s view in his own “War Memoirs” was essentially similar, although he wrote that Wilson was reluctant to take responsibility for decisions.|$|E
25|$|Using {{a special}} optical {{arrangement}} involving a 1/20 wave step in one mirror, Roy J. Kennedy (1926) and K.K. Illingworth (1927) (Fig.8) converted {{the task of}} detecting fringe shifts from the relatively insensitive one of estimating their lateral displacements to the considerably more sensitive task of adjusting the light intensity on <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sharp boundary for equal luminance. If they observed unequal illumination {{on either side of}} the step, such as in Fig.8e, they would add or remove calibrated weights from the interferometer until both sides of the step were once again evenly illuminated, as in Fig.8d. The number of weights added or removed provided a measure of the fringe shift. Different observers could detect changes as little as 1/300 to 1/1500 of a fringe. Kennedy also carried out an experiment at Mount Wilson, finding only about 1/10 the drift measured by Miller and no seasonal effects.|$|E
