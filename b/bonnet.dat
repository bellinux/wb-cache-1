5|$|In August 1718, <b>Bonnet</b> {{anchored}} the Royal James on an estuary of the Cape Fear River {{to careen}} and repair the ship. In late August and September, Colonel William Rhett, with the authorization of South Carolina governor Robert Johnson, led a naval expedition against pirates on the river. Rhett and Bonnet's men fought {{each other for}} hours, but the outnumbered pirates ultimately surrendered. Rhett arrested the pirates and brought them to Charles Town in early October. <b>Bonnet</b> escaped on 24October, but was recaptured on Sullivan's Island. On 10November, <b>Bonnet</b> was brought to trial and charged with two acts of piracy. Judge Nicholas Trott sentenced <b>Bonnet</b> to death. <b>Bonnet</b> wrote to Governor Johnson to ask for clemency, but Johnson endorsed the judge's decision, and <b>Bonnet</b> was hanged in Charles Town on 10December 1718.|$|E
5|$|On 10 November 1718, <b>Bonnet</b> {{was brought}} to trial before Sir Nicholas Trott, sitting in his {{capacity}} as Vice-Admiralty judge. Trott had already sat in judgment on Bonnet's crew and sentenced most of them to hang. <b>Bonnet</b> was formally charged with only two acts of piracy, against the Francis and the Fortune, whose commanders were on hand to testify against <b>Bonnet</b> in person. Ignatius Pell had turned King's evidence in the trial of Bonnet's crew and now testified, somewhat reluctantly, against <b>Bonnet</b> himself. <b>Bonnet</b> pleaded not guilty and conducted his own defence without assistance of counsel, cross-examining the witnesses to little avail, and calling a character witness in his favour. Trott rendered a damning summation of the evidence, and the jury delivered a guilty verdict. Two days later, after treating the convicted man to a stern lecture on his violation of Christian duties, Trott sentenced <b>Bonnet</b> to death.|$|E

5|$|Twelve {{days out}} of Delaware Bay, <b>Bonnet</b> entered the estuary of the Cape Fear River and {{anchored}} {{near the mouth of}} a small waterway now known as Bonnet's Creek. The Royal James had begun to leak badly and was in need of careening. Shortly afterwards, a small shallop entered the river and was captured. <b>Bonnet</b> had the shallop broken up to help repair the Royal James. The work of careening was done, in whole or in part, by the prisoners <b>Bonnet</b> had captured. <b>Bonnet</b> threatened at least one man with marooning if he did not work with the slaves to repair the Royal James. <b>Bonnet</b> remained in the Cape Fear River for the next 45 days. According to Bonnet's boatswain, Ignatius Pell, the pirates intended to wait out the hurricane season there.|$|E

5|$|<b>Bonnet</b> further {{tried to}} {{disguise}} {{his return to}} piracy by engaging in a pretence of trade with the next two vessels he robbed. Soon afterward, <b>Bonnet</b> quit the charade of trading and reverted to naked piracy. In July 1718, he cruised north to Delaware Bay, pillaging another eleven vessels. He took several prisoners, some of whom joined his pirate crew. While <b>Bonnet</b> set loose most of his prizes after looting them, he retained control {{of the last two}} ships he captured: the sloops Francis and Fortune. On 1August 1718, the Royal James and the two captured sloops sailed southward from Delaware Bay. The captured sloops lagged behind, and <b>Bonnet</b> threatened to sink them if they did not stay closer. During the passage, <b>Bonnet</b> and his crew divided their loot into shares of about £10 or £11 and distributed them amongst themselves. This is the only time <b>Bonnet</b> is known to have practised this important pirate custom, and it suggests he had by then abandoned his unorthodox practice of paying regular wages to his crew.|$|E

50|$|Under the French Second Empire, parasols {{took the}} place of {{protection}} from sun, and <b>bonnets</b> became smaller and smaller, until they could only be held {{on the head with}} hatpins.

5|$|<b>Bonnet</b> {{returned}} to Topsail Island {{to find that}} Blackbeard had beached {{the majority of their}} former crew, robbed the Revenge and two other vessels of the squadron of most of their supplies, and sailed away for parts unknown aboard the sloop Adventure, carrying all the loot with him. <b>Bonnet</b> now (probably late June or early July 1718) resumed command of the Revenge. Few, if any, of his original crew from Barbados were still aboard. <b>Bonnet</b> reinforced the Revenge by rescuing a number of men whom Blackbeard had marooned on a sandbar in Topsail Island.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after <b>Bonnet</b> resumed command, a bumboat's crew {{told him}} that Blackbeard was moored in Ocracoke Inlet. <b>Bonnet</b> set sail at once to hunt down his treacherous ex-confederate, but could not find him, and <b>Bonnet</b> never met Blackbeard again. Although <b>Bonnet</b> {{apparently}} never discarded his hopes of reaching St. Thomas and getting his letter of marque, two pressing problems now tempted him back into piracy. First, Blackbeard had stolen the food and supplies {{he and his men}} needed to subsist (one pirate testified at his trial that no more than ten or eleven barrels remained aboard the Revenge). Second, St. Thomas was now {{in the midst of the}} Atlantic hurricane season, which would last until autumn. However, returning to freebooting meant nullifying Bonnet's pardon.|$|E

During the night, <b>Bonnet</b> brought all of them aboard the Royal James and planned to fight his way out to sea in the morning rather than risk the Cape Fear River's narrow channels in the dark. <b>Bonnet</b> also {{wrote a letter to}} Governor Johnson, threatening to burn all the ships in Charles Town Harbour. At daybreak, on 27September 1718, <b>Bonnet</b> set sail toward Rhett's force, and all three sloops opened fire, initiating the Battle of Cape Fear River. The two South Carolinian sloops split up in an effort to bracket the Royal James. <b>Bonnet</b> tried to avoid the trap by steering the Royal James close to the river's western shore, but ran aground in the process. Rhett's closing sloops also ran aground, leaving only the Henry in range of the Royal James.|$|E

5|$|Bonnet's initial cruise {{took him}} to the coast of the Colony of Virginia, near the {{entrance}} of the Chesapeake Bay, where he captured and plundered four vessels, and burned the Barbadian ship Turbet to keep news of his crimes from his home island. He then sailed north to New York City, taking two more ships, and picking up naval supplies and releasing captives at Gardiners Island. By August 1717, <b>Bonnet</b> had returned to the Carolinas, where he attacked two more ships, a brigantine from Boston and a Barbadian sloop. He stripped the brigantine, but brought the cargo-filled Barbadian sloop to an inlet off North Carolina to use for careening and repairing the Revenge. After the Barbadian sloop's tackle was used to careen the Revenge, the ship was dismantled for timber, and the remains were then burned. In September 1717, <b>Bonnet</b> set course for Nassau, which was then an infamous pirate den on the island of New Providence in the Bahamas. En route, he encountered, fought, and escaped from a Spanish man of war. The Revenge was badly damaged, <b>Bonnet</b> was seriously wounded, and half the crew of the sloop was killed or wounded in the encounter. Putting in at Nassau, <b>Bonnet</b> replaced his casualties and refitted the Revenge, increasing the sloop's armament to twelve guns.|$|E
5|$|During {{the spring}} of 1717, Stede <b>Bonnet</b> {{decided to become a}} pirate, despite having no {{knowledge}} of shipboard life. He contracted a local shipyard to build him a sixty-ton sloop, which he equipped with ten guns and named the Revenge. This was unusual, as most pirates seized their ships by mutiny or boarding, or else converted a privateer vessel to a pirate ship. <b>Bonnet</b> enlisted a crew of more than seventy men. He relied on his quartermaster and officer for their knowledge of sailing, and as a result, he was not highly respected by his crew. In another break from tradition, <b>Bonnet</b> paid his crew wages, not shares of plunder as most pirates did. Royal Navy intelligence reported that he departed Carlisle Bay, Barbados under cover of darkness.|$|E
