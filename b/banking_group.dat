40|$|In {{this paper}} the pricing of a {{specific}} service of currency exchange based on the retail exchange rate spreads is studied on the example of four international <b>banking</b> <b>groups.</b> The {{aim of this study}} is to explore pricing of currency exchange services based on bid-ask differences in some commercial banks and possible price discrimination in this segment of market comparing the behaviour of Western mothers and Eastern daughters in European international <b>banking</b> <b>groups.</b> The retail currency rate spreads in different <b>bank</b> <b>groups</b> and countries are compared with each other. The main results of the study are that statistically significant differences exist in the spreads set by <b>banking</b> <b>groups</b> in different countries. All <b>banking</b> <b>groups</b> in the pilot sample offer more favourable rates in Western countries indicating that the pricing policy of <b>bank</b> <b>groups</b> may be discriminatory. The volatility of spreads over different currencies suggests that different decision making mechanisms may be present in the groups depending on the location of banking unit.
