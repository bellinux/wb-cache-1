5|$|After time expires, the chaser {{is given}} {{two minutes to}} catch the team by {{correctly}} answering {{a new series of}} questions, with each correct answer moving him one space along the board. If the chaser answers incorrectly or passes, the clock is stopped briefly and the team is given a chance to answer the question, which they may confirm among themselves <b>before</b> <b>answering.</b> A correct answer pushes the chaser back one space, or moves the team ahead by one if he has not moved on to the gameboard. An incorrect answer provides no movement for the chaser at all. Regardless of the outcome, the clock begins running again and the chaser continues to answer questions. If the chaser runs out of time before catching the team, the team splits the banked money equally, but if he catches them before time expires, the team leaves with no money. During celebrity episodes, if the chaser catches the team before time runs out, the team leaves with $15,000 divided equally.|$|E

25|$|Jack Benny has a {{reputation}} as a master of timing. Since his days in radio, he often explored the limits of timing for comedic purposes, like pausing a disproportionate amount of time <b>before</b> <b>answering</b> a question. Balzer described writing material for Benny as similar to composing music, with one element being the rhythm of delivery as equivalent to musical tempo.|$|E

25|$|As a {{condition}} of employment, workers {{may be required to}} answer their employer's narrowly defined questions regarding conduct on the job. If an employee invokes the Garrity rule (sometimes called the Garrity Warning or Garrity Rights) <b>before</b> <b>answering</b> the questions, then the answers cannot be used in criminal prosecution of the employee. This principle was developed in Garrity v. New Jersey, 385 U.S. 493 (1967). The rule is most commonly applied to public employees such as police officers.|$|E
25|$|When a {{hardware}} device triggers an interrupt, the operating system's kernel decides {{how to deal}} with this event, generally by running some processing code. The amount of code being run depends on the priority of the interrupt (for example: a person usually responds to a smoke detector alarm <b>before</b> <b>answering</b> the phone). The processing of hardware interrupts is a task that is usually delegated to software called a device driver, which may be part of the operating system's kernel, part of another program, or both. Device drivers may then relay information to a running program by various means.|$|E
2500|$|During his Formula One career, Häkkinen {{became known}} as a [...] "taciturn" [...] character—an {{individual}} who took lengthy pauses <b>before</b> <b>answering</b> questions placed before him and would give virtually nothing away to the media. This allowed him to prevent problems and potential scandals from within his team becoming public knowledge.|$|E

2500|$|After the May 2014 {{military}} coup, Pravit and {{a fellow}} journalist, Thanapol Eawsakul, were summoned by the military on 23 May 2014. <b>Before</b> <b>answering</b> the summons, Pravit told the Thai media, [...] "I hope people will not give up the spirit and that General Prayuth {{will be the last}} dictator of Thailand". He was said to have added: [...] "They can detain me, but can never detain my conscience". He thereupon taped his mouth shut and put his hands over his ears. On the following day he went with a lawyer and representatives of the UN to the headquarters of the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO). He was questioned for five hours without his lawyer being present and was then taken to an unidentified detention center.|$|E

2500|$|In Washington, Halleck {{continued}} to excel at administrative issues and facilitated the training, equipping, and deployment {{of thousands of}} Union soldiers over vast areas. He was unsuccessful, however, as a commander of the field armies or as a grand strategist. His cold, abrasive personality alienated his subordinates; one observer described him as a [...] "cold, calculating owl." [...] Historian Steven E. Woodworth wrote, [...] "Beneath the ponderous dome of his high forehead, the General would gaze goggle-eyed at those who spoke to him, reflecting long <b>before</b> <b>answering</b> and simultaneously rubbing both elbows all the while, leading one observer to quip that [...] "the great intelligence he was reputed to possess must be located in his elbows." [...] This disposition also made him unpopular with the Union press corps, who criticized him frequently.|$|E
2500|$|Love of God and Love of Neighbor. Two main {{questions}} arise from {{reflecting on the}} nature of love and its meaning in biblical faith: is it possible to love God without seeing him, and is it possible for love to be commanded? <b>Before</b> <b>answering</b> the question, it is quickly grounded that one must love their neighbor before they can love God, otherwise they are hypocritical. 1 Jn 4:20 says [...] "If anyone says, 'I love God,' and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen, cannot love God whom he has not seen". We can, therefore, love God whom we cannot see by loving our neighbor whom we can see. Loving our neighbor is loving God. In the same manner it shows that love can be and is demanded of us. God demands that we love others before we love God so that our love is blameless and pure and not hypocritical.|$|E
2500|$|In January 1944 the two {{boarded the}} Orient Express to Istanbul. After {{crossing}} the Bosphorus straits by ferry, they {{were subject to}} a vigorous search and debriefing by the British secret service as [...] "aliens" [...] from Nazi-occupied territory. The Rebbe, who generally weighed each question <b>before</b> <b>answering</b> it, exasperated the interrogator, who ordered the Rebbe and his brother arrested and held {{in the basement of}} the Syrian police house, together with another fifteen Jewish fugitives from Nazi Europe. Israel Chief Rabbi Chaim Herzog, who had planned to be in Turkey with a mission of rescue activists so he could greet the Rebbe upon his arrival, interceded with the British general, who agreed to release the weak and fragile Rebbe. Rabbi Mordechai was released later that evening, and the pair took the first train to Tripoli the next morning. On the outskirts of Beirut, they were greeted by a crowd of 200 Sephardim and 20 Israeli businessmen and hosted to a reception by local rabbis and dignitaries. They arrived at the old border station near Naqoura, Lebanon, on 3 February 1944 (9 Shevat 5704 – a date celebrated by Belzer Hasidim). Upon crossing the border into Israel, the Rebbe tore kriah. Thousands came out to greet them at each of their stops in Haifa, Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. They were also given positive newspaper coverage by religious and secular papers alike.|$|E

2500|$|During the American Civil War, {{mercenary}} Angel Eyes interrogates former Confederate soldier Stevens, whom Angel Eyes is {{contracted to}} kill, about Bill Carson, a fugitive who stole {{a cache of}} Confederate gold. Stevens offers Angel Eyes $1,000 to kill Baker, Angel Eyes's employer. Angel Eyes accepts the contract, and kills Stevens as he leaves. Angel Eyes returns to Baker for his fee, then shoots Baker, fulfilling his contract with Stevens. Meanwhile, Mexican bandit Tuco Ramírez is rescued from three bounty hunters by [...] "Blondie", who delivers him to the local sheriff to collect his $2,000 bounty. As Tuco {{is about to be}} hanged, Blondie severs Tuco's noose by shooting it, and sets him free. The two escape on horseback and split the bounty in a lucrative money-making scheme. They repeat the process in another town for more reward money. Blondie grows weary of Tuco's complaints, and abandons him penniless in the desert. A vengeful Tuco tracks Blondie to a town being abandoned by Confederate troops. As he prepares to force Blondie to hang himself, Union forces shell the town, allowing Blondie to escape. Following an arduous search, Tuco recaptures Blondie and force-marches him across a desert until Blondie collapses from dehydration. As Tuco prepares to shoot him, he sees a runaway carriage. Inside is a delirious Bill Carson, who promises Tuco $200,000 in Confederate gold, buried in a grave in Sad Hill Cemetery. Tuco demands to know the name on the grave, but Carson collapses from thirst <b>before</b> <b>answering.</b> [...] When Tuco returns with water, Carson has died and Blondie, slumped next to him, reveals that Carson recovered and told him the name on the grave before dying. [...] Tuco, who now has strong motivation to keep Blondie alive, gives him water and takes him to a nearby frontier mission to recover.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2006, Llewelyn-Bowen and {{his wife}} Jackie were offered {{a place on the}} Valentine's Day celebrity couples edition of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? They {{appeared}} on the show managing to reach the £1 million question, <b>before</b> <b>answering</b> it incorrectly and dropping down to £32,000 (a loss of £468,000). For the first time ever, Celador allowed Llewelyn-Bowen {{and his wife}} retry the show after the company claimed that the last question [...] "didn't meet their standards". After returning and being shown a different £1 million question, the couple decided not to risk losing £468,000 for the second time and won £500,000 for their chosen charity, The Shooting Star Children's Hospice, of which Llewelyn-Bowen and his wife are both patrons. Their new question was about the first man to travel to space twice, and the correct answer to the question was Gus Grissom. They decided not to risk it this time and walked away with the £500,000. This amount is the highest amount that any celebrity couple has won on any British edition of Who Wants To Be a Millionaire? The £468,000 they originally lost was also the greatest loss ever seen on the show, and no other contestant has ever answered the final question incorrectly in the United Kingdom version. The allegedly misleading question was [...] "Translated from the Latin, what is the United States motto?" [...] The answer given was [...] "In God We Trust" [...] which is originally English and has in fact been the motto of the United States since 1956. The intended answer had been [...] "One Out of Many" [...] which is a translation of the Latin phrase E pluribus unum, which is not actually the current United States motto. E pluribus unum had been the de facto motto but was never legally declared as such.|$|E
2500|$|The show's {{original}} three lifelines are [...] "50/50", {{in which}} the computer eliminates two of the incorrect answers; [...] "Phone a Friend", {{in which the}} contestant makes a thirty-second call to {{one of a number}} of friends (who provide their phone numbers in advance) and reads them the question and answer choices, after which the friend provides input; and [...] "Ask the Audience", in which audience members use touch pads to designate what they believe the correct answer to be, after which the percentage of the audience choosing each specific option is displayed to the contestant. In countries where the show is broadcast live, friends selected for Phone-a-Friend are alerted when their contestant begins to play the main game, and are told to keep the phone free and to wait for three rings <b>before</b> <b>answering.</b> Phone-a-Friend was removed from the U.S. version beginning with the episode that aired on 11 January 2010, after it was determined that there was an increasing trend of contestants' friends using web search engines and other Internet resources to assist them, which unfairly privileged individuals who had computer access over those who did not, and that it was contrary to the original intent of the lifeline, by which friends were supposed to provide assistance based on what they already knew. From 2004 to 2008, the U.S. version had a fourth lifeline called [...] "Switch the Question", earned upon answering question ten, in which the computer replaced, at the contestant's request, one question with another of the same monetary value; however, any lifelines used on the original question were not reinstated for the new question. Switch the Question returned as Cut the Question for a special week of shows with child contestants aired in 2014 (in the latter case, it could only be used on the first ten questions).|$|E
