25|$|The $162 Super Sport {{package was}} {{available}} on the upscale Malibu two-door hardtop and convertible models; the option added special exterior <b>brightwork</b> with SS emblems and the 14-inch full-disc wheel covers from the Impala SS. Inside, the vinyl bucket-seat interior featured a floor console for models equipped with the optional Muncie aluminum four-speed-manual or Powerglide two-speed automatic instead of the standard three-speed manual. Malibu SS also came with a four-gauge cluster in place of engine warning lights, and a dash-mounted tachometer was optional. The available 283-cubic-inch four-barrel V8 engine rated at 220-horsepower was the same rating as the 1957 Chevy Power-Pak 283 engine.|$|E
25|$|Available in 2006 Route 66 Edition was {{finished}} in either Solar Yellow or Black. This version featured Solar Yellow brake calipers, body-color grille, solar-tinted sunscreen glass, liftgate mounted spoiler, 17-inch all-season performance tires, four-wheel anti-lock brakes with low-speed traction control, speed control, and a sport suspension. <b>Brightwork</b> accents included chrome body-side moldings, a chrome exhaust tip and , chrome-plated, and five-spoke Empire aluminum wheels. Exterior identification included a 'Street Cruiser' badge with Solar Yellow accents on the liftgate and 'Route 66' badges {{on the front}} doors. A total of 1443 Route 66 models were produced in North America, with 142 of those equipped with 5 speed manual transmissions.|$|E
25|$|The 1967 models {{received}} {{nothing more}} than a touch-up after a restyling for 1966. All Novas got a crosshatch pattern that filled the deck lid trim panel. The Nova officially was still called the Chevy II Nova and had overtaken the bottom-rung Chevy II 100 in sales. The Chevy II 100 lacked {{much in the way of}} trim or <b>brightwork.</b> 1967 models carried significant improvements in the area of safety equipment. A government-mandated energy-absorbing steering column and safety steering wheel, soft interior parts such as armrests and sun visors, recessed instrument panel knobs, and front shoulder belt anchors, were included in all 1967 models.|$|E
50|$|Afterschool, weekend, holiday, {{and summer}} {{programming}} in San Francisco combines {{the resources and}} facility of <b>Brightworks</b> with the pedagogy of Tinkering School.|$|R
50|$|<b>Brightworks</b> is a K-12 school {{located in}} San Francisco and is {{dedicated}} to the principles of a child-centered, project-based engagement. Inspired by the success of Tinkering School, Gever Tulley started this alternative K-12 school.|$|R
50|$|Another popular {{cosmetic}} upgrade {{were the}} AMG body kits. These ranged from subtle front spoilers, to an aggressive Wide Body kits for the W126 coupes. Other options included Recaro seats, smaller diameter steering wheels, instrument clusters, chrome delete option (all <b>brightworks</b> colour-coded or painted satin black), refrigerators, shift knobs, hi-fi stereo systems, custom upholstery and enhanced interior wood packages.|$|R
25|$|The Consort {{was first}} {{shown at the}} 1956 Commercial Motor Show. It was a {{development}} of the Venturer, but {{in place of the}} previous oval the four-part grill was now enclosed by a near-trapezoidal outline (though actually hexagonal), wider at the top than the bottom, with the headlamps outside. Trim was revised to be much squarer in outline, featuring ribbed <b>brightwork,</b> and the curved rear quarter lights, first standardised on the Venturer III, were now incorporated into the main window line. However, a year later the Consort II was announced, re-introducing the oval grill outline of the Venturer – but now surrounding a plainer grill with chrome flash across the middle - while the trim lines so recently squared up were softened once again. The evident popularity of the oval- shaped grill then ensured its survival as a Plaxton hallmark for many years to come.|$|E
2500|$|January 1976 - Limited edition Chevette E {{introduced}} with L-type specification {{but with}} black rubber surrounds on windows, revised <b>brightwork</b> and vynide (plastic) seats. [...] U.S. version, the Chevrolet Chevette, is introduced as the smallest domestically-produced car there.|$|E
2500|$|Early 1960 models, {{particularly}} the V200 high-trim cars, featured extensive <b>brightwork</b> and ornamentation. An [...] chrome spear atop each front fender, an inner reveal {{ring on the}} deck lid's spare tire stamping, a [...] "V200" [...] nameplate on the dashboard, and stainless steel windshield and backlight reveal moldings, which were deleted from production, replaced with less costly flexible mylar-faced plastic locking strips—in approximately January, 1960. Early and late V200s had a continuous stainless steel molding following the tailfin crease as it swept {{down in front of}} the rear wheel, then continuing forward along the lower break line in both doors and the front fender. The radiator grille was brite-dipped stamped aluminum, and a central grille badge doubled as the hood release. Script [...] "Valiant" [...] callouts were placed in the center of the deck lid's spare-tire stamping and on each front fender.|$|E
50|$|Gever Tulley is an American writer, speaker, {{computer}} scientist, {{and founder}} of the <b>Brightworks</b> School and Tinkering School. His more recent work centers around the concept of students learning through building projects. He has delivered a TED talk on his work, published the book 50 Dangerous Things (You Should Let Your Children Do), and has contributed articles for many online media outlets.|$|R
5000|$|In 2011, Tulley {{opened the}} <b>Brightworks</b> School in San Francisco. The school expands upon {{the premise of}} his summer program, and {{students}} from grades K-12 learn through hands-on activities facilitated by adult [...] "collaborators". The school opened in September 2011 with an initial enrollment of 30 students. The school follows a curriculum called the [...] "Brightworks Arc" [...] which has three phases: exploration, expression, and exposition.|$|R
40|$|Creating {{sustainability}} initiatives {{within an}} organization can seem overwhelming. One {{of the keys}} to success is creating a sustainability team and giving them tools and techniques to help them develop a sustainability plan for their organization. UCSB, with the assistance of <b>Brightworks</b> Northwest (www. bwnw. com), is developing a Campus Sustainability Plan (CSP). The plan's approach is based on The Natural Step (wwww. naturalstep. org) framework. Among the challenges are learning how sustainability principles can benefit the campus community and how to incorporate sustainability into the campus culture and business operations. A critical step in that process is to provide campus members with information that identifies the use of resources and emissions of wastes at the level where responsibility lies. Most sustainability audit systems now report only the campus aggregate flows, where the impact of individuals, departments, buildings, etc. is diluted in the totals. We submit {{that it is necessary to}} disaggregate the information to the appropriate level of accountability (and reward). This suggests the need for a spatial information system design that links the flow of energy and materials through the campus with the spatial features for which accounting is required. Thus this is more than merely a geographic information system database of the campus but a “smart...|$|R
2500|$|Little {{change was}} made for 1960. The new models were {{refinements}} of the 1959 style with a much more restrained front end, {{the return of the}} double cone tail lights of 1958 rather than the startling [...] "cat's eyes" [...] of 1959. Under the hood, things remained constant. Fuel injection was no longer available, but with the 348 cubic inch engine, a horsepower rating of 335 at 5800rpm was now achieved. This involved the use of three double-barrel carburettors, a special cam and an 11.25:1 compression ratio, all sold as a package. Body style offerings followed 1959, with hardtops and sedans available. [...] The convertible was reserved for the Impala series. [...] The Bel Air Sport Sedan continued to use a rear window overhang and a huge wraparound rear window. Bel Airs (and Biscaynes) had two tail lights per side; the Impalas had three tail lights per side—a situation that would persist for most years through 1975. Many of the same options and accessories that were available on the Impala were also available on the Bel Air. The Bel Airs had more interior and exterior <b>brightwork</b> than the Biscayne.|$|E
50|$|Extensive use {{is made of}} <b>brightwork.</b> Up to four beaded chrome strips {{run along}} the side of the vehicle, as well as ribbed skirt panels. The front grille and {{headlights}} are contained within a distinctive chrome surround which merges with the side <b>brightwork.</b>|$|E

50|$|O'Toole co-produced {{his fourth}} album, <b>Brightwork,</b> with Damon and Ilya Toshinsky and {{released}} {{it on his}} personal record label, PTO Records. His latest album, Jaded, also on PTO, was released in June 2014.|$|E
50|$|January 1976 - Limited edition Chevette E {{introduced}} with L-type specification {{but with}} black rubber surrounds on windows, revised <b>brightwork</b> and vynide (plastic) seats. U.S. version, the Chevrolet Chevette, is introduced as the smallest domestically-produced car there.|$|E
50|$|On boats, {{particularly}} wooden boats, <b>brightwork</b> {{is exposed}} metal and varnished woodworking, though amongst the yachting set it more often {{refers to the}} woodwork. The metal is usually brass or bronze that is kept polished, or stainless steel, which requires less maintenance. In the past, due to the environmental exposure experienced by boats, corrosion and UV damage made maintaining <b>brightwork</b> both Sisyphean and extremely labor-intensive. However, {{with the development of}} improved UV-absorbers and filters in the chemical composition of the various marine varnishes (spar varnish, polyurethane, or linear polyurethane), this work is not as intensive as it once was. Varnished finishes are maintained by sanding and re-finishing, and metalwork is maintained by polishing.|$|E
50|$|The twin central <b>brightwork</b> strips run {{together}} {{along the}} side, separating {{close to the}} rear end and enclosing the badge. Twin round rear lights are arranged vertically at {{each side of the}} boot. An illuminated fleetname display is normally fitted above the boot.|$|E
50|$|The deckhouse, pilot {{house and}} all {{exterior}} <b>brightwork</b> were {{made out of}} teak wood. Furnishings and equipment on Caritas were worthy of being classed among the handsomest and most luxurious yachts of the time. Caritas was powered {{with a pair of}} 125 hp Winton gasoline engines and a speed of 12 mph.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Daimler" [...] {{name was}} applied to the highest trim level of the X300 cars, and {{featured}} all the chrome <b>brightwork</b> found on the Sovereign cars, plus chromed doors mirrors, chromed door handles, and a fluted radiator grille surround. The Daimler Six model was equipped with the AJ16 engine, and the Daimler Double Six with the V12.|$|E
5000|$|The {{demanding}} {{labor of}} <b>brightwork</b> maintenance {{has been a}} storied part of maritime life for some 250 years, since before the days of William Mountaine and The Seaman's Vade-Mecum (first published 1744). As a result, it is occasionally {{referred to in the}} broader culture. For example, in the song [...] "When I was a Lad" [...] from the Gilbert and Sullivan comic opera, H.M.S. Pinafore, in which Sir Joseph Porter, the First Lord of the Admiralty, recounts that he climbed the political ladder in large part by his ability to [...] "polish up the handle of the big front door". Lord Nelson might have cast a jaundiced eye on such an attitude, but surely those brave boat owners who persevere in completing their own <b>brightwork</b> varnishing project will feel that they have [...] "gained the most splendid and decisive victory", albeit one that was perhaps [...] "dearly purchased".|$|E
5000|$|The show car for 1955 was {{an ivory}} white fixed-head coupé {{based on a}} DK400 chassis. The car was called [...] "Golden Zebra"; all <b>brightwork</b> inside and out was in gold plate and the seats and door panels were {{upholstered}} in zebra skin. The mascot on the radiator grille was a gold-plated miniature zebra sculpture. Lady Docker's initials were inscribed on the door.|$|E
50|$|Beginning {{with the}} basic body, buyers of the Del Rio were offered a unique {{two-tone}} paint scheme (optional), better quality interior and exterior <b>brightwork</b> (including gold anodized aluminum accents) and a higher grade vinyl upholstery. Del Rio buyers also had their choice of either Ford’s “Mileage Maker” 144 hp six or its “Thunderbird” 312 hp V-8. The Del Rio was equipped with 11-inch front drum brakes.|$|E
50|$|The {{body was}} {{shared with the}} four-cylinder Vauxhall Wyvern, a pattern that {{continued}} with subsequent versions of the Velox until {{the introduction of the}} more compact Vauxhall Victor at the beginning of 1957. While the Velox exterior differed only in badging, additional <b>brightwork</b> and different coloured wheels, the interior boasted superior seating materials over the Wyvern including a central arm rest in the rear.|$|E
50|$|The Harrington Legionnaire was a square-rigged {{body with}} {{straight}} waistrail and five deep windows per side. It also {{differed from the}} Harrington Cavalier and Harrington Grenadier by having plated window surrounds, {{there was a large}} <b>brightwork</b> grille and twin headlights, a Harrington Grenadier-style front windscreen was used with a similar sized one at the rear. Above the windscreen was a destination box of illuminated nameboard and above that a prominent peak.|$|E
50|$|The Lancia 2000 and 2000 HF coupé were technologically {{advanced}} {{for the day}} with features such as 5 speed transmission, power assisted steering and electronic fuel injection on the 2000 HF. The cars offer sporty but also very refined and comfortable transport and are very capable in modern traffic and motorway cruising. They are very well appointed with polished stainless steel <b>brightwork,</b> as opposed to chromed mild steel.|$|E
50|$|Gianforte co-founded <b>Brightwork</b> Development Inc., a {{software}} company, in 1986; {{he and his}} partners sold the company to McAfee Associates for $10 million in 1994. He then moved to Bozeman, Montana. Gianforte founded RightNow Technologies in 1997. The company went public in 2004 and was sold to Oracle Corporation for $1.5 billion in 2011. Before the sale, RightNow Technologies employed about 500 people at its headquarters in Bozeman, Montana, and over 1000 people in total.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to its entry-level base model, the Acclaim was initially available in mid-range LE and high-end LX trim. LE and LX models came equipped with features such including premium cloth seating, power windows/door locks, premium sound systems, bodyside cladding, additional exterior <b>brightwork,</b> and on the latter 15-inch lace-spoke aluminum wheels. In spite of this, the base model accounted for nearly 85 percent of Acclaim sales. Unlike the Spirit, the Acclaim did not receive any sport-oriented models.|$|E
5000|$|Two trim {{levels were}} offered in North America, with a no-frills {{two-seater}} and a fully equipped 2+2 GL. The GL package was also {{available for the}} two-seater, carrying the full equipment list. Leather seats were optional, and an optional digital instrument cluster was introduced in 1982. The T-bar roof was available on both bodystyles, but only {{in combination with the}} GL package. A [...] "Blackout" [...] package, without most of the chrome <b>brightwork,</b> was available for the standard two-seater.|$|E
50|$|Standard {{equipment}} {{included the}} Starfire's 345 hp (257 kW) 394 cubic-inch Rocket V8 engine, but lacked its automatic transmission, power steering, power brakes, leather interior, and distinctive <b>brightwork</b> trim. Included were bucket seats, center console, carpeting, full wheel covers, and padded instrument panel. A three-speed column-shift manual transmission was standard, with a three-speed Roto Hydra-matic automatic with console-mounted T-handle shifter optional. Adding just automatic transmission, power steering, and power brakes brought the 4028 lb Jetstar I's price close to $4,000.|$|E
50|$|A ship's galley, pantry, {{and eating}} areas are {{notoriously}} {{hard to keep}} clean and sanitary, and this activity keeps the steward's assistant busy {{for much of his}} time. The steward's assistant must clean the ship's mess and officer's saloon, and the gear in both. This includes keeping the decks clean by sweeping and scrubbing. The steward's assistant disposes of trash and keeps garbage cans clean. Other tasks could include defrosting and cleansing refrigerators, cleaning <b>brightwork</b> and woodwork, and removing grease and finger marks from paintwork.|$|E
