40|$|ABSTRACT The {{sustainability}} of traditional farming systems {{in many parts}} of Africa is threatened by losses in the variety of species, reduction in land, forest, soil and water resources under demographic pressure. Together with foreign influences these farming system are no longer in equilibrium with local culture and ecology and are therefore disintegrating {{due to the lack of}} local capacity to adjust to these changes. This has led to environmental degradation. The paper employs a combination of qualitative and quantitative techniques to: analyse the farming systems, assess the effect of cropping intensification on the climatic climax vegetation, and to establish the post-cultivation vegetation successions in fallows. It reports four crop fallow rotations: crop 3 years with 1 year <b>bush</b> fallow, <b>crop</b> 5 years with 1 - 2 year <b>bush</b> fallow, <b>crop</b> 10 years with 1 - 3 year bush fallow and continuous cropping. The post-cultivation successions present a plagioclimax dominated by Hyparhenia species with scattered shrubs maintained by cycles of cultivation and burning. The paper concludes that these shifting cultivation cycles involving cropping intensification and post cultivation savannization have deprived the farming system of its ecological benefits, that is, nutrient recycling through a long and mature fallow. The inability of the vegetation to reconstitute itself requires the development of farming systems that combine trees and crops in the field because of proven micro-ecological and ecological benefits. The paper therefore identifies the scope for the development of ecologically sustainable agro-ecosystems as a development path for shifting cultivation systems...|$|R

The 2,4,5-T and 2,4-D (Agent Orange) were used to clear lines of communication and wipe out food crops as part of this strategy and in 1952, trioxone, and mixtures of the aforementioned herbicides, were sent along a number of key roads. From June to October 1952, 1,250 acres of roadside vegetation at possible ambush points were sprayed with defoliant, described as a policy of “national importance”. The British reported that the use of herbicides and defoliants could be effectively replaced by removing vegetation by hand and the spraying was stopped. However, after this strategy failed, the use of herbicides and defoliants in effort to fight the insurgents was restarted under the command of British General Sir Gerald Templer in February 1953, as a means of destroying food crops grown by communist forces in jungle clearings. Helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft despatched STCA and Trioxaone, along with pellets of chlorophenyl N,N-Dimethyl-1-naphthylamine onto crops such as sweet potatoes and maize. Many Commonwealth personnel who handled and/or used Agent Orange during, and in the decades after, the conflict suffered from serious exposure to dioxin and Agent Orange, which also caused major soil erosion to areas of Malaya. An estimated 10,000 civilians and insurgents in Malaya also suffered heavily from the effects of the defoliant (though many historians agree it was likely more than this number given that Agent Orange was used on a large scale in the Malayan conflict and unlike the US, the British government manipulated the numbers and kept its secret very tight in fear of negative world public opinion).|$|R

This study proposes and tests an alternative methodology for quantifying the drift potential (DP) of air blast sprayers, trying to avoid the difficulties faced in conducting field trials according to the standard protocol (ISO 22866 : 2005). For this purpose, an ad hoc test bench designed for DP comparative measurements was used. The proposed methodology was evaluated in terms of robustness, repetitiveness and coherence by arranging a series of trials at two laboratories. Representative orchard and vineyard air blast sprayers in eight configurations (combination of two forward speeds, two air fan flow rates, and two nozzle types) were tested. The test bench was placed perpendicular to the spray track to collect the fraction of spray liquid remaining in the air after the spray process and potentially susceptible to drift out of the treated area. Downwind spray deposition curves were obtained and a new approach was proposed to calculate an index value of the DP estimation that could allow the differences among the tested configurations to be described. Results indicated that forward speed of 1. 67 m/s allows better discrimination among configurations tested. Highest DP reduction, over 87. 5 %, was achieved using the TVI nozzles in combination with low air fan flow rate in both laboratories; conversely, the highest DP value was obtained with the ATR nozzles in combination with high air fan flow rate.

The catchment water balance was analyzed by considering vegetation types with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), determining evapotranspiration rates by combining sap flow measurements and NDVI values, recorded precipitation, measured river discharge and groundwater levels from November 2010 to October 2011. A simple water balance computation, a steady state groundwater flow model, and a transient groundwater flow model were used to assess water balance changes under different land use scenarios. It was shown that 91 % of the precipitation is consumed by the <b>crops,</b> <b>bushes</b> and trees; only 9 % of the annual precipitation becomes net groundwater recharge which maintains a stable stream discharge in observed year. Four land use scenarios were formulated for assessing the impacts of land use changes on the catchment water balance, the river discharge, and groundwater storage in the Bulang catchment. The scenarios are: (1) the quasi natural state of the vegetation covered by desert grasses; (2) the current land use/vegetation types; (3) the change of crop types to dry resistant crops; and (4) the ideal land use covered by dry resistant crops and desert grasses, These four scenarios were simulated and compared with measured data from 2011, which was a dry year. Furthermore, the scenarios (2) and (4) were evaluated under normal and wet conditions for years in 2009 and 2014, respectively. The simulation results show that replacing current vegetation and crop types with dry resistant types can significantly increase net groundwater recharge which leads to the increase of groundwater storage and river discharges. The depleted groundwater storage during the dry year could be restored during the normal and wet years so that groundwater provides a reliable resource to sustain river discharge and the dependent vegetations in the area.

40|$|Despite {{the strong}} {{reduction}} in rainfall observed after 1968, {{the water table}} of some endorheic areas in the Sahel {{has been found to}} be rising over the last several decades. It has been previously demonstrated that this is due to land use changes which have led to a severe increase in runoff and erosion. In such areas, the excess in runoff causes a strong increase in the number of ponds, their sizes and thus, their duration. Ponds have been identified as the main zones of deep infiltration of water. The aim of this study was to investigate whether other areas of the Sahelian region could also be defined as deep infiltration ones as well, and then, whether they were contributing to aquifer recharge. Soil water content was surveyed for five consecutive years (2004 - 2008) by implementing a set of measurement devices at different depths. The hydrologic water balance was monitored at stream flow gauge stations located upstream and downstream of two small endorheic catchments. The observed replacement of <b>bush</b> vegetation by <b>crops</b> and fallow areas led to the appearance of extended bare soil areas due to both aeolian and hydric erosion, triggering a strong reduction in soil infiltrability under millet fields and fallow lands as well as in the soil water holding capacity. It also resulted in the formation of a great number of gullies and sand sediment deposits in the endorheic areas. Measurements showed that sandy deposits correspond in fact to large areas of deep infiltration: tens of thousands of cubic meters of water infiltrated catchments of less than 1 km(2). Runoff decreased by up to 50 % in the sandy deposit areas, while infiltration (close to 1300 mm h(- 1)) was observed up to depths of 10 m.

According to the article 8 of the European Directive, the Official Service Direcção-Geral de Agricultura e Desenvolvimento Rural (DGADR) of the Agriculture Ministry, developed the Portuguese law Decreto-Lei n. º 86 / 2010 de 15 de Julho, in 2010, to impose that mounted sprayers, trailed sprayers and self-propelled sprayers must be inspected and approved before 26 November, 2016. The sprayers inspections carried out in Portugal should be an important tool to assess the sprayers in use and decide the best action plan to implement the article 8. Despite the sprayers inspections had been done mostly {{as a consequence of the}} European and National market rules, and so, the data collected are a rough sample of the real Portuguese situation, it is possible to observe that only one-third, of the sprayers inspected until now, have less than 5 years old. This means that the majority of the sprayers may not be in accordance with the standards and the article 8 of the European Directive...|$|R
40|$|In Babati district, Tanzania, agro-forestry {{land use}} system has been {{traditionally}} used for hundreds of years. It is a multi layer system with trees and/or <b>bushes</b> integrated with <b>crops.</b> That knowledge has been extended in the district through the land management programme, LAMP. It {{is said to be}} a “win-win” system with both economic and ecologic benefits. For a {{land use system}} to be sustainable, three spheres have to incorporate to reach a balanced development; the economic sphere, the ecologic sphere and the social sphere. To achievesustainable development, one sphere can not develop without the others. This study aims tosee if agro-forestry in Babati district balances all three spheres, if it is a proper tool toward sustainable development. It is a qualitative case study with semi-structured interviews with farmers in Babati and one interview in Sweden. The fieldwork in Babati where held under two weeks, based on interviews with farmers who practice agro-forestry and farmers who do not, and their opinion about it. The result indicates that it employs a lot of people and that the economy among farmers in the district has improved. Most farmers say their economy is more secure, because it is a multipurpose system and most people can adopt the technologies because high costs or advanced technology are not required. Farmers benefit from the ecosystem services provided from agro-forestry, for example water catchment and decreased soil erosion which also improves the environment. Soils regain their fertility and the land use becomes more resilient when trees integrate with crops. Many farmers believe the equity between gender has improved and that condition for women improves when fuel wood can be gathered from trees on the farm instead of walking long distances to a forest. The conclusion is that agro-forestry in Babati district fulfill more or less all three sustainability spheres and is a useful tool towards sustainable development, but has not yet reached full potential, there are possibilities for improvements and to scale up for greater benefits for all three spheres...|$|R

40|$|Assessment of {{vertical}} spray profile {{is one of}} the main steps to adjust sprayers for <b>bush</b> and tree <b>crops,</b> as it allows to verify that the spray plume matches the target canopy profile. The equipment used for assessing the vertical spray profile is typically a vertical test bench or patternator. Even if the sprayer adjustment is recommended in EU Directive 128 / 2009 /EC, the use {{of vertical}} test benches is only optional in the procedures for the inspection of air-assisted sprayers in use currently adopted in the EU Member States, that mainly refer to EN 13790 - 2 and to new ENISO FDIS 16122 - 3. At present, in the International Standards, there is not any indication of the minimum requirements that the vertical test benches have to fulfill, neither in terms of constructive characteristics or of functional parameters. For this reason, the types of vertical test benches used in the test stations, even if are based on the same principle of functioning (presence of a vertical surface to collect the whole liquid sprayed and of graduated tubes for measuring it), present some differences in terms of structure, mainly related to collectors types and their disposal along the test bench. Two main categories of vertical test benches can be identified: 1) equipped with a continuous collecting wall; 2) equipped with a discrete number of separated collectors. In each category it is then possible to have different models, depending on the size, materials, number and position of the collectors. With the main purpose to define methodology and criteria for the vertical patternator evaluation, specific performance tests were carried out in laboratory using four different types of vertical test benches and a horizontal test bench complying with ISO 5682 - 1 requirements. Spray recovery capacity and reproducibility of results, both in terms of recovery and of spray profile were assessed using different droplet sizes, air speeds and air directions. Results of these first experimental trials pointed out that the criteria applied to assess the performance of the vertical test benches seemed able to discriminate the differences between the models tested. Amount of spray recovery was mostly affected by droplets size rather than by air velocity. Spray profile detected on the different vertical patternator types examined resulted generally similar. These first experimental results could constitute a basis for the development of a SPISE advice about test methodology and requirements for vertical test benches...|$|R
40|$|Land-use/cover {{changes have}} taken place in South Eastern Tanzania with as a result a decline in natural vegetation. Land use change coupled with {{anticipated}} climate change has lead to accelerated land degradation in terms of soil erosion, loss in biodiversity and changed hydrological cycles. Changes in land use if not properly managed {{goes hand in hand with}} soil erosion. This study was conducted to assess land use/cover change and its linkage to soil erosion visavis runoff and soil loss from the major land utilization types (LUTs) in cashew cropping system under natural rainfall for the period 2008 - 2010. The overall aim of the study was to establish optimal land use management and soil and water conservation practices for soil erosion control and enhanced agricultural productivity in the cashew growing areas of South Eastern Tanzania. The LUTs include cashew orchards (grove), bare maize (BC) as well as soil management or conservation measures: bare land (BL) as a control, field with residues (CR), lemon grass strips (LG), ridges and furrows (RF) and bush fallow land (BF). These LUTs are commonly practiced in South Eastern Tanzania. South Eastern Tanzania is a major cashew nut (Anacardium occidentale L.) production area in Tanzania. More than 50 % of the production comes from the Makonde Plateau and inland plains. The Makonde plateau consists of deep highly weathered sandy soils and the inland plains consist of clayey soils. Principally the soils are suitable for cashew nut production and for cereal crops as sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) and finger millet (Eleusine coracana). The production of cashew nut which was introduced in the 1960 s is linked to the soil erosion in the area. There are no management practices for soil and water conservation in cashew orchards tested so far. Maize (Zea mays L) is among the cereal crops grown in cashew orchards during early stages of cashew growing and also for cashew-maize intercropping systems. So far, very little scientific information is available on the effectiness of soil and water conservation measures in this system. Maize is an important staple food as well as a cash crop in South Eastern Tanzania. In the first step of the research, land use/cover change was analyzed by comparing land-use/cover maps derived from aerial photographs of 1965 with maps derived from satellite images of 2002, where we assessed how land-use changed in six villages on the Makonde plateau, and relate these to local and global drivers. Land-use/cover changes are complex processes, which we analyzed by determining the relative net changes, losses, persistence and gains of each land-use/cover categories. From selected six villages (two representative villages for each landscape - Makonde dissected plateau, Makonde high plateau and escarpment) on the Makonde plateau occupying 13034 ha, the area under cashew orchards (grove) in 1960 s was 216 ha while in 2000 s it had increased to 3117 ha. Widespread planting of cashew trees started in the 1960 s; while the villagisation program in the 1970 s, altered settlement patterns as centrally planned villages were created. Population growth and rural development policies were major local drivers for land-use/cover change; international trade and technological innovations were principal global drivers. Though population increase led to a reduction of natural vegetation, the spread of cashew trees resulted in a case of more people, more trees. Agricultural production in South Eastern Tanzania, involves conversion of natural vegetation to agricultural crops mainly cashew groves and other annual cereal crops. This land-use change has been linked to different forms of soil erosion including interrill and rill and gully erosion occurrences in the area. Assessment of the effect of major LUTs on runoff generation due to land-use during the three rainy seasons (2008 - 2010) was measured under seven treatments: cashew orchard (grove), bare maize as well as bare land as a control, maize with either residues in the field, lemon grass strips, or ridges and furrows and last but not least, bush fallow land; the latter five treatments can be regarded as soil management or conservation measures. The experiment was implemented in two sites representing the countrys most important cashew production area: Naliendele on the Makonde Pleateau and Nachingwea in the Inland Plains. Total seasonal rainfall varied from 593 to 1109 mm on the Makonde plateau and from 294 to 752 mm on the inland plains. Mean seasonal runoff coefficients (mm/mm) ranged from 0. 10 for bare land to < 0. 01 for bush fallow land; under cashew groves runoff coefficients were much higher than under natural vegetation (0. 01 to 0. 03). As a consequence of surface crusting, runoff occurs at rainfall intensities (4 - 9 mm/day) that are much lower than the saturated hydraulic conductivity (119 - 833 mm/h). Though the sandy soils of the Makonde plateau are particularly sensitive to generating runoff, these soils are also more responsive to soil and water conservation measures. This insight is important for devising soil and water conservation strategies in these two contrasting landscape units. Field measured model factors are however scarce for tropical regions. We derived RUSLE factors for several soil conservation measures among the LUTs based on three seasons of field plot measurements (2008 - 2010), in two contrasting landscape units of South Eastern Tanzania, the countrys most important cashew growing area. Whereas the derived factors are useful for applying RUSLE in similar environments, this study points to the importance of understanding differences between soil types and landscape units when assessing potential soil erosion. On the Makonde plateau, rainfall erosivity was higher than on the inland plains (7130 vs 5783 MJ mm ha- 1 h- 1 year- 1). The soil erodibility K factor was higher (0. 014 t h MJ- 1 mm- 1) on the sandy Cutanic Acrisols of the Makonde plateau than on the clayey Acric Ferralsols (0. 006 t h MJ- 1 mm- 1) of the inland plains. Likewise, soil loss on the Makonde plateau was much higher than on the inland plains (e. g. for maize 33 - 127 t ha- 1 season- 1 vs 3 - 10 t ha- 1 season- 1). The differences between the C factor for maize, and for maize with crop residues, as well as the differences between the P factors for lemon grass strips and ridges and furrows indicate that although soils of the Makonde plateau are more susceptible to soil erosion, these soils are also more responsive to soil conservation measures compared to soils of the inland plains. Farmers local technique of making ridges and furrows is particularly effective. Furthermore, the C factors for cashew groves are one order of magnitude lower (0. 08 - 0. 09) than for maize, or for maize with crop residues (0. 2 - 0. 7), but are still much higher than for bush fallow (0. 001). Deforestation for agriculture hence bears the risk of increasing soil erosion rates; however, this risk can be minimised by growing cashew trees. To conclude, the dissertation shows a significant contribution towards establishing optimal soil and water conservation measures for South Eastern Tanzania. This is important in view of the fact that South Eastern Tanzania has experienced major land-use transformations over the past 50 years. Population increase and introduction of cashew trees in the 1960 s led to a massive clearing of natural vegetation and reduced bush fallow. Under this scenario soil conservation should be a priority in South Eastern Tanzania. The evaluated soil management practices are important soil and water conservation measures for sustainability of cashew nut and cereal crops production in South Eastern Tanzania. As demonstrated in the dissertation, the practice of ridges and furrows locally known as matuta can be an important part of the solution.

40|$|International audienceCarbon (C) and {{associated}} nutrient budgets related to land use in agro-ecosystems in West African savannas (WAS) are {{a matter of}} both local (sustainability of farming systems) and global (C balance) concern. In a mixed-farming system in southern Senegal, patterns of C, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) allocation in the plant-soil system (down to a 40 cm soil depth) were compared at harvest in 14 plots, six being under semi-permanent cultivation with groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.), others being under continuous cultivation with millet (Pennisetum glaucum L.), maize (Zea mays L.) or rice (Oryza sativa L.). Carbon stored in the plant-soil system amounted to 25. 0, 27. 4, 34. 9 and 71. 9 t per ha, respectively, in groundnut, millet, maize and rice fields. Ninety percent of C and P (total in plant P-t, available P in soil (POD)) and 95 % of N of the whole ecosystem were stored in the soil. The high C and nutrient amounts found in rice plots were attributed to the clayey texture of the soil and to seasonal flooding. The lower values for C, N and POD found in soils in the <b>bush</b> ring (groundnut <b>crops)</b> compared {{to those of the}} compound ring (millet and maize crops) stemmed from land management. Higher values for C, N and POD in soils in the compound ring were maintained under continuous cultivation thanks to higher organic and nutrient inputs originating from crop residue recycling, manuring and, in the maize plots, spreading of household wastes. In the compound ring, the amount of C stored seemed to depend as much on the amount of C input as on the chemical richness of organic inflow. The effect of land management (bush versus compound ring) on soil properties was generally restricted to the 0 - 20 cm layer (except for P, cations and pH), and the better soil status in the compound ring was linked to nutrient depletion of the bush ring. From the perspective of global change, the estimated potential of the WAS for C sequestration under continuous cultivation was found to be low. From a methodological point of view, soil carbon status may be considered as a relevant indicator for the fertility of agro-ecosystems in the WAS belt, provided that its biotic components are included, and that both the quality and dynamics of soil organic matter (assessment of seasonal variations, and C flows) and soil texture are characterised.

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{topography}} and mixed pixels on L-band radiometric observations over land {{needs to be}} quantified to improve the accuracy of soil moisture retrievals. For this purpose, a series of simulations has been performed with an improved version of the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) End-to-End Performance Simulator (SEPS). The brightness temperature (TB) generator of SEPS has been modified to include a 100 -m-resolution land cover map and a 30 -m-resolution digital elevation map of Catalonia (northeast of Spain). This highresolution TB generator allows {{the assessment of the}} errors in soil moisture retrieval algorithms due to limited spatial resolution and provides a basis for the development of pixel disaggregation techniques. Variation of the local incidence angle, shadowing, and atmospheric effects (up- and downwelling radiation) due to surface topography has been analyzed. THE AVAILABILITY of high-resolution brightness temperature (TB) maps at L-band is crucial to analyze important issues dealing with bare and vegetation-covered land emission and to develop inversion algorithms in preparation for real Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission data. Mixed-pixel, coastlines, shadowing, and topography effects on the measured brightness temperatures need further study, but the lack of global geophysical data at sufficient temporal and spatial resolution and the large amount of data involved in the generation of high-resolution TB maps on a global basis complicate the issue. In fact, in spite of the existence of global digital elevation models with sufficient spatial resolution, accurate land cover data do not exist for most parts of the world. To address these issues, a series of simulations has been performed with an improved version of the SMOS End-to-End Performance Simulator (SEPS) [1], [2], in which, to date, all points on Earth have been assumed to be at sea level. The study has been done over the region of Catalonia, on the northeastern coast of Spain, because of its many different land cover types, topography, and the presence of a coastline. A 30 -m-resolution digital elevation map [3] and a 100 -m-resolution land coverage map of Catalonia [4] have been used as inputs, and SEPS has been conveniently modified to generate high-resolution TB maps of this area. A variety of soil and land cover types (<b>crops,</b> <b>bushes,</b> marshes, etc.) have been parameterized using the values obtained from field experiments and literature [5]–[10], [12]. The impact of topography and mixed pixels on L-band radiometric observations over land needs to be quantified to improve the accuracy of soil moisture retrievals.
