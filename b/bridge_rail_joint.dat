40|$|Precast {{concrete}} <b>bridge</b> <b>rail</b> systems offer {{several advantages}} over traditional cast-in-place rail designs, including reduced construction time and costs, installation {{in a wide}} range of environmental conditions, easier maintenance and repair, improved railing quality, and greater flexibility for aesthetic treatments. The objective of this project was to develop a precast concrete <b>bridge</b> <b>rail</b> system that met the TL- 4 impact safety standards provided in MASH. The design criteria for the new <b>bridge</b> <b>rail</b> system included criteria for barrier geometry, provisions for open and closed rail options, constructability, weight limitations, segment length, design impact loads, connection of barrier segments, and connection to the bridge deck among other factors. The research effort proceeded in several phases. First, the research focused on determining the overall concept for the new <b>bridge</b> <b>rail</b> system in terms of the rail configuration and geometry as well as the required barrier reinforcement. Next, design concepts for the <b>joints</b> connecting adjacent <b>rail</b> segments were designed and subjected to dynamic component testing in order to select a design capable of meeting design criteria for the precast <b>bridge</b> <b>rail</b> system. After selection of an appropriate <b>rail</b> <b>joint,</b> the researchers developed connection details for the attachment of the <b>rail</b> to the <b>bridge</b> deck. Once the design of the various precast <b>bridge</b> <b>rail</b> components was completed, a complete set of CAD details for the prototype precast concrete <b>bridge</b> <b>rail</b> system were completed. Following the design effort, recommendations were made regarding the full-scale testing required to implement the new, precast concrete <b>bridge</b> <b>rail</b> system...|$|R

3000|$|Enormous {{work has}} been done to explore the {{influence}} of magnetic field inhomogeneity due to joint gaps. Okano [...] et al. (2004) and Lin et al. (2011) calculated the magnetic field inhomogeneity between two segments of the conventional unimodal magnetic rail and put forward some improvement countermeasures. The cost of the Halbach-type magnetic rail is just about 38  % of that of conventional unimodal magnetic rail per kilometer (Wang et al. 2002 and Del-Valle et al. 2011), while the levitation efficiency (N/cm 3) is about 2.85 times larger (Deng et al. 2008), and thus has been widely used or reformed for the maglev applications (Guo et al. 2010; Deng et al. 2013; Boughrara et al. 2013). But until recently, the method to improve magnetic field homogeneity of the Halbach-type magnetic <b>rail</b> with <b>joint</b> gaps is so limited {{that it is necessary to}} optimize the Halbach-type magnetic <b>rail</b> <b>joint</b> to guarantee the riding comfort of the HTS maglev vehicle. In this paper, the magnetic field inhomogeneity over normal <b>rail</b> <b>joint</b> which was employed in the present Maglev system was evaluated. Two <b>rail</b> <b>joints,</b> the mitered <b>rail</b> <b>joint</b> and the overlapped <b>rail</b> <b>joint,</b> have been proposed aiming at improving the longitudinal homogeneity of the applied magnetic fields.

Therefore, the research on the fatigue properties of <b>rail</b> <b>joint</b> bolt has important practical significance. This paper analyzed the influence of different pre-tightening torque on the fatigue life of the <b>rail</b> <b>joint</b> bolt. Besides, the best pre-tightening torque of the bolt was acquired through theoretical calculations.

40|$|<b>Rail</b> <b>joints</b> are a weak {{component}} in railway tracks {{because of the}} large impact and wheel-rail contact forces. Every train passage contributes to the deterioration of <b>rail</b> <b>joints,</b> causing visible (e. g. battered rails) and invisible (e. g. loose bolts) damages. The invisible damage cannot be detected by the commonly performed visual inspection, which is labor intensive, unreliable, intrusive and unsafe. In this paper, a vehicle-borne monitoring system is used to automatically detect and assess the tightness condition of bolts at <b>rail</b> <b>joints.</b> The monitoring method is developed based on field Axle Box Acceleration (ABA) measurements using different bolt tightness conditions. The suitability of the method is assessed by bolt tightness prediction and verification of a set of <b>rail</b> <b>joints</b> in the tram network of Sheffield, United Kingdom. The results show that ABA system can be employed to monitor bolt tightness conditions at <b>rail</b> <b>joints.</b> With this information better planning for selective preventive maintenance actions can be taken over <b>rail</b> <b>joints.</b> Railway Engineerin...|$|R

30|$|An ideal {{magnetic}} rail {{should provide}} a homogeneous magnetic field along the longitudinal direction to guarantee the reliable friction-free operation of high temperature superconducting (HTS) maglev vehicles. But in reality, magnetic field inhomogeneity may occur due to lots of reasons; the joint gap is the most direct one. Joint gaps inevitably exist between adjacent segments and influence the longitudinal magnetic field homogeneity above the rail since any magnetic rails are consisting of many permanent magnet segments. To improve the running performance of maglev systems, two new <b>rail</b> <b>joints</b> are proposed based on the normal <b>rail</b> <b>joint,</b> which are named as mitered <b>rail</b> <b>joint</b> and overlapped <b>rail</b> <b>joint.</b> It is found that the overlapped <b>rail</b> <b>joint</b> has a better effect to provide a competitive homogeneous magnetic field. And the further structure optimization {{has been done to}} ensure maglev vehicle operation as stable as possible when passing through those joint gaps. The results show that the overlapped <b>rail</b> <b>joint</b> with optimal parameters can significantly reduce the magnetic field inhomogeneity comparing with the other two <b>rail</b> <b>joints.</b> In addition, an appropriate gap was suggested when balancing the thermal expansion of magnets and homogenous magnetic field, which is considered valuable references for the future design of the magnetic rails.|$|R
30|$|From {{the above}} analysis, it {{points out that}} the {{magnetic}} field above the normal <b>rail</b> <b>joint</b> is not homogeneous, and this magnetic field inhomogeneity will affect running performance of the levitated vehicle. Therefore, the mitered <b>rail</b> <b>joint</b> and the overlapped <b>rail</b> <b>joint</b> are put forward to improve the magnetic field to ensure the vehicle operate stable in a comparatively homogeneous magnetic field, as shown in Fig.  3 b, c, respectively.|$|R

40|$|<b>Rail</b> <b>joints</b> have {{a shorter}} service life {{than most other}} railway track components. The {{discontinuity}} between rail ends turns the <b>rail</b> <b>joint</b> into a weak spot, and consequently, into a track component demanding more frequent maintenance measures, which result in high maintenance costs. Moreover, difficulties are often found when assessing the damage condition of <b>rail</b> <b>joints</b> since damage conditions like cracks in the rail web or loose bolts cannot be detected by visual inspection. A {{better understanding of the}} damage mechanisms and degradation process of <b>rail</b> <b>joints</b> may help to develop adapted maintenance measures and to improve <b>rail</b> <b>joint</b> design. In this paper, a 3 D Finite Element model is presented as base for <b>rail</b> <b>joint</b> study.

The model is validated between 150 and 800 Hz with measured axle box accelerations of resilient wheels. Higher frequencies may be reached with an improved model of the rubber. In the paper, the influence of the bolt tightness is studied. The results showed that contact force, specially its variation, is strongly affected by the bolt tightness; loose bolts cause higher contact forces. The effect of vehicle speed on wheel/rail contact is also significant mainly due to the interaction between rail and sleepers {{in the vicinity of the}} <b>rail</b> <b>joint.</b> Apart from bolt tightness conditions and vehicle speed, the validated model has the potential to study the influence of other track parameters and damage condition...|$|R
