5|$|From {{the late}} 1970s through the mid-1990s the {{laboratory}} was rededicated to medical and urban entomology, with Professor John Edman running projects on mosquitos as vectors and Professor Ron Prokopy focusing on orchard pest control. In 1982, the wintering cellar {{in the basement}} of the lab was converted into laboratories, and the workshop was relocated to the garage adjacent to the <b>building</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> constructed that same year.|$|E
5|$|Starky's, {{located at}} 2913 Southeast Stark Street, was a gay bar and {{restaurant}} in Portland's Kerns neighborhood.

Starky's was known for its patio and outdoor seating, in addition to serving American cuisine, including burgers and steak. Joe Waldroff and Greg Simshaw purchased the bar in September 2004.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} site {{has been the}} subject of several recent redevelopment proposals, including a 2008 plan to demolish the <b>building</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> halted after a U.S. District Court ruling. After ownership of the Federal Reserve Bank Building was transferred to the General Services Administration in 2013, it was auctioned to Martin Selig Real Estate in 2015 for $16 million; the firm later announced plans to build a 48-story mixed-use skyscraper atop the existing building, but scaled back the project to only seven floors.|$|E

5|$|A {{photograph}} of the <b>building</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> to house the theater appeared in The Morning Oregonian newspaper in 1913. Known as the Kleist Building after its owner, Edward Kleist, it had a pressed brick front and walls with hollow tiles. The second floor was intended for residential rooms and apartments, and the ground floor was designed for business storerooms and a movie theater. According to a February 1915 newspaper advertisement, The Exploits of Elaine, {{the first in a}} continuing series of Craig Kennedy detective stories, was to show at The Clinton on March 1.|$|E
5|$|Archaeologists have {{established}} that the monument was built by pastoralist communities shortly after the introduction of agriculture to Britain from continental Europe. Although representing part of an architectural tradition of long barrow <b>building</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> widespread across Neolithic Europe, Addington Long Barrow belongs to a localised regional variant of barrows produced {{in the vicinity of}} the River Medway, now known as the Medway Megaliths. Of these, it lies near to both Chestnuts Long Barrow and Coldrum Long Barrow on the western side of the river. Three further surviving long barrows, Kit's Coty House, the Little Kit's Coty House, and the Coffin Stone, are located on the Medway's eastern side.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of the}} {{development}} over the sub-surface platforms, the station buildings were remodelled internally to share a single entrance and ticket office. Space in the Piccadilly line <b>building</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> formerly used for operational purposes or as the exit to the street is now used for retail purposes. During the 2000s, the deep-level parts of the station underwent refurbishment with areas of damaged wall tiles being replaced. The dark green and cream tiled walls of the Piccadilly line's lower level passages and platforms were restored, with damaged tiles being replaced by reproductions to match the original designs.|$|E
5|$|By the 2010s the {{building}} was owned by Enterprise Inns, who own around 5,500 pubs in the UK. Despite advertising for a new lease of {{the building}} in circa 2013 whilst letting the property for a peppercorn rent, Enterprise Inns ultimately decided to sell the property as a freehold in March 2015. No offers to continue operating the building as a pub were received, although some offers were received from developers seeking to redevelop the property, perhaps due to the substantial refurbishment of the <b>building</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> required.|$|E
5|$|In February 1942, A, B and C Troops were {{dispatched}} to the Outer Hebrides {{under the command of}} Captain Lord Lovat for extra training. Returning to Troon in March, they were immediately sent to Dartmouth, Devon where they embarked on HMS Prins Albert. Once on board they were informed about Operation Bludgeon and started mission training. The objective of this raid was a large <b>building</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> a short distance inland from the Dutch coast, and that was used by senior German officers. For the duration of the operation BTroop were issued with flamethrowers to set the building on fire. After several days training, the commandos moved around the coast and anchored in the Thames waiting for the order to go. The operation was eventually cancelled, due to the increased German E-Boat activity {{in the area of the}} landing.|$|E

5|$|St Andrew's Anglican Church {{has three}} {{distinctive}} internal transept arches, and {{was designed by}} a Presbyterian, Alexander Leckie Elphinstone Junior. The foundation stone was laid in 1883, {{and the top of}} the spire completed in 1906. The fast construction period, unusual for that time, was indicative of the area's affluence. Recent Asian influences in Summer Hill have brought about the introduction of non-Christian places of worship. The Wong Tai Sin (or Kwan Yin Kur) temple is located on the corners of Kensington Road and Liverpool Road in a <b>building</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> a Masonic temple in the 1920s. The same building was converted into the current temple; the lower floor houses the Taoist deity of Wong Tai Sin, and the upper floor houses the Buddhist Bodhisattva of Kwan Yin.|$|E
5|$|The character's backstory is {{explored}} {{throughout the}} sixth season of Desperate Housewives. Angela de Luca lived in New York City with her mother, Rose De Luca (Suzanne Costallos). At age eighteen, she {{dropped out of}} college, where she was enrolled as an engineering major, and joined a band of eco-terrorists, led by Patrick Logan (John Barrowman), with whom she became romantically involved. Patrick asked her to build a bomb {{that would be used}} against a corporate company. On November 10, 1991, the eco-terrorist group bombed a <b>building</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> supposedly empty; however, they unintentionally killed a man named Shawn. Angela sustained a large scar on her back {{as a result of the}} explosion. Consumed with guilt over having killed an innocent man, Angela agreed to run away with a private investigator (Jeffrey Nordling) who had been pursuing the terrorist group. Later, Angie discovered she was pregnant with Patrick's child. She and the private investigator raised Patrick's son as their own and moved several times, living under various aliases, in an attempt to evade both Patrick and the FBI.|$|E
5|$|To works, however, {{of which}} the {{excellence}} is not absolute and definite, but gradual and comparative; to works not raised upon principles demonstrative and scientifick, but appealing wholly to observation and experience, no other test can be applied than length of duration and continuance of esteem. What mankind have long possessed they have often examined and compared, and if they persist to value the possession, it is because frequent comparisons have confirmed opinion in its favour. As among the works of nature no man can properly call a river deep or a mountain high, without the knowledge of many mountains and many rivers; so in the productions of genius, nothing can be stiled excellent till it has been compared with other works of the same kind. Demonstration immediately displays its power, and has nothing to hope or fear from the flux of years; but works tentative and experimental must be estimated by their proportion to the general and collective ability of man, as it is discovered in a long succession of endeavours. Of the first <b>building</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> raised, it might be with certainty determined that it was round or square, but whether it was spacious or lofty must have been referred to time. The Pythagorean scale of numbers was at once discovered to be perfect; but the poems of Homer we yet know not to transcend the common limits of human intelligence, but by remarking, that nation after nation, and century after century, {{has been able to}} do little more than transpose his incidents, new name his characters, and paraphrase his sentiments.|$|E
