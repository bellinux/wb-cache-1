25|$|New {{technology}} in agricultural production also has great potential to combat undernutrition. By improving agricultural yields, farmers could reduce poverty by increasing income {{as well as}} open up area for diversification of crops for household use. The World Bank itself claims to <b>be</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> to malnutrition, asserting {{that the best way}} for countries to succeed in breaking the cycle of poverty and malnutrition is to build export-led economies that will give them the financial means to buy foodstuffs on the world market.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, higher {{incentives}} for farmers to grow non-food biofuel crops {{combined with other}} factors, such as over development of former farm lands, rising transportation costs, climate change, growing consumer demand in China and India, and population growth, caused food shortages in Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Mexico, as well as rising food prices around the globe. As of December 2007, 37 countries faced food crises, and 20 had imposed some sort of food-price controls. Some of these shortages resulted in food riots and even deadly stampedes. The International Fund for Agricultural Development posits that an increase in smallholder agriculture may <b>be</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> to concerns about food prices and overall food security. They in part base this {{on the experience of}} Vietnam, which went from a food importer to large food exporter and saw a significant drop in poverty, due mainly to the development of smallholder agriculture in the country.|$|E
