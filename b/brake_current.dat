40|$|It is {{the purpose}} that a wagon driven by a {{squirrel-cage}} induction motor is controlled {{to stop at the}} given position on a rail. The wagon is driven on the rail and arrives at the brake-start point. From this point, the motor should be braked corresponding to the load of the wagon. Therefore, the distance from brake-start point to the stop position must be constant. The brake of the 3 phase squirrel-cage induction motor is various method; dynamic braking, regenerative braking, plugging and single-phase braking etc. DC exciting method, so called dynamic braking, was used for this experiment. The peculiarity of this experiment is that the load was detected during the <b>braking</b> and <b>braking</b> <b>current</b> was decided. The method of this detection is as follows. At the first step, dynamic braking of which <b>braking</b> <b>current</b> is small was given on the motor from the brake-start point. In response to the ratio of speed down, the pulses were gained by phototransister which respond to light through the hole of disk installed on motor. The distance of pulse was converted into position stepping in the second dynamic braking of which <b>braking</b> <b>current</b> is large. This way was termed the second-step dynamic braking. By such a way, as the value of load increased, the braking quantity increased. Hence the difference of the given position and the stop position was small value in spite of the load variation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{changing}} {{magnetic field}} will induce eddy currents in the conductor. These currents will dissipate {{energy in the}} conductor and generate drag force. It is found that Aluminium is the best material as conductor compared to Copper and Zinc. Also, {{it is found that}} the larger thickness of disc, more number of turns of electromagnet and higher electrical conductivity of conductor influences the generation of greater braking torque. Permanent magnet eddy <b>current</b> <b>brake</b> uses Neodymium – Iron – Boron (NdFeB) magnets. The analysis of permanent magnet eddy current shows that the parallel magnetised eddy current topology has the superior braking torque capability. In electrically controlled eddy <b>current</b> <b>braking</b> system subjected to time varying fields in different wave forms, the triangular wave field application resulted in highest braking torque. Electromagnetic brakes were found to interfere with the signalling and train control system. Permanent magnet eddy <b>current</b> <b>brakes</b> are a simple and reliable alternative to mechanical or electromagnetic brakes in transportation applications.

40|$|In this paper, a novel hybrid {{excitation}} linear eddy <b>current</b> <b>brake</b> {{is presented}} as a braking system for high-speed road and rail vehicles. The presence of the permanent magnets (PMs), whose flux lines in the primary core are oppositely directed with respect to the flux lines by the excitation windings, has the effect of mitigating the saturation of the iron in the teeth of the primary core. This allows the brake to be fed with more intense <b>currents,</b> improving the <b>braking</b> force. First, using the magnetic equivalent circuit method and the layer theory approach, the analytical model of the hybrid excitation linear eddy <b>current</b> <b>brake</b> was developed, which can account for the saturation effects occurring in the iron parts.

5000|$|Disk {{electromagnetic}} brakes {{are used}} on vehicles such as trains, and power {{tools such as}} circular saws, to stop the blade quickly when the power is turned off. A disk eddy <b>current</b> <b>brake</b> consists of a conductive non-ferromagnetic metal disc (rotor) attached to the axle of the vehicle's wheel, with an electromagnet located with its poles {{on each side of}} the disk, so the magnetic field passes through the disk. The electromagnet allows the braking force to be varied. When no current is passed through the electromagnet's winding, there is no braking force. When the driver steps on the <b>brake</b> pedal, <b>current</b> is passed through the electromagnet windings, creating a magnetic field, The larger the current in the winding, the larger the eddy currents and the stronger the braking force. Power tool brakes use permanent magnets, which are moved adjacent to the disk by a linkage when the power is turned off. The kinetic energy of the vehicle's motion is dissipated in Joule heating by the eddy currents passing through the disk's resistance, so like conventional friction disk brakes, the disk becomes hot. Unlike in the linear brake below, the metal of the disk passes repeatedly through the magnetic field, so disk eddy <b>current</b> <b>brakes</b> get hotter than linear eddy <b>current</b> <b>brakes.</b>|$|R
