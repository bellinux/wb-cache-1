40|$|A {{saddle clamp}} {{assembly}} is presented. The assembly {{is comprised of}} a hollow cylindrical body centered about a longitudinal axis and being diametrically split into semicircular top and bottom sections. Each section has a pair of connection flanges, at opposite ends, that project radially outward. A pair of bolts are retained on the top section flanges and are threadable into nuts retained on the bottom section flanges. A base member is anchored to a central underside portion of the <b>bottom</b> <b>clamp</b> body section and has a pair of connection tabs positioned beneath the <b>bottom</b> <b>clamp</b> body section connection flanges {{on opposite sides of}} the clamp axis. A pair of bolts are retained on the base member connection tabs and are threadable into a pair of nuts retainable on a support structure. The connection tab and connection flanges on each side of the clamp body are axially offset in a manner permitting downward installation/removable tool access to the lower bolts past the connection flanges. An elongated retention tether is used to connect the top clamp body section to the balance of the clamp assembly. This prevents loss of the top clamp body section when it is removed from the <b>bottom</b> <b>clamp</b> body section...|$|R

50|$|While both {{may have}} an exposed spring near the triple clamp, a girder fork is {{distinguishable}} from a springer fork by the wheel being fixed firmly to the (usually a long diamond shape) upright. The pivot points are short links mounted {{to the top and}} <b>bottom</b> triple <b>clamps.</b> The spring is usually mounted to the girder and compressed against the upper triple clamp.|$|R
50|$|While it {{may have}} an exposed spring near the triple clamp, a {{springer}} fork is distinguishable from a girder fork by its two parallel sets of legs. The rear is firmly fixed to the <b>bottom</b> triple <b>clamp</b> (usually brazed or welded). A short leading link holds the wheel and the forward leg which actuates the springs (usually mounted on the triple clamp).|$|R

40|$|In this work, {{the thermal}} {{environment}} inside the furnace of a dynamic mechanical analyser was investigated {{by putting a}} standard sample in distinct positions inside the furnace. Penetration experiments were carried out in order to compare the measured melting temperature of the sample with the theoretical melting temperature. The thermal gradients were investigated for three distinct modes: compression, three-point bending and extension. In the compression mode a small variation of the measured melting point was found {{as a function of}} the radial distance. However, for both extension and three-point bending modes quite important variations were measured along the relevant directions. In the former case the <b>bottom</b> <b>clamp</b> was found to be warmer than the upper one and in the latter mode higher temperatures are found in the extremities of the samples (closer to the furnace wall). Other factors, such as the influence of the heating rate and the purge gas flow rate, were also investigated. In the particular case of the extension mode, it was found that the measured melting temperature decreased with increasing scanning rate. A simple model was used in order to investigate the influence of the temperature gradients on DMA measurements. For temperature gradients along the sample length below 10 °C the differences in the viscoelastic parameters (tan d, D∗ and E∗) from the homogeneous case are small when compared with typical experimental errors...|$|R
50|$|Mohr was {{the leading}} {{scientific}} chemist {{of his time in}} Germany, and the inventor of many improvements in analytical methodology. He invented an improved burette which had a tip at the <b>bottom</b> and a <b>clamp</b> (a 'Mohr's clip'), which made it much easier to use than its predecessors, which were more similar to a graduated cylinder. His methods of volumetric analysis were expounded in his Lehrbuch der chemisch-analytischen Titrir-methode (1855) (Instructional Book of Titration Methods in Analytical Chemistry), which won special commendation from Liebig and ran to many editions. His Geschichie der Erde, eine Geologic auf neuer Grundlage (1866), was also widely circulated.|$|R
40|$|The figure {{depicts a}} {{miniature}} cantilever-type anemometer {{that has been}} developed as a prototype of compact, relatively nonintrusive anemometers that can function at temperatures up to 600 C {{and that can be}} expected to be commercially mass-producible at low cost. The design of this anemometer, and especially the packaging aspect of the design, is intended to enable measurement of turbulence in the high-temperature, high-vibration environment of a turbine engine or in any similar environment. The main structural components of the anemometer include a single-crystal SiC cantilever and two polycrystalline SiC clamping plates, all made from chemical-vapor-deposited silicon carbide. Fabrication of these components from the same basic material eliminates thermal-expansion mismatch, which has introduced spurious thermomechanical stresses in cantilever-type anemometers of prior design. The clamping plates are heavily oxidized to improve electrical insulation at high temperature. A cavity that serves as a receptacle for the clamped end of the cantilever is etched into one end of one clamping plate. Trenches that collectively constitute a socket for a multipin electrical plug (for connection to external electronic circuitry) are etched into the opposite end of this clamping plate. Metal strips for electrical contact are deposited on one face of the other clamping plate. Piezoresistive single-crystal SiC thin-film strain gauges are etched in the n-type SiC epilayer in a Wheatstone-bridge configuration. Metal contact pads on the cantilever that extend into the clamping-receptacle area, are obtained by deposition and patterning using standard semiconductor photolithography and etching methods. The cantilever and the two clamping plates are assembled into a sandwich structure that is then clamped in a stainless-steel housing. The Wheatstone- bridge carrying SiC cantilever with the metal contact pads on the piezoresistors is slid into the receptacle in the <b>bottom</b> <b>clamping</b> plate. The top clamping plate is brought into contact with the bottom plate so that the narrow section of the metal strips on the top clamp plate aligns with the metal contact pads on the cantilever. When the parts are clamped together, the metal strips provide electrical connections between the Wheatstone-bridge contact points and the sides the trenches that constitute the socket for the multipin electrical plug. Hence, to connect the Wheatstone bridge to external circuitry for processing of the anemometer readout, one need only insert the plug in the socket. In operation, the cantilever end of the stainless-steel housing is mounted flush with an engine wall and the unclamped portion of the cantilever is exposed into the flow. The cantilever is deflected in direct proportion to the force induced by component of flow parallel to the engine wall and perpendicular to the broad exposed face of the cantilever. The maximum strain on the cantilever occurs at the clamped edge and is measured by the piezoresistors, which are located there. The corresponding changes in resistance manifest themselves in the output of the Wheatstone bridge...|$|R
50|$|An {{eccentric}} is a {{cylindrical plug}} or bearing cup that fits into an enlarged bottom bracket shell. The plug is machined {{to accept a}} typical bottom bracket, but offset {{from the center of}} the plug, so that by rotating the plug, the location of the bottom bracket (and hence the chain tension) may be adjusted (fore and aft to tension the chain, the upper or lower eccentric position for a given chain length can be chosen to fine tune bottom bracket height). Once properly adjusted the plug is then fixed in place by a pair of set screws, a <b>clamping</b> <b>bottom</b> bracket shell, an expanding wedge in the plug, or the plug may be manufactured in left and right halves that clamp against the faces of the bottom bracket shell with screws that connect the two halves.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: In this study, a higher-order impact {{sandwich}} beam model {{is presented to}} simulate the response of a soft-core {{sandwich beam}} subjected to a foreign object impact. The effects of asymmetric lay-up of the sandwich and arbitrary boundary conditions are accounted for in the analysis, and the solution is obtained by employing a finite difference method (FDM). A static and free vibration problem of sandwich beams is first solved, {{and the results are}} validated by comparing with the numerical finite element predictions of ABAQUS. The validity of the impact response is then examined using the LS-DYNAmodel. The contact force and deflection history as well as the propagation of axial, shear, and transverse normal stresses in the sandwich beams during the impact are analyzed. The local effect at the boundary and the loading location is captured by the present model, and the influences of boundary conditions (i. e., the top face sheet free and the bottom pin–pin supported versus both the top and <b>bottom</b> face sheets <b>clamped)</b> and the load spreading process on the impact behavior are discussed. The calculated stresses under the foreign object impact are further incorporated with the failure criteria to assess the failure location, time, an...|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} the free {{vibrations}} {{of the bottom}} plate of an otherwise rigid circular cylindrical tank filled with liquid are studied, considering only the bulging modes (when the amplitude of the plate displacement is predominant with respect {{to that of the}} free surface). The tank axis is vertical, thus the free liquid surface is orthogonal to the tank axis. The liquid is assumed to be inviscid, and the contribution of the free surface waves to the dynamic pressure on the free liquid surface is neglected. Wet and dry mode shapes of the plate are assumed to be the same, so that the natural frequencies are obtained by using the nondimensionalized added virtual mass incremental (NA VMI) factors and the modal properties of dry plates. This simplifies computations compared to other existing theoretical approaches. NAVMI factors express the nondimensionalized ratio between the reference kinetic energy of the liquid and that of the plate and have the advantage that, due to their nondimensional form, they can be computed once and for all. Numerical results for simply supported and <b>clamped</b> <b>bottom</b> plates, as well as for supported plates with an elastic moment edge constraint are given. For more accurate results, and to exceed the limits of the assumed modes approach, the Rayleigh-Ritz method is applied and results are compared to those obtained by using the NAVMI factors and other existing methods in the literature...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} a modal {{analysis}} of the elastic cylindrical shell with a <b>clamped</b> <b>bottom</b> partially filled with fluid in open source Code_Aster software using the finite element method. Natural frequencies and modes obtained in Code_Aster are compared to experimental and theoretical data. The aim {{of this paper is}} to prove that Code_Aster has all necessary tools for solving fluid structure interaction problems. Also, Code_Aster can be used in the industrial projects as an alternative to commercial software. The available free pre- and post-processors with a graphical user interface that is compatible with Code_Aster allow creating complex models and processing the results. The paper presents new validation results of open source Code_Aster software used to calculate small natural modes of the cylindrical shell partially filled with non-viscous compressible barotropic fluid under gravity field. The displacement of the middle surface of thin shell and the displacement of the fluid relative to the equilibrium position are described by coupled hydro-elasticity problem. The fluid flow is considered to be potential. The finite element method (FEM) is used. The features of computational model are described. The resolution equation has symmetrical block matrices. To compare the results, is discussed the well-known modal analysis problem of cylindrical shell with flat non-deformable bottom, filled with a compressible fluid. The numerical parameters of the scheme were chosen in accordance with well-known experimental and analytical data. Three cases were taken into account: an empty, a partially filled and a full-filled cylindrical shell. The frequencies of Code_Aster are in good agreement with those, obtained in experiment, analytical solution, as well as with results obtained by FEM in other software. The difference between experiment and analytical solution in software is approximately the same. The obtained results extend a set of validation tests for Code_Aster in the field of aerospace systems. Using the free software to analyze the aerospace system components allows enterprises to diminish dependency on the commercial software, reduce the cost of software usage, and adapt the open source software to the specific problems. </p...|$|R
