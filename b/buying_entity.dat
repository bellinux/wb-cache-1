One of {{the goals}} of Purchasing Agents is to acquire goods per the most {{advantageous}} terms of the <b>buying</b> <b>entity</b> (or simply, the [...] "Buyer").

40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Department of Defense (DOD) is the government's largest <b>buying</b> <b>entity</b> and has recognized that rebuilding the acquisition workforce is a strategic priority. The federal government's current budget and long-term fiscal pressures underscore {{the importance of a}} capable and well-functioning workforce. GAO and others have long recognized that the size and capabilities of the workforce across the government warrant the attention of the Congress. This statement discusses (1) DOD's progress in addressing challenges faced in rebuilding the capacity of the acquisition workforce, and (2) insights into the efforts by the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) to rebuild its contract oversight capacity. This statement is drawn from our broad body of work on DOD contract management and acquisition workforce as well as a report issued earlier this month on DCMA's efforts to rebuild capacity. We also obtained updated information from DOD with regard to its acquisition workforce competency assessments and workforce hiring [...] ...|$|E

In the larger, {{compliance}} market, companies, governments, or other <b>entities</b> <b>buy</b> carbon offsets {{in order to}} comply with caps on {{the total amount of}} carbon dioxide they are allowed to emit. This market exists in order to achieve compliance with obligations of Annex 1 Parties under the Kyoto Protocol, and of liable entities under the EU Emission Trading Scheme.

Indirect participation occurs when an institutional investor exchanges a stock on behalf of an individual or household. Indirect investment occurs in the form of pooled investment accounts, retirement accounts, and other managed financial accounts.|$|R

40|$|Information marketplaces enable <b>entities</b> to <b>buy</b> {{and sell}} information; these <b>buying</b> and selling <b>entities</b> can be humans, or {{automated}} agents that represent them. In this paper, we {{introduce a new}} type of participant into electronic information marketplaces, namely the InfoCenter agent, which can not only buy and sell information, but can also procure and sell manipulated (i. e., processed) information. We explore the effects that InfoCenters have on the marketplace and on the other agents that participate in it. We show that the benefits of extending an information e-marketplace with InfoCenter agents are twofold. First, InfoCenters can help buyers obtain better information; second, InfoCenter agents can help sellers gain higher profits. Furthermore, we empirically test the influence of different pricing algorithms and payment methods on the buyers', sellers', and InfoCenters' behaviors...|$|R
40|$|Exercises, " {{requires}} that payroll taxes incurred {{in connection with}} stock-based compensation be recognized as an expense, {{but it does not}} address the timing of that expense recognition. Costs incurred by companies for employer payroll taxes on employee stock-based compensation have become more significant for U. S. companies {{as a result of the}} increased use of options as a form of employee compensation and the rapid growth in the market value of underlying stocks in certain market sectors. Consequently, the predominant current practice of recognizing those costs when the event that triggers payment to the taxing authority occurs (for an option, that event is employee exercise), has been called into question. 2. This Issue addresses how an entity should account for employer payroll taxes on stock-based compensation under Opinion 25 and Statement 123.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Centralization {{of public}} {{procurement}} is capturing {{the interest of}} governments and organizations. Indeed, new central procurement agencies {{are going to be}} set up at central and local level, with the objective of obtaining value for money and resources for social spending. In pursuing such a goal, the first important strategic decision for the government, is to choose between public entities forced to join the system or not. In this paper two different scenarios for a Central Procurement Agency awarding framework contracts are compared. In the first case, public <b>entities</b> <b>buy</b> products and services provided by the Agency on a voluntary basis, while in the second model they are obliged to join the system. As a results, a different level of certainty about the demand to be satisfied is guaranteed to suppliers competing for the contract. What emerges is that, in the short run, when a central procurement agency is established where there was not, the government shall impose to Public <b>entities</b> to <b>buy</b> the products auctioned by the Agency. In contrast, in the medium-long run, it is strategic to let entities free to join the procurement agency’s initiatives...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{development}} of technology and threats, personal information leakage is getting inevitable. In Japan, societal criticism and possible a large amount of economic loss occur to the entity having leaked personal information, but not so much against data broker purchasing the leaked information or <b>entity</b> <b>buying</b> it from them. To strengthen the restriction against the latter, the 2015 amendment of Act on the Protection of Personal Information (APIP) introduced the traceability and the on-site inspection authority by the Personal Information Protection Committee(PPC), but the authority can not conduct without clue that the personal information is in circulation. In the United States, there are monitoring services for important personal information which may lead economic damage or identity theft to the information subject, but in countries like Japan, where even basic information is accountable, monitoring for wider range of personal information is desired. Meanwhile, in the Do Not Call system introduced in 18 countries around the world, consumers can simply delete their information from the call list of the telemarketer only by registering their phone number with the National Registration. This is useful as a system to control consumers' personal information without imposing a burden of actively pursue specific entities using it by consumers. Here, I would like to propose a "Do not hold" system to delete personal information illegally acquired by enabling the authority to investigate it by which it gets possible to identify the entity having the information of the data subject...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} {{functioning}} of the tendering market in public procurement. The effects of the characteristics of buyers, sellers and bids in the tendering market are analyzed. A dataset of construction tenders in the county of Kalmar, Sweden is analyzed by using regression analysis. Several findings are made about how characteristics of size, level of organizational knowledge and location of buyers and sellers affect {{the functioning of}} the tendering market in public procurement. The market for public tenders {{is a part of the}} public procurement market which is described in the thesis from a European and Swedish perspective. The roles of public procurement authorities and of the supplying firms in this market are described and the interactions of these players are analyzed. Tendering involves an auction procedure and the thesis treats some aspects of auction theory. The subject of the thesis, to study {{the functioning of the}} public procurement market based on the characteristics of the players within it is a new approach but the characteristics that are studied in the thesis and their effects on the behavior of the participant in the public procurement market have all to some extent been described in the literature. A short presentation of the main findings of the analysis: -The location of a firm, here meaning the site of its headquarter, has an influence on the frequency with which the firm is bidding. The effect is a small positive correlation between the firm being local (in the place where the contract of the tender is to be carried out) and its participation in tender. -The organizational knowledge of a firm is positively correlated with the frequency with which it submits bids in public tenders. -The more organizational knowledge there is in the <b>buying</b> public <b>entity,</b> the smaller will the price variation be in the bids submitted in a tender. -There is a negative relationship between the size of the tender and the variation in price among the bids received. -Being a local firm slightly increases the chance of winning a tender. The study gives an indication that the studying of the described characteristics do have effects on the behavior of the participants in the market and it opens for further research in the area.
