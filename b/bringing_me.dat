500|$|After leaving The Hills, Conrad {{appeared}} on The View in June 2009, {{where she was}} asked how she felt about her apology from Pratt involving the sex tape rumors. She replied, [...] "To be perfectly honest, I wasn't on the other line of that call [...] I didn't even know about it until , so no, I didn't get an apology, he's lying". At Montag and Pratt's wedding, it was depicted on the series as if Conrad and Cavallari were displeased with each other's presence, though the latter commented that they gave each other [...] "a big hug, and that's it". She also stated that when she joined The Hills, [...] "It's work! And drama sells. I think that's why they're <b>bringing</b> <b>me</b> in, because I know what works".|$|E

It is being released in the UK via Spinefarm Records. The album was produced by Chris [...] "Zeuss" [...] Harris. Drummer Jason Bittner recently stated about the band's new material, [...] "The songs {{are a little more}} on the darker, angry side... lots of heaviness, lots of crazy guitar, and LOTS of room for me to have some fun. There {{is no doubt in my}} mind that this will be the best performance of my career, so far, and I owe that to my guys for <b>bringing</b> <b>me</b> incredible riffs to write killer drum parts to." [...] As of the fall of 2009 the band was appearing on the 'Shock & Raw' tour of North America with 2Cents, Otep & Five Finger Death Punch. After a South American tour, Shadows Fall will be playing on the Jägermeister Stage in the 2010 Rockstar Mayhem Festival in July and August 2010.

I'm an Adventist for one reason: the beliefs, the teachings, the doctrines that this church—and this church alone—espouses.

2500|$|The studio {{publicity}} {{department was}} concerned audiences would confuse Granger with British actor Stewart Granger, so they suggested he change {{his name and}} offered him a list from which to choose. [...] "The names were all interchangeable, like Gordon Gregory and Gregory Gordon. I didn't want to change my name," [...] Granger later recalled. [...] "I liked Farley Granger. It was my father's name, and his grandfather's name. They kept <b>bringing</b> <b>me</b> new combinations, and finally I offered to change it to Kent Clark. I {{was the only one}} who thought it was funny." [...] Eventually the studio issued a press release announcing Farley Granger, a senior at North Hollywood High School, had been cast in The North Star after he responded to an ad in the local paper. [...] "I thought that was a really dumb story," [...] said Granger. [...] "The truth was much more interesting." ...|$|E
