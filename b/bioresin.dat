40|$|In this research, polyalkyd resins were {{prepared}} from palm oil by using polycondensation reaction. A two-step method viz., alcoholysis and esterification {{was conducted to}} synthesize polyalkyd resins. Prior to alcoholysis, crude palm oil was subjected for dehydration process to increase its unsaturation. Different types of catalysts such as, sulphuric acid, para-toluene sulfonic acid, phosphoric acid, sodium hydrogen sulphate and potassium hydrogen sulphate {{were used for the}} dehydration. In alcoholysis process, the triglyceride-based dehydrated oil was reacted with glycerol to produce monoglyceride. The prepared monoglyceride was further brought into contact with acid anhydride to prepare polyalkyds. Response surface methodology was used to optimize the reaction parameters for esterification like reaction temperature, reaction time, catalyst concentration, acid anhydride to mono-glyceride ratio and agitation speed. The optimum condition was used to prepare various types of polyalkyds by using different types of acid anhydrides such as, maleic anhydride, succinic anhydride, phthalic anhydride, 3, 4, 5, 6 -tetrahydrophthalic anhydride and cis- 1, 2 -cyclohexanedicarboxylic anhydride. A comparison was drawn among the resins prepared by using different types and percentages of acid anhydrides. The produced <b>bioresins</b> were characterized for physico-chemical properties such as, viscosity, density, iodine value, acid value, drying time, non-volatile materials content, specific gravity, colour, etc. The resins prepared with optimum reaction parameters were subjected for curing process by using methyl ethyl ketone peroxide and cobalt naphthanate. To enhance the resinous property, multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were dispersed into the resin at different percentages of loading such as, 0. 5, 1. 0 and 1. 5 wt. %. The loading was optimized based on the tensile strength of the film. Finally, in-situ polymerization with carbon nanotubes during esterification was performed by adding optimum percentage of loading. The films produced from different formulations were characterized by different testing such as, adhesion, chemical resistivity, thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, field-emission scanning electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction analysis, contact-angle measurement, tensile testing, pencil hardness, gloss, etc. In addition, the curing kinetics of the resin was analysed to evaluate the kinetic parameters such as, reaction rate, activation energy and degree of conversion in terms of time and temperature. Result analyses through RSM revealed a desirability of 0. 985 for the reaction time of 88. 64 min. Moreover, 91. 5 % fractional conversion was achieved actually, which is close to the predicted value. Analysis revealed that 3, 4, 5, 6 -tetrahydophthalic anhydride-based resin showed improved resinous property than others due to high degree of crosslinking. It was also found that higher amount of aliphatic acid anhydrides are responsible for high degree of crosslinking density, whereas higher thermal stability was ensured by the inclusion of aromatic acid anhydride. Finally, incorporation of MWCNTs into the alkyd resin enhanced the overall film properties, which was further improved through in-situ reaction.

The effect of surface treatments, silane and alkali, on regenerated cellulose fibers was studied by using the treated fibers as reinforcement in lactic acid thermoset <b>bioresin.</b> Mechanical tests were used as indicator of the improvement of the interfacial strength. Fiber surface treatments and the effect on adhesion to the matrix were characterized using microscopy images and thermal conductivity. Mechanical properties of the composites showed an increase when treated with silane as the bi-functional silane molecule acts as link between the regenerated cellulose fiber and the <b>bioresin.</b> Porosity volume decreased significantly on silane treatment due to improved interface and interlocking between fiber and matrix. Decrease in water absorption and increase in contact angle confirmed the change in the hydrophilicity of the composites.

40|$|Within {{the civil}} {{engineering}} and construction industries fibre composites {{are now being}} adopted in certain applications in place of more traditional building materials such as timber and steel. Although, fibre composites possess certain advantages over traditional building materials they are predominately produced from non-renewable resources. Of particular concern is the petro-chemical based polymer resins commonly used such as epoxy, vinylester and polyester. It is due to this dependence on finite petro-chemicals and the negative environmental impact associated with their production and uses that alternative, competitive options are sought. Plant oil based bioresins are one such option. Although in its infancy, research suggests that biocomposites produced with plant oil based bioresins and plant based fibres offer {{the potential to be}} used as a sustainable replacement option to traditional fibre composites. The research work presented within this dissertation is to the best of the author’s knowledge a world-first overall investigation pertaining to the concept of synthesising hemp oil based bioresins and applying them to biocomposites. In this work hemp oil based bioresins, specifically epoxidized hemp oil (EHO) and acrylated epoxidized hemp oil (AEHO) were synthesised and characterised and proposed as a potential replacement to their equivalent synthetic polymer resins (epoxy and acrylated resins) and also as an alternative to other commercially available bioresins. The synthesised bioresins were also applied as matrices in the production of suitable biocomposites. Hemp oil was epoxidized in a solvent free process using peracetic acid and an acid ion exchange resin (AIER) catalyst via in situ epoxidation. From 1 H-NMR spectroscopy analysis, oxirane oxygen content was calculated as approximately 8. 6 % and a relative conversion to oxirane of 92 % with approximately 5. 1 epoxy groups per triglyceride. AEHO was synthesised from EHO via in situ acrylation. According to the 1 H-NMR analysis of AEHO, acrylate peaks were apparent and were of the magnitude of approximately 4. 1 acrylates per triglyceride. Some epoxide homopolymerisation was observed limiting conversion to AEHO to approximately 81 %. Curing analysis and cure kinetic modelling were also performed for both EHO and AEHO. The kinetics of curing of both <b>bioresin</b> systems were able to be accurately modelled using a modified expression of Kamal’s autocatalytic model. The synthesised bioresins were applied to biocomposites and characterised in terms of mechanical, dynamic mechanical and moisture absorption properties. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was also performed to investigate the fibre-matrix interfacial adhesion. EHO based bioresins and jute fibre reinforced biocomposites were manufactured and compared with commercially produced epoxidized soybean oil (ESO) and synthetic epoxy based samples. It was found that EHO based bioresins when applied to jute fibre reinforced biocomposites can compete with commercially produced ESO in terms of mechanical performance, dynamic mechanical properties and water absorption characteristics. Although it was shown that EHO can be used in higher concentrations than ESO when blended with synthetic epoxy thereby resulting in more sustainable biocomposites. AEHO based bioresins and jute fibre reinforced biocomposites were manufactured and compared with commercially produced vinylester (VE) based samples. AEHO based samples exhibited higher fibre-matrix interfacial adhesion compared with the VE based samples. Finally the mechanical performance, dynamic mechanical properties and moisture absorption properties of 100 % hemp based biocomposite panels were investigated and compared to those of a VE hybrid composite. Results showed that, except for the flexural modulus that was 23 % higher in the case of the hybrid composite, no significant differences exist in the mechanical performance of both tested materials. The higher fibre-matrix compatibility of the biocomposites led to stronger fibre-matrix interfaces compensating the lower mechanical performance of the neat <b>bioresin</b> with respect to the synthetic VE resin. All of the biocomposite sample types displayed lower dynamic mechanical properties compared with their synthetic counterparts. As, expected moisture absorption was also found to be higher in the biobased specimens although fibre transport was the dominate mechanism rather than resin type. Overall from this research work it can be concluded that hemp oil based bioresins can effectively compete with commercially available bioresins and their equivalent synthetics in biocomposite applications. An enhanced understanding of the synthesis, characterisation and performance of hemp oil based <b>bioresin</b> and biocomposites for use in engineering applications is a key outcome of this investigation. ...|$|E
