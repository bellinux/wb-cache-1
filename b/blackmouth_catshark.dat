5|$|Constantine Samuel Rafinesque briefly {{described}} the <b>blackmouth</b> <b>catshark</b> in his 1810 Caratteri di alcuni nuovi generi e nuove specie di animali e piante della Sicilia: con varie osservazioni sopra i medesimi, wherein he referenced the distinctive black interior of its mouth (from which the specific epithet melastomus is derived). No type specimen was designated. This species {{may also be}} called the black-mouthed dogfish. A 2005 phylogenetic analysis that included five Galeus species, based on mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, found that G.melastomus forms a clade with G.murinus, apart from the clade of G.eastmani, G.gracilis, and G.sauteri. The oldest documented <b>blackmouth</b> <b>catshark</b> fossils come from the northern Apennines and date to the Lower Pliocene (5.3–3.6 Ma).|$|E
5|$|Slow-swimming but active, the <b>blackmouth</b> <b>catshark</b> is a generalist that preys on a {{wide variety}} of crustaceans, cephalopods, and fishes. Its visual and electroreceptive systems are adept at {{tracking}} moving, bioluminescent prey. This species is oviparous, with females producing batches of up to 13 egg cases throughout the year. Because of its abundance, the <b>blackmouth</b> <b>catshark</b> forms a substantial part of the bycatch of deepwater commercial fisheries across much of its range. It has low economic value and is usually discarded, though the largest sharks may be marketed for meat and leather. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species under Least Concern, as there is no indication that its numbers have declined despite fishing pressure.|$|E
5|$|When foraging, the <b>blackmouth</b> <b>catshark</b> swings {{its head}} from side to side to employ its senses more effectively. It likely relies mainly on vision and electroreception to find food, and less on smell. As in most sharks, its visual acuity is {{greatest}} along the median horizontal plane. The lens and cone cells of its eyes are large, allowing smaller or farther objects to be discerned from the background. The rod cells of its eyes are most sensitive to the wavelengths emitted by bioluminescence, which is exhibited by most of the organisms it hunts. For electroreception, the <b>blackmouth</b> <b>catshark</b> has a high number of ampullae of Lorenzini that are evenly arranged, which enhances spatial resolution and is best suited for localizing fast-moving prey.|$|E
5|$|Within its range, the <b>blackmouth</b> <b>catshark</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{abundant}} sharks over the upper and middle continental slope. It is nomadic in nature and may be found alone or in groups. Relatively slow, this shark swims with strong eel-like (anguilliform) undulations of its body. It often cruises just above the sea floor, perhaps taking advantage of the ground effect (a reduction in the drag on a wing when close to the ground) to save energy. It has also been seen resting motionless on the bottom. Known predators of the <b>blackmouth</b> <b>catshark</b> include the kitefin shark (Dalatias licha) and the European flying squid (Todarodes sagittatus). Parasites that have been documented from this species include the tapeworm Ditrachybothridium macrocephalum and the protist Eimeria palavensis.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} <b>blackmouth</b> <b>catshark</b> (Galeus melastomus) and the Portuguese dogfish (Centroscymnus coelolepis), the velvet belly {{is one of}} the most {{abundant}} deep-sea sharks in the northeastern Atlantic. It is found individually or in small shoals. Samplings in the Mediterranean have found females outnumbering males across all ages; this imbalance increases in the older age classes. In the Rockall Trough and the Catalan Sea, large adults are found in deeper waters than juveniles, which may serve to reduce competition between the two groups. However, this pattern has not been observed at other sites in the eastern Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|Found on or {{near the}} bottom, the <b>blackmouth</b> <b>catshark</b> favors a muddy habitat. There is little {{evidence}} for segregation by sex. A number of studies in the northern and western Mediterranean have reported that adults occur deeper than juveniles. Other studies though have found no such pattern. It is possible that areas such as the waters off southern France offer a habitat suitable for sharks of all ages. Another explanation with some scientific support is that adults are most common at intermediate depths, while young sharks are restricted to shallower water and both adults and juveniles are found in deeper water. If true, the age-depth inconsistencies observed from previous research could have resulted from incomplete depth sampling.|$|E
5|$|The <b>blackmouth</b> <b>catshark</b> (Galeus melastomus) is {{a species}} of catshark, {{and part of the}} family Scyliorhinidae, common in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean from Iceland to Senegal, {{including}} the Mediterranean Sea. It is typically found over the continental slope at depths of , on or near muddy bottoms. The youngest sharks generally inhabit shallower water than the older juveniles and adults. This slim-bodied species is characterized by the black interior of its mouth, a marbled pattern of pale-edged brownish saddles or blotches along its back and tail, and a prominent saw-toothed crest of enlarged dermal denticles along the upper edge of its caudal fin. It reaches lengths of , with sharks in the Atlantic growing larger than those in the Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|The <b>blackmouth</b> <b>catshark</b> is an active, generalist {{predator}} {{that feeds}} on both bottom-dwelling and free-swimming organisms. Its diet {{is dominated by}} decapods, krill, bony fishes (including lanternfishes, bristlemouths, dragonfishes, and moras), and cephalopods. The most significant prey species generally reflect what is most available in the environment, for example the shrimps Calocaris macandreae and Pasiphaea multidentata off southern France and the prawns Sergestes arcticus and Sergia robusta off the Iberian Peninsula. Juveniles consume a greater amount and variety of crustaceans than adults, including smaller types such as mysids and hyperiid amphipods. Adults favor relatively large fish prey and {{have been known to}} take other sharks and rays and smaller members of the same species. The importance of cephalopod prey across ages differs between regions. The stomachs of some blackmouth catsharks have found to contain pieces of animals too large for a single shark to overwhelm, suggesting that it may sometimes attack in groups. Scavenging has been infrequently documented, including of human refuse.|$|E
25|$|In 1953, Belgian {{ichthyologist}} Max Poll {{published a}} report on sharks and chimaeras captured during a 194849 Belgian oceanographic expedition off western Africa, including several seemingly ovoviviparous blackmouth catsharks (G. melastomus). As the <b>blackmouth</b> <b>catshark</b> {{is known to be}} oviparous, Poll's account alerted French zoologist Jean Cadenat to the presence of a distinct catshark species in the region. After examining more specimens from Senegal, Cadenat described the new species in a 1959 issue of the scientific journal Bulletin de l'Institut Francais d'Afrique Noire (Sér A) Sciences Naturelles, naming it in Poll's honor.|$|E
25|$|Large {{numbers of}} smooth lanternsharks, {{predominantly}} juvenile, are caught incidentally by commercial longline fisheries, {{and to a}} lesser extent in bottom trawls and fixed bottom nets, in the eastern Atlantic and off Japan. This species is one of the three most common sharks caught as bycatch in deepwater fisheries off southern Portugal, along with the velvet belly lanternshark (E. spinax) and the <b>blackmouth</b> <b>catshark</b> (Galeus melastomus). Most captured smooth lanternsharks are discarded, although some may be sold dried and salted for human consumption or processed into fishmeal. The smooth lanternshark's slow rates of reproduction and growth may render it vulnerable to population collapse under sustained fishing pressure. However, catch rates currently show no evidence of this occurring, which, coupled with the smooth lanternshark's wide geographic range, has led to the IUCN assessing it as of Least Concern.|$|E
500|$|Harmless {{to humans}} and of little {{economic}} value, the <b>blackmouth</b> <b>catshark</b> is caught incidentally {{in large numbers}} by commercial bottom trawl and longline fisheries. In particular, it {{is among the most}} commonly bycaught sharks in trawls targeting deepwater lobsters and shrimps (Nephrops norvegicus, , Aristeus antennatus, and Aristaeomorpha folicea), operating off Portugal and in the Mediterranean. Most captured sharks are discarded, probably with heavy mortality. Some fisheries, such as those off Portugal and Italy, retain and utilize a small subset of the largest individuals for human consumption fresh or dried and salted, and for leather; the fishing fleet of Viareggio, Tuscany reported landing [...] in 2005. In the northeastern Atlantic, this shark is being increasingly targeted by fishers following the decline of other deepwater shark species.|$|E
500|$|Off Corsica, Sicily, and {{southern}} Portugal, {{and in the}} Ionian, southern Adriatic, and Aegean Seas, most of the blackmouth catsharks captured are immature, suggesting {{there has been a}} negative impact of fishing pressure. However, the species remains extremely abundant in a number of areas, and survey and fishery data have not shown any evidence of overall population decline. The wide range of depths it occupies likely afford it some protection against fishing, particularly given a 2005 ban on trawling deeper than [...] in the Mediterranean. Therefore, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed the <b>blackmouth</b> <b>catshark</b> under Least Concern. In the waters of the European Commission, fishing for this species is managed as part of the Total Allowable Catch (TAC) for deepwater sharks.|$|E

The smaller size of Mediterranean sharks relative to those from the rest of the world may be due to limited food availability and/or the warmer, saltier environment. Some 87% of the diet of Portuguese dogfish in the Mediterranean consists of cephalopods. Bony fishes are a secondary food source, while immature sharks favor the shrimp Acanthephyra eximia, the most common decapod crustacean in their environment. Unlike in other regions, Mediterranean sharks seldom scavenge.|$|E
500|$|The <b>blackmouth</b> <b>catshark</b> {{is widely}} {{distributed}} in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean, from southwestern Iceland and Trondheim, Norway southward to Senegal, including the Faroe Islands, the British Isles, the Azores, and the northern portion of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.

This species primarily inhabits the continental slope, at depths of [...] However, {{it has been documented}} from water as shallow as [...] in Norway, and as deep as [...] in the eastern Mediterranean. The depths at which it is most common vary between regions, for example [...] in the Bay of Biscay, [...] off Portugal, [...] in the Strait of Sicily, [...] in the Catalan Sea, and [...] in the eastern Mediterranean. Water temperature {{does not appear to be}} an important factor in determining the distribution of this species.|$|E
500|$|Unlike {{most members}} of its genus, the <b>blackmouth</b> <b>catshark</b> {{exhibits}} multiple oviparity, {{in which more than}} one egg can mature within each oviduct simultaneously. Females may contain up to 13 developing eggs, though 1–4 per oviduct is typical. The number of eggs laid annually per female has been estimated at between 60 and 100, increasing with female size. Only the right ovary is functional in mature females. The egg case is vase-shaped and bears a slight flange along the lateral margins; the anterior end is squared off, with a pair of stubby, coiled horns at the corners, while the posterior end is rounded. The surface of the case is somewhat translucent, smooth, and glossy. The case is a golden brown color when first laid, and becomes dark brown in sea water. Egg cases produced by Atlantic sharks measure [...] long and [...] across. Those produced by Mediterranean sharks tend to be smaller at [...] long and [...] across. Larger females produce slightly larger egg cases.|$|E
500|$|The {{reported}} maximum lengths attained by the <b>blackmouth</b> <b>catshark</b> {{varies from}} [...] for Atlantic sharks and [...] for Mediterranean sharks; a length record of [...] may be dubious. Females attain a larger ultimate size than males. The maximum weight on record is [...] This species has a slender, firm {{body with a}} rather long, pointed snout comprising roughly 6–9% of the total length. The anterior rim of each nostril bears a large triangular flap, which divides the nostril into incurrent and excurrent openings. The eyes are horizontally oval and equipped with rudimentary nictitating membranes (protective third eyelids). Beneath each eye is a subtle ridge, and behind is a small spiracle. The mouth forms a short, wide arch, and bears moderately long furrows around the corners. The upper and lower jaws contain around 69 and 79 tooth rows respectively. Each tooth is small, with a narrow central cusp flanked by one or two smaller cusplets on either side. There are five pairs of gill slits, with the fifth pair over the pectoral fin bases.|$|E
