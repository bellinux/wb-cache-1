The schools are suffering from a confusing array of expectations and a crippling ovefload of functions. Our present {{efforts to improve the}} schools appear to be unproductive <b>because</b> <b>we</b> are almostblindly <b>ca</b> 't up in a single model of change that stems directly from our We ern rational bias. The rational bias of our highly technological culture places purposes before activity in a linear fashion and has produced the research, development, dissemination, and evaluation (RDDSE) model of cha:tge that serves rather well when we have a. purpose in mind, when we know what it is we want to do or produce. The responsive,view embodied in the League of Cooperating Schools model that involves staff dialogue, making decisions, taking action, and endeavoring to evaluate both the process and its outcomes (DDAE) is conducive to probes, open-ended inquiry, andithe kind-of exploratory activities designed more for finding a course of action than for reaffirming directions already preceived.
