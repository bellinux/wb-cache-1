25|$|When {{there is}} an {{increased}} demand for <b>base</b> <b>money,</b> the central bank must act if it wishes to maintain the short-term interest rate. It does this by increasing the supply of base money: {{it goes to the}} open market to buy a financial asset, such as government bonds. To pay for these assets, new central bank money is generated in the seller's loro account, increasing the total amount of <b>base</b> <b>money</b> in the economy. Conversely, if the central bank sells these assets in the open market, the <b>base</b> <b>money</b> is reduced.|$|E
25|$|The {{solvency}} constraint of {{the standard}} central bank only requires that the present discounted value of its net non-monetary liabilities (separate from its monetary liabilities accrued through seigniorage attempts) be zero or negative in the long run. Its monetary liabilities are liabilities only in name, as they are irredeemable: the holder of <b>base</b> <b>money</b> cannot insist at any time on the redemption of a given amount of <b>base</b> <b>money</b> into anything else other than {{the same amount of}} itself (base money)—unless, of course, the holder of said <b>base</b> <b>money</b> is another central bank reclaiming the value of its original interest-free loan.|$|E

40|$|Money {{laundering}} {{and especially}} its sub-division trade <b>based</b> <b>money</b> laundering {{have been identified}} as increasing threats to the international economy. Money laundering harms the entire global economy however the knowledge about the nature of money laundering and therefore the actions to prevent it is still at a low level. Trade <b>based</b> <b>money</b> laundering abuses the international trade system and the parties involved in it such as importers, exporters and financial institutions. In the money laundering process the banks {{can be used as a}} remittance system and thereby as means to make the illegal money deriving from a criminal act appear clean. Not only the trade finance products but also the other banking products are under the risk of being used in the money laundering process by the criminals. The research tries to find out what are the perceptions of people working closely with anti-money laundering on why, how and what –aspects of trade <b>based</b> <b>money</b> laundering and anti-money laundering. Moreover, the aim was to increase the awareness of trade <b>based</b> <b>money</b> laundering and fill the existing gap within the research on trade <b>based</b> <b>money</b> laundering and anti-money laundering. The research was conducted as interviews with four experts working either in trade finance, compliance, national crime investigation or banking supervision. The aim was to include views from different stages from the anti-money laundering chain. These interviews were conducted as theme interviews and the analysis compared the perceptions from the interviewees to the current available literature and studies. It was noticed during the research that the knowledge among the interviewees was dispersed and especially the money laundering process was unfamiliar and the different phases were not well recognized. However, the signals for the suspicious money laundering cases were widely recognized and they reflected the current literature well. Still, it was noted that at the moment the anti-money laundering process is based on reactive actions instead of being proactive. Therefore, there is a need for more proactive approach to anti-money laundering in order to be able to respond to the increasing threat of money laundering in the international business...|$|R

25|$|Another {{measure of}} money, M0, is also used; {{unlike the other}} measures, it does not {{represent}} actual purchasing power by firms and households in the economy. M0 is <b>base</b> <b>money,</b> or {{the amount of money}} actually issued by the central bank of a country. It is measured as currency plus deposits of banks and other institutions at the central bank. M0 is also the only money that can satisfy the reserve requirements of commercial banks.|$|E
25|$|An {{open market}} {{operation}} (OMO) is an activity by a central bank to give (or take) liquidity in its currency to (or from) a bank {{or a group of}} banks. The central bank can either buy or sell government bonds in the open market (this is where the name was historically derived from) or, in what is now mostly the preferred solution, enter into a repo or secured lending transaction with a commercial bank: the central bank gives the money as a deposit for a defined period and synchronously takes an eligible asset as collateral. A central bank uses OMO as the primary means of implementing monetary policy. The usual aim of {{open market operation}}s is - aside from supplying commercial banks with liquidity and sometimes taking surplus liquidity from commercial banks - to manipulate the short-term interest rate and the supply of <b>base</b> <b>money</b> in an economy, and thus indirectly control the total money supply, in effect expanding money or contracting the money supply. This involves meeting the demand of <b>base</b> <b>money</b> at the target interest rate by buying and selling government securities, or other financial instruments. Monetary targets, such as inflation, interest rates, or exchange rates, are used to guide this implementation.|$|E
25|$|Because banks hold {{reserves}} in amounts {{that are less}} than the amounts of their deposit liabilities, and because the deposit liabilities are considered money in their own right, fractional-reserve banking permits the money supply to grow beyond {{the amount of the}} underlying <b>base</b> <b>money</b> originally created by the central bank. In most countries, the central bank (or other monetary authority) regulates bank credit creation, imposing reserve requirements and capital adequacy ratios. This can slow down the process of money creation that occurs in the commercial banking system, and helps to ensure that banks are solvent and have enough funds to meet demand for withdrawals. However, rather than directly controlling the money supply, central banks usually pursue an interest rate target to adjust the rate of inflation and bank issuance of credit.|$|E

25|$|As in Peace Walker, The Phantom Pain {{features}} a base-building {{system that allows}} players to develop weapons and items from their home base. Recruitment of enemy soldiers and prisoners has also returned for this purpose, allowing the base to grow through organization. The player is given the option to access their base from their real-life smartphones and other devices via a companion app. Unlike in Peace Walker where players can only see Mother Base from the air, they can control Snake as he explores the complex on foot. The Fulton surface-to-air recovery system, an item introduced into gameplay in Peace Walker, returns as well, with players able to transport captured soldiers and other objects such as animals and vehicles back to Mother <b>Base.</b> <b>Money</b> for upgrading Mother Base's defenses and technology can be collected from objects found all over the map, such as diamonds, shipping containers, and special blueprint boxes, as well as sending recruited soldiers on combat missions around the world. The income is invested on upgrades to the appearance and abilities, weapons and equipment of Snake, his AI companions, and vehicles. For example, Snake's prosthetic arm can be modified with a taser, echolocation function, or remote controls that allow it to fly as a drone.|$|E
2500|$|The money {{multiplier}} is a heuristic used {{to demonstrate the}} maximum amount of broad money that could be created by commercial banks for a given fixed amount of <b>base</b> <b>money</b> and reserve ratio. This theoretical maximum is never reached, because some eligible reserves are held as cash outside of banks. Rather than holding the quantity of <b>base</b> <b>money</b> fixed, central banks have recently pursued an interest rate target to control bank issuance of credit indirectly so the ceiling implied by the {{money multiplier}} does not impose a limit on money creation in practice.|$|E
2500|$|Commercial {{bank money}} is created through fractional-reserve banking, the banking {{practice}} where banks keep {{only a fraction}} of their deposits in reserve (as cash and other highly liquid assets) and lend out the remainder, while maintaining the simultaneous obligation to redeem all these deposits upon demand. Commercial bank money differs from commodity and fiat money in two ways: firstly it is non-physical, as its existence is only reflected in the account ledgers of banks and other financial institutions, and secondly, there is some element of risk that the claim will not be fulfilled if the financial institution becomes insolvent. The process of fractional-reserve banking has a cumulative effect of money creation by commercial banks, as it expands money supply (cash and demand deposits) beyond what it would otherwise be. [...] Because of the prevalence of fractional reserve banking, the broad money supply of most countries is a multiple larger than the amount of <b>base</b> <b>money</b> created by the country's central bank. That multiple (called the money multiplier) is determined by the reserve requirement or other financial ratio requirements imposed by financial regulators.|$|E

60|$|The Kings {{of these}} realms enjoy several powers, wherein the laws have not interposed: So {{they can make}} war and peace {{without the consent of}} Parliament; {{and this is a very}} great {{prerogative}}. But if the Parliament doth not approve of the war, the King must bear the charge of it out of his own purse, and this is as great a check on the crown. So the King hath a prerogative to coin money without consent of Parliament. But he cannot compel the subject to take that money except it be sterling, gold or silver; because herein he is limited by law. Some princes have indeed extended their prerogative further than the law allowed them; wherein however, the lawyers of succeeding ages, as fond as they are of precedents, have never dared to justify them. But to say the truth, it is only of late times that prerogative hath been fixed and ascertained. For whoever reads the histories of England, will find that some former Kings, and these none of the worst, have upon several occasions ventured to control the laws with very little ceremony or scruple, even later than the days of Queen Elizabeth.

40|$|The use of {{economic}} incentives for biodiversity (mostly Compensation and Reward for Environmental Services including Payment for ES) {{has been widely}} supported in the past decades and became the main innovative policy tools for biodiversity conservation worldwide. These policy tools are often based on the insight that rational actors perfectly weigh {{the costs and benefits}} of adopting certain behaviors and well-crafted economic incentives and disincentives will lead to socially desirable development scenarios. This rationalist mode of thought has provided interesting insights and results, but it also misestimates the context by which ‘real individuals’ come to decisions, and the multitude of factors influencing development sequences. In this study, our goal is to examine how these policies can take advantage of some unintended behavioral reactions that might in return impact, either positively or negatively, general policy performances. We test the effect of income's origin (‘Low effort’ <b>based</b> <b>money</b> vs. ‘High effort’ <b>based</b> <b>money)</b> on spending decisions (Necessity vs. Superior goods) and subsequent pro social preferences (Future pro-environmental behavior) within Madagascar rural areas, using a natural field experiment. Our results show that money obtained under low effort leads to different consumption patterns than money obtained under high efforts: superior goods are more salient in the case of low effort money. In parallel, money obtained under low effort leads to subsequent higher pro social behavior. Compensation and rewards policies for ecosystem services may mobilize knowledge on behavioral biases to improve their design and foster positive spillovers on their development goals...|$|R

40|$|Australian {{monetary}} {{economists have}} {{for some time}} been intermittently concerned with {{the relationship between the}} monetary <b>base</b> and the <b>money</b> stock. Controversy has centred around a number of issues, including: the exogeneity of the money base; the substitutability of cash and other liquid assets in the management of banks’ reserves; the causal significance of the budget deficit of the consolidated government sector relative to imported disturbances; and the appropriate definition of the <b>money</b> <b>base</b> in Australia. This paper provides some additional evidence relevant to this debate. Changes in the financial system during the last two decades, including partial deregulation of the banking system, and the growth of finance companies and permanent building societies, suggest the need for a careful examination of the money/money base relationship. These changes are likely to have altered both the time series properties of the monetary aggregates and may also have changed the observed relationship between various measures of <b>money</b> <b>base</b> and the <b>money</b> stock. The evidence presented in this paper suggests that this may have occurred. The analysis is directed towards three questions. Does the money multiplier vary significantly in terms of its stability with differing measures of <b>money</b> and <b>money</b> <b>base?</b> What is the behavioural significance of differences in stability? How does the causal relationship between <b>money</b> and <b>money</b> <b>base</b> vary over time and with different concepts of <b>base</b> and <b>money?</b> Graphical, numerical and time series analysis are used to shed light on these issues. The results are in some cases conflicting due to the strigent techniques for determining causality but we conclude: • there is evidence of considerable instability in the money multiplier for most concepts of <b>money</b> <b>base</b> during the 60 s and 70 s. Financial innovation may have been important in this instability. The timing of significant changes in the financial system is consistent with observed instabilities of the multipliers; • the evidence suggests that the M 2 money multiplier for the extended base is the most stable for both the sixties and seventies; • there is evidence of contemporaneous correlation between <b>money</b> <b>base</b> measures and the money stock (for M 2 and M 3) but that the results for the seventies indicate the presence of both a positive causal effect on the money supply from innovations in the <b>money</b> <b>base</b> and feedback effects from the money stock to money base; • there is evidence of some structural change in the time series models for some aggregates between the late sixties and the late seventies; in addition, there is evidence of a structural change within the sixties relating primarily to the private sector’s demand for cash relative to other monetary aggregates and to the growth of the permanent building societies. ...|$|R
