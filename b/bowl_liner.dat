40|$|Abstract. This {{research}} {{is part of a larger}} project to investigate the wear and friction of the centre bearing of a rail freight truck. Existing centre bearing surfaces include flame hardened AISI 1030 steel and AISI 1053 cast steel top centres mating against un-greased and/or greased Hadfield steel centre <b>bowl</b> <b>liners,</b> and polyethylene centre <b>bowl</b> <b>liners.</b> The wear life of the unlubricated steels against Hadfield steel is short, greasing the bearings is costly, and industry reports some failures of polyethylene centre <b>bowl</b> <b>liners</b> due to excessive plastic flow and cracking of the rim wall. The present research investigates the materials characterisation of plasma nitrided AISI 4016 molybdenum alloy steel that could be used as an alternative centre bearing surface. The quench and tempered AISI 4016 steel samples were plasma nitrided at 450, 500, 550 and 580 °C using 75 % N 2 : 25 % H 2 mixture gas for 5 hours. The microstructures of the coatings were determined using optical microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. The treated samples were characterised using x-ray diffraction and microhardness. The optimum condition for this material was achieved at the temperature of 500 0 C...|$|R

5000|$|M1916: on Portugal's {{entry into}} the First World War in 1916, the country lacked the {{facilities}} to produce its own helmets and looked to the United Kingdom. British helmet production {{at that time was}} giving priority to their own forces, however the Director of Munitions Supply was able to source a commercially produced version of the Brodie helmet, originally intended to be sold to British officers at the time when helmets were in short supply. Given the Portuguese designation [...] "M1916", it equipped the Portuguese Expeditionary Corps. Made of thin-gauge steel, the bowl was fluted in an attempt to add strength. Unfortunately, the fluting actually increased the chances of penetration if a missile hit one of the ridges, so some M1916s were produced with a plain <b>bowl.</b> A simple <b>liner</b> was laced to the shell through a series of holes.|$|R
40|$|In 1999 QR {{introduced}} {{a fleet of}} 2500 new coal wagons with nylon bogie centre <b>bowl</b> wear <b>liners</b> into service in Central Queensland. Within months wheel wear on these wagons and other wagons were exceeding 5 mm per 100, 000 km. Initial investigations focused on traditional causes of increases in wheel and rail wear such as badly profiled rail and poor rail/wheel lubrication. Wagon bogie rotational resistance was not considered until later following concerns raised regarding the possible additional rotational resistance created by the constant contact side bearers. Rotational resistance testing was undertaken by QR's Rollingstock Engineering Division in conjunction with Coal & Freight Services Group and some interesting results were found. The constant contact side bearings were not the source of major rotational resistance under the loaded wagon as first thought. Also the rotational resistance of the polymer liners {{was found to be}} excessive and concluded to be the root cause of the high wheel wear. A centre bowl lubrication programme was initiated and wheel wear was under control within two measurement periods with wheel life wear improved on all wagons, old and new. Since that time QR has undertaken extensive trials of different centre bowl types and found several more suitable materials which are now in use. In keeping with the above thrust, the Rail CRC Australia’s Bogie Rotation Friction Management project (Project 82) is investigating a range of factors that affect bogie rotation friction, including centre bowl friction, curve transition design and side bearer type. An extensive simulation-based parametric study was performed {{to determine the effects of}} varying side bearer type, centre bowl friction level, wagon loading conditions and speed on the wear characteristics of the wheelsets of a rail vehicle that runs on a selected track system. A 62 degree-of-freedom vehicle model was used for the simulations; the model was developed using the VAMPIRE® simulation package. New wheel and new rail profiles were used for the analysis to give an indication of the initial wear characteristics of the wheelsets. In this paper, an analysis of the results obtained is presented and conclusions are drawn based on the findings...|$|R
40|$|The fuel {{penetration}} and reacting diesel jet {{development have}} been studied in a small-bore optical engine to improve the understanding of a swirl-influenced, wall-interacting diesel flame. The optical access to the engine combustion chamber was made possible via multiple quartz windows positioned in a cylindrical piston <b>bowl</b> and cylinder <b>liner.</b> Using the common-rail fuel injection system of the engine, the fuel injection was executed for long duration, creating negative ignition dwell conditions in which the start of combustion occurs {{before the end of}} injection. A single-hole nozzle was used to isolate the jet-wall interaction from jet-jet interactions while limiting the in-cylinder pressure below the burst-pressure of quartz windows. Planar laser-induced fluorescence imaging of hydroxyl (OH-PLIF), fuel-PLIF, and line-of-sight integrated chemiluminescence imaging were performed for various combustion stages identified by the in-cylinder pressure traces and apparent heat release rates. These include stages of vaporising fuel penetration, low-temperature reaction, and high-temperature reaction. The fuel-PLIF images show that the fuel penetration was strongly influenced by a swirl flow with the wall-jet penetration on the up-swirl side being shorter than that of the down-swirl jet. During the low-temperature reaction, cool flame chemiluminescence appears in the wall-jet head region. Interestingly, this region is where a turbulent ring-vortex is formed due to jet-wall interactions, suggesting that locally enhanced mixing induced the first-stage ignition. The OH-PLIF images show that the second-stage, high-temperature reaction starts to occur and then expand drastically in the same wall-jet head region. Since the reaction occurs in the wall-jet region, the swirl flow impacts the high-temperature reaction significantly, as evidenced by more intense OH signals in the down-swirl jet. This is due to the influence of the swirl flow on the mixing process, leading to relatively richer mixtures on the down-swirl side. Upon the end of fuel injection, the heat release rate declines and the OH-PLIF signals slowly diminish. How the variation in injection pressure influences the combustion processes of a wall-interacting diesel jet has also been investigated. The cool-flame images together with the apparent heat release rate suggest that the low-temperature reaction still emerges from the wall-interacting jet head region but it becomes stronger with increasing injection pressure due to the better air-fuel mixing at the enhanced turbulent ring-vortex. The influence of in-cylinder swirl flow on the OH* chemiluminescence signals was again observed such that the high-temperature reaction in the down-swirl side of the jet occurs earlier than that in the up-swirl side of the jet regardless of the injection pressure. Moreover, the second-stage ignition on the down-swirl side of the jet is also found to be stronger than the up-swirl side of the jet initially. However, as the injection pressure increases and the high temperature reaction matures, the spread and magnitude of the up-swirl OH* chemiluminescence signals become comparable to the down-swirl signals owing to the increased injection momentum overcoming the swirl flow. The OH-PLIF signals indicate that the high-temperature reaction zone continues to grow in the turbulent ring-vortex region where the cool-flame signals were detected at earlier timings. The expansion of wall-jet head OH signals shows an interestingly growing trend with increasing injection pressure, which can be explained by a stronger ring-vortex due to the increased injection momentum. At selected operating conditions of 100 MPa common-rail pressure and long 2. 04 -ms injection duration, planar laser-induced incandescence (PLII) imaging has been performed to clarify soot processes within the wall-interacting jet. Once again, a single-hole nozzle was used to isolate the jet-wall interaction from jet-jet interactions and to apply long injection duration corresponding to high-load engine operating conditions in which soot formation is particularly problematic. Compared to the previous experiments, two major changes were made in fuel and piston design. As opposed to a conventional diesel fuel used in the previous experiments, the soot diagnostics were conduced using methyl decanoate, a surrogate fuel with low-sooting propensity, to reduce laser attenuation. In addition, the piston bowl design was modified to include a curved bowl wall to enhance the fuel jet penetration back towards the nozzle, which is closer to the conditions in most production engines. Laser-based images show that the fuel impinges on the bowl wall soon after the start of injection and then bounces off along the wall forming a wall-interacting jet. The fuel jet continues to travel along the bowl wall as well as the bottom surface of the piston bowl. Although the latter motion was not significant in the previous experiments, with the new curved bowl-wall, the fuel penetration back towards the nozzle was clearly observed. During the premixed burn phase of diesel combustion, the high-temperature reaction starts to occur at {{the leading edge of the}} penetrating jet back towards the nozzle, initially near the jet axis and then spreads in the radial direction. During the mixing-controlled burn phase, the high-temperature reaction zone fills up the entire combustion chamber and the soot formation starts to occur in the rich area near the wall impingement point. The soot then flows along the bowl wall in both up-swirl and down-swirl directions. Throughout this phase, these soot pockets are surrounded by OH, which disappear altogether at subsequent crank angle locations suggesting the soot oxidation by OH radicals. However, some soot pockets are transported into the centre of bowl due to the downward movement of the piston and persist for long as there are no active OH radicals. To conclude, these major findings made on the temporal and spatial evolution of a wall-interacting diesel jet, its variations with increasing injection pressure, and the soot concentration within the jet are summarised by illustrating regions of fuel, low- and high-temperature reaction, as well as soots for various crank angle locations during a firing cycle of the engine...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{is divided into}} four related sections of work. The first relates to the rim wall wear of the existing unlubricated steel, and polyethylene centre bearing components. Based on these findings, {{the second and third}} sections of work includes materials characterisation of alternative centre bearing surfaces - plasma nitrided molybdenum steel and stellite 6 laser clad layers, respectively. Finally, in the last section of work, the reciprocating pin-on-plate wear test method is used to evaluate the friction and wear of the existing and alternative centre bearing materials. The worn dimensions of the AISI 1053 steel, Hadfield steel, and polyethylene centre bearing components were determined. The wear of the high density polyethylene centre <b>bowl</b> <b>liner</b> was negligible. The rim wall wear of the unlubricated steel components was greatest in the longitudinal direction, whilst there was negligible wear in the lateral direction. The average wear depth rate for the AISI 1053 steel top centre was approximately twice that of the Hadfield steel centre <b>bowl</b> <b>liner.</b> The cross-sectional microhardness and microstructure of one worn AISI 1053 steel top centre and two worn Hadfield steel centre bowl liners were determined. The worn Hadfield steel centre bowl liners showed significant near surface work hardening. The wear mechanism for the AISI 1053 steel top centre was plastic strain accumulation in conjunction with low cycle fatigue.

40|$|The {{research}} has simulated the forces experienced {{at the center}} bowl from a longitudinal train dynamic for cylindrical type bogie center bearings. Results show all but the lightest longitudinal train dynamics generate impact loads at the center bowl for empty wagons. Bolster pitching during such events gives rise to point contact loads being experienced by the materials of the center bowl and top center potentially failing plastic liners and damaging metallic liners. Vertical rim friction forces during impact against the rim wall are {{a significant factor in}} generating point loads on the center bowl plate surface. The shear loads from rim friction are likely to be the primary factor in causing broken rim failures in plastic bowl liners. Increasing the center bearing diameter was shown to increase contact loads against the rim wall without significantly lowering the peak vertical point loads between the top center and <b>bowl</b> <b>liner...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{level of}} sliding {{friction}} between the mating top centre and centre <b>bowl</b> <b>liner</b> components of a rail freight truck centre bearing provides {{both positive and negative}} effects on rail vehicle dynamics. Currently used centre bearing surfaces include AISI 1053 steel top centres mating against unlubricated and lubricated Hadfield steel, and polyethylene centre bowl liners. The wear life of the unlubricated AISI 1053 steel top centre against Hadfield steel is short, whilst the low friction of the lubricated and polyethylene surfaces can be detrimental to vehicle dynamics. It is proposed to use laser clad Stellite 6 as one of the bearing surfaces. Stellite 6 multi-track layers were laser cladded on mild and AISI 4016 steel substrates with a continuous wave Nd:YAG laser at 1800 W laser source power using four different processing speeds: 600, 900, 1200, and 1500 mm/min, whilst the laser power, defocused laser spot size, and powder feed rate were constant. The cladding samples were characterised using optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in conjunction with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Microhardness profiles of the cladded layer and heat affected zone were determined. The effect of processing speed on cladded layer height, depth of penetration and dilution has been examined. The main difference between the samples clad onto the two different substrates was the microstructure and hardness of the heat affected zone. Untempered martensite was observed in the heat affected zone of the AISI 4016 steel substrate at 1500 mm/min. For both substrates the optimum processing speed is between 600 and 900 mm/min...|$|E
