He placed {{second at}} the 2005 Skate America, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> that his Grease free skate was not working. Lysacek and coach Frank Carroll made the {{decision}} to find a new long program. Lysacek's new Carmen program was a success at the 2005 NHK Trophy, where Lysacek placed second. Lysacek was the only American man to qualify for the 2005–2006 Grand Prix Final, but he withdrew before the event because of bursitis and tendinitis in his right hip.|$|E
5|$|All four {{ships were}} officially laid down on 19 December 1912, but work {{did not begin}} until March–April 1913. After a {{progress}} review on 4 June 1914, launching of the first pair of ships was delayed until October 1914. When World War I began, the hull of Izmail, the most advanced ship, was judged 43percent complete, with the others lagging considerably behind. The war caused more delays, including problems obtaining imported components, and the ships were competing for scarce resources with other production deemed necessary for the war. Three of the four ships were launched in 1915, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> that Russian industry {{would not be able}} to complete them during the war, mostly because the turrets were seriously delayed. They were reclassified as 2nd rank projects by the Main Administration of Shipbuilding in 1916.|$|E
5|$|In October 1974 Abu Nidal {{formed the}} ANO, calling it Fatah: The Revolutionary Council. In November that year a Fatah court {{sentenced him to}} death in {{absentia}} for the attempted assassination of Mahmoud Abbas. Seale writes that {{it is unlikely that}} Abu Nidal had intended to kill Abbas, and just as unlikely that Fatah wanted to kill Abu Nidal. He was invited to Beirut to discuss the death sentence, and was allowed to leave again, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> that he had become persona non grata. As a result, the Iraqis gave him Fatah's assets in Iraq, including a training camp, farm, newspaper, radio station, passports, overseas scholarships and $15 million worth of Chinese weapons. He also received Iraq's regular aid to the PLO: around $150,000 a month and a lump sum of $3–5 million.|$|E

5|$|The protests were to no avail. The statue {{was quietly}} removed before dawn on 10 March 1910 by four council workmen, {{accompanied}} by 120 police officers. Nine days later, 3,000 anti-vivisectionists gathered in Trafalgar Square to demand its return, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> by then that Battersea Council had turned {{its back on}} the affair. The statue was at first hidden in the borough surveyor's bicycle shed, according to a letter his daughter wrote in 1956 to the British Medical Journal, then reportedly destroyed by a council blacksmith, who melted it down. Anti-vivisectionists filed a High Court petition demanding its return, but the case was dismissed in January 1911.|$|E
5|$|The {{lessons learned}} during the South African War of 1899-1902 had {{reinforced}} {{the idea that}} the regular Army was not capable of fighting a prolonged full-scale war without significant assistance; almost all regular units in the United Kingdom had been deployed overseas within four months of the outbreak of hostilities, and the entire pool of reserve manpower had been exhausted in under a year. There had been no thought before the war to using auxiliary forces overseas; in the event, volunteers had been used on an ad-hoc basis, and a new auxiliary arm (the Imperial Yeomanry) was formed to provide specialist troops, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> that a more effective system was required in future. A number of attempts at reform under the Conservative government of 1901-1905 had failed to make any lasting changes to the system, and left the auxiliary forces disorganised and demoralised.|$|E
5|$|As in {{the first}} Prayer Book, the origins and {{participants}} {{in the work of}} its revision are obscure, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> that Cranmer led the project and steered its development. It had begun as early as the end of 1549 when the Convocation of Canterbury met to discuss the matter. Late in 1550, the opinions of Martyr and Bucer were sought on how the liturgy might be improved and they significantly influenced the revision. The spiritual presence view was clarified by the use of entirely different words when the communicants are offered the bread and the wine. New rubrics noted that any kind of bread could be used and any bread or wine that remained could be used by the curate, thus disassociating the elements from any physical presence. The new book removed any possibility of prayers for the dead, as such prayers implied support for the doctrine of purgatory. The Act of Uniformity 1552, which authorised the book's use, specified that it be exclusively used from 1 November. However, the final version was not officially published until nearly the last minute, due to Dudley's intervention. While travelling in the north of the country, he met the Scots reformer, John Knox, then based in Newcastle. Impressed by his preaching, Dudley selected him to be a royal chaplain and brought him south to participate in the reform projects. In a sermon before the king, Knox attacked the practice of kneeling during communion. On 27 September 1552, the Privy Council stopped the printing of the new Prayer Book and told Cranmer to revise it. He responded with a long letter using the argument that it was for Parliament with the royal assent to decide any changes in the liturgy. On 22 October, the council decided to keep the liturgy as it is and add the so-called Black Rubric, which explained that no adoration was intended when kneeling at communion.|$|E

25|$|By 1935, it {{was found}} that the He 60's {{performance}} was lacking and the RLM asked Heinkel to design its replacement. The result was the He 114.

25|$|A half-hearted {{plan for}} {{international}} control was proposed at {{the newly formed}} United Nations by Bernard Baruch (The Baruch Plan), <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> both to American commentators—and to the Soviets—that it was an attempt primarily to stymie Soviet nuclear efforts.

25|$|The Earl of Pembroke, a {{moderate}} baron with strong French links, intervened {{in an attempt}} to defuse the crisis.

25|$|Connecting the new Philadelphia Branch to {{the rest}} of the B system was a {{considerable}} engineering challenge. A new surface line across the center of town was politically impossible and prohibitively expensive. Building around the outskirts of town would have required massive regrading and bridging, as the terrain is extremely hilly and the line would cut across every watershed flowing into the harbor. As a temporary expedient, traffic was handled through Baltimore on carfloats, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> that a direct connection would have to be built.|$|E

According to a number of sources (including Herbert Strudwick), he had been in good health and spirits before leaving England. A widespread rumour that he had committed suicide was disproved by research carried out by Ralph Barker. Richardson was buried in Richmond Cemetery.|$|E
25|$|Geelong soldiered on, however, and met Essendon at the MCG, winning by ten points despite {{leading by}} over six goals at three quarter time.

In the second half, Brisbane took control and steadied enough to win by a small margin of nine points. Post season, Geelong signed Nathan Ablett to play AFL football for Geelong. Another major signing was disgruntled Richmond big-man Brad Ottens, recruited to counter Geelong's lack of forward line height. Cameron Ling capped off a fine season by winning his first Best and Fairest after finishing runner up in the previous two counts.|$|E
