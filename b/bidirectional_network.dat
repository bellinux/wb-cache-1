In the first experiment, spatial and temporal manipulations of illusory contours are used to test the hypothesis that a <b>bidirectional</b> <b>network</b> is responsible for illusory contour formation. In the second experiment, incomplete and backgrounded versions of the same object are studied to test the hypothesis that the real purpose of neural back projections is segmentation rather than object completion.

Component swapping modularity in control systems can be achieved by utilizing “smart ” components which can perform control actions within the module, and <b>bidirectional</b> <b>network</b> communication. In this paper we analyze an engine speed control system from the perspective of achieving swapping modularity of the throttle actuator. Specifically, we analyze approaches to distribute the optimal controller transfer function between a throttle actuator time constant dependent portion (which is swappable with the actuator) and throttle actuator time constant independent portion (which {{does not need to be}} changed when the actuator is swapped).

In this phase, the relays first combine the information-bearing symbols transmitted by the sources, and then broadcast {{them back to the}} sources in order to achieve bidirectional communications. Two different combining methods at the relays are considered. The first one is that the relays transmit linear combinations of the information-bearing symbols to the sources by beamforming. We develop an algorithm that can compute the optimum beamforming vector in closed form and this beamforming vector minimizes the outage probability of the <b>bidirectional</b> cooperative <b>network.</b> The second method is that the relays combine the information-bearing symbols by exclusive-or and then transmit them to the sources by beamforming. For this case, we show that the instantaneous signal-to-noise ratios at the sources depend on the values of the information-bearing symbols. Based on [1], the optimum beamforming vector is computed and it minimizes an upper bound of the outage probability of the <b>bidirectional</b> cooperative <b>network.</b> Index Terms—Cooperative systems, diversity methods, fading channels, beamforming.

We focus on <b>bidirectional</b> <b>network</b> coding, i. e., forward and reverse flows between two nodes are coded together, which is key for efficient utilization of the wireless medium as it allows intermediate nodes to relay traffic in both directions with a single transmission. We analyze the performance in terms of decoding and acknowledgement times in a three-node network when nodes are fully backlogged. The results are compared to the theoretic lower bound obtained by solving the network’s flow formulation. In addition, we derive symmetric injection rates from the these results which the network {{should be able to}} sustain. The evolution of source backlogs and decoding/acknowledgement over time are simulated, demonstrating that backlogs remain bounded.

This makes the OSS protocol much more reliable than existing protocols. In order to show the performance improvement, we first derive a lower bound of the outage probability of the OSS protocol. Numerical results demonstrate that this lower bound is extremely tight and it indicates that the OSS protocol achieves full diversity order two in a <b>bidirectional</b> cooperative <b>network</b> with two sources and one relay. Then exact and approximate lower bounds of average bit error rates (BERs) at both sources in the OSS protocol are derived. Those lower bounds {{are very close to}} the exact average BERs as shown by numerical results. Lastly, an optimum power allocation scheme is developed for the OSS protocol. This scheme can optimize the outage probability, average BER, and data-rate of the OSS protocol at the same time.

The hypothalamic effects of the cytokines are fast and mediated by the prostaglandins and by the nitric oxide (NO) pathway. In contrast, the cytokines at pituitary level have a slow onset of effect and their effects are not mediated by the prostaglandins or by the NO pathway. The immuno-neuroendocrine interactions are involved in numerous physiological and pathophysiological conditions.

40|$|We {{consider}} a <b>bidirectional</b> <b>network</b> {{in which two}} users exchange information {{with the help of}} a buffer-aided relay. In such a network without direct link between user 1 and user 2, there exist six possible transmission modes, i. e., four point-to-point modes (user 1 -to-relay, user 2 -to-relay, relay-to-user 1, relay-to-user 2), a multiple access mode (both users to the relay), and a broadcast mode (the relay to both users). Because of the buffering capability at the relay, the transmissions in the network are not restricted to adhere to a predefined schedule, and therefore, all the transmission modes in the bidirectional relay network can be used adaptively based on the instantaneous channel state information (CSI) of the involved links. For the considered network, assuming fixed transmit powers for both the users and the relay, we derive the optimal transmission mode selection policy which maximizes the sum rate. The proposed policy selects one out of the six possible transmission modes in each time slot based on the instantaneous CSI.

40|$|Abstract—This paper proposes XOR-BiDO, a data {{delivery}} scheme (DDS) {{suited for}} multihop underwater acoustic networks characterized by regular bidirectional traffic streams. DDSs for multihop underwater networks usually assume a singlesink configuration, {{where most of}} the transmissions flow in a single direction. Throughput performance decreases and fairness suffers when such DDSs are subjected to heavy bidirectional traffic streams due to increase of queueing delays at relay nodes. This paper proposes the integration of an opportunistic XOR network coding layer into BiDO, a scheme previously designed for single-sink underwater networks. This coding layer actively and opportunistically mixes data frames whenever a coding opportunity arises. By effectively transmitting more data in fewer transmissions at each relay node, the result is a scheme that (1) maximizes usage of the underwater acoustic channel’s scarce bandwidth, (2) provides better fairness for bidirectional traffic and (3) improves energy-efficiency of submerged devices, while retaining the opportunistic-routing and network-wide overhearing features of BiDO. Using simulations, we demonstrate the network performance improvement of XOR-BiDO in terms of packet latency, fairness and energy-efficiency for <b>bidirectional</b> <b>network</b> traffic. While maintaining comparable reliability over a 10 -hop network, XOR-BiDO achieves a 12 % improvement in latency and consumes 24 % less energy per delivered packet against BiDO. I...|$|E

A crucial factor for the functioning of this intimate <b>bidirectional</b> <b>network</b> was the demonstration that the immune and neuroendocrine systems speak a mutual biochemical language. This implies 1) production of neuroendocrine hormones and neuropeptides by immune cells and of cytokines by neuroendocrine cells; 2) evidence for shared receptors on cells of the immune and neuroendocrine systems; 3) effect of neuroendocrine mediators on immune functions; and 4) effect of cytokines on the neuroendocrine system. This reduces traditional differences between neurotransmitters, hormones, and immune mediators and raises the following question: what can we now regard as immune or neuroendocrine? Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is one example of this paradigm. VIP has traditionally been classified as a neuropeptide/neurotransmitter based in its capacity to mediate and regulate neuronal functions. Recent work has demonstrated that VIP is produced by T cells, especially Th 2 cells, and that through specific receptors it exerts immunological functions typically ascribed to Th 2 cytokines in nervous and immune systems.
