5000|$|Inflator valve {{malfunction}} can {{inflate the}} bladder when the buoyancy is not needed, {{and if not}} recognized and dealt with promptly, can result in uncontrolled ascent with associated risk of decompression illness. This can happen more quickly with inflators combined with alternative demand valves as they must use a larger <b>bore</b> <b>hose</b> connector. However, the standard overpressure and dump valves provided are able to vent air faster than the inflator valve can fill the bladder. This can be mitigated by the ability to disconnect the inflator hose under pressure, a skill which is trained by some agencies.|$|E
40|$|To combat {{adhesion}} loss, sand {{is fired}} into the wheel–rail contact via a hose using compressed air typically from a storage hopper mounted to the under {{frame of the}} train. Many passenger trains in the UK are fitted with stepped braking controllers which range from 1 to 3 with a fourth step being ‘emergency braking’. 1 Sand is fired automatically if wheel slip is detected from brake step level 2 upwards. 2 Sand is automatically fired when the emergency brakes are applied irrespective of whether low adhesion/wheel slip has been detected. 2 For adhesion loss in traction, sand can be applied at the driver’s discretion. Current railway standards 2 govern the maximum permissible sand flow rate to protect against wheel/rail isolation of track circuits, but do not address the hose position. This results {{in a range of}} hose set-ups across different train types, some of which may not be effective at delivering sand. The work here was carried out using a full-scale laboratory rail–wheel test machine to find the position for the hose and sand flow rates that give optimum sand entrainment to the contact. It was found that ideally the hose should be aimed at the rail or nip and be as close to that contact as safely possible. The use of a 20 [*]mm bore nozzle {{on the end of a}} 25 [*]mm <b>bore</b> <b>hose</b> increased sand passing through the contact by up to 70 % relative to widely used 25 [*]mm bore hoses without a nozzle. Reduction in sand flow rate below the 2 [*]kg/min threshold significantly reduced the amount of sand entering the contact. It was also shown that relatively small movements in the hose/nozzle from its ideal position and cross winds significantly reduced sand entrainment...|$|E

Kvaliteta stanovanja i pripadajući prostor, od ideje do realizacije i recepcije, obuhvaćen u svim vidovima konceptualnih, simboličkih i materijalnih manifestacija, jedno je od najizazovnijih područja istraživanja povijesti arhitekture i dizajna, sociologije, antropologije i kulturalnih studija koje otvara nove vizure na povijest materijalne kulture, društvenu i političku povijest. Tekst elaborira značenje izložbi posvećenih stanovanju 1950 -ih godina s težištem na primjeru niza izložbi Porodica i domaćinstvo održanih u Zagrebu 1957., 1958. i 1960. godine. Analizira se kompleksnost njihove uloge u promoviranju modernog stanovanja, odnosno značenje navedene manifestacije te autorski doprinos Bernarda Bernardija, s težištem na specifičnom doprinosu artikuliranju društvene uloge arhitekture i dizajna. Argumentira se polazište da je riječ o izrazito kompleksnoj tipologiji i mediju koji se cjelovito sagledava u kontekstu suvremene debate i odnosa Istoka i Zapada pedesetih godina 20. stoljeća. In {{the period}} after World War II, modern housing {{and the quality}} of {{everyday}} life became a key segment of a broader debate on social, ideological, and cultural issues. Its sources reside in the interwar period, but it was only after 1945 that they acquired larger proportions in the framework of socio-economic restoration, industrialization, and attempts at solving housing problems. Propaganda and education in the period after the war were characterized by a variety of media which helped in communicating the new concepts of housing. That process was inseparable from the social role of the emerging design, which created the impression of the flourishing 1950 s, with a major contribution of professional organizations such as the British Council of Industrial Design or the Rat für Formgebung in West Germany. In the socialist countries of the Eastern Bloc, the culture of <b>hosing</b> <b>bore</b> the stamp of social realism, but after 1945 it acquired different features. Even though science and technology {{played a key role in}} the overall progress and the processes of modernizing the society, the ideological base and the socialist reality showed numerous contradictions between what was planned, proclaimed, and realized. Initiated in the atmosphere of reformatory optimism and good political relations with both East and West, the Family and Household exhibitions, which took place at the Zagreb Fairgrounds between 1957 and 1960, indicated that even the most difficult social problems, such as the issue of housing in the socio-economic constellation of the time, were to be solved systematically. However, the true scope of these exhibitions as a promotional example of the quality of life cannot be separated from the construction of housing facilities or from production programmes, in which the presented architectural solutions and designs were unfortunately not applied adequately. An indicative example, on the basis of which the authors have shown the transfer of postulates and ideas of Modernism to the area of housing problems, is the activity of Bernardo Bernardi (1921 - 1985), one of the Exat architects, all of whom graduated in the class of Zdenko Strižić, professor at the Faculty of Technology, Department of Architecture. Transfer of progressive trends was largely ensured through the pedagogical activity of Zagreb architects, who studied, like Strižić himself had done, with some of the most distinguished representatives of interwar functionalism, such as H. Poelzig, A. Loos, J. J. P. Oud, and Le Corbusier. They combined their functionalist approach with the traditional Japanese model of housing, as well as ideas of Charlotte Perriand, which created an important link to the postwar trend of purifying the living space and its furnishing. In this context, the authors have analyzed Bernardi’s proposals for a two-room and a three-room apartment with adequate industrial furnishing, which were presented at the 2 nd Family and Household exhibition in 1958 as a life-size model. In the section dedicated to furniture design, Bernardi indicated the need of creative standardization, proposing it as a solution to the acute problem of synchronizing furniture design and the newly created circumstances of small living quarters. At the 3 rd Family and Household exhibition in 1960, his awarded project called The Apartment of Our Immediate Future, used the disposition, organization, and furnishing of the living space in order to indicate the need of transforming the notion of habitation into that of the housing culture. Thus, the role of this exhibition series in this dynamic period, when the idea of housing was being transferred from the individual to the mass level, has been recognized as important and relevant...|$|R
