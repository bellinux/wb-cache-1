The structure consists of dark and <b>bright</b> <b>plates,</b> parallel to { 110 }, which, under no stress, exist in an equal amount. A plate has a fine structure, {{in which a}} set of twin-related variants adjoining on { 110 } interfaces is stacked together. That is, the dark plate contains two twin-related variants as does the <b>bright</b> <b>plate.</b> One variant in the <b>bright</b> <b>plate</b> {{is the same as}} one in the dark. The others are twin-related. In total, a grain is covered by equal amounts of three variants when transformation is completed.
