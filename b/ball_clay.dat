25|$|Corfe Castle lies in {{the centre}} of the Isle of Purbeck, a {{peninsula}} bordered by the English Channel to the south, and by the marshy lands of the River Frome and Poole Harbour to the north and east. At the beginning of the 19th century, the area around Corfe Castle was known for its supply of Purbeck <b>Ball</b> <b>Clay,</b> which at that time was shipped by a pair of horse-drawn tramways (the Middlebere Plateway and the Furzebrook Railway) to wharves on Poole Harbour. The port of Swanage {{at the tip of the}} Isle was equally well known for the Purbeck Marble that was mined locally and shipped out by sea.|$|E

25|$|The Old Quay {{was built}} in the mid-18th century on land leased from Lord Clifford. The opening of the Stover Canal by James Templer in 1792 {{provided}} a boost to the port due to the ease with which <b>ball</b> <b>clay</b> could be transported from the mines north of Newton Abbot. After travelling along the canal the barges continued down the estuary to the port. By 1820 this trade was supplemented by granite from the quarries near Haytor on Dartmoor carried via the unique granite-tracked Haytor Granite Tramway which was linked to the Stover Canal. The granite to build the new London Bridge came via this route and was sent from the New Quay, which had been built for this traffic in 1821–25 by George Templer, James's son.|$|E
25|$|The site of {{the clay}} works at Norden is now the {{location}} of the Norden station of the Swanage Railway, a heritage railway that has taken over the track of the Wareham to Swanage main line railway. The station is currently the northern terminus of the line, and the land of old clay processing works now provides a park and ride site whereby visitors can park at Norden and ride the train to Corfe Castle or Swanage. The Purbeck Mineral and Mining Museum is open and is dedicated to Purbeck clay industry and its associated tramways on the Norden site. The old Foreman's Office has been restored and is at the entrance and a relocated Mine building has been erected and a simulated mine tunnel and <b>ball</b> <b>clay</b> face completed to give the visitor a real experience of going down a mine.|$|E

2500|$|Towards {{the end of}} the orogeny the {{emplacement}} of a large batholith {{of granite}} occurred below what is now Devon and Cornwall. This granite is now exposed as Dartmoor, Bodmin Moor and several other exposures in Cornwall, including the Isles of Scilly. Granite tors form important elements in the landscape in these areas. Metamorphism of the country rocks and hydrothermal circulation of metal-rich fluids in the cooling rock provided the source of the extensive [...] deposits of the region (primarily copper and tin). Later weathering of the granite led to deposits of kaolin which has been excavated as it is an important source of china clay and <b>ball</b> <b>clay</b> used in the production of such products as porcelain and shiny printing paper.|$|E

40|$|As the {{production}} of ceramic porcelain stoneware in Spain is totally conditioned by the importation of <b>ball</b> <b>clays,</b> {{because of the lack}} of adequate Spanish <b>ball</b> <b>clays,</b> this work has focused on the formulation of ceramic porcelain body from Spanish clays purified by means of physical removal processes. This method was applied to three Spanish clays containing common clay impurities of iron (hematite and siderite) and organic matter. Iron removal was carried out using the wet sieve method, the hydrocycloning method and the electromagnetic filtering method, obtaining a reduction in iron content of up to 80 wt%, while the clay containing organic matter was treated thermally at 400 °C for 30 min so as to leave it almost completely purified. These treated clays, after being characterized (chemical and mineralogical composition, plasticity, organic carbon, thermal behaviour and colour), were used in the porcelain stoneware body composition instead of imported clays, the result being a composition capable of substituting the standard porcelain stoneware formulation in terms of sintering, morphology, colour, flexural strength and dilatometry...|$|R
40|$|<b>Clay</b> <b>balls</b> {{can be used}} as {{alternatives}} to natural pebbles in pebble matrix filtration, a device for drinking water treatment. These <b>clay</b> <b>balls</b> are subjected to stresses due to self-weight and overburden in water saturated conditions. Although there are empirical relationships for evaluating tensile yield strength (Ts) of <b>clay</b> <b>balls</b> using Poisson’s ratio (µ), diameter (d) of <b>clay</b> <b>balls,</b> and failure polar force (Fs), so far for such calculations the value of Poisson’s ratio (µ) was taken from studies based on clay bricks. However, during <b>ball</b> preparation if <b>clay</b> is mixed with other raw materials from industry wastes such as saw dust or alum sludge in order to enhance the pollutant removal properties of the filter media, then the Poisson’s ratio (µ) of composite balls would be quite different to that of clay bricks. This paper describes a novel method for estimating Poisson’s ratio (µ) of composite <b>clay</b> <b>balls</b> by measuring vertical deformation using linear variable displacement transducers (LVDTs) in uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) apparatus and lateral deformation using particle image velocimetry (PIV) ...|$|R

50|$|The tidal Whitelake Channel of {{the river}} connects it to two disused short canals that were both built to serve the <b>ball</b> <b>clay</b> trade in the area. The Stover Canal heads to Teigngrace (with the River Teign also {{supplying}} the header pond); it was built to serve <b>ball</b> <b>clay</b> operations, but later it was the terminus of the Haytor Granite Tramway, carrying granite. The second connection was to the Hackney Canal, only 0.6 miles long, that connected the river to a <b>ball</b> <b>clay</b> quarry at Hackney Clay Cellars in Kingsteignton (now {{the site of a}} retail park), through what is now Newton Abbot Racecourse.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Ball</b> <b>clays</b> are kaolinitic {{sedimentary}} clays that commonly {{consist of}} 20-80% kaolinite, 10-25% mica, 6-65% quartz.
