500|$|Many {{critics have}} noted the {{extraordinary}} development of Dylan's songwriting immediately after completing his first album. One of Dylan's biographers Clinton Heylin connects the sudden increase in lyrics written along topical and political lines {{to the fact that}} Dylan had moved into an apartment on West 4th Street with his girlfriend Suze Rotolo in January 1962. Rotolo's family had strong left-wing political commitments; both of her parents were members of the American Communist Party. Dylan acknowledged her influence when he told an interviewer: [...] "Suze was into this equality-freedom thing long <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>was.</b> I checked out the songs with her." ...|$|E
500|$|In September 1940 Le Mesurier's rented {{home was}} hit by a German bomb, {{destroying}} all his possessions, including his call-up papers. In the same bombing raid, the theatre in Brixton in which he was working was also hit. A few days later he reported for basic training with the Royal Armoured Corps; in June 1941 he was commissioned into the Royal Tank Regiment. He served in Britain until 1943 when he was posted to British India where he {{spent the rest of the}} war. Le Mesurier later claimed that he had had [...] "a comfortable war, with captaincy thrust upon me, <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> demobbed in 1946".|$|E

500|$|In May 1851, {{while in}} Boston {{attending}} the New England Anti-Slavery Society’s annual meeting, Stone {{went to the}} exhibit of Hiram Powers’s statue The Greek Slave. She was so moved by the sculpture that when she addressed the meeting that evening, she poured out her heart about the statue being emblematic of all enchained womanhood. Stone said the society’s general agent, Samuel May, Jr., reproached her for speaking on women’s rights at an antislavery meeting, and she replied, “I was a woman <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> an abolitionist. I must speak for women.” Three months later, Stone notified May that she intended to lecture on women’s rights full-time {{and would not be}} available for antislavery work.|$|E
500|$|Minaj {{is known}} for her {{animated}} rapping style, her flow in particular. She often combines metaphors, punch lines and word play into her work, which {{has been compared to}} her mentor Lil Wayne. The New York Times called Minaj [...] "a sparkling rapper with a gift for comic accents and unexpected turns of phrase. She's a walking exaggeration, outsize in sound, personality and look. And she's a rapid evolver, discarding old modes as easily as adopting new ones." [...] Although many critics describe her technique as bubblegum rap, Minaj said: [...] "What people don't know is that <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> doing that craziness I was doing me, I was just doing regular sounding rap that anyone could hear and identify with. But once I started doing all that weird shit—I'm not mad at it because it got everyone's attention." ...|$|E
500|$|Madonna's {{version of}} the song begins {{with the sound of}} {{acoustic}} guitars and synth strings. Madonna's voice sounds high-pitched, eluding the deeper resonance of the tune. After the first verse, Tony Thompson starts playing the drums, which moves along the rhythm of the song. Towards the end, Madonna sings the song like a soul singer and the song ends with a gasp of breath. The song was recorded at Power Station Studio in Manhattan, New York. Rodgers recalled: [...] "Madonna had never performed with a live orchestra <b>before.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> very much into doing everything live, so I just said, 'Madonna, you go out there and sing and we will follow you.' At first Madonna was hesitant, but the live setting ended up producing memorable results. She sang and she was overcome with emotions and she started crying, but I left it on the record." ...|$|E

[...] "I didn't sleep much", Youkilis said. [...] "I got about four hours of sleep. ... They told me the night <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> playing.... I got in there, and man, I was just amped up and excited." [...] During his first major-league game in Toronto, with his parents watching from the second row behind the dugout, Youkilis (in his second at bat) homered against 1996 Cy Young Award winner Pat Hentgen, becoming just the seventh player in team history to hit a home run in his first game. As a prank, the team initially gave Youkilis the silent treatment {{when he returned to the}} dugout after his homer. [...] "This one will go down probably as the greatest day of my life", he said.|$|E
500|$|In [...] "Over and Over", Madonna sings about {{determination}} and picking yourself up from disappointments. The song consists of instrumentation from drums, synths {{and has a}} three-chord progression. An emotional moment occurred in the recording studio when Madonna covered the 1978 Rose Royce song [...] "Love Don't Live Here Anymore". Rodgers recalled: [...] "Madonna had never performed with a live orchestra <b>before.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> very much into doing everything live, so I just said, 'Madonna, {{you go out there}} and sing and we will follow you.' At first Madonna was hesitant, but the live setting ended up producing memorable results. She sang and she was overcome with emotions and she started crying, but I left it on the record." [...] The song features Madonna's vocals supported by acoustic guitars and synth strings, with Thompson playing the drum in the second verse. Towards the end, Madonna emotes in the voice of a soul singer.|$|E
500|$|... "Danke Schoen" [...] {{is one of}} the {{recurring}} motifs in the film and is sung by Ferris, Ed Rooney, and Jeanie. Hughes called it the [...] "most awful song of my youth. Every time it came on, I just wanted to scream, claw my face. I was taking German in high school—which meant that we listened to it in school. I couldn't get away from it." [...] According to Broderick, Ferris's singing [...] "Danke Schoen" [...] in the shower was his idea. [...] "Although it's only because of the brilliance of John's deciding that I should sing [...] "Danke Schoen" [...] on the float in the parade. I had never heard the song <b>before.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> learning it for the parade scene. So we're doing the shower scene and I thought, 'Well, I can do a little rehearsal.' And I did something with my hair to make that Mohawk. And you know what good directors do: they say, 'Stop! Wait till we roll.' And John put that stuff in." ...|$|E

500|$|Details {{of a film}} {{examining}} Hitchcock's {{obsession with}} Hedren were reported in December 2011. The Girl, written by Gwyneth Hughes, would star Toby Jones as Hitchcock and Sienna Miller as Hedren. In a post-production BBC press release about the film in November 2012, Hughes described her enthusiasm when she was approached about the project while on holiday: [...] " [...] {{got a phone call}} from producer Amanda Jenks. She only managed to get out the words 'Alfred Hitchcock and Tippi Hedren' <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> already shouting 'yes yes yes!' to this seductive, sinister, deeply touching story of love and obsession among Hollywood royalty." [...] Hughes interviewed Hedren and members of Hitchcock's crew before preparing a script. She described her discussions with Hedren: [...] "Her wisdom and insights have helped me to put her real life ordeal on to the screen. I know Tippi is absolutely thrilled, as I am, with the casting of Sienna Miller to play her." [...] The film's title was inspired by the name Hitchcock used for Hedren after she stopped working for him.|$|E
500|$|Anna Rosmus {{received}} the 1994 award, {{in honor of}} work related to her research on the Nazi past of her hometown in Bavaria. [...] Rosmus researched anti-Semitism, and opposed neo-Nazis and the extreme right in Germany. [...] She also located and published artwork of Jews that had once lived {{in her hometown of}} Passau, Germany. [...] As a result of her work, Rosmus endured threats against her life. In a 1996 Yom HaShoah ceremony, Rosmus recounted threats she faced after conducting her research: [...] "Once-friendly neighbors threatened me openly - on the telephone, in person, in letters ... They threatened to kill me and kidnap my children. Some even attacked me physically, a room where I was to speak in Munich was bombed just <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> to be there, and several times I was sued. Nobody ever claimed I had said anything false or made mistakes. They just claimed all this would damage their reputations." [...] Rosmus was profiled on 60 Minutes, and her story was the subject of the 1990 West German drama film, The Nasty Girl. Rosmus was presented with the Conscience-in-Media Award in a special ceremony at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.|$|E
500|$|The young Stanford {{was given}} a {{conventional}} education at a private day school in Dublin run by Henry Tilney Bassett, who concentrated on the classics {{to the exclusion of}} other subjects. Stanford's parents encouraged the boy's precocious musical talent, employing a succession of teachers in violin, piano, organ and composition. Three of his teachers were former pupils of Ignaz Moscheles, including his godmother Elizabeth Meeke, of whom Stanford recalled, [...] "She taught me, <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> twelve years old, to read at sight. ... She made me play every day {{at the end of my}} lesson a Mazurka of Chopin: never letting me stop for a mistake. ... By the time I had played through the whole fifty-two Mazurkas, I could read most music of the calibre my fingers could tackle with comparative ease." [...] One of the young Stanford's earliest compositions, a march in D major, written when he was eight years old, was performed in the pantomime at the Theatre Royal, Dublin three years later. At the age of seven, Stanford gave a piano recital for an invited audience, playing works by Beethoven, Handel, Mendelssohn, Moscheles, Mozart and Bach. One of his songs was taken up by the University of Dublin Choral Society and was well received.|$|E

Aware that this would result in his expulsion from Labour, he publicly stated that [...] "I have been forced to choose between the party I love and upholding the democratic rights of Londoners." [...] The polls indicated clear support for Livingstone among the London electorate, with his campaign being run by his Socialist Action associates. He gained the support {{of a wide range of}} celebrities, from musicians like Fatboy Slim, Pink Floyd, the Chemical Brothers, and Blur, artists like Damian Hirst and Tracey Emin, and those from other fields, among them Ken Loach, Jo Brand, and Chris Evans, the latter of whom donated £200,000 to the campaign; half of what Livingstone required. In March 2000, Livingstone agreed to make a public apology to the House of Commons, after he was criticised over his failure to properly register outside interests worth more than £150,000. The election took place in May 2000, at which Livingstone came first with 58% of first and second-preference votes; Conservative candidate Steven Norris came second and Dobson third.

500|$|Brown's {{trial began}} in Naha on May 26 with {{testimony}} from V. N.. Over {{the next three}} days of testimony, V. N. repeatedly stated that Brown was innocent and that she wanted to withdraw her complaint. She said that any contact between her and Brown on the night in question was consensual and that she allowed Brown to fondle and kiss her breasts. At that point, V. N. said, she began to resist and Brown became angry. V. N. testified that when she threatened to call police, Brown threw her cell phone into the [...] river. Angry at the loss of her cell phone, V. N. stated that she then embellished the story when she told it to the guards at the Courtney main gate. V. N. further claimed that she had been coerced by police, prosecutors and her employer, a local agency that provides temporary workers for USMC bases on Okinawa, to file the charges. She said that once the charges were filed, Japanese prosecutors told her she could only withdraw the charges in court. One of the Naha judges then asked V. N. why she was not angry at Brown to which V. N. replied, [...] "Because he didn't attempt to rape me. <b>Before,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> angry at him for throwing away my cell phone.

500|$|Publishers such as Ubisoft, Electronic Arts, Capcom, and Majesco Entertainment {{continued}} to release exclusive titles for the console, but the Wii's strongest titles remained within its first-party line-up.

Goichi Suda, developer of No More Heroes for the Wii, noted that [...] "only Nintendo titles are doing well.

[...] Conversely, the PAL publisher of No More Heroes Rising Star Games were greatly impressed with the game's sales. Goichi Suda later retracted his comment, saying his [...] "point was that No More Heroes, unlike a lot of Nintendo Wii titles currently available is the kind of product that will attract a different kind of consumer to the hardware, i.e. gamers who are looking for a different genre to the products that have been successful on this platform thus far." ...|$|E

At a point in the shoot, Spears changed her heels to Ugg boots during the shots that did not show her feet, stating that [...] " [...] hurts ... but it looks good.
