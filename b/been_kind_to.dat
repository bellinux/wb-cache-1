5|$|In 2004, Eve's vengeful, adoptive sister, Liz Sanbourne, discovers Irma's existence, {{and brings}} her to Harmony to destroy Eve's life by {{revealing}} her past to her family. Irma tells them Eve {{was once a}} prostitute and drug addict while living in Boston, and {{was involved in a}} relationship with Julian, who is T.C.'s sworn enemy. The revelations destroy Eve and T.C.'s marriage. Despite her Christian upbringing, Irma is often foul-mouthed; she frequently calls Eve a whore or a slut. When Eve's daughter Simone tells Irma she is a lesbian, Irma, who has previously <b>been</b> <b>kind</b> <b>to</b> her, tells Simone homosexuality is vile and disgusting, and orders her to leave and never return. Irma was portrayed by actress Marla Gibbs on a recurring basis in 2004 and 2005. Gibbs viewed Irma as a malicious character, and was surprised at fans' positive feedback.|$|E

Ingham added that, with the [...] "excellent Volume II" [...] (Best of Dark Horse 1976–1989) no longer in print, The Best of George Harrison was {{therefore}} the artist's only available compilation album and [...] "hardly a satisfying one-stop sampler". Reviewing Let It Roll for the music website Popdose, in 2009, Jon Cummings wrote that [...] "the compilation gods have never <b>been</b> <b>kind</b> <b>to</b> [...] " [...] and described the 1976 album as [...] "downright insulting". In her role as compiler of Let It Roll, Harrison's widow Olivia said of The Best of George Harrison: [...] "That album always bothered me...

He said that [...] "while time hasn't <b>been</b> <b>kind</b> <b>to</b> the best ass-kicking knuckle-draggers, Skin Trade is energetic, and winsome." [...] In his opinion, the movie hails from a [...] "decadent period of action cinema [...] when every renegade cop had a private vendetta, a pet charity/social concern, and a few lousy quips in his back pocket." [...] He summed up his review by saying: [...] "ou can teach a new dog old tricks, though why you would want to is anyone's guess." [...] The Action Elite's Eoin Friel also enjoyed the film; he awarded four out of five stars, and praised the choreography, stunts and fight scenes. Unlike Schager or Vishnevetsky, Friel had no issues with Jaa's fluency in English, and even felt he [...] "handled English pretty well".|$|E
500|$|D'Souza {{is deeply}} {{religious}} and says that, she regularly attends Sunday Mass at St. Anne's Parish (Bandra), and whenever {{the family is}} home, {{a part of their}} evening is reserved for saying the rosary together. In an interview with The Times of India, she comments, [...] "I keep a Novena every Wednesday at St. Michael's Church in Mahim." [...] In an interview with Daily News and Analysis, she said that [...] "My communication with God is conversational, [...] I'm God's favourite child; I believe that God has always <b>been</b> <b>kind</b> <b>to</b> me." [...] Her mother tongue is Konkani. Tabloids repeatedly linked D'Souza romantically with Ritesh Deshmukh, ever since they starred together in their debut film Tujhe Meri Kasam in 2003. They were reportedly ready to get engaged, but Ritesh's father, the then-Maharashtra Chief Minister, Vilasrao Deshmukh did not agree. D'Souza later denied any rumors of a relationship with Deshmukh, and responds that she had just friendly relations with him. However, the couple eventually got married on 3 February 2012, according to Marathi marriage traditions in a Hindu wedding ceremony. She got married in a Roman Catholic ceremony in Bandra, the following day. The couple's first child, a son named Riaan, was born on 25 November 2014. Their second son was born on 1 June 2016.|$|E
500|$|Historians {{have not}} <b>been</b> <b>kind</b> <b>to</b> Gebhard. E.A. Benians, in the Cambridge Modern History, {{was perhaps the}} most generous: [...] "Few men {{personally}} insignificant have made more stir in the world." [...] Walter Goetz described him in less complimentary terms: he [...] "was impelled by no great idea, nor could he claim through virile activity the title to any high striving ambition" [...] and was [...] "wanting in both depth and tenacity". [...] Goetz was not particularly kind to Ernst either: [...] Ernst was not Gebhard's superior; the victory that placed him in the Electorate belonged to his brothers' influence and to that of the Curia (papacy), not to his own striving ambition; Ernst was, fundamentally, riding on the Counter Reformation tide that lifted all boats. [...] Philip Motley described Gebhard thus: despite his swearing an oath to renounce his See if he should marry, [...] "the love of Truchsess for Agnes Mansfeld had created disaster, not only for himself but for all of Germany." [...] Like Goetz, he describes both Gebhard and Ernst as cut from the same cloth: [...] "two pauper Archbishops without men or means of their own were pushed back and forth, like puppets, by the highwaymen" [...] on either side, while murder and robbery, in the name of Catholicism and Protestantism, were the [...] "for a time the only motive or result of the contest." ...|$|E

2500|$|Other {{aspects of}} Appa's {{character}} include {{his fear of}} fire and his trusting {{of those who have}} <b>been</b> <b>kind</b> <b>to</b> him. He can become quite temperamental towards anyone who he thinks is a threat to himself or his friends, especially Aang. Conversely, he has demonstrated an unrestrained affection towards those that he likes. Appa also has a fear of going underground or in small tunnels, evidenced by his claustrophobic panic in the episode [...] "The Cave of Two Lovers".|$|E
2500|$|Historical accounts, {{following}} the film's release on DVD, have also <b>been</b> <b>kind</b> <b>to</b> Beban. [...] In 2008, The New York Times praised Beban's [...] "powerful lead performance" [...] which it described as follows:"The audience {{is drawn to}} identify with Beppo, even though he remains in many respects an appalling ethnic caricature: dark, brooding, vengeful. That Barker [...] and Beban are able to create so much sympathy for Beppo, despite their own, occasionally quite obvious condescension to the character, is a mark of emerging maturity in the movie business; no longer are films dealing in one-dimensional 'types.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Frankfurter was universally {{praised for}} his work {{before coming to the}} Supreme Court, and was {{expected}} to influence it for decades past the death of FDR. [...] However, Frankfurter's influence over other justices was limited by his failure to adapt to new surroundings, his style of personal relations (relying heavily on the use of flattery and ingratiation, which ultimately proved divisive), and his strict adherence to the ideology of judicial restraint. Michael E. Parrish, professor at UCSD, said of Frankfurter: [...] "History has not <b>been</b> <b>kind</b> <b>to</b> ... there is now almost a universal consensus that Frankfurter the justice was a failure, a judge who... became 'uncoupled from the locomotive of history' during the Second World War, and who thereafter left {{little in the way of}} an enduring jurisprudential legacy." ...|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{its early}} {{involvement}} and important role, the Manhattan Project had not <b>been</b> <b>kind</b> <b>to</b> Columbia.

After the war, scientists there {{had access to the}} research reactors at the government-sponsored Argonne National Laboratory, and Fermi and Urey were lured away to Chicago. When the war ended in August 1945, the Physics Department at Columbia had five vacant chairs. Filling them would be no easy task. Physicists were hailed as heroes, and every major university was eager to recruit the best ones to build up their departments. They were offered high salaries, and when they left they often took their students and post-doctoral assistants with them. Even the quintessential New Yorker Rabi was tempted to leave rather than return to Columbia from his wartime work at the MIT Radiation Laboratory. He offered to stay, but one condition: ...|$|E
2500|$|On October 14, 1814, McDonald {{died in a}} {{military}} hospital in Batavia, New York from health complications caused by a [...] "very long and trying" [...] forced march. McDonald's final messages along with his belongings, which included his sword and sash, were delivered {{to his mother and}} children at [...] "Glengarry" [...] by his colleague and friend, Colonel John Strother, who had been present at McDonald's death. The McDonald family was very grateful to Strother for his actions and the two families remained close. Fifty years later, during the American Civil War, McDonald's son Colonel Angus William McDonald interceded on Strother's behalf when he was arrested by McDonald's Confederate squad for treason in August 1861. McDonald said of Strother, [...] "he had <b>been</b> <b>kind</b> <b>to</b> my father, was his fellow soldier, tended him on his death-bed and was kind to me as his son.

2500|$|Hannah Cowley had a less-distinguished {{career as}} a poet, writing [...] "The Scottish Village, or Pitcairne Green" [...] in 1786, and [...] "The Siege of Acre: an Epic Poem” in 1801. In the summer of 1787, under the nom de plume [...] "Anna Matilda," [...] she and poet Robert Merry (writing under the name [...] "Della Crusca") began a poetic {{correspondence}} {{in the pages of}} the journal The World. Their poems were sentimental and flirtatious. At first the two did not even know the others' identity; later they met and became part of a poetic movement called the Della Cruscans. Literary history has not <b>been</b> <b>kind</b> <b>to</b> Della Cruscan poetry, which was criticised as sloppy and emotional. Merry was the subject of a satirical poem, [...] "The Baviad", written by a contemporary, William Gifford.

2500|$|The {{official}} campaign {{began on}} 19 November as the country's electoral commission announced the 12 candidates eligible to run. Andrija Hebrang collected more signatures {{than any other}} candidate with over 140,000, Ivo Josipović was second with just under 120,000, Milan Bandić collected around 60,000, Vesna Pusić just under 50,000, while Dragan Primorac and Nadan Vidošević each collected over 30,000 signatures. [...] At {{the beginning of the}} campaign, most polls showed Josipović with a healthy lead over his opponents. Although Hebrang held the second spot in most opinion polls during the summer, he fell to as low as fifth place by November. He claimed opinion polls have never <b>been</b> <b>kind</b> <b>to</b> his party as most conservative voters refuse to participate in them and expressed conviction that come Election Day he will be the victor. Despite Bandić's indecisiveness, he held second or third place in most polls during autumn. After he officially announced his campaign, most political observers expected him to get a bump in the polls, however that never materialized. After announcing his candidacy he continuously dropped in the polls, but still managed to claim second or third place. Nadan Vidošević led most polls during 2008 and early 2009, but never managed to take the lead after officially becoming a candidate.|$|E
2500|$|Lewis {{played the}} Grand Ole Opry {{for the first}} time on January 20, 1973. [...] As Colin Escott writes in the liner notes to A Half Century of Hits, Lewis had always {{maintained}} ambivalent feelings towards Music City ever since he'd been turned away as an aspiring musician before his glory days at Sun Records: [...] "It was 18 years since he had left Nashville broke and disheartened...Lewis was never truly accepted in Nashville. [...] He didn't move there and didn't schmooze there. He didn't fit in with the family values crowd. Lewis family values weren't necessarily worse, but they were different." [...] When Lewis finally took the stage, he broke just about every rule the Opry had. [...] As recounted in a 2015 online Rolling Stone article by Beville Dunkerly, Lewis opened with his comeback single [...] "Another Place, Another Time" [...] and then announced to the audience, [...] "Let me tell ya something about Jerry Lee Lewis, ladies and gentlemen: I am a rock and rollin', country-and-western, rhythm and blues-singin' motherfucker!" [...] Ignoring his allotted time constraints – and, thus, commercial breaks – Lewis played for 40 minutes (the average Opry performance is two songs, for about eight maximum minutes of stage time) and invited Del Wood – the one member of the Opry who had <b>been</b> <b>kind</b> <b>to</b> him when he had been there as a teenager – out on stage to sing with him. [...] He also blasted through [...] "Whole Lotta Shakin' Going On", [...] "Workin' Man Blues", [...] "Good Golly Miss Molly", and a host of others classics before leaving the stage to a thunderous standing ovation.|$|E
2500|$|Believed to {{have been}} written in the 1390s, Chaucer's short poem Fortune, is also {{inferred}} to directly reference Lancaster. [...] "Chaucer as narrator" [...] openly defies Fortune, proclaiming he has learned who his enemies are through her tyranny and deceit, and declares [...] "my suffisaunce" [...] (15) and that [...] "over himself hath the maystrye" [...] (14). [...] Fortune, in turn, does not understand Chaucer's harsh words to her for she believes she has <b>been</b> <b>kind</b> <b>to</b> him, claims {{that he does not}} know what she has in store for him in the future, but most importantly, [...] "And eek thou hast thy beste frend alyve" [...] (32, 40, 48). [...] Chaucer retorts that [...] "My frend maystow nat reven, blind goddesse" [...] (50) and orders her to take away those who merely pretend to be his friends. [...] Fortune turns her attention to three princes whom she implores to relieve Chaucer of his pain and [...] "Preyeth his beste frend of his noblesse/That to som beter estat he may atteyne" [...] (78–79). [...] The three princes are believed to represent the dukes of Lancaster, York, and Gloucester, and a portion of line 76, [...] "as three of you or tweyne," [...] to refer to the ordinance of 1390 which specified that no royal gift could be authorised without the consent of {{at least two of the}} three dukes. Most conspicuous in this short poem is the number of references to Chaucer's [...] "beste frend". [...] Fortune states three times in her response to the plaintiff, [...] "And also, you still have your best friend alive" [...] (32, 40, 48); she also references his [...] "beste frend" [...] in the envoy when appealing to his [...] "noblesse" [...] to help Chaucer to a higher estate. [...] A fifth reference is made by [...] "Chaucer as narrator" [...] who rails at Fortune that she shall not take his friend from him. [...] While the envoy playfully hints to Lancaster that Chaucer would certainly appreciate a boost to his status or income, the poem Fortune distinctively shows his deep appreciation and affection for John of Gaunt.|$|E
