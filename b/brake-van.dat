60|$|MRS. BATHURST The {{day that}} I chose to visit H.M.S. Peridot in Simon's Bay {{was the day}} that the Admiral had chosen to send her up the coast. She was just {{steaming}} out to sea as my train came in, and since the rest of the Fleet were either coaling or busy at the rifle-ranges a thousand feet up the hill, I found myself stranded, lunchless, on the sea-front with no hope of return to Cape Town before five P.M. At this crisis I had the luck to come across my friend Inspector Hooper, Cape Government Railways, in command of an engine and a <b>brake-van</b> chalked for repair.|$|E
6000|$|April 22nd {{convinced}} us that, even {{in these}} prosaic regions, our misadventures and accidents had not reached their fated end. A special train had been organized by Hanafi Effendi for eight a.m. About ten miles from Suez one of the third-class carriages began [...] "running hot;" [...] and, before we could dismount, the axle-box of a truck became a young Vesuvius {{in the matter of}} vomiting smoke. I ordered the driver, who was driving furiously, to make half speed; but even with this precaution there were sundry stoppages; and at the Naffíshah station, where my Bolognese acquaintances still throve, we could not be supplied with a change of [...] "rolling-stock." [...] About Tell el-Kabír, the <b>brake-van</b> also waxed unsafely warm; but it reached Zagázig without developing more caloric. Briefly, we caught fire three times in one morning.|$|E
50|$|The railway {{line from}} Durban to Isipingo was {{extended}} to Park Rynie from 1896 onwards, and the first train passed through Amanzimtoti in 1897. This train left Durban on 22 February at 07h55 and consisted of a Dubs-type engine with two goods trucks, two passenger trucks and a <b>brake-van.</b> There was a tin shanty siding at Amanzimtoti in 1897 which served as a station. The route from the Amanzimtoti train station to Adams Mission was named Adams Road. The first hotel in Amanzimtoti was built in 1898 to cater for holidaymakers, some of whom came from as far afield as Johannesburg on specially organised trains. The first hotel was built of wood and iron, but burnt down in May 1899. Amanzimtoti had its first stationmaster in 1902.|$|E
50|$|As {{the lengthy}} train ran through Wigan North Western station the driver glanced {{back and saw}} sparks flying {{to the rear of}} the train. After drawing to a halt he walked back to find an appalling sight at the south end of the down platform. The first 15 {{carriages}} of the fast-moving train had passed safely through the station, but two wheels of the 16th coach had derailed at a set of facing points. Next came a luggage van which derailed completely, demolishing a lineside shunter's cabin and losing its side in the process. The couplings held on both these two vehicles and they travelled the length of the platform and were rerailed by a crossing at the north end. However the following carriages were not so fortunate and had all been derailed on the points, had broken away from the train and lay in shattered confusion at the start of the platform and on the passing loop behind it, leaving 13 dead and 30 injured. Only the last coach and rear <b>brake-van</b> were undamaged. The front portion of the train continued to Scotland 90 minutes later.|$|E
50|$|With the {{re-opening}} of the colliery at Dudley in 1896, the Redhead Coal Company {{approached the}} Railway Commissioners with a request that a passenger service be operated {{on the line}} between Adamstown and Dudley {{for the convenience of}} employees at both the Burwood and Dudley Collieries. The Commissioners agreed, and in January 1897 a through twice daily train service was commenced between Newcastle and Dudley, calling at Hamilton, Adamstown, Kahibah, and Burwood Colliery en route. For the convenience of employees and others who used this train service, small raised platforms were erected at Kahibah, Burwood and Dudley, and all trains stopped regularly at these places to pick up and set down passengers. The Kahibah platform was situated 2 mi from Adamstown, Burwood platform (which served the Burwood Colliery and later as a transfer station to persons travelling to and from the Redhead line) was 5 mi from Adamstown, and Dudley was about 1/4 mi short of the colliery. Dudley platform was opened on 14 January 1900, all the other platforms were opened with the commencement of the passenger service. The trains left Newcastle daily (Sundays excepted) at 5.55 a.m., and 1.55 p.m., returning from Dudley on the same days at 3.20, and 11.20 p.m., the time of journey between Newcastle and Dudley being 40 minutes. These trains were worked usually by an E17 class engine hauling either six or eight 4-wheel and 6-wheel old time carriages, and a <b>brake-van.</b>|$|E
