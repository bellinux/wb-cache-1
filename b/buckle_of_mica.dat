Aramid fiber can act as skeleton and improve the dielectric strength <b>of</b> <b>mica</b> paper greatly accordingly at the optimum dosages of aramid fiber, 4 %. When 3 % of PVA fibers were added the tensile strength <b>of</b> <b>mica</b> paper increased significantly. It is because PVA fibers can smelt and act as bond for mica flake and aramid fiber under high temperature. The optimum beating degree of aramid fiber was 35 oSR, and the optimum drying temperature was 100 ℃?. Compared with traditional mica paper, dielectric strength <b>of</b> composite <b>mica</b> paper with aramid fiber and PVA fiber increased above 25 % and tensile strength increased 2. 30 times under this optimum condition.

40|$|The thesis {{presents}} {{series of}} laboratory studies <b>of</b> aggregates containing <b>mica</b> minerals obtained from aggregate producers located throughout Sweden. The main {{idea of the}} research was to study physical properties and behaviour <b>of</b> free <b>mica</b> particles in unbound granular products of crushed rock materials. Another objective was to highlight the detrimental properties <b>of</b> <b>mica</b> occurrence in aggregates used for road construction industry and determine the applicable methods for quantitative determination <b>of</b> <b>mica</b> minerals presence. Due {{to the lack of}} previous investigations looking at this or similar subject, the current research can have international importance, especially for countries with crystalline, mica rich bedrock and temperate, subarctic climates. Recently a number of cases involving road construction failures and decrease in service life have been observed in northern parts of Sweden. One of the major reasons for the structural deterioration was enrichment <b>of</b> free <b>mica</b> particles in aggregates and their interaction with water. Due to this reason first paper of this thesis represents a study of the behaviour <b>of</b> free <b>mica</b> grains in crushed rock aggregates of metamorphic origin and recognition of any trend of enrichment <b>of</b> free <b>mica</b> grains aggregates. As a result two general trends <b>of</b> enrichment <b>of</b> <b>mica</b> were obtained: Type I (isotropic source rock) and Type A (anisotropic source rock). Type I is exemplified by a general increase <b>of</b> free <b>mica</b> towards finer grain fractions, with or without a peak for "coarser" grain fractions. Type A represents an increase <b>of</b> free <b>mica</b> up to a certain grain fraction, thereafter no increase occurs towards finer grain fractions. Second part of the thesis focuses on the determination of the possible analytical methods which are susceptible to mica content and could be used as indicating technique for quantitative determination <b>of</b> free <b>mica</b> particles in unbound granular materials. Two standard methods: Sand equivalent test and Methylene blue test were assumed as the most sensitive to mica presence. Both methods showed susceptibility to mica content and gave strong correlation in terms <b>of</b> <b>mica</b> content. The third paper enhances knowledge of the behaviour <b>of</b> <b>mica</b> rich aggregates in interaction with water in terms of fraction sizes and free mica content. During the experiment several aggregates with different content <b>of</b> free <b>mica</b> and pure <b>mica</b> material consisting <b>of</b> commercial biotite were studied. Two major parameters were investigated during the research: water storage capacity and specific water saturation value. With the aid of consecutive analytical and statistical analyses a more precise mica presence threshold value for certain unbound applications was indicated, resulting in recommendations for industry, authorities and for future experiments.

Methods: We obtained data on 222 patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer, including data on MICA expression, age, gender, ECOG score, pathological type, stage, treatment history (including 38 patients who were given autologous CIK cell infusion), and overall survival (OS). MICA expression in lung cancer tissue was evaluated by immunohistochemical staining. Analyses <b>of</b> <b>MICA</b> expression, and CIK therapy association with survival outcomes were performed using Cox proportional models, Kaplan-Meier methods, and the log-rank test. Result: s MICA was expressed in both membrane and cytoplasm. MICA expression correlated with the stage of lung cancer, ECOG score, gender and age. Multivariate COX regression analysis showed that the expression <b>of</b> <b>MICA</b> was an independent prognostic factor of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (p = 0. 002).
