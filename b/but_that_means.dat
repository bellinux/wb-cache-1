It was better than kissing her, {{it was better than}} anything." [...] He recalled one of the times they held hands:I remember we went to this club, and I don't go to clubs, which was called the Roxy. And I was watching the band, I was sitting there, and underneath the table, she was holding my hand, and I was, like melting. [...] Fireworks going off.

500|$|The {{play has}} {{received}} modest reviews. Julian Hall of The Independent criticized {{it for a}} lack of inside stories about The Simpsons, writing that [...] "Cartwright never allows you to become bored <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>means</b> some issues are skirted over faster than American closing credits on television. You never really get a feel what it is like recording the show." [...] Brian Logan of The Guardian described Cartwright as [...] "a lively host [...] eager to please", but found the play to be [...] "an overweeningly upbeat collection of Simpsons chitchat." [...] David Chatterton of British Theatre Guide described it as [...] "interesting and entertaining, but not really a 'must see' even for Simpsons fans." [...] Clive Davis of The Times wrote that [...] "In contrast to The Simpsons itself, where not a line, not a syllable, goes to waste, Cartwright has a habit of losing herself in anecdotes that stumble into dead-ends. [...] The half-hearted trivia quiz involving volunteers from the audience soon dies a death too. The performance really cries out for a hard-headed director. The video clips of Cartwright at large are fun, however." ...|$|E
2500|$|Loyalties to the {{two teams}} divided friends, families, and co-workers, and shaped the locals in various ways, as George Will noted in a 1998 {{commencement}} address at Washington University in St. Louis: [...] "I grew up in Champaign, Illinois, midway between Chicago and St. Louis. At an age too tender for life-shaping decisions, I made one. While all my friends were becoming Cardinals fans, I became a Cub fan. My friends, happily rooting for Stan Musial, Red Schoendienst, and other great Redbirds, grew up cheerfully convinced {{that the world is}} a benign place, so of course, they became liberals. Rooting for the Cubs in the late 1940s and early 1950s, I became gloomy, pessimistic, morose, dyspeptic and conservative. It helped out of course that the Cubs last won the World Series in 1908, which is two years before Mark Twain and Tolstoy died. <b>But</b> <b>that</b> <b>means,</b> class of 1998, that the Cubs are in the 89th year of their rebuilding effort, and remember, any team can have a bad moment." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Gasparilla Festival {{came into}} {{existence}} in 1904. Miss Louise Parker, the society editor for the Tampa Tribune needed an exciting theme for the city's May Day celebration and the legend of Jose Gaspar fit the bill. Over the years rumors have circulated that Jose Gaspar was not indeed an actual person, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>means</b> little to the Tampa community. Tampa historian Karl Grismer counters criticisms of the factuality of Jose Gaspar (AKA Gasparilla) {{with the statement that}} the doubters have [...] "no romance in their souls." [...] Marcel d'Ans argues that perhaps Gasparilla's most successful invasion is the one he has made into the memory of Tampans, becoming in their mind [...] "the main cultural identity factor" [...] while the historical truth of Gasparilla lies in the existence of the legend and its celebration. Fact or Fiction, Tampans have celebrated the invasion of Jose Gaspar with enthusiasm for over a century. Gasparilla had a bit of a rocky start and was, at first, attached to other community events. The inaugural invasion in 1904 was part of the city's May Day celebration and in 1905 and 1906 was tied to the Florida State Fair. Interest in the festival fizzled a bit between 1906 and 1910, but the completion of the Panama Canal gave Tampans a good reason for reviving the pirate festival. Rosanna Ensley argues that the 1910 Gasparilla Festival was a celebration of American Imperialism and community growth, but that the festival always [...] "featured piracy as its organizational theme." [...] For the 1916 celebration Ye Mystic Krewe of Gasparilla managed to borrow a [...] "pirate ship" [...] and thus began the tradition of invading Tampa through the harbor rather than on horseback. The festival is a reflection of civic and national events that have shaped the Tampa Bay area and therefore was put on hiatus during both World Wars. However, in 1947 the city resumes the festival and for the first time, the concept goes national with the Gasparilla Queen Dolly Sutton Robson participating in the Memphis Cotton Carnival. By 1974 the pirate identity and Jose Gaspar were so ingrained into Tampa's civic identity that the only logical name for the new NFL franchise was Buccaneers.|$|E

6000|$|The young ospreys flew {{heavily in}} short {{irregular}} circles, scanning {{the water with}} their inexperienced eyes for their first strike. Over them wheeled the mother bird on broad, even wings, whistling directions to the young neophytes, who would presently be initiated into the old sweet mysteries of going a-fishing. Fish were plenty enough; <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>means</b> nothing to a fishhawk, who must see his game reasonably near the surface before making his swoop. There was a good jump on the lake, and the sun shone brightly into it. Between the glare and the motion on the surface the young fishermen were {{having a hard time}} of it. Their eyes were not yet quick enough to tell them when to swoop. At every gleam of silver in the depths below they would stop short and cry out: Pip! [...] "there he is!" [...] Pip, pip! [...] "here goes!" [...] like a boy with his first nibble. But a short, clear whistle from the mother stopped them ere they had begun to fall; and they would flap up to her, protesting eagerly that they could catch that fellow, sure, if she would only let them try.|$|E
6000|$|The Eugenists get {{the ear of}} {{the humane}} but rather hazy cliques {{by saying that the}} present [...] "conditions" [...] under which people work and breed are bad for the race; but the modern mind will not {{generally}} stretch beyond one step of reasoning, and the consequence which appears to follow on the consideration of these [...] "conditions" [...] is by no means what would originally have been expected. If somebody says: [...] "A rickety cradle may mean a rickety baby," [...] the natural deduction, one would think, would be to give the people a good cradle, or give them money enough to buy one. <b>But</b> <b>that</b> <b>means</b> higher wages and greater equalisation of wealth; and the plutocratic scientist, with a slightly troubled expression, turns his eyes and pince-nez in another direction. Reduced to brutal terms of truth, his difficulty is this and simply this: More food, leisure, and money for the workman would mean a better workman, better even {{from the point of view}} of anyone for whom he worked. But more food, leisure, and money would also mean a more independent workman. A house with a decent fire and a full pantry would be a better house to make a chair or mend a clock in, even from the customer's point of view, than a hovel with a leaky roof and a cold hearth. But a house with a decent fire and a full pantry would also be a better house in which to refuse to make a chair or mend a clock--a much better house to do nothing in--and doing nothing is sometimes one of the highest of the duties of man. All but the hard-hearted must be torn with pity for this pathetic dilemma of the rich man, who has to keep the poor man just stout enough to do the work and just thin enough to have to do it. As he stood gazing at the leaky roof and the rickety cradle in a pensive manner, there one day came into his mind a new and curious idea--one of the most strange, simple, and horrible ideas that have ever risen from the deep pit of original sin.|$|E
6000|$|Again, Mr. Fynney, in {{his report}} of his visit to Zululand in 1877, states that though the king and his [...] "indunas" [...] (councillors) denied that men were killed without trial, the people told a very {{different}} tale. Thus he says, [...] "In every instance, where I had so far gained {{the confidence of the}} Zulus as to cause them to speak freely, was I assured of the truthfulness of the statement that the king, Cetywayo, caused his people to be put to death in great numbers; and when I remarked that of course he did so after a fair and proper trial, in some cases my remark was greeted with a suppressed laugh or a smile. Some remarked, 'Yes, a trial of bullets;' others, 'Yes, we get a trial, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>means</b> surrounding the kraal at daybreak and shooting us down like cattle.' One asked me what the Government in Natal intended doing, or what was thought in Natal about the killing, saying, 'It was not in the night that Sompseu spoke, but in the sunshine; the king was not alone, but his people were around him, and the ears of all Zululand heard these words, and the hearts of all Zulus were joyful, and in gladness they lifted up their hands saying: The mouth of our white father has spoken good words; he has cautioned his child in the presence of his people, and a good sun has risen this day over Zululand! How is it now? Has the king listened? Does he hold fast those words? No! not one. The promises he made are all broken. What does Sompseu say to this? You should dine at my kraal yonder for a few days, and see the izizi (cattle and other property {{of people who have been}} killed) pass, and you would then see with your own eyes how a case is tried.'" [...] Farther on Mr. Fynney says, [...] "When a charge is made against a Zulu, the question is generally asked, 'Has he any cattle?' and if answered in the affirmative, there is little chance of escape. Instances of killing occurred while I was in Zululand, and to my knowledge no trial was allowed. An armed party was despatched on the morning I left Ondine, and, as I was informed, to kill." ...|$|E
