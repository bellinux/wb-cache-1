5|$|Upon {{the filing}} of the application, the Court may either make an order immediately, or direct that a summons for the order for review of {{detention}} be issued to enable all the parties involved to present arguments to the Court. If the latter course is taken, the ex parte originating summons, supporting affidavit, order of court and summons must be served on the person against whom the order is sought. Unless the Court directs otherwise, {{it is not necessary}} for the person under restraint to be <b>brought</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> Court for the hearing of the application. In addition, the Court may order that the person be released while the application is being heard. Once the Court decides to make an order for review of detention, it will direct when the person under restraint is to be <b>brought</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> court.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 273 {{disputes}} were <b>brought</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> Constitutional Court, {{the last of}} which were decided on 21 June. Of these cases, 38 decisions affected the final allocation of seats in the People's Representative Council and provincial and regental legislatures. The Democratic Party lost two seats, one to the National Mandate Party and Prosperous Peace Party each. The Pioneers' Party gained one seat from the United Democratic Nationhood Party. Meanwhile, the only seat allocated to the Freedom Bull National Party by the General Election Commission was reassigned to the Reform Star Party.|$|E
5|$|Despite the Government's unequivocal {{view that}} the right to vote is an implied {{constitutional}} right, in Singapore it is the courts that ultimately determine the meaning of the Constitution. Thio Li-ann has suggested that since the right's status {{is not likely to be}} <b>brought</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> courts in a dispute, the Cabinet should refer the matter to the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore Tribunal pursuant to Article 100 of the Constitution for an authoritative opinion.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} 1970s, {{professional}} historians began to reevaluate the force's history. A wider set of themes, including social, {{race and class}} issues, began to be analysed, resulting in more challenging histories of the force being published. Legal challenges <b>brought</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> Canadian courts in the 1980s resulted in the release of archive material about the force's role in the First World War for the first time, generating further new lines of research.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the petition, the council set up a commission that proposed a city synod. For this gathering, Bucer provided a draft document of sixteen articles on church doctrine. The synod convened on 3 June 1533 at the Church of the Penitent Magdalens to debate Bucer's text, eventually accepting it in full. Sectarian leaders were <b>brought</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> synod and questioned by Bucer. Ziegler was dismissed and allowed to stay in Strasbourg; Hoffmann was imprisoned as {{a danger to the}} state; and Schwenckfeld left Strasbourg of his own accord.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} nineteenth century several {{attempts}} were made to erect a monument honoring Jennings's public service. On three separate occasions, in 1861, 1869 and 1889, petitions were <b>brought</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> Indiana General Assembly to erect a marker for Jennings's grave, but each attempt failed. In 1892 the state legislature finally granted the petition to erect a monument in his honor. Around the same time, after Jennings's unmarked gravesite was independently verified by three witnesses to his burial, his body was exhumed and reinterred at a new site at the Charlestown cemetery.|$|E

5|$|Llywelyn's power {{declined}} {{over the}} next two decades. In 1276 Henry's son, Edward I, invaded Wales following a dispute with the prince, breaking his power in South Wales, and in 1282 Edward's second campaign resulted in Llwelyn's death and the collapse of independent Welsh rule. Further defences were added to the walls until work stopped around 1290. Local disputes remained. De Clare argued with Humphrey de Bohun, the earl of Hereford, in 1290 and the following year the case was <b>brought</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> king, resulting in the temporary royal seizure of Caerphilly.|$|E
5|$|O'Neal {{played in}} two more games before the NBA's case was <b>brought</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, New York on December 30. The NBA argued {{that under the}} terms of the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), Stern had {{absolute}} authority to hand out suspensions and hear appeals for all on-court incidents. But the judge ruled that because O'Neal's behavior was an off-court incident, arbitration was allowed under the CBA, and thus the arbitrator was within his rights to reduce the suspension. Despite O'Neal's successful appeal, no further appeals were made to reduce Artest's and Jackson's suspensions.|$|E
5|$|Once {{released}} by the police, Harris and Stephens returned immediately to England, where they arrived on 13 July. The Orsborne brothers waited in Georgetown for their position to be clarified; George Orsborne told the press he was anxious to return home where, he insisted, many job offers were open to him. On 27 June, following further discussions in London, the brothers were arrested on a warrant issued under the Fugitive Offenders Act, and <b>brought</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> Georgetown magistrates, where they were charged with the theft of Girl Pat.|$|E

5|$|The exact terms {{by which}} Libya gained Aouzou remain partly obscure, and are debated. The {{existence}} of a secret agreement between Tombalbaye and Gaddafi was revealed only in 1988, when the Libyan President exhibited an alleged copy of a letter in which Tombalbaye recognizes Libyan claims. Against this, scholars like Bernard Lanne have argued that there never was any sort of formal agreement, and that Tombalbaye had found it expedient {{not to mention the}} occupation of a part of his country. Libya was unable to exhibit the original copy of the agreement when the case of the Aouzou Strip was <b>brought</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> International Court of Justice (ICJ) in 1993.|$|E
5|$|The {{political}} and popular pressure for reform {{had grown so}} great that pro-reform Whigs won an overwhelming House of Commons majority {{in the general election}} of 1831. The Whig party won almost all constituencies with genuine electorates, leaving the Tories with little more than the rotten boroughs. The Reform Bill was again <b>brought</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> House of Commons, which agreed to the second reading by a large majority in July. During the committee stage, opponents of the bill slowed its progress through tedious discussions of its details, but it was finally passed in September, by a margin of more than 100 votes.|$|E
5|$|After many hardships - {{including}} {{being pursued}} by four Indios who try their best to leave them stranded or dead - Tintin, Haddock, and Zorrino reach the Temple of the Sun, finding {{it to be a}} surviving outpost of the Inca civilisation. They are <b>brought</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> Prince of the Sun, flanked by Chiquito and Huascar, the mysterious man Tintin encountered in Jauga. Zorrino is saved from harm when Tintin gives him Huascar's medallion, but Tintin and Haddock are sentenced to death by the Inca prince for their sacrilegious intrusion. The prince tells them they may choose the hour that Pachacamac, the Sun god, will set alight the pyre on which they will be executed.|$|E

5|$|Blessed Lightning, a monk at the monastery, has {{a vision}} of Tintin, Snowy, Haddock, and Tharkey in danger. Tintin regains {{consciousness}} and, too weak to walk, gives Snowy a note to deliver. Snowy runs to the monastery, loses the message, but is recognised as the dog from Blessed Lightning's vision. Tintin, Haddock and Tharkey regain consciousness in the monastery and are <b>brought</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> Grand Abbot. The Abbot tells Tintin to abandon his quest, but Blessed Lightning has another vision, through which Tintin learns that Chang is still alive inside a mountain cave at the Horn of the Yak—and that the Yeti is also there. Tintin and Haddock travel on to the Horn of the Yak.|$|E
5|$|De Iniusta {{states that}} St-Calais was <b>brought</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> king and royal court for trial on 2 November 1088, at Salisbury, the king having confiscated the bishop's lands before the trial. At the trial St-Calais held {{that as a}} bishop {{he could not be}} tried in a secular court, and he refused to answer the accusations. Lanfranc, Archbishop of Canterbury, {{presented}} the king's case, declaring that the confiscated lands had been held as fiefs, and thus St-Calais could be tried as a vassal, not as a bishop. St-Calais objected, and continued to refuse to answer the allegations. After numerous conferences and discussions, the court held that St-Calais could be tried as a vassal in a feudal court. St-Calais then appealed to Rome, but his request was rejected by the king and the judges. Those judging the case held that because St-Calais never answered the formal accusation, and because he appealed to Rome, his fief, or the lands he held as a bishop, was forfeit.|$|E
5|$|Dokeianos re-appears in 1050, when he {{held the}} titles of patrikios and vestarches, {{as part of an}} {{imperial}} expedition against the Pechenegs who raided Thrace. The imperial commander-in-chief, the eunuch praipositos Constantine, a militarily inexperienced court favourite of Emperor Constantine IX (r. 1042–55), listened to his advice on fortifying the army's encampment, but when the Pechenegs appeared before Adrianople, he refused to heed the opinion of the magistros Constantine Arianites to wait and attack the Pechenegs on their return journey, and instead marched to meet them in the open field of Basilike Libas, resulting in a devastating defeat: Arianites fell, while Dokeianos was taken prisoner. As he was <b>brought</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> Pecheneg leader, however, Dokeianos seized a sword from one of his guards and slashed at the leader, cutting off one of his arms, whereupon the enraged Pechenegs killed him and, according to Michael Attaleiates, opened his belly, cut off his arms and legs and placed them in it.|$|E
