5|$|A {{traditional}} {{game called}} kitsune-ken (fox-fist) references the kitsune's powers over human beings. The game {{is similar to}} rock, paper, scissors, but the three hand positions signify a fox, a hunter, and a village headman. The headman <b>beats</b> the hunter, whom he outranks; the hunter <b>beats</b> the fox, whom he shoots; the fox <b>beats</b> the headman, whom he bewitches.|$|E
5|$|The {{story was}} {{originally}} conceived by Jun Maeda, who also wrote the screenplay and composed {{some of the}} music, with original character design by Na-Ga. Both Maeda and Na-Ga are from the visual novel brand Key, and Charlotte is the second original anime series created by Key following Angel <b>Beats!</b> in 2010. Maeda had thought up the concept for Charlotte long before he was approached in early 2012 to work on another anime series after Angel <b>Beats!.</b> Maeda narrowed down the number of main characters compared to Angel <b>Beats!</b> and attempted to put more of a focus on their behavior. Instead of employing the same staff that had worked on Angel <b>Beats!,</b> the aim for Charlotte was to bring together a staff that would add a new variety to the creative process to prevent being influenced by the work done on Angel <b>Beats!.</b>|$|E

5|$|In {{connection}} with his {{background as a}} musician, Lee founded the record label Monster Music in 1999, signing Van Morrison's daughter Shana. Monster created numerous divisions as it diversified into other products, such as Monster Performance Car, Monster Game, Monster Photo and Monster Computer. By 2003, Monster produced more than 1,000 products, including power cords, gaming accessories and cooling products. According to a 2005 USA Today article, Lee and his company were developing furniture with high-end electronics built-in, wireless products to replace audio cords and a user interface to consolidate the consumer's control of their electronics. Lee and his son worked with Dr. Dre to collaborate on the <b>Beats</b> brand of headphones, which was later acquired by Apple for $3 billion in 2014. According to Business Insider, <b>Beats</b> Electronics denies that Monster {{had a role in}} the design of the headphones. Lee said <b>Beats</b> had no engineers on staff and it spent millions in research and development to get the product started, but that their contract was poorly constructed, giving all the intellectual property to <b>Beats</b> when it wasn't renewed.|$|E

5|$|When {{deciding}} on Charlotte staff, Toba {{thought it would}} be better not to have exactly the same team that produced Angel <b>Beats!.</b> Having already decided to stick with Maeda, Na-Ga and P.A.Works, Toba aimed to bring together a staff that would add a new variety to the creative process, and in doing so would prevent being influenced by the work done on Angel <b>Beats!.</b> With that in mind, Toba wanted a director who had a good understanding of Angel <b>Beats!</b> and who would also be suitable as Charlotte director, leading him to seek out Yoshiyuki Asai. Toba took into consideration the storyboarding Asai had done for two episodes of Angel <b>Beats!,</b> and he thought that Charlotte would be a good opportunity to have a first-time series director. Asai was also chosen as someone who could handle both comedic and serious moments. When Horikawa first looked at Charlotte incomplete script, he told Maeda that it did not feel like it had the same kind of zeal that Angel <b>Beats!</b> had. However, once he saw the whole script, his concerns with it were dispelled, much to Maeda's relief.|$|E
