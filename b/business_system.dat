40|$|Globalization tendencies are {{transforming}} {{the nature and}} organization of <b>business</b> <b>systems.</b> This is particularly {{the case in the}} Asia–Pacic region where <b>business</b> <b>systems</b> are socially and institutionally embedded. In this article, I argue that the dialectical tendencies of globalization towards homogenization and differentiation have differential impacts on the cong-urations and dynamics of Asian <b>business</b> <b>systems</b> and their constituents. While these <b>business</b> <b>systems</b> tend to be relatively enduring over time because of their historical legacies and institutional embeddedness, major business rms emerging from these national <b>business</b> <b>systems</b> may be much more susceptible to changes brought about by globalization tenden-cies. This is because actors and elites in Asian economies are increasingly enrolled into global actor networks which in turn reshape how these Asian actors conceive and operate their business rms and/or political-economic networks. It is possible that globalization has only limited effects on Asian <b>business</b> <b>systems</b> at the structural level but signicant transformational impact on Asian business rms at the level of key actors. I show how the two-way enrolment of global actors into/from Asian <b>business</b> <b>systems</b> can contribute to signicant transformations in the dominant forms and organization of these <b>business</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "This report reviews the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) expenditures on <b>business</b> <b>systems</b> modernization. IRS obligated and expended available Information Technology Investment Account (ITIA) appropriations in fiscal years 1999 and 2000 to pay for external <b>business</b> <b>systems</b> modernization costs. In fiscal years 1999 and 2000, IRS expended about $ 12. 8 million and $ 120. 2 million, respectively, of ITIA appropriations and, as of September 30, 2000, had an additional $ 66 million of ITIA appropriations obligated to modernize its external <b>business</b> <b>systems.</b> IRS' use of ITIA appropriations appears to be for no purposes consistent with the fiscal year 1998 and 1999 appropriations acts and within the $ 249 million approved ITIA expenditure plans. IRS used its information systems (IS) appropriations and other appropriations to fund {{both internal and external}} <b>business</b> <b>systems</b> modernization costs. IRS paid its internal <b>business</b> <b>systems</b> modernization costs from its appropriations for IS; Tax Law Enforcement; and Processing, Assistance, and Management. However, the amount of these costs is unknown because IRS did not have a cost accounting system in place to track its internal costs for <b>business</b> <b>systems</b> modernization. IRS initiated actions in fiscal year 2000 to begin tracking its internal costs associated with specific projects through the use of project accounting codes in conjunction with its time and attendance reporting. However, these actions were not fully implemented during GAO's review. In addition, IRS used its IS appropriations to fund some external <b>business</b> <b>systems</b> modernization costs. IRS also expended $ 48. 6 million of IS appropriations to pay for external <b>business</b> <b>systems</b> modernization costs. Also during this period, IRS expended an additional $ 9. 3 million of IS appropriations for both modernization and nonmodernization costs but could not distinguish between the two. There were no instances in which IRS' internal controls failed to assure that expenditures against ITIA appropriations were for <b>business</b> <b>systems</b> modernization. However, GAO recently reported that, despite important progress, IRS has yet to fully implement the capabilities needed to effectively manage the <b>business</b> <b>systems</b> modernization program. In addition, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration reported that internal controls for managing IRS' <b>business</b> <b>systems</b> modernization efforts were inadequate before the <b>Business</b> <b>Systems</b> Modernization Office began operations in July 2000 but have since improved. ...|$|R

The second KKK preached [...] "One Hundred Percent Americanism" [...] and demanded the purification of politics, calling for strict morality and better enforcement of prohibition. Its official rhetoric focused on the threat of the Catholic Church, using anti-Catholicism and nativism. Its appeal was directed exclusively at white Protestants; it opposed Jews, blacks, Catholics, and newly arriving Southern European immigrants such as Italians. Some local groups threatened violence against rum runners and notorious sinners; the violent episodes generally took place in the South.|$|E

40|$|We {{advance a}} {{conceptual}} frame for explaining economic transformation in China that combines a dynamic and a comparative perspective {{by taking the}} analysis of Fiscal Federalism one step further. Using insights from the comparative <b>business</b> <b>systems</b> literature we show that devolution of power {{at the beginning of}} the reform process introduced local autonomy, which stimulated a diversity of local regulatory regimes. As the central political leadership is no longer the sole supplier of institutional change, local governments become equal contributors to the formation of local <b>business</b> <b>systems.</b> Yet, local governments only partially define emerging local <b>business</b> <b>systems.</b> Local governance at the enterprise level is defined by the interaction between political and economic entrepreneurship, or, phrased in institutional terms, local <b>business</b> <b>systems</b> emerge from the interplay between the formal architecture of local autonomy and the informal institution of networking. In a comparative perspective this interaction, and its underlying driving forces for co-operation, namely: procedural uncertainty, relational risk and institutional change, will lead to diversity in outcomes. In a dynamic perspective both market competition and networking will ensure further competition between <b>business</b> <b>systems,</b> while political unification, imitation or scale economies will ask for convergence of local <b>business</b> <b>systems</b> beyond the local nexus.

The paper discusses to which extent economics is helpful for the understanding of <b>business</b> <b>systems.</b> Moreover, the paper uses this as a catalyst for a broader discussion of the economics and sociology connection. The main argument is that while economics is helpful for understanding certain aspects of <b>business</b> <b>systems,</b> the path-dependent, complementary and contextdependent features of <b>business</b> <b>systems</b> are hard to grasp with economic tools to the extent that these features have cognitive and normative elements. In general, economics has a problem with the cognitive and normative aspects of institutions, which are merely treated as side-constraints on action.
