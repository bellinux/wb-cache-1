In 349, Later Zhao's emperor Shi Hu died, and his state soon fell into internectine wars between his sons and his adoptive {{grandson}} Shi Min. Murong Jun therefore decided to advance south. In Murong Jun's campaigns {{over the next few}} years, which saw him seize much of Later Zhao's territory and capture Shi Min (who had by then changed him name to Ran Min, to the family name that his father had before his adoption by Shi Hu) and destroy his short-lived state Ran Wei, Murong Ping served as a major general. Murong Ping led the army that sieged Ran Wei's capital Yecheng (鄴城, in modern Handan, Hebei), after Ran Min's capture, in 352, against Ran Min's wife Empress Dong and son Ran Zhi, and the city fell to him, formally ending Ran Wei. He was put in charge of Yecheng's defenses.

40|$|The {{ability of}} mesenchymal stromal (stem) cells (MSCs) to be mobilised from their local depot towards sites of injury and to {{participate}} in tissue repair makes these cells promising candidates for cell therapy. Physiological O 2 tension in an MSC niche in vivo is about 4 – 7 %. However, most in vitro studies of MSC functional activity are performed at 20 % O 2. Therefore, this study focused on the effects of short-term hypoxic stress (0. 1 % O 2, 24 [*]h) on adipose tissue-derived MSC motility at tissue-related O 2 level. No significant changes in integrin expression were detected after short-term hypoxic stress. However, O 2 deprivation provoked vimentin disassembly and actin polymerisation and increased cell stiffness. In addition, hypoxic stress induced the downregulation of ACTR 3, DSTN, MACF 1, MID 1, MYPT 1, NCK 1, ROCK 1, TIAM 1, and WASF 1 expression, the products of which are known to <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>leading</b> edge formation and cell translocation. These changes were accompanied by the attenuation of targeted and nontargeted migration of MSCs after short-term hypoxic exposure, as demonstrated in scratch and transwell migration assays. These results indicate that acute hypoxic stress can modulate MSC function in their native milieu, preventing their mobilisation from sites of injury...|$|E

However, temperament/personality traits have been less frequently studied even though the correlation with Axis- 1 diseases is well defined. The present study aims to detect correlations between {{psychiatric disorders}}, temperament traits and body image perception in overweight and obese patients who seek surgical lipostructuring treatment. METHODS: Seventy overweight/obese patients (age 18 - 60 years, BMI 25 - 34. 9 at recruitment) referring to the outpatient service for obesity-related lipodystrophism {{were enrolled in the}} period March 2008 -March 2012. Psychiatric disorders, temperament traits, and body image perception were evaluated and compared with a control group (N[*]=[*] 33) from the general population sharing clinical/demographic features. RESULTS: Patients had higher scores in lifetime depression, with moderate/mild concern with body shape.

40|$|Introduction/Purpose. Correlations between {{psychiatric}} disorders and overweight/obesity {{are reported in}} the literature. However, while the relation with Axis- 1 diseases is well-defined, temperamental/personality traits have been less investigated. The study aimed at detecting correlations between {{psychiatric disorders}}, temperamental traits and body image perception in overweight and obese patients who seek surgical lipostructuring treatments. Material and Methods. 28 overweight/obese patients (age 18 - 60 yrs, BMI 25 to 34. 9 at recruitment) {{were enrolled in the}} period March 2008 - June 2011 between those referring to the outpatient service for Obesity-related lipodystrophisms of the Institute of Plastic Surgery. Presence of psychiatric disorders, temperamental traits and body image perception were evaluated, and compared to a control group (N= 25) from general population sharing clinical/demographic features. Psychiatric evaluation was based on acquisition of clinical history, Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview, Beck Depression Inventory, Yale Brown Scale (YBOCS), Paykel Life Events Scale, NEO Five Factory Inventory, Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire (TPQ), Body Shape Questionnaire (BSQ). Results. The patients group presented higher scoring in lifetime depression and BSQ with moderate/mild concern with body shapes. With regard to personality traits, TPQ revealed higher score in subscale RD 4 (dependence/independence) in the patients, while controls scored higher in “openness to experience” NEO-FFI sub-scale. At YBOCS obese patients presented higher prevalence of obsessive characters. Conclusion. The affective sphere is a relevant feature in obese patients, but also obsessive traits, as negative body shape perception and temperamental and personality characteristics appear to <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>leading</b> patients to seek surgical consultation. These aspects are implicated in medical/surgical outcome and compliance to treatments. The possibility to individuate the patients who present alterations in those traits or psychic characteristics may be an instrument to avoid early post-treatment relapse and to implement the service offered to patients with appropriate psychiatric care before and after surgery...|$|E

40|$|The studies {{reported}} in this thesis were designed to address several important issues in symptom-specific cognitive models of psychosis. The design of these studies was guided by {{a commitment to the}} continuity hypothesis of psychosis, which holds that psychotic experiences exist on a continuum stretching into the healthy population. The thesis firstly examines a two-factor cognitive model of persecutory ideation, focusing primarily on the roles of thought suppression, intrusive thoughts, anxiety, social rank, and the jumping to conclusions bias. The thesis then turns to an examination of cognitive factors involved in hallucinations and, in particular, auditory verbal hallucinations. Chapters in this section describe a series of experimental and theoretical studies of the relations between intrusive thoughts and hallucinations, agency and hallucinations, and the role of inner speech in auditory verbal hallucinations. Two-factor models of persecutory delusion (PD) formation propose that in the first stage of PD formation an initial implausible idea is triggered. The second stage of Deformation is then the uncritical adoption of such a thought as a belief, which may be due to cognitive biases such as the jumping to conclusions (JTC) bias often present in those with PDs. The first study (Chapter 1) investigated whether thought suppression, and its interaction with anxiety, was associated with levels of non-clinical persecutory delusion like beliefs (PDLBs). It was hypothesised that thought suppression could {{play a role in the}} formation and maintenance of PDLBs through its tendency to lead to intrusive thoughts, and to trigger initial implausible ideas. Consistent with this proposal, thought suppression was positively associated with PDLBs only when anxiety was high. The second study (Chapter 2) examined a prediction of the two-factor model, namely that a second-stage factor, the jumping to conclusions (JTC) bias, should interact with first-stage factors, specifically social anxiety, social rank, anomalous experiences and thought suppression. Consistent with the two-factor model, the JTC bias was found not to be an independent predictor of PDLB levels, but its interaction with social rank was a significant predictor of PDLBs. It was concluded that although evidence was found for the two-factor model, the presence of the JTC bias was neither a sufficient nor necessary condition for PDLB formation. In addition to being postulated to play a role in persecutory delusion formation, intrusive thoughts have been implicated in the formation of hallucinations, and particularly auditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs). The third study (Chapter 3) created a new tool for assessing hypnagogic and hypnopompic (H&H) hallucinations, and showed that the presence of auditory H&H hallucinations, but not visual or felt-presence H&H hallucinations, was associated with a greater tendency to experience intrusions. The fourth study (Chapter 4) developed an extended model of AVHs in which rumination, as well as thought suppression, were proposed to be involved in the formation of AVHs, through their creation of intrusive thoughts. This model was tested in a healthy sample of individuals using structural equation modelling, and the proposed model was found to be a good fit to the data. The study on rumination and AVHs highlighted that agency disruption factors are likely to <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>leading</b> these self-generated cognitions to be experienced as alien. A theoretical analysis (Chapter 5) was made of the mechanisms likely to be involved in this disruption of agency, involving the concept of a neurocognitive action self-monitoring system (NASS) and a breakdown in the processes leading to the illusion of conscious will. A consideration was also given to how a Vygotskian conception of inner speech could contribute to inner speech models of AVHs. The next study (Chapter 6) then performed an empirical test of the proposal that the disruption of agency in AVHs is associated with a faulty NASS. Subliminal primes were used as a proxy for the predicted state proposed to exist in the NASS, which leads to the experience of agency. It was proposed that those prone to hallucinations would be less able to use primes to enhance their experience of agency, due to deficits in their NASS. A statistically significant trend was found for the more hallucination-prone to be less able to use subliminal primes, but this effect was only found in women. It was concluded that although this was a promising finding, the effect was too small and gender-specific to be practical to test in a clinical sample of patients with AVHs. The proposal that AVHs result from a breakdown in the NASS, specifically a corollary discharge deficit between speech production and reception areas, has been claimed to be supported by electrophysiological event-related potential (ERP) studies. However, only a simplistic conception of inner speech has thus far been investigated in ERP studies, and the potential confounding effects of attention have not been considered. The Nl ERP component response to auditory stimuli during inner speech was studied in as ample of healthy volunteers (Chapter 7). Although dampening of the Nl response was found during all types of inner speech, as compared to a silent baseline condition, dampening was also found during a mental rotation task. It was concluded that dampening of the Nl ERP component during inner speech is due to attention factors, and is not indicative of a corollary discharge mechanism. Finally, a theoretical analysis considers whether inner speech models of AVHs are able to satisfactorily account for the phenomenology of the experience (Chapter 8). It is concluded that subcategorisation of auditory hallucinations may be necessary, with memory-based, inner speech-based, and ictal-based models each accounting for a subcategory of auditory hallucinations. The concept of the dynamic developmental progression of AVHs is introduced and avenues for future research in this area highlighte...|$|E
