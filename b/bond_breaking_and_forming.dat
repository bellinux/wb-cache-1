40|$|Molecular {{clusters}} are non-covalent aggregates {{widely recognized}} as a new state of matter, whose properties are neither those of the individual constituents nor those of their condensed phases. Tailor made molecular clusters {{have proved to be}} ideal systems for modelling molecular recognition phenomena and their applications in many scientific fields interlocking the physical and life sciences are now well assessed. In the last few years, it has become possible, through the use of advanced laser techniques, to study the interactions between individual components of a cluster, produced by laser desorption. The studies were carried out developing laser spectroscopic methodologies, capable of characterizing molecular clusters and probing the chemical <b>bond</b> <b>breaking</b> <b>and</b> <b>forming</b> on an extremely short time scale. This paper deals with chiral recognition in gas phase clusters of biological interest through the application of the mass-resolved Resonant Two Photon Ionization (1 and 2 color R 2 PI) laser technique. The measurement of the spectroscopic shifts and of the fragmentation thresholds of diasteromeric clusters allows the determination {{of the nature of the}} interactions which control the formation of biological material and affect their stability and reactivity.

40|$|During {{the process}} of terpene biosynthesis, C–C <b>bond</b> <b>breaking</b> <b>and</b> <b>forming</b> steps are {{subjected}} to kinetic carbon isotope effects, leading to distinct carbon isotopic signatures of the products. Accordingly, carbon isotopic signatures {{could be used to}} reveal the ‘biosynthetic history’ of the produced terpenoids. Five known sesquiterpene cyclases, regulating three different pathways, representing simple to complex biosynthetic sequences, were heterologously expressed and used for in vitro assays with farnesyl diphosphate as substrate. Compound specific isotope ratio mass spectrometry measurements of the enzyme substrate farnesyl diphosphate (FDP) and the products of all the five cyclases were performed. The calculated δ 13 C value for FDP, based on δ 13 C values and relative amounts of the products, was identical with its measured δ 13 C value, confirming the reliability of the approach and the precision of measurements. The different carbon isotope ratios of the products reflect the complexity of their structure and are correlated with the frequency of carbon–carbon bond forming and breaking steps on their individual biosynthetic pathways. Thus, the analysis of carbon isotopic signatures of terpenes at natural abundance {{can be used as a}} powerful tool in elucidation of associated biosynthetic mechanisms of terpene synthases and in future in vivo studies even without ‘touching’ the plant...|$|E

40|$|Quantum {{chemistry}} {{has become}} one of the most reliable tools for characterizing the thermochemical underpinnings of reactions, such as bond dissociation energies (BDEs). The accurate prediction of these particular properties (BDEs) are challenging for ab initio methods based on perturbative corrections or coupled cluster expansions of the single-determinant Hartree-Fock wave function: the processes of <b>bond</b> <b>breaking</b> <b>and</b> <b>forming</b> are inherently multi-configurational and require an accurate description of non-dynamical electron correlation. To this end, we present a systematic ab initio approach for computing BDEs that is based on three components: 1) multi-reference single and double excitation configuration interaction (MRSDCI) for the electronic energies; 2) a two-parameter scheme for extrapolating MRSDCI energies to the complete basis set limit; and 3) DFT-B 3 LYP calculations of minimum-energy structures and vibrational frequencies to account for zero point energy and thermal corrections. We validated our methodology against a set of reliable experimental BDE values of C-C and C-H bonds of hydrocarbons. The goal of chemical accuracy is achieved, on average, without applying any empirical corrections to the MRSDCI electronic energies. We then use this composite scheme to make predictions of BDEs in a large number of hydrocarbon molecules for which there are no experimental data, so as to provide needed thermochemical estimates for fuel molecules...|$|E

Oxidative <b>bond</b> <b>breaking</b> <b>and</b> <b>forming</b> involving radical ions are common process taking place in asymmetric enzyme cavities. Side-chain C-alpha-C-beta bond fragmentation in the radical cations of aromatic alcohols is a common process in solution [1 - 3], whose efficiency is enhanced in polar solvents such as water. Hydrogen-bonding between the ion and the solvent in the relevant transition structure is thought as responsible of the rate acceleration [4]. Effects of achiral and chiral microsolvation on the radical cation of R-(+) - 1 -phenyl- 1 -propanol, have been investigated. The energy thresholds of the homolytic C alpha-C beta bond breaking of R-(+) - 1 -phenyl- 1 -propanol radical cation, its mono-hydrated cluster, and its clusters with (2 R, 3 R) -(-) - 2, 3 -butanediol and (2 S, 3 S) -(+) - 2, 3 -butanediol have been studied through two color Resonant Two Photon Ionization, Photodissociation and Mass Spectrometry. The barrier of the C alpha-C beta fragmentation is appreciably higher for the unsolvated molecular ion than for its adducts with solvent molecules. Moreover, marked differences in the ethyl loss fragmentation energy are observed for the clusters with water and with the two diols. In particular the homochiral cluster with (2 R, 3 R) -(-) - 2, 3 -butane diol exhibits a fragmentation barrier {{higher than that of}} the corresponding heterochiral adduct with (2 S, 3 S) -(+) - 2, 3 -butanediol...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe present force-displacement data {{simulated}} with {{molecular dynamics}} of quasi-static displacement controlled pull-out tests of single-walled carbon nanotubes (CNT) embedded in palladium. With our simulations {{we focus on}} the mechanical interface behavior at the atomic scale which is of importance for thermo-mechanical reliability predictions and failure-mechanistic treatment of future CNT devices. In general, an incommensurate interface structure can be predicted, when a chiral CNT is in contact with a noble metal like palladium. This originates in lattices with different basis and periodicities as well as a strong metal interaction, a strong carbon interaction and a weak metal carbon interaction, which in this paper is assumed to be of van der Waals type. We report on an interface fracture with a complete detachment of CNT and palladium. The pull-out forces we calculated are in the nano Newton range for models with CNTs embedded 5 to 10 nm and increase when the CNT has intrinsic defects or functional groups are attached. Furthermore, for ideal cases the pull-out behavior is independent of the embedding length and although <b>bond</b> <b>breaking</b> <b>and</b> <b>forming</b> occurs, there is no associated energy dissipation. Due to the incommensurate interface some atoms assist while others resist the pull-out displacement. In effect the pull-out force is then a restoring force, which is fed by the surface potential energy that is lowered when the CNT shares maximum contact area with the palladium. In contrast, defects in the CNT like kinks or functional groups alter this behavior and then energy dissipation becomes a pronounced effect due to sudden changes of unstable atomic configurations...|$|E

Theoretical predictions agree well with experimental observations of this scattering process(15 - 20, 22). Indirect exchange mechanisms involving H- 3 intermediates have been suggested to occur as well(8 - 13), but these are difficult to test because bimolecular reactions cannot be studied by the femtosecond spectroscopies(23) used to monitor unimolecular reactions. Moreover, full quantum simulations of the time evolution of bimolecular reactions have not been performed. For the isotopic variant of the hydrogen exchange reaction, H + D- 2 [...] > HD + D, forward scattering features(21) observed in the product angular distribution have been attributed(21, 12) to possible scattering resonances associated with a quasibound collision complex.

40|$|Water {{consists}} of an extended hydrogen bond network that is constantly evolving. More than just {{a description of the}} time averaged structure is necessary to understand any process that occurs in water. In this thesis we study the dynamic regime, which involves fluctuations and rearrangements that occur on the tens of femtoseconds to picosecond time scale. The dynamic regime involves hydrogen <b>bond</b> <b>breaking</b> <b>and</b> <b>forming</b> which interlaces with translations and reorientation and ultimately largescale reorganization. Our experimental technique is ultrafast infrared spectroscopy of the OX stretch (where X = H, D, or T) of isotopically dilute water. The OX stretch frequency is sensitive to its environment, and loss of frequency correlation provides a picture of local and collective hydrogen bond dynamics. With pump-probe experiments we are also able to measure vibrational relaxation and reorientational dynamics of water. We present the first infrared linear absorption spectrum of the OT stretch of isotopically dilute tritiated water and compare line shape parameters to the other water isotopologues to provide further evidence that electric field fluctuations properly describe line broadening of the infrared spectrum of water. Measurement of the infrared spectrum of tritiated water is the first step towards an experiment that may be capable of directly monitoring the relative geometry between two water molecules during a hydrogen bond switch. We calculate the change in electric field and transition dipole coupling during an idealized hydrogen switch to determine the correlated frequency shifts one might observe in such an experiment. To test the proposed vibrational relaxation pathway in isotopically dilute water, we present the first pump-probe of tritiated water and the temperature-dependent lifetime of deuterated water (or HOD in H 20). For the OT and OH stretch, our experimental findings agree with the proposed mechanism in which the vibrational energy first relaxes to the intramolecular bend. However, evidence from the temperature-dependent measurements of the OD stretch show multiple pathways may be in competition that have different dependencies on temperature. Our results call for further experimental and theoretical studies. We acquire temperature-dependent 2 D IR and pump-probe anisotropy measurements of the OD stretch of HOD in H 20 in order to test if spectral diffusion, which reports on hydrogen bond rearrangements, and reorientation are correlated in water. We compare the temperature dependence of the picosecond decay to a number of measures of structural relaxation and find similar activation barrier heights and slightly non-Arrhenius behavior, which suggests that the reaction coordinate for hydrogen bond reorganization in water is collective. by Rebecca Anne Nicodemus.

Calculations on the models [M 8 (E 2 PH 2) 6] 2 + (M = Cu(I), Ag(I); E = S, Se) and the ionic or neutral [M 8 (X) (E 2 PH 2) 6]q (X = H, F, Cl, Br, O, S, Se, N, P, C) indicate that the cubic M 8 L 6 cage adapts its shape for maximizing the host-guest bonding interaction. The interplay between size, covalent and ionic bonding favors either a cubic, tetracapped tetrahedral, or bicapped octahedral structure of the metal framework. Whereas the large third- and fourth-row main group anions maintain the cubic shape, a distortion toward a tetracapped tetrahedral arrangement of the metals occurs in the case of hydride, fluoride, and oxide. The distortion is strong in the case of hydride, weak in the case of fluoride, and intermediate in the case of oxide. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations predict a bicapped octahedral architecture in the case of nitride and carbide. These computational results are supported by X-ray structures, including those of new fluorine- and oxygen-containing compounds. It is suggested that other oxygen-containing as well as so far unknown nitride-containing clusters should be feasible. For the first time, the dynamical behavior of the encapsulated hydride has been investigated by metadynamics simulations. Our results clearly demonstrate that the interconversion mechanism between two identical tetracapped tetrahedral configurations occurs through a succession of M-H <b>bonds</b> <b>breaking</b> <b>and</b> <b>forming</b> which present very low activation energies and which involve a rather large number of intermediate structures.

40|$|Amyloid fibril {{aggregation}} {{is associated}} with several horrific diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Creutzfeld-Jacob, diabetes, Parkinson’s and others. The process of amyloid aggregation involves forming myriad different metastable intermediate aggregates. Amyloid fibrils are composed of proteins that originate in an innocuous α-helix or random-coil structure. The α-helices convert their structure to β-strands that aggregate into β-sheets, and then into protofibrils, and ultimately into fully formed amyloid fibrils. On the basis of experimental data, I have developed a mathematical model for the kinetics of the reaction pathways and determined rate parameters for peptide secondary structural conversion and aggregation during the entire fibrillogenesis process from random coil to fibrils, including the molecular species that accelerate the conversions. The specific steps of the model and the rate constants that are determined by fitting to experimental data provide insight on the molecular species involved in the fibril formation process. To better understand the molecular basis of the protein structural transitions and aggregation, I report on molecular dynamics (MD) computational studies on the formation of amyloid protofibrillar structures in the small model protein ccβ, which undergoes many of the structural transitions of the larger, naturally occurring amyloid forming proteins. Two different structural transition processes involving hydrogen bonds are observed for aggregation into fibrils: the breaking of intrachain hydrogen bonds to allow β-hairpin proteins to straighten, and the subsequent formation of interchain hydrogen bonds during aggregation into amyloid fibrils. For my MD simulations, I found that the temperature dependence of these two different structural transition processes results {{in the existence of}} a temperature window that the ccβ protein experiences during the process of forming protofibrillar structures. Both the mathematical modeling of the kinetics and the MD simulations show that molecular structural heterogeneity is {{a major factor in the}} process.

Stoichiometric reactivity studies indicate that catalytic turnover ensues through the generation of magnesium aldimido, aldimidoborate and borylamido intermediates, which are formed in a sequence of intramolecular nitrile insertion and inter- and intramolecular B–H metathesis events. Kinetic studies highlight variations in mechanism for the catalytic dihydroboration of alkyl nitriles, aryl nitriles bearing electron withdrawing (Ar(EWG) CN) and aryl nitriles bearing electron donating (Ar(EDG) CN) substitution patterns. Kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) for catalysis performed with DBpin indicate that B–H <b>bond</b> <b>breaking</b> <b>and</b> C–H <b>bond</b> <b>forming</b> reactions are involved in the rate determining processes during the dihydroboration of alkyl nitriles and Ar(EDG) CN substrates, which display divergent first and second order rate dependences on [HBpin] respectively.

Irrespective of these differences, a common mechanism is proposed in which the rate determining steps are deduced to vary through the establishment of several pre-equilibria, the relative positions of which are determined by the respective stabilities of the dimeric and monomeric magnesium aldimide and magnesium aldimidoborate intermediates as a result of adjustments to the basicity of the nitrile substrate.

In our computer simulation we observed covalent <b>bond</b> <b>breaking</b> {{in the network}} caused by excited electrons, whereas holes contribute {{to the formation of}} inter-chain bonds. The interplay between photo-induced <b>bond</b> <b>breaking</b> <b>and</b> inter-chain <b>bond</b> formation leads to either volume expansion or shrinkage. In the non-ideal case, only a part of the processes is reversible and the total expansion includes the reversible and irreversible changes. Finally we investigate the structural properties of flatly and obliquely deposited chalcogenide thin films. Different void sizes can cause different photoinduced volume changes...|$|R
40|$|The bond Fukui {{function}} is introduced and tested {{as a new}} reactivity index capable of predicting the evolution of <b>bond</b> <b>breaking</b> <b>and</b> formation processes during an organic reaction involving pi conjugated systems. As an illustration, we examine many cases where substituted ethylenes and dienes may respond to different reagents to yield cycloaddition, Michael addition, and other reactions at double bonds.

40|$|International audienceThe photopolymerization {{ability of}} photosensitized alkoxyamines has been investigated. These {{compounds}} behave as interesting two-component photoinitiators. Laser flash photolysis, electron spin resonance, and density functional theory allow {{to support the}} interactions encountered between the photosensitizer (benzophenone and isopropylthioxanthone) and the alkoxyamines (C-O <b>bond</b> <b>breaking</b> <b>and</b> hydrogen transfer) and the side reactions of the nitroxide radical with photosensitizer (electron transfer).
