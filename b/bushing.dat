25|$|A drill <b>bushing,</b> {{also known}} as a jig <b>bushing,</b> is a tool used in {{metalworking}} jigs to guide cutting tools, most commonly drill bits. Other tools that are commonly used in a drill <b>bushing</b> include counterbores, countersinks, and reamers. They are designed to guide, position, and support the cutting tool.|$|E
25|$|Renewable {{bushings}} must {{be secured}} in their liner <b>bushing,</b> otherwise the tool can cause it to spin, which rapidly wears out the liner, or chips can force the <b>bushing</b> out of the liner. There are {{many different types of}} locking systems for renewable bushings. One system is a dog, which is a collar that is pressed over the head of the <b>bushing</b> and has a long tail. The tail may be bent at the end so it can lock {{around the edge of the}} jig plate or it may be left straight if it can butt up against another object. Another option to keep the renewable <b>bushing</b> from rotating is to pin it, either by putting a pin in the renewable <b>bushing</b> and a hole in the liner or vice versa. A more complicated version uses a hole in the <b>bushing</b> collar and a pin with a head; the head on the pin holds the edge of the collar down, but for removal the <b>bushing</b> can be rotated so that the hole lines up with the pin.|$|E

25|$|A {{common problem}} {{encountered}} is when {{two or more}} holes are too close for independent standard bushings. In this case one large renewable <b>bushing</b> {{can be made with}} two (or more) holes in the proper location (the first example in the image). Another possibility is to make a custom <b>bushing</b> with an eccentric hole and then notches {{on the outside of the}} head are used to locate the proper position of the <b>bushing</b> for each location (the middle example in the image). Another common need for a custom <b>bushing</b> is when the hole needed is perpendicular jig plate; in this case a bracket <b>bushing</b> is used. It is a hardened piece of right angle steel that bolts to the jig plate and is located with dowel pins.|$|E

25|$|Press fit are {{available}} in two types with liners or without (wearing bushings). Liner bushings, sometimes called master bushings, are permanently installed into the jig and accept liners that can easily be replaced.

25|$|In 1908 New Castle {{was linked}} to Pittsburgh by the Pittsburgh, Harmony, Butler and New Castle Railway, an {{interurban}} trolley line. Steel and paper mills, foundries, a bronze <b>bushing</b> factory, and car-construction plants contributed to the economy. In addition, the Shenango China produced commercial china and created the fine Castleton china line for the White House, including dinnerware for Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower and Lyndon B. Johnson. Other ceramic factories produced bathroom fixtures and industrial refractory materials.|$|E
25|$|Fixed {{renewable}} bushings {{are used}} in applications where the liner {{is meant to be}} used until it wears out. Slip renewable bushings are designed to be interchangeable with a given sized liner so that two different sized slip renewable bushings can be used in one liner <b>bushing.</b> This facilitates the ability to do multiple machining operations that require different inner diameter (ID) bushings, such as drilling and reaming. They usually have knurled heads so they can be easily removed.|$|E
