Bachmann stated that her church [...] "does not believe that the Pope is the Anti-Christ, that's absolutely false...

2500|$|Their initial {{focus was}} Indianapolis and Goodyear's battle with Firestone, but Gurney's first love was road racing, {{especially}} in Europe, {{and he wanted}} to win the Formula One World Championship while driving an American Grand Prix 'Eagle'. The car has often been characterised as a primarily British-based effort, but in recent interviews Gurney has <b>been</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> that the car was designed and built by crew members based in the All-American Racers Southern California-based facility. Partnered with British engine maker Weslake, the Formula One effort was called [...] "Anglo American Racers." [...] The Weslake V12 engine was not ready for the 1966 Grand Prix season, so the team used outdated four-cylinder 2.7-litre Coventry-Climax engines and made their first appearance in the second race of the year in Belgium. This was the race of the sudden torrential downpour captured in the feature film Grand Prix, and although Gurney completed the race in seventh place, he was unclassified. Gurney scored the team's first Championship points three weeks later by finishing fifth in the French Grand Prix at Reims.|$|E
2500|$|Following the 2 May 2011 federal election, which {{returned}} a majority Conservative government, Industry Minister Tony Clement {{announced that the}} government had rejected Diamond's loan request. Clement stated [...] "We are stewards of taxpayers dollars and we have risked, quite rightly, $20 million in taxpayer dollars to date, and it is not judicious to up that by another $35 million. We hope the company Diamond continues {{to be part of the}} scene in London. We do not wish for its demise." [...] Maurer indicated that the company was still working on private investment options but that would take more time and that in the meantime they were continuing to lose their laid-off staff. He also stated [...] "We have <b>been</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> that without this loan, the D-Jet program is at risk here in London. Diamond’s future is at risk here." [...] Maurer indicated that when upcoming loan repayments are due that the company cannot meet those obligations out of propeller aircraft sales and without an infusion of capital cannot get the D-Jet to market.|$|E

2500|$|On August 20, 2012, President Barack Obama {{used the}} phrase [...] "red line" [...] in {{reference}} to the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian civil war, saying, [...] "We have <b>been</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> to the Assad regime, but also to other players on the ground, that a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized. That would change my calculus. That would change my equation." [...] The phrase became a source of contention when political opponent John McCain said the red line was [...] "apparently written in disappearing ink," [...] due to the perception the red line had been crossed with no action. On the one year anniversary of Obama's red line speech the Ghouta chemical attacks occurred. Obama then clarified [...] "I didn't set a red line. The world set a red line when governments representing 98 percent of the world's population said the use of chemical weapons are abhorrent and passed a treaty forbidding their use even when countries are engaged in war," [...] a reference to the Chemical Weapons Convention.|$|E
2500|$|The Party's Ard Fheis in 2009 {{unanimously}} {{passed a}} motion to organise in Northern Ireland by establishing forums, rather than cumainn, {{in each of the}} North's six counties. In December 2009, Fianna Fáil secured its first Northern Assembly MLA when Gerry McHugh, an independent MLA, announced he had joined the party. Mr. McHugh confirmed that although he had joined the party, he would continue to sit as an independent MLA. In June 2010, Fianna Fáil opened its first official office in the North in Crossmaglen, County Armagh. The then Taoiseach Brian Cowen officially opened the office, accompanied by Ministers Éamon Ó Cuív and Dermot Ahern and Deputies Rory O’Hanlon and Margaret Conlon. Discussing the party's slow development towards all-Ireland politics, Mr. Cowen observed: [...] "We have a very open and pragmatic approach. [...] We are a constitutional republican party and we make no secret of the aspirations on which this party was founded. [...] It has always <b>been</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> in our mind what it is we are seeking to achieve, that is to reconcile this country and not being prisoners of our past history. [...] To be part of a generation that will build a new Ireland, an Ireland of which we can all be proud".|$|E
2500|$|As {{a result}} of the {{opposition}} to the bill, the government referred it back to the House Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights for possible amendment before introducing it for Second Reading. The bill was quietly shelved during the summer of 2012. Citing public opposition, the government announced in February 2013 that the legislation had been withdrawn. Nicholson stated that the government had [...] "listened to the concerns of Canadians who have <b>been</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> on this and responding to that". He added, “We will not be proceeding with Bill C-30. And any attempts to modernize the criminal code will not contain …warrantless mandatory disclosure of basic subscriber information or the requirement for telecommunications service providers to build intercept capability within their systems.” Bill C-55, which was originally part of the original Internet surveillance legislation, is all that remains of the contentious Bill C-30. Bill C-55 is needed to bring Canada’s emergency wiretapping powers into conformity with a 2012 Supreme Court decision that struck down a 20-year-old law {{on the grounds that it}} did not require police to inform those who had been wiretapped after the fact or provide for any other oversight of the police power. Thus on account of this bill, any persons subject to government surveillance or wiretapping in Canada must legally be informed of the surveillance after the fact.|$|E

And out upon it stood ships, sailing ships and a steamer or so, going up to London or down out into the great seas of the world. I stood for a long time watching these and thinking whether after all I should not have done better to have run away to sea.|$|E
60|$|She looked {{round the}} room, {{longing for a}} friend, whom she might consult with a true feeling of genuine womanly dependence. Her most natural friend was Roger Carbury. But even had he been there {{she could not have}} {{consulted}} him on any matter touching the Melmottes. His advice would have <b>been</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear.</b> He would have told her to have nothing at all to do with such adventurers. But then dear Roger was old-fashioned, and knew nothing of people as they are now. He lived in a world which, though slow, had been good in its way; but which, whether bad or good, had now passed away. Then her eye settled on Mr Broune. She was afraid of Mr Alf. She had almost begun to think that Mr Alf was too difficult of management to be of use to her. But Mr Broune was softer. Mr Booker was serviceable for an article, but would not be sympathetic as a friend.|$|E
60|$|In person, {{my father}} was of not more than middle height. He was very slenderly and delicately made; his head small, and well set on his shoulders--his {{forehead}} more broad than lofty--his complexion singularly pale, except in moments of agitation, when I have already noticed its tendency to flush all over in an instant. His eyes, large and gray, had something commanding in their look; they gave a certain unchanging firmness and dignity to his expression, not often met with. They betrayed his birth and breeding, his old ancestral prejudices, his chivalrous sense of honour, in every glance. It required, indeed, all the masculine energy of look about {{the upper part of}} his face, to redeem the lower part from an appearance of effeminacy, so delicately was it moulded in its fine Norman outline. His smile was remarkable for its sweetness--it was almost like a woman's smile. In speaking, too, his lips often trembled as women's do. If he ever laughed, as a young man, his laugh must have <b>been</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> and musical; but since I can recollect him, I never heard it. In his happiest moments, in the gayest society, I have only seen him smile.|$|E

60|$|The attack now {{was being}} commenced, {{and how was}} he to repel it, or to answer it? Only on one ground had he {{received}} from Robert Bolton a decided opinion. Under no circumstances was he to give money to these persons. Were he to be guilty of that weakness he would have delivered himself over into their hands. And {{not only did he}} put implicit trust in the sagacity of Robert Bolton, but he himself knew enough of the world's opinion on such a matter to be aware that a man who has allowed himself to be frightened out of money is supposed to have acknowledged some terrible delinquency. He had <b>been</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> in his mind when that letter came from Euphemia Smith that he would not now make any rebate. Till that attack had come, it might have been open to him to be generous;--but not now. And yet when this man spoke of his own loss, and reminded him of his wealth;--when Crinkett threw it in his teeth that by a happy chance he had feathered his nest with the spoils taken from the wretched man himself,--then he wished that it was in his power to give back something.|$|E

I was packed with a lot of poor fellows, and was beginning to wish I'd stayed queer, till I heard Tom's voice saying, 'Never mind, boys; put me down anywheres, and tend to the others. I can wait.' That set me up. I sung out, and they stowed him alongside. It was so dark down there I could hardly see his face; but his voice and ways were just as hearty and comforting as ever, and he kept up my spirits wonderful that day. I was pretty weak, and kept dozing off; but whenever I woke I felt for Tom, and he was always there. He told me, when Parkes came with help, he saw me off, and then went back for another go at the Rebs; but got a ball in the breast, and was in rather a bad way, he guessed. He couldn't lay down; but sat by me, leaning back, with his hand on my pillow, where I could find it easy. He talked to me all he could, till his voice give out; for he got very weak, and there was a dreadful groaning all around us." ...|$|E
6000|$|At {{the thought}} of a lover for V.V. a sudden flood of anger poured across the old man's mind, behind the still mask of his face. It infuriated him even to think of V.V., his little V.V., his own girl, {{entertaining}} a lover, being possibly--most shameful thought--IN LOVE! Like some ordinary silly female, sinking to kisses, to the deeds one could buy and pay for. His V.V.! The idea infuriated and disgusted him. He fought against it as a possibility. Once some woman in New York had ventured to hint something to him of some fellow, some affair with an artist, Caston; she had linked this Caston with V.V.'s red cross nursing in Europe.... Old Grammont had made that woman sorry she spoke. Afterwards he had caused enquiries to be made about this Caston, careful enquiries. It seems that he and V.V. had known each other, there had been something. But nothing that V.V. need be ashamed of. When old Grammont's enquiry man had come back with his report, old Grammont had been very particular about that. At first the fellow had not <b>been</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear,</b> rather muddled indeed as to how things were--no doubt he had wanted to make out there was something just to seem to earn his money. Old Grammont had struck the table sharply and the eyes that looked out of his mask had blazed. [...] "What have you found out against her?" [...] he had asked in a low even voice. [...] "Absolutely nothing, Sir," [...] said the agent, suddenly white to the lips....|$|E
