5|$|In a mid-credits scene, Connors, in {{a prison}} cell, speaks with {{a man in the}} shadows who asks if Peter knows the truth about his father. Connors doesn't know, and demands Peter to <b>be</b> <b>left</b> <b>alone</b> before the man disappears.|$|E
5|$|The King Charles is a {{friendly}} breed, {{to the extent}} that it is not typically as suitable as a watchdog as some breeds, though it may still bark to warn its owners of an approaching visitor. It is not a high energy breed, and enjoys the company of family members, being primarily a lapdog. Although able to bond well with children and tolerant of them, it will not accept rough handling. It prefers not to <b>be</b> <b>left</b> <b>alone</b> for long periods. Known as one of the quietest toy breeds, it is suitable for apartment living.|$|E
5|$|Bob Bishop confronts Noah Bennet (Jack Coleman), {{telling him}} that his {{daughter}} Claire Bennet (Hayden Panettiere) is trying to expose The Company {{and that they will}} have to take drastic measures. Claire is packing up her father's files, when her boyfriend West Rosen arrives to try and stop her from revealing his secret. Angered, she gives him his file and breaks up with him. Noah returns home and tells Claire not to expose The Company, informing her that he has made a deal. He will work for them and in exchange his family will <b>be</b> <b>left</b> <b>alone</b> to lead normal lives.|$|E

5|$|Kasche had not {{received}} a reply to his telegram of 17 March, so he sent a further telegram to von Ribbentrop on 26 March. In it he advised that two Partisan representatives had arrived in Zagreb for negotiations, and named them using their aliases. He {{pointed out that the}} Partisan interest in an armistice had increased, and emphasised that he considered this a significant development. By this time, Đilas and Velebit had returned to Zagreb, where they reiterated that the Partisans wanted recognition as a regular belligerent, and emphasised the futility of continued fighting. They effectively asked to <b>be</b> <b>left</b> <b>alone</b> to fight the Chetniks. According to Pavlowitch, it is not clear which side posed the question of what the Partisans would do if the British were to land in Yugoslavia without Partisan authorisation, but Đilas and Velebit said they would fight them as well as the Germans. They stated that their propaganda had been slanted towards the Soviet Union because {{they did not want to}} communicate with London. Their determination to fight the British if they landed was because they believed that the British would try to thwart their objective of seizing power in Yugoslavia. They further stated that the Chetniks would not fight the British because such a landing was exactly what they were waiting for.|$|E
5|$|Marta, a black gray wolf, is alpha {{female in}} a small pack in Pleasant Valley, Montana, that {{consists}} of her mate, Calef, their three pups Rann, Sula, and Annie, and a seven-year-old wolf named Oldtooth. One morning Calef is killed by poachers, leaving Marta and Oldtooth to try to feed and raise the pups on their own. Though an experienced hunter, Oldtooth is unable to bring down large game as he lost most of his teeth chewing a steel leg trap off his leg years ago. Once the cubs {{are old enough to}} <b>be</b> <b>left</b> <b>alone</b> for short periods of time, Marta takes over the bulk of the hunting. Though it is difficult, the two adults successfully keep all three cubs alive and begin weaning them and teaching them the ways of the wolf. In the summer, traps begin appearing in the area as human populations increase. Annie and Sula are caught and are taken away by humans, but reappear a few days later, locked in cages. Marta tries to free her pups but is unsuccessful; however humans come regularly to keep them fed and ensure they have water. Oldtooth is later captured, while Marta is tranquilized from a helicopter. Rann escapes and is not seen again.|$|E
5|$|The area a pride {{occupies}} {{is called}} a pride area, whereas that by a nomad is a range. The males associated with a pride tend {{to stay on the}} fringes, patrolling their territory. Why sociality – the most pronounced in any cat species – has developed in lionesses is the subject of much debate. Increased hunting success appears an obvious reason, but this is less than sure upon examination: coordinated hunting does allow for more successful predation but also ensures that non-hunting members reduce per capita calorific intake; however, some take a role raising cubs, who may <b>be</b> <b>left</b> <b>alone</b> for extended periods of time. Members of the pride regularly tend to play the same role in hunts and hone their skills. The health of the hunters is the primary need for the survival of the pride, and they are the first to consume the prey at the site it is taken. Other benefits include possible kin selection (better to share food with a related lion than with a stranger), protection of the young, maintenance of territory, and individual insurance against injury and hunger.|$|E

She was still unconvinced that Albert Fish was her son's killer.|$|E
25|$|Hanks next {{appeared}} in a cameo role as himself in The Simpsons Movie, in which he {{appeared in}} an advertisement claiming that the U.S. government has lost its credibility and is hence buying some of his. He also made an appearance in the credits, expressing a desire to <b>be</b> <b>left</b> <b>alone</b> when he is out in public. Later in 2006, Hanks produced the British film Starter for Ten, a comedy based on working-class students attempting to win on University Challenge.|$|E
25|$|Gagging {{anybody is}} very risky, as it {{involves}} a substantial risk of asphyxia if the subject's nose is blocked while wearing a gag. Using a gag on somebody who is ill or has a common allergy (including sensitivities to cologne or perfume) is also quite dangerous, as most gags make it difficult or impossible to breathe through the mouth. Vomiting and choking also pose a risk, since they further block the airway. A gagged subject should never <b>be</b> <b>left</b> <b>alone.</b>|$|E

25|$|In August 1940, Soviet Foreign {{minister}} Molotov {{told the}} Germans that, {{with the government}} change, they could close down their Baltic consulates by 1 September. The Soviet annexations in Romania caused further strain. While Germany had given the Soviets Bessarabia in the secret protocols, it had not given them North Bukovina. Germany wanted guarantees of the safety of property of ethnic Germans, security for the 125,000 Volksdeutsche in Bessarabia and North Bukovina, and reassurance that the train tracks carrying Romanian oil would <b>be</b> <b>left</b> <b>alone.</b>|$|E
25|$|One widely {{recognizable}} {{test for}} impulsivity is the delay of gratification paradigm {{commonly known as}} the 'marshmallow test'. Developed in the 1960s to assess 'willpower' and self-control in preschoolers, the marshmallow test consists of placing a single marshmallow in front of a child and informing them that they will <b>be</b> <b>left</b> <b>alone</b> in the room for some duration. The child is told that if the marshmallow remains uneaten when the experimenter returns, they will be awarded a second marshmallow, both of which can then be eaten.|$|E
25|$|A {{particularly}} {{strong sense of}} folk faith {{is found in the}} tribal parts of Burma. In this instance, there is not some type of divine being, and folk religion is practised entirely separately from Buddhism. In these tribal societies all nats are traditionally viewed as harmful, unlike in other villages where nats are invited to partake in festivals. Instead of adorning these nats with offerings and food, the most effort is put into fending evil spirits off. These tribes just merely want to <b>be</b> <b>left</b> <b>alone,</b> undisturbed by the malicious spirits.|$|E

25|$|A PWD usually {{stays in}} {{proximity}} to its owners, both indoors and outdoors. Although very gregarious animals, these dogs will typically bond with one primary or alpha family member. Some speculate that this intense bonding {{arose in the}} breed because the dogs were selected to work in proximity to their masters on small fishing boats, unlike other working dogs such as herding dogs and water dogs that range out to perform tasks. In any case, the modern PWD, whether employed on a boat or kept as a pet or a working dog, loves water and attention and prefers {{to be engaged in}} activity within sight of a human partner. This is not a breed to <b>be</b> <b>left</b> <b>alone</b> for long periods of time, indoors or out.|$|E
25|$|A mysterious man, Griffin, {{arrives at}} the local inn of the English village of Iping, West Sussex, during a snowstorm. The {{stranger}} wears a long-sleeved, thick coat and gloves; his face is hidden entirely by bandages except for a fake pink nose; and he wears a wide-brimmed hat. He is excessively reclusive, irascible, and unfriendly. He demands to <b>be</b> <b>left</b> <b>alone</b> and {{spends most of his}} time in his rooms working with a set of chemicals and laboratory apparatus, only venturing out at night. While Griffin is staying at the inn, hundreds of strange glass bottles (that he calls his luggage) arrive. Many local townspeople believe this to be very strange. He becomes the talk of the village with many theorizing as to his origins.|$|E
25|$|The {{night the}} King collapsed, {{she refused to}} <b>be</b> <b>left</b> <b>alone</b> with him and {{successfully}} insisted that she be given her own bedroom. When the doctor, Warren, was called, she was not informed and was not {{given the opportunity to}} speak with him. When told by the Prince of Wales that the King was to be removed to Kew, but that she should move to Queens House or Windsor, she successfully insisted that she accompany her spouse to Kew. However, she and her daughters were taken to Kew separately from the King and lived secluded from him during his illness. They regularly visited him, but the visits tended to be uncomfortable, as he had a tendency to embrace them and refuse to let them go.|$|E
