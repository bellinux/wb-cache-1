40|$|The {{simplest}} truly non-trivial quantum {{systems have}} state spaces that are inherently two-complex dimensional, and have significantly more structure than the charge {{structure of the}} previous section, which could be analyzed by breaking up the space of states into one-dimensional subspaces of given charge. We’ll study these in this section, encountering {{for the first time}} the implications of working with representations of non-commutative groups. Since they give the simplest non-trivial realization of quantum phenomena, such systems are the fundamental objects of quantum information theory (the “qubit”) and the focus of attempts to build a quantum computer (which would <b>be</b> built <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>copies</b> <b>of</b> this sort of fundamental object). Many different possible two-state quantum systems could potentially be used as the physical implementation of a qubit. One of the simplest possibilities to take would be the idealized situation of a single electron, somehow fixed so that its spatial motion could be ignored, leaving its quantum state described just by its so-called “spin degree of freedom”, which takes values in H = C 2. The term “spin ” is supposed to call to mind the angular momentum of an object spinning about about some axis, but such classical physics has nothing to do with the qubit, it is a purely quantum system. We will see later that quantum systems can be defined with “spin quantum number ” N/ 2, for N = 0, 1, 2, 3, [...] . with dimension of the state space given by N + 1. The N = 0 case is the trivial case, and the case at hand is N = 1, the “spin 1 / 2 ” case. In the limit N → ∞ one can make contact with classical notions of spinning objects and angular momentum, but the spin 1 / 2 case is at the other limit, where the behavior is purely quantum...|$|R

40|$|The {{means of}} {{producing}} {{information and the}} infrastructure for disseminating it are constantly changing. The web mobilizes information in electronic formats, {{making it easier to}} copy, modify, remix, and redistribute. This has changed how information is produced, distributed, and used. People are not just consuming information; they are actively producing, remixing, and sharing information, using the web as a platform for creativity and production. This is true of software development as well. It is frequently commented by programmers and researchers who study software development, that programmers frequently copy and paste code. Although this practice is widely acknowledged, it is rarely studied directly, or explicitly accounted for in models of software development. However, this attitude is changing as software becomes more ubiquitous, and software development practice shifts away from the formal models of software engineering, towards a post-modernist perspective. This study explores how source code snippets in programming books and on the web are changing software development practice. By examining program source code using clone detection algorithms, this study provides a comprehensive view <b>of</b> code <b>copying</b> across 6, 190 PHP-language applications. These data are used to explore the concept of a "remix" method of software production, where software and systems <b>are</b> built <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>copied</b> and pasted snippets of code. These findings are contrasted against both traditional models of information production coming from informetrics (e. g., authorship, citation analysis), and models from software engineering (e. g., the Lego Hypothesis). Explanations for observed phenomena are discussed borrowing metaphors from linguistics, which provide a richer explanation of copy-paste programming than offered by the Lego Hypothesis. The focus and findings of this study ultimately point to a pressing demand for further research centered on the notion of software as information. Software and software repositories hold a large amount of information about how it was produced, and how it is used, adapted, and maintained. Software informatics is proposed as an organizing label to study the science of information, practice, and communication around software. It studies the individual, collaborative, and social aspects of software production and use, spanning multiple representations of software from design, to source code, to application...|$|R
40|$|Reproduced in the “Gyokuyo” {{collection}} of Waka-poems, are 81 “Manyo” wakapoems, of which, {{in comparison with}} their originals appearing in the ancient handwritten <b>copies</b> <b>of</b> the “Manyo” Collection, some privately edited collections of ancient waka-poems, and also various emendations and commentaries of poems, 47 can be found to be identically the same with {{those found in the}} hand-written <b>copies</b> <b>of</b> the “Manyo” Collection and 7 can be ascertained to perfectly agree with those contained in the latter two categories of books, while 27 are worded in a way peculiar to the “Gyokuyo” Collection. As to the 47 poems in question, in spite of their above-stated agreement, their sources cant's be determined, so far as the existing ancient hand-written copies are concerned.

It only remains to be said that the latter 7, too, may have agreed solely for another reason not yet clarified. The last-mentioned 27 poems can be surmised to have been altered in their wording by Tamekane Kyogoku, the editor of the “Gyokuyo” Collection, but this problem will be deiscussed further in my paper to be published in future...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} we prove the Hurewicz theorem {{which states that}} the n-th {{homology}} and homotopy groups are isomorphic for an (n- 1) -connected topological space. There exists proofs of the Hurewicz theorem in which one constructs a concrete isomorphism between the spaces, but in this thesis we avoid the construction by transferring the problem {{to the realm of}} CW complexes and cellular structures by a technique known as cellular approximation. Combined with the cellular homology groups and related results this technique allows us to analyse the space on a cell-by-cell basis. This reduces the problem significantly and gives rise to many methods not applicable otherwise. To prove the theorem we lay <b>out</b> the foundations <b>of</b> homotopy theory and homology theory. The singular homology theory is introduced, which in turn is used together with the concept of degree to define the cellular homology groups suitable for the analysis of CW complexes. Since CW complexes <b>are</b> built <b>out</b> <b>of</b> homeomorphic <b>copies</b> <b>of</b> the open unit disk extending to its boundary, it became crucial to prove various properties of these subspaces in both homotopy and homology. Fibrations, fiber bundles, and the Freudenthal suspension theorem were introduced for the homotopical viewpoint, while long exact sequences and contractibility played a great role in the homological considerations. CW approximation then made it possible to apply all this machinery to the topological space in question. Finally, the boundary homomorphisms from the long exact sequence in both homotopy and cellular homology theory turn <b>out</b> to <b>be</b> the same which makes it possible to show the existence of an isomorphism between the groups...|$|R

5000|$|The bigger bodies (the {{first ten}} dolls) were {{designed}} to resemble typical neighborhood children at play. The name Liddle Kiddles was actually taken from the words [...] "little kid". Each of the first 24 dolls had detailed clothing and accessories that perfectly matched their theme and size. Wire skeletons inside the vinyl bodies enabled the dolls to be posed and re-posed realistically. The first series of 9 Liddle Kiddle dolls plus 1 special doll set available only through the Sears and Roebuck Christmas Catalog, were concieved in 1965 and released to toy shelves in 1966. The following year additional dolls {{were added to the}} Liddle Kiddle series, and the Storybook Kiddles series and Smaller Lucky Locket Kiddle series were introduced. The small 2-inch dolls, however, had no wires inside for posing and, unlike the first 10, and the new Storybook Kiddles, their clothes were not removable. The year after that, 1968, the last 6 additions to the Liddle Kiddles series were added, as well as 3 more Storybook Kiddles, and new Skediddle Kiddles that could walk, the very popular Kologne Kiddle series, and the itty bitty tiniest Kiddles of them all -- Jewelry Kiddles. Parents and children were delighted and intrigued by the ability of Mattel Designers to keep making the dolls smaller and yet maintain the use of real hair and clothes. Mattel also released a series of 4 2 inch tall kiddles dressed up in animal costumes and called Animiddles. Ride and Run Skediddle sets consisting of a Skediddle walking doll and specially designed riding toys they could also use were introduced to the Skediddle Kiddle series. 3 new Kiddle Kolognes were added. More Lucky Locket Kiddles were released in pretty new pastel locket colors.1969 saw a new series of 2 inch sized Storybook Sweetheart Kiddles, portraying famous star crossed lovers, such as Romeo and Juliet, and Robin Hood and Maid Marion.Also that year Mattel introduced the Kozmic Kiddle series of 4 glow in the dark adorable aliens in groovy space ships, the Tea Party Kiddles portaying little girls dressing up as fancy ladies, each coming with a fancy child sized tea cup and saucer. The very popular Zoolery Kiddles were also released. These were 4 teensy animals {{about the size of the}} previous years Jewelry Kiddles that came in tiny cages that could be worn as Jewelry. There were additional Ride and Run Skediddles added to that series too! And Lucky Locket Kiddles were re-released in bright gold lockets that collectors refer to as [...] "Gold Rush" [...] lockets. A very busy year for Mattels Kiddle Doll Line!By the time 1970 rolled around there was a global oil crisis taking shape and plastics, and especially vinyl which is derived from petroleum based products, was getting harder and more expensive for toy companies to buy.Mattel still released some Kiddles that year, but drastic cuts would ultimately lead to restructuring of what doll lines would continue and Barbie and her family were the star performers of the doll lines. Kiddles were discontinued at this time. Many design concepts for new kiddles and several new series were killed and never made it to production. Mattel records from the time were painstakingly researched by Paris Langford for the creation of her Liddle Kiddles value guide released in 1996. In this amazing and extensive book Paris included original concept art and a section showing pictures of prototype dolls that actually were under way at the time that Mattel killed the line. Especially interesting were the new concepts for fresh Jewelry Kiddle series, some dressed as bumble bees or tiny mermaids. The Bigger Body dolls with wire skeletons had a series under way centered around Circus Performers. Many of these records have since been destroyed according to Mattel. Paris Langfords value guide now stands as one of the final records of these lost designs that never made it into production. Though the book <b>is</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> print, <b>copies</b> do surface on the secondary market and owning a copy enhances any Kiddle collection.|$|R
