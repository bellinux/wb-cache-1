5|$|The first combat {{involving}} battlecruisers during World War I was the Battle of Heligoland <b>Bight</b> in August 1914. A {{force of}} British light cruisers and destroyers entered the Heligoland <b>Bight</b> (the {{part of the}} North Sea closest to Hamburg) to attack German destroyer patrols. When they met opposition from light cruisers, Vice Admiral David Beatty took his squadron of five battlecruisers into the <b>Bight</b> and turned the tide of the battle, ultimately sinking three German light cruisers and killing their commander, Rear Admiral Leberecht Maass.|$|E
5|$|After her commissioning, München was {{employed}} as a torpedo test ship and to conduct experiments with wireless telegraphy. After the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, the ship {{was assigned to the}} High Seas Fleet. She was moored in Brunsbüttel with her sister-ship , en route to Kiel via the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal on the morning of 28 August 1914. That morning, the British attacked the German patrol line in the Heligoland <b>Bight.</b> During the ensuing Battle of Heligoland <b>Bight,</b> München and Danzig were recalled and ordered to steam to the mouth of the Elbe and wait for further orders. At 12:25, the two cruisers were ordered to move into the <b>Bight</b> and support the cruiser , but at 14:06, München was instead ordered to conduct reconnaissance out to the north-east of Heligoland.|$|E

After the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, she was used to patrol the Heligoland <b>Bight.</b> On 28 August, the British Royal Navy attacked the patrol line, and in the ensuing Battle of Heligoland <b>Bight,</b> a pair of battlecruisers attacked and sank Ariadne. Some 200 of her crew were killed in the battle; only 59 survivors were pulled from the sea.|$|E

5|$|During {{the first}} month of the war the Royal Air Force (RAF) mostly focused its bomber attacks against anti-shipping {{operations}} on the German <b>Bight.</b> RAF bombers mounted a heavy attack against shipping off Wilhelmshaven on 18 December 1939 in what became {{to be known as the}} Battle of the Heligoland <b>Bight.</b> Twenty-four twin-engine Vickers Wellington from No. 9 Squadron, No. 37 Squadron and No. 149 Squadron formed up over Norfolk heading for the island of Heligoland. Two aircraft aborted the mission due to mechanical defects, but the remaining 22 pursued the attack and were spotted by a Freya radar on the East Frisian Islands.|$|E
5|$|German minesweepers and escorting light cruisers were {{attempting}} to clear British-laid minefields in the Heligoland <b>Bight</b> in late 1917. The Admiralty planned a large operation for 17 November to destroy the ships, and allocated two light cruiser squadrons and the 1st Cruiser Squadron covered by the reinforced 1st Battlecruiser Squadron and, more distantly, the 1st Battle Squadron of battleships. New Zealand {{was attached to the}} 1st BCS for this operation, which became known as the Second Battle of Heligoland <b>Bight.</b> New Zealand did not fire her guns during the battle. As in previous engagements, Captain Green wore the piupiu and tiki for luck.|$|E
5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War I in August 1914, Niobe was recommissioned for coastal defense, stationed in the German <b>Bight.</b> Between 28 August to 2 September, and from 23 December, Niobes commander also served as {{the commander of the}} torpedo-boat flotillas defending the Jade <b>Bight</b> and the mouth of the Weser. She was removed from front-line service on 5 September 1915, and her crew was reduced four days later. The commander of the torpedo-boat flotillas returned to Niobe on 14 January 1916, as his previous flagship, the old coastal defense ship , was decommissioned. Niobe nevertheless remained in service with a reduced crew. Kommodore (Commodore) Ludwig von Reuter, the commander of the IV Scouting Group, and his staff briefly used Niobe as a headquarters ship, from 6 June to 3 July. Starting on 20 August, she became the headquarters ship for now-Konteradmiral (Rear Admiral) von Hipper, the commander of the I Scouting Group.|$|E
2500|$|Jost {{argued that}} {{control over the}} death of the {{individual}} must ultimately belong to the social organism, the state.

In contrast, Jost was pointing to the state's right to kill.... Ultimately the argument was biological: 'The rights to death [...] the key to the fitness of life.'
