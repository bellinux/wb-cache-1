50|$|A common urban legend states that, {{faced with}} the fact that <b>ball-point</b> <b>pens</b> would not write in zero-gravity, NASA spent a large amount of money to develop a pen that would write in the {{conditions}} experienced during spaceflight (the result purportedly being the Fisher Space Pen), while the Soviet Union took the simpler and cheaper route of just using pencils. The Fisher Space Pen was actually developed independently and privately in the 1960s.|$|E

50|$|Another approach, e.g. Computervision's Interact I, {{involved}} attaching <b>ball-point</b> <b>pens</b> to drafting pantographs {{and driving}} the machines with stepper motors {{controlled by the}} computer. This had the disadvantage of being somewhat slow to move, as well as requiring floor space equal {{to the size of}} the paper, but could double as a digitizer. A later change was the addition of an electrically controlled clamp to hold the pens, which allowed them to be changed, and thus create multi-colored output.|$|E

5000|$|During the 1940s and 1950s, {{fountain}} pens retained their dominance: early ballpoint pens were expensive, were prone to leaks and had irregular inkflow, while the fountain pen continued {{to benefit from}} the combination of mass production and craftsmanship.(Bíró's patent, and other early patents on <b>ball-point</b> <b>pens</b> often used the term [...] "ball-point fountain pen," [...] because at the time the ball-point pen was considered a type of fountain pen; that is, a pen that held ink in an enclosed reservoir.)This period saw the launch of innovative models such as the Parker 51, the Aurora 88, the Sheaffer Snorkel, and the Eversharp Skyline and (later) Skyliner, while the Esterbrook J series of lever-fill models with interchangeable steel nibs offered inexpensive reliability to the masses.|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} an attempt to {{determine}} the optimum shape and size for the shank design of <b>ball-point</b> <b>pens.</b> A total of 9 pens and 27 subjects were used. Drawing performance was measured by having the subjects follow a maze of different size. The dependent variables were drawing speed and drawing “accuracy”. The results indicate the following: 1. The smaller size of pen makes the least number of errors (best accuracy) during drawing. 2. The smaller size of pen has the lowest speed 3. The hexagonal cross-section is the worst for accuracy, when compared with the circular and elliptical sections. Even though larger size pens tend to be preferred by users, their performance in terms of accuracy tends to be low. The proper selection of a pen depends on its usage, and expectation. Objective specifications on drawing pens giving accuracy and speed for a standardized task would be extremely valuable to artists and designers who may need a specified level of accuracy during free-hand sketching...|$|E
40|$|The {{success of}} these {{monetary}} incentives is generally attributed {{to the fact that}} they are unconditional rather than conditional. Potential respondents receive the incentive even if they do not take part in the survey, but are assumed to be more willing to participate because compliance is seen as the repayment of a gift or favor. However, in 1998 New Zealand postal legislation was changed to prohibit the sending of currency by mail. Thus, the practice of including 50 cents, $ 1 or $ 2 as an incentive in mail surveys is no longer legal. Furthermore, some organizations, such as charities or voluntary groups, may consider monetary incentives inappropriate for surveys of their members, and it is also common in a number of countries for government departments to be prohibited from using monetary incentives in surveys they commission. With mail survey response rates declining, the question is whether alternative incentives can be found that are legal and practical, and are as effective as small, prepaid monetary incentives. This article reports the results of studies designed to answer this question. DIFFERENT TYPES OF INCENTIVES UNCONDITIONAL INCENTIVES Unconditional nonmonetary incentives that have been tested in mail surveys include <b>ball-point</b> <b>pens,</b> key rings, phone cards, postage stamps, trading stamps, tea bags, ‘scratch and win ’ tickets, coffee sachets, football team pins, redeemable discount coupons and, in one extreme case, small pocket calculators (Brennan, 1958; Pucel...|$|E
50|$|The {{panel is}} Dürer's second {{treatment}} of Lucretia, following {{a very similar}} 1508 drawing. Art historians tend not to view {{it as one of}} his best paintings, and it is often compared, unfavourably, to a similar work by Lucas Cranach the Elder. However, art historians see the Dürer as a less formal treatment, more inward and concerned with confronting death and dying. Between 1959-60, Alberto Giacometti completed a Sketch after Durer's Lucretia using <b>ball-point</b> <b>pen</b> on paper.|$|R

40|$|The Autopoint {{company was}} founded around 1920 in Chicago. The founders pioneered using molded plastic to make {{mechanical}} pencils. In the mid 1920 s, the Bakelite Corporation took over ownership of Autopoint. Over the next 50 years Autopoint had several different corporate owners, but {{it continued to}} operate as a stand-alone company with its own officers, employees, manufacturing plant, sales force, etc. By 1966 Autopoint had developed an extensive product line of pencils, <b>ball-point</b> <b>pens,</b> desk top accessories, and specialty advertising products like cigarette lighters and pocket knives. They got much of their business as a job shop manufacturing personalized pencils, pens, and the like advertising businesses. One interesting illustration {{of that sort of}} use is a pencil listing business-card type information about Sol Sulman, the president of Autopoint. (p. 46) The inside cover of this catalog shows the logos of numerous companies Autopoint had done business with. The catalog contains tables showing pricing information for various quantities of pencils ordered. Substantial discounts were offered for thousands of pencils ordered at once. Since this is a loose-leaf catalog, pages could be easily added to it. One interesting addition is a page advertising pencils using ultra thin (“UTL”), 0. 5 mm, lead. These new pencils were obviously introduced in response to competition from Japanese companies selling the newly introduced 0. 5 mm lead. Elsewhere in the catalog, lead sizes are shown in fractions of an inch. “Standard” (0. 45 inch) lead was the industry standard for mechanical pencils when Autopoint was founded. “Real Thin” (0. 36 mm) lead had been introduced in 1938. Also, Autopoint sold some marker type pencils with. 076 inch (“Thick”) lead. The catalog has been modified by pasting in pricing information on the previously printed pages. Many of the pages were changed that way...|$|E

40|$|We have {{developed}} a pen and writing tablet for use by subjects during fMRI scanning. The pen consists of two jacketed, multi-mode optical fibers routed {{to the tip of}} a hollowed-out <b>ball-point</b> <b>pen.</b> The pen has been further modified by addition of a plastic plate to maintain a perpendicular pen-tablet orientation. The tablet is simply a non-metallic frame holding a paper print of continuously varying color gradients. The optical fibers are routed out of the MRI bore to a light-tight box in an adjacent control room. Within the box, light from a high intensity LED is coupled into one of the fibers, while the other fiber abuts a color sensor. Light from the LED exits the pen tip, illuminating a small spot on the tablet, and the resulting reflected light is routed to the color sensor. Given a lookup table of position for each color on the tablet, the coordinates of the pen on the tablet may be displayed and digitized in real-time. While simple and inexpensive, the system achieves sufficient resolution to grade writing tasks testing dysgraphic and dyslexic phenomena...|$|R
