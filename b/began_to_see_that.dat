Louis of Savoy invaded in spring of 1449, and Sforza sent Colleoni (who had earlier defected) to defeat him at Borgomanero, leading to an uneasy peace. Sforza also faced treachery within his own ranks, added {{with the fact that}} he rashly {{accepted}} the defection of his great enemies the Piccinino brothers, who, upon gaining access to Monza, promptly returned it to Milan.|$|E

[...] The young Kansan, who had been swindled by an unscrupulous {{superintendent}} of mines, had a plan to rustle cattle and horses from the superintendent and sell them to Curly Bill (William Brocius), an outlaw {{with whom he had}} indirectly been in contact. Both men were broke at the time, and the job sounded easy. But Burnham had always rejected the life of a thief and even as a wanted man, he did not view himself as a criminal. Burnham <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> even though he joined the feud to help his friends, {{he had been in the}} wrong, that [...] "avenging only led to more vengeance and to even greater injustice than that suffered through the often unjustly administered laws of the land." ...|$|E
500|$|Steinbeck enjoyed {{writing the}} book; {{it was a}} {{challenge}} to apply his novel-writing skills to a scientific subject. However, he doubted from an early stage that the book would sell well. He considered {{it would be a good}} read, but not for the [...] "take-a-book-to-bed public". As he progressed further, he <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> the book would have very limited appeal, but equally he was convinced that it was a good book and the best work he had done. He was happy that it took his writing in a new direction and would confound the attempts of the critics to pigeonhole him, and, with a slightly masochistic joy he looked forward to their [...] "rage and contempt". In that, he was proved incorrect; the reviews were mixed, but largely favorable, focusing on his affirmation of humankind's place in the wider environment, and picking up on the excitement Steinbeck and Ricketts felt for their subject.John Steinbeck: The Contemporary Reviews pp.201–13 Most felt that even though there were moments when Steinbeck was at his best, the blending of philosophy, travelogue and biological recording made for an uneven read: ...|$|E

While previous treatments attempted to reduce androgen levels via chemical castration, Kafka uses drugs that regulate monoamines such as dopamine and norepinephrine, but especially serotonin. He states that [...] "sexual deviance {{is linked to}} an as-yet-unidentified disregulation affecting the serotonin system." [...] After treating a sex offender {{among a group of}} people diagnosed with eating disorders, Kafka connected the two: [...] "I <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> the sex offenders were just like the bulimics.

2500|$|Stone was {{introduced}} to Gary Kellgren, a recording engineer working at several New York City recording studios on sessions for musicians such as Frank Zappa and Jimi Hendrix. Stone and Kellgren met because Kellgren's wife Marta was seven months pregnant and scared of the upcoming birth. Mutual friends thought that the two couples could talk about being parents and ease Marta's worry. Though they were [...] "diametrically opposed" [...] in nature, with Stone all business and Kellgren very creative, the two quickly became friends. During his lunch hours, Stone visited Kellgren in the studio, and <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> Kellgren was not {{making full use of}} his genius. Stone noticed that Kellgren was getting only 4 percent of the money that studios were charging, and he helped Kellgren raise that to 20 percent.|$|E

[...] Their [...] "postwar culture was being turned upside down" [...] as polio became the [...] "crack in the fantasy" [...] of a suburban home [...] "bursting with children." [...] Parents <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> there would be an alternative, however: [...] "Since worry did no good and quarantine seemed fruitless, parents might best protect their children by helping others to discover a vaccine against polio, and, perhaps, even a cure."
