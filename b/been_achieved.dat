5|$|Despite {{penetrations}} inland, the key beach objectives had not <b>been</b> <b>achieved.</b> The draws {{necessary for}} the movement of vehicles off the beach had not been opened, and the strongpoints defending these were still putting up a spirited resistance.

5|$|Resolution of DKA {{is defined}} as general {{improvement}} in the symptoms, {{such as the ability}} to tolerate oral nutrition and fluids, normalization of blood acidity (pH>7.3), and absence of ketones in blood (<1 mmol/l) or urine.

50|$|The {{object of}} the game is to be the first player to achieve 100% success, this <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> by {{reaching}} the top of four goals. The goals are wealth, happiness, education and career. Wealth <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> by having a certain level of money in the bank, shares and cash in the hand, the player normally would earn this money by going to work. Happiness <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> by achieving other goals, acquiring goods and taking time off work. Education <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> by completing the available university qualifications, the number of qualifications the player must complete will be dependent on how high the goal level is set. Career <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> by climbing the career ladder into a management position in a particular job.|$|R
5|$|A {{modus vivendi}} had <b>been</b> <b>achieved</b> between Warwick {{and the king}} for some months, but the {{restoration}} of Henry Percy to Montagu's earldom of Northumberland prevented any chance of full reconciliation. A trap was set for the king when disturbances in Lincolnshire led him north, where he could be confronted by Warwick's men. Edward, however, discovered the plot when Robert, Lord Welles, was routed at Losecote Field, and gave away the plan.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving the}} Army, Bachelder became a {{research}} chemist at the University of Chicago, {{where the first}} self-sustaining nuclear reaction had <b>been</b> <b>achieved</b> in 1942. Nobel Laureate James Franck had been Director of the Chemistry Division of the Metallurgical Laboratory during the earlier phases of the Manhattan Project. Bachelder joined the University's Institute for the Study of Metals (renamed as the James Franck Institute in 1967), and she conducted further research in metallochemistry.|$|E
5|$|After the Colts owner Jim Irsay hired Tony Dungy in 2002, the Colts {{made the}} playoffs for nine {{straight}} seasons.

5|$|Another {{result of}} the coup was that the work {{that had been done}} by British {{intelligence}} with the anti-Axis government of Cvetković and Maček was lost. By supporting the coup plotters, the SOE undermined the balance in Yugoslav politics that had <b>been</b> <b>achieved</b> by the Cvetković–Maček Agreement. Serb nationalists supported and welcomed the coup because it ended Croatian autonomy under the Agreement and freed them to pursue a Greater Serbia agenda. The coup and its immediate aftermath also contributed to the paralysis within the Yugoslav government-in-exile {{during the rest of the}} war, due to ongoing disputes regarding the legitimacy of the Cvetković–Maček Agreement.|$|E
5|$|As a countermeasure, {{cultures}} of the nematode Deladenus siricidicola {{have been used as}} biological control to protect trees since the 1980s. This parasite feeds on the mycelia of A.areolatum and is therefore a food competitor of wood wasp larvae. Where S.noctilio larvae are present, the parasite infects and sterilizes the eggs of female wasps, causing them to be infertile. These infertile females lay infected eggs into new trees and thus spread the nematode. This control method has proven to be relatively successful to combat the Sirex–Amylostereum complex. In the Southern Hemisphere, where the technique has been widely employed, reductions of parasitism levels of 70%–100% have <b>been</b> <b>achieved.</b>|$|E
5|$|Basil II is {{considered}} among the most capable Byzantine emperors and his reign as {{the apex of the}} empire in the Middle Ages. By 1025, the date of Basil II's death, the Byzantine Empire stretched from Armenia in the east to Calabria in Southern Italy in the west. Many successes had <b>been</b> <b>achieved,</b> ranging from the conquest of Bulgaria to the annexation of parts of Georgia and Armenia, and the reconquest of Crete, Cyprus, and the important city of Antioch. These were not temporary tactical gains but long-term reconquests.|$|E

5|$|Despite its aims, the Committee was {{in large}} part {{responsible}} for {{the ease with which}} the Germans could implement their policies in Belgium and was unable to moderate many German policies, such as deportation of workers to Germany (though delayed to October 1942) or the persecution of Jews. In particular, encouraging the Germans to delegate tasks to the Committee meant that the Germans were effectively using the established national civil service, which allowed much more efficient implementation than could have <b>been</b> <b>achieved</b> by force. Since Belgium was also dependent on Germany for the imports of food it needed, the Committee was always at a disadvantage during negotiations.|$|E
5|$|He {{promptly}} {{became the}} Yankees' best pitcher, recording the highest winning percentage in the AL {{in his first}} season as a Yankee. In 1949, joined by Vic Raschi and Eddie Lopat, he was a star of a Yankee team that won the first of five consecutive league championships, a feat that had never <b>been</b> <b>achieved</b> before. He played many important roles for those teams. In his first six years with the Yankees he averaged over 232 innings, 17.5 wins, and 14 complete games. As a swingman, he averaged 26 games started and 9 games finished per season.|$|E
5|$|Kluge {{ordered the}} attack to be {{mounted on the}} night of 6/7 August. To avoid {{alerting}} American forces to the attack, there would be no preparatory artillery bombardments. The intention was to hit the U.S. 30th Infantry Division, commanded by Major-General Leland Hobbs, east of Mortain, then cut through American defenses to reach the coast. Had surprise <b>been</b> <b>achieved,</b> the attack might well have succeeded, but Allied decoders at Ultra had intercepted and decrypted the orders for Operation Lüttich by August 4. As a result, Bradley was able to obtain air support from both the US 9th Air Force and the RAF.|$|E

50|$|To {{allow for}} the {{systematic}} integration of the pragmatic and dialectical dimensions {{in the study of}} argumentation, the pragma-dialectical theory uses four meta-theoretical principles as its point of departure: functionalization, socialization, externalization and dialectification. Functionalization <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> by treating discourse as a purposive act. Socialization <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> by extending the speech act perspective to the level of interaction. Externalization <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> by capturing the propositional and interactional commitments created by the speech acts performed. And dialectification <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> by regimenting the exchange of speech acts to an ideal model of a critical discussion. (see Van Eemeren & Grootendorst, 2004, pp.52-53).|$|R
