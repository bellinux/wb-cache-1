5|$|Triceratops has an {{extended}} cameo, <b>being</b> <b>sick</b> with an unidentified disease. Its appearance {{was a particular}} logistical nightmare for Stan Winston when Spielberg asked to shoot the animatronic of the sick creature earlier than expected. The model, operated by eight puppeteers in the Kaua'i set, wound up being the first dinosaur filmed during production. Winston also created a baby Triceratops for Ariana Richards to ride on, a scene cut from the film for pacing reasons. Gary Rydstrom combined the sound of himself breathing into a cardboard tube with the cows near his workplace at Skywalker Ranch to create the Triceratops vocals.|$|E

25|$|These {{individuals}} {{may be trying}} to reenact unresolved issues with their parents. A history of frequent illnesses may also {{contribute to the development of}} this disorder. In some cases, individuals afflicted with FD are accustomed to actually <b>being</b> <b>sick,</b> and thus return to their previous state to recapture what they once considered the 'norm.' Another cause is a history of close contact with someone (a friend or family member) who had a severe or chronic condition. The patients found themselves subconsciously envious of the attention said relation received, and felt that they themselves faded into the background. Thus medical attention makes them feel glamorous and special.|$|E
25|$|It {{is worthy}} of record here in this connection, that while Rev.

25|$|MRSA is {{a common}} type of {{bacteria}} that is normally found on the skin of people and cats. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is the same bacterium that has become resistant to some antibiotics. Cats and other animals often can carry MRSA without <b>being</b> <b>sick,</b> but MRSA can cause a variety of infections, including of the skin, respiratory tract, and urinary tract of people. MRSA can be transmitted {{back and forth between}} people and animals through direct contact. In people, MRSA most often causes skin infections that can range from mild to severe. If left untreated, MRSA can spread to the bloodstream or lungs and cause life-threatening infections.|$|E
25|$|During {{this time}} Cherish {{was the only}} female group on select dates, as the opening act for Chris Brown's Up Close & Personal Tour, along with Ne-Yo, Lil Wayne, Julez Santana and Dem Franchize Boyz, which ran from August to October.

However, Cherish then embarked on a European promotional tour in November, and finished up the year with a few Jingle Jam shows in December.|$|E
25|$|In 1965 Tom Kabu {{became the}} first Papuan BahÃ¡'Ã­. Approximately twenty Papuans became BahÃ¡'Ã­s in Port Moresby {{immediately}} after Kabu who were from the Baimuru area. Kabu traveled among many villages presenting the religion. Yale University professor Charles Forman analyzed religious trends across the Pacific Islands and attributes what he termed the surprising growth of the BahÃ¡'Ã­ Faith across Micronesia was partly due to {{a certain amount of}} response from some youths of wider experience and education as well as from some village folk among whom BahÃ¡'Ã­s settled. Probably the greatest single increase, in his view, came in 1966 with this effort as Kabu was a leader of an important modernising movement in the Purari River area of Papua. Kabu died in 1969 from tuberculosis after <b>being</b> <b>sick</b> about a year.|$|E
40|$|Purpose. The aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} differences in self-reported work ability, work conditions, health and function between ICD- 10 groups with musculoskeletal disorders (MSD), mental disorders (MDs) and MSD+MD and to determine which variables are associated with sick leave. Method. A cross-sectional study of 210 employees was conducted at an occupational health service unit. Physiotherapists and physicians classified the employeesâ€™ health problems according to ICD- 10 and the employees answered a questionnaire with questions on demographic variables, health, functioning, work ability and work conditions. Results. Forty-four per cent of the employees had MSD, 22 % had MD and 34 % had a MSD+MD. The group on sick leave had worse results for all health and work measures. Belonging to the MD group, belonging to the MSD+MD group, having poor work ability and functioning were associated with <b>being</b> on <b>sick</b> leave. The value for the model explaining <b>being</b> on <b>sick</b> leave was 0. 63 (Nagelkerke R 2). Conclusions. Having a diagnosis of MD based on a professional opinion and having poor work ability and functioning based on self-reports are associated with <b>being</b> on <b>sick</b> leave. The results suggest that self-reported data could be used to complement the expert-based diagnosis.

25|$|Of the Japanese losses {{the unit}} that {{suffered}} the lowest percentage of casualties {{was in the}} 105th Independent Mixed Brigade, of 4,173 men more than 2,000 got across the Sittang. The 13th Naval Guard Force was annihilated, with {{only a handful of}} its original 600 men escaping. A substantial number, at least 70 and perhaps more, deserted while still in the Pegu Yomas. This force suffered the heaviest casualties of any formation in this costly operation. The 54th Division had suffered huge losses, more than 5,000 were lost breaking out across the Sittang. Of the 9,000 men of the 55th division that started the break-out, fewer than 4,000 made it to the Tenasserim. Out of 18,000 men directly controlled by Twenty-eighth Army less than 6,000 in total managed to reach the east bank of the Sittang.

25|$|Transylvania {{united with}} Romania on December 1, 1918, but PuÈ™cariu {{was unable to}} attend the festivities at Alba Iulia, <b>being</b> <b>sick</b> {{in bed with a}} case of {{influenza}} he had caught at IaÈ™i. Following this event, which marked the culmination of Greater Romania's creation, he was named the first rector of the Superior Dacia University in Cluj. A Franz Joseph University already existed in the city, but its Hungarian faculty departed as a bloc and an entirely new professorial corps and administrative structure were required. The revamped university had two founders, the idealistic Ghibu and the more practical PuÈ™cariu. Chosen by the Directing Council, Transylvania's provisional government, the latter headed a twenty-man committee charged with the seemingly insurmountable task of setting up four faculties (Literature and Philosophy, Medicine, Science, Law) and recruiting professors within a few months. As a native Transylvanian, PuÈ™cariu was familiar with the Austro-Hungarian milieu; he also had relations with academics in Western Europe and was close to a number of figures in the Old Kingdom, especially Nicolae Iorga. Set up in July 1919, the committee included twelve professors from the Universities of IaÈ™i and Bucharest, and eight Transylvanians.|$|E
