40|$|Skin {{cancer is}} {{the most common type of}} cancer in fair-skinned populations. Cutaneous {{squamous}} cell carcinoma (SCC) comprises about 15 % of all skin cancer diagnoses. Treatment associated with the high and rising prevalence of cutaneous SCC puts an increasingly high financial burden on society, marking a pressing need for advancements in skin cancer drug development. For screening of novel therapeutics, representative models of human cutaneous SCC are required. The aim of the research described in this thesis was to develop a representative in vitro model of human SCC for screening therapeutics, without the unnecessary use of animals. To this end, we generated three-dimensional in vitro SCC models in which the malignant epidermal cancer cells were either represented by intact primary human cutaneous or by established, spontaneously immortalized cutaneous SCC cell lines. The dermal microenvironment in our models was seeded with either primary normal human dermal fibroblasts or primary SCC-associated fibroblasts. In verifying human cutaneous SCC representation by these in vitro models, we focused on hyperproliferation, cytological and architectural atypia and invasion as three main features of primary SCC. The in vitro skin cancer models presented in this thesis add to the spectrum of available in vitro models for therapeutic screening. Promotor: R. Willemze, Co-Promotores: A. El Ghalbzouri C. P.

40|$|Abstract Background Improved {{sensitivity}} of HBV-DNA tests is {{of critical importance}} {{for the management of}} HBV infection. Our aim was to develop and assess a new ultra sensitive in-house real-time PCR assay for HBV-DNA quantification (ultra sensitive RTQ-PCR). Results Previously used HBV-DNA standards were calibrated against the WHO 1 st International Standard for HBV-DNA (OptiQuant ® HBV-DNA Quantification Panel, Accrometrix <b>Europe</b> <b>B.</b> <b>V.).</b> The 95 % and 50 % HBV-DNA detection end-point of the assay were 22. 2 and 8. 4 IU/mL. According to the calibration results, 1 IU/mL equals 2. 8 copies/mL. Importantly the clinical performance of the ultra sensitive real-time PCR was tested similar (67 %) to the Procleix Ultrio discriminatory HBV test (dHBV) (70 %) in low-titer samples from patients with occult Hepatitis B. Finally, in the comparison of ultra sensitive RTQ-PCR with the commercially available COBAS TaqMan HBV Test, the in-house assay identified 94. 7 % of the 94 specimens as positive versus 90. 4 % identified by TaqMan, while the quantitative results that were positive by both assay were strongly correlated (r = 0. 979).

The food ‘Nutrimune®’ (a pasteurised cow’s skim milk fermented with Lactobacillus paracasei CBA L 74) which is the subject of the health claim is sufficiently characterised. The Panel considers that immune defence against pathogens in GI tract and URT is a beneficial physiological effect. One human intervention study from which conclusions can be drawn showed an effect of ‘Nutrimune®’ on immune defence against pathogens in the GI tract and the URT, and the results from one animal study could support an effect of ‘Nutrimune®’ on defence against pathogens in the GI tract. However, there were inconsistencies in the reporting of the process and criteria used for the diagnosis of URTI in the human intervention study, {{the results of this study}} have not been replicated, and no evidence was provided for a plausible mechanism by which ‘Nutrimune®’ could exert the claimed effect in vivo in humans.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the vertical misfit between different brands of dental implants and prosthetic abutments, {{with or without}} mechanical torque, and to study their possible combination. Study design: Five different brands of implant {{were used in the}} study: Biofit (Castemaggiore, Italy), Bioner S. A. (Barcelona, Spain), 3 i Biomet (Palm Beach, U. S. A.), BTI (Alava, Spain) and Nobel Biocare (Göteborg, Sweden), with standard 4. 1 mm heads and external hexagons, and their respective machined prosthetic abutments. The implant-to- abutment fit/misfit was evaluated at four points (vestibular, lingual/palatine, mesial and distal) between implants and abutments of the same brand and different brands, with or without mechanical torque, using SEM micrographs at 5000 X. Image analysis was performed using NIS-Elements software (Nikon Instruments <b>Europe</b> <b>B.</b> <b>V.).</b> Results: Before applying torque, vertical misfit (microgaps) of the different combinations tested varied between 1. 6 and 5. 4 microns and after applying torque, between 0. 9 and 5. 9 microns, an overall average of 3. 46 ± 2. 96 microns. For manual assembly without the use of mechanical torque, the best results were obtained with the com - bination of the 3 i implant and the BTI abutment. The Nobel implant and Nobel abutment, 3 i- 3 i and BTI-BTI and the combination of 3 i implant with BTI or Nobel abutment provided the best vertical fit when mechanical torque was applied. Conclusions: The vertical fits obtained were within the limits considered clinically acceptable. The application of mechanical torque improved outcomes. There is compatibility between implants and abutments of different brand and so their combination is a clinical possibility...|$|R

One of the most crucial parts of this is to understand the combined effects of nutrient availabilities and elevated CO 2 levels. Durum wheat (Triticum durum, Saricanak 98) and bread wheat (Triticum aestivum, Adana 99) plants were grown with adequate Mg-K and low Mg (75 and 150 μM) and low K (10 and 30 μM) supply in nutrient solution and under three different CO 2 conditions (ambient: 400 μmol mol- 1, elevated: 600 and 900 μmol mol- 1).

40|$|The present PhD Thesis {{is focused}} on the {{fabrication}} of hybrid scaffolds for bone regeneration through biomimetic mineralization of recombinant collagen peptide (RCP) in the presence of magnesium (Mg) to closely mimic ionic composition of bone apatite. RCP, produced by FUJIFILM Manufacturing <b>Europe</b> <b>B.</b> <b>V.</b> under tradename of CellnestTM, is based on human collagen type I and it is enriched in arginine-glycine-aspartic acid sequence (RGD), that acts as a cell binding site. Biomimetic mineralization of RCP has been adapted from the bioinspired mineralization protocol of natural collagen carried out previously by our group to obtain bone-like scaffolds. Inspired in nanocomposite nature of bone, hybrid scaffolds were developed through a bottom-up approach that started on the evaluation of apatite mineralization mechanism in the presence of RCP and Mg and how it can affect the nanocrystal morphology and composition. Then, three-dimensional prototype scaffolds were developed through freeze-drying of mineralized slurry to determine optimum mineral content. Furthermore, the interfacial properties of mineralized matrices in the presence {{and in the absence of}} Mg were evaluated at nanoscopic level. Since RCP is water-soluble molecule, the use of crosslinking technologies (genipin and dehydrothermal treatment) to ensure the stability under physiological conditions as well as the resistance to enzymatic degradation was investigated. The subsequent step was the design of 3 D isotropic scaffolds with suitable pore size, porosity and permeability by modifying several freezing parameters during freeze-drying of mineralized RCP slurry. Finally, in vitro tests were carried out to evaluate how biochemical signals (i. e., surface chemistry and ion release from scaffold) together with biophysical signals (e. g., surface nano-topography) conferred via biomimetic mineralization can persuade and guide Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) interaction and fate.

The first case, entitled "How to Enter Emerging Markets in Central and Eastern Europe" is designed to evaluate the impact of the fall of the Iron Curtain on the business climate for foreign companies in this region {{as well as on the}} opportunities for local companies. The case study is also used to gain an understanding of why and how firms choose an alliance partner through an analysis of Whirlpool's and Tatramat's needs and intentions. It describes the situation in both Whirlpool Europe and in Tatramat at the beginning of the 1990 's. These two companies faced many problems and challenges at that time because of obstacles in their internal situations and changes in their external operational environment. After looking for the right partner and the right form of cooperation, and after evaluating all possibilities, they decided to negotiate with each other to find the right form of strategic alliance. This case can be used in courses dealing with the entry of companies on emerging markets of Central and Eastern Europe (e. g. World Economy, Corporate Strategy, International Business, Doing Business in Central and Eastern Europe, etc.) The second case, entitled "Management Aspects of the Operations within an Emerging Market" is focused on two issues: how to manage successfully the transition of a small local post-socialist company into an integrated and efficient part of Whirlpool's global network and how to market goods produced locally, as well as merchandise obtained from the global network, in a small local market. The case describes the operations of the joint venture Whirlpool-Tatramat, the initial struggles with production volume and quality, downsizing, building a local supplier network, a drop in demand, and the gradual process of the ownership change to eventually become Whirlpool's wholly-owned subsidiary and the final involvement of the company into Whirlpool's global network. This case can be used in courses dealing with special aspects of international expansion (e. g. International Management, doing Business in Central and Eastern Europe, etc.) ...|$|R

Photosynthesis rate (μmol CO 2 m- 2 s- 1) increased 18 % and 19. 6 % in Sarıçanak 98 and 15. 7 % and % 15. 3 in Adana 99 plants with 600 and 900 ppm CO 2 treatments respectively in the adequate Mg and K treatments, whereas although there was some increment in Mg and K deficient plants with [CO 2] elevation it was not important since overall photosynthesis rates were low in these plants in all three [CO 2] treatments. Leaf specific weight was much higher in Mg and K deficient plants compare to adequate Mg and K plants which may correspond possible defects in carbohydrate partitioning. Especially in Sarıçanak 98, Mg and K deficient plants specific weight was increasing with the increasing [CO 2]. Adana 99 plants showed the same trend although it was not as significant as in Sarıçanak 98 plants. With emphasizing adequate Mg and K nutrition requirement to maintain high photosynthetic efficiency and a balanced export of photo-assimilates to sink organs (Marschner, 1995; Cakmak and Kirkby, 2008), this study points out that this can be even more important under elevated [CO 2].

Apatite coated implants show excellent mid-term Roentgen Stereophotogrammetric Analysis (RSA) results and offer some clinical advantages above cemented total knee arthroplasty. A prospective RSA study also revealed that the studied mobile bearing design is more predictable and forgiving with respect to micromotion of the tibial component than a posterior stabilised prosthesis. However, mobile bearing prostheses showed to be more demanding for the soft tissue structures surrounding the knee joint. The techniques used in gait analysis and fluoroscopy are sensitive for measurement errors. This restricts the applicability and interpretation of the results acquired when using these methods. In general one needs {{to be aware of}} the limitations of measurement tools since one needs accurate and objective methods to assess evidence about the clinical performance of (new) total knee prostheses.

40|$|Bacterial Vaginosis (<b>B.</b> <b>V.)</b> is a {{syndrome}} defined microbiologically where lactobacilli-dominated flora is exchanged with {{an abundant}} complex nora dominated by strict and facultative anaerobic bacteria, constituted by gardenerella, micrococci, streptococci and staphylocci. It {{has been suggested}} that <b>B.</b> <b>V.</b> could be important in the development of cervical intraepithelial neoplasias, because the abnormal micro nora can produce carcinogenic nitrosamines. The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the correlation between CIN and <b>B.</b> <b>V.</b> in 1, 008 patients (median age: 28 years, range 17 - 60) who were divided into two groups: the first group consisted of 504 patients affected by CIN of different degrees, the second of 504 patients without, CIN. AII patients were submitted to colposcopy, pap-tests, cytology of the cervical canal and microcolpohysteroscopy in the case of lesions invading the cervical canal. The diagnosis of <b>B.</b> <b>V.</b> is based on four criteria: presence of clue cells, pH 4. 5, positive amine test and increased vaginal discharge. X. Pearson analysis was applied for statistical evaluation of the data. Among the 504 patients in the first group (women affected by CIN of different degrees), 180 / 504 (36 %) women presented <b>B.</b> <b>V.</b> Among the second group (504 women without CIN), 248 / 504 (49 %) women presented <b>B.</b> <b>V.</b> The results of our study demonstrate that then is no significant correlation between CIN and <b>B.</b> <b>V.</b> In the first group of patients affected by CIN and <b>B.</b> <b>V.,</b> <b>B.</b> <b>V.</b> was present in 36 % of the cases, while in the second group of patients not affected by CIN, <b>B.</b> <b>V.</b> was present in 49 % of the casts (p < 0. 00005) ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the impact of}} genetic and epigenetic factors on several aspects of vascular disease. Part 1 addresses the influence of genetic variation in genes involved in the different processes {{that lead to the}} occurrence of adverse events after percutaneous coronary intervention, mainly restenosis after bare metal stent placement, but also late acquired stent malapposition after implantation of a drug-eluting stent. Part 2 discusses the role of a relatively new area of research, which we refer to as 'epigenetic epidemiology', in restenosis and other aspects of coronary heart disease. In this part we show that polymorphisms in genes encoding lysine acetyltransferases, which are able to modify chromatin structure to allow gene transcription, can influence restenosis and mortality from coronary heart disease in several large prospective follow-up studies.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} different risk factors, {{in relation}} to restenosis after Percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI), with its main focus on genetic markers. Restenosis is {{the main drawback of}} PCI. Genetic variance poses an opportunity to enhance stratification of individuals who will be more prone to develop restenosis. Restenosis is a multifactorial process, therefore only limited part of the number of candidate genes that are potentially involved in restenosis can be described. Since the inflammatory reaction is known to be highly important in restenosis, our study has its main focus on inflammatory markers. To examine various candidate genes and their polymorphisms we made use of the GENetic DEterminants of Restenosis (GENDER) study, a multicenter follow-up study, including 3, 104 consecutive patients, who were successfully treated with PCI. In the different chapters we describe the study population and the clinical and genetic factors investigated. Furthermore, we made use of a mouse model to improve our understanding of restenosis. Our results have contributed {{to a better understanding of}} the restenotic process, they could provide novel therapeutic targets as well as contribute to development of improved risk stratification of patients who are scheduled for elective PCI, thereby creating the opportunity to individualize treatment in the future.
