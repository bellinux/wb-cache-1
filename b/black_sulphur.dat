The mean monthly {{values of the}} mentioned air pollutants {{were obtained from the}} eight stations of the Athens air pollution-monitoring network for the period 1984 - 2000, whereas the corresponding monthly values of ACA were derived from the hospital registries of the three main Children's Hospitals of Athens. The results of simple linear correlation showed that the monthly values of ACA depend mainly on <b>black</b> smoke, <b>sulphur</b> dioxide and carbon monoxide. The corresponding correlation coefficients were statistically significant for the 0 - 4 year age group, indicating an influence of primary air pollutants on childhood asthma. The application of stepwise regression analysis increased the linear correlation coefficient, and the corresponding amount of variance of childhood asthma, explained by ambient air pollution. The percentage was found to approach 43 % for the 0 - 4 year age group and 50 % for the 5 - 14 year age group.

40|$|High-performance, non-target, {{high-resolution}} organic structural spectroscopy {{was applied}} to solid phase extracted marine dissolved organic matter (SPE-DOM) isolated from four different depths in the open South Atlantic Ocean off the Angola coast (3 ° E, 18 ° S; Angola Basin) and provided molecular level information with extraordinary coverage and resolution. Sampling was performed at depths of 5 m (Angola Current; near-surface photic zone), 48 m (Angola Current; fluorescence maximum), 200 m (still above Antarctic Intermediate Water, AAIW; upper mesopelagic zone) and 5446 m (North Atlantic Deep Water, NADW; abyssopelagic, ~ 30 m above seafloor) and produced SPE-DOM with near 40 % carbon yield and beneficial nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation properties, a crucial prerequisite for the acquisition of NMR spectra with excellent resolution. 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra of all four marine SPE-DOM showed smooth bulk envelopes, reflecting intrinsic averaging from massive signal overlap, with a few percent of visibly resolved signatures and variable abundances for all major chemical environments. The abundance of singly oxygenated aliphatics and acetate derivatives in 1 H NMR spectra declined from surface to deep marine SPE-DOM, whereas C-based aliphatics and carboxyl-rich alicyclic molecules (CRAM) increased in abundance. Surface SPE-DOM contained fewer methyl esters than all other samples, likely a consequence of direct exposure to sunlight. Integration of 13 C NMR spectra revealed continual increase of carboxylic acids and ketones from surface to depth, reflecting a progressive oxygenation, with concomitant decline of carbohydrate-related substructures. Aliphatic branching increased with depth, whereas the fraction of oxygenated aliphatics declined for methine, methylene and methyl carbon. Lipids in the oldest SPE-DOM at 5446 m showed {{a larger share of}} ethyl groups and methylene carbon than observed in the other samples. Two-dimensional NMR spectra showed exceptional resolution and depicted resolved molecular signatures in excess of a certain minimum abundance. Classical methyl groups terminating aliphatic chains represented ~ 15 % of total methyl in all samples investigated. A noticeable fraction of methyl (~ 2 %) was bound to olefinic carbon. Methyl ethers were abundant in surface marine SPE-DOM, and the chemical diversity of carbohydrates was larger than that of freshwater and soil DOM. In all samples, we identified sp 2 -hybridized carbon chemical environments with discrimination of isolated and conjugated olefins and α, β -unsaturated double bonds. Olefinic proton and carbon atoms were more abundant than aromatic ones; olefinic unsaturation in marine SPE-DOM will be more directly traceable to ultimate biogenic precursors than aromatic unsaturation. The abundance of furan, pyrrol and thiophene derivatives was marginal, whereas benzene derivatives, phenols and six-membered nitrogen heterocycles were prominent; a yet unassigned set of six-membered N-heterocycles with likely more than one single nitrogen occurred in all samples. Various key polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon substructures suggested the presence of thermogenic organic matter at all water depths. Progressive NMR cross-peak attenuation from surface to deep marine SPE-DOM was particularly strong in COSY NMR spectra and indicated a continual disappearance of biosignatures as well as entropy gain from an ever increased molecular diversity. Nevertheless, a specific near-seafloor SPE-DOM signature of unsaturated molecules recognized in both NMR and Fourier transform ion cyclotron mass spectrometry (FTICR/MS) possibly originated from sediment leaching. The conformity of key NMR and FTICR/MS signatures suggested the presence of a large set of identical molecules throughout the entire ocean column even though the investigated water masses belonged to different oceanic regimes and currents. FTICR/MS showed abundant CHO, CHNO, CHOS and CHNOS molecular series with slightly increasing numbers of mass peaks and average mass from surface to bottom SPE-DOM. The proportion of CHO and CHNO negative ions increased from surface to depth, whereas CHOS and especially CHNOS molecular series markedly declined. While certain rather aliphatic CHOS and CHNOS ions were observed solely in the surface, deep marine SPE-DOM was enriched in unique unsaturated and rather oxygenated CHO and CHNO molecular series. With the exception of abyssopelagic SPE-DOM at 5446 m, which showed a peculiar CHOS chemistry of unsaturated carbon and reduced sulphur (<b>black</b> <b>sulphur),</b> CHO and CHNO molecular series contributed ~ 87 % to total positive electrospray ionization FTICR mass peak integral, with a near constant ratio of CHNO / CHO molecular compositions near 1. 13 ± 0. 05. In case of all four marine SPE-DOM, remarkably disparate average elemental compositions as determined from either MS and NMR spectra were observed, caused by a pronounced ionization selectivity in electrospray ionization FTICR/MS. The study demonstrates that the exhaustive characterization of complex unknowns in marine DOM will enable a meaningful classification of individual marine biogeosignatures. Future in-depth functional biodiversity studies with a clear understanding of DOM structure and function might eventually lead to a novel, unified perception of biodiversity and biogeochemistry...|$|E

The {{study was conducted in}} the winter of 1993 / 1994 by 14 research centres in Europe. A total of 2, 010 children, divided over 28 panels in urban and suburban locations, was followed for at least 2 months. Exposure to air pollution was monitored on a daily basis. Health status was monitored by daily peak expiratory flow (PEF) measurements and a symptom diary. The association between respiratory health and air pollution levels was calculated with time series analysis. Combined effect estimates of air pollution on PEF or the daily prevalence of respiratory symptoms and bronchodilator use were calculated from the panel-specific effect estimates. Fixed effect models were used and, in cases of heterogeneity, random effect models. No clear associations between PM 10, BS, SO 2 or NO 2 and morning PEF, evening PEF, prevalence of respiratory symptoms or bronchodilator use could be detected. Only previous day PM 10 was negatively associated with evening PEF, but only in locations where BS was high compared to PM 10 concentrations. There were no consistent differences in effect estimates between subgroups based on urban versus suburban, geographical location or mean levels of PM 10, BS, SO 2 and NO 2. The lack of association could not be attributed to a lack of statistical power, low levels of exposure or incorrect trend specifications.

The UK’s National Smoke and Sulphur Dioxide Survey provides monitored concentration data from 1955 - 2005 with over 3, 000 sites in existence over time. These measured concentrations of <b>black</b> smoke and <b>sulphur</b> dioxide served as a core set of data for the modelling of exposures at 1 km scale. Additional data sourced and developed for input into modelling included modelled emission maps (generated with AEA Technology), emission proxies (including land cover and road networks), information on environmental factors (topography and meteorology), population distribution and some ancillary data (e. g. smoke control areas and the Douglas Waller Index based on domestic coal sales). An important product of this work are the data, aimed at modelling historical exposures to air pollution, fully geo-referenced and integrated into a geographic information system.

40|$|The {{effects of}} carbon blacks on {{vulcanization}} and mechanical properties of filled ethylene-propylene-diene rubber (EPDM) are investigated, by comparing with five types of rubber-grade carbon blacks. Curing kinetics is studied by rheometer {{and the results}} indicate that the curing characteristics are influenced by combination of surface area of carbon <b>black</b> and <b>sulphur</b> content on the filler surface, because the former one enhances the physical cross-linking and the latter one introduces the additional chemical cross-linking. Both the degree of cross-linking and cure rate increase with increasing surface area and sulphur content, whereas the optimum cure time and scorch time decrease. The reinforcing nature of the carbon black is assessed from mechanical measurements. It is suggested that the surface area of carbon blacks strongly affects the physical properties of EPDM/carbon black composites. Conductive carbon black (N 472) can be used as desirable reinforcing filler due to the higher degree of cross-linking of EPDM with N 472 than other EPDM/carbon black composites. The morphology and distribution of particles are studied by using scanning electron microscope. The sound reinforcing ability of N 472 is also supported by scanning electron microscope due to the notable dispersibility of N 472 within EPDM matrix.

Diary data on lower and upper respiratory symptoms (LRS and URS, respectively), cough, and morning and evening peak expiratory flow (PEF) were collected in 327 elderly patients (50 – 70 yrs) for a period of 3 months. Acute effects of particulate matter with a diameter, 10 mm, <b>black</b> smoke, <b>sulphur</b> dioxide and nitrogen dioxide on symptoms and PEF were estimated using logistic regression. In total, 48 (14. 7 %) subjects had AHR+/IgE+, 112 (34. 3 %) had AHR-/IgE+, 42 (12. 8 %) had AHR+/ IgE- and 125 (38. 2 %) had AHR-/IgE-. In the AHR+/IgE+ group, each 10 mg?m- 3 increase in air pollution was associated with a significant increase in prevalence of URS (odds ratio ranging 1. 03 – 1. 19), cough (1. 03 – 1. 08) and fall in morning PEF (1. 04 – 1. 26). In the AHR+/IgE+ group, males responded predominantly with symptoms and females with a fall in morning PEF. In conclusion, elderly individuals with both airway hyperresponsiveness and high total immunoglobulin E are especially susceptible to air pollution.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} short term effect of {{concentrations}} of <b>black</b> smoke, <b>sulphur</b> dioxide (SO 2), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) and ozone (O 3) in ambient air on emergency room visits for asthma {{in the city of}} Valencia, Spain during the period 1994 - 5. METHODS: Ecological study with time series data and application of Poisson regression. Associations between number of daily emergency visits in a city's hospital and concentrations of air pollutants were analysed taking into account potential confounding factors by the standardised protocol of the air pollution and health: a European approach (APHEA) project. RESULTS: Mean (range) daily number of emergency room visits for asthma was 1 (0 - 5). Concentrations of all pollutants studied remained within current air quality standards. The association between an increase of 10 micrograms/m 3 in ambient air pollution and asthma, measured as a relative risk (RR) of emergency visits, was significant for NO 2 24 hour mean (lag 0, RR 1. 076, 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 1. 020 to 1. 134), NO 2 hour maximum (lag 0, RR 1. 037, 95 % CI 1. 008 to 1. 066), and O 3 hour maximum (lag 1, RR 1. 063, CI 95 % 1. 014 to 1. 114). The association was not significant for SO 2 or for black smoke during the period analysed. The effects were not significantly different for the time of year, cold months (November to April), or warm months (May to October). CONCLUSIONS: Current concentrations of ambient air pollution in Valencia are significantly associated with emergency room visits for asthma.

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Several {{studies have}} {{assessed}} {{the association between}} urban air pollutants and hospital admissions or emergency room visits for asthma with inconsistent results. The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the relation between levels of <b>black</b> smoke, <b>sulphur</b> dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone and adult emergency room visits for asthma in Barcelona, Spain during the five year period 1985 - 9. METHODS [...] The daily number of emergency room visits for asthma was obtained from a register of respiratory emergencies designed to study the asthma outbreaks occurring in Barcelona. The association between asthma visits and levels of pollutants was assessed separately for summers and winters with Poisson regression models controlling for meteorological and time related variables. RESULTS [...] Black smoke was associated with asthma visits in summer but not in winter. The relative risk (RR) of asthma visits for a 25 micrograms/m 3 increase of current day concentrations of black smoke was 1. 082 (95 % CI 1. 011 to 1. 157). The mean current and previous three day levels of black smoke led to a stronger association (RR = 1. 114 (95 % CI 1. 010 to 1. 160). In addition, nitrogen dioxide was associated with asthma visits in both summer (RR = 1. 045, 95 % CI 1. 009 to 1. 081) and winter (RR = 1. 056, 95 % CI 1. 011 to 1. 104). These associations were slightly higher for the previous day's level of nitrogen dioxide. No associations were found for sulphur dioxide or for ozone. CONCLUSIONS [...] This study provides further evidence of the effect of particulate pollution on asthma, and it suggests that nitrogen dioxide may have a role in the exacerbation of bronchial asthma in adults...|$|R
40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE—To {{estimate}} the short-term association between air pollution levels and emergency hospital admissions for cardiovascular diseases in Valencia, within 1994 - 1996 period.  DESIGN—Daily levels {{of air pollution}} and emergency admissions for cardiovascular diseases were related to using an ecological time series design. The number of admissions {{was obtained from the}} hospital records database. Selected groups of causes were all cardiovascular diseases, heart admissions, and admissions for cerebrovascular diseases. The number of admissions for digestive diseases was used as control. Pollutants were <b>black</b> smoke, <b>sulphur</b> dioxide (SO 2), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), carbon monoxide (CO) and ozone (O 3). Magnitude of association was estimated by Poisson autoregresive regression. Estimations were calculated according the hottest (May to October) and the coldest (November to April) periods.  SETTING—City of Valencia, Spain, about 750   000 inhabitants.  PARTICIPANTS—People being admitted to the two major hospitals in the city, with a catchment area of nearly 400   000 inhabitants.  MAIN RESULTS—For the whole period, a significant association for SO 2 - 24 h was found so a rise in its levels of 10  µg/m 3 was associated with an increment of 3 % (95 %CI 0. 4  to 5. 7 %) in the expected number of cardiovascular admissions. A significant association for black smoke, SO 2 - 24 h, SO 2 - 1 h, and CO- 1 h was found in the hottest semester. All these associations were verified with a lag of two days. The estimates of the associations for particles, SO 2, and CO were affected by the inclusion of the other pollutants in their models. NO 2 was independently associated with cerebrovascular admissions. There were no significant associations between air pollution and admissions for digestive diseases.  CONCLUSIONS—Current levels of air pollution and emergency cardiovascular admissions are significantly related in Valencia.    Keywords: air pollution; cardiovascular disease; hospital admission...|$|R

This is comparable to other northern hemisphere studies, but on average 0. 5 ng m− 3 higher than at its sister monitoring station at Auchencorth Moss, Scotland, but 14 % lower than that found in a similar study at the same location of 1. 68 ng m− 3 in 1995 / 6. Using wind sector analysis we show the important influence of local emissions, with our data showing that the largest influence on TGM observed {{is that of the}} adjacent Science & Innovation campus, making the site more a ‘suburban background’. By using co-located measurements of <b>black</b> carbon and <b>sulphur</b> dioxide as tracers, we present an initial investigation into the impact of the closure of Didcot A coal fired power station, which ceased operating in March 2013. Further analysis using air mass back trajectories shows the long-range contribution to TGM from continental Europe, and that the lowest levels are associated with marine air masses from the west...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{investigate}} whether outdoor air pollution levels in London influence daily mortality. DESIGN [...] Poisson regression analysis of daily counts of deaths, with adjustment for effects of secular trend, seasonal and other cyclical factors, {{day of the}} week, holidays, influenza epidemic, temperature, humidity, and autocorrelation, from April 1987 to March 1992. Pollution variables were particles (<b>black</b> smoke), <b>sulphur</b> dioxide, ozone, and nitrogen dioxide, lagged 0 - 3 days. SETTING [...] Greater London. OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Relative risk of death from all causes (excluding accidents), respiratory disease, and cardiovascular disease. RESULTS [...] Ozone levels (same day) were associated with {{a significant increase in}} all cause, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality; the effects were greater in the warm seasons (April to September) and were independent of the effects of other pollutants. In the warm season an increase of the eight hour ozone concentration from the 10 th to the 90 th centile of the seasonal change (7 - 36 ppb) was associated with an increase of 3. 5 % (95 % confidence interval 1. 7 to 5. 3), 3. 6 % (1. 04 to 6. 1), and 5. 4 % (0. 4 to 10. 7) in all cause, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality respectively. Black smoke concentrations on the previous day were significantly associated with all cause mortality, and this effect was also greater in the warm season and was independent of the effects of other pollutants. For black smoke an increase from the 10 th to 90 th centile in the warm season (7 - 19 microg/m 3) was associated with an increase of 2. 5 % (0. 9 to 4. 1) in all cause mortality. Significant but smaller and less consistent effects were also observed for nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide. CONCLUSION [...] Daily variations in air pollution within the range currently occurring in London may have an adverse effect on daily mortality...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The PEACE {{study is}} a {{multicentre}} panel study of the acute effects of particles with a 50 % cut off aerodynamic diameter of 10 microns (PM 10), <b>black</b> smoke (BS), <b>sulphur</b> dioxide (SO 2), and nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) on respiratory health of children with chronic respiratory symptoms. In the complete panels no consistent association between air pollution and respiratory health was found. The study evaluated whether potentially more sensitive subgroups in the panels did show effects of air pollution. METHODS: To evaluate heterogeneity in response to air pollution, effect estimates of air pollution on peak expiratory flow (PEF) and respiratory symptoms were calculated in subgroups based on presence of chronic respiratory symptoms, use of respiratory medication, atopy, sex, and baseline lung function. RESULTS: The association between PEF and air pollution was positive in asthmatic children who used respiratory medication whereas the associations tended to be negative in children who did not use respiratory medication selected only on cough. No consistent association was found among asthmatic children who did not use medication. The association between daily prevalence of symptoms and concentrations of air pollution was not different between these subgroups. CONCLUSION: None of the predefined potentially more sensitive subgroups showed a consistent association between air pollution, PEF, and respiratory symptoms...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Motor vehicle {{exhaust fumes}} {{are the main}} source of {{atmospheric}} pollution in cities in industrialised countries. They cause respiratory disease and annoy people exposed to them. The relation between ambient exposure to air pollution mainly from motor vehicles and annoyance reactions in a general population was assessed. Also, the importance of factors such as age, sex, respiratory disease, access to the use of a car, and smoking habits on the reporting of these reactions was studied. METHODS: A postal questionnaire was sent out in 55 urban areas in Sweden that had nearly identical air quality monitoring stations of the urban air monitoring network. From each area, 150 people aged 16 - 70 were randomly selected. The questionnaire contained questions on perception of air quality as well as a question on how often exhaust fumes were annoying. RESULTS: Six-monthly nitrogen dioxide concentrations correlated consistently with the prevalence of reported annoyance related to air pollution and traffic exhaust fumes. <b>Black</b> smoke and <b>sulphur</b> dioxide had no significant effects. The frequency of reporting annoyance reactions was higher among people with asthma, women, and people with lack of access to a car. CONCLUSIONS: In this study town dwellers could detect poor air quality at concentrations well below current guidelines for outdoor air pollution. This suggests that questionnaire studies have a place in monitoring air quality...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{short-term}} {{effects of}} nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) on total, cardiovascular and respiratory mortality in 30 European cities {{participating in the}} Air Pollution on Health: a European Approach (APHEA) - 2 project were investigated. The association was examined using hierarchical models implemented in two stages. In the first stage, data from each city were analysed separately, whereas in the second stage, the city-specific air pollution estimates were regressed on city-specific covariates to obtain overall estimates and to explore sources of possible heterogeneity. A significant association of NO 2 with total, cardiovascular and respiratory mortality was found, with stronger effects on cause-specific mortality. There was evidence of confounding in respiratory mortality with <b>black</b> smoke and <b>sulphur</b> dioxide. The effect of NO 2 on total and cardiovascular mortality was observed mainly in western and southern European cities, and was larger when smoking prevalence was lower and household gas consumption was higher. The effect of NO 2 on respiratory mortality was higher in cities with {{a larger proportion of}} elderly persons in the population and higher levels of particulate matter with a 50 % cut-off aerodynamic diameter of 10 mm. The results of this large study are consistent with an independent effect of nitrogen dioxide on mortality, but the role of nitrogen dioxide as a surrogate of other unmeasured pollutants cannot be completely ruled out...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDyes are {{recalcitrant}} {{compounds that}} resist conventional biological treatments. The degradation of three textile dyes (Indigo, RBBR and <b>Sulphur</b> <b>Black),</b> and the dye-containing liquid effluent and solid waste from the Municipal Treatment Station, Americana, São Paulo, Brazil, by the cyanobacteria Anabaena flos-aquae UTCC 64, Phormidium autumnale UTEX 1580 and Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942 was evaluated. The dye degradation {{efficiency of the}} cyanobacteria was compared with anaerobic and anaerobic–aerobic systems in terms of discolouration and toxicity evaluations. The discoloration was evaluated by absorption spectroscopy. Toxicity was measured using the organisms Hydra attenuata, the alga Selenastrum capricornutum and lettuce seeds. The three cyanobacteria showed the potential to remediate textile effluent by removing the colour and reducing the toxicity. However, the growth of cyanobacteria on sludge was slow and discoloration was not efficient. The cyanobacteria P. autumnale UTEX 1580 was the only strain that completely degraded the indigo dye. An evaluation of the mutagenicity potential was performed by use of the micronucleus assay using Allium sp. No mutagenicity was observed after the treatment. Two metabolites were produced during the degradation, anthranilic acid and isatin, but toxicity did not increase after the treatment. The cyanobacteria showed the ability to degrade the dyes present in a textile effluent; therefore, {{they can be used}} in a tertiary treatment of effluents with recalcitrant compounds...|$|R
40|$|Health {{implications}} {{of air pollution}} vary dependent upon pollutant sources. This work determines the value, in terms of reduced mortality, of reducing ambient particulate matter (PM 2. 5 : effective aerodynamic diameter 2. 5 μm or less) concentration due to different emission sources. Suva, a Pacific Island city with substantial input from combustion sources, {{is used as a}} case-study. Elemental concentration was determined, by ion beam analysis, for PM 2. 5 samples from Suva, spanning one year. Sources of PM 2. 5 have been quantified by positive matrix factorisation. A review of recent literature has been carried out to delineate the mortality risk associated with these sources. Risk factors have then been applied for Suva, to calculate the possible mortality reduction that may be achieved through reduction in pollutant levels. Higher risk ratios for <b>black</b> carbon and <b>sulphur</b> resulted in mortality predictions for PM 2. 5 from fossil fuel combustion, road vehicle emissions and waste burning that surpass predictions for these sources based on health risk of PM 2. 5 mass alone. Predicted mortality for Suva from fossil fuel smoke exceeds the national toll from road accidents in Fiji. The greatest benefit for Suva, in terms of reduced mortality, is likely to be accomplished by reducing emissions from fossil fuel combustion (diesel), vehicles and waste burning...|$|R
40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{assessed}} {{the association between}} air pollution and hospital admissions or emergency room visits for asthma. Because of both the presence of missing data and {{the small number of}} observations, the relationship between air pollution and mortality for respiratory causes has been rarely analysed, and when it has, the results are very inconclusive or even inconsistent. The objective {{of this study is to}} assess the relation between levels of air pollutants (<b>black</b> smoke, <b>sulphur</b> dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and ozone), meteorological variables (24 th average temperature and relative humidity) and daily mortality for asthma (ICD- 9 493, 2 to 45 years old) in Barcelona, Spain, during the period 19861989. Since the range of daily mortality for asthma (2 to 45 years old) during the period 19861989 was 01), we have preferred to consider this variable as dichotomous. First, the relationship between air pollutants, meteorological variables and daily mortality (controlled for the occurrence of asthma epidemics) was estimated using logistic regression models. As was expected, the residuals from this regression were autocorrelated, showing a complex moving average (MA) structure. If covariates were not time dependent the so-called generalized linear mixed models, could be applied. In our case the covariates vary. As a consequence the likelihood is numerically intractable because it involves the evaluation of n-fold integral. An alternative method that avoids these numerical problems is the generalized estimating equations method(GEE). It is a multivariate analogue of quasilikelihood estimation. In the absence of a likelihood function the parameters can be estimated by solving a multivariate analogue of the quasi score function. We have modi"ed the GEE method in this paper, allowing for a di!erent structure in the error covariance matrix (MA). Both air pollutants and meteorological variables are related with the occurrence of a death for asthma. In this sense, nitrogen dioxide, NO 2 (β= 0 · 037, p< 0 · 05), ozone, O 3 (β= 0 · 021, p< 0 · 06) and high temperature (the β's were in the range (0 · 098 - 0 · 182), p< 0 · 05) increased the probability of dying for asthma in Barcelona during the period 1986 - 1989.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Previous {{epidemiological}} {{studies have shown}} acute effects of increased amounts of ambient air pollution on the prevalence of respiratory symptoms in children with respiratory disorders. We investigated whether children with bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) and relatively high serum concentrations of total IgE (> 60 kU/L, the median value) are susceptible to air pollution. METHODS: We collected data from children during three winters (1992 - 95) in rural and urban areas of the Netherlands. Lower respiratory symptoms (wheeze, attacks of wheezing, shortness of breath), upper respiratory symptoms (sore throat, runny or blocked nose), and peak expiratory flow were recorded daily for 3 months. The acute effects of airborne particulate matter with a diameter of less than 10 microm, <b>black</b> smoke, <b>sulphur</b> dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide were estimated by logistic regression. FINDINGS: 459 (73 %) of 632 children had complete data. Of these, 26 % had BHR and relatively high (above median) serum total IgE, 36 % had no BHR and total IgE of 60 kU/L or less, 15 % had BHR and total IgE of 60 kU/L or less, and 23 % had a total IgE of more than 60 kU/L but no BHR. In children with BHR and relatively high serum total IgE the prevalence of lower respiratory symptoms increased significantly by between 32 % and 139 % for each 100 microm/m 3 increase in particulate matter, and between 16 % and 131 % for each 40 microm/m 3 increase in black smoke, SO 2, or NO 2. Decrease in peak expiratory flow of more than 10 % in that group was more common with increased airborne particulate matter and black smoke. There were no consistent positive or negative associations between increased air pollution and prevalence of respiratory symptoms or decrease in peak expiratory flow in the other three groups of children. INTERPRETATION: Children with BHR and relatively high concentrations of serum total IgE are susceptible to air pollution. Although our odds ratios were rather low (range 1. 16 - 2. 39) the overall effect of air pollution on public health {{is likely to be}} substantial since these odds ratios refer to large numbers of people...|$|R
