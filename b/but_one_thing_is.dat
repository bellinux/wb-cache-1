500|$|Copland {{acknowledged}} that the acoustics at the premiere were [...] "shrill." [...] While Philharmonic Hall was being renovated in 1976 {{in an attempt to}} improve its sound, Harold C. Schonberg wrote, [...] "For all we know, Connotations is a masterpiece. <b>But</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> certain—it did not make many friends for Lincoln Center in 1962." [...] While admitting the work was [...] "written in Copland's austere, objective, abstract style," [...] he suggested that bad acoustics might have also played a part in the work's failure at the premiere. The orchestra that night had been augmented by a large chorus to perform the first movement of Gustav Mahler's Eighth Symphony, which pushed the orchestra forward, [...] "out of its normal playing position... The sound was bad, bad. The bass response was sorely deficient, the hall was plagued with echoes, the musicians on stage reported that they could not hear each other very well (just great for ensemble) and in general Philharmonic Hall sounded like a cheap hi-fi set with the bass speakers out of the circuit.|$|E
500|$|In {{the present}} day, Mr. Gold (Carlyle) repossesses florist Moe French's (Keenleyside) van {{the day before}} Valentine's Day. At Granny's Cafe, David (Josh Dallas) and Mary Margaret (Ginnifer Goodwin) talk from {{separate}} tables, until Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) interrupts to ask about Henry (Jared S. Gilmore). Ashley (Jessy Schram) arrives with her baby, noting how rarely she gets a babysitter or sees her boyfriend, Sean (Tim Phillipps). Ruby (Meghan Ory) suggests a girl's night out. Emma investigates a robbery of Mr. Gold's home, who says he knows that Moe is responsible, seeking revenge for the repossession. Emma recovers the majority of Mr. Gold's items <b>but</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> missing and he will stop at nothing until it is recovered. He kidnaps Moe, ties him up and beats him, demanding where it is. However, he soon starts saying [...] "she's gone," [...] referring to Belle, until Emma arrives to stop him. Mr. Gold believes Regina (Parrilla) put Moe up to the theft and she knows where the last stolen item is. Emma still has to arrest Mr. Gold for kidnapping and assault.|$|E
500|$|The band toured {{nationally in}} July 2010 {{to support the}} album, while its lead single, the title track, had {{appeared}} in May and charted in the Top30 on the ARIA Singles Chart. The second single, [...] "Tommy and Krista", was released in September, which peaked at No.10 in New Zealand. Another single, [...] "All My Life", was featured in the promotional clips for the 2010 AFL grand final. Its music video was directed by Adrian Van de Velde and was shot in early October in Bangkok, Thailand. The narrative is a 'heroic love' set on a local military base and features Russian model-actress Maria Mazikova, together with 50 Thai army troops, an Iroquois helicopter, and a Chinook helicopter. In November Lip Magazines Shannon Andreucci reviewed a live gig, [...] " [...] are certainly no Pixies, Beatles or Sex Pistols. They're not breaking any rules or boundaries in the revolutionary world of rock music. In fact they are perfectly happy and capable of playing within the parameters of radio friendly and commercially safe pop rock. <b>But</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> for sure; they {{go the extra mile}} in giving a charmingly refined and hearty live performance and that in itself should be commended".|$|E

500|$|... {{the film}} had {{a rating of}} 29% on review {{aggregator}} website Rotten Tomatoes. Vincent Canby of The New York Times noted that Madonna, left to her own devices and her own canny pace, is a very engaging comedian. [...] "When Madonna's no-nonsense pragmatism isn't being twisted into poses of lovable eccentricity, the actress is sexy and funny and never for a minute sentimental. At times she looks amazingly like Marilyn Monroe, but the personality is her own, more resilient and more knowing. As the WASP-y sleeping prince, Mr. Dunne gives the most stylishly comic performance of a career that's been largely underrated by the public. Though {{he seems to be}} Madonna's foil, he provides the movie with its backbone, even in its most ludicrous moments. He may well {{be one of the most}} truly sophisticated straight men in the business today." [...] However, he ended the review by saying that the film was short on outright guffaws. Hal Hinson of The Washington Post gave the film a mixed review, commenting that [...] "you may not feel as if you've seen a movie. You may not quite know what you've seen" [...] and that although he laughed too much, the film [...] "is outrageously inept, but not in a routine manner". Hinson also criticized the work of Foley, noting that he [...] "doesn't have the skill to sustain a cartoon style." [...] Philip Wuntch of The Dallas Morning News commented that the film is a deft and daffy comedy performance; Madonna is great with the one-liners. [...] As a movie star, Madonna may be an acquired taste. <b>But</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> certain: acquiring this particular taste is going to be an enjoyable experience." [...] Jay Boyar of the Orlando Sentinel gave a negative review saying, [...] "Luckily for her, Madonna can sing, and use it to save herself from this disgrace of a movie." ...|$|E

2500|$|With Trilogy now on iTunes and in-stores, The Weeknd {{turned to}} his fifth {{official}} video, one of his three new releases from his debut, [...] "Twenty Eight". Dropped on 13 February 2013 and directed by up-and-coming visionary Nabil Elderkin (some may notice similarities to Frank Ocean's [...] "Pyramids" [...] video which he also directed). Simren Bolaria of music blog Earmilk, describes the video, [...] "A long way from his former faceless, anti-media Internet persona, a distracted Abel Tesfaye sits down for a grey and dreary television interview with a foreign journalist while a haunting hologram girl sits in bed watching from her own television set. He's under surveillance—the crew is watching, hologram girl is watching, and the reporter is talking at him, so he dips into mental absence. The Weeknd continues to slip back into his alternate stripper world where the lights are flashing, the strippers don't get tired, the décor is decadent, and he can do the watching himself, with a camcorder in hand, of course. The line between what's real and what's imagined is blurred, <b>but</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> clear—this video is definitely NSFW." ...|$|E

2500|$|Daisy {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} most music critics, although fan reactions were more mixed. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 75, based on twelve reviews, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews". Drew Beringer of AbsolutePunk commented [...] "Daisy is auditory proof, {{as this is}} the Long Island quintet’s most challenging and distinguished album yet", believing [...] "Some will love it, some will hate it, most will be perplexed by it and will need many listens to digest it. <b>But</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> certain, this is a record that will shake you". Dan Martin of NME described Daisy as a [...] "breathtakingly accomplished record" [...] calling the Brand New the [...] "most graceful rock band in America". Rock Sound also heaped praise upon the album, making comparisons to The Cure, The Smiths and Nirvana. Chris Hidden described the album as a more refined version of previous album, The Devil and God Are Raging Inside Me, summarising that [...] "Brand New are now artistically unrivalled by their peers; it would be astonishing if they didn’t see where else they could go". Mikael Wood, journalist for Spin magazine particularly praised the moments of surprise throughout the album. [...] "Jesse Lacey howls about burning in bed and turning to dirt while his bandmates churn out noisy, jagged art-punk riffs that routinely explode without warning. The sound is old-fashioned, but the fury is fresh". Christian Hoard of Rolling Stone praised the band for not sticking to genre restraints; [...] "The quartet's fourth album avoids genre commonplaces with subtle shadings. 'You tried to put a fire out, but you used gasoline' — and songs like the heroin-jag slow-burner [...] "Bed" [...] prove that letting rip isn't always Lacey's best move." [...] Adam Downer of Sputnikmusic gave the album a 5/5, declaring [...] "Daisy is broken and Daisy is violent. It is not romantic {{and it is not}} particularly deep. It’s this writhing, bitter little record, obsessed with mortality as if the thing were breathing down its neck." ...|$|E
