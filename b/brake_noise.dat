50|$|Brake {{shoes are}} {{typically}} made of {{two pieces of}} steel welded together. The friction material is either riveted to the lining table or attached with adhesive. The crescent-shaped piece is called the Web and contains holes and slots in different shapes for return springs, hold-down hardware, parking brake linkage and self-adjusting components. All the application force of the wheel cylinder is applied through the web to the lining table and brake lining. The edge of the lining table generally has three “V"-shaped notches or tabs on each side called nibs. The nibs rest against the support pads of the backing plate to which the shoes are installed.Each brake assembly has two shoes, a primary and secondary. The primary shoe is located {{toward the front of}} the vehicle and has the lining positioned differently from the secondary shoe. Quite often, the two shoes are interchangeable, so close inspection for any variation is important. Linings must be resistant to heat and wear and have a high friction coefficient unaffected by fluctuations in temperature and humidity.Materials that make up the brake shoe include, friction modifiers (which can include graphite and cashew nut shells), powdered metal such as lead, zinc, brass, aluminium and other metals that resist heat fade, binders, curing agents and fillers such as rubber chips to reduce <b>brake</b> <b>noise.</b>|$|E

The FEA model of the brake system tuned with the damping characteristics highlights the actual unstable frequencies by eliminating the over-predictions. This study also investigates effectiveness of a hybrid Implicit-Explicit FEA method which combines frequency domain and time domain solution schemes.

40|$|This chapter {{proposes a}} novel {{approach}} to suppress vibration that causes <b>brake</b> <b>noise</b> is proposed employing a closed-loop feedback control method using an Active Force Control (AFC) based strategy. It is {{used in conjunction with}} the classic proportionalintegral- derivative (PID) scheme that is typically incorporated in the outermost positional control loop. The idea is to introduce an active element that dynamically compensates the disturbances through a control mechanism that takes into account the direct measurements and estimation of parameters in the AFC section. A disc brake model is considered and simulated taking into account a number of operating and loading conditions. Results clearly show the superiority of the proposed AFC-based scheme compared to the pure PID counterpart in suppressing the vibration and hence the <b>brake</b> <b>noise.</b> Brake {{is one of the most}} important safety components in any automotive vehicle and is almost indispensable. The brake system of an automobile typically consists of the contact metallic solids rubbing against each other, which frequently generates undesirable noise and vibrations. This in turn causes discomfort to the passengers and adversely affects their perceptions of the quality and reliability of the vehicle. Thus, noise generation and suppression have become an important factor to be considered in the design and manufacture of brake components. Indeed, as noted by Abendroth and Wernitz (2000), a large number of manufacturers of brake pad materials spend up to 50 % of their engineering costs on issues related to noise, vibration and harshness. <b>Brake</b> <b>noise</b> vibration phenomena are described by a number of terminologies that are sometimes interchangeably used such as squeal, groom, chatter, judder, moan and hum (Kinkaid et al., 2003). Even to this day, there is no precise or conclusive definition of brake squeal that has gained complete acceptance. It is also worth mentioning that since in a vehicle with disc brakes installed at the front wheels while drum brakes at the back wheels, around 70 % of the braking action occurs at the front wheels. Thus, it is expected that most of the noise and squeal is coming from the front disc brake system. The main cause of <b>brake</b> <b>noise</b> is due to the effect of negative damping (Shin et al., 2002), in which the friction coefficient reduces with the increase of relative velocity of the pad and the disk. The other factor maybe attributed to mode coupling (Chen et al., 2006). In literature, there are three major methods to study and reduce brake squeal, namely through mathematical modeling, experimental and finite element methods. A recent research study has been carried out for reducing <b>brake</b> <b>noise</b> using finite element (FE) can be found in (Dai and Lim, 2007). They developed a dynamic FE model of the brake system, and based on their analysis, the pad design changes can be made in the FE model to determine the potential improvements in the dynamic stability of the system and also in noise reduction. Wagner et al. proposed a new mathematical rotor based model of a brake system that is suitable for noise analysis (Wagner et al., 2007). A brief description of the previous mathematical models that have been developed by other researchers were explicitly outlined in their study. Besides, there is also an active control method known as dither control which makes use of high frequency disturbance signal for the suppression of the automotive disc brake squeal. Brake squeal control using an active technique 43 Through this scheme, the dither signal stabilizes friction induced self-oscillations in the disc brake using a harmonic vibration, with a frequency higher than the squeal frequency generated from a stack of piezoelectric elements placed in the caliper piston of the brake system. The resulting control vibration was not heard from the brake system if an ultrasonic control signal was activated. This system assumes an open loop control mode in which there is no requirement to detect the presence of squeal and is much simpler in design than the feedback control (Grag, 2000). This paper presents a closed loop control employing system Active Force Control (AFC) with PID element applied to a brake model described in (Hoffmann et al., 2005) in order to suppress the <b>brake</b> <b>noise</b> and squeal. The main advantage of the AFC technique is its ability to reject disturbances that are applied to the system through appropriate manipulation of the selected parameters. In addition, the technique requires much less computational burden and has been successfully demonstrated to be readily implemented in realtime. AFC as first proposed by Hewitt and Burdess (1981) is very robust and effective in controlling a robot arm. Mailah has successfully demonstrated the application of the technique to include many other dynamical systems with the incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) methods (Mailah, 1998; Mailah and Rahim, 2000) ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceSound unpleasantness due {{to urban}} road traffic at {{crossroads}} was investigated through a listening test performed in a laboratory environment. Thirty-two sound sequences were created. Four factors were studied: sound level, type of crossroads, traffic density and traffic composition. The results showed that sound unpleasantness was mainly influenced by sound level. Decreasing traffic density {{by a factor of}} 2 also reduced sound unpleasantness. The roundabout was judged less unpleasant than the crossroads with traffic lights, when traffic density was high. This outcome may be explained by differences in traffic flow dynamics between the crossroads with traffic lights and the roundabout: on the one hand, for the crossroads with traffic lights, the traffic flow resembled a constant pulsed flow, with alternate cycles of acceleration/deceleration; on the other hand, for the roundabout, the traffic flow was more similar to a constant fluid flow, with less marked cycles of acceleration/deceleration. For the roundabout only, sound unpleasantness increased with the presence of heavy vehicles (or buses). Actually, sound sequences with only light vehicles were rated less unpleasant for the roundabout than for the crossroads with traffic lights. This could be due to differences in their spectral pattern. In particular, for traffic-light scenarios, higher levels within the frequency range [400, 3000] Hz occurred when vehicles passed by, in connection with higher vehicle speeds, and higher levels in the high frequencies (around 16 kHz) occurred more often when vehicles stopped, indicating the presence of <b>braking</b> <b>noise</b> with a shrill character...|$|R
