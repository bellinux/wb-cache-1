The system {{will use the}} wide-band Satellite Switched Time Division Multiple Access (SS-TDMA) capability and hopping beam antennas of NASA's Advanced Communications Technology Satellite (ACTS). The GSN network will provide full-duplex SONET services over satellite at OC- 3 (155. 54 Mb/s) and OC- 12 (622. 078 Mb/s) rates. Typical applications will include connection of distributed SONET/ATM fiber "islands" over satellite, wide-area distributed supercomputer networking, high-definition digital TV, and high-speed file transfer. The RF link consists of 30 GHz uplink and 20 GHz downlink signals transmitted using a 3. 4 meter offset-fed antenna and 120 Watt helix-type TWTA.

The {{goal of the}} program is to expedite the development of new technology with a clear path towards productization and enhancing the competitiveness of U. S. manufacturers. The industry has made significant investment in developing ASIC-based modem technology for continuous-mode applications and has made investigations into East, reliable acquisition of burst-mode digital communication signals. With rapid advances in analog and digital communications ICs, it is expected that more functions will be integrated onto these parts in the near future. In addition custom ASIC's can also be developed to address the areas not covered by the other IC's. Using the commercial chips and custom ASIC's, lower-cost, compact, reliable, and high-performance modems can be built for demanding satellite communication application.

40|$|A high {{performance}} ASIC supporting multiple modulation, error correction, and frame formats is under development at Hughes Network Systems, Inc. Powerful and generic data-aided (DA) estimators {{are needed to}} accommodate operation in the required modes. In this paper, a simplified DA maximum likelihood (ML) joint estimator for carrier phase and symbol timing offset for QPSK/OQPSK <b>burst</b> <b>modems</b> and a sample systolic VLSI implementation for the estimator are presented. Furthermore, the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for DA case is investigated. The performance of the estimator is shown through simulation to meet the CRLB even at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). Compared with theoretical solutions, the proposed estimator is less computationally intensive and is therefore easier to implement using current VLSI technology.

40|$|The major {{objective}} of this thesis is to investigate efficient all-digital symbol-timing recovery for <b>burst</b> <b>modems.</b> The study consists of new symbol-timing estimation algorithm and new optimal interpolation filters. The proposed feed-forward STR algorithms are optimal {{in the sense of}} maximum-likelihood estimation. Estimations are very accurate and converge rapidly within a preamble length as short as 4 symbols, suitable to burst-mode modems. In addition, they can operate at a sampling rate as low as twice the symbol rate. The proposed synthesis method of the optimal interpolation filters is optimal in the sense of minimum mean-square error jointly in time, and frequency domain, and symbol-timing estimation error. Mathematical derivations, analysis, simulations, and implemented structures of the new algorithms are presented. Oversampling techniques combined with interpolation are studied to achieve better accuracy with a cost in increasing implementation complexity and lowering operational clock rate...|$|R
5000|$|The {{essence of}} ALE {{techniques}} {{is the use}} of automatic channel selection, scanning receivers, selective calling, handshaking, and robust <b>burst</b> <b>modems.</b> An ALE node decodes all received ALE signals heard on the channel(s) it monitors. It utilizes the fact that all ALE messages utilize Forward error correction (FEC) redundancy. By noting how much error-correction occurred in each received and decoded message, an ALE node can detect the [...] "quality" [...] of the path between the sending station and itself. This information is coupled with the ALE address of the sending node and the channel the message was received on, and stored in the node's Link Quality Analysis (LQA) memory. When a call is initiated, the LQA lookup table is searched for matches involving the target ALE address and the best historic channel is used to call the target station. This reduces the likelihood that the call has to be repeated on alternate frequencies. Once the target station has heard the call and responded, a bell or other signalling device will notify both operators that a link has been established. At this point, the operators may coordinate further communication via orderwire text messages, voice, or other means. If further digital communication is desired, it may take place via external data modems or via optional modems built into the ALE terminal.|$|R
