5|$|Frogs in the genera Heleioporus and Neobatrachus lack vocal sacs but {{can still}} produce a loud call.

5|$|The {{zebra shark}} feeds {{primarily}} on shelled molluscs, though {{it also takes}} crustaceans, small bony fishes, and possibly sea snakes. The slender, flexible body of this shark allows it to wriggle into narrow holes and crevices in search of food, while its small mouth and thickly muscled <b>buccal</b> <b>cavity</b> allow it to create a powerful suction force with which to extract prey. This species may be preyed upon by larger fishes and marine mammals. Known parasites of the zebra shark include four species of tapeworms in the genus Pedibothrium.|$|E
5|$|The {{epaulette}} shark is an opportunistic predator of benthic crustaceans, worms, and small bony fish. Off Heron Island, over 90% of the {{epaulette shark}}'s diet consists of polychaete worms and crabs, with juveniles taking mostly {{the former and}} adults mostly the latter. It hunts most actively at dawn and dusk, though feeding can occur {{at any time during}} the day. This shark relies mainly on its olfactory and electroreceptive senses to locate hidden prey. It is capable of sucking prey into its mouth by expanding its muscular <b>buccal</b> <b>cavity.</b> While searching for food, the epaulette shark sometimes turns over debris with its snout or thrusts its head into the sand, swallowing food items while expelling the sand grains through its gill slits. Unlike most sharks, the epaulette shark may chew its food for up to 510 minutes. Its teeth can be depressed to form a flat surface for crushing hard-shelled prey.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} microleakage around class V restorations using a flowable composite compared to a hybrid composite. Forty class V cavities were prepared on buccal and lingual surfaces of 20 human teeth, with occlusal and cervical margins at the enamel and cementum/dentin levels, respectively. Specimens were divided into 2 groups with 10 samples each. Group 1 : <b>buccal</b> <b>cavities</b> received Paama 2 (conventional bonding agent) + Wave (flowable composite); lingual cavities were restored with Paama 2 + Glacier (hybrid composite). Group 2 : <b>buccal</b> <b>cavities</b> received Optibond Solo (self-priming bonding agent) + Wave; lingual cavities were restored with Optibond Solo + Glacier. After being stored in distilled water and finished, the teeth were thermocycled, immersed in a 50 % silver nitrate solution and embedded in resin. They were sectioned and the depth of tracer penetration was scored. The results were analyzed using Kruskall-Wallis and Wilcoxon tests. The restorations with flowable composite and those with hybrid composite from the same group showed similar results of microleakage for both occlusal and cervical margins. Optibond Solo improved the sealing of the restorations when compared with Paama 2 (p< 0. 01).

5|$|The {{leopard shark}} captures prey by {{expanding}} its <b>buccal</b> <b>cavity</b> {{to create a}} suction force, which is facilitated by its labial cartilages swinging forward to form the mouth into a tube. Simultaneously, the shark protrudes its jaws forward to grip the prey between its teeth. As with other sharks, {{the teeth of the}} leopard shark are periodically shed and replaced; it takes 9ndash&12 days for a replacement tooth to move into position. Leopard sharks have been caught with stomachs filled with clam siphons, which the sharks seize before the clams can retract and break off with a levering motion of their bodies. On occasion, the shark tears the entire clam body out of its shell this way. Other sharks examined have had stomachs containing whole innkeeper worms with no bite marks, suggesting that the sharks sucked them out of their burrows. Under a hollow bridge support in San Francisco Bay, a group of leopard sharks and spiny dogfish have been observed feeding on a dense school of anchovies by slowly swimming counterclockwise through the clockwise-swimming school, and swallowing any anchovies that accidentally entered their open mouths.|$|E
5|$|Fish from {{multiple}} groups can live {{out of the}} water for extended periods. Amphibious fish such as the mudskipper can live and move about on land for up to several days, or live in stagnant or otherwise oxygen depleted water. Many such fish can breathe air via a variety of mechanisms. The skin of anguillid eels may absorb oxygen directly. The <b>buccal</b> <b>cavity</b> of the electric eel may breathe air. Catfish of the families Loricariidae, Callichthyidae, and Scoloplacidae absorb air through their digestive tracts. Lungfish, {{with the exception of the}} Australian lungfish, and bichirs have paired lungs similar to those of tetrapods and must surface to gulp fresh air through the mouth and pass spent air out through the gills. Gar and bowfin have a vascularized swim bladder that functions in the same way. Loaches, trahiras, and many catfish breathe by passing air through the gut. Mudskippers breathe by absorbing oxygen across the skin (similar to frogs). A number of fish have evolved so-called accessory breathing organs that extract oxygen from the air. Labyrinth fish (such as gouramis and bettas) have a labyrinth organ above the gills that performs this function. A few other fish have structures resembling labyrinth organs in form and function, most notably snakeheads, pikeheads, and the Clariidae catfish family.|$|E

50|$|Many sea {{cucumbers}} are mobile deposit or suspension feeders, using their buccal podia to actively capture food and then stuffing the particles individually into their <b>buccal</b> <b>cavities.</b> Others ingest {{large quantities of}} sediment, absorb the organic matter and pass the indigestible mineral particles through their guts. In this way they disturb and process large volumes of substrate, often leaving characteristic ridges of sediment on the seabed. Some {{sea cucumbers}} live infaunally in burrows, anterior-end down and anus on the surface, swallowing sediment and passing it through their gut.

40|$|The present invitro {{study was}} {{conducted}} to assess the marginal adaptation and apposition of amalgam restorations bonded to tooth structure, using freshly mixed luting glass ionomer cement (type 1) and compared with the much documented material [...] Amalgam bond (4 -META). Twelve freshly extracted human premolar teeth were used and class V cavities were prepared on the buccal and lingual surfaces of twelve teeth for the experimental groups. <b>Buccal</b> <b>cavities</b> (class V) were prepared on twelve other teeth for the control group. In the control, two coats of cavity varnish was applied as the liner. The experimental groups were lined with freshly mixed luting glass ionomer in twelve <b>buccal</b> <b>cavities</b> and amalgam bond adhesive liner in twelve lingual cavities. The amalgam was then condensed before the liner sets in all the cavities. The teeth were sectioned and mounted on aluminum stubs and then placed in the scanning electron microscope and were observed. The results of the study showed that marginal interface gaps were higher with luting glass ionomer and cavity varnish than with amalgam bond as the liner. The results were statistically not significant. All the three groups were effected by the severe thermal stresses introduced by the microscopy with the glass ionomer cement suffering the worst. The present investigation confirms that glass ionomer cement (type 1) can be effectively used as a bonding agent between amalgam and the tooth when it is painted onto the cavity walls after which the amalgam is condensed immediately, prior to its setting. Its ability to bond amalgam to the tooth structure with minimal gaps is comparable to that of amalgam bond...|$|R

50|$|Species of this genus are diurnal and {{generally}} {{are found in}} small streams or along the margins of larger rivers, clinging to substrates using the mouth as a sucker and feeding on algae or aufwuchs on roots, stones, macrophytes and broad-leaved grasses.

They lay adhesive eggs and do not guard them; this is in contrast to many other loricariids where the male builds a nest and guards the eggs. These fish live in shoals or schools. Otocinclus are able to breathe air. Prior to surfacing, they will release air through their gills and mouth.

40|$|Rorqual whales (Balaenopteridae) {{represent}} {{not only}} some of the largest animals of all time, but also exhibit a wide range in intraspecific and interspecific body size. Balaenopterids are characterized by their extreme lunge-feeding behaviour, a dynamic process that involves the engulfment of a large volume of prey-laden water at a high energetic cost. To investigate the consequences of scale and morphology on lunge-feeding performance, we determined allometric equations for fin whale body dimensions and engulfment capacity. Our analysis demonstrates that larger fin whales have larger skulls and larger <b>buccal</b> <b>cavities</b> relative to body size. Together, these data suggest that engulfment volume is also allometric, increasing with body length as. The positive allometry of the skull is accompanied by negative allometry in the tail region. The relative shortening of the tail may represent a trade-off for investing all growth-related resources in the anterior region of the body. Although enhanced engulfment volume will increase foraging efficiency, the work (energy) required to accelerate the engulfed water mass during engulfment will be relatively higher in larger rorquals. If the mass-specific energetic cost of a lunge increases with body size, it will have major consequences for rorqual foraging ecology and evolution...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{biocompatibility}} of resin-modified glass ionomers (RMGIs) as {{a lining}} material {{is still under}} question. The present study evaluated {{the response of the}} pulp-dentin complex following application of resin-modified glass-ionomer cement, calcium hydroxide and conventional glass-ionomer in deep cavities prepared in human teeth. Materials and Methods: In this controlled clinical trial, 30 deep class V <b>buccal</b> <b>cavities</b> (3 mm × 2 mm × 2 mm) were prepared in human premolars treatment planned to be extracted for orthodontic reasons and divided into 3 groups.

Each group was then divided into two sub-groups according to time intervals 5 and 30 days. The patients were referred to Kerman Dental School and in accordance with orthodontic treatment plan; premolars were extracted and then prepared for histological assessment. The sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and periodic acid Schiff techniques.

25|$|Mate {{choice is}} seen in {{cuttlefish}} species, where females prefer some males over others, though characteristics of the preferred males are unknown. A hypothesis states that females reject males by olfactory cues rather than visual cues. Several cephalopod species are polyandrous- accepting and storing multiple male spermatophores, which has been identified by DNA fingerprinting. Females are no longer receptive to mating attempts when holding their eggs in their arm. Females can store sperm in two places (1) the <b>buccal</b> <b>cavity</b> where recently mated males place their spermatophores, and (2) the internal sperm-storage receptacles where sperm packages from previous males are stored. Spermatophore storage results in sperm competition; which states that the female controls which mate fertilizes the eggs. In order to reduce this sort of competition, males develop agonistic behaviors like mate guarding and flushing. Flushing is used by both the male and female; it {{is the process of}} removing spermatophores of other males by continuously pumping strong jets of water into the <b>buccal</b> <b>cavity</b> of the female. This behavior however, reduces the available time to mate with other females.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the alimentary canal, insects also have paired salivary glands and salivary reservoirs. These structures usually reside in the thorax (adjacent to the fore-gut). The salivary glands (30) produce saliva; the salivary ducts lead from the glands to the reservoirs and then forward through the head to an opening called the salivarium behind the hypopharynx; which movements of the mouthparts help mix saliva with food in the <b>buccal</b> <b>cavity.</b> Saliva mixes with food, which travels through salivary tubes into the mouth, beginning the process of breaking it down.|$|E
25|$|As {{in other}} ostariophysan fishes, the swim bladder has two chambers. The {{anterior}} chamber {{is connected to}} the inner ear by a series of small bones derived from neck vertebrae called the Weberian apparatus, which greatly enhances its hearing capability. The posterior chamber extends along the whole length of the body and maintains the fish's buoyancy. E. electricus has a well-developed sense of hearing. This fish has a vascularized respiratory system with gas exchange occurring through epithelial tissue in its <b>buccal</b> <b>cavity.</b> As obligate air-breathers, electric eels must rise to the surface every ten minutes or so to inhale before returning to the bottom. Nearly eighty percent of the oxygen used by the fish is obtained in this way.|$|E
40|$|Human {{hookworm}} disease, {{a clinical}} condition caused by Ancylostoma duodenale or Necator americanus infection, affects up to 630 {{million people in}} the developing world (1). Using their <b>buccal</b> <b>cavities</b> and hooklike teeth, the adult parasites attach themselves to villi in the small intestine. Each worm can then extract up to 0. 20 ml of blood per day causing intestinal blood loss and ultimately iron-deficiency anemia and hypoalbuminemia (2, 3). To date the biochemical mechanism by which hookworms prevent blood coagulation while feeding remains unexplained. Previous studies have shown that extracts of the dog hookworm Ancylostoma caninum can prolong prothrombin time (PT) 1 (4 - 6), with variable effects on partial thromboplastin time (PTT) (4 - 6), and interfere with collagen- or ADP-induced platelet aggregation, as well as inhibit the action of factor Xa (6). The recent finding of a proteolytic enzyme with anticlotting properties from the giant leech Haementeria ghilianii (7) led us to examine whether a similar proteolytic anticoagulant exists in the Ancylostoma hookworms. Data presented here suggests that the Ancylostoma hookworms secrete a 36, 000 dalton protease which both interferes with fibrin clot formation and promotes fibrin clot dissolution. This proteolytic enzyme could be critical for continuous exsanguination from villous capillaries and therefore represents a potential target for immunological intervention.

All the <b>buccal</b> <b>cavities</b> were pretreated with polyacrylic acid, whereas the lingual cavities were treated with three one-step Self-Etch adhesives, respectively, Xeno III (Dentsply Detrey GmbH, Konstanz, Germany), iBond exp (Heraeus Kulzer gmbH & Co. KG, Hanau, Germany), and Adper Prompt-L-Pop (3 M ESPE AG, Dental products Seefeld, Germany). All cavities were completely filled with RMGIC, teeth were thermocycled for 800 cycles, and leakage was evaluated. Results were expressed as means ± standard deviations (SDs). Microleakage scores were analysed by means of generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) assuming an ordinal logistic link function. All results were considered to be significant at the 5 % critical level (P <. 05). The results showed that bonding RMGIC to dentin with a Self-Etch adhesive rather than using polyacrylic acid did not influence microleakage scores (P =. 091), except for one tested Self-Etch adhesive, namely, Xeno III (P <. 0001). Nevertheless, our results did not show any significant difference between the three tested Self-Etch adhesive systems. In conclusion, the pretreatment of dentin with Self-Etch adhesive system, before RMGIC filling, seems to be an alternative to the conventional Dentin Conditioner for the clinicians as suggested by our results (thermocycling) and others (microtensile tests) ...|$|R
25|$|As {{the eggs}} of both Ancylostoma and Necator (and most other {{hookworm}} species) are indistinguishable, {{to identify the}} genus, they must be cultured in the lab to allow larvae to hatch out. If the fecal sample is left {{for a day or}} more under tropical conditions, the larvae will have hatched out, so eggs might no longer be evident. In such a case, it is essential to distinguish hookworms from Strongyloides larvae, as infection with the latter has more serious implications and requires different management. The larvae of the two hookworm species can also be distinguished microscopically, although this would not be done routinely, but usually for research purposes. Adult worms are rarely seen (except via endoscopy, surgery or autopsy), but if found, would allow definitive identification of the species. Classification can be performed based on the length of the <b>buccal</b> <b>cavity,</b> the space between the oral opening and the esophagus: hookworm rhabditoform larvae have long buccal cavities whereas Strongyloides rhabditoform larvae have short buccal cavities.|$|E
25|$|Aggressive sex is an {{activity}} that most cephalopods engage in; a protein in the male capsule sheath stimulates this behavior. Male- male aggression is seen in cephalopods; smaller males tend to lose these interactions. When a female is near the males charge on another continuously and begin to flair their arms. If neither male backs away, the arms extend to the back exposing the mouth {{which leads to the}} biting of arm tips. During mate competition males also participate in a technique called flushing. This technique is used by the second male attempting to mate with a female. Flushing removes spermatophores in the <b>buccal</b> <b>cavity</b> that was placed there by the first mate by forcing water into the cavity. Another behavior that males engage in is sneaker mating or mimicry- smaller males adjust their behavior to that of a female in order to reduce aggression. By using this technique, they are able to fertilize the eggs while the larger male is distracted by different male. During this process, the sneaker males quickly insert drop like sperm into the seminal receptacle.|$|E

40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that resin penetration into vital, deep, exposed dentin is {{hampered by the}} presence of dentinal fluid and intratubular contents following removal of the smear layer. Deep <b>buccal</b> <b>cavities</b> were prepared in ten vital, caries-free premolars to be extracted for orthodontic reasons and restored with All-Bond 2 (Bisco) and Z 100 (3 M Corp.) using a total etch wet bonding technique. In addition, ten unrestored, caries-free third molars were used as the control. The roots of the specimens were severed using a diamond disc and the crowns fixed immediately upon removal, cryofractured in liquid nitrogen, post-fixed in 1 % osmium tetroxide, dehydrated in an ascending ethanol series, dried by critical point drying and examined in the scanning electron microscope. Resin tag formation in the dentinal tubules was characterized by the initial presence of a solid resin core replacing the original smear plugs, followed {{by the presence of}} resin globules further down, attaching to the walls of the dentinal tubules. This did not, however, represent the full extent of resin penetration, as isolated resin globules were also observed further down the predentin and around the odontoblasts. Similar spherical resin globules with a mean size of 0. 78 ± 0. 33 μm could be reproduced in vitro, when All-Bond 2 primers were applied to water through a polycarbonate disc with a pore size of 1 μm. The fact that similar resin globules were not previously observed within the pulpodentinal complex of a group of specimens that were extracted after a post-restorative period of 21 - 28 days suggested that they might have been removed by phagocytic cells in the pulp during the period of tissue response...|$|R

Both total uptake and uptake per unit biomass were by far highest in the ostracod Candona neglecta accounting for 46 % of the total meiofauna uptake. The total uptake of C- 14 was significantly different among all 3 common ostracod species, Candona neglecta taking 10 and 100 times more than Paracyprideis fennica and Heterocyprideis sorbyana respectively. Nematodes accounted for over 40 % of the total uptake of C- 14 in the microcosms, of which 84 % was taken up by large nematode species such as Paracanthonchus spp. Nematodes with similar <b>buccal</b> <b>cavities</b> and of similar size showed surprisingly large differences in the uptake of the radio-labelled material.
