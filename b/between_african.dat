Pułaski sailed variously in the North Atlantic, <b>between</b> <b>African</b> ports, and in the Indian Ocean. In 1946, the ship's name was changed to Empire Penryn and continued trooping duties under the management of Lamport & Holt. She was scrapped in 1949 at Blyth.|$|E

5|$|Simultaneously, the African Group {{started to}} demand two {{permanent}} seats for themselves, {{on the basis}} of historical injustices and because much of the Council's agenda is concentrated in that continent.

5|$|Genetic {{differences}} exist between different racial groups which affect {{the risk of}} developing alcohol dependence. For example, there are differences <b>between</b> <b>African,</b> East Asian and Indo-racial groups in how they metabolize alcohol. These genetic factors are believed to, in part, explain the differing rates of alcohol dependence among racial groups. The alcohol dehydrogenase allele ADH1 B*3 causes a more rapid metabolism of alcohol. The allele ADH1 B*3 is only found in those of African descent and certain Native American tribes. African Americans and Native Americans with this allele have a reduced risk of developing alcoholism. Native Americans however, have a significantly higher rate of alcoholism than average; it is unclear why this is the case. Other risk factors such as cultural environmental effects e.g. trauma have been proposed to explain the higher rates of alcoholism among Native Americans compared to alcoholism levels in caucasians.|$|E
25|$|The Organization of African Unity (OAU) {{was founded}} May 1963. Its basic {{principles}} were co-operation <b>between</b> <b>African</b> nations and solidarity <b>between</b> <b>African</b> peoples. Another important {{objective of the}} OAU was an end to all forms of colonialism in Africa. This became the major objective of the organization in its first years and soon OAU pressure led {{to the situation in}} the Portuguese colonies being brought up at the UN Security Council.|$|E
25|$|Racist {{thinking}} among {{and between}} minority groups does occur; {{examples of this}} are conflicts between blacks and Korean immigrants, notably in the 1992 Los Angeles Riots, and <b>between</b> <b>African</b> Americans and non-white Latino immigrants. There {{has been a long}} running racial tension <b>between</b> <b>African</b> American and Mexican prison gangs, as well as significant riots in California prisons where they have targeted each other, for ethnic reasons. There have been reports of racially motivated attacks against African Americans who have moved into neighborhoods occupied mostly by people of Mexican origin, and vice versa. There has also been an increase in violence between non-Hispanic Anglo Americans and Latino immigrants, and <b>between</b> <b>African</b> immigrants and African Americans.|$|E

25|$|The melanocortin 1 {{receptor}} (MC1R) gene {{is primarily}} responsible for determining whether pheomelanin and eumelanin is produced in the human body. Research shows at least 10 differences in MC1R <b>between</b> <b>African</b> and chimpanzee samples and that the gene has probably undergone a strong positive selection (a selective sweep) in early Hominins around 1.2 million years ago. This is consistent with positive selection for the high-eumelanin phenotype seen in Africa and other environments with high UV exposure.|$|E
25|$|Although Thompson {{acknowledges}} similarities <b>between</b> <b>African</b> and European cool in shared {{notions of}} self-control and imperturbability, {{he finds the}} cultural value of cool in Africa which influenced the African diaspora {{to be different from}} that held by Europeans, who use the term primarily as the ability to remain calm under stress. According to Thompson, there is significant weight, meaning and spirituality attached to cool in traditional African cultures, something which, Thompson argues, is absent from the idea in a Western context.|$|E
25|$|The KIT ligand (KITLG) gene is {{involved}} in the permanent survival, proliferation and migration of melanocytes. A mutation in this gene, A326G (rs642742), has been positively associated with variations of skin color in African-Americans of mixed West African and European descent and is estimated to account for 15–20% of the melanin difference <b>between</b> <b>African</b> and European populations. This allele shows signs of strong positive selection outside Africa and occurs in over 80% of European and Asian samples, compared with less than 10% in African samples.|$|E

25|$|Oculocutaneous {{albinism}} II (OCA2) {{assists in}} the regulation of pH in melanocytes. The OCA2 gene's derived His615Arg (rs1800414) allele {{has been shown to}} account for about 8% of the skin tone difference <b>between</b> <b>African</b> and East Asian populations in studies of an East Asian population living in Toronto and a Chinese Han population. This variant is essentially restricted to East Asia, with highest frequencies in Eastern East Asia (49–63%), midrange frequencies in Southeast Asia, and the lowest frequencies in Western China and some Eastern European populations.|$|E
25|$|The AIM framework. In a pilot study, {{researchers}} {{examined the}} role of AIM—ability, incentives, and management feedback—in reducing care disparity in pressure-ulcer detection <b>between</b> <b>African</b> American and Caucasian residents. The results showed that while the program was implemented, the provision of (1) training to enhance ability, (2) monetary incentives to enhance motivation, and (3) management feedback to enhance accountability led to successful reduction in pressure ulcers. Specifically, the detection {{gap between the two}} groups decreased. The researchers suggested additional replications with longer duration to assess the effectiveness of the AIM framework.|$|E
25|$|In Africa, Ivorian {{diplomacy}} favors step-by-step {{economic and}} political cooperation. In 1959, Ivory Coast formed the Council of the Entente with Dahomey (Benin), Upper Volta (Burkina Faso), Niger and Togo; in 1965, the African and Malagasy Common Organization (OCAM); in 1972, the Economic Community of West Africa (CEAO). The last mentioned organisation changing to the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in 1975. A {{founding member of the}} Organization of African Unity (OAU) in 1963 and then of the African Union in 2000, Ivory Coast defends respect for state sovereignty and peaceful cooperation <b>between</b> <b>African</b> countries.|$|E

25|$|With African Americans and Asian Americans, the ratios {{are even}} further imbalanced, with roughly {{five times more}} Asian female/African male marriages than Asian male/African female marriages. However, C.N. Le {{estimated}} that among Asian Americans of the 1.5 generation and of the five largest Asian American ethnic groups this ratio narrows to approximately two to one. Even though the disparity <b>between</b> <b>African</b> American and Asian American interracial marriages by gender is high according to the 2000 US Census, the total numbers of Asian American/African American interracial marriages are low, numbering only 0.22% percent for Asian American male marriages and 1.30% percent of Asian female marriages, partially contributed by the recent flux of Asian immigrants.|$|E
25|$|Throughout American history, {{there has}} been {{frequent}} mixing between Native Americans and black Africans. When Native Americans invaded the European colony of Jamestown, Virginia in 1622, they killed the Europeans but took the African slaves as captives, gradually integrating them. Interracial relationships occurred <b>between</b> <b>African</b> Americans and members of other tribes along coastal states. During the transitional period of Africans becoming the primary race enslaved, Native Americans were sometimes enslaved with them. Africans and Native Americans worked together, some even intermarried and had mixed children. The relationship between Africans and Native-Americans {{was seen as a}} threat to Europeans and European-Americans, who actively tried to divide Native-Americans and Africans and put them against each other.|$|E
25|$|Variations in the KITL gene {{have been}} {{positively}} associated with about 20% of melanin concentration differences <b>between</b> <b>African</b> and non-African populations. One of the alleles of the gene has an 80% occurrence rate in Eurasian populations. The ASIP gene has a 75–80% variation rate among Eurasian populations compared to 20–25% in African populations. Variations in the SLC24A5 gene account for 20–25% of the variation between dark and light skinned populations of Africa, and appear to have arisen as recently as within the last 10,000 years. The Ala111Thr or rs1426654 polymorphism in the coding region of the SLC24A5 gene reaches fixation in Europe, but is found across the globe, particularly among populations in Northern Africa, the Horn of Africa, West Asia, Central Asia and South Asia.|$|E
