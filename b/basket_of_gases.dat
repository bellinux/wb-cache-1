40|$|Hydrofluorocarbons are {{powerful}} greenhouse gases developed by industry after the phase-out {{of the ozone}} depleting chlorofluorocarbons and hydrochlorofluorocarbons required by the Montreal Protocol. The climate benefit of reducing the emissions of hydrofluorocarbons has been widely recognised, leading to an amendment of the Montreal Protocol (Kigali Amendment) calling for developed countries to start to phase-down hydrofluorocarbons by 2019 and in developing countries to follow with a freeze between 2024 and 2028. In this way, nearly half a degree Celsius of warming would be avoided {{by the end of}} the century. Hydrofluorocarbons are also included in the <b>basket</b> <b>of</b> <b>gases</b> controlled under the Kyoto Protocol of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Annex I parties to the Convention submit annual national greenhouse gas inventories based on a bottom-up approach, which relies on declared anthropogenic activities. Top-down methodologies, based on atmospheric measurements and modelling, can be used in support to the inventory compilation. In this study we used atmospheric data from four European sites combined with the FLEXPART dispersion model and a Bayesian inversion method, in order to derive emissions of nine individual hydrofluorocarbons from the whole European Geographic Domain and from twelve regions within it, then comparing our results with the annual emissions that the European countries submit every year to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, as well as with the bottom-up Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research. We found several discrepancies when considering the specific compounds and on the country level. However, an overall agreement is found when comparing European aggregated data, which between 2008 and 2014 are on average 84. 2 ± 28. 0 Tg-CO 2 -eqyr 1 against the 95. 1 Tg-CO 2 -eqyr 1 reported by UNFCCC in the same period. Therefore, in agreement with other studies, the gap on the global level between bottom-up estimates of Annex I countries and total global top-down emissions should be essentially due to emissions from non-reporting countries (non-Annex I) ...|$|E

Although the overall greenhouse gas emissions in the UK have fallen, annual net carbon dioxide emission has increased by about 2% since the Labour Party {{came to power in}} 1997. As a result, it now seems highly unlikely that the government will be able to honour its pledge to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 20% from the 1990 level by 2010, unless an immediate and drastic action is taken under after the ratification of the Climate Change Bill.|$|R
40|$|Nitrogen trifluoride (NF 3) can {{be called}} the missing {{greenhouse}} gas: It is a synthetic chemical produced in industrial quantities; it {{is not included in}} the Kyoto <b>basket</b> <b>of</b> greenhouse <b>gases</b> or in national reporting under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC); and there are no observations documenting its atmospheric abundance. Current publications report a long lifetime of 740 yr and a global warming potential (GWP), which in the Kyoto basket is second only to SF 6. We re-examine the atmospheric chemistry of NF 3  and calculate a shorter lifetime of 550 yr, but still far beyond any societal time frames. With 2008 production equivalent to 67 million metric tons of CO 2, NF 3  has a potential greenhouse impact larger than that of the industrialized nations' emissions of PFCs or SF 6, or even that of the world's largest coal-fired power plants. If released, annual production would increase the lower atmospheric abundance by 0. 4 ppt, and it is urgent to document NF 3  emissions through atmospheric observations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The global {{three-dimensional}} Lagrangian chemistry-transport model STOCHEM {{has been}} used to follow the changes in the tropospheric distributions of the two major radiatively-active trace gases, methane and tropospheric ozone, following the emission of pulses of the short-lived tropospheric ozone precursor species, methane, carbon monoxide, NOx and hydrogen. The radiative impacts of NOx emissions were dependent on the location chosen for the emission pulse, whether at the surface or in the upper troposphere or whether in the northern or southern hemispheres. Global warming potentials were derived for each of the short-lived tropospheric ozone precursor species by integrating the methane and tropospheric ozone responses over a 100 -year time horizon. Indirect radiative forcing due to methane and tropospheric ozone changes appear to be significant for all of the tropospheric ozone precursor species studied. Whereas the radiative forcing from methane changes is likely to be dominated by methane emissions, that from tropospheric ozone changes is controlled by all the tropospheric ozone precursor gases, particularly NOx emissions. The indirect radiative forcing impacts of tropospheric ozone changes may be large enough such that ozone precursors should be considered in the <b>basket</b> <b>of</b> trace <b>gases</b> through which policy-makers aim to combat global climate change. 1...|$|R
40|$|This {{brochure}} {{gives an}} overview of the underlying factors for greenhouse gas emission trends in Germany and the UK in the 1990 s. The main focus of the brochure was to assess, to which extend the observed reductions <b>of</b> the specified <b>basket</b> <b>of</b> six greenhouse <b>gases</b> are the result of special circumstances, i. e. the reunification of Germany and the liberalisation of the energy markets in the UK, and to which extend these emissions reductions are the result of specific policy measures. For both of the country case studies it can be concluded that emission reductions arising from special circumstances account for 40 - 50 % of the reductions for all Kyoto gases, and for almost 60 % for energy-related CO 2 emissions. However, environmental policies in both countries also had a major impact on the reduction <b>of</b> greenhouse <b>gases.</b> Thus, the observed reductions are mix of both, coincidence and hard work. Nevertheless, both countries, and perhaps the UK even more than Germany, might miss their national targets unless additional policies are implemented in the near future...|$|R

Today, the most common unconventional hydrocarbon resources are Shale Gas, Coal Bed Methane, Tight Reservoirs, Basin Centered Gas etc (Fig. 1).

In India so far, 26 basins have been recognized {{and they have been}} divided into four categories based on their degree of prospectivity with total area of 3. 14 million sq. km (Source, DGH).

40|$|The MIT Emissions Prediction and Policy Analysis {{model is}} applied to an {{assessment}} {{of a set of}} cap-and-trade proposals being considered by the U. S. Congress in spring 2007. The bills specify emissions reductions to be achieved through 2050 for the standard six-gas <b>basket</b> <b>of</b> greenhouse <b>gases.</b> They fall into two groups: one specifies emissions reductions of 50 % to 80 % below 1990 levels by 2050; the other establishes a tightening target for emissions intensity and stipulates a time-path for a “safety valve ” limit on the emission price that approximately stabilizes U. S. emissions at the 2008 level. A set of three synthetic emissions paths are defined that span the range of stringency of these proposals, and these “core ” cases are analyzed for their consequences in terms of emissions prices, effects on energy markets, welfare cost, the potential revenue generation if allowances are auctioned and the gains if permit revenue were used to reduce capital or labor taxes. Initial period prices for the first group of proposals, in carbon dioxide equivalents, are estimated between $ 30 and $ 50 per ton CO 2 -e depending on where each falls in the 50 % to 80 % range, with these prices rising by a factor of four by 2050. Welfare costs are less than 0. 5 % at the start, rising in the most stringent case to near 2 % in 2050. If allowances were auctioned these proposals could produce revenue between $ 100 billion and $ 500 billion per year depending on the case. Emissions prices for the second group, which result from the specified safety-valve path, ris...|$|R
40|$|Draft paper: {{please do}} not quote without {{permission}} of the author. Throughout the series of international negotiations leading to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol, Germany, along with the European Union (EU), {{have been at the}} forefront of efforts to address the challenges of global warming. In October 1990, for example, the European Community (EC) adopted a target of stabilizing carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000 – a position pushed, in part, by the German and like-minded European governments to give them greater influence in those international climate change negotiations. In advance of the third conference of the parties (COP 3) to the FCCC, the European Union called for a 15 percent cut in CO 2 emissions by 2010. This EU target was based on a burden-sharing arrangement in which Germany was a major contributor—a 25 percent reduction in domestic CO 2 emissions, which translated into an estimated 80 percent of total EU reductions. In the aftermath of the compromise reached at Kyoto, the burden-sharing arrangements negotiated within the EU called for Germany to undertake a 21 percent domestic cut in emissions <b>of</b> the <b>basket</b> <b>of</b> six greenhouse <b>gases</b> (GHGs) stipulated in the Kyoto Protocol...|$|R

40|$|For {{the first}} time, the Protocol {{negotiated}} {{by the third}} Conference of the Parties to the U. N. Framework Convention on Climate Change in Kyoto sets legally binding emission targets for the commitment period 2008 - 2012 for the industrial countries and countries in transition listed in Annex I. These targets encompass a <b>basket</b> <b>of</b> six greenhouse <b>gases</b> {{and do not have}} to be reached by domestic emission reduction alone. The Protocol allows the use of less costly emission reduction potential abroad through four mechanisms: common targets or "bubbles" (Art. 4), emission trade (Art. 17), Joint Implementation (Art. 6) and projects of the "Clean Development Mechanism" (CDM) with countries without emission targets (Art. 12). Bubbles withstanding they shall be "supplemental" to domestic measures. Supplementarity has not been defined in the Protocol, though. If average emissions in the commitment period are lower than the emission target the difference can be banked for the next commitment period. Due to time pressure during negotiation of the Protocol rules for the use of flexibility mechanisms remain vague. Thus the next Conference of the Parties has to settle many details. This study makes suggestions for the solution of these open issues on the base of the goal of economic efficient emission reduction. It also considers the political feasibility of these suggestions...|$|R
