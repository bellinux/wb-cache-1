For some applications, both {{the inner and}} outer race must be mounted with an interference fit and care must be taken during assembly and disassembly to avoid placing heavy static loads between the balls and races otherwise Brinell dent type damage can occur. In this paper, a highly dent resistant superelastic alloy, 60 NiTi, is considered for rolling element bearing applications that encounter excessive static axial loading during assembly or disassembly. A small (R 8) ball bearing is designed for an application in which access to the bearing races to apply disassembly tools is precluded. First Principles analyses show that by careful selection of materials, raceway curvature and land geometry, a bearing can be designed that allows <b>blind</b> <b>assembly</b> and disassembly without incurring raceway damage due to ball denting. Though such <b>blind</b> <b>assembly</b> applications are uncommon, the availability of bearings with unusually high static load capability may enable more such applications with additional benefits, especially for miniature bearings...|$|R

40|$|One of most {{demanding}} tasks {{in the manufacturing}} field is controlling the variability of parts as it may affect strongly the deliverability of key characteristics defined at the final (product) assembly level. Current CAT systems offer a good solution to the tolerance analysis/synthesis task, but to handle flexible objects with shape errors more effort is needed to include methods able to capture the elastic behaviour of parts that adds more variability on the final assembly. Usually, sheet metal assemblies require dedicated fixtures and clamps layout to control the gap between parts in the specific location where a join must be placed. Due to the variability of parts the position of clamps can also be varied. The paper describes a FEM-based method able take into account part flexibility and shape error to parametrically analyse sheet metal assemblies by acting on some key parameters {{to look for the}} optimal clamp layout that guarantee the gap between parts to be under control after joining parts together. This method offers, with respect to commercial solutions, the ability to model fixtures, clamps and different joint types with no matter on the mesh nodes’ position. Locations of such elements are based on the shape functions defined at element (shell) mesh level and modelled as local constraints. So the user can generate a mesh without a previous knowledge of the exact positions of clamps, for example. This allows to conduit a faster parametric analysis without remeshing the surfaces and with no need to physically model the clamps.

5000|$|For {{much of the}} Victorian [...] "age of steam", {{the only}} {{material}} used for boilermaking was the highest grade of wrought iron, with <b>assembly</b> by <b>rivetting.</b> This iron was often obtained from specialist ironworks, such as at Cleator Moor (UK), noted for the high quality of their rolled plate and its suitability for high-reliability use in critical applications, such as high-pressure boilers. In the 20th century, design practice instead moved towards the use of steel, which is stronger and cheaper, with welded construction, which is quicker and requires less labour. It should be noted, however, that wrought iron boilers corrode far slower than their modern-day steel counterparts, and are less susceptible to localized pitting and stress-corrosion. This makes the longevity of older wrought-iron boilers far superior to those of welded steel boilers.|$|R

40|$|International audienceAdhesively bonded <b>assemblies,</b> unlike <b>riveted</b> or bolted joints, do {{not require}} holes, {{which can lead to}} large stress {{concentrations}} in composites. For this reason adhesive bonding is attracting attention particularly when weight is critical. But failure in adhesively bonded assemblies involving composites is often associated with crack initiation in the adhesive or delamination of the composite plies close to the adhesive joint caused by interlaminar or through-thickness stresses. Such assemblies are often characterized by large stress concentrations, which make the analysis of their behaviour for industrial applications difficult. As the mechanical behaviour of adhesives and of composites are quite complex, a large database of experimental results under various loading conditions is necessary to develop accurate numerical models. Unfortunately, few experimental devices allow out-of-plane loading to be studied, except for specific loadings or by using thick composite specimens which are not always representative of industrial applications. This paper presents the possibilities of an experimental device, using a modified Arcan test, and optimized hybrid bonded assemblies, which limit the influence of edge effects. Some test results, showing the potential of the approach, are presented in the form of failure envelope curves for proportional monotonic out-of-plane loadings.

Dedicated Tooling clamps the aircraft parts to be assembled into the jig to enable <b>assembly</b> by <b>riveting.</b> However, increased competition in the aircraft industry has driven the need to improve quality while reducing cost and in turn the need for innovative solutions to accomplish this. In this review paper the possibility of using metrology to increase the position accuracy in robotics will be examined. This is necessary {{to be able to use}} robotics in assembly of aircraft parts with the appropriate accuracy. Also, because of the small product volumes in the aircraft industry, the jigs must be flexible in order to assemble more than one structure in each jig.

Many comparisons between experiments and FE computations of bird impacts onto aluminium riveted panels have shown that macroscopic plastic strains were not sufficiently developed (and localised) in the riveted shell FE in the impact area. Consequently, FE models never succeed in initialising and propagating the rupture in the sheet metal plates and along rivet rows as shown by experiments, without calibrating the input data (especially the damage and failure properties of the riveted shell FE). To model the assembly correctly, it appears necessary to investigate on FE techniques such as Hybrid-Trefftz finite element method (H-T FEM).

Some {{of the authors of the}} paper formulated and validated a hybrid-Trefftz perforated super-element able to take into account the stress concentrations due to the hole. The hole boundary however was intrinsically a load-free analytical boundary making impossible the interaction of the super-element for the perforated plate with the rivet macro-models. In this paper, a new 16 -node hybrid-Trefftz perforated super-element featuring 8 nodes on the hole boundary is formulated in order to model this interaction thanks to the new nodes and the FE hole boundary. The new perforated super-element is first validated by considering no loads applied on the nodes of the hole boundary. It is shown that the results obtained with the new super-element are very accurate whatever the test-case considered (e. g., tension, shear) and that the super-element is cost-efficient.

To perform computations aiming at locating rupture initiation in a structure featuring more than 100000 rivets, {{it is necessary to}} model the assembly areas using super-elements. If rivet elements have been developed, perforated plate super-elements are still lacking. Thus, the paper focuses on plate super finite element formulations featuring defects, in particular holes. An original eight-node plate element containing a hole has been selected to discuss on the possibility to extend its formulation from linear (elasticity) to non-linear problems (impact). However, since {{little is known about the}} features of super-elements containing a hole, it is first attempted to clarify the properties of the selected existing super-element. This kind of element is defined according to the introduced nomenclature, and the features of its interpolation functions are highlighted. The location of stress fields computed by this super-element is proved to be in close agreement with results provided by standard FE calculations. This super-element exhibits also computational efficiency. These features encourage one to pursue the extension of this super-element formulation to large high plastic strains and strain rates, aiming at localising rupture initiation when performing crashworthiness computations of structures with many rivets and holes.

The load transfer mechanism in joint structure is studied, including several types of rivets, material properties and structure geometry. The load transfer for each rivet is determined {{as a function of}} crack propagation. Two other mechanisms can affect the load transfer mechanism-interference between the rivet and rivet hole due to riveting process, and clamping pressure between the panels, were also investigated. Since these two mechanisms are complicated to analyze, and rely {{on the quality of the}} manufacture and <b>assembly,</b> the <b>riveting</b> process was well controlled by applying the rivet squeeze force through an MTS machine. ^ Single lap joint specimens, containing fatigue MSD in one row of rivet holes, were cycled to failure under constant amplitude loading. A modified MSD life prediction model is used to estimate fatigue life. Predictions for the growth and coalescence of individual cracks are in accordance with the experimental results. During the fatigue tests, the propagation of some small cracks at low remote stress levels were delayed due to clamping-up stress under the countersink rivet head. Marker band analysis, therefore, is utilized to detect the crack growth information under countersink rivet head and includes the delay effect into the fatigue prediction program. ^ The individual/relative effect of two random variables—the interference fit levels and crack length distribution at rivet holes—on MSD fatigue life is investigated. A thousand Monte Carlo simulations are performed to determine the statistical degradation in residual strength as the Wide Fatigue Damage (WFD) extends by fatigue. The fastener interference, reflected as riveting quality, determines the overall evaluation of fatigue behavior of a lap joint. The influence of both rivet installation (i. e. fastener interference) and initial WFD size on fatigue life and residual strength are presented, and indicate the relative influence of these parameters on structural integrity. ...|$|R

In most industrial design processes, the approaches used to obtain a design solution that best fits the specification requirements result in many iterations of the “trial-and-error” type, starting from an initial solution. In this paper, a method is proposed to formalize the decision process in order to automate it, and to provide optimal design solutions. Two types of knowledge are formalized. The first expresses the satisfaction of design objectives, relating to physical behaviors of candidate design solutions. This formalization uses three models, an observation one, an interpretation one and an aggregation one; every design solution is qualified through a single performance variable (a single objective function). The second model is related to modifications that may or may not be applicable to the pre-existing solution. The Designer is often able to define preferences concerning design variables. Some modifications related to this pre-existing solution, can be preferred to other ones. A hierarchy of design variables is proposed to formalize these preferences. The concept of arc-elasticity is introduced as a post-processing indicator to qualify candidate solutions through a trade-off between the performance improvement and their relative distances to the initial solution.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of alternative materials {{and in particular}} aluminium alloys, for vehicle body applications has impelled {{the development of new}} joining techniques. Traditional joining methods such as spot-welding and arc-welding are being challenged. Self-piercing riveting has attracted considerable interest by the automotive industry and has been used as an alternative to spot-welding in vehicle body <b>assembly.</b> However, self-piercing <b>riveting</b> is a relatively new joining method and as such it is not well understood. The aim of this project was therefore to develop an understanding of the mechanical behaviour of self-piercing riveted joints. The effects of paint-baking, shelf-life, pre-straining and surface condition of the sheet material on the joint quality and behaviour were therefore examined. Aluminium alloy sheet materials, 5754 and AA 6111, were used in this investigation. The project began with a metallographic inspection of cross-sections of samples that were joined under different conditions in order to examine the effect of process variables on the joint quality. This part of the investigation led to the identification of suitable setting parameters that produced joints which, by metallographic inspection, were of good quality. It was also observed that some process variables, such as sheet thickness combination, rivet and die design and setting force, affected the joint quality and therefore needed to be taken into consideration in the choice of the processing parameters. Subsequent work focused on mechanical testing. Lap shear, T-peel, pull-out and fatigue tests were carried out in order to examine the mechanical behaviour and to analyse the failure mechanisms of the joints. The work showed that the strength, the thickness and the surface condition of the riveted sheets affected the strength and the failure mechanisms of the joints. The joint strength was also observed to be dependent on the rivet and anvil design as well as the setting force. In addition, the joint strength and behaviour differed as the specimen geometry thus emphasising the need for a test standard for self-piercing riveted joints. Paint baking led to a marginal and insignificant reduction in the static strength, whilst resulting in a reduction in the fatigue strength of the joints as a consequence of recovery of the 5754 alloy and the removal of the wax-based surface lubricant. The effect of 3...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} fatigue problem on riveted {{structures}} and the correlated experimental tests. The term “fatigue” denotes the cracking of metals under repeated loading. The technique of riveting structures is obsolete {{due to the}} low level of standardization in the construction process. Knowledge concerning riveted structure’s ability to withstand fatigue has not been investigated to the same extent as for modern structures assembled by welding. Nevertheless, many riveted structures are still in service after over 100 years. Clamping force originates when the hot rivet is placed into the hole of the plates and the rivet shorten in length due to cooling. In Europe, a large number of railway bridges are riveted. Moreover, all over the world, the <b>rivet</b> <b>assembly</b> technique has been largely used for different types of buildings. The riveted structures are subjected, evidently, to fatigue degradation as all the other steel structures. The riveted joint complexity and the non-uniform realization lead to a structure-specific consideration. In Europe, current regulations recognise only one fatigue class for riveted structures neglecting the clamping force effect. This approach is characterized by an elevated standard deviation for the assessed results. This research aims to improve the riveted structures fatigue comprehension and to propose appropriate tests. Some elements have been extracted from a dismantled railway bridge located near San Stino di Livenza (Venice). An innovative clamping test (TCT) has been conceived: applying a torsional moment to the rivets and evaluating the sliding friction, the clamping force has been estimated. Contrary to traditional clamping tests, this setup, at an affordable price, provides good precision. Moreover, the test is in-site and does not provoke damages to the examined structure. Fem models of rail bearer have been realized taking into account rivets, holes and multilayer plates section inertia. A specific laboratory set up has been designed with the intention to calibrate the fem models. Frictions and clamping force have been taken into account in the rail bearer models. There is a close correspondence between the non-linear models and the experimental tests. The clamping assumptions, derived from the TCT, have been verified. A full scale fatigue test has been prepared and the first cycles have been monitored. Full scale fatigue tests are sophisticated and involve many parameters. For this test, a specific metallic frame has been designed and realized using advanced fatigue models. An advanced analysis (hot spot method) has been carried out, for the frame, in order to evaluate the stress into the welds. This frame will be used by the DICEA laboratory to test, principally, specimens extracted from bridges...|$|R
