Some sought alternative ways to pursue these narrower goals separately, dropping jatropha altogether, while others tried to supplement jatropha with additional activities to keep pursuing a subset of their initial goals.|$|R
40|$|Most {{products}} and services have many physical and intangible attributes with varied characteristics for a would-be purchaser. For example, toothpaste is not merely "a tooth cleaning product". Rather, for a consumer, it is a <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> <b>objective</b> and subjective characteristics like taste, mouth freshener, decay protection, bad breath, price, and so on. The marketer 2 ̆ 7 s task is the difficult one of deciding how many attributes to build into the product, how much quality to include in each attribute, and how to put the attributes together to gain a competitive advantage. This is notable that key attributes vary by market segment and therefore the marketing effort must change accordingly. This research is designed to have a clearer image and deeper understanding about perceptual maps {{and the effect of}} brand attributes to the perception of the customers. The method used in this research is the quantitative research methodology which will provide a deep insight about perceptual maps.

40|$|In {{order to}} predict the water-vapor {{two-phase}} flow dynamics in a fuel <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> an advanced light-water reactor, large-scale numerical simulations were performed using a highly parallel-vector supercomputer, the earth simulator. Although conventional analysis methods such as subchannel codes and system analysis codes need composition equations based on the experimental data, {{it is difficult to}} obtain high prediction accuracy when experimental data are nothing. Then, the present large-scale direct two-phase flow simulation method was proposed, and the void fraction distributions under the heated flow condition were analyzed. On the other hand, in order to estimate the turbulence characteristics in the fast breeder nuclear rector core, large eddy simulation and direct numerical simulation were carried out under the concentric and eccentric annular channels simulating the simplified bare fuel <b>bundle.</b> An <b>objective</b> <b>of</b> this work is to identify reliable and practical approaches for the simulation of unsteady flows in rod-bundles and related geometries...|$|R

40|$|The {{need for}} global {{data about the}} scale of {{antibiotic}} resistance (ABR) in a geographical explicit and timely manner has been identified by many stakeholders, including the World Health Organization. This primer should help defining the objectives, scale, scope, and structure of possible future efforts. Stakeholders and their expected information demands were identified to generate an inventory <b>of</b> surveillance <b>objectives.</b> For simplification, an original approach was chosen to <b>bundle</b> sets <b>of</b> <b>objectives</b> that represent common demands and can be addressed by common subject areas, which fall into three areas. Subject area I addresses clinical demands and focuses on patients; subject area II addresses public health demands by focusing on metapopulations; subject area III addresses infection control demands and focuses on pathogens. A division into these areas leads to a separation of surveillance activities suggesting a modular approach which can provide complementary information. Moreover, the modules address the conundrum of ABR at the complementary levels of 1) patient, 2) population, and 3) pathogen, which-rather conventionally-follow the operational and professional fault-lines of the main disciplines involved, namely clinical medicine, public health, and biology. Essential features that define different surveillance systems have been listed and taken into consideration when suggesting templates for future efforts. Putting ABR on the global health map is a daunting task as it requires acceptance, agreements, and engagement but also concessions at many different levels. Given the existing gaps in the global diagnostic service landscape only a step-wise approach which defines achievable aims, objectives, and milestones will succeed to produce a sustainable system of international co-operative surveillance of ABR...|$|R

One of the most significant tasks of top management is to identify, understand and deploy the significant Lean practices like quality circle, Kanban, Just-in-time purchasing, etc. The term ‘bundle’ is used to make groups of inter-related and internally consistent Lean practices.

Extensive studies have been carried out by researchers to impart the unique physical properties of CNTs in metal systems and understand their interfacial interactions. However, the thermal, electrical and mechanical advantages of CNTs in metal systems are limited because of their tendency to aggregate together in rope-like <b>bundles.</b> The <b>objective</b> <b>of</b> this research is two-fold: 1) optimize carbon nanotube (CNT) dispersal mechanisms in the fabrication of aluminum carbon nanotube metal-matrix composites (Al-CNT/MMCs) via the powder metallurgy method (PM), 2) characterize the effects of CNT morphology on the physical properties of Al-CNT/MMCs.
