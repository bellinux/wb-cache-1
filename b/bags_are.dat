5|$|In July 2017 after {{modelling}} for the French fashion brand The Kooples's Fall 2017 collection, Ratajkowski was enlisted {{to design}} a 38-piece bag collection for the company. The collection, named Emily By The Kooples, comes in 6 colors and features a leather carryall bag, The Emily Bag. The <b>bags</b> <b>are</b> Italian-made and represent The Kooples' first foray into bags. Later that month she was announced as the feature of cover stories in the August issues of Allure and British Glamour {{as well as a}} nude Patrick Demarchelier photospread for Love magazine.|$|E

50|$|Many {{companies}} offer <b>bags</b> to <b>be</b> used for handling prelit trees. The <b>bag</b> can <b>be</b> strapped along a prelit tree. The tree branches are pulled upwards and the <b>bag</b> <b>is</b> {{placed under the}} tree. Using its handles, the <b>bag</b> <b>is</b> then pulled up over the tree, and the <b>bag</b> can <b>be</b> stored by hanging it from the handles.|$|R
50|$|The {{manufacturing}} of Ziploc bags varies {{among different}} products. The Ziploc Evolve <b>bag</b> <b>is</b> made using 35% less plastic than traditional Ziploc <b>bags</b> and <b>is</b> manufactured using wind power, a cleaner renewable energy source. The Ziploc Evolve <b>bag</b> <b>is</b> also packaged in recycled paperboard, a technique used {{to increase the}} conservation of trees. The regulation Ziploc storage and freezer <b>bag</b> <b>is</b> made from polypropylene plastic resin.|$|R
50|$|A tucker <b>bag</b> <b>is</b> a {{traditional}} food or dinner storage bag {{used in the}} Australian outback. Typically a tucker <b>bag</b> <b>was</b> carried by a swagman or bushman. In its basic design a tucker <b>bag</b> <b>is</b> a pouch or bag with a single entry typically closed with a hoden. Tucker bags can {{come in a variety}} of sizes and in its larger form can be used for carrying other utensils and sleeping gear other than food. In this way the tucker <b>bag</b> can <b>be</b> regarded as an early form of backpack. Common materials used to make tucker <b>bags</b> <b>were</b> leather or oilskin.|$|R

25|$|When lifting {{with more}} than one bag, {{allowance}} should be made for reduced filling capacity if <b>bags</b> <b>are</b> attached {{in such a way that}} they press against each other.|$|E
30|$|Methods: The {{contents}} of three existing <b>bags</b> <b>were</b> audited to assess uniformity. Users' perception {{and experience of}} the <b>bags</b> <b>were</b> audited. The results were poor. Following this, a standardised kit list and Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), compliant with ICS guidelines (3), were agreed by {{all members of the}} anaesthetic, theatre and ICU departments. New <b>bags</b> and protocols <b>were</b> introduced. Users' perception of the <b>bags</b> <b>was</b> then re-audited.|$|R
50|$|A rod {{connecting}} to the <b>bag</b> <b>is</b> {{powered by a}} motor. This provides motion to remove caked-on particles. The speed and motion of the shaking depends {{on the design of}} the bag and composition of the particulate matter. Generally shaking is horizontal. The top of the <b>bag</b> <b>is</b> closed and the bottom is open. When shaken, the dust collected {{on the inside of the}} <b>bag</b> <b>is</b> freed. During the cleaning process, no dirty gas flows through a bag while the <b>bag</b> <b>is</b> being cleaned. This redirection of air flow illustrates why baghouses must be compartmentalized.|$|R
25|$|A tea <b>bag</b> <b>is</b> a small, porous paper, silk or nylon sealed bag {{containing}} {{tea leaves}} for brewing tea. Tea <b>bags</b> <b>were</b> invented by Thomas Sullivan around 1903. The first tea <b>bags</b> <b>were</b> made from silk. Sullivan was a tea and coffee merchant in New York who began packaging tea samples in tiny silk bags, but many customers brewed the tea in them.|$|R
25|$|From the far past to the present, men, {{women and}} {{children}} all wear woven bags around their waist to carry personal objects. These <b>bags</b> <b>are</b> colored and otherwise decorated for aesthetic and to magically protect the wearer.|$|E
25|$|Whiz: In this variant, {{each player}} must bid {{the exact number}} of spades in their hand or go Nil. There is no minimum amount for teams to bid. Blind bidding is not allowed, however <b>bags</b> <b>are</b> counted as usual.|$|E
25|$|Overall, an {{estimated}} 400,000 passengers were affected {{because of the}} alerts. It {{has been estimated that}} the first day of delays cost the airlines over £175 million. As many as 20,000 <b>bags</b> <b>are</b> believed to have been misplaced at Heathrow.|$|E
40|$|Background: To {{offer an}} easily {{produced}} and cost-effective specimen retrieval <b>bag</b> that can <b>be</b> {{used to reduce}} the cost of laparoscopic surgery. Methods: From January 2005 to October 2009, 135 patients underwent laparoscopic surgery for adrenalectomy or prostatectomy, during which a homemade specimen retrieval <b>bag</b> <b>was</b> used. The retrieval <b>bag</b> <b>was</b> produced from a large sterile surgical glove, 2 - 0 nylon thread, and 1 - 0 RB- 1 needle Vicryl thread. A purse-string suture {{at the opening of the}} <b>bag</b> <b>was</b> made using the nylon thread, and the bottom of the <b>bag</b> <b>was</b> double-tied using the tail of the Vicryl thread. The <b>bag</b> <b>was</b> introduced into the peritoneal cavity via a 12 -mm port, and the specimen was enclosed with the use of two laparoscopic instruments. The <b>bag</b> <b>was</b> then extracted by extending the port incisional wound. Results: We used a homemade retrieval bag to extract specimens from 110 patients who underwent robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy and 25 patients who underwent laparoscopic adrenalectomy. The procedure was performed safely, and no <b>bags</b> <b>were</b> broken. No complications were observed after the operations such as wound infection, ileus, or intestinal adhesion. In our experience, our homemade endobag can be easily used by surgeons to extract specimens from the abdominal cavity. The total cost of hospitalization was also reduced for the patients. Conclusion: The homemade specimen retrieval <b>bag</b> <b>is</b> cost-effective and useful for the retrieval of intact specimens. It is also easy to make and safe to use...|$|R
25|$|Another {{accessory}} <b>was</b> a small <b>bag.</b> At home, <b>bags</b> <b>were</b> often white satin and embroidered or painted. Outdoor <b>bags</b> <b>were</b> often {{green or}} white and tasseled. There were also crocheted linen bags.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two basic}} designs of bags: open mouth bags and valve bags. An open mouth <b>bag</b> <b>is</b> a tube of paper plies with the bottom end sealed. The <b>bag</b> <b>is</b> filled though the open mouth and then closed by stitching, adhesive, or tape. Valve sacks have both ends closed and are filled through a valve. A typical example of a valve <b>bag</b> <b>is</b> the cement sack.|$|R
25|$|Many {{semiconductor}} devices used in electronics are particularly sensitive to static discharge. Conductive antistatic <b>bags</b> <b>are</b> {{commonly used to}} protect such components. People who work on circuits that contain these devices often ground themselves with a conductive antistatic strap.|$|E
25|$|Mirrors: Related to Whiz, {{each player}} must bid {{the number of}} spades in their hand. Players {{do not have the}} option to go Nil unless they have no Spades and must bid Nil if this is the case. <b>Bags</b> <b>are</b> counted as normal.|$|E
25|$|Initially, the commingled recyclates {{are removed}} from the {{collection}} vehicle and placed on a conveyor belt spread out in a single layer. Large pieces of corrugated fiberboard and plastic <b>bags</b> <b>are</b> removed by hand at this stage, as they can cause later machinery to jam.|$|E
30|$|The {{positions}} of {{the same type of}} <b>bags</b> <b>were</b> identical in a given trial. Thus, in Fig.  5, all <b>bags</b> <b>were</b> attached to the lower right side of a bigger circle. This position was varied trial by trial. The size of each item was about 1.2 °[*]×[*] 1.2 ° and the size of each <b>bag</b> <b>was</b> about 0.5 °[*]×[*] 0.5 ° at an approximately 60 -cm viewing distance.|$|R
50|$|One-piece bags: The {{adhesive}} and the <b>bag</b> <b>are</b> welded together. The {{advantage of}} using a one-piece appliance {{is that it is}} easy to apply, and the <b>bag</b> <b>is</b> flexible and soft.Two-piece bags: The bag and the adhesive are two separate components. The adhesive {{does not need to be}} removed frequently from the skin, and can remain in place for several days while the <b>bag</b> <b>is</b> changed as required.|$|R
5000|$|... (This latter formula {{assumes that}} the corners {{at the bottom of}} the <b>bag</b> <b>are</b> linked by a single edge, and that the base of the <b>bag</b> <b>is</b> not a more complex shape such as a lens).|$|R
25|$|Failure is {{not simply}} defined as when a part breaks, however; it is defined as when a part does not operate as intended. Some systems, such as the {{perforated}} top sections of some plastic <b>bags,</b> <b>are</b> designed to break. If these systems do not break, failure analysis might be employed to determine the cause.|$|E
25|$|Used {{to be sold}} in cooled 1 liter bags, {{just like}} in South Africa. Today {{the most common form}} is 1 liter aseptic cartons {{containing}} UHT skimmed, semi-skimmed or whole milk, although the plastic <b>bags</b> <b>are</b> still in use for pasteurized milk. Higher grades of pasteurized milk can be found in cartons or plastic bottles. Sizes other than 1 liter are rare.|$|E
25|$|Closed lift bags have an {{overpressure}} valve to prevent internal pressure from exceeding ambient pressure {{by more than}} a set amount (around 10kPa, or 1msw) Closed lift <b>bags</b> <b>are</b> intended for use at or near the surface, as they retain the air even in rough seas. They are available in several configurations, including horizontal cylinder, vertical cylinder, teardrop and pillow.|$|E

50|$|A {{cartridge}} <b>bag</b> of gunpowder <b>was</b> loaded first. A double <b>bag</b> <b>was</b> {{used with}} heated shot to prevent leakage of grains of gunpowder as the <b>bag</b> <b>was</b> rammed down the cannon. Once the <b>bag</b> <b>was</b> in place, {{a wad of}} moistened clay or cloth was rammed down against the bag to shield it from the heated shot, which was loaded next. If the cannon was to be fired at a downward angle, another wet wad was rammed down against the ball to secure it against rolling out.|$|R

Most UHT-milk is packed in 1 or 2 liter paper containers with a sealed plastic spout.|$|E
25|$|Drum <b>bags</b> <b>are</b> {{made from}} robust cloth such as cordura or from cloth-backed vinyl. They give minimal {{protection}} from bumps and impacts, {{but they do}} protect drums and cymbals from precipitation. They are adequate for drums transported in private vehicles to go to local gigs and sessions. They are often the only option for young drummers who are just starting out.|$|E
25|$|With {{the private}} sector growing slowly, {{designer}} leather products like <b>bags</b> <b>are</b> becoming a big export business, with Taytu becoming the first luxury designer label in the country.
