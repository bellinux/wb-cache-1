40|$|ABSTRACT. Fossil {{bivalves}} <b>bearing</b> oblique <b>ribs</b> ®rst {{appeared in}} the Mid Ordovician but their diversity remained low during the Palaeozoic. The diversity soon increased after the Early Triassic, peaking in the Early Cretaceous. The Palaeozoic±Mesozoic record is dominated by burrowing bivalves (mainly pholadomyoids and trigonioids), which developed oblique ribs with symmetric pro®les, probably adapted for shell reinforcement, although {{there are indications that}} the ribs of trigonioids also enhanced burrowing ef®ciency. After the Paleocene, the main groups of burrowing bivalves were veneroids (primarily tellinoideans and lucinoideans) and nuculoids, which generated oblique ribs of the shingled type, adapted to increase burrowing ef®ciency. The inferred change in function at the Mesozoic/ Cenozoic boundary can be correlated with an increase in mean mobility of the bivalve faunas <b>bearing</b> oblique <b>ribs</b> through time. This implies a major ecological cause for the observed temporal patterns, which forced bivalve faunas to burrow more rapidly and ef®ciently. In particular, either the Phanerozoic increase in the diversity of durophagous predators or the accelerating rate of sediment reworking (both being a consequence of the Mesozoic Marine Revolution), or both, could have provided the necessary evolutionary force...|$|R

60|$|In one {{skeleton}} of the Labrador duck {{there were the}} usual fifteen cervical vertebrae and the usual nine dorsal vertebrae bearing ribs; in the other skeleton there were fifteen cervical and ten dorsal vertebrae with ribs; nor, as far as could be judged, was this owing merely to a rib having been developed on the first lumbar vertebra; for in both skeletons the lumbar vertebrae agreed perfectly in number, shape, and size {{with those of the}} wild duck. In two skeletons of the Call duck there were fifteen cervical and nine dorsal vertebrae; in a third skeleton small ribs were attached to the so-called fifteenth cervical vertebra, making ten pairs of ribs; but these ten ribs do not correspond, or arise from the same vertebra, with the ten in the above-mentioned Labrador duck. In the Call duck, which had small ribs attached to the fifteenth cervical vertebra, the haemal spines of the thirteenth and fourteenth (cervical) and of the seventeenth (dorsal) vertebrae corresponded with the spines on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighteenth vertebrae of the wild duck: so that each of these vertebrae had acquired a structure proper to one posterior to it in position. In the eighth cervical vertebra of this same Call duck (figure 40, B), the two branches of the haemal spine stand much closer together than in the wild duck (A), and the descending haemal processes are much shortened. In the Penguin duck the neck from its thinness and erectness falsely appears (as ascertained by measurement) to be much elongated, but the cervical and dorsal vertebrae present no difference; the posterior dorsal vertebrae, however, are more completely anchylosed to the pelvis than in the wild duck. The Aylesbury duck has fifteen cervical and ten dorsal vertebrae furnished with ribs, but the same number of lumbar, sacral, and caudal vertebrae, as far as could be traced, as in the wild duck. The cervical vertebrae in this same duck (figure 40, D) were much broader and thicker relatively to their length than in the wild (C); so much so, that I have thought it worth while to give a sketch of the twelfth cervical vertebra in these two birds. From the foregoing statements we see that the fifteenth cervical vertebra occasionally becomes modified into a dorsal vertebra, and when this occurs all the adjoining vertebrae are modified. We also see that an additional dorsal vertebra <b>bearing</b> a <b>rib</b> is occasionally developed, the number of the cervical and lumbar vertebrae apparently remaining the same as usual.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the topic of}} local bond behaviour in RC structures. The mechanism of bond refers to the composite action between deformed steel reinforcing bars and the surrounding concrete. Bond behaviour is an open research topic with a wide scope, particularly because bond {{it is such a}} fundamental concept to structural engineers. However, despite many bond-related research findings having wide applications, the primary contribution of this research is an experimental evaluation of the prominent features of local bond behaviour and the associated implications for the seismic performance of RC structures. The findings presented in this thesis attempt to address some structural engineering recommendations made by the Canterbury Earthquakes Royal Commission following the 2010 - 2011 Canterbury (New Zealand) earthquake sequence. A chapter of this thesis discusses the structural behaviour of flexure-dominated RC wall structures with an insufficient quantity of longitudinal reinforcement, among other in situ conditions, that causes material damage to predominantly occur at a single crack plane. In this particular case, the extent of concrete damage and bond deterioration adjacent to the crack plane will influence the ductility capacity that is effectively provided by the reinforcing steel. As a consequence of these in situ conditions, some lightly reinforced wall buildings in Christchurch lost their structural integrity due to brittle fracture of the longitudinal reinforcement. With these concerning post-earthquake observations in mind, there is the underlying intention that this thesis presents experimental evidence of bond behaviour that allows structural engineers to re-assess their confidence levels for the ability of lightly reinforced concrete structures to achieve the life-safety seismic performance objective the ultimate limit state. Three chapters of this thesis are devoted to the experimental work that was conducted as the main contribution of this research. Critical details of the experimental design, bond testing method and test programme are reported. The bond stress-slip relationship was studied through 75 bond pull-out tests. In order to measure the maximum local bond strength, all bond tests were carried out on deformed reinforcing bars that did not yield as the embedded bond length was relatively short. Bond test results have been presented in two separate chapters in which 48 monotonic bond tests and 27 cyclic bond tests are presented. Permutations of the experiments include the loading rate, cyclic loading history, concrete strength (25 to 70 MPa), concrete age, cover thickness, bar diameter (16 and 20 mm), embedded length, and position of the embedded bond region within the specimen (close or far away to the free surface). The parametric study showed that the concrete strength significantly influences the maximum bond strength and that it is reasonable to normalise the bond stress by the square-root of the concrete compressive strength, √(f'c). The generalised monotonic bond behaviour is described within. An important outcome of the research is that the measured bond strength and stiffness was higher than stated by the bond stress-slip relationship in the fib Model Code 2010. To account for these observed differences, an alternative model is proposed for the local monotonic bond stress-slip relationship. Cyclic bond tests showed a significant proportion of the total bond degradation occurs after the loading cycle in the peak bond strength range, which is when bond slip has exceeded 0. 5 mm. Subsequent loading to constant slip values showed a linear relationship between the amount of bond strength degradation and the log of the number of cycles that were applied. To a greater extent, the cyclic bond deterioration depends on the bond slip range, regardless of whether the applied load cycling is half- or fully-reversed. The observed bond deterioration and hysteretic energy dissipated during cyclic loading was found to agree reasonably well between these cyclic tests with different loading protocols. The cyclic bond deterioration was also found to be reasonably consistent exponential damage models found in the literature. This research concluded that the deformed reinforcing bars used in NZ construction, embedded in moderate to high strength concrete, are able to develop high local bond stresses that are mobilised by a small amount of local bond slip. Although the relative rib geometry was not varied within this experimental programme, a general conclusion of this thesis is that deformed bars currently available in NZ have a relative <b>rib</b> <b>bearing</b> area that is comparatively higher than the test bars used in previous international research. From the parametric study {{it was found that the}} maximum monotonic bond strength is significant enhanced by dynamic loading rates. Experimental evidence of high bond strength and initial bond stiffness generally suggests that only a small amount of local bond slip that can occur when the deformed test bar was subjected to large tension forces. Minimal bond slip and bond damage limits the effective yielding length that is available for the reinforcing steel to distribute inelastic material strains. Consequently, the potential for brittle fracture of the reinforcement may be a more problematic and widespread issue than is apparent to structural engineers. This research has provided information that improve the reliability of engineering predictions (with respect to ductility capacity) of maximum crack widths and the extent of bond deterioration that might occur in RC structures during seismic actions...|$|R
