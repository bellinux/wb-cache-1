Eventually, Munson, worried that his wife will find where he has hidden the money, enlists Sawyer's help in moving the stash. Sawyer then reveals this {{information}} to the warden in exchange for a reduced sentence and a part of the money, which he puts in a bank account for Clementine Phillips, a <b>baby</b> <b>that</b> previous con victim Cassidy Phillips (Kim Dickens) has told him is his daughter. The warden sarcastically congratulates Sawyer on lying and cheating his way out of prison.|$|E
5|$|In A Dance with Dragons (2011), Tyrion {{travels to}} Pentos, where {{he finds himself}} under the {{protection}} of wealthy Magister Illyrio Mopatis. There he learns that Varys and Illyrio have secretly plotted to return the Targaryens to power since the murder of the Mad King Aerys II Targaryen. On Illyrio's advice, Tyrion decides to seek out and join Aerys' surviving daughter Daenerys at Meereen and help her reclaim the Iron Throne. He eventually realizes that two of his traveling companions are not what they seem. One is Jon Connington, disgraced former Hand of the King; the other claims to be Aegon VI Targaryen, Aerys' grandson, whom Varys had spirited away and replaced with another <b>baby</b> <b>that</b> was then killed during the Lannisters' sack of King's Landing. While in Volantis, Tyrion visits a brothel and is recognized and captured by Jorah Mormont who believes that delivering a Lannister to Daenerys will return Jorah to her good graces. Before they can reach Meereen, they are captured by the slavers currently besieging the city. When a plague strikes the slaver's siege camps, Tyrion engineers their escape by joining a mercenary company, the Second Sons. In exchange for membership, Tyrion promises the company the wealth of the Lannister ancestral seat of Casterly Rock, his birthright since Tywin is dead and Jaime has renounced it. Tyrion quickly realizes the slavers are on the losing side, and attempts to convince the Second Sons to change their allegiance.|$|E

25|$|Re-lactation is {{most easily}} {{accomplished}} with a newborn {{or with a}} <b>baby</b> <b>that</b> was previously breastfeeding; if the baby was initially bottle-fed, the baby may refuse to suckle. If the mother has recently stopped breastfeeding, she {{is more likely to}} be able to re-establish her milk supply, and more likely to have an adequate supply. Although some women successfully re-lactate after months-long interruptions, success is higher for shorter interruptions.|$|E
25|$|Childbirth in Ghana {{is often}} seen as a joyous {{occasion}} in Ghanaian society, as children represent wealth, status, and the continuation of a lineage. Pregnant women are often given special privileges and {{are considered to be}} beautiful, fragile, and vulnerable to evil spirits. Therefore, women may seek guidance from a religious or spiritual diviner to protect their fetus or to increase their chances of conceiving. For example, the Akan may carry akuaba dolls, a fertility symbol, during pregnancy to ensure that they will birth a healthy and beautiful <b>baby</b> <b>that</b> resembles the doll's exaggerated features.|$|E
50|$|The {{effects of}} nurture and touch {{were not only}} studied in rats, but also in newborn humans.

The same results that were shown in rats, also held true for humans. <b>Babies</b> <b>that</b> received less touch and nurture developed slower than <b>babies</b> <b>that</b> {{received a lot of}} attention and nurture. Stress levels were also lower in <b>babies</b> <b>that</b> were nurtured regularly and cognitive development was also higher due to increased touch. Human offspring, much like rat offspring, thrive off of nurture, as shown by the various studies of neuroscientists.|$|R

All on board escaped from the aircraft, with three people needing to be treated in hospital suffering from shock. A number of {{passengers were}} also treated at Lympne. Thirty-six of the passengers continued their journey to London, some with fuel-soaked clothing. The aircraft, with a replacement cost of £250,000, was written off. This was the first Avro 748/HS 748 to be written off in an accident. Skyways Coach-Air leased an Avro 748 from LIAT {{for two years in}} 1968 to replace the aircraft lost.|$|E
25|$|Altering the murderer's motives. In the novel, Lady Westholme murdered Mrs Boynton to {{keep her}} past secret. Before {{climbing}} the social ladder, she was incarcerated in the same prison where Mrs Boynton had been a warden. Knowing Mrs Boynton's sadistic personality, she silenced her {{to keep her}} reputation and her social status. In the adaptation, Dame Celia Westholme served as a maid {{in the home of}} Lady Boynton (who was then Mrs Pierce) before becoming a writer. She had an affair with Dr Gerard, delivered a child, and was sent away to a nunnery in Ireland while Lady Boynton kept the <b>baby.</b> <b>That</b> child turned out to be Jinny. When Dame Celia and Dr Gerard found out that Lady Boynton had abused all of the children that were in her care (including Jinny) even for a short while (like Mr Cope), they decided to kill her for revenge.|$|E
25|$|Paul seizes this {{opportunity}} to give his sister a baby in a storyline that becomes known as the baby switch. He drugs Babe, puts her in a helicopter, and stages a helicopter crash near a river in the forest. When Babe awakens, Paul tells her that the helicopter crashed and her baby is dead. She loses consciousness again. When Adam Chandler and JR arrive at the scene and threaten Paul, should anything bad have happened to their heir, Paul twists his story around and tells them that it was Bianca's <b>baby</b> <b>that</b> fell into the river and that Babe's child survived. JR's family is elated that Babe's baby is alive, but Bianca's family is devastated by the news. In Llanview, Paul gives Kelly Babe's son (later known as Adam Chandler III, then Little Adam, and currently AJ), telling her that the boy's mother was a poor homeless woman {{who did not want}} a baby.|$|E

25|$|The two {{return to}} Port Charles. Soon after, Sam finds out she's pregnant. She and Jason have a {{paternity}} test done, which establishes Jason as the father. However, Sam {{finds out that}} Franco is Jason's twin brother. Sam has another paternity test run, and is devastated when it says that Franco {{is the father of}} her baby. She tells Jason, {{and the two of them}} start to drift apart trying to deal this news. While they're separated, Sam gives birth to a baby boy during a rainstorm. Her son is switched at birth with Victor Lord III, who was stillborn, by Heather Webber (Robin Mattson) and Todd Manning (Roger Howarth). Jason finds them, and the two mourn when they believe that the baby died. It's revealed that Jason is the father of Sam's son because Heather switched the paternity test. Their son is given to Téa Delgado (Florencia Lozano), Victor's mother, who believes he's her son. Though Jason wants to make things right with Sam, she blames him for the death of her son. The two separate, and file for divorce. During the poisoning of the Port Charles water supply, Sam and Jason are admitted to the hospital in what seems to be the last hours of their life. Sam shares with Jason a dream she had where her son was still alive. Afterwards, Jason gets information that starts to make him suspect the <b>baby</b> <b>that</b> died wasn't Sam's.|$|E
25|$|Embryo {{transfer}} {{may be used}} where a {{woman who}} has eggs but no uterus and wants to have a biological baby; she would require the help of a gestational carrier or surrogate to carry the pregnancy. Also, {{a woman who has}} no eggs but a uterus may utilize egg donor IVF, in which case another woman would provide eggs for fertilization and the resulting embryos are placed into the uterus of the patient. Fertilization may be performed using the woman's partner's sperm or by using donor sperm. 'Spare' embryos which are created for another couple undergoing IVF treatment but which are then surplus to that couple's needs may also be transferred (called embryo donation). Embryos may be specifically created by using eggs and sperm from donors and these can then be transferred into the uterus of another woman. A surrogate may carry a baby produced by embryo transfer for another couple, even though neither she nor the 'commissioning' couple is biologically related to the child. Third party reproduction is controversial and regulated in many countries. Persons entering gestational surrogacy arrangements must make sense of an entirely new type of relationship that does not fit any of the traditional scripts we use to categorize relations as kinship, friendship, romantic partnership or market relations. Surrogates have the experience of carrying a <b>baby</b> <b>that</b> they conceptualize as not of their own kin, while intended mothers have the experience of waiting through nine months of pregnancy and transitioning to motherhood from outside of the pregnant body. This can lead to new conceptualizations of body and self.|$|E
25|$|Robin is {{devastated by}} her cousin Georgie's (Lindze Letherman) death in December 2007. After Georgie's funeral and Maxie's (Kirsten Storms) horrible {{outburst}} at Felicia (Kristina Wagner), she seeks comfort in Patrick's arms, because he truly knows her and sees {{her as she}} truly is, and tells him {{that it is not}} about getting back together, or a baby or even sex, but that she just wants him to hold her. Caught in a moment, they end up making love. That night, a condom breaks and Robin becomes pregnant, although she is unaware of this until weeks later. Dr. Kelly Lee tells Robin that the date of conception would have to be sometime around Christmas, which was around the time when Patrick and Robin had sex. Robin, worried that Patrick now has HIV, is about to tell him, but when she walks into the locker room she hears Dr. Julian tell Patrick that the HIV test he took (after he realizes that the condom had broken when he and Robin had sex) has come back negative. With the news that Patrick is not infected, Robin makes up her mind not to tell Patrick about the pregnancy just yet. Robin later blurts out to Patrick that she is pregnant, but leaves out {{the fact that he is}} the father. She tells him that she went to a sperm bank and that she does not know who her baby's father is. Although he thinks she is having a baby with someone else, Patrick cannot stay away from Robin or her child. After several occurrences, Patrick slowly realizes that he may in fact be the father of her baby. After they have a heart to heart, however, and Patrick asks about the paternity of the baby. Robin admits he is the father. But even though she is pregnant, Robin cannot let go of the fact that he never wanted children. Arguments and resentment builds from both sides- Patrick wanting to be a part of his child's life, Robin telling him it's her <b>baby</b> <b>that</b> he never wanted. Eventually, being confronted by her past—remembering how wrong she believed Carly was to keep baby Michael's paternity from AJ (Billy Warlock), or even her own mother keeping her away from her father the first 6 years of her life—Patrick and Robin forgave one another and started the movement up again in their own relationship. Over time, Patrick and Robin grow even closer and Patrick falls even more in love with Robin, and with the child he never wanted.|$|E

500|$|The Nevermind {{album cover}} shows a naked baby boy, alone {{underwater}} with a US dollar bill on a fishhook {{just out of}} his reach. According to Cobain, he conceived of the idea while watching a television program on water births with Grohl. Cobain mentioned it to Geffen's art director Robert Fisher. Fisher found some stock footage of underwater births but they were too graphic for the record company. Furthermore, the stock house that controlled the photo of a swimming <b>baby</b> <b>that</b> they subsequently settled on wanted $7,500 a year for its use.
