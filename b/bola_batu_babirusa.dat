50|$|The <b>Bola</b> <b>Batu</b> <b>babirusa</b> (Babyrousa bolabatuensis) is a {{proposed}} species of babirusa from the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. It was first described in 1950 as a subspecies of Babyrousa babyrussa, then the only recognized species of babirusa, and raised to species rank by Colin Groves and Erik Meijaard in 2002. At present the <b>Bola</b> <b>Batu</b> <b>babirusa</b> is only known for certain from subfossil remains {{from the southern}} arm of Sulawesi. Based on a single skull from central Sulawesi {{it has been suggested}} that babirusas from this part of Sulawesi represent an extant population of the <b>Bola</b> <b>Batu</b> <b>babirusa,</b> and this was followed in the third edition of Mammal Species of the World. However, the most recent major review also found similarities between the central Sulawesi specimen and the Togian babirusa, leading them to conclude that it represents an undescribed taxon and that the taxonomic position of central Sulawesi babirusas only can be determined through additional specimens. Subfossil remains from the south-western arm of Sulawesi, where now likely extinct, have been classified as Bola Batu babirusas, but these were considered unclassifiable in 2002, as were extant populations from the eastern arm of Sulawesi and Buton due to the lack of specimens. Due to these uncertainties, the IUCN Red List provisionally synonymized B. bolabatuensis under the northern Sulawesi species, B. celebensis, pending clarification of the taxonomy of Sulawesi babirusas.|$|E
40|$|Analysis {{of river}} water quality due to <b>Batu</b> <b>Bola</b> {{landfill}} pollution and characteristics with health of Batang Ayumi river users in Padangsidimpuan city. Batang Ayumi river which located in Batunadua village, district Batunadua, Padangsidimpuan city, has been polluted by <b>Batu</b> <b>Bola</b> landfills, {{according to government}} regulation No. 82 of 2001 concerning about the Management of Water Quality and Water Pollution Control. This study is a descriptive survey, which {{is to know about}} the physical pollution (TDS) and chemical pollution (BOD, COD and Phosphate) in Batang Ayumi river, taken from 10 points whitin 50 meters, and river users health problems were conducted in 2012. Object of this research is the river. <b>Batu</b> <b>Bola</b> landfills and mix between the outlet and river water are the comparison samples in the lab. The result of this research showed the contamination of TDS and BOD in all samples, but only a few samples indicated COD and Phosphate contamination from all the samples studied. The highest result is the landfill outlet, which is TDS 3140 mg/l, BOD 31, 63 mg/l, COD 87, 8 mg/l and Phosphate 0, 5 mg/l. The result of interview show that there is many people who suffer skin desease and eye desease. Local government is advised to give more attention to the <b>Batu</b> <b>Bola</b> landfills so that people are safer in using the river water for their daily needs, because many people are still dependent on Batang Ayumi river...|$|R
