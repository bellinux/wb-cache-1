Aims To determine the current status and long-term population trend of an isolated breeding population of Bearded Vultures Gypaetus barbatus (Corsica, Mediterranean). Methods The total Bearded Vulture population was monitored between 1981 and 2008. Results The current effective breeding {{population size}} of Bearded Vultures in Corsica is ten pairs/trios with a slight increase of one to two pairs since 1983. The population is currently estimated at 25 individuals. <b>Breeding</b> parameters (laying <b>rate,</b> <b>breeding</b> success and productivity) have decreased significantly over the full 28 -year study period, although the decrease was not significant when the data set was restricted to 1988 - 2008.

40|$|Persecution causes {{population}} declines {{only if it}} adds to {{the natural}} mortality and does not merely replace it. Large raptor species with slow <b>breeding</b> <b>rates</b> are less able to withstand heavy losses than are small species with fast <b>breeding</b> <b>rates.</b> Over the last 150 years, persecution has eliminated some of the bigger species from large parts of Europe and is still responsible for restricting the distribution of others. In Britain over this peri-od, the ranges of several species have contracted and expanded again with the rise and partial decline in game preservation, with temporary expansions during two wars wh, en gamekeepers were otherwise employed. Persecution is still restricting the breeding range of the Golden Eagle, the Buzzard, and the Hen Harrier in the British Isles to about half the potential. In some lists of bounty payments, certain species declined or disappeared in the re-cords during {{the operation of the}} scheme, suggesting that the killing itself reduced or exterminated them. But in other lists, no declines in numbers killed occurred over a long period, suggesting that hunters were merely cropping the population and causing no long-term decline. The importance of deliberate killing of raptors is shown by the large proportions of banded birds that were later recovered, and by the proportions of these recovered birds reported as shot. Recovery rates were as high (or higher) for some Eu-ropean raptors as for many game-bird and waterfowl populations exposed to regular hunting seasons. Widespread use of poison on meat baits has had the most damaging effects on European raptor populations, often where the procedure was aimed primarily against wolves or foxes.

50|$|Vector control measures, {{especially}} mosquito control, {{are essential}} to reducing the transmission of disease by arboviruses. Habitat control involves draining swamps and removal of other pools of stagnant water (such as old tires, large outdoor potted plants, empty cans, etc.) that often serve as breeding grounds for mosquitoes. Insecticides can be applied in rural and urban areas, inside houses and other buildings, or in outdoor environments. They are often quite effective for controlling arthropod populations, though use {{of some of these}} chemicals is controversial, and some organophosphates and organochlorides (such as DDT) have been banned in many countries.

Larvicides are also used worldwide in mosquito abatement programs. Temefos is a common mosquito larvicide.People can also reduce the risk of getting bitten by arthropods by employing personal protective measures such as sleeping under mosquito nets, wearing protective clothing, applying insect repellents such as permethrin and DEET to clothing and exposed skin, and (where possible) avoiding areas known to harbor high arthropod populations. Arboviral encephalitis can be prevented in two major ways: personal protective measures and public health measures to reduce the population of infected mosquitoes. Personal measures include reducing time outdoors particularly in early evening hours, wearing long pants and long sleeved shirts and applying mosquito repellent to exposed skin areas. Public health measures often require spraying of insecticides to kill juvenile (larvae) and adult mosquitoes.|$|E
5000|$|Martial eagles have a slow <b>breeding</b> <b>rate,</b> laying {{usually one}} egg (rarely two) every two years. Clutches of two {{have only been}} {{reported}} only in South Africa and once in Zambia and the younger sibling probably never survives or possibly ever even hatches unless the first egg or hatchling dies. Martial eagle eggs are rounded oval and are white to pale greenish-blue, variously. Sometimes they may be handsomely marked with brown and grey blotches. The eggs of martial eagles measure 79.9 x 63.4 mm on average among 57 eggs, with ranges of 72 to 87.5 mm in egg length by 60 to 69 mm in width. Their eggs are the largest of any booted eagle, slightly larger on average than those of golden or Verreaux's eagle and considerably larger than those of crowned eagles. The egg is incubated for 45 to 53 days. The female does a {{great majority of the}} incubation, as is typical, but the male may relieve her and incubate for a maximum of three hours in a day. If the nest is approached by humans, the female tends to sit tight, often only flying off once the nest is reached. Unlike the crowned eagle, the martial eagle is not known to protectively attack animals such as humans who come too close to the nest, usually just unobtrusively abandoning the nest until the person leaves the area, in a similar fashion to Aquila eagles. However, if maimed or grounded themselves, martial eagles are known to viscously turn on their human tormentors until they are finished off, in some anecdotal claims of early hunting journals, an occasion hunting accident have resulted in martial eagles tearing the flesh down to the bone on the legs of game wardens and even broken arms with their powerful grip. Although these accounts are quite possibly exaggerated, the ferocity of cornered martial eagles may have some influence on its name. Once the eggs hatch, the male of a pair may rarely brood the young but has never been seen to the feed the chick and, for the most part, the male just brings prey for the female to distribute between herself and the nestling. The female attendance at the nest drops considerably at seven weeks after hatching, at which point she resumes hunting. Then, the female may become main food provider but males will also make deliveries. Despite her lower attendance, she still roosts on or near the nest until the nestling stage is done. Despite the occasional capture of food, the male usually is rarely seen near the nest after the female resumes hunting. [...] In one unusual case, a first or second year plumaged male martial eagle was seen assisting an adult female in the way that an adult male would but it was not known if he had merely replaced a deceased male that had sired the young or had actually bred with the female, the following year the young male was verified to mate with the female. Cases of immature plumaged eagles breeding are often considered indicative of stress on a species’ regional population. The newly hatched chick tends to have a two-tone down pattern which is dark grey above and white below, which lightens at about four weeks of age, with the down becoming pale-grey. At 7 weeks, the feathers mostly cover the down and do so completely by 10 weeks except that at that stage the flight feathers are underdeveloped. The new chick is usually quite weak and feeble, becoming more active only after they are 20 days old. The nestlings usually first feeds itself at 9 to 11 weeks old, while it tends to engage in vigorous wing exercises performed from 10 weeks on. Like crowned eagles, males seem to be more active than female youngsters and probably fly sooner too. In one case, a male fledged prematurely at 75 days, however it is possible that male fledging can occur at less than 90 days. Most estimations place fledging as occurring at 96 to 109 days, on average at about 99 days of age. However, after making their first flight, the fledgling usually return to roost in the nest for several days, before gradually moving away from it. Despite increasing signs of independence (such as flight and beginning to practice hunting), in extreme cases, juvenile birds may remain in the care of their parents for a further 6 to 12 months. A typical post-fledgling care stage will continue for about 3 months after fledging. Despite its ability to fly, it will continue to beg for food from both parents as they are seen. Sometimes, the young eagle from the prior mating season may still be present {{at the onset of the}} next breeding season. Evidence exist of juvenile eagles returning to their nest site at as old as 3 years of age but are likely to be no longer fed. On the other hand, juvenile martial eagle soar much more readily than crowned eagles and, unlike that species, have been recorded traveling up to several miles from the nest 3 to 4 months after making their first flight. Due to this long dependence period, these eagles can usually only mate in alternate years.|$|E

Survival checks were aided by philopatric behaviour and a maximum annual tag failure rate of 7 %: minimum survival rates, that were estimated by assuming death of buzzards with lost tags, were close to maximum rates that were estimated using only the recorded deaths. First-year survival rate estimates for 35 buzzards fitted in 1990 - 1991 with 25 - 30 -g backpack radios were 69 - 74 % (minimum-maximum), close to the 61 - 71 % for 16 buzzards with 12 -g tail-mount radios; the backpacks transmitted for 2 - 4 yr.
