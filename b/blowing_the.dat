5|$|In northwestern Madagascar, Josie dropped heavy {{rainfall}} and caused widespread flooding. Several towns were isolated, forcing residents to travel by boat. The storm heavily damaged crops in the region, particularly to vanilla. The rains caused rivers to exceed their banks, resulting in flooding up to 3.6m (12ft) deep. Nationwide, at least 36people were killed due to Josie, {{although there were}} initial reports of 500people missing.

40|$|Thesis (M. Com. (Accountancy)) [...] University of the Witwatersrand, Faculty of Commerce, Law and Management, School of Accountancy, 2014. This thesis {{presents}} {{empirical evidence}} {{of the factors that}} motivate trainee auditors to <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> whistle on wrongdoing in an audit firm. It investigates whether organisational justice (comprised of procedural, interactional and distributive justice) is positively correlated with <b>the</b> willingness to <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> whistle. It also investigates whether the type of justice (procedural, interactional and distributive justice) affects <b>the</b> decision to <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> whistle. Finally, it investigates whether professional performance, morality-proxied by a sense of religion-, seniority, age and gender affect this decision to <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> whistle. The results indicate that most trainee auditors‟ sense of organisational justice is positively correlated to their likelihood to <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> whistle. All three justice dimensions (procedural, interactional and distributive justice) are found to increase trainee auditors‟ propensity to <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> whistle. High interactional justice is found to be a greater motivation to <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> whistle than procedural and distributive justice. Low distributive justice is found to be least effective as an impediment to whistleblowing, whilst low procedural and interactional justice are more effective than low distributive justice in deterring whistleblowing. This research finds that age, gender, seniority and religion do not affect the trainee auditor‟s propensity to <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> whistle. Most recent performance ratings do not affect trainee auditors‟ decision to <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> whistle, except in the case of trainees who received a low performance rating when there was low interactional justice...|$|R

5|$|As soon as {{they were}} ready, the charges were blown and Nuneaton started to tow Likomba out of the harbour. Aboard Duchessa d'Aosta, 11 men had managed to get aboard from Vulcan; while one group planted charges on the anchor chains, another searched below decks {{collecting}} prisoners. <b>Blowing</b> <b>the</b> anchor chains, Vulcan started to tow Duchessa d'Aosta out of the harbour. The explosions had alerted the population of the town, who started to gather on the pier, but no attempts were made to stop the ships from leaving. Several anti-aircraft emplacements opened fire at imaginary targets, believing the explosions to have been caused by an aerial attack, but the six-inch guns protecting the harbour itself remained silent. From entering the harbour to leaving with the ships under tow, the operation had taken 30 minutes, without any losses to the raiding party.|$|E
5|$|At 00:50, {{aircraft}} {{carrying the}} rest of the 6th Airborne Division appeared overhead and the paratroopers descended onto drop zones marked out by the pathfinders. Howard began <b>blowing</b> <b>the</b> morse code letter 'V' on his whistle, to help guide the 7th Parachute Battalion to the bridges. The first paratroops to arrive, at 00:52, were Brigadier Poett and the soldier he had picked up en route. Briefed by Howard on the situation, they heard tanks and lorries moving around in Bénouville and Le Port. On the drop zone, only about 100 men of the 7th Parachute Battalion had made it to the rallying point but all their signal equipment, machine guns and mortars were missing. Pine-Coffin, aware that his battalion was the only unit allocated defensive positions west of the bridges, decided they could not wait any longer and, at 01:10, left for the bridges.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{hurricane}} remained near the coastline, Hurricane David failed to cause extreme damage in Florida. The storm's winds shattered windows in stores near {{the coast and}} caused property damage, including <b>blowing</b> <b>the</b> frame of the Palm Beach Jai Alai fronton and downing the 186-foot (57-m) WJNO AM radio tower in West Palm Beach into the Intracoastal Waterway. A few roofs were torn off, and numerous buildings were flooded from over six inches (150 mm) of rainfall. A 450-foot (140-m) crane was even snapped in two at the St. Lucie Nuclear Power Plant. The hurricane spawned over 10 tornadoes while passing over the state, though none caused deaths or injuries. Total damages in Florida amounted to $95 million ($270 million in 2005 USD), of which $30 million occurred in Palm Beach County, mostly from crop damage. Two journalists with TODAY newspaper from Brevard County followed {{the hurricane}} path from South Florida to Cocoa, FL and experienced extremely high winds as they reported on the hurricane.|$|E

5|$|In agriculture, the {{increased}} usage of sheep with long-fibred wool allowed a stronger thread to be spun. In addition, the spinning wheel replaced the traditional distaff for spinning wool, tripling production. A less technological refinement that still greatly affected daily {{life was the}} use of buttons as closures for garments, which allowed for better fitting without having to lace clothing on the wearer. Windmills were refined with the creation of the tower mill, allowing {{the upper part of the}} windmill to be spun around to face the direction from which the wind was <b>blowing.</b> <b>The</b> blast furnace appeared around 1350 in Sweden, increasing the quantity of iron produced and improving its quality.

5|$|Initial aerial firing {{tests with}} the Vulcan cannon {{on the second}} {{aircraft}} were successful, but on 17 December, {{there was an explosion}} during a firing burst and the J65 engine suffered severe compressor stalls.

An investigation later showed that one of the 20mm cannon rounds had exploded in the breech, <b>blowing</b> <b>the</b> bolt out the rear of the gun and through the structure into the forward fuselage fuel cell. Jet fuel had run into the gun bay, and leaked out of the compartment door seals and into the left engine air intake. The engine immediately flooded with fuel, causing the compressor stalls.|$|E

(John Wetteland broke the record the next year by saving 24 straight). After keeping his ERA at 0.00 through {{the first two months}} of the season, he was selected to his seventh and final All-Star Game, thereby becoming only the fourth player to be an All-Star for four different teams (after Walker Cooper, George Kell and Goose Gossage). Smith did not fare well for the next month, pushing his ERA {{all the way up to}} 5.40. Regardless, the Angels held a double-digit lead in the division and seemed set for the postseason. Instead, California suffered one of the worst collapses in major league history, <b>blowing</b> <b>the</b> entire double-digit lead in less than six weeks. While the rest of the team was reeling, Smith reverted to his early-season form and pitched fantastically for the last two months, only blowing one save attempt in that span. He finished the season with 37 saves and a 3.47 ERA, which was more than a point higher than the league average.|$|E

5|$|The current {{building}} {{was constructed in}} the 12th century over {{the site of an}} earlier church. Severe damage was done to the church in 1400 during the rebellion of Owain Glyndŵr, during the English Civil War when it was overrun by Parliamentarian troops, and during the Great Storm of 1703. By 1717, the damage to the cathedral was so extensive that the church seriously considered removal of the see. Following further storms in the early 1720s, construction of a new cathedral began in 1734, designed by John Wood, the Elder. During the Cardiff Blitz of the Second World War in January 1941, the cathedral was severely damaged when a parachute mine was dropped; <b>blowing</b> <b>the</b> roof off the nave, south aisle and chapter house. The stonework which remains from the medieval period is primarily Somerset Dundry stone, though local blue lias constitutes most of the stonework done in the post-Reformation period. The work done on the church since World War II is primarily concrete and Pennant sandstone, and the roofs, of Welsh slate and lead, were added during the post-war rebuilding. In February 2007, the organ was damaged during a severe lightning strike, prompting a fundraiser of £1.5 million to raise money for an entirely new organ.|$|E
5|$|Six National Guardsmen arrive, led by Sergeant Winshiser (Aleks Paunovic), as does Colonel James Livingston-Graham (Ian D.

Sergeant Winshiser and his men arrogantly refuse to use the sheriff's advice and help. Graham tells the sheriff the soldiers will fail due to their arrogance {{and that he will}} start his hunt for the tiger when they finish. When the guardsmen search for the tiger, it kills one silently. Graham appears and explains how the tiger did it and helps them find the body. Later, Deputy Weinman and Deputy Ezra Hundt (Karl Thordarson), the mayor's son, find one of the National Guard trucks sitting empty on the road. They investigate and Weinman tells Hundt to call their position in to headquarters. She finds that the two guardsmen were attacked by the tiger, one being killed and the other shot by his partner. Hearing Hundt <b>blowing</b> <b>the</b> patrol car horn, she runs back to the car, but the Tiger has already killed him. Meanwhile, Roy encounters Graham in the woods and they discuss the tiger. When Roy asks if Graham is going to kill the Tiger, Graham tells him that he must because it can't chose not to hunt whatever is around it, including people. They shake hands and part ways with Graham continuing {{to the scene of the}} National Guard attack. When he arrives, he explains how the tiger attacked the guardsmen and deputy.|$|E
