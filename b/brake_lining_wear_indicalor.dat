40|$|The present master thesis {{focuses on}} the study of <b>brake</b> <b>lining</b> <b>wear</b> calculation. This <b>brake</b> system {{regulation}} function is worldwide only provided in passenger cars of the BMW Group. It calculates continually the wear of brake linings and displays to the driver the kilometre availability, as part of the Conditioned Based Service. The task assignment consists in the analysis and improvement of the current <b>brake</b> <b>lining</b> <b>wear</b> monitoring function that is used by BMW. First of all, the preliminary required task would be to understand and analyse the current status of the <b>brake</b> <b>lining</b> <b>wear</b> calculation. For that purpose, {{it will be necessary to}} build up a simulation environment, in which the calculation algorithm could be tested. The virtual calculation results can be compared with available experimental data from brake test bench and vehicle tests. Furthermore, in order to understand wear process, a study of all possible influence variables on the <b>brake</b> <b>lining</b> <b>wear</b> will be required. The conclusion of this analysis will serve to design an experimental planning to test brake linings. Then, a method has to be developed to find out possible empirical equations of wear that fit the characteristic diagram obtained on the brake test bench. Finally, the models obtained must be tested and validated with real test bench wear measurements...|$|R

40|$|Particulate matter emitted to the {{atmosphere}} due to motor vehicles arises from several sources in addition to tailpipe exhaust. In this study, the organic constituents present in fine particulate (d_p ≤ 2. 0 µm) road dust, <b>brake</b> <b>lining</b> <b>wear</b> particles, and tire tread debris (not size segregated) are analyzed using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The objective is to characterize such traffic-related sources on an organic compound basis and to search for molecular markers that will assist the identification of traffic-associated dusts in the urban atmosphere. More than 100 organic compounds are quantified in these samples, including n-alkanes, n-alkanoic acids, n-alkenoic acids, n-alkanals, n-alkanols, benzoic acids, benzaldehydes, polyalkylene glycol ethers, PAH, oxy-PAH, steranes, hopanes, natural resins and other compound classes. Paved road dust acts as a repository for vehicle-related particles, which can then be resuspended by the passing traffic. To evaluate the contributions from major urban sources to the road dust complex, source profiles representing different types of vehicle exhaust, brake dust, tire debris, and vegetative detritus are compared, and their fractional contributions are estimated using several groups of organic tracer compounds. Likewise, the close relationship between airborne fine particulate organic constituents and road dust organic matter is discussed...|$|R

The research was conducted in two phases, namely the field of testing and measuring brake wear in the lab. Metrology using a profile projector, in addition to the Rockwell hardness testing is also performed to determine the hardness of each brand of <b>brake</b> <b>lining</b> before and after testing higher speeds with the same braking load time, braking distance and the wear rate also increased.  From the research results smallest <b>brake</b> <b>lining</b> <b>wear</b> occurs there at a speed of 40 km / h and braking load 6 kg.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the effects of}} <b>brake</b> <b>lining</b> thickness due to wear on drum <b>brake</b> squeal. <b>Brake</b> <b>lining</b> will be <b>worn</b> out and subsequently its thickness will be reduced after a few number of braking applications. Hence dynamic properties of the lining, such as its natural frequency, might be changed. In this work, two different sets of <b>brake</b> <b>lining,</b> i. e., new and <b>worn</b> <b>lining</b> are used to investigate its effect on squeal generation. First, modal testing is performed to determine natural frequencies of those brake linings at free-free boundary condition. Later, squeal tests are carried out using brake dynamometer and squeal frequency is measured up to 10 kHz. Several squeal results are plotted over brake operating conditions to observe the influence of different lining thickness. In addition to these, squeal mechanisms, i. e., modal coupling due to closeness of the natural frequency between drum brake components and negative damping due to negative friction-velocity slope {{that contribute to the}} squeal generation are also investigated and discussed...|$|R
40|$|Paved road dust {{present on}} the surface of streets in Southern California {{consists}} of a complex mixture of soil dust, deposited motor vehicle exhaust particles, tire dust, <b>brake</b> <b>lining</b> <b>wear</b> dust, plant fragments, and other biological materials. The research presented here shows that allergens from at least 20 different source materials are found in the paved road dust. These include pollens and pollen fragments, animal dander, and molds. When paved road dust is resuspended into the atmosphere by passing vehicle traffic, allergen concentrations in the air are increased above the levels that would prevail without the vehicle traffic. Using immunological assays that measure the proteins extracted from environmental samples that bind to IgE antibodies present in the blood serum of allergenic patients, it is possible to measure the allergen concentrations present in paved road dust and in airborne particle samples. Total protein contributions to monthly average airborne TSP and PM_(10) concentrations are found to be in the range from 1 to 5. 8 μg m^(- 3), potentially accounting for a significant fraction of the airborne particulate organic material that has not been identified to date by GC/MS techniques. Results show that up to 5 − 12 % of the allergenicity of atmospheric total suspended particulate matter samples at Long Beach and Rubidoux, CA, is attributable to paved road dust emissions. In an industrial area of urban central Los Angeles where there is less proximity to vegetation and domestic activities, the paved road dust contribution to airborne allergen concentrations is lower, accounting for approximately 0. 5 % of the total allergenic activity of the atmospheric particle samples. In conclusion, paved road dust when entrained into the atmosphere by passing traffic is a source of allergen exposure for the general population and could be more important in areas with more abundant vegetation or with closer proximity of populations to major highways than is the case for the Southern California air monitoring sites studied here...|$|R
40|$|The {{sources of}} ambient organic {{particulate}} matter {{in urban areas}} are investigated through a program of emission source measurements, atmospheric measurements, and mathematical modeling of source/receptor relationships. A dilution sampler intended to collect fine organic aerosol from combustion sources {{is designed to simulate}} atmospheric cooling and dilution processes, so that organic vapors which condense under ambient conditions will be collected as particulate matter. This system is used to measure the emissions from a boiler burning distillate oil, a home fireplace, catalyst and noncatalyst automobiles, heavy-duty diesel trucks, natural gas home appliances, and meat cooking operations. Alternate techniques are used to sample the particulate matter emitted from cigarette smoking, a roofing tar pot, paved road dust, <b>brake</b> <b>lining</b> <b>wear,</b> tire wear, and vegetative detritus. The bulk chemical characteristics of the fine aerosol fraction are presented for each source. Over half of the fine aerosol mass emitted from automobiles, wood burning, meat cooking, home appliances, cigarettes, and tar pots is shown to consist of organic compounds. The organic material collected from these sources is analyzed using high-resolution gas chromatography. Using a simple analytical protocol, a quantitative, 50 -parameter characterization of the elutable fine organic aerosol emitted from each source type is obtained, which proves to be a unique fingerprint {{that can be used to}} distinguish most sources from each other. A mathematical model is used to predict the characteristics of fine ambient organic aerosol in the Los Angeles area that would prevail if the primary organic emissions are transported without chemical reaction. The model is found to track the seasonal variations observed in the ambient aerosol at the three sites studied. Emissions from vehicles and fireplaces are identified as significant sources of solvent-extractable organic aerosol. Differences between the model predictions and ambient concentrations that could be due to atmospheric chemical reaction are discussed. An upper limit on the amount of secondary organic aerosol present is estimated based on the difference between the acidic organic aerosol present in ambient samples versus that due to primary emissions as computed by the model. Finally, several hypotheses concerning the origin of the acidic organic aerosol are proposed...|$|R

The current spring steel alert system has some drawbacks where, the alerting sound is only activated while the car moves and secondly, when the car is on move, rarely the alerting sound reaches the driver. Therefore, a critical investigation of the existing pads manufactured in Malaysia and their characterizations are conducted to identify the most suitable sensor spot on the brake pad. Later, a micro sensor is embedded into the pad and fully tested on a specially designed test rig. The evaluation of thickness, hardness, layer properties and critical wear region has enabled the spotting of exact sensor location.

40|$|Braking of road {{vehicles}} {{can be characterized}} as an active – either wanted or unwanted reduction of the force necessary for maintaining the required speed, decreasing the speed, stopping or keeping the vehicle at a standstill. During braking the vehicle loses the acquired motion energy which is most frequently transformed (in case of wanted braking) in the brake system of the vehicle into useless heat released to the environment. Brake force can be defined as the force acting against the motion of a vehicle which is, in case of wanted braking, produced by the vehicle braking system. In case of wanted braking we usually begin with the equilibrium equation of vehicle forces.

50|$|In {{light of}} the above, it is {{reasonable}} to ask why rubber brake hose is used at all, instead of always using braided stainless steel hose. The most typical reason is cost, but also use case. Braided stainless steel hose is typically more expensive than rubber.
