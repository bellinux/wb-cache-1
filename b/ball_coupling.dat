40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a safety-clutch by using magnetorheological fluids (MRF) to switch the transmission torque between a motor and a generator in a bus-like vehicle. The clutch is based on a new design combining an axial MRF-actuator and a <b>ball</b> <b>coupling</b> mechanism. This so called "MRF-ball-clutch" avoids the disadvantages of traditional bell- or disc-MRF-clutch designs where the torque is transmitted by the MRF which leads to a self-heating due to the shearing forces in the fluid and a more or less significant drag torque caused by limitations of the relation between minimal and maximal transmittable torque. The safety clutch based on the new MRF-clutch design requires a minimum of power consumption and allows switching high torsional moments in a very compact, lightweight and robust design. The work was done within the Fraunhofer System Research for Electromobility FSEM, founded by the German Federal Ministry of Research and Technology...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study a linearized {{eigenvalue}} problem {{derived from a}} a free boundary problem modeling {{the growth of a}} tumor containing two species of cells: proliferating cells and quiescent cells. The reduced form of this eigenvalue problem is a 2 -system of a first-order nonlocal singular differential-integral equation in a <b>ball</b> <b>coupled</b> by a third-order elliptic pseudo-differential equation in the unit sphere. The singularity joined with non-localness of the first-order equation causes the main difficulty of this problem. By using Fourier expansion via a basis of spherical harmonic functions and some techniques for solving singular differential integral equations developed in some previous literature, we prove that there exists a null sequence {γ_k}_k= 2 ^∞ for the surface tension coefficient γ, with each of them being an eigenvalue of the linearized problem, i. e., if γ=γ_k for some k≥ 2 then the linearized problem has extra nontrivial solutions besides the standard nontrivial solutions, and if γ≠γ_k for all k≥ 2 then the linearized problem does not have other nontrivial solutions than the standard nontrivial solutions. Invertibility of some linear operators related to the linearized problem in suitable function spaces is also studied. Comment: 27 page...|$|R
50|$|Conceptually, {{sparsity}} {{corresponds to}} systems which are loosely coupled. Consider {{a line of}} balls connected by springs {{from one to the}} next: this is a sparse system as only adjacent <b>balls</b> are <b>coupled.</b> By contrast, if the same line of balls had springs connecting each ball to all other balls, the system would correspond to a dense matrix.

5000|$|After Vick's {{selection}} as an All-American, newspapers {{across the country}} published articles about his unusual practice schedule.

A substitute ran through the signals at practice each night, but Vick donned his uniform and played the center position on game days. Under the headline [...] "All-American Center Played Only Seven Hours in 1921," [...] The Bridgeport Telegram noted:"Allowing that there were seven conference games on Michigan's grid schedule in the fall, it can safely be said that 'Ernie' did not play more than that number of hours during the entire season."Press accounts praised Vick for [...] "his absolute dependability in passing the <b>ball,</b> <b>coupled</b> with his almost superhuman defensive play."

40|$|A {{laser diode}} {{transmitter}} packaged in a butterfly module is coupled {{into a single}} mode fiber using double small ball lenses. The process of alignment and fixing of all the components inside the module is performed in an active alignment procedure, where the laser diode is powered and the output power is continuously measured during the alignment process of all coupling components to determine the optimum positions for maximum coupling efficiency and then fixed in their holders and to the main substrate by laser welding technique using dual beam Nd:YAG laser welding. The double <b>ball</b> lenses <b>coupling</b> scheme found to be very effective in mode matching between laser diode and single mode fiber. The axial, lateral and angular 1 dB misalignment tolerances are enhanced for the transformed laser mode field radii in both X and Y directions. The experimentally measured coupling efficiency of the proposed coupling system was around 75 % with a relaxed working distance (separation of the coupling system from the fiber tip) {{in the range of}} (2 - 4 mm) by optimizing the separation between the two lenses as well as the separation between the first lens and the facet of the laser diode.

40|$|Marked-ball {{grinding}} {{tests were}} carried out under different grinding conditions and environments. Three types of balls were used, namely, cast hyper steel, high chrome cast iron and EN- 31 (forged), which cover {{a wide range of}} chemical composition, microstructure and media hardness. The effect of pulp density on ball wear and grinding efficiency was also studied. Relative pulp viscosities at different percent solids for the ore slurry were also determined. As the Kudremukh ore contained about 0. 2 % pyrite, the effect of addition of pyrite on ball wear was studied separately. Results of marked-ball grinding tests indicated that ball wear increased with time and showed a sharp increase for wet grinding over dry grinding. Ball wear under wet grinding conditions was also influenced by the gaseous atmosphere in the mill. At 70 % solids, the best results in terms of reduced <b>ball</b> wear <b>coupled</b> with satisfactory grinding efficiency were obtained. The influence of oxygen on the corrosive wear of grinding balls was increasingly felt only if sulphide minerals such as pyrite were also present in the ore. The various ball materials could be arranged in the following order with respect to their overall wear resistance: high chrome cast iron > EN- 31 (forged) > cast hyper steel. Possible ball wear mechanisms involved in the grinding of Kudremukh ore are discussed...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the development of}} task-specific couplings among functional subsystems (i. e., ball circulation, respiration, and body sway) when learning to juggle a three-ball cascade, {{with a focus on}} learning-induced changes in the <b>coupling</b> between <b>ball</b> movements and respiration and the <b>coupling</b> between <b>ball</b> movements and body sway. Six novices practiced to juggle three balls in cascade fashion for one hour per day for twenty days. On specific days (7 in total), ball movements, center-of-pressure (CoP) trajectories and respiration traces were measured simultaneously. Discrete, time-continuous and spectral analyses revealed that the spatio-temporal variability of the juggling patterns decreased with practice and that {{the degree to which the}} task constraints were satisfied increased gradually. No conclusive evidence was found for <b>ball</b> movement-respiration <b>coupling.</b> In contrast, clear-cut evidence was found for the presence of 1 : 3 and 2 : 3 frequency locking between the vertical component of the ball trajectories and both the anterior-posterior and the medio-lateral components of the CoP. Incidence and expression of these mode locks varied across individuals and altered in the course of learning. Gradual changes in locking strength, appearances and disappearances of mode locks, as well as abrupt transitions between coupled states were observed. These results indicate that dissimilar learning dynamics may arise in the functional embedding of subsystems into a task-specific organization and that motor equivalence is an inherent property of such emerging task-specific organizations...|$|R
40|$|The rugby union {{line-out}} {{is a key}} {{aspect of}} game play and involves players from both teams contesting for the ball {{after it has been}} thrown in from the side line. Successful lines-out throws require the ball to be delivered accurately to the hands of a jumping and/or lifted team mate (approximately 3 - 3. 5 m off the ground) over distances of between 5 - 18 m. Previous research has suggested considerable inter and intra-individual differences in the throwing techniques of international level players. Accordingly, this project investigated the interrelationships between accuracy and the line-out throwing characteristics of three elite international rugby players, and then analyzed whether these changed for throws over increasing length. Three-dimensional (3 D) data were developed from video footage (50 Hz) of three elite international subjects for 30 throws over three distances (6 m, 10 m, and 15 m). Results showed notable differences between subjects in many variables at each of the key throw phases. However, several variables such as the degree of trunk flexion {{at the end of the}} backswing and at <b>ball</b> release, <b>coupled</b> with elbow flexion angle at ball release remained constant as throw length increased.
