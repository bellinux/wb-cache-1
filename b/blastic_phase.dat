40|$|Objective 　To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} indomethacin on cell cycle and apoptosis of CD 34 + cells in <b>blastic</b> <b>phase</b> chronic myeloid leukemia, and explore the role of Wnt/β-catenin signal pathway in the molecular mechanism. Methods 　CD 34 + cells were sorted from bone marrow samples of <b>blastic</b> <b>phase</b> chronic myeloid leukemia, chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia and normal cord blood by immune magnetic bead separation. The purity of CD 34 + cells was detected by flow cytometry, and cellular morphology was observed by Wright's staining. The protein expression and location of β-catenin and BCR/ABL in CD 34 + cells were analyzed by immunofluorescence assay. The changes of β-catenin protein expression in CD 34 + cells treated with indomethacin and imatinib were detected by immunofluorescence, the cell apoptosis and cell cycle were observed by Wright's staining and flow cytometry, the mRNA level of c-myc and cyclin D 1 was detected by real-time PCR, and the protein expression of BCR/ABL was detected by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence assay. Results 　CD 34 + cells were successfully acquired with purity over 90 %. β-catenin and BCR/ABL highly expressed in those CD 34 + cells isolated from <b>blastic</b> <b>phase</b> chronic myeloid leukemia and mainly located in cytoplasm. Indomethacin combined with imatinib significantly suppressed the expression of β-catenin, increased the apoptotic rate and arrested the cell cycle in G 0 /G 1 phase of <b>blastic</b> <b>phase</b> CD 34 + cells (P< 0. 05), decreased the mRNA level of c-myc and cyclin D 1 and the expression of BCR/ABL in <b>blastic</b> <b>phase</b> CD 34 + cells (P< 0. 05), but threw no significant effect on normal CD 34 + cells. Conclusions 　Indomethacin may significantly arrest the cell cycle and increase the apoptosis rate of CD 34 + cells isolated from <b>blastic</b> <b>phase</b> chronic myeloid leukemia. It enhances the sensitivity of leukemia CD 34 + cells to imatinib by inhibiting β-catenin expression, suppressing the transcription of c-myc and cyclin D 1 and decreasing the expression of BCR/ABL protein.

40|$|Developing {{strategies}} to counteract ima-tinib resistance constitutes {{a challenge in}} chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Therapy with the tyrosine kinase inhibitors nilotinib (AMN 107) and dasatinib (BMS- 354825) has produced high rates of hemato-logic and cytogenetic response. Src kinase activation {{has been linked to}} Bcr-Abl–medi-ated leukemogenesis and CML progres-sion. In addition to binding Abl kinase with less stringent conformational requirements than imatinib, dasatinib is a potent Src ki-nase inhibitor. In the current study, we re-port on 23 patients with CML (19 of them in accelerated or <b>blastic</b> <b>phases)</b> treated with dasatinib after treatment failure with both imatinib and nilotinib. More than half (13; 57 %) of 23 patients responded to dasatinib: 10 (43 %) had a complete hematologic re-sponse (CHR), including 7 (30 %) who had a cytogenetic response (2 complete, 4 partial, and 1 minor).

40|$|Background: Resistance {{developed}} by leukemic cells, unsatisfactory efficacy on {{patients with chronic}} myeloid leukemia (CML) at accelerated and <b>blastic</b> <b>phases,</b> and potential cardiotoxity, have been limitations for imatinib mesylate (IM) in treating CML. Whether low dose IM in combination with agents of distinct but related mechanisms {{could be one of}} the strategies to overcome these concerns warrants careful investigation. Methods and Findings: We tested the therapeutic efficacies as well as adverse effects of low dose IM in combination with proteasome inhibitor, Bortezomib (BOR) or proteasome inhibitor I (PSI), in two CML murine models, and investigated possible mechanisms of action on CML cells. Our results demonstrated that low dose IM in combination with BOR exerted satisfactory efficacy in prolongation of life span and inhibition of tumor growth in mice, and did not cause cardiotoxicity or body weight loss. Consistently, BOR and PSI enhanced IM-induced inhibition of long-term clonogenic activity and shortterm cell growth of CML stem/progenitor cells, and potentiated IM-caused inhibition of proliferation and induction of apoptosis of BCR-ABL+ cells. IM/BOR and IM/PSI inhibited Bcl- 2, increased cytoplasmic cytochrome C, and activate...|$|R

40|$|Imatinib was {{successfully}} introduced into haematology-oncology practice in 2001 and rapidly endorsed {{as a first}} line treatment for chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) in the chronic, accelerated, and <b>blastic</b> <b>phases.</b> The survival advantage demonstrated by this target kinase inhibitor has meant that patients are now treated with this agent on a long-term basis. There is a growing literature on the potential toxic effects of chronic imatinib use (Fruttiger et al., 1999; Grove et al., 2004). A safety sub-study undertaken by the Australasian Leukaemia and Lymphoma Group (ALLG) identified a range of subtle effects consistent with the inhibition of targeted kinases in the immunological, respiratory, endocrine, and reproductive systems (Seymour et al., 2004). To date, {{there has been no}} attempt to elucidate possible neuropsychological sequelae of chronic imatinib use. However concerns exist about the potential neurotoxic effects of this agent, given that the inhibition of protein kinase in animal studies has been associated with a range of deleterious consequences, such as impaired learning and memory, and reduced synaptic efficacy (Grove et al., 2004; Moresco et al., 2003) ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Chronic {{myelogenous leukemia}} (CML) {{is thought to}} start with the {{acquisition}} of the t(9; 22) chromosomal translocation that codes for the P 2 lObcrabl tyrosine-specific protein kinase. The CML cells exhibit anchorage-independent cell growth and genetic instability. After the initial phase, the cells acquire the phenotype of growth factor-independent growth. After the chronic phase, the disease evolves into the accelerated and <b>blastic</b> <b>phases</b> through the process of sequential random mutation. Materials and Methods: To identify some of the genetic changes that contribute to the phenotype of <b>blastic</b> and accelerated <b>phase</b> cells, we used differential display PCR to compare levels of cDNA reverse transcripts of mRNA in 32 Dc 13 cells and 32 Dc 13 cells that were stably transfected with a bcrabl cDNA plasmid in a constitutively expressed transcription unit. These cells were designated 32 Dc 13 P 210 bcrabl. For these studies, we used the 32 D myeloid leukemia cell line, which depends on IL- 3 for growth. Results: Following introduction of the bcr-abl cDNA through transfection, the cell line became growth factor independent, mimicking the change in phenotype that occurs during the later phases of CML. These differential display screening assays detected altered levels of transcripts for 28 genes. Of interest to the biology of growth factor-independent growth in the bcrabl-positive 32 D cells {{was the fact that the}} C 10 c 3 chemokine gene was expressed at higher levels in the 32 Dc 1 3 cells than in the 32 Dc 1 3 P 2 lObcrabl cells.

40|$|Abstract. Chronic {{myeloid leukemia}} (CML) is a hematopoi-etic stem cell disease {{caused by the}} oncoprotein BCR-ABL, which {{exhibits}} a constitutive tyrosine kinase activity. Imatinib mesylate (IM), an inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase activity of BCR-ABL, {{has been used as}} a first-line therapy for CML. However, IM is less effective in the accelerated <b>phase</b> and <b>blastic</b> <b>phases</b> of CML and certain patients develop IM resistance due to the mutation and amplification of the BCR-ABL gene. Fangchinoline, an important chemical constituent from the dried roots of Stephaniae tetrandrae S. Moore, exhibits significant antitumor activity in various types of cancers, including breast, prostate and hepatocel-lular carcinoma. However, the effects and the underlying mechanisms of fangchinoline in CML remain unclear. In the present study, we identified that fangchinoline inhibits cell proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner in K 562 cells derived from the blast crisis of CML. Additional experi-ments revealed that fangchinoline induces cell cycle arrest at the G 0 /G 1 phase and has no effect on apoptosis, which is mediated through the upregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) -N 1 A and MCL- 1 mRNA levels, as well as the downregulation of cyclin D 2 (CCND 2) mRNA levels. These findings suggest the potential of fangchinoline as an effective antitumor agent in CML...|$|R

40|$|Two male {{patients}} with Philadelphia-chromosome (Ph+) chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) underwent allogeneic {{bone marrow transplantation}} (ABMT) in the first chronic phase after busulfan treatment. In both cases, the donor was a sister, and engrafting was demonstrated by chromosome analyses which showed only donor cells in the BM. Cytogenetic relapse occurred 29 and 30 months after ABMT, respectively, when host cells reappeared: in both cases, the Ph and additional anomalies typical of the <b>blastic</b> <b>phase</b> of CML were evident. We then monitored the chromosome picture for 52 and 39 months, respectively: no striking evolution occurred, and cells with the Ph and additional anomalies persisted together with donor cells, which were a minority in the first patient and a great majority in the second throughout the observation period. A clinical relapse was observed in the first patient, but the disease never progressed to a <b>blastic</b> <b>phase,</b> whereas the second patient has not relapsed 7 years after ABMT. We reviewed data from the literature on cytogenetic relapse after ABMT in CML without clinical relapse, especially the 12 patients in whom cytogenetic relapse included chromosome anomalies {{in addition to the}} Ph, as in our patients. We suggest that graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) reactions in such patients are able to arrest progression of the leukemic blastic clone and prevent a possible relapse in <b>blastic</b> <b>phase...</b>|$|E

30|$|As suspected, MRI {{features}} {{vary depending}} on the stage of the disease. Initially, during bone resorption, high signal intensity can be seen on T 2 -weighted images, as well as strong enhancement. In this stage, on T 1 -weighted MR images, the marrow has decreased signal intensity, generally similar to that of muscle; however, it typically contains small to extensive foci of intermixed, normal and maintained yellow marrow. This feature is important because it excludes malignant transformation. In the mixed phase, the yellow marrow signal is maintained in all pulse sequences. In the late <b>blastic</b> inactive <b>phase,</b> the marrow space has low signal intensity on both T 1 - and T 2 -weighted images representing sclerosis [2, 5, 6, 23, 24].|$|R
40|$|Advances {{in chronic}} myeloid leukemia treatment, {{particularly}} regarding tyrosine kinase inhibitors, mandate regular updating of concepts and management. A European LeukemiaNet expert panel reviewed prior and new studies to update recommendations made in 2009. We recommend as initial treatment imatinib, nilotinib, or dasatinib. Response is assessed with standardized real quantitative {{polymerase chain reaction}} and/or cytogenetics at 3, 6, and 12 months. BCR-ABL 1 transcript levels ≤ 10 % at 3 months, 10 % at 6 months and > 1 % from 12 months onward define failure, mandating a change in treatment. Similarly, partial cytogenetic response (PCyR) at 3 months and complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) from 6 months onward define optimal response, whereas no CyR (Philadelphia chromosome-positive [Ph+] > 95 %) at 3 months, less than PCyR at 6 months, and less than CCyR from 12 months onward define failure. Between optimal and failure, there is an intermediate warning zone requiring more frequent monitoring. Similar definitions are provided for response to second-line therapy. Specific recommendations are made for patients in the accelerated and <b>blastic</b> <b>phases,</b> and for allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Optimal responders should continue therapy indefinitely, with careful surveillance, or they can be enrolled in controlled studies of treatment discontinuation once a deeper molecular response is achieved.

40|$|Meningeal {{infiltration}} is {{the most}} common neurological complication in acute leukemias. In acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), its incidence has reached 50 % to 70 % before the use of CNS-prophylaxis. Even after CNS-prophylaxis meningeal leukemia is observed in 5 % to 10 % of patients with ALL. In AML, where CNS-prophylaxis is not a standard procedure, and during the <b>blastic</b> <b>phase</b> of chronic myelogenic leukemias (CML), meningeal infiltration is more frequent. On the contrary, symptomatic epidural metastases are very rare in patients with leukemia. Leukemias are not specifically mentioned in large series reporting primary sites of epidural space metastases. Moreover, to our knowledge, this complication has not been found in systematic clinical surveys of patients with acute leukemia. Rare cases of spinal cord compression by epidural proliferation of leukemia cells during the <b>blastic</b> <b>phase</b> of CML are found in the literature. Chloromas are another very large cause of spinal compression in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia. In the described patient, leukemic blasts were found only in the epidural space even after an elaborate pathological examination. Because we were not aware that the epidural space could be the only site for AML recurrence, the efforts to establish the diagnosis were insufficient when early and transitory neurological signs appeared and therefore the subsequent treatment, which started with laminectomy, was delayed.

40|$|Clinical {{management}} {{guidelines on}} malignant disorders are generally {{based on data}} from clinical trials with selected patient cohorts. In Sweden, more than 95 % of all patients diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) are reported to the national CML registry, providing unique possibilities to compile population-based information. This report is based on registry data from 2002 to 2010, when a total of 779 patients (425 men, 354 women; median age, 60 years) were diagnosed with CML (93 % chronic, 5 % accelerated, and 2 % <b>blastic</b> <b>phase)</b> corresponding to an annual incidence of 0. 9 / 100 000. In 2002, approximately half of the patients received a tyrosine kinase inhibitor as initial therapy, a proportion that increased to 94 % for younger (80 years) patients during 2007 - 2009. With a median follow-up of 61 months, the relative survival at 5 years was close to 1. 0 for patients younger than 60 years and 0. 9 for those aged 60 to 80 years, but only 0. 6 for those older than 80 years.

Histamine content and release of histamine from basophils upon addition of anti-IgE were also measured. Mature basophils, corresponding to types I and II in the basophilogram, had a spherical shape, while immature cells, corresponding to types III and IV, were pearshaped. Type I, II, III and IV basophils differed {{in the number of}} microvilli, more mature basophils having more microvilli than immature basophils. The mean number of bound immunolatex particles, which indicate IgE receptors, was 19. 3 ± 14. 0 /basophil in healthy subjects, 42. 4 ± 30. 9 in bronchial asthmatic, and 3. 7 ± 6. 6 in CML patients.

40|$|Abnormal Hedgehog {{signaling}} {{is associated}} with human malignancies. Smo, a key player of that signaling, is the most suitable target to inhibit this pathway. To this aim several molecules, antagonists of Smo, have been synthesized, {{and some of them}} have started the phase I in clinical trials. Our hospital participated to one of these studies which investigated the oral administration of a new selective inhibitor of Smo (SMOi). To evaluate ex vivo SMOi efficacy and to identify new potential clinical biomarkers of responsiveness, we separated bone marrow CD 34 + cells from 5 acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 1 myelofibrosis (MF), 2 <b>blastic</b> <b>phases</b> chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients treated with SMOi by immunomagnetic separation, and we analysed their gene expression profile using Affimetrix HG-U 133 Plus 2. 0 platform. This analysis, showed differential expression after 28 days start of therapy (p-value ≤ 0. 05) of 1, 197 genes in CML patients and 589 genes in AML patients. This differential expression is related to Hedgehog pathway with a p-value = 0. 003 in CML patients and with a p-value = 0. 0002 in AML patients, suggesting that SMOi targets specifically this pathway. Among the genes differentially expressed we observed strong up-regulation of Gas 1 and Kif 27 genes, which may work as biomarkers of responsiveness of SMOi treatment in CML CD 34 + cells whereas Hedgehog target genes (such as Smo, Gli 1, Gli 2, Gli 3), Bcl 2 and Abca 2 were down-regulated, in both AML and CML CD 34 + cells. It has been reported that Bcl- 2 expression could be correlated with cancer therapy resistance and that Hedgehog signaling modulate ATP-binding (ABC) cassette transporters, whose expression has been correlated with chemoresistance. Moreover we confirmed that in vitro SMOi treatment targets Hedgehog pathway, down-regulate ABC transporters, Abcg 2 and Abcb 1 genes, and in combination with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) could revert the chemoresistance mechanism in K 562 TKIs-resistant cell line. ...|$|R
40|$|Imatinib mesylate (STI 571) {{is one of}} the {{fundamental}} chemotherapeutic agents used in the treatment of the chronic, accelerated and <b>blastic</b> <b>phases</b> of chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML), gastrointestinal stromal tumors and Philadelphia chromosome–positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. It selectively inhibits receptor tyrosine kinases. Its effects limit the use of this drug. We present a case with a serious skin reaction requiring the discontinuation of the drug and that developed in relation to imatinib therapy. Six months prior, a 61 -year-old male patient presenting to the hematology polyclinic with complaints of weight loss and sweating was hospitalized due to high leukocyte value. As a result of the hemogram, biochemistry analyses, peripheral blood smear examination, bone marrow aspiration evaluation, cytogenetic examination using FISH and PCR that were performed, CML was diagnosed. Additionally, to exclude myelofibrosis, we examined a bone marrow biopsy. Imatinib mesylate was started at 400 mg/day orally. In the fourth month of treatment, the patient complained of itching and a skin rash. Although the drug dose was reduced (300 mg/day), his complaints gradually increased. The skin biopsy result was superficial perivascular dermatitis. Imatinib was discontinued, and the patient was started on corticosteroid. The lesions disappeared completely. A month later, the patient was restarted on imatinib mesylate. However, the lesions recurred more prominently. His itching increased. The patient was considered intolerant to imatinib mesylate, and a second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor, dasatinib 100 mg/day, was started orally. The follow-up and treatment continues for the patient, who has been taking dasatinib 100 mg/day for the last two months without any skin finding or complaints. Imatinib mesylate–induced skin reactions are associated with the pharmacologic effect of the drug rather than hypersensitivity to the drug. Skin reactions are frequently observed, and this side effect is dose dependent. However, the interesting aspect of our case was that despite dose reduction, skin findings gradually increased, and eventually the drug had to be discontinued...|$|R

Screening of a cDNA library of the t(3; 21) -carrying leukemic cell line cells (SKH 1) resulted in the isolation of two potentially complete AML 1 -EVI- 1 chimeric cDNAs of 6 kb. Two species of AML 1 -EVI- 1 fusion transcripts of 8. 2 and 7. 0 kb were detected in SKH 1 cells. These cells expressed the 180 kDa AML 1 -EVI- 1 fusion protein containing an N-terminal half of AML 1 including a runt homology domain which is fused to the entire zinc finger EVI- 1 protein. The AML 1 -EVI- 1 fusion transcript was consistent in all three cases of the t(3; 21) -carrying leukemia examined by RNA-based PCR.

T(3; 12) (q 26;p 13), which is a recurrent chromosomal aberration observed in myeloid malignancies, is typically associated with dysplasia of megakaryocytes, multilineage involvement, short duration of any <b>blastic</b> <b>phase,</b> and extremely poor prognosis. We have identified a recurrent reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 3 and 12 with different breakpoint at bands 3 q 21 in the malignant cells from a 28 -year-old man.

As structural changes, partial excess of chromosome 1, isochromosome 17 q, isochromosome 1 q, tdic (20 p+; 21 q-), del (7) (q 11), t(2 p+; 11 p-), # 12 q+ and Xp+ were observed. Chromosomal analysis alone is not the best marker to diagnose the onset of blastic phase; however, it is a useful parameter when considered in combination with clinical and hematological results. </p...|$|E

It potently inhibits BCR/ABL and SRC-family kinases (SRC, LCK, HCK, YES, FYN, FGR, BLK, LYN, FRK), as well as c-KIT, PDGFR-a and -b, and ephrin receptor kinase. Various clinical trials have provided evidence that it has more durable complete hematologic and cytogenetic responses, {{as well as more}} potency in imatinib-resistant or -intolerant CML, and it has also shown its advantages in newly diagnosed CML compared to imatinib. In this review, we mainly focus on the structure, mechanisms, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacogenetics of dasatinib. We also summarize clinical trials with dasatinib on CML and provide our recommendations for dasatinib in the treatment of CML.

40|$|Abstract Background The Matchpoint trial aims to {{identify}} the optimal dose of ponatinib to give with conventional chemotherapy consisting of fludarabine, cytarabine and idarubicin to chronic myeloid leukaemia patients in <b>blastic</b> transformation <b>phase.</b> The dose should be both tolerable and efficacious. This paper describes our experience implementing EffTox in the Matchpoint trial. Methods EffTox is a Bayesian adaptive dose-finding trial design that jointly scrutinises binary efficacy and toxicity outcomes. We describe a nomenclature for succinctly describing outcomes in phase I/II dose-finding trials. We use dose-transition pathways, where doses are calculated for each feasible set of outcomes in future cohorts. We introduce the phenomenon of dose ambivalence, where EffTox can recommend different doses after observing the same outcomes. We also describe our experiences with outcome ambiguity, where the categorical evaluation of some primary outcomes is temporarily delayed. Results We arrived at an EffTox parameterisation that is simulated to perform well over a range of scenarios. In scenarios where dose ambivalence manifested, we were guided by the dose-transition pathways. This technique facilitates planning, and also helped us overcome short-term outcome ambiguity. Conclusions EffTox is an efficient and powerful design, but not without its challenges. Joint phase I/II clinical trial designs will likely become increasingly important in coming years as we further investigate non-cytotoxic treatments and streamline the drug approval process.

40|$|Abstract Background To {{retrospectively}} {{review the}} incidence, treatment efficacy, we followed up newly diagnosed chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patients residing in Shanghai during 2001 - 2006. Methods All eligible cases were reviewed {{with the data}} of efficacy responses as well as overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) time. Results A total of 615 cases entered the study. CML mainly afflicted those aged 40 - 60 years old and was slightly more frequent in males than females. More than 85 % of the patients were in chronic phase (CP) when diagnosed. All patients were divided into four groups based on the main regimens - hydroxyurea, interferon alpha (IFN-α), imatinib, and hemopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). With the median follow-up of 18 months, imatinib treatment induced 92. 2 % complete hematologic responses, and 64. 3 % complete cytogenetic responses among CML-CP patients. Overall the therapeutic efficacy in the imatinib group was higher than that in the hydroxyurea or IFN-α group. Meanwhile, in the imatinib group, all response rates of patients in CP were significantly greater than that in accelerated or <b>blastic</b> crisis <b>phase.</b> The patients treated with imatinib also showed the most promising results regarding OS and PFS. Patients receiving HSCT decreased markedly in number {{with the introduction of}} imatinib. Conclusions The number of new patients arising in Shanghai increased from 2001 to 2006. There were still patients receiving hydroxyurea and IFN-α. As the first-line regime for CML, imatinib was less administered in Shanghai before, but has received considerable development and great responses since 2003. </p...|$|R
40|$|Chronic {{myelogenous leukemia}} (CML) is a clonal {{hematological}} disorder, which {{is characterized by}} the presence of the classical or variant Philadelphia translocations. During the progression to <b>blastic</b> <b>phase</b> of the disease secondary chromosomal abnormalities may emerge. Such secondary chromosomal abnormalities are nonrandom, the more frequent ones being trisomy 8 and 19, supernumerary i(17 q), and extra Philadelphia chromosomes. Furthermore, a minor percentage of the patients may acquire different secondary chromosomal abnormalities including translocations between other chromosomes. We report here a patient with Ph+ CML presenting secondary chromosomal abnormalities including t(4; 11) (q 21;q 23), t(3; 3) (q 29;q 23) and t(11; 18) (q 10;q 10) during the course of CML progression...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{demonstrate}} that maturing neoplastic cells from {{patients with chronic}} myelogenous leukemia (CML) constitutively produce G-CSF and are also receptive for this molecule. G-CSF functions as an autocrine growth factor in stable phase CML, and thus is responsible for divisions of maturing leukemic cells leading to {{an expansion of the}} compartment of mature cells. This observation is well in line with in vivo features of CML in stable phase, i. e., the hyperplasia of the mature granulocyte compartment. In acute <b>blastic</b> <b>phase</b> of CML expression of the G-CSF gene seems to be less common and not related to autonomous blast growth...|$|E
40|$|Two {{patients}} with Ph-positive chronic myelocytic leukemia in erythroblastic transformation and rearrangement {{of the short}} arm of chromosome 18 are reported. Fluorescence in situ hybridization studies showed that the 18 p rearrangement resulted from translocation of {{the main part of}} chromosome 22 long arm to 18 p, including BCR-ABL 1 fusion. The 18 p abnormality resulted, thus, in loss of 18 p and duplication of BCR-ABL 1 in both patients. The possible relation to the erythroblastic type of <b>blastic</b> <b>phase</b> is briefly discussed. In addition an apparently intact germline ABL 1 gene was duplicated and inserted into chromosome 6 at band p 21 in one of these patients...|$|E

40|$|AbstractRheumatoid {{arthritis}} may {{be associated}} with an increased risk of hematological malignancy. Increased lympho-proliferative malignancy in rheumatoid arthritis is often described; however an increased risk of leukemia is not a common finding. A few cases of rheumatoid arthritis have been documented associated with chronic myeloid leukemia in the literature. We report a new case. Case presentationA 36 -year-old Moroccan female diagnosed as rheumatoid arthritis eight years ago, was on remission under Methotrexate and prednisone. This therapy was stopped one year before her admission at our hospital because of thrombopenia and anemia. She had polyarthritis flare. The physical examination found splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and skin lesions at the trunk and limbs. Peripheral blood findings, peripheral smear and bone marrow aspiration diagnosed myeloid leukemia in a <b>blastic</b> accelerated <b>phase</b> with negative Philadelphia chromosome. The skin lesions were diagnosed as pyoderma gangrenosum (skin biopsy). She received oral prednisone and chemotherapy (Cytarabine and 6 -Mercaptopurine). She had a complete response on the skin lesions, partial regression of splenomegaly, and improvement of her hematologic disorders. Unfortunately the patient died from septic shock after two weeks of post-chemotherapy pancytopenia. ConclusionWe report an unusual case of rheumatoid arthritis complicated by chronic myeloid leukemia associated with pyoderma gangrenosum. It is unclear whether the development of chronic myeloid leukemia in the patient with rheumatoid arthritis occurs by chance alone, is due to the underlying disease, or is facilitated by drugs. Whatever the cause is, it should be kept in mind that chronic myeloid leukemia may develop in the course of rheumatoid arthritis...|$|R
