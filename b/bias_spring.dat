40|$|Abstract. The main {{drawbacks}} of SMA actuators are a slow {{response and}} {{a waste of}} electric power. The power should be continuously supplied for SMA elements to remain austenite state until the actuator begins to take the other position. The problems are more serious when batteries and thick SMA elements are used. We propose a new SMA actuator which consumes little energy and responds very quickly. The actuator consists of a specially designed <b>bias</b> <b>spring</b> and two SMA elements which exert the force in opposite direction to each other. The <b>bias</b> <b>spring,</b> unlike a common spring which has one stable position, has two stable positions. A SMA 1, for instance, contracts on heating by electricity, the actuator takes one stable configuration. No further power supply is necessary to maintain the stable position, providing enough time for the SMA 1 to cool. When the other SMA 2 is heated, it contracts with enough force to move the <b>bias</b> <b>spring</b> and to expand the already-cooled SMA 1. Power supply stops immediately after the actuator takes the other stable configuration, causing power saving and quick response...|$|E

40|$|In {{the field}} of microsystems, there is strong {{interest}} in reducing the size of devices. However, the assembly of different components {{becomes more and more}} difficult as miniaturisation progresses. To solve this problem, we have developed a new concept of monolithic micro-devices. In this concept, one piece of Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) is considered as a complete mechanical system including all functionalities of the device. For example, in a microgripper, <b>bias</b> <b>spring,</b> jaws and actuator will be integrated within the same piece of material. Without special thermo-mechanical treatments, the shape memory effect is not reversible. In conventional devices made up of separate elements, a <b>bias</b> <b>spring</b> is typically required. In the monolithic design, a part of the SMA has to fulfil this function. This implies that different parts of the material will have different mechanical properties and that shape memory effect is only introduced in some predefined areas. In this paper, a new approach based on local laser annealing is proposed. The laser is used to locally crystallise the SMA. Annealed parts will show shape memory and the non-annealed ones will have elastic behaviour. This method can be applied on work-hardened material as well as on amorphous thin film.

40|$|The present thesis {{focuses on}} the effect of 5 MeV Ni ion {{irradiation}} on the microstructure and the thermomechanical behavior in prestrained (ε∼ 4 %) martensitic Ti-rich NiTi thin films. At this ion energy, damage is limited to a depth of approximately 2 µm (the ion projected range predicted the Transport and Range of Ions in Matter (TRIM) code). When applied to a pre-deformed 6 µm thick film, this technique may be used to excite reversible out-of-plane bending which can perform useful work as an actuator in microdevices. Conceptually, the frustration of the martensitic transformation by ion beam damage creates a differential latent strain between the beam-damaged and undamaged layer upon reverse transformation. Furthermore, the beam-damaged layer acts as an intrinsic <b>bias</b> <b>spring</b> that allows a reversible bending motion during thermal cycling. Thus, the actuator and <b>bias</b> <b>spring</b> can be realized in a single thin film element, using a single and simple planar processing. Due to the potential complexity of the thermomechanical response of the bimorph, it is obvious that detailed information about the effects of high-energy heavy-ion irradiation on microstructure and transformation characteristics are needed if the performance of these ion-biased bimorphs is to be optimized. Thus, the present thesis work has been undertaken to develop {{a better understanding of the}} influence of ion irradiation parameters on thermally-induced cyclic deflection, with a strong emphasis on the development of the ion damaged microstructure. Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigations and X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies of the irradiated microstructure showed that both NiTi and Ti 2 Ni precipitates were readily amorphized with 5 MeV Ni ions at doses above 5 × 1013 ions/cm 2, especially at lower irradiation temperatures, i. e. 1014 ions/cm 2, significant bending movements were achieved. However, a loss in the film's reversible bending motion was observed during initial cycling, especially at high temperatures, that was attributed to the relaxation of the high elastic stresses in beam-damage layer due to the structural relaxations within the amorphous material. For use as actuator material, it is recommended that the NiTi thin films be irradiated above a fluence of 1 × 1015 ions/cm 2 for two reasons, (1) the beam-damaged layer has a more homogeneous microstructure, and thus mechanical properties should be more uniform properties, (2) the bi-morph is more thermally stable and has lower cyclic fatigue...|$|E

This can make the car quite lively and easy to rotate at low speed, but in higher speed corners this effect becomes more pronounced and can be a handful to manage. To reduce the tendency to oversteer, Honda fitted softer rear tires on the NSX. For the NSX-R, Honda reversed the <b>spring</b> <b>bias,</b> placing stiffer <b>springs</b> on the front suspension along with stiffer front sway bar.

Overall, the NSX-R uses much stiffer front sway bar along with stiffer springs than the stock NSX (21.0mm xt2.6mm front sway bar :F 3.0 kg/mm—R 4.0 kg/mm for the NSX versus F 8.0 kg/mm—R 5.7 kg/mm for the NSX-R).|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Tracking {{control of}} {{shape memory alloy}} (SMA) {{actuators}} is essential in many applications such as vibration controls. Due to the hysteresis, an inherent nonlinear phenomenon associated with SMAs, open-loop control design has proven inadequate for tracking control of these actuators. Aimed at eliminating the position sensor to reduce cost of an SMA actuator system, in this paper, a neural network open loop controller is proposed for tracking control of an SMA actuator. A test stand, including a titanium–nickel (TiNi, or Nitinol) SMA wire actuator, a position sensor, <b>bias</b> <b>springs,</b> and a programmable current amplifier, is used to generate training data and to verify the neural networks open loop controller. A digital data acquisition and real-time control system was used to record experimental data and to implement the control strategy. Based on the training data obtained from the test stand, two neural networks are used to respectively model the forward and inverse hysteresis relations between the applied voltage and the displacement of the SMA wire actuator.

The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the neural network open loop controller for tracking control of the SMA wire actuator.

40|$|The figures depict two {{miniature}} mechanisms actuated by strips made of shape-memory alloy (SMA). A typical SMA is a nickel-titanium alloy {{known by}} the trade name "Flexinol" or "Nitinol. " In preparation for a typical application, a suitably sized and shaped piece of an SMA is deformed by a predetermined amount at the lower of two operating temperatures, then mounted in a mechanism. When stroking of the mechanism in one direction is desired, the piece of SMA is heated above a transition temperature to make it return to the "remembered" undeformed state. When stroking of the mechanism {{in the opposite direction}} is desired, the SMA is cooled below the transition temperature to make it return to the deformed state. Also, the SMA alloy chosen for a specific application is one that has a transition temperature somewhat above the ambient temperature, so that stroking in one direction or the opposite direction can be achieved by heating the SMA, or refraining from heating the SMA, respectively, above the transition temperature. In the present mechanisms as in typical other SMA mechanisms, the heating is effected by electric currents applied via electrical contacts at the ends of the SMA strips. The purpose served by the mechanism of Figure 1 is to lock or release a flexible latch attachment. In preparation for use in this mechanism, two initially straight SMA strips are deformed into curved springs that, when mounted in the mechanism at ambient temperature, clamp the knob {{at the lower end of}} the flexible latch attachment. When heated above their transition temperature by an electric current, the SMA strips return to their original straight configuration, thereby releasing the knob. This mechanism is redundant in the sense that as long as at least one of the two SMA strips straightens when commanded to do so, the knob is released. The mechanism of Figure 2 is suited to any of a variety of applications in which there are requirements for a small mechanism that affords lowtorque rotary actuation through a finite angular range.

Commonly, we assume that the interactions are negligible, but if {{this is not the case}} then these non-negligible interactions will bias the main effect estimates. We review the minimum aberration criterion under the baseline parameterization, which is to be used to compare the sizes of the bias among different designs. We define a design as optimal if it has the minimum bias among most efficient designs. Optimal designs for N ≡ 0 (mod 4), where N is the run size, were discussed by Mukerjee & Tang (2011). We continue this line of study by investigating optimal designs for the cases N ≡ 1 and 2 (mod 4). Searching for an optimal design among all possible designs is computationally very expensive, except for small N and m, where m is the number of factors. Cheng’s (2014) results are used to narrow down the search domain. We have done a complete search for small N and m. We have found that one can directly use Cheng’s (2014) theorem to find an optimal design for the case N ≡ 1 (mod 4). But for the case N ≡ 2 (mod 4), a small modification is required...|$|R
40|$|An all metal energy {{dissipator}} construction is disclosed for dissipating kinetic energy force (F) by rolling balls which are forced by a tapered surface on an expandable sleeve to frictionally load a force rod. The balls are maintained in an initial position by a plate member which is <b>biased</b> by a <b>spring</b> member. A spring member returns the force rod to its initial position after a loading force is removed...|$|R
5000|$|A {{rotary switch}} {{operates}} with a twisting {{motion of the}} operating handle {{with at least two}} positions. One or more positions of the switch may be momentary (<b>biased</b> with a <b>spring),</b> requiring the operator to hold the switch in the position. Other positions may have a detent to hold the position when released. A rotary switch may have multiple levels or [...] "decks" [...] in order to allow it to control multiple circuits.|$|R
40|$|The {{availability}} of engineering strength data on shape memory alloys (SMAs) under cyclic thermalactivation (functional fatigue) {{is central to}} the rational design of smart actuators based on these materials. Testresults on SMAs under functional fatigue are scarce in the technical literature and the few data available aremainly limited to constant-stress loading. Since the SMA elements used within actuators are normally <b>biased</b> byelastic <b>springs</b> or by another SMA element, their stress state is far from constant in operation. The mismatchbetween actual working conditions and laboratory arrangements leads to suboptimal designs and underminesthe prediction of the actuator lifetime. This paper aims at bridging the gap between experiment and reality. Fourtest procedures are planned, covering most of the typical situations occurring in practice: constant-stress,constant-strain, constant-stress with limited maximum strain and linear stress-strain variation with limitedmaximum strain. The paper describes the experimental apparatus specifically designed to implement the fourloading conditions and presents fatigue results obtained from commercial NiTi wires tested under all thoseprotocols...|$|R
