Somerset, having {{finished}} {{on the bottom}} of the County Championship table for the four years between 1952–1955, had embarked on a renewal programme. Part of the programme involved a vigorous recruiting campaign, including an offer to McCool that saw him return to first-class cricket at the age of 39.|$|E

40|$|Based on {{the theory}} of heat and mass transfer, a coupled model for the porous food vacuum cooling process is constructed. Sensitivity {{analyses}} of the process to food density, thermal conductivity, specific heat, latent heat of evaporation, diameter of pores, mass transfer coefficient, viscosity of gas, and porosity were examined. The simulation {{results show that the}} food density would affect the vacuum cooling process but not the vacuum cooling end temperature. The surface temperature of food was slightly affected and the core temperature is not affected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>changed</b> thermal conductivity. <b>The</b> core temperature and surface temperature are affected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>changed</b> specific heat. <b>The</b> core temperature and surface temperature are affected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>changed</b> latent heat of evaporation. The core temperature is affected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> diameter of pores. But the surface temperature is not affected obviously. The core temperature and surface temperature are not affected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>changed</b> gas viscosity. <b>The</b> parameter sensitivity of mass transfer coefficient is obvious. The core temperature and surface temperature are affected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>changed</b> mass transfer coefficient. In all the simulations, the end temperature of core and surface is not affected. The vacuum cooling process of porous medium is a process controlled by outside process...|$|R

Apple denied wrongdoing but, in settlement of the claims, Apple ultimately reinstated the telephone support for the duration of original ownership of the otherwise obsolete products and customers affected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>change</b> were given a limited reimbursement if they had been refused telephone support, had been charged per incident, or had incurred third party support charges.|$|E
5|$|On 14 July 1947, the {{committee}} {{recommended that the}} flag of the Indian National Congress be adopted as the National Flag of India with suitable modifications, so as to make it acceptable to all parties and communities. It was also resolved that the flag should not have any communal undertones. The spinning wheel of the Congress flag was replaced by the Chakra (wheel) from the Lion Capital of Ashoka. According to Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, the chakra was chosen as it was representative of dharma and law. However, Jawaharlal Nehru explained that the change was more practical in nature, as unlike the flag with the spinning wheel, this design would appear symmetrical. Gandhi was not very pleased <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>change,</b> but eventually came around to accepting it.|$|E
5|$|The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) {{truncated}} the US10 designation from Detroit to Bay City in 1986. The US10 designation {{was removed}} from its concurrencies with I-75 and US23. The section along Dixie Highway and Telegraph Road between Pontiac and Southfield was redesignated {{as an extension of}} US24. The Lodge Freeway was given the M-10 designation and Bus. US10 in Pontiac was renumbered as Bus. US24. M-115 was transferred off the US10 freeway in the Clare area in 1989 back to its previous routing before the 1975 changes. The last change made to the routing of the highway came in 1998 in Ludington. Reconfiguration of the carferry docks and parking lot moved US10 along James Street instead of William Street. The three blocks of Ludington Avenue affected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>change</b> were given the M-116 designation. At their Spring Meeting in 2015, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials official extended US10 to include the route of the SS Badger between Ludington and Manitowoc.|$|E

5|$|The Pichilemu {{earthquake}} {{was caused}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>change</b> in regional stress from the 27February earthquake. Preliminary analyses by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) of the 11March earthquake locations and seismic-wave radiation patterns {{suggested that the}} event resulted from normal faulting within the subducting Nazca plate or the overriding South America plate, unlike the 27 February earthquake, which occurred as thrust faulting on the interface between the two plates. Later in 2010, University of Chile Seismologist Sergio Barrientos stated that the earthquake was produced inside the South American plate. While news media reported the earthquake as an aftershock of the February earthquake in Chile, a preliminary geological summary issued by the USGS considered {{it to be an}} independent earthquake, a conclusion which seismologist Jaime Campos of the University of Chile also reached.|$|E

The scissor doors were dropped for the production model, and significant redesign work was carried out on the design when the wheelbase and overall length of the car was altered. Geoff Lawson, Design Director at Jaguar took a greater interest {{in the car and}} insisted the design had to be seen to be a Jaguar if it was to be successful in promoting the company. Keith Helfet returned to undertake the necessary redesign work mandated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>change</b> in the wheelbase, which was reduced by 200mm.|$|E

5|$|Grasses such as sea {{couch grass}} and sea poa grass have an {{important}} function in the driest areas of the marshes, and on the coastal dunes, where marram grass, sand couch-grass, lyme-grass and grey hair-grass help to bind the sand. Sea holly, sand sedge, bird's-foot trefoil and pyramidal orchid are other specialists of this arid habitat. Some specialised mosses and lichens are found on the dunes, and help to consolidate the sand; a survey in September 2009 found 41 lichen species. The plant distribution {{is influenced by the}} dunes' age as well as their moisture content, the deposits becoming less alkaline as calcium carbonate from animal shells is leached out of the sand to be replaced by more acidic humus from plant decomposition products. Marram grass is particularly discouraged <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>change</b> in acidity. A similar pattern is seen with mosses and lichens, with the various areas of the dunes containing different species according to the acidity of the sand. At least four moss species have been identified as important in dune stabilization, since they help to consolidate the sand, add nutrients as they decompose, and pave the way for more exacting plant species. The moss and lichen flora of Blakeney Point differs markedly from that of lime-rich dunes on the western coasts of the UK. Non-native tree lupins have become established near the Lifeboat House, where they now grow wild.|$|E
