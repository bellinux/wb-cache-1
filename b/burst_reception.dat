40|$|Burst timing {{synchronisation}} is maintained {{in a digital}} data decoder during multiple <b>burst</b> <b>reception</b> in a TDMA system. The data within a multiple burst are streamed into memory storage and data corresponding to a first burst in the series of bursts are {{selected on the basis}} of a current timing estimate derived from a synchronisation burst. Selections of data corresponding to other bursts in the series of bursts are modified in accordance with updated timing estimates derived from previously processed bursts...|$|E
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a novel scheme for 2 R <b>burst</b> mode <b>reception</b> capable of operating error-free with 40 Gb/s variable length, asynchronous optical data packets that exhibit up to 9 dB packet-to-packet power variation. It {{consists of a}} single, hybrid integrated, SOA-based MachZehnder Interferometer (SOA-MZI) with unequal splitting ratio couplers, configured to operate as a self-switch. We analyze theoretically the power equalization properties of unequal splitting ratio SOA-MZI switches and show good agreement between theory and experiment.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel Connection Admission Control (CAC) strategy for vehicular DVB-RCS satellite networks. Using estimations of arriving and departing traffic in each spot-beam our proposal aims to maximize user satisfaction and minimize {{at the same}} time resource reservation. Via GPS measurements, terminals periodically estimate their time to handoff and encapsulate mobility information within signaling <b>bursts.</b> Upon <b>reception</b> of a mobility update, the NCC (Network Control Centre) is able to estimate the amount of traffic roaming around the spot-beams as well as the probabilities that active terminals will eventually handoff. As a consequence, the NCC reserves only the necessary amount of resources for handover purposes in each spot-beam in order to minimize the percentage of connections forced to termination. No overhead is introduced for the implementation of our CAC solution as it makes use of the existing DVB-RCS signaling for providing the NCC with the extra mobility parameters driving the admission control module. Through an accurate ns- 2 modeling of existing DVB-RCS signaling mechanisms, we demonstrate that our lightweight CAC scheme outperforms static channel reservation schemes in terms of handover failure rate as well as traffic prediction strategies using mobility information in terms of channel utilization...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Awidely tunable {{burst mode}} digital {{coherent}} receiver is implemented in a 112 Gb/s DP-QPSK WDM system. The re-ceiver performance is validated in a 24 -channel WDM test-bed using a commercially available DS-DBR laser {{as the local}} oscil-lator. It is demonstrated that the wavelength tunable laser can switch {{to any one of}} the 24 -channels in less than 130 ns, thus en-abling the dynamic reception of 5 s optical bursts. The perfor-mance of the DS-DBR local oscillator laser is commensurate with <b>burst</b> mode coherent <b>reception</b> when differential decoding is em-ployed and the parallel DSP implementation does not impair the polarization and frequency tracking performance of a digital co-herent receiver under burst mode operation. The worst case re-configuration time of the burst mode receiver, which is a combi-nation of the laser switching time and the CMA convergence time, is less than 410 ns when switching from a single channel to any other channel in the WDM grid. It is shown that the variation in reconfiguration time is dependent on the convergence time of the CMA equalizer, which is adversely affected by certain input states of polarization.

40|$|When {{transmitting}} {{a signal}} {{over a large}} distance it is more efficient to send a brief beamed signal than a continuous omni-directional transmission but this requires that the receiver knows where and when {{to look for the}} transmission. For SETI, the use of various natural phenomena has previously been suggested to achieve the desired synchronization. Here it is proposed that gamma-ray bursts may well the best ``synchronizers'' of all currently known phenomena due to their large intrinsic luminosities, high occurrence rate, isotropic sky distribution, large distance from the Galaxy, short duration, and easy detectability. For targeted searches, precise positions for gamma-ray bursts are required together with precise distance measurements to a target star. The required burst position determinations are now starting to be obtained, aided in large part by the discovery of optical afterglows. Good distance measurements are currently available from Hipparcos and even better measurements should be provided by spacecraft now being developed. For non-targeted searches, positional accuracies simply better than a detector's field of view may suffice but the time delay between the detection of a gamma-ray <b>burst</b> and the <b>reception</b> of the transmitted signal cannot be predicted in an obvious way.
