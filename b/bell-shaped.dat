5|$|The Mercury {{spacecraft}} that astronaut Gus Grissom flew on July 21, 1961, {{was dubbed}} Liberty Bell 7. Mercury capsules were somewhat <b>bell-shaped,</b> {{and this one}} received a painted crack to mimic the original bell. Liberty Bell 7 became the only Mercury capsule to suffer an integrity failure.|$|E
5|$|Pillars are a {{major part}} of Western Chalukya {{architecture}} and were produced in two main types: pillars with alternate square blocks and a sculptured cylindrical section with a plain square-block base, and <b>bell-shaped</b> lathe-turned pillars. The former type is more vigorous and stronger than the <b>bell-shaped</b> type, which is made of soapstone and has a quality of its own. Inventive workmanship was used on soapstone shafts, roughly carved into the required shapes using a lathe. Instead of laboriously rotating a shaft to obtain the final finish, workers added the final touches to an upright shaft by using sharp tools. Some pillars were left unpolished, as evidenced by the presence of fine grooves made by the pointed end of the tool. In other cases, polishing resulted in pillars with fine reflective properties such as the pillars in the temples at Bankapura, Itagi and Hangal. This pillar art reached its zenith in the temples at Gadag, specifically the Sarasvati Temple in Gadag city.|$|E
5|$|Ashot III {{established}} the Kingdom of Lori (Tashir-Dzoraget Kingdom) in Gugark for strategic reasons and enthroned Gurgen in 982. Gurgen {{along with his}} brother Smbat are depicted on the sculptures of the patrons in both Sanahin and Haghpat. When the Tashir-Dzoraget kingdom fell {{as a result of}} Seljuk raids the Kyurikids migrated to Tavush and Metsnaberd yet they maintained ties with their ancestral fortress and compound in Akhtala. The fortress was built on an elevated rocky outcrop surrounded by deep canyons from three sides forming a natural protection. The somewhat accessible parts between the cliffs are reinforced by towers and walls. The only entrance to the compound is on the northern side protected by <b>bell-shaped</b> towers and walls. The walls and towers of the fortress are built of bluish basalt and lime mortar. The Kyurikids gradually lost their influence under the Seljuk grasp {{by the end of the}} 12th century.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{began on}} May 5, 1931, under Brother Theophorus Kleemann, SVD, who became ill and died on September 12, 1931; Arthur Bialucha, a German {{architect}} living in Qingdao {{who had already}} completed several projects for the SVD, took over as construction superintendent. Construction was frustrated in 1933, when Adolf Hitler {{came to power in}} Germany and prohibited the transfer of money overseas. The diocese independently shouldered the cost of finishing the cathedral. This required a number of design changes to reduce costs. The changes are evident in drawings published before completion of construction, which show the roofs of the towers as <b>bell-shaped.</b> However, the roofs of the completed structure were changed to spires. Construction was finished in 1934, and the cathedral was consecrated on October 28 that year.|$|E
5|$|Coprinopsis atramentaria, {{commonly}} known as the common ink cap or inky cap, is an edible (but sometimes poisonous, when combined with alcohol) mushroom found in Europe and North America. Previously known as Coprinus atramentarius, it is the second best known ink cap and previous member of the genus Coprinus after C.comatus. It is a widespread and common fungus found throughout the northern hemisphere. Clumps of mushrooms arise after rain from spring to autumn, commonly in urban and disturbed habitats such as vacant lots and lawns, as well as grassy areas. The grey-brown cap is initially <b>bell-shaped</b> before opening, after which it flattens and disintegrates. The flesh is thin and the taste mild. It can be eaten but is poisonous when consumed with alcohol – hence another common name, tippler's bane.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1930s, {{just before the}} {{outbreak}} of World War II, there was {{a revival of the}} hooped crinoline from designers such as Edward Molyneux, who put hoops in both day skirts and evening gowns, and Norman Hartnell, whose late 1930s Winterhalter-inspired crinoline designs for Queen Elizabeth were so successful that the Queen is popularly (if inaccurately) credited with having single-handedly brought crinolines back into fashion. Both as Queen, and as the Queen Mother, Elizabeth adopted the traditional <b>bell-shaped</b> crinoline as her signature look for evening wear and state occasions. The film Gone With The Wind, released in 1939, inspired the American fashion for prom dresses with crinolines in Spring 1940.|$|E
5|$|The corona, or paracorolla, is {{variously}} {{described as}} <b>bell-shaped</b> (funneliform, trumpet), bowl-shaped (cupular, crateriform, cup shaped) or disc-shaped with margins {{that are often}} frilled, and is free from the stamens. Rarely the corona is a simple callose (hardened, thickened) ring. The corona is formed during floral development as a tubular outgrowth from stamens which fuse into a tubular structure, the anthers becoming reduced. At its base the fragrances which attract pollinators are formed. All species produce nectar {{at the top of}} the ovary. Coronal morphology varies from the tiny pigmented disk of N. serotinus (see Table I) or the rudimentary structure in N. cavanillesii to the elongated trumpets of section Pseudonarcissus (trumpet daffodils, Table I).|$|E
5|$|The slender smooth-hound has a {{very thin}} body and a broad, highly {{flattened}} head. The snout is long, with a distinctive <b>bell-shaped</b> outline when viewed from above. The eyes have an elongate horizontal oval shape, and are equipped with rudimentary nictitating membranes (protective third eyelids). Beneath each eye is a prominent ridge, and behind is a much smaller spiracle. The nostrils are preceded by small, almost triangular flaps of skin. The line of the mouth forms an angle; there are very short furrows at the mouth corners. The upper and lower jaws contain 96–99 and 108–114 rows respectively of small, very closely spaced teeth; each tooth has a narrow upright central cusp flanked by smaller cusplets on both sides. The five pairs of gill slits are short.|$|E
5|$|The sparsely-spotted stingaree, white-spotted stingaree, or Dixon's stingaree (Urolophus paucimaculatus) is {{a species}} of {{stingray}} in the family Urolophidae, common off the southern Australian coast. Preferring sandy flats and seagrass beds, this benthic ray can be found from close to shore {{to a depth of}} at least , and tends to occur deeper in the northern portion of its range. Reaching a length of , this species has a broad, diamond-shaped pectoral fin disc that is typically plain gray in color above with a V-shaped marking between the eyes. Individuals from southerly waters also generally exhibit a smattering of small, dark-edged white spots. This ray is further characterized by a distinctively <b>bell-shaped</b> curtain of skin between the nostrils. Its tail has a skin fold running along either side and a leaf-shaped caudal fin, but no dorsal fin.|$|E
5|$|The sparsely-spotted {{stingray}} {{has a more}} or less diamond-shaped {{pectoral fin}} disc wider than long, with rounded outer corners. The anterior margins of the disc are nearly straight and converge at an obtuse angle on the fleshy snout, the tip of which barely protrudes from the disc. The small eyes are immediately followed by comma-shaped spiracles with angular or rounded posterior rims. The outer rim of each nostril is enlarged into a knob towards the back. Between the nostrils is a <b>bell-shaped</b> curtain of skin with a finely fringed trailing margin; only the Kapala stingaree (U.kapalensis) has a similarly shaped nasal curtain. The small mouth contains five or six papillae (nipple-like structures) on the floor, most of which have forked tips. Additional small papillae are present {{on the outside of the}} lower jaw. The teeth in both jaws are small with roughly oval bases, and are arranged in a quincunx pattern. The five pairs of gill slits are short. The pelvic fins are small and rounded.|$|E
5|$|There {{are male}} (staminate) and female (pistillate) flowers (unisexual flowers) {{on a single}} plant (monoecious), and these grow singly, {{appearing}} from the leaf axils. Flowers have five fused yellow to orange petals (the corolla) and a green <b>bell-shaped</b> calyx. Male flowers in Cucurbitaceae generally have five stamens, but in Cucurbita there are only three, and their anthers are joined together so that {{there appears to be}} one. Female flowers have thick pedicels, and an inferior ovary with 3–5 stigmas that each have two lobes. The female flowers of C.argyrosperma and C.ficifolia have larger corollas than the male flowers. Female flowers of C.pepo have a small calyx, but the calyx of C.moschata male flowers is comparatively short.|$|E
5|$|FitzRoy's {{instructions}} set {{detailed requirements}} for geological survey of a circular coral atoll to investigate how coral reefs formed, {{particularly if they}} rose {{from the bottom of}} the sea or from the summits of extinct volcanoes, and to assess the effects of tides by measurement with specially constructed gauges. FitzRoy chose the Keeling Islands in the Indian Ocean, and on arrival there on 1 April 1836, the entire crew set to work, first erecting FitzRoy's new design of a tide gauge that allowed readings to be taken from the shore. Boats were sent all around the island to carry out the survey, and despite being impeded by strong winds, they took numerous soundings to establish depths around the atoll and in the lagoon. FitzRoy noted the smooth and solid rock-like outer wall of the atoll, with most life thriving where the surf was most violent. He had great difficulty in establishing the depth reached by living coral, as pieces were hard to break off and the small anchors, hooks, grappling irons, and chains they used were all snapped off by the swell as soon as they tried to pull them up. He had more success using a sounding line with a <b>bell-shaped</b> lead weight armed with tallow hardened with lime; this would be indented by any shape that it struck to give an exact impression of the bottom; it would also collect any fragments of coral or grains of sand.|$|E
25|$|This stupa {{refers to}} the death of the Buddha when he was 80 years old. It symbolizes his {{complete}} absorption into the highest state of mind. It is <b>bell-shaped</b> and usually unornamented.|$|E
25|$|Graves with Beaker {{artifacts}} {{have been}} discovered in the Brescia area, like that of Ca' di Marco (Fiesse), while in central Italy, <b>bell-shaped</b> glasses {{were found in the}} tomb of Fosso Conicchio (Viterbo).|$|E
25|$|The Hubbert peak theory {{says that}} for any given {{geographical}} area, from an individual oil-producing region to the planet as a whole, the rate of petroleum production tends to follow a <b>bell-shaped</b> curve. It {{is one of the}} primary theories on peak oil.|$|E
25|$|In 1956, Hubbert {{proposed}} that fossil fuel production {{in a given}} region over time would follow a roughly <b>bell-shaped</b> curve without giving a precise formula; he later used the Hubbert curve, the derivative of the logistic curve, for estimating future production using past observed discoveries.|$|E
25|$|On {{the slopes}} of the Andes, in {{addition}} to the scattered tola desert brush, grasses are found. The central valley is characterized by several species of cacti, the hardy espinos, the Chilean pine, the southern beeches and the copihue, a red <b>bell-shaped</b> flower that is Chile's national flower.|$|E
25|$|The Beaker was {{introduced}} in Sicily from Sardinia and spread mainly in the north-west and south-west of the island. In the northwest and in the Palermo kept almost intact its cultural and social characteristics, while in the south-west {{there was a strong}} integration with local cultures. The only known single <b>bell-shaped</b> glass in eastern Sicily was found in Syracuse.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, Sawyer and Maley {{used the}} Kebara 2 ribcage and pelvis in their full {{reconstruction}} of a Neanderthal skeleton. This {{was the first}} time a Neanderthal ribcage was rebuilt. The lower rib area flared, giving the whole ribcage a <b>bell-shaped</b> appearance, rather than the barrel-shaped one Neanderthals were for {{a century and a half}} thought to have had.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-16th century, Conrad Haas wrote a {{book that}} {{described}} rocket technology that combined fireworks and weapons technologies. This manuscript was discovered in 1961, in the Sibiu public records (Sibiu public records Varia II 374). His work dealt with the theory of motion of multi-stage rockets, different fuel mixtures using liquid fuel, and introduced delta-shape fins and <b>bell-shaped</b> nozzles.|$|E
25|$|Menstrual cups – A firm, {{flexible}} <b>bell-shaped</b> device worn {{inside the}} vagina {{for about half}} a day or overnight to catch menstrual flow. They are emptied into the toilet or sink when full, washed and re-inserted (washing hands with soap before doing so is crucial). Menstrual cups are usually made of silicone and can last 5 years or longer. At {{the end of the}} period, they are sterilised, usually by boiling in water.|$|E
25|$|However, as crinolines {{started to}} develop in fashion, sleeves turned to be like large bells which gave the dress a heavier volume. Engageantes, which were usually made of lace, linen, or lawn, with cambric and broderie anglaise, were worn under the sleeves. They were easy to remove, launder and {{restitch}} into position, so to act as false sleeves, which was tacked to the elbow-length sleeves during the time. They commonly appear under the <b>bell-shaped</b> sleeves of day dresses.|$|E
25|$|Two {{versions}} of radial coupler {{were used in}} South Africa. One, the Johnston coupler, commonly known as a bell link-and-pin coupler, was introduced in 1873 and is similar in operation to and compatible with link-and-pin couplers, but <b>bell-shaped</b> with a circular coupler face. The other, the bell-and-hook coupler, was introduced in 1902 and {{is similar to the}} Norwegian coupler, but also with a circular coupler face and with a coupler pocket which is open {{at the top of the}} coupler face to accommodate the drawhook.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{remarkable}} large-scale example of Rococo church building was the Frauenkirche at Dresden, recently rebuilt after its almost total destruction in World War II. The entire structures embodies a dynamic, surging motion which combines with a delicacy of architectural detail that {{is typical of the}} Rococo style. This church is dominated by its <b>bell-shaped</b> cupola which imitates in form those to be found on countless church towers in the region, but recreated here not in wood sheathed with metal, but as a mighty masonry dome.|$|E
25|$|From the 4th century {{until the}} 15th century, Hinduism and Buddhism shaped {{the culture of}} Indonesia. Kingdoms rise and fall, such as Medang Kingdom, Srivijaya, Kediri, Singhasari and Majapahit. Along the Indonesian {{classical}} history of Hindu-Buddhist era, they produced some temples and monuments called candi. The best-preserved Buddhist shrine, which was built during the Sailendra dynasty in the 8th century, is Borobudur temple in Central Java. A giant stone mandala stepped pyramid adorned with <b>bell-shaped</b> stupas, richly adorned with bas-reliefs telling the stories and teachings of Buddha.|$|E
25|$|The gowns most {{commonly}} worn, {{that of the}} clerical type gowns of Bachelor of Arts (BA) and Master of Arts (MA), are substantially the same throughout the English-speaking world. Both are traditionally made of black cloth, (although occasionally the gown is dyed {{in one of the}} university's colours) and have the material {{at the back of the}} gown gathered into a yoke. The BA gown has <b>bell-shaped</b> sleeves, while the MA gown has long sleeves closed at the end, with the arm passing through a slit above the elbow.|$|E
25|$|Mandragora is a {{plant genus}} {{belonging}} to the nightshade family (Solanaceae). Members of the genus are known as mandrakes. There are between three and five species in the genus. The one or two species found around the Mediterranean constitute the mandrake of ancient writers such as Dioscorides. Two or three further species are found eastwards into China. All are perennial herbaceous plants, with large tap-roots and leaves {{in the form of}} a rosette. Individual flowers are <b>bell-shaped,</b> whitish through to violet, and are followed by yellow or orange berries.|$|E
25|$|Brown {{catsharks}} have long, slender {{bodies with}} broad, <b>bell-shaped</b> snouts. They are dark brown with light-colored markings on the posterior margins of their fins. Their bodies {{are soft and}} flabby, with a weak skin that can easily be harmed. Brown catsharks' two dorsal fins are {{the same size and}} do not have spines. The first dorsal fin originates {{to the front of the}} pelvic fin and the second dorsal fin is located in front of the anal fin's insertion. They typically reach a maximum size of 68cm in total length, but they average between 30 and 60cm.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} Victorian decades, voluminous skirts held up with crinolines, and then hoop skirts, were {{the focal point}} of the silhouette. To enhance the style without distracting from it, hats were modest in size and design, straw and fabric bonnets being the popular choice. Poke bonnets, which had been worn during the late Regency period, had high, small crowns and brims that grew larger until the 1830s, when the face of a woman wearing a poke bonnet could only be seen {{directly}} from the front. They had rounded brims, echoing the rounded form of the <b>bell-shaped</b> hoop skirts.|$|E
25|$|In most mound-building species, males do {{most or all}} of {{the nest}} {{construction}} and maintenance. Using his strong legs and feet, the male scrapes together material from the area around his chosen nest site, gradually building a conical or <b>bell-shaped</b> pile. This process can take five to seven hours a day for more than a month. While mounds are typically reused for multiple breeding seasons, new material must be added each year in order to generate the appropriate amount of heat. A female will begin to lay eggs in the nest only when the mound's temperature has reached an optimal level.|$|E
25|$|Modern designs use metal <b>bell-shaped</b> weights {{rather than}} Stockbridge's {{concrete}} blocks. The bell is hollow and the damper cable is fixed internally to the distal end, which permits relative motion between the cable and damping weights. To provide for greater freedom of motion, the weights may be partially slotted in the vertical plane, allowing the cable to travel outside {{the confines of}} the bell. In some installations, the weights are unequal, allowing damping over a greater frequency range. More complex designs use weights with asymmetric mass distribution, which enables the damper to oscillate in several different frequency modes.|$|E
25|$|The {{rise of the}} Epi-Olmec {{culture on}} {{the western edge of}} the Olmec heartland coincides with the {{depopulation}} of the eastern half of the Olmec heartland and the decline of the Olmec culture in general. The Epi-Olmec culture represented a gradual transformation of, rather than a sharp break with, the Olmec culture. Many Olmec motifs, for example, were employed by its successor culture. Tres Zapotes, one of the largest Olmec sites, continued as a regional center under the Epi-Olmec culture. And daily life for the non-elites continued much the same: subsistence farming with opportunistic hunting and fishing, wattle-and-daub houses, thatched roofs, and <b>bell-shaped</b> storage pits.|$|E
25|$|Most rocket {{engines are}} {{internal}} combustion heat engines (although non combusting forms exist). Rocket engines generally produce a high temperature reaction mass, as a hot gas. This {{is achieved by}} combusting a solid, liquid or gaseous fuel with an oxidiser within a combustion chamber. The extremely hot gas is then allowed to escape through a high-expansion ratio nozzle. This <b>bell-shaped</b> nozzle is what gives a rocket engine its characteristic shape. The effect of the nozzle is to dramatically accelerate the mass, converting most of the thermal energy into kinetic energy. Exhaust speed reaching as high as 10 times {{the speed of sound}} at sea level are common.|$|E
25|$|The most {{elaborate}} stupa is the 8th century Borobudur monument in Java, Indonesia. The upper rounded terrace {{with rows of}} <b>bell-shaped</b> stupas contained Buddha images symbolizing Arūpajhāna, the sphere of formlessness. The main stupa itself is empty, symbolizing complete perfection of enlightenment. The main stupa is the crown part of the monument, while the base is a pyramidal structure elaborated with galleries adorned with bas relief scenes derived from Buddhist texts and depicting the life of Gautama Buddha. Borobudur's unique and significant architecture has been acknowledged by UNESCO as the largest Buddhist monument in the world. It is also the world’s largest Buddhist temple. {{as well as one}} of the greatest Buddhist monuments in the world.|$|E
25|$|Bat-pollinated flowers tend to {{be large}} and showy, white or light coloured, open at night and have strong musty odours. They are often large and <b>bell-shaped</b> or a ball of stamens. Flowers are {{typically}} borne away from the trunk or other obstructions. Bats drink the nectar, and these plants typically offer nectar for extended periods of time. Sight, smell, and echo-location are used to initially find the flowers, and excellent spatial memory is used to visit them repeatedly. In fact, bats can identify nectar-producing flowers using echolocation. In the New World, bat pollinated flowers often have sulfur-scented compounds, {{but this does not}} carry {{to other parts of the}} world. Bat-pollinated plants have bigger pollen than their relatives.|$|E
25|$|The late 1st century AD saw the {{introduction}} of the Kraftig Profilierte group of fibula designs. Kraftig Profilierte fibulae have a wide fan-, or <b>bell-shaped</b> head and a long thin pointy foot. They have long bilateral hinges. There are three main variations of the Kraftig Profilierte fibula. The North Pannonian Double Knot type, found in Pannonia has two knobs, or knots, on the bow. The Single Knot type, found in the central Balkans, has a single knob. The Black Sea type, found in the steppes north of the Black Sea, has a thin body, with no flaring near the head, and two knots. Kraftig Profilierte fibulae were found in the late 1st to late 2nd centuries AD and are mostly associated with the Przeworsk proto-Gothic culture.|$|E
