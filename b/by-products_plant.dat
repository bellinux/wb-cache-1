50|$|The first shaft was {{commenced}} in 1890 {{with the}} pit going into production in 1894.

In 1947 the colliery and its associated by-product plant passed to the National Coal Board, the colliery being closed the following year. As the collieries in the area became inter-connected it was retained as a pumping station. The coke ovens and <b>by-products</b> <b>plant</b> closed in 1962.|$|E

The BMC also operates two branch abattoirs, one in Maun {{and the other in}} Francistown, with respective capacities of 100 cattle per day and 400 cattle and 150 small stock per day.|$|R
50|$|The {{coke ovens}} and <b>by-product</b> <b>plant</b> were opened in 1951, {{as part of}} the NCB's {{modernisation}} of the regional and national coal industry. The plant produced both furnace and foundry coke for the steel industry. Both for the Welsh industry (then Ebbw Vale, Llanwern and Port Talbot and abroad, including Romania. The branded Phurnacite smokeless coal briquettes for the domestic market, produced in the Phurnacite works (Abercwmboi in the Cynon Valley) was also stored at Nantgarw awaiting sale.|$|R
50|$|Despite having claimed {{reserves}} {{equivalent to}} 60 years, by 1980 geological problems had restricted production to coming {{only from the}} Meadow Vein underneath Machen, and Big Vein. Most of this coal was transported by rail along the former Rumney Railway to the British Steel Corporation steel mill in Llanwern, while the residual {{was sent to the}} coking plant at Trethomas, adjacent to the colliery site, which had been leased to the British Benzol and Coal Distillation Co.

50|$|The post-war {{period was}} very {{difficult}} for West Cumberland, but Lowca was something of an exception in that the United Coke and Chemicals Company <b>by-products</b> <b>plant</b> was built there in 1923 to refine tars produced by the coking plants in the Workington area, as well as the coke ovens in Lowca itself. Many photos of traffic on the line right up to closure include tar wagons which would typically travel up to Lowca loaded. The plant finally closed in 1978, five years after the LLR.|$|E

The purchased {{was followed by the}} acquisition of the Waterford plant of Clover Meats (after that company's collapse) for around £2m in February 1985. It includes the purchase of National Proteins, a <b>by-products</b> <b>plant</b> processing meat and bone meal from edible offal.|$|E
5|$|In 1925, NESCo set up {{separate}} {{plant at}} the power station for the low temperature carbonisation treatment of coal, before being burned in boilers and the steam used for electricity generation. The treatment plant was manufactured by Babcock & Wilcox, and {{set up in a}} self-contained boiler house which contained four boilers, four retorts and pulverising mills. The building was also fitted with gas-stripping and <b>by-product</b> <b>plants.</b> The carbonising plant could handle up to 100 tonnes of coal per day, while its boilers produced 78,000lb of steam per hour. This plant was extended in 1931.|$|R

50|$|Immediately before nationalisation, Manvers {{was owned}} by Manvers Main Collieries Ltd. The coke ovens and coal <b>by-products</b> <b>plant</b> were closed in 1981. With {{rationalisation}} in the South Yorkshire coalfield, from 1950 to 1956, Manvers became the centre of coal output from a the collieries known as the South Manvers complex that were linked below ground. They were Wath Main, Barnburgh Colliery and Kilnhurst. Each colliery retained its individual identity but the coal was wound to the surface at Manvers; this was done to protect the loyalties and friendships of the local pitworkers at each mine. The colliery complex was closed on 25 March 1988.|$|E
5000|$|Further {{developments}} {{took place}} after the Second World War, with an open-hearth steel making facility being commissioned in 1949. The Glebe coke ovens were extended to their maximum number of 141 in 1953 and plans for No. 6 coke oven battery were formulated shortly after. These were to be built on old quarry workings {{to the north of}} the Open-Hearth building and enough land was levelled to accommodate a complete blast furnace plant as well as for the coke ovens <b>by-products</b> <b>plant</b> and gasholder. No. 6 battery of 51 ovens was commissioned in 1961; however, after the footings were installed for the blast furnace, the rest of the construction was put [...] "temporarily on hold", and work was never continued.|$|E
5000|$|The works was {{situated}} by the dam marking the upper tidal {{limit of the}} river, where Swalwell Juniors F.C. now stands. The CPP which washed and blended the coal prior to the coking process stood at the north-eastern end of the site, along with large storage bunkers. A conveyor fed blended coal from these bunkers into another bunker {{on top of the}} ovens which in turn fed the charging car. The ovens themselves were parallel to the A694, which passes the site, and stood on the area of land now occupied by the two football pitches. There were several railway sidings for both coal and coke between the ovens and the road. The pusher was {{on the opposite side of}} the ovens, and the coke was shoved out on the side nearest the road. The quenching tower was at the north-eastern end of the battery of ovens, near the CPP, and the chimney was at the opposite end. Between the ovens and the river were the power plant with its associated boilers and chimneys, as well as the <b>by-products</b> <b>plant.</b> The latter [...] "scrubbed" [...] the gas produced in the ovens, extracting chemicals such as tar and ammonia, which were piped into storage tanks. The gas was then stored in a tall gas holder to the south-east of the site, near the river.|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{industrial}} ecology {{has been applied}} in this research to study possibilities to develop an eco-industrial cluster model for fishery production industry in Vietnam. By learning from experiments of other developed countries, we apply the principles of Industrial Ecology and of Ecological Modernization {{in the context of}} Vietnam. We design a physical-technological conceptual model for minimizing waste in agro-industries, with a case study of frozen shrimp production. The results indicate that it is possible and feasible to develop an eco-industrial cluster including aquaculture, fishery processing companies, <b>by-product</b> <b>plants,</b> and wastewater treatment units. By doing so, aquaculture and industry can cooperate for environmentally sound development. Actors and institutions that may govern the proposed eco-industrial cluster of shrimp processing industry are also analysed in this paper.

40|$|Basic Substances are a newly {{effective}} {{category of}} Plant Protection Product under EC Regulation No 1107 / 2009. The first approved application of Equisetum arvense L. opened Part C of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540 / 2011, which lists the basic substance approved. Although E. arvense {{was described as}} a fungicide extract, subsequent applications like chitosan were related to non-biocide molecules. Consequently, plant protection product data were collected from research on alternative or traditional crop protection methods. They are notably issued or derived from foodstuffs (plants, plant <b>by-products,</b> <b>plant</b> derived products, substances and derived substances from animal origin). Applications are currently submitted by our Institute, under evaluation at different stages of the approval process or already approved. Remarkably, this Basic Substance category under pesticide EU Regulation was surprisingly designed for these non-biocidal plant protection products. In fact, components described as the “active substance” of most of the actual applications are food products like sugars and lecithin. Basic Substance applications for these foodstuffs are therefore a straightforward way of easily gaining approval for them. Here we describe the approval context and detail the agricultural uses of theses food products as Biological Control Agents (BCAs) or biorationals for crop protection. From all deposited or approved Basic Substance Application (BSA), a proof has been provided that non-biocide and food products via physical barrier or lure effects may be effective plant protection products with an acceptable low profile of concern for public and agricultural safety...|$|E
