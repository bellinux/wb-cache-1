40|$|Problem statement: Segmentation {{plays an}} {{important}} role in medical imaging. Segmentation of an image is the division or separation of the image into dissimilar regions of similar attribute. In this study we proposed a methodology that integrates clustering algorithm and <b>marker</b> <b>controlled</b> watershed segmentation algorithm for medical image segmentation. The use of the conservative watershed algorithm for medical image analysis is pervasive because of its advantages, such as always being able to construct an entire division of the image. On the other hand, its disadvantages include over segmentation and sensitivity to false edges. Approach: In this study we proposed a methodology that integrates K-Means clustering with <b>marker</b> <b>controlled</b> watershed segmentation algorithm and integrates Fuzzy C-Means clustering with <b>marker</b> <b>controlled</b> watershed segmentation algorithm separately for medical image segmentation. The Clustering algorithms are unsupervised learning algorithms, while the <b>marker</b> <b>controlled</b> watershed segmentation algorithm makes use of automated thresholding on the gradient magnitude map and post-segmentation merging on the initial partitions to reduce the number of false edges and over-segmentation. Results: In this study, we compared K-means clustering and <b>marker</b> <b>controlled</b> watershed algorithm with Fuzzy C-means clustering and <b>marker</b> <b>controlled</b> watershed algorithm. And also we showed that our proposed method produced segmentation maps which gave fewer partitions than the segmentation maps produced by the conservative watershed algorithm. Conclusion: Integration of K-means clustering with <b>marker</b> <b>controlled</b> watershed algorithm gave better segmentation than integration of Fuzzy C-means clustering with <b>marker</b> <b>controlled</b> watershed algorithm. By reducing the amount of over segmentation, we obtained a segmentation map which is more diplomats of the several anatomies in the medical images...|$|R
40|$|Segmentation {{refers to}} the process of {{partitioning}} a digital image into multiple segments (sets of pixels, also known as superpixels). The goal of segmentation is to simplify and/or change the representation of an image into something that is more meaningful and easier to analyze. Image segmentation is used to cluster pixels into salient image regions, i. e., regions corresponding to individual surfaces, objects, or natural parts of objects. The watershed transform has interesting properties that make it useful for many different image segmentation applications: it is simple and intuitive, can be parallelized, and always produces a complete division of the image. However, when applied to medical image analysis, it has important drawbacks (oversegmentation, sensitivity to noise). In this paper medical image segmentation using <b>marker</b> <b>controlled</b> watershed segmentation is presented. Objective of this paper is segmenting the medical image using <b>marker</b> <b>controlled</b> watershed segmentation, and comparing the results of directly applying watershed transformation and <b>marker</b> <b>controlled</b> watershed transformation...|$|R
40|$|Segmentation plays a {{vital role}} in medical imaging. Segmentation of an image is the {{partition}} or separation of the image into disjoint regions of similar feature. We propose a method that integrates Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering and <b>marker</b> <b>controlled</b> watershed segmentation algorithm for medical image segmentation. The use of the usual watershed algorithm for medical image analysis is common because of its advantages, such as always being able to construct a complete division of the image. However, its downsides include over-segmentation and sensitivity to false edges. We concentrate on the downsides of the usual watershed algorithm when it is applied to medical images by using Fuzzy C-Means clustering to produce a primary segmentation of the image before we apply <b>marker</b> <b>controlled</b> watershed segmentation algorithm to it. The Fuzzy C-Means clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm, while the <b>marker</b> <b>controlled</b> watershed segmentation algorithm makes use of automated thresholding on the gradient magnitude map on the initial partitions {{to reduce the number of}} false edges and over-segmentation. The proposed algorithm is compared with conservative watershed method...|$|R

A satisfying segmentation method is required to help the following classification thus helping land managers to make decisions about their management. This project focuses on object-based segmentation and four approaches: multiresolution segmentation of eCognition Professional 4. 0, along with edge-based segmentation, <b>marker</b> <b>controlled</b> segmentation and efficient graph-based segmentation of python. They were investigated in terms of their performances and a comparison was made between them. Results showed that the quality of multiresolution segmentation is the best of the four. Edge-based segmentation result was limited to the sigma value that is used to smooth the image. The result of <b>marker</b> <b>controlled</b> segmentation was good to segment a certain aged heather stands. This is due to the limited number of user-defined markers. Efficient graph-based segmentation showed the closest result to that of multiresolution segmentation of eCognition Professional 4. 0. In terms of the processing time, eCognition multiresolution segmentation took around 28 seconds, which is the longest. For edge-based segmentation, the time consumed was about 13 seconds, followed by efficient graph-based (16 seconds) and <b>marker</b> <b>controlled</b> segmentation (26 seconds). Therefore, python segmentation showed a potential to produce satisfying result with less processing time although a large amount of future work needs to be done...|$|R

The use of markers can avoid the problem of over segmentation. The algorithm works on color as well as gray-scale images.

Based on their phenotypic markers and by their presence in germ-free mice, these preexisting memory-like CD 44 hi CD 8 T cells are likely to arise via physiological homeostatic proliferation rather than a response to environmental microbes.
