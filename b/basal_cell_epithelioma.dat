40|$|Occurrence of <b>basal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>epithelioma</b> and syringocystadenoma papilliferum on sebaceous nevi is well known. But {{many other}} adnexal tumors, such as pilar or sweat gland tumours {{may also be}} {{associated}} with this dysembryoplasia. Out of 99 cases of verruco-sebaceous nevi we find 12 associated basal cell epitheliomas, 7 syringocystadenomas papilliferum and 6 benign adnexal tumors. Our report is about these 7 cases. All of these tumors appeared in adult-hood and were clinically suggesting the diagnostic of <b>basal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>epithelioma.</b> But, after histopathological examination was performed, they revealed to be 2 nodular hidradenomas, 1 chondroid syringoma, 1 trichilemmoma, 1 apocrine cystadenoma, 1 follicular poroma.

Various forms of organ-limited cutaneous amyloidosis (lichenoid, macular, and nodular amyloidosis, and <b>basal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>epithelioma)</b> and primary systemic amyloidosis were immunohistochemically examined to test the identity between epidermal keratin and skin amyloid. Amyloids in lichenoid and macular amyloidoses, and in <b>basal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>epithelioma</b> had an identical antigenicity with epidermal keratin, whereas amyloids in nodular amyloidosis and systemic amyloidosis did not have this identity. In addition, amyloid in lichen amyloidosis contained disulfide bonds as in keratin. Connective tissue components including filaments of fibroblasts and vascular endothelial cells did not react with this antikeratin antibody.

40|$|The {{activities}} of ornithine decarboxylase and of S-adenosyl-L-methionine decarboxylase in human normal epidermis, in <b>basal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>epitheliomas,</b> and in squamous cell carcinomas of human skin have been compared. All 3 types of tissues have characteristic levels {{of each of}} these enzymes. The normal epidermis had the lowest levels of both ornithine decarboxylase and S-adenosyl-L-methionine decarboxylase activities. The levels of the polyamine biosynthetic decarboxylases in <b>basal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>epitheliomas</b> were significantly higher than those of normal epidermis, {{but at the same time}} significantly lower than those present in squamous cell carcinomas. These results support the conclusion that in epithelial malignant tumors of human skin the extent of the increase in the {{activities of}} polyamine biosynthetic decarboxylases is well correlated with the neoplasm's growth rate, which is faster in the squamous cell carcinomas than in the <b>basal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>epitheliomas...</b>|$|R

40|$|Light and {{electron}} microscopic {{observations were}} made on seventeen palmar or plantar pits of the nevoid <b>basal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>epithelioma</b> syndrome. In two specimens, typical basal cell epitheliomas were seen arising from the epithelium {{at the base of}} the pits; one of them was a pigmented <b>basal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>epithelioma.</b> The epithelium under the pit was stained only weakly with azure B; this was attributed to a very poor development of tonofibrils. Keratohyaline granules were small and the discharge of the cementsomes was incomplete. Premature desquamation of the horny cells took place along the intercellular spaces and was not due to degeneration of horny cells. It was thought that incomplete discharge of cementsomes, perhaps due to shortened transit time of keratinocytes, failed to provide enough intercellular cement.

40|$|The {{expression}} of nPKCμ, a Ca++-independent isoform of protein kinase C in normal human skin, and skin from patients with psoriasis, squamous cell carcinoma, <b>basal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>epithelioma,</b> nevus pigmentosus, and seborrheic keratosis, were examined by immunohistochemical staining using a polyclonal antibody raised against a synthetic peptide at a diverse {{region of the}} nPKCμ molecule. In normal epidermis, the strongest staining was observed in the uppermost granular layer with no staining of the spinous or basal layers. The inner layer of the intra-epidermal eccrine duct was also strongly stained. Weak staining was observed in several layers of the outer root sheath of the follicular infundibulum. No staining was detected in the inner root sheath of the hair follicles, hair matrix, sebaceous gland, eccrine gland, intradermal eccrine duct, arrectores pilorum, melanocytes, Langerhans cells, fibroblasts, or blood vessels. In psoriatic skin, stained keratinocytes were distributed in the suprabasal layers with the most being observed in the uppermost layer and the least in layers closed to the basal layer. In squamous cell carcinoma, weak staining was observed in the keratotic cells around horny pearls. In the <b>basal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>epithelioma</b> and nevus pigmentosus, the cells were not stained, whereas in seborrheic keratosis, cells that stained were located in the granular layer. We conclude from the evidence presented above that nPKCμ is expressed in close association with epidermal differentiation in normal skin and skin diseases...|$|E
40|$|Nodular <b>basal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>epitheliomas</b> (BCE) contain fibro-nectin {{both within}} tumor nodules {{and at the}} nodulestroma {{interface}} (basement membrane zone). Fibronectin within or at the periphery of tumor nodules could be derived from the tumor cells, from entrapped stroma, or from plasma. The present {{study was designed to}} elucidate the source(s) of fibronectin within BCE nodules. If stromal entrapment occurred to any great extent, yon Willebrand factor VIII:Ag-stained blood vessels within tumor nodules should be evident by immunofluorescence techniques. Likewise, if plasma proteins were deposited in BCE, the tumor nodules should stain with fluorescein-conjugated antifibrinogen antibodies. Therefore, 6 <b>basal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>epitheliomas</b> were double labeled with rhodamine-conjugated antihuman fibronectin and fluorescein-conjugated antihuman factor VIII:Ag or fluorescein-labeled antihuman fibrinogen. Fibronectin was present in a linear disposition along the margin of tumor lobules and as a fine filamentous deposit in the central portions of tumor tissue. There was no evidence of fibrinogen or factor VIII:Ag in any of the tumor lobules. Factor VIII:Ag was present in a granular pattern within blood vessel walls that coursed between tumor nests. An indirect immunoperoxidase technique using rabbit antihuman fibronectin and peroxidase-labeled goat antirabbit IgG demonstrated that fibronectin within the central portion of the tumor lobules was closely associated with the tumor cells. The absence of fibrinogen and factor VIII:Ag within the tumor tissue indicates that the fibronectin is probably not plasma- or stroma-derived while immunoperoxidase data suggest that fibronectin may be a product of BCE cells...|$|R
40|$|The {{evidence}} for {{effects of the}} retinoids on UV-induced carcinogenesis is sparse. Clinical observations indicate that topical RA can cause significant regression of pre-malignant actinic keratoses. Also {{there is some evidence}} that this agent can cause dissolution of some <b>basal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>epitheliomas.</b> However this latter effect does not appear to be of therapeutic value. Systemic retinoids are of little value in the treatment of premalignant and malignant cutaneous lesions though 13 -cis-retinoic acid might be of use in the <b>basal</b> <b>cell</b> nevus syndrome. Examination of the influence of the retinoids on photocarcinogenesis essentially has been confined to RA and animal experimentation. RA in nontoxic concentrations can both stimulate and inhibit photocarcinogenesis depending upon the circumstances of the study. The mechanisms of these responses are not clear. Influences on DNA synthesis directly and/or indirectly or on immune responses may be involved in both effects. Preliminary studies with oral 13 -cis-retinoic acid have not demonstrated any effects to date on UV-induced skin cancer formation...|$|R
40|$|Skin {{cancer is}} the most common {{malignancy}} in humans. Clonal chromosome abnormalities have been reported in approximately 100 <b>basal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>epitheliomas</b> (BCC). In contrast to BCC, which has no recognized precursor lesion, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the skin is known to develop through histologic stages, the most important of which are actinic keratosis (squamous cell dysplasia) and carcinoma in situ (severe dysplasia). A wide range of clinically and pathologically different benign and malignant melanocytic tumors are recognized. Appendageal tumors are subdivided into more than 30 benign and malignant subtypes showing apocrine and eccrine differentiation or follicular and sebaceous differentiation. Merkel cell carcinomas have near-diploid karyotypes, often showing rearrangements of chromosome 1.

METHODS [...] Sixteen cases of papilloma, four of dysplasia, four of squamous cell carcinoma, and 12 of <b>basal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>epithelioma</b> were examined using formalin fixed and paraffin embedded samples. Detection of HPV-DNA was performed by PCR-RFLP and in situ hybridisation (ISH) methods. RESULTS [...] HPV- 16 was detected in 12 / 16 papillomas (75 %), 2 / 4 dysplasias (50 %), and 1 / 4 squamous cell carcinomas (25 %) but in none of the basal cell epitheliomas. No other HPV subtypes were found. ISH assay showed positive signals in only two cases of dysplasia and squamous cell carcinoma. The mean age of HPV- 16 positive dysplasia and squamous cell carcinoma cases (81. 7 years) was significantly higher than that of HPV- 16 positive papilloma cases (p < 0. 01). CONCLUSIONS [...] Based on the presence of HPV- 16 in both benign and malignant lesions and the age distribution, it seems likely that HPV- 16 alone may be incapable of causing development of conjunctival and junctional dysplasia and squamous cell carcinoma, and that any correlation between the papilloma-squamous cell carcinoma sequence and HPV infection may be due to rare events...|$|E

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the growth {{characteristics}} of <b>basal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>epitheliomas</b> (BCEs), largely because of the difficulty in studying these tumors, both in situ and in vitro. In this study, the authors report that a scanning electron microscopic examination of 2 cases of superficial BCEs reveals that the tumor proliferates centrifugally as a monolayer beneath the epidermis as well as over the surfaces of hair follicles, while eroding and replacing the original basal architecture. Behind the leading edge of this monolayer, the cells split away from the epidermis to form a round border resembling a carpet being rolled up. This border then develops into a mass lesion, which represents the tumor cell foci seen in routine paraffin sections. These findings have led the authors to propose a fundamentally different explanation for the pathogenesis of these tumors: BCEs are conditioned neoplasms that require contact with the epidermal or hair follicular epithelium in order to grow. This hypothesis could explain the behavior of BCEs as well as the clinical and pathologic varieties observed in clinical practice...|$|R
40|$|This {{article will}} deal {{exclusively}} with cutaneous adnexal tumors. From {{the viewpoint of}} diagnosis of adnexal tumors, embryologic and histologic considerations will be given priority. A good understanding of hair germ structure and normal histology of the hair follicle, which comprises the hair matrix (matrical cells), {{the inner and outer}} root sheaths, isthmus and infundibulum, is a fundamental need in managing follicular diseases. Hair germrelated benign tumors are trichoblastoma and trichoepithelioma, their malignant counterpart being <b>basal</b> <b>cell</b> carcinoma (<b>epithelioma).</b> Calcifying epithelioma is a tumor closely related to the hair matrix (matrical cells) and so has recently been termed "pilomatrixoma". In sebaceous lesions, it is essential to detect sebocytes and the sebaceous duct. In contrast to sebaceous hyperplasias, sebaceous neoplasms always exhibit seboblast proliferation. In sebaceous carcinoma, the sebaceous differentiation is sometimes obscured. A sweat "gland" tumor actually shows sweat "duct" differentiation with a glandular structure consisting of inner cuticular cell and outer poroid cell linings. Poroma is a neoplasm consisting of pores covered by cuticular cells. Its poroid cells proliferate, mimicking normal acrosyringium. Cutaneous mixed tumor, the tumors include differentiation towards a hair follicle, bone, cartilage, fat, etc. In this case, a "mixed tumor" is truly mixed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{spectrum}} of proliferative cutaneous lesions occurred in 12 dogs at the injection site of live canine oral papillomavirus (COP) vaccine, suggesting a viral etiology for the masses. Lesions included epidermal hyperplasia, epidermal cysts, squamous papilloma, <b>basal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>epithelioma,</b> and squamous cell carcinoma. Per-oxidase-antiperoxidase staining of tumor sections revealed nuclei which stained for group-specific papilloma-virus antigen {{in five of}} 12 masses. Electron microscopic examination of tumor sections did not reveal virions. In transmission studies, macerated tumor tissue did not produce oral papillomas on the scarified mucosa of puppies; this procedure did protect the puppies from development of lesions when challenged with infectious papilloma material. These findings are evidence that COP can induce hyperplastic and neoplastic lesions in sites other than oral, pharyngeal, and ocular mucosa.
