It was not until early the following month that the Eighth Army captured Catania. <b>By</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> 1st Parachute Brigade had been withdrawn to Malta and took no further part in the conquest of Sicily. Lessons were learned from the operation and were put into practice in Allied airborne operations.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the 18thcentury {{the copper}} mining {{industry}} of North Wales centred around Parys Mountain declined, and the depression in the British copper market ended. As the price rose, the Cornish mines began to reopen. <b>By</b> <b>this</b> <b>time,</b> <b>the</b> Industrial Revolution had begun, bringing with it new attitudes towards organisation and efficiency. While the mine managers of the 18thcentury generally treated bal maidens as useful only for breaking and sorting ore, the managers of these new mines sought to use all their employees as efficiently as possible.|$|E
5|$|By 1877 it {{was clear}} that the {{situation}} had become impractical. After letters were published in The Field deriding the state of affairs it was decided to unite the kicking game under one set of laws. <b>By</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> FA Cup had helped the FA gain a dominant position within the game. The FA accepted the Sheffield rule allowing throw-ins to be thrown in any direction, as opposed to right angles only as prevails in rugby lineouts. In return the FA's use of a three-man offside was adopted.|$|E
5|$|By mid-summer of 1942, Mt.

The General Electric Company was willing to pay $16,000 for St. Peter's and on July 16, 1942, the church became the property of the General Electric Company.|$|E

Furious was sold in 1948 for scrap, and had been completely broken up in Troon by 1954.|$|E

5|$|<b>By</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> synagogue had around 1,200 member families, {{and over}} 600 {{children}} in its religious school.

One was to have a real ram's horn shofar blown on Rosh Hashanah starting in 1954, rather than the trumpet that had been used for a number of years. Under his leadership a number of members also started having bar mitzvah ceremonies for their children, though this did not become common until the 1970s. By the 1970s he had also added Hebrew classes to the religious school.|$|E

American forces were continually repulsed but able to prevent the North Koreans from breaking the Pusan Perimeter. The division had numbered 14,703 on September 1, but was in excellent position to attack despite its casualties.|$|E

5|$|<b>By</b> <b>this</b> <b>time,</b> <b>the</b> central {{pressure}} of the depression had decreased to 998mbar (hPa; 29.47inHg) and gale-force winds were recorded over a large area, and the system was upgraded to a tropical storm that morning. The system was {{compared to that of}} a Kona low, a large-scale subtropical cyclone that forms near Hawaii. Early on November2, the storm turned northwest in response to an area of high pressure over the central Atlantic. Later that day, the first scientific mission into a hurricane with two planes took place when two research aircraft flew into Greta. During the day, an Air Force B-50 aircraft and NHRP B-47 high altitude jet flew into the storm. The storm executed a counter-clockwise loop, ending on November3, during which time numerous reconnaissance missions were flown into the system. <b>By</b> <b>this</b> <b>time,</b> <b>the</b> storm had also begun a southeastward track.|$|E

5|$|<b>By</b> <b>this</b> <b>time,</b> <b>the</b> fortifications {{had fallen}} into {{disrepair}} because the Swedish command did not {{pay much attention to}} these territories, and funds that were allotted for renovation were insignificant. In addition, the forts at Nöteborg and Nyenskans were considered sufficient to provide defense for the region. In 1702, however, some repairs were completed under the supervision of Captain L.
