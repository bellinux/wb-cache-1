40|$|The {{operating}} life of <b>back-up</b> <b>rolls</b> used in hot rolling mills {{is limited by}} rolling contact fatigue (RCF), and by wear. Bainitic steels are used as they offer the appropriate balance of resistance to RCF and wear. Recently, Frolish et al. have proposed {{a model for the}} RCF of <b>back-up</b> <b>rolls,</b> which includes a microstructural parameter sigma(') (y) root(d) over bar that must be optimised, where sigma(') (y) is the yield stress of the material and (d) over bar is the sheaf width within the bainite. The present work sought to verify the model and thereby optimise the microstructure for this application through testing of bainitic steels {{with a wide range of}} microstructure, generated through changes in composition (a base composition of nominal content 0. 4 % C, 5 % Cr, 0. 85 % Mo was cast, with V contents systematically varied up to 0. 35 %) and heat treatment. RCF testing was undertaken using a maximum Hertzian contact pressure of 1500 MPa. Samples without V exhibited limited crack initiation and no propagation. All V containing samples failed. No effect of prior austenite grain size was found, in line with the model of Frolish et al. A granular bainitic structure promoted extended time to initiation but rapid subsequent crack propagation and failure, while the lower bainitic structures exhibited the reverse (early initiation, but slow propagation). The effect of bainite dimensions on crack behaviour are discussed...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} centres on surface initiated damage on back-up rolls whereby rolling contact fatigue cracks can propagate into the rolls potentially reaching the internal stress fields and leading to catastrophic failure and {{has sought to}} establish design criteria for avoiding such failures. The project objectives have been achieved by examining field evidence, determining the loading and tribological conditions at the work roll/back-up roll interface and investigating both theoretically and experimentally the mechanisms involved in rolling contact fatigue in this case. The presented rolling contact, fatigue and fracture mechanics model includes criteria for crack branching either upwards (i. e. relative safety) or downwards (i. e. potentially catastrophic) and the link between these two cases is related, quantitatively, to {{the properties of the}} roll material.

40|$|The demands {{placed on}} back-up rolls in hot strip mills have been {{investigated}} {{by a combination of}} literature and industrial studies. The tribological operating conditions have been established and the maximum local loads and pressure distributions at the work roll/back-up roll interface have been obtained by processing mill and roll schedule data using a computer program (commercial software developed by V AI Industries (UK) Ltd) and applying the theories of contact mechanics. After a study of the responses of the rolls to these demands and possible failure mechanisms, research has centred on surface initiated damage whereby cracks can propagate into the roll substrate potentially reaching the internal residual stress fields and leading to catastrophic failure. A proposed qualitative contact and fracture mechanics model, for the rolling contact fatigue and spalling failure, has been quantified theoretically using published methods for determining the stress intensity factors at the tips of pressurised and water lubricated, inclined rolling contact fatigue cracks. The predictions of the quantitative model in terms of crack directions and lengths have been validated by microscopic observation of the morphologies cracks produced in test discs used in the "SUROS" Rolling-Sliding Testing Machine and also in a sample of material spalled from a <b>back-up</b> <b>roll.</b> The quantitative failure model includes criteria for crack branching either upwards leading to micro spalling or downwards (potentially catastrophic) and the link between these two cases has been related quantitatively to the value of the mode I threshold for the roll material.

40|$|The rolling-mill <b>back-up</b> <b>rolls</b> {{operate under}} high {{specific}} pressures conditions and are produced of high-carbon steel, prone to {{hot and cold}} cracking. Therefore crack resistance increase is an important scientific and technical problem. The impact of the electrode shape and heat input on the arc motion, and heat affected zone, the size of which determines the cold cracks formation and deposited metal flaking has been found. The arc moves along the electrode end face along the longitudinal axis or perpendicular to the weld pool in dependence on the ribbon position. The arc movement governs the heat input in the pool and if the surfacing regime is constant, the heating and cooling rates of the molten metal and heat affected zone as well. At surfacing with a perpendicular ribbon the heat affected zone decreases; at surfacing with a longitudinal ribbon and wire the heat affected zone increases. At surfacing with a composite electrode the heat affected zone reduces sharply while resistance to cracking and wearing increases. With the heat input reduction in weld pool side edges the heat affected zone reduces as well. At high speed surfacing with low heat input, the heat affected zone reduces, the tendency to cold cracking and deposited metal flaking decrease, welding stresses and specific pressure decrease, what results in resistance to cracking increase {{as well as the}} increase in wearing resistance. When energy decreases the deposited metal quality increases. Energy minimum results in maximum quality.

The lubricationperformance of such newly developed 9 ̆ 6 water-based 9 ̆ 6 synthetic lubricants is compared with currently used mineraloils and emulsions. By using the experimental method of"forward slip" measurements combined with slab methodcalculations and FE- simulations, friction coefficients areevaluated for different single pass reductions. Lubricantsbearing capacity and the product surface roughness are alsoevaluated. The results are encouraging. A synthetic water-based lubricant, used in the cold rollingof an Al- alloy, showed good lubrication capability, betterthan the mineral oil but worse than the emulsion. The rolledAl- strip finish {{was found to be}} finest for the syntheticlubricant followed by the mineral oil and the emulsion. Similarresults were obtained from the steel rolling. Here foursynthetic lubricants were compared with two mineral oils andone emulsion. The best lubricant was found to be one of thewater-based synthetics, showing the lowest value of thefriction coefficient and a smooth product surface. The aim of the wear study is to develop an accurateroll-wear prediction for hot strip finishing mills, which takesmore influential parameters into account. A new model of higheraccuracy is presented. This model is based on a large amount ofproduction campaigns. The strategy of the work is describedbelow. After a comprehensive literature study a promising modelstructure was found. The corresponding equation is tested ontwo hot strip mills. Predicted wear is found to be inqualitative agreement with industrial experience and measuredwear. Thus the structure 9 ̆ 6 taking the influence of back-uprolls into account 9 ̆ 6 was chosen for further development. This was done on behalf of results obtained from one mill builtup by six stands and three different work-roll materials. Campaigns of "mixed" and "similar" strip grades were used.

Contradictory to the currently used on-line model, the newmodel takes the work <b>roll</b> flattening and <b>back-up</b> <b>rolls</b> contactarea into consideration.

Therefore, careful calculation of the process parameters and pass schedules is necessary. The thesis is concerned with two aspects of controlling rolling; the choice of optimal pass schedules and roll wear. A software has been developed in Paper A to determine optimal pass schedules for thermomechanical rolling in order to obtain a fine microstructure. It includes models of the effect of strain, precipitates, static and dynamic recrystallization and austenite grain size on the final grain size. The predicted grain sizes for four different cases were compared with experimental results. It was also used to study the effect of different delay times during the pass schedule of rolling thermomechanical plate. The results shows that an increase in delay times results in finer ferrite grains are received. The refinement is however small for long delay times. Long delay times also affect the productivity negatively. A method for modeling of the work roll contour in a four high mill is presented in Paper B.
