5|$|Fast pace {{of life in}} Viet Nam {{during the}} decades of {{integration}} and development witnesses {{the changes in the}} traditional ao dai.

5|$|While he was <b>becoming</b> <b>more</b> {{frustrated}} with the field at 1UP, game developer Bungie contacted Smith about employment. After sending the company his resume, Smith stopped writing about Bungie and Microsoft to avoid a conflict of interest. Smith accepted a job offer a month later.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{immunology}} was <b>becoming</b> <b>more</b> sophisticated, {{with the}} increasing role of molecular biology and biochemistry. Burnet was suspicious of {{the direction in which}} immunology was headed, and the increasing emphasis on technology and more intricate experiments, and colleagues felt that Burnet's conservative attitude was a factor in his decision to turn the institute's focus to immunology.|$|E
5|$|During 2006, the {{ridership}} increased, and Vildanden started <b>becoming</b> <b>more</b> aggressive against Widerøe, {{which was}} flying to Bergen from Sandefjord Airport. Vildanden {{stated that they}} aimed to outperform Widerøe on price to Bergen. The ATR-42 {{turned out to be}} too large; from 1 July, operations was taken over by the Czech company Air Aurora, with a smaller 30-seater Saab 340. This reduced the monthly leasing costs from NOK700,000 to NOK550,000. DAT remained responsible for the booking system.|$|E

5|$|Every year it is <b>becoming</b> <b>more</b> {{and more}} {{difficult}} for football clubs of any standing to meet their friendly engagements and even arrange friendly matches.

5|$|For the Japanese, {{the loss}} of the Admiralties meant {{the loss of}} their outpost line in the South Eastern Area. Imperial Headquarters now ordered the {{preparation}} of a new line in Western New Guinea. The Admiralties operation also indicated the Allies were <b>becoming</b> <b>more</b> ambitious and might bypass Hansa Bay. Accordingly, the Eighteenth Army in New Guinea was ordered to prepare to defend Aitape and Wewak as well.|$|E
5|$|From a Neo-Darwinian perspective, {{evolution}} {{occurs when}} there are changes in the frequencies of alleles within a population of interbreeding organisms. For example, the allele for black colour in a population of moths <b>becoming</b> <b>more</b> common. Mechanisms {{that can lead to}} changes in allele frequencies include natural selection, genetic drift, genetic hitchhiking, mutation and gene flow.|$|E

5|$|Further east, Ibn Battuta {{traveled}} from Southeast Asia to Khanbaliq (Beijing) in China. Although the Muslim leaders there extended him a warm welcome, they {{advised him to}} leave the city soon. A civil war had caused the Khan to flee the city, and riots were <b>becoming</b> <b>more</b> and more widespread. Meanwhile, T'aigo Wangsa, a Korean Buddhist monk, traveled to China to receive training under the guidance of Buddhist leader Shih-wu. T'aigo later founded the T'aigo sect of Korean Buddhism.|$|E
5|$|Hesketh enjoyed {{looking after}} the Rossall estate (which had no steward or agent), but {{struggled}} to keep on top of finances; he was an indulgent landlord. He became an enthusiastic member of the Lancashire Agricultural Society and {{was concerned about the}} fate of local farm workers who were losing their jobs because of increased mechanisation. Hesketh was gradually <b>becoming</b> <b>more</b> interested in the lives and conditions of the working classes.|$|E
5|$|However, {{adaptation}} {{to climate change}} has been demonstrated in many cases. These are usually due to a shift in coral and zooxanthellae genotypes. These shifts in allele frequency have progressed toward more tolerant types of zooxanthellae. Scientists found that a certain scleractinian zooxanthella is <b>becoming</b> <b>more</b> common where sea temperature is high. Symbionts able to tolerate warmer water seem to photosynthesise more slowly, implying an evolutionary trade-off.|$|E

5|$|In 1932, Stalin {{closed down}} {{independent}} artists' unions; former avant-garde artists had {{to adapt to}} the new climate or risk being officially criticised or even blacklisted. Lissitzky retained his reputation as the master of exhibition art and management into the late 1930s. His tuberculosis gradually reduced his physical abilities, and he was <b>becoming</b> <b>more</b> and more dependent on his wife in actual completion of his work.|$|E
5|$|In 1932twelve {{years after}} the ACLU was foundedit had {{achieved}} significant success; the Supreme Court had embraced the free speech principles espoused by the ACLU, {{and the general public}} was <b>becoming</b> <b>more</b> supportive of civil rights in general. But the Great Depression brought new assaults on civil liberties; the year 1930 saw a large {{increase in the number of}} free speech prosecutions, a doubling of the number of lynchings, and all meetings of unemployed persons were banned in Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|In Asia, {{the species}} {{has been found}} in Japan, Taiwan, Polynesia, Java, and Sri Lanka. In Japan, the fungus is <b>becoming</b> <b>more</b> scarce as its natural habits are decreasing.

5|$|In the United States, the American Kennel Club(AKC) and the Labrador's breed club {{have set}} the breed {{standard}} to accommodate the field-bred Labrador somewhat. For instance, the AKC withers-height standards allow conformation dogs to be slightly taller than the equivalent British standard. However, dual champions, or dogs that excel in both {{the field and the}} show ring, are <b>becoming</b> <b>more</b> unusual.|$|E
5|$|In {{the present}} day, several groups are {{demanding}} that Jamila be given the death sentence. One male guard, (Surya Saputra), takes pity on Jamila and tries to help her. However, Jamila ignores him. Ria, although slowly <b>becoming</b> <b>more</b> sympathetic to Jamila, gets into an argument with her over Nurdin's murder; this results in Jamila being placed in isolation.|$|E
