30|$|Recent {{decades have}} seen an {{increasing}} attitude towards developing biomass power plants responding to worldwide energy crisis and global warming. The use of agricultural waste to produce electricity has several advantages. First, <b>biomass</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> renewable energy with near-zero net CO 2 emissions.

Finally, biomass power plants can be easily integrated with the public grid because their load {{does not depend on}} conditions (unlike wind farms or solar stations). <b>As</b> <b>biomass</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> dispersed resource, local small-scale power plants (less than 25 MWe) are best options to use agricultural waste considering transportation expenses.|$|R
