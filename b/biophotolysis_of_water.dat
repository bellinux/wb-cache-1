30|$|Broadly, {{hydrogen}} production processes via biological means {{can be categorized}} into three types: <b>biophotolysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> using algae and cyanobacteria which is sub-divided into direct and indirect biophotolysis; photofermentation which is actually the photodecomposition of biological compounds utilizing phototrophic bacteria; and fermentation of organic compounds i.e. dark fermentation (utilizing wastes or food crops) [2, 46, 47, 48].|$|E
30|$|Unlike other exoelectrogens, such as G. sulfurreducens, {{in which}} the {{electrons}} are derived from biochemical oxidation of organic compounds via the respiratory electron transfer chain [127], cyanobacterial electrogenic activity does not need exogenous organic fuel and is entirely dependent on the energy of light, which drives the <b>biophotolysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> through the photosynthetic electron transfer chain in the cyanobacteria, releasing electrons [128, 129]. The electrogenic activity of cyanobacteria may represent a form of overflow metabolism to protect cells under high-intensity light [70, 129]. This light-driven electrogenic activity is conserved in diverse genera of cyanobacteria and is an important microbiological channel of solar energy into the biosphere [129].|$|E
40|$|In {{the model}} green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, the {{electrons}} required for hydrogen production {{can come from}} both the <b>biophotolysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> and from the fermentation of carbohydrate reserves. Anoxia leads to the activation of several fermentative pathways, which produce a number of end products including formic, malic and acetic acid along with ethanol, carbon dioxide and hydrogen. It has been proposed that by switching off competing fermentative pathways hydrogen production can be increased. Therefore {{the aim of this}} study was to devise an experimental strategy to down-regulate the expression of enzymes thought to control C. reinhardtii's fermentative metabolism. We demonstrate here that it is possible to use artificial microRNA (amiRNA) technology to generate knock-down mutants with reduced expression of pyruvate formate lyase (PFL 1), a key fermentative enzyme in C. reinhardtii. This work opens up new possibilities to improve hydrogen yields through metabolic engineering. ...|$|E
40|$|Some Microorganisms {{belonging}} to the cyanobakteria (bluegreen algae) are able to convert solar energy directly into hydrogen (H 2). This H 2 -evolution {{is based on the}} watersplitting reaction <b>of</b> photosynthesis (<b>biophotolysis).</b> Practical applications <b>of</b> these systems have been hindered by low solar conversion efficiencies and problems in designing practical systems. New developments in biotechnology and more research on the basic biology of cyanobacterial H 2 -evolution may help to increase conversion efficiencies from about 1 % today to 10 % or more in the future. Considering these technological developments an economic evaluation of the future potential <b>of</b> <b>biophotolysis</b> is presented showing that quite small system improvements are sufficient to reach a competitive position with present and future photovoltic systems...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to clarify the optimum number <b>of</b> <b>watering</b> plants per porous pipe {{from the point of}} the amount <b>of</b> <b>water</b> supply under the sub-irrigation method of using {{negative}} pressure difference.

The problem <b>of</b> <b>water</b> reallocation from downstream to upstream is also considered.

40|$|Present {{energy systems}} are heavily {{dependent}} on fossil fuels. This will eventually lead to the foreseeable depletion of fossil energy resources and, according to some reports, global climate changes due to the emission of carbon dioxide. In principle, hydrogen production by <b>biophotolysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> can be an ideal solar energy conversion system for sustainable development of human activities {{in harmony with the}} global environment. In photosynthetic hydrogen production research, there are currently two main efforts: (1) Direct photoevolution of hydrogen and oxygen by photosynthetic water splitting using the ferredoxin/hydrogenase pathway; (2) Dark hydrogen production by fermentation of organic reserves such as starch that are generated by photosynthesis during the light period. In this chapter, the advantages and challenges of the two approaches for hydrogen production will be discussed, in relation to a new opportunity brought by our recent discovery of a new photosynthetic water-splitting reaction which, potentially, has twice the energy efficiency of conventional watersplitting via the two light reaction Z-scheme of photosynthesis...|$|E

Optimum photoautotrophic growth was measured at a carbon dioxide concentration of 11 %. Photosaturation of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii occurred at 273 W·m- 2 and photoinhibition at 600 W·m- 2. A reactor-independent nutrient control technique was developed by optimising the sulphate and acetate concentrations in the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii growth medium. It enabled a fully grown algal culture to spontaneously achieve anaerobic H 2 production. A maximum H 2 production rate of 1. 52 mlH 2 ·l- 1 ·h- 1 and a H 2 yield of 119. 8 mlH 2 ·l- 1 were measured. The sulphur dilution technique proved effective at encouraging cyclic H 2 production, resulting in alternating Chlamydomonas reinhardtii recovery and H 2 production stages. Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cultures produced H 2 at an average rate as high as 0. 4 mlH 2 ·l- 1 ·h- 1 under a series of consecutive 95 % dilutions. These complementary approaches have demonstrated that engineering advances can lead to improvements in the scalability and affordability of biophotolytic H 2 production, giving increased confidence that H 2 can fulfil its potential as a sustainable fuel of the future.

40|$|This {{report is}} a {{preliminary}} cost {{analysis of the}} <b>biophotolysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> and was prepared {{as part of the}} work of Annex 10 of the IEA Hydrogen agreement. Biophotolysis is the conversion of water and solar energy to hydrogen and oxygen using microalgae. In laboratory experiments at low light intensities, algal photosynthesis and some biophotolysis reactions exhibit highlight conversion efficiencies that could be extrapolated to about 10 % solar efficiencies if photosynthesis were to saturate at full sunlight intensities. The most promising approach to achieving the critical goal of high conversion efficiencies at full sunlight intensities, one that appears within the capabilities of modern biotechnology, is to genetically control the pigment content of algal cells such that the photosynthetic apparatus does not capture more photons than it can utilize. A two-stage indirect biophotolysis system was conceptualized and general design parameters extrapolated. The process comprises open ponds for the CO{sub 2 }fixation stage, an algal concentration step, a dark adaptation and fermentation stage, and a closed tubular photobioreactor in which hydrogen production would take place. A preliminary cost analysis for a 200 hectare (ha) system, including 140 ha of open algal ponds and 14 ha of photobioreactors was carried out. The cost analysis was based on prior studies for algal mass cultures for fuels production and a conceptual analysis of a hypothetical photochemical processes, as well as the assumption that the photobioreactors would cost about $ 100 /m(sup 2). Assuming a very favorable location, with 21 megajoules (MJ) /m{sup 2 } total insolation, and a solar conversion efficiency of 10 % based on CO{sub 2 } fixation in the large algal ponds, an overall cost of $ 10 /gigajoule (GJ) is projected. Of this, almost half is due to the photobioreactors, one fourth to the open pond system, and the remainder to the H{sub 2 } handling and general support systems. It must be cautioned that these are highly preliminary, incomplete, and optimistic estimates. Biophotolysis processes, indirect or direct, clearly require considerable basic and applied R and D before a more detailed evaluation of their potential and plausible economics can be carried out. For example, it is not yet clear which type of algae, green algae, or cyanobacteria, would be preferred in biophotolysis. If lower-cost photobioreactors can be developed, then small-scale (< 1 ha) single-stage biophotolysis processes may become economically feasible. A major basic and applied R and D effort will be required to develop such biophotolysis processes...|$|E
