40|$|In the United Nations ' <b>bonfire</b> <b>test</b> (test 6 c), thermal {{radiation}} measurements {{are used to}} determine the potential radiation hazards from transportation fires involving flammable substances. Currently, packaged substances are assigned to UN division 1. 3 (propellants), if the irradiance from the <b>bonfire</b> <b>test</b> of the product exceeds 4 kw/m 2 at a distance of 15 m from the fire. The irradiance is measured over 5 seconds, during the period of maximum output. For substances, the value is corrected (scaled) to a mass of 100 kg net explosive content. Thermal radiation measurements require complicated instrumentation, and are subject to significant errors introduced by wind, atmospheric attenuation, smoke obscuration, variation in source fire intensity, etc. Experience with UN test 6 c, at the Bureau of Mines, indicates that the irradiance from bonfires involving typical test sample weights (10 to 100 kg) can be calculated to an acceptable degree of accuracy, from simple observations of the total burning time for the involved substance. This paper discusses this simple approach, the current thinking of the UN Group of Experts on thermal flux measurements and criteria, and the impact of substituting burn times for thermal flux measurements on the classification o f substances of interest. ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{the event}} of a fire, the TPRD (Thermally {{activated}} Pressure Relief Device) prevents the highpressure full composite cylinder from bursting by detecting high temperatures and releasing the pressurized gas. The current safety performance of both the vessel and the TPRD is demonstrated by an engulfing <b>bonfire</b> <b>test.</b> However, there is no requirement concerning the effect of the TPRD release, which may produce a hazardous hydrogen flame due to the high flow-rate of the TPRD. It is necessary to understand better the behavior of an unprotected composite cylinder exposed to fire in order to design appropriate protection for it {{and to be able to}} reduce the length of any potential hydrogen flame. For that purpose, a test campaign was performed on a 36 L cylinder with a design pressure of 70 MPa. The time from fire exposure to the bursting of this cylinder (the burst delay) was measured. The influence of the fire type (partial or global) and the influence of the pressure in the cylinder during the exposure were studied. It was found that the TPRD orifice diameter should be significantly reduced compared to current practice...|$|E

40|$|Industrialized {{society is}} linked to the {{transport}} of hazardous materials by road and rail, among other. During transportation, accidents may occur and propagate among the tankers leading to severe fires, explosion or toxic dispersions. This may increase the level of individual and social risk associated to those activities, since the transport network often crosses densely populated area. The escalation of a primary event, in this case the fire, is typically denoted as domino effect, and the triggered secondary events typically are amplified. In the framework of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) transportation, severe fire and explosion hazards are associated to the possible catastrophic rupture of tankers, which may be induced by domino effect of accidental fires. Heat resistant coatings may protected tankers against the fire, reducing the heat load that reaches the tank shell wall and the lading. Indeed, the rupture {{is the result of the}} double effect of thermal weakening of the tank material and the increasing pressure due to LPG evaporation. However, this protection systems are not ideal and undergo defects due to both material degradation and accidental damage. Therefore, protection may be ineffective. The present work is aimed at characterizing the performance of defective coatings. The first part of the work is devoted to the characterization of past accidents occurred in the framework of road and rail transportation of hazardous materials. The ARIA and MHIDAS databases are adopted as data sources, identifying 245 road and 220 rail accidents involving hazardous materials. The analysis highlighted the importance of protecting tank from heat load to avoid the rupture and related severe scenario. For these reasons, in North America the installation of a heat resistant coating is used to protect dangerous good tankers from accidental fire exposure. In Europe, ADR and RID regulations govern transnational transport of hazardous materials by road and by rail, respectively, and still not include any section about thermal protection systems of tankers. Possible concerns related to the installation of these systems is due presence of defects that may be formed accidentally in the fireproofing layer. It is therefore important to establish what level of defect is acceptable in order to avoid the failure of tankers, in the prospective of a wider implementation of tankers fire protections in the European framework. Since large scale <b>bonfire</b> <b>tests</b> are expensive and difficult to be carried out in order to verify the thermal protections adopted, modelling the behaviour of pressurized insulated tankers when exposed to the fire is a possible solution to test the adequateness of defective protections. In order to describe the thermal behaviour of real scale LPG tanks exposed to fire, a lumped model (namely, ‘RADMOD’) and a Finite Elements Model (FEM) are developed. The models are validated against available experimental data and allow predicting the thermal behaviour of tankers with defective coating when exposed to fire, with the aim to assess the thermal protection performance. The phenomena taking place through the vessel in presence of defects are investigated and characterized, in order to reproduce the experimental data on thermal behaviour of defective thermal protection systems exposed to fire. The FEM model allows to determine the wall temperature profile and the stress distribution over the vessel, determining, in the end, a critical defect size that lead to the tank failure, with respect different fire conditions. A sensitivity analysis is performed on the FEM model in order to identify the parameters that mostly affect the heat exchanges of the system. This analysis highlights the main relevance of the flame temperature against other parameters, such as convective heat transfer coefficients and emissivity of flame and steel. The complex analysis performed by FEM model, requires high computational times, which may be prohibitive when a wide number of runs is required. The RADMOD code is a simplified lumped model, which allows to assess the behaviour, among other, of the pressure and the fluid temperature with lower, and thus acceptable, computational time. Another plus of the RADMOD model is that it can be run for a wide range of materials, substances, geometries and fire scenario, estimating a conservative but credible time to failure of the tank. The novel mathematical code for defective thermal protection system is added to the previous version of the RADMOD model, which was implemented for unprotected or completely coated tanks, thus all the phenomena related to the defect enclosure are characterised. In addition, other phenomena, already present in the RADMOD model, are revised to enhance the potentiality of the code. The comparison of results with available experimental data on medium-scale shows that the model proposed in this thesis work can reasonably predict the thermal response. The application of the modelling tool to different geometries is performed considering real-scale defects. Thus, several case-studies were defined in order to reproduce medium- and large-scale tanks varying a few parameters, such as defect size and liquid filling level, for testing the reproducibility of the new model. The results from the case studies highlight the potentiality and the flexibility of the RADMOD code in modelling the thermal response. The ultimate goal would be to apply the data collected from RADMOD code about temperature and pressure of lading, as boundary condition in the FEM model for an improved modelling of thermal behaviour of real-scale LPG tanks in fire scenarios even if there is a defective thermal protection system...|$|R
40|$|The European Community {{requires}} a vehicle-level <b>bonfire</b> <b>test</b> for vehicles using plastic fuel tanks for conventional fuels (ECE R- 34, Annex 5). A similar test {{could be applied}} to hydrogen-fueled vehicles. It would test a realistic vehicle with its complete fuel and safety systems. An advantage of such a test is that the same test could be applied independent of the hydrogen storage technology (compressed gas, liquid, or hydride). There are currently standards for bonfire testing of a bare Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) tank and its Pressure Relief Device (PRD). This standard is FMVSS 304 in the U. S. and ISO 15869 - 1 in Europe. Japan has a similar standard. It requires that a bare tank and its associated PRD be subjected to a propane flame for 20 minutes. The tank must either survive or safely vent its contents. No modern composite wound tank is expected to survive for 20 minutes – so this is not a tank test but really a PRD test. The test procedure requires the PRD to be shielded from direct impingement of the flames – but the shield is not well specified. If it shields the PRD too well, th...|$|E
