He married Minnie Dockterman in 1952 (1912–99). He left three daughters, two; Gro (1932-) and Turid (1938-) by his first wife and one; Karen (1952) by the second wife. In addition he left five grandchildren as well as six great-grandchildren.|$|E
5|$|Phidias, who {{had been}} in charge of all {{building}} projects, was first accused of embezzling gold meant for the statue of Athena and then of impiety, <b>because,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> wrought the battle of the Amazons on the shield of Athena, he carved out a figure that suggested himself as a bald old man, and also inserted a very fine likeness of Pericles fighting with an Amazon.|$|E

The game was close-fought, and decided only by the crucial Countdown conundrum mistletoe which Vorderman solved in two seconds, after Whiteley had inadvertently buzzed after one second, <b>because</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> regularly hosted the show, he hit the button to reveal the conundrum and kept his old habit up.|$|E

25|$|Whatever his origins, Aurelian {{certainly}} {{must have}} built up a very solid reputation for military competence during the tumultuous mid-decades of the century. To be sure, the exploits detailed in the Historia Augusta vita Divi Aureliani, while not always impossible, are not supported by any independent evidence and one at least is demonstrably an invention typical of that author. However, he was probably associated with Gallienus's cavalry army and shone as an officer of that corps d'élite <b>because,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> finally emerged in a historically reliable context {{in the early part}} of the reign of Claudius II, he seems to have been its commander.|$|E
25|$|Simon Bodger (Andy Cunningham) - Simon Bodger is a {{handyman}} {{who has had}} various jobs {{throughout the}} series, probably <b>because</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> is nervous he makes silly mistakes and Badger's antics repeatedly get him sacked. In the first series he {{was working as a}} cook for Troff's Nosherama. He got sacked after Badger accidentally revealed himself to praise Mr Troff for giving Simon the job of chef. In the second and third series he was a caretaker at the (fictional) Letsby Avenue Junior School. This is not far from Troffs' Nosherama, as the Letsby Avenue football team are referenced in the first episode of series one. In the fourth series he was a handyman and zookeeper at Chessington World of Adventures. In the fifth, sixth and seventh series he was seemingly unemployed and renting a flat, occasionally working as a casual handyman to his landlady, Mrs Dribelle. In the eighth and ninth series he was manager of his own Bed and Breakfast while a relative who owned it went on a round-the-world trip. Badger is his anthropomorphic talking pet and best friend, although all the trouble that Bodger ends up in is usually down to Badger. Regular gags usually involve Badger covering Bodger in mashed potato or some other messy substance, either intentionally or accidentally.|$|E
25|$|Prior {{to making}} his Lancashire debut on 17 June 1950, his 20th birthday, Statham had {{received}} no formal coaching. Early {{on in his}} career with the club, he became known as George <b>because</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> arrived {{it was the first time}} in years that there was no one player called George. In his first year, 1950, Statham had relatively little bowling to do because the under-prepared pitches at Old Trafford were so favourable to spinners Roy Tattersall and Malcolm Hilton. Nonetheless, two fine performances against Somerset and Yorkshire and several valuable early wickets in other innings gave him an excellent average even though he only took 36 wickets in the County Championship, which Lancashire shared with Surrey that season. This placed him top of the average amongst bowlers of pace, but at the time he was seen as only a promising newcomer who might strengthen a department in which England had been deplorably weak ever since the resumption of first-class cricket after the Second World War. However, when England were depleted by injuries in Australia, Statham and off-spinner Tattersall were surprisingly called into the team despite no previous representative experience. Though Statham did not achieve anything of note in his initial Test, by the time the 1951 season began he had made a meteoric rise.|$|E
50|$|The Upanishad {{states that}} Rudra is {{resident}} {{in the soul}} in the heart. In chapter 4, the text offers mystical explanations to why Rudra is described the way he is. He is called Om, states the text, <b>because</b> <b>when</b> uttered <b>he</b> makes Prana go upwards. He is called the holy call {{because he is the}} essence of all the Vedas. He is called all prevading because he permeates the silence of the universe. He is called infinite <b>because</b> <b>when</b> uttered there is no end of it in any dimension, states the text.|$|R

500|$|The film took 4½ {{years of}} animating and {{required}} 112,000 frames, {{each of which}} were completed in under 2 minutes and drawn on a Wacom tablet directly into Flash 4, in combination with Moho software. All the frames together were done in a month, by Nibbelink's estimation. The Moho software {{was used for the}} [...] "over-the-shoulder" [...] or the [...] "listening" [...] characters, or crowd scene characters. The film was a half-year in post-production. Nibbelink used Flash 4 <b>because</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> tried to migrate to Flash 5, it created forward-compatibility problems. Even cut-and-paste work using Flash 4 and Flash 5 launched at the same time created RAM issues and crashed.|$|E
500|$|Irataba's {{influence}} {{as a leader}} may even have left its mark on the Mohave language.

By the late 19th century all Mohave speakers had adopted this change. Linguist Leanne Hinton has suggested that this may be due in part to Irataba's influence, both because he was a prestigious leader whose ways of speaking may have been emulated by other Mohave, and also <b>because</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> led the Mohave onto the reservation the old distinctions between dialect groups were erased through dialect leveling, making new changes spread quickly through the community.|$|E

Wherefore he saith, that the Holy Ghost shall convince the world; that he hath a sufficient righteousness, and that because {{he went to the}} Father and they saw him no more (John 16), <b>because</b> <b>he,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> ascended up to the Father, was there entertained, accepted, and embraced of God. That is an excellent word. 'He is chosen of God, and precious.'

500|$|Hosseini {{disclosed}} {{that in some}} ways, A Thousand Splendid Suns was more difficult to write than his first novel, The Kite Runner. This is partly <b>because</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> penned The Kite Runner, [...] "no one was waiting for it." [...] He also found his second novel to be more [...] "ambitious" [...] than the first due to its larger number of characters, its dual focus on Mariam and Laila, and its covering of a multi-generational-period of nearly forty-five-years. However, he stated, [...] "As I began to write, as the story picked up pace and I found myself immersed {{in the world of}} Mariam and Laila, these apprehensions vanished on their own. The developing story captured me and enabled me to tune out the background noise and get on with the business of inhabiting the world I was creating." [...] The characters [...] "took on a life of their own" [...] at this point and [...] "became very real for [...] ".|$|E

He came on, he changed the game, that is what killed the game. Sometimes you talk about Ronaldinho and Eto'o and people like that; {{you need to talk}} about the proper footballer who made the difference, and that was Henrik Larsson tonight." [...] Henry also remarked, [...] "You have to remember that Barcelona is a team. It's not Eto'o, it's not Ronaldinho. On Wednesday, the man who made the difference was Henrik Larsson. You have to give him credit for that <b>because</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> came on he made some amazing runs around the box and he showed he is a team player. You saw two times he fed the ball back to people and that's what I always talk about, he is a team player. He did that against us, even though the first goal was a close offside decision." [...] Larsson's addition giving Barcelona the cutting edge required to overcome Arsenal was noted by international press.|$|E
500|$|When {{the open}} housing {{proposal}} became public, local reaction was often hostile. [...] Such {{was the reaction}} of many residents in Warren, Michigan, a predominately white blue-collar suburb of Detroit. While it had no formal discriminatory laws, most blacks were excluded by zoning practices, refusals to sell to them, and intimidatory actions of white property owners, {{many of whom were}} ethnic Polish and Catholic and had moved to the suburb as part of white flight. By this time, Detroit was 40–50 percent black. [...] HUD made Warren a prime target for Open Communities enforcement and threatened to halt all federal assistance to the town unless it took a series of actions to end racial discrimination there; town officials said progress was being made and that their citizens resented forced integration. [...] Romney rejected this response, partly <b>because</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was governor, Warren residents had thrown rocks and garbage and yelled obscenities for days at a biracial couple who moved into town.

500|$|The {{shooting}} of El-Sherbini's husband Okaz {{by the federal}} police officer, who mistook him for the attacker, was cited by El-Sherbini's brother as indicative of racism in Germany. Following a complaint, a criminal investigation was launched against the police officer who shot Okaz. In October 2009, a criminal investigation for involuntary manslaughter and denial of assistance was launched against the judge {{who presided over the}} July trial, and against the president of the regional court. On 29 December 2009, the public prosecutor's office in Dresden announced that all investigations had been closed on 21 December 2009 without indictment, as no suspicion of a criminal offence could be substantiated. Prosecutors argued that it must have been particularly difficult to assess the situation for the intervening police officer, <b>because</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> entered the room [...] "Elwy Okaz and Alex Wiens were both covered in blood and Elwy Okaz had just managed to grab the handle of the knife with his hand, making it appear as though he was the attacker". There were further assessment difficulties because [...] "the actual attacker—Wiens—was holding the blade of the knife, which added to the impression that he was the one being attacked". The prosecutors' conclusion was that {{shooting of}} Okaz was a tragic mistake. In January 2010, a lawyer acting for El-Sherbini's family filed a complaint against the prosecutors' decisions to close the investigations against the police officer, the judge presiding in the 1 July 2009 trial and the regional court president.|$|E

Downey {{appeared}} as a favor to Marvel Studios, which he acknowledged as a smart move on Marvel's part, <b>because</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was promoting his film he would also have to mention their other production. Hulk co-creator Stan Lee cameos as a man who becomes ill when drinking the soda poisoned by Banner's blood. Michael K.

Paul Soles, who voiced Banner in the 1966 The Marvel Superheroes cartoon, appears as Stanley, a kindly pizza restaurant owner who helps Banner. Additionally, the late Bill Bixby appears, in a scene on his TV comedy-drama The Courtship of Eddie's Father on a television Banner is watching at the beginning of the film. Rickson Gracie has a small role as Bruce Banner's martial arts instructor, despite his Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu background, he is credited as an Aikido instructor.

500|$|Miloš Forman's {{first feature}} film Cerný Petr (Black Peter) was {{released}} in 1964 and was not viewed favorably by Czech governmental authorities until it was selected for competition at that year's Locarno Film Festival, where it won the top prize, thereby gaining the approval of Czechoslovakia's communist bureaucracy and {{making it possible for}} Forman to pursue further projects with relative freedom. Unsure of what the next project should be, Forman recalled an experience he'd had driving around Prague late one evening when he'd encountered a young woman struggling to cross a bridge while carrying a heavy suitcase. [...] He gave her a lift and learned her story: [...] she had come to the big city from Varnsdorf, where she had been seduced by a young engineer, who had given her a phony address in Žižkov and promised to take her away from her dreary life. [...] After confirming that she had been duped, Forman interviewed the girl for {{much of the rest of}} the night, before putting her on a train back to her home town. Commentators have noted that Forman was particularly sensitized to such situations <b>because</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was 10, his mother had been taken away by the Gestapo, never to be seen again, which led to years of Forman traveling around searching for security with nothing but a suitcase. In Forman's words: [...] "I guess I'll always be moved by the sight of a young person with a suitcase seeking a connection in a strange city." ...|$|E

Wrack broke his leg following a challenge by Colin Miles during a 2-1 defeat to Yeovil Town in September 2005. It took him 13 months to return to full fitness, during which time Walsall were relegated. He marked his return to action with a last-minute goal in a 1-1 draw with Swansea City in a Football League Trophy tie on 17 October 2006. However, he pulled his hamstring during a 1-0 win over Hereford United on 18 November, which was only his second league start in a year. New manager Richard Money led the club to the League Two title in the 2006-07 season. Wrack was given a testimonial game against Wolverhampton Wanderers at the Bescot Stadium in April 2008, which attracted only 1,330 supporters. Both Wrack and long-time teammate Ian Roper were released by the club the following month; this was despite Wrack playing 44 games during the 2007-08 season.|$|R
