25|$|After the 2013 general election, {{constitutional}} reform {{remained a}} prominent political topic. However, {{the first real}} breakthrough occurred when Matteo Renzi, the new Secretary of the Democratic Party, was appointed Prime Minister in February 2014. As part of his government's program, Renzi pledged to implement a number of reforms, including {{the abolition of the}} perfectly symmetric <b>bicameralism,</b> with a substantial decrease in the membership and power of the Senate.|$|E
25|$|During {{the tenure}} of Olof Palme, several major reforms in the Swedish {{constitution}} were carried out, such as orchestrating a switch from <b>bicameralism</b> to unicameralism in 1971 and in 1975 replacing the 1809 Instrument of Government (at the time the oldest political constitution in the world after that of the United States) with a new one officially establishing parliamentary democracy rather than de jure monarchic autocracy, abolishing the Cabinet meetings chaired by the King and stripping the monarchy of all formal political powers.|$|E
25|$|The Constitution of India is federal {{in nature}} but unitary in spirit. The common {{features}} of a federation such as written Constitution, supremacy of Constitution, rigidity of Constitution, two government, division of powers, <b>bicameralism</b> and independent judiciary as well as unitary features like single Constitution, single citizenship, integrated judiciary, flexible Constitution, a strong Centre, appointment of state governor by the Centre, All-India Services, Emergency Provisions etc. {{can be seen in}} Indian Constitution. This unique combination makes it quasi-federal in form.|$|E
25|$|After {{the fall}} of the July Monarchy during the February 1848 Revolution, Tocqueville was elected a member of the Constituent Assembly of 1848, where he {{became a member of the}} Commission charged with the {{drafting}} of the new Constitution of the Second Republic (1848–51). He defended <b>bicameralism</b> (the wisdom of two parliamentary chambers) and the election of the President of the Republic by universal suffrage. As the countryside was thought to be more conservative than the labouring population of Paris, universal suffrage was conceived as a means to counteract the revolutionary spirit of Paris.|$|E
25|$|Justice White's dissent {{argued that}} the act should have been upheld. Determining the level of {{spending}} {{by the federal government}} is a legislative function, not an executive one, he argued. Even if the power were executive, White did not see anything wrong with delegating that power to an agent as long as Congress could influence him only by a means that is subject to the Presentment and <b>Bicameralism</b> Clause requirements, which the act satisfied, since the Comptroller General could be influenced by Congress only through a joint resolution.|$|E
25|$|In the 'lower house' {{politicians}} are elected to represent smaller constituencies. The 'upper house' is usually elected to represent {{states in a}} federal system (as in Australia, Germany or the United States) or different voting configuration in a unitary system (as in France). In the UK the upper house is appointed by the government as a house of review. One criticism of bicameral systems with two elected chambers is that {{the upper and lower}} houses may simply mirror one another. The traditional justification of <b>bicameralism</b> is that an upper chamber acts as a house of review. This can minimise arbitrariness and injustice in governmental action.|$|E
25|$|On June 8, 2006, Viet D. Dinh, Professor of Law at Georgetown University Law Center, and Nathan Sales, John M. Olin Fellow at Georgetown University Law Center testified by written {{statement}} before the House Committee on the Budget on the constitutional issues {{in connection with}} the proposed legislation. Dinh and Sales argued that the Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006 satisfies the Constitution’s <b>Bicameralism</b> and Presentment Clause, and therefore avoids the constitutional issues raised in the 1996 Act struck down by the Supreme Court. They also stated that the proposed Act is consistent with the basic principle that grants Congress broad discretion to establish procedures to govern its internal operations.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Metamorphosis" [...] storyline led the {{character}} away {{from many of}} the philosophical concepts previously espoused, but the primary theme of the collection remained anti-statism. New emphasis was placed on previously unexplored themes, including the mind, consciousness and <b>bicameralism.</b> Anarky's characterization was also expanded to present him as an atheist and rationalist. A recurring theme in [...] "Metamorphosis" [...] was a scene of Anarky expounding philosophy to his pet dog, and indirectly to the reader, for a single page in each part of the story, for a total of four pages. These monologues included an explanation of <b>bicameralism,</b> a comparative summary of the political philosophy of Plato and Aristotle, a description of the concept of economic [...] "parasites," [...] and a final description of how the elimination of irrationality would allow society to progress. Another important theme to the final storyline is a discourse on the nature of evil, as a subplot of the story. Anarky's pursuit, as Grant put it, [...] "...is to find out why anyone would make the decision to be evil." [...] To that end, Grant pitted Anarky against Etrigan and Darkseid with the intention of providing a setting for a series of dialogues on the topic.|$|E
500|$|The 1997 Anarky limited series saw {{the earlier}} plot devices of the {{preceding}} [...] "Anarky" [...] storyline become narrative justifications for drastically upgraded skill sets. Anarky's earlier brain augmentation was now described as having [...] "fused" [...] the hemispheres of his brain, in a reference to <b>bicameralism.</b> Meanwhile, the character's business enterprises {{were said to have}} gained him millions of dollars in the dot-com bubble. The character's combat abilities were described as having progressed remarkably, and to have included training in multiple styles which he [...] "integrated" [...] into a hybrid fighting style. [...] Even the character's primary stun baton weapon was enhanced, with a grappling hook incorporated into the walking stick itself to allow dual functionality.|$|E
500|$|While {{there had}} been legislatures with more than two {{chambers}} (tricameral and tetracameral ones), nowadays there are only unicameral and bicameral ones. Additionally, there are also differences {{in the degree of}} <b>bicameralism.</b> Whereas Italy is considered as having [...] "perfect bicameralism", with both chambers being equal, most other bicameral systems restrict the upper house's powers to a certain extent. There is a slight trend towards unicameralism; some upper houses have seen their powers reduced or proposals to that end. Belgium's system has been reduced from a perfectly bicameral one to a nowadays de facto unicameral system. In 2009, Romania voted in favour of unicameralism, on a plebiscite, however the country still has a bicameral system, as of [...] On the other hand, Ireland narrowly voted against abolishing their upper house in 2013, and Italy voted not to reduce its Senate's powers in 2016.|$|E
500|$|Featured as an {{antagonist}} {{in various}} Batman comics during the '90s, stories {{based on the}} character were highly thematic, political, and philosophical in tone. [...] The majority of the collected stories ("Anarky in Gotham City", [...] "Anarky: Tomorrow Belongs to Us", [...] "Anarky") {{are influenced by the}} philosophy of anarchism, while the final story ("Metamorphosis") is influenced by Frank R. Wallace. [...] Although anti-statism is the overarching theme of the collection, other concepts are explored. Anarky's characterization was expanded throughout the stories to present him first as a libertarian socialist and anarchist, and in the final story as a vehicle for explorations into atheism, rationalism, and <b>bicameralism.</b> Literary references are also utilized throughout the collected stories to stress the philosophical foundations of the character. The collection also tracks the character's evolution from a petty, street-crime fighting vigilante, to a competent freedom fighter in opposition to powerful forces of evil.|$|E
500|$|Adams {{advised that}} {{the form of}} {{government}} should be chosen to attain the desired ends – the happiness and virtue of {{the greatest number of}} people. He wrote that, [...] "There is no good government but what is republican. That the only valuable part of the British constitution is so because the very definition of a republic is an empire of laws, and not of men." [...] The treatise also defended <b>bicameralism,</b> for [...] "a single assembly is liable to all the vices, follies and frailties of an individual". He also suggested {{that there should be a}} separation of powers between the executive, the judicial and the legislative branches, and further recommended that if a continental government were to be formed then it [...] "should sacredly be confined" [...] to certain enumerated powers. Thoughts on Government was referenced as an authority in every state-constitution writing hall.|$|E
500|$|The {{limited and}} ongoing series were both heavily {{influenced}} by Neo-Tech, despite the term never appearing in a single issue. New {{emphasis was placed on}} previously unexplored themes, such as the depiction of Anarky as an atheist and a rationalist. Grant also expressed a desire to use the comic as a vehicle for his thoughts concerning the mind and consciousness, and made <b>bicameralism</b> a major theme of both series. While this trend led the character away from the philosophies he had espoused previously, the primary theme of the character remained anti-statism. In one issue of the 1999 series, a character asked what the nature of Anarky's politics were. The response was that Anarky was neither right-wing, nor left-wing, and that he [...] "transcends the political divide". Grant has specified that he categorized Anarky politically as an anarchist who [...] "tried to put anarchist values into action." [...] Norm Breyfogle also stated in 1999 that the character represented anarchist philosophy, but said in 2003 that he believed the Neo-Tech influence allowed Anarky to be classified as an objectivist.|$|E
500|$|Additionally, {{the longer}} terms and {{avoidance}} of popular election turned the Senate into {{a body that}} could [...] "temper" [...] the populism of the House. While the Representatives operated in a two-year direct election cycle, making them frequently accountable to their constituents, the senators could afford to [...] "take a more detached view of issues coming before Congress". State legislatures retained the theoretical right to [...] "instruct" [...] their senators to vote for or against proposals, thus giving the states both direct and indirect representation in the federal government. The Senate [...] {{was part of a}} formal <b>bicameralism,</b> with the members of the Senate and House responsible to completely distinct constituencies; this helped defeat the problem of the federal government being subject to [...] "special interests". Members of the Constitutional Convention considered the Senate to be parallel to the British House of Lords as an 'upper house', containing the [...] "better men" [...] of society, but improved upon as they would be conscientiously chosen by the upper houses of state republican legislatures for fixed terms, and not merely inherited for life as in the British system, subject to a monarch's arbitrary expansion. It was hoped that they would provide abler deliberation and greater stability than the House of Representatives due to the senators' status.|$|E
2500|$|Steven G. Calabresi {{argued that}} {{although}} the Court had denied this, the instant decision was really a [...] "Nondelegation doctrine case masquerading as a <b>bicameralism</b> and presentment case." [...] He also suggested that this decision was [...] "the blockbuster separation of powers case of the Rehnquist years." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{recurring}} {{theme in the}} first volume included four scenes, at one page per issue, in which Anarky expounded philosophy to his pet dog, and indirectly for the reader, including explaining a <b>bicameralism,</b> the difference between Plato and Aristotle, the concept of economic [...] "parasites," [...] and how the elimination of irrationality would allow society to advance. In an interview, Alan Grant explained that in the original script, these monologues were titled [...] "The History of Consciousness part 1 through 4", and that Norm Breyfogle designed the illustrations so that a single quarter of a Circle-A would act as a backdrop to each, which when placed together created a complete poster image. This theme was not utilized in the second volume, but story narration continued to allude to these concepts. <b>Bicameralism</b> and philosophy of the mind remained a topic of concern to Grant while writing the series, which Grant hoped could act {{as a vehicle for}} his thoughts on the origin of consciousness. The comparison between Plato and Aristotle had been used in two earlier stories which featured Anarky, although at the time the character was described as an anarchist.|$|E
2500|$|Mythopoeic {{thought is}} a {{hypothetical}} stage of human thought preceding modern thought, proposed by Henri Frankfort {{and his wife}} Henriette Antonia Frankfort in the 1940s. According to this proposal, there was a [...] "mythopoeic" [...] stage, in which humanity did not {{think in terms of}} generalizations and impersonal laws: instead, humans saw each event as an act of will {{on the part of some}} personal being. This way of thinking supposedly explains the ancients' tendency to create myths, which portray events as acts of gods and spirits. A physiological motivation for this was suggested by Julian Jaynes in 1976 in the form of <b>bicameralism.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Pogor the {{politician}} was drawn into secretive, then conspiratorial, work. Pogor in Iași, and Carp in Bucharest, {{helped organize the}} February 1866 putsch against the authoritarian Cuza, and supported the interim government presided upon by both liberal [...] "Reds" [...] and conservative [...] "Whites". On February 15, the Romanian Regency appointed Pogor Prefect of Iași County, {{and he was also}} a regional representative in the Assembly of Deputies (quickly elected for the drafting of a new constitution). On April 28, he was elected as one of its secretaries. For most of the year, he had a noted role in persuading his colleagues to accept <b>bicameralism,</b> and thus contributed to the establishment of the Senate of Romania. In March, he was also sent back to the appellate court, as section president, serving until January 1868. According to scholar George Călinescu, he also began supplementing his revenue with [...] "multiple and ephemeral" [...] special commissions, including that of teacher certification examiner (October 1866).|$|E

50|$|Under Soviet regime {{regional}} and local Soviets were unicameral. After the adoption of 1993 Russian Constitution <b>bicameralism</b> was introduced in some regions. Bicameral regional legislatures are still technically allowed by federal law but this clause is dormant now. The last region to switch from <b>bicameralism</b> to unicameralism was Sverdlovsk Oblast in 2012.|$|E

5000|$|A [...] "Julian Jaynes Society" [...] {{was founded}} by {{supporters}} of <b>bicameralism</b> in 1997, shortly after Jaynes' death. The society published {{a collection of essays}} on <b>bicameralism</b> in 2007, with contributors including psychological anthropologist Brian J. McVeigh, psychologists John Limber and Scott Greer, clinical psychologist John Hamilton, philosophers Jan Sleutels and David Stove, and sinologist Michael Carr (see shi [...] "personator"). The book also contains an extensive biography of Julian Jaynes by historian of psychology William Woodward and June Tower, and a Foreword by neuroscientist Michael Persinger.|$|E
50|$|The Supreme Court {{also found}} the {{legislative}} veto unconstitutional in Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919 (1983), as violating the Presentment Clause and <b>bicameralism.</b>|$|E

50|$|In literature, the 1992 novel Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson {{involves}} {{an attempt to}} return humans to their bicameral, pre-conscious state. It contains some of the illustrations used in Jaynes' book. Stephenson's first novel, The Big U, also contains references to <b>bicameralism</b> as an explanation for cult-like behavior {{among some of the}} titular university's students and teachers. The 2005 novel Human Traces by Sebastian Faulks also contains themes of <b>bicameralism.</b> The Rage of Achilles, a 2009 novel by Terence Hawkins, recounts The Iliad in terms of the transition from bicameral to modern consciousness.|$|E
50|$|Unlike upper {{houses in}} most Westminster {{parliamentary}} systems, the Australian Senate is vested with significant power, including {{the capacity to}} block legislation initiated {{by the government in}} the House of Representatives, making it a distinctive hybrid of British Westminster <b>bicameralism</b> and US-style <b>bicameralism.</b> As a result of proportional representation, the chamber features a multitude of parties vying for power. The governing party or coalition, which has to maintain the confidence of the lower house, rarely has a majority in the Senate and usually needs to negotiate with other parties and Independents to get legislation passed.|$|E
5000|$|Enactment {{of primary}} {{legislation}} often requires a concurrent majority - {{the approval of}} a majority of members in each of the chambers of the legislature. When this is the case, the legislature may be called an example of perfect <b>bicameralism.</b> However, in many Westminster system parliaments, the house to which the executive is responsible can overrule the other house and may be regarded as an example of imperfect <b>bicameralism.</b> Some legislatures lie in between these two positions, with one house only able to overrule the other under certain circumstances.|$|E
