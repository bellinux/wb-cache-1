500|$|In late April 2011, Grace Potter {{from the}} American rock band Grace Potter and the Nocturnals sang a rootsy {{acoustic}} rendition of [...] "Why Don't You Love Me" [...] along with strategic handclaps and drummer Matthew Burr's backbeat. Potter said that choosing to cover [...] "Why Don't You Love Me" [...] was easy {{because she is}} [...] "big-voiced". She elaborated: [...] "As I was watching the video, I was watching for the visual candy. Then I slowly began {{falling in love with}} the song." [...] Jessica Letkemann of Billboard magazine complimented the cover, writing: [...] " [...] may usually rock with a 60s feel while Texas-born Beyoncé is a queen of R, <b>but</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> the two women undoubtedly have in common is an amazing set of pipes." ...|$|E
500|$|The team's {{games are}} {{regularly}} broadcast live on HRT. Shortly after becoming manager, Slaven Bilić and his rock band released a single, [...] "Vatreno Ludilo" [...] (Fiery Madness), which recalled the team's progress during the 1998 World Cup and praised their present ambitions. The song {{reached the top}} position on the Croatian music charts and was widely played during Euro 2008. Other Croatian artists such as Dino Dvornik, Connect, Prljavo Kazalište and Baruni have recorded songs {{in support of the}} team, among which are [...] "Malo nas je al nas ima" [...] (We are few, but we exist), [...] "Samo je jedno" [...] (There is <b>but</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> [...] ), [...] "Moj dom je Hrvatska" [...] (My Home is Croatia), [...] "Srce vatreno" [...] (Fiery Heart), and [...] "Hrvatska je prvak svijeta" [...] (Croatia are World Champions).|$|E
500|$|Copland {{acknowledged}} that the acoustics at the premiere were [...] "shrill." [...] While Philharmonic Hall was being renovated in 1976 {{in an attempt to}} improve its sound, Harold C. Schonberg wrote, [...] "For all we know, Connotations is a masterpiece. <b>But</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> is certain—it did not make many friends for Lincoln Center in 1962." [...] While admitting the work was [...] "written in Copland's austere, objective, abstract style," [...] he suggested that bad acoustics might have also played a part in the work's failure at the premiere. The orchestra that night had been augmented by a large chorus to perform the first movement of Gustav Mahler's Eighth Symphony, which pushed the orchestra forward, [...] "out of its normal playing position... The sound was bad, bad. The bass response was sorely deficient, the hall was plagued with echoes, the musicians on stage reported that they could not hear each other very well (just great for ensemble) and in general Philharmonic Hall sounded like a cheap hi-fi set with the bass speakers out of the circuit.|$|E

500|$|In {{the present}} day, Mr. Gold (Carlyle) repossesses florist Moe French's (Keenleyside) van {{the day before}} Valentine's Day. At Granny's Cafe, David (Josh Dallas) and Mary Margaret (Ginnifer Goodwin) talk from {{separate}} tables, until Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) interrupts to ask about Henry (Jared S. Gilmore). Ashley (Jessy Schram) arrives with her baby, noting how rarely she gets a babysitter or sees her boyfriend, Sean (Tim Phillipps). Ruby (Meghan Ory) suggests a girl's night out. Emma investigates a robbery of Mr. Gold's home, who says he knows that Moe is responsible, seeking revenge for the repossession. Emma recovers the majority of Mr. Gold's items <b>but</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> is missing and he will stop at nothing until it is recovered. He kidnaps Moe, ties him up and beats him, demanding where it is. However, he soon starts saying [...] "she's gone," [...] referring to Belle, until Emma arrives to stop him. Mr. Gold believes Regina (Parrilla) put Moe up to the theft and she knows where the last stolen item is. Emma still has to arrest Mr. Gold for kidnapping and assault.|$|E
500|$|The band toured {{nationally in}} July 2010 {{to support the}} album, while its lead single, the title track, had {{appeared}} in May and charted in the Top30 on the ARIA Singles Chart. The second single, [...] "Tommy and Krista", was released in September, which peaked at No.10 in New Zealand. Another single, [...] "All My Life", was featured in the promotional clips for the 2010 AFL grand final. Its music video was directed by Adrian Van de Velde and was shot in early October in Bangkok, Thailand. The narrative is a 'heroic love' set on a local military base and features Russian model-actress Maria Mazikova, together with 50 Thai army troops, an Iroquois helicopter, and a Chinook helicopter. In November Lip Magazines Shannon Andreucci reviewed a live gig, [...] " [...] are certainly no Pixies, Beatles or Sex Pistols. They're not breaking any rules or boundaries in the revolutionary world of rock music. In fact they are perfectly happy and capable of playing within the parameters of radio friendly and commercially safe pop rock. <b>But</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> is for sure; they {{go the extra mile}} in giving a charmingly refined and hearty live performance and that in itself should be commended".|$|E
500|$|Another {{possible}} lover was Bill Duckett. As a teenager, {{he lived}} on the same street in Camden and moved in with Whitman, living with him {{a number of years}} and serving him in various roles. Duckett was 15 when Whitman bought his house at 328 Mickle Street. From at least 1880, Duckett and his grandmother, Lydia Watson, were boarders, subletting space from another family at 334 Mickle Street. Because of this proximity, it is obvious that Duckett and Whitman met as neighbors. Their relationship was close, with the youth sharing Whitman's money when he had it. Whitman described their friendship as [...] "thick". Though some biographers describe him as a boarder, others identify him as a lover. Their photograph [...] is described as [...] "modeled on the conventions of a marriage portrait", part of a series of portraits of the poet with his young male friends, and encrypting male–male desire. Yet another intense relationship of Whitman with a young man was the one with Harry Stafford, with whose family Whitman stayed when at Timber Creek, and whom he first met when Stafford was 18, in 1876. Whitman gave Stafford a ring, which was returned and re-given {{over the course of a}} stormy relationship lasting several years. Of that ring, Stafford wrote to Whitman, [...] "You know when you put it on there was <b>but</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> to part it from me, and that was death." ...|$|E

500|$|... {{the film}} had {{a rating of}} 29% on review {{aggregator}} website Rotten Tomatoes. Vincent Canby of The New York Times noted that Madonna, left to her own devices and her own canny pace, is a very engaging comedian. [...] "When Madonna's no-nonsense pragmatism isn't being twisted into poses of lovable eccentricity, the actress is sexy and funny and never for a minute sentimental. At times she looks amazingly like Marilyn Monroe, but the personality is her own, more resilient and more knowing. As the WASP-y sleeping prince, Mr. Dunne gives the most stylishly comic performance of a career that's been largely underrated by the public. Though {{he seems to be}} Madonna's foil, he provides the movie with its backbone, even in its most ludicrous moments. He may well {{be one of the most}} truly sophisticated straight men in the business today." [...] However, he ended the review by saying that the film was short on outright guffaws. Hal Hinson of The Washington Post gave the film a mixed review, commenting that [...] "you may not feel as if you've seen a movie. You may not quite know what you've seen" [...] and that although he laughed too much, the film [...] "is outrageously inept, but not in a routine manner". Hinson also criticized the work of Foley, noting that he [...] "doesn't have the skill to sustain a cartoon style." [...] Philip Wuntch of The Dallas Morning News commented that the film is a deft and daffy comedy performance; Madonna is great with the one-liners. [...] As a movie star, Madonna may be an acquired taste. <b>But</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> is certain: acquiring this particular taste is going to be an enjoyable experience." [...] Jay Boyar of the Orlando Sentinel gave a negative review saying, [...] "Luckily for her, Madonna can sing, and use it to save herself from this disgrace of a movie." ...|$|E

[...] Once that has been accepted, everything else Canadian follows." [...] Pierre Trudeau largely agreed, saying that [...] "To a Canadian, the only virtue is loyalty; the only sin, disobedience." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{source of}} Ariel's name and {{character}} is debated among scholars {{but it is}} most commonly surmised as coming from the Greek story of Prospero and his servant Ariel.

Scholars have compared him to sprites depicted in other Elizabethan plays, and have managed to find several similarities between them, <b>but</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> which makes Ariel unique is the human edge and personality given him by Shakespeare.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike the {{founding}} farther of criminology, Cesare Lombroso, {{who thought that}} crime was fundamentally biological in its origin and criminals lacked free will altogether, contemporary neurocriminologists seem to take the middle ground approach. They do not argue that biological factors alone cause behavioral problems, but recognize that behavior results from interaction between biology and environment. Some authors, however, are more determinist in their views. As one author writes: [...] "Free will may exist (it may simply be beyond our current science), <b>but</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> seems clear: if free will does exist, it has little room in which to operate. It can at best be a small factor riding on top of vast neural networks shaped by genes and environment. In fact, free will may end up being so small that we eventually think about bad decision-making {{in the same way}} we think about any physical process, such as diabetes or lung disease." ...|$|E

2500|$|Intermèdes {{became part}} of a new genre, the comédie-ballet, in 1661, when Molière {{described}} them as [...] "ornaments which have been mixed with the comedy" [...] in his preface to Les Fâcheux. [...] "Also, to avoid breaking the thread of the piece by these interludes, it was deemed advisable to weave the ballet in the best manner one could into the subject, and make <b>but</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> of it and the play." [...] The music for the premiere of Les Fâcheux was composed by Pierre Beauchamps, but Lully later provided a sung courante for Act I, scene 3. With Le Mariage forcé and La Princesse d’Élide (1664), intermèdes by Lully began to appear regularly in Molière's plays: for those performances there were six intermèdes, two at the beginning and two at the end, and one between each of the three acts. Lully's intermèdes reached their apogee in 1670–1671, with the elaborate incidental music he composed for Le Bourgeois gentilhomme and Psyché. After his break with Molière, Lully turned to opera; but he collaborated with Jean Racine for a fete at Sceaux in 1685, and with Campistron for an entertainment at Anet in 1686.|$|E
2500|$|With Trilogy now on iTunes and in-stores, The Weeknd {{turned to}} his fifth {{official}} video, one of his three new releases from his debut, [...] "Twenty Eight". Dropped on 13 February 2013 and directed by up-and-coming visionary Nabil Elderkin (some may notice similarities to Frank Ocean's [...] "Pyramids" [...] video which he also directed). Simren Bolaria of music blog Earmilk, describes the video, [...] "A long way from his former faceless, anti-media Internet persona, a distracted Abel Tesfaye sits down for a grey and dreary television interview with a foreign journalist while a haunting hologram girl sits in bed watching from her own television set. He's under surveillance—the crew is watching, hologram girl is watching, and the reporter is talking at him, so he dips into mental absence. The Weeknd continues to slip back into his alternate stripper world where the lights are flashing, the strippers don't get tired, the décor is decadent, and he can do the watching himself, with a camcorder in hand, of course. The line between what's real and what's imagined is blurred, <b>but</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> is clear—this video is definitely NSFW." ...|$|E
2500|$|I was {{not more}} than {{thirteen}} years old, when in my loneliness and destitution I longed for some one to whom I could go, as to a father and protector. The preaching of a white Methodist minister, named Hanson, was the means of causing me to feel that in God I had such a friend. He thought that all men, great and small, bond and free, were sinners {{in the sight of}} God: that they were by nature rebels against His government; and that they must repent of their sins, and be reconciled to God through Christ. I cannot say that I had a very distinct notion of what was required of me, <b>but</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> I did know well: I was wretched and had no means of making myself otherwise.I consulted a good old colored man named Charles Lawson, and in tones of holy affection he told me to pray, and to [...] "cast all my care upon God." [...] This I sought to do; and though for weeks I was a poor, broken-hearted mourner, traveling through doubts and fears, I finally found my burden lightened, and my heart relieved. I loved all mankind, slaveholders not excepted, though I abhorred slavery more than ever. I saw the world in a new light, and my great concern was to have everybody converted. My desire to learn increased, and especially, did I want a thorough acquaintance with the contents of the Bible.|$|E
