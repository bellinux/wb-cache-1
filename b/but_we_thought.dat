500|$|We'd {{just got}} {{ourselves}} a sampler, {{and we went}} sample-crazy. We just ... went through my whole collection of records, sampling tons of stuff and putting it all together, and it ... was a real rush of excitement, when we were doing it.... When we put that record out, we knew {{what we were doing}} was illegal, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> it was gonna be such an underground record, nobody would ever hear about it. So the first thing that shocked us is that British rock papers gave a big review.|$|E
500|$|After Marker saw Manson's group Angelfish on 120 Minutes, {{the band}} {{invited her to}} Vig and Marker's Smart Studios to sing {{on a couple of}} songs, but after a [...] "dreadful" [...] first audition, she {{returned}} to Angelfish. Manson eventually returned to Smart for a successful second time, where she began to work on the then-skeletal [...] "Queer", [...] "Vow" [...] and [...] "Stupid Girl". Working on the lyrics, [...] "Stupid Girl" [...] became an [...] "anthem for a girl who won't settle for less than what she wants". Later she added, [...] " [...] really about squandering potential, [...] our version of Madonna's 'Express Yourself', but a little more subversive". Manson aimed the song as a rebuke towards a friend's foolish behaviour: [...] "A lot of females still find it difficult to find their own voice in society. It's just that women have a different set of problems from men... make the most of your potential." [...] Manson added that [...] "Stupid Girl" [...] was [...] "a song of reproach {{to a lot of people}} we know", both male and female, and that [...] "we could have called it 'Stupid Guy,' <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> another song about a strident female dissing a guy would be tedious." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the album}} was {{completed}} in August 1981, its release was delayed {{for a whole year}} until the group felt ready to release it. Gartside defended the decision to hold back the album, saying that [...] "we could have released it then, and it would probably have got some nice reviews, sold a few thousand copies and disappeared. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> that if we held on to it, put out 'The [...] "Sweetest Girl"', built on that a bit, took some more singles off the album, built up the interest and then put it out, it would do a lot more. Seeing as we were really pleased with it, I would much rather that happened." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{told him}} of the fire, and said {{that it might not}} be much, <b>but</b> that <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> we'd better waken him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why,' said Felix, looking down, 'our {{little ones}} {{all wanted to}} have you; <b>but</b> then <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> should all be obliged to come home too soon, unless you took the service for Papa.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, no!' exclaimed his sons; 'that {{you shall}} never do. Rather, if it must be, {{would we do}} it ourselves. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> have <b>thought</b> of a better plan than that.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Initially, Raimi invited Scott Spiegel to co-write Army of Darkness {{because he}} had {{done a good job}} on Evil Dead II, but he was busy on rewrites for the Clint Eastwood film The Rookie. After the good {{experience}} of writing the screenplay for a film called Easy Wheels, Sam and his brother Ivan decided to co-write the film together. They worked on the script throughout the pre-production and production of Darkman. After filming Darkman, they took the script out and worked on it in more detail. Raimi says that Ivan [...] "has a good sense of character" [...] and that he brought more comedy into the script. Campbell remembers, [...] "We all decided, 'Get him out of the cabin.' There were earlier drafts where part three still took place there, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought,</b> 'Well, we all know that cabin, it's time to move on.' The three of us decided to keep it in 1300, because it's more interesting". Campbell and Tapert would read the script drafts, give Raimi their notes and he would decide which suggestions to keep and which ones to discard.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the evening}} of Sunday, 26 November, two days after he had {{convinced}} the nurses {{to remain on the}} job, Margaret was startled to hear her husband's voice sound heavily congested. [...] He told her that he had a [...] "terrible flu". [...] The next morning, he and Sister Maria agreed that he had malaria. [...] "We said malaria, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> Ebola," [...] she later said. [...] His fever grew worse through the day, a Monday, and by Wednesday was vomiting and Dr. Pierre Rollin of the CDC took blood samples for testing. [...] A nurse who was administering an intravenous drip that evening at his home was surprised when he began speaking distinctly, though not to her: [...] "Oh, God, I think I will die in my service. [...] If I die, let me be the last." [...] Then, in a clear voice, he sang [...] "Onward, Christian Soldiers". Rollin came back with the results the next morning; it was Ebola. [...] Lukwiya immediately asked to be put into the isolation ward, stating [...] "Since I am the boss, I should show an example." ...|$|E
2500|$|We weren't {{trying not}} {{to put out a}} record. It was just one thing after another and time flew by. When you don't do your band like a career like us, you've got other things to do than worry about getting records made. If you don't put a {{deadline}} on it, it may never get done. Like us, you turn around and it's been six years. The first year or two after the last record, we were still touring and not thinking about making an album. Then, in the third year, we were busy and it took a few months to write and get in the studio. There's lag time at the label and then it's winter... It just goes on and on. When NOFX asked us if we wanted to go on the road with them, {{we thought it would be}} fun, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> it would be better if we had the record finished. We hadn't planned on being done in October. It was for later in the year, so we had to kick it in high gear and get into the studio. Everything worked backwards from there 'cause if we had fucked it up, we'd be looking at 2009 before the album was done. That deadline really got it all together, but it was only a matter of a few weeks. We'd planned to go into the studio three weeks after we actually did. We'd have only rehearsed with the luxury time, so we were ready. Most of [...] the last 12 months, so it's a new record, not stuff we were sitting on and hadn't recorded. It's also not like we were writing these songs for the last six years. Once we were ready, it came together surprisingly quickly, and I think people will be kind of shocked but happy with the results.|$|E
6000|$|... "They are {{waving their}} handkerchiefs!" [...] Betsy exclaimed; [...] "it is them, sure enough. Well, we have {{wondered}} {{how they would}} come down, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> never <b>thought</b> of a barge." ...|$|R
5000|$|Kozowyk {{explained}} the album title: [...] "It's from the Discovery Channel show How It's Made. They {{were talking about}} this machine they feed zippers through, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> just <b>thought</b> the name was creepy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We did {{not expect}} to come to this so soon, Guy," [...] he said. [...] "We have often talked about fighting, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> never <b>thought</b> that our first serious fight would end like this." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> it well to {{set down}} our {{interview}} {{as a guide to}} others.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is too bad, señors, {{that this}} {{should not have been}} done while you were away, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> of nothing but your danger." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Absolutely none," [...] {{said the}} Waters, [...] "in the earth {{or in the}} waters under the earth. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> {{turbines}} didn't appeal to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Only {{a little}} sprain," [...] replied Hanson. [...] "He can ride all right; <b>but</b> <b>we</b> both <b>thought</b> he'd better lie up tonight, and rest, for he'll have plenty hard {{riding in the}} next few weeks." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{never want}} to let {{anything}} pass, out West. Because next time you'll get worse. This turn your other cheek doesn't go in Arizona. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> shore <b>thought</b> Ruff said worse than that. Though from him that's aplenty." ...|$|R
60|$|Her nerves being {{none of the}} strongest, Priscilla hardly {{recovered}} her equanimity {{during the}} rest of the evening. This, to be sure, was a great pity; <b>but,</b> nevertheless, <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> it a very bright idea of Zenobia's to bring her legend to so effective a conclusion.|$|R
6000|$|... "And I don't {{know that}} we shall. The house is much too big for us; <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> we'd better take it," [...] he added, {{as if it were}} a castle for vastness.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Savor stood up. [...] "I'm much {{obliged to}} you, Miss Kilburn; <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> we hadn't better wait, well {{not a great}} while, and--the funeral was this afternoon. Well, I wish you good evening." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, Mallett, {{there you}} are. You {{are the last}} in; the others all turned up by the evening train, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> that as you were {{comparatively}} near you would come on by the mail." ...|$|E
60|$|Neither of us {{spoke of}} the boat, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> both <b>thought</b> of it. That was made {{apparent}} by our avoidance of the subject, and by our agreeing--without agreement--to make my recovery {{of the use of}} my hands a question of so many hours, not of so many weeks.|$|R
60|$|Oh, how delightful! <b>but</b> I <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> {{were going}} home; {{and the things}} are all packed up.|$|R
60|$|We three {{practical}} men {{burst out}} laughing. We {{had known that}} our colleague was queer, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> never had <b>thought</b> {{that he would be}} as queer as this.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you, Jock, I'm so glad," [...] said Babie, {{referring}} {{probably to}} the earlier part of his speech. [...] "We would have come home for the pony carriage, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> it would be out." ...|$|E
60|$|As {{to friends}} and acquaintance, I am afraid we showed {{a great deal of}} pride and stiffness. They were kinder than we deserved, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> it prying and patronage, and would not accept what we could not return.|$|E
60|$|We had {{determined}} to accept of three oxen from the chief, and to ride these when we felt fatigued; <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> {{it best to}} let our native porters carry our baggage on their shoulders, as they had hitherto done.|$|E
60|$|Fifty {{times a day}} {{we asked}} {{ourselves}} and asked each other from what possible quarter this peril was to be expected, <b>but</b> the more <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> of it the more hopeless did any solution appear.|$|R
60|$|And--it {{is so hard}} now {{to convey}} these things--he spoke to me, a stranger, without reservations, carelessly, as men now speak to men. Before those days, not only did <b>we</b> think badly, <b>but</b> what <b>we</b> <b>thought,</b> a {{thousand}} short-sighted considerations, dignity, objective discipline, discretion, a hundred kindred aspects of shabbiness of soul, made us muffle before we told it to our fellow-men.|$|R
2500|$|Valentino {{dismissed}} {{this notion}} in a 2008 interview with Goldmine magazine. [...] "That's a total myth", he said. [...] "We just needed a name, and that sounded good. We didn't {{even know how}} to spell it. Everybody now has a notion of what people were thinking back then, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> never <b>thought</b> of those kinds of things." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> {{you wanted}} us to be more serious than we were about {{addressing}} letters properly. This is the larger-sized morality, the real No. 11 sort, and you don't like it, though you said you expected it of us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{there is}} another thing, Dave," [...] Zeke put in; [...] "we must have a watch. We had {{intended}} that, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> we should have only one place to watch; now we have found this track up the hill we have two." ...|$|E

500|$|Starting Halloween 1986, Peterson offered {{visitors}} free cardboard masks {{with his}} face on it. All 5,000 went in a single year. In 1987, Peterson said, [...] "We thought about doing a better mask, with a more realistic Tom Peterson on it. <b>But</b> then <b>we</b> <b>thought,</b> what if somebody robs a bank wearing one, and the witnesses say, 'It was Tom Peterson!'
