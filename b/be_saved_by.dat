5|$|The {{previous}} Causeway {{had carried}} electric trams, {{and it was}} expected that the new Causeway would also carry trams, or perhaps trolleybuses instead. However, the proposed overhead wires were deemed too ugly for the new bridge, and between £30,000 and £40,000 could <b>be</b> <b>saved</b> <b>by</b> using buses instead. The routes using the Causeway were replaced with bus services, but the bridges as constructed were nonetheless designed to be able to carry trams.|$|E
5|$|The {{design process}} {{involves}} trading-off different factors, including colour, contrast and overall disruptive effect. A failure {{to consider all}} elements of pattern design tends to result in poor results. The US Army's Universal Camouflage Pattern (UCP), for example, adopted after limited testing in 2003–4, performed poorly because of low pattern contrast ("isoluminance"—beyond very close range, the design looks like a field of solid light grey, failing to disrupt an object's outlines) and arbitrary colour selection, neither of which could <b>be</b> <b>saved</b> <b>by</b> quantizing (digitizing) the pattern geometry. The design was replaced from 2015 with Operational Camouflage Pattern, a non-pixellated pattern.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, Mulder {{encounters}} a delusional man, Gary Lambert (Brian Markinson), who believes his boss, Greg Pincus (John Apicella), may be a monster—and decides to take an entire office building, including Mulder, hostage to prove it. Lambert is eventually killed, but somehow, Mulder inherits his ability to see Pincus as a monster. After Mulder claims that Pincus is a monster, he is locked in a psychiatric hospital, only to <b>be</b> <b>saved</b> <b>by</b> Scully: {{the only person who}} believes him.|$|E

50|$|Week 5's Saturday {{show was}} the 3rd Expulsion Night {{and in this}} episode, out of the 4 {{probationary}} contestants (Rosita, Chai, Yvan and Geoff), Geoff was the expelled student.

5|$|In November, the Board {{agreed to}} a {{compromise}} design that incorporated a secondary battery of eight 8in guns in four twin turrets amidships and twelve 7in guns in casemates. The decision to retain the 8in guns was made in large part due to American experiences in the Spanish–American War three years before. US Navy officers had been impressed {{with the performance of}} the gun at the Battle of Santiago de Cuba; despite scoring only 13 hits out of 309 shells fired, the gun had a flat trajectory and good range for its size. Armor protection was improved over the BuOrd design, with a thicker armored belt and casemate protection, albeit at the expense of thinner armor covering the barbettes that supported the gun turrets. The designers reasoned that since the barbettes were behind the belt and a transverse bulkhead, weight could <b>be</b> <b>saved</b> <b>by</b> reducing the level of direct protection.|$|E
5|$|On July 2008 British Airways {{announced}} a merger plan with Iberia, another flag carrier airline in the Oneworld alliance, wherein each airline would retain its original brand. The agreement was confirmed in April 2010, and in July the European Commission and US Department of Transport permitted the merger {{and began to}} co-ordinate transatlantic routes with American Airlines. On 6 October 2010 the alliance between British Airways, American Airlines and Iberia formally began operations. The alliance generates an estimated £230million in annual cost-saving for BA, {{in addition to the}} £330million which would <b>be</b> <b>saved</b> <b>by</b> the merger with Iberia. This merger was finalised on 21 January 2011, resulting in the International Airlines Group (IAG), the world's third-largest airline in terms of annual revenue and the second-largest airline group in Europe. Prior to merging, British Airways owned a 13.5% stake in Iberia, and thus received ownership of 55% of the combined International Airlines Group; Iberia's other shareholders received the remaining 45%. As a part of the merger, British Airways ceased trading independently on the London Stock Exchange after 23 years as a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins with}} Luigi having won a mansion in a contest. Despite not having entered any contest, he {{promptly}} told Mario about the mansion, {{and the two}} agreed to meet up outside it that evening. Luigi takes a flashlight {{with him and he}} follows the map to the mansion. Upon finally arriving at his new mansion, which looks much more sinister than the supplied photo, Mario is nowhere to be found. Luigi proceeds inside the mansion, entering the Parlor after he gains the key from a strange ghost-like shape. Upon entry, he is soon assaulted by a Gold Ghost, only to <b>be</b> <b>saved</b> <b>by</b> a little old man wielding a vacuum cleaner. The old man, however, is unable to reel in the ghost and is soon overpowered. After being helped to his feet by Luigi, the old man introduces himself as Professor Elvin Gadd. The two retreat from the mansion when more of the Gold Ghosts appear.|$|E

5|$|When {{they face}} Orphan, despite the party's pleas for Fang to not {{transform}} into Ragnarok, Fang eventually transforms into an incomplete version and fights the fal'Cie alone, but gets tortured {{as a result}} of her failure, only to <b>be</b> <b>saved</b> <b>by</b> Lightning's group. After Orphan's destruction, Fang and Vanille complete their Focus by becoming Ragnarok to save Cocoon from crashing into Gran Pulse. In Final Fantasy XIII-2, Fang and Vanille appear to help Serah escape from the endless dream in the Void Beyond that Caius placed her in, and at the end they are rescued from Cocoon's pillar when it finally collapse. By the events of Lightning Returns, after awakening and seeing Vanille being used by the Order, Fang has taken up residence in the Dead Dunes and becomes the leader of a bandit group bent on thwarting the Order from obtaining a relic within the desert. She attempts to destroy the relic so Vanille can be saved from being killed by the ritual. Fang appears on the final day, helping Lightning dissuade Vanille from going through with the ritual and helps her guide the souls of the dead to the new world.|$|E
5|$|By 1957, the DRR was {{becoming}} overwhelmed by ever-increasing crowds; Disney {{determined that a}} third train was needed. Instead of having another locomotive built from scratch to pull the train, Disney believed that costs could <b>be</b> <b>saved</b> <b>by</b> purchasing and restoring an already-existing narrow-gauge steam locomotive, and the job of finding one was given to Roger Broggie. With the assistance of Gerald Best, a suitable locomotive was found in Louisiana; it had been built by Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1894, had previously {{been used as a}} switcher at a sugar cane mill in Louisiana owned by the Godchaux Sugar Company, and was initially used by the Lafourche, Raceland & Longport Railway in Louisiana. After its purchase, the locomotive was delivered to the Walt Disney Studios' machine shop where restoration work began, which included installing a new boiler built by Dixon Boiler Works and having its firebox reconfigured to burn diesel oil for fuel to generate steam. This locomotive became the DRR's No. 3 locomotive and it went into service on March 28, 1958, at a cost after restoration of more than $37,000. Joining the No. 3 locomotive when it went into service were five new open-air Narragansett-style excursion cars with front-facing bench seating collectively referred to by Disneyland employees as the Excursion Train, which was designed by Bob Gurr and built at Walt Disney Studios.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, Kenny and Mikey {{returned}} to WWE on the October 4 episode of SmackDown and attacked former Spirit Squad member Dolph Ziggler, formerly Nicky, under {{the order of}} the Intercontinental Champion The Miz and Maryse, but both were fought off by Ziggler. On October 9, at No Mercy, they tried to distract Ziggler in a title vs career match against Miz under Maryse's command, but were banned from the ringside along with her. Ziggler defeated Miz, ending Miz's reign at 188 days. The two appeared again on the October 11 episode of SmackDown and wrestled Ziggler in a Handicap match in a losing effort, afterward the two and Miz tried to attack Ziggler after the match only for him to <b>be</b> <b>saved</b> <b>by</b> Heath Slater and Rhyno. On the October 18 episode of Smackdown Kenny and Mikey teamed up with the Miz to face Dolph Ziggler, Heath Slater and Rhyno in a six-man tag team match which the Spirit Squad and Miz won. The next week, Kenny and Mikey were awarded a match against Heath Slater and Rhyno for their WWE SmackDown Tag Team Championship but were defeated. They would continue to wrestle as a tag team until mid-November before returning to the independent circuit.|$|E
50|$|Early in {{the match}} Kilmarnock defender Mahamadou Sissoko's pass across the penalty area was intercepted by Gary Hooper. However, his shot <b>was</b> <b>saved</b> <b>by</b> goalkeeper Cammy Bell who came off his line quickly. Shortly after Dean Shiels shot {{narrowly}} wide {{from the edge}} of the area. Around 30 minutes in Scott Brown made room for himself on the right before crossing for Anthony Stokes whose header <b>was</b> <b>saved</b> <b>by</b> Bell. Shiels had another chance but his shot <b>was</b> <b>saved</b> <b>by</b> Fraser Forster. From the resulting corner Sissoko's header was cleared off the line by Stokes. Bell made another save when he tipped Brown's powerful shot from outside the box over the bar. Paul Heffernan was then played in on the right-hand side of the box but his shot <b>was</b> <b>saved</b> <b>by</b> Forster.|$|R

It was not an easy game, as Peter Beardsley had found the net 10 minutes before Sanchez scored, only to have his goal disallowed.
