5|$|The Dnestr/Dnepr radars were {{intended}} to <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> newer Daryal radars starting in the 1990s. Only two of the planned Daryal radars became operational, due to {{issues such as the}} dissolution of the Soviet Union. As of 2012, the Russian early warning network still consists of some radars of this vintage. It is likely that all the existing radars will <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> third generation Voronezh radars by 2020.|$|E

The Dneprs in Mishelevka, Irkutsk will close once the second array of the new Voronezh radar is operational. The Dnepr at Olenegorsk, Murmansk {{will be replaced by}} a Voronezh as well. It is planned to start construction there in 2017.|$|E

50|$|In early 1994, the Red, Blue and White routes {{from the}} Frederick City Transit were discontinued. <b>The</b> Red Route <b>was</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> #50, <b>the</b> Blue Route <b>was</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> #40 and <b>the</b> White Route <b>was</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> #60.|$|R
5|$|Battery: Shorter {{than the}} DS Lite, {{regardless}} of brightness setting; for example, the DSi has a battery life of 9–14 {{hours on the}} lowest brightness setting, compared to the 15–19 hours of the DS Lite on the same setting. The battery is an 840mAh internal rechargeable, compared to 1000mAh for the DS Lite, and has an optimal lifespan of approximately 500 cycles; after this point, it may <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> user.|$|E
5|$|Ferguson {{remained}} in charge through {{the remainder of}} the 1985–86 season and into their World Cup campaign, which saw them eliminated in the group stage, gaining only a single point, before stepping {{down at the end of}} June 1986, to <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> SFA's Director of Coaching Andy Roxburgh. Ferguson's record saw him in charge for a total of ten games, of which five were competitive games and five (including the 1986 Rous Cup match) were friendlies. Of those, the team won three, lost three and drew four.|$|E
5|$|On 29 October 1968, {{work was}} {{stopped on the}} {{physical}} SPOS barrier, by that time redesignated as Duel Blade, under MACV Planning Directive 10–67, citing changes in the overall force posture, both enemy and friendly. The physical barrier would <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> revised Duel Blade plan of active resistance utilizing air strikes, artillery and naval bombardment and mobile reaction forces. Base sites already constructed or under construction were {{to be used as}} support bases for the revised operation plan.|$|E

5|$|Phase two {{was broken}} into four {{separate}} sections, phase 2.1 {{is for a}} radar upgrade, phase 2.2 incorporated a link 16 secure data link, Multi-function Information Distribution System (MIDS), Cockpit full colour displays (MDGU), Counter Measures Dispenser System (CMDS), Joint Helmet Mounted Cuing System (JHMCS), Tactical Air Moving Map Capability (TAMMAC), and the 19C Operational Flight Program. Phase 2.3 added the Electronic Warfare suite upgrade (Radar Warning Receiver, Radio Frequency Jammer) and phase 2.4 upgraded with the Target Designation System (HTDS). The following support systems will also be either upgraded or replaced, the Operational Flight Trainer (OFT) to <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Hornet Aircrew Training System (HACTS), the Integrated Avionics Software Support Facility (IASSF), the Mission Planning System (MPS), Miscellaneous Support Equipment (SE), Computer Based Training System (CBTS), Simulated Aircraft Maintenance Training System (SAMTS) to <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Integrated Maintenance Training System (IMTS).|$|E
5|$|The 21 {{remaining}} Sea Kings are tasked to {{a variety}} of roles including SAR, transport, disaster relief, tactical land–sea transport, evacuation, surveillance, reconnaissance and naval support. The main base is Nordholz, although units are always stationed at Heligoland Airport and Warnemünde, and sometimes at Borkum Airfield. The helicopters are scheduled to <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> NH-90.|$|E
5|$|The AV-8B is to <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> F-35B {{version of}} the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II, which was planned to enter service in 2012. The USMC had sought a {{replacement}} since the 1980s, and has argued strongly {{in favor of the}} development of the F-35B. The Harrier's performance in Iraq, including its ability to use forward operating bases, reinforced the need for a V/STOL aircraft in the USMC arsenal.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> VT320 <b>was</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> VT420 in 1990, but the VT340 {{remained}} in production {{until all of}} these models <b>were</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> VT500 series in 1994.|$|R

2500|$|In 1955, ADC {{implemented}} Project Arrow, {{which was}} designed to bring back on the active list the fighter units which had compiled memorable records in the two world wars.

5|$|British Railways {{undertook}} a massive programme to establish itself by repainting all its locomotives {{with their new}} BR numbers and replacing their previous corporate identity with its own. Gone were the tenders proclaiming the railway companies' logos, emblems and even coats of arms, to <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> stark 'BRITISH RAILWAYS' lettering. The enormity of this task meant that the necessary repainting was not necessarily carried out to coincide with an overall repaint. For the Coronation Class, all locomotives had been through this process {{by the end of}} 1948 except for Nos. 6223, 6238, 6248, 6250, and 6252–6255, a total of 29 locomotives. Only thirteen locomotives out of the 29 received new liveries to accompany their renumbering.|$|E
5|$|In Cuvier's {{landmark}} 1796 {{paper on}} living and fossil elephants, {{he referred to}} a single catastrophe that destroyed life to <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> current forms. As {{a result of his}} studies of extinct mammals, he realized that animals such as Palaeotherium had lived before the time of the mammoths, which led him to write in terms of multiple geological catastrophes that had wiped out a series of successive faunas. By 1830, a scientific consensus had formed around his ideas as a result of paleobotany and the dinosaur and marine reptile discoveries in Britain. In Great Britain, where natural theology was very influential in the early 19th century, a group of geologists that included Buckland, and Robert Jameson insisted on explicitly linking the most recent of Cuvier's catastrophes to the biblical flood. Catastrophism had a religious overtone in Britain that was absent elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|In October 1963, London Transport ordered five {{double decker}} buses {{based on the}} Ford Thames Trader chassis for special duties, taking cyclists through the Dartford Tunnel. These had a lower deck {{purpose-built}} for carrying bicycles, with upper deck seats for cyclists. Access was via a stairwell to the upper deck starting several feet above {{the level of the}} road, accessible from special platforms built {{at either end of the}} tunnel; there was also a ladder built into the side of the bodywork for access elsewhere. The design was criticised for failing to protect any passenger from falling off the vehicle, and running costs were estimated at £2,550 per month, with only £45 revenue. The service was reduced to one bus in April 1964 and then cancelled in 1965, to <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> current transfer service. One of these buses has been preserved.|$|E
5|$|In his State of the Union Address on 23 January 2007, President Bush {{announced}} plans to deploy more than 20,000 additional soldiers and Marines to Iraq in {{what became known as}} the Surge. Four thousand were specifically earmarked for Anbar, which Bush acknowledged had become both an AQI haven and a center of resistance against AQI. Instead of deploying new units, the Marine Corps chose to extend the deployments of several units already in Anbar: 1st Battalion 6th Marines, 3rd Battalion 4th Marines, and the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU). The 15th MEU would later <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> 13th MEU as the last surge unit.|$|E
5|$|Madagascar has {{historically}} been perceived as being on the margin of mainstream African affairs despite being {{a founding member of}} the Organisation of African Unity, which was established in 1963 and dissolved in 2002 to <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> African Union. Madagascar was not permitted to attend the first African Union summit because of a dispute over the results of the 2001 presidential election, but rejoined the African Union in July 2003 after a 14-month hiatus. Madagascar was again suspended by the African Union in March 2009 following the unconstitutional transfer of executive power to Rajoelina. Madagascar is a member of the International Criminal Court with a Bilateral Immunity Agreement of protection for the United States military. Eleven countries have established embassies in Madagascar, including France, the United Kingdom, the United States, China and India.|$|E

5|$|Maxim Gorky {{tested the}} first Soviet naval helicopter, the Kamov Ka-10 in December 1950 and began her refit in mid-1953. This was planned {{to include a}} {{complete}} overhaul of her machinery while her radar, fire-control systems and anti-aircraft guns were to <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> latest Soviet systems. Torpedo bulges were to be fitted which would increase her displacement by , with consequent penalties to her speed and range. The navy re-evaluated {{the scope of the}} work in 1955 and deemed it insufficient to create a fully modern ship and suspended the refit. Maxim Gorky was sold for scrapping on 18 April 1959 after the navy had decided that she wasn't needed as a missile-test ship.|$|E
5|$|Oslo Sporveier {{opted for}} the all-new MX3000 from Siemens as a {{replacement}} for the T1000 stock instead of the T2000. Although its design was found to be unsuitable, the T2000 was initially not planned to <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> MX3000, as the line was to remain with overhead wires and none of the new MX3000 trains are equipped with pantographs. However, following Oslo's decision to host the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2011, it was decided to upgrade the Holmenkollen Line to full metro standard, allowing longer than two-car trains. A proposal to downgrade the line to light rail standard and make it part of the Oslo Tramway was rejected.|$|E
5|$|Ramsay {{retreats to}} Winterfell, {{followed}} by Jon, Wun Wun and Tormund. Wun Wun breaks down Winterfell's gates and the Stark loyalists overwhelm {{the remnants of}} the Bolton garrison. A mortally wounded Wun Wun is finished off by Ramsay, who tells Jon that he has reconsidered the offer of single combat. Jon blocks Ramsay's arrows with a shield, overpowers and attempts to beat Ramsay to death, stopping when he sees Sansa and ordering him imprisoned, leaving Winterfell once more in the hands of House Stark. Bolton banners are shown falling off the walls and battlements of Winterfell to <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Stark direwolf. Sansa visits Ramsay after he is placed in the kennels with his hounds and despite Ramsay's insistence that his hounds will not turn on him, they devour him face-first as Sansa walks away, smiling.|$|E
