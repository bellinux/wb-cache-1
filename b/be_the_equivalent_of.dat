5|$|During 1992 and 1993, an {{estimated}} 225,000 Croats, {{as well as}} refugees from Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia, settled in Croatia. Croatian volunteers and some conscripted soldiers participated {{in the war in}} Bosnia and Herzegovina. In September 1992, Croatia had accepted 335,985 refugees from Bosnia and Herzegovina, most of whom were Bosniak civilians (excluding men of drafting age). The large number of refugees significantly strained the Croatian economy and infrastructure. The American Ambassador to Croatia, Peter Galbraith, tried to put the number of Muslim refugees in Croatia into a proper perspective in an interview on 8 November 1993. He said the situation would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>of</b> the United States taking in 30,000,000 refugees.|$|E

5|$|In 1883 Hardwicke Rawnsley was {{appointed}} vicar of Crosthwaite. In {{a study of}} Lake District towns in 1974, H A L Rice commented that to write about Keswick without mentioning Rawnsley would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>of</b> writing about Stratford-upon-Avon without mentioning Shakespeare, so great was Rawnsley's impact on the town. He and his wife set up classes to teach metalwork and wood carving; these grew into the Keswick School of Industrial Art, which trained local craftsmen and -women from 1894 until it closed in 1986. He revived the ancient May Day festival in the town, and was a leading figure {{in the establishment of}} Keswick School, Blencathra Sanatorium and the County Farm School. As co-founder of the National Trust, Rawnsley contributed to Keswick's continued growth as a tourist centre, with the acquisition by the Trust of many acres of popular scenic land around Derwentwater, beginning with Brandelhow Wood in 1902.|$|E
5|$|Very {{little is}} known of Byrne's early life beyond {{the fact that he}} was born in Ireland in 1806. His first fight, in 1825, was a loss to Mike Larking; it lasted 138 rounds spread over two and a half hours—despite the fact that at this time a round could vary in length, and usually only ended when a man was knocked down. His second fight was a draw against Jack Manning in 1826, earning Byrne £100. Next was Byrne's first match against the Scottish boxer Alexander McKay, which Byrne won easily in five rounds, earning him a further £100. This match was McKay's first ever prize-fight. This victory was soon {{followed}} by a win against Bob Avery, earning a further £50, then another win over Phil Samson in 1829, earning him £200. By the standards of the day these latter sums were enormous; it is therefore surprising that he was then offered £200 for a rematch, regardless of whether he won or not, against the less experienced McKay, whom he had beaten so easily on the first occasion. As of 2008 that would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>of</b> about £13,600.|$|E
5|$|Evans {{frequently}} quarrelled {{with fellow}} inventors and engineering peers over steam {{technology in the}} mid-1800s. His increasing frustration led to his premature publication {{of what he had}} hoped would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>of</b> his earlier manual for millers—the petulantly titled The Abortion of the Young Steam Engineer's Guide. The Steam Engineer's Guide was significantly shorter than this first book and less structured in its approach. A third of the book is devoted to an ongoing argument between Evans and John Stevens (another prominent steam engineer of the day), much of which had previously appeared in the journal The Medical Repository and to which now Evans added various additional criticisms of Stevens' contentions. Evans concludes his book by renouncing inventing and any further work on his designs, complaining of the ingratitude of the public and the unprofitability of the endeavour, although this would prove to be just one of many such assertions by Evans over the coming years. Regardless, the Steam Engineer's Guide proved to be a popular work, though not on the same scale as his guide to milling, however it was the first book in the United States to make accessible to anyone ideas and techniques for steam engineering.|$|E

25|$|Retail water tariffs vary between {{municipalities}} {{and between}} user categories, with non-residential users being charged higher tariffs than residential users. Typically water tariffs also vary with consumption, with higher tariffs applied to higher consumption.

25|$|The {{most famous}} case setting forth the {{parameters}} of this requirement is Muskrat v.

At a consumption of 20 cubic meter per month and household this corresponds to US$ 0.025 per cubic meter, or about 15 times less than the average tariff in urban areas. Needless to say, the revenues generated are insufficient for the operation and maintenance of the systems.|$|E

25|$|Lee {{has several}} superhuman abilities, {{including}} immense physical strength, {{the ability to}} leap large distances, and to project some type of mystical energy from her body, often from her eyes. Her invulnerability is tied to her level of concentration, and she can be harmed if extremely fatigued or distracted. She has also stated {{that she has a}} superhuman sense of direction. Since being cast down, she cannot touch Earth's soil, and so floats just above the ground when barefoot. Because of the nature of time in Bete Noire, Lee, who was not born in the city, ages more slowly than Bete Noire native-borns, but has yet experienced some aging {{between the first and second}} volumes of the series because she spends half her time outside the city. When in the city, she physically appears to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>of</b> a twenty-five-year-old human woman, but outside the city, appears to be a woman in her late 40's.|$|E
25|$|Masters and Johnson argue that, {{despite some}} minor differences, sexual {{responses}} in {{both men and}} women are fundamentally similar. However, researchers have argued that there are many {{differences between men and women}} in terms of their response. First, Masters and Johnson put forth one model for men, but three different models for women. They stated that men's sexual response only differs in terms of duration; showing different models would, thus, be repetitive. Women, on the other hand, they state can have responses that differ in both intensity and duration. These variations can pose problems because psychologists have argued that not everyone fits this model; for example, most women do not orgasm during penetrative sexual intercourse. Masters and Johnson also equate a man's erection with a woman's vaginal lubrication during the excitement phase; Roy Levin states that this observation is false. A woman's clitoris is the anatomical parallel to a man's penis. As a result, clitoral swelling would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>of</b> a man's erection.|$|E
25|$|To give {{an idea of}} {{the scale}} of the problem, {{assuming}} a solar panel mass of 20kg per kilowatt (without considering the mass of the supporting structure, antenna, or any significant mass reduction of any focusing mirrors) a 4 GW power station would weigh about 80,000 metric tons, all of which would, in current circumstances, be launched from the Earth. Very lightweight designs could likely achieve 1kg/kW, meaning 4,000 metric tons for the solar panels for the same 4 GW capacity station. This would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>of</b> between 40 and 150 heavy-lift launch vehicle (HLLV) launches to send the material to low earth orbit, where it would likely be converted into subassembly solar arrays, which then could use high-efficiency ion-engine style rockets to (slowly) reach GEO (Geostationary orbit). With an estimated serial launch cost for shuttle-based HLLVs of $500 million to $800 million, and launch costs for alternative HLLVs at $78 million, total launch costs would range between $11 billion (low cost HLLV, low weight panels) and $320 billion ('expensive' HLLV, heavier panels). To these costs must be added the environmental impact of heavy space launch emissions, if such costs are to be used in comparison to earth-based energy production. For comparison, the direct cost of a new coal or nuclear power plant ranges from $3 billion to $6 billion per GW (not including the full cost to the environment from CO2 emissions or storage of spent nuclear fuel, respectively); another example is the Apollo missions to the Moon cost a grand total of $24 billion (1970s' dollars), taking inflation into account, would cost $140 billion today, more expensive than the construction of the International Space Station.|$|E
