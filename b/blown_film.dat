The ionic aggregates of Zn-EMAA are spherical, monodisperse and uniformly-distributed in as-extruded pellets and <b>blown</b> <b>films</b> prepared at low and high blow-up ratio. Thus, although the biaxial stresses of <b>film</b> <b>blowing</b> are sufficient to alter the PE superstructure, the ionic aggregates in Zn-EMAA are unaffected. In contrast, the morphology of Na-EMAA as detected by STEM changes from featureless in the as-extruded pellets to a heterogeneous distribution of Na-rich aggregates in the <b>blown</b> <b>films.</b> This transformation in Na-EMAA morphology is consistent with our earlier study of quiescent annealing suggesting that the morphological change is the result of thermal processing rather than the biaxial stresses of <b>film</b> <b>blowing...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{fabrication}} of <b>blown</b> <b>films</b> {{is a complex}} industrial process that has received some attention in the past from both industry and academia with the intention to establish detailed property-structure-processing linkages between polymers and their resulting <b>blown</b> <b>films.</b> Unfortunately, {{a clear understanding of}} the molecular level architectural variables, which control important properties of <b>blown</b> <b>films</b> such as resistance to tear and the resistance to puncture, are not fully developed. The current work uses powerful synchrotron based in situ X-ray scattering techniques to explore the morphologies of <b>blown</b> <b>films</b> as well as morphological evolution under uniaxial strain, for a series of polyethylenes whose architectures are well understood. Firstly, a number of protocols based on traditional analyses of X-ray scattering are developed which aid in the quantification of both the crystalline and non crystalline phases of the overall semicrystalline morphology of films. The analysis protocols developed allow the parametrization of dimensionality and orientation for both these phases at atomistic and mesoscopic length scales. Secondly, empirical relationships are established between the pertinent extracted parameters and molecular architectures of the polyethylenes under investigation. This enables the elucidation of those aspects of the molecular architecture of polyethylene the targeted manipulation of which is likely to result in the attainment of desired tear and puncture properties in <b>blown</b> <b>films.</b> Thirdly, quantitative relationships relating the dimensional and orientational parameters to the tear and puncture resistance properties are developed to determine the origin of these properties. Complementing the central theme of this dissertation are studies on the modeling of semicrystalline microstructures and the theoretical simulations of X-ray scattering from the same. Supplementing the analyses protocols developed from the traditional understanding of scattering phenomena are statistical analyses of scattering based on concepts borrowed from the realm of big-data analytics.

The study mainly {{focused on the}} relationships between orientation of amorphous PS and semi-crystalline PE and their shrinkage, tensile properties and tear resistance. For low orientations, {{it was found that}} the stress and strain (shrinkage in films) can be simply related to birefringence for both PS and PE. For tear properties of PE films, better correlations were observed with crystalline orientation factors.

50|$|Traditional {{plastic bags}} are usually made from polyethylene, which {{consists}} of long chains of ethylene monomers. Ethylene is derived from natural gas and petroleum. The polyethylene used in most plastic shopping bags is either low-density (resin identification code 4) or, more often, high-density (resin identification code 2).

50|$|As {{the film}} is drawn upwards, it is cooled by a ring of air blowers so that the melt first becomes an {{amorphous}} viscoelastic solid, and then a semicrystalline solid, at {{what is known as}} the frost line. After solidification, the <b>blown</b> <b>film</b> tube continues to be cooled as it is pulled up by several sets of rollers, deflating the film to form lay-flat tubing. The flat film is then wound on a spool before further processing or shipping. The height of the film line is often 10 times the diameter of the blown tube or more; film lines in excess of 30 meters are possible.|$|E
50|$|The product {{must now}} be cooled and this is usually {{achieved}} by pulling the extrudate through a water bath. Plastics are very good thermal insulators and are therefore difficult to cool quickly. Compared to steel, plastic conducts its heat away 2,000 times more slowly. In a tube or pipe extrusion line, a sealed water bath is acted upon by a carefully controlled vacuum to keep the newly formed and still molten tube or pipe from collapsing. For products such as plastic sheeting, the cooling is achieved by pulling {{through a set of}} cooling rolls. For films and very thin sheeting, air cooling can be effective as an initial cooling stage, as in <b>blown</b> <b>film</b> extrusion.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} develop {{correlations}} between the properties and microstructural characteristics of polyethylene <b>blown</b> <b>films,</b> three polymers were evaluated in this study: low density polyethylene (LDPE), {{linear low density polyethylene}} (LLDPE) and high density polyethylene (HDPE). Series of <b>blown</b> <b>films</b> were produced at different process conditions. Morphological characteristics of the films were analyzed using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), FTIR, and birefrigence measurements. Herman's orientation factors of the films were determined via both wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) pole figures and infrared dichroism. Differential scanning calorimetry and WAXD were used to determine the degree of crystallinity and crystal dimensions. Finally, key mechanical properties including Elmendorf tear, dart impact, tensile properties in both MD and TD and optical properties such as haze and clarity have been measured. By using the statistical design of experiments and multivariate modeling, these properties are correlated to the microstructural parameters including the degree of crystallinity, lamellar thickness, Herman's orientation factors, and roughness.

50|$|COC is {{commonly}} extruded with cast or <b>blown</b> <b>film</b> {{equipment in the}} manufacture of packaging films. Most often, due to cost, COC is used as a modifier in monolayer or multilayer film to provide properties not delivered by base resins such as polyethylene. Grades of COC based on ethylene show a certain amount of compatibility with polyethylene and can be blended with PE via commercial dry blending equipment. These films are then used in consumer applications including food and healthcare packaging. Key COC enhancements can include thermoformability, shrink, deadfold, easy tear, enhanced stiffness, heat resistance and higher moisture barrier. Common applications include shrink films and labels, twist films, protective or bubble packaging, and forming films. Another noted application which often relies on a high percentage of COC in the end product is pharmaceutical blister packaging.|$|E

50|$|Dr. Lehman, the {{director}} of the youth village, conceived of the idea of making a film to represent the village when he first came to Mandatory Palestine. As early as 1926, Yaakov Ben Dov produced a short film on the first days of Ben Shemen. The success of that film was a main factor in providing incentive for the production of a full blown movie during the 1930s. Practically the film began production only after World War II. Lehman believed that assistance given to needy children in Mandatory Palestine would lead the way to the integration of refugee children who were arriving from Europe with the assistance of Youth Aliyah. An agreement was signed between Ben Shemen and the woman’s Zionist organization in the U.S.A, Hadassah (the official representative of Youth Aliyah in the U.S.). According to this agreement Hadassah would cover the deficits in the budget of Ben Shemen and assist in funding the film about life in the village. In return Hadassah would have exclusive rights in the film in the U.S.A. The intention was to produce a full <b>blown</b> <b>film</b> with a plot that would move audiences and present the educational achievements of the youth village.|$|E
