Shabby apartment buildings, vacant stores, wino bars, littered vacant lots, junkies, muggers, and career down-and-outers.

25|$|Aristotle {{disagreed}} with Plato on this point, arguing that all universals are instantiated. Aristotle {{argued that there}} are no universals that are unattached to existing things. According to Aristotle, if a universal exists, either as a particular or a relation, then there must have been, must be currently, or must <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>future,</b> something on which the universal can be predicated. Consequently, according to Aristotle, if it is not the case that some universal can be predicated to an object that exists at some period of time, then it does not exist.|$|E

25|$|Women {{look for}} certain cues {{on a first}} date: For example, it is {{important}} to a woman {{to find out if the}} man is courteous or not. Women will look for this by observing if the man comes to the door to pick her up or if he opens doors for her, or compliments her on how she looks, for example. If some of her expectations are not met, mainly the most important ones, she will not want to pursue anything more than a friendship. If the expectations are met, a second date might <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>future,</b> but only if the man is feeling the same thing.|$|E
25|$|At {{the cabinet}} meeting of 26 August 1964, all the ministers present (including {{to some degree}} John Tembo) raised their {{concerns}} about Banda's failure to Africanise, his relations with Portugal and South Africa and their own ambiguous position. The ministers present presented Banda {{with a list of}} grievances: he made no immediate answer, neither accepting or rejecting what the list contained. Banda was apparently surprised by the strength of the opposition at this cabinet meeting, even though his recent relations with Chipembere and Yatutu Chisiza had been difficult. A number of ministers led by Chisiza apparently wished to convert Banda's role from that of Prime Minister, with an expected progression to become executive President, to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> a President without executive functions, with an appointed Prime Minister as head of government. Chiume had been a prominent supporter of Banda and, since 1959, had not been close to the more radical group. However, once Banda had strongly rejected his plan to accept aid from China, Chiume began to attack him, and precipitated the confrontation of 26 August 1964.|$|E
25|$|Work of the American Operation Alsos teams, in November 1944, {{uncovered}} leads {{which took}} them to a company in Paris that handled rare earths and had {{been taken over by}} the Auergesellschaft. This, combined with information gathered in the same month through an Alsos team in Strasbourg, confirmed that the Oranienburg plant was involved in the production of uranium and thorium metals. Since the plant was to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> Soviet zone of occupation and the Red Army's troops would get there before the Allies, General Leslie Groves, commander of the Manhattan Project, recommended to General George Marshall that the plant be destroyed by aerial bombardment, in order to deny its uranium production equipment to the Soviets. On 15 March 1945, 612 B-17 Flying Fortress bombers of the Eighth Air Force dropped 1,506 tons of high-explosive and 178 tons of incendiary bombs on the plant. Riehl visited the site with the Soviets and said that the facility was mostly destroyed. Riehl also recalled long after the war that the Soviets knew precisely why the Americans had bombed the facility— the attack had been directed at them rather than the Germans.|$|E

25|$|Unlike {{prostitution}} and drug use, homosexuality {{has never been}} banned in China, but it was listed as a psychiatric disorder until 2001, and public acts of homosexual sex are punishable as hooliganism. Although increasingly tolerated in the cities, in general, homosexuality is highly stigmatised and {{men who have sex}} with men are under considerable pressure to conceal their sexual orientation. As a result, most homosexuals are married, or will <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>future,</b> and form a bridge between the high-risk {{men who have sex with}} men group to their low-risk wives and other partners. The government has initiated few interventions for men who have sex with men, leaving such programmes to advocacy groups, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and researchers. However, the government recently estimated that there were 5–10 million men who have sex with men living in China, of whom 1.35% are thought to be HIV positive. This information, in addition to studies indicating low levels of HIV knowledge, perceived risk, and testing, and high rates of sexually transmitted diseases, has prompted the Ministry of Health to now include men who have sex with men in the high-risk groups and to call for the development of novel interventions to target them.|$|E

At Jim's new company, Pam gives Darryl a thumbs up as he heads into the interview room, and then is chatted up by an employee who says [...] "Jim speaks about you all the time" [...] and we [...] "can't wait for you to move here." [...] The thought of moving to Philadelphia disturbs her. Meanwhile, Darryl initially fumbles his interview due to nerves and feelings of inadequacy, but everyone else helps calm him down, and he makes a strong reversal. Darryl concludes the interview by attempting to shoot a basket with the room's sports decorations, but instead knocks a light fixture into the fish tank, electrocuting all the fish. Pam commiserates with Darryl over this embarrassing misstep. Jim returns to inform Darryl that although {{he will have to}} pay for the fish, he has the job. During the drive home, Darryl gushes over his new job and the chance to live in Philadelphia while Pam worries about where she and her family will <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>future.</b>|$|E

2500|$|With {{his strong}} {{nationalist}} stance, Mercier {{was very much}} a precursor of later nationalist premiers in future decades who confronted the federal government and tried to win more power for Quebec. He promoted contacts with francophones in other parts of North America outside of Quebec including Western Canada and New England. Those francophones had not yet been assimilated into the English-Canadian or American culture to the extent they would <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>future.</b> [...] Mercier promoted reform, economic development, Catholicism, and the French language. He won popularity but also made enemies. [...] He was returned to the legislature as the Member for the district of Bonaventure and his party won the 1890 election with an increased majority. He was defeated in 1892.|$|E
2500|$|In 2000, Nelson {{announced}} that he would be running for the United States Senate seat held by retiring Republican Connie Mack III. effective January 3, 2001. Florida's [...] "resign-to-run" [...] law requires an incumbent office holder seeking another elective office to submit an irrevocable resignation from the office they currently hold unless that tenure would end anyway before they would assume the new position if elected. The candidate may designate the effective date of the resignation to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>future,</b> but it must be no later than the date that they would assume the new office. This compelled Nelson to submit his resignation as Treasurer, Insurance Commissioner and Fire Marshall early in 2000 when he began to campaign for the U.S. Senate seat. He chose January 3, 2001 as the effective date of his resignation, as that was the date new Senators would be sworn in.|$|E

2500|$|In {{considering}} {{where to}} place reserves, protecting source habitat is often assumed to be the goal, although if {{the cause of a}} sink is human activity, simply designating an area as a reserve has the potential to convert current sink patches to source patches (e.g. no-take zones). [...] Either way, determining which areas are sources or sinks for any one species may be very difficult, and an area that is a source for one species may be unimportant to others. [...] Finally, areas that are sources or sinks currently may not <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> as habitats are continually altered by human activity or climate change. [...] Few areas can be expected to be universal sources, or universal sinks. [...] While the presence of source, sink, or trap patches must be considered for short-term population survival, especially for very small populations, long-term survival may depend on the creation of networks of reserves that incorporate a variety of habitats and allow populations to interact.|$|E
