40|$|Abstract — This paper {{deals with}} the problem of {{assisting}} developers when verifying properties of complex behaviourbased systems. A central aspect of behaviour-based systems is the interaction between the behaviours, as a lot of the functionality of a system typically arises from this interaction. Hence, verification has to deal with the specialities of behaviour interaction. Previous work has introduced a concept for modelling behaviour-based systems as networks of finite-state automata and for applying model checking as verification technique. As the manual verification of large networks is tedious and errorprone, the work at hand introduces a concept for assisting developers by partly automating the verification process. The applicability of the presented approach is demonstrated using the behaviour-based control system of an autonomous <b>bucket</b> <b>excavator.</b> I...|$|E

Increasing efficiency is one of the hottest research topics in hydraulic system. The comparison between two types of hydraulic control systems, which are the valve, controlled system and the pump-controlled system is essential area of researching. Hydraulic actuator with pump-controlled system is equipped in high power mining excavators and forestry equipment in order to increase efficiency. The purpose of this paper is to build a mathematical model for a hydraulic actuator with pump-controlled system.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{discusses}} the simulation of vehicle kinematics with SimVis 3 D and the Newton Game Dynamics Engine. As running example a Pioneer 1 like robot is used. First its differential drive is simulated manually, without physical effects. Then the dynamics engine {{is applied to}} simulate this drive mechanism based on rolling friction between wheels and ground. Comparing the effort of application code for both approaches shows the benefit of delegating the calculation of rigid body motions. This fact is further stressed by simulating a trailer as a passive vehicle without any code extensions. Finally, a standard vehicle kinematic system consisting of Ackermann steering and rear wheel drive is realized 2. The paper concludes with an application of this model for simulating the drive system of a <b>bucket</b> <b>excavator</b> as real world scenario...|$|E

40|$|As the {{advances}} in computer control technology keep emerging, robotic hydraulic excavator becomes imperative. It can improve excavation accuracy and greatly reduce the operator’s labor intensity. The 12 -ton backhoe <b>bucket</b> <b>excavator</b> has been utilized {{in this research}} work where this type of excavator is commonly used in engineering work. The kinematics model of operation device (boom, arm, bucket, and swing) in excavator is established in both Denavit-Hartenberg coordinates for easy programming and geometric space for avoiding blind spot. The control approach is based on trajectory tracing method with displacements and velocities feedbacks. The trajectory planning and autodig program is written by Visual C++. By setting the bucket teeth’s trajectory, the program can automatically plan the velocity and acceleration of each hydraulic cylinder and motor. The results are displayed through a 3 D entity simulation environment which can present real-time movements of excavator kinematics. Object-Oriented Graphics Rendering Engine and skeletal animation are used to give accurate parametric control and feedback. The simulation result shows that a stable linear autodig can be achieved.

40|$|Using {{the bucket}} wheel driving system of a <b>bucket</b> <b>excavator</b> as an example, {{torsional}} vibrations {{of the mechanical}} system caused by the compound external periodic excitation during continuous operation have been investigated in this paper. Due to the periodic grip of the buckets with the excavated soil, the torque on the bucket wheel coming from excavation resistance varies considerably. This torque that represents the external periodic excitation is determined and as a periodic function described by Fourier series. The torque has been calculated for variable main working parameters which are height of the cutting layer, bucket wheel speed and the specific digging resistance of the soil. For the observed system the mechanical model {{in the form of}} a torsional chain with four degrees of freedom has been developed and the eigenvalues computed. The response of the bucket wheel driving system to the external exciting torque during steady state operation has been estimated assuming the excavated soil as homogenious. The graphic representations of both eigenvalues and the responces of the bucket wheel driving system to the external exciting torque have been given. Using the results of this research the influence of the dynamic characteristics of the system itself and the influence of the main working parameters on the torsional vibration of the bucket wheel driving system have been estimated in this paper...|$|E
40|$|Since their {{invention}} in the 1980 s, behaviour-based {{systems have}} become very popular among roboticists. Their component-based nature facilitates the distributed implementation of systems, fosters reuse, and allows for early testing and integration. However, the distributed approach necessitates the interconnection of many components into a network in order to realise complex functionalities. This network {{is crucial to the}} correct operation of the robotic system. There are few sound design techniques for behaviour networks, especially if the systems shall realise task sequences. Therefore, the quality of the resulting behaviour-based systems is often highly dependant on the experience of their developers. This dissertation presents a novel integrated concept for the design and verification of behaviour-based systems that realise task sequences. Part of this concept is a technique for encoding task sequences in behaviour networks. Furthermore, the concept provides guidance to developers of such networks. Based on a thorough analysis of methods for defining sequences, Moore machines have been selected for representing complex tasks. With the help of the structured workflow proposed in this work and the developed accompanying tool support, Moore machines defining task sequences can be transferred automatically into corresponding behaviour networks, resulting in less work for the developer and a lower risk of failure. Due to the common integration of automatically and manually created behaviour-based components, a formal analysis of the final behaviour network is reasonable. For this purpose, the dissertation at hand presents two verification techniques and justifies the selection of model checking. A novel concept for applying model checking to behaviour-based systems is proposed according to which behaviour networks are modelled as synchronised automata. Based on such automata, properties of behaviour networks that realise task sequences can be verified or falsified. Extensive graphical tool support has been developed in order to assist the developer during the verification process. Several examples are provided in order to illustrate the soundness of the presented design and verification techniques. The applicability of the integrated overall concept to real-world tasks is demonstrated using the control system of an autonomous <b>bucket</b> <b>excavator.</b> It can be shown that the proposed design concept is suitable for developing complex sophisticated behaviour networks and that the presented verification technique allows for verifying real-world behaviour-based systems...|$|E
