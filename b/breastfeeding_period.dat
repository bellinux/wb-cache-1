5000|$|Archaeological records {{suggest a}} life {{expectancy}} of 20 to 30 years, primarily due to a high infant and child mortality. Excavations in the Sanzkow burial site near Demmin revealed that 25.8% of the buried children were {{under the age of}} 6 years, another 4.4% under the age of 12 years, adding to an estimated infant mortality of 20%. For those who reached adulthood, the average death age was 40.7 years (males) and 34.1 years (females), and only 4.4%, primarily men, reached the age of 60 years. The lower {{life expectancy of}} women results from puerperal mortality: An average woman gave birth to three to four children in intervals of three to four years. The average heights of adult males was [...] and [...] for adult women. Medical research of teeth revealed a healthy diet with sufficient protein and low carbohydrate shares and a two-year <b>breastfeeding</b> <b>period.</b> Serious pathological deformations of bones were found in 28% of the adult Sanzkow skeletons, less serious ones in 44%. Most adults suffered from spondylosis deformans, especially men above the age of twenty years, but also women above the age of thirty years. Combined with high rates of arthrosis deformans, likewise primarily affecting males, and other skeleton deformations, this points to high physical strain especially of the male population. An extraordinarily high rate of bone fractures (15% of the adult population, primarily men) indicates massive involvement in battles and accidents. Skull injuries from strokes, swords and arrows were also common. Two bodies at Sanzkow were buried as vampires. For one of those, there is evidence for a head injury that might have resulted in brain dysfunctions, this man was buried with three large rocks placed on his face, breast and legs.

40|$|Significant {{progress}} has been made in the prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV. In 2008, an estimated 1. 4 million pregnant women living with HIV in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) gave birth and almost half of these accessed antiretroviral drugs to prevent HIV transmission to their infants, which ranged from single-dose nevirapine to full combination antiretroviral therapy (ART). Although this represents a significant increase in ART coverage, much more remains to be done in terms of HIV testing and counseling, establishment of ART eligibility, and postnatal treatment and care. In November 2009, the World Health Organization issued new PMTCT guidelines for LMIC, stressing the benefits of earlier initiation of ART during pregnancy and its continuation throughout the delivery and the <b>breastfeeding</b> <b>periods.</b> A key recommendation of these guidelines is to start ART for all HIV-positive pregnant women with a CD 4 count below 350 cells/mm, irrespective of clinical stage. This makes access to CD 4 testing more crucial than ever for the successful implementation of PMTCT programs, since clinical staging performs poorly in identifying pregnant women eligible for ART. However, there are still many barriers to accessing CD 4 testing in remote health structures implementing antenatal care services, particularly in countries with a high HIV prevalence.

40|$|In 1998, a joint UNAIDS/UNICEF/WHO {{working group}} {{announced}} an initiative to pilot test an intervention to reduce perinatal transmission of {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV), based on new guidelines on HIV and infant feeding. This intervention for developing countries includes short-course perinatal zidovudine (AZT) treatment and advice to HIV-positive women not to breastfeed their infants, where {{this can be done}} safely. The present paper raises questions about the extent of the public health benefit of this intervention, even though it may be cost-effective, due to the limited capacity of antenatal and delivery services to implement it fully. It argues {{that it is necessary to}} provide universal access to replacement feeding methods and support in their safe use, not only for women who have tested HIV-positive during pregnancy, but also for untested women who may also decide not to breastfeed, some of whom may be infected with HIV or may acquire HIV during the <b>breastfeeding</b> <b>period.</b> It further argues that additional funding, more staff, staff training, and improved capacity and resources are also needed to integrate this intervention successfully into antenatal and delivery care. The intervention will prevent some infants from getting HIV even in the absence of many of these changes. However, a comprehensive approach to HIV prevention and care in developing countries that includes both women and infants would promote better health and survival of women, which would in turn contribute to greater infant health and survival. If combination antiretroviral therapy in the latter part of pregnancy and/or during the <b>breastfeeding</b> <b>period</b> can be shown to be safe for infants, preliminary evidence suggests that it might reduce perinatal HIV transmission as effectively as the current intervention and, in addition, might allow the practice of breastfeeding to be preserved...|$|E

The sample pool consisted of 121 pregnant women who were recruited in week 18 of pregnancy and followed through to 6 months after birth. Breast milk was collected from 85 mothers at 6 weeks, and 4 and 6 months after birth. 61 of these delivered breast milk at all three time points. The breast milk samples were digested in a microwave oven and analyzed by double-focusing high resolution ICP-MS (Element 2). The analysis method was satisfactory for all the elements except arsenic, beryllium, lithium (could not be quantitated), and chro-mium and vanadium (too high quantitation limits).

Therefore midwives need to be educated in this area to be able to provide mothers after childbirth with quality information concerning this issue within nursing care. The main aim of this thesis was to identify the quality of midwives´ education regarding contraception after childbirth and to find out how midwives orient themselves in contraceptive methods that may be used in confinement and <b>breastfeeding</b> <b>periods.</b> Another objective was to determine whether mothers after childbirth are well informed about the choice of appropriate contraceptives, and whether a midwife has an important role in educating mothers about contraception after childbirth. Research questions and hypotheses to meet the aims were stated. To carry out this survey a qualitative research with the combination of a quantitative research was conducted. The qualitative research was carried out by an interview technique. Interviews were conducted with midwives in the department of gynecology and obstetrics in Strakonice hospital, Inc., with midwives from consulting rooms of gynecologists in Vodňany, Vimperk and České Budějovice and midwives providing field care in Strakonice, Tábor and Písek areas. The survey was conducted in March and April 2011. The quantitative research study was carried out in consulting rooms of gynecologists in Strakonice, Vodňany and České Budějovice. To find the answers the technique of an anonymous questionnaire with 30 questions was used. Respondents were women after childbirth coming to consulting rooms of gynecologists for a check up after the confinement period. The total number of respondents was 121 (100 %). The survey was conducted in March and April 2011. The stated aims of the thesis were met. The qualitative research has shown that midwives orient themselves in methods of contraception. They apply this knowledge only when they see interest in mothers. Based on the quantitative research it is possible to set up two hypotheses. Hypothesis 1, which was confirmed: Mothers after childbirth are educated to take an appropriate choice of contraception after childbirth. Hypothesis 2, that was not confirmed: According to the interviewed mothers, a midwife does not have an important role in education on the selection of appropriate contraception after childbirth.

MÉTODOS: analisou-se uma amostra de 599 crianças e seus responsáveis que procuraram o Pronto Socorro do Instituto da Criança, São Paulo, de agosto a dezembro de 1998. Utilizou-se um questionário incluindo: idade, profissão e escolaridade dos pais, condições de moradia, renda familiar, trabalho materno, duração da amamentação exclusiva, introdução de novos alimentos, causas de desmame e importância do leite materno. RESULTADOS: 86, 1 % das mães amamentaram e 92 % referiram saber a importância do leite materno. A idade média do desmame foi de 3, 3 meses, sendo que 75, 9 % das mães suspenderam a amamentação sem orientação médica. 38, 9 % referiram que o leite era "fraco", ou "secou" ou que a criança "largou" o peito. Maior escolaridade da mãe e presença de rede de esgoto mostraram relação com maior tempo de aleitamento (p = 0, 016 e p = 0, 011 respectivamente). Não houve associação entre acompanhamento da criança no posto de saúde e tempo de aleitamento materno. CONCLUSÕES: embora a grande maioria das mães saiba a importância do leite materno e tenha amamentado seu filho, a duração do aleitamento materno exclusivo é menor do que o preconizado pela Organização Mundial da Saúde, sendo a baixa escolaridade um fator para o desmame precoce.

Previous HIV and infant feeding guidelines emphasized on preventing infants from becoming infected with HIV by counseling HIV-infected mothers to avoid all <b>breastfeeding.</b> Over the <b>period,</b> programme implementers and researchers have reported difficulties in implementing earlier recommendations and guidelines on HIV and infant feeding within health-care systems. New evidence now shows that giving Anti-Retroviral therapy (ARVs) to either the HIV-infected mother or HIV-exposed infant can significantly reduce the risk of transmitting HIV through breastfeeding. Thus, in 2010 World Healt...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{transmission}} of the Human Immune Deficiency Virus (HIV) from mother to child during pregnancy, birth and <b>breastfeeding</b> <b>period</b> {{is the most common}} way of HIV infection in children. Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission (PMTCT) of HIV program is aimed at reducing the Mother to Child Transmission of HIV. The study aimed at exploring and describing factors which affect compliance to the utilization of PMTCT service package among HIV positive mothers who delivered outside a health facility. Methods: The study adopted a descriptive qualitative study design and entailed in-depth interviews with the HIV positive postnatal mothers attending the maternal child health and family planning clinic (MCH/FP) at Turbo Health Centre as key informants. The interviews were taped with a voice recorder, transcribed and analysed using NVivo computer software for qualitative research to document emerging themes...|$|E
40|$|In the pre-expulsive and expulsive {{phases of}} labor, {{oxytocin}} {{and several other}} osteoclastogenic mediators, such as prostaglandins and IL- 6, are secreted in high concentrations. This study was undertaken to assess whether the peripheral blood obtained from healthy women after vaginal delivery contains a larger pool of osteoclast precursors compared with age- and gender-matched controls. Our results clearly show that the number and size of osteoclasts generated in vitro from osteoclast precursors isolated from women after delivery are significantly larger than those from controls. This finding can account for the decrease in bone mass that is often observed during the <b>breastfeeding</b> <b>period</b> and the concomitant release of high quantities of calcium in the milk. Further investigations are required to establish whether analysis of blood osteoclast precursors can be predictive of changes in bone remodeling in this setting...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Differences in the {{incidence}} and outcome of breast cancer among Hispanic women compared with white women are well documented and are likely explained by ethnic differences in genetic composition, lifestyle, or environmental exposures. METHODOLGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A population-based {{study was conducted in}} Galicia, Spain. A total of 510 women diagnosed with operable invasive breast cancer between 1997 and 2010 participated in the study. Data on demographics, breast cancer risk factors, and clinico-pathological characteristics were collected. The different breast cancer tumor subtypes were compared on their clinico-pathological characteristics and risk factor profiles, particularly reproductive variables and breastfeeding. Among the 501 breast cancer patients (with known ER and PR receptors), 85 % were ER+/PR+ and 15 % were ER-&PR-. Among the 405 breast cancer with known ER, PR and HER 2 status, 71 % were ER+/PR+/HER 2 - (luminal A), 14 % were ER+/PR+/HER 2 + (luminal B), 10 % were ER-/PR-/HER 2 - (triple negative breast cancer, TNBC), and 5 % were ER-/PR-/HER 2 + (non-luminal). A lifetime <b>breastfeeding</b> <b>period</b> equal to or longer than 7 months was less frequent in case patients with TNBC (OR =  0. 25, 95 % CI =  0. 08 - 0. 68) compared to luminal A breast cancers. Both a low (2 or fewer pregnancies) and a high (3 - 4 pregnancies) number of pregnancies combined with a long <b>breastfeeding</b> <b>period</b> were associated with reduced odds of TNBC compared with luminal A breast cancer, although the association seemed to be slightly more pronounced among women with a low number of pregnancies (OR =  0. 09, 95 % CI =  0. 005 - 0. 54). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In case-case analyses with the luminal A cases as the reference group, we observed a lower proportion of TNBC among women who breastfed 7 or more months. The combination of longer breastfeeding duration and lower parity seemed to further reduce the odds of having a TNBC compared to a luminal A breast cancer...|$|E
40|$|A {{hospital}} basedcross sectional {{study was}} designed to know knowledge,attitude and practices of Breast feeding among post natal women in post natal wards of tertiary care Hospital in south Indian city. Interview technique was used as a tool for collection of the data information. A total of 100 postnatal mothers were included in the study. Among them 22 % were illiterates. Majority of the mothers (67 %) were housewives. 78 % post natal women were living in joint families. 55 % of post natal women who had normal delivery answered that breast feeding should be given with in 1 hr of delivery 65, be given with in 4 hrs of caesarean section. Only 50 % women said that colostrum feed should be given. 50 % of the women had received advice on <b>breastfeeding</b> during antenatal <b>period.</b> And in that, only 17 % from a healthcare worker; so, it is reinforced that we require more policies to educate the mothers regarding breast feeding practices...|$|R
40|$|OBJETIVO: Investigar a prevalência do excesso de peso e sua associação com fatores socioeconômicos, biológicos e maternos em menores de 5 anos da região semiárida do estado de Alagoas. MÉTODOS: Estudo transversal, com amostra representativa. Foram avaliadas variáveis da criança (excesso de peso, sexo, peso ao nascer, prematuridade, duração do aleitamento materno e procedência) e da mãe (excesso de peso, obesidade central, renda, escolaridade e fumo durante a gestação). O excesso de peso nas crianças foi definido com base no índice peso/estatura > 1 escore z, e nas mães, o excesso de peso e a obesidade central foram identificados pelo índice de massa {{corporal}} > 30 kg/m² e circunferência da cintura > 80 cm, respectivamente. Realizou-se regressão logística, adotando-se o excesso de peso como desfecho, considerando-se significante p OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate the}} prevalence of overweight and its association with socioeconomic, biological, and maternal factors in children under 5 years {{of age in the}} semiarid region of the state of Alagoas. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study with a representative sample. We evaluated child variables (excess weight, sex, birth weight, prematurity, duration of breastfeeding, and origin) and mother variables (excess weight, central obesity, income, education, and smoking during pregnancy). Excess weight in children was defined based on the weight-for-height > 1 z score; in mothers, overweight and central obesity were identified by mass body index > 30 kg/m² and waist circumference > 80 cm, respectively. We conducted logistic regression, adopting overweight as an outcome, considering as significant p < 0. 05. RESULTS: The sample comprised 963 children, {{with a mean age of}} 27. 7 months (SD ± 17. 3). The prevalence of overweight children was 28. 5 %, directly associated with central obesity in the mother (odds ratio = 1. 46; 95 %CI 1. 07 - 1. 98) and duration of non-exclusive <b>breastfeeding</b> for a <b>period</b> of less than 6 months (odds ratio = 1. 82, 95 %CI 1. 31 - 2. 51). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed a high prevalence of overweight children under 5 years of age associated with central obesity in the mother and non-exclusive <b>breastfeeding</b> for a <b>period</b> less than 6 months. These findings suggest that breastfeeding may protect children against overweight and point to the need for primary and secondary prevention of maternal central obesity...|$|R
40|$|Breastfeeding is {{recommended}} {{exclusively for the}} first 6 months after birth, with continued breastfeeding for at least 2 years. Yet prevalence of these recommendations is low globally, although it is an effective and cost-effective way to prevent serious infections and chronic illness. Previous studies have reported that social support greatly influences breastfeeding, {{but there is little}} evidence on perceived social norms in Mexico and how they affect actual behavior. Our objective was to investigate breastfeeding intention, practices, attitudes, and beliefs, particularly normative, among low-resource communities in central and southern Mexico. We performed a secondary analysis using the theory of planned behavior with cross-sectional data, which included semi-structured individual interviews with fathers (n 10), 8 focus groups with mothers (n 50), and 8 focus groups with women community leaders (n 44) with a total of 104 participants. Our data also included a quantitative survey among pregnant women and mothers (n 321). Women reported supplementing breast milk with water and teas soon after birth, as well as introducing small bites of solid food a few months after birth. Social norms appeared to support breastfeeding, but not exclusive breastfeeding or <b>breastfeeding</b> for <b>periods</b> longer than about a year. This may be partially explained by: a) behavioral beliefs that for the first 6 months breast milk alone is insufficient for the baby, and that water in addition to breast milk is necessary to hydrate an infant and b) normative beliefs related to the appropriateness of breastfeeding in public and as the child gets older. Future strategies should focus on positively influencing social norms to support recommended practices, and emphasize the specific reasons behind the recommendations. Future efforts should take a multi-pronged approach using a variety of influences, not only directed at healthcare providers but close family members, including fathers...|$|R
