5|$|Bohr {{developed}} the <b>Bohr</b> <b>model</b> of the atom, {{in which he}} proposed that energy levels of electrons are discrete and that the electrons revolve in stable orbits around the atomic nucleus but can jump from one energy level (or orbit) to another. Although the <b>Bohr</b> <b>model</b> has been supplanted by other models, its underlying principles remain valid. He conceived the principle of complementarity: that items could be separately analysed in terms of contradictory properties, like behaving as a wave or a stream of particles. The notion of complementarity dominated Bohr's thinking in both science and philosophy.|$|E
5|$|For an {{electron}} to transition between two different states, e.g. grounded state to first excited level (ionization), it must absorb or emit a photon at an energy matching {{the difference in}} the potential energy of those levels, according to Niels <b>Bohr</b> <b>model,</b> what can be precisely calculated by the Schrödinger equation.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1913, Niels Bohr, of the Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of Copenhagen, {{submitted}} his theory of the <b>Bohr</b> atomic <b>model</b> for publication. [...] Later that year, Ewald attended the Birmingham meeting of the British Association where he heard accounts and discussions of [...] James Jeans’ review on radiation theory and <b>Bohr’s</b> <b>model.</b> [...] This ignited a major new area of research for Sommerfeld and his students – the study and interpretation of atomic spectra and molecular band spectroscopy and theoretical modeling of atomic and molecular structure.|$|R
5|$|The model's first hurdle was the Pickering series, lines {{which did}} not fit Balmer's formula. When {{challenged}} on this by Alfred Fowler, Bohr replied that they were caused by ionised helium, helium atoms with only one electron. The <b>Bohr</b> <b>model</b> was found to work for such ions. Many older physicists, like Thomson, Rayleigh and Hendrik Lorentz, {{did not like the}} trilogy, but the younger generation, including Rutherford, David Hilbert, Albert Einstein, Enrico Fermi, Max Born and Arnold Sommerfeld saw it as a breakthrough. The trilogy's acceptance was entirely due to its ability to explain phenomena which stymied other models, and to predict results that were subsequently verified by experiments. Today, the <b>Bohr</b> <b>model</b> of the atom has been superseded, but is still the best known model of the atom, as it often appears in high school physics and chemistry texts.|$|E
5|$|Bohr's {{model was}} not perfect. It could only predict the {{spectral}} lines of hydrogen; it couldn't predict those of multielectron atoms. Worse still, as spectrographic technology improved, additional spectral lines in hydrogen were observed which Bohr's model couldn't explain. In 1916, Arnold Sommerfeld added elliptical orbits to the <b>Bohr</b> <b>model</b> {{to explain the}} extra emission lines, but this made the model very difficult to use, and it still couldn't explain more complex atoms.|$|E

His work included the Franck–Hertz experiment, an important confirmation of the <b>Bohr</b> <b>model</b> of the atom. He promoted the careers of women in physics, notably Lise Meitner, Hertha Sponer and Hilde Levi.|$|E

25|$|Matrix {{mechanics}} was {{the first}} conceptually autonomous and logically consistent formulation of quantum mechanics. Its account of quantum jumps supplanted the <b>Bohr</b> <b>Model's</b> electron orbits. It did so by interpreting the physical properties of particles as matrices that evolve in time. It {{is equivalent to the}} Schrödinger wave formulation of quantum mechanics, as manifest in Dirac's bra–ket notation.|$|R
40|$|<b>Bohr’s</b> atomic <b>model</b> {{is one of}} {{the better}} known {{examples}} of empirically successful, albeit inconsistent, theoretical schemes in the history of physics. For this reason, many philosophers use this model to illustrate their position for the occurrence and the function of inconsistency in science. In this paper, I proceed to a critical comparison of the structure and the aims of Bohr’s research program – the starting point of which was the formulation of his model – with some of its contemporary philosophical readings. My study comes to conclude that the attempt of certain philosophers to accommodate <b>Bohr’s</b> <b>model</b> to a form of paraconsistent logic obliterates essential aspects of scientists' actual practice and reasoning...|$|R
5|$|Even Born was {{surprised}} to discover that Paul Dirac had been thinking along the same lines as Heisenberg. Soon Wolfgang Pauli used the matrix method to calculate the energy values of the hydrogen atom, and found that they agreed with the <b>Bohr</b> <b>model.</b> Another important contribution was made by Erwin Schrödinger, who looked at the problem using wave mechanics. This {{had a great deal of}} appeal to many at the time, as it offered the possibility of returning to deterministic classical physics. Born would have none of this, as it ran counter to facts determined by experiment. He formulated the now-standard interpretation of the probability density function for ψ*ψ in the Schrödinger equation, which he published in July 1926.|$|E
25|$|However, {{this is not}} to {{say that}} the Bohr-Sommerfeld model was without its successes. Calculations based on the Bohr–Sommerfeld model were able to {{accurately}} explain a number of more complex atomic spectral effects. For example, up to first-order perturbations, the <b>Bohr</b> <b>model</b> and quantum mechanics make the same predictions for the spectral line splitting in the Stark effect. At higher-order perturbations, however, the <b>Bohr</b> <b>model</b> and quantum mechanics differ, and measurements of the Stark effect under high field strengths helped confirm the correctness of quantum mechanics over the <b>Bohr</b> <b>model.</b> The prevailing theory behind this difference lies in the shapes of the orbitals of the electrons, which vary according to the energy state of the electron.|$|E
25|$|The model's key success lay in {{explaining}} the Rydberg formula for the spectral emission lines of atomic hydrogen. While the Rydberg formula had been known experimentally, it did not gain a theoretical underpinning until the <b>Bohr</b> <b>model</b> was introduced. Not only did the <b>Bohr</b> <b>model</b> explain {{the reason for the}} structure of the Rydberg formula, it also provided a justification for its empirical results in terms of fundamental physical constants.|$|E

50|$|From {{that time}} to the 1920s, {{physicists}} were seeking to explain atomic spectra and blackbody radiation. One attempt to explain hydrogen spectral lines was the <b>Bohr</b> atom <b>model.</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{hundred years}} ago, a twenty-eight year old Danish {{scientist}} published {{a series of}} three papers in which electron motion was quantized. The <b>Bohr</b> atomic <b>model</b> is surely known by every chemistry student. Nevertheless in this same 1913 trilogy, Bohr studied atoms with several electrons as well as molecules. Chemistry students, in general, are not aware of the Bohr molecule. The present paper aims at rescuing this important classical model. A review of the <b>Bohr</b> atomic <b>model</b> for both one and several electrons is discussed, together with a theoretical presentation of the Bohr molecule...|$|R
25|$|In 1925, a {{new kind}} of {{mechanics}} was proposed, quantum mechanics, in which <b>Bohr's</b> <b>model</b> of electrons traveling in quantized orbits was extended into a more accurate model of electron motion. The new theory was proposed by Werner Heisenberg. Another form of the same theory, wave mechanics, was discovered by the Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger independently, and by different reasoning. Schrödinger employed de Broglie's matter waves, but sought wave solutions of a three-dimensional wave equation describing electrons that were constrained to move about the nucleus of a hydrogen-like atom, by being trapped by the potential of the positive nuclear charge.|$|R
25|$|For {{those who}} {{accepted}} that superseded marginal utility analysis had been superseded by indifference curve analysis, the former became at best somewhat {{analogous to the}} <b>Bohr</b> <b>model</b> of the atom—perhaps pedagogically useful, but “old fashioned” and ultimately incorrect.|$|E
25|$|Schrödinger {{was able}} to {{calculate}} the energy levels of hydrogen by treating a hydrogen atom's electron as a classical wave, moving in a well of electrical potential created by the proton. This calculation accurately reproduced the energy levels of the <b>Bohr</b> <b>model.</b>|$|E
25|$|Within a year it {{was noted}} that the {{equation}} for the relation could be explained in terms of the 1913 <b>Bohr</b> <b>model,</b> with reasonable extra assumptions about atomic structure in other elements. Moseley's result, by Bohr's later account, not only established atomic number as a measurable experimental quantity, but gave it a physical meaning as the positive charge on the atomic nucleus (number of protons). The elements could be ordered in the periodic system in order of atomic number, rather than atomic weight. The result tied together the organization of the periodic table, the <b>Bohr</b> <b>model</b> for the atom, and Rutherford's model for alpha scattering from nuclei. It was cited by Rutherford, Bohr, and others as a critical advance in understanding the nature of the atomic nucleus.|$|E
5000|$|The gradual {{acceptance}} of Einstein's theories of relativity and the quantized nature of light transmission, and of Niels <b>Bohr's</b> <b>model</b> {{of the atom}} created as many problems as they solved, leading to a full-scale effort to reestablish physics on new fundamental principles. Expanding relativity to cases of accelerating reference frames (the [...] "general theory of relativity") in the 1910s, Einstein posited an equivalence between the inertial force of acceleration and the force of gravity, leading {{to the conclusion that}} space is curved and finite in size, and the prediction of such phenomena as gravitational lensing and the distortion of time in gravitational fields.|$|R

By a computational method, we calculate the Coulomb force among the particles, and the number of de Broglie's waves contained in the short segment at short time intervals.

25|$|However, {{these numbers}} are very nearly the same, due to the much larger mass of the proton, about 1836.1 times {{the mass of the}} {{electron}}, so that the reduced mass in the system is the mass of the electron multiplied by the constant 1836.1/(1+1836.1) = 0.99946. This fact was historically important in convincing Rutherford of the importance of <b>Bohr's</b> <b>model,</b> for it explained the fact that the frequencies of lines in the spectra for singly ionized helium do not differ from those of hydrogen by a factor of exactly 4, but rather by 4 times the ratio of the reduced mass for the hydrogen vs. the helium systems, which was much closer to the experimental ratio than exactly 4.|$|R
25|$|The <b>Bohr</b> <b>model</b> is a {{relatively}} primitive model of the hydrogen atom, compared to the valence shell atom. As a theory, it can be derived as a first-order approximation of the hydrogen atom using the broader and much more accurate quantum mechanics and thus may {{be considered to be}} an obsolete scientific theory. However, because of its simplicity, and its correct results for selected systems (see below for application), the <b>Bohr</b> <b>model</b> is still commonly taught to introduce students to quantum mechanics or energy level diagrams before moving on to the more accurate, but more complex, valence shell atom. A related model was originally proposed by Arthur Erich Haas in 1910, but was rejected. The quantum theory of the period between Planck's discovery of the quantum (1900) and the advent of a full-blown quantum mechanics (1925) {{is often referred to as}} the old quantum theory.|$|E
25|$|In quantum {{mechanics}} the energy levels of electrons in atoms {{depend on the}} reduced mass {{of the system of}} electron and nucleus. For the hydrogen atom, the role of reduced mass is most simply seen in the <b>Bohr</b> <b>model</b> of the atom, where the reduced mass appears in a simple calculation of the Rydberg constant and Rydberg equation, but the reduced mass also appears in the Schrödinger equation, and the Dirac equation for calculating atomic energy levels.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Bohr</b> <b>model</b> {{was able}} to explain the {{emission}} and absorption spectra of hydrogen. The energies of electrons in the n = 1, 2, 3, etc. states in the <b>Bohr</b> <b>model</b> match those of current physics. However, this did not explain similarities between different atoms, as expressed by the periodic table, such {{as the fact that}} helium (two electrons), neon (10 electrons), and argon (18 electrons) exhibit similar chemical inertness. Modern quantum mechanics explains this in terms of electron shells and subshells which can each hold a number of electrons determined by the Pauli exclusion principle. Thus the n = 1 state can hold one or two electrons, while the n = 2 state can hold up to eight electrons in 2s and 2p subshells. In helium, all n = 1 states are fully occupied; the same for n = 1 and n = 2 in neon. In argon the 3s and 3p subshells are similarly fully occupied by eight electrons; quantum mechanics also allows a 3d subshell but this is at higher energy than the 3s and 3p in argon (contrary to the situation in the hydrogen atom) and remains empty.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Bohr's</b> <b>model</b> of {{the atom}} was {{essentially}} a planetary one, with the electrons orbiting around the nuclear [...] "sun."

[...] Each orbital is three dimensional, rather than the two dimensional orbit, and is often depicted as a three-dimensional region within which there is a 95 percent probability of finding the electron.|$|R
5|$|By 1914, {{experiments}} by physicists Ernest Rutherford, Henry Moseley, James Franck and Gustav Hertz {{had largely}} established {{the structure of}} an atom as a dense nucleus of positive charge surrounded by lower-mass electrons. In 1913, Danish physicist Niels Bohr postulated that electrons resided in quantized energy states, with their energies determined by the angular momentum of the electron's orbit about the nucleus. The electrons could move between those states, or orbits, by the emission or absorption of photons of specific frequencies. By means of these quantized orbits, he accurately explained the spectral lines of the hydrogen atom. However, <b>Bohr's</b> <b>model</b> failed {{to account for the}} relative intensities of the spectral lines and it was unsuccessful in explaining the spectra of more complex atoms.|$|R
