25|$|Although {{progesterone}} {{does not}} bind {{directly to the}} AR, it is a precursor and intermediate in the biosynthesis of androgens from cholesterol. For this reason, {{there has been some}} speculation that exogenous progesterone could be transformed into androgens by certain tissues that express the requisite enzymes. Progesterone is converted by 17α-hydroxylase into 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone is converted by 17,20-lyase into androstenedione, and androstenedione is converted by 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases into testosterone. CYP17A1, the cytochrome P450 gene that encodes 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase, is expressed mainly in the gonads (ovaries and testes) and the adrenal glands. Despite the reasoning that progesterone could be converted into androgens however, clinical studies in which women were treated with 100 to 300mg/day OMP have found no or only a small increase in levels of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone and no change in androgen levels, including those of dehydroepiandrosterone, androstenedione, and testosterone. In these studies, levels of estradiol and cortisol, which progesterone is also a precursor of, did not change either, although levels of 11-deoxycorticosterone did increase significantly. In accordance with the lack of changes in androgen levels, progesterone, unlike various progestins, has not been associated with androgenic effects in clinical studies, including changes in the <b>blood</b> <b>lipid</b> <b>profile</b> or sex hormone-binding globulin levels, acne, skin oiliness, hirsutism, or voice deepening, or induction of teratogenicity (i.e., virilization of female fetuses).|$|E

5000|$|The odds {{of having}} {{hypertension}} are 1.58 times higher {{in people with}} psoriasis than those without the condition; these odds are even higher with severe cases of psoriasis. A similar association was noted in people who have psoriatic arthritis—the odds of having hypertension {{were found to be}} 2.07 times greater when compared to odds of the general population. The link between psoriasis and hypertension is not currently understood. Mechanisms hypothesized to be involved in this relationship include the following: dysregulation of the renin-angiotensin system, elevated levels of endothelin 1 in the blood, and increased oxidative stress. The incidence of the heart rhythm abnormality atrial fibrillation is 1.31 times higher in people with mild psoriasis and 1.63 times higher in people with severe psoriasis. [...] There may be a slightly increased risk of stroke associated with psoriasis, especially in severe cases. Treating high levels of cholesterol with statins has been associated with decreased psoriasis severity, as measured by PASI score, and has also been associated with improvements in other cardiovascular disease risk factors such as markers of inflammation. These cardioprotective effects are attributed to ability of statins to improve <b>blood</b> <b>lipid</b> <b>profile</b> and because of their anti-inflammatory effects. Statin use in those with psoriasis and hyperlipidemia was associated with decreased levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and TNFα as well as decreased activity of the immune protein LFA-1.

40|$|Study objective: to {{estimate}} efficiency of atorvastatin therapy {{in patients with}} type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM), who are the carrier of various genotypes Q 192 R paraoxonase gene 1 (PON 1). 386 T 2 DM patients, who have not received statin therapy before, and 187 healthy people were examined. All those examined were exposed to <b>blood</b> <b>lipid</b> <b>profile</b> testing and molecular genetic research. The atorvastatin treatment group included 164 T 2 DM patients with abnormality of lipids, their <b>blood</b> <b>lipid</b> <b>profile</b> values were assessed before and after 3 months of the therapy. <b>Blood</b> <b>lipid</b> <b>profile</b> values {{did not differ in}} type 2 diabetes mellitus patients (T 2 DM) - the carriers of different Q 192 R genotypes of paraoxonase gene 1 (PON 1) polymorphism. Atorvastatin therapy decreased atherogenic lipoprotein levels in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients (T 2 DM) - the carriers of different Q 192 R genotypes of paraoxonase gene 1 (PON 1) polymorphism, but reduction degree in the carriers of different Q 192 R genotypes differed - in Q 192 Q bearers it was greater than in the bearers of Q 192 R genotype of gene PON 1 (р = 0, 031). Atorvastatin 3 -months therapy revealed greater reduction of total cholesterol in the carriers of Q 192 Q genotype of gene 1 (PON 1) than in the carriers of Q 192 R genotype of gene 1 (PON 1) ...|$|E
40|$|Maiden name: Kelly, Janet EricaThe {{main purpose}} of this study was to assess the effect of {{progressive}} resistance training on the <b>blood</b> <b>lipid</b> <b>profile</b> in post-menopausal women. Thirty-four female subjects aged 50 to 75 years were selected from the population of Grahamstown, South Africa. All participants were previously sedentary and possessed at least one lipid profile abnormality but were otherwise healthy. Pre-tests included a sub-maximal stress Electrocardiogram, measures of stature, mass, central and limb girths as well as an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and a total <b>blood</b> <b>lipid</b> <b>profile.</b> Participants took part in a 24 -week progressive resistance training programme, consisting of three supervised sessions per week, each lasting 45 minutes and were not permitted to lose more than 10 % of initial body mass during the 24 -week study. All pre-test measures, excluding the stress ECG and the OGTT, were repeated every four weeks for the duration of the study. Results were that body mass, body mass index and waist-to-hip ratio did not change. Girth measures at mid-humerus, chest, waist, hip, mid-quadricep and mid-gastrocnemius all decreased significantly (p= 0. 05). LDL-cholesterol increased significantly over the course of 24 weeks (3. 61 mmol. L- 1 to 4. 07 mmol. L- 1) as did total cholesterol (5. 81 mmol. L- 1 to 6. 24 mmol. L- 1). Triglyceride concentration remained unchanged and HDL-cholesterol decreased significantly between the pre-test measure (1. 55 mmol. L- 1) and the measure after six months (1. 42 mmol. L- 1). It can be concluded that the <b>blood</b> <b>lipid</b> <b>profile</b> in a sample of post-menopausal women was not positively affected by a progressive resistance training programme over a 24 week period...|$|E
40|$|Background: Several {{clinical}} trials {{have investigated the}} effects of flaxseed and flaxseed-derived products (flaxseed oil or lignans) on blood lipids; however, the findings have been inconsistent. Objective: We aimed to identify and quantify the effectiveness of flaxseed and its derivatives on <b>blood</b> <b>lipid</b> <b>profiles.</b> Design: A comprehensive literature search {{was performed on the}} basis of English reports of randomized controlled trials of flaxseed or its derivatives on <b>lipid</b> <b>profiles</b> in adults, which were published from January 1990 to October 2008. Attempts also were made to access unpublished data. Study quality was assessed by using the Jadad score, and a meta-analysis was conducted. Results: Twenty-eight studies were included. Flaxseed interventions reduced total and LDL cholesterol by 0. 10 mmol/L (95...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to evaluate the effects of gedi leaves (Abelmoschus manihot (L.) Medik) on <b>blood</b> <b>lipid</b> <b>profiles</b> and carcass quality of broilers. A hundred chickens were allocated to four diet treatments, with 5 replications. The diets were basal diet (R 0), 5 % GLM (R 1), 10 % GLM (R 2), and 15 % GLM (R 3). Treatments had no significant effect on total blood cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL-cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol, significantly effect on reducing carcass weight and abdominal fat, but recorded no significantly effect on carcass percentage. It can be concluded that adding gedi leaves to broiler diets might provide benefit for functional food...|$|R
