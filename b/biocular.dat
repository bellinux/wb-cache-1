40|$|Background: Estimation of intercanthal {{width and}} <b>biocular</b> breadth from digital {{photography}} {{is important in}} the evaluation of several systemic syndromes, craniofacial abnormalities and in surgical treatments of post-traumatic telecanthus. Dysmorphologists employ canthal measurements in evaluating the degree of hypertelorism. So intercanthal width and <b>biocular</b> breadth values are very important for clinicians, ophthalmologists, plastic and reconstructive surgeons. The reliability of estimation of intercanthal width from <b>biocular</b> breadth by using multiplication factor is high. Objective: To make an attempt to determine the multiplication factor for estimation of intercanthal width. Materials and method: This is a cross sectional study conducted in the Anatomy department of Sir Salimullah Medical College, Dhaka, Bangladesh from January 2010 to June 2011. One hundred Bangladeshi 25 to 45 years old women were selected purposively for the study. Results: The mean±SD intercanthal width was 3. 456 ± 0. 3585 cm. Multiplication factor for measuring intercanthal width from <b>biocular</b> breadth (9. 348 ± 0. 7174 cm) was 0. 369 ± 0. 0232 cm. The mean±SD of estimated intercanthal width was 3. 449 ± 0. 2647 cm. No significant difference was found between the measured and estimated intercanthal width. Conclusion: Multiplication factor can be used to determine intercanthal width in Bangladeshi women though agreement test would have been done to generalize the finding...|$|E

In craniofacial anthropometry, consistent landmarks localization as per standard definition of the craniofacial anthropometry landmarks {{is very important in}} order to get accurate craniofacial anthropometry data. In this article we demonstrated an automatic detection of craniofacial anthropometry landmarks at the orbital region. 3 D images of 100 respondents’ were photogaphed using Vectra- 3 D in controlled environment. Craniofacial measurements of 30 3 D images were measured using VAM software. Two data sets of left and right eyes positive training data were created to train ‘en’ and ‘ex’ haar cascade classifiers. These classifiers were used to detect and locate the inner (en) and outer (ex) eye corners. We automatically measured the left and right eye fissures length (en-ex), the intercanthal (en-en) and the <b>biocular</b> (ex-ex) width. Statistical analysis was performed on the measurements taken by Vectra 3 D and by our software with paired t-test and calculated the ICC indices. We observed quite amount of false positive detections. We removed the false positive and predicted the eye corners. Our classifiers able to detect and locate the ‘en’ and the ‘ex’ in 59 out of 60 test images. Our results show accurate detection of ‘ex’ and ‘en’ craniofacial landmarks as per standard definition. The paired t-test showed that all four (4) measurements are no significant difference with the p values on 95 % confidence level are above 0. 05.

40|$|The image {{intensification}} (I sup 2) systems {{studied for}} this report were the <b>biocular</b> AN/PVS- 7 (NVG) and the binocular AN/AVS- 6 (ANVIS). Both are quite impressive for purposes of revealing {{the structure of the}} environment in a fairly straightforward way in extremely low-light conditions. But these systems represent an unusual viewing medium. The perceptual information available through I sup 2 systems is different {{in a variety of ways}} from the typical input of everyday vision, and extensive training and practice is required for optimal use. Using this sort of system involves a kind of perceptual skill learning, but is may also involve visual adaptations that are not simply an extension of normal vision. For example, the visual noise evident in the goggles in very low-light conditions results in unusual statistical properties in visual input. Because we had recently discovered a strong and enduring aftereffect of perceived texture density which seemed to be sensitive to precisely the sorts of statistical distortions introduced by I sup 2 systems, it occurred to use that visual noise of this sort might be a very adapting stimulus for texture density and produce an aftereffect that extended into normal vision once the goggles were removed. We have not found any experimental evidence that I sup 2 systems produce texture density aftereffects. The nature of the texture density aftereffect is briefly explained, followed by an accounting of our studies of I sup 2 systems and our most recent work on the texture density aftereffect. A test for spatial frequency adaptation after exposure to NVG's is also reported, as is a study of perceived depth from motion (motion parallax) while wearing the <b>biocular</b> goggles.

Participants of differing visuo-spatial ability learned about human abdominal organs via anatomical three-dimensional (3 D) reconstructions using either a stereoptic study phase (involving stereopsis and interactivity) or using a <b>biocular</b> study phase that involved neither stereopsis nor interactivity. Subsequent tests assessed the acquired knowledge in tasks involving (a) identification of anatomical structures in anatomical 2 D cross-sections (i. e. typical Computed Tomography pictures) in an identification task, and (b) localization of these cross-sections in a frontal view of the anatomy in a localization task. The results show that the stereoptic group performed significantly better on both tasks and that participants of low visuo-spatial ability benefited more from the stereoptic study phase than those of high visuo-spatial ability. ...|$|E

In the current study information about normal sex-related dimensions of the orbital region, and growth, development and aging, were provided. The three-dimensional coordinates of several soft-tissue landmarks on the orbits and face were obtained by a non-invasive, computerized electromagnetic digitizer in 531 male and 357 female healthy subjects aged 4 - 73 years. From the landmarks, <b>biocular</b> and intercanthal widths, paired height and inclination of the orbit relative to both the true horizontal (head in natural head position) and Frankfurt plane, length and inclination of the eye fissure, the relevant ratios, soft-tissue orbital area, were calculated, and averaged for age and sex. Comparisons were performed by factorial analysis of variance. <b>Biocular</b> and intercanthal widths, length of the eye fissure, soft-tissue orbital area, and the inclination of the orbit relative to the true horizontal, were significantly larger in men than in women (p < 0. 01), with a significant effect of age (p < 0. 001), and significant age × sex interactions (p < 0. 001). Orbital height, and the height-to-width ratio increased as a function of age (p < 0. 001), but without gender-related differences. The inclination of the orbit relative to Frankfurt plane, and the inclination of the eye fissure did not differ between men and women, but modified as a function of age (p < 0. 001), with different sex-related patterns (sex × age interaction, p < 0. 001). On average, the paired measurements were symmetric, with similar values within each sex and age group. Overall, when compared to literature data, some differences were found due to both ethnicity, and different instruments. Nevertheless, during childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood, the age-related trends for linear dimensions were similar to those found in previous studies, while no previous data exist for older adults. During aging an increment in soft-tissue orbital area was found, with a progressive downward shift of landmark orbitale. Data collected in the present investigation could serve as a data base for the quantitative description of human orbital morphology during normal growth, development and aging. Forensic applications (evaluations of traumas, craniofacial alterations, teratogenic-induced conditions, facial reconstruction, aging of living and dead persons, personal identification) may also benefit from age- and sex-based data banks. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} {{established}} advantages of binocular over monocular vision, including increased contrast sensitivity arising {{as a result}} of binocular summation. However, there remains inadequate understanding regarding several aspects of binocular summation. The present study sought greater understanding of factors potentially broadening, or limiting, the extent to which binocular summation explanations can be applied. In particular, binocular summation effects have not been adequately investigated within the context of external visual displays presenting dynamic noise. The present study investigated whether dichoptic viewing of a signal in uncorrelated visual noise conditions confers a perceptual advantage over that in correlated noise in visual detection and discrimination tasks. A repeated-measures design was utilized, manipulating noise type and level of noise correlation presented through a head-worn display device. The dynamic externally presented noise included characteristics resembling night vision goggle (NVG) noise, while levels of correlation emulated the physical image configuration of NVG device types (binocular and <b>biocular).</b> An adaptive 1 -up/ 2 -down staircase procedure was used to obtain contrast sensitivity threshold estimates.

40|$|The major {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the possible effects of common genetic and environmental factors among 18 craniofacial anthropometric traits, with special attention to the differences between skeletal and soft-tissue related phenotypes. The studied sample consisted of 122 nuclear families living in Brussels and included 251 males and 258 females aged from 13 to 72 years. Univariate and bivariate quantitative genetic analyses were performed using a variance components procedure implemented in SOLAR software. All phenotypes were significantly influenced by additive genetic factors with heritability estimates ranging from 0. 46 (nose height) to 0. 72 (external <b>biocular</b> breadth). Sex, age and their interactions explained 7 - 46 % of the total phenotypic variance of the traits. Bivariate analysis revealed that several traits share a common genetic and/or environmental basis while other traits show genetic and environmental independence from one another. More and greater genetic and environmental correlations were observed among skeletal phenotypes, than among soft-tissue traits and between both categories. Apart from the tissue composition, other characteristics of the craniofacial morphology such as the orientation (e. g. heights, breadths) have shown to be important factors in determining pleiotropy and common environmental effects between some pairs of traits. In conclusion, the results confirm that overall head configuration is largely determined by additive genetic effects, and that common genetic and environmental factors affecting craniofacial size and shape are stronger for the skeletal traits than for the soft-tissue traits. 2010 Elsevier GmbH.

Further studies on the use of colour, as a rehabilitative intervention in low vision would therefore be useful. A series of objective, subject based, age-similar controlled experiments were used to address the primary aims. Trends in some of the ARMD data suggested better reading performance with blue or green illuminance but there were also some individuals who performed better with yellow, or with illuminance of reduced intensity. Statistically, better reading in general occurred with a specialised yellow photochromic lens and also a clear lens than with a fixed lens or a neutral density filter. No reading advantage was gained from using the coloured screen facility of a video-magnifier. Some subjects with low vision were found to have co-existent binocular vision anomalies, which may have caused reading difficulties similar to those produced by ARMD.

Premature closure of the metopic suture results in deformation of the anterior calvarium, in the phenotypic features of trigonocephaly Trigonocephalic deformities are recognized because of a pathognomic ‘keel-shaped' deformity of the forehead with a prominent midline ridge, bilateral frontotemporal constriction with compensatory biparietal expansion, supraorbital and lateral orbital retrusion and hypotelorism. 1 This article presents a surgical technique used over 5 years to treat trigonocephalic children. Retrospective analyses were performed on 9 patients with metopic synostosis treated during 2005 - 2010. The study included reviews of preoperative and postoperative computed tomography scans, operative techniques, clinical outcomes and complications. Operative techniques included fronto-orbital bandeau tilting after expansion with a midline interpositional -bone graft, detriangulation of foreheads with an inward bending at lateral orbital wall, multiple zigzag osteotomy of frontal bone, barrel-stave osteotomy of parietal bone. The {{average age of the}} patients at time of surgery was 11 months.

One hundred and nine subjects participated in this research, 54 Malay men and 55 Malay women, aged 20 - 30 years old with healthy BMI and with no adverse skeletal deviation. Twenty-three facial landmarks were identified on 3 D facial images captured using a VECTRA M 5 - 360 Head System (Canfield Scientific Inc, USA). Two angular, 3 ratio and 17 linear measurements were identified using Canfield Mirror imaging software. Intra- and inter-examiner reliability tests were carried out using 10 randomly selected images, analyzed using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was carried out to investigate morphologic differences between genders. ICC scores were generally good for both intra-examiner (range 0. 827 - 0. 987) and inter-examiner reliability (range 0. 700 - 0. 983) tests. Generally, all facial measurements were larger in men than women, except the facial profile angle which was larger in women. Clinically significant gender dimorphisms existed in <b>biocular</b> width, nose height, nasal bridge length, face height and lower face height values (mean difference > 3 mm).

40|$|Introduction: This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to establish the}} craniofacial anthropometric norms of young adult Malaysian Malays. Methods: The study group consisted of convenient samples of 100 healthy volunteers (aged 18 - 25 years), with {{an equal number of}} female and male subjects who had no history of mixed racial parentage. 22 linear measurements were taken twice from 22 landmarks over six craniofacial regions. Results: The Malays shared many similar sizes of measurements with the Singaporean Chinese. Their left eye fissure length and mouth width (ch-ch) were almost identical for both genders. However, Malay females had an upper lip height (sn-sto) (left) and ear width (pra-pa) similar to Singaporean Chinese females. Six other measurements, viz. the head width (eu-eu), head circumference (on-op), face height (n-gn), lower face height (sn-gn), (left) eye fissure height (ps-pi), cutaneous upper lip height (sn-ls) and cutaneous upper lip height (ls-sto), were 0. 4 - 4. 3 mm less in the Malays. Measurements for another four parameters, viz. the length of the head (g-op), <b>biocular</b> width (ex-ex), lower vermillion height (sto-li) and (left) ear length (sa-sba), were 0. 5 - 3. 6 mm higher in the Malays. Only three measurements were obviously different; the height of the head (vn) and intercanthal width (en-en), were lower, and the protrusion of the nasal tip (sn-prn) was higher in the Malays. Conclusion: These findings suggest that three features, i. e. the height of the head (v-n), intercanthal width (en-en) and protrusion of the nasal tip (sn-prn) may be useful in differentiating a Malay face from a Singaporean Chinese one. This record was migrated from the OpenDepot repository service in June, 2017 before shutting down...|$|E
40|$|Hypohidrotic {{ectodermal}} dysplasia (HED) {{is characterized by}} clinical manifestations of severe hypodontia or anodontia, hypotrichosis, hypohidrosis, and specific facial appearance. Affected males show complete expression of clinical features of this condition. Their mothers, who are gene carriers, express only some signs, which are usually very mild. Currently available clinical methods are not sufficient for routine identification of the HED heterozygous gene carriers. The {{purpose of this study}} was to identify and describe the facial characteristics of HED patients and their mothers and to evaluate the usefulness of craniofacial pattern profile analysis (CFPP) in the diagnosis of this syndrome and the detection of gene carriers. In this study six affected males and their mothers were evaluated. Z-scores for each variable were calculated and compared with age- and sex-matched controls. Anthropometric analysis showed a specific dysmorphic pattern in CST patients that includes decreased skull base width (t-t: – 1. 67 Z); decreased forehead width (ft-ft: – 1. 8 Z), decreased midface depth (sn-t: – 2. 02 Z), markedly decreased total facial height (n-gn: – 3. 4 Z), and markedly decreased maxillary arc (t-sn-t: – 2. 5 Z). Gene carriers showed a similar tendency in their pattern profiles. They showed the same tendency towards lower Z-values for forehead width, facial height, and mouth width. The values for these measurements were between those of the affected and healthy controls. The most pronounced findings were increased head width (eu-eu: + 2. 83 Z), increased lower face width (go-go: + 2. 06 Z), and reduction of total facial height (n-gn: – 0. 95 Z). They also displayed increased nose width (al-al: + 2. 41 Z) and increased <b>biocular</b> distance (ex-ex: + 2. 01 Z). When used in conjunction with other methods the anthropometrics pattern profile analysis can considerably enhance detection of gene carriers for HED and increase objective assessment of the craniofacial region in HED patients...|$|E
40|$|Estudos investigativos sobre a influência da hereditariedade nas fissuras orofaciais têm sugerido que indivíduos não-afetados com filhos portadores de fissura labiopalatina apresentam morfologia craniofacial distinta da população geral. O objetivo desta pesquisa foi, por meio de antropometria direta da face, estudar as dimensões faciais dos pais de fissurados em relação a indivíduos sem histórico {{familiar}} de fissura, com a finalidade de determinar características faciais que possam inferir uma predisposição à fissura. A amostra foi constituída por 244 indivíduos leucodermas, com média de idade de 34, 1 anos, sendo 50 pais e 94 mães de crianças com fissura de lábio com ou sem envolvimento do palato, registrados na Faculdade de Odontologia da Universidade de São Paulo, formando o grupo de estudo, que foi subdividido em grupo pais, grupo mães e grupo casal; e 50 homens e 50 mulheres com ausência de história familiar de anomalias craniofaciais, compondo o grupo controle. Após a marcação de pontos antropométricos na face, foram realizadas 38 medidas antropométricas, correspondendo às dimensões faciais de altura, largura e profundidade, com auxílio de paquímetro digital e compasso facial. Para a análise estatística foi utilizado o teste t de Student com correção de Levene para igualdade de variâncias. Os resultados estatisticamente significantes, para o grupo pais, foram: largura da testa; largura da face e distâncias inter-orbital interna e externa menores, enquanto que a largura da base do nariz, a altura do perfil inferior e a profundidade da mandíbula do lado esquerdo foram maiores. No grupo mães, a distância pupila-linha média lado direito, a largura da base do nariz, a largura do nariz, a largura anatômica do nariz, a largura da columela, a altura do terço superior da face e a profundidade da mandíbula do lado esquerdo apresentaram-se maiores. Os resultados do grupo casal foram pouco consistentes porque reproduziram os registrados nos subgrupos individuais. Embora diversas medidas tenham mostrado diferenças entre o grupo de estudo e o controle, apenas a largura da base do nariz e a profundidade da mandíbula do lado esquerdo se apresentam com as dimensões aumentadas nas respectivas subdivisões: pais, mães e casal. Concluiu-se que, pais e mães de crianças portadoras de fissuras labiopalatinas apresentam morfologia craniofacial distinta em relação à população geral; entretanto, não foi possível definir um padrão facial característico. Recent studies {{concerning the}} influence of inheritance in orofacial clefts suggest that non-affected parents of children that present cleft lip and palate show distinctive craniofacial morphology compared to the overall population. The main objective {{of this research was}} to analyze and compare the facial dimensions of non-affected parents of affected children and individuals with no history of clefting in the family. The method used was the direct facial anthropometry, since it can determine facial characteristics that may be related to predisposition to cleft. The sample used comprised 244 leukoderms, averaging 34, 1 years old, registered at the Dentistry School of the University of São Paulo. The sample was divided in study group and control group. The study group was composed of 50 fathers and 94 mothers of children affected by cleft lip and/or palate and was sub-divided in three sub-groups: fathers, mothers and couples. The control group was composed of 50 man and 50 women with no history of craniofacial anomalies. To evaluate the distinctive facial dimensions, a set of 38 anthropometric measurements were made using a sliding caliper and a spreading caliper to determine the length, width and depth. For statistical analysis the Student t test was used with Leveneś correction for equal variances. The statistically significant results were: - Fathers group: smaller width of the forehead; smaller width of the face; smaller intercanthal width and <b>biocular</b> width as well as larger width of the nasal root, larger height of the lower profile and larger depth of the left lower jaw. - Mothers group: larger pupil-facial midline right distance, larger width of the nasal root, larger width of the nose, larger width between the facial insertion points of the alar base, larger width of the columella, larger height of the upper profile and larger depth of the left lower jaw. For the parents group, no statistical differences were identified, with results similar to the other two study groups. Although several measurements showed differences from the study group to the control group only width of nasal root and depth of the left lower jaw showed bigger dimensions in the three subgroups, fathers, mothers and couples. In conclusion, this study showed that fathers and mothers of children with cleft lip and palate show different craniofacial morphology compared to the overall population, but it was impossible to delineate a pattern...|$|E
