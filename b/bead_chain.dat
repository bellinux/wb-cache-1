In the dual-polarity images, the parallel, registry-aligned NWs are well resolved. The empty-state image clearly shows that the rounded protrusions of the double <b>bead</b> <b>chains</b> in Figure  3 b convert to pentagons and the bean chain becomes a trench. However, the pentagons in {{the left and right}} <b>bead</b> <b>chains</b> are oppositely oriented, similar to the orientation of the Si pentagon pair (Figure  1 c). In the filled-state image, each 3 -NW appears to comprise two chains of tetramers with the opposite orientation at both sides, similar to the orientation of the Si tetramer pair (Figure  1 d), and a bean chain at the middle of the NW. Moreover, the contrast of these double tetramer chains is lower than that of the bean chain. Notice that the dark trench in Figure  3 c inverts to the bright bean chains in Figure  3 d when the bias polarity is reversed. The polarity dependence of these STM images clearly reveals that each 3 -NW consists of a bundle of three chain structures with a charge modulation of alternating filled and empty states, indicating a pronounced ionicity of the chains [35]. These results strongly suggest that the Si pentagon/tetramer pair on the upper terraces of the 16 [*]×[*] 2 reconstruction (Figure  1 c,d) is split into two individual Si pentagons/tetramers upon Ce adsorption due to the preferential reactivity of Ce atoms with the Si pentagon pair on the upper terraces (Figure  2 a), thereby leading to the formation of a bean chain at the middle of the 3 -NWs.|$|R

40|$|A {{simple and}} fast {{numerical}} method is developed capable of accurately determining the 3 D rotational dynamics of a magnetic particle chain in an infinite fluid domain. The focus is {{to control the}} alternating breakup and reformation of the <b>bead</b> <b>chain</b> which we believe is essential to achieve effective fluid mixing at small scales. The numerical scheme makes use of magnetic dipole moments and extended forms of the Oseen-Burgers tensor to account for both the magnetic and hydrodynamic interactions between the particles. It is shown that the inclusion of hydrodynamic interaction between the particles is crucial to obtain a good description of the particle dynamics. Only a small error of deviation is observed when benchmarking the numerical scheme against a more computationally intensive method, the direct simulation method. The numerical results are compared with experiments and the simulated rotational dynamics correspond well with those obtained from video-microscopy experiments qualitatively and quantitatively. In addition, a dimensionless number (R_T) is derived as the sole control parameter for the rotational <b>bead</b> <b>chain</b> dynamics.

The modelled chains develop an anti-symmetric S-shape that is stable, if the Mason number for a given chain length does not surpass a critical value. Above that value, rupture occurs {{in the vicinity of the}} chain centre. However, variations in bead susceptibility can shift the location of rupture. Moreover, we performed experiments with superparamagnetic micro-beads in a small fluid volume exposed to a uniform rotating magnetic field. Our simulation could successfully predict the observed transient chain form and the time for chain rupture. The developed model can be used to design optimised bead based mixers in micro fluidic systems...|$|R

40|$|We {{show that}} the {{statistical}} properties of a vibrated granular <b>bead</b> <b>chain</b> are similar to standard models of polymers in equilibrium. Granular chains of length up to N= 1024 beads were confined within a circular vibrating bed, and their configurations were imaged. To differentiate the effects of persistence and confinement on the chain, we compared with simulations of both persistent random-walk (RW) and self-avoiding walk (SAW) models. Static properties, such as the radius of gyration and structure factor, are governed for short chains (N≤ 128) by persistence and can be matched by those of RWs. Self-avoidance and confinement effects are both important for longer chains {{and the results are}} well described by equilibrated SAWs. We also find that the collective dynamics of the granular chain is similar to the Rouse model of polymers. In particular, as long as confinement is negligible, the center of mass of the chain diffuses with a diffusion coefficient that scales as 1 /N, and the dynamic structure factor decays exponentially in time.

40|$|The {{quest for}} {{designing}} new self-propelled colloids is fuelled by {{the demand for}} simple experimental models to study the collective behaviour of their more complex natural counterparts. Most synthetic self-propelled particles move by converting the input energy into translational motion. In this work we address the question if simple self-propelled spheres can assemble into more complex structures that exhibit rotational motion, possibly coupled with translational motion as in flagella. We exploit a combination of induced dipolar interactions and a bonding step to create permanent linear <b>bead</b> <b>chains,</b> composed of self-propelled Janus spheres, with a well-controlled internal structure. Next, we study how flexibility between individual swimmers in a chain can affect its swimming behaviour. Permanent rigid chains showed only active rotational or spinning motion, whereas longer semi-flexible chains showed both translational and rotational motion resembling flagella like-motion, {{in the presence of}} the fuel. Moreover, we are able to reproduce our experimental results using numerical calculations with a minimal model, which includes full hydrodynamic interactions with the fluid. Our method is general and opens a new way to design novel self-propelled colloids with complex swimming behaviours, using different complex starting building blocks in combination with the flexibility between them.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a novel {{approach}} to enhance the sensitivity of microfluidic biosensor platforms with self-assembled magnetic bead chains. An adjustable, more than 5 -fold sensitivity enhancement is achieved by introducing a magnetic field gradient along a microfluidic channel {{by means of a}} soft-magnetic lattice with a 350 μm spacing. The alternating magnetic field induces the self-assembly of the magnetic beads in chains or clusters and thus improves the perfusion and active contact between the analyte and the beads. The soft-magnetic lattices can be applied independent of the channel geometry or chip material to any microfluidic biosensing platform. At the same time, the bead-based approach achieves chip reusability and shortened measurement times.

40|$|All {{biological}} macromolecules (DNA, RNA, proteins, polysaccarids) are polymers. These {{are extremely}} complex systems, with thousands or millions of atomic degrees of freedom. However, {{a range of}} important properties of such systems do {{not depend on the}} detailed atomic structure, but on geometrical structure on a much larger length scale. Rheological properties [1, 2, 3] as well as properties related to rotational diffusion [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] of whole molecules are important examples. This justifies the use of coarse graining models, where exible coils with a continous stiffness distribution [10], chains of beads [1, 11, 2, 12] or chains of stiff segments [13, 14, 15, 16, 17] are used to represent the molecule. While simple compared to a model with detailed descriptions of positions and motions of individual atoms of a molecule, the mathematical complexity of these models is still significant, and only a few special cases can be solved analytically [2]. Numerical simulation techniques are thus important tools in the study of polymer systems [18]. This introduction first presents a general background and motivation for Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations of polymer systems (Sections 2 - 3). Then an overview of BD algorithms for the bead-spring and bead-rod polymer models are given (Section 4). While the resulting algorithms presented are equal to those presented in the literature [18, 19], a slightly different path is followed while deriving the algorithms.

40|$|Abstract. We {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} shape anisotropy and number density on the dynamics of granular rods on a substrate with experiments using a mono-layer of <b>bead</b> <b>chains</b> in a vibrated container. Statistical measures of the translational and rotational degrees of freedom indicate a dramatic slowing down of dynamics because of steric interactions at a value well below the highest packing fraction of the chains. In particular, the in-plane orientation auto-correlation function decays exponentially with time at low densities, but increasingly slowly as density is increased with a form which is not described by a simple exponential function. While the mean square displacement of the chain center of mass is observed to grow linearly at low densities, it is observed to grow increasingly slowly and non-linearly as number density is increased. Decomposing the displacements parallel and perpendicular to the long axis of the chain, {{we find that the}} ratio of diffusion in the parallel and perpendicular direction to their long axis is less than one in the dilute regime. However, as the density of the chains is increased, the ratio rapidly increases above one with a greater value for higher aspect ratios. This anisotropic behavior can be explained by considering a higher effective drag on the rods by the substrate in the perpendicular direction compared with the parallel direction, and by tube-like dynamics at higher densities. ...|$|R
