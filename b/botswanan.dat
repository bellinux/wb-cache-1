5|$|Today, many {{wildebeest}} {{populations are}} experiencing rapid declines. Overland migration as a biological process requires large connected landscapes, which are {{increasingly difficult to}} maintain, particularly over the long term, when human demands on the landscape compete. The most acute threat comes from migration barriers, such as fences and roads. In {{one of the more}} striking examples of the consequences of fence-building on terrestrial migrations, <b>Botswanan</b> authorities placed thousands of kilometres of fences across the Kalahari that prevented wildebeests from reaching watering holes and grazing grounds, resulting in the deaths {{of tens of thousands of}} individuals, reducing the wildebeest population to less than 10% of its previous size. Illegal hunting is a major conservation concern in many areas, along with natural threats posed by main predators (such as lions, leopards, hunting dogs and hyenas). Where the black and blue wildebeest share a common range, the two can hybridise, and this is regarded as a potential threat to the black wildebeest.|$|E

500|$|In Botswana, {{which is}} home to {{almost half of the}} {{elephants}} in Africa, officials are opposed to destroying ivory stockpiles , and President Ian Khama publicly boycotted the 2016 Kenyan burn. <b>Botswanan</b> officials believe that burning tusks communicates that the animal does not have value. Instead, confiscated goods like ivory and rhinoceros horns are displayed to symbolize the value of wildlife conservation. An example of this was the 2015 unveiling of an elephant statue, made entirely of ivory tusks, at the country's main international airport in Gaborone.|$|E

40|$|Climate change poses serious {{challenges}} and takes centre {{stage in the}} global agenda as an issue calling for corporate strategies and appropriate measures by countries, communities, and individuals. The United Nations and other actors are responding to the challenge with the major focus {{on the development of}} strategies, and policy framework. These approaches set standards for relevant and contextualized countryâ€™s specific approaches to attain sustainable community-climate related livelihoods. On this premises, this review is pre-occupied with Climate Change and Poverty as it concerns Botswana and the African Continent. It was revealed from the study that current trends indicate that <b>Botswanans</b> are gradually shifting from crop production and livestock to tourism partly due to drought related losses. Therefore, there is need for widespread Climate Change Community Education (CCCE) and intensified advocacy at all levels of government in Botswana and the African Continent...|$|R
