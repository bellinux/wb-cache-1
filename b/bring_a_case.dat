5|$|Before {{the passing}} of the 1963 Act, the only {{exceptions}} to the normal statute of limitations (three years after the events that caused the injury, as established by the Law Reform (Limitation of Actions, etc.) Act 1954) were if the claim was being brought for a case of mistake or fraud, in which case the statute of limitations was twelve months from when the claimant could reasonably have been expected to discover the fraud or mistake. In Cartledge v E. Jopling & Sons Ltd the claimant sued Jopling after he developed pneumoconiosis from working in the company's poorly ventilated steel mills. The injuries were sustained in October 1950 but they were not discovered until 1956, and as a result the injured party had no cause of action. Because the injuries had not been discovered until six years after they were caused, and the statute of limitations was three years after the injury itself, Cartledge was not legally allowed to <b>bring</b> <b>a</b> <b>case.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998 (c.23) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom {{that protects}} whistleblowers from {{detrimental}} treatment by their employer. Influenced by various financial scandals and accidents, {{along with the}} report of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, the bill was introduced to Parliament by Richard Shepherd and given government support, on the condition that it become an amendment to the Employment Rights Act 1996. After receiving the Royal Assent on 2 July 1998, the Act came into force on 2 July 1999. It protects employees who make disclosures of certain types of information, including evidence of illegal activity or damage to the environment, from retribution from their employers, such as dismissal or being passed over for promotion. In cases where such retribution takes place the employee may <b>bring</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> before an employment tribunal, which can award compensation.|$|E
25|$|The way {{to enforce}} a claim for unfair {{dismissal}} is at an employment tribunal. An employee who is dismissed may also have breach of contract claim(s), based on common law.

25|$|An Irish {{government}} sub-committee {{was then}} established {{to consider the}} Barron Report and make recommendations. These recommendations (which are outlined below) were published in March 2004. It recommended the Irish Government <b>bring</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> before the European Court of Human Rights to force the British Government to hold a public inquiry into the bombings. In June 2005, the Irish Government said it would consider bringing the British Government to the European Court of Justice, to force the release the files on the bombings.|$|E

In 2005, the Irish Government threatened to bring the British government to the European Court of Justice, to force it to release its files on the bombings. British Prime Minister Tony Blair said there was not enough evidence to justify a public inquiry.|$|E

It also required all union officers to sign an affidavit {{that they were not}} Communists in order for the union to <b>bring</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> before the NLRB. This affidavit requirement, later declared unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court, was the first sign of serious trouble ahead for a number of Communists in the CIO.|$|E

25|$|Anthony Crane {{appears to}} have been {{associated}} with religious reform as early as 1572, and after his death in 1583, Elizabeth Crane continued to assist Puritan writers and printers. According to the later testimony of her servant, Nicholas Tompkins, when the Puritan printer Robert Waldegrave's press and type were being destroyed by officers of the Stationers' Company in May 1588 {{as a result of his}} having printed John Udall's The State of the Church of England Laid Open, commonly referred to as Diotrephes' Dialogue, she allowed Waldegrave to <b>bring</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> of type, hidden under his cloak, to her London home in St Mary Aldermanbury. The Puritan preacher and pamphleteer John Penry secretly obtained a new press for Waldegrave, and in the late spring of 1588 she allowed Penry and Waldegrave to set it up at her country home at East Molesey, Surrey, across the Thames from Hampton Court Palace. The first tract to be printed on the secret press was Udall's Demonstration of Discipline.|$|E

25|$|It {{subsequently}} {{emerged that}} Mikel had travelled to London with his agent John Shittu, {{who was working}} for Jerome Anderson's SEM group. Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson considered travelling to Oslo to visit Mikel, but decided against this after Mikel {{was reported to have}} left the country. Staying in a London hotel and some nine days after disappearing, Mikel stated on Sky Sports News that he had been pressured into signing the contract with United without his agent present, claims furiously rebuffed by both Manchester United and Lyn. Mikel told the British media that Chelsea were the club he genuinely wanted to sign for. In response to these events, United made an official complaint to FIFA about the behaviour of both Chelsea and the player's agents, Shittu and Rune Hauge, already infamous {{for his role in the}} George Graham bungs scandal. FIFA dismissed these claims in August 2005, stating there was insufficient evidence to <b>bring</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> against Chelsea.|$|E

5000|$|Criminal {{enforcement}} is largely private in Ancient Rome; unlike today, {{there is no}} public system of enforcement, such as a prosecuting attorney ostensibly <b>bringing</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> {{on behalf of the}} community (e.g., People vs. _______, or Crown vs. ________.)

500|$|The Great Charter was {{referred}} to in legal cases throughout the medieval period. For example, in 1226, the knights of Lincolnshire argued that their local sheriff was changing customary practice regarding the local courts, [...] "contrary to their liberty which {{they ought to have}} by the charter of the lord king". In practice, cases were not brought against the King for breach of Magna Carta and the Forest Charter, but it was possible to <b>bring</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> against the King's officers, such as his sheriffs, using the argument that the King's officers were acting contrary to liberties granted by the King in the charters.|$|E
500|$|The Act created {{exceptions}} to the normal statute of limitations {{in addition to the}} previous ones of fraud and mistake. It introduced an exception if 1) the permission of the court had been gained to <b>bring</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> and 2) the [...] "material facts" [...] of the case included [...] "facts of a decisive character" [...] which the claimant was not aware of until after the expiry of the statute of limitations. Where these two requirements were fulfilled, a case could be brought {{as long as it was}} within twelve months of the claimant finding out the [...] "facts of a decisive character". The same principles applied if the injured party were dead and the claim was being brought on behalf of his estate or dependants. If leave was refused to open a case, the decision could be appealed up to the Court of Appeal of England and Wales, but no further.|$|E

500|$|Exchequer {{business}} increased under James and Charles I, {{before the}} English Civil War disrupted the courts. With the {{increasing use of}} the Writ of Quominus, which allowed royal debtors to <b>bring</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> against a third party who owed them money if it was that lack of money which prevented them paying the king and the new regime, the Exchequer actively transformed from a [...] "tax court" [...] dealing with civil cases to a dedicated court of equity and common law. The Civil War caused four equitable courts to be dissolved; the Court of Star Chamber was formally dissolved in 1641, the Council of the North and Council of Wales and the Marches had their equity jurisdiction stripped by the same Act of Parliament, and the Court of Requests became invalid after the Privy Seal was invalidated by the outcome of the English Civil War, as it was dependent on the Seal for its authority. After the War ended there were only two equity courts remaining, the Exchequer and Court of Chancery, the latter publicly reviled for its slow pace and because it was led by the Lord Chancellor, a political figure who had been intimately involved in the conflict. As a result, the Exchequer increased in importance as a court, although it is not known whether its active transformation was a judicial or political decision.|$|E

In the Democratic Republic of Congo the Family Code states that the husband {{is the head of the}} household; the wife owes her obedience to her husband; a wife has to live with her husband wherever he chooses to live; and wives must have their husbands' authorization to <b>bring</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> in court or to initiate other legal proceedings.|$|E

The two eventually have a son called Sundhu who also helps in his father's work in solving crimes.|$|R
50|$|Subdivision (a) {{provides}} for automatic disclosure, which first was added in 1993.
