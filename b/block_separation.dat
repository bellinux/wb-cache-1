Using immunofluorescence microscopy, we show that in mammalian cells the Skp 1 protein and the cullin Cul 1 are localized to interphase and mitotic centrosomes and to the cytoplasm and nucleus.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{problems}} in the Ukrainian dimension stone sector is the distribution problem. A typical quarry exploits up to 1000 – 1500 m 3 /y of trade blocks. Thus, {{it is very difficult}} to perform a standard foreign order of 500 - 1000 m 3. This is often due to improper exploitation technique planning and management. The aim of the study is to identify the best exploitation technique for the Ukrainian shield conditions in terms of the highest technical and economic applicability. The data were collected at several Ukrainian and Italian quarries. Performance data of dimension stone exploitation techniques was measured in order to determine which of them are the most economic and the least labour-intensive. Unit costs for the monolith explosive separation (using detonating cord) are more than 3 times lower than the use of the combination of diamond wire sawing and dynamic splitting in terms of 1 m 3 of trade blocks. The combination of diamond wire saw with «hydrorocksplitters» is slightly cheaper; it justifies its widespread use in Ukrainian quarries. To preserve the rock mass integrity and block surface quality all of the techniques are suitable. Among the tipping techniques the use of wheel loaders is disseminating nowadays. Hydraulic jacks are used at this stage sometimes. <b>Block</b> <b>separation</b> on trade units is often carried out by splitting with manual or hydraulic wedges.

These activities were carried out for the Airport Unit (AP) of the Centre of Expertise for Air Traffic Management (CoE/AT) of EUROCONTROL. As part of this research, two candidate concepts, Virtual <b>Block</b> Control and <b>Separation</b> Bubbles, have been evaluated in real-time cockpit simulator trials in the Generic Cockpit Simulator GECO of DLR in Braunschweig in May 2009. Virtual <b>Blocks</b> and <b>Separation</b> Bubbles are simple and low cost additions to the A-SMGCS surveillance function. They are aimed to increase airport throughput capacity in low visibility in a safe way. During the cockpit trials, pilots from major airlines taxied in the GECO within a simulated Rotterdam Airport environment. Aircraft were under control of a pseudo-controller applying Virtual Block Control with support of Separation Bubble Alerting. The main objective of the cockpit trials was {{to find out about}} the perception of the described procedures by pilots when taxiing under low visibility conditions. Different options for markings on the taxiways that are meant to support pilots in identifying the positions of virtual holding points were also investigated. The trials revealed that the concepts work down to the lowest visibility at which taxiing is possible at all. Pilots favoured Virtual Block Control supported by Intermediate Holding Lights as markings for holding positions and supported by Separation Bubbles as the best solution...|$|R
