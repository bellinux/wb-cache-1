The aim of the CAB system is to save the time that is normally spent in moving the foot from the accelerator to the brake pedal. It is asserted that in an emergency situation either the accident risk or the serious outcome of an accident can be reduced by the gain in time. This paper investigates whether the literature regarding this assertion is indeed correct. The paper provides statements about the real road safety gain caused by the CAB system. It is concluded that the literature used gives a clear indication that a further road safety improvement is possible by shortening the brake reaction time.

In traditional, many researchers focused on the vehicle dynamics which employ the static characteristic of brake system to analysis the vehicle brake capacity. In fact, the practical performance of air brake system may be greatly different from the static theory. Thus, it is necessary to build an integrate air brake system model to simulate the process of brake accurately. Also, some works focused on the dynamic characteristics of brake system have been completed, but it is not comprehensive without the considering the effect of vehicle dynamics. In this paper, a completely air brake system dynamic model is built, where the air brake system contains pneumatic subsystem and mechanical subsystem. The air brake system is embedded in a heavy truck dynamic model which contains three axles.

Such crashes are more likely to take place during the evening or at dawn (crash proportion: ‘ 0 : 00 – 6 : 00 ’ =  35.01 and 32.55  %; and ‘ 20 : 00 – 24 : 00 ’ =  16.14 and 18.44  %), presumably due to the higher level of sleepiness and fatigue associated with human circadian rhythm during these periods. Additionally, a majority of the surveyed crashes took place on weekdays (79.66 and 82.67  %), but not on public holidays (96.53 and 97.88  %). In particular, truck crashes caused by driving fatigue occurred more frequently under adverse weather conditions (31.61 and 23.17  %), such as wet pavements (33.34 and 31.52  %) and decreased visibility (27.48 and 16.47  %), due to the increased <b>brake</b> <b>distance</b> on slippery pavements. Furthermore, winter and summer demonstrate the highest prevalence of fatigue related truck crashes, and each of these two seasons account for more than 30  % of the total crashes for each province.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Magneto-rheological fluids {{are smart}} fluids {{displaying}} flow properties {{that can be}} adjusted {{by the introduction of}} magnetic fields. Conventional brakes require complex mechanical parts to dissipate energy, they are having more weight, produce less braking torque and the time of response is about 300 - 500 milliseconds and hence <b>brake</b> <b>distance</b> is high. A Magneto-rheological fluid brake is efficient than conventional braking system in terms of the weight reduction, and response time. In this paper MR fluid is prepard and an improved MRB design is made, taking into account the temperature effects and more accurate description of the material properties as well. The proposed work is concerned with {{the development of a new}} Brake-by-wire system which employs MRF as working medium. The design procedure comprises the selection of materials for MRB, creating an analytical model for finding the braking torque produced by the MRB and Finite Element Analysis of the MRB. Finite element models are built to provide a means to analyze the performance of the magneto-rheological brake system. The formulation of these models (including the definition of the geometry, material properties, boundary conditions and meshing process, as well as necessary assumptions) are described. The results obtained with the finite element models are presented and analyzed using COMSOL Multiphysics 4. ...|$|E

40|$|In a {{conventional}} {{anti-lock brake system}} (ABS) the basic control algorithm {{is a combination of}} wheel acceleration/deceleration control and the wheel slip control. This control algorithm depends on the pre-configured threshold values that vary for each braking scenario which requires a large amount of field testing to achieve the best performance. In addition to that, the unpredictable nature of the driving conditions results in limitations not only in tracking the desired slip value within an acceptable range but also in the maximization of the friction force. In this work, a robust ABS algorithm based on Sliding Mode Control (SMC) technique is introduced. It is shown that regardless of uncertainties in the driving conditions the friction force is maximized and the stability of the vehicle is maintained resulting in a shorter <b>brake</b> <b>distance</b> and a better steer ability. For that purpose a self optimization method that calculates the desired slip value and a wheel slip controller to track this slip value are mainly proposed.

In this project the proposed system is analyzed and tested in a vehicle simulator to provide more realistic results.

40|$|Road {{safety is}} a very {{important}} topic for research and development divisions in the automotive industry. As the tyre is the only link between road surface and vehicle, it plays a very significant role in accident mitigation and prevention. This thesis investigates the influence of internal tyre pressure on the <b>brake</b> <b>distance</b> both experimentally and theoretically. Brake tests were performed using a robotic system and a winch was used to pull a car with locked wheels. For both experiments, the tyre pressures were changed. A rubber friction law is presented which can be used for tyre and vehicle dynamics calculations. The friction law was tested by comparing numerical results to the full rubber friction theory of Persson and to experimental data. A two-dimensional (2 D) tyre model is introduced that combines the rubber friction law with a simple mass-spring description of the tyre body. The tyre model is very flexible and can be applied to different manoeuvres. It can be used to calculate μ-slip curves, self aligning-torque, braking, and cornering, or combined motion (e. g. braking during cornering). The theoretical predictions have been compared to measured data from indoor tyre testing on sandpaper substrate. Additionally simulations of anti-lock braking system (ABS) using two different control algorithms are presented. In addition a method for rapidly changing the tyre inflation pressure while a vehicle is in motion is presented. This method can be used for novel safety system approaches...|$|E
40|$|Anti-lock Brake System (ABS) is {{an active}} safety system {{nowadays}} implemented in every new car and could prevent the wheels from locking during heavy braking. Steering becomes ineffective and the <b>brake</b> <b>distance</b> longer than necessary when the wheels are locked. ABS has reduced the amount of non-fatal crashes significantly, {{but there are still}} situations in which it can control worse than driver would himself. For example, when driving on low-friction roads. The aim in this thesis is to develop a new ABS algorithm using potentially available information about wheel forces. Data of wheel forces is currently not measured in consumer cars, but SKF is developing load sensing bearings which could be feasible for such cars. The sensor output provides more directly relevant information than wheel deceleration data does. The latter is used in current ABS technology. A novel ABS algorithm that uses both force and wheel slip measurements for control is designed. The algorithm is validated on a Simulink model consisting of Delft-Tyre, simplified actuator dynamics, (optional) sensor noise, and a quarter car model. An EKF based on the Burckhardt model acts as reference for the control algorithm. The Burckhardt model is a computationally lightweight formula and allows the EKF to be used on-line against relatively little computational cost. Friction estimation is essential in the designed ABS algorithm, as it is dependant on the road surface which is not known a priori. The designed algorithm is first assessed in a Simulink model on different road surfaces. Field tests are performed as well. They show that the combination of force and slip measurements is indeed promising. On-line estimates using the EKF are found sufficiently accurate to be used as main reference for the controller.

At this one should estimate the level of maximum longitudinal forces and <b>braking</b> <b>distance</b> size in freight cars of various lengths. Methodology. In this paper we attempt to approximate the actual diagram of braking cylinders filling with rational functions of varying degrees. In selection of coefficients in the required functions the highest values of the longitudinal forces and <b>braking</b> <b>distances</b> were used as controlled parameters. They were compared with similar values obtained as a result of experimental rides. The level of longitudinal forces and <b>braking</b> <b>distances</b> amount were evaluated by means of mathematical modeling of train longitudinal vibrations, caused by different braking modes. Findings. At mathematical modeling was assumed that the train consists of 60 uniform four-axle gondola cars, weight of 80 tons, equipped with air dispenser No. 483 included in the median operation, composite braking blocks, and one locomotive VL- 8. Train before braking has been pre-stretched.
