40|$|A {{human factors}} {{experiment}} employed a hemi-anechoic sound {{field in which}} listeners were required to localize a vehicular <b>backup</b> <b>alarm</b> warning signal (both a standard and a frequency-augmented alarm) in 360 -degrees azimuth in pink noise of 60 dBA and 90 dBA. Measures of localization performance included: (1) percentage correct localization, (2) percentage of right [...] left localization errors, (3) percentage of front-rear localization errors, and (4) localization absolute deviation in degrees from the alarm′s actual location. In summary, the data demonstrated that, with some exceptions, normal hearing listeners′ ability to localize the <b>backup</b> <b>alarm</b> in 360 -degrees azimuth did not improve when wearing augmented hearing protectors (including dichotic sound transmission earmuffs, flat attenuation earplugs, and level-dependent earplugs) as compared to when wearing conventional passive earmuffs or earplugs of the foam or flanged types. Exceptions were that in the 90 dBA pink noise, the flat attenuation earplug yielded significantly better accuracy than the polyurethane foam earplug and both the dichotic and the custom-made diotic electronic sound transmission earmuffs. However, the flat attenuation earplug showed no benefit over the standard pre-molded earplug, the arc earplug, and the passive earmuff. Confusions of front-rear alarm directions were most significant in the 90 dBA noise condition, wherein two types of triple-flanged earplugs exhibited significantly fewer front-rear confusions than either of the electronic muffs. On all measures, the diotic sound transmission earmuff resulted in the poorest localization {{of any of the}} protectors {{due to the fact that}} its single-microphone design did not enable interaural cues to be heard. Localization was consistently more degraded in the 90 dBA pink noise as compared with the relatively quiet condition of the 60 dBA pink noise. A frequency-augmented <b>backup</b> <b>alarm,</b> which incorporated 400 Hz and 4000 Hz components to exploit the benefits of interaural phase and intensity cues respectively, slightly but significantly improved localization compared with the standard, more narrow-bandwidth <b>backup</b> <b>alarm,</b> and these results have implications for the updating of <b>backup</b> <b>alarm</b> standards...|$|E
40|$|Accident and {{incident}} {{reports have}} indicated that construction workers, who comprise {{only a fraction of}} the industrial work force, suffer more fatal injuries than in any other industry. Many of these accidents and incidents involve workers being struck and run over by a reversing vehicle. During performance of their duties, construction workers are frequently in the vicinity of backup alarms mounted on a variety of vehicles, each with different backing speeds. Due to the loud ambient noise prevalent on many construction sites, workers may wear hearing protection devices, which can affect their ability to detect these backup alarms. An experiment was conducted in free-field conditions to determine the distance at which normal-hearing listeners who wore a high-attenuation earmuff could detect a standard <b>backup</b> <b>alarm</b> signal. Based on the data collected, a relationship was established between the minimum-required <b>backup</b> <b>alarm</b> detection distance and the reversing speeds for several typical vehicles...|$|E

5000|$|Alarm fatigue or alert fatigue {{occurs when}} one is exposed to {{a large number of}} {{frequent}} alarms (alerts) and consequently becomes desensitized to them. Desensitization can lead to longer response times or to missing important alarms. [...] Alarm fatigue occurs in many industries, including construction and mining (where <b>backup</b> <b>alarms</b> sound so frequently that they often become senseless background noise), healthcare (where electronic monitors tracking clinical information such as vital signs and blood glucose sound alarms so frequently, and often for such minor reasons, that they lose the urgency and attention-grabbing power that they ought to have), and the nuclear power industry. Like crying wolf, such false alarms rob the valid alarms of the value they were intended to add (duly alerting people to danger).|$|R
40|$|The {{size and}} {{complexity}} of modern surface haulage trucks has resulted in an increased reliance upon sensors and electronic-based instrumentation for safe and efficient operation. Design engineers need accurate information about the equipment vibration environment to efficiently and effectively build components for installation on mobile mining equipment capable of withstanding the mine environment. Examples of such components include <b>backup</b> <b>alarms,</b> communication equipment, microprocessor-based controllers, and {{a wide variety of}} sensors. Unfortunately, this information is not available to the majority of both original equipment and aftermarket equipment manufacturers. To address this problem, the U. S. Bureau of Mines performed field vibration measurements on a variety of surface mining haulage trucks. The vibration measurements were then analyzed and test specifications were developed in the form of envelopes. In conjunction with test specifications, recommendations to aid manufacturers in implementing a vibration environment test program have been included with an illustrative example...|$|R
40|$|Current {{innovations}} in Doppler radar technology {{have led to}} suggestions by several institutions and manufacturers that new <b>backup</b> <b>alarm</b> systems are available that can replace or augment warning systems for backing operations on large haulage vehicles. In 1995, Spokane Research Laboratory engineers contacted research institution, equipment manufacturers, and vendors to determine the availability of such systems. Only tow manufacturer-vendors of the radar backup alarms were found. In both cases, the units had not been tested on large, off-road mine haulage trucks. A series of laboratory tests, controlled simulated tests on small vehicles, and full-scale field tests on 240 -ton class, end-dump haulage trucks were conducted to evaluate the existing devices. - NIOSHTIC- 2 NIOSHTIC no. 2000057...|$|E
40|$|International audienceNowadays used {{on most of}} {{construction}} vehicles, tone <b>backup</b> <b>alarm</b> causes a strong discomfort among resident citizens. To solve this problem, "CETIM" (Mechanical Industries Technical Centre) decided to characterize and test another kind of alarm. This one is called "Cri du Lynx" in french (Lynx scream) because of its particular sound looks like a white noise. A previous study showed that the average sound level of the noise-alarm detectability is 67 dB (A) while it is 64 dB (A) for the tone-alarm (in a 80 dB(A) background noise). However, the noise alarm could be used if it is less disturbing than the tone-alarm. The present work aims to compare the discomfort caused by exposure to tone and noise back-up alarms. About 50 people rated 2 times the discomfort caused by 11 sound environments. Each sound environment consisted of a site construction sound environment set at about 65 dB (A) mixed with a sequence of tone or noise alarm set at 56, 59, 62, 65 or 68 dB(A). One of the 11 stimuli had no alarm. Through an ANOVA {{it can be said}} if the kind of alarm and / or the sound level has an influence on the discomfort...|$|E
40|$|Noise {{exposure}} in occupational settings {{has been a}} source of several studies and research, but the phenomenon of noise also occupies some prominence in the concerns of society, since it affects a significant proportion of the population and presents a large diversity in what concerns the sources of emissions. Auditory perception is one of the most important senses, other than vision, used to access the knowledge of space and thus is also useful to recognise the distance from the acoustical stimulus and its spatial location. Noise exposure is not only a cause of hearing loss, but also a source of verbal communication degradation, decreasing the workplace safety and workers’ performance 1. As a consequence of this, the use of hearing protective equipment is increasing. However, the selection process for hearing protection devices (HPDs) is not always done properly. Many workers complain that the use of hearing protective equipment does not allow them to communicate, or to hear and locate important warning sounds at the workplace 2 - 3. It is also agreed that, in addition to the characteristics of attenuation of hearing protection equipment, there are other important factors that may affect the individual ability to perceive auditory signals. These factors include the comfort afforded by the devices, the attention (or lack thereof) of the listener, the characteristics of the warning signals and the users’ hearing loss 4. This work aims to analyse the influence of the use of individual hearing protection in the perception of space localisation and distance identification of a <b>backup</b> <b>alarm</b> signal used in industrial forklift truck...|$|E
40|$|A {{technology}} of <b>backup</b> <b>alarms</b> {{based on the}} use of a broadband signal has recently gained popularity in many countries. In this study, the performance of this broadband technology is compared to that of a conventional tonal alarm and a multi-tone alarm from a worker-safety standpoint. Field measurements of sound pressure level patterns behind heavy vehicles were performed in real work environments and psychoacoustic measurements (sound detection thresholds, equal loudness, perceived urgency and sound localization) were carried out in the laboratory with human subjects. Compared with the conventional tonal alarm, the broadband alarm generates a much more uniform sound field behind vehicles, is easier to localize in space and is judged slighter louder at representative alarm levels. Slight advantages were found with the tonal alarm for sound detection and for perceived urgency at low levels, but these benefits observed in laboratory conditions would not overcome the detrimental effects associated with the large and abrupt variations in sound pressure levels (up to 15 - 20 dB within short distances) observed in the field behind vehicles for this alarm, which are significantly higher than those obtained with the broadband alarm. Performance with the multi-tone alarm generally fell between that of the tonal and broadband alarms on most measures...|$|R
50|$|A back-up beeper {{also known}} as back-up <b>alarm,</b> <b>backup</b> beeper, or vehicle motion alarm, is a device {{originally}} intended to warn passers-by of a vehicle moving in reverse. They typically produce 1000 Hz pure tone beeps at 97-112 decibels, considerably higher than the long-term hearing loss limit of 80 decibels.|$|R
50|$|This {{provision}} {{can be both}} {{a subjective}} immission control and an objective emission control. Normally there are daily curfews and in some case weekend curfews. The subjective aspect is to prevent noise disturbance in the adjacent community. The objective aspect is to control the sound output of specific machines. There are four major sources of site noise: (1) direct sound from continually operating equipment such as air compressors; (2) intermittent sound from equipment such as jack hammers;(3)backup alarms; and (4) hauling equipment such as trucks. Air compressor noise is regulated by CFR 204 and <b>backup</b> <b>alarms</b> are regulated by CFR 1926. Boston, MA(Section 16-26.4) permits construction on weekdays between 7am and 6 pm. Madison, WI (Chapter 24.08) limits sound levels to 88 dB(A) at 50 Feet. Miami, FL (Section 36-6) considers the noise a noise disturbance if it occurs between 6pm and 8am during the week and any time on Sunday. Dallas, TX (Section 30-2 (9)) permits construction in residential zones from 7am to 7pm on weekdays, from 9am to 7pm on Saturdays and Holidays, and prohibits construction on Sundays. Albuquerque,NM (Section 9-9-8) has a more complex control. It prohibits construction and demolition within 500 feet of noise sensitive properties (residences included) if the equipment sound control devices are less effective than the original equipment and if noise mitigation measures are not used when the levels exceed 90 dB (weighting not specified) or more than 80 dB during the day for three days.|$|R
50|$|A safety study {{estimated}} about {{a million}} shortcuts taken per fatal accident. The fatality is {{the peak of the}} accident pyramid. The base of the pyramid is the shortcuts, and in between are escalating levels of near-accidents which could (but too often do not) serve as lessons learned. Blumenberg, 1996Accident investigations typically focus on the end event, and attempt to erect barriers to similar accidents, such as personal protection equipment, <b>backup</b> equipment or <b>alarm</b> systems. These are intended to prevent the recurrence of similar accidents, and are often effective in this limited goal.|$|R
50|$|On September 17, 1991, {{management}} failure, {{power equipment}} failure, and human error combined to completely disable AT&T's {{central office switch}} at 33 Thomas. As a result, over 5 million calls were blocked, and Federal Aviation Administration private lines were also interrupted, disrupting air traffic control to 398 airports serving most of the northeastern United States. Because the building {{was designed to be}} self-sufficient, AT&T had a load shedding agreement with the electric utility, Consolidated Edison, where they would voluntarily switch from utility power to on-site generators on request. This was a routine procedure that had been performed successfully in the past, but on this occasion, it went wrong. After switching power sources, standard procedure was to check all the equipment power supplies, known as DC plants, for problems. But due to scheduled training, the check was not performed, and one plant went on battery <b>backup.</b> The <b>alarms</b> were not detected {{until it was too late}} to maintain uninterrupted power.|$|R
40|$|A {{self-contained}} {{breathing apparatus}} with automatic redundant fluid pressure controls and a facemask mounted low pressure whistle alarm is described. The first stage of the system includes pair of pressure regulators connected in parallel with different outlet pressures, both of which reduce {{the pressure of the}} stored supply gas to pressures compatible with the second stage breathing demand regulator. A primary regulator in the first stage delivers a low output pressure to the demand regulator. In the event of a failure closed condition of the primary regulator an automatic transfer valve switches on the backup regulator. A warning that the supply pressure has been depleted is also provided by a supply pressure actuated transfer valve which transfers the output of the first stage pressure regulators from the primary to the <b>backup</b> regulator. The <b>alarm</b> is activated in either the failure closed condition or if the supply pressure is reduced to a dangerously low level...|$|R
50|$|To {{assist the}} {{operators}} there are computer systems, with <b>backups,</b> which issue <b>alarms</b> {{when there are}} faults in the transmission or generation system. Power flow modeling tools let them analyze {{the current state of}} their network, predict whether any parts of it may be overloaded, and predict the worst possible failure remaining, so that they can change the distribution of generation or reconfigure the transmission system to prevent a failure should this situation occur. If the computer systems and their backups fail, the operators are required to monitor the grid manually, instead of relying on computer alerts. If they cannot interpret {{the current state of the}} power grid in such an event, they follow a contingency plan, contacting other plant and grid operators by telephone if necessary. If there is a failure, they are also required to notify adjacent areas which may be affected, so those can predict the possible effects on their own systems.|$|R
40|$|This master thesis {{has been}} written in {{connection}} with the ongoing Sea Cage Gateway (SCG) project, a project investigating the possibility of remotely administering fish farming facilities. These facilities consist of sea cages placed offshore and connected to the mainland through wireless communication technologies. The sea cages all contain a number of sensors optimizing production and increasing safety. Not only must this sensor data be read, it must also be transported, collected, interpreted, handled, saved and retrieved. In addition, it is necessary to provide backup communication links in case of failures in the main communication systems. The system should be as autonomous as possible, allowing it to be unmanned for longer periods of time. This thesis has further investigated the possibility of remotely controlling and administering a fish farm through distributed nodes over wireless communication links. As a basis for this thesis domain descriptions from previous master theses written {{in connection with the}} SCG-project have been used. This thesis has also aimed to collect inspiration from other domains and concepts which have similarities with the SCG-project. With the increasing numbers of nodes and communication links present at the fish farm installations, areas such as grid computing and sensor networks have many applicable principles for the SCG-system. These principles have been integrated into the system design to give the basis for further such functionality in the SCG-domain. In addition to the areas of grid computing and sensor networks, the current and latest wireless communication technologies available for providing the services required by the SCG-system have been presented. The communication links also influence the system design since their connection types must be handled by the SCG-system elements. The SCG-system proposed has been designed and implemented with ActorFrame. The implemented system has functioned as a demonstrator for the main principles presented in the design. It has incorporated a GPS-receiver and a GPRS-modem to represent a sensor on a sea cage and a redundant communication link. The system implemented reports GPS-data to a central unit and issues alerts upon sensor data deviations (sea cage out of position). Furthermore, the demonstrator can detect a failed communication link and switch to the <b>backup</b> GPRS-modem, generate <b>alarms,</b> and continue to provide basic services. All elements and their status are reported and registered in a database and are presented through a dynamic web interface. The demonstrator has shown that ActorFrame can be utilized to provide the necessary functionality the SCG-domain requires. A few improvements are proposed for the framework to increase the flexibility and performance of the system, especially in the area of handling the distribution of actors on independent nodes and how the heterogeneous network technologies present in SCG-system require a higher-level of network-awareness on behalf of the application. This thesis has also suggested several possible extensions and future areas of work. </p...|$|R
