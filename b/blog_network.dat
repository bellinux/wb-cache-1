40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the {{information}} propagation in an empirical <b>blogging</b> <b>network</b> by game-theoretical approach. The <b>blogging</b> <b>network</b> has small-world property and is scale-free. Individuals in the blogosphere coordinate their decisions {{according to their}} idiosyncratic preferences and the choices of their neighbors. We find that corresponding to different initial conditions and weights, the equilibrium frequency of discussions has a transition from high to low {{as a result of}} the common interest in the topics specified by payoff matrices. Furthermore, under recommendation, namely, individuals in <b>blogging</b> <b>networks</b> refer to additional bloggers' resources besides their nearest neighbors preferentially according to the popularity of the blogs, the whole <b>blogging</b> <b>network</b> ultrafastly evolves into consensus state (absorbing state). Our results reflect the dynamic pattern of information propagation in <b>blogging</b> <b>networks.</b> Comment: 6 pages, 8 figures. Submitted to EP...|$|R

The quantities such as degree distribution, clustering coefficient, average shortest path length are calculated to capture the features of the <b>blogging</b> <b>network.</b> We demonstrate that the <b>blogging</b> <b>network</b> has small-world property and the in and out degree distributions have power-law forms. The analysis also confirms that <b>blogging</b> <b>networks</b> show in general disassortative mixing pattern.

500|$|The gaming blog Polygon was {{launched}} on October 24, 2012, as Vox Media's third property. The site grew from technology blog The Verge, which {{was launched}} {{a year earlier}} as an outgrowth of sports <b>blog</b> <b>network</b> SB Nation before Vox Media was formed. Vox Media CEO Jim Bankoff approached Joystiq editor-in-chief Christopher Grant in early 2011 about starting a video game website. Bankoff considered video games to be a logical vertical market for Vox, whose sites attracted an 18- to 49-year-old demographic. He also saw games to be an expanding market in consideration of mobile and social network game categories. Forbes described Bankoff's offer as a [...] "serious commitment to online journalism" [...] {{in an age of}} content farms and disappearing print publications, but Grant did not trust the offer and declined. Upon seeing the effort that Vox put into The Verge, their Chorus content management system, and the quality of their content and sponsorships, Grant changed his mind and returned to pitch Bankoff. Grant wanted the new site to compete with top gaming websites GameSpot and IGN, but still be able to run longform [...] "magazine-style journalism" [...] that could be of historic interest. As part of the site's attempt to [...] "redefine games journalism", Vox made a 13-part documentary series of the site's creation ("Press Reset") that tracked the site's creation from start to launch.|$|E
