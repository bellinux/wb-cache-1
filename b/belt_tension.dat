50|$|Power {{transmission}} {{is a function}} of <b>belt</b> <b>tension.</b> However, also increasing with tension is stress (load) on the belt and bearings. The ideal belt is that of the lowest tension that does not slip in high loads. Belt tensions should also be adjusted to belt type, size, speed, and pulley diameters. <b>Belt</b> <b>tension</b> is determined by measuring the force to deflect the belt a given distance per inch of pulley. Timing belts need only adequate tension to keep the belt in contact with the pulley.|$|E

5000|$|Active {{seat-belt}} buckle with Pre-Safe {{function for}} rear occupants: the active seat-belt buckle is fully integrated in the vehicle's PRE-SAFE® system. Whenever PRE-SAFE® becomes active in critical driving situations {{or when the}} system detects the vehicle approaching other objects at a critical speed, reversible <b>belt</b> <b>tensioning</b> is also performed in the rear via the active seat-belt buckle function. The restraint system and the passengers are thus better prepared for a possible accident system. In contrast to its extended position to facilitate fastening of the seat belt, the belt buckle is retracted by approx. 40 millimetres instead. This reversible function increases the <b>belt</b> <b>tensioning</b> on the occupant by up to 80 millimetres. In addition, the belt buckle branches off at a lower point at the occupant's hip. This {{reduces the risk of}} the pelvis submarining under the belt. Securing the occupants more effectively in this way can reduce the strain to which they are exposed {{in the event of an}} accident. The active seat-belt buckle complements the pyrotechnic <b>belt</b> <b>tensioning</b> which has featured as standard in Mercedes-Benz vehicles for many years now, and is triggered in the event of an actual impact.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Automated Mechanical Transmission (AMT) {{is applied}} {{as a new}} {{starting}} device for belt conveyor in the paper. Simulation model of AMT driving belt conveyor is established in AMESim. Simulations of start-up process at first gear condition and shifting process from first to eighth gear are discussed. Belt velocity is accepted as the law of gearshifts to judge the moment of shifting. Simulation results show that AMT could achieve the purpose of belt conveyor’s soft-starting gradually. The belt appears short-time acceleration mutations during shifting process which results in the <b>belt</b> maximum <b>tension,</b> the driving pulley torque, and other parameters changing within their allowable limits. The <b>belt</b> maximum <b>tension</b> appears short-time mutations when the clutch is just engaged, {{in which case the}} peak value of <b>belt</b> maximum <b>tension</b> can achieve 110 KN approximately, and is less than its allowable limit. After shift actions, the <b>belt</b> maximum <b>tension</b> and other parameters curves tend to be stable...|$|R
50|$|A {{belt drive}} for a bicycle was {{patented}} in the United States on April 8, 1890 by Charles D. Rice, Patent # 425,390. No {{evidence has been}} found that it was ever used, but some motorcycles used leather belts in the early 1900s. The Bridgestone Picnica belt-drive bicycle was introduced in the early 1980s. It used a tooth-belt drive like auto timing belts and Harley-Davidson drive belts, along with a novel two-part chainring that increased <b>belt</b> <b>tension</b> with increasing load. The Picnica was a folding bicycle, and part of the appeal of the belt drive was cleanliness. The Picnica was a small-wheel bicycle, so <b>belt</b> <b>tension</b> may have been less than on a bicycle with standard-size wheels. It was apparently successful, but was offered mainly in Japan.|$|E

5000|$|The Bridgestone Picnica (Japanese: Burijisuton Pikunika: ブリヂストン 「ピクニカ」) line of {{collapsible}} bikes, {{some models}} featuring belt-drives, {{were introduced in}} the early 1980s and carried in the Bridgestone Cycle USA catalogs from 1985 through 1990. It weighs 29 pounds, and belt-drive models use a tooth-belt drive like auto timing belts and Harley-Davidson drive belts, along with a novel two-part chainring that increases <b>belt</b> <b>tension</b> with increasing load. In April 1987, Popular Mechanics described Bridgestone's Beltrex system as follows: [...] "Unlike the belt-drive motorcycles, which can slide the rear wheel back to keep the belt taut, the Beltrex uses a floating pulley that's cogged to the drive gear. Tension on the pedal cranks drives the floating pulley forward, taking up belt slack and preventing tooth slippage."The Picnica is a folding bicycle, {{and part of the}} appeal of the belt drive is cleanliness. It is a small wheel bicycle, so <b>belt</b> <b>tension</b> may be less than on a bicycle with standard-size wheels.|$|E
50|$|Power is {{transmitted}} from the engine to the drive system through drive belts. Originally, the R22 used four separate v-belts running on multi-groove sheaves. This system proved problematic, as individual belts would sometimes roll over in their groove and fail. As a temporary measure, in 1982, R22 operators received a kit from Robinson that was installed in the cockpit and on the <b>belt</b> <b>tension</b> actuator, isolating the tensioning circuits and locking the clutch/drive system at take-off tension. The problem was ultimately solved by replacing the four individual v-belts with two dual v-belts. The upper, driven sheave is mounted on the main/tail rotor drive shaft incorporating flexible couplings, and is raised and lowered relative to the engine-mounted, driving sheave {{by means of a}} <b>belt</b> <b>tension</b> actuator. During shutdown, the actuator is used to lower the upper sheave to loosen the drive belts. For startup, the engine is started with the belts loose, allowing the engine to run without spinning the rotor system. Immediately after engine start, the clutch switch located in the cockpit is closed by the pilot, powering the actuator to slowly raise the upper sheave to flight position, which tightens the belts. The actuator is thereafter controlled by pressure-sensing column springs, automatically maintaining proper <b>belt</b> <b>tension</b> during flight as the belts wear and stretch. The shaft on which the upper sheave is mounted drives both the main and tail rotors; the main gear box delivers power to the main rotor shaft through a set of splash-lubricated spiral bevel gears.|$|E

50|$|The exposed drum shafts {{are used}} to install and fix the drum motor into the {{conveyor}} frame and do not rotate. The shaft can be a single “through” shaft where the motor and gearbox are assembled on, and fixed to, the shaft with keys or pins. However, this type of drum motor design has a limited maximum radial load due to the bending stresses caused by the normal <b>belt</b> <b>tension</b> of a conveyor and is therefore used mainly for small light duty conveyors and loads. For heavier loads the most common design is to use two separate shafts, one fixed to the motor housing and one fixed to the gearbox housing where the mass of metal from the motor and gearbox significantly increases {{the strength of the}} drum motor allowing much higher payloads and longer conveyor applications. Typically one shaft is short (stub shaft) with a consistent length and the other increases in length according to the drum shell or belt width. Over certain widths, the shaft can be further reinforced to prevent bending under high <b>belt</b> <b>tension.</b>|$|E
50|$|Belt drives are simple, inexpensive, and do {{not require}} axially aligned shafts. They help protect {{machinery}} from overload and jam, and damp and isolate noise and vibration. Load fluctuations are shock-absorbed (cushioned). They need no lubrication and minimal maintenance. They have high efficiency (90-98%, usually 95%), high tolerance for misalignment, and are of relatively low cost if the shafts are far apart. Clutch action is activated by releasing <b>belt</b> <b>tension.</b> Different speeds {{can be obtained by}} stepped or tapered pulleys.|$|E

40|$|A {{very common}} {{configuration}} of motorcycle V-belt variators {{allows for the}} correction of the <b>belt</b> <b>tensioning</b> in dependence on the resistant torque by a suitable helical shape of the tracks that enable the closure/opening of the driven half-pulleys. The theoretical model for the belt-pulley coupling is just complex for this arrangement, where one half-pulley may run in advance {{and the other is}} slower than the belt, and requires the repeated numerical solution of a strongly non-linear differential system by a sort of shooting technique, until all boundary conditions are fulfilled (angular contact extent, torque, axial force). After solving the full equations, the present study develops closed-form approximations characterized by an excellent fit with the numerical plots and proposes a simple and practical formulary for the axial thrust in dependence on the torque and the tension level. Then, results of a theoretical-experimental comparison are also reported, revealing a very good agreement of the model with the real operation...|$|R
50|$|Internal {{combustion}} engines {{can benefit from}} mounting in the fuselage, {{rather than on the}} propeller mast. This allows them to be connected to a larger muffler for reduced noise when operating, something which is mostly relevant to European operation. It also allows the <b>belt</b> <b>tension</b> to be relieved when the engine is retracted to extend the life of the belt and bearings. The drawback of this arrangement is that engines fixed low in fuselages are more difficult to pre-flight and service, and highly stressed power transmission belts should not be bent or twisted.|$|E

The system was a joint development between Dayco (belt supplier) and Rover.The rear link belts do not incorporate any tensioning device. <b>Belt</b> <b>tension</b> is maintained by very careful control of belt length and the pulley pair is pre-tensioned during fitting.

50|$|Vibration {{signatures}} {{are widely}} used for studying belt drive malfunctions. Some of the common malfunctions or faults include the effects of <b>belt</b> <b>tension,</b> speed, sheave eccentricity and misalignment conditions.The effect of sheave Eccentricity on vibration signatures of the belt drive is quite significant. Although, vibration magnitude is not necessarily increased by this it will create strong amplitude modulation. When the top section of a belt is in resonance, the vibrations of the machine is increased. However, {{an increase in the}} machine vibration is not significant when only the bottom section of the belt is in resonance. The vibration spectrum has the tendency to move to higher frequencies as the tension force of the belt is increased.|$|E
