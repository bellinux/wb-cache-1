40|$|Production {{of plastic}} {{in the world}} is about 225 million tons/year and is growing at about 5 - 7 % annually, {{especially}} in the developing countries. Europe has the longest experience with plastic waste recycling policies. Nevertheless, the recycling rates remain low though are increasing. Recycling of plastic materials is an important topic, driven by commercial and environmental influences. Separation and cleaning techniques have been developed along with the means of reusing recycled material. There existing different technologies for recycling pure HDPE (high density polyethylene) and LPDE (low density polyethylene) polymer wastes. They are fully recyclable. In the case of impossibility to separate the HDPE from LPDE new method for recycling such kind of waste should be found. It is necessary taking in care the conditions of the recycling process that can have significant impact on the properties of the recycled polymer. There are different filed for applying recycled polymer waste, such as containers, <b>bottles,</b> <b>packages,</b> transport engineering, civil engineering etc. Increasing traffic volumes, vehicle loads and tyre pressures are causing accelerated degradation of our road pavements. Improved materials, such as polymer modified binders (PMBs), are being used as a means of better combating these effects. Asphalt binders are most commonly characterized by their physical properties. An asphalt binder’s physical properties directly describe how it will perform as a constituent in pavement. The challenge in physical property characterization is to develop physical tests that can satisfactorily characterize key asphalt binder parameters and how these parameters change throughout the life of a pavement. The polymer additives do not chemically combine or change the chemical nature of the bitumen being modified, apart from being present in and throughout the bitumen. Polymers change the physical nature of bitumen, and they are able to modify such physical properties as the softening point and the brittleness of the bitumen. This research was conducted to development of modified polymer asphalt applying the waste from mixed LPDE and HDPE to extend the service life of a pavement binder and thus for determining a polymer’s cost effectiveness. In the framework of investigation the polymer modified bitumen has been developed and exploitation properties of this one have been evaluated. Three kind of tests have been performed for asphalt mix: wheel tracking test, stiffness, resistance to fatigue. Obtained results show improving mechanical and physical properties of asphalt mix, their durability. Elastic recovery/ductility can also be improved...|$|E

The experiment shows that the <b>bottle</b> <b>packaged</b> wine product labeled by the tag can be detected at about 1. 5 m distance, which is much longer than previously reported on wine product detection.
