[...] "I looked over there {{before you came}} up and could not make it out, but the sky has brightened {{a lot in the}} last ten minutes. I should say that it is about five-and-twenty miles away. It is a very <b>bold</b> <b>coast,</b> sir.|$|E
6000|$|... "Umph!" [...] ejaculated Ted, as they {{descended to}} the <b>bold</b> rocky <b>coast,</b> where the celebrated pirate of old was wont to mount guard over the Mediterranean.|$|R
60|$|At {{last the}} Irish lights were sighted and passed, Land's End lay like a blue fog upon the water, {{and the great}} steamer {{ploughed}} its way along the <b>bold</b> Cornish <b>coast</b> until it dropped its anchor in Plymouth Bay. John hurried to the railway station, {{and within a few}} hours he found himself back once more in his native town, which he had quitted a poor corkcutter, half a century before.|$|R
6000|$|I have now, dear L., quitted the {{maritime}} plain or first zone, {{to enter the}} Ghauts, that threshold of the Ethiopian highlands which, beginning at Tajurrah, sweeps in semicircle round the bay of Zayla, and falls about Berberah into the range of mountains which fringes the <b>bold</b> Somali <b>coast.</b> This chain has been inhabited, within History's memory, by three distinct races,--the Gallas, the ancient Moslems of Adel, and by the modern Somal. As usual, however, in the East, it has no general vernacular name. [1] ...|$|R
60|$|The sun shone, {{the water}} danced and sparkled, and {{presently}} we raised our sail, {{and took the}} gale that blew for Capri--an oblong height rising ten miles beyond out of {{the heart of the}} azure gulf. On the way thither there was little interest but that of natural beauty in the <b>bold,</b> picturesque <b>coast</b> we skirted for some distance; though on one mighty rock there were the ruins of a seaward-looking Temple of Hercules, with arches of the unmistakable Roman masonry, below which the receding waves rushed and poured over a jetting ledge in a thunderous cataract.|$|R
40|$|Oceanic {{plates are}} geologically young, forming at mid-ocean ridges and {{becoming}} deeper and older with distance {{away from these}} spreading centres, to be subducted into ocean trenches. Most of the islands that occur on these oceanic plates are basaltic, formed at hot spots, and carried into deeper water as the plate migrates. In tropical reef-forming seas, volcanic islands are usually protected by coral reefs, and undergo transition from fringing reefs, to barrier reefs, to atolls, as envisaged by Darwin. Linear island chains comprise volcanic islands at successive stages in the progression from volcano through coral reefs to seamounts and guyots. Erosion occurs rapidly {{in the early stages}} once eruption has ceased, and older islands are conspicuously dissected by fluvial action, as observed by Dana. Many are subject to submarine slumping. In the absence of coral reefs, marine abrasion truncates islands, producing near-vertical cliffs, and islands may be entirely bevelled; Balls Pyramid in the southern Pacific appears to be at the penultimate stage of this planation with a broad shelf around it. Coral reefs protect the shoreline, which is usually deeply embayed, with progressive subsidence until volcanic residuals are all that remain on 2 ̆ 7 almost-atolls 2 ̆ 7. Reef limestones indicate earlier phases of reef formation, and there are limestone cliffs around many tropical islands composed of Last Interglacial limestone often veneering older reef terraces. In some cases, the morphology of these limestone coasts contains prominent notches or surf benches reflecting different degrees of exposure to wave energy, or subtle flexure and vertical displacement. Islands provide discrete examples of rocky coasts, with contrasts between adjacent islands, or islands of different ages, providing many insights into the evolutionary stages and the morphodynamics of <b>bold</b> <b>coasts...</b>|$|R
60|$|Those who for {{the first}} time visit the South Seas, {{generally}} are surprised at the appearance of the islands when beheld from the sea. From the vague accounts we sometimes have of their beauty, many people are apt to picture to themselves enamelled and softly swelling plains, shaded over with delicious groves, and watered by purling brooks, and the entire country but little elevated above the surrounding ocean. The reality is very different; <b>bold</b> rock-bound <b>coasts,</b> with the surf beating high against the lofty cliffs, and broken here and there into deep inlets, which open to the view thickly-wooded valleys, separated by the spurs of mountains clothed with tufted grass, and sweeping down towards the sea from an elevated and furrowed interior, form the principal features of these islands.|$|R
6000|$|The large desk (to resume {{our survey}} of the office) stood about the middle, knee-deep in stacks of handbills and posters of [...] "Why Drink French Brandy?" [...] and [...] "The Advertiser's Vade-Mecum." [...] It was flanked upon the one hand by two female type-writers, who rested not between the hours of nine and four, and upon the other by {{a model of the}} {{agricultural}} machine. The walls, where they were not broken by telephone-boxes and a couple of photographs--one representing the wreck of the James L. Moody on a <b>bold</b> and broken <b>coast,</b> the other the Saturday tug alive with amateur fishers--almost disappeared under oil-paintings gaudily framed. Many of these were relics of the Latin Quarter, and I must do Pinkerton the justice to say that none of them were bad, and some had remarkable merit. They went off slowly, but for handsome figures; and their places were progressively supplied with the work of local artists. These last it was one of my first duties to review and criticise. Some of them were villainous, yet all were saleable. I said so; and the next moment saw myself, the figure of a miserable renegade, bearing arms in the wrong camp. I was to look at pictures thenceforward, not with the eye of the artist, but the dealer; and I saw the stream widen that divided me from all I loved.|$|R
