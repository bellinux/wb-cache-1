2500|$|Kennedy first {{obtained}} {{his private}} pilot license in 1998, and received [...] "high performance airplane" [...] and [...] "complex airplane" [...] endorsements {{two months before the}} crash. His estimated total flight experience before the crash was about 310 hours, of which 55 hours were at night. His estimated flight time in the accident airplane was about 36 hours, of which about 9.4 hours were at night. Approximately 3 hours of that flight time were without a Certified Flight Instructor (CFI) on board, and only 48 minutes of that time was flown at night, which included a night landing. It is not clear how much of his total flight experience was in the plane type that crashed or Kennedy's other, more <b>basic</b> <b>plane</b> the Cessna Skylane 182. Fifteen months before the crash, Kennedy had flown about 35 flights either to or from northern New Jersey and the Martha's Vineyard area. Kennedy flew more than 17 of these legs without a CFI on board, including at least five at night. His last known flight in his airplane without a CFI on board happened two months before the crash.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>basic</b> <b>plane</b> is, in general, {{rectangular}} or square. therefore, it {{is composed}} of horizontal and vertical lines which delimit it and define it as an autonomous entity which supports the painting, communicating its affective tonality. This tonality {{is determined by the}} relative importance of horizontal and vertical lines: the horizontals giving a calm, cold tonality to the <b>basic</b> <b>plane</b> while the verticals impart a calm, warm tonality. The artist intuits the inner effect of the canvas format and dimensions, which he chooses according to the tonality he wants to give to his work. Kandinsky considered the <b>basic</b> <b>plane</b> a living being, which the artist [...] "fertilizes" [...] and feels [...] "breathing".|$|E
50|$|Each {{part of the}} <b>basic</b> <b>plane</b> {{possesses}} an affective colouration; this {{influences the}} tonality of the pictorial elements which will be drawn on it, and contributes to {{the richness of the}} composition resulting from their juxtaposition on the canvas. The above of the <b>basic</b> <b>plane</b> corresponds with looseness and to lightness, while the below evokes condensation and heaviness. The painter's job is to listen and know these effects to produce paintings which are not just the effect of a random process, but the fruit of authentic work and the result of an effort towards inner beauty.|$|E

50|$|In his writings, Kandinsky {{analyzed}} the geometrical elements {{which make up}} every painting—the point and the line.

He did not analyze them objectively, but {{from the point of}} view of their inner effect on the observer.|$|E

50|$|A {{point is}} a small bit of colour put by the artist on the canvas. It is neither a {{geometric}} point nor a mathematical abstraction; it is extension, form and colour.

50|$|Clarence Prevost, {{the flight}} {{instructor}} assigned to Moussaoui, {{began to have}} suspicions about his student. His behavior largely resembled that of other seemingly wealthy men {{who had come to}} the center in the past to receive jumbo jet training despite the fact that they'd probably never use it, but some characteristics were unusual. Prevost said later that in pre-simulator instruction, Moussaoui would ask questions that had the right jargon but were otherwise nonsensical. Moussaoui read through the 747 training manuals, but had a lack of understanding of the plane's systems. Prevost was confused as to why Moussaoui would seek simulator time if he lacked <b>basic</b> <b>plane</b> knowledge. After some convincing, his supervisors contacted the FBI, who came to meet with him. (Despite later reports, Moussaoui did not skip the training for takeoff and landing).|$|E

50|$|A U.S. Air Force {{variant of}} the plane for {{surveillance}} roles primarily over Afghanistan and Iraq was the MC-12W Liberty. For that variant, Beechcraft built the <b>basic</b> <b>plane</b> and then sent it to Greenville, Texas where sophisticated intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) equipment was installed by L-3 Communications Missions Integration. As of 2013 the Liberty program had exceeded 300,000 combat flying hours. The MC-12W was rushed into combat as a supplemental surveillance and signals intelligence asset; since its first combat mission on 10 June 2009, the aircraft flew 400,000 combat hours in 79,000 combat sorties, aiding in the kill or capture of “more than 8,000 terrorists” and uncovering 650 weapons caches. With its roles {{taken over by the}} growing MQ-9 Reaper fleet, the Air Force decided to divest itself of the 41 Liberty aircraft and turn them over to the U.S. Army and U.S. Special Operations Command, which was completed by October 2015.
