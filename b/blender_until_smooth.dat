40|$|Abstract: The prime {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to develop a preservation method for garlic paste that could prevent adverse quality changes and render the paste more shelf stable. Three separate batches of fresh garlic bulbs of two Sudanese varieties (Dongla and Berber) harvested in December 2011 were collected, peeled manually, separated into individual sound cloves, divided into 5 equal portions and crushed in a <b>blender</b> <b>until</b> a <b>smooth</b> puree was obtained. Before crushing, portions were assigned randomly to chemical treatments (T 0 - T 4). Each garlic treated portion was subdivided into 2 equal portions, packed in glass containers,, stored at 25 C or 40 C for 6 months and analyzed at an interval of 2 months. Parameters measured were, proximate composition, pH, viscosity, sugars, total soluble solids (TSS), tannic acid and carbohydrates (CHO). Berber var. had high (p 0. 05) tannins but numerically low pH than Dongola var. These two components could render Berber var. less vulnerable to spoilage than Dongola. Irrespective of storage period, Dongola var. had higher (p 0. 05) reducing and total sugars while Berber had higher (p 0. 05) non reducing sugar. Also Irrespective of the chemical treatments (T 0 - T 4) moisture, fat, ash and crude fiber contents increased (p 0. 05) while TSS, CHO and protein contents decreased (p 0. 05) with the increase of the storage period. Treatments T 0 - T 4 caused variable effects increasing (TSS and crude fiber) or decreasing (moisture) some of the parameters measured...|$|R

However, Ibarra is used primarily to make hot cocoa in traditional Mexican form.

Heat the milk until it is near boiling, then blend the milk and chocolate in a <b>blender</b> <b>until</b> the chocolate is completely dissolved, and serve hot. Ibarra can also be prepared on the stove by dissolving the wedges in hot milk, then whisking the cocoa with a molinillo or wire whisk.

50|$|In most light {{aircraft}}, as {{the stall}} is reached, the aircraft {{will start to}} descend (because the wing is no longer producing enough lift to support the aircraft's weight) and the nose will pitch down. Recovery from the stall involves lowering the aircraft nose, to decrease the angle of attack and increase the air speed, <b>until</b> <b>smooth</b> air-flow over the wing is restored. Normal flight can be resumed once recovery is complete. The maneuver is normally quite safe and if correctly handled leads to only a small loss in altitude (20-30 m/50'-100'). It is taught and practised in order for pilots to recognize, avoid, and recover from stalling the aircraft. A pilot is required to demonstrate competency in controlling an aircraft during and after a stall for certification, {{and it is a}} routine maneuver for pilots when getting to know the handling of a new aircraft type.
