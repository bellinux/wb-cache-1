But he is aware that I {{have been looking for}} a right-back and I will continue looking for one. That doesn't mean I don't appreciate what Jerry has done for me since I signed him three-and-a-half years ago. There isn't a more reliable player at the club than Jerry Gill. He captains my reserve team, his fitness is of a very high standard and he has endless enthusiasm. When I put him in the first team, he never lets me down. I value Jerry's professionalism and for as long as I remain manager of Birmingham, there will always <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> him here.|$|E
25|$|As {{the number}} of {{settlers}} in the area grew, so did demand for a local bench of magistrates as the nearest ones were 100–200 miles away in Tumut and Binalong. In April 1847 {{it was announced that}} Wagga Wagga was to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> holding petty sessions, dispensing justice and maintaining law and order over an area up to 100 miles away. The courthouse was located with the beginnings of a village formed near the ford used by most traffic passing through the area. The village included a crude blacksmith's shop and hotel. A post office was established in January 1849 and later that year the town was marked out by surveyor Thomas Townshend and formally gazetted as a village on 23 November 1849.|$|E
500|$|Burnside {{offered to}} resign his {{commission}} altogether but Lincoln declined, stating {{that there could}} still <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> him in the army. Thus, he was placed back {{at the head of}} the IX Corps and sent to command the Department of the Ohio, encompassing the states of Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, and Illinois. This was a quiet area with little activity, and the President reasoned that Burnside could not get himself into too much trouble there. However, antiwar sentiment was riding high in the Western states as they had traditionally carried on a great deal of commerce with the South, and there was little in the way of abolitionist sentiment there or a desire to fight for the purpose of ending slavery. Burnside was thoroughly disturbed by this trend and issued a series of orders forbidding [...] "the expression of public sentiments against the war or the Administration" [...] in his department; this finally climaxed with General Order No. 38, which declared that [...] "any person found guilty of treason will be tried by a military tribunal and either imprisoned or banished to enemy lines".|$|E

Souleymane Cissé, Malian director {{and president of the}} UCECAO declared that [...] "these meetings must <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> exchanging and sharing experiences on the problems of African cinema, and an occasion for the actors to think about an economically viable West African cinema". This edition was placed under a sign of solidarity with the war victim children of Darfour.|$|E
2500|$|Basic {{quilting}} {{instructions were}} difficult {{to find in the}} early 1970s as quiltmaking had fallen out of vogue after World War II, and there were few people who practiced the craft. [...] James turned to two early quilt books for information and inspiration: The Standard Book of Quilt Making and Collecting by Marguerite Ickis, published in 1949 and Jean Ray Laury’s book, Quilts and Coverlets: A Contemporary Approach, published in 1970. [...] In his keynote address to the American Quilt Study Group in 2000, James credits Laury’s book as his “first introduction to the notion that quilts didn’t have to conform to some historical prescription” and with his “first awareness that there might <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> experimentation and individual expression.” [...] Before exploring the expressive potential of quiltmaking, however, he became proficient in the technical aspects by creating numerous copies of traditional block patterns.|$|E

2500|$|Alice {{was not a}} {{champion}} for Greek Life, which had become popular {{at the time she}} came to her position at the University. She believed school had become a place where social life mattered more than the academics. The experience outside of the classroom had become {{just as important as the}} academics. Despite her attitude that school should <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> learning, away from social distractions, Lloyd still maintained an idealistic view on the world and education. In a speech given to the National Association of Deans of Women from January, 1944 she stated, [...] "Education must be inspired by courageous and spiritual leadership and must touch the hearts of people as well as train their minds." [...] Additionally, in a speech given at the American Legion Auxiliary Services on August 16, 1945, she said, [...] "It is through generosity and compassion and honesty and love that we will build a new world." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the United States the use or {{denial of}} use of current {{military}} aircraft in films {{is determined by the}} U.S. military itself. The armed services review all requests for the use of aircraft, by examining the scripts to ensure that aircraft will only be used in films that show the U.S. military in a positive light. Because alternatives to using real military aircraft can be expensive, films that do not get U.S. military approval often do not get financed or made. Sean McElwee, writing for Salon.com concluded of this problem, [...] "This is a prima facie case for de facto censorship...If the government wants to allow its equipment to be used by studios, it needs to grant access to anyone who wants to use it – that is the meaning of pluralism. The Pentagon fears that some of the movies may hurt the military's reputation and recruiting efforts. These concerns are legitimate, but it's more important that we allow John Stuart Mill's [...] "market place of ideas" [...] to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> free trade, rather than favoring some over others." ...|$|E
2500|$|Oasis' {{third album}} Be Here Now (1997) was highly anticipated. Despite {{initially}} attracting positive reviews and selling strongly, the record was soon subjected to strong criticism from music critics, record-buyers and even Noel Gallagher himself for its overproduced and bloated sound. Music critic Jon Savage pinpointed Be Here Now as the moment where Britpop ended; Savage {{said that while}} the album [...] "isn't the great disaster that everybody says," [...] he noted that [...] "t {{was supposed to be the}} big, big triumphal record" [...] of the period. At the same time, Damon Albarn sought to distance Blur from Britpop with the band's self-titled fifth album, Blur (1997). On guitarist Graham Coxon's suggestion, Blur moved away from their Parklife-era sound, and their music began to assimilate American lo-fi influences, particularly that of Pavement. Albarn explained to the NME in January 1997 that [...] "We created a movement: as far as the lineage of British bands goes, there'll always <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> us", but added, [...] "We genuinely started to see that world in a slightly different way." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Waterfront is {{an ambitious}} ongoing £200 million Dockland {{regeneration}} project, {{which began in}} 2007. The project includes a new 'Barrow Marina Village' which will incorporate an £8 million 400-berth marina, 650 homes, restaurants, shops, hotels and a new {{state of the art}} bridge across Cavendish Dock. A large watersports centre is also proposed, with the possibility of a cruise ship terminal. Some cruise ships are already scheduled to dock in Barrow, mainly for tourists to visit the Lake District, although there is no official cruise ship terminal yet. Developments have stalled since 2010 when the Northwest Regional Development Agency [...] was disbanded and essential government funding was lost. Despite this Barrow Borough Council has since purchased land needed to make the development a reality and currently controls 95% of the site. The executive director of the council has stated construction of the Waterfront could resume by 2017 as economic prospects improve and has pledged funds to conduct a market testing exercise. The allocation of Growth Deal investment (2014 - 2021) will make improvements to the Barrow Waterfront Enterprise Zone far more secure [...] In 2014 a £300 million investment into the shipyard was announced by BAE Systems, in anticipation of the new generation of UK nuclear submarines. Construction will take up to eight years and create thousands of new jobs at the shipyard thereafter. Amongst proposals are an extension to the DDH complex and new buildings in the central yard area off Bridge Road on Barrow Island (a site formerly mooted for a huge construction hall for the construction of Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carrier sections which the yard failed to win contracts for), these will house pressure hull units ready for shot blasting and painting, and <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> joining submarine equipment modules. Redevelopment of the 5.8 hectare central yard area commenced in 2016. It is to be dominated by the Central Yard Complex Facility which upon completion will measure [...] long, [...] wide and [...] tall, only 10% smaller than the volume of the pre-expansion Devonshire Dock Hall.|$|E
