This thesis examines the use of distributed discrete-event simulation techniques {{as part of an}} aid to the design of highly automated <b>batch</b> <b>manufacturing</b> systems. The methodology and objectives of the design of highly automated <b>batch</b> <b>manufacturing</b> systems are described and an assessment is made of the use of modelling and simulation as part of the method. Criteria are developed for a simulator used during the. detail design stage. The different approaches taken by existing simulation systems to building and configuring simulation models and their use of particular simulation techniques are described. Limitations on simulation models due to the sequential processing of event-lists and activity scans are identified in a review of the problems of simulation that current existing distributed simulators have been designed to answer. The advantages of concurrent and distributed computing and in particular, a tightly-coupled multi-microprocessor computing engine for executing the normally batch-processed computing tasks of simulation are identified. A novel approach to the distr bution of the computational tasks in a distributed simulation system is described and the operation of a simulator built using this approach to simulate the operation of highly automated <b>batch</b> <b>manufacturing</b> systems is also described. The question of whether such a distributed simulator of highly automated <b>batch</b> <b>manufacturing</b> systems satisfies the criteria is examined on the basis of an analysis of the operation of the simulator. It is shown that a number of advantages in the areas of level of detail, configuration, parallel processing and speed of execution can be achieved through the use of distributed computing and multi-processing techniques for simulation during the detail design stage of highly automated <b>batch</b> <b>manufacturing</b> systems...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{development}} of a real-time control network as an integrated part of a shop floor control system for small <b>batch</b> part <b>manufacturing.</b> The shop floor control system is called the production control system (PCS). The PCS aims at an improved control of small <b>batch</b> part <b>manufacturing</b> systems, enabling both a more flexible use of resources and a decrease in the economical batch size. For this, the PCS integrates various control functions such as scheduling, dispatching, workstation control and monitoring, whilst being connected on-line to the production equipment on the shop floor. The PCS can be applied irrespective of the level of automation on the shop floor. The control network {{is an essential part of}} the PCS, as it provides a real-time connection between the different modules (computers) of the PCS, which are geographically distributed over the shop floor. An overview of the requirements of such a control network is given. The description of the design includes the services developed, the protocols used and the physical layout of the network. A prototype of the PCS, including the control network, has been installed and tested in a pilot plant. The control network has proven that it can supply a manufacturing environment, consisting of equipment from different vendors with different levels of automation, with a reliable, low cost, real-time communication facility...|$|R

In this way, an excellent due date performance can be achieved, {{with a minimum of}} process planning and scheduling effort...|$|R

This type of environment is often loosely constrained and the emphasis is on computing schedules that are cost-efficient with respect to various optimisation criteria.

The developed system is being installed for trials at the plant, and further work towards developing a fully automated scheduling environment is planned...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In <b>batch</b> <b>manufacturing</b> processes, {{the total}} process {{variation}} is generally decomposed into batch-by-batch variation and within-batch variation. Since different variation components {{may be caused}} by different sources, separation, testing, and estimation of each variance component are essential to the process improvement. Most of the previous SPC research emphasized reducing variations due to assignable causes by implementing control charts for process monitoring. Different from this focus, this article aims to analyze and reduce inherent natural process variations by applying the ANOVA method. The key issue of using the ANOVA method is how to develop appropriate statistical models for all variation components of interest. The article provides a generic framework for decomposition of three typical variation components in <b>batch</b> <b>manufacturing</b> processes. For the purpose of variation root causes diagnosis, the corresponding linear contrasts are defined to represent the possible site variation patterns and the statistical nested effect models are developed accordingly. The article shows that the use of a full factor decomposition model can expedite the determination of the number of nested effect models and the model structure. Finally, an example is given for the variation reduction in the screening conductive gridline printing process for solar battery fabrication.

40|$|Abstract—Today’s {{manufacturing}} industries {{face more}} opportunities, pressure, and change than ever. Because of globalization, new competitors bring new tools and approaches to market. They {{compete for the}} same customers and offer high quality products with minimum lead time and reduce cost. The customers are also well-informed and their demands persist price-sensitive without compromising {{on the quality of}} the product. In striving to remain competitive, manufacturing industries must deliver products to customer at the lowest cost, at the best quality and in the minimum lead time. As a result, it becomes compulsory to design and implement the Manufacturing Execution System (MES) that support shorter product cycles with high quality and low cost. The MES is responsible of the comprehensive scheduling of manufacturing activities in the production system. It launches work orders, track production activities and quickly respond to random events. This paper presents a suitable manufacturing execution system for a <b>batched</b> process <b>manufacturing</b> industry. The <b>batched</b> process <b>manufacturing</b> industry was experiencing problems in inventory control, scheduling, material flow, equipment management and real time data collection. By analyzing the design need of the industry, a suitable manufacturing execution system is proposed.

The architecture of the MES for a manufacturing industry is described in this paper. System Module Functions are also discussed. Index Terms—Manufacturing, MES, Batch. I...|$|R
