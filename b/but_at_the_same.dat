5|$|All of Godwin's {{books written}} from 1970 to 1990 are fictional stories based on themes taken from Godwin's life.

The main protagonist is often restricted by family, tradition and patriarchy. Most of Godwin's early works include a prominent mother-daughter relationship as well.|$|E

Her efforts were not original, but extraordinary. No other politicians' wives shook hands with all the delegates, visited their homes, genuinely understood the concerns they had, aside from Imelda. She bombarded them with gifts when necessary.|$|E

However, unlike the Temenggong, Sultan Ali was unwilling to involve himself with {{the affairs of the}} state <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time complained of receiving insufficient allowance from the British.

5|$|Many industrially {{important}} compounds, such as ammonia, nitric acid, organic nitrates (propellants and explosives), and cyanides, contain nitrogen. The extremely strong {{triple bond}} in elemental nitrogen (N≡N), the second strongest bond in any diatomic molecule after carbon monoxide (CO), dominates nitrogen chemistry. This causes difficulty for both organisms and industry in converting N2 into useful compounds, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time means that burning, exploding, or decomposing nitrogen compounds to form nitrogen gas releases {{large amounts of}} often useful energy. Synthetically produced ammonia and nitrates are key industrial fertilisers, and fertiliser nitrates are key pollutants in the eutrophication of water systems.|$|E

The items, spells and equipment available to the player are based upon those in the original game, and although a large number have been omitted along with optional characters and some side quests, the original story was reproduced in very minute detail. The game was received with mixed reception, cited as an impressive achievement <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time criticized for its difficulty and choice of a target console.|$|E
5|$|The idea {{of group}} living has been {{discussed}} by many evolutionists for its costs and benefits.

This theory is not supported in the case of P.exclamans because the parasitism does not always increase with nest size and the predation rate was independent of size.|$|E

5|$|Barnes {{returned}} to Australia for the 1947–48 season, keen {{to win a}} place on the 1948 tour to England. He was worried that having played as a professional in the Lancashire League would damage his chance of further Test cricket, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time suggested that he had offers from other Lancashire League teams to fall back on should he not be picked. There was also concern that, with his wife now living in Scotland, he would breach the Australian rule that wives were not allowed to travel with Test cricketers. In fact, lack of form and opportunity were greater threats to Barnes's continued Test career. Arriving back with several state games having already been played, he failed to make runs for New South Wales and was not picked for the first two Tests against the Indian tourists, Bill Brown taking over as opener with Morris.|$|E
5|$|Rædwald was {{the first}} East Anglian king to be baptised, in 604. He {{maintained}} a Christian altar, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time continued to worship pagan gods. From 616, when pagan monarchs briefly returned in Kent and Essex, until Rædwald's death, East Anglia was the only Anglo-Saxon kingdom with a reigning baptised king. On his death in around 624, he was succeeded by his son Eorpwald, who was soon afterwards converted from paganism {{as a result of}} the influence of Edwin, but his new religion was evidently opposed in East Anglia and Eorpwald met his death at the hands of a pagan, Ricberht. After three years of apostasy, Christianity prevailed with the accession of Eorpwald's brother (or step-brother) Sigeberht, who had been baptised during his exile in Francia. Sigeberht oversaw the establishment of the first East Anglian see for Felix of Burgundy at Dommoc, probably at Dunwich. He later abdicated in favour of his brother Ecgric and retired to a monastery.|$|E
