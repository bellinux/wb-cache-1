40|$|Recently, the {{environmental}} impact of aircraft and rising fuel prices have become an increasing concern in the aviation industry. To address these problems, organizations such as NASA have set demanding goals for reducing aircraft emissions, fuel burn, and noise. In an effort to reach the goals, a movement toward more-electric aircraft and electric propulsion has emerged. With this movement, the number of critical electrical loads on an aircraft is increasing causing power system reliability to be a point of concern. Currently, power system reliability is maintained through the use of <b>back-up</b> <b>power</b> <b>supplies</b> such as batteries and ram-air-turbines (RATs). However, the increasing power requirements for critical loads will quickly outgrow the capacity of the emergency devices. Therefore, reliability needs to be addressed when designing the primary power distribution system. Power system reliability is a function of component reliability and redundancy. Component reliability is often not determined until detailed component design has occurred; however, the amount of redundancy in the system is often set during the system architecting phase. In order to meet the capacity and reliability requirements of future power distribution systems, a method for redundancy allocation during the system architecting phase is needed. This thesis presents an aircraft power system design methodology that is based upon the engineering decision process. The methodology provides a redundancy allocation strategy and quantitative trade-off environment to compare architecture and technology combinations based upon system capacity, weight, and reliability criteria. The methodology is demonstrated by architecting the power distribution system of an aircraft using turboelectric propulsion. The first step in the process is determining the design criteria which includes a 40 MW capacity requirement, a 20 MW capacity requirement for the an engine-out scenario, and a maximum catastrophic failure rate of one failure per billion flight hours. The next step is determining gaps between the performance of current power distribution systems and the requirements of the turboelectric system. A baseline architecture is analyzed by sizing the system using the turboelectric system power requirements and by calculating reliability using a stochastic flow network. To overcome the deficiencies discovered, new technologies and architectures are considered. Global optimization methods are used to find technology and architecture combinations that meet the system objectives and requirements. Lastly, a dynamic modeling environment is constructed to study the performance and stability of the candidate architectures. The combination of the optimization process and dynamic modeling facilitates the selection of a power system architecture that meets the system requirements and objectives. Ph. D...|$|R

Indoor accident configurations involves a wide range of scales, depending on the site and the type of hydrogen technology: a hydrogen dispenser in a warehouse (for hydrogen powered forklifts), a hydrogen powered vehicle in a garage, a fuel cell or hydrogen storage in a cabinet or in a section of a container (<b>back-up</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> portable power generation, etc.). Vents are an essential means to reduce the hydrogen concentration and the hydrogen flammable mass inside an enclosure when a leak occurs. In this context, the HyIndoor project [1] have addressed the issue of the safe indoor use of hydrogen and fuel cells systems for early markets applications (forklift refuelling and operation, <b>back-up</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> portable power generation). The project main aim has been to provide scientific and engineering knowledge for the specification of cost-effective means to control hazards specific to the use of hydrogen indoors or in confined space and developing state-of-the-art guidelines for European stakeholders [2]. The HyIndoor project has been co-funded by the Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking (FCH JU) that is a public-private partnership whose public partner is the European Commission. Within the project an extensive campaign of experiments and CFD simulations has been undertaken to provide data and information {{to address the issue of}} the safe indoor use of fuel cell and hydrogen technologies. Experimental data were also used for the validation of CFD models as described in Giannissi et al. [3]. Following the validation, additional CFD calculations have been performed to investigate some of those configurations that could not be included in the experimental campaign due to the limited time and resources. The objective of this paper is to describe the CFD analysis of the effects of some relevant parameters on the capability of the vent of reducing the gas concentration and the amount of flammable mass in a small scale enclosure. The selected parameters are the vent thickness, the presence of a rain protection device, and the presence of a duct.

However, the quality of {{hospital care}} for children in developing countries has often been found poor. As {{the first step of}} a country road map for improving hospital care for children, we assessed the baseline situation with respect to the quality of care provided to children under-five years age in district and sub-district level hospitals in Bangladesh. Methods Using adapted World Health Organization (WHO) hospital assessment tools and standards, an assessment of 18 randomly selected district (n= 6) and sub-district (n= 12) hospitals was undertaken. Teams of trained assessors used direct case observation, record review, interviews, and Management Information System (MIS) data to assess the quality of clinical case management and monitoring; infrastructure, processes and hospital administration; essential hospital and laboratory supports, drugs and equipment. Results Findings demonstrate that the overall quality of care provided in these hospitals was poor. No hospital had a functioning triage system to prioritise those children most in need of immediate care. Laboratory supports and essential equipment were deficient. Only one hospital had all of the essential drugs for paediatric care.

Stationary fuel cells {{may be used as}} an uninterruptible or <b>back-up</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> or to supply micro-grids. In particular, proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) are an attractive technology due to its high energy density, rigid and simple structure, low operating temperature and fast start-up characteristics. The power quality assessment of fuel cells as a viable power sources requires a good understanding of the fuel cell performance characteristics. This paper presents two novel data-driven methodologies for the identification of the main steady state (polarization curve) and the dynamic (impedance response) characteristics for fuel-cells allowing the development of rapid, accurate and empirical models based on the experimental data. M-NMF is a modified non-negative matrix factorization technique developed for the analysis of polarization curve data that allows to identify the three main contributions for the fuel-cell power degradation, while for impedance spectroscopy data, this paper proposes the use of fractional order transfer functions (FC-FOTC) to describe the main dynamic modes present in the fuel-cell. A brief description of these two approaches is presented, together with the analysis of a real experimental dataset obtained from a 12 W open cathode PEMFC stack to illustrate their potential and scope. While the former is instrumental for the deconvolution of the fuel cell polarization curves into its major components, the latter enables the estimation of the parameters related to the inherent transport and kinetic phenomena, thus opening the way, in both cases, for the interpretation of the effect of the operating conditions on the relative dominance and magnitude of these components and phenomena...|$|E

When the grid power is unavailable in remote areas there are variety of back-up electrical power systems like valve-regulated lead acid (VRLA) battery systems, engine-generator sets, ultra capacitors, flywheels, and new battery technologies that strive to provide back-up power. Hydrogen Energy and fuel cell technology compete with traditional technologies meeting back-up power requirements in stationary applications. Recent collaboration between Victoria University, Sustainable Energy Fuel Cells Australia (SEFCA) and Acta Energy has resulted in thorough laboratory testing for H 2 generation and data compilation of fuel cells in a back-up power operation in Power Systems Research Laboratory at Victoria University. The authors of this paper suggests that the use of EL 100 H 2 generator and T- 1000 1. 2 kW PEMFC Power Generation System is capable to compete with traditional technologies to offer back-up power when there is no base load or PV or wind power.

40|$|Background: The Telemedicine Network Project in {{the state}} of Karnataka was {{introduced}} in the year 2001. This is a value added service from the health department of the government of Karnataka. There is no data on its utilization pattern or its future challenges. This study was conducted from a nodal center {{in order to understand the}} above two issues. Materials and Methods: We used a 51 -item survey questionnaire that captured data on infrastructure, technical aspects, and connectivity parameters, tele-consultations including emergency services, human resources, and coordination aspects both at the client as well as the nodal centers. Results: Services are operational in 25 district hospitals across the state for the past 3. 3 (2. 1) years. Space was ear-marked across all the client centers. <b>Back-up</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> was present only in 10 (40 %) of the client centers. Quality of satellite connection was acceptable in 18 (72 %) centers. Approximately, 3. 0 (1. 8) phone calls had to be made to the nodal centers to obtain one appointment. Monthly maximum and minimum cases done over the past 2 year period were reported as 58. 2 (66. 2) and 13. 5 (16. 2) respectively. Each consultation lasted for 26. 1 (13. 9) min. Tele-consultation advices from nodal centers were carried out completely in only 9 (36 %) centers. Only in 13 (52 %) client centers, did doctors keep up with appointment regularly. All technicians reported that the training they received was inadequate. 16 (64 %) technicians were asked to do works that were not pertaining to telemedicine. 19 (76 %) technicians had frequently felt insecurities about their jobs. Conclusions: The telemedicine service has been largely under-utilized and has failed to deliver the promise in Karnataka state.

For a microcontroller-based UPS, a full hardware-based UPS are gradually being replaced by microprocessor or microcontroller-based counterparts, with significant improvement in ease of design, flexibility of the control software and overall reduction in development cost. Since a UPS incorporates a relatively large number of detection, protection and control functions, {{it is important to}} develop an organized approach to the identification and implementation of these requirements. The purpose of his project is to provide an efficient time management for users to continue their work with personal computer even though an outage had occurred. Since this project involves hardware-software co-design, so that knowledge from a number of engineering disciplines is necessary for arriving at a workable solution. This microcontroller-based Uninterruptible <b>Power</b> <b>Supply</b> will enable the users to monitor their current battery level through the installed Liquid Crystal Display. One of the advantages applying microcontroller for the Uninterruptible <b>Power</b> <b>Supply</b> is that the system is more reliable in functions compares to the conventional Uninterruptible <b>Power</b> <b>Supply</b> available in the market...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A Data Center can {{consist of}} {{a large group of}} {{networked}} servers and associated power distribution, networking, and cooling equipment. All these applications consume enormous amounts of energy which result in a significant increase in energy inefficiency problems. One of the causes of Data Center energy inefficiency power distribution is from the uninterruptible <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> (UPS). The UPS system is an alternate or backup source of power linking between mains <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> and end critical loads in order to provide <b>back-up</b> <b>power</b> and protection for the sensitive load. This study attempts to answer the question of how can future UPS topology and technology improve the efficiency of Data Center. In order to analyze the impact of different UPS technologies and their operating efficiencies, a model for a medium size Data Centre is developed, and load schedules and worked schematics were created to analyze and test the components of each of the UPS system topologies...|$|R
