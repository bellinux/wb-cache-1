40|$|A {{variety of}} {{platinum}} group minerals (PGM) {{occurs in the}} Jinchuan deposit, China. Four different PGM assemblages have been distinguished as follows: The first group, mainly sperrylite, occurs within altered olivines.

The fourth group is composed of platinum- and palladium-dominated tellurobismuthides and bismuthides, and occurs in the fractures of sulfide minerals. Their chemistry and mineral paragenesis indicate different origins for the four PGM groups.

40|$|Pressure-induced {{transitions}} from ordered intermetallic phases to substitutional alloys to semi-ordered phases were studied {{in a series}} of <b>bismuth</b> <b>tellurides.</b> Using angle-dispersive x-ray diffraction, the compounds Bi 4 Te 5, BiTe, and Bi 2 Te were observed to form alloys with the disordered body-centered cubic (bcc) crystal structure upon compression to above 14 [...] 19 GPa at room temperature. The BiTe and Bi 2 Te alloys and the previously discovered high-pressure alloys of Bi 2 Te 3 and Bi 4 Te 3 were all found to show atomic ordering after gentle annealing at very moderate temperatures of 100 C. Upon annealing, BiTe transforms from the bcc to the B 2 (CsCl) crystal structure type, and the other phases adopt semi-disordered variants thereof, featuring substitutional disorder on one of the two crystallographic sites. The transition pressures and atomic volumes of the alloy phases show systematic variations across the Bi_mTe_n series including the end members Bi and Te. First-principles calculations were performed to characterize the electronic structure and chemical bonding properties of B 2 -type BiTe and to identify the driving forces of the ordering transition. The calculated Fermi surface of B 2 -type BiTe has an intricate structure and is predicted to undergo three topological changes between 20 and 60 GPa.

50|$|<b>Bismuth</b> <b>telluride</b> is a narrow-gap layered {{semiconductor}} with a trigonal unit cell.

Bi2Te3 cleaves easily along the trigonal axis due to Van der Waals bonding between neighboring tellurium atoms. Due to this, <b>bismuth</b> <b>telluride</b> based materials used for power generation or cooling applications must be polycrystalline. Furthermore, the Seebeck coefficient of bulk Bi2Te3 becomes compensated around room temperature, forcing the materials used in power generation devices to be an alloy of bismuth, antimony, tellurium, and selenium.|$|E

40|$|The {{widespread}} use of thermoelectric technology is constrained by a relatively low conversion efficiency of the bulk alloys, which is evaluated {{in terms of a}} dimensionless figure of merit (zT). The zT of bulk alloys can be improved by reducing lattice thermal conductivity through grain boundary and point-defect scattering, which target low- and high-frequency phonons. Dense dislocation arrays formed at low-energy grain boundaries by liquid-phase compaction in Bi_(0. 5) Sb_(1. 5) Te_ 3 (<b>bismuth</b> antimony <b>telluride)</b> effectively scatter midfrequency phonons, leading to a substantially lower lattice thermal conductivity. Full-spectrum phonon scattering with minimal charge-carrier scattering dramatically improved the zT to 1. 86 ± 0. 15 at 320 kelvin (K). Further, a thermoelectric cooler confirmed the performance with a maximum temperature difference of 81 K, which is much higher than current commercial Peltier cooling devices...|$|R

40|$|The Navachab {{gold mine}} in the Damara belt of central Namibia is {{characterized}} by a polymetallic Au-Bi-As-Cu-Ag ore assemblage, including pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite, arsenopyrite, bismuth, gold, bismuthinite, and <b>bismuth</b> <b>tellurides.</b> Gold is hosted by quartz sulfide veins and semimassive sulfide lenses that are developed in a near-vertical sequence of shelf-type metasedimentary rocks, including marble, calcsilicate rock, and biotite schist. The sequence has been intruded by abundant syntectonic lamprophyre, aplite, and pegmatite dikes, documenting widespread igneous activity coeval with mineralization. The majority of quartz from the veins has delta(18) O values of 14 to 15 per mil (V-SMOW). The total variations in delta(18) O values of the biotite schist and calcsilicate rock are relatively small (12 - 14 parts per thousand), whereas the marble records steep gradients in delta(18) O values (17 - 21 parts per thousand), the lowest values being recorded at the vein margins. Despite this, there is no correlation between delta(18) O and delta(13) C values and the carbonate content of the rocks, indicating that fluid-rock interaction alone cannot explain the isotopic gradients. In addition, the marble records increased delta(13) C values at the contact to the veins, possibly related to a change in the physicochemical conditions during fluid-rock interaction. Gold is interpreted to have precipitated in equilibrium with metamorphic find (delta(18) O 12 - 14 parts per thousand; delta D = - 40 to - 60 parts per thousand) at peak metamorphic conditions of ca. 550 degrees C and 2 kbars, consistent with isotopic fractionations between coexisting calcite, garnet, and clinopyroxene in the alteration halos. The most likely source of the mineralizing fluid was a midcrustal fluid in equilibrium with the Damaran metapelites that underwent prograde metamorphism at amphibolite- to granulite-facies grades. Although there is no isotopic evidence for the contribution of magmatic fluids, they may have been important in contributing to the overall hydraulic regime and high apparent geothermal gradients (ca. 80 degrees C/km(- 1)) in the mine area...|$|R

40|$|Photodetectors are {{typically}} based either on photocurrent generation from electron–hole pairs in semiconductor structures or on bolometry for wavelengths that are below bandgap absorption. In both cases, resonant plasmonic and nanophotonic structures {{have been successfully}} used to enhance performance.

We show that such structures are tunable and are capable of wavelength-specific detection, with an input power responsivity of up to 38 V[*]W^(– 1), referenced to incident illumination, and bandwidth of nearly 3 kHz. This is obtained by combining resonant absorption and thermoelectric junctions within a single suspended membrane nanostructure, yielding a bandgap-independent photodetection mechanism.
