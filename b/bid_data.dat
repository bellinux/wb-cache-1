40|$|In the {{electricity}} market environment, bidding strategies employed by generation companies may have significant impacts {{on their own}} benefits, and on the operating behaviors of an electricity market as well. Hence, how to develop optimal bidding strategies for generation companies or how to analyze strategic behaviors of them and hence {{to figure out the}} potential market power abuse is now a very active research area. A possibility theory based approach is proposed in this work for building optimal bidding strategies for generation companies. Based on historical <b>bidding</b> <b>data,</b> the available (production cost) data before the power industry restructuring and experts' heuristic knowledge, the well-known fuzzy set theory is employed to represent the estimated bidding behaviors of rival generation companies, and a fuzzy programming model is developed and a solution method follows. The approach is especially suitable for those electricity markets recently launched, since sufficient historical <b>bidding</b> <b>data</b> is not available and hence probability methods cannot be employed. Finally, a sample example with six generation companies participating in an electricity market is served for demonstrating the essential features of the presented approach. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study European banks’ demand for {{short-term}} funds (liquidity) {{during the summer}} 2007 subprime market crisis. We use <b>bidding</b> <b>data</b> from the European Central Bank’s auctions for one-week loans, their main channel of monetary policy implementation. Through a model of bidding, we show that banks’ behavior reflects their cost of obtaining short-term funds elsewhere (i. e., in the interbank market) {{as well as a}} strategic response to other bidders. We find considerable heterogeneity across banks in their willingness to pay for short-term funds supplied in these auctions. Accounting for the strategic component is important: while a naive interpretation of the raw <b>bidding</b> <b>data</b> may suggest that virtually all banks suffered a dramatic increase in the cost of obtaining funds in the interbank market, we find that for about one third of the banks, the change in bidding behavior was simply a strategic response. Using a complementary data set, we also find that banks’ pre-turmoil liquidity costs, as estimated by our model, are predictive of their post-turmoil liquidity costs, and that there is considerable heterogeneity in these costs with respect to the country-of-origin. Finally, among the publicly traded banks, the willingness to pay for short-term funds {{in the second half of}} 2007 are predictive of stock prices in late 2008. ...|$|R

This effect is economically significant and robust when controlling for market discount, earnings management, analysts forecast dispersion, and self-selection bias. Moreover, this negative relation is stronger for stocks with more stringent short-sale constraints.

40|$|Internet auctions for consumers' {{goods are}} an {{increasingly}} popular selling venue. We {{have observed that}} many sellers, instead of offering their entire inventory in a single auction, split it into sequential auctions of smaller lots, thereby reducing the negative market impact of larger lots. Information technology also {{makes it possible to}} collect and analyze detailed <b>bid</b> <b>data</b> from online auctions. In this paper, we develop and test a new model of sequential online auctions to explore the potential benefits of using real <b>bid</b> <b>data</b> from earlier auctions to improve the management of future auctions. Assuming a typical truth-revealing auction model, we quantify the effect of the lot size on the closing price and derive a closed-form solution for the problem of allocating inventory across multiple auctions when bidder valuation distributions are known. We also develop a decision methodology for allocating inventory across multiple auctions that dynamically incorporates the results of previous auctions as feedback into the management of subsequent auctions, and updating the lot size and number of auctions. We demonstrate how information signals from previous auctions can be used to update the auctioneer's beliefs about the customers' valuation distribution, and then to significantly increase the seller's profit potential. We use several examples to reveal the benefits of using detailed transaction data for the management of sequential, multi-unit, online auctions and we demonstrate how these benefits are influenced by the inventory holding costs, the number of bidders, and the dispersion of consumers' valuations.
