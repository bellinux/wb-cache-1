5000|$|In {{television}} <b>broadcast</b> <b>camera</b> work, {{the amount}} of headroom seen by the production crew is slightly greater than the amount seen by home viewers, whose frames are reduced in area by about 5%. To adjust for this, <b>broadcast</b> <b>camera</b> headroom is slightly expanded so that home viewers will see the correct amount of headroom. Professional video camera viewfinders and professional video monitors often include an overscan setting to compare between full screen resolution and [...] "domestic cut-off" [...] {{as an aid to}} achieving good headroom and lead room.|$|E

50|$|The MineCam is {{a remote}} {{exploration}} camera built by I.A.Recordings. It {{is used for}} mine shaft exploration and other similar environments. It was originally conceptualized in 1988, and since went under several design revisions. The name MineCam, is a pun on MiniCam, an early hand-held <b>broadcast</b> <b>camera</b> built by CBS Laboratories.|$|E
5000|$|Pool {{coverage}} is sometimes required {{because of the}} nature of the news event being covered. For example, judges will often allow only one <b>broadcast</b> <b>camera</b> in the courtroom during a trial. As a result, interested broadcasters will select one of their own to provide the [...] "pool camera" [...] for the day, with that organization agreeing to share the footage with all other broadcasters in the pool.|$|E
50|$|Plumbicon is a {{registered}} trademark of Philips for its Lead(II) oxide (PbO) target vidicons. Used frequently in <b>broadcast</b> <b>camera</b> applications, these tubes have low output, but a high signal-to-noise ratio. They had excellent resolution compared to Image Orthicons, but lacked the artificially sharp edges of IO tubes, which caused some of the viewing audience to perceive them as softer. CBS Labs invented the first outboard edge enhancement circuits to sharpen the edges of Plumbicon generated images.|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} we {{describe}} a family of technologies designed to enhance live television sports broadcasts. Our algorithms provide a means for tracking the game object (the ball in baseball, the puck in hockey); instrumenting <b>broadcast</b> <b>cameras</b> and creating informative graphical visualizations regarding the object’s trajectory. The graphics are embedded in the live image in real time in a photo realistic manner. The demands of live network broadcasting require {{that many of our}} effects operate on live video streams at frame-rate (60 Hz) with latencies of less than a second. Some effects can be composed off-line, but must be Preprint submitted to IEEE MultiMedia Magazinecomplete in a matter of seconds. The final image sequence must also be compelling, appealing and informative to the critical human eye. Components of our approach include: (1) Instrumention and calibration of <b>broadcast</b> <b>cameras</b> so that the geometry of their field of view is known at all times, (2) Tracking items of interest such as balls and pucks and in some cases participants (e. g., cars in auto racing), (3) Creation and transformation of graphical enhancements such as illustrative object highlights (e. g., a glowing puck trail) or advertisements to the same field of view as the <b>broadcast</b> <b>cameras</b> and (4) Techniques for combining these elements into informative on-air images. We describe each of these technologies and illustrate their use in network broadcast of hockey, baseball, football and auto racing. We focus on vision based tracking of game objects...|$|R
50|$|Link {{started as}} an {{industrial}} camera manufacturer but soon moved into broadcast equipment when the BBC approached it {{to develop a}} successor to the commercially successful EMI 2001, when EMI's own design for the 2001's successor, the 2005, failed to meet expected standards when launched around 1975. The poor performance of this camera considering its development cost led to EMI exiting the <b>broadcast</b> <b>camera</b> industry. A similar fate befell Link around 10-15 years later upon {{the release of the}} Link 130 (further down this page).|$|E
50|$|PRG {{provided}} the tour's 4K (UHD) <b>Broadcast</b> <b>Camera</b> System, {{the first time}} it has been used on a concert tour. A combination of several products, it connects cameras and LED wall processors via optical fibre cable, a necessity due to the large amount of data being transferred and the long distance over which it must travel. Designed to operate at the highest broadcast standards, the system provides video at 60 frames per second at a resolution of 3,840 × 2,160 pixels. The broadcast system can be assembled in an hour and be operated by a single video engineer.|$|E

50|$|As {{supplied}} by EMI, the 2001 and the later 2001/1, {{did not have}} any form of ACT (anti-comet tail) or HOP (highlight overload protection). This is why its performance was poor, in this respect, when compared with the next generation of cameras supplied in the 1970s. None of the first generation of true <b>broadcast</b> <b>cameras</b> in the middle to late 1960s had ACT, so the EMI 2001 was not unusual.|$|R
50|$|There {{have also}} been {{numerous}} complaints about the small black and white viewfinders. B&W finders are actually strongly preferred by generations of <b>broadcast</b> <b>camera</b> operators, who understand that a high resolution black & white finder is a very highly refined instrument. It has about 3 times the resolution of a color finder, which makes achieving critical focus easier. An influx of camera operators from the film industry however, has created demand for a color viewfinder. To address this, Panavision uses the Sony HDVF-C30W TFT color LCD viewfinder (960x540 pixels), which is compatible with both the CineAlta and the Genesis cameras. A Digital cinema camera competitor to the Genesis, the D-20, incorporates a reflex optical viewfinder to address this concern. Other similar HD-resolution cameras are the Sony F35, ARRI Alexa, and RedOne.|$|E

On December 9, Beast was awarded with the Yepp Newcomer Award at the 25th Golden Disk Awards. According to album sold research site Hanteo Chart on December 11, 2010, Beast have sold 107,006 copies from January - October 2010 with 4 of their released mini-albums, including their first mini-album. This made Beast as the only rookie group {{out of all the}} boy/girl groups who have sold over 100,000 copies in 2010. This feat just shows the groups growing popularity. Beast held their first solo concert on December 12, 2010 at the Jamsil Indoor Stadium in Seoul. The concert's official title was 'Welcome to the Beast Airline'.|$|E
5000|$|The 110 was Link's {{first attempt}} at a colour <b>broadcast</b> <b>camera</b> and around 200 cameras were manufactured. Styling {{was based on the}} famous EMI 2001 colour camera but at an {{economical}} price, including what some claim to be a very flimsy casing that was not of rugged design.The camera consisted of a closed body and an internal lens from a range of manufacturers, like the EMI 2001, leading to similar claims that the design was [...] "boxy". The camera was capable of both studio and outside broadcast use and at the BBC found its way into TC6, TC8 and several presentation studios at Television Centre, BBC Lime Grove, BBC Bristol, the Open University studio in Milton Keynes, BBC Wood Norton Training Centre, Thames Television's Euston Road studios (with RCA TK-47s at Teddington) and onto several BBC outside broadcast vehicles. The 110 was seen as a good, cheap, modern option which was lightweight and easier to carry compared to the much older and heavier EMI 2001 camera.|$|E
50|$|Launched on 1993, the Vinten Vector {{range of}} pan and tilt heads {{are used for}} {{television}} studios and outside broadcast television production. The first Vector head, the Vector 70, was famous for its unique pantographic counterbalance mechanism that allowed heavy <b>broadcast</b> <b>cameras</b> to be balanced {{without the use of}} interchangeable cams. The Vector 700 and Vector 750, developed from the Vector 70, can be seen in use at nearly all major broadcasting events.|$|R
50|$|With the {{increasing}} bandwidth requirements of developments such as 4K/UHDTV, HFR (high frame rate) and HDR (high dynamic range) {{the use of}} triax is declining in the TV industry. Most of the recently developed <b>broadcast</b> <b>cameras</b> from the leading manufacturers have hybrid single-mode fibre and copper power cores which supersede the older triax connectivity. The advantages of the hybrid copper/fibre over triax cable are noise immunity due to the optical isolation and extremely high bandwidth.|$|R

5000|$|... "We {{really wanted}} to do {{something}} that had never been seen before, using TV, text, and imagery. It was a very big and expensive project to put together. We allowed ourselves to be carried away by new technology." [...] —Larry Mullen, Jr. To accommodate the video production, the equivalent of a television studio control room—costing US$3.5 million—was built for the tour. Beneath the stage, Dodds, the video director, operated a system custom-built by Philips called CD-i. It used five <b>broadcast</b> <b>camera</b> systems, 12 Laser Disc players, and a satellite dish, and it required 12 directors, 19 video crew members, and two separate mix stations to operate. To enable each band member to perform away from their personal monitor speakers on the main stage, sound engineers used joysticks to control a panning matrix for each member's in-ear monitor as they moved around. Despite the production's complexity, the group decided that flexibility in the shows' length and content was a priority. Guitarist the Edge said, [...] "That was one of the more important decisions we made early on, that we wouldn't sacrifice flexibility, so we designed a system that is both extremely complicated and high-tech but also incredibly simple and hands-on, controlled by human beings... in that sense, it's still a live performance." [...] This flexibility allowed for improvisations and deviations from the planned programme. Eno recommended that U2 film its own video tapes so that they could be edited and looped into the video displays more easily, instead of relying entirely on pre-sequenced video. Eno explained, [...] "their show depends on some kind of response to what's happening at the moment in that place. So if it turns out they want to do a song for five minutes longer, they can actually loop through the material again so that you're not suddenly stuck with black screens halfway through the fifth verse." [...] The band shot new video for the displays {{over the course of the}} tour.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Cameras {{are often}} mounted on {{platforms}} that can move like rovers, booms, gantries and aircraft. People operate such platforms to capture desired views of scene or target. To avoid collisions {{with the environment}} and occlusions, such platforms often possess redundant degrees-of-freedom. As a result, manipulating such platforms demands much skill. Visual-servoing some degreesof-freedom may reduce operator burden and improve tracking performance. This concept, which we call human-in-the-loop visualservoing, is demonstrated in this paper and applies a filter and feedforward controller to a <b>broadcast</b> <b>camera</b> boom...|$|E
40|$|Live sports {{broadcast}} is seeing a large {{increase in the}} number of cameras used for filming. More cameras can provide bet-ter coverage of the field and a wider range of experiences for viewers. However, choosing optimal cameras for broadcast demands a high level of concentration, awareness and expe-rience from sports broadcast directors. We present an auto-matic assistant to help select likely candidates from a large array of possible cameras. Sports directors can then choose the final <b>broadcast</b> <b>camera</b> from the reduced suggestion set. Our assistant uses both widely acknowledged cinematogra-phy guidelines for sports directing, as well as a data-driven approach that learns specific styles from directors...|$|E
