Absorber foils increase the lifetime of the detector. More advanced techniques have been implemented to negate the use of absorber foils and the associated difficulties that arise through the use of it. In most cases, medium heavy ion beams, typically 36Cl ions, have been used for ERDA so far with energies around 30 MeV. Depth resolution and element profiling of thin films has been greatly advanced using elastic recoil detection analysis.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I present {{the design and}} {{experimental}} demonstration of the first photonic band gap (PBG) accelerator at 17. 140 GHz. A photonic band gap structure is a one-, two- or three-dimensional periodic metallic and/or dielectric system (for example, of rods), which acts like a filter, reflecting rf fields in some frequency range and allowing rf fields at other frequencies to transmit through. Metal PBG structures are attractive for the Ku-band accelerators, {{because they can be}} employed to suppress wakefields. Wakefields are unwanted modes affecting the beam propagation or even destroying the <b>beam.</b> <b>Suppression</b> of wakefields is important. In this thesis, the theory of metallic PBG structures is explained and the Photonic Band Gap Structure Simulator (PBGSS) code is presented. PBGSS code was well benchmarked and the ways to'benchmark the code are described. Next, the concept of a PBG resonator is introduced. PBG resonators were modelled with Ansoft HFSS code, and a single-mode PBG resonator was designed. The HFSS design of a travelling-wave multi- cell PBG structure was performed. The multicell structure was built, cold-tested and tuned. Finally, the hot-test PBG accelerator demonstration was performed at the accelerator laboratory. The PBG accelerating structure was installed inside a vacuum chamber on the Haimson Research Corporation (HRC) accelerator beam line and powered with 2 MW from the HRC klystron. The electron bunches were produced by the HRC accelerator. The electron beam was accelerated by 1. 4 MeV inside the PBG structure. by Evgenya I. Smirnova. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{suppression}} of interferences from atomic and molecular isobars {{is a key}} requirement for the extension of accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) {{to the analysis of}} new cosmogenic isotopes and for increasing the range of applications for small AMS systems. In earlier work, it was shown that unwanted isobars can be eliminated by anion-gas reactions (Lith-erland et al. 2007). Recently, a prototype system in which such reactions could be applied to ions from an AMS ion source, the Isobar Separator for Anions (ISA), was described (Eliades et al. 2009). This system decelerates the beam of rare anions from keV to eV energies, guides them through a single radiofrequency quadrupole (RFQ) gas cell, and re-accelerates them for further analysis in a 2. 5 MV AMS system. Tests of this system with Cl and S anions and NO 2 gas showed a {{suppression of}} S with respect to Cl of over 6 orders of magnitude, with a transmission of ~ 30 % for the Cl beam. In this work, results of the anal-ysis of a range of standard reference materials are reported; these show the linearity of the system for measuring the 36 Cl/ 35 Cl ratio over a span of 2 orders of magnitude. Further tests, using the AMS system as a diagnostic tool, have provided clues about the loss of Cl at higher cell pressure {{and the nature of the}} residual low level of S transmission.

40|$|The {{internal}} chirality of Cooper pairs {{is shown}} to modify strongly the response of a superconductor to the local heating by a laser <b>beam.</b> The <b>suppression</b> of the chiral order parameter inside the hot spot appears to induce the supercurrents flowing around the spot region. The chirality affects also the sequential stage of thermal quench developing according to the Kibble-Zurek scenario: besides the generation of vortex-antivortex pairs the quench facilitates the formation of superconducting domains with different chirality. These fingerprints of the chiral superconducting state can be probed by any experimental techniques sensitive to the local magnetic field. The supercurrents encircling the hot spot originate from the inhomogeneity of the state with the broken time reversal symmetry and their detection would provide a convenient alternative to the search of the spontaneous edge currents sensitive to the boundary properties.

The inverse problem is to optimize a position and a size of a certain enforcing laminate, so that to minimize the amplitude of the vibration. For this aim we first model the construction by a vertical rectangular elastic body. A simpler model is considered as an elastic beam clamped to the foundation. The first problem both for direct and inverse problems is reduced to an integral equation {{with respect to the}} tangential stress over the basis of the construction.

To calculate the target temperatures, a finite difference method (FDM) solver incorporating the additional heat removal effects of subcooled boiling was developed. Validation of the energy balance results from the finite difference method calculations showed the iterative solver converged to heat removal results within about 3 % of the expected value. Testing of the extraction nozzle at 1. 43 mA and 100 kV determined that overheating of the target did not occur as the measured neutron flux of the generator was near predicted values. Many factors, including the target stopping power, deuterium atomic species, and target loading ratio, affect the flux distribution of the HFNG neutron generator. A detailed analysis to understand these factors effects is presented. Comparison of the calculated flux of the neutron generator using deuteron depth implantation data, neutron flux distribution data, and deuterium atomic species data matched the experimentally calculated flux determined from indium foil irradiations. An overview of experiments using the HFNG, including medical isotope cross section measurements, geochronology, delayed gamma measurements from uranium fission, and single event upset of cpu's is discussed. Future work should focus on the reduction of beam induced arcing between the shroud and the vacuum chamber. Investigation of insulator charge build-up, as well as electrical flash-over of insulators should be explored. The reduction of beam induced arcing will allow for larger beam currents and acceleration voltages, therefore increasing the neutron flux...|$|R
