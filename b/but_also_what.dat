5|$|Later that night, Fung sends more killers to Kwai's {{refuge in}} order to {{eliminate}} Kwai's syndicate. A gunfight ensues, with the four men emerging victorious. As they escape, Kwai's syndicate lose track of Costello, who is walking through a crowded street, seemingly lost in the night rain. He pulls out the Polaroid pictures that he took of the hitmen earlier, and tries to find them in the crowd. They meet again, but it becomes evident that Costello {{has a problem with}} his memory, and has rapidly forgotten who his friends are, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>what</b> he is doing. The hitmen try to explain to Costello that he is seeking revenge for his daughter, but Costello does not recognize her, nor does he understand the concept of revenge. The three men give up in despair, and take him to a beach where they meet a pregnant woman (Michelle Ye) with a group of children. Kwai gives her a stack of money and ask her to take care of Costello. Kwai's syndicate return to Macau because they lost contact with Kwai's cousin Tony who supplies their ammunition. When they reach the landfill where Tony is living, they find him and his partner dying as they were tortured by Fung and his gang. Soon, a large group of assassins sent by Fung show up and a gunfight ensues. Kwai, Chu and Fat Lok are killed. Costello and the pregnant woman learn of the shootout during a news report.|$|E

There was an ongoing debate as to whether Boggins should be put down or not.|$|E
25|$|Interestingly, viewing tools potentiates motor {{activity}} {{related to the}} specific tool-use. This phenomenon is different from other classes of objects, and indicates that tools are not viewed just based off what they are, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>what</b> they actually do. In just viewing tools, activation of left lateralized areas {{are very similar to}} the use/pantomiming areas as noted above. These areas include the ventral premotor cortex, left inferior frontal gyrus and some parietal areas. The main difference is that tools being used elicit greater activation in ventral brain regions, and decreased activation in primary motor areas. Additionally, there were very similar areas of activation in naming tools and viewing tools. There were other areas of activation in the left hemisphere, possibly reflecting the lateralization of language.|$|E

25|$|A {{fundamental}} {{premise of}} REBT is humans {{do not get}} emotionally disturbed by unfortunate circumstances, but by how they construct their views of these circumstances through their language, evaluative beliefs, meanings and philosophies about the world, themselves and others. This concept has been attributed {{as far back as}} the Roman philosopher Epictetus, who is often cited as utilizing similar ideas in antiquity. In REBT, clients usually learn and begin to apply this premise by learning the A-B-C-D-E-F model of psychological disturbance and change. The A-B-C model states that it is not an A, adversity (or activating event) that cause disturbed and dysfunctional emotional and behavioral Cs, consequences, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>what</b> people B, irrationally believe about the A, adversity. A, adversity can be an external situation, or a thought, a feeling or other kind of internal event, and it can refer to an event in the past, present, or future.|$|E
500|$|Friedrich said, [...] "The artist should paint {{not only}} what he sees before him, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>what</b> he sees within him. If, however, he sees nothing within him, then he should also refrain from {{painting}} that which he sees before him. Otherwise, his pictures will be like those folding screens behind which one expects to find only the sick or the dead." [...] Expansive skies, storms, mist, forests, ruins and crosses bearing witness {{to the presence of}} God are frequent elements in Friedrich's landscapes. Though death finds symbolic expression in boats that move away from shore—a Charon-like motif—and in the poplar tree, it is referenced more directly in paintings like The Abbey in the Oakwood (1808–10), in which monks carry a coffin past an open grave, toward a cross, and through the portal of a church in ruins.|$|E
2500|$|His {{return was}} {{credited}} to several factors – most obviously his good season with Warwickshire (after 11 matches he'd taken 38 wickets) and {{an injury to}} Daniel Vettori, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>what</b> the New Zealand Herald called [...] "the dearth of decent spinners on the first-class scene in New Zealand". He was selected ahead of second spinner Tarun Nethula for both test losses, taking seven wickets in the series.|$|E

2500|$|Through social learning, fishes {{might learn}} not only {{where to get}} food, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>what</b> to get {{and how to get}} it. Hatchery-raised salmon can be taught to quickly accept novel, live prey items similar to those they will {{encounter}} once they will be released in the wild, simply by watching an experienced salmon take such prey. [...] The same is true of young perch. [...] In the laboratory, juvenile European seabass can learn to push a lever in order to obtain food just by watching experienced individuals use the lever.|$|E
2500|$|The {{publisher}} is Mother Tongue Publishing Inc., a new {{publishing company}} based in Manila, Philippines formed in November 2006 by Mario and Beaulah Taguiwalo. Their mission is to publish books in as many languages as possible. They are inspired by the words of science fiction writer Ursula K. Le Guin: “Literature takes shape and life in the body, in the wombs of the mother tongue.” They also agree with neuro-scientist Elkhonon Goldberg who refers to mother tongues as “an extremely adaptive and powerful device for modeling not only what is, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>what</b> will be, what could be, and what we want and {{do not want to}} be.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Water {{rights are}} {{extremely}} important to American Indians, especially those American Indian tribes living in the West, where water supplies are limited. American Indian reservations, and those who live within them, rely on water sources for the water necessary {{for them to be}} self-sufficient. American Indian reservations rely on streams and rivers for agricultural purposes. Not only is the water itself important to the American Indian reservations, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>what</b> the water contains. By having the rights to an area of water, one also gains rights to what is in the water. [...] This gives an implied right to fish the waters. [...] Because life relies on water, it may {{be fair to say that}} who controls the water ultimately has control over life on the reservation.|$|E

2500|$|The stable carbon isotope ratio, δ13C, is {{measured}} against Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite (VPDB). The stable carbon isotopes are fractionated primarily by photosynthesis (Faure, 2004). [...] The 13C/12C ratio {{is also an}} indicator of paleoclimate: {{a change in the}} ratio in the remains of plants indicates a change in the amount of photosynthetic activity, and thus in how favorable the environment was for the plants. During photosynthesis, organisms using the [...] C3 pathway show different enrichments compared to those using the [...] C4 pathway, allowing scientists not only to distinguish organic matter from abiotic carbon, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>what</b> type of photosynthetic pathway the organic matter was using. [...] Occasional spikes in the global 13C/12C ratio have also been useful as stratigraphic markers for chemostratigraphy, especially during the Paleozoic.|$|E
2500|$|The {{history of}} the public and {{critical}} reaction to Corneille's Le Cid may be found in other articles (he was criticized for his use of sources, his violation of good taste, and for other irregularities not conforming to Aristotian or Horacian rules), but its impact was stunning. [...] Cardinal Richelieu asked the newly formed Académie française to investigate and pronounce on the criticism (it was the Academy's first official judgement), and the controversy reveals a growing attempt to control and regulate theater and theatrical forms. [...] This would be the beginning of 17th-century [...] "classicism". Corneille continued to write plays through 1674 (mainly tragedies, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>what</b> he called [...] "heroic comedies"). Many were successful, although the [...] "irregularities" [...] of his theatrical methods were increasingly criticized (notably by François Hédelin, abbé d'Aubignac); the success of Jean Racine from the late 1660s signaled the end of his preeminence.|$|E
2500|$|The {{early years}} of the group were marked by a {{conscious}} rejection not just of Birmingham's artistic conservatism – John Melville having six paintings banned from an exhibition at Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery in 1938 for being [...] "detremental (sic) to public sensibility" [...] – <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>what</b> they saw as the inauthenticity of the Surrealist Group in England, which had formed in London around Roland Penrose and Herbert Read. The London group, it was felt, [...] "did not understand surrealism", reducing it to a mere continuation of English romanticism, and the Birmingham artists concentrated instead on building links with what they saw as the more authentic surrealists on the continent. This culminated in the open letter sent by Maddox and the Melvilles refusing to exhibit at the 1936 London International Surrealist Exhibition, decrying the presence of [...] "artists who in their day to day activities, professional habits and ethics could be called anti-surrealist".|$|E

2500|$|On June 29, 2011, Cromitie, Onta Williams, and David Williams {{were each}} sentenced, {{for their part}} in the {{attempted}} attack, to 25 years in prison by Manhattan Federal Judge Colleen McMahon. The judge criticized not only the defendants, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>what</b> she viewed as the government's overzealous handling of the investigation. Referring to Cromitie, she said, [...] "The essence of what occurred here is that a government, understandably zealous to protect its citizens from terrorism, came upon a man both bigoted and suggestible, one who was incapable of committing {{an act of terrorism}} on his own. It created acts of terrorism out of his fantasies of bravado and bigotry, and then made those fantasies come true." [...] She added, [...] "The government did not have to infiltrate and foil some nefarious plot – there was no nefarious plot to foil." [...] She said the defendants were [...] "not political or religious martyrs," [...] but [...] "thugs for hire, pure and simple." ...|$|E
2500|$|Music for People in Trouble {{represents}} {{a departure from}} the synth-heavy, [...] "disco-infused prog" [...] Ten Love Songs (2015), with a stripped back focus on Sundfør's [...] "high, plangent" [...] voice and acoustic guitar and piano. Sundfør explained this by being [...] "tired of technology": [...] "I wanted to feel like I was a musician again. <b>But</b> <b>also,</b> <b>what</b> I wanted to say needed something organic to convey it." [...] She called the album a return to her roots, whereas Ten Love Songs was [...] "more of a detour." [...] Throughout the album, Sundfør's vocals are mostly accompanied only by piano or guitar, with occasional usage of samples and electronic textures which [...] "take the songs into experimental territory," [...] such as [...] "trickling water sounds, wiry bleeps and animal peeps," [...] inspired by Sundfør's travels from North Korea to the Amazon rainforest. Sundfør stated she wanted to [...] "try and mix up some innocent romantic sounds with something very industrial and dry sounds." [...] The album has been described as Sundfør's most personal, affecting and poignant record yet.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the term}} [...] "common sense" [...] had already become less {{commonly}} {{used as a}} term for the empathetic moral sentiments {{by the time of}} Adam Smith, debates continue about methodological individualism as something supposedly justified philosophically for methodological reasons (as argued for example by Milton Friedman and more recently by Gary S. Becker, both members of the so-called Chicago school of economics). As in the Enlightenment, this debate therefore continues to combine debates about not only what the individual motivations of people are, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>what</b> can be known about scientifically, and what should be usefully assumed for methodological reasons, even if the truth of the assumptions are strongly doubted. Economics and social science generally have been criticized as a refuge of Cartesian methodology. Hence, amongst critics of the methodological argument for assuming self-centeredness in economics are authors such as Deirdre McCloskey, who have taken their bearings from the above-mentioned philosophical debates involving Habermas, Gadamer, the anti-Cartesian Richard Rorty and others, arguing that trying to force economics to follow artificial methodological laws is bad, and it is better to recognize social science as driven by rhetoric.|$|E
