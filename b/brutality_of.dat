5|$|Blassingame {{asserts that}} slave parents {{attempted}} to shield infants {{and young children}} from the <b>brutality</b> <b>of</b> the plantation.

5|$|The <b>brutality</b> <b>of</b> the Spanish American {{dictatorship}} is omnipresent in The Kingdom of This World {{through the}} images of torture, fire, suppression, and hungry dogs for example. Carpentier's characters often find consolation in sexuality (which {{is closely related to}} the sadism of the violence theme) after experiencing violence.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} day, Lieutenant-General Renya Mutaguchi, {{commander of}} the Japanese 18th Division toured the hospital and distributed tinned fruits, all the while apologising profusely for the <b>brutality</b> <b>of</b> his soldiers and assured the staff of their safety. He also ordered {{the execution of the}} Japanese soldiers responsible for the massacre, within the hospital grounds.|$|E

5|$|Emmett Louis Till (July 25, 1941– August 28, 1955) was a 14-year-old African-American who was lynched in Mississippi in 1955, after a {{white woman}} said she was {{offended}} by him in her family's grocery store. The <b>brutality</b> <b>of</b> his murder {{and the fact that}} his killers were acquitted drew attention to the long history of violent persecution of African Americans in the United States. Till posthumously became an icon of the Civil Rights Movement.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: [...] Why?, from The Disasters of War (Los desastres de la guerra), by Francisco Goya, 1812-15. A {{collection}} of depictions <b>of</b> the <b>brutalities</b> <b>of</b> the Napoleonic-Peninsular War.|$|R

2500|$|The sufferings and <b>brutalities</b> <b>of</b> those 20 {{long months}} and days in prison, half-starved, iron-fettered, and {{sometimes}} trussed and suspended by his mangled feet with only {{head and shoulders}} touching the ground is described in detail by his wife, shortly after his release.|$|R
5|$|In The Disasters of War, Goya {{does not}} excuse any purpose to the random slaughter—the plates are devoid of the {{consolation}} of divine order or the dispensation of human justice. This {{in part a}} result of the absence of melodrama or consciously artful presentation that would distance the viewer from the <b>brutality</b> <b>of</b> the subjects, as found in Baroque martyrdom. In addition, Goya refuses to offer the stability of traditional narrative. Instead, his composition tends to highlight the most disturbing aspects of each work.|$|E
5|$|In their 2004 {{study of}} lynching, Peter Ehrenhaus and A. Susan Owen compare the lynching to a blood sacrifice, arguing Waco {{residents}} {{felt a sense}} of collective righteousness after Washington's death, as they saw him as the presence of evil in the community. Bernstein compares the public <b>brutality</b> <b>of</b> the lynch mob to the medieval English practice of hanging, drawing, and quartering people convicted of high treason.|$|E
5|$|After several months, Noriega was {{transferred}} to the province of Chiriquí, where Torrijos and Díaz Herrera were posted. That year's presidential election was contested by Arnulfo Arias, a native of that province. The sitting President, Rodolfo Chiari, ordered Torrijos to harass Arias's party members, to weaken his election bid. Torrijos passed this task on to Noriega, whose men arrested a number of people. Several prisoners said that they had been tortured; others stated they had been raped in prison. The <b>brutality</b> <b>of</b> Noriega's activities led to him being suspended for ten days, an item of information that was picked up by the U.S. intelligence services.|$|E
50|$|From 1983 to 1987, Buerk was the BBC's South Africa {{correspondent}} {{during the}} dying years of apartheid in South Africa.

5|$|Before {{the end of}} the year, Gaveston had {{returned}} to England, and civil war appeared imminent. In May 1312, Gaveston was taken captive by the Earl of Pembroke, but Warwick and Lancaster had him abducted and executed after a mock trial. This affront to Pembroke’s honour drove him irrevocably into the camp of the king, and thereby split the opposition. The <b>brutality</b> <b>of</b> the act initially drove Lancaster and his adherents away from the centre of power, but the Battle of Bannockburn, in June 1314, returned the initiative. Edward was humiliated by his disastrous defeat, while Lancaster and Warwick had not taken part in the campaign, claiming that it was carried out without the consent of the baronage, and as such in defiance of the Ordinances.|$|E
5|$|Hunting {{dolphins}} (at {{the time}} still often incorrectly {{referred to as}} fish or porpoises), primarily using harpoons and firearms, was considered a form of recreational hunting along {{the shores of the}} Gulf of Mexico in Texas in the late 19th and early 20th century. Pleasure dolphin hunting cruises could be booked in Corpus Christi in the 1920s, with a promise to tourists that if no successful dolphin kill was made, the excursion would be free of charge. The <b>brutality</b> <b>of</b> the practice started to spark animal welfare concerns and there is no reference of this practice still occurring in Texas after the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Jacobite defeat, on 13 February 1692, in an incident known as the Massacre of Glencoe, 38 members of the Clan MacDonald of Glencoe were killed by members of the Earl of Argyll's Regiment of Foot, who had accepted their hospitality, {{on the grounds that they}} had not been prompt in pledging allegiance to the new monarchs. Another forty women and children died of exposure after their homes were burned. The <b>brutality</b> <b>of</b> the incident was embarrassing for the new government and after a subsequent inquiry Dalrymple, who had ordered the massacre, was forced to resign. The massacre helped create greater sympathy for the Stuart cause and may have contributed to later support for Jacobite risings.|$|E

2500|$|De Soto had the best-equipped militia at the time. As the <b>brutalities</b> <b>of</b> the de Soto {{expedition}} {{through the}} Southeast became known, ancestors to the Choctaw rose in defense. The Battle of Mabila, an ambush arranged by Chief Tuskaloosa, {{was a turning}} point for the de Soto venture. The battle [...] "broke the back" [...] of the campaign, and they never fully recovered.|$|R
50|$|By {{the time}} Macmillan went on his famous 1960 African tour leading to his Wind of Change speech to Parliament in Cape Town change was well underway. By 1960, French African colonies had already become independent. Belgium more hastily vacated its colony and {{thousands}} of European refugees fled the Belgian Congo from the <b>brutalities</b> <b>of</b> {{the civil war and}} into Southern Rhodesia.|$|R
5|$|Similarly he is irreligious, {{his work}} making him {{aware of the}} {{fragility}} of life and consciousness's reliance on the functioning brain. His morality is nuanced, weighing both sides of an issue. When leaving the confrontation with Baxter, he questions his use of his medical knowledge, {{even though it was}} in self-defense, and with genuine Hippocratic feeling. While shopping for his fish supper, he cites scientific research that shows greater consciousness in fish, and wonders whether he should stop eating them. As a sign of his rationalism, he appreciates the <b>brutality</b> <b>of</b> Saddam Hussein's rule as described by the Iraqi professor whom Perowne treated, at the same time taking seriously his children's concerns about the war.|$|E
5|$|The Indian Princess is {{one example}} of an attempt by an artist of the early 19th Century to define an American {{national}} identity. Pocahontas, representing the spirit of America, literally shields Smith from injury and serves as foster mother, protecting colonists from famine and attack, achieving mythic status as a heroic mother, and preserving, nurturing and legitimizing America as a country. The play allows for an acknowledgement of the troubling aspects of the nation’s history of conquest, violence, and greed, by couching the negative implications in a romantic plot. In other words, the romantic conquest helps to soften the harshness and <b>brutality</b> <b>of</b> the colonial conquest. The success of the play reflects a larger cultural desire to express its sense of self through the Pocahontas myth.|$|E
5|$|The Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company {{was one of}} {{the largest}} users of prison laborers, mostly Blacks convicted of petty crimes, as a method for paying fines. This {{practice}} was common for obtaining coal mining labor in Alabama {{at the close of the}} Reconstruction era. The number of convicts employed increased after U.S. Steel acquired TCI in 1907, as did the <b>brutality</b> <b>of</b> the conditions in which they labored. In 1908, the first full year of U. S. Steel's ownership of TCI, almost 60 prison workers died from workplace-related accidents. That same year, the new owners of the company discovered a 400% annual turnover in the workforce.|$|E
50|$|Serious and {{extensive}} military injuries and first hand {{exposure to the}} <b>brutalities</b> <b>of</b> wars and hostile conflicts, Johnston {{made a conscious decision}} to represent the needs of those dispossessed and brutalized by armed conflict to oppose violence and to provide a method whereby the voices and truths of facts on the ground would be represented throughout the international media to counter official propaganda.|$|R

5000|$|He {{exercised}} his critical humanism {{about the}} moral and social disruption arising from Western style neoliberalism and the <b>brutalities</b> <b>of</b> capitalism.

5|$|Wesley trains under Fox's leadership, {{learning}} endurance, knife {{fighting and}} {{hand to hand}} combat.He also learns to control and use his abilities for firearm marksmanship, including curving bullets around targets. Frustrated by his lack of progress and the <b>brutality</b> <b>of</b> the training, Wesley insists he is ready, but Sloan disagrees. Wesley refocuses on his training and starts to excel. Sloan then shows him the Loom of Fate, which has served for 1,000 years in giving coded names of Fraternity targets through errors in the fabric. The Loom identifies those who will create evil and chaos in the future, with Sloan responsible for interpreting the code.|$|E
5|$|Anderson {{arrived at}} the guerrilla camp and {{described}} the day's events, the <b>brutality</b> <b>of</b> which unsettled Todd. By mid-afternoon, the 39th Missouri Volunteer Infantry had arrived in Centralia. From the town, they saw {{a group of about}} 120 guerrillas and pursued them. The guerrillas heard that the cavalry was approaching, and Anderson sent a party to set an ambush. They drew the Union troops {{to the top of a}} hill; a group of guerrillas led by Anderson had been stationed at the bottom and other guerrillas hid nearby. Anderson then led a charge up the hill. Although five guerrillas were killed by the first volley of Union fire, the Union soldiers were quickly overwhelmed by the well-armed guerrillas, and those who fled were pursued. One Union officer reached Centralia and gave word of the ambush, allowing a few Union soldiers who had remained there to escape. However, most were hunted down and killed; Anderson's men mutilated the bodies of the dead soldiers and tortured some survivors.|$|E
5|$|Nefarious {{asserts that}} there is a link between the {{international}} sex industry and legal prostitution in the Western world, and that those who create the demand for forced prostitution around the world are {{of a wide variety of}} ages and are often considered respectable. The film contrasts the secretiveness and <b>brutality</b> <b>of</b> the sex industry in Eastern Europe with the openness of public prostitution in the Netherlands. Nefarious suggests that sex trafficking in Southeast Asia is fuelled largely by the complicity of the victims' parents, with many in Cambodia grooming and then knowingly selling their daughters into prostitution to pay for luxury goods. The film asserts that 10% of the population of Moldova has been sexually trafficked. Nefarious contrasts Las Vegas prostitutes with victims of sex trafficking in Europe, depicting the former as drawn into the sex industry by dreams of a glamorous lifestyle, and the latter as made vulnerable by child abandonment and orphanages.|$|E
50|$|The film {{tells the}} story of Pascal Ichak, a French opera singer and chef living in Georgia, who opens a restaurant. It also shows the life in Georgia in the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, including its short period of independence (see Democratic Republic of Georgia). After the Bolshevik coup attempt of Georgia (1920), the chef refuses to emigrate and endures the <b>brutalities</b> <b>of</b> the new regime.|$|R
5000|$|He further {{acted on}} his {{opposition}} to the <b>brutalities</b> <b>of</b> Nazism by ordering deportation of Jews to countries which provided safe haven, and by writing reports emphasizing the psychological problems German soldiers developed after witnessing and participating in mass killings of Jews and Eastern Europeans. [...] Having access to this information reinforced Moltke's opposition to the war and the entire program of the Nazi party.|$|R
