40|$|This article {{outlines}} {{the results of}} tests on children which formed part of a study, including case histories and observations, on the education and care problems of children suffering from juvenileBattens disease. These tests appeared to show that these children follow a de inite pattern ofdeterioration but that the hard work required to prolong their active life {{for as long as}} possible is certainly worthwhile. Some years ago there appeared to exist some confusion in schools over which children were likely to manifest <b>Battens</b> <b>disease,</b> and what pattern the development of the disease would follow. Staff working with children suffering from the disease were curious to discover whether these children in fact followed a set pattern: if they all had memory problems, would it be possible to teach them a non-verbal method of communication, and could their active lives be prolonged? Medical Condition The first problem was one of nomenclature. The disease has various names including: juvenile amaurotic idiocy, Spielmeyer-Vogt-Stock disease and Batten-May ou disease. There have been several classifications of the different sub-groups of the disease, based mainly on the age of onset; that of Spalton, Taylor and Sanders (1980) is a good example. It is the juvenile form that is seen most in our schools for the visually handicapped and is now usually referred to as juvenile <b>Battens</b> <b>disease</b> (JBD). Pattern of Progress To discover if there was an overall pattern in the progress of deterioration in these children, it wasfirst necessary to compare the experiences of British teachers and care staff with those i...|$|R
40|$|Abstract only availableThe neuronal-ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs; often {{referred}} to as <b>Battens</b> <b>Disease)</b> are a group of hereditary disorders of childhood. Symptoms of NCLs are characterized by neurodegeneration with progressive neural cell death in the retina and central nervous system (CNS). The infantile form of NCL results from a deficiency in the protein, palmitoyl protein thioesterase- 1 (PPT- 1). PPT- 1, encoded by the Cln 1 gene, removes long chain fatty acids from modified cysteine residues in proteins. Mutations in the Cln 1 gene are associated with an accumulation of autofluorescent lysosomal lipopigments in various tissues such as the retina and CNS. In the current study, we use a transgenic mouse model in which the gene for Cln 1 has been mutated, i. e., 'knocked out'. Our goal is to perform histological experiments to assess the functional progression of neurodegenerative changes in the retina, brain and spinal cord as the subject ages. The retina, brain and spinal cord of the mice at different ages were fixed and embedded in plastic resin and/or paraffin. Thick sections (1 mm or 10 mm, respectively) were stained with toluidine blue or propidium iodide to detect neuronal loss and/or apoptosis {{as a result of the}} PPT- 1 deficiency. Fluorescent images of the stained sections were obtained to document changes in tissue structure and the extent of degeneration. These studies provide information that will aid future studies in which stem cell transplants will be made into the Cln 1 knockout mouse model. Ultimately, this approach will determine whether combined gene and stem cell therapies can be applied to patients with <b>Battens</b> <b>Disease.</b> Molecular Biology Progra...|$|R
40|$|Full list {{of author}} {{information}} {{is available at the}} end of the articleIntroduction Biometals including Zn and Cu are immensely important for brain function. When homeostatic control fails in aging or disease, biometal mislocalization or altered homeostasis can drive pathological changes as observed in patients suffering from neurodegenerative diseases [1], as the brain is especially vulnerable to metal-induced oxidative stress. Importantly, even subtle changes to biometal concentrations have been associated with significant neuronal pathology [2]. Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs), commonly known as <b>Batten</b> <b>diseases,</b> are a genetically heteroge-neous group of lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) [3], characterized by storage of lipofuscin material in lysosome-derived fluorescent storage bodies [4, 5] and neuronal demise leading to progressive loss of vision, motor dysfunction and premature death [6]. Oxidative stress and neuroinflammation phenotypes in NCLs are reminiscent of other forms of neurodegeneration. Al...|$|R

Neuronal ceroid-lipofuscinosis (NCL), also known as <b>Battens</b> <b>disease,</b> is really a group of inherited neurodegenerative diseases. A common feature of the ceroid lipofuscinoses is the deposition of autofluorescent cytoplasmic storage material in cells in the brain, retina, and many other tissues. The major symptoms are mental retardation, visual failure, lose of motor skills, seizures, and eventually premature death. In the European countries and the USA, the disease affects one in 12, 500 to 100, 000 people. Usually children appear to be healthy at birth and develop normally until the onset of the disease. Canine NCLs have been reported in a variety of breeds where they are important as veterinary diseases and as potential models for human NCLs. We have discovered that a missense mutation in the CLN 8 gene causes NCL in English Setters, a missense mutation in the CTSD gene causes American Bulldog NCL, and frame shift mutation in the CLN 2 gene causes Dachshund NCL...|$|R
40|$|There are {{increasing}} numbers of children living with life limiting illnesses in mainstream schools, thanks to better medical care. Life limiting illnesses in children can include (i) conditions for which curative treatment is feasible but can fail such as cancer and irreversible organ failure (ii) conditions requiring long periods of intensive treatment, but premature death is still possible such as cystic fibrosis (iii) progressive conditions without curative treatment such as <b>Battens</b> <b>disease</b> and (iv) conditions with severe neurological disability which might deteriorate unpredictably such as those with severe multiple disabilities following brain or spinal cord injuries (ACT/RCPCH, 2003). The aim of this literature-based study was to evaluate the current provision of educational support for teachers who are teaching children with life limiting illness in mainstream schools. An international literature search was carried out between February and July 2010 for academic journal articles across nine electronic data bases. It produced 23 papers published between 2005 and July 2010. The review aimed {{to answer the following}} questions: •	What are the needs of children who have life limiting illness, and their families, when the child is in school? •	What are the needs of teachers who are teaching children with life limiting illness? •	What educational support is currently available for teachers who are teaching children with life limiting illness? •	How well does the educational support meet the needs identified {{within the context of the}} literature reviewed? The analysis identified that the needs of children with life limiting illnesses are not being well met, and there appears to be little evidence of educational support for teachers. The paper concludes that schools need to work with both the medical and social models of health/disability in order to meet the needs of children with life-limiting illness. There is some consensus that the way forward needs to include multidisciplinary working within an ecological approach that supports home, schools and the health services working together. Only one paper reported an evaluation of such an intervention. There is a need for more research, evaluation and dissemination about the experience of living with a life-limiting illness in mainstream schools and related interventions, and for this to inform professional education and the co-ordination of education, health and home systems...|$|R
