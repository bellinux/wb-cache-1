5|$|Baalham {{arrived on}} October 3, {{following}} a fruitless three-day search for survivors. The text of Geib's brief {{letter to the}} American consul appeared in that day's edition of the St John's Newfoundlander, while its rival newspaper The Public Ledger printed a more detailed account of the disaster provided by Baalham. Because St John's lacked a telegraph service, these reports had to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> steamer Merlin to Halifax, Nova Scotia, {{where they could be}} wired to New York. Most of the Arctic party traveled on the same steamer; Geib remained in St John's, on the chance that further survivors might arrive. Merlin detoured to cover the area of the sinking, but discovered nothing; she then proceeded to Sydney, Nova Scotia and reached Halifax on October 11.|$|E
5|$|Dodd {{wanted the}} SEC {{to limit the}} amount of {{scholarships}} to about 32 per year, which would keep the other schools from offering 45 scholarships, picking the best, and withdrawing scholarships from the rest. A vote was to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> presidents of the colleges on the issue, and Dodd made it clear that Tech would leave the SEC unless the rule was changed. Bear had promised Dodd he would get his president to vote for Dodd's position, which would have changed the rule; when the meeting was held on January 24, 1964, the Alabama president voted against Dodd's position and the 140 Rule was upheld when the presidents split 6-6. Tech's president immediately walked to the podium and announced Tech was withdrawing from the SEC.|$|E

At the time of opening, the venue was estimated to incur an operating cost of NOK3 to 4 four million, and an operating deficit of NOK1.7 million.

The venue is owned through Gjøvik Olympiske Anlegg, originally owned 70% by Gjøvik Municipality and 30% by Lillehammer Olympiapark, but later taken entirely over by the municipality.|$|E
