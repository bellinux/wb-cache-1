50|$|The <b>blue-capped</b> <b>cordon-bleu</b> or blue-capped cordonbleu (Uraeginthus cyanocephalus) is {{native to}} Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, and Tanzania in East Africa. This small finch does fairly well in captivity given {{adequate}} conditions; however, breeding this finch {{is said to be}} quite difficult.|$|E
50|$|When {{he first}} {{described}} the red-cheeked cordon-bleu in his 1766 edition of Systema Naturae, Carl Linnaeus assigned {{it to the}} genus Fringilla. It was later moved to the genus Uraeginthus, {{along with the rest}} of the cordon-bleus and the grenadiers. The red-cheeked cordon-bleu, the <b>blue-capped</b> <b>cordon-bleu,</b> and the blue waxbillâ€”form a species group within the genus. Further, the red-cheeked cordon-bleu may form a superspecies with the blue waxbill, with which it shares similar habitats.|$|E
40|$|According to {{classical}} sexual selection theory, complex multimodal courtship displays have evolved in males through female choice. While it is well-known that socially monogamous songbird males sing to attract females, we report here {{the first example}} of a multimodal dance display {{that is not a}} uniquely male trait in these birds. In the <b>blue-capped</b> <b>cordon-bleu</b> (Uraeginthus cyanocephalus), a socially monogamous songbird, both sexes perform courtship displays that are characterised by singing and simultaneous visual displays. By recording these displays with a high-speed video camera, we discovered that in addition to bobbing, their visual courtship display includes quite rapid step-dancing, which is assumed to produce vibrations and/or presumably non-vocal sounds. Dance performances did not differ between sexes but varied among individuals. Both male and female cordon-bleus intensified their dance performances when their mate was on the same perch. The multimodal (acoustic, visual, tactile) and multicomponent (vocal and non-vocal sounds) courtship display observed was a combination of several motor behaviours (singing, bobbing, stepping). The fact that both sexes of this socially monogamous songbird perform such a complex courtship display is a novel finding and suggests that the evolution of multimodal courtship display as an intersexual communication should be considered...|$|E
