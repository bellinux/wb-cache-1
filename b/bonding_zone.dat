40|$|Steel-concrete {{composite}} bridges {{have become}} popular by {{taking advantage of}} desirable properties of both materials. In particular, prestressed concrete bridges with corrugated steel webs have {{emerged as one of the}} promising bridge forms. This structural form provides excellent structural efficiency with the concrete flanges primarily taking bending and the corrugated steel webs taking shear. Most beam theories proposed for this type of bridges have assumed that the longitudinal stiffness of the corrugated web is negligible. The web is assumed to carry effectively zero longitudinal normal stress. However, longitudinal normal stresses of the web have been observed in the <b>bonded</b> <b>zone</b> of the flange-web junctions during experiments. In this chapter, the stress distribution in the <b>bonded</b> <b>zone</b> of the flange-web junctions is investigated numerically. Parametric analysis is done to identify the essential parameters.

40|$|Most {{existing}} {{models for}} the problem of fibre/matrix stress-transfer through a partially debonded interface roughly solve the stress distribution in the debonded zone, neglecting {{the presence of the}} perfectly <b>bonded</b> <b>zone.</b> However the stress interactions between two zones is what makes the problem essentially different from the stress-transfer problem for a perfectly bonded interface. This paper suggests a variational approach based on the principle of minimum complementary energy not only in a perfectly <b>bonded</b> <b>zone</b> but also in a zone with a discontinuous interface. The debonded interface is treated as an external boundary on which a presumed interfacial shear stress is specified. A new analytical model, including stress non-uniformity in the radial direction and crack interaction, is derived to describe the stress state around fibre breaks and debonding tips in a single fibre embedded in an infinite matrix. For the presumed shear stress at the debonded interface the minimisation procedure renders the most accurate closed-form solution (under used assumptions) for both interactive zones. Finally, the 'best' shear stress distribution at the debonded interface is found by using Coulomb's friction law and simple numerical iterations. The stress profiles along both axial and radial directions are presented and compared with results from a numerical model(1) available in the literature and also from finite-element analysis. Good agreements are achieved. Extensive applications of this approach and the derived model are also discussed. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|R

The development of suitable test set-ups enabled the experimental investigations of the following bond reducing mechanisms: - development of osmotic pressure, -development of air pressure due to capillary suction of concrete, - development of air pressure due to temperature increase of the concrete, - pressure reducing processes in the <b>bonding</b> <b>zone.</b> Further, the local stresses at the vicinity of a local defect in the coating/concrete interface are calculated using the FE-method. In a third part of the thesis the bond strength between different polymer coatings and concrete is determined by means of the pull-off test and the so-called blister-test. The blister-test simulates very well the stress state caused by the bond reducing physical and chemical interactions mentioned above, and it allows to apply fracture mechanical concepts for the description of the bond strength. The experimental an numerical investigations showed that osmotic processes, capillary suction and temperature increase may result in 2 ressures of such magnitude that delamination of a polymer coating on a concrete substrate is likely to occur. This is particularly true if the coating / concrete interface has some local defects. To describe the resistance of the coating / contrete interface against bond reducing mechanisms in the frame of fracture mechanics the so-called 'adhesion fracture toughness K_c_a' is applied. The disregard of fracture mechanical phenomena leads to a wrong interpretation of the bond properties. Finally, on the basis of fracture mechanics a draft of a design concept for polymer coatings on concrete structures is presented. (orig.)

(i) The crystalline HA transforms into amorphous HA; (ii) the amorphous HA dissolves into the surrounding solution, resulting in over-saturation; and (iii) the nanocrystallites are precipitated from the over-saturated solution in the presence of collagen fibres. A preliminary analysis indicated several conclusions: (i) the transition from crystalline to amorphous HA might be the controlling step in the bone bonding of crystalline HA; (ii) biological interdigitation (or incorporation) of collagen fibres with HA and chemical bonding of a apatite layer were both necessary to strengthen and toughen a bone bond, not only for the bonding between bone and HA at 6 months, but also for the <b>bonding</b> <b>zone</b> at 3 months, which would otherwise be very fragile due to the inherited brittleness of polycrystalline ceramics; and (iii) perpendicular interdigitation is an effective way for collagen fibres to impart their unique combination of flexibility and strength to the interface which they are keying. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Because of its low {{density and}} high strength, {{magnesium}} (Mg) and its alloys are being sought after in {{the automotive industry}} for structural applications. Although many road-going cars today contain cast Mg parts, in the fabrication of chassis structural members the wrought alloys are required. One of the challenges of fabrication with wrought Mg is welding and joining the formed sheets. Because of the commonly observed difficulties in fusion welding of Mg such as hot cracking and severe Heat Affected Zone (HAZ), this work aimed to establish the feasibility of the solid-state process Magnetic Pulse Welding in producing lap welds of Mg sheet. Mg AZ 31 alloy sheets have been lap-welded with Magnetic Pulse Welding (MPW), an Impact Welding technique, using H-shaped symmetric coils connected to a Pulsar MPW- 25 capacitor bank. MPW uses the interaction between two opposing magnetic fields to create a high speed oblique collision between the metal surfaces. The oblique impact sweeps away the contaminated surface layers and forces intimate contact between clean materials to produce a solid-state weld. Various combinations of similar and dissimilar metals can be welded using MPW. Other advantages of MPW are high speed, high strength, {{and the possibility of}} being mounted on a robotic arm. The present research focuses on the feasibility and mechanical performance of an MPW weld of 0. 6 mm AZ 31 Mg alloy sheets made in a lap joint configuration. Tensile shear tests were carried out on the joints produced. Load bearing capacity showed linear increase with capacitor bank discharge energy up to a certain value above which a parabolic increase was seen. Strength was estimated to be at least as high as base metal strength by measuring the fracture surface area of selected samples. The fracture surface of samples welded at higher discharge energy showed two regions. In the beginning of the bond a platelet-featured fracture brittle in appearance and a ductile, micro-voiding fracture in the latter part. The joint cross section morphology consisted of a flattened area that had two symmetric <b>bond</b> <b>zones</b> 1 mm wide each separated by an unbonded centre zone ~ 3 mm wide. Reasons for the morphology were presented as a sequence of events based on the transient nature of the oblique collision angle. The interface microstructure was studied by optical and electron microscopy. Examination of the bonds has revealed sound and defect free interfaces. No microcracking, porosity, resolidification, or secondary phase formation was observed. Metallographic examination of the unbonded centre zone revealed anisotropic deformation and a lack of cleaning from the interface. This zone is formed as a result of normal impact in the initial stage of collision. The <b>bond</b> <b>zone</b> interface of the joint was characterized by a smooth interface consisting of refined grains. In samples welded at higher energy interfacial waves developed {{in the latter half of}} the <b>bond</b> <b>zone.</b> Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of the <b>bond</b> <b>zone</b> revealed a continuous interface having an 8 - 25 μm thick interlayer that coincided with the waves and had a dislocation cell structure and distinct boundaries with adjacent material. Equiaxed 300 nm dynamic recrystallized (DRX) grains were found adjacent to the interlayer as well as other slightly larger elongated grains. The interlayer is thought to be formed in plasticized state at elevated temperature through severe shear strain heating. The interlayer corresponds to a ductile fracture surface and, along with the interfacial waves, is responsible for the joint’s high strength...|$|R

40|$|In our {{previous}} study (Wu W, Verpoest I, Varna J. Compos Sci Technol 1998; 58 (12) : 1 863 - 77) of the stress-transfer problem around a single fibre, we presented a variational approach {{based on the}} principle of minimum complementary energy, not only in the perfectly <b>bonded</b> <b>zone</b> but also in the zone with a discontinuous interface of a two-phase composite. This approach is adapted in this paper to derive an accurate axisymmetric analytical model for the description of the stress state around the fibre breaks and partially debonded interfaces of a three-phase composite with a fibre, coating and matrix. The debonded fibre/coating interface is treated as a special external boundary on which a presumed interfacial shear stress with some free parameters is specified. Once the parameters are given, minimisation of complementary energy can be applied for both debonded- and bonded-interface zones together, to extract the most accurate closed-form solution. The shear stress at the debonded interface (the right values of free parameters) is finally found by substituting the calculated radial stresses in the Coulomb friction law and minimising the discrepancy by a simple numerical iteration. As the minimisation procedure is applied for the both debonded and <b>bonded</b> <b>zones</b> simultaneously, the strong interaction of the two zones is correctly described. This model also includes the matrix axial stress nonuniformity in the radial direction. The stress profiles along both axial and radial directions are presented and closely compared with the results from a finite element model and both agree quite well. A number of applications of this model are also discussed. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|R
