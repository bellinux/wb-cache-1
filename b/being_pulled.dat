5|$|The biplane that chased Hannay was a 1916 Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5a, his {{apartment}} {{was in an}} Art Deco building and 1950s rail carriages were <b>being</b> <b>pulled</b> by a steam engine built in 1927.|$|E
5|$|The {{remnants}} of the storm also brought unseasonable rainfall, although negligible, to parts of southern and central California on July11. The moisture reached the region after <b>being</b> <b>pulled</b> northward by an upper-level low {{off the coast of}} Oregon. While over open waters, the storm produced usually heavy rainfall, exceeding 2in/h (50mm/h) at times.|$|E

5|$|American Gangster was {{released}} to commercial success, despite <b>being</b> <b>pulled</b> from the iTunes Store at Jay-Z's request, {{at the time}} of its initial release. It debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart, selling 425,861 copies in its first week, while tying Elvis Presley for the second most American number-one albums. American Gangster received widespread critical acclaim and was viewed by critics as a return to form for Jay-Z after the 2006 album Kingdom Come.|$|E
5|$|Javier Arenas set {{the all-time}} SEC record with his seventh punt {{return for a}} {{touchdown}} and was named the SEC Special Teams Player of the Week. Mark Ingram led the offense with 102 {{yards and two touchdowns}} before <b>being</b> <b>pulled</b> early in the second quarter. Alabama outgained Chattanooga in total offense 422–84 and recorded their first defensive shutout since defeating Auburn 36–0 in 2008. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against the Mocs to 11–0.|$|E
5|$|On September 10, 2015, Miyamoto {{confirmed}} a fan theory {{stating that}} the entirety of Super Mario Bros. 3 takes place as a stage play. The game opens with curtains <b>being</b> <b>pulled,</b> featuring obstacles hanging from the catwalk, objects bolted to the background, and shadows on the skyline. When Mario finishes a level, he walks off the stage.|$|E

50|$|Dark Matter {{received}} negative {{reviews from}} critics, {{such as a}} review score of 4/10 from GameSpot. Reviewers and players alike criticized the game's abrupt ending, leading to refunds being offered by GOG and the game <b>being</b> temporarily <b>pulled</b> from Steam.|$|R
5|$|Young pitched six shutout {{innings in}} the second game of the season before <b>being</b> <b>pulled</b> with a right {{shoulder}} strain. He missed almost the entire season except for three starts {{near the end of the}} season, finishing the season 2–0 with a 0.90 ERA. In November, the Padres declined to pick up the option for 2011.|$|E
5|$|After a {{temporary}} closure between October 1951 and January 1952, British Railways (the {{successor to the}} LNER) ended passenger services between Finsbury Park and Alexandra Palace permanently on 3 July 1954. British Rail freight traffic continued {{to pass through the}} station until 1964. After freight traffic ceased, the line continued to be used for occasional London Underground rolling stock transfers between Highgate depot and the Northern City line, with the stock <b>being</b> <b>pulled</b> over the unelectrified lines by battery locomotives. This ceased in 1970 because of the poor condition of some of the intermediate bridges, and the track was lifted through the surface platforms in 1972.|$|E
5|$|Late in the Nineteenth Dynasty the Book of Caverns, which {{divided the}} underworld into massive caverns {{containing}} deities {{as well as}} the deceased waiting for the sun to pass through and restore them to life, was placed in the upper parts of tombs. A complete version appears in the tomb of Ramesses VI. The burial of Ramesses III saw the Book of the Earth, where the underworld is divided into four sections, climaxing in the sun disc <b>being</b> <b>pulled</b> from the earth by Naunet.|$|E
50|$|A claw hand {{can result}} of {{injuries}} to the inferior brachial plexus (C8 - T1). The condition {{may arise from}} the limb <b>being</b> suddenly <b>pulled</b> upward. For example, Klumpke paralysis can occur from excessive pulling of the infant's forelimb during parturition.|$|R
50|$|Five years later, in 1999, Laar {{returned}} to the post, with his main policy goals <b>being</b> to <b>pull</b> the economy out of a slump and lead the country toward the European Union. He remained in the post until he stepped down in 2002.|$|R
50|$|In the Champion Hurdle, Sizing Europe {{travelled}} {{well and}} seemed poised to {{challenge in the}} homestraight before weakening rapidly and <b>being</b> virtually <b>pulled</b> up by jockey Andrew McNamara. His trainer, Henry De Bromhead, later reported that the horse had injured his back.|$|R
5|$|On a clear, {{sunny day}} in July 1964, {{a group of}} six boys went {{swimming}} in the Roundout Creek at a park in Rosendale Village. After {{getting out of the}} creek, the boys were struck by lightning. One boy was knocked back into the creek, and regained consciousness as he was <b>being</b> <b>pulled</b> out. Two of the boys, Gary Schmitt and Ronald Morelli, died. Ronald Morelli was the son of Albert Morelli, who served as Rosendale's fire chief. Albert Morelli was part of the team that put out the fire at Reid's Village Inn.|$|E
5|$|Roope, who drowned when {{he could}} no longer hang on to a rope whilst <b>being</b> <b>pulled</b> {{up the side of the}} cruiser, was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross, thus {{becoming}} the first VC recipient of the Second World War. The award was justified, in part, by the recommendation of Heye, who wrote to the British authorities via the Red Cross, giving a statement of the valiant courage Roope had shown when engaging a much superior ship in close battle. Ramsay was also awarded the DSO. Both awards were made after the end of the war.|$|E
5|$|The 1975 Tour of the Americas {{kicked off}} in New York City {{with the band}} {{performing}} on a flatbed trailer <b>being</b> <b>pulled</b> down Broadway. The tour featured stage props including a giant phallus and a rope on which Jagger swung out over the audience. Jagger had booked live recording sessions at the El Mocambo club in Toronto to balance a long-overdue live album, 1977's Love You Live (UK 3; US 5), the first Stones live album since Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out!.|$|E
50|$|Prior to {{the release}} of Headstrong, the band toured through Canada from November to December 2001. Following its release, they {{performed}} with Tommy Lee before <b>being</b> curiously <b>pulled</b> from touring in July 2002. The following month they were dropped by RCA Records.|$|R

5|$|The Portland Basin is <b>being</b> <b>pulled</b> slowly apart between faults in the Tualatin Mountains (West Hills) on {{the west}} side of Portland, the East Bank fault along the east side of the Willamette River, and other fault systems near Gresham further east. About 3million years ago, many small volcanoes and cinder cones erupted through the thin, {{stretched}} crust of the basin and in the Cascade foothills to the southeast. Ash, cinders, and debris from these Boring Lava Field volcanoes added another layer of sediment to the Troutdale formation.|$|E
5|$|When {{the brigade}} left the 1st Airborne Task Force, the 1st Special Service Force {{replaced}} them. The task force advanced eastwards {{and reached the}} Franco-Italian border in the Menton area and the French Alps along part of what was the Maginot line. Here they halted in a defensive position for three months before <b>being</b> <b>pulled</b> out. The task force was now surplus to requirements and was disbanded on 23 November 1944. Its surviving manpower was used as reinforcements for the other American airborne formations.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Argentina from Europe, Evita never again appeared in public with the complicated hairdos of her movie star days. The brilliant gold color became more subdued in tone, {{and even the}} style changed, her hair <b>being</b> <b>pulled</b> back severely into a heavy braided chignon. Additionally, her extravagant clothing became more refined after the tour. No longer did she wear the elaborate hats and form-fitting dresses of Argentine designers. Soon she adopted simpler and more fashionable Paris couture and became particularly attached to the fashions of Christian Dior and the jewels of Cartier. In an attempt to cultivate a more serious political persona, Eva {{began to appear in}} public wearing conservative though stylish tailleurs (a business-like combination of skirts and jackets), which also were made by Dior and other Paris couture houses.|$|E
5000|$|The person's feet seem {{attached}} to the floor as if by a magnet. In magnetic gait, each step is initiated in a [...] "wresting" [...] motion carrying feet upward and forward. Magnetic gait can be visualized {{in terms of a}} powerful magnet <b>being</b> forcefully <b>pulled</b> from a steel plate.|$|R
60|$|Captain Ackinson was {{standing}} {{alone on the}} deck, watching the man-of-war's boat which was <b>being</b> rapidly <b>pulled</b> towards the Calipha. He was obviously in a bad temper. There was a black frown upon his forehead which did not altogether disappear when {{he turned his head}} and saw them approaching.|$|R
5000|$|Hinge screws — {{longer or}} {{specialized}} screws that prevent {{the door from}} <b>being</b> simply <b>pulled</b> out after removing the hinge pins. Often the hinge pin itself is screwed, from the inside while the door is open, into the hinge to prevent removal of the hinge pin without first opening the door.|$|R
5|$|After the war, the hoarded Flying Eagle cents re-entered circulation. Many {{remained}} there {{only a few}} years, <b>being</b> <b>pulled</b> out from among the new bronze cents in Treasury Department redemption programs in the 1860s and 1870s—thirteen million copper-nickel cents were retired by exchange for other base-metal coinage. By the 1880s, it was a rarity in circulation. The 2018 edition of R.S. Yeoman's A Guide Book of United States Coins lists the 1857, 1858 large letters, and 1858 small letters each at $30 in G-4 Good condition, the next to lowest collectable grade (AG-3). The 1856 is $6,500 in that grade, rising to $20,000 in uncirculated MS-63. The 1858/7 starts at $75 in G-4, rising to $11,000 in MS-63. An 1856 cent in MS-66 condition sold at auction in January 2004 for $172,500.|$|E
5|$|After {{they started}} to break apart, further orders were placed for {{additional}} suits and all the suits used eventually fell apart during the four days they were used on set. In order to film one scene, McChesney wore the suit open-backed due to the damage. No optical effects were used in creating Armus. For the scene where Riker is pulled into the oil, a stuntman {{was used as a}} stand in for Jonathan Frakes. Where Riker's face emerges from the oil, it was actually a plaster cast of Frakes' face painted black. It was placed on the same grate used to lift McChesney, and filmed lifting out of the liquid. The twitching effect in Yar's death was due to a wire tied around Crosby's waist <b>being</b> <b>pulled</b> on.|$|E
5|$|Barbara and Adam Maitland {{decide to}} spend their {{vacation}} decorating their idyllic Connecticut country home. As the two are driving home {{from a trip to}} town, Barbara swerves to avoid a dog and the car plunges into a river. After they return home, Adam decides to retrace their steps as they can't recall how they got home. Upon stepping outside he's taken to a desert world with monstrous sandworms before <b>being</b> <b>pulled</b> back in by Barbara. Even though he had been gone for less than a minute Barbara claims he had been gone for over an hour. She and Adam notice that they now lack reflections and they discover a Handbook for the Recently Deceased and realize they did not survive the crash.|$|E
50|$|The abrupt {{conclusion}} of the story, however, along with its brief explanation as to how Calder had determined the Headmaster's identity, seems somewhat contrived and {{in the nature of}} a deus ex machina <b>being</b> suddenly <b>pulled</b> from the author's hatful of tricks. Whether it is a satisfactory ending is up to the individual reader to judge.|$|R
