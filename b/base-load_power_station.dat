40|$|Atmospheric {{pollution}} on the South African high veld {{is perceived}} as a concern because of the combination of heavy industry and climatic features that prevail in the region. The frequent occurrence of surface inversions (80 - 90 % of days in the winter months), permits the accumulation of pollutants near ground level. Although industrial stacks, and those of power stations in particular, are generally able to emit gaseous and particulate pollutants above the boundary layer, looping and fumigation of plumes may occur under convective conditions. Under such circumstances, the concentration of pollutants at ground level may be high, especially within 4 km of the stack. Since considerable damage to European and North American ecosystems has occurred as a result of atmospheric pollution, concerns were first raised in a report by Tyson, Kruger and Louw in 1988, that similar effects may be taking place on the eastern highveld region of South Africa. The current study was prompted in direct response to these concerns. The first major objective was to establish long-term monitoring sites whereby changes in the pedosphere in response to atmospheric inputs could be detected. The second objective was to characterise the soil collection and to determine whether any impacts are detectable at this early stage. Arnot power station was selected as {{the focal point of the}} study as it is a <b>base-load</b> <b>power</b> <b>station,</b> is the most distant from the industrial centres of Witbank, Middelburg and Gauteng and has been in operation for over twenty years. Fifteen sampling sites located in an arc ranging ENE to SE downwind of the power station were selected. Both topsoil and subsoil were sampled at each site. Details of geographical co-ordinates and site features were noted to enable reproducible resampling. Sampling took place in August 1996, but three sites were visited again in October and resampled to test the reproducibility of sampling. Although not statistically comparable, the soils of each site showed similar results for key analyses, which included EC, pH, organic carbon and acid neutralising capacity...|$|E
40|$|Growing {{demands are}} causing {{increased}} {{pressure on the}} electricity infrastructure and perpetually escalated energy prices. Typically, there are daily and seasonal demand fluctuations oscillating between excessive-peak and equally excessive-low demands. Peak demands, at times, are causing congestions on the {{transmission and distribution network}} associated with compromised quality, risk of outages and high-priced energy supply. Expensive-to-run power plants are usually operated for short periods of time to meet peak demands what makes their operation even more expensive. Low-demands, usually supplied by <b>base-load</b> <b>power</b> <b>stations,</b> could be driving the electrical capacity and network to be operated well below a sustainable economic feasibility. Spreading out the demand profile on a moderated level would achieve an improved utilization of the electrical infrastructure. This research presents a demand-side response scheme to be implemented at end-user's premises contributing shifting loads to the right time of the day targeting spreading out the demand profile and allowing utilization of renewable energy sources. The technology uses programmable internet relays controlling appliance switches to operate loads automatically. The paper presents simulations of the economic model corresponding to the above described scheme representing an incentive-based demand response. In the simulation the impact of these programs on load shape and peak load magnitudes, financial benefit to users as well as reduction of energy consumption are shown. The results demonstrated more moderated load profile at lesser peak load magnitude and reduced energy cost...|$|R

40|$|ZeroGen Pty Ltd {{is proposing}} {{to build and}} operate a world-first {{demonstration}} plant, at commercial-scale, that integrates the gasification of coal with the capture and safe storage of carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions to generate low emission base-load electricity. The process of capturing and safely storing CO 2 is commonly referred to CCS. The demonstration project is called ZeroGen Clean Coal Power Demonstration (the Project). The objective of the Project is to demonstrate clean coal technologies that can address the challenge of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to the atmosphere from coal-fired base-load electricity generation. The rationale for undertaking the Project {{is to find a}} technological solution to the twin challenges of providing base-load electricity to meet growing industry and community demand while simultaneously reducing GHG emissions to the atmosphere. Australia has an abundance of coal resources (approximately 80, 000 million tonnes) conservatively valued at $ 100 billion. Coal is currently the lowest-cost energy source for <b>base-load</b> <b>power</b> in Australia and was responsible 78 % of the electricity generated in Australia in 2000 - 01. The demand for stationary energy services such as <b>base-load</b> <b>power</b> is projected to grow by 50 % by 2020. An issue with generating base-load electricity from traditional coal-fired <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> however, is the emission of CO 2. It is estimated that energy production and use contributed 68 % of Australia’s GHGs in 2002. Greenhouse gases are of concern because they tend to trap heat in the atmosphere potentially leading to an increase in the Earth’s overall temperature, which many observers believe is contributing to climate change.

Fusion has many potential advantages, including essentially limitless fuel, no carbon dioxide or other emissions, and intrinsic safety. Recent progress has been good and the outlook is promising. Several steps are needed before a prototype (demonstration) <b>power</b> <b>station</b> ('DEMO') can be brought into operation. These steps are: (1) build a power-station-size experimental device (an international tokamak experimental reactor (ITER)) and a materials test facility (i. e. an international fusion materials irradiation facility (IFMIF)), which will take 10 years; (2) run these facilities and incorporate the results into the design of DEMO [...] up to a further 10 years; and (3) build DEMO [...] up to another 10 years.

Microwave power transfer {{is essential for}} SSPS, and to be economically feasible, high efficiency is required. In space section, transmitting antenna size reduction is possible by utilizing optimized interrelated parameters of the system components. In this work, {{it has been found}} that microwave power transfer at 5.8 -GHz frequency has a size reduction advantage over 2.45  GHz in SSPS. However, this is valid up to the unit size of 1  GW only. Where more than 1 GW unit modules are employed there are feasibility restrictions established for the microwave transmission structure and the design of high power antenna phased array network is found to be impractical. High beam efficiency is utilized for reducing the transmitting antenna size. Thus, microwave power transmission at highest possible beam efficiency has been used. With the efforts of space agencies worldwide, lots of technical issues in SSPS implementation have been covered successfully, and it is found that SSPS has a potential of social acceptance. However, the space launch cost (around $ 15.000 /kg) is very high at present. It is expected that by the year 2040, it will be reduced by a factor of 1.000 ($ 150 /kg) and the SSPS will come in action.|$|R

40|$|Nuclear fusion can be {{considered}} as a <b>base-load</b> <b>power</b> plant technology: High investment costs and limited operational flexibility require continuous operation. Wind and solar, on the other hand, as the putative main pillars of a future renewable energy system, are intermittent power sources. The resulting variations that occur on many different time scales require at first sight a rather flexible back-up system to balance this stochastic behavior. Fusion would appear not to be well suited for this task. The situation changes, however, if a large-scale renewable energy system is envisaged based on a transnational, or even transcontinental power grid. The present paper discusses a possible European power system in the year 2050 and beyond. A high percentage share of renewable energies and a strong power grid spanning the whole of Europe and involving neighboring countries, in particular those in North Africa, are assumed. The linear programming model URBS is used to describe the power system. The model optimizes the overall system costs and simulates power plant operation with an hourly resolution for one whole year. The geographical resolution is at least at the country level. The renewable technologies are modeled first on a more local level and then summed together at the country or regional level. The results indicate that the smoothing effects of the large-scale power grid transform the intermittent renewable supply, which is then more compatible with <b>base-load</b> <b>power</b> plants such as fusion reactors...|$|R
