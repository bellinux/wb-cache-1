5|$|If {{the grand}} jury right attaches, every element of the charged crime must be {{submitted}} to {{the grand jury}}. Thus, the prosecution cannot augment the indictment without returning to a grand jury. <b>But,</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> may narrow the indictment without so returning.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of October, Slovakia and Netherlands were the last countries {{to vote on the}} EFSF expansion, which was the immediate issue behind the collateral discussion, with a mid-October vote. On 13 October 2011 Slovakia approved euro bailout expansion, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> has been forced to call new elections in exchange.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} these changes had little practical effect, possibly due to opposition by the planners and confusion or fear among cadres. From 1981–84 agricultural production grew substantially, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> {{did not use}} this opportunity to increase production of such crucial farm inputs as fertilizer, pesticide and fuel, nor of consumer goods. By the end of Lê Duẩn's rule, in 1985–1986, inflation had reached over 100% annually, complicating economic policy-making.|$|E
50|$|In 2009 it was {{estimated}} between 22,000 and 89,000 properties were affected, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>government's</b> scheme would cover around 3,500 at the most.|$|R
50|$|After {{consulting}} the Ulema, Egyptian authorities attempted {{to arrest him}} for spreading false doctrine. A military expedition was sent to reassert <b>the</b> <b>government's</b> authority on Aba Island, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>government's</b> forces were ambushed and nearly annihilated by the Mahdi's followers.|$|R
50|$|Sometimes {{financial}} crises {{brought on by}} a loss of confidence in <b>the</b> <b>government</b> arise not through the exchange rate channel, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>government's</b> external debt channel, in which <b>the</b> <b>government</b> cannot fulfill its duty in repaying the debt to foreign investors, causing the country huge losses.|$|R
5|$|Because {{of great}} losses during World War I, Charlton opposed {{military}} training and commitments of Australian forces. In 1924 Charlton {{was invited to}} a League of Nations (now United Nations) conference in Geneva, Switzerland. At the conference Charlton strongly opposed war, and the Geneva Protocol took form. Upon his return to Australia, Charlton advocated adoption of the protocol, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> sided with the British and refused to observe it.|$|E
5|$|In May 1970, {{the crews}} of two Cuban fishing boats were kidnapped by Florida-based {{dissident}} group Alpha 66, who demanded that Cuba release imprisoned militants. Under U.S. pressure, the hostages were released, and Castro welcomed them back as heroes. In April 1971, Castro was internationally condemned for ordering {{the arrest of}} dissident poet Heberto Padilla; Padilla was freed, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> established the National Cultural Council to ensure that intellectuals and artists supported the administration.|$|E
5|$|Labour again {{brought their}} bill {{before the new}} house on 31 October 2007 <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>Government</b> again voted the bill down. The Green Party, now in Government also voted in {{opposition}} to the bill, with spokesperson Ciarán Cuffe arguing that the bill was unconstitutional but without giving a reasoning. The Government committed itself to introducing its own bill for registered civil partnerships by 31 March 2008, a date it failed to meet.|$|E
5000|$|Dualism {{is visible}} in many English {{language}} government publications and documents, sometimes even within the same paragraph. For example, the spelling [...] "Macao" [...] appears on <b>the</b> local <b>government's</b> English language emblem as seen at its web portal, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> Macanese <b>Government</b> Tourist Office uses the [...] "Macau" [...] spelling, as is also reflected in its website. With effect from 1st January 2016, <b>the</b> Macau <b>Government</b> Tourist Office {{is now known as}} Macanese Government Tourism Office. Similarly, [...] "Macao" [...] is used on the Macau Special Administrative Region passport, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>government's</b> official explanatory note on the passport spells it as [...] "Macau".|$|R
50|$|In early 1966, {{fighting}} {{broke out}} in the countryside between peasants and <b>the</b> <b>government</b> over <b>the</b> price paid for rice. Sar's Khmer Rouge was caught by surprise by the uprisings and could not take any real advantage of them. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>government's</b> refusal to find a peaceful solution to the problem created rural unrest that played {{into the hands of the}} socialist movement.|$|R
2500|$|On 25 January 1910, [...] "with {{the gloom}} of his {{assassination}} hanging over everyone", the Viceroy Minto declared openly : [...] "A spirit hitherto unknown to India has come into existence (...), a spirit of anarchy and lawlessness which seeks to subvert not only British rule <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>Governments</b> of Indian chiefs..." ...|$|R
5|$|Males {{and females}} that are 18 {{years of age}} up to 23 {{years of age and}} have {{graduated}} high school are eligible for military service. Those that do so are obliged 4 years of service.

5|$|Starting in 1995, the ODA {{has used}} the Hinomaru motif in their {{official}} logo. The design itself was not created by the government (the logo was chosen from 5,000 designs submitted by the public) <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> was trying increase the visualization of the Hinomaru through their aid packages and development programs. According to the ODA, {{the use of the}} flag is {{the most effective way to}} symbolize aid provided by the Japanese people.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) {{operated}} 24 McDonnell Douglas F-4E PhantomII fighter-bomber {{aircraft in}} the ground attack role between 1970 and 1973. The Phantoms were leased from the United States Air Force (USAF) as an interim measure owing to delays {{in the delivery of}} the RAAF's 24 General Dynamics F-111C bombers. The F-4Es were considered successful in this role, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> did not agree to a proposal from the RAAF to retain the aircraft after the F-111s entered service in 1973.|$|E
50|$|In 2003, <b>the</b> Queensland State <b>Government</b> listed South East Queensland's koalas as 'vulnerable' {{under the}} Nature Conservation Act 1992 after the AKF's {{research}} made compelling findings. The AKF has appealed on multiple occasions to {{both state and}} federal <b>governments,</b> <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>governments</b> have failed to make any substantial changes to legislature affording the wild koala effective protection.|$|R
5000|$|In 2012, <b>the</b> {{national}} <b>government,</b> {{which owns}} <b>the</b> building, was considering to sell it, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> provincial <b>government,</b> <b>the</b> main user of the Hof, protested.|$|R

5|$|The {{relationship}} between the two nations was damaged by the November 2008 Mumbai attacks. He initially denied any links between the perpetrators and Pakistan, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> soon pursued military action against Lashkar-e-Taiba leaders in a 7 December raid. India cleared Zardari's government of any direct involvement in the attacks, but simultaneously demanded the extradition of 20 Pakistanis which it alleged had taken part in them. Zardari offered to send Inter-Services Intelligence Director-General Ahmed Shuja Pasha to assist in the investigation.|$|E
5|$|When the Chjeno-Piast coalition, which Piłsudski had {{strongly}} criticized, {{formed a}} new government, on 12–14 May 1926, Piłsudski returned {{to power in}} a coup d'état (the May Coup), supported by the Polish Socialist Party, Liberation, the Peasant Party, and even the Polish Communist Party. Piłsudski had hoped for a bloodless coup, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> had refused to back down; 215 soldiers and 164 civilians had been killed, and over 900 persons had been wounded.|$|E
5|$|After {{the car is}} {{disconnected}} {{from the rest of}} the train on a remote rail siding, Mulder questions the Red-Haired Man, who says that the patient is immune to biological warfare. Zama had tried to sneak the patient out of the country, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> would rather see it destroyed than let their research fall into Japanese hands; the Red-Haired Man was sent to kill them both. Mulder, however, believes that the patient is an alien-human hybrid. With help from Scully, Mulder successfully unlocks the door of the railcar, but he is knocked unconscious by the Red-Haired Man. As the Red-Haired Man is about to leave, X appears and shoots him. Realizing that the bomb is about to explode and that there is not enough time to both save Mulder and secure the patient, X decides to save Mulder. X exits carrying the still unconscious Mulder shortly before the bomb explodes.|$|E

5000|$|There {{was also}} a Mexican Communist Party that was allowed to operate during the Cold War. More likely to support causes in Cuba and the USSR, <b>the</b> Mexican <b>government</b> {{had to be careful}} with how they treated the party. Disbanding them could cause a {{backlash}} among Mexican citizens, but allowing it to grow could anger the United States. The Communist Party, therefore, was allowed [...] "to operate, <b>but</b> (<b>the</b> Mexican <b>government)</b> harassed, surveilled, jailed, and disappeared its leaders." [...] Groups like the Communist Party in Mexico demonstrated open support for countries like Cuba within Mexican borders <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>government's</b> treatment of <b>the</b> party was chosen especially to show loyalty to the United States.|$|R
5000|$|In July 1945, {{the force}} of CPC overthrew <b>the</b> puppet county <b>government,</b> <b>but</b> <b>the</b> Nationalist <b>Government</b> {{controlled}} <b>the</b> county in December.|$|R
5|$|Although {{the economy}} was already in a mild {{recession}} at this point, conditions worsened substantially after the devaluation of the Mexican peso during December 1994. The economy shrank by 4%, and a dozen banks collapsed. With the labour force continuing to expand and employment falling sharply along with aggregate demand, unemployment rose by over 6% in 6 months. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> responded effectively: it tightened bank regulation and capital requirements, and encouraged foreign banks to take over weaker local ones. The economy soon recovered and, between 1996 and 1998, both output and employment grew rapidly and unemployment declined substantially. However, {{at the beginning of}} 1999, the Brazilian currency underwent a strong depreciation. The Argentine economy contracted 4% in 1999, and unemployment increased again.|$|E
5|$|Following {{decommissioning}} in 1997, {{the ship}} was earmarked for preservation as a museum ship in Mumbai. Lack of funding prevented progress on the ship's conversion to a museum and it was speculated that the ship would {{be made into a}} training ship. In 2001, {{the ship was}} opened to the public by the Indian Navy, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>Government</b> of Maharashtra was unable to find a partner to operate the museum on a permanent, long-term basis and the museum was closed after it was deemed unsafe for the public in 2012.|$|E
5|$|Freedom from Want is {{the third}} {{in a series of}} four oil {{paintings}} entitled Four Freedoms by Norman Rockwell. They were inspired by , known as Four Freedoms, delivered to the 77th United States Congress on January 6, 1941. In the early 1940s, Roosevelt's Four Freedoms themes were still vague and abstract to many, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> used them to help boost patriotism. The Four Freedoms' theme was eventually incorporated into the Atlantic Charter, and it became part of the charter of the United Nations. The series of paintings ran in The Saturday Evening Post accompanied by essays from noted writers on four consecutive weeks: Freedom of Speech (February 20), Freedom of Worship (February 27), Freedom from Want (March 6), and Freedom from Fear (March 13). Eventually, the series was widely distributed in poster form and became instrumental in the U.S. Government War Bond Drive.|$|E
40|$|The current {{financial}} crisis poses little {{risk of a}} meltdown like the Great Crash in 1929. Left to itself, it certainly could. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>governments</b> are wide awake and a flood of interventions to kill the crisis is in evidence. The crisis therefore will pass. Will it however destroy “capitalism” and undermine “globalization”? I find such claims fanciful...|$|R

5|$|Human Rights Watch {{estimates}} UNITA and {{the government}} employed more than 6,000 and 3,000 child soldiers, respectively, some forcibly impressed, during the war. Additionally, human rights analysts found that between 5,000 and 8,000 underage girls were married to UNITA militants. Some girls were ordered to go and forage for food {{to provide for the}} troops – the girls were denied food if they did not bring back enough to satisfy their commander. After victories, UNITA commanders would be rewarded with women, who were often then sexually abused. The Angolan government and UN agencies identified 190 child soldiers in the Angolan army, and had relocated 70 of them by November 2002, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> continued to knowingly employ other underage soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Prohibition {{was gaining}} {{currency}} in Alberta: the Conservatives had included {{it in their}} 1913 platform, and it {{was supported by the}} increasingly powerful United Farmers of Alberta (UFA). The government generally opposed the idea, and Cross held up Manitoba as example of its failures. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> had also (at the UFA's behest) introduced direct democracy measures, one of which allowed citizens to initiate plebiscites. The well-organized temperance movement did so on prohibition, which was endorsed in the ensuing plebiscite; the legislature passed the Prohibition Act in the spring of 1916. As Attorney-General, Cross was responsible for enforcing it.|$|E
5|$|The Alberta and Great Waterways Railway was one {{of several}} {{companies}} that had been granted charters and assistance by the legislature to build new railways in the province. The government support that it received was more generous than that received by more established railways, such as the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway and the Canadian Northern Railway. Boyle, Cushing, and Bennett alleged favouritism or ineptitude by Rutherford and his government, and pointed to the sale of government-guaranteed bonds in support of the company as further evidence. Because of the high interest rate they paid, the bonds were sold at above par value, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> only received par for them, leaving the company to pocket the difference.|$|E
5000|$|A law {{establishing}} {{the right to}} collective bargaining had been passed by <b>the</b> Germán Busch <b>government,</b> <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>government's</b> perceived shift on labor issues remained untested until the 1942 miners' strike. [...] Bolivia had formally entered World War II {{on the side of}} the Allied Powers after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, and <b>the</b> Peñaranda <b>government</b> held that wartime strikes represented an unacceptable disruption of Bolivian production for the United States.|$|R
50|$|Tsiranana {{did nothing}} to defend Rabemananjara's honour, who {{exchanged}} the Economy portfolio for agriculture on 31 August 1965 and then took the foreign affairs portfolio in July 1967. Some austerity measures and spending cuts concerning cabinet ministers were introduced in September 1965: cancellation of various perks and allowances, including notably the use of administrative vehicles. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>government's</b> image had been tarnished.|$|R
