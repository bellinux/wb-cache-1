40|$|Possibilities of {{foundry sand}} core binders made with {{combination}} of Elaeis guineensis and Pinus sylvestris {{have been evaluated}} and the combine effect of these oils as binder were discussed. Core specimens made with Ota silica base sand bonded with 6 % of cassava starch in admixed proportion of E. guineensis and P. sylvestris were tested for tensile, compressive strength and permeability to establish the binding efficiency. Tensile strength of the green <b>baked</b> <b>core</b> were oven baked at 50, 100, 150 and 200 Â°C; cooled to room temperature and tested with universal strength machine. The cylindrically shaped permeability specimens were tested with permeability meter. The combine synergetic performance of the oil with Manihot esculenta crantz at 3 and 6 % respectively show an improved tensile strength of about 90 % above the P. sylvestris admixed. A compressive strength (CS) with baking temperatures up to 1150 KN/m 2 was achieved at 6 % starch with 2 % (palm and pine oil) and 3 % H 2 O and increased up to 1350 KN/m 2 at 6 % starch with 6 % (palm and pine oil) and 3 % H 2 O. Cores made with composites of 6 % starch, 6 % palm and pine oil and 3 % water and 6 % starch, 6 % palm oil and 3 % water will be suitable for intricate copper, aluminium, iron and steel casting...|$|E
