Indeed, from 1987, patients in France most affected by the virus receive AZT treatment {{in the hope that}} this molecule might block the reproduction of the virus. It was with the aim of monitoring the progressive decline of virus levels in the treated patient that the team at Garches works on their method. Leibowitch presents to world specialists assembled for the conference at Marnes la Coquette (Pasteur-les Cent Gardes symposium, November 1989) his results showing that the AZT monotherapy becomes quickly ineffective as demonstrated by returning viral levels in the treated patient, though in the first month such levels were significantly, yet only transiently, reduced. The measuring of HIV viral levels is later to become, in its commercial and industrial version, the universally used test to follow the development of the virus and the effectiveness of various treatments. Also, Jacques Leibowitch is the first in France to collect sequential cell specimens from individual patients at follow up, preserving living cell samples at extremely low temperatures since 1982. This live-frozen cell bank would later become a precious for retrospective scientific investigations.|$|E

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The method for investigating {{the effect of a}} gaseous medium on a <b>biological</b> <b>test</b> system (28) using an extracellular-metabolizing system, comprises examining the <b>biological</b> <b>test</b> system on a permeable support (30), guiding the gaseous medium over a surface of the <b>biological</b> <b>test</b> system for the formation of an exposure atmosphere above the <b>biological</b> <b>test</b> system, adding the extracellular-metabolizing system to a maintenance medium, positioning the maintenance medium with the extracellular-metabolizing system below the permeable support, adjusting the depression of the extracellular-metabolizing system admitted to the maintenance medium through the permeable support by giving a determined pressure affecting on the maintenance medium with the metabolizing system, and regulating the evaporation rate over the culture by giving a determined temperature in direct surrounding region of the <b>biological</b> <b>test</b> system and/or giving a determined flow rate of the gaseous medium flowing over the surface of the <b>biological</b> <b>test</b> system. The pressure effected on the maintenance medium is selected, so that the metabolizing system depresses through the permeable support and the <b>biological</b> <b>test</b> system does not inundate from the maintenance medium with the metabolizing system. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for an exposure device for investigating the effect of a gaseous medium on a <b>biological</b> <b>test</b> system using an extracellular-metabolizing system. USE - Method for investigating the effect of a gaseous medium on a <b>biological</b> <b>test</b> system using an extracellular-metabolizing system useful for exposing the <b>biological</b> <b>test</b> system in cigarette smoke or in automobile- or industrial exhaust gases, for investigating the environmental atmospheres, work-station atmospheres or inner-space atmospheres, for investigating the effect of a gaseous medium on a <b>biological</b> <b>test</b> system in the field of product security, consumer protection, pharmaceutical development, production supervision or medicine technology, for investigating the effect of a gaseous medium on a <b>biological</b> <b>test</b> system under the observance of {{organization for economic cooperation and}} development (OECD) guidelines, and for investigating toxicological effects, genotoxic effects, immunomodulatory or immunotoxic effects or others biological or toxicological relevant cellular changes (all claimed).

In this study, we have developed new methods to perform a PheWAS based on ICD- 10 codes and <b>biological</b> <b>test</b> results, and to use a quantitative trait as the selection criterion. We tested our approach on thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) activity in patients treated by thiopurine drugs. We developed 2 aggregation methods for the ICD- 10 codes: an ICD- 10 hierarchy and a mapping to existing ICD- 9 -CM based PheWAS codes. Eleven <b>biological</b> <b>test</b> results were also analyzed using discretization algorithms. We applied these methods in patients having a TPMT activity assessment from the clinical data warehouse of a French academic hospital between January 2000 and July 2013.

A total of 442 patient records were analyzed representing 10, 252 ICD- 10 codes and 72, 711 <b>biological</b> <b>test</b> results. The results from the ICD- 9 -CM based PheWAS codes and ICD- 10 hierarchy codes were concordant.

40|$|ABSTRACT Temperate climate {{fruit trees}} often exhibit uneven budding and flowering, {{due to the}} low number of {{chilling}} hours that determine the occurrence of dormancy and its depth. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the depth of bud dormancy in peach tree cultivars and evaluate the efficiency of the tetrazolium test for dormancy and comparing with <b>biological</b> <b>test.</b> Branches of the cultivars Aurora 1, Chimarrita, Chiripá, Coral, Eldorado, Granada, Leonense, Maciel, Marli, Premier, and Vanguard were collected between May and August 2008 at two locations: Curitiba and Lapa. The evaluation of dormancy was performed using a <b>biological</b> <b>test</b> of single node cuttings through the parameters: average time for bud burst, velocity of bud burst, final rate of bud burst and rate of vigorous bud burst. For the tetrazolium test, 300 mg of buds was used and the color intensity readings were obtained using a spectrophotometer. The peach tree cultivars evaluated differ in the intensity of dormancy in late fall. The most intense endodormancy cultivars found were: Chiripá, Leonense and Eldorado cultivars, and the weaker cultivars found were: Aurora 1 and Maciel. The tetrazolium test was efficient at estimating the intensity of dormancy in peach trees when the occurrence of cold was suitable for installation endodormancy. At a location with the lowest occurrence of cold (Curitiba), the tetrazolium test did not simulated successfully the <b>biological</b> <b>test</b> results...|$|E

Fifty-five strains did not agglutinate with the serum, and their biological characteristics were different from those of V. parahaemolyticus.

All clinically isolated V. parahaemolyticus strains also agglutinated with the above serum.
