5|$|Sea snakes {{appear to}} be active both day and night. In the morning, and {{sometimes}} late in the afternoon, they {{can be seen at}} the surface <b>basking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sunlight, and they dive when disturbed. They have been reported swimming at depths over , and can remain submerged for as long as a few hours, possibly depending on temperature and degree of activity.|$|E
5|$|This {{species may}} be active {{during the day}} and at night. However, on bright, sunny days, they are usually found coiled or {{stretched}} out somewhere in the shade. In the morning and on cool days, they can often be seen <b>basking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sunlight. They often emerge at sunset to warm themselves on warm ground (i.e., sidewalks, roads) and then become very active throughout the night, when they are usually found swimming or crawling. Contrary to popular belief, they are capable of biting while under water.|$|E
5|$|As {{a member}} of the tree frog family, the green and golden bell frog spends much time <b>basking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sun on vegetation, rocks, and reeds, usually near water, or hopping around between such places. Unlike most frog species, it is often active during the day. When handled, this species secretes a slimy acrid mucus, which {{consists}} of 17 aurein peptides. Thirteen of these show broad-spectrum antibiotic and anticancer activity. The secretion makes the frog slippery and hard to grip, and is poisonous to some other species of frogs, so it is a useful defensive tool for green and golden bell frogs. Males often fight one another if they come within 1 m of each other, frequently leading to injuries.|$|E

5|$|Grasshoppers are {{affected}} by diseases caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi and protozoa. The bacteria Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa have both been implicated in causing disease in grasshoppers, as has the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana. This widespread fungus {{has been used to}} control various pest insects around the world, but although it infects grasshoppers, the infection is not usually lethal because <b>basking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sun has the result of raising the insect's temperature above a threshold tolerated by the fungus. The fungal pathogen Entomophaga grylli is able to influence the behaviour of its grasshopper host, causing it to climb {{to the top of a}} plant and cling to the stem as it dies. This ensures wide dispersal of the fungal spores liberated from the corpse.|$|E
5|$|The flight muscles {{need to be}} kept at a {{suitable}} temperature for the dragonfly {{to be able to}} fly. Being cold-blooded, they can raise their temperature by <b>basking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sun. Early in the morning, they may choose to perch in a vertical position with the wings outstretched, while {{in the middle of the}} day, a horizontal stance may be chosen. Another method of warming up used by some larger dragonflies is wing-whirring, a rapid vibration of the wings that causes heat to be generated in the flight muscles. The green darner (Anax junius) is known for its long-distance migrations, and often resorts to wing-whirring before dawn to enable it to make an early start.|$|E
5|$|Rushes, tussock sedge, cattails, jewelweed, sphagnum, {{and various}} native true grasses {{are found in}} the bog turtle's habitat, as well as some shrubs and trees such as willows, red maples, and alders. It is {{important}} for their habitat to have an open canopy, because bog turtles spend a considerable amount of time <b>basking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sunlight. An open canopy allows sufficient sunlight to reach the ground so that the bog turtles can manage their metabolic processes through thermoregulation. The incubation of eggs also requires levels of sunlight and humidity that shaded areas typically lack. The ideal bog turtle habitat is early successional. Late successional habitats contain taller trees that block the necessary sunlight. Erosion and runoff of nutrients into the wetlands accelerate succession. Changes caused by humans have begun to eliminate bog turtles from areas where they would normally survive.|$|E

25|$|Caterpillars re-emerge {{in early}} spring. When it is warm, they feed a little, {{but most of}} the time is spent <b>basking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sun. There are six instars in total. The full-grown sixth instar {{caterpillar}} is 22–25mm long, and predominantly black; it has pale (yellow-orange) spines and (greyish-white) spots.|$|E
25|$|These {{are fast}} flying butterflies. Mainly found in open areas {{near the river}} in the mountainous jungle, they are also often seen on grass near roads or in the soil around the plant flowers sucking, honey, or they {{sitting on the ground}} <b>basking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sun.|$|E

This withdrawal, {{seen by many as}} a great victory of Islamic faith over an atheist superpower, was made possible by billions of dollars in aid to the Afghan mujahideen by those two countries. Khomeini issued the fatwa on 14 February 1989. The next day came the official announcement of the completion of the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, lost in the news cycle of the fatwa.|$|E

25|$|Generally very lethargic, a trait {{which helps}} it survive {{months at a}} time without food, the {{saltwater}} crocodile will usually loiter in the water or bask in the sun during much of the day, preferring to hunt at night. A study of seasonal saltwater crocodile behaviour in Australia indicated that they are more active and more likely to spend time in the water during the Australian summer; conversely, they are less active and spend relatively more time <b>basking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sun during the winter. Saltwater crocodiles, however, are among the most active of all crocodilians, spending more time cruising and active, especially in water. They are much less terrestrial than most species of crocodiles, spending less time on land except for basking. At times, they tend to spend weeks at sea in search of land and in some cases, barnacles have been observed growing on crocodile scales, indicative of the long periods they spend at sea.|$|E
500|$|William DeWitt Alexander {{advanced}} {{a negative}} view of Rosenberg in a late 19th-century history of Hawaii, characterizing {{him as an}} accomplice to {{what he saw as}} the king's [...] "efforts to revive heathenism". A 2008 article in Honolulu magazine also advanced an unfavorable characterization of Rosenberg: a writer for the publication described him as a [...] "smooth talker" [...] and compared him to the 19th-century industrialist Claus Spreckels, arguing that each was a [...] "huckster <b>basking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rays of Kalākaua's power". A more positive description was offered in the Canadian Jewish Chronicle in 1938 by Harry Rubenstein, who compared Rosenberg to the Baal Shem Jewish mystics of the 1700s.|$|E

50|$|As a whole, Ablepharus skinks are {{generally}} shy creatures. They tend to <b>bask</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sunlight during the daytime {{and become more}} active as dusk and darkness approach. They make their homes in rocky areas with leaf litter and little soil.|$|R
500|$|Day-to-day, the {{bog turtle}} moves very little, {{typically}} <b>basking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sun {{and waiting for}} prey. Though it is not especially lively on sunny days, the bog turtle is usually active after rainfall. Various studies have found different rates of daily movement in bog turtles, varying from [...] in males and [...] in females. Both sexes are capable of homing when released at distances up to [...] from their site of capture. The bog turtle will travel long distances {{to find a new}} habitat if its home becomes unsuitable. The species is most active during the spring, and males generally exhibit greater migration distance and seasonal activity than females as they defend their territory. Home-range migration distances have been recorded at [...] for males and [...] for females. Home-range sizes in Maryland vary from [...] to [...] with considerable amounts of variation between sites and years.|$|E
500|$|Erica Wexler from Spin {{described}} Madonna on {{the cover}} as [...] "like a cobra <b>basking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hot sun, Madonna {{on the cover}} of her new album stretches her profile lasciviously." [...] Author J. Randy Taraborrelli commented in , that the album cover indicated how True Blue was a vehicle of growth for Madonna. He felt that the [...] "washed out color photograph" [...] of her with head tilted back and eyes closed was [...] "understated", especially when compared to the sexier poses she had been associated in the past. The album's inner sleeve did not feature any photographs, and instead was dedicated to album credits and the song lyrics, since Madonna wanted to be represented by her songs on True Blue, not her image. Billboard listed the cover at rank 34 on their article about the [...] "50 Greatest Album Covers", describing it as a striking image of the singer.|$|E
500|$|As {{the video}} {{utilizes}} the remix featuring Cole, André 3000 {{did not appear}} in the clip; Cole, who replaced him, shot his cameo on October 7, 2011; Beyoncé also came to the set that day to film extra scenes with Cole. A 32-second preview of the music video was shown on BET's 106 & Park on October 24, 2011. The retro-themed visuals showed Beyoncé throwing a backyard bash with her friends. Sporting bikinis, girls, including rapper Dai Burger, were <b>basking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sun and splashing in the pool as Beyoncé's sister Solange was working the turntables. Cole swept through in his blue Bugatti to join the old school festivities. Although it was reported that the full music video would premiere on October 25, 2011, it premiered on October 26 during an episode of 106 & Park and on Beyoncé's Vevo account.

50|$|Five-lined skinks are ground-dwelling animals. They prefer moist, {{partially}} wooded habitat {{that provides}} ample cover or inside walls of buildings, trees {{as well as}} sites to <b>bask</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sun. They {{can also be found}} in broken, rocky areas at the northern edge of their habitat.|$|R
500|$|Crocodilians are ectotherms, {{producing}} {{relatively little}} heat internally and relying on external sources {{to raise their}} body temperatures. The sun's heat is the main means of warming for any crocodilian, while immersion in water may either raise its temperature by conduction, or cool the animal in hot weather. The main method for regulating its temperature is behavioural. For example, an alligator in temperate regions may start the day by <b>basking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sun on land. A bulky animal, it warms up slowly, but at some time {{later in the day}} it moves into the water, still exposing its dorsal surface to the sun. At night it remains submerged, and its temperature slowly falls. The basking period is extended in winter and reduced in summer. For crocodiles in the tropics, avoiding overheating is generally the main problem. They may bask briefly in the morning but then move into the shade, remaining there {{for the rest of the}} day, or submerge themselves in water to keep cool. Gaping with the mouth can provide cooling by evaporation from the mouth lining. By these means, the temperature range of crocodilians is usually maintained between , and mainly stays in the range [...]|$|E
