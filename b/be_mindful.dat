40|$|When we <b>are</b> <b>mindful,</b> we {{see what}} is before us. When we <b>are</b> not <b>mindful,</b> {{we see what}} is in our mind. —Scott Rogers What <b>is</b> <b>mindful</b> {{parenting}}? <b>Mindful</b> parenting <b>is</b> when parents or caregivers intentionally develop a nonjudgmental awareness of their own thoughts, emotions, and sensations in the present moment. They then extend this awareness to the relationship with their children {{in order to create}} desirable change that is in line with their parenting goals and priorities. There are five dimensions of mindful parenting that can help parents respond to their children more skillfully, that is, with more awareness and less reactivity (Duncan et al. 2009). Why practice mindful parenting...|$|R

25|$|The grape is a late budding and {{ripening}} {{variety that}} {{is prone to}} produce high yields if not kept in check by winter pruning or green harvesting. In addition to its susceptibility to numerous grapevine viruses, Agiorgitiko is also very sensitive to fungal infection from botrytis bunch rot, downy and powdery mildew. The vine also responds adversely to water stress which may require some irrigation in regions where the practice is permitted. In order to limit yields, Agiorgitiko is often densely planted in poor vineyard soils but growers need to <b>be</b> <b>mindful</b> of the variety's sensitivity to potassium deficiency.|$|E
25|$|The Maroondah/Yarra complex was a {{combination}} of several fires that had earlier been burning to the east of Healesville and Toolangi on 10 February, as part of the greater Kilmore East– Murrindindi complex south. By late that morning, the complex had burned out , with 184 personnel and 56 tankers responding to the fires. A CFA spokesperson said that while temperatures had cooled, strong winds were proving problematic, with towns in the area being threatened by embers blown from the fires. Around midday, the immediate threat to property in the areas around Healesville was downgraded, though a DSE spokesperson said that residents should <b>be</b> <b>mindful</b> of localised changes in the weather.|$|E
25|$|Leo and Chen {{also suggest}} that the two tests are similar in most respects, with only a narrow gap between them, and would produce the same result in most cases. They caution that judges, rather than {{concerning}} themselves with the labels given to the tests for bias, should be wary of taking extraneous matters into consideration, no matter which test is applied. The case of Locabail (UK) Ltd. v. Bayfield Properties Ltd. (1999) identified two particular issues for judges to <b>be</b> <b>mindful</b> of– special knowledge and legal sophistication. The authors concluded their analysis by suggesting that the true importance of the matter lies not in which test is used, but in ensuring that judges have taken into account all relevant circumstances and excluded extraneous considerations which {{would not have been}} applicable to the general public.|$|E

25|$|Prior to Agyarko's ministerial {{confirmation}} in February 2017, he {{was accused}} by Mahama Ayariga of the parliamentary appointment committee of bribing members of the minority to facilitate his approval as a Minister of energy. Ayariga reported on Radio Gold, that Agyarko through Muntaka Mubarak, the minority chief whip, had tried to influence {{the decision of the}} Appointments Committee of Parliament by giving each minority member a bribe. The Speaker of Parliament, Aaron Mike Oquaye set up an adhoc parliamentary committee to investigate the matter. After the investigation, the Joe Ghartey committee exonerated Agyarko but cited and found Ayariga guilty of being in contempt of parliament for making false allegations against a colleague and bringing the parliament into disrepute. Ayariga was made to render an apology on the floor of parliament and warned to <b>be</b> <b>mindful</b> of his actions in the future. After his ministerial appointment was approved, Ayariga publicly praised Agyarko for his track record asserting that his nomination was approved on merit.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{equipment}} {{rotation and}} maintenance concerns, Caltrain said in 2009 {{that it could}} not dedicate cars with higher bike capacity on trains with high bike demand. Many of you have written to ask a series of questions about this new effort: Why can’t we provide two bike cars on every train? Why can’t we provide two bike cars on my train? Why can’t we provide two bike cars on the most heavily used trains? Why is there only one bike car on trains that are supposed to have two bike cars? The simplest answer to most of these questions is that we don’t have enough bike cars to put two on every train, or even on every peak train, and, in doing all we can to expand service for our cycling customers, we have to <b>be</b> <b>mindful</b> of the impact of these changes on our entire system and all of our customers, particularly on on-time performance. All of our cars, not just our bike cars, serve our entire schedule throughout our entire day, which means they rotate through the schedule, and also must be rotated out of service for fueling, washing, maintenance and federally mandated safety and operational inspections. A train set that starts its day in San Jose may finish its day in Millbrae and be cycled to San Francisco for its daily maintenance and to begin the next day at the San Francisco station. Because of this rotation – because of the demands of our entire service schedule – we can’t guarantee that a specific stop on the schedule will have a specific train.}} Eventually, two bike cars were added to every train consist by 2011, and in 2016, a third bike car was added to Bombardier consists.|$|E

500|$|The {{production}} team had to <b>be</b> <b>mindful</b> of the series' budget when planning the effects and sets; Chibnall commented that [...] "it {{would be very}} easy to spend £300m on this but we don’t have it". As such, the dinosaurs could not dominate the episode, and Chibnall had to tell [...] "a big other story". The scene where Amy, Riddell, and Nefertiti stumble upon a sleeping Tyrannosaurus rex was almost cut as it was originally intended to feature computer-generated (CGI) raptors, which were too expensive. However, Millennium FX realised they could use a baby T-Rex {{that had been in}} an exhibit they designed. The episode contains a variety of [...] "favourite" [...] dinosaurs; some were built from scratch, while others were CGI. Smith had to wear padded trousers when riding the triceratops, and recalled it was [...] "a painful couple of hours, a laugh though and definitely worth it". Half of the triceratops was actually built and pushed by crewmen when Smith, Darvill, and Williams were riding it. The rest of it was filled in with CGI by The Mill. The Doctor Who logo in the title sequence featured the texture of a dinosaur's hide, in keeping with the varied [...] "blockbuster" [...] themes for each of the opening five episodes of the series.

However, Pam is unable to keep herself from crying out in horror when she sees her mother cast in the film as a scantily clad nurse, and Jim (John Krasinski) fails to fully suppress his laughter at [...] "The Scarn" [...] scene, so Michael angrily stops the movie and takes it away. Michael asks Holly Flax (Amy Ryan) what she thought and she does not seem impressed. Michael gets angry at her because he considers the film his [...] "dream", and he then offers {{the rest of the}} office the opportunity to finish seeing the film, which they happily accept.
