5|$|In {{response}} to a strengthening ridge to the south, Linfa began tracking eastward. Despite its proximity to land, the tropical storm's slow forward motion allowed for additional strengthening, {{and according to the}} JMA, Linfa reached an initial peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 90km/h (50mph) at 0000UTC on May27, just within the threshold of severe tropical storm status. Concurrently the cyclone made landfall near Dagupan, Luzon. Upon landfall, Linfa began to weaken as it crossed Luzon before emerging into the Pacific as a minimal tropical storm late that day. However, as a result of land interaction the initial surface circulation center of Linfa greatly weakened and was overtaken by a newly formed low-level circulation center on May28, resulting in the storm's position to shift well northeastward. This was the primary <b>basis</b> <b>on</b> <b>which</b> the JTWC downgraded Linfa to tropical depression status early on May28, though the JMA continued to analyze the system as a weak tropical storm. Afterwards, as the cyclone began to track northeastward, the new circulation center became more organized, resulting in the JTWC reclassifying Linfa as a tropical storm at 0600UTC the following day. Gradual strengthening followed, and at 1800UTC that day Linfa reached peak intensity with winds of 100km/h (65mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 980mbar (hPa; 28.94inHg) south of Okinawa. Subsequently the system began to take a more northward course and undergo extratropical transition, which was completed at 0000UTC on May30. Though by this time most tropical cyclone monitoring agencies ceased the monitoring of these extratropical remnants by this time, the JMA continued to track them as they made landfall near Uwajima, Ehime at 0800UTC the following day. Linfa's remnants then paralleled the western coast of Japan before dissipating on June4 well into the Sea of Okhotsk.|$|E

30|$|From the {{experiences}} gained whilst developing and conducting the first CIVISTI process, we conclude the following: CIVISTI is an efficient method for foresight, involving clear and well-balanced features of creativity, interaction and expertise. It {{results in an}} improvement {{in the quality of}} recommendations for decision-making and is consequently well suited to improve the decisions themselves, by broadening the <b>basis</b> of information <b>on</b> <b>which</b> they are made. Involving citizens and basing the recommendations on their work means that decisions that refer to these recommendations {{are likely to be more}} legitimate. This process and allowing citizens from different EU countries work together on issues that indirectly or directly concern themselves may potentially contribute to strengthening EU citizenship. In summary, the CIVISTI process therefore makes a successful contribution with regard to the EU’s reasons for promoting participatory exercises as identified by Boussaguet (2011): (a) broadening the <b>basis</b> of information <b>on</b> <b>which</b> decisions are made (in addition to political and scientific arguments), (b) increasing the legitimacy of decisions and (c) shaping a European citizen identity.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. We derive an {{efficient}} reduced basis method for finite volume approximations of parameterized linear advection-diffusion equations. An {{important step in}} deriving a reduced finite volume model with the reduced basis technology is the generation of a reduced <b>basis</b> space, <b>on</b> <b>which</b> the detailed numerical simulations are projected. We present a new strategy for this reduced basis generation. We apply an effective exploration of the parameter space by adaptive grids based on an a posteriori error estimate. The resulting method gives a considerable improvement concerning equal distribution of the model error over the parameter space compared to uniform parameter selections. It is computationally very efficient in terms of small ratio of training-time over model-error...|$|R
