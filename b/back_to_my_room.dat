2500|$|On July 11, 2017, the Detroit Police Department {{released}} the full report, photographs from Cornell's hotel room, and the 911 {{call from the}} MGM Grand Detroit from the night of Cornell's death. The call was made by an hotel employee at 12:56a.m., reporting [...] "a nonresponsive guest... inside of Room 1136". According to the report, Martin Kirsten, Cornell's bodyguard, was at the singer's hotel room at 11:30p.m. {{to help him with}} his computer, [...] "which was not working at that time." [...] It also says that Cornell's wife, Vicky, talked to her husband at 11:35p.m., and alarmed by what she heard, she phoned the bodyguard to ask him to check on her husband [...] "because he did not sound like he was OK." [...] A call from Cornell's wife at 12:15a.m. prompted his bodyguard to go to the singer's suite to check on him. Kirsten told police he was in his room watching TV when he {{received a phone call from}} Vicky. [...] "She sounded angry because he [...] wasn’t responding to his phone. She told me to go to the room and check on Chris. I came to the room and was unable to get (in) because of the interior latch. I went <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>room</b> and called for hotel security to come and open the door. They refused, saying that it wasn’t my room, although I told them that he was my employer and that I had a key." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{tell you}} what I'll do," [...] {{declared}} Randy. [...] "I'll run <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>room</b> and get my pocket flashlight. That will be just the thing." ...|$|E
60|$|I went <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>room</b> {{and rang}} up number 157. The voice which {{answered}} {{me was the}} voice of the woman who had denied me admission to the room.|$|E
60|$|I nodded, and did {{not pursue}} the subject. On <b>my</b> way <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms</b> {{half an hour later}} I stopped to speak for a few minutes with the hall-porter.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then that's all settled," [...] he declared. [...] "I {{am going}} <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms</b> now. I {{want you to}} come and dine with me there to-night, at eight o'clock." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{a ghostly}} house this of yours," [...] Forrest said grumblingly, as they {{closed the door}} behind them. [...] "I shall be thankful <b>to</b> get <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms</b> in town and walk down Piccadilly once more. What's that outside?" ...|$|R
60|$|When I got <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>room</b> I {{locked the}} door behind me, {{and went to sleep}} in the dark. I did not want light just then--could not bear it.|$|E
6000|$|I came <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>room</b> {{and threw}} myself on my knees. It is then so near the end? Tomorrow! Tomorrow! Lord, help me, and {{those to whom}} I am dear! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I--ah--don't {{want any}} substitute," [...] growled William Philander. [...] "I--ah--think you are--ah--very rude, all of you. I am going <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>room,</b> {{that is what}} I am going to do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are right, Louise!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "I shall go <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms</b> at once. Fortunately, I {{had a man}} {{shadowing}} Von Behrling, {{and there}} may be a report for me. If anything comes here, you will telephone at once?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pretty strenuous time," [...] Sir Charles remarked. [...] "Up at nine, {{played golf}} at Ranelagh all morning, lunched down there, <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms</b> and changed, called on my tailor, went round to the club, had one game of billiards and four rubbers of bridge." ...|$|R
60|$|Nor did I. For {{two hours}} and a half I tramped the streets, my spirits sinking more and more under the {{influence}} of failure and a blend of snow and sleet which had begun to fall; and then, tired out, I went <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms,</b> and climbed sorrowfully into bed.|$|R
60|$|I went <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>room</b> as Mariposilla {{began to}} dress. A {{few moments later}} I heard the outer door close gently, and knew that the Doña Maria and her child had gone.|$|E
60|$|And so <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>room</b> I went, my task accomplished, and {{so pleased}} was I with what had passed that as I drew on my boots--preparing {{to set out}} to Canaples--I laughed softly to myself.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am going}} <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>room</b> {{at the hotel}} for a moment, Stanley, to fetch something," [...] he confided. [...] "Order some more of the Napoleon brandy. I shall perhaps need it when I come back." ...|$|E
6000|$|Wearily I trudged <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>to</b> wait {{there until}} it was time to dress, for I had a dinner {{engagement}} at the Reform Club. On the table in the little hall lay a telegram, which I opened listlessly. It was from a well-known firm of solicitors in Dunchester, and ran:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By my old enemies, Watson. By {{the charming}} society whose leader {{lies in the}} Reichenbach Fall. You must {{remember}} that they knew, and only they knew, that I was still alive. Sooner or later they believed that I should come <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms.</b> They watched them continuously, and this morning they saw me arrive." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{took him}} {{straight}} <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms</b> {{after we left}} you," [...] Lutchester began. [...] "He was in an awful state of nerves and drugs and drink. Then I put him to bed as soon as I could, and rang up a pal of mine at the War Office to take him in hand." ...|$|R
60|$|The doors shut. The {{guests have}} {{returned}} to bed, the hotel servants to their duties. And I go <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>room.</b> But not to sleep. It is very late, but I do not sleep. I lie awake and think of 'er.|$|E
6000|$|She slept well. As for me, I passed such a wretched night, {{and got up}} so {{completely}} worn out, that I had to go <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>room</b> after breakfast, and lie down again. Lucilla persuaded me to do it. [...] "Herr Grosse won't be here till the afternoon," [...] she said. [...] "Rest till he comes." ...|$|E
60|$|On my way {{to answer}} it, I met Mr. Franklin {{coming out of his}} aunt's sitting-room. He {{mentioned}} that her ladyship was ready to see Sergeant Cuff--in my presence as before--and he added that he himself wanted to say two words to the Sergeant first. On our way <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>room,</b> he stopped, and looked at the railway time-table in the hall.|$|E
60|$|Much may {{be done by}} kindness. By {{the time}} the curtain fell on the musical comedy which we had {{attended}} all was peace between the Nugget and myself. Supper cemented our friendship, and we drove <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms</b> on excellent terms with one another. Half an hour later he was snoring in the spare room, while I smoked contentedly before {{the fire in the}} sitting-room.|$|R
60|$|I {{gave the}} man a tip and drove <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms,</b> where I spent a restless morning, then lunched at my club and {{returned}} to the Milan afterward, only in the hope that I might find there a note or a message. There was nothing, however. Just as I was starting to go out the telephone bell rang. I took up the receiver. It was Eve's voice.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Tavernake," [...] she said, [...] "the {{offer is}} still open. Get {{into the car}} with me and drive <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms</b> at the Milan Court, and I {{will give you a}} cheque for a hundred pounds at once. It will be very easily earned and you may just as well take it, for now I know where you are employed, I could have you {{followed}} day by day until I discover for myself what you are so foolishly concealing. Be reasonable, Mr. Tavernake." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{agreed on}} a night; and I stood on Fifth Avenue outside a solemn {{restaurant}} and watched 'em. A process-server walked in and handed Vaucross the papers at his table. Everybody looked at 'em; and he looked as proud as Cicero. I went <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>room</b> and lit a five-cent cigar, for I knew the $10,000 {{was as good as}} ours.|$|E
60|$|Then I went <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>room,</b> and {{was only}} {{just in time to}} catch Theodore calmly {{pocketing}} the hundred-franc note which my fair client had left on the table. I secured the note and I didn't give him a black eye, for it was no use putting him in a bad temper when there was so much to do.|$|E
60|$|If I {{was caught}} by the sentry I had my answer ready: I was going to meet my {{sweetheart}} {{at the end of}} the garden. It is an excuse which always meets with the sympathy of every true-hearted Frenchman. The sentry would, of course, order me <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>room,</b> but I doubt if he would ill-use me; the denunciation was against the landlord, not against me.|$|E
6000|$|... "You mean," [...] Graham protested, working himself {{gradually}} into a {{state of}} wrath, [...] "that I am <b>to</b> go <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms</b> as though nothing had happened, see Holderness and the others to-morrow, and not have a word of explanation to offer? That I am to leave those blackguards at Henry's to try their dirty games on some one else, and let Fischer, the man who was fully inclined <b>to</b> become <b>my</b> murderer, go away unharmed? I think not, Mr. Lutchester. I am much obliged for your help, but you are talking piffle." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "When President Kennedy {{was assassinated}} I was eating a B.C. Delicious apple {{at my desk}} in the {{newsroom}} of the Cornwall Standard-Freeholder. The single teletype machine suddenly began chattering, its bulletin bell ringing, and news editor Paul Cragg ran <b>back</b> <b>to</b> check and shouted: [...] "Oh my God -- Kennedy's been shot in Dallas!"I know exactly what I was wearing.I can see, hear, and feel it all as if it happened this morning.Those of us who went through it will never, ever forget where we were and {{what we were doing}} around 1 p.m. on Nov. 22, 1963.I phoned as many friends and family members as I could, and in the cold rain of that dark, late November afternoon, I walked <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooming</b> house, crying."- McRae remembering November 22, 1963 ...|$|R
60|$|Early on the {{following}} morning I moved <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms</b> in the Milan Court. Curiously enough I entered the building {{with a sense of}} depression for which I could not account. I went first <b>to</b> <b>my</b> own <b>rooms</b> and glanced at my letters. There was nothing there of importance. In other words, there was nothing from Felicia. I descended to the fifth floor and knocked at the door of her room. As I stood there waiting I was absolutely certain that somehow or other a change had occurred in the situation, that the freeness of my intercourse with Felicia was about to be interfered with. I was not in the least surprised when the door was at last cautiously opened, and a woman who was a perfect stranger to me stood on the threshold, with the handle of the door still in her hand.|$|R
60|$|It troubled {{me a good}} deal, and I {{wanted to}} know how the poor little fellow was so much that I would have gone to see if I had not been so far away. But it would be rather silly to hurry away twenty miles to look after one fly: so I {{finished}} my visit, and then went <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>room,</b> hoping to find Buzz alive and well in spite of the cold.|$|E
6000|$|... "My weekly {{letter from}} home failed to come," [...] he told her, [...] "and I was pretty blue. I knew I {{had to go}} before long and I was tired of waiting. I {{went out and bought}} {{morphine}} at every drug store where they would sell me a few tablets. I got thirty-six quarter grains, and was going <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>room</b> and take them, but I met a queer fellow on a bridge, who had a new idea." ...|$|E
60|$|But I {{could not}} sleep that night. I dreamt of actors--actors glaring, actors smiting their chests, actors flinging out a handful of {{extended}} fingers, actors smiling bitterly, laughing despairingly, falling hopelessly, dying idiotically. I got up at eleven with a slight headache, read my notice in the Fiery Cross, breakfasted, and went <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>room</b> to shave, (It's my habit to do so.) Then an odd thing happened. I could not find my razor. Suddenly {{it occurred to me}} that I had not unpacked it the day before.|$|E
60|$|Having {{got over}} my {{difficulties}} with the ladies, I found more difficulties {{waiting for me}} when I went <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> own <b>room.</b> In came Penelope--with the natural sweetness of women--to kiss and make it up again; and--with the natural curiosity of women--to ask another question. This time she only wanted me {{to tell her what}} was the matter with our second housemaid, Rosanna Spearman.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank God that I {{stayed here}} on the ground floor, instead of going <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> own <b>room</b> when Major Campbell left. It is a providence! The Lord has not forsaken me yet!" [...] said the sweet saint, as, {{catching}} up her shawl, she wrapped it round her, and slipping through the window, crouched {{under the shadow of}} the house, and looked for her mother.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, well, I {{was talking}} just then of how I felt in those days. I {{was a boy}} then, you know. I dare say I could go <b>back</b> now <b>to</b> <b>my</b> old <b>rooms</b> and live there without a thrill." ...|$|R
