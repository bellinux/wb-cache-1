50|$|Ivory was not {{a prestigious}} {{material}} in the rather strict hierarchy of Chinese art, where jade had always been far more highly regarded, and rhinoceros horn (which was not ivory) had a special auspicious meaning. But ivory, as well as bone, had been used for various items since early times when China still had its own species of elephant. Demand for ivory seems to have played a large part in their extinction, which came before 100 BC. During the Ming Dynasty, ivory began {{to be used for}} small statuettes of gods and others (see gallery). In the Qing Dynasty, it suited the growing taste for intricate carving and became more prominently used for <b>brush-holders,</b> boxes, handles and similar pieces. Later on, Canton even developed large models of houses and other large and showy pieces, which remained popular. Enormous examples are still seen as decorative centrepieces at government receptions. Figures were typically uncoloured, or just with certain features coloured in ink which was often just black, but sometimes a few other colors.|$|R
40|$|The work {{presents}} a single-chip integrated Rotor Coil Driver (RCD) {{that can be}} used in automotive alternators. It integrates the power switch with the control circuitry and the diagnostics; with respect to the state of the art new functionalities are integrated such as full reverse polarity protection and programmable output slope control against in-rush currents and current spike transients. The paper will discuss the driver IC design from the choice of the architecture to the real silicon implementation. The proposed innovative RCD has been implemented in a 0. 35 ìm HV-CMOS technology and has been embedded in a mechatronic <b>brush-holder</b> regulator system-onchip for an automotive alternator. The simulation results and experimental measurements prove the effectiveness of the proposed RCD facing the harshest automotive conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{design and}} {{characterization}} in high-voltage (HV) -CMOS technology of an innovative intelligent power switch (IPS) for harsh automotive applications is proposed in this paper. To safely handle the ordinary and extraordinary automotive electrical and environmental conditions, a systematic design flow is followed: several design solutions are {{presented at the}} architectural and circuital level, integrating on-chip self-diagnostic capabilities and full protection against the high voltage and reverse polarity, the effects of wiring parasitics, and the over-current and over-temperature phenomena. Moreover, the current slope and soft start integrated techniques ensure a low electromagnetic interference, and the IPS is also configurable to efficiently drive different interchangeable loads. The innovative IPS has been implemented in a 0. 35 -mu m HV-CMOS technology and has been embedded in mechatronic third generation <b>brush-holder</b> regulator system-on-chip for an automotive alternator. The electrical simulations and experimental characterization and the testing at component and on-board system levels prove that the proposed design allows a compact and smart power switch realization facing the harshest automotive conditions...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an innovative and effective approach {{to design and}} test a regulator for an automotive alternator with programmable functionalities. The prototype system consists of two different parts: an integrated circuit (IC) and a FPGA. The IC, implemented in austriamicrosystems HVCMOS 0. 35 μm technology, includes all the high voltage parts and a power switch with very low ON resistance. It is able to manage full reverse polarity on every pin, including the reverse battery condition, and over voltages up to 50 V. The programmability is guaranteed through the FPGA. This prototype system {{can be used to}} develop a new type of intelligent smart and flexible regulators which implement many additional programmable functions that give the car maker a better control and allow to reduce vehicle fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions. In the demonstrator all the implemented functions, including regulation, can be changed during the development phase and many properties, including loop stability, can be checked before releasing a final version of the regulator. The proposed system is also included in a standard <b>brush-holder</b> that can be mounted on Valeo Engine and Electrical System mechatronic alternator and verified directly in a real application...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} an {{overview}} of the research activity focused on development, design and testing of electronic devices and systems for harsh environments has been reported. The scope of the work has been the design and validation flow of Integrated Circuits operating in two harsh applications: Automotive and High Energy Physics experiments. In order to fulfill the severe operating electrical and environmental conditions of automotive applications, a systematic methodology has been followed in the design of an innovative Intelligent Power Switch: several design solutions have been developed at architectural and circuital level, integrating on-chip selfdiagnostic capabilities and full protection against high voltage and reverse polarity, effects of wiring parasitics, over-current and over-temperature phenomena. Moreover current slope and soft start integrated techniques has ensured low EMI, making the Intelligent Power Switch also configurable to drive different interchangeable loads efficiently. The innovative device proposed has been implemented in a 0. 35 μm HV-CMOS technology and embedded in mechatronic 3 rd generation <b>brush-holder</b> regulator System-on-Chip for an automotive alternator. Electrical simulations and experimental characterization and testing at componentlevel and on-board system-level has proven that the proposed design allows for a compact and smart power switch realization, facing the harshest automotive conditions. The smart driver has been able to supply up to 1. 5 A to various types of loads (e. g. : incadescent lamp bulbs, LED), in operating temperatures in the wide range - 40 °C to 150 °C, with robustness against high voltage up to 55 V and reverse polarity up to - 15 V. The second branch of research activity has been framed within the High Energy Physics area, leading {{to the development of a}} general purpose and flexible protocol for the data acquisition and the distribution of Timing, Trigger and Control signals and its implementation in radiation tolerant interfaces in CMOS 130 nm technology. The several features integrated in the protocol has made it suitable for different High Energy Physics experiments: flexibility w. r. t. bandwidth and latency requirements, robustness of critical information against radiation-induced errors, compatibility with different data types, flexibility w. r. t the architecture of the control and readout systems, are the key features of this novel protocol. Innovative radiation hardening techniques have been studied and implemented in the test-chip to ensure the proper functioning in operating environments with a high level of radiation, such as the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Geneva. An FPGA-based emulator has been developed and, in a first phase, employed for functional validation of the protocol. In a second step, the emulator has been modified as test-bed to assess the Transmitter and Receiver interfaces embedded on the test-chip. An extensive phase of tests has proven the functioning of the interfaces at the three speed options, 4 xF, 8 xF and 16 xF (F = reference clock frequency) in different configurations. Finally, irradiation tests has been performed at CERN X-rays irradiation facility, bearing out the proper behaviour of the interfaces up to 40 Mrad(SiO 2) ...|$|E
