500|$|The first {{recorded}} journey along {{what would become}} El Camino Sierra was by Jedediah Smith in 1826. The trail was in common use by prospectors passing through the area because of the California Gold Rush and Comstock Lode. While still mostly a dirt road, several people began promoting El Camino Sierra as a scenic route. In 1910, the Los Angeles Times announced that Governor Gillet had announced funding to construct a new road to connect El Camino Real with Yosemite National Park. When finished, a new [...] "wonderful circuit" [...] route would be complete and El Camino Sierra would become [...] "one {{of the most beautiful}} scenic routes in the world." [...] In 1912, the Southern Pacific Railroad published an article called [...] "Two Mules and a Motorist" [...] in which the author's trip down El Camino Sierra was detailed, promoting the trail as a scenic side trip, via pack mules, from its rail lines. In 1915, the California Teachers Association distributed a promotional book to the annual convention of the National Education Association. This book contained an article that sung the praises of this [...] "soon-to-be-world-famous highway" [...] called El Camino Sierra. While noting that it was still mostly an unimproved trail, the article assured the readers that county and state officials were working frantically to upgrade the route and, with the aid of convict labor, this would soon be a [...] "boulevard the entire distance from Los Angeles to Lake Tahoe." [...] The article concluded by stating El Camino Sierra was [...] "a highway with a hundred by-ways, each <b>by-way</b> with a hundred wonders". The article also implored the state legislature to extend El Camino Sierra to Truckee, Quincy and Susanville using a route similar to modern State Route 89, SR 70 returning to US 395.|$|E

He slipped down from the coach without troubling the driver to stop his horses; and hurrying across the road, and in and out of every <b>by-way</b> that lay near his course, at length approached his own dwelling. He used additional caution in his immediate neighbourhood; halting first to look all down the street before him; then gliding swiftly through that one, and stopping to survey the next, and so on.|$|E
60|$|They retraced their steps cautiously, {{until the}} negro {{turned into a}} lighter <b>by-way.</b> A strange mephitic odor {{seemed to come from}} sodden leaves and mosses that began to ooze under their feet.

The opening of the door set a clanking bell ringing. I left it open, and walked round a bare costume stand, into a corner behind a cheval glass. For {{a minute or so}} no one came.
