5|$|A small {{fraction}} of the contaminated spray was thrown back into the air as the base surge.

5|$|After John succeeded Richard in 1199, {{he decided}} to restore Geoffrey to the archiepiscopal estates, <b>but</b> <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> receive the income until the {{archbishop}} returned from Rome. Some of Geoffrey's opponents who were officials in his diocese resigned their offices, and {{for a short time}} peace reigned in York. But the perceived arrogance of Geoffrey's officials offended the cathedral chapter at York, and this further conflict was not resolved until March 1200. For most of the remainder of 1199 Geoffrey was frequently with the king, and the two appear to have been on good terms, a state of affairs that continued throughout the first half of 1200.|$|E

5|$|After he {{announced}} {{the building of}} the Pyramid, at age 69, Harvey began suffering a series of serious health problems, <b>but</b> <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> work tirelessly.

Three days later Harvey married his long-time personal secretary May Leake. In 1930, he came down with double pneumonia. He was also going blind and needed younger people to read his letters and the newspaper to him.|$|E
5|$|After humans {{migrated}} out {{of their}} ancestral environment of eastern Africa, they were exposed to new climates and challenges. Thus, Wade argues, human evolution did not end with behavioural modernity, <b>but</b> <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> be shaped by the different environments and lifestyles of each continent. While many adaptations happened in parallel across human populations, Wade believes that genetic isolation – either because of geography or hostile tribalism – also facilitated a degree of independent evolution, leading to genetic and cultural differentiation from the ancestral population and giving rise to different human races and languages.|$|E

5|$|At Stanford, Hammonds {{was named}} an All-American. The Orioles {{selected}} Hammonds with the fourth overall {{selection of the}} 1992 MLB Draft.
