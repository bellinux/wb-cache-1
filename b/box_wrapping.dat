This was not to protect an already injured hand/wrist, but to prevent themselves from injury in a fight. Soon after this trick became popular, both the WHA and NHL passed {{what became known as}} the [...] "Schultz Rule" [...] - [...] thus banning the boxing wraps' temporary involvement in professional ice hockey.|$|R

40|$|This study {{presents}} self-assembled {{quantum dots}} structures made on GaAs substrate. The samples were grown by Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) in the Stranski-Krastanow (SK) growth mode. Two types of quantum dots structures are performed under different growth conditions and are compared: the first type {{is composed of}} two structures with InAs quantum dots encapsulated with (Ga, In) (N, As) and the second one with <b>boxes</b> <b>wrapped</b> with InGaAs. The influence of encapsulation of quantum dots is highlighted and as already shown, the redshift of emission wavelength depends on nitrogen doping. Further investigations are done through the incorporation of indium and nitrogen in the quantum dots structures {{in order to understand}} their optimal doping level on electrical and optical properties. The effects of temperature, an important growth parameter, are examined through images of nanostructures obtained by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and Scanning Electronic Microscopy (SEM) techniques...|$|R
50|$|The {{novel is}} about a murder that occurs on a reality {{television}} programme called House Arrest, which {{is very similar to}} the program Big Brother, and the efforts of three police officers to identify the killer by watching all the video recordings of the ten housemates while the remaining housemates continue the reality television show. The novel jumps back and forth in time to show the events in the live video recordings, leading up to the night of the murder, where the remaining eight housemates at the time had to remain in an Indian sweat box- an old-style sauna with a pitch-black interior, the intention being to prompt the housemates to have sex-; the victim left the box to go to the toilet and the killer apparently left the <b>box</b> <b>wrapped</b> in a sheet to conceal his or her identity and stabbed the victim twice in the neck and head.|$|R
50|$|To {{illustrate}} his ideas, in the 1920s {{he built}} a series of houses and villas in and around Paris. They were all built according to a common system, based upon the use of reinforced concrete, and of reinforced concrete pylons in the interior which supported the structure, allowing glass curtain walls on the facade and open floor plans, independent of the structure. They were always white, and had no ornament or decoration on the outside or inside. The best-known of these houses was the Villa Savoye, built in 1928-1931 in the Paris suburb of Poissy. An elegant white <b>box</b> <b>wrapped</b> with a ribbon of glass windows around on the facade, with living space that opened upon an interior garden and countryside around, raised up by a row of white pylons {{in the center of}} a large lawn, it became an icon of modernist architecture.|$|R
5000|$|F.M. Howell and Company is a {{late nineteenth}} century {{manufacturing}} complex located {{on the banks of}} the Chemung River in Elmira, New York. F.M. Howell & Company was founded in 1883 in Elmira, New York by Fred M. Howell and John Aldrich. In its early years the company started out by producing wood and strawboard cigar and shoe boxes for other manufacturing companies. As this continued, they also added rigid paperboard boxes, and printing of <b>box</b> <b>wraps</b> and labels. Subsequently, this all led into the carton manufacturing, and plastic thermoforming for packaging. Later, on Howell got help from his cousin to help expand the companies horizons. [...] Of the five contributing buildings, four are located on the east side of Pennsylvania Avenue (Buildings 1, 2, 3 & 5), while only the Brand Building is located on the west side of the street. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.F.M. Howell and & Company was the oldest independent manufacturer for the 19th century.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the NP-complete {{colorful}} {{variant of the}} classical Matching problem, namely, the Rainbow Matching problem. Given an edge-colored graph G and a positive integer k, this problem asks whether there exists a matching of size at least k such that all the edges in the matching have distinct colors. We first develop a deterministic algorithm that solves Rainbow Matching on paths in time O*(((1 +sqrt{ 5 }) / 2) ^k) and polynomial space. This algorithm {{is based on a}} curious combination of the method of bounded search trees and a "divide-and-conquer-like" approach, where the branching process is guided by the maintenance of an auxiliary bipartite graph where one side captures "divided-and-conquered" pieces of the path. Our second result is a randomized algorithm that solves Rainbow Matching on general graphs in time O*(2 ^k) and polynomial space. Here, we show how a result by Björklund et al. [JCSS, 2017] can be invoked as a black <b>box,</b> <b>wrapped</b> by a probability-based analysis tailored to our problem. We also complement our two main results by designing kernels for Rainbow Matching on general and bounded-degree graphs...|$|R
