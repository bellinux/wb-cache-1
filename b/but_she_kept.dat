5|$|A second {{overhaul}} of AA defense was made between 1944 and 1945, as the Navy had found 20mm shells too light to stop Japanese kamikaze planes; this plus the higher approach speeds of these planes made these manually controlled guns obsolete. In their place, more quad 40mm Bofors mounts were fitted. Maryland eventually carried forty quad 40mm and eighteen 20mm guns. Colorados quad 40s were increased to forty <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>kept</b> all her 20mm guns. West Virginia carried forty quad 40mm and fifty 20mm. guns.|$|E

500|$|Lavigne's {{feature film}} debut was voicing an {{animated}} {{character in the}} 2006 film Over the Hedge, based on the comic strip of the same name. She voiced the character Heather, a Virginia opossum. Recording the characters' voices was devoid of interaction with other actors. Lavigne stated, [...] "All the actors went in individually, and [...] Tim and [...] and directors were there with me every time I went in, and they made it go so smoothly; they made me feel comfortable.... That was the interesting part, going in by yourself, with {{no one else to}} kind of feed off of." [...] Lavigne found the recording process to be [...] "easy" [...] and [...] "natural", <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>kept</b> hitting the microphone as she gestured while acting. [...] "I'd use my hands constantly and, like, hit the microphone stand and make noises, so Tim and Karey had to tell me to hold still.... It's hard to be running or falling down the stairs and have to make those sounds come out of your mouth but keep your body still." [...] Lavigne believed she was hired to perform Heather because of her rock-star status. [...] " [...] thought I'd give my character... a bit of attitude". The film opened on 19 May 2006, making $38million over its opening weekend. It went on to gross $336million worldwide.|$|E

2500|$|In London, Terry {{lived in}} Earls Court with her {{children}} and pets during the 1880s, first in Longridge Road, then Barkston Gardens in 1889, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>kept</b> country homes. In 1900, she bought her farmhouse in Small Hythe, Kent, where she lived {{for the rest of}} her life. In 1889, her son joined the Lyceum company as an actor, appearing with the company until 1897, when he retired from the stage to study drawing and produce woodblock engravings. [...] Her daughter Edith also played at the Lyceum for several years from 1887, but she eventually turned to stage direction and costume design, creating costumes for Terry, Lillie Langtry, and others early in the 20th century.|$|E

2500|$|From 1965, {{her songs}} {{started to be}} mimed by actresses other than the heroine. From 1965, songs for her in films started getting reduced but the songs she sang {{instantly}} became hits till 1968. She then declared a self-imposed retirement in 1965. <b>But</b> <b>she</b> <b>kept</b> having certain composers asking her to sing songs in few films and among them her songs from films like in Daku Mangal Singh, Upkar, Kismat (1969), Heer Ranjha (1970), Johar Mehmood in Hong Kong (1971), Teri Meri Ik Jindri (1975) and Main Papi Tum Bakhshanhaar (1976).

2500|$|During {{the last}} year of her life, her health, always delicate, became more frail, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>kept</b> up her {{interest}} in all the former work of her life, in spite of times of discouragement, for she realized that her strength was gradually becoming less. She presided at several Alliance meetings, although her friends well-knew that she was not able to bear the strain; but even in times of great weariness she would have days of enjoyment. Not many months before, on a visit to Concord, Massachusetts, which always brought happiness to her, she took part in the music one evening, and sang to the young people about her. One of the happiest recollections, to those nearest her, was of the last Christmas family gathering, in her own home, when she joined in the simple games and dances with her grandchildren. The two married daughters resided near their mother in Somerville, Massachusetts.|$|E
2500|$|In 1853 she wed a nobleman, Count Carlo Pepoli, of the Papal States, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>kept</b> {{her maiden}} name for the stage. In 1863 she had to retire {{the first time on}} account of her husband's serious mental illness. He died in 1867. A year later, in 1868, Alboni would take part in the funeral of her beloved master and friend, Rossini, in the Église de la Sainte-Trinité. There she sang, {{alongside}} Adelina Patti, the leading soprano of the time, a stanza of Dies irae, [...] "Liber scriptum", adjusted to the music of the duet [...] "Quis est Homo" [...] from Rossini's own Stabat Mater. Out of deference to her master, she also accepted to resume her singing career mainly in order to tour the orchestral version of the Petite messe solennelle around Europe. Rossini had once expressed his hope that she would take upon herself to perform it when he was dead. He had said that he had composed it, and especially the new section [...] "O salutaris", just having her voice in mind.|$|E

2500|$|In the mid-1870s {{she began}} {{an affair with}} the Mexican lawyer and {{entrepreneur}} Julián Montiel y Duarte, which caused a scandal in Mexico City. The city's social elite boycotted her performances and hired hecklers to harass her during performances. Her reputation recovered following her performance in Linda di Chamounix, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>kept</b> her vow never to sing in Mexico City again. In 1883, with her reputation (and economic situation) again in decline, she began a tour of northern Mexico with her troupe of Italian opera singers. The tour began in Guaymas and proceeded to La Paz, Baja California Sur. It was in La Paz that she sang {{for the last time}} on stage [...] the title role in Maria di Rohan [...] with the performance taking place in a theatre improvised from a disused sand pit. On 22 August, the troupe arrived in the port city of Mazatlán, where they were to perform Il trovatore and Aida. The city of Mazatlán prepared an elaborate welcome for her. Her boat docked at a pier decorated with garlands of flowers, and she was greeted by a band playing the Mexican National Anthem. When her carriage arrived, her admirers unhitched the horses and pulled it themselves to the Hotel Iturbide, where she once again saluted the crowds from her balcony. However, within a few days, she and 76 of the troupe's 80 members were to die in the yellow fever epidemic that swept the city shortly after their arrival.|$|E
