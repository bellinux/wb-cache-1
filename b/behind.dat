50|$|Geelong's twenty-three <b>behinds</b> {{included}} eleven rushed <b>behinds</b> by Hawthorn, some {{of which}} were deliberate, and {{some of which}} occurred directly from kick-ins.

This was one of the major contributing factors to a rule change the following year, prohibiting defenders from conceding rushed <b>behinds</b> unless under immediate pressure.|$|R
