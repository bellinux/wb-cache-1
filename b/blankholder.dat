50|$|A classic form of sheetforming is deep drawing, {{which is}} done by drawing a sheet {{by means of a}} punch tool {{pressing}} on the inner region of the sheet, whereas the side material held by a <b>blankholder</b> can be drawn toward the center. It has been observed that materials with outstanding deep drawability behave anisotropically (see: anisotropy). Plastic deformation in the surface is much more pronounced than in the thickness. The lankford coefficient (r) is a specific material property indicating the ratio between width deformation and thickness deformation in the uniaxial tensile test. Materials with very good deep drawability have an r value of 2 or below. The positive aspect of formability with respect to the forming limit curve (forming limit diagram) is seen in the deformation paths of the material that are concentrated in the extreme left of the diagram, where the forming limits become very large.|$|E
40|$|A <b>blankholder</b> {{is used to}} {{hold the}} edges of metal sheet while it is being formed by a matrix and a punch. An {{efficient}} way to design a stamping die is to integrate the <b>blankholder</b> plate into the die structure. This would eliminate the time and cost to manufacture <b>blankholder</b> plates. The integrated structure is called integrated <b>blankholder.</b> The main focus of this thesis is structural analysis and optimization of the integrated <b>blankholder.</b> The structural analysis of the integrated <b>blankholder</b> model (used {{for the production of}} doors of Volvo car model V 70) is performed using Hypermesh and Abaqus. The FE-results were compared with the analytical calculations of the fatigue limit. To increase the stiffness and reduce the stress levels in the integrated <b>blankholder,</b> topology and shape optimization is performed with Optistruct. Thereafter, a CAD model is set up in Catia {{based on the results of}} optimization. Finally, structural analysis of this CAD model is performed and the results are compared with the original results. The results show reduction in stress levels by 70 % and a more homogeneous stress distribution is obtained. The mass of the die is increased by 17 % and in overall, a stiffer die is obtained. Based on the simulations and results, discussion and conclusions are formulated...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDrawing of {{stampings}} {{technology is}} nowadays the most using technology for sheets processing. Because of stamping's weight reduction is these days actual sheet processing from aluminium alloys which by their properties differ {{a lot from}} commonly using deep-drawing sheets. To achieve maximal plastic deformation with material fracture is necessary to use sheet with required mechanical properties and properly chosen forming technological properties. Common tools for deep-drawing don’t enable to lively reply of necessity to change <b>blankholder</b> force during sheet drawing. On the experimental tool for deep-drawing with variable <b>blankholder</b> force are in the paper evaluated two variants of drawing methods for irregular shape of stamping.

40|$|Summary. The {{difficulties}} {{to achieve}} defect free parts in {{sheet metal stamping}} are highlighted by new materials such as dual phase steel or aluminium. Numerical simulations of the process can efficiently help to predict {{the behavior of the}} sheet by detecting defects like failure and wrinkling. A satisfactory part could be obtained by controlling the material flow during the forming phase: in some areas the sheet should be almost fixed, in others it should be let free. That control can be achieved through the <b>blankholder</b> pressure or the restraining forces of the drawbeads. Siegert, Häussermann and Haller [1, 2, 3] proposed the design of a deformable flexible <b>blankholder.</b> The aim of this work is to use numerical simulations to optimize different <b>blankholder</b> forces defined on different areas of the <b>blankholder</b> surface. The simulations are performed using Abaqus Explicit. The software is linked with an optimization algorithm based on a response surface method computed with diffuse approximations and coupled with an adaptative strategy to update the research space. The objective function is to minimize the work of the punch. Three inequality constraints functions are defined to avoid necking and wrinkling. This procedure is applied to the front door panel proposed as benchmark in the Numisheet' 99 conference. ...|$|E

40|$|Springback, an {{undesirable}} shape {{change in}} component which occurs during unloading of component from die, becomes hard to arrest as die geometry becomes increasingly complex. In the present study, the variation of springback with curved line of bend has been examined for two U-shaped parts using finite element numerical simulations. The two geometries {{which have been}} considered are: SRail Benchmark (Numisheet ' 96), and C-Tray (rectangular tray with circular edges). It was noticed for both the geometries that springback is relatively higher for free ends and straight sections of line of bend than the curved portions. Subsequently, to contain the springback, higher and variable restraining (<b>blankholder)</b> forces were applied at areas where springback was relatively more, using split blankholders. It was observed from simulations that though variable higher restraining forces reduced the overall springback in some cases, the pattern of variation of springback along curved line of bend remained extremely similar to that with uniform <b>blankholder</b> forces. This indicates that the curvature of line of bend has a pronounced effect than variable <b>blankholder</b> forces in determining springback.

The approximate plane strain conditions (daz = 0) operating in the flange can be simulated by an edge-notched tensile specimen and this simulation demonstrates the effect of texture hardening and softening upon flange wrinkling behaviour.

40|$|In {{sheet metal}} forming there is an {{increasing}} demand for deep drawing of light weight components with complex shapes. However, thinner and more ductile materials {{are more susceptible to}} tearing during the process. It is known that greater draw depths can be achieved without tearing if the <b>blankholder</b> is subjected to a pulsating force. The present paper describes experimental investigations in which cylindrical-shaped cups are drawn with a pulsed <b>blankholder</b> force (PBHF) at ultra-low (< 1 Hz) and low (1 - 10 Hz) frequencies. The tests were performed with blanks of steel (DC 04) and of aluminium (5754 -H 111) over a range of draw ratios. The tests showed that tearing occurred within a well-defined part of the punch stroke. Of the two parameters, amplitude and frequency of the pulsed force, the latter had a more pronounced effect. For draw ratios resulting in a narrow working range of the static <b>blankholder</b> force, the process can be made more robust if the PBHF is applied at ultra-low frequencies. In addition to this, the PBHF must be synchronised in such a way that, during the identified critical tearing part of the stroke, the instantaneous PBHF is kept below the static tearing limit by synchronising the punch force and PBHF. Feasible values of the frequency depend on the length of the critical tearing part of the stroke and the upper and lower BHF limits of the process...|$|E

40|$|The {{difference}} between steel and aluminium in {{sheet metal forming}} operations, {{and the influence of}} roughness in these operations, have been studied by making deep draw and friction experiments. The friction tests have been carried out with flat contacts to simulate the conditions in the <b>blankholder.</b> In deep drawing the influence of roughness cannot be neglected. The punch force is affected by the roughness, and related properties such as the dimensions of the product after deep drawing and the fracture limit, are affected as well. The relative amount of this influence depends on the amount of lubricant, the type of product and the type of sheet metal, and can also vary with the state of the process. In rectangular products however the effects were less clear than in cylindrical products. For aluminium the influences of process conditions in deep drawing are stronger than for steel, caused by strong asperity flattening. When using a high speed and much lubricant at aluminium, the friction in the <b>blankholder</b> became so low that the <b>blankholder</b> force could be increased up to the limit of the press without causing fracture. Friction tests showed that for steel the friction as expressed in a Stribeck curve, barely depends on the pressure, while for aluminium the influence of pressure is strong. Both the position of the region of mixed lubrication, and the 'classic' friction coefficient at conditions of boundary lubrication are influenced by pressure. The influence of pres-sure could be linked to the phenomena encountered in the deep drawing tests success-fully. The mechanisms responsible for the generation of pressure in the lubricant at mixed lubrication have been examined. Based on these findings a model for mixed lubrication has been developed which can describe many of the observed effects including the consequence of asperity flattening...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{the case}} of sheet metal forming process {{one of the most}} {{important}} phenomena that affect the dimensional and shape accuracy of the formed parts is the part springback after the tools removing. The springback phenomenon depends, on the one hand by the material mechanical parameters (especially Young‘s modulus, anisotropy coefficient, yield stress) and on the other hand by the process parameters and tools geometry. Therefore in order to control the springback for a given material, the influence of the process parameters or tools geometry must be know. The aim of the present paper is to investigate the effect of <b>blankholder</b> force (as process parameter) on the springback parameters in {{the case of}} rectangular parts made from steel sheets. The investigations were made both experimentally and by finite element simulation. The springback parameters of the obtained parts were determined by using the ATOS system and ATOS software that allows the virtual reconstruction of the part shape in order to measure the springback parameters.

The friction tests have been selected to simulate the conditions in the <b>blankholder,</b> because there is the main source of friction in deep draw operations (besides drawbeads). Deep draw experiments showed that the influence of roughness is not negligible. The punch force is affected by the roughness, and related properties such as the dimensions of the product after deep drawing and the fracture limit, are affected as well. The punch force increased with increasing roughness, but the relative amount of this influence de-pends on the amount of lubricant, the type of product and the type of sheet metal, and can also vary with the state of the process (punch travel). For cylindrical products, the shape of the force-displacement curve differed from the classical dome-shaped curve found in textbooks.

Draw beads are used to control the flow of sheet metal while forming large panels. They prevent wrinkling in formed panels and reduce the <b>blankholder</b> force. Draw bead restraining forces are usually evaluated by means of draw bead modelling device. In this thesis a draw bead modelling apparatus is used to assess the influence of variation in material, bead geometry, drawing velocity, friction conditions, sheet metal rolling direction, roughness of tool (influenced by wear) and <b>blankholder</b> force on the draw bead restraining force and drawing force.

40|$|Deep {{drawing is}} one of the most widely-used forming {{processes}} to manufacture automotive bodyparts from sheetmetal. In order to simulate deepdrawing processes,a finite element(FE) method was used to predict formability. The accuracy of the FEsimulation depends on the material models,numerical techniques, and contact algorithms. Despite the fact that the contact conditions between the tool and sheet material influences the coefficient of friction in forming processes, the coefficient of friction is often treated as a constant Coulomb friction coefficient in FE simulations. However, a friction model based on local contact conditions and surface topography is required to improve forming predictability. There is growing interest in developing contact models to predict the nature of friction conditions for use in FE calculations. In deepdrawing processes, the sliding contact predominantly occurs in the <b>blankholder</b> region between the tool and sheet material. The contact pressure in the <b>blankholder</b> is non-uniform due to bending and material compression which vary depending on tool geometry. The sheet metal surface is subjected to repeated contact during sliding, which in turn affects the local friction conditions. The objective of this paper is to develop a sliding friction model for mixed modes of surface deformation. The deterministic approach used in the current model includes the roughness of both the sheet material and the tool. The sheet material is subject to an asperity flattening process. Further, the tool surface indents into the sheet material under normal loading.
