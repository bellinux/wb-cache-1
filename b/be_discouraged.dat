5|$|The {{passenger}} carriages {{used on the}} London Necropolis Railway were not owned by the LNC, but loaned from the LSWR. A set of carriages was permanently loaned, rather than carriages being lent as needed, as the LSWR was concerned that passengers might <b>be</b> <b>discouraged</b> from using regular LSWR services if they knew that their carriages had potentially carried dead bodies recently.|$|E
5|$|Black currawongs {{are very}} common around picnic areas in Tasmania's {{two most popular}} National Parks, Freycinet and Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair, and are often fed by {{tourists}} there. The National Parks Authority tolerated this practice until 1995, when they found the birds were becoming a nuisance and began discouraging people from feeding wildlife. However, the agile currawongs are adept at snatching fragments of food left by picnickers so the birds may only ultimately <b>be</b> <b>discouraged</b> by an (impractical) ban on food in National Parks. Birds also take other items such as soap or cutlery from campsites to examine.|$|E

5|$|As {{this was}} the first race of the season, Buemi led the Drivers' Championship with 25 points, seven ahead of nearest rival di Grassi in second, who in turn, was a further three in front of the third-placed Heidfeld. Prost was fourth on 12 points, and Félix da Costa rounded out the top five with ten points. e.Dams-Renault's first and fourth-place {{finishes}} meant they became the leaders of the Teams' Championship with 37 points; Audi Sport ABT and Andretti were tied for second with 18 points each. Mahindra stood in fourth on 16 points, nine ahead of NextEV in fifth place with eleven races left in the season. Despite negative press reviews over the Hong Kong ePrix, Agag reaffirmed his commitment to holding a race in the city and stated that he would not <b>be</b> <b>discouraged</b> by any incurred financial losses from the event.|$|E
5|$|The {{brain is}} {{composed}} {{of a network of}} neurons that transmit signals by propagating nerve impulses. The propagation of this impulse from one neuron to another is typically controlled by neurotransmitters, though there are also electrical pathways between some neurons. Neurotransmitters can inhibit impulse firing (primarily done by γ-aminobutyric acid, or GABA) or they can excite the neuron into firing (primarily done by glutamate). A neuron that releases inhibitory neurotransmitters from its terminals is called an inhibitory neuron, while one that releases excitatory neurotransmitters is an excitatory neuron. When the normal balance between inhibition and excitation is significantly disrupted in {{all or part of the}} brain, a seizure can occur. The GABA system is an important target for anticonvulsant drugs, since seizures may <b>be</b> <b>discouraged</b> by increasing GABA synthesis, decreasing its breakdown, or enhancing its effect on neurons.|$|E
25|$|Child marriage, {{which was}} once a {{globally}} accepted phenomenon, has come to <b>be</b> <b>discouraged</b> in most countries, but it persists to some extent {{in most parts of}} the Muslim world.

25|$|American Muslims - in {{line with}} general public attitudes in the United States - have become much more {{accepting}} of homosexuality over recent years. In a 2007 poll conducted by Pew Research Center, only 27% of American Muslims believed that homosexuality should be accepted. In a 2011 poll, that rose to 39%. In a July 2017 poll, Muslims who say homosexuality should be accepted by society clearly outnumber those who say it should <b>be</b> <b>discouraged</b> (52% versus 33%).|$|E

25|$|Cannabis use has {{increased}} dramatically {{over the past few}} decades whereas the rate of psychosis has not increased. Together, these findings suggest that cannabis use may hasten the onset of psychosis in those who may already be predisposed to psychosis. High-potency cannabis use indeed seems to accelerate the onset of psychosis in predisposed patients. A 2012 study concluded that cannabis plays an important role in the development of psychosis in vulnerable individuals, and that cannabis use in early adolescence should <b>be</b> <b>discouraged.</b>|$|E
25|$|Among the {{majority}} Islamic legal opinions that {{agree that the}} niqab is never obligatory, there is nonetheless dispute among Islamic schools of thought and scholars whether or not wearing niqab to cover the face at any time (not just during Hajj and Umrah) is 'urf (a cultural practice) which should merely <b>be</b> <b>discouraged,</b> {{or if it is}} in fact bid'ah say'iah (an innovation which opposes the Qur’an and Sunnah, and is therefore against Islam) in which case it should be prohibited.|$|E

25|$|Further {{legislation}} would follow, entrenching and deepening {{the institution of}} slavery. In 1671 the Assembly passed an Act stating expressly that baptism of a slave would not lead to freedom. Prior to this some slaves had sued for freedom based on having been baptized. The Act was apparently intended to save {{the souls of the}} enslaved; such that no slaveholder should <b>be</b> <b>discouraged</b> from baptizing his human property for fear of losing it. In practice, such laws permitted both Christianity and slavery to develop hand in hand.|$|E
25|$|In August, 2015, San Francisco Supervisor John Avalos {{announced}} plans to introduce an ordinance that would set a “San Francisco Right-of-Way Policy” that would make citations for bicyclists who safely yield at stop signs the lowest law enforcement priority. Running a stop sign would still be illegal, but the police would <b>be</b> <b>discouraged</b> from enforcing it, making this a proxy for a stop-as-yield law. The bill was passed in an initial vote by the Board of Supervisors on December 16, 2015. However, on January 20, 2016, the Mayor vetoed the bill.|$|E
25|$|If, therefore, it {{is claimed}} that your race {{is doomed to}} {{economic}} inferiority, you may confidently look {{to the home of}} your ancestors and say, that you have set out to recover for the colored people the strength that was their own before they set foot on the shores of this continent.

25|$|Previously, experts {{recommended}} sending as many {{as three}} stool samples to rule out disease if initial tests are negative, however, evidence suggests repeated testing during the same episode of diarrhea is of limited value and should <b>be</b> <b>discouraged.</b> C. difficile toxin should clear from the stool of previously infected patients if treatment is effective. Many hospitals only test for the prevalent toxin A. Strains that express only the B toxin are now present in many hospitals, however, so testing for both toxins should occur. Not testing for both may contribute to a delay in obtaining laboratory results, which is often the cause of prolonged illness and poor outcomes.|$|E
25|$|Reciprocity {{tends to}} <b>be</b> <b>discouraged</b> in {{contemporary}} organ gifting, thus creating an irresoluble sense of debt in the receiver. This {{separation of the}} donor from the object being given was not always implemented, and in earlier cases of organ transplantation the receiver could obtain information from the donor and even meet. As Holtkamp (2002) has argued, this arrangement created a feeling of debt in the receiver (and close kin) {{and led to the}} creation of obligations. The discouragement of reciprocal relationships between giver and receiver is produced through what Sharp (2001) has labeled etiquettes of dehumanization where the identities of the donors are removed from the organs.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the trials}} of former Soviet leaders were widely publicized, the {{hundreds}} of thousands of other arrests and executions were not. These became known in the West only as a few former gulag inmates reached the West with their stories. Not only did foreign correspondents from the West fail to report on the purges, but in many Western nations (especially France), attempts were made to silence or discredit these witnesses; according to Robert Conquest, Jean-Paul Sartre took the position that evidence of the camps should be ignored so the French proletariat would not <b>be</b> <b>discouraged.</b> A series of legal actions ensued at which definitive evidence was presented that established the validity of the former labor camp inmates' testimony.|$|E
