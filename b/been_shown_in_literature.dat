Neural network-based clustering has <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>literature</b> to yield good results, yet {{the possibility of}} transforming the input feature space {{in order to enhance}} the clustering process has gone largely unexplored. In this paper we focus on brain imaging and present a new algorithm for unsupervised segmentation of multi-spectral images, based on the research, through neuro-fuzzy techniques, of an optimized space in which to perform clustering. Tests performed on both real and simulated MR images show promising results, encouraging the application to different medical targets and further investigation. 1...|$|E

At the same time it may be desirable to shrink the set of states which may have discontinuous extension, in other words, to decrease the jump space. Sufficient conditions in this direction are obtained in terms of feedback matrices...|$|E

In E-speed start, a binary start was implemented based on a calculated value β which depends on the available bandwidth and other network conditions. A model for E-speed start was derived using utility maximization theory and the principle of decentralised solution.

The Rottinger approach is an anterior approach which utilizes the muscle interval between the tensor fascia lata and abductor musculature.

We analyze Wand and Weber’s good decomposition model as an approach for creating decomposed process models that are easy to understand.
