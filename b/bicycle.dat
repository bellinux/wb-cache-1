5|$|A {{monument}} to the <b>bicycle</b> kick executed by Ramón Unzaga was erected in Talcahuano, Chile, in 2014; created by sculptor María Angélica Echavarri, the statue is composed of copper and bronze and measures three meters in diameter. A statue in honor of Manuel Negrete's <b>bicycle</b> kick is planned for the Coyoacán district of Mexico City. The Uruguayan novelist Eduardo Galeano wrote about the <b>bicycle</b> kick in his book Soccer in Sun and Shadow, praising Unzaga as the inventor. The Peruvian Nobel laureate writer Mario Vargas Llosa has the protagonist in The Time of the Heros Spanish edition declare that the <b>bicycle</b> kick must have been invented in Callao, Peru.|$|E
5|$|As in the {{previous}} years, there were two classes of cyclists, the coureurs de vitesse and the coureurs sur machines poinçonnées. Of the 93 cyclists starting the race, 82 were in the poinçonnée category, which meant {{that they had to}} finish the race on the same <b>bicycle</b> as they left, and if it was broken they had to fix it without assistance. The coureurs de vitesse could get help from the car with <b>bicycle</b> repairmen when they had to fix a <b>bicycle,</b> and when a <b>bicycle</b> was beyond repair, they could change it to a new one.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} types of modern single speed bicycles; BMX <b>bicycles,</b> some <b>bicycles</b> {{designed}} for (younger) children, cruiser type <b>bicycles,</b> classic commuter <b>bicycles,</b> unicycles, <b>bicycles</b> designed for track racing, fixed-gear road <b>bicycles,</b> and fixed-gear mountain <b>bicycles.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>Bicycles</b> can be {{categorized}} in many different ways: by function, by number of riders, by general construction, by gearing or by means of propulsion. The more common types include utility <b>bicycles,</b> mountain <b>bicycles,</b> racing <b>bicycles,</b> touring <b>bicycles,</b> hybrid <b>bicycles,</b> cruiser <b>bicycles,</b> and BMX bikes. Less common are tandems, low riders, tall bikes, fixed gear, folding models, amphibious <b>bicycles,</b> cargo bikes, recumbents and electric <b>bicycles.</b>|$|R

5|$|<b>Bicycle</b> kicks are {{generally}} done in two situations, one defensive {{and the other}} offensive. A defensive <b>bicycle</b> kick is done when a player facing his side's goal uses the action to clear {{the ball in the}} direction opposite his side's goalmouth. Sports historian Richard Witzig considers defensive <b>bicycle</b> kicks a desperate move requiring less aim than its offensive variety. An offensive <b>bicycle</b> kick is used when a player has his back to the opposing goal and is near the goalmouth. According to Witzig, the offensive <b>bicycle</b> kick requires concentration and a good understanding of the ball's location. <b>Bicycle</b> kicks can also be done in the midfield, but this is not recommended because safer and more accurate passes can be done in this zone.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bicycle</b> – Used for response, {{but usually}} in pedestrian-only areas where large {{vehicles}} find access difficult. Like the motorcycle ambulance, a <b>bicycle</b> may {{be connected to}} a trailer for patient transport, most often in the developing world. See also cycle responder.|$|E
5|$|Crosses that precede an {{offensive}} <b>bicycle</b> kick are of dubious accuracy—German striker Klaus Fischer reportedly stated that most crosses {{prior to a}} <b>bicycle</b> kick are bad. Moreover, performing a <b>bicycle</b> kick is dangerous, even when done correctly, as it may harm a startled participant in the field. For this reason, Peruvian defender César González recommends that the player executing the <b>bicycle</b> kick have enough space to perform it. For the player using the manoeuvre, the greatest danger happens during the drop; a bad fall can injure the head, back, or wrist. Witzig recommends players attempting the move to land on their upper back, using their arms as support, and simultaneously rolling over to a side in order to diminish impact from the drop. A poor <b>bicycle</b> kick can also expose a player to ridicule.|$|E

5|$|During {{the second}} half of the twentieth century, the <b>bicycle</b> kick would again be brought forth to {{international}} acclaim by Pelé. Pelé's capability to perform <b>bicycle</b> kicks with ease was one of the traits that made him stand out from other players early in his sports career, and it also boosted his self-confidence as a footballer. After Pelé, Argentine midfielder Diego Maradona and Mexican forward Hugo Sánchez became notable performers of the <b>bicycle</b> kick during the last decades of the 20th century. Other notable players to have performed the move during this period include Peruvian winger Juan Carlos Oblitas, who scored a <b>bicycle</b> kick goal in a 1975 Copa América match between Peru and Chile, and Welsh forward Mark Hughes, who scored from a <b>bicycle</b> kick in a World Cup qualification match played between Wales and Spain in 1985.|$|E
5|$|Irwin owned {{athletic}} {{facilities in}} Atlantic City, New Jersey, and negotiated with baseball officials about bringing organized baseball there in 1900. Irwin opened a motor-paced <b>bicycle</b> racing {{track in the}} city in July 1902. His focus on the <b>bicycle</b> track enterprise had been a factor in his resignation from the Penn coaching staff in 1902. He also became involved with the Hartford Avenue Colosseum Company and oversaw its Philadelphia <b>bicycle</b> track.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} shown that the couple created by gravity and the ground {{reaction}} forces is necessary for a <b>bicycle</b> to turn at all. On a custom built <b>bicycle</b> with spring-loaded outriggers that exactly cancel this couple, so that the <b>bicycle</b> and rider may assume any lean angle when traveling in a straight line, riders find it impossible to make a turn. As soon as the wheels deviate from a straight path, the <b>bicycle</b> and rider begin to lean in the opposite direction, {{and the only way to}} right them is to steer back onto the straight path.|$|E

5|$|The <b>bicycle</b> kick retains popular appeal; Hesse and Simpson {{highlight}} the positive impact a successful <b>bicycle</b> kick has on player notability, and the United States Soccer Federation {{describes it as}} an iconic embellishment of the sport. Defender Marcelo Balboa's <b>bicycle</b> kick in the 1994 FIFA World Cup match between Colombia and the United States received much praise and is even credited with boosting the sport's popularity in the United States. According to former Manchester City defender Paul Lake, a notable <b>bicycle</b> kick performed by English left winger Dennis Tueart in the English Premier League injured hundreds of fans who tried to emulate it. When Italian striker Mario Balotelli, during his youth development years, tried to pattern his skills on those of Brazilian midfielder Ronaldinho and French midfielder Zinedine Zidane, he fixated on the <b>bicycle</b> kick. The manoeuvre is also admired in variants of association football, such as beach soccer and futsal. An action like the <b>bicycle</b> kick is also used in sepak takraw, a sport {{whose objective is to}} kick a ball over a net and into the opposing team's side.|$|E
5|$|The <b>bicycle</b> kick {{was invented}} in South America, {{possibly}} {{as early as the}} late 19th century, during a period of development in football history. Innovations like the <b>bicycle</b> kick were the result of local adaptations to the football style introduced by British immigrants. Football lore has many legends on the possible origins of the <b>bicycle</b> kick.

50|$|The {{numbers of}} <b>bicycles</b> and {{motorcycles}} in use is very low. The per-capita ownership of motorcycles in Lesotho, and also <b>bicycles,</b> may {{be among the}} lowest in the world. The small number of people who do use <b>bicycles</b> tend to be children and young men, primarily for recreation although some use them for inter-village travel. A few people use <b>bicycles</b> for sport, and some South Africans and other tourists travel through the highlands on <b>bicycles.</b> A small number of transport entrepreneurs use <b>bicycles</b> to gain a livelihood.|$|R
5|$|A <b>bicycle</b> kick's {{successful}} performance generally requires great {{skill and}} athleticism. The performer needs to maintain good form when executing the move, and must simultaneously exhibit exceptional {{accuracy and precision}} when striking the ball. Sports historian Richard Witzig recommends that footballers attempt executing a <b>bicycle</b> kick with a focused and determined state of mind. Due to the action's complexity, a successfully executed <b>bicycle</b> kick is notable and, according to sports journalist Elliott Turner, prone to awe audiences. Brazilian forward Pelé, one of the sport's renowned players, also considers the manoeuvre difficult and recalled having scored from it {{only a few times}} out of his 1,283 career goals.|$|E

5|$|As {{an iconic}} skill, <b>bicycle</b> kicks are an {{important}} part of association football culture. Executing a <b>bicycle</b> kick in a competitive football match, particularly in scoring a goal, usually garners wide attention in the sports media. The <b>bicycle</b> kick has been featured in works of art, such as sculptures, films, advertisements, and literature. The manoeuvre is also used in other similar ball sports, particularly in the variants of association football like futsal and beach soccer. The controversy over the move's invention and name in Brazil, Chile, and Peru (and its status as an element of the notable Chile–Peru football rivalry) has added to the kick's acclaim in popular culture.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bicycle</b> kicks {{can be used}} defensively {{to clear}} away the ball from the goalmouth or offensively to strike at the opponent's goal {{in an attempt to}} score.

Mountain bike single speeds designed for trail riding often have a relatively low, or easy and slow, gear ratio. This allows them to climb hills and deal with obstacles and gradients better. This typically requires the rider to be more fit or skilled than the average rider in order to traverse the same terrain. Single speed <b>bicycles</b> designed for road riding typically have higher, or harder and faster, gear ratios.|$|R
