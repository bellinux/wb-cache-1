5|$|In {{the history}} of the carnivores, the family Canidae is {{represented}} by the two extinct subfamilies designated as Hesperocyoninae and Borophaginae, and the extant subfamily Caninae.

All living canids as a group form a dental monophyletic relationship with the extinct borophagines with both groups having a <b>bicuspid</b> (two points) on the lower carnassial talonid, which gives this tooth an additional ability in mastication. This together with the development of a distinct entoconid cusp and the broadening of the talonid of the first lower molar, and the corresponding enlargement of the talon of the upper first molar and reduction of its parastyle distinguish these late Cenozoic canids and are the essential differences that identify their clade.|$|E
5|$|Recently, {{the theory}} that temnospondyls were the {{ancestors}} of all lissamphibians has gained wide support.

Seen in lissamphibians and many dissorophoid temnospondyls, pedicellate teeth have calcified tips and bases. During the development of most tetrapods, teeth begin to calcify at their tips. Calcification normally proceeds downward {{to the base of the}} tooth, but calcification from the tip stops abruptly in pedicellate teeth.

40|$|Abstract Introduction: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} in anterior teeth, <b>bicuspids,</b> and molars (1) the accuracy of 3 different electronic apex locators (EALs) in detecting the apical foramen and (2) the accuracy of digital radiography in determining the working length (WL), compared with visible control under a microscope. Methods: By using radiovideography (RVG), we measured the lengths of 120 root canals with 3 different EALs (Endex, ProPex II, and Root ZX) and compared them with the actual lengths. The accuracy of EALs and RVG was related to each dental category. An endodontic training kit (Pro-Train) was used during experimental procedures. Results: Statistical analysis showed that the 3 EALs and RVG were less accurate in anterior teeth and molars than in <b>bicuspids.</b> The paired-sample t test showed no statistically significant difference between mesiodistal plane and buccolingual plane digital radiography in all groups. Conclusions: The 3 EALs tested were more accurate in detecting the apical foramen in <b>bicuspids</b> than in both molars and anterior teeth.

40|$|Aim and objectives. Abfraction is the {{pathological}} loss of cervical hard tooth substance {{caused by}} biomechanical overload. High horizontal occlusal forces result in large stress {{concentrations in the}} cervical region of the teeth. These stresses may be high enough to cause microfractures in the dental hard tissues, eventually resulting {{in the loss of}} cervical enamel and dentin. The present study proposes the microstructural characterization of these cervical lesions by en face optical coherence tomography (eFOCT). Material and methods: 31 extracted <b>bicuspids</b> were investigated using eFOCT. 24 teeth derived from patients with active bruxism and occlusal interferences; they presented deep buccal abfractions and variable degrees of occlusal pathological attrition. The other 7 <b>bicuspids</b> were not exposed to occlusal overload and had a normal morphology of the dental crowns. The dental samples were investigated using an eFOCT system operating at 1300 nm (B-scan at 1 Hz and C-scan mode at 2 Hz). The system has a lateral resolution better than 5 Î¼m and a depth resolution of 9 Î¼m in tissue. OCT images were further compared with micro - computer tomography images. Results. The eFOCT investigation of <b>bicuspids</b> with a normal morphology revealed a homogeneous structure of the buccal cervical enamel. The C-scan and B-scan images obtained from the occlusal overloaded <b>bicuspids</b> visualized the wedge-shaped loss of cervical enamel and damage in the microstructure of the underlaying dentin. The high occlusal forces produced a characteristic pattern of large cracks, which reached the tooth surface.

Expansion measurements were made 1 - 2 months before surgery, 6 and at least 12 months after surgery. The transverse occlusion was corrected in all cases. After 12 months the gingival landmarks revealed an expansion range from - 0. 83 to + 2. 92 mm for the cuspids, + 1. 66 to + 6. 23 mm for the <b>bicuspids</b> and from + 2. 68 to + 4. 80 mm for the molars.

2500|$|The first heart sound, or S1, {{forms the}} [...] "lub" [...] of [...] "lub-dub" [...] and is {{composed}} of components M1 (mitral valve closure) and T1 (tricuspid valve closure). Normally M1 precedes T1 slightly. It {{is caused by the}} [...] closure of the atrioventricular valves, i.e. tricuspid and mitral (<b>bicuspid),</b> at the beginning of ventricular contraction, or systole. When the ventricles begin to contract, so do the papillary muscles in each ventricle. The papillary muscles are attached to the cusps or leaflets of the tricuspid and mitral valves via chordae tendineae (heart strings). When the papillary muscles contract, the chordae tendineae become tense and thereby prevent the backflow of blood into the lower pressure environment of the atria. The chordae tendineae act a bit like the strings on a parachute, and allow the leaflets of the valve to balloon up into the atria slightly, but not so much as to evert the cusp edges and allow back flow of blood. It is the pressure created from ventricular contraction that closes the valve, not the papillary muscles themselves. The contraction of the ventricle begins just prior to AV valves closing and prior to the semilunar valves opening. The sudden tensing of the chordae tendineae and the squeezing of the ventricles against closed semilunar valves, sends blood rushing back toward the atria, and the parachute-like valves catch the rush of blood in their leaflets causing the valve to snap shut. The S1 sound results from reverberation within the blood associated with the sudden block of flow reversal by the valves. The delay of T1 even more than normally causes the split S1 which is heard in a right bundle branch blockage.|$|E
60|$|Those {{authors who}} adopt this latter view would {{probably}} deny that each separate variation {{has its own}} proper exciting cause. Although we can seldom trace the precise relation between cause and effect, yet the considerations presently to be given lead {{to the conclusion that}} each modification must have its own distinct cause, and is not the result of what we blindly call accident. The following striking case has been communicated to me by Dr. William Ogle. Two girls, born as twins, and in all respects extremely alike, had their little fingers on both hands crooked; and in both children the second <b>bicuspid</b> tooth of the second dentition on the right side in the upper jaw was misplaced; for, instead of standing in a line with the others, it grew from the roof of the mouth behind the first <b>bicuspid.</b> Neither the parents nor any other members of the family were known to have exhibited any similar peculiarity; but a son of one of these girls had the same tooth similarly misplaced. Now, as both the girls were affected in exactly the same manner, the idea of accident is at once excluded: and we are compelled to admit that there must have existed some precise and sufficient cause which, if it had occurred a hundred times, would have given crooked fingers and misplaced <b>bicuspid</b> teeth to a hundred children. It is of course possible that this case may have been due to reversion to some long-forgotten progenitor, and this would much weaken the value of the argument. I have been led to think of the probability of reversion, from having been told by Mr. Galton of another case of twin girls born with their little fingers slightly crooked, which they inherited from their maternal grandmother.|$|E
