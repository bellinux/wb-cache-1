Gagauz meat dishes are often accompanied by peppered sauces.|$|E
50|$|In the Middle East, {{particularly}} Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, Israel, Jordan, and Iraq, it {{is usually}} served {{as part of a}} meze. The Lebanese use more parsley than <b>bulgur</b> <b>wheat</b> in their dish. A Turkish variation of the dish is known as kısır, while a similar Armenian dish is known as eetch. In Cyprus, where the dish was introduced by the Lebanese, it is known as tambouli. In the Dominican Republic, a local version introduced by Lebanese immigrants is called Tipile.|$|E
5000|$|Farofa (...) is a toasted {{cassava flour}} mixture. [...] It is eaten mainly in Brazil. It {{can be found}} commercially {{produced}} and packaged but is often prepared at home based on family recipes. Most recipes will also contain varying amounts of salt, smoked meat, and spices. The consistency of the mixture ranges from large grains the size of cracked <b>bulgur</b> <b>wheat</b> or couscous down to a table-salt-sized powder. Most farofas have a very smoky and slightly salty taste, by and large used to accentuate the taste of meat, particularly barbecued meat and hearty stews.|$|E

5000|$|They staged {{protests that}} {{included}} {{the threat of a}} curse and a sex strike. Of the strike, Gbowee says, [...] "The sex strike lasted, on and off, for a few months. It had little or no practical effect, but it was extremely valuable in getting us media attention." [...] In a highly risky move, the women finally occupied a field that had been used for soccer; it was beside Tubman Boulevard, the route Charles Taylor traveled twice a day, to and from Capitol Hill. To make themselves more recognizable as a group, all of the women wore T-shirts that were white, signifying peace, with the WIPNET logo and white hair ties. Taylor finally granted a hearing for the women on April 23, 2003. With more than 2,000 women amassed outside his executive mansion, Gbowee was the person designated to make their case to him. Gbowee positioned her face to be seen by Taylor but directed her words to Grace Minor, the president of the senate and the only female government official present: We are tired of war. We are tired of running. We are tired of begging for <b>bulgur</b> <b>wheat.</b> We are tired of our children being raped. We are now taking this stand, to secure the future of our children. Because we believe, as custodians of society, tomorrow our children will ask us, [...] "Mama, what was your role during the crisis?" [...] In her book, Gbowee reveals that Grace Minor quietly [...] "gave a great deal of her own money... at enormous personal risk" [...] to the women's protest movement. The protesting women extracted a promise from President Charles Taylor to attend peace talks in Ghana to negotiate with the rebels from Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy and another newer rebel group, MODEL.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Aflatoxins are mutagenic, carcinogenic, and {{teratogenic}} mycotoxins. The {{objective of}} this work was to study the presence of aflatoxigenic Aspergillus in commercial <b>Bulgur</b> <b>wheat</b> {{in the city of}} Maringá, Paraná, Brazil. Thirty samples of commercial <b>Bulgur</b> <b>wheat,</b> acquired in the period of August 2011 to January 2012, were evaluated. The enumeration analysis showed that samples had up to 273. 3 CFU of molds and 133. 3 CFU of aflatoxigenic Aspergillus per gram of wheat. Forty-two monosporic isolates were obtained and identified as Aspergillus flavus. The isolates were analyzed regarding their aflatoxigenic potential by culture in coconut milk agar; hydroxide vapor exposure; chromatography; and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting genes that code enzymes of the aflatoxins synthesis pathway. Some of the isolates were confirmed to be aflatoxin producers and several of them presented a genetic profile of aflatoxin synthesis. The obtained results demonstrated that <b>Bulgur</b> <b>wheat</b> A. flavus contamination is concerning...|$|E
40|$|The {{detection}} of mycotoxigenic fungi in foodstuff {{is important because}} their presence may indicate the possible associated mycotoxin contamination. Fusarium graminearum is a wheat pathogen and a producer of micotoxins. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been employed for the specific identification of F. graminearum. However, this methodology has not been commonly used for {{detection of}} F. graminearum in food. Thus, {{the objective of the}} present study was to develop a molecular methodology to detect F. graminearum in commercial samples of <b>bulgur</b> <b>wheat.</b> Two methods were tested. In the first method, a sample of this cereal was contaminated with F. graminearum mycelia. The genomic DNA was extracted from this mixture and used in a F. graminearum specific PCR reaction. The F. graminearum species was detected only in samples that were heavily contaminated. In the second method, samples of <b>bulgur</b> <b>wheat</b> were inoculated on a solid medium, and isolates having F. graminearum culture characteristics were obtained. The DNA extracted from these isolates was tested in F. graminearum specific PCR reactions. An isolate obtained had its trichothecene genotype identified by PCR. The established methodology could be used in surveys of food contamination with F. graminearum...|$|E
50|$|Meals tend {{to favor}} meats and {{starches}} over dairy products and vegetables. Many dishes are made with sofrito, which {{is a mix of}} local herbs used as a wet rub for meats and sautéed to bring out all of a dish's flavors.

50|$|The {{preparation}} of meat, fish, and vegetable dishes in an Armenian kitchen often requires stuffing, frothing, and puréeing. Lamb, eggplant, and bread (lavash) are basic features of Armenian cuisine. Armenians traditionally used cracked <b>wheat</b> (<b>bulgur)</b> in preference to maize and rice. The {{flavor of the}} food relies on the quality and freshness of the ingredients rather than on excessive use of spices.|$|R
