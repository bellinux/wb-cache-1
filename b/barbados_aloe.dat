500|$|The {{species has}} a number of synonyms: A. barbadensis Mill., Aloe indica Royle, Aloe perfoliata L. var. vera and A. vulgaris Lam. Common names include Chinese Aloe, Indian Aloe, True Aloe, <b>Barbados</b> <b>Aloe,</b> Burn Aloe, First Aid Plant. The species epithet vera means [...] "true" [...] or [...] "genuine". Some {{literature}} identifies the white-spotted form of Aloe vera as Aloe vera var. chinensis; however, the species varies widely with regard to leaf spots and {{it has been suggested that}} the spotted form of Aloe vera may be conspecific with A. massawana. The species was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753 as Aloe perfoliata var. vera, and was described again in 1768 by Nicolaas Laurens Burman as Aloe vera in Flora Indica on 6 April and by Philip Miller as Aloe barbadensis some ten days after Burman in the Gardener's Dictionary.|$|E

50|$|Aloe emodin {{is found}} in the gel, sap or leaves of Aloe vera, the socotrine aloe, <b>Barbados</b> <b>aloe,</b> and Zanzibar aloes, the bark of Frangula (Rhamnus frangula) and Cascara Sagrada (Rhamnus purshiana), the leaves of Senna (Cassia angustifolia), and the rhizome of Rhubarb (Rheum rhaponticum).Aloe-emodin has not been found in Natal aloes. It has a marked anti-viral effect in vitro against both herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 and 2.|$|E
50|$|According to W. A. Shenstone, {{two classes}} of aloins are recognized: (1) nataloins, which yield picric and oxalic acids with nitric acid, and do not give a red {{coloration}} with nitric acid; and (2) barbaloins, which yield aloetic acid (C7H2N3O5), chrysammic acid (C7H2N2O6), picric and oxalic acids with nitric acid, being reddened by the acid. This second group may be divided into a-barbaloins, obtained from <b>Barbados</b> <b>Aloe,</b> and reddened in the cold, and b-barbaloins, obtained from Aloe Socotrina and Zanzibar Aloe, reddened by ordinary nitric acid only when warmed or by fuming acid in the cold. Nataloin (2C17H13O7Â·H2O) forms bright-yellow scales, barbaloin (C17H18O7) prismatic crystals. Aloe species also contain a trace of volatile oil, to which their odour is due.|$|E

40|$|<b>Barbados</b> <b>aloe</b> (Aloe vera (L.) Burm. f.) has {{traditionally}} been used for healing in natural medicine. However, aloe is now attracting great interest in the global market due to its bioactive chemicals which are extracted from the leaves and used in industrial preparations for pharmaceutical, cosmetic and food products. Aloe originated from tropical and sub-tropical Africa, {{but it is also}} now cultivated in warm climatic areas of Asia, Europe and America. In this review, the most important factors affecting aloe production are described. We focus on propagation techniques, sustainable agronomic practices and efficient post harvesting and processing systems...|$|E
