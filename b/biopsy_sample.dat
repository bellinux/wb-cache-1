5|$|Muscle biopsy can {{be useful}} if an episode of {{rhabdomyolysis}} {{is thought to be}} the result of an underlying muscle disorder. A <b>biopsy</b> <b>sample</b> taken during an episode is often uninformative, as it will show only evidence of cell death or may appear normal. Taking the sample is therefore delayed for several weeks or months. The histopathological appearance on the biopsy indicates the nature of the underlying disorder. For instance, mitochondrial diseases are characterized by ragged red fibers. Biopsy sites may be identified by medical imaging, such as magnetic resonance imaging, as the muscles may not be uniformly affected.|$|E

500|$|Female {{killer whales}} begin to mature at around {{the age of}} 10 (reaching peak {{fertility}} around 20), which consists of periods of polyestrous cycling with non-cycling periods of between three and 16 months. Females can often breed until age 40, after which comes a rapid decrease in fertility. As such, orcas are among the animals that undergo menopause and live for decades after they have finished breeding. [...] The lifespans of wild females average 50 years. Some are claimed to have lived substantially longer; Granny (J2) was estimated by some researchers to have been as much as 105 {{years old at the}} time of her death, but a <b>biopsy</b> <b>sample</b> indicated her age as being 65-80.|$|E

From 60 paired comparisons of bladder and ear <b>biopsy</b> <b>samples,</b> the PCR results were concordantly positive or negative in 43 samples (71. 7 %). Of the 17 which differed, 14 bladder samples were positive and ear samples were negative while the converse occurred for three <b>samples.</b> Thus ear <b>biopsy</b> <b>samples</b> led to a significantly lower estimate of infection than bladder <b>biopsy</b> <b>samples.</b> This suggests that the use of ear <b>biopsy</b> <b>samples</b> in epidemiological studies of B. burgdorferi in Central European rodents is likely to lead to underestimates of the prevalence...|$|R
2500|$|Disagreement {{over the}} value of data {{obtained}} through lethal methods continued as well. Some argued that {{a wide range of}} questions could be answered through non-lethal means such as [...] "for pollutant monitoring (<b>biopsy</b> <b>sampling</b> for fatty acid and stable isotope analysis), for stock structure (photo identification, <b>biopsy</b> <b>sampling</b> and faecal sampling), and for feeding ecology (faecal sampling)." [...] Others argued that prey data was required for modeling purposes that could not be acquired through non-lethal means. However, feeding ecology was not necessarily relevant to stock management according to some who argued <b>biopsy</b> <b>sampling</b> would allow for a greater amount of statistical data.|$|R
40|$|Remote tissue <b>biopsy</b> <b>sampling</b> and {{satellite}} tagging are becoming {{widely used in}} large marine vertebrate studies because they allow the collection of a diverse suite of otherwise difficult-to-obtain data which are critical in understanding the ecology of these species and to their conservation and management. Researchers must carefully consider their methods not only from an animal welfare perspective, but also to ensure the scientific rigour and validity of their results. We report methods for shore-based, remote <b>biopsy</b> <b>sampling</b> {{and satellite}} tagging of killer whales Orcinus orca at Subantarctic Marion Island. The performance of these methods is critically assessed using 1) the attachment duration of low-impact minimally percutaneous satellite tags; 2) the immediate behavioural reactions of animals to <b>biopsy</b> <b>sampling</b> and satellite tagging; 3) the effect of researcher experience on <b>biopsy</b> <b>sampling</b> and satellite tagging; and 4) the mid- (1 month) and long- (24 month) term behavioural consequences. To study mid- and long-term behavioural changes we used multievent capture-recapture models that accommodate imperfect detection and individual heterogeneity. We made 72 <b>biopsy</b> <b>sampling</b> attempts (resulting in 32 tissue samples) and 37 satellite tagging attempts (deploying 19 tags). <b>Biopsy</b> <b>sampling</b> success rates were low (43 %), but tagging rates were high with improved tag designs (86 %). The improved tags remained attached for 26 ± 14 days (mean ± SD). Individuals most often showed no reaction when attempts missed (66 %) and a slight reaction-defined as a slight flinch, slight shake, short acceleration, or immediate dive-when hit (54 %). Severe immediate reactions were never observed. Hit or miss and age-sex class were important predictors of the reaction, but the method (tag or biopsy) was unimportant. Multievent trap-dependence modelling revealed considerable variation in individual sighting patterns; however, {{there were no significant}} mid- or long-term changes following <b>biopsy</b> <b>sampling</b> or tagging...|$|R

40|$|Background. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} concordance rates for prostatectomy specimens and transrectal needle <b>biopsy</b> <b>samples</b> in various areas of the prostate in order to assess diagnostic accuracy of the transrectal biopsy approach, especially for presurgical detection of cancer in the prostatic apex. Materials and Methods. From 2006 to 2011, 158 patients whose radical prostatectomy specimens had been evaluated were retrospectively enrolled in this study. Concordance rates for histopathology results of prostatectomy specimens and needle <b>biopsy</b> <b>samples</b> were evaluated in 8 prostatic sections (apex, middle, base, and transitional zones bilaterally) from 73 patients diagnosed at this institution, besides factors for detecting apex cancer in total 118 true positive and false negative apex cancers. Results. Prostate cancer was found most frequently (85 %) in the apex of all patients. Of 584 histopathology sections, 153 (49 %) from all areas were false negatives, as were 45 % of apex <b>biopsy</b> <b>samples.</b> No readily available preoperative factors for detecting apex cancer were identified. Conclusions. In Japanese patients, the most frequent location of prostate cancer is in the apex.

40|$|BackgroundDiagnostic {{bronchial}} <b>biopsy</b> <b>samples</b> from {{lung cancer}} patients {{may be used}} for molecular biologic analyses to help select therapy and provide prognostic information. Some have suggested that direct molecular analysis of bronchial biopsy fragments may be feasible, bypassing histologic examination. We analyzed a series of 100 bronchial biopsy specimens in lung cancer patients to assess the frequency and quantity of tumor present in <b>biopsy</b> <b>samples.</b> MethodsThe proportion of tumor in bronchial biopsy specimens was assessed by measuring the tumor area in histologic sections using computer-aided morphometry. ResultsIn only 48 % of cases did all the biopsy fragments contain some tumor. The median number of fragments obtained at bronchoscopy was 4; median number actually containing tumor was 3. The mean total surface area of tumor (as a percentage of the total <b>sample</b> area) in <b>biopsy</b> fragments was, for all cases, 33. 4 %; median area 28 %. Biopsies with small cell carcinoma had more tumor (mean area 46. 5 %, median 49 %; p = 0. 0006) than all other non-small cell carcinoma cases. ConclusionMalignant bronchial <b>biopsy</b> <b>samples</b> frequently contain limited amounts of primary carcinoma. Often, {{one or more of the}} biopsy fragments will not contain tumor. This has important implications for the storage and use of bronchial <b>biopsy</b> <b>samples</b> for genetic analysis...|$|R
40|$|Background Diagnosis of many immune-mediated {{diseases}} is {{helped by}} detection of antibodies {{directed against the}} pathogenetic (self or foreign) antigen. In coeliac disease (CD), {{we have a situation}} in which antiendomysial antibodies (EMA), which are not specific for the pathogenetic antigen, reach a specificity and sensitivity of detection of CD approaching 100 %, whereas detection of antibodies against gliadin (AGA), the pathogenetic antigen, is far less specific and sensitive in diagnosis. No direct evidence of a relation between gluten/gliadin challenge and EMA production exists. We tried to establish whether the small intestine of CD patients is the site of EMA production and whether gliadin challenge could induce their release. Methods Small intestine <b>biopsy</b> <b>samples</b> from treated (23) and untreated (16) CD patients and controls (18) were cultured in vitro for 24 - 48 h in the presence of gliadin, another alimentary antigen, or medium. EMA and AGA were detected in the supernatants of these organ culture <b>biopsy</b> <b>samples</b> by ELISA and immunofluorescence technique, respectively. Findings No EMA were found in the culture supernatants of <b>biopsy</b> <b>samples</b> of 18 controls, whereas they were detected in the culture supernatants of all 16 untreated CD patients irrespective of gliadin challenge. Conversely, EMA were not detected in supernatants of <b>biopsy</b> <b>samples</b> cultured in medium only from 23 treated CD patients, but were detected in 17 of the 23 <b>biopsy</b> <b>samples</b> challenged with gliadin. Interpretation Our results suggest that a more complex pathogenetic mechanism than normally accepted is involved in CD, Furthermore, our findings raise the possibility that EMA, or the antigen recognised by them, are involved directly in the pathogenesis of CD...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Sequencing-based {{analysis}} {{has become a}} well-established approach to deciphering {{the composition of the}} gut microbiota. However, due to the complexity of accessing sufficient material from colonoscopic <b>biopsy</b> <b>samples,</b> most studies have focused on faecal microbiota analysis, even though it is recognised that differences exist between the microbial composition of colonic <b>biopsies</b> and faecal <b>samples.</b> We determined the suitability of colonic lavage samples to see if it had comparable microbial diversity composition to colonic biopsies as they are without the limitations associated with sample size. We collected paired colonic <b>biopsies</b> and lavage <b>samples</b> from subjects who were attending for colorectal cancer screening colonoscopy. RESULTS: Next-generation sequencing and qPCR validation were performed with multiple bioinformatics analyses to determine the composition and predict function of the microbiota. Colonic lavage samples contained significantly higher numbers of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) compared to corresponding <b>biopsy</b> <b>samples,</b> however, diversity and evenness between lavage and <b>biopsy</b> <b>samples</b> were similar. The differences seen were driven by the presence of 12 OTUs which were in higher relative abundance in biopsies and were either not present or in low relative abundance in lavage samples, whilst a further 3 OTUs were present in higher amounts in the lavage <b>samples</b> compared to <b>biopsy</b> <b>samples.</b> However, predicted functional community profiling based on 16 S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) data indicated minimal differences between sample types.
