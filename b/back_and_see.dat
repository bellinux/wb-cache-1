5|$|I {{longed for}} real companionship, for {{apart from that}} life had nothing to offer me in Darmstadt...So {{naturally}} I am bitterly disappointed with myself when I look <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> {{that in spite of}} great ambitions, good intentions, and real effort, my hopes have nevertheless been completely ship-wrecked...You say, darling, that you would never have caused me hardship intentionally...I only regret the lack of any intention or desire – or rather insight – to be more to me, and that does not mean spending all your time with me, without wishing to share anything with me at the same time. But I am wrong to talk of these things. Your letters are so dear and kind – but so empty and bare – I feel myself through them that I have less to say to you than any other person. Rain – fine weather – things that have happened – that is all I ever have to tell you about – so utterly cut off is my real self, my innermost life, from yours...I have tried again and again {{to talk to you about}} more serious things, when I felt the need to do so – but we never meet each other – we have developed separately...and that is why I feel true companionship is an impossibility for us – because our thoughts will never meet...I love you too so very much, my darling husband, and that is why it is so sad to feel that our life is nevertheless so incomplete...But you are never intentionally to blame for this – I never think that, never...|$|E
25|$|It {{is strange}} to look <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> how this frail-looking young man burst {{on the scene}} in 1953. We had sent Ken Joy, the former BBAR, to {{challenge}} for the Grand Prix des Nations, then 140 kilometres long, and dragging through the hills of the Chevreuse valley. All over Paris they talked about this burly Englishman who had ridden 160km in 4 hours and 6 minutes: and when it came to it, he was hammered by a 19-year-old, but a teenager with a will of iron that was to prove inflexible for the next 19 years.|$|E

500|$|Marshall {{also cited}} [...] (1983), Zulu (1964), and works of {{director}} Terry Gilliam like The Fisher King (1991) as influences in producing Doomsday. Marshall acknowledged that his creation is [...] "so outrageous you've got to laugh". He reflected, [...] "I do think it's going to divide audiences...

[...] He also compared the film's structure to Citizen Kane (which also contained an interrogator and a subject who is telling a story) and the criminal caper The Anderson Tapes.|$|E
500|$|... "Lisa's First Word" [...] {{was written}} by Jeff Martin, and {{directed}} by Mark Kirkland. The Simpsons writers Mike Reiss and Al Jean were discussing about having an episode where Maggie would say her first word, and Reiss {{thought it would be}} cute to have her say [...] "daddy" [...] when no one could hear her. Jeff Martin was assigned to write the episode because he had done another flashback episode in the past, [...] "I Married Marge". Martin was excited to do another flashback episode because he thought it was fun to check out old newspapers and go <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> what was in the news back in 1983 and 1984. Martin felt it was a good way of finding a new set of things to make jokes about.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, Murphy commented {{on the structure of}} the series' first season. [...] "I loved how it began. I loved it in the middle and I loved the end. The only thing really frustrating for me, to be honest with you, is that sometimes people would write this idea that we were making it up as we went along and I wanted to say, 'Really?' But I think now people are writing and saying, 'Oh yeah!' I'm excited for people to see it on DVD, because now that they know how it ended, [...] go <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> all of the little things, like people who have no reflections in mirrors. When you go back, you will see everything was set up." [...] When asked if the House [...] "pulled" [...] the Harmons to it, Murphy responded, [...] "I don't know if they were targeted. I don't think the Internet site had any supernatural pull to it...although that would have been hilarious. I thought it was two things: it was house porn because I think that house really is extraordinary. And also I think there's always that allure in American lives of the fresh start, moving West, starting fresh." ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{originally}} intended as an unambiguous ending {{to the television}} series, the unexpected popularity and box office success of The Inbetweeners Movie led to speculation over {{the possibility of a}} sequel. These rumours began in early September 2011, while the film was still in cinemas, and were denied by its writers and actors. Around the same time, producer Christopher Young openly recognised the possibility of another film based on the series, claiming that [...] "if there is a sequel it will come from the creative elements... We've talked about it. In the short term people are dispersing and doing other things but I'm sure in the medium term a sequel is very possible. It won't be immediate but it's definitely not closed." [...] Co-writer Damon Beesley later admitted [...] "we didn't know how successful it would be and that it would have a life on screen. But they did translate to big-screen characters, people did care about them and did go <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> it more than once – and that's very rare in cinema. The idea of not following that up seemed insane to most people". The actors had mixed emotions on making a sequel. Although Buckley and Thomas felt put off by the success of the first film, Harrison and Bird became convinced on reading the script.|$|E

[...] Bunmi Mojekwu, who plays Mercy Olubunmi, commented [...] "I feel so blessed to be part of EastEnders: E20. My first day on set was just crazy. I was on Albert Square – a dream come true – I'm enjoying every second." [...] Sam Attwater, who previously appeared in five episodes of Hollyoaks, was cast as boxer Leon Small. On his casting, he commented, [...] "It's a great privilege to be working with such great actors and on such an established show. It's an amazing opportunity and I'm really enjoying tackling a character like Leon who has so much going on," [...] He prepared for the role by attending a gym, as the character has a lot of topless scenes. He said: [...] "As soon as I heard that I was straight down the gym. Lots of crunches. Everyone said don't worry about it, but every time I did one of those scenes I had to watch it <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> how it looked because there will be 10 million people watching it.

A writer from The Huffington Post called it [...] "an epic, emotionally-charged performance" [...] and praised the fact that Beyoncé [...] "channel every particle of the room's energy into her lung-bursting calls and cries." [...] Jillian Mapes of Billboard magazine noted, [...] "The sheer force of the ballad literally brought [...] to her knees during the performance." [...] Shortly after Beyoncé's performance on American Idol, a video that surfaced online received considerable coverage from music critics. It became an instant viral video as soon as it hit the web. The clip was filmed using a camera phone and it shows Beyoncé rehearsing [...] "1+1" [...] backstage at American Idol with no microphone and simple keyboard accompaniment. The video was filmed by Beyoncé'ss husband, Jay-Z. In an introduction to the video on his Life + Times website he wrote: [...] "Sometimes you need perspective.

[...] The college, loosely affiliated with Mennonite Church USA, which is traditionally a peace church, published an online fact sheet stating that [...] "historically, playing the national anthem has not been among Goshen College's practices because of our Christ-centered core value of compassionate peacemaking seeming to be in conflict with the anthem’s militaristic language." ...|$|E

If I'm like a volcano and I'm about to explode, I better run to an instrument because it's about to come out. For me, I don't really go back. I probably should. I have a bajillion pieces of songs. But I seem to just write in one sitting. There's very few occasions where I've gone back and worked on songs later. Normally, I sit down, the song comes out and I'm done." ...|$|E

2500|$|Byrne's post-X-Men {{body of work}} at Marvel {{includes}} his five-year run on Fantastic Four (#232–295, July 1981-October 1986), {{which is}} generally considered a [...] "second golden age" [...] for the title. Byrne said {{his goal was to}} [...] "turn the clock back ... get <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> fresh what it was that made the book great at its inception". He made a number of changes during his tenure: The Thing was temporarily replaced {{as a member of the}} quartet by the She-Hulk, while the Thing had adventures in his own comic (#1 - 22 also written by Byrne), and the Thing's longtime girlfriend Alicia Masters left him for his teammate the Human Torch; the Invisible Girl was developed into the most powerful member with her heightened control of her refined powers and the self-confident assertiveness to use it epitomized by her name change to the Invisible Woman; and headquarters the Baxter Building was destroyed and replaced with Four Freedoms Plaza. Byrne has cited multiple reasons for leaving the series, including [...] "internal office politics" [...] and that [...] "it simply started to get old".|$|E
2500|$|The same year, John Byrne {{began his}} six-year run writing and {{illustrating}} Fantastic Four, sparking a [...] "second golden age" [...] {{for the title}} but also attempting to [...] "turn the clock back [...] get <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> fresh {{what it was that}} made the book great at its inception." [...] Doctor Doom made his first appearance under Byrne's tenure with issue #236. Whereas Kirby had intimated that Doom's disfigurement was more a figment of Victor's vain personality, Byrne decided that Doom's face was truly ravaged: only Doom's own robot slaves are allowed to see the monarch without his helmet. Byrne emphasized other aspects of Doom's personality; despite his ruthless nature, Victor von Doom is a man of honor. Returning to Latveria after being temporarily deposed, Doctor Doom abandons a scheme to wrest mystical secrets from Doctor Strange in order to oversee his land's reconstruction. Despite a tempestuous temper, Doom occasionally shows warmth and empathy to others; he tries to free his mother from Mephisto and treats Kristoff Vernard like his own son. Byrne gave further detail regarding Doom's scarring: Byrne introduced the idea that the accident at Empire State University only left Victor with a small scar that was exaggerated into a more disfiguring accident by Doom's own arrogance—by donning his newly forged face mask before it had fully cooled, he caused massive irreparable damage.|$|E

In 2005, Timberlake launched the William Rast clothing line with childhood friend Juan ("Trace") Ayala. The 2007 line contained cord jackets, cashmere sweaters, jeans, and polo shirts. The pair reports inspiration from fellow Memphis native Elvis Presley: [...] "Elvis is the perfect mixture of Justin and I," [...] Ayala says. [...] "You can go <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> pictures of him in cowboy boots and a cowboy hat and a nice button-down shirt, but then again you can see him in a tux and a collared shirt with rhinestones on it and slacks. We like to think 'If he was alive today, what would he be wearing?'" [...] Target has announced that a William Rast collection, including denim, outerwear and sportswear for men and women, would launch in December and be available for a month. In 2015, the clothing line earned him a Lord & Taylor's Fashion Oracle Award at the Fashion Group International's Night of The Stars Gala. An avid amateur golfer, in 2007 Timberlake purchased the run-down Big Creek Golf Course in his home town of Millington, Tennessee, which he redeveloped as the eco-friendly Mirimichi Golf Course {{at a cost of}} some $US16 million. It was reopened on July 25, 2009 but closed again on January 15, 2010 for further improvements expected to take six months. In October 2011, Timberlake received the Futures Award at the Environmental Media Awards for his green-conscious golf course. It was reported on November 7, 2014, that Timberlake had sold Mirimichi to Three Star Leasing LLC for $500,000. Timberlake and his wife Jessica Biel are minority owners of the Memphis Grizzlies.|$|E
