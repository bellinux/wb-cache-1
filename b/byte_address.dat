25|$|The {{program counter}} is a 64-bit {{register}} which contains a longword-aligned virtual <b>byte</b> <b>address,</b> that is, the low two {{bits of the}} program counter are always zero. The PC is incremented by four to {{the address of the}} next instruction when an instruction is decoded. A lock flag and locked physical address register are used by the load-locked and store-conditional instructions for multiprocessor support. The floating-point control register (FPCR) is a 64-bit register defined by the architecture intended for use by Alpha implementations with IEEE 754-compliant floating-point hardware.|$|E
50|$|Some {{architectures}} like MIPS {{have special}} unaligned load and store instructions. One unaligned load instruction gets the bytes from the memory word {{with the lowest}} <b>byte</b> <b>address</b> and another gets the bytes from the memory word with the highest <b>byte</b> <b>address.</b> Similarly, store-high and store-low instructions store the appropriate bytes in the higher and lower memory words respectively.|$|E
50|$|With byte addressing, {{that can}} be {{achieved}} in one instruction: store this character code at that <b>byte</b> <b>address.</b> Text programs are easier to write, smaller, and run faster.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Byte</b> <b>addressing</b> {{means that}} the {{physical}} address passed on the Unibus is interpreted as the address of a byte-sized quantity of data. Because the bus actually contains a data path that is two <b>bytes</b> wide, <b>address</b> bit [...] is subject to special interpretation and data on the bus has to travel in the correct byte lanes.|$|R
5000|$|Because Prime's {{hardware}} did {{not perform}} <b>byte</b> <b>addressing,</b> there was no impetus to create a C compiler. Late models of the hardware were eventually modified to support [...] "I-mode", and programs compiled in C.|$|R
50|$|At {{least partly}} due {{to the success of the}} S/360, and the {{resultant}} standardization on 8-bit character codes and <b>byte</b> <b>addressing,</b> nine-track tapes were very widely used throughout the computer industry during the 1970s and 1980s.|$|R
50|$|An SSI message {{consists}} of a 2-byte header and an n-byte payload. The header {{consists of}} a one <b>byte</b> <b>address</b> (wildcard is '?', 0x3F in ASCII) and a one byte message/command type. The different possible values for the message/command type are presented in SSI v1.2 command base.|$|E
50|$|Short {{branches}} are 2-byte instructions, and use 256-byte range, single <b>byte</b> <b>address,</b> page {{absolute addressing}} {{in the range}} 0 to 255 (hex FF). There is no relative branching. Therefore, {{care must be taken}} when attempting to cross page boundaries, which is impossible using short branches, except in two cases. There can be 'side effects', or known usage, when performing a short branch and the short branch instruction or the address byte is the last byte on the page. In this instance, because the PC is incremented after retrieving the <b>byte</b> <b>address,</b> or when the address byte is the first byte of the next page, the PC now points to the next page, not the page in which the branch instruction/byte address is located, so the branch will be in that next page.|$|E
50|$|The {{formulation}} above {{checks the}} entire {{result of an}} add. However, in a CPU cache decoder, the entire result of the add is a <b>byte</b> <b>address,</b> and the cache is usually indexed with a larger address, in our example, that of an 8-byte block. It is preferable to ignore {{a few of the}} LSBs of the address. However, the LSBs of the two addends can't be ignored because they may produce a carry-out which would change the doubleword addressed.|$|E
50|$|<b>Byte</b> <b>addressing</b> {{refers to}} {{hardware}} architectures which support accessing individual bytes of data rather than only larger units called words, {{which would be}} word-addressable. Such computers are sometimes called byte machines (in contrast to word machines).|$|R
50|$|Later {{models of}} the DEC PDP-11 series mapped the {{registers}} onto addresses in the input/output area, but this was primarily intended to allow remote diagnostics. Confusingly, the 16-bit registers were mapped onto consecutive 8-bit <b>byte</b> <b>addresses.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{high-order}} four bits {{specify the}} operation {{to be performed}} (with bit 15 generally selecting word versus <b>byte</b> <b>addressing).</b> Two groups of six bits specify mode and register, as defined above, for each of two operands.|$|R
5000|$|An Entry Sequenced Data Set (ESDS) {{is a type}} of {{data set}} used by the VSAM {{computer}} data storage system. Records are accessed based on their sequential order, that is, the order in which they were written to the file; which means that accessing a particular record involves searching all the records sequentially until it is located, or by using a relative physical address (Relative <b>byte</b> <b>address,</b> RBA), i.e. the number of bytes {{from the beginning of the}} file to start reading.|$|E
5000|$|If the 8086 is {{to retain}} 8-bit object codes {{and hence the}} {{efficient}} memory use of the 8080, then it cannot guarantee that (16-bit) opcodes and data will lie on an even-odd <b>byte</b> <b>address</b> boundary. The first 8-bit opcode will shift the next 8-bit instruction to an odd byte or a 16-bit instruction to an odd-even byte boundary. By implementing the [...] signal and the extra logic needed, the 8086 has allows instructions to exist as 1-byte, 3-byte or any other odd byte object codes.|$|E
50|$|The {{program counter}} is a 64-bit {{register}} which contains a longword-aligned virtual <b>byte</b> <b>address,</b> that is, the low two {{bits of the}} program counter are always zero.

50|$|To {{illustrate}} why <b>byte</b> <b>addressing</b> is useful, {{consider the}} IBM 7094 which is word addressable {{and has no}} concept of a byte. It has 36 bit words, and stores its six-bit character codes six to a word.|$|R
50|$|When {{computers}} were so costly {{that they were}} only or mainly used for science and engineering, word addressing was the obvious mode. As it became cost-effective to use computers for handling text, hardware designers moved to <b>byte</b> <b>addressing.</b>|$|R
5000|$|SCSI uses a one <b>byte</b> <b>addressing</b> {{scheme for}} {{diagnostic}} pages, {{allowing for a}} total 256 possible pages. There is a standard map of diagnostic page addresses shown below. Note that any given SCSI device type will only support a subset of these diagnostic pages.|$|R
5000|$|When {{calculating the}} size of any object type, the {{compiler}} {{must take into account}} any required data structure alignment to meet efficiency or architectural constraints. Many computer architectures do not support multiple-byte access starting at any <b>byte</b> <b>address</b> that is not a multiple of the word size, and even when the architecture allows it, usually the processor can fetch a word-aligned object faster than it can fetch an object that straddles multiple words in memory. [...] Therefore, compilers usually align data structures to at least a word boundary, and also align individual members to their respective boundaries. In the following example, the structure student is likely to be aligned on a word boundary, which is also where the member grade begins, and the member age is likely to start at the next word address. The compiler accomplishes the latter by inserting padding bytes between members as needed to satisfy the alignment requirements. There may also be padding {{at the end of a}} structure to ensure proper alignment in case the structure is used as an element of an array.|$|E

40|$|Recent 64 -bit {{microprocessors}} {{have made}} a huge 18. 4 quintillion <b>byte</b> <b>address</b> space potentially available to applications and the operating system. Because current process-oriented operating systems and their underlying page-based protection model were designed to conserve virtual addresses by reusing them, this four billion-fold increase in address space has led to investigations of alternative models.
