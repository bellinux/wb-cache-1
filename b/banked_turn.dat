5|$|At {{the start}} of the race, all the cars lined up on the grid per FIA race procedure. As Charlie Whiting signalled the green light to start the {{formation}} lap, a full field of twenty cars set off as normal for a single lap before forming the starting grid. At the <b>banked</b> <b>Turn</b> 13, the entrance to the pit lane (and the turn that was the centre of the controversy), all teams that ran Michelin tyres returned to their pits, leaving just six cars from the three Bridgestone teams (Ferrari, Jordan, and Minardi) to start the race.|$|E
5|$|Green Lantern Coaster is a steel {{roller coaster}} at Warner Bros. Movie World on the Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia.

The ride is an El Loco roller coaster {{manufactured}} by S Worldwide, characterised by a tight circuit featuring a beyond-vertical drop and an outward <b>banked</b> <b>turn.</b> It holds {{the record for the}} steepest drop of any roller coaster in the Southern Hemisphere, and the second steepest in the world. Green Lantern Coaster officially opened on 23 December 2011.|$|E
5|$|During the afternoon's {{practice}} session on Friday, June 17, 2005, Ralf Schumacher, driving for Toyota, crashed badly in Turn 13 of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway road course, apparently {{as a result}} of a left-rear tyre failure. He was unable to continue racing, and was replaced by the team's test driver, Ricardo Zonta, for the rest of the weekend. Schumacher had crashed in the same spot {{as a result of}} a tyre failure the previous year, while driving for the Williams team. Turn 13 on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway road course is a high speed <b>banked</b> <b>turn,</b> unique in Formula One racing, which causes a greater than usual tyre loading. On June 18, Michelin reported that it did not understand why the tyres it had provided for its seven customer teams– BAR, McLaren, Red Bull, Renault, Sauber, Toyota, and Williams– had failed in this turn, and announced its intention to fly in tyres of a different specification from its Clermont-Ferrand headquarters. Unfortunately, the replacement tyres flown in, which were of the type used in the Spanish Grand Prix earlier that year, turned out to have the same problem when tested.|$|E

5|$|Mercedes-Benz {{returned}} to Grand Prix racing {{at the start}} of the 1937 season with a new car. The W125 was a vast improvement on its predecessor, its supercharged eight cylinder 5.6-litre engine delivered significantly more power than the W25: 650 brake horsepower compared to 500. The first major race of 1937 was the Avusrennen where 300,000people turned out to see the cars race on the newly re-constructed track. In order to keep speeds consistently high, the north curve was turned into a steeply <b>banked</b> <b>turn,</b> apparently at the suggestion of Adolf Hitler. Driving a streamlined Mercedes-Benz, Caracciola won his heat against Rosemeyer, averaging around , although a transmission failure forced him to retire in the final. Following the AVUS race, Caracciola, along with Rosemeyer, Nuvolari and Mercedes' new driver, Richard Seaman, went to race in the revived Vanderbilt Cup in America, and in doing so missed the Belgian Grand Prix, which took place six days later. Caracciola led until lap22, when he retired with a broken supercharger.|$|E
25|$|Rhacophoridae flying frogs (gliding). A {{number of}} the Rhacophoridae, such as Wallace's flying frog (Rhacophorus nigropalmatus), have adaptations for gliding, the main feature being {{enlarged}} toe membranes. For example, the Malayan flying frog Rhacophorus prominanus glides using the membranes between the toes of its limbs, and small membranes located at the heel, {{the base of the}} leg, and the forearm. Some of the frogs are quite accomplished gliders, for example, the Chinese flying frog Rhacophorus dennysi can maneuver in the air, making two kinds of turn, either rolling into the turn (a <b>banked</b> <b>turn)</b> or yawing into the turn (a crabbed turn).|$|E

After making a slight turn to the right, the train makes a banked right turn through the loop it passes through before. Then, the train passes through a trim brake (to slow the train down) before entering a zero-gravity roll. The train then makes a <b>banked</b> <b>turn</b> to the left leading into the first of the interlocking corkscrews. After a <b>banked</b> <b>turn</b> to the right and a slight turn to the left, the train goes through the second corkscrew.

The train then travels over three small hills situated next to the lift hill followed by another turnaround. Riders then go through three more small hills and enter the final brake run.|$|E
500|$|After {{loading the}} train, riders left the station making a [...] {{left-hand}} drop {{into a series}} of short hops before turning into the [...] lift hill. At the crest of the lift hill, the track made a left-hand turn over to the first drop, where it dropped [...] to the ground followed by a 70-degree <b>banked</b> <b>turn</b> to the right. Riders then descended [...] down a second drop into a left-hand double helix. Coming out of the helix, the train passed through a mid-course brake run dropping into a straight section of track (where the vertical loop was prior to 2006), before entering another helix, riding a series of short hills. and ending at the final brake run. One cycle of the ride lasted about 2 minutes and 20 seconds.|$|E
500|$|The train exits out of {{the station}} and ascends the chain lift hill.

After going around a low-to-the-ground curve, the train enters a [...] double down followed by a [...] double up. After more turns, the train enters a small air-time hill. Outlaw Run's final two inversions are heartline rolls, turns in which the axis of rotation is approximately at the riders' hearts. The train then enters the brake run and returns to the station.
