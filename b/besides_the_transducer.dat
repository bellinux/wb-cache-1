40|$|This paper {{presents}} a wideband GaN Doherty power amplifier (DPA) in the 2. 6 GHz band with a 3 stages Wilkinson splitter where the impedance inverter {{is based on}} a tapered line instead of a quarter wave transformer. From the comparison with the same amplifier using a typical quarter-wave transformer as impedance inverter, and keeping both designs the same bandwidth (1. 6 to 3. 3 GHz, 65 % of the fractional bandwidth), the Power Added Efficiency (PAE) is enhanced up to 50 % (from 40. 46 % to 61. 17 % at 35 dBm input power) in the DPA with a tapered line. <b>Besides,</b> <b>the</b> <b>transducer</b> gain remains practically unaltered.

40|$|Implantable {{middle ear}} hearing devices (IMEHDs) have been {{developed}} as a new technology to overcome the limitations of conventional hearing aids. The piezoelectric cantilever transducers currently used in the IMEHDs have the advantages of low power consumption and ease of fabrication, but generate less high-frequency output. To address this problem, we proposed and designed a new piezoelectric transducer based on a piezoelectric stack for the IMEHD. This new transducer, attached to the incus body with a coupling rod, stimulates the ossicular chain {{in response to the}} expansion-and-contraction of its piezoelectric stack. To test its feasibility for hearing loss compensation, a bench testing of the transducer prototype and a temporal bone experiment were conducted, respectively. Bench testing results showed that the new transducer did have a broad frequency bandwidth. <b>Besides,</b> <b>the</b> <b>transducer</b> was found to have a low total harmonic distortion (< 0. 75 %) in all frequencies, and small release time (1 ms). The temporal bone experiment further proved that the transducer has the capability to produce sufficient vibrations to compensate for severe sensorineural hearing loss, especially at high frequencies. This property benefits the treatment of the most common sloping high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss. To produce a 100 dB SPL equivalent sound pressure at 1 kHz, its power consumption is 0. 49 mW, which is low enough for the transducer to be utilized in the IMEHD...|$|E
40|$|It is {{necessary}} to refine the acoustic estimation method applied in the Gulf of California, especially regarding the acoustic energy allocation to the different species coexisting in the same area, {{in order to produce}} a more precise and reliable fishery independent biomass index for the sustainable management of the fishery.

Due to similar acoustic reflectivity of other pelagic species, we need to refine the allocation of acoustic energy to species.

40|$|This thesis {{proposed}} {{a way to}} cool an ultrasound <b>transducer.</b> <b>The</b> cooling method {{is to have a}} an area on the casing of <b>the</b> <b>transducer</b> that has a high thermal conductivity, and a high emissivity. This layer is meant to passively transfer heat from the casing to the surroundings. This area on the casing is connected to <b>the</b> <b>transducer</b> stack through a copper layer that is separated for the stack by thermal paste. This cooling method was simulated using a two step method. The first step was to determine the amount of heat transferred from the highly conductive area on the casing to the surrounding, assuming constant surface temperature. The second step was to simulate the heat transfer from <b>the</b> <b>transducer</b> stack to <b>the</b> casing assuming evenly distributed constant heat generation in <b>the</b> <b>transducer</b> stack. <b>The</b> conductive casing that was simulated was a prism surrounding the sides of <b>the</b> <b>transducer</b> stack, but not the top and bottom.

40|$|In this thesis, {{the heat}} sources and heat {{transfer}} in high power, multifrequency transducers {{to be used}} for both ultrasound imaging and mediation of drug delivery, are studied. Electrical energy is converted into acoustic energy in a transducer, and in this process, due to acoustic energy absorption, some energy is also converted to thermal energy. With higher frequency, these heat sources are larger, and it can lead to overheating of <b>the</b> <b>transducer.</b> A 9 MHz probe is used in this project, and the heat sources are calculated in the program x-trans. In <b>the</b> <b>transducer,</b> we have conduction in the layers and convective heat transfer between <b>the</b> <b>transducer</b> and <b>the</b> surroundings. Radiation is neglected in the simulations. The heat transfer is simulated using the software Comsol Multiphysics. The results show that the temperature development in <b>the</b> <b>transducer</b> in <b>the</b> first 10 seconds of usage is transient or unsteady. The internal energy generation is larger than the convection rates with the surroundings. The highest temperature in <b>the</b> <b>transducer</b> is measured in the matching layers, which are on the face, with a value of 336. 8 K for <b>the</b> <b>transducer</b> used today. <b>The</b> real temperature rise, with a temperature of 381 K, happens in the load, which is the body of the patient.
