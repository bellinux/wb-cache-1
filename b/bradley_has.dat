5|$|Following a {{short-lived}} relationship with physiotherapist Justin Fuller (Ben Richards), Donna {{moves on to}} date hospital manager Bradley Hume (Scott Adkins). Their relationship is terminated by the discovery that <b>Bradley</b> <b>has</b> been running a pharmaceutical scam, resulting {{in the death of}} one of Donna's patients due to a morphine overdose. After entering into a scratchcard syndicate at work, Donna wins £20,000. She refuses to share her winnings with the others and resigns from her job, making plans to travel to Australia. On her last day, a patient with bi-polar disorder steals and re-distributes her money. Donna misses her flight, and is forced to remain in Holby. She goes on to begin an affair with consultant general surgeon Michael Spence (Hari Dhillon), despite the fact he is married. When Michael's wife Annalese (Anna-Louise Plowman) begins working at the hospital as a locum anaesthetist, she suspects that Michael has been unfaithful to her and confronts Donna, who confesses the affair and apologises profusely.|$|E

Omar <b>Bradley</b> <b>has</b> since faced serious corruption charges. Regardless of the situation, an alternative form of law enforcement was sought. Compton's policing needs are currently served by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.|$|E

At the pre-fight press conference on 4 June, Khan and García's fathers got into a heated exchange resulting in both fighters promising to knock the other out on 14 July. Khan also stated his desire to move up to the 147lbs division if successful against García, for potential bouts with high-profile boxers like Floyd Mayweather and Timothy Bradley, although <b>Bradley</b> <b>has</b> previously rejected a fight with Khan {{in order for a}} fight against Manny Pacquiao. At the time the fight was announced, WBC were unsure whether to sanction the fight, as García had a mandatory defence due against Ajose Olusegun. The fight was scheduled to take place on 14 July 2012, in Las Vegas.|$|E

[...] FCS ran from 1999 to 2009, with the Manned Ground Vehicles portion for replacing several armored vehicle classes costing [...] "hundreds of millions" [...] of dollars out of $20 billion total. [...] From 2010 to 2014, the Army spent over $1 billion on the GCV. [...] Although there was criticism that vehicle weight could not be kept at a reasonable level while meeting its size, weight, and power requirements, the Army maintains the official reason for the cancellation was budgetary pressures. [...] BAE Systems and General Dynamics will each receive $50 million in FY 2015 to continue technology development. [...] The next follow-up IFV development program is currently named the Future Fighting Vehicle (FFV).|$|E

500|$|Generally, Joseph's music gets airplay in {{the adult}} contemporary, smooth jazz, easy listening, and {{beautiful}} music radio formats, and while some is classified in the new age genre, he considers contemporary instrumental to fit his style of playing the best. [...] In discussing Rapture, John Blake of The Atlanta Journal notes that often new age music sounds as if it should be played in a supermarket. The songs can sound like musical cotton candy — soft, airy and ultimately uninteresting. [...] "For the most part, Bradley's music doesn't make that mistake." [...] "The music is cinematic, filled with introspective piano solos, swelling violins, and a hypnotic song pacing that allows the listener to daydream." [...] Along the same line, Michael Debbage of Mainly Piano says that Rapture almost single-handedly gave a sense of hope that {{there was much more}} that the New Age genre could offer. [...] Cicily Janus remarks that, [...] "Although <b>Bradley</b> <b>has</b> been, at times, pigeon holed into an offshoot of jazz, his message through his music is universal in its appeal and soothing qualities." ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{research}} for the role, Bradley observed three operations at the University College London Heart Hospital, an experience he described as [...] "amazing" [...] and a privilege to attend. Bradley's father was a doctor in Nuneaton, and he attempts to emulate him onscreen through his portrayal of Elliot. <b>Bradley</b> <b>has</b> described his first few weeks on Holby City as amongst the hardest acting experiences he has ever had, due to the medical terminology, props and procedures associated with the role.|$|E
2500|$|Clinicians {{have called}} Bradley's {{therapeutic}} intervention [...] "something disturbingly close to reparative therapy for homosexuals." [...] However, Bradley and Zucker respond that prevention of homosexuality {{was never a}} goal in their treatments and cite a lack of empirical evidence for the most effective approach. [...] Others, like author Phyllis Burke, object to any diagnosis of GID in children, considering it to be [...] "child abuse." [...] Journalist Stephanie Wilkinson said Zucker characterized Burke's book as [...] "the work of a journalist whose views shouldn't be put into the same camp as those of scientists like Richard Green or himself." [...] <b>Bradley</b> <b>has</b> argued that gender identity disorder in children is sometimes rooted in [...] serious family problems, underlying anxiety disorders or psychological trauma and might need other treatment than change of gender.|$|E
2500|$|Jim Shelly of The Mirror commented unfavourably on the [...] "horrible inevitability" [...] of Bradley's casting, {{as he had}} {{previously}} portrayed Nigel Bates in the BBC soap opera EastEnders. Shelley noted a trend for former EastEnders and Channel 4 soap Brookside actors being cast in Holby City. The show is filmed at Elstree Studios, where EastEnders is also filmed. <b>Bradley</b> <b>has</b> commented that it is [...] "strange" [...] making the same journey to a different show, and has noted differences between Elliot and his EastEnders character Nigel in that Elliot has a [...] "better wardrobe" [...] and is more intelligent. He has also commented that working on Holby City is [...] "harder" [...] than EastEnders, as the show is filmed with a single-camera set-up which takes longer, and there are [...] "more things to go wrong" [...] when working with medical props and simulating operations.|$|E

2500|$|Elliot is {{described}} on the BBC Online Holby City homepage as [...] "a disorganised genius" [...] who [...] "comes across as a bumbling eccentric" [...] but has surgical expertise which is [...] "second to none". <b>Bradley</b> <b>has</b> deemed Elliot [...] "a medical Columbo", who is [...] "shambling, untidy but good with patients and a genius medically", as well as [...] "a brilliant surgeon who does everything in an off-the-wall way." [...] He {{has been described as}} [...] "genial" [...] by The Mirror Shelley, while fellow Mirror critic Jane Simon has deemed him [...] "shambling" [...] and [...] "not the most convincing medic we've ever seen". Comparing Elliot to fellow cardiothoracic consultant Connie Beauchamp (Amanda Mealing), Bradley explained: [...] "Connie is text book brilliant, whereas Elliot is more inspired. He may seem eccentric but he really listens to his patients - he's very straight forward and not at all stuck up. They are chalk and cheese. Connie's side of the office is very neat and tidy. But Elliot's is a total mess. She's quite uptight, and anybody as relaxed as Elliot really gets on her nerves." [...] On 17 November 2006, Bradley appeared as Elliot in a Children in Need segment featuring the Holby City cast performing a version of [...] "Hung Up" [...] by Madonna.|$|E
6000|$|The way in which, as {{it seems}} to me, Hegel's system assumes the {{ordinary}} logic which it subsequently criticises, is exemplified by the general conception of [...] "categories" [...] with which he operates throughout. This conception is, I think, essentially a product of logical confusion, but it seems in some way to stand for the conception of [...] "qualities of Reality as a whole." [...] Mr <b>Bradley</b> <b>has</b> worked out a theory according to which, in all judgment, we are ascribing a predicate to Reality as a whole; and this theory is derived from Hegel. Now the traditional logic holds that every proposition ascribes a predicate to a subject, and from this it easily follows that there can be only one subject, the Absolute, for if there were two, the proposition that there were two would not ascribe a predicate to either. Thus Hegel's doctrine, that philosophical propositions must be of the form, [...] "the Absolute is such-and-such," [...] depends upon the traditional belief in the universality of the subject-predicate form. This belief, being traditional, scarcely self-conscious, and not supposed to be important, operates underground, and is assumed in arguments which, like the refutation of relations, appear at first sight such as to establish its truth. This is the most important respect in which Hegel uncritically assumes the traditional logic. Other less important respects--though important enough to be the source of such essentially Hegelian conceptions as the [...] "concrete universal" [...] and the [...] "union of identity in difference"--will be found where he explicitly deals with formal logic.[12] ...|$|E
