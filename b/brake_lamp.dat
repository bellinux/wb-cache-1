40|$|Standard {{incandescent}} <b>brake</b> <b>lamps</b> have {{a relatively}} slow rise time. It takes approximately {{a quarter of a}} second for them to reach 90 % of asymptotic light output, causing potential delays in responses by following drivers. The present study evaluated reaction times to brake signals from standard incandescent <b>brake</b> <b>lamps</b> and from three alternative <b>brake</b> <b>lamps</b> with substantially faster rise time: neon, LED, and fast incandescent. The study, performed in a laboratory, simulated a daytime driving condition. The subject’s task was to respond as quickly as possible to the onset of either of two <b>brake</b> <b>lamps</b> in the visual periphery, while engaged in a central tracking task. Brake signals were presented at two levels of luminous intensity. The results showed that reaction times to the alternative <b>brake</b> <b>lamps</b> were faster than to the standard incandescent lamp, with the advantage averaging 166 ms for the LED and neon lamps, and 135 ms for the fast incandescent lamp. A reduction of the signals’ luminous intensity from 42 cd to 5 cd increased the reaction time by 84 ms. For the neon, LED, and fast incandescent lamps all at 5 cd, the frequencies of reaction times longer than 1 s were all similar, and they were comparable to the frequency for the standard incandescent lamp at 42 cd...|$|R

40|$|This {{experiment}} {{was designed to}} compare reaction times to brake signals when they appear with red or yellow turn signals. The laboratory study simulated a daytime driving condition. The subject's task was to respond {{as quickly as possible}} to the onset of peripherally presented <b>brake</b> <b>lamps</b> (but not to turn signals), while engaged in a central tracking task. There were three <b>lamp</b> conditions: <b>brake</b> <b>lamps</b> alone, <b>brake</b> <b>lamps</b> while turn signal was on, and a turn-signal lamp alone. Thus, the subject's task required an immediate response in the first condition, a delayed response in the second (only after the <b>brake</b> <b>lamps</b> came on, not to the turn signal), and no response in the third condition. Turn signals were presented at two levels of luminous intensity. The results showed that reaction times to brake signals were significantly shorter when the brake signals were presented in the context of yellow turn signals than when they were presented in the context of red turn signals. Averaged over both levels of luminous intensity and conditions with and without turn signals, the difference between yellow and red was 110 ms. The colors of turn signals had an effect whether or not the turn signal was on, but the effect was greater when it was. Older subjects were affected more by the color of turn signals than were younger subjects. In conclusion, yellow turn signals are beneficial in situations simulated in this experiment. However, the present findings are directly applicable only to a situation where all vehicles have yellow turn signals and tail lamps are not energized...|$|R
25|$|LEDs are {{increasingly}} being adopted for signal functions such as parking <b>lamps,</b> <b>brake</b> <b>lamps</b> and turn signals as well as daytime running lamps, as in those applications they offer significant advantages over filament bulbs with fewer engineering challenges than headlamps pose.|$|R
5000|$|... 1989 {{introduced}} an extensive exterior redesign {{which included a}} longer 113.8-inch wheelbase for sedans. The [...] 4.5-liter powerplant (introduced just a year earlier), dashboard, and the front doors (on both the coupe and sedan) were about the only items that carried over — even the luggage compartment was over [...] larger than last year. The Coupe de Ville and Fleetwood coupe retained the previous year's interior, wheelbase, and doors—all cleverly hidden between the new front and rear styling. A give-away to the previous design is the rear shelf package on the 2-door models. While the parcel shelf on the four-door models received a 'Mercedes-Benz inspired' storage compartment with lid, rear seat headrest panel, and a long 3-bulb horizontal <b>brake</b> <b>lamp,</b> the 2-door models still had the narrow carpeted parcel shelf and pedestal <b>brake</b> <b>lamp</b> from the previous year. Of special note were the composite (plastic) front fenders that resisted parking-lot dings and dents, and weighed less than their steel counterparts. Previously optional equipment that was made standard for 1989 included electrically powered outside mirrors and the AM/FM/cassette player stereo. New options introduced this year included a driver's side airbag, the Bose compact disc player, an electrically heated windshield, {{and a set of}} four reversible carpeted floor mats.|$|E

50|$|In late 2000, the {{original}} facelift {{was replaced by}} a second version known as the K11C, While it still looked quite similar from the outside, the engine's had been updated to run on the newer individual coilpack system (where as the earlier models had been fitted with a distributor). As well as this, the secondary catalytic converter was removed and the primary catalytic converter (on the manifold) was enlarged. Other exterior changes included new lights on the bumper, an altered lower body, orange turn signals and minor changes to the interior. Further changes included a redesigned rear wiper which rested horizontally instead of vertically, and the centre high level <b>brake</b> <b>lamp</b> being reduced in size and mounted {{at the top of the}} rear window, instead of on the parcel shelf.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In dense fog, the {{visibility}} of a vehicle's rear lamps is of fundamental importance. However, few studies have addressed {{the visibility}} of rear fog lamps in daytime fog. The present study evaluates the contrasts of tail lamps, brake lamps and rear fog lamps. An experiment was performed in 2001 at a parking lot on Mt. Fuji Parkway in Japan. A vehicle equipped with a data-recording system {{was used as the}} data measurement station. Luminance, illuminance and transmissivity in fog were simultaneously recorded at intervals of 2 minutes. Three types of tail lamp, three types of <b>brake</b> <b>lamp</b> and two types of rear fog lamp were used, with an observation distance of 50. 0 m. The recorded data showed the background luminance in fog to be affected by illuminance and transmissivity in the daytime. A multiple regression model was applied to determine the background luminance. Contrasts were calculated using this model. Tail lamp visibility was low in deep fog in daytime. Under the same conditions, the rear fog lamps had higher visibility than both the tail lamps and the brake lamps. It was found that the rear fog lamps could provide sufficient visibility in daytime fog...|$|E

The act also gave BAR the authority to license and regulate official stations and mechanics in the areas of <b>lamp,</b> <b>brake,</b> and smog device inspection and repair. The act protects consumers by requiring all ARD's, including <b>lamp,</b> <b>brake,</b> and smog stations, to provide written estimates, to obtain written work authorization from their customers prior to commencing any repair services, and to provide customers with itemized invoices that detail the parts provided and the labor performed. The act requires BAR to mediate complaints, investigate violations, and take action against ARDs or <b>brake</b> and <b>lamp</b> stations and technicians that fail to comply with the act or associated regulations.

2500|$|Silent {{film star}} Florence Lawrence is often {{credited}} with designing the first “auto signaling arm”; a predecessor {{to the modern}} turn signal, along with the first mechanical brake signal. She did not patent these inventions, however, {{and as a result}} she received no credit for–or profit from–either one. Tail <b>lamps</b> and <b>brake</b> <b>lamps</b> were introduced around 1915, and by 1919 [...] "dip" [...] headlamps were available. The sealed beam headlamp was introduced in 1936 and standardised as the only acceptable type in the USA in 1940. Self-cancelling turn signals were developed in 1940. By 1945 headlamps and signal lamps were integrated into the body styling. Halogen headlamp light sources were developed in Europe in 1960. HID headlamps were produced starting in 1991. In 1993, the first LED tail lamps were installed on mass-production automobiles. LED headlamps were introduced {{in the first decade of}} the 21st century.|$|R
40|$|The project {{proposed}} {{a prototype of}} an adaptive car headlamps control using image processing. The adaptive headlamps system focuses on the lighting angle control of low beam in the headlamps which its light tracks moved horizontally. The controller in headlamps is based on image processing from a camera mounted on the car. Adaptive headlamps system consists of portable tiny computer of Raspberry Pi, Arduino microcontroller, and two stepper motors for {{the left and the}} right headlamps. The system was implemented on the headlamps of a Toyota Avanza car. The adaptive headlamps system could detect most types of cars ahead. It could decrease a ‘glare’ effect and increase the driver sight based on survey taken from the driver and the driver of opposite car. The system still couldn’t detect the opposite car with high intensity of light from <b>braking</b> <b>lamps,</b> as well as the light from the opposite front lamps...|$|R
