50|$|The town is {{separated}} from the open ocean by a shallow, eastward-facing bay. At its mouth, the bay is about two miles wide, with Dungarvan lying about four miles from the mouth. A meandering navigation channel marked by red/green buoys leads into Dungarvan from the ocean. For most vessels (except small dinghies) this channel is not navigable at low tide. Even at high tide, cruising yachts and larger vessels must be careful {{to remain in the}} <b>buoyed</b> <b>channel.</b> There is a well-maintained concrete slipway in Dungarvan town, suitable for launching vessels up to eight metres in length. However, larger vessels should only use it up to three hours either side of high tide. Moorings are usually made available to visiting yachts by Dungarvan Harbour Sailing Club, often free of charge.|$|E
5000|$|Novelist and screenwriter Raymond Chandler on Westport, Washington, circa 1936:An hour’s fast driving Olympia, Washington through thinned-out timber…brought me within {{sound of}} surf. The broad white road, striped with yellow down the center, swept around the flank of a hill, a distant cluster of {{buildings}} loomed {{up in front}} of the shine of the ocean, and the road forked. The left fork was posted: “Westport - 9 miles”, and didn’t go towards the buildings. It crossed a rusty cantilever bridge and plunged into a region of wind-distorted apple orchards.Twenty minutes more and I chugged into Westport, a sandy spit of land with scattered frame houses dotted over rising ground behind it. The end of the spit was a long narrow pier and the end of the pier a cluster of sailing boats with half-lowered sails flapping against their single masts. And beyond them a <b>buoyed</b> <b>channel</b> and a long irregular line where the water creamed on a hidden sandbar.Beyond the sandbar the Pacific rolled over to Japan. This was the last outpost of the coast, the farthest west a man could go and still be on the mainland of the United States...|$|E

En route she rode out a large typhoon and arriving safely Kossel Passage, 14 October 1944. In the months that followed, the ship charted and surveyed many islands in the southern Palaus, helped to establish anchorages and seaplane landing areas, and <b>buoyed</b> <b>channels.</b> She was occasionally harassed by night raids from the Japanese-held island, and on the night of 9-10 February 1945 helped destroy two swimmers approaching with an explosive raft.|$|R
60|$|Below Quebec {{there were}} awkward spots where steamers used <b>buoyed</b> <b>channels,</b> and {{if these were}} blocked by ice Davies must risk {{crossing}} the shoals. If he got across, the water was deep and he need only bother about the floes until {{he came to the}} Gulf. Since Belle Isle Strait was frozen, Davies would go South of Anticosti and out by the Cabot passage, but the Gulf was often dark with snow and fog, and one met the old Greenland ice. Well, much depended on the weather, and Cartwright went to get his lunch.|$|R
50|$|Advancing {{technology}} {{saw many}} lighthouses automated during the 1920s and 1930s {{and replaced with}} more reliable electronic beacons, something which heavily altered {{the scope of the}} Depot’s mission as much of the upkeep, maintenance and lighthouse keeper supply work it performed was severely curtailed. This tail-off of work was checked by the massive increase in the use of Floating Aids-to-Navigation, or buoys. The Staten Island Depot’s foundry became one of the key manufacturing and maintenance point for many of the buoys used along the US East Coast, its quayside spaces became a forest of ocean <b>buoys,</b> <b>channel</b> markers, ice <b>buoys,</b> day-marks and their chains, anchors and sinkers.|$|R
50|$|A {{second group}} of Scouts and Raiders, code-named Special Service Unit No. 1, was {{established}} on 7 July 1943, as a joint and combined operations force. The first mission, in September 1943, was at Finschhafen in Papua New Guinea. Later operations were at Gasmata, Arawe, Cape Gloucester, and the east and south coasts of New Britain, all without any loss of personnel. Conflicts arose over operational matters, and all non-Navy personnel were reassigned. The unit, renamed 7th Amphibious Scouts, received a new mission, to go ashore with the assault boats, <b>buoy</b> <b>channels,</b> erect markers for the incoming craft, handle casualties, take offshore soundings, clear beach obstacles and maintain voice communications linking the troops ashore, incoming boats and nearby ships.

50|$|As {{requested}} in {{a letter}} of October 16, 1861 from Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles to the Secretary of Treasury Arago was ordered to report to Flag Officer, Commanding the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron to assist with surveys supporting operations of that squadron in South Carolina waters. She proceeded to join the squadron by way of New York where she was provided additional armament at the New York Navy Yard. Arago and the steamer Vixen joined the squadron and sailed {{only to have the}} fleet scattered by a storm so that most ships had to sail independently. Vixen was first to arrive and when the fleet rejoined Arago and Vixen participated in the expedition to seize Port Royal, South Carolina. After surveys in the vicinity of Port Royal the survey personnel continued to support blockading fleet operations with surveys and <b>buoying</b> <b>channels.</b> In July 1862 Arago, with the schooner Caswell and steamer Bibb returned to New York.|$|R

50|$|Elk {{was built}} by Cook, Welton & Gemmell at Beverley, Yorkshire, {{launched}} on 21 August 1902, and first operated from Grimsby. During World War I she {{was hired by the}} Admiralty and served as a minesweeper from 1914 until 1918. She was then operated commercially under various owners at Grimsby, Hakin and Plymouth. Elk was hired by the Admiralty in November 1939 to serve as a danlayer (laying <b>buoys</b> in <b>channels</b> cleared by minesweepers) and was armed with one 6-pounder gun. HMT Elk was sunk by a mine south-east of Penlee Point off Plymouth on 27 November 1940. There were no casualties.|$|R

40|$|The buoy {{observation}} {{network in the}} East China Sea is used to assist {{the determination of the}} characteristics of tropical cyclone structure in August 2012. When super typhoon “Haikui” made landfall in northern Zhejiang province, it passed over three buoys, the East China Sea Buoy, the Sea Reef <b>Buoy,</b> and the <b>Channel</b> <b>Buoy,</b> which were located within the radii of the 13. 9 [*]m/s winds, 24. 5 [*]m/s winds, and 24. 5 [*]m/s winds, respectively. These buoy observations verified the accuracy of typhoon intensity determined by China Meteorological Administration (CMA). The East China Sea Buoy had closely observed typhoons “Bolaven” and “Tembin,” which provided real-time guidance for forecasters to better understand the typhoon structure and were also used to quantify the air-sea interface heat exchange during the passage of the storm. The buoy-measured wind and pressure time series were also used to correct the intensity of “Damrey” initially determined by CMA...|$|R
6000|$|One of Mr. Gladstone’s first {{letters to}} a {{colleague}} was addressed to Mr. Lowe, containing such hints and instructions upon treasury administration as a veteran pilot might give about lights, <b>buoys,</b> <b>channels,</b> currents, to a new captain. “No man wants so much sympathy,” he said, “as the chancellor of the exchequer, no man gets so little. Nor is there any position so lamentable for him as to be defeated in proposing some new charge on the public conceived or adopted by himself. He is like an ancient soldier wounded in the back. Whereas even defeat in resisting the raids of the House of Commons on the public purse is honourable, and always turns out well in the end.” He sent Mr. Lowe {{a list of the}} subjects that he had tried in parliament without success, and of those that he had in his head but was not able to take in hand. They make a fine example of an active and reforming mind.(243) “What commonly happened, in cases of this kind, in my time, was as follows: The opposition waited for a development of discontent and resistance among some small fraction of liberal members. When this was compact in itself, or was at all stimulated by constituencies, they sent out habitually strong party whips, and either beat me, or forced me to withdraw in order to avoid beating, or exposing our men to local disadvantage. This game, I hope, will not be quite so easy now.” ...|$|R
50|$|Although ships {{delivered}} freight {{and passengers}} to Cairns from October 1876 {{and the town}} was surveyed the same year, the harbour was not surveyed for shipping until 1878. Until then, buoys were used to guide ships from the Fairway <b>buoy</b> (marking the <b>channel</b> entrance) through the channel towards Trinity Inlet, with a lantern on shore serving as a leading light at night.|$|R
50|$|Bibb {{served the}} Union cause in many ways: {{surveying}} and <b>buoying</b> harbors and <b>channels</b> along the Atlantic {{coast of the}} Confederacy between South Carolina and Florida; escorting transports; towing and piloting gunboats; carrying dispatches; and performing any other duties that were of assistance to the Union Army and Navy.

50|$|Buoys {{serviced}} by the Papaw ranged from tiny 6 ft nun buoys to the 35 ft tall 18,000 lb Galveston Entrance <b>Channel</b> <b>Buoy.</b> Most buoys {{are equipped with}} electrical lights powered by batteries and solar cells. Some have sound signals, radar beacons, and elaborate power systems. All buoys are pulled from the water {{at least once a}} year for painting, maintenance, and position checks.|$|R
50|$|Following shakedown, Papaya joined ServRon 10 {{for duty}} in the Pacific Ocean and {{proceeded}} via Pearl Harbor to the Marshall Islands where she arrived 8 March 1944. After laying moorings and <b>channel</b> <b>buoys</b> and installing anti-torpedo nets in the Marshalls group, she departed for the Mariana Islands, arriving Saipan 1 August. She assisted in net operations while fighting on the beach was still in process, helping capture both Saipan and Tinian.|$|R
50|$|Leaving California at 12:15, {{she reached}} the side of Nevada 25 minutes later, ordered to assist in {{beaching}} the battleship and fighting her fires.

50|$|Cree {{was based}} at Pearl Harbor for towing and salvage duties {{throughout}} the Pacific until {{the outbreak of}} the Korean War. Arriving at Yokosuka on 6 July 1950, she acted as beaching control off Kyuryuhon on 16 and 17 August, transferring salvage equipment to the Korean Navy, <b>buoying</b> swept <b>channels,</b> and supporting the Inchon landings from 15 September to 15 October with salvage and towing services. Returning to Long Beach, California, 16 June for overhaul, Cree operated alternately at Pearl Harbor and in the Pacific islands and along the west coast until 4 August 1959, when she sailed for duty based on Sasebo, Japan, until 19 December. She returned to west coast operations through September 1960 when she sailed for her 1960-61 Far Eastern tour of duty.|$|R
5000|$|Through 10 August, she {{salvaged}} and repaired damaged vessels, fought fires, {{and cleared}} beachhead landing craft at Licata, Gela, Port Empedocle, Sciacca, and Marsala.
