5|$|In {{answer to}} the Prague Spring, on 20 August 1968, the Soviet Army, {{together}} with most of their Warsaw Pact allies, invaded Czechoslovakia. The invasion was followed <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>wave</b> of emigration, including an estimated 70,000 Czechs and Slovaks initially fleeing, with the total eventually reaching 300,000. The invasion sparked intense protests from Yugoslavia, Romania, China, and from Western European communist parties.|$|E

During {{the two decades}} of relative regional peace that followed, the Lý observed the threat of Song expansion, as more Han Chinese settlers moved into areas which the Lý relied upon for the extraction of natural resources. Initially, a division of Di Qing's soldiers (originally from Shandong) had settled the region, followed <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>wave</b> of Chinese settlers from north of the Yangzi River.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the 1950s, {{the most}} popular kind of country music was the Nashville Sound, which was a slick and pop-oriented style. Many musicians {{preferred}} a rougher sound, leading {{to the development of}} the Lubbock Sound and Bakersfield Sound. The Bakersfield Sound was innovated in Bakersfield, California in the mid to late 1950s, by performers like Wynn Stewart, who used elements of Western swing and rock, such as the breakbeat, along with a honky tonk vocal style. He was followed <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>wave</b> of performers like Buck Owens and Merle Haggard, who popularized the style.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the newly}} formed BJP was {{technically}} distinct from the Jana Sangh, the bulk of its rank and file were identical to its predecessor, with Vajpayee being its first president. Historian Ramachandra Guha writes that the early 1980s were marked <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>wave</b> of violence between Hindus and Muslims. The BJP initially moderated the Hindu nationalist stance of its predecessor the Jana Sangh to gain a wider appeal, emphasising its links to the Janata Party and the ideology of Gandhian Socialism. This was unsuccessful, as it won only two Lok Sabha seats in the elections of 1984. The assassination of Indira Gandhi {{a few months earlier}} resulted in a wave of support for the Congress which won a record tally of 403 seats, contributing to the low number for the BJP.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} half of the 19th century, the Ottoman Empire was swept <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>wave</b> of reforms meant to {{centralise}} and Europeanise the government of the state. Bosnian Muslim feudal lords rejected the reforms and repeatedly revolted against the Sultan. The Ottoman military intervened in the Eyalet of Bosnia in 1831 and 1850, crushing the local feudal lords, and the set of modernising reforms known as the Tanzimat began to be implemented in the province. The Christians were underprivileged in the Ottoman Empire, and this was even more so in Bosnia than in the rest of the empire. An improvement in this respect occurred in 1862, when the Bosnian Christians (Orthodox Serbs and Catholic Croats) were granted more rights, including those to open new churches and to run their own schools. This came after several uprisings by the Christians, especially Serbs, who had the strongest national movement in the province. Ivan Franjo Jukić and other Bosnian Franciscans requested the right to establish a printing house in 1847, 1850, 1853, and 1857, but each time their requests were denied by the Ottoman government.|$|E

Hidden in the chest is an orb, which glows brighter as Bok activates it, causing Picard to be hit <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>wave</b> of pain. Dr. Crusher orders him back to the Enterprise. Data meanwhile finds a discrepancy in the Stargazers logs stating that the Ferengi were attacked under a flag of truce. Upon further investigation, Data and La Forge report to Commander William Riker (Jonathan Frakes) that the logs were certainly faked. Dr. Crusher and Counselor Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis) discuss the Captain, and Wesley shows them some unusual activity from the Ferengi ship. They head to inform Riker to alert him to the signals, who is informed by the Enterprise computer that Picard has transported to the Stargazer.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} team {{then moved to}} Harlem to film a chase scene set during a procession before moving to Coney Island, where {{the cast and crew}} underwent severely cold weather conditions. The location was used to film a scene in which Angel questions a man Izzy (George Buck) about the whereabouts of Johnny Favorite, while Izzy's wife Bo (Judith Drake) stands waist deep in the ocean. The original actress who was cast as Bo was injured when she was knocked off her feet <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>wave</b> while delivering her first line. The actress refused to reshoot the scene, which led to her being replaced by her stand-in, Drake, whom Parker found to be a better actress for the role.|$|E
5|$|Mesolithic humans {{arrived in}} the Firth of the Clyde during the fourth {{millennium}} BC, probably from Ireland. This was followed <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>wave</b> of Neolithic peoples using the same route {{and there is some}} evidence that the Firth of Clyde was a significant route via which mainland Scotland was colonised at this time. A particular style of megalithic structure developed in Argyll, the Clyde estuary and elsewhere in western Scotland that has become known as the Clyde cairn. They are rectangular or trapezoidal in shape with a small enclosing chamber faced with large slabs of stone set on end and sometimes subdivided into smaller compartments. A forecourt area may have been used for displays or rituals associated with the interment of the dead, who were placed inside the chambers. They are concentrated in Arran, Bute and Kintyre and it is likely that the Clyde cairns were the earliest forms of Neolithic monument constructed by incoming settlers although few of the 100 or so examples have been given a radiocarbon dating. An example at Monamore on Arran has been dated to 3160 BC, although it was almost certainly built earlier than that, possibly c. 4000BC. There are also numerous standing stones dating from prehistoric times, including six stone circles on Machrie Moor, Arran and other examples on Great Cumbrae and Bute.|$|E

5|$|The {{influences}} between Scotland and Donegal went {{both ways}} and were furthered <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>wave</b> of immigration from Donegal to Scotland in the 19th century (the regions share common names of dances), {{as can be}} heard in the volume of strathspeys, schottisches, marches, and Donegal's own strong piping tradition, has influenced and been influenced by music, and by the sounds, ornaments, and repertoire of the Píob Mhór, the traditional bagpipes of Ireland and Scotland. There are other differences between the Donegal style and the rest of Ireland. Instruments such as the tin whistle, flute, concertina and accordion were very rare in Donegal until modern times. Traditionally the píob mór and the fiddle were the only instruments used and the use of pipe or fiddle music was common in old wedding customs. Migrant workers carried their music to Scotland and also brought back a number of tunes of Scottish origin. The Donegal fiddlers may well have been the route by which Scottish tunes such as Lucy Campbell, Tarbolton Lodge (Tarbolton) and The Flagon (The Flogging Reel), that entered the Irish repertoire. These players prided themselves on their technical abilities, which included playing in higher positions (fairly uncommon among traditional Irish fiddlers), and sought out material which would demonstrate their skills.|$|E
