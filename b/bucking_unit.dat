40|$|Premium tubular {{connections}} (sometimes {{referred to}} as rotary shouldered thread connections), are commonly used to complete a production string in a well in {{the oil and gas}} industry. These are attached to threaded pipe ends using a <b>bucking</b> <b>unit</b> and a pre-defined torque value. The torque value is calculated using the coefficient of friction between the two surfaces and a well-known torque equation. The existing technology relies on the coefficient of friction approximated by interpolation, or extrapolation, of empirical data. This may become inaccurate due to the variation of surface finish and/or operation conditions and lead to over or under torque of the connections. A failure such as a leaking connection can result in high financial implications as well as environmental ones. The project was aimed to develop a bench test which adequately represents field conditions. This benchmark test was then used to investigate how CoF was affected by changes in the main variables so that these variables can be better controlled. Therefore, a propriety laboratory test system was developed to allow measurements of friction and galling under these conditions and to examine the sensitivity of friction to initial surface topography, contact pressure, sliding speed and lubricant type. Samples were produced to represent variables which were possible within the oil and gas industry. A set of data was produced to identify the different frictional values for each combination of variables. The results showed that the initial surface topography and the burnishing in repeated sliding have significant effects on friction. iv In order to understand the correlation between the effects of initial surface roughness and burnishing during the sliding process on the coefficient of friction, a theoretical approach was taken to produce a mathematical model whichutilised the data from the laboratory testing. This gave predictions of the wear, roughness and friction with sliding distance. This data was then compared to the physical testing and found to be in line with the results. The results helped to understand how friction is related to external circumstances in the operation of premium tubular connections. Hunting Energy Service...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, the multivariable robust {{approach}} {{is used to}} obtain simple controllers for both single and current- sharing (paralleled) DC/DC converters. Linear time-invariant nominal model of the power stage is derived and asymptotic uncer-tainty bounds are constructed to cover the parametric uncertainty, nonlinear effects in control, CMC switching effects and random switching control. Robust model of the current-sharing converters is developed and joint framework for the frequency domain robust design is proposed for both single and current-sharing congurations. The fea-sibility of the {{approach is}} demonstrated by two design examples: random control of the single <b>unit</b> <b>buck</b> converter and deterministic control of the three paralleled <b>buck</b> <b>units.</b> Several robust controllers are designed and veried for robustness and perfor-mance in the closed-loop with the Matlab and pSpice models...|$|R

40|$|In this article, a mixed-mode (MM) PWM {{controller}} for dc-dc {{power converter}} topologies is presented and analysed. Compared {{to the conventional}} peak current-mode (PCM) controller, the proposed controller exhibits better results in terms of robustness towards load and reference voltage variations while maintaining better dynamic response. In the PCM controller, the control signal {{is a combination of}} inductor or, most often, switch current and a suitable compensation ramp which in the most common applications is constant. In the proposed controller, the constant compensation ramp {{has been replaced by a}} ramp voltage which is proportional to the output voltage taking into consideration the output voltage variations during load and reference transients. Consequently, the proposed controller, which exhibits the same advantages as with the PCM controller, additionally exhibits better load and reference performance for constant output voltage and output tracking applications without increasing the cost and the complexity of the control circuit. Finally, in order to verify the theoretical analysis and conclusions, both control schemes (i. e. PCM and MM) have been simulated and experimentally tested using a 75 W <b>buck</b> converter <b>unit.</b> © 2010 Taylor & Francis...|$|R
40|$|Les travaux de {{recherche}} présentés dans ce manuscrit ont été réalisés au Laboratoire Laplace (Laboratoire Plasma et Conversion d’Energie - UMR 5213) dans le cadre d'une thèse Cifre avec la société Cirtem et dans le cadre du projet Genome avec pour partenaire Airbus Helicoptère. The {{electricity is}} taking a more important place in the embedded systems. The electricity is a very moldable form of energy, easy to transport and adjustable or transformed with a very low losses. The electrical energy, associated with power converters, is easier to control than hydraulic and/or pneumatic energies for example, allowing a finer regulation and a cost cutting of maintenance. The installed power in the avionic models is growing fast. With {{the increasing number of}} electronic loads, a more electrical aircraft with an AC network would include a large number of rectifiers AC/DC which will have to respect the quality standards. A solution for the reduction of the mass would be to prefer a HVDC network (High Voltage DC BUS). On the future more electrical aircrafts, the designers will be facing a HVDC/DC power conversion. This {{is the role of the}} <b>unit</b> called BBCU (<b>Buck</b> Boost Converter <b>Unit).</b> In our case of study, a distribution network in DC voltage (± 270 Vdc) is connected to a security low-voltage network (28 Vdc) which includes a bidirectional power exchanges achieving 10 kW. The power converter for this connection gives new challenges for the power electronics in terms of reliability, safety, failure detection, efficiency and reduction of mass and cost. The design of the power converter needs to take into account for an optimal design. It is thus imperative to take into account three main factors: 1) the evolution of the power topologies 2) the evolution of the active and passive devices and 3) the power integration. The meeting of these three factors will allow the miniaturization of the power converters. At first, the adopted approach for designing power converters, taking into account the power topology, the differential filters and the cooling system are presented. The various elements which compose the power converter are described in an Object-Oriented Programming. The performance factors will be introduced to facilitate the choice of semiconductors, capacitors and heat-sinks. Secondly, the operation phases of a multicellular isolated DC/DC topology for the proposed application are presented. A discussion of the advantages of the magnetic coupling is also introduced. Thanks to the isolation, different associations of switching cells, series or/and parallel connection, are possible. Knowing the losses of power semiconductors is an essential step to design a power converter, thus two approaches are proposed: 1) a simulation model using a relatively simple model with the datasheets information; and 2) a losses measurement method which is precise and compatible with the fastest devices. As regards the magnetic components, a response surface of ferrite materials will be presented. Some models for the determination of the magnetic field inside the core and the current ripple are also described. Finally, by taking advantage of models and results obtained in the previous sections, the design and the realization of each party of the BBCU power converter 100 kHz / 10 kW is showed. A perspective of an ideal design is also presented. Sur les futurs modèles avioniques l’électricité prend une place de plus en plus importante. L’énergie électrique, associée à des convertisseurs statiques, est plus facile à maitriser que, par exemple, l’énergie hydraulique et/ou pneumatique, permettant ainsi un réglage plus fin et une simplification structurelle des avions. Dans ce cadre, les concepteurs envisageront des conversions HVDC/DC qui représentent de nouveaux défis pour l’électronique de puissance en termes de : fiabilité, rendement et réduction de masse et de coût. Dans ce cas d’étude, des routines informatiques d’optimisation associées à des modèles de pertes ont été développés pour nous orienter vers la réalisation d’un convertisseur multicellulaire DC/DC isolé à forte densité massique. Ce convertisseur a bénéficié de la mise en œuvre des nouveaux composants de puissance à large bande interdite, comme le SiC et le GaN...|$|R
