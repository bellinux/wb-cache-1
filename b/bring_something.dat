In season 3, she left the Midnight Society due to her and her family moving.|$|E
25|$|Wing was set {{to appear}} in a stage play of Adrian Mole, which would have clashed with the filming of EastEnders. Julia Smith refused to offer her any leeway and {{informed}} {{her that she had}} to take a gamble — she could either turn down the play, meaning that if she failed to get the part of Lou she would have lost two jobs, or she could give up the possibility of playing Lou and accept the play. Wing decided to turn down the play and she was subsequently given the role of Lou. An early choice in the casting process, Wing had the face, voice and attitude that Tony Holland had imagined for the character. She was told by producers to <b>bring</b> <b>something</b> from her own background to the role.|$|E

[...] Billboards David Greenwald praised the choreography and noted that Usher shows no signs of sickness as he performs the compound choreography, [...] "which ends with a forceful escape". Sam Lansky of Idolator was divided on the video and wrote that the singer [...] "could have dug a little deeper to tap into some of that very real personal pain to <b>bring</b> <b>something</b> more emotionally charged to this video; as it stands, it’s a little too polished to feel anything but contrived." ...|$|E

He and Kneale had collaborated on the play Arrow to the Heart, and worked closely on the initial storyline to make it suit the television production methods of the time. Kneale claimed to have picked his leading character's unusual last name at random from a London telephone directory. He chose the character's first name, Bernard, in honour of astronomer Bernard Lovell. The working titles for the production were The Unbegotten and <b>Bring</b> <b>Something</b> Back...!, the latter a line of dialogue in the second episode. Kneale had not finished scripting the final two episodes of the serial before the first episode was transmitted. The production had an overall budget of just under £4000. The theme music used was [...] "Mars, Bringer of War" [...] from Gustav Holst's The Planets.|$|E
500|$|Initially, Imran Khan and Ranbir Kapoor were {{supposed}} to play {{two of the three}} leads, but they declined because they wished to star together in their own production. Farhan Akhtar, Zoya's brother had worked with her in her debut film Luck By Chance, and was also the dialogue writer of the film, hence Zoya felt that he would know what she exactly wanted from the film. He was the first actor to be cast in the film. He defined his role as a [...] "fun character" [...] and a [...] "guy who for the longest time takes nothing seriously." [...] Hrithik was chosen for another lead role, since he was a favourite actor of hers. After finalizing the two, she needed someone [...] "who could not just fit in with them visually but also <b>bring</b> <b>something</b> new to the table."

Following his official installation on 8 June 2010, Nesbitt said, [...] "Rather than being just an informal role officiating at ceremonies, I think I can act as an ambassador. I have access to {{an awful lot of}} people and places because of my work. I hope to be a voice that can be heard, not just at the university, but also outside promoting the importance of the funding of education. If that involves me being at Stormont, then I'd be very happy to do that. Clearly these public spending cuts are going to have an impact and it's important to fight for funding because it's about investing in students and investing in the future of Northern Ireland. I believe I can <b>bring</b> <b>something</b> to that, otherwise I wouldn't have taken this on." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{releasing}} Stripped (2002) and {{collaborating with}} many different artists, Aguilera decided to record new old-school style materials for her upcoming album. She later {{explained that the}} lengthy break allowed her to write {{a lot about what}} she had experienced during that time. Aguilera also explained that she wanted to <b>bring</b> <b>something</b> novel to her album, which has 24 songs on it. She wanted to try to evolve as an artist and a visionary. As a result, Back to Basics, Aguilera's fifth studio album, is made up of two discs. On the first disc, she worked with [...] "more beat-driven" [...] producers, such as DJ Premier and Mark Ronson, who included samples in the production. The second one was written and produced solely by longtime producer Linda Perry. Aguilera sent letters to different producers that she hoped could help her with the direction she was taking for the project, encouraging them to experiment, re-invent and create a modern soul feel. She described the first disc as [...] "kind of a throwback with elements of jazz, blues and soul music combined with a modern-day twist, like hard-hitting beats".|$|E

He attended Osborn High School, and lived with his grandmother in New York during summers. He studied piano, guitar, and trombone in high school, and listened to artists such as Sugar Hill Gang, Run-DMC, Ozzy Osbourne and Kiss. Esham began to write original lyrics, and was encouraged by his older brother, James H. Smith, to seriously pursue a career in hip hop. According to Esham, [...] "He felt like I had a dope flow, and he thought I could <b>bring</b> <b>something</b> new to the game, just coming from the city of Detroit. Back then, it wasn't really a [...] music scene in Detroit. Everybody was just imitating what everybody else was doing." [...] In the second grade, Esham met Champtown, who was also an aspiring rapper. The two performed together at open mic events Seafood Bay. In one occurrence, Champtown and Esham were forced to rap for a drug dealer at gunpoint.|$|E
500|$|Reflecting on the serial, Nigel Kneale said, [...] "Frankly, I {{was never}} {{happy with the}} whole idea in the first place. The central idea was too ordinary". Although Kneale {{was pleased with the}} high {{production}} values, he was dissatisfied with the casting, believing that John Mills [...] "didn't have the authority for Quatermass". He was similarly unimpressed with Simon MacCorkindale, noting that [...] "We had him in Beasts playing an idiot and he was very good at that". Kneale disliked the depiction of the Planet People, as his inspiration had been angry punks rather than hippies (as evidenced by his portrayal of Kickalong as a gun-toting lunatic who commits multiple motiveless murders). Producer Ted Childs thinks that [...] "the primary problems with it were (a) it was perhaps too depressing a story for a popular television audience and (b) the punters were used to a fairly high standard of technical presentation from American television... And we just couldn't afford that". Executive producer Verity Lambert's opinion is that it [...] "didn't have the staying power of the originals, but then that's almost inevitable when you try to <b>bring</b> <b>something</b> back in a slightly different form".|$|E

500|$|Windsor's final episode on 10 September 2010 did not {{end with}} the usual EastEnders theme tune. Instead the {{occasionally}} used [...] "Julia's Theme", a piano version of the theme, was reworked specially for the broadcast, and given the name [...] "Peggy's Theme". The theme {{was created by the}} original theme tune composer, Simon May, who was reportedly thrilled to write the theme tune for Windsor. He added more piano to the theme and gave it a [...] "more melancholy feel". May composed the theme not knowing what would happen on screen, but when Kirkwood brought a rough edit of the episode, May noted that the music fitted perfectly first time, saying it was [...] "remarkable and very moving." [...] The theme features as the lead track on the album The Simon May Collection and was also released as an EP available to download immediately after the episode. He revealed: [...] "All the actors and crew had made a really special couple of shows. My main purpose was to <b>bring</b> <b>something</b> to the table, and I didn't {{think it would be a}} single.

Phil and Grant were in the show together for at least 10years, and they were fantastic– so to be linked to them is phenomenal. It really is a lot to live up to, but Tony and I are hoping to come in with out own energy and <b>bring</b> <b>something</b> completely new to EastEnders. Rachel Tarley from the Metro said [...] "it's nice to have a bit of fresh blood in the soap, especially since the appearance of another one of his siblings always seems to leave Michael a little more demented than he was before. Lapinskas revealed to the Daily Mirror that because of his role in EastEnders, he is recognised in public, calling the experience [...] "surreal". Cecile Metcalf of the Daily Mail branded Anthony [...] "the loveable rogue of the square, with a cheeky answer for everything".|$|E
