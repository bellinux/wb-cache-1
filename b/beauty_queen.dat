5|$|In 1929, Hammond married Dorothy Lister, the {{daughter}} of a Yorkshire textile merchant, in a highly publicised ceremony at a parish church in Bingley. They met at a cricket match in 1927 but spent little time together before the wedding, having little in common. When married, they rarely communicated or got on well. Acquaintances believed Hammond treated her badly, particularly once her father lost nearly everything in the Depression, causing them financial worry. She remained loyal, but their relations gradually broke down, even after she sailed to South Africa, joining Hammond on tour in 1939 in an attempt to save the marriage. By that time, he was already seeing his future second wife, Sybil Ness-Harvey, a former <b>beauty</b> <b>queen</b> whom he had met while on tour.|$|E
5|$|In late 2002, Miller {{divorced}} {{his wife}} Peg, {{with whom he}} had four sons. He did so to marry his long-term mistress Marie Challman, {{with whom he had}} been living since 1999.

He had other long-term mistresses, including an Australian <b>beauty</b> <b>queen</b> with whom he was photographed in public. During his later years, his illness contributed to what his family felt was a deteriorating attitude and he fell out with his sons, but they were reconciled shortly before his death.|$|E
