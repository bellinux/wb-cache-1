5000|$|Suppose that Carr <b>is</b> <b>out.</b> If Carr <b>is</b> <b>out,</b> then if Allen <b>is</b> also <b>out</b> Brown {{would have}} to be in, since someone must be in the shop for it to be open. However, we know that {{whenever}} Allen goes out he takes Brown with him, and thus we know as a general rule that if Allen <b>is</b> <b>out,</b> Brown <b>is</b> <b>out.</b> So if Carr <b>is</b> <b>out</b> then the statements [...] "if Allen <b>is</b> <b>out</b> then Brown <b>is</b> in" [...] and [...] "if Allen <b>is</b> <b>out</b> then Brown <b>is</b> out" [...] would both be true at the same time.|$|R

5|$|Bolton manager Sam Allardyce, who was {{building}} a reputation for signing unwanted foreign veterans such as N'Gotty, Djorkaeff and Iván Campo, predicted that a win would help him sign more players in the summer.

5000|$|However, {{the correct}} {{conclusion}} {{to draw from}} the incompatibility of the two [...] "hypotheticals" [...] is that what is hypothesised in them (that Allen <b>is</b> <b>out)</b> must <b>be</b> false under our assumption that Carr <b>is</b> <b>out.</b> Then our logic simply allows us {{to arrive at the}} conclusion [...] "If Carr <b>is</b> <b>out,</b> then Allen must necessarily be in".|$|R

5|$|A batsman can <b>be</b> <b>out</b> lbw even if {{the ball}} did not hit his leg: for example, a batsman struck on the head could be lbw. However, he cannot be lbw if the ball pitches on the leg side of the stumps ("outside leg stump"), {{even if the}} ball would have {{otherwise}} hit the wickets. Similarly, a batsman who has attempted {{to hit the ball}} with his bat cannot be lbw if the ball strikes him outside the line of off stump. However, some shots in cricket, such as the switch hit or reverse sweep, involve the batsman switching between a right- and left-handed stance; this affects the location of the off and leg side, which are determined by the stance. The law explicitly states that the off side is determined by the batsman's position when the bowler commences his run-up.|$|E

5|$|After {{considerable}} {{debate and}} various experiments, {{the law was}} changed again in 1972. In an attempt to reduce pad-play the new version, {{which is used to}} this day, allowed batsmen to <b>be</b> <b>out</b> lbw in some circumstances if they did not attempt to hit the ball with their bat. Since the 1990s, the availability of television replays and, later, ball-tracking technology to assist umpires has increased the percentage of lbws in major matches. However, the accuracy of the technology and the consequences of its use remain controversial.|$|E
5|$|Against Osasuna on 17 September 2011, Villa contributed {{two goals}} and forced Rovérsio into scoring an own goal in Barcelona's 8–0 {{win over the}} team from Pamplona.

A ball must completely cross a boundary line to <b>be</b> <b>out</b> of play, and a ball must wholly cross the goal line before a goal is scored.|$|E

5|$|At both Portsmouth and Cirencester, Hammond {{excelled at}} sports {{including}} cricket (playing for the Portsmouth Grammar School second eleven), football and fives. At Cirencester, he played football {{for the school}} first eleven in his first term. He quickly reached the school cricket first eleven, where he outperformed the other players and became captain in his second season; his headmaster, quickly spotting his potential, encouraged him. His first century was scored in a match against a parents' team from the school. In an inter-house match, he scored 365 not out, albeit against very weak bowling. These achievements brought him some local acclaim. Hammond enjoyed less success in the classroom; his marks were usually low, and he preferred to <b>be</b> <b>out</b> playing cricket.|$|E
