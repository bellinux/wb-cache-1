IGN's Ramsey Isler rated the episode 9.2/10, writing that it [...] "is {{a classic example}} of a story you have to <b>be</b> <b>patient</b> <b>with.</b> This was an episode with a compelling, {{shocking}} start that kept us hooked well enough to deal with some slow points {{in the rest of the}} first half-hour.

On January 11, 1909, Alexandra admonished thirteen-year-old Olga for rudeness and bad behavior. She told the teenager that she must be polite to the servants, who looked after her well and did their best for her, and she should not make her nurse [...] "nervous" [...] when she was tired and not feeling well. Olga responded on January 12, 1909 that she would try to do better but it wasn't easy because her nurse became angry and cross with her for no good reason. However, Ersberg, one of the maids, told her niece that the servants sometimes {{had good reason to}} be cross with Olga because the eldest grand duchess could be spoiled, capricious, and lazy. On January 24, 1909, Alexandra scolded the active teenager, who once signed another of her letters with the nickname [...] "Unmounted Cossack", again: [...] "You are growing very big — don't be so wild and kick about and show your legs, it is not pretty.

40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} was to assess {{influence}} {{of different types of}} partial dentures on dental plaque accumulation. The study was conducted in three experimental and one control group with 30 examinees each. In the first experimental group <b>were</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> partial acrylic dentures, in the second <b>were</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> overdentures and in the third group <b>were</b> the <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> metal skeletal dentures.

Dental plaque scores were obtained at a time when dentures <b>were</b> given to <b>patients</b> and after 6 and 12 months of wearing, respectively. The plaque index of all teeth after 12 months of wearing dentures was relatively low in all three examined groups which resulted from previous education and motivation of examinees for oral hygiene maintenance. However, the highest risk of oral diseases caused by dental plaque <b>is</b> in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> partial acrylic dentures, then in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> overdentures, and best preventive effect <b>was</b> achieved in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> metal skeletal dentures...|$|R

He was shown to be distracted at the loss Sita (in [...] "Koṭhe Sītā Janakanandinī?"), and wailed in Lakshmana's presence (in [...] "Hī Ticyā Veṇitil Phule"). In another situation, he uttered some heart-wrenching words to Sita, in front of his army with blaming her for all the happenings (in [...] "Līnate, Cārūte, Sīte"), and then he was also shown to explain his behavior with oaths and confessions of loyalty to Sita (in [...] "Lokasākṣa Shuddhī Jhālī").|$|E
500|$|Before the 2007 season, Baseball America rated Humber as the fourth-best {{prospect}} in the Mets organization. That year, the Mets {{had nine}} pitchers competing for five {{spots in the}} starting rotation in spring training camp. Óliver Pérez, Tom Glavine, Orlando Hernández, and John Maine were the favorites for the spots in the rotation. Veterans Aaron Sele, Chan Ho Park and Jorge Sosa were also invited to camp so that the team could <b>be</b> <b>patient</b> <b>with</b> former first round draft choices Humber and Mike Pelfrey, who were considered the most promising pitchers in camp. Rated the 73rd-best prospect in baseball by Baseball America prior to the 2007 season, Humber competed for {{a spot on the}} Mets roster in spring training. However, Humber was optioned to the minor leagues during spring training in 2007. Assigned to the New Orleans Zephyrs of the Class-AAA Pacific Coast League (PCL), Humber had an 11–9 win–loss record and 4.27 ERA in 139 innings pitched. He allowed 129 hits and walked 44 while striking out 120 batters in 25 starts. For the season, Humber finished tied for fourth in the PCL in wins and had the tenth-best ERA. He had started the season by earning the PCL Pitcher of the week for the week ending April 22. [...] That week he allowed 2 earned runs in 13 innings of work over two starts, earning a win on April 16 against the Nashville Sounds with six innings of work and suffering a blown save after seven innings against the Albuquerque Isotopes on April 21. He flirted with a no-hitter with the Zephyrs on August 22 when he entered the ninth inning without giving up a hit to the Iowa Cubs. In his subsequent start, he allowed only an unearned run on two hits over five innings, but he was removed from the game when a batted ball hit him in the shoulder.|$|E

2500|$|Muslim history {{involves}} {{the history of}} the Islamic faith as a religion and as a social institution. The history of Islam began in the Arabian Peninsula when the Islamic prophet Muhammad allegedly received the first revelation of the Quran in the 7th century in the cave of Hira in the month of Ramadan. According to tradition, he was supposedly commanded by Allah to convey this message to the people, and to <b>be</b> <b>patient</b> <b>with</b> those hostile to it. These included the leaders of the Quraysh, the ruling tribe of Mecca, who opposed the assertion of tawhid (monotheism) and abolishing what Muhammed branded [...] "idolatry", meaning the worship of gods other than Allah at the Kaaba, such as Hubal and the goddesses al-Lāt, Al-‘Uzzá and Manāt. After 13 years of spreading this message, despite increased persecution by the Quraysh, Muhammad and his followers migrated to Medina to establish a new state under the prophet's leadership and away from persecution. This migration, called the Hijra, marks {{the first year of the}} Islamic calendar. Islam was then spread to other parts of the Arabian Peninsula over the course of Muhammad's life.|$|E
