While using the new Eight-Foot High-Speed Tunnel, a wind tunnel with performance up to Mach 0.95 at NACA's Langley Research Center, he {{was surprised by the}} increase in drag due to shock wave formation. Whitcomb realized that, for analytical purposes, an airplane could be reduced to a streamlined <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>revolution,</b> elongated as much as possible to mitigate abrupt discontinuities and, hence, equally abrupt drag rise.

40|$|A method {{based on}} linearized and slender-body theories, which is easily adapted to electronic-machine {{computing}} equipment, is developed for calculating the zero-lift wave drag of single- and multiple-component configurations from {{a knowledge of}} the second derivative of the area distribution of a series <b>of</b> equivalent <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> <b>revolution.</b> The accuracy and computational time required of the method to calculate zero-lift wave drag is evaluated relative to another numerical method which employs the Tchebichef form of harmonic analysis of the area distribution of a series <b>of</b> equivalent <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> <b>revolution.</b> The results <b>of</b> the evaluation indicate that the total zero-lift wave drag of a multiple-component configuration can generally be calculated most accurately as the sum of the zero-lift wave drag of each component alone plus the zero-lift interference wave drag between all pairs of components. The accuracy and computational time required of both methods to calculate total zero-lift wave drag at supersonic Mach numbers is comparable for airplane-type configurations. For systems <b>of</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> <b>revolution</b> both methods yield similar results with comparable accuracy; however, the present method only requires up to 60 percent of the computing time required of the harmonic-analysis method for two <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> <b>revolution</b> and less time for a larger number <b>of</b> <b>bodies...</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{have set}} {{ourselves}} {{the problem of}} calculating the laminar flow on a <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>revolution</b> in an axial flow which simultaneously rotates about its axis. The problem mentioned above, the flow about a rotating disk in a flow, which we solved some time ago, represents {{the first step in}} the calculation of the flow on the rotating <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>revolution</b> in a flow insofar as, in the case of a round nose, a small region about the front stagnation point of the <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>revolution</b> may be replaced by its tangential plane. In our problem regarding the rotating <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>revolution</b> in a flow, for laminar flow, one of the limiting cases is known: that of the body which is in an axial approach flow but does not rotate. The other limiting case, namely the flow in the neighborhood of a body which rotates but is not subjected to a flow is known only for the rotating circular cylinder, aside from the rotating disk. In the case of the cylinder one deals with a distribution of the circumferential velocity according to the law v = omega R(exp 2) /r where R signifies the cylinder radius, r the distance from the center, and omega the angular velocity of the rotation. The velocity distribution as it is produced here by the friction effect is therefore the same as in the neighborhood of a potential vortex. When we treat, in what follows, the general case of the rotating <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>revolution</b> in a flow according to the calculation methods of Prandtl's boundary-layer theory, we must keep in mind that this solution cannot contain the limiting case of the <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>revolution</b> which only rotates but is not subjected to a flow.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} primarily with {{the application of}} the "area rule" to the interpretation and improvement of the drag-rise characteristics of wing-body combinations at transonic and moderate supersonic speeds. Consideration of the general physical nature of the flow at transonic speeds, together with comparisons of the flow fields and drag-rise characteristics for wing-body combinations and bodies of revolution has led to the conclusion that near the speed of sound the drag rise for a thin low-aspect-ratio wing-body combination is primarily dependent on the axial distribution of cross-sectional area normal to the airstream (ref. 1). (The drag rise, sometimes referred to as pressure drag, is the difference between the drag level near the speed of sound and the drag level at subsonic speeds where the drag is due primarily to skin friction.) In order to illustrate the concept, figure 1 shows a wing-body combination and a <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>revolution.</b> A typical cross section normal to the airstream for the wing-body combination is shown at AA. The cross-sectional area of the wing is wrapped around the <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>revolution</b> so that the body has the same cross-sectional area at BB. All the other cross-sectional areas of the <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>revolution</b> are the same as those for the wing-body combination at the same axial stations.

40|$|An {{analysis}} {{is made of}} the effects of compressibility on the pressure coefficients about several <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> <b>revolution</b> by comparing experimentally determined pressure coefficients with corresponding pressure coefficients calculated by the use of the linearized equations of compressible flow.

Extrapolation of the linearized subsonic theory into the mixed subsonic-supersonic flow region fails to predict a rearward movement of the negative pressure-coefficient peak which occurs after the critical stream Mach number has been attained.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{study of}} steady transonic flows about axisymmetric and 3 -D elongate bodies {{has been carried}} out within the framework of non-linear small disturbance theory using the transonic equivalence rule. A numerical method for calculating transonic flow about <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> <b>revolution</b> was used by formulating the Alterating Direction Method together with monotone Engquist-Osher’s algorithm for the axisymmetric case.
