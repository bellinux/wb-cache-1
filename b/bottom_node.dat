One of the important brain fissures, which are frequently performed retractions, is the the Sylvian fissure. The Sylvian fissure {{is filled with the}} arachnoid mater, which needs to be dissected by surgeons. This section shows the result of a brain retraction simulation conducted in real-time by user input using a Sensable Phantom Omni haptic device.

The task objective given to the user is to retract the brain tissues and expose the brain tumor existing {{at the bottom of the}} Sylvian fissure. A brain hemisphere mesh model (8647 nodes, 32, 639 elements) was used in this simulation.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{controlling the}} partitioning of seed composition constituents {{along the main}} stem in soybean are still controversial.

The cultivars were DT 97 - 4290, maturity group (MG) IV; Stressland, MG IV; Hutcheson, MG V; TracyM, MG VI. Seeds were harvested based on position on the plant (top nodes, middle nodes, and bottom nodes). At R 8 (physiological maturity stage), DT 97 - 4290, Hutcheson, and Stressland had higher percentage of protein and oleic acid and lower percentage of oil and linolenic acid in top node seed compared with <b>bottom</b> <b>node</b> seed. The increase of protein in top node compared with the <b>bottom</b> <b>node</b> across the two experiments ranged from 15. 5 to 19. 5 %, 7. 0 to 10. 5 %, 14. 2 to 15. 8 %, 11. 2 to 16. 5 %, respectively for DT 97 - 4290, Hutcheson, Stressland, and TracyM. Except for TracyM, the increase of oleic acid in the top node ranged from 45. 4 to 93 %, depending on the cultivar. Conversely, the decrease in the top node seed ranged from 14. 4 to 26. 8 % for oil and from 5. 7 to 34. 4 % for linolenic acid, depending on the cultivar. The partitioning trend of seed composition constituents at R 6 (seed - fill stage) was inconsistent. Except for Stressland, seed oleic acid was higher at R 6 than at R 8. The higher protein and oleic acid concentrations in the top node seed was accom- panied by higher activity of nitrate reductase activity, higher chlorophyll concentration, higher nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) percentages in the fully expanded leaves at R 5 -R 6 growth stage, and higher seed nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) percentages in DT 97 - 4290 and Stressland. The current research suggests that the partitioning of seed protein, oil, and fatty acids in nodes along the plant depended on the position of node on the main stem, cultivar differences, seed N and S status, and tissue N and S partitioning. The higher nitrate reductase activity at the top nodes, accompanied higher protein and oleic acid, and the changes of oleic acid at R 6 and R 8 along the stem, were not previously reported, and need further investigation. The current knowledge is useful for soybean germplasm selection for desirable traits such protein and oleic acid, and for accurate measurements of seed composition constituents in breeding lines...|$|E

We also provide an approximate expression for the case when more than one edge are added in a time step. We show that depending on the relative weight between random and preferential attachment, the degree-distribution of this type of network falls into one of four possible regimes which range from a binomial distribution for pure random attachment to an u-shaped distribution for dominant preferential attachment.

It requires that a maximum number of patterns are specified and for that number to be slightly higher than the number of desired clusters. Zhang et al. [19] model pedestrians' and vehicles' trajectories as graph nodes and apply a graph-cut algorithm to group the motion patterns together. These approaches are well suited for graph theory techniques which make binary divisions (such as max-flow and min-cut). In addition, the multiresolution clustering allows a clever choice of the number of clusters. The drawback is the quality of the clusters which is dependent on the decision of how to split (merge) a set that is not generally reflected along the tree.|$|R
50|$|All {{representations}} {{of a system}} are {{defined in terms of}} a function map (FMap) and a type map (TMap). With USL, all functions in a system and their relationships are defined with a set of FMaps. Similarly, all types in a system and their relationships are defined with a set of TMaps. FMaps represent the dynamic (doing) world of action by capturing functional and temporal (including priority) characteristics. TMaps represent the static (being) world of objects by capturing spatial characteristics - for example, containment of one object by another or relationships between locations of objects in space. FMaps are inherently integrated with TMaps. Three universal primitive structures derived from the set of axioms and non-primitive structures derived ultimately in terms of the primitive structures specify each map. Primitive structures are universal in that they are able to be used to derive new abstract universal structures, functions or types. The process of deriving new objects (i.e., structures, types and functions) is equivalent to the process of deriving new types in a constructive type theory. Primitive functions, corresponding to primitive operations on types defined in a TMap, reside at the <b>bottom</b> <b>nodes</b> of an FMap. Primitive types, each defined by its own set of axioms, reside at the <b>bottom</b> <b>nodes</b> of a TMap. Each primitive function (or type) can be realized as a top node of a map on a lower (more concrete) layer of the system. Resident at every node on a map is the same kind of object (for example, a function on every node of an FMap and a type on a TMap). The object at each node plays multiple roles; for example, the object can serve as a parent (in control of its children) or a child (being controlled by its parent). Whereas each function on an FMap has a mapping from its input to output (domain to codomain), each type on a TMap has a relation between its domain and codomain. A structure relates each parent and its children according to the set of rules derived from the axioms of control. A primitive structure provides a relationship of the most primitive form (finest grain) of control. All maps are defined ultimately in terms of the primitive structures and therefore abide by the rules associated with each structure: A parent controls its children to have a dependent (Join), independent (Include), or decision-making relationship (Or).|$|R

Understanding these factors may justify selection for higher levels of seed phenolics because of their beneficial impact on human health and soybean defense mechanism against diseases. The objective {{of this research was}} to investigate the partitioning of seed phenolics (phenol, lignin, and isoflavones) along the main stem of soybean genotypes. A repeated green- house experiment was conducted on different soybean genotypes of different maturity and different stem archi-tecture (determinate and indeterminate). Genotypes were DT 97 - 4290, maturity group (MG) IV; Stressland, MG IV; Hutcheson, MG V; and Tracy-M, MG VI. Seed were harvested from top and <b>bottom</b> <b>nodes</b> at seed-fill stage (R 6) and harvest ma- turity stage (R 8). At R 6, seed phenolic compounds (phenol, lignin, and isoflavones daidzein, genistein, and glycitein) were greater in the bottom seed than the top seed. This trend was observed in DT 97 - 4290, Tracy-M, and Hutcheson, but not in Stressland. Also, this trend was more obvious with daidzein and genistein isoflavones than glycitein. The maximum phenolic compounds were recorded at R 8. The higher phenolic compounds concentration in bottom seed than in top seed was accompanied by higher cell wall boron (B) percentage and lower total B in bottom seed. The current research demonstrated that phenolic compounds partitioned differently between the top and <b>bottom</b> seed <b>nodes.</b> This trend cannot be generalized in soybean genotypes unless enough germplasm is tested. The partitioning of higher phenolic compounds concentration along the main stem would allow for single seed selection in the breeding program for higher levels of phenolic compounds and for accurate measurements of seed phenolics in breeding lines. The associa- tion of B trend with phenolic compound trend may suggest B involvement in phenolic metabolism, and support the structural role of B.

30|$|Robust tree {{overlays}} are {{a flexible}} methodology to compute {{a wide range}} of aggregates but require topology self-management (Pournaras et al. 2010) in decentralized environments. Communication and storage complexity can be higher than the aggregation itself. Performing a relevant evaluation and comparison of aggregation trees with other more dedicated to aggregation mechanisms, such as DIAS, requires a use-case context and a specific application scenario. If tree topologies are reused between different distributed applications, including aggregation, the allocated cost is shared between these applications something that makes the use of trees more effective Fei et al. 2001. The unique paths of tree topologies are not required in DIAS as unique aggregation values are identified by the classification in the middle level. Furthermore, tree aggregation suffers from an unequal load distribution in nodes and the impact of failures (Ogston and Jarvis 2010). The nodes close to the root receive a high number of forwarded messages from the <b>bottom</b> <b>nodes.</b> Similarly, the impact of a failure close to the leaves is small whereas a single failure close to the root partitions the overlay network. These issues do not concern DIAS as it does not depend on a specific interaction mechanism.

The equipment typically comprises up to 4000 receivers depending on the aerial extent of the reservoir. Multicomponent receiver technology like Ocean Bottom Cable (OBC), borehole tools or Ocean <b>Bottom</b> <b>Nodes</b> (OBN) provides information on both pressure and particle velocity recorded with three component accelerometers or geophones and an omnidirectional hydrophone at the seafloor level, allowing complementary PP and PS imaging.

This thesis is focusing on several aspects of receiver coupling to the seafloor by presenting two developed methods on how to measure coupling and how to estimate receiver performance or vector fidelity (paper 1 and 2).

We also observe that the receiving antennas that are lying centrally have the smallest position estimation errors. This is due to the increased diversity of the source signals. We find an average position estimation error of 2.1 m, with a minimum error of 0.4 m, a maximum error of 3.36 m, and a standard deviation of 0.92 m.|$|R
