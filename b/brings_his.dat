5|$|As in {{plot and}} setting, Tolkien <b>brings</b> <b>his</b> {{literary}} theories {{to bear in}} forming characters and their interactions. He portrays Bilbo as a modern anachronism exploring an essentially antique world. Bilbo is able to negotiate and interact within this antique world because language and tradition make connections between the two worlds. For example, Gollum's riddles are taken from old historical sources, while those of Bilbo come from modern nursery books. It is {{the form of the}} riddle game, familiar to both, which allows Gollum and Bilbo to engage each other, rather than the content of the riddles themselves. This idea of a superficial contrast between characters' individual linguistic style, tone and sphere of interest, leading {{to an understanding of the}} deeper unity between the ancient and modern, is a recurring theme in The Hobbit.|$|E

When the earl and his troops have fully prepared themselves, the saga states that Ölvir's forces made their attack.|$|E
