40|$|Purinergic P 2 X and P 2 Y receptors are broadly {{expressed}} on both neurons and glial {{cells in}} {{the central nervous system}} (CNS), including dentate gyrus (DG). The aim of this research was to determine the synaptic and proliferative response of the DG to severe oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) in acute rat hippocampal slices and to investigate the contribution of P 2 X 7 and P 2 Y 1 receptor antagonism to recovery of synaptic activity after OGD. Extracellular field excitatory post-synaptic potentials (fEPSPs) in granule cells of the DG were recorded from rat hippocampal slices. Nine-min OGD elicited an irreversible loss of fEPSP and was invariably followed by the appearance of anoxic depolarization (AD). Application of MRS 2179 (selective antagonist of P 2 Y 1 receptor) and BBG (selective antagonist of P 2 X 7 receptor), before and during OGD, prevented AD appearance and allowed a significant recovery of neurotransmission after 9 -min OGD. The effects of 9 -min OGD on proliferation and maturation of cells localized in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of slices prepared from rats treated with 5 -Bromo- 2 '-deoxyuridine (BrdU) were investigated. Slices were further incubated with an immature neuron marker, doublecortin (DCX). The number of BrdU+ {{cells in the}} SGZ was significantly decreased 6 hours after OGD. This effect was antagonized by BBG, <b>but</b> not by <b>MRS</b> 2179. Twenty-four hours after 9 -min OGD, the number of BrdU+ cells returned to control values and a significant increase of DCX immunofluorescence was observed. This phenomenon was still evident when BBG, <b>but</b> not <b>MRS</b> 2179, was applied during OGD. Furthermore, the P 2 Y 1 antagonist reduced the number of BrdU+ cells at this time. The data demonstrate that P 2 X 7 and P 2 Y 1 activation contributes to early damage induced by OGD in the DG. At later stages after the insult, P 2 Y 1 receptors might play an additional and different role in promoting cell proliferation and maturation in the DG...|$|R
40|$|Aims UDP-sugars {{can act as}} {{extracellular}} signalling molecules, {{but relatively}} {{little is known about}} their cardiovascular actions. The P 2 Y 14 receptor is a Gi/o-coupled receptor which is activated by UDP-glucose and related sugar nucleotides. In this study we sought to investigate whether P 2 Y 14 receptors are functionally expressed in the porcine coronary artery using a selective P 2 Y 14 receptor agonist, MRS 2690, and a novel selective P 2 Y 14 receptor antagonist, PPTN (4, 7 -disubstituted naphthoic acid derivative). Methods and results Isometric tension recordings were used to evaluate the effects of UDP-sugars in porcine isolated coronary artery segments. The effects of the P 2 receptor antagonists suramin and PPADS, the P 2 Y 14 receptor antagonist PPTN, and the P 2 Y 6 receptor antagonist MRS 2578, were investigated. Measurement of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) phosphorylation using flow cytometry was used to assess changes in cAMP levels. UDP-glucose, UDP-glucuronic acid UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (P 2 Y 14 receptor agonists), elicited concentration-dependent contractions in the porcine coronary artery. MRS 2690 was a more potent vasoconstrictor than the UDP-sugars. Concentration dependent contractile responses to MRS 2690 and UDP-sugars were enhanced in the presence of forskolin (activator of cAMP), where the level of basal tone was maintained by addition of U 46619, a thromboxane A 2 mimetic. Contractile responses to MRS 2690 were blocked by PPTN, <b>but</b> not by <b>MRS</b> 2578. Contractile responses to UDP-glucose were also attenuated by PPTN and suramin, <b>but</b> not by <b>MRS</b> 2578. Forskolin-induced VASP-phosphorylation was reduced in porcine coronary arteries exposed to UDP-glucose and MRS 2690, consistent with P 2 Y 14 receptor coupling to Gi/o proteins and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity. Conclusions Our data support a role of UDP-sugars as extracellular signalling molecules and show {{for the first time that}} they mediate contraction of porcine coronary arteries via P 2 Y 14 receptors...|$|R

40|$|The {{sensitivity}} is a {{main problem}} for NMR experiments {{and it is}} laid down by the thermal noise of the receiver coil and its geometry.

In this paper we propose a realistic transducer model of an NMR coil and a reliable method to model an LNA. We introduce the requirements to achieve a low noise matching network for NMR receivers allowing an improvement of the sensitivity of the coil by a factor of 6. This sensitivity improvement has its interest in MRI by increasing the field of view with a higher SNR <b>but</b> also in <b>MRS</b> by reducing the limit of detection...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The SAINT I {{trial that}} showed a {{significant}} benefit of the neuroprotectant NXY- 059 used a novel outcome for acute ischemic stroke trials: a shift toward good functional outcome on the 7 -category modified Rankin scale (mRS). METHODS: We used the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel shift test to analyze {{the distribution of the}} 90 -day mRS outcomes in the NINDS and ECASS-II databases and compared the results with a dichotomized mRS outcome by logistic regression (0 to 2 vs 3 to 6, or 0 to 1 vs 2 to 6). We also stratified each dataset based on National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale baseline severity. RESULTS: Each dataset showed a statistically significant shift in the 90 -day mRS distributions favoring tissue plasminogen activator (odds ratio, 1. 6 for NINDS, 1. 3 for ECASS-II). For ECASS-II, larger shift effects appeared in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale 0 to 6 and 16 to 40 strata. Similarly, the mRS 0 to 2 analysis <b>but</b> not <b>mRS</b> 0 to 1 found similar treatment effects in both datasets (odds ratio, 1. 6 for NINDS, 1. 5 for ECASS-II) and similar variations in the low and high strata in the ECASS-II trial. NINDS found no significant treatment effects across the strata. After removing the strata at the fringes, the shift test lost significance in both datasets. CONCLUSIONS: Tissue plasminogen activator causes a beneficial shift toward wellness on the mRS in both the NINDS and ECASS-II trials, and ECASS-II would have been a positive trial according to the shift approach. However, the shift effect is not global for all treated patients and does not outperform the dichotomized 0 to 2 outcome. Patients with mild and severe deficits also shifted favorably on the mRS in the ECASS-II trial...|$|R

This has been incorporated into the Digital Communications in Medicine (DICOM) Standard for established imaging modalities, <b>but</b> not for <b>MRS.</b> An ontology was modelled to produce DICOM supported Structured Reports for MRS. Also, an algorithm to diagnosis different types of childhood brain cancer using MRS spectra was incorporated, allowing automated diagnostic support. A prototype Structured Reporting application was designed based on the ontology. The ontology was able to produce Structured Reports that successfully diagnosed certain childhood brain tumours based on the MRS readings. Usability testing and the diagnostic aspect of the ontology garnered positive feedback as MRS data is only currently used to diagnosis whether the tissue is cancerous or not...|$|R
40|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} spectroscopy (MRS) is {{the only}} non-invasive, non-radiation-based technique for investigating the metabolism of living tissue. MRS of protons (1 H-MRS), which provides the highest sensitivity of all MR-visible nuclei, is a method capable of detecting and quantifying specific cardiac biomolecules, such as lipids and creatine in normal and diseased hearts in both animal models and humans. This {{can be used to}} study mechanisms of heart failure development in a longitudinal manner, for example, the potential contribution of myocardial lipid accumulation in the context of ageing and obesity. Similarly, quantifying creatine levels provides insight into the energy storage and buffering capacity in the heart. Creatine depletion is consistently observed in heart failure independent of aetiology, but its contribution to pathophysiology remains a matter of debate. These and other questions can in theory be answered with cardiac <b>MRS,</b> <b>but</b> fundamental technical challenges have limited its use. The metabolites studied with MRS are much lower concentration than water protons, requiring methods to suppress the dominant water signal and resulting in larger voxel sizes and longer scan times compared to MRI. However, recent technical advances in MR hardware and software have facilitated the application of 1 H-MRS in humans and animal models of heart disease as detailed in this review. © 2012 The Author(s) ...|$|R
40|$|Background. Although {{research}} suggests that blood pressure variability (BPV) is detrimental in the weeks to months after acute ischemic stroke, {{it has not been}} adequately studied in the acute setting. Methods. We reviewed acute ischemic stroke patients from 2007 to 2014 with anterior circulation stroke. Mean blood pressure and three BPV indices (standard deviation, coefficient of variation, and successive variation) for the intervals 0 – 24, 0 – 72, and 0 – 120 hours after admission were correlated with follow-up modified Rankin Scale (mRS) in ordinal logistic regression models. The correlation between BPV and mRS was further analyzed by terciles of clinically informative stratifications. Results. Two hundred and fifteen patients met inclusion criteria. At all time intervals, increased systolic BPV was associated with higher <b>mRS,</b> <b>but</b> the relationship was not significant for diastolic BPV or mean blood pressure. This association was strongest in patients with proximal stroke parent artery vessel occlusion and lower mean blood pressure. Conclusion. Increased early systolic BPV is associated with worse neurologic outcome after ischemic stroke. This association is strongest in patients with lower mean blood pressure and proximal vessel occlusion, often despite endovascular or thrombolytic therapy. This hypothesis-generating dataset suggests potential benefit for interventions aimed at reducing BPV in this patient population...|$|R
