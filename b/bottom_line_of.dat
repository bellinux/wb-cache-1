Half the field was running the <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> the track while the other half was running the high line. The field largely rode around until the second caution of the race flew on lap 85. It was a planned competition caution. Brian Scott opted not to pit under the caution and assumed the lead.

The release note of HSI Version 2 also notes efforts to balance local and global context, individual and society concerns, left-right political issues, east-west and north-south cultural and social issues. Current Version 2 of the HSI ingests about 30 datasets and composite indicators, and covers 232 countries and dependencies. It is released at HumanSecurityIndex.org.|$|E
25|$|There {{are four}} walls to a squash court. The front wall, on which three {{parallel}} lines are marked, {{has the largest}} playing surface, whilst the back wall, which typically contains {{the entrance to the}} court, has the smallest. The out line runs {{along the top of the}} front wall, descending along the side walls to the back wall. There are no other markings on the side or back walls. Shots struck above or touching the out line, on any wall, are out. The <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> the front wall marks the top of the 'tin', a half metre-high metal area which if struck means that the ball is out. In this way the tin can be seen as analogous to the net in other racket sports such as tennis. The middle line of the front wall is the service line and is only relevant during serves.|$|E

The procedure consists of a seqnence of several image processing steps, inclnding morphological op-erators and a constrained istance transform which provides information about suleal depth at each location. 1 Int roduct ion This paper describes an automatic procedure for extracting the <b>bottom</b> <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> the naain cortical sulci from MR (magnetic resonance) images of the lmman brain. The sulci are deep narrow valleys or folds of the cortical surface. The automatic detection <b>of</b> sulcal <b>bottom</b> <b>lines</b> is <b>of</b> interest for several rea-sons.

500|$|Manor Marussia's Alexander Rossi {{was delighted}} with his result in twelfth, {{feeling that it}} could be [...] "the start of great things", after he had equalled the team's best result of the season. Daniel Ricciardo called for the FIA to clear up the {{regulations}} of the virtual safety car, following him being overtaken easily at the first restart by Nico Rosberg, saying that he had not gotten a warning {{about the end of the}} period. Kimi Räikkönen was equally displeased, complaining about the rules concerning driving standards. Following his on-track battle with Max Verstappen, he demanded clarification on whether Verstappen's aggressive driving style was legal, saying: [...] "I just wanted to ask if it's OK when you are next to another car, at some point on the exit of the corner are you allowed to always push the other car up on the kerbs [...] Apparently it's fine. As long as everybody has the same rules that's OK." [...] Concerning the collision between Nico Hülkenberg and Ricciardo, Force India revealed that damage to Hülkenberg's front wing had caused him to lose downforce and slide into the Red Bull. Following the turn one collision between their two drivers, Sauber's team principal Monisha Kaltenborn announced that she intended to [...] "have a word" [...] with her drivers, saying: [...] "The <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> this is that these kind of things simply must not happen. It is OK if you have decent and healthy competition which they do – both drivers are respectful to each other. [...] I'm upset. These mistakes shouldn't happen. We are much better than this." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{combination}} of the off-axis asymmetry and the mask shadowing effect leads to a fundamental inability of two identical features even {{in close proximity to}} be in focus simultaneously. One of EUVL's key issues is the asymmetry between the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> a pair of horizontal lines (the so-called [...] "two-bar"). Some ways to partly compensate are the use of assist features as well as asymmetric illumination.|$|E
2500|$|Due to {{the limited}} {{conditions}} in which NE can actually be observed, they are rarely treated {{as a guide to}} day-to-day behaviour, or observed in practice in human negotiations. However, as a theoretical concept in economics and evolutionary biology, the NE has explanatory power. The payoff in economics is utility (or sometimes money), and in evolutionary biology is gene transmission; both are the fundamental <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> survival. Researchers who apply games theory in these fields claim that strategies failing to maximize these for whatever reason will be competed out of the market or environment, which are ascribed the ability to test all strategies. This conclusion is drawn from the [...] "stability" [...] theory above. In these situations the assumption that the strategy observed is actually a NE has often been borne out by research.|$|E

2500|$|The voice flute was {{a popular}} size of {{recorder}} in the eighteenth century, especially in England. It offered an alternative instrument for amateurs to play music written for the transverse flute, since both instruments are at the same pitch. The usual clef used for recorder parts was the French violin clef, with G on the <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> the staff. Imagining this clef {{in place of the}} treble clef and using the normal F-alto fingerings on a voice flute renders music composed for flute or violin in the original key [...] Although the rather large number of surviving eighteenth-century voice flutes suggests this may have been a common practice at that time, there is little documentary evidence to support the idea ( [...] ; [...] ). Parts intended for this instrument were also often written in transposed notation, so the player could imagine he was playing an ordinary alto in F ( [...] ; [...] ).|$|E
2500|$|Throughout Paul's rise to superhuman status, {{he follows}} a plotline common to many stories {{describing}} {{the birth of}} a hero. He has unfortunate circumstances forced onto him. After a long period of hardship and exile, he confronts and defeats the source of evil in his tale. As such, Dune is representative of a general trend beginning in 1960s American science fiction in that it features a character who attains godlike status through scientific means. Eventually, Paul Atreides gains a level of omniscience which allows him to take over the planet and the galaxy, and causing the Fremen of Arrakis to worship him like a god. Author Frank Herbert said in 1979, [...] "The <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> the Dune trilogy is: beware of heroes. Much better [...] rely on your own judgment, and your own mistakes."

[...] Brauer said that in an opinion editorial released in 2011, Vang [...] "isn't kind to the Clint Eastwood film". Krissy Reyes-Ortiz of The <b>Bottom</b> <b>Line</b> <b>of</b> the University of California Santa Barbara said, based on Vang's testimony in a 2011 program, that [...] "Though {{many of the people}} who have seen the film may have gotten a sense of satisfaction and joy from seeing that Walt overcame his racism, the people who acted as the Hmong members in the movie did not" [...] and that [...] "They were offended by the traces of racism that were included in the movie and that they experienced themselves on set".
