5|$|Depending on the {{interest}} that the applicant seeks to represent, standing {{can be categorized}} as either private or public standing. Applicants must establish they have private standing if they seek to represent personal interests. In contrast, an applicant who seeks to represent {{the interest}}s of a larger group or {{the public at large}} must establish he or she has public or representative standing. Where private standing is concerned, the Singapore courts have not yet directly addressed the issue of the standing required to obtain a declaration in an administrative law case, but where constitutional claims are concerned the Court of Appeal held that three elements must exist: (1) the applicant must have a real interest in bringing the case, (2) there must be a real controversy between the parties to the case, and (3) a personal right possessed by the applicant must have been violated. The Court also suggested that the same test applied to applications for prerogative orders. The legal position on public standing in administrative law cases is indeterminate as, to date, no applicant has sought to rely on public standing to obtain leave for judicial review. In constitutional law cases, the Court has drawn a distinction <b>between</b> <b>public</b> <b>and</b> <b>private</b> rights, and held that people will not have standing to vindicate public rights unless they have suffered special damage and have genuine private interests to protect or further.|$|E

Although the theoretical justifications vary, the various schools all hold that government intervention will be much less effective than Keynes had believed, with some advocates even claiming {{that in the long}} run interventionist policy will always be counterproductive.|$|E

25|$|The Government {{has stated}} publicly, {{including}} before the U.N. Committee on Human Rights in Geneva, that its {{policy is to}} protect the right of non-Muslims to worship privately. However, non-Muslim organizations have claimed that there are no explicit guidelines for distinguishing <b>between</b> <b>public</b> <b>and</b> <b>private</b> worship, such as the number of persons permitted to attend and the types of locations that are acceptable. Such lack of clarity, as well as instances of arbitrary enforcement by the authorities, obliges most non-Muslims to worship in such a manner as to avoid discovery. Those detained for non-Muslim worship almost always are deported by authorities after sometimes lengthy periods of arrest during investigation. In some cases, they also are sentenced to receive lashes prior to deportation.|$|E
25|$|Malthus went on {{to argue}} that under such ideal conditions, the {{population}} could conceivably double every 25 years. However, the food supply could not continue doubling at this rate for even 50 years. The food supply would become inadequate for the growing population, and then:...the mighty law of self-preservation expels all the softer and more exalted emotions of the soul.... The corn is plucked before it is ripe, or secreted in unfair proportions; and the whole black train of vices that belong to falsehood are immediately generated. Provisions no longer flow in {{for the support of}} the mother with a large family. The children are sickly from insufficient food.... No human institutions here existed, to the perverseness of which Mr. Godwin ascribes the original sin of the worst men. No opposition had been produced by them <b>between</b> <b>public</b> <b>and</b> <b>private</b> good. No monopoly had been created of those advantages which reason directs to be left in common. No man had been goaded to the breach of order by unjust laws. Benevolence had established her reign in all hearts: and yet in so short a period as within fifty years, violence, oppression, falsehood, misery, every hateful vice, and every form of distress, which degrade and sadden the present state of society, seem to have been generated by the most imperious circumstances, by laws inherent in the nature of man, and absolutely independent of it human regulations.|$|E

The implement of market mechanism into the education symbolizes former administration. This administration achieved the domination of educational content and assessment, but promoted the inequality {{of education and the}} new labour administration recaptured. Therefore the most important issue for present Blair administration is to deal with these issues, which lead the aim as rising educational standards. One of the most-watched efforts of them is the partnership <b>between</b> <b>public</b> sector <b>and</b> <b>private</b> sector in education. The educational policies in Blair administration promote the partnership <b>between</b> <b>public</b> sector <b>and</b> <b>private</b> sector <b>and</b> emphasize the partnership between various private sector partners. The basic theory of the partnership <b>between</b> <b>public</b> sector <b>and</b> <b>private</b> sector in education in England is Private Finance Initiative (PFI) <b>and</b> <b>Public</b> <b>Private</b> Partnership (PPP).

Produced by Leon Russell, it {{was written}} and {{recorded}} during a session in March 1971 at Blue Rock Studios in New York City. The collaboration with Russell came about in part through Dylan's desire for a new sound—after a period of immersion in country rock music—and for a change from his previous producer. The song was praised by critics for its energy and distinctive vocals, guitar, and piano. It has been interpreted as Dylan's account of his writer's block in the early 1970s, and his wish to deliver less politically engaged material and find a new balance <b>between</b> <b>public</b> <b>and</b> <b>private</b> life.|$|E

Smart was left alone for four years, except for his cat Jeoffry and the occasional gawker who would come to see those deemed mad.
