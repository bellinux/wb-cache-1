In the proposed reshaping methods, <b>bump</b> <b>structures</b> are created {{on the surface of the}} conventional cylinder wind turbine tower. When a reshaped tower is illuminated by radar waves, the <b>bump</b> <b>structures</b> scatter incident radar waves into insignificant directions so that the strength of back-scattering is declined and the RCS of the wind turbine is decreased. The test results confirmed that the proposed methods significantly reduce bi-static RCS values of wind turbines.

30|$|In this experiment, {{structures}} 1 and 2 were tilted to 75 ° in the SEM {{to observe}} the gap between test structures. This is remarkable as no bonding temperature or adhesive was used during this bonding process to mechanically bond the die to the carrier. However, for structure 3, the die tended to slide off from the carrier during movement of the SEM's stage. The dummy <b>bumps</b> in <b>structures</b> 1 and 2 were effective in holding {{the weight of the}} die (0.033 g), but not in structure 3. Assuming a perfect alignment, the area occupied by a total of 74 CNT <b>bumps</b> on <b>structure</b> 2 is 0.74 mm 2 out of 16 mm 2 (die area). On the other hand, the area occupied by CNT <b>bumps</b> in <b>structure</b> 3 is 0.185 mm 2 out of 16 mm 2. This is logical because the dummy <b>bumps</b> in <b>structure</b> 3 were smaller as compared with those in structures 1 and 2. Based on structure 3, future designs using the die area will require more than 1.2 % to be converted for the implementation of the CNT bump area for sufficient mechanical support. This is to ensure that the bonding forces present within the CNT interconnection bumps is greater than the die's weight to ensure mechanical stability. A study based on total energy and molecular dynamic calculation on molecular CNT to CNT joining methodology shows that the type of bonding present between CNTs is very strong, and a force larger than 3 nN will be required to disengage the joining structure [18]. Yung et al. suggested the van der Waals forces between CNTs to be the bonding mechanism when CNTs were inserted into each other [11]. In this work, only the dimensions of bumps (area) were varied; the influence of densities and diameter of CNTs within a bump may also be an important consideration to CNT bonding mechanisms.|$|R

The X-ray spectra of the central region of W 28 exhibit many bright emission lines from highly ionized atoms. An optically thin thermal plasma in collisional ionization equilibrium, either of single-temperature or multi-temperature failed to reproduce the data with line-like and bump-like residuals at the Si Lymanα energy and at 2. 4 [...] 5. 0 keV, respectively. The bumps probably correspond to radiative recombination continua from He-like Si and S.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} the design, fabrication, {{and testing of}} a novel electrohydrodynamic (EHD) ion-drag mi-cropump. In order to maximize the electrical field gradients {{that are responsible for}} EHD pumping, we incorporated three-di-mensional (3 -D) triangular bumps of solder as part of the EHD electrodes. To form these bumps, Niobium was sputter-deposited onto a ceramic substrate, coated with photoresist, optically ex-posed and etched using a reactive ion etcher to define the electrode pattern. The substrate was then “dipped ” into a molten solder pool. Since the solder adheres only to the metallic film, bumps of solder form on the electrodes, giving the electrodes a significant 3 -D character. The overall dimensions of the micropump are 19 mm 32 mm 1. 05 mm. Four different designs were fabricated and tested. Static pressure tests were performed with a 3 M Thermal Fluid (HFE- 7100) as the working fluid and the optimum design was identified. The results with the thermal fluid were highly promising and indicated a pumping head of up to 700 Pa at an applied voltage of 300 V. The experimental results for the four different designs show that the presence of the 3 -D <b>bump</b> <b>structures</b> significantly improves the pumping performance. Also, a much better pumping performance was obtained with the micropump in which the emitter had a saw-tooth shape.

In this paper, it is emphasized that two different types of monopole excitations exist in ^ 16 O; one is the monopole excitation to cluster states which is dominant in the lower energy part (E_x≲ 16 MeV), and the other is the monopole excitation of the mean-field type such as one-particle one-hole (1 p 1 h) which is attributed mainly to the higher energy part (16 ≲ E_x≲ 40 MeV). It is found that this character of the monopole excitations originates from the fact that the ground state of ^ 16 O with the dominant doubly closed shell structure has a duality of the mean-field-type as well as α-clustering character. This dual nature of the ground state seems to be a common feature in light nuclei. Comment: 35 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
