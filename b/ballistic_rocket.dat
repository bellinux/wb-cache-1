The CY-1 is basically an anti-submarine torpedo of either the ET52 or Yu-7 class, delivered by a <b>ballistic</b> <b>rocket.</b> The delivery vehicle features four small stabilising fins and four control surfaces, and is powered by a solid-fuel rocket motor. The maximum range claimed by the developer was 10 nautical miles (or 18 km).|$|E
50|$|In 1956, when Brezhnev {{decided to}} examine a uranium mine shaft, the {{visitors}} had a shortage of protective suits. Ryabenko wore none and received a high dose of radiation. On 24 October 1960 he got exposed to the toxic chemical unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine, shortly after the Nedelin catastrophe, in which a <b>ballistic</b> <b>rocket</b> exploded on the launch pad. As a result, Ryabenko was hospitalized for two months with a heart attack. On 9 February 1961 he was with Brezhnev when their plane was attacked by hijacked French jet fighters above the Mediterranean Sea. On 23 March 1982, a platform with people collapsed above Brezhnev and his entourage at a factory near Tashkent. Both Brezhnev and Ryabenko received concussions.|$|E
5000|$|Konstantinov {{graduated}} from Mikhailovskoye Artillery School in St. Petersburg in 1836. In 1844, he invented a device {{for measuring the}} flight speed of projectiles at any point of their trajectory. In 1847 Konstantinov created a <b>ballistic</b> <b>rocket</b> pendulum, which would allow to establish a law of changing rocket motion in time. With the help of this device, {{he was able to}} determine the influence of the form and design of a rocket on its ballistic characteristics, thereby laying the foundations for calculated rocket designs. In 1849 he was appointed commander of the Petersburg Rocketry Department (Петербургское ракетное заведение). In 1861, he supervised the construction of a rocket factory in Nikolayev, which he would head six years later.|$|E
50|$|In {{the last}} decade of the Soviet Era Okhtyrka has been militarized. It housed many army regiments of all sorts. The Dachny precinct became a home to officers' {{families}} from all around the former USSR. Many of them served in Eastern Bloc countries (East Germany, Hungary, Czechoslovakia etc.), took part in Vietnam and Afghanistan wars and served as consultants in Cuba. As USSR started to fall apart all the machinery and <b>ballistic</b> <b>rockets</b> were transported back to Russian territory, however it took a very long time for the regiments to move or to transform. A lot of military personnel or their families stayed in Okhtyrka or still have connections to this city where they spent many years of their lives and that offered them home.|$|R

50|$|Karl Heinrich Emil Becker (14 September 1879 in Speyer - 8 April 1940 in Berlin) was a German weapons {{engineer}} and artillery general. He advocated and implemented close ties {{of the military}} to science for purposes of advanced weapons development. He {{was the head of}} the Army Ordnance Office, Senator of the Kaiser Wilhelm Society, first president of the Reich Research Council, the first general officer to be a member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences, as well as being a professor at both the University of Berlin and the Berlin Technical University. He was an early and key supporter of the development of <b>ballistic</b> <b>rockets</b> as weapons. The military-scientific infrastructure he helped implement supported the German nuclear energy program, known as the Uranium Club. Being depressed over heavy criticism from Hitler for shortfalls in munitions production, he committed suicide in 1940. He was given a State funeral.|$|R
50|$|Skybolt is {{a single}} stage <b>ballistic</b> <b>rocket</b> system powered by one Storm engine with a {{potential}} to generate an average trust of 68 kN, or around 7 tonnes. Storm utilises a bi-liquid combination of Liquid Oxygen (LOX) and Kerosene, and is effectively a practical, rocket-mountable successor to the Churchill engines developed before it. Though never flown, it is predicted that Skybolt with a fully fuelled Storm engine could reach the limit of space and beyond, and reach {{a top speed of}} nearly Mach 5. Practically, however, Storm is still not completely ready for field testing. There have been problems with the fuel injection plate amongst other smaller issues, and until these are resolved it will be unlikely that Skybolt will fly.|$|E
5000|$|According to {{a secret}} decree of the Soviet Government by on May 13, 1946 the year the {{development}} of the rocket industry was launched in the USSR. Even before this, in the autumn of 1945, the group M.Tikhonravov and Nikolai Chernyshov at NII-4 rocket artillery Academy of Sciences technology on its own initiative the first stratospheric rocket project was developed by BP-190 (also according to some estimates - project [...] "Victory") for vertical flight of two pilots to an altitude of 200 km based on captured German <b>ballistic</b> <b>rocket</b> V-2 (A-4). In February 1946, the project was presented to the Secretary of the USSR Academy of Sciences Academician N. G. Bruevich, and in March - the president of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR S. Vavilov. Then, the project has received a positive assessment of the expert committee of academician S. Khristianovich and was introduced to the Ministry of Aviation Industry at a meeting in June, the Minister of the aviation industry Mikhail Khrunichev.|$|E
5000|$|Employed by the Heylandt Company from 27 February 1928, in December 1929 Riedel was {{assigned}} {{responsibility for the}} development of rocket motors using liquid propellants, initially in collaboration with Max Valier who had joined the company at that date. [...] Riedel took over full responsibility for the rocket motor development in 1930, after Valier’s untimely death (following a rocket motor explosion during a test using paraffin oil (kerosene) as fuel instead of ethyl alcohol) In 1934, research and development of the Heylandt Company was taken over by the Army and amalgamated with the Wernher von Braun Group at the Army Proving Grounds at Kummersdorf, near Berlin, in order to carry out research and development of long-range rocket missiles. In March 1936, Wernher von Braun and Walter Riedel began consideration of much larger rockets than the A3 (under development at that time), which was merely a test vehicle and could not carry any payload. Along with Walter Dornberger, plans were drawn up for a more suitable and better equipped test site for large rockets at Peememünde, {{to take the place of}} the rather confined Kummersdorf. From 17 May 1937, following the transfer of the rocket activities from Kummersdorf to the Army’s new rocket establishment at Peenemünde, Riedel headed the Technical Design Office as Chief Designer of the A4 (V2) <b>ballistic</b> <b>rocket</b> [...] After the air raid by the British Royal Air Force (Operation Hydra) on Peenemünde in August 1943, the transfer of the development facility was ordered to a location giving better protection from air attack. The air raid had cost the lives of Dr Walter Thiel (Propulsion Chief) and Erich Walther (Chief of Maintenance for the workshops), two leading men at the Peenemünde Army facilities. In mid-September 1943, Riedel and two others surveyed the Austrian Alps for a new site for rocket development to replace that at Peenemünde. The chosen location was at Ebensee, on the southern end of the Traunsee, 100 km east of Salzburg. The site consisted of a system of galleries driven into the mountains, and received the code name Zement (Cement). Work on the site started at the beginning of 1944 and was intended to be completed in October 1945. From 1 October 1943, Riedel was responsible for supervising the transfer, to Ebensee, of the Peenemünde development facility. From 29 May 1945 to 20 September 1945, following the end of World War II, Riedel was held in protective custody (Sicherheitshaft) at the US Third Army’s internment camp at Deggendorf (situated between Regensburg and Passau). From 1 November 1945 to 10 March 1946 he was employed by the Ministry of Supply (MoS) Establishment at Altenwalde (near Cuxhaven), and from 11 March to 31 July 1946 at the MoS Establishment at Trauen (near Braunschweig). After the Trauen Establishment was disbanded, Riedel emigrated to England, to work initially (from 1947) at the Royal Aircraft Establishment, Farnborough and later (from 1948 until his death in 1968) at the MoS Rocket Propulsion Department (RPD) in Westcott (near Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire). In 1957, Riedel became a British citizen.|$|E
40|$|A {{program of}} reduced gravity fluids {{research}} was initiated {{in the late}} 1950 s. The primary motivations for this program was a need to characterize the behavior of propellants in a space environment. In the conduction of experiments, use was made of drop towers, aircraft, and <b>ballistic</b> <b>rockets.</b> There remained a core of problems {{which could not be}} solved with the aid of the employed approaches. Proposals for Spacelab experiments were, therefore, submitted. A committee came to the overall conclusion that there was a broad range of combustion experimentation that should be conducted in space. An examination of the analytical models which exist for numerous combustion phenomena reveals that these, are 'zero-G' theories. Experimentation in space will permit these theories to be tested and establish a firm basis upon which to build an understanding of more complicated combustion processes. Realistic in-space fire safety criteria are needed to eliminate the risk of major fire hazards in space. Such criteria can only be obtained through long-term reduced-gravity experimentation...|$|R
50|$|Space and rocket {{equipment}} {{is considered to}} be among the most powerful source of the man-made impact on the global climate, environment and economies. There are 17 cosmodromes (space-vehicle launching sites or space centers) in the world.Over the period 1957 to 2001, 1189 space rockets were launched from Baikonur to put into orbit 1237 space ships on various assignments. These launches also included more than 100 intercontinental <b>ballistic</b> <b>rockets.</b> From 2000 to 2001, 30% of the world’s space rocket launching was carried out from Baikonur space center.The location of space centers on the coasts of USA, France, Japan, Australia and India was done purposefully in order to reduce damage from accidents and prevent the fall of rocket stages and products of combustion in the residential areas. Only three countries - Russia, China and Kazakhstan - launch from landlocked continental space centers exposing the population of their countries to danger and polluting inhabited areas.|$|R
40|$|Quantum sensors {{based on}} {{coherent}} matter-waves are precise measurement devices whose ultimate accuracy is achieved with Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) in extended free fall. This is ideally realized in microgravity environments such as drop towers, <b>ballistic</b> <b>rockets</b> and space platforms. However, {{the transition from}} lab-based BEC machines to robust and mobile sources with comparable performance is a challenging endeavor. Here {{we report on the}} realization of a miniaturized setup, generating a flux of 4 × 10 ^ 5 quantum degenerate ^ 87 Rb atoms every 1. 6 s. Ensembles of 1 × 10 ^ 5 atoms can be produced at a 1 Hz rate. This is achieved by loading a cold atomic beam directly into a multi-layer atom chip that is designed for efficient transfer from laser-cooled to magnetically trapped clouds. The attained flux of degenerate atoms is on par with current lab-based BEC experiments while offering significantly higher repetition rates. Additionally, the flux is approaching those of current interferometers employing Raman-type velocity selection of laser-cooled atoms. The compact and robust design allows for mobile operation in a variety of demanding environments and paves the way for transportable high-precision quantum sensors.
