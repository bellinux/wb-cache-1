30|$|In this paper, the {{three-dimensional}} measurement model based on single-line structure is studied. For improving the calibration accuracy, a circular initialization window is proposed in camera calibration. A method for calculating the normal {{direction of the}} light stripe based on principal component analysis is proposed, and the rationality of the algorithm is verified by comparing with the normal direction obtained by the Hessian matrix. To further avoid {{a large number of}} two-dimensional Gaussian convolutional operations, bilinear interpolation and parabola {{in the direction of the}} normal are used in the paper. Finally, by measuring the height of the standard <b>block</b> <b>gauge,</b> it is proved that the improved measurement algorithm has a higher accuracy and speed for the measurement of the 3 D objected.|$|E
30|$|For serious radial {{distortion}} {{and high}} precision measurement, 3 D measurement model is {{studied in the}} paper. Based on the two-step calibration algorithm, a round initialization window is proposed to calculate the initial value of the camera parameters for nonlinear optimization. In order {{to solve the problem}} that the Supersonic Transport Evaluation Group algorithm of light stripe center extraction has a large amount of computation, a method is presented by normalized correlation coefficient (NCC) method and principal component analysis (PCA). Finally, the coordinates of the central stripe could be obtained based on the bilinear interpolation and parabolic fitting. With the parameters of the structured light plane that could be obtained by the coordinates of the central stripe, the height of <b>block</b> <b>gauge</b> is measured by the 3 D measurement model. The experiment results showed that the average measurement error is 0.0191  mm, and the strip extraction speed is improved.|$|E

Tool electrode and machined parts are deformed due to stochastic behaviour of discharge processes. Deposition of tool electrode material on workpiece deteriorates the surface quality of the micro part. Study of the surface quality of blind micro hole is very difficult in non-destructive method due to its miniature size. In this communication, {{attempts have been made}} to study the surface quality of high aspect ratio blind micro holes by opening the holes in destructive method. High aspect ratio blind micro holes were drilled in wear resistant high grade steel (<b>block</b> <b>gauge</b> material), zirconium based bulk metallic glass (BMG) Vit 1, titanium super alloy Ti- 6 Al- 4 V, oxygen free high thermal conductivity (OFHC) copper, Monel 400 and hard anodized aluminium alloy 6082 T 6 in micro EDM by cylindrical tungsten (W) electrode and opened the holes axially through wire EDM (WEDM) to study the surface texture of the opened holes using 3 D optical profilometry technique. Elemental analysis of materials of tips of tool electrode and surfaces of the opened micro holes were studied by using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) technique in scanning electron microscope (SEM). Deformations of tool electrode and tool profile on the workpiece were also studied...|$|E

40|$|<b>Gauge</b> <b>blocks</b> {{continue}} to be essential reference artifacts in manufacturing because of their simple geometry, {{but also because they}} can provide very high accuracy for a reasonable cost. The calibration technique of optical interferometry can directly link <b>gauge</b> <b>block</b> central length to the distance light travels in vacuum in 1 / 299792458 of a second, the definition of the International System of Units (SI) of length, the metre [1]. <b>Gauge</b> <b>blocks</b> calibrated by interferometry are then used in turn as reference standards to calibrate <b>gauge</b> <b>blocks</b> by mechanical comparison techniques, subsequently propagating the definition of the metre along the chain of calibrations, each with a specified measurement uncertainty.

The measurement principle is that the ball is positioned between an optical flat and a calibrated <b>gauge</b> <b>block.</b> The total length is measured in a <b>gauge</b> <b>block</b> relative to the optical flat and proper measurement of the deformations due to the measuring force. The parallelism is adjusted while viewing the interference patterns on the <b>gauge</b> <b>block</b> and the optical flat. The measuring force can be varied in the 0. 03 - 2. 35 N range.
