40|$|Objectives : Optimum viewing {{conditions}} facilitate {{identification of}} radiographic details and decrease {{the need for}} retakes, patients’ costs and radiation dose. This study sought to evaluate the effects of different viewing conditions on radiographic interpretation. Materials and Methods: This diagnostic study was performed by evaluating radiograph of a 7 mm-thick aluminum block, in which 10 holes with 2 mm diameters were randomly drilled with depths ranging from 0. 05 mm to 0. 50 mm. The radiograph was viewed by four oral radiologists independently under four viewing conditions, including a white light viewing light <b>box</b> <b>in</b> a lit room, yellow light viewing light <b>box</b> <b>in</b> a lit room, white light viewing light <b>box</b> <b>in</b> a dark room and yellow light viewing light <b>box</b> <b>in</b> a dark room. Number of circular shadows observed on the film was recorded. The data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA. Results: The mean number of detected circular shadows was 6. 75, 7. 5, 7. 25 and 7. 75 in white light viewing light <b>box</b> <b>in</b> a lit room, white light viewing light <b>box</b> <b>in</b> a dark room, yellow light viewing light <b>box</b> <b>in</b> a lit room and yellow light viewing light <b>box</b> <b>in</b> a dark room, respectively.

Conclusion: White and yellow light of the viewing light box had no significant effect on visibility of the radiographic details but more information was obtained in a dark room. </p...|$|R
40|$|Centromere protein B, {{which is}} {{involved}} in centromere formation, binds to centromeric repetitive DNA by recognizing a nucleotide motif called the CENP-B box. Humans have large numbers of CENP-B <b>boxes</b> <b>in</b> the centromeric repetitive DNA of their autosomes and X chromosome. The current understanding is that these CENP-B boxes are located at identical positions in the repeat units of centromeric DNA. Great apes also have CENP-B <b>boxes</b> <b>in</b> locations that are identical to humans. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to examine the location of CENP-B <b>box</b> <b>in</b> New World monkeys. We recently identified CENP-B <b>box</b> <b>in</b> one species of New World monkeys (marmosets). In this study, we found functional CENP-B <b>boxes</b> <b>in</b> CENP-A-assembled repeat units of centromeric DNA in 2 additional New World monkeys (squirrel monkeys and tamarins) by immunostaining and ChIP-qPCR analyses. The locations of the 3 CENP-B <b>boxes</b> <b>in</b> the repeat units differed from one another. The repeat unit size of centromeric DNA of New World monkeys (340 - 350 bp) is approximately twice that of humans and great apes (171 bp). This might be, associated with higher-order repeat structures of centromeric DNA, a factor for the observed variation <b>in</b> the CENP-B <b>box</b> location <b>in</b> New World monkeys...|$|R
