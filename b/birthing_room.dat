2500|$|Historically {{women have}} been {{attended}} and supported by other women during labour and birth. However currently, as more women are giving birth in a hospital rather than at home, continuous support has become {{the exception rather than}} the norm. When women became pregnant any time before the 1950s the husband would not be in the <b>birthing</b> <b>room.</b> It did not matter if it was a home birth; the husband was waiting downstairs or in another room in the home. If it was in a hospital then the husband was in the waiting room. [...] "Her husband was attentive and kind, but, Kirby concluded, Every good woman needs a companion of her own sex." [...] Obstetric care frequently subjects women to institutional routines, which may have adverse effects on the progress of labour. Supportive care during labour may involve emotional support, comfort measures, and information and advocacy which may promote the physical process of [...] labour as well as women's feelings of control and competence, thus reducing the need for obstetric intervention. The continuous support may be provided either by hospital staff such as nurses or midwives, doulas, or by companions of the woman's choice from her social network. [...] There is increasing evidence to show that the participation of the child's father in the birth leads to better birth and also post-birth outcomes, providing the father does not exhibit excessive anxiety.|$|E

40|$|A {{controlled}} {{clinical trial}} was carried out to assess whether a <b>birth</b> <b>room</b> setting would influence the care of mothers and newborns. Of the 163 low-risk women enrolled, 49 (30 %) manifested some prenatal risk and were excluded. The remaining 114 were allocated by strict alternation to a <b>birth</b> <b>room</b> or a conventional setting. Of the 56 women allocated to the <b>birth</b> <b>room,</b> 63 % of the primiparas and 19 % of the multiparas were later transferred. The numbers in the two settings who had oxytocin stimulation, epidural anesthesia, forceps delivery or cesarean section did not show statistically significant differences. The episiotomy rates were slightly lower in the <b>birth</b> <b>room</b> than in the conventional setting, and the rates of an intact perineum {{were higher in the}} <b>birth</b> <b>room.</b> Neither the Apgar scores nor the morbidity rates of the infants showed statistically significant differences related to the setting to which the mother had been allocated, although more infants from the conventional setting were admitted to a special care unit. Both "experimental" groups of women less often received routine perineal shaving, enemas or intravenous infusions than did an obstetrically similar nonexperimental comparison group. Despite the apparent inability in this setting for the <b>birth</b> <b>room</b> to influence the rate of major obstetric procedures (except for episiotomy) and outcomes, the authors believe that a <b>birth</b> <b>room</b> is desirable in tertiary care centres as well as in community hospitals...|$|R

50|$|Thus many {{birthing}} mothers {{pray for}} a simple labor {{due to the lack}} of health professional assistance nearby. Some reasons cited for not having skilled attendance at antenatal and delivery care include: transportation problems, lack of knowledge about service benefits, distance to the healthcare facility, and user fees. Some extrinsic factors influencing the presence of skilled attendance include: socio-demographic (age, education, residential area) and economic status. Interestingly, 31% of those who had unskilled attendance had no antenatal visit or care. Luckily, the lack of people in the <b>birthing</b> <b>room</b> means there is a dark, calm atmosphere for the baby to come into.|$|E

5000|$|Nihell {{started her}} midwife {{training}} in 1747 at the Hôtel Dieu in Paris {{for two years}} under Marie-Claude Pour. This was a long stay, however it was facilitated by the Duke of Orlèans {{which may have been}} the reason for the long stay. [...] There she was able to train and witness over 2,000 births. This was a big accomplishment because women in this time did not attend schooling, especially in the medical field. The Hôtel Dieu in Paris was common hospital around this time, which taught midwifery especially by one famous midwife, Madame du Coudray, who was supported by King Louis XV. In 1754, Nihell and her husband moved to Britain and settled in Haymarket. After settling in, Nihell started to advertise herself as a midwife in the London Evening Post. This allowed Nihell to attend over 900 births as a midwife. [...] In 1760, she published her first book called a Treatise on the Art of Midwifery, which was a criticism of William Smellie’s methods of childbirth and his use of forceps. Before the eighteenth century, male midwives in the <b>birthing</b> <b>room</b> were so rare there was little need for debate. [...] However, due to the creation and spread of forceps, male midwives became more popular and the status of female midwives declined due to the acceptance of male midwives by the upper class English and the belief that women were unable to understand and perform obstetric techniques. Nihell's publication spoke about how instruments brought into the <b>birthing</b> <b>room</b> by male midwives were usually unnecessary and caused harm to the baby. [...] Nihell also told readers that they had the right to any decisions in the <b>birthing</b> <b>room,</b> not the male midwives. Nihell's main concern was how these new obstetrical instruments would replace female midwives at a much greater cost to infant’s lives. Nihell believed that for an easy delivery, assistance from a midwife was all that was needed and for extreme situations all that was required was knowledge, experience, tenderness, and presence of mind. She even stated that male midwives would get paid more than female midwives. After publishing her work there were many people who criticized her. However, Nihell fought back with anonymous publications, letters to the press, and a treatise titled The Danger and Immodesty of the Present too General Customs of Unnecessarily Employing Men-Midwives (1772). She even called one critic a buffoon, which was unheard of as women in this time period were not supposed to be outspoken.|$|E
