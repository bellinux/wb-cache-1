5|$|Early {{models of}} the Wii are fully {{backwards}} compatible with GameCube software {{and most of its}} accessories; the Wii Family Edition and the Wii Mini iterations lack GameCube support. Early versions of the PlayStation 3 and all {{models of the}} Xbox 360 only offer partial support and use software emulation for <b>backwards</b> <b>compatibility.</b> Current versions of the PS3 do not offer PlayStation 2 compatibility, though PS1 compatibility is retained. Some models of the first generation of the PS3 offered full <b>backwards</b> <b>compatibility</b> for PS2 games. The Xbox 360's compatibility is increased through game-specific patches automatically downloaded from Xbox Live or downloaded and burned to a CD or DVD from the Xbox website and the PS3's compatibility is expanded with firmware updates.|$|E

25|$|Most DVD {{players are}} {{compatible}} with VCDs, and VCD-only players are available throughout Asia, and online through many shopping sites. Older Blu-ray and HD-DVD players also retained support, as do CBHD players as well. However, most current Blu-ray players and the Sony PlayStation 3/4 cannot play VCDs; this is because while they have <b>backwards</b> playback <b>compatibility</b> with the DVD standard, these player can not read VCD data because the player software does not have support for MPEG-1 video and audio.|$|R

5|$|A Game of the Year Edition {{containing}} all downloadable {{content was}} released for both PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, on 11 October 2011 in North America and on 14 October 2011 internationally. Additionally, Microsoft added {{the game to}} its <b>backwards</b> <b>compatibility</b> list for Xbox One platforms in July 2016.|$|E
5|$|Sony {{announced}} {{before the}} PS3 launch in Europe that the PlayStation 2's Emotion Engine CPU would {{be removed from}} it for cost savings, and all <b>backwards</b> <b>compatibility</b> would be software-based. This is also {{the same for the}} 80 GB model launched in the North American market in 2007.|$|E
5|$|System {{calls are}} being split into userland and kernel {{versions}} and being encapsulated into messages. This will {{help reduce the}} size {{and complexity of the}} kernel by moving variants of standard system calls into a userland compatibility layer, and help maintain forwards and <b>backwards</b> <b>compatibility</b> between DragonFly versions. Linux and other Unix-like OS compatibility code is being migrated out similarly.|$|E
40|$|Integrating {{reconfigurable}} computing hardware into {{general purpose}} computers offers promise of performance improvement. General purpose computers {{allows for a}} large amount of multitasking, as such, the reconfigurable hardware integrated intosuch a system should also support multitasking. This requires a low overhead reconfiguration method that supports preemption of tasks running on reconfigurablehardware. To investigate methods that can integrate reconfigurable hardware intoa multitasking machine an architecture for a reconfigurable device is proposed. In this work the proposed architecture is taken to prototype level. This includesa definition of the computational properties of the basic reconfigurable blocks, areconfiguration method that can fit within the requirements of multitasking, a configuration format that allows for <b>backwards</b> binary <b>compatibility,</b> and support forrudimentary control flow. The resulting prototype system has been tested andevaluated...|$|R
50|$|In 1984, {{after the}} {{cancellation}} of the Apple IIx project, Dan Hillman and Jay Rickard, engineers at Apple, were assigned to {{lower the cost of}} the Apple II. They were able to compress the design of almost the entire Apple II onto one chip which they named Mega II. When the 16-bit Apple IIGS project came onto the table, the virtually completed design of the Mega II was a clear starting point for seamless <b>backwards</b> 8-bit system <b>compatibility.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In {{the rear}} of the machine the most obvious change was a three-prong AC plug {{connector}} and power switch where the voltage converter had once been, an Apple security port at the far left corner, and the standardization of the serial port connectors (changed from DIN-5 to mini DIN-8, but still providing an identical signal). All the same built-in Apple II peripheral equivalents and port functionality of the IIc remained, with the one exception being the floppy port. Whereas the previous IIc could only support one external 5.25-inch floppy drive and (in later models) [...] "intelligent" [...] storage devices such as the UniDisk 3.5, the Apple IIc Plus offered <b>backwards</b> port <b>compatibility</b> and more. Support for the external Apple 3.5 Drive used by the Apple IIGS and Macintosh was now present, and up to two external 5.25-inch floppy drives could be added as well.|$|R
5|$|With Perreault's success, Microsoft {{announced}} the Xbox <b>backwards</b> <b>compatibility</b> on the Xbox One in June 2017. Thrirteen titles were initially released on October 24, 2017, with more to come. However, Microsoft does not anticipate {{that there will}} be as many Xbox titles brought to the program as with the Xbox 360, primarily due to legal issues related to intellectual property, contracts, and companies that have since gone defunct.|$|E
5|$|The MacBook Pro {{comes with}} the {{successor}} to BIOS, Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) 1.1. EFI handles booting differently from BIOS-based computers, but provides <b>backwards</b> <b>compatibility,</b> allowing dual and triple boot configurations. In addition to OS X, the Microsoft Windows operating system is installable on Intel x86-based Apple computers. Officially, this is limited to both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, and 10 with the necessary hardware drivers included with the Boot Camp software. Other x86 operating systems such as Linux are also unofficially supported. This is {{made possible by the}} presence of the Intel architecture as provided by the CPU and the BIOS emulation Apple has provided on top of EFI.|$|E
5|$|Windows 8.1 adds tighter {{integration}} with several Microsoft-owned services. OneDrive (formerly SkyDrive) is integrated {{at the system}} level to sync user settings and files. Files are automatically downloaded in the background when they are accessed from the user's OneDrive folder, unless they are marked to be available offline. By default, only file metadata and thumbnails are stored locally, and reparse points are used to {{give the appearance of}} a normal directory structure to provide <b>backwards</b> <b>compatibility.</b> The OneDrive app was updated to include a local file manager. OneDrive use on Windows 8.1 requires that a user's Windows account be linked to a Microsoft account; the previous SkyDrive desktop client (which did not have this requirement) is not supported on Windows 8.1.|$|E
40|$|The ext 2 and ext 3 filesystems on Linux R ○ {{are used}} by {{a very large number}} of users. This is due to its {{reputation}} of dependability, robustness, <b>backwards</b> and forwards <b>compatibility,</b> rather than that of being the state of the art in filesystem technology. Over the last few years, however, there has been a significant amount of development effort towards making ext 3 an outstanding filesystem, while retaining these crucial advantages. In this paper, we discuss those features that have been accepted in the mainline Linux 2. 6 kernel, including directory indexing, block reservation, and online resizing. We also discuss those features that have been implemented but are yet to be incorporated into the mainline kernel: extent maps, delayed allocation, and multiple block allocation. We will then examine the performance improvements from Linux 2. 4 ext 3 filesystem to Linux 2. 6 ext 3 filesystem using industrystandard benchmarks features. Finally, we will touch upon some potential future work which is still under discussion by the ext 2 / 3 developers. 1...|$|R
5000|$|When {{referring}} to laptop displays or independent displays and projectors intended primarily {{for use with}} computers, WXGA {{is also used to}} describe a resolution of 1280×800 pixels, with an aspect ratio of 16:10. This was once particularly popular for laptop screens, usually with a diagonal screen size of between 12 and 15 inches, as it provided a useful compromise between 4:3 XGA and 16:9 WXGA, with improved resolution in both dimensions vs. the old standard (especially useful in portrait mode, or for displaying two standard pages of text side-by-side), a perceptibly [...] "wider" [...] appearance and the ability to display 720p HD video [...] "native" [...] with only very thin letterbox borders (usable for on-screen playback controls) and no stretching. Additionally, like 1360×768, it required only 1000 KB (just under 1 MB) of memory per 8-bit channel; thus, a typical double-buffered 32-bit colour screen could fit within 8 MB, limiting everyday demands on the complexity (and cost, energy use) of integrated graphics chipsets and their shared use of typically sparse system memory (generally allocated to the video system in relatively large blocks), at least when only the internal display was in use (external monitors generally being supported in [...] "extended desktop" [...] mode to at least 1600×1200 resolution). 16:10 (or 8:5) is itself a rather [...] "classic" [...] computer aspect ratio, harking back all the way to early 320×200 modes (and their derivatives) as seen in the Commodore 64, IBM CGA card and others. However, as of mid 2013, this standard is becoming increasingly rare, crowded out by the more standardised and thus more economical-to-produce 1366×768 panels, as its previously beneficial features become less important with improvements to hardware, gradual loss of general <b>backwards</b> software <b>compatibility,</b> and changes in interface layout. As of August 2013, the market availability of panels with 1280×800 native resolution had been generally relegated to data projectors or niche products such as convertible tablet PCs and LCD-based eBook readers.|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} use of dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) {{in children}} {{has led to the}} need for robust reference data for interpretation of scans in daily clinical practice. Such data need to be representative of the population being studied and be ‘future-proofed’ to software and hardware upgrades. The aim was to combine all available paediatric DXA reference data from seven UK centres to create reference curves adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity and body size to enable clinical application, using in-vivo cross calibration and making data back- and forward- compatible. Seven UK sites collected data on GE-Lunar or Hologic Scanners between 1996 and 2012. Males and females aged 4 to 20 years were recruited (n[*]=[*] 3598). The split by ethnic group was: White Caucasian 2887; South Asian 385; Black Afro-Caribbean 286; mixed heritage 40. Scans of the total body and lumbar spine (L 1 -L 4) were obtained. The European Spine Phantom was used to cross-calibrate the 7 centres and 11 scanners. Reference curves were produced for L 1 -L 4 bone mineral apparent density (BMAD) and total body less head (TBLH) and L 1 -L 4 areal bone mineral density (aBMD) for GE Lunar Prodigy and iDXA (sex-and ethnic-specific) and for Hologic (sex-specific). Regression equations for TBLH BMC were produced using stepwise linear regression. Scans of 100 children were randomly selected to test <b>backwards</b> and forwards <b>compatibility</b> of software versions, up to version 15. 0 for GE Lunar, and Apex 4. 0 for Hologic. For the first time, sex and ethnic- specific reference curves for lumbar spine BMAD, aBMD and TBLH aBMD are provided for both GE-Lunar and Hologic scanners. These curves will facilitate interpretation of DXA data in children using methods recommended in ISCD guidelines. The databases have been created to allow future updates and analysis when more definitive evidence for the best method of fracture prediction in children is agreed...|$|R
5|$|On 6 August 2008, Rockstar {{announced}} that a Microsoft Windows version of Grand Theft Auto IV was in development by Rockstar North and Rockstar Toronto. The game was originally announced for release in North America on 18 November 2008 and in Europe on 21 November 2008 but was later pushed back to 2 and 3 December 2008, respectively. It contains expanded features, including traffic density control, draw distance configurations and a replay editor. The replay editor allows players to record and edit game clips, videos can then be uploaded to Rockstar's Social Club website. It utilised Games for Windows - Live for online play and supports 32 players for multiplayer. SecuROM protection is utilised and a one time online activation is {{required in order to}} play the game. The game was made available on Steam on 4 January 2009. On 9 February 2017, the Xbox 360 version of Grand Theft Auto IV was made available for <b>backwards</b> <b>compatibility</b> with the Xbox One.|$|E

25|$|On February 5, 2010, Marc Whitten {{announced}} that Xbox Live had reached 23million members. On the same day, Larry Hyrb, Xbox Live's Major Nelson, announced on his blog that Xbox Live {{support for the}} original Xbox would be discontinued on April 15, 2010, including online play through <b>backwards</b> <b>compatibility</b> on the Xbox 360 and all downloadable content for original Xbox games.|$|E
25|$|The PlayStation 3 was {{originally}} launched in Japan on November 11, 2006 and in North America on November 17, 2006 with two SKUs: a 20 GB version and a 60 GB version. Both {{of these models}} included hardware <b>backwards</b> <b>compatibility</b> for PlayStation 2 games. In January 2007, Sony announced that Europe's 60 GB version would exclude hardware <b>backwards</b> <b>compatibility</b> for PS2 titles and instead would provide compatibility through software emulation of the PS2's hardware. During the course of 2007, Sony announced several new PlayStation 3 SKUs and discontinued others. The new 40 GB, 80 GB and 160 GB PlayStation 3 models do not feature software emulation of PlayStation 2 hardware. In August 2009, all previous models were discontinued, as the new PS3 Slims were released, in 120GB and 250GB editions, priced at $299 and $349, respectively. One year later, in August 2010, the 120GB version went out of production, {{to be replaced by}} a 160GB counterpart, which was also priced at $299.|$|E

25|$|It was {{announced}} on November 9, 2015 that Black Ops would become backwards {{compatible with the}} Xbox One. It was originally meant to be available for <b>backwards</b> <b>compatibility</b> in December 2015, but the date was later changed to some time in 2016. Black Ops was originally the sixth-most requested Xbox 360 title to become backwards compatible with the Xbox One.

25|$|Some {{manufacturers}} have released official emulators {{for their own}} consoles. For example, the Virtual Console allows users to play games for old Nintendo consoles on the Wii, Wii U, and 3DS. Virtual Console is part of Nintendo's strategy for deterring video game piracy. In November 2015, Microsoft launched <b>backwards</b> <b>compatibility</b> of Xbox 360 games on Xbox One console via emulation. Also, Sony announced relaunching PS2 games on PS4 via emulation. According to Sony Computer Entertainment America v. Bleem, creating an emulator for a proprietary video game console is legal. However, Nintendo claims that emulators promote the distribution of illegally copied games.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, an {{extension}} to the PNG format called APNG was proposed as {{alternative to the}} MNG format by Mozilla. APNG provide the ability to animate PNG files, while retaining <b>backwards</b> <b>compatibility</b> in decoders that cannot understand the animation chunk (unlike MNG). Older decoders will simply render the first frame of the animation. The PNG group officially rejected APNG as an official extension on April 20, 2007. There have been several subsequent proposals for a simple animated graphics format based on PNG using several different approaches. Nevertheless, Animated Portable Network Graphics is still under development by Mozilla and is supported in Firefox 3 while MNG support was dropped.|$|E
25|$|To encode a {{particular}} written {{form of a}} character, there are extra code points provided in Unicode {{which can be used}} to express the exact written form desired. The range Arabic presentation forms A (U+FB50 to U+FDFF) contain ligatures while the range Arabic presentation forms B (U+FE70 to U+FEFF) contains the positional variants. These effects are better achieved in Unicode by using the zero-width joiner and non-joiner, as these presentation forms are deprecated in Unicode, and should generally only be used within the internals of text-rendering software, when using Unicode as an intermediate form for conversion between character encodings, or for <b>backwards</b> <b>compatibility</b> with implementations that rely on the hard-coding of glyph forms.|$|E
25|$|Until {{the launch}} of the Switch in 2017, the Nintendo 64 was the latest major home console to use the {{cartridge}} as its primary storage format, although most handheld systems (with the exception of the PlayStation Portable) continued to use cartridges. Most home systems began using disc, flash, and online formats. With the Nintendo GameCube, the company utilized the optical disc format instead of the cartridge format, in a boon to some developers. The company's stated goal was to reduce manufacturing costs; Nintendo did not cite storage space as a rationale. While the new console lacks <b>backwards</b> <b>compatibility</b> with Nintendo 64 Game Paks, Nintendo said players could simply keep their Nintendo 64.|$|E
