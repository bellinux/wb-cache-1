5|$|BSkyB's {{continued}} {{partnership with}} the Premier League {{has led to an}} increase in the value of <b>broadcasting</b> <b>rights</b> and matches televised. Managers however have voiced their concerns about the latter and the excessive cost of live rights is partly a reason why top-flight football has not returned to the BBC or ITV. In 2005 BSkyB's monopoly on live rights ended after the European Commission ruled that the Premier League needed to have more than one holder.|$|E
5|$|Bayern is an {{exception}} in professional, international football, having generated profits in nine of the last ten seasons. Other clubs often report losses, realizing transfers via loans, whereas Bayern always uses current assets. Also Bayern differs from other European top clubs in their income composition. While other clubs derive more than 35% of their revenues from broadcasting right, Bayern earn only 22% of their revenues that way. This is often accounted for by Bayern not marketing their broadcasting right themselves. Instead the Deutsche Fußball Liga negotiates <b>broadcasting</b> <b>rights</b> for the whole Bundesliga.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fifth}} chapter, Stursberg recounts CBC's {{experience}} losing sports licenses. While the CBC had superior market placement (with respect to geographic coverage and experience with amateur sports), {{they lost the}} 2010 and 2012 Olympics to a joint CTV/TSN/Rogers $153 million bid. The Canadian Football League moved its <b>broadcasting</b> <b>rights</b> to TSN with Stursberg citing Commissioner Tom Wright's displeasure with the CBC's poor coverage of CFL games during the CBC 2005 lock-out. The CBC also lost <b>broadcasting</b> <b>rights</b> for The Brier and the Tournament of Hearts to CTV/TSN. Stursberg negotiated for Hockey Night in Canadas NHL rights with Gary Bettman and managed to extend their contract, but at a significantly higher price. The sixth chapter deals with CBC News which, as Stursberg explains, were scheduled to have the local newscasts eliminated. Instead, he initiated style and content reforms, taking effect in October 2009, including {{the creation of an}} internal newswire to provide stories suitable for TV, radio, and web services. He also commissioned an independent study to analyze a perceived anti-conservative bias in news coverage but the study found the coverage to be more conservative friendly than either the Global or CTV coverage. The chapter on Radio noted CBC Radio One's dominance in the Canadian radio market but CBC Radio Two's low ratings. Stursberg advocated for more local radio coverage, especially in the Hamilton area, and facilitated the programming change of CBC Radio Two by inserting more musical variety, specializing in Canadian music.|$|E

5|$|Television {{has played}} a major role in the history of the Premier League. The League's {{decision}} to assign <b>broadcasting</b> <b>rights</b> to BSkyB in 1992 was at the time a radical decision, but one that has paid off. At the time pay television was an almost untested proposition in the UK market, as was charging fans to watch live televised football. However, a combination of Sky's strategy, the quality of Premier League football and the public's appetite for the game has seen the value of the Premier League's TV rights soar.|$|E

5|$|As {{professional}} football {{became a national}} television phenomenon, college football did as well. In the 1950s, Notre Dame, which had a large national following, formed its own network to broadcast its games, {{but by and large}} the sport still retained a mostly regional following. In 1952, the NCAA claimed all television <b>broadcasting</b> <b>rights</b> for the games of its member institutions, and it alone negotiated television rights. This situation continued until 1984, when several schools brought a suit under the Sherman Antitrust Act; the Supreme Court ruled against the NCAA and schools are now free to negotiate their own television deals. ABC Sports began broadcasting a national Game of the Week in 1966, bringing key matchups and rivalries to a national audience for the first time.|$|E

Stursberg was recruited by CBC president Robert Rabinovitch who understood and supported Stursberg's intention to move the CBC's focus more towards producing popular content with success and failure defined {{by the number of}} people who watch, rather than awards or critical praise. The book covers a range of topics relating to CBC, including acquiring popular shows, like Little Mosque on the Prairie and Heartland, for CBC Television, modernizing news coverage at CBC News, adjustments to CBC Radio, and CBC Sports losing <b>broadcasting</b> <b>rights</b> to its competitors.|$|E

5|$|The 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin {{were the}} first Games to be {{broadcast}} on television, though only to local audiences. The 1956 Winter Olympics {{were the first}} internationally televised Olympic Games, and the following Winter Games had their <b>broadcasting</b> <b>rights</b> sold {{for the first time}} to specialised television broadcasting networks—CBS paid US$394,000 for the American rights, and the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) allocated US$660,000. In the following decades the Olympics became one of the ideological fronts of the Cold War. Superpowers jockeyed for political supremacy, and the IOC wanted to take advantage of this heightened interest via the broadcast medium. The sale of broadcast rights enabled the IOC to increase the exposure of the Olympic Games, thereby generating more interest, which in turn created more appeal to advertisers time on television. This cycle allowed the IOC to charge ever-increasing fees for those rights. For example, CBS paid US$375million for the rights of the 1998 Nagano Games, while NBC spent US$3.5billion for the broadcast rights of all the Olympic Games from 2000 to 2012.|$|E
5|$|The strongest bids were Memphis, Louisville, Anaheim and New Orleans. As {{the latter}} two had venues in place, they were seen as having an edge on the other two. Both Memphis and Louisville needed public funding for a new venue, and in either city, the team would have {{to play in a}} sub-optimal {{location}} for several seasons. However, {{the construction of a new}} venue was seen as an advantage by the Grizzlies, as it could be tailor-made for basketball, and the team would be able to control all revenue. The team also expected the highest local radio and television <b>broadcasting</b> <b>rights</b> in Louisville and Memphis, and that the two cities lacked other Big Four major league teams, granting the team preferred air times and increased attention from fans and media. A 2000 report from PricewaterhouseCoopers concluded that small cities often had higher attendance than larger cities because of team's professional league exclusivity. It also pointed to the strong support for college basketball in Tennessee and Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s and 1990s, Sky Sports and the BBC's Grandstand {{programme}} {{covered the}} British Hockey League and Superleague and their important games and competitions regularly. However, in 2001 the Superleague sold its <b>broadcasting</b> <b>rights</b> to 'Premium TV Ltd' {{who planned to}} set up a new sports channel, which never materialised. British ice hockey was left without coverage from any television network. This situation continued through the final seasons of the Superleague and into the first seasons of the Elite League. In 2005, Elite League officials concluded an agreement with the North American Sports Network to provide a weekly highlights and news programme. These usually provide highlights from a game recorded the previous weekend and are an hour in length. In September 2007 the Elite League announced a deal with Sky Sports for a weekly show of Elite League highlights. In 2010 Sky Sports showed the playoff final between the Belfast Giants and Cardiff Devils live, {{this was the first time}} Sky had shown a live game for several years. Sky Sports have recently announced plans to show 8 live games along with a weekly highlight show during the 2010–11 season.
