5|$|The {{international}} community maintained that Rajoelina's legitimacy was conditional to {{free and fair}} elections. A number of key international organizations in which Madagascar had been a member, including the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the African Union, withheld recognition of Rajoelina's legitimacy throughout his tenure. The United States, Madagascar's largest <b>bilateral</b> <b>donor</b> and provider of humanitarian aid, also refused to acknowledge the Rajoelina administration. The United Nations responded to the power transfer by freezing 600 million euros in planned aid. The United States suspended Madagascar {{from the list of}} beneficiaries of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), which had ensured preferential tariffs for the import of Malagasy textiles. This sanction resulted in the loss of over 50,000 jobs and dealt a severe blow to the textile sector, which had accounted for half of Madagascar's exports. Rajoelina initially sought to persuade former donors to recommence their support; when these efforts failed to yield results, he explored the possibility of foregoing the support of traditional partners through new or strengthened relations with such alternatives as Libya, China and Saudi Arabia but was again unable to secure the desired partnerships.|$|E

Islamabad has also reportedly accused Indian consulates in Kandahar and Jalalabad of providing support to insurgents in Pakistan's troubled Balochistan region, a claim repeated by Urdu newspapers to conservative and hardline Islamic constituents in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region. Coupled with Pakistan's old and documented animosity towards India, analysts claim Pakistan had strong motives to target Indian nationals and their economic projects in Afghanistan.|$|E

Nordic aid distribution differs significantly from other <b>bilateral</b> aid <b>donor</b> patterns: Norway, Denmark, Sweden and Finland provide more aid to democracies but do not penalise poor trade policies.

40|$|This paper, {{based on}} a review of SIDA’s funding of NGOs in Bangladesh, explores the {{changing}} relationships between <b>bilateral</b> <b>donors,</b> Northern NGOs (NNGOs), and Southern NGOs (SNGOs). It compares direct and indirect funding routes between donors and SNGOs. Most SIDA funding of SNGOs was previously undertaken through Swedish NGOs. As SNGO competence and capacity has increased through their own efforts at professionalisation, through wider recognition and support from government and by the provision of `capacity building’ partnerships with NNGOs, these Southern organisations have taken up positions within the burgeoning `third sectors’ of aid-recipient countries alongside the governmental and business sectors. SIDA has increasingly funded SNGOs directly through its Dhaka office. The paper sets out to address two main themes {{in the context of}} Swedish aid to NGOs in Bangladesh. Firstly, as <b>bilateral</b> <b>donors</b> provide an increasing proportion of their resources to NGOs, how can sound and responsible funding relationships based on mutual trust rebuilt between <b>bilateral</b> <b>donors</b> and NGOs?

40|$|In this paper, we {{perform a}} Tobit {{analysis}} of aid allocations, covering the period 1999 - 2002 and accounting for both altruistic and selfish donor motives. We first compare the allocative behavior of all <b>bilateral</b> <b>donors</b> taken together {{with that of}} multilateral aid agencies, and then look at nine major <b>bilateral</b> <b>donors</b> individually. It turns out that poorer countries get clearly more aid from both <b>bilateral</b> and multilateral <b>donors,</b> {{with the possible exception}} of France and Japan. Most <b>bilateral</b> <b>donors</b> and the multilateral agencies are also found to direct significantly more aid to well governed recipients if governance is measured by the World Bank?s CPIA. If the CPIA is replaced by the Kaufmann index, however, the policy orientation of aid becomes extremely weak. In contrast to a recent paper by Dollar and Levin (2004), our estimates do neither suggest that multilateral aid is more poverty and policy oriented than bilateral aid, nor that IDA performs particularly well within the group of multilateral donors. Post-conflict resolution, the third altruistic motive considered in the paper, emerges as a significant determinant of aid allocations in 2002. The importance of selfish aid motives clearly differs between <b>bilateral</b> and multilateral <b>donors.</b> We find no evidence that donor countries were able to push through their individual trade and political interests at the multilateral level. By contrast, the export-related self interest of DAC countries provided a fairly strong incentive to grant bilateral aid, as did colonial ties.
