40|$|This paper {{presents}} a <b>business</b> <b>service</b> innovation taxonomy where we link <b>business</b> <b>service</b> types to sources/drivers of innovation. <b>Business</b> <b>service</b> innovation {{can occur in}} the service concept, in the client interface, in the service delivery system and the underlying service technology. The major source of innovation and renewal in <b>business</b> <b>services</b> is regarded to be knowledge/competencies/intangible assets.

In order to align these competencies to <b>business</b> <b>services,</b> we develop a <b>business</b> <b>service</b> typology by arguing that degree of standardization and degree of client interaction in the service delivery process are the major categories for distinguishing <b>business</b> <b>services.</b> Based {{on a combination of}} these categories, four generic types of <b>business</b> <b>services</b> are identified: expert <b>business</b> <b>services,</b> client <b>business</b> <b>service,</b> special <b>business</b> <b>services,</b> and standard <b>business</b> <b>services.</b> Informed by the service innovation research and case examples from <b>business</b> <b>service</b> firms, we link the four <b>business</b> <b>service</b> types to innovation drivers (competencies types) and suggest a busines...|$|R

To attain {{interoperable}} <b>business</b> <b>service</b> collaborations, {{the nature}} and concepts of service-oriented inter-enterprise environments must be carefully analysed and formalized.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} specialisation (within-sector clustering) and diversity (between-sector clustering) on <b>business</b> <b>services</b> profitability and location choice. We apply a semiparametric Poisson sorting model allowing for firm-specific effects. We find that for most firms, profitability of <b>business</b> <b>services</b> firms is substantially higher close to specialised clusters of <b>business</b> <b>services</b> firms. A standard deviation increase in <b>business</b> <b>services</b> specialisation leads to on average a 40 {{percent increase in the}} probability that a <b>business</b> <b>services</b> firm locates there, supporting theories of Marshall, Arrow and Romer. It is also profitable for most <b>business</b> <b>services</b> firms to locate near a group of firms that belong to the same sector, not necessarily <b>business</b> <b>services</b> firms, so diversity is negatively related to location decisions. Almost all firms either benefit from within-sector clustering or between-sector clustering.

40|$|This paper {{estimates}} {{a heterogeneous}} sorting model for firms, employing a semiparametric Poisson approach. We {{show that there}} is an equivalence relation between a locally weighted Logit and Poisson model. We apply our model to estimate firm-specific preferences of <b>business</b> <b>services</b> firms for location attributes such as diversity of economic activities and specialisation of <b>business</b> <b>services.</b> We correct for endogeneity of our specialisation measure by means of a control function approach, using instruments external as well as internal to the model. We find that <b>business</b> <b>services</b> firms have a relatively strong preference for specialised clusters of <b>business</b> <b>services</b> firms, conditional on density of economic activity. A standard deviation increase in <b>business</b> <b>services</b> specialisation of a location leads to a 40 percent increase in the probability that a <b>business</b> <b>services</b> firm locates there, supporting theories of Marshall, Arrow and Romer. <b>Business</b> <b>services</b> firms also have a preference to locate near a group of firms that belong to the same sector, not necessarily <b>business</b> <b>services</b> firms, so diversity is negatively related to location decisions.

40|$|The <b>business</b> <b>services</b> sector {{plays an}} {{increasingly}} important role in enhancing a country’s competitiveness. Reduced product cycles times, prompt delivery, and improved customer services are crucial {{for the survival of}} firms, and in particular exporters, in a competitive environment. As a result, the service content of final exports is increasing. In traditional and high-labor intensive sectors, it is the creation of a brand, design and marketing to play a central role, whereas in technology-intensive sectors, this role is played by R&D and after sale assistance. Recently, in line with developments at world level, the Italian economy has witnessed a significant increase of <b>business</b> <b>services.</b> In the EU’s total supply of <b>business</b> <b>services,</b> however, Italy still occupies a relatively weak position, and the average size of Italian <b>business</b> <b>services</b> firms is below the European one. Such features, given the relevance of services in firms’ competitiveness and in internationalization trends may represent a factor of weakness for the Italian economy. This book recommends to invest resources in <b>business</b> <b>services</b> to “support” production activities: it highlights which services may “contribute” the most to the internationalization process; therefore helping to formulate adequate economic policies. The book also shows that the supply of <b>business</b> <b>services</b> is highly diversified across regions and categories, in terms of both endowment and access. Only by reducing these differences, the country’s competitiveness can be improved.
