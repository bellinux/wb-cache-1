50|$|The olive flounder, <b>bastard</b> <b>halibut</b> or Japanese halibut (Paralichthys olivaceus) is a {{temperate}} {{marine species}} of large-tooth flounder {{native to the}} north-western Pacific Ocean.|$|E

40|$|The {{underwater}} sound environment {{in shallow water}} area was complicated by time and depth under the influences of the biological and artificial noises from land and sea, e. g., trains, cars, feeding, cruising boats, etc. The {{purpose of this study}} is to clarify the underwater noise background and the {{underwater sound}} environment weighted by auditory sensation of fish in Kagoshima Bay. The emitted noise by drifting and cruising vessels has the largest influence on the underwater sound environment in shallow water area. There were recorded the vertical underwater noise by drifting vessel and approaching noise by cruising vessel. The transmission rays of underwater noise by drifting vessel have two directions, i. e., direct and reflected rays; interference occurs while receiving the two direction sound waves with a hydrophone simultaneously. As an interference theory of underwater sound in shallow water was obtained as an equation with the range of transmission rays from drifting and cruising vessels to hydrophone for the reflection number. A comparison between theoretical and actual interference was made with a measurement of the ambient noise and traffic value in the heavy traffic area of Kagoshima Port. It was confirmed that the main noise was emitted by vessels, and the characteristic noise was temporal and sharply increased. In the biological noise, the underwater sounds measured in net cages at a culture ground were analyzed by the zerocrossing method to obtain the period change, power, and continuation time of swimming sounds by fish. The audiogram of a <b>bastard</b> <b>halibut</b> Paralichthys olivaceus was measured by a classical respiratory conditioning technique. The hearing response of <b>bastard</b> <b>halibut</b> was also measured by sweeping sound, and clarified the upper limit frequency of hearing. The lowest threshold of <b>bastard</b> <b>halibut</b> was at about 100 Hz and the threshold increased rapidly at 200 - 400 Hz. The ambient noises are mainly broadband and appears under 3 kHz of fine auditory sensation in fish. The hearing ability differs among fishes, thereby the underwater sound environment also differs. Arrangement was made on the frequency-weighted characteristics for auditory sensation of fish, fish weighting using these audiograms, in comparison with the underwater sound environment and underwater noise level of each fish. The fish weighting of <b>bastard</b> <b>halibut</b> is a type of low frequency with narrow band; the underwater noise level is strongly affected by emphasis on the interference level of low frequency. The fish weighting of a Japanese horse mackerel Trachurus japonicus is a type of high frequency with wide band; the underwater sound environment is influenced by the interference with wide band, but a small effect on variation of the underwater noise level. ...|$|E
40|$|Relationships between fish {{size and}} otolith {{measures}} were analysed in four species from the south-eastern Yellow Sea: marbled flounder Pseudopleuronectes yokohamae (Günther, 1877), <b>bastard</b> <b>halibut</b> Paralichthys olivaceus (Temminck & Schlegel, 1846) (Pleuronectiformes), and Korean rockfish Sebastes schlegelii Hilgendorf, 1880, and greenling, Hexagrammos otakii Jordan & Starks, 1895 (Scorpaeniformes). The {{analysis of covariance}} (ANCOVA) {{was used to test}} the effect of the categorical factor sex in the fish weight and total length relationship. Significant difference in fish weight and total length relationship between males and females was highlighted in P. yokohamae only. The relationship between fish standard length and total length was described by means of a linear regression model, while the relationships between fish weight-total length, otolith length-fish total length, otolith weight-length, and otolith width-length were analysed by means of non-linear models. 7 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{fractionation}} of {{serine protease}} inhibitor (SPI) from fish roe extracts {{was carried out}} using polyethylene glycol- 4000 (PEG 4000) precipitation. The protease inhibitory activity of extracts and PEG fractions from Alaska pollock (AP), <b>bastard</b> <b>halibut</b> (BH), skipjack tuna (ST), and yellowfin tuna (YT) roes were determined against target proteases. All of the roe extracts showed inhibitory activity toward bromelain (BR), chymotrypsin (CH), trypsin (TR), papain-EDTA (PED), and alcalase (AL) as target proteases. PEG fractions, which have positive inhibitory activity and high recovery (%), were the PEG 1 fraction (0 – 5  %, w/v) against cysteine proteases (BR and PA) and the PEG 4 fraction (20 – 40  %, w/v) against serine proteases (CH and TR). The strongest specific inhibitory activity toward CH and TR of PEG 4 fractions was AP (9278 and 1170  U/mg) followed by ST (6687 and 2064  U/mg), YT (3951 and 1536  U/mg), and BH (538 and 98  U/mg). The inhibitory activity of serine protease in extracts and PEG fractions from fish roe was stronger than that of cysteine protease toward common casein substrate. Therefore, SPI is mainly distributed in fish roe and PEG fractionation effectively isolated the SPI from fish roes...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{actively}} stimulating devices (ASD) on juvenile flatfish escape were studied to increase escape rates from the cod end by encouraging fish {{to approach the}} net wall. Two kinds of ASD were designed: a fluttering net panel, i. e., a free-end flag-like net panel, and a double conical rope array. Escape responses of juvenile <b>bastard</b> <b>halibut</b> were observed in a circulating water channel using two model cod ends, one made with diamond-shaped 43 -mm-mesh-size polyethylene (PE) as a high-contrast cod end {{and the other with}} polyamid (PA) mono-ply as a low-contrast cod end. Retention rate was significantly lower with the double conical rope-array ASD in the PE cod end than with conventional PE cod ends only or the fluttering net-panel ASD inside the PE cod end. Mean retention rate with the low-contrast PA cod end was also significantly lower than that with the high-contrast PE conventional cod end. Therefore, active fluttering devices using a double conical rope array together with less visible low-contrast netting in the cod end could help to reduce the bycatch of juvenile flatfish by weakening their optomotor response and actively driving fish to the side net panel...|$|E
