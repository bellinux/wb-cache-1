The radionuclide distribution coefficient between solid and interstitial water phases of soil {{was used as a}} parameter of radionuclide mobility. Redistribution of radionuclides in the soil profile, soil-plant, soil-environmental water systems to a great extent depends on this parameter. Determinations of I 3 7 Cs, *°Sr, 2 3 9 - 2 4 0 Pu and 2 4 l A m in soils, interstitial soil solutions and estimation of distribution coefficients have been realized. The soil samples were taken in areas of Gomel, Mogilev and <b>Brest</b> <b>regions</b> of Belarus that were contaminated with radionuclides of Chernobyl origin.

50|$|On 22 June 1941 {{the units}} of the {{division}} were in several places within the <b>Brest</b> covering <b>region.</b> The 459th Rifle Regiment, 472nd Artillery Regiment, 4th Antitank Battalion, and the 3rd Medical Battalion were in their training area around Zhabinka. The remaining units were based in the Brest Fortress and the immediate surrounding areas. The massive artillery strike by the German 4th Army's 45th Infantry Division at 0400 on 22 June disrupted many of the division's units located inside the fortress. Many units inside the fortress dispersed into scattered groups and the division lost {{a significant number of}} personnel and most of its equipment. The 393rd Separate Antiaircraft Artillery Battalion escaped from the fortress with three of its guns, but no ammunition for them. In the Zhabinka training area the division managed to gather together two battalions of the 44th and 455th Rifle Regiments (mostly without weapons), as well as vehicles from the 7th Motorized Infantry Company of the 84th Reconnaissance Battalion. The rest of the division's surviving members were consolidated into a small number of groups, who either took up the Defense of Brest Fortress or joined the 22nd Tank Division on the outskirts of Zhabenko in an attack to relieve the siege of Brest.|$|R

2500|$|The French fleet {{was only}} lightly damaged {{and had only}} taken light {{casualties}} of 29 men killed and wounded. Villaret continued the fleet's passage eastwards, rounding Penmarck Point and entering Audierne Bay on the passage north towards <b>Brest</b> when the <b>region</b> {{was hit by a}} fierce 27-hour gale, driving the French fleet southwards and dispersing them across the coastline. Over the ensuing days Villaret was able to reconstitute his fleet in the anchorage off Belle Île where Vence had laid up on 8 June. [...] When the fleet was all assembled, Villaret again ordered it to sail north in an effort to regain Brest. His fleet had originally sailed from Brest in such a rush due to the perceived danger to Vence's squadron that it was only carrying 15 days worth of provisions on board and had now been at sea for ten days, making a return to Brest a priority. At 03:30 on 22 June, as the French fleet passed north along the coast, the British Channel Fleet appeared to the northwest, Bridport having discovered the French fleet absent from Brest and cast southwards to protect the Quiberon invasion convoy.|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} a full-scale {{experimental study of}} a yacht rig and sails in real upwind sailing conditions and a comparison with Fluid Structure Interaction (FSI) simulations with the ARAVANTI model (Finite Element Method for the structure and Vortex Lattice Method for the fluid). An specific on-board instrumentation system simultaneously measures loads in the rig and sails, sailing data (wind, boat attitude and speed) and the shape of sails in real navigation conditions (flying shape). Flying shape parameters are extracted using the camera-based VSPARS system to characterize the effects of sail trims and to {{be compared with the}} results of the simulation. The potential flow solver gives fast and accurate predictions of both the flying shape and the loads in the rig in most conditions. The inviscid approach, commonly used in the early stage of design, must be checked, as in particular cases where the sails are heavily loaded, flow separation is significant and results from a potential flow solver are inaccurate. A new version of the model including the heel angle as an additional degree of freedom in the structural solver enables to detect when the inviscid flow approach overestimates the aerodynamic load. This upgrade improves the utility and reliability of the inviscid flow approach which remains relevant at the early stages of design as it is much more cost-effective than RANS models. <b>Brest</b> Métropole Océane, <b>Région</b> Bretagne and the European Union’s Seventh Framework Programme (FP 7 / 2007 - 2013) under REA grant agreement PCOFUND-GA- 2013 - 609102 (PRESTIGE-Campus France...|$|R

40|$|Radon is {{the major}} {{contributor}} to the background exposure of the population. In the world practice, the radon risk or radon potential mapping are used for the radon dose assessment. The aim of this work was a radon danger mapping of the Republic of Belarus to assess the radiation situation and determine the radon hazard critical areas. Materials and methods: The mapping is based on measured values of radon volume activity in the living rooms of different buildings on {{the territory of the}} six regions of the Republic of Belarus. We have performed more than 4000 measurements. Integral track radon radiometers based on the polymer Kodak LR- 115 film were used to evaluate radon volume activity. Exposure time ranged from 90 to 120 days. The cartogram was built with using the MAPINFO software package. Results: The low levels of radon concentrations were determined in the <b>Brest</b> and Gomel <b>regions,</b> {{as well as in the}} southern districts of Minsk and south-western districts of the Mogilev region. The high levels radon concentrations were determined in some districts of the Vitebsk and Grodno regions, as well as in the north-eastern districts of the Mogilev region. About 2 – 5 times nonuniformity of radon distribution in settlements of the Republic was observed. The radon hazard critical areas with radon concentrations in the range of 200 – 400 Bq/m 3 were found in some districts of the Vitebsk, Grodno and Mogilev regions. Conclusions: The radon risk map of the Republic of Belarus gives the possibility to estimate the existing radiation risk. Taking into account the low efficiency of countermeasures long after the Chernobyl accident, it is necessary to increase the level of radiation protection through the radon mitigation activities or to change the radon normative documents. </p...|$|R
