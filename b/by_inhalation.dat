5|$|Mercury {{poisoning}} {{can result}} from exposure to water-soluble forms of mercury (such as mercuric chloride or methylmercury), <b>by</b> <b>inhalation</b> of mercury vapor, or by ingesting any form of mercury.|$|E
5|$|People can {{be exposed}} to indium in the {{workplace}} <b>by</b> <b>inhalation,</b> ingestion, skin contact, and eye contact. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 0.1mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday.|$|E
5|$|Contact {{with skin}} is dangerous, and {{adequate}} ventilation {{should be provided}} when melting this metal. Thallium(I) compounds have a high aqueous solubility and are readily absorbed through the skin. Exposure <b>by</b> <b>inhalation</b> should not exceed 0.1mg per cubic metre in an 8-hour time-weighted average (40-hour work week). Thallium will readily absorb through the skin and care {{should be taken to}} avoid this route of exposure as cutaneous absorption can exceed the absorbed dose received <b>by</b> <b>inhalation</b> at the PEL. Thallium is a suspected human carcinogen. For a long time thallium compounds were readily available as rat poison. This fact and that it is water-soluble and nearly tasteless led to frequent intoxication caused by accident or criminal intent.|$|E
30|$|The {{predisposition}} to MH and the induction of MH <b>by</b> volatile <b>inhalation</b> anesthesia, {{but not in}} the second surgery using TIVA, indicate that MH in our patient was induced <b>by</b> volatile <b>inhalation</b> anesthetics.|$|R
50|$|In total, 66 {{people were}} injured, mostly <b>by</b> smoke <b>inhalation.</b> Of these, 27 were hospitalized. One {{firefighter}} (Battalion Chief Gunther E Beake) was severely affected <b>by</b> smoke <b>inhalation</b> {{and died of}} his injuries on 23 August 1949.|$|R
50|$|It is toxic <b>by</b> ingestion, <b>inhalation,</b> {{and skin}} absorption.|$|R
5|$|Osmium tetroxide {{is highly}} {{volatile}} and penetrates skin readily, {{and is very}} toxic <b>by</b> <b>inhalation,</b> ingestion, and skin contact. Airborne low concentrations of osmium tetroxide vapor can cause lung congestion and skin or eye damage, and should therefore {{be used in a}} fume hood. Osmium tetroxide is rapidly reduced to relatively inert compounds by polyunsaturated vegetable oils, such as corn oil.|$|E
5|$|The mucosal {{lining of}} the trachea may also be injured <b>by</b> <b>inhalation</b> of hot gases or harmful fumes such as {{chlorine}} gas. This can lead to edema (swelling), necrosis (death of the tissue), scar formation, and ultimately stenosis. However, TBI due to inhalation, foreign body aspiration, and medical procedures is uncommon.|$|E
5|$|There {{is little}} {{evidence}} that vanadium or vanadium compounds are reproductive toxins or teratogens. Vanadium pentoxide was reported to be carcinogenic in male rats and in male and female mice <b>by</b> <b>inhalation</b> in an NTP study, although the interpretation of the results has recently been disputed. The carcinogenicity of vanadium has not been determined by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.|$|E

5|$|People can {{be exposed}} to iodine in the {{workplace}} <b>by</b> <b>inhalation,</b> ingestion, skin contact, and eye contact. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the legal limit (Permissible exposure limit) for iodine exposure in the workplace at 0.1 ppm (1mg/m3) during an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a Recommended exposure limit (REL) of 0.1 ppm (1mg/m3) during an 8-hour workday. At levels of 2 ppm, iodine is immediately dangerous to life and health.|$|E
5|$|People can {{be exposed}} to rhodium in the {{workplace}} <b>by</b> <b>inhalation.</b> The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has specified the legal limit (Permissible exposure limit) for rhodium exposure in the workplace at 0.1mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday, and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set the recommended exposure limit (REL), at the same level. At levels of 100mg/m3, rhodium is immediately dangerous to life or health. For soluble compounds, the PEL and REL are both 0.001mg/m3.|$|E
5|$|A {{commonly}} cited quote by Ralph Nader {{states that}} {{a pound of}} plutonium dust spread into the atmosphere {{would be enough to}} kill 8 billion people. However, calculations show that one pound of plutonium could kill no more than 2 million people <b>by</b> <b>inhalation.</b> This makes the toxicity of plutonium roughly equivalent with that of nerve gas. Nader's views were challenged in 1976 by Bernard Cohen, as described in the book Nuclear Power, Both Sides: The Best Arguments for and Against the Most Controversial Technology. Cohen's own estimate is that a dose of 200micrograms would likely be necessary to cause cancer.|$|E

25|$|Concerns {{have also}} been raised {{regarding}} the toxicity of surgical smoke produced by electrosurgery. This {{has been shown to}} contain chemicals which may cause harm <b>by</b> <b>inhalation</b> by the patients, surgeon or operating theatre staff.|$|E
25|$|Deaths have {{resulted}} from accidental exposure to fumigation materials containing aluminum phosphide or phosphine. Phosphine gas attacks the central nervous system, much as military nerve gases do. It can be absorbed either <b>by</b> <b>inhalation</b> or through the skin.|$|E
25|$|Like {{many other}} {{volatile}} substances, carbon tetrachloride {{is prone to}} misuse <b>by</b> <b>inhalation,</b> due to its possible depressant and/or dissociative effect upon the central nervous system. Use of carbon tetrachloride in this manner presents serious health risks, and may result in toxic effects described above.|$|E

50|$|On December 21, 2015, a {{major fire}} broke out at the museum, {{damaging}} the building and killing one firefighter <b>by</b> smoke <b>inhalation.</b>|$|R
50|$|Pneumoconiosis is an {{occupational}} lung disease and a restrictive lung disease caused <b>by</b> the <b>inhalation</b> of dust, often in mines and from agriculture.|$|R
25|$|DCM is also metabolized by {{the body}} to carbon {{monoxide}} potentially leading to carbon monoxide poisoning. Acute exposure <b>by</b> <b>inhalation</b> has resulted in optic neuropathy and hepatitis. Prolonged skin contact can result in DCM dissolving some of the fatty tissues in skin, resulting in skin irritation or chemical burns.|$|E
25|$|After the {{material}} has passed, a veterinarian {{may try to}} prevent the onset of aspiration pneumonia by placing the horse on broad-spectrum antibiotics. The animal should be monitored for several days {{to ensure that it}} does not develop pneumonia, caused <b>by</b> <b>inhalation</b> of bacteria-rich food material into the lungs.|$|E
25|$|Sources of the causative {{agents are}} aquatic systems and potting soil. The first {{outbreak}} caused <b>by</b> <b>inhalation</b> of aersolized potting soil {{was discovered in}} New Zealand in January 2007. A total of 10 workers at a nursery came down with Pontiac fever. It was the first identification of L. longbeachae.|$|E

25|$|The Transbay Tube {{was closed}} from January 17 to April 4, 1979, after a train caught {{fire in the}} tube, {{injuring}} dozens, killing a fireman, and damaging equipment. Most of the injuries were caused <b>by</b> <b>inhalation</b> of toxic smoke from the burning polyurethane in the seats, leading to a $118,000 replacement program which was completed in November 1980.|$|E
25|$|Thiomersal is {{very toxic}} <b>by</b> <b>inhalation,</b> ingestion, and {{in contact with}} skin (EC hazard symbol T+), with a danger of {{cumulative}} effects. It is also very toxic to aquatic organisms and may cause long-term adverse effects in aquatic environments (EC hazard symbol N). In the body, it is metabolized or degraded to ethylmercury (C2H5Hg+) and thiosalicylate.|$|E
50|$|PBO {{has a low}} acute {{toxicity}} <b>by</b> oral, <b>inhalation,</b> and dermal routes. It is minimally irritating to the eyes and skin. It is a not a skin sensitizer.|$|R
40|$|Thinners are {{chemical}} mixtures used as industrial solvents. Humans {{can come}} into contact with thinner by occupational exposure or <b>by</b> intentional <b>inhalation</b> abuse. Thinner sniffing causes damage to the brain, kidney, liver, lung, and reproductive system. We discuss some proposed mechanism by which thinner induces damage. Recently, the induction of oxidative stress has been suggested as a possible mechanism of damage. This paper reviews the current evidence for oxidative stress effects induced <b>by</b> thinner <b>inhalation.</b> Early ideas about the effects of thinner on lipids are discussed in one section. We discuss several studies that have shown the oxidative effects of thinner inhalation on: lipid peroxidation, levels of antioxidant enzymes, glutathione depletion, and oxidation of proteins and DNA. We have also included studies about oxidative stress effects induced by toluene, the principal component (60 - 70 %) of thinner. Finally, work describing the effects of oxidative stress induced <b>by</b> thinner <b>inhalation</b> on different organs is discussed...|$|R
