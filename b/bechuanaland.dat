5|$|Before 1923, Coghlan {{had opposed}} the {{amalgamation}} of Northern and Southern Rhodesia, concerned {{that it would}} make responsible government harder to attain. One outcome of the Jameson Raid in 1895–96 had been to prevent the concentration of the BSAC into one administration. Instead, the High Commission in <b>Bechuanaland</b> was maintained, Northern Rhodesia kept its own administration, and Britain oversaw BSAC affairs more closely. One year into his premiership, Coghlan began to consider territorial expansion and staked a claim to northwestern <b>Bechuanaland.</b> The Dominions Office rejected the claim {{on the grounds that the}} Union of South Africa would respond with its own claim for the southern half of the territory.|$|E
5|$|Maund left Kimberley in July, {{well ahead}} of the Rudd party. Rudd's {{negotiating}} team, armed with Robinson's endorsement, was still far from ready—they left Kimberley only on 15 August—but Moffat, travelling from Shoshong in <b>Bechuanaland,</b> was ahead of both expeditions. He reached Bulawayo in late August to find the kraal filled with white concession-hunters. The various bidders attempted to woo the king {{with a series of}} gifts and favours, but won little to show for it.|$|E
5|$|This notice was {{published}} in the <b>Bechuanaland</b> News and Malmani Chronicle on 2 February 1889. A grand indaba of the izinDuna and the whites of Bulawayo was soon convened, but because Helm and Thompson were not present, the start of the investigation was delayed until 11 March. As in the negotiations with Rudd and Thompson in October, Lobengula did not himself attend, remaining close by but not interfering. The izinDuna questioned Helm and Thompson at great length, and various white men gave their opinions on the concession. A group of missionaries acted as mediators. Condemnation of the concession was led not by the izinDuna, but by the other whites, particularly Tainton.|$|E

5|$|Guest {{joined up}} again, enlisting in Kitchener's Fighting Scouts on 2 January 1901. He {{was given the}} rank of Sergeant, chasing Boer commandoes without success. He was {{recommended}} for a commission and posted to the Johannesburg Mounted Rifles, whose Colonel decided that Guest {{was too young to}} lead a force composed of miners who were considerably older than him. Returning to Klerksdorp, Guest learned that the <b>Bechuanaland</b> Rifles were recruiting experienced officers; he went to Mafeking and was accepted into the unit, with whom he served {{until the end of the}} war. The Rifles were part of a mobile force, the Divisional Scouting Corps, whose function was to round up Boer detachments and to execute Kitchener's scorched earth policy, destroying Boer farm buildings and crops, and detaining women and children in concentration camps.|$|E
5|$|Jameson did {{not regard}} this {{ambiguity}} as a proper answer, and impatiently waited for further {{word from the}} king. After standing by for the specified two days and receiving nothing, he correctly concluded that Lobengula was stalling him, and using the extra time {{to distance himself from}} his former capital. Jameson therefore made good on his pledge, and called for volunteers; he assembled a host of about 470 men, mixed together from the Mashonaland Mounted Police, the <b>Bechuanaland</b> Border Police, and Raaff's Rangers, an independent unit led by the eponymous Commandant Piet Raaff. This force was placed under Forbes's command, with three Maxim guns attached. Jameson told the major to scout the area between Shiloh and Inyati for spoor, with the ultimate objective of capturing Lobengula, and sent him out just before sunset on 14 November 1893.|$|E
5|$|Lobengula impassively acquiesced to the {{expedition}} {{at the behest}} of his friend Jameson, much to the fury of many of the izinDuna, who saw the column's march to Mashonaland as an appropriation of Matabele territory. Led by Major Frank Johnson and the famed hunter Frederick Courteney Selous, and escorted by 500 British South Africa Company's Police under Lieutenant-Colonel Edward Pennefather, the pioneers skirted their way around Lobengula's heartlands, heading north-east from <b>Bechuanaland</b> and then north, and founded Fort Tuli, Fort Victoria and Fort Charter along the way. They stopped {{at the site of the}} future capital, Fort Salisbury (named after the Prime Minister), on 12 September 1890, and ceremonially raised the Union Jack the next morning.|$|E

5|$|Rhodes faced {{competition}} for the Matabeleland mining concession from George Cawston and Lord Gifford, two London financiers. They appointed as their agent Edward Arthur Maund, who had served with Sir Charles Warren in <b>Bechuanaland</b> between 1884 and 1885, {{towards the end of}} this time visiting Lobengula as an official British envoy. Cawston and Gifford's base in England gave them the advantage of better connections with Whitehall, while Rhodes's location in the Cape allowed him to see the situation with his own eyes. He also possessed formidable financial capital and closer links with the relevant colonial administrators. In May 1888, Cawston and Gifford wrote to Lord Knutsford, the British Colonial Secretary, seeking his approval for their designs.|$|E
5|$|Rhodes {{sent the}} first {{shipments}} of rifles up to <b>Bechuanaland</b> in January and February 1889, sending 250 each month, and instructed Jameson, Dr Frederick Rutherfoord Harris and a Shoshong trader, George Musson, to convey them to Bulawayo. Lobengula {{had so far}} accepted the financial payments described in the Rudd Concession (and continued {{to do so for}} years afterwards), but when the guns arrived in early April, he refused to take them. Jameson placed the weapons under a canvas cover in Maguire's camp, stayed at the kraal for ten days, and then went back south with Maguire in tow, leaving the rifles behind. A few weeks later, Lobengula dictated a letter for Fairbairn to write to the Queen—he said he had never intended to sign away mineral rights and that he and his izinDuna revoked their recognition of the document.|$|E
5|$|The patrol {{comprised}} {{elements of}} the Mashonaland Mounted Police and the <b>Bechuanaland</b> Border Police. Scouting ahead of Major Patrick Forbes's column attempting the capture of the Matabele King Lobengula (following his flight from his capital Bulawayo a month before), it crossed the Shangani late on 3 December 1893. It moved on Lobengula the next morning, but was ambushed {{by a host of}} Matabele riflemen and warriors near the king's wagon. Surrounded and outnumbered about a hundred-fold, the patrol made a last stand as three of its number broke out and rode back to the river to muster reinforcements from Forbes. However, the Shangani had risen significantly in flood, and Forbes was himself involved in a skirmish near the southern bank; Wilson and his men therefore remained isolated to the north. After fighting to the last cartridge, and killing over ten times their own number, they were annihilated.|$|E
5|$|The ANC {{decided to}} send Mandela as a {{delegate}} to the February 1962 meeting of the Pan-African Freedom Movement for East, Central and Southern Africa (PAFMECSA) in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Leaving South Africa in secret via <b>Bechuanaland,</b> on his way Mandela visited Tanganyika and met with its president, Julius Nyerere. Arriving in Ethiopia, Mandela met with Emperor Haile Selassie I, and gave his speech after Selassie's at the conference. After the symposium, he travelled to Cairo, Egypt, admiring the political reforms of President Gamal Abdel Nasser, {{and then went to}} Tunis, Tunisia, where President Habib Bourguiba gave him £5,000 for weaponry. He proceeded to Morocco, Mali, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Senegal, receiving funds from Liberian President William Tubman and Guinean President Ahmed Sékou Touré. Leaving Africa for London, England, he met anti-apartheid activists, reporters, and prominent politicians. Returning to Ethiopia, he began a six-month course in guerrilla warfare, but completed only two months before being recalled to South Africa by the ANC's leadership.|$|E

25|$|The {{duration}} of the <b>Bechuanaland</b> Campaign was from 24 December 1896 to 30 July 1897. In April 1896, a severe outbreak of cattle disease occurred, which required that all cattle in the area needed to be slaughtered {{in an attempt to}} contain the disease. This was resented by the local Tswana population who, as a result, rose up in protest. A number of engagements occurred and, following a build-up of more Colonial reinforcements in July 1897, the conflict ended after a final action at Langberg on 30 July and 1 August 1897, in which most of the Tswana leaders were either killed or surrendered. Veterans of this campaign were awarded the <b>Bechuanaland</b> Clasp.|$|E
25|$|The Cape of Good Hope General Service Medal is a British {{campaign}} medal {{which was}} awarded {{to members of the}} Cape Colonial Forces who took part in three campaigns in and around the Cape of Good Hope, in Basutoland in 1880–1881, in Transkei in 1880–1881 and in <b>Bechuanaland</b> in 1896–1897.|$|E
25|$|A wholly {{landlocked}} area, Rhodesia was {{bordered by}} South Africa to the south, <b>Bechuanaland</b> (later Botswana) to the southwest, Zambia to the northwest, and Mozambique (a Portuguese province until 1975) to the east. The state {{was named after}} Cecil Rhodes, whose British South Africa Company acquired the land in the late 19th century.|$|E
25|$|In 1890, Rhodes sent a {{group of}} settlers, known as the Pioneer Column, into Mashonaland. The 400+ man Pioneer Column was guided by the {{explorer}} and big game hunter Frederick Selous and was officially designated the British South Africa Company Police (BSACP) accompanied by about 100 <b>Bechuanaland</b> Border Police (BBP). When they reached Harari Hill, they founded Fort Salisbury (now Harare). Rhodes had been distributing land to the settlers even before the royal charter, but the charter legitimized his further actions with the British government. By 1891 an Order-in-Council declared Matabeleland, Mashonaland, and <b>Bechuanaland</b> a British protectorate. By 1892, {{the number of men}} in the force had decreased and the BSACP was replaced by a number of volunteer forces - the Mashonaland Horse, the Mashonaland Mounted Police and the Mashonaland Constabulary, and later additions of Salisbury Horse, Victoria Rangers, and Raaf's Rangers. The BSACP was later renamed the British South Africa Police (BSAP) and this force stayed together for much of the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, Creech Jones succeeded in {{reconciling}} Seretse Khama (who had been exiled from <b>Bechuanaland</b> after marrying an Englishwoman) with his uncle Tshekedi, and petitioned {{the government to}} rescind the exile order. He also led delegations to the Government from the Anti-Slavery Society (of which he was Vice-President) and the Africa Bureau. He was Chairman of the British Council of Pacific Relations from 1952.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the award}} of the medal {{had to be}} applied for, it was not awarded posthumously. The {{next-of-kin}} of members {{who had been killed}} in action or who had died while on service therefore received no medal. The published medal roll shows that 5,252 medals were awarded to 5,156 individuals, which included 96 duplicate or triplicate awards. Nearly half of the awards, to 2,422 individuals, were for the <b>Bechuanaland</b> campaign.|$|E
25|$|Wade took an {{interest}} in international affairs, challenging the Attlee government on its treatment of Seretse Khama in <b>Bechuanaland.</b> He {{was a member of the}} All-Party Parliamentary Committee on World Government and went as a delegate to the Congress on World Government in 1951. The same year he complained about the 'colour bar' being operated by British Rail and the National Union of Railwaymen, preventing black immigrants from working in certain posts.|$|E
25|$|In 1964 Kerina {{returned}} from the US for an unsuccessful attempt to enter Namibia. He stayed in <b>Bechuanaland</b> (today Botswana) for a while but soon was expelled from there and moved to Tanzania. In September 1965 the National Unity Democratic Organisation (NUDO) was founded by Kerina, Clemens Kapuuo, and Hosea Kutako. NUDO {{at that time was}} an organisation that had mainly Herero followers. It was created at the suggestion of the Herero Chiefs' Council.|$|E
25|$|The Cape of Good Hope General Service Medal was {{authorised}} in December 1900 as {{a retrospective}} award for veterans of three campaigns which were fought in South Africa between 1880 and 1897. The medal was for award to the officers, non-commissioned officers and {{men of the}} Colonial Forces who were engaged on active service during the campaigns in Basutoland (1880–1881), Tembuland and Griqualand East in Transkei (1880–1881), and <b>Bechuanaland</b> (1896–1897). Three campaign clasps were authorised at the same time.|$|E
25|$|In November 1895, a {{piece of}} {{territory}} of strategic importance, the Pitsani Strip, part of the <b>Bechuanaland</b> Protectorate and bordering the Transvaal, was ceded to the British South Africa Company by the Colonial Office, overtly {{for the protection of}} a railway running through the territory. Cecil Rhodes, the Prime Minister of the Cape Colony and managing director of the Company was eager to bring South Africa under British dominion, and encouraged the disenfranchised Uitlanders of the Boer republics to resist Afrikaner domination.|$|E
25|$|In 1965, {{the capital}} of the <b>Bechuanaland</b> Protectorate moved from Mafeking to Gaberones. When Botswana gained its independence, Lobatse was the first choice as the nation's capital. However, Lobatse was deemed too limited, and instead, a new capital city would be created next to Gaberones. The city was chosen because of its {{proximity}} to a fresh water source, its proximity to the railway to Pretoria, its central location among the central tribes, and its lack of association with those surrounding tribes.|$|E
25|$|There was {{considerable}} unrest in Cape Colony {{in the period}} from 1878 to 1885 – sparked {{in part by the}} attempts of the British Colonial Office to impose a system of confederation on Southern Africa and to disarm all Africans in the Cape. In a short period of time, there was the Anglo-Zulu War, chronic troubles with the Basutos (which prompted the Cape to relinquish control of Basutoland to the imperial authorities) as well as a series of conflicts with the Xhosa which were followed by the First Boer War of 1881 and the <b>Bechuanaland</b> disturbances of 1884.|$|E
25|$|Methuen {{served in}} the {{expedition}} of Sir Charles Warren to <b>Bechuanaland</b> in 1884 to 1885, where he commanded Methuen's Horse, a corps of mounted rifles. He became deputy adjutant-general, in South Africa in 1888, and having been promoted to major general on 21 May 1890, he succeeded his father as 3rd baron in 1891. He became Major-General commanding the Brigade of Guards and General Officer Commanding the Home District in April 1892 and then served as press censor at headquarters on the Tirah expedition in 1897. Promoted to lieutenant general on 1 April 1898, {{he was given the}} command of the 1st Division on the outbreak of the Second Boer War.|$|E
25|$|In 1881, the 1st {{was in the}} West Indies; {{it moved}} to South Africa in 1884, when it saw action in the <b>Bechuanaland</b> campaign, and {{remained}} there until 1891, when it {{moved back to the}} UK to serve as the depot battalion and the 2nd moved out to India, where it remained until 1909. With the outbreak of the Second Anglo-Boer War, the 1st was quickly earmarked for service in South Africa, and sailed in late 1899. It remained there until 1903, being joined by the 3rd from 1900 to 1902 – the first time a non-regular unit of the regiment had been activated. The bulk of the time in South Africa was spent patrolling and in mobile columns, with neither battalion engaged in any major battles.|$|E
25|$|In December 1884, by now a lieutenant-colonel, Warren {{was sent}} as HM Special Commissioner to command a {{military}} expedition to <b>Bechuanaland,</b> to assert British sovereignty {{in the face}} of encroachments from Germany and the Transvaal, and to suppress the Boer freebooter states of Stellaland and Goshen, which were backed by the Transvaal and were stealing land and cattle from the local Tswana tribes. Becoming known as the Warren Expedition, the force of 4,000 British and local troops headed north from Cape Town, accompanied by the first three observation balloons ever used by the British Army in the field. The expedition achieved its aims without bloodshed, and Warren was recalled in September 1885 and appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG) on 4 October 1885.|$|E
25|$|Norman-Walker {{stayed in}} the Malawi {{government}} until 1965 when he was appointed Her Majesty's Commissioner of the <b>Bechuanaland</b> Protectorate in June. Before this appointment was made, the Protectorate had been steadily {{on the way to}} independence. The capital city of the Protectorate was relocated from South Africa's Mafikeng to the Protectorate's Gaborone in February 1965. A month later self-rule was granted to the Protectorate. Norman-Walker was the last Commissioner of the Protectorate and was there to prepare for the independence, though he had very little to do in his short tenure. He was made a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in the New Year Honours List of 1966 and he witnessed the independence of the Republic of Botswana on 30 September 1966.|$|E
25|$|Whether by {{or against}} the wish of the home government, the limits of British {{authority}} continued to extend. The Basotho, who dwelt in the upper valleys of the Orange River, had subsisted under a semi-protectorate of the British government from 1843 to 1854; but having been {{left to their own}} resources on the abandonment of the Orange sovereignty, they fell into a long exhaustive warfare with the Boers of the Orange Free State. On the urgent petition of their chief Moshesh, they were proclaimed British subjects in 1868, and their territory became part of the Cape Colony in 1871 (see Basutoland). In the same year, the southeastern part of <b>Bechuanaland</b> was annexed to Britain under the title of Griqualand West. This annexation was a consequence of the discovery there of rich diamond mines, an event which was destined to have far-reaching results.|$|E
25|$|Chief {{among the}} {{endeavours}} {{pursued by the}} Company during its early years were the construction of railroads and telegraph wires across the territory it governed. These respective arteries of transport and communication, vital both for the successful development of the new country and for the realisation of Rhodes's Cape to Cairo dream, were laid across the previously bare Rhodesian landscape with great speed. Strategically planned, the railways were not intended or expected {{to turn a profit}} during their early years; their construction was largely subsidised by the Company. The telegraph line from Mafeking in South Africa reached Salisbury—one third of the way from Cape Town to Cairo—in February 1892. Just under six years later, in December 1897, the <b>Bechuanaland</b> railway from Vryburg reached Bulawayo, making it possible to travel between the Cape and Rhodesia by train.|$|E
25|$|During {{the years}} {{immediately}} following the Anglo-Boer wars, Britain set about unifying the four colonies including the former Boer republics into a single self-governed country called the Union of South Africa. This was accomplished {{after several years of}} negotiations, when the South Africa Act 1909 consolidated the Cape Colony, Natal, Transvaal, and Orange Free State into one nation. Under the provisions of the act, the Union became an independent Dominion of the British Empire, governed under a form of constitutional monarchy, with the British monarch represented by a Governor-General. Prosecutions before the courts of the Union of South Africa were instituted {{in the name of the}} Crown and government officials served in the name of the Crown. The British High Commission territories of Basutoland (now Lesotho), and <b>Bechuanaland</b> (now Botswana), Swaziland continued under direct rule from Britain.|$|E
