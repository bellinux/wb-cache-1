5|$|Jackson used a <b>battery-powered,</b> GPS-equipped Segway in Washington. Jackson, {{who missed}} two votes {{in his first}} {{thirteen}} years in Congress, quipped that the Segway helped him to maintain his good voting record.|$|E
5|$|The Cincinnatti fire {{department}} implemented use of <b>battery-powered</b> electrical fire engines, which were {{claimed to be}} much more effective than horse drawn engines.|$|E
5|$|The United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) {{developed}} a <b>battery-powered</b> pigeon camera now {{on display in}} the CIA Museum's virtual tour. According to the website, the details of the camera's use are still classified. News reports suggest that the camera was used in the 1970s, that the pigeons were released from planes, and that it was a failure.|$|E
5|$|The Defense Communications Planning Group's {{research}} and development program created an advanced technological system. Muscle Shoals would consist of three interdependent parts. First, there were air-dropped, <b>battery-powered</b> acoustic and seismic sensors. The camouflaged sensors were to be dropped in strings at predetermined geographical points along the PAVN logistical network. Once emplaced, they would serve as tripwires to any movement or activity along the system.|$|E
5|$|After {{missions}} {{discovered the}} reality of the harsh nature of the planet's surface, attention shifted towards other targets such as Mars. There {{have been a number of}} proposed missions afterwards however, and many of these involve the little-known upper atmosphere. The Soviet Vega program in 1985 dropped two balloons into the atmosphere, but these were <b>battery-powered</b> and lasted for only about two Earth days each before running out of power. Since then, there has been no exploration of the upper atmosphere. In 2002, the NASA contractor Global Aerospace proposed a balloon that would be capable of staying in the upper atmosphere for hundreds of Earth days as opposed to two.|$|E
5|$|Diamond's high thermal {{conductivity}} {{is used by}} jewelers and gemologists who may employ an electronic thermal probe to distinguish diamonds from their imitations. These probes consist {{of a pair of}} <b>battery-powered</b> thermistors mounted in a fine copper tip. One thermistor functions as a heating device while the other measures the temperature of the copper tip: if the stone being tested is a diamond, it will conduct the tip's thermal energy rapidly enough to produce a measurable temperature drop. This test takes about 2–3 seconds. However, older probes will be fooled by moissanite, a crystalline mineral form of silicon carbide introduced in 1998 as an alternative to diamonds, which has a similar {{thermal conductivity}}.|$|E
5|$|Diamond's thermal {{conductivity}} is {{made use of}} by jewelers and gemologists who may employ an electronic thermal probe to separate diamonds from their imitations.

One thermistor functions as a heating device while the other measures the temperature of the copper tip: if the stone being tested is a diamond, it will conduct the tip's thermal energy rapidly enough to produce a measurable temperature drop. This test takes about 2–3 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Early diamond {{identification}} tests {{included a}} scratch test {{relying on the}} superior hardness of diamond. This test is destructive, as a diamond can scratch another diamond, and is rarely used nowadays. Instead, diamond identification relies on its superior thermal conductivity. Electronic thermal probes are widely used in the gemological centers to separate diamonds from their imitations. These probes consist {{of a pair of}} <b>battery-powered</b> thermistors mounted in a fine copper tip. One thermistor functions as a heating device while the other measures the temperature of the copper tip: if the stone being tested is a diamond, it will conduct the tip's thermal energy rapidly enough to produce a measurable temperature drop. This test takes about 2–3 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Lucasfilm Games re-submitted the edited {{version of}} Maniac Mansion to Nintendo, which then {{manufactured}} 250,000 cartridges. Each cartridge was {{fitted with a}} <b>battery-powered</b> back-up to save data. Nintendo announced the port through its official magazine in early 1990, and it provided further coverage later that year. The ability to microwave a hamster remained in the game, which Crockford cited {{as an example of}} the censors' contradictory criteria. However, Nintendo later noticed it, and after the first batch of cartridges was sold, Jaleco was forced to remove the content from future shipments.|$|E
5|$|The rocket {{lands in}} the Hipparchus Crater, with Tintin being the first human {{to step on the}} Moon. Three days later, Haddock, Wolff and Tintin take the <b>battery-powered</b> tank to explore some stalactite caves in the {{direction}} of the Ptolemaeus Crater; inside a cave Snowy slips into an ice-covered chasm, but Tintin rescues him. Later aboard the ship, Tintin is overwhelmed by a third stowaway, Colonel Jorgen, a spy who had been smuggled aboard by Wolff, who has been blackmailed by a foreign power for which Jorgen works. With Wolff's help, Jorgen seeks to hijack the ship and return it to Earth, but is foiled by Tintin through emergency sabotage that cuts power to the engine.|$|E
5|$|Each <b>battery-powered</b> vehicle, or AGV, {{is made up}} of two platforms. Riders sit on {{the upper}} platform, which {{provides}} three degrees of freedom. A lower platform provides omnidirectional lateral movement. Unlike previous ride designs, the trackless system and the wheel and motor configurations allow movements diagonal to a rider's perspective. The vehicles use a dead reckoning system developed by Frog AGV to navigate their way through the environment, allowing a vehicle to cross another's path. Each vehicle features a built-in controller, which wirelessly communicates with a central ride-system controller. Movement commands are issued by the ride-system controller, and executed by the vehicles' controllers. A specially-designed battery and charge system allow the vehicles to be quickly charged while docked at the loading and unloading platforms.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the {{military}} potential of pigeon photography for aerial reconnaissance appeared attractive. Battlefield tests in World War I provided encouraging results, but the ancillary technology of mobile dovecotes for messenger pigeons {{had the greatest}} impact. Owing to the rapid perfection of aviation during the war, military interest in pigeon photography faded and Neubronner abandoned his experiments. The idea was briefly resurrected in the 1930s by a Swiss clockmaker, and reportedly also by the German and French militaries. Although war pigeons were deployed extensively during World War II, it is unclear to what extent, if any, birds were involved in aerial reconnaissance. The United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) later developed a <b>battery-powered</b> camera designed for espionage pigeon photography; details of its use remain classified.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{consists of}} a mixture of action, adventure, puzzle-solving, and role-playing video game. The series centers on Link, the main protagonist and character controlled by the player. Link is often given the task of rescuing Princess Zelda and the most common setting of the series, Hyrule, from Ganon, the series' primary antagonist. Other minor settings and antagonists have appeared throughout the series; Vaati {{has become one of}} the series' newer recurring antagonists. The games in The Legend of Zelda series with two-dimensional (2D) graphics feature side-scrolling or overhead view gameplay, while the games with three-dimensional (3D) graphics give the player a third-person perspective. The franchise holds several Guinness World Records, including first game with a <b>battery-powered</b> save feature and longest-running action-adventure series.|$|E
5|$|The mid- to late 1970s saw the {{introduction}} of what are usually referred to as red dot sights, a type that gives the user a simple bright red dot as an aiming point. The typical configuration for this sight is a compact curved mirror reflector design with a red light-emitting diode (LED) at its focus. Using an LED as a reticle is an innovation that greatly improves the reliability and general usefulness of the sight: {{there is no need}} for other optical elements to focus light behind a reticle; the mirror can use a dichroic coating to reflect just the red spectrum, passing through most other light; and the LED itself is solid state and consumes very little power, allowing <b>battery-powered</b> sights to run for hundreds and even tens of thousands of hours.|$|E

25|$|The first <b>battery-powered</b> watch, the Hamilton Electric 500, was {{released}} in 1957 by the Hamilton Watch Company.|$|E
25|$|Unusually, the Point Shirley Street Railway did {{not operate}} with {{electric}} power from overhead lines. It first used a gasoline-powered electric streetcar, then a <b>battery-powered</b> streetcar {{owned by the}} BRB, but these did not prove adequate for reliable service and by early 1919 buses were used instead. This prompted a public outcry with demands for conventional overhead-powered cars; instead, the BRB introduced two lighter <b>battery-powered</b> streetcars with better performance to the line in May 1919.|$|E
25|$|As an alternative, a <b>battery-powered</b> {{electric}} vehicle may use a solar array to recharge; the array may {{be connected to}} the general electrical distribution grid.|$|E
25|$|Hamilton Watch Complex - former {{factory and}} {{headquarters}} of the Hamilton Watch Company, which in 1957 sold the world's first <b>battery-powered</b> watch, the Hamilton Electric 500.|$|E
25|$|Size: The {{average size}} is now {{approximately}} {{the size of}} the palm of the hand, although hospital meters can be the size of a remote control. They are <b>battery-powered.</b>|$|E
25|$|In January 2011, {{the company}} {{announced}} its next mid-term business plan to introduce eight hybrid and <b>battery-powered</b> models by 2015. It aimed to sell its first two plug-in hybrids by fiscal 2012.|$|E
25|$|One {{potential}} {{issue with}} Chelsea service {{was the need}} to expand the MBTA's fleet of dual mode buses to accommodate the new route. This was solved by the purchase of five <b>battery-powered</b> buses using a federal grant.|$|E
25|$|The Research & Development Corporation (DEKA), {{a company}} that creates {{prosthetic}} limbs, has created a <b>battery-powered</b> arm that uses , a device that converts muscle group sensations into motor control. The arm is nicked named Luke Arm after Luke Skywalker (Star Wars).|$|E
25|$|In Germany, it {{was illegal}} to use {{bicycles}} without a dynamo-based lighting system except on racing bicycles below 11kg. This stimulated the market in Germany for high quality dynamos. Since 5 July 2013, {{a change in the}} law allows use of <b>battery-powered</b> lights.|$|E
25|$|In 1900, French {{electrical}} engineer, Gustave Trouvé, patented a <b>battery-powered</b> wearable lifejacket. It incorporated small, rubber-insulated maritime electric batteries {{not only}} to inflate the jacket, but also to power a light to transmit and receive SOS messages and to launch a distress flare.|$|E
25|$|So-called quartz analog {{wristwatches}} {{contain the}} smallest commonplace stepping motors; {{they have one}} coil, draw very little power, and have a PM rotor. The same kind of motor drives <b>battery-powered</b> quartz clocks. Some of these watches, such as chronographs, contain more than one stepping motor.|$|E
25|$|The first {{requirement}} for complete physical autonomy {{is the ability}} for a robot {{to take care of}} itself. Many of the <b>battery-powered</b> robots on the market today can find and connect to a charging station, and some toys like Sony's Aibo are capable of self-docking to charge their batteries.|$|E
25|$|Toy maker Unique Art {{produced}} {{a line of}} inexpensive O gauge trains from 1949 to 1951, but found itself unable to compete with Marx. Marx continued to make clockwork and <b>battery-powered</b> trains and lithographed cars into the 1970s, along with more realistic offerings that were sometimes difficult to distinguish from Lionel.|$|E
25|$|Intel's first 80286 chips were {{specified}} for a maximal clockrate of 4, 6 or 8MHz {{and later}} releases for 12.5MHz. AMD and Harris later produced 16MHz, 20MHz and 25MHz parts, respectively. Intersil and Fujitsu also designed fully static CMOS versions of Intel's original depletion-load nMOS implementation, largely aimed at <b>battery-powered</b> devices.|$|E
25|$|In 1934, Schwinn {{successfully}} re-styled the B-10E, renaming it the Aero Cycle. While the Aero Cycle featured no technical improvements {{over the}} original B-10E, its streamlined frame, faux gas tank, and <b>battery-powered</b> headlight came {{to define the}} cruiser 'look'. Modern cruiser bicycles retain these design elements, (except sometimes for the tank and/or light accessories).|$|E
25|$|In 1917 the Board {{purchased}} {{its first}} bus and commenced a feeder service {{from the end}} of the Sockburn tram route to Templeton. The bus was a <b>battery-powered</b> vehicle with solid rubber tyres but proved to be so unreliable that it was rebuilt and converted to use a petrol engine. It was later joined by another petrol-powered bus.|$|E
25|$|Tubes which {{generate}} {{relatively little}} heat, {{such as the}} 1.4-volt filament directly heated tubes designed for use in <b>battery-powered</b> equipment, often have shiny metal anodes. 1T4, 1R5 and 1A7 are examples. Gas-filled tubes such as thyratrons may also use a shiny metal anode, since the gas present inside the tube allows for heat convection from the anode to the glass enclosure.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. Navy's {{court of}} inquiry listed as one {{possibility}} the inadvertent activation of a <b>battery-powered</b> Mark 37 torpedo by stray voltage. This acoustic homing torpedo, in a fully ready condition and without a propeller guard, is believed by some to have started running within the tube. Released from the tube, the torpedo then somehow became fully armed and successfully engaged its nearest target: Scorpion.|$|E
25|$|In the 1960s, Michel Waisvisz and Geert Hamelberg {{developed}} the Kraakdoos (or Cracklebox), a custom made <b>battery-powered</b> noise-making electronic device. It {{is a small}} box with six metal contacts on top, which when pressed by fingers will generate a range of unusual sounds and tones. The human body becomes {{a part of the}} circuit and determines the range of sounds possible; different people will generate different sounds.|$|E
25|$|Processors {{that have}} a RISC {{architecture}} typically require fewer transistors than those with a complex instruction set computing (CISC) architecture (such as the x86 processors found in most personal computers), which improves cost, power consumption, and heat dissipation. These characteristics are desirable for light, portable, <b>battery-powered</b> devicesincluding smartphones, laptops and tablet computers, and other embedded systems. For supercomputers, which consume large amounts of electricity, ARM {{could also be a}} power-efficient solution.|$|E
25|$|William Fothergill Cooke and Charles Wheatstone {{developed}} a telegraph around 1838-40. In 1840 Wheatstone {{was using a}} magneto that he developed to power the telegraph. Wheatstone and Cooke made an important improvement in electrical generation by using a <b>battery-powered</b> electromagnet {{in place of a}} permanent magnet, which they patented in 1845. The self-excited magnetic field dynamo did away with the battery to power electromagnets. This type of dynamo was made by several people in 1866.|$|E
