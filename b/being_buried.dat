5|$|Although Benchley {{was known}} for {{misleading}} and fictional autobiographical statements about himself (at one point asserting that he wrote A Tale of Two Cities before <b>being</b> <b>buried</b> at Westminster Abbey), he actually was the great-grandchild of the founder of Benchley, Texas, Henry Wetherby Benchley, who was jailed for his help with the Underground Railroad. Robert Benchley was born on September 15, 1889, in Worcester, Massachusetts, the son of Maria Jane (Moran) and Charles Henry Benchley.|$|E
5|$|Although Constantine was {{reluctant}} to leave England, his poor health necessitated a return to Trinidad, {{but before he could}} do so he died of a heart attack, probably brought about by bronchitis, on 1 July 1971. His body was flown to Trinidad, where he received a state funeral before <b>being</b> <b>buried</b> in Arouca. He was posthumously awarded Trinidad's highest honour, the Trinity Cross. Later in the month, a memorial service was held in London in Westminster Abbey.|$|E
5|$|For years, stories {{circulated}} of {{a treasure}} <b>being</b> <b>buried</b> within the amphitheater. W. T.

5|$|On 1 November 1998, the NEA {{implemented}} {{a policy to}} limit the burial period of all graves to 15 years, due to a shortage of space in the cemeteries. After <b>being</b> <b>buried</b> for 15 years, graves are exhumed and the remains removed. If {{the religion of the}} deceased permits cremation, the exhumed remains are cremated and stored in government columbaria niches; otherwise, the remains are re-buried in smaller individual plots.|$|E
5|$|Rex's mother, Phyllis Van de Kamp (Shirley Knight), {{comes to}} town for Rex's funeral.

5|$|The axe and log logo was {{conceived}} {{by the first}} Camp Chief, Francis Gidney, in the early 1920s to distinguish Gilwell Park from the Scout Headquarters. Gidney wanted to associate Gilwell Park with the outdoors and Scoutcraft rather than the business or administrative Headquarters offices. Scouters present at the original Wood Badge courses regularly saw axe blades masked for safety by <b>being</b> <b>buried</b> in a log. Seeing this, Gidney chose the axe and log as the totem of Gilwell Park.|$|E
5|$|The sponge {{benefits}} {{from the fact that}} living on the scallop prevents it from <b>being</b> <b>buried</b> in sediment. In the wild it has been found that the scallops and their encrusting sponges both grow to a larger size in areas of high turbidity. A laboratory study showed that, in conditions where the sediment was frequently stirred up, sponges on empty scallop shells all died while those on living shells flourished. However, another study showed that growth rates in scallops heavily encrusted by sponges were significantly lower than in unencumbered ones.|$|E

5|$|Empress Shulü Ping, {{who became}} known as Empress Dowager Yingtian {{following}} the death of her husband, was an exceptionally powerful figure both before and after Taizu's death. While the latter was alive, Shulü Ping commanded an army of 200,000 horsemen that was tasked with maintaining order while Taizu led military campaigns abroad. She also led campaigns herself. Following the death of her husband, the Empress rejected the traditional Khitan custom of <b>being</b> <b>buried</b> with him, and elected to cut off her right hand and bury that with the Emperor instead. Shulü Ping then seized full military and civil authority in order to oversee the imperial succession under her own terms. The Empress's refusal to kill herself and be buried with Taizu effectively ended the longstanding custom.|$|E
5|$|Gray {{published}} his findings in a 1906 {{volume of the}} Proceedings of the Somerset Archaeological and Natural History Society, in which he drew comparisons between the site and two Cornish stone circles that he had recently surveyed, Fernacre and Stannon stone circle. He proffered {{the suggestion that the}} circle had been the site of cremations, with the cremated human remains then <b>being</b> <b>buried</b> within the nearby tumuli. In August 1909, Gray returned to the site {{for the first time in}} nine years. He noted that the circle was in largely the same condition as before, but that the ling and whortleberry bushes around the site were more stunted than they had previously been.|$|E

50|$|A {{civil parish}} {{is a country}} subdivision, forming the lowest unit of local {{government}} in England. There are 15 civil parishes in the ceremonial county of Greater Manchester, most of the county <b>being</b> unparished; <b>Bury,</b> Rochdale, and Salford are completely unparished.

5|$|Nineteen {{bodies were}} burned beyond recognition, {{but none of}} them {{appeared}} to be women or children, according to Pakistani officials. An article in The Nation, cited a grave digger at the cemetery where the bodies were <b>being</b> <b>buried,</b> who claimed there was the possibility {{that there may have been}} more than one body in each coffin. The article also stated that the government was digging more graves than previously established. The Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, a coalition of hard-line religious parties, claimed that between 400 and 1,000 students had been killed, along with women and children. Spanish-language news channels Univision, Antena 3, and Telecinco claimed that the total number of deaths in the siege was greater than 286 and could be as high as 300.|$|E
5|$|On {{arrival at}} North or South station coffins would usually be {{unloaded}} onto a hand-drawn bier and pulled by LNC {{staff to the}} appropriate chapel. While this was taking place the mourners were escorted to the waiting rooms at the station. On arrival at the chapels first and second class funerals would generally have a brief service (third class funerals had a single service in the appropriate chapel for all those <b>being</b> <b>buried).</b> For those burials where the funeral service had already been held at either a parish church or the LNC's London terminus the coffins would be taken directly from the train to the grave.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} {{originally}} released as a two-LP set with a gatefold {{jacket and a}} booklet containing lyrics, a text version of the story, and photographs taken by Ethan Russell illustrating it. MCA Records re-released the album as a two-CD set in 1985 with the lyrics and text story line on a thin fold-up sheet {{but none of the}} photographs. The album was reissued as a remastered CD in 1996, featuring a reproduction of the original album artwork. The original mix had been criticised in particular for Daltrey's vocals <b>being</b> <b>buried,</b> so the 1996 CD was completely remixed by Jon Astley and Andy Macpherson.|$|E

50|$|The {{ceremony}} {{has sometimes}} been interpreted as an Etruscan magical military tactic, comparable to another in which a Gallic man and woman were buried alive in the Forum Boarium.

Some victims were reportedly killed for not having identity documents or for their ethnicity. Reportedly, dozens of ethnic Tuaregs living in Bamako had their homes raided by government troops.|$|R
