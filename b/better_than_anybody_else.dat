However, the Asian Crisis contagion which started from Thailand and Korea started affecting the Philippines. This prompted the Philippine economy to plunge into continuous devaluation and very risky ventures, resulting in property busts and a negative growth rate. The remarkable feat of the administration, however, {{was that it was}} able to withstand the contagion effect of the Asian Crisis <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>else</b> in the neighboring countries. Most important in the administration was that it made clear the important tenets of reform, which included economic liberalization, stronger institutional foundations for development, redistribution, and political reform.|$|E
2500|$|Alvar {{has been}} criticized by his contemporaries for an overly nationalistic and {{colonialist}} viewpoint on the Spanish language. In his final year {{as director of the}} Real Academia Española, Alvar responded harshly to the European Commission (an institution of the European Union) after it requested that Spain revoke its law that all typewriters, computers and printers sold domestically include the tilde, a Spanish diacritical mark. Alvar declared that [...] "he tilde is our tradition and our identity." [...] He also received criticism for a statement he made in 1991 about indigenous languages, stating, [...] "Mexico knew <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>else</b> the value of having a language that unifies, that liberates the indigenous communities from their backwardness and misery...the path to freedom runs through hispanization." ...|$|E

James Reston, writing for The New York Times, said that [...] "Dr. King touched all the themes of the day, only <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>else.</b> He was full of the symbolism of Lincoln and Gandhi, and the cadences of the Bible. He was both militant and sad, and he sent the crowd away feeling that the long journey had been worthwhile." [...] Reston also noted that the event [...] "was better covered by television and the press than any event here since President Kennedy's inauguration", and opined that [...] "it will be a long time before [...] forgets the melodious and melancholy voice of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. crying out his dreams to the multitude." [...] An article in The Boston Globe by Mary McGrory reported that King's speech [...] "caught the mood" [...] and [...] "moved the crowd" [...] of the day [...] "as no other" [...] speaker in the event. Marquis Childs of The Washington Post wrote that King's speech [...] "rose above mere oratory". [...] An article in the Los Angeles Times commented that the [...] "matchless eloquence" [...] displayed by King—"a supreme orator" [...] of [...] "a type so rare as almost to be forgotten in our age"—put to shame the advocates of segregation by inspiring the [...] "conscience of America" [...] with the justice of the civil-rights cause.|$|E

For as Mr Pecksniff justly observed--when he and his daughters had burrowed their feet deep in the straw, wrapped themselves to the chin, and pulled up both windows--it is always satisfactory to feel, in keen weather, that many other people are not as warm as you are. And this, he said, was quite natural, and a very beautiful arrangement; not confined to coaches, but extending itself into many social ramifications. 'For' (he observed), 'if every one were warm and well-fed, we should lose the satisfaction of admiring the fortitude with which certain conditions of men bear cold and hunger. And if we were no <b>better</b> off <b>than</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>else,</b> what would become of our sense of gratitude; which,' said Mr Pecksniff with tears in his eyes, as he shook his fist at a beggar who wanted to get up behind, 'is one of the holiest feelings of our common nature.' ...|$|R

Some studies indicated that the need for achievement is one the strongest predictor of entrepreneurial behaviors (McClelland 1961; Babb and Babb 1992).

When he came to where the old man was dragged, with kicks and blows and ignominy, from his own house, Jess's eyes flashed, and she positively ground her teeth with indignation; and as for her feelings when she learnt that he was condemned to death and to be shot at dawn on the morrow, they are simply indescribable. Of the Bessie complication Jantje was quite ignorant, and could only tell her that Frank Muller had an interview with her sister in the little plantation, after which she was shut up in the store-room, where she still remained. But this was quite enough for Jess, who knew Muller's character <b>better,</b> perhaps, <b>than</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>else,</b> and was not by any means ignorant of his designs upon Bessie. A few moments' thought put the key of the matter into her hand. She saw now what was the reason of the granting of the pass, and of the determined and partially successful attempt at wholesale murder of which they had been the victims. She saw, too, why her old uncle had been condemned to death--it was to be used as a lever with Bessie; the man was capable even of that.|$|R

60|$|The {{report was}} {{discussed}} in both Houses, and strong speeches {{were made on}} both sides. The government (Mar. 3) proposed a motion that the House adopted the report, thanked the judges for their just and impartial conduct, and ordered the report to be entered on the journals. Mr. Gladstone followed with an amendment, that the House deemed {{it to be a}} duty to record its reprobation of the false charges of the gravest and most odious description, based on calumny and on forgery, that had been brought against members of the House; and, while declaring its satisfaction at the exposure of these calumnies, the House expressed its regret at the wrong inflicted and the suffering and loss endured through a protracted period by reason of these acts of flagrant iniquity. After a handsome tribute to the honour and good faith of the judges, he took the point that some of the opinions in the report were in no sense and no degree judicial. How, for instance, could three judges, sitting ten years after the fact (1879-80), determine <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>anybody</b> (M147) <b>else</b> that distress and extravagant rents {{had nothing to do with}} crime? Why should the House of Commons declare its adoption of this finding without question or correction? Or of this, that the rejection of the Disturbance bill by the Lords in 1880 had nothing to do with the increase of crime? Mr. Forster had denounced the action of the Lords with indignation, and was not he, the responsible minister, a <b>better</b> witness <b>than</b> the three judges in no contact with contemporary fact? How were the judges authorised to affirm that the Land bill of 1881 had not been a great cause in mitigating the condition of Ireland? Another conclusive objection was that—on the declaration of the judges themselves, rightly made by them—what we know to be essential portions of the evidence were entirely excluded from their view.|$|R
