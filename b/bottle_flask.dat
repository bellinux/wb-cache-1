Osterie tend to be cheap, and they also cater for after work and evening refreshment. Osterie vary greatly in practice: some only serve drinks and clients are allowed to bring in their own food, and some have retained a predominantly male clientele whilst others have reached out to students and young professionals. Some provide music and other entertainment. Similar to osterie are bottiglierie, where customers can take a <b>bottle</b> or <b>flask</b> to be re-filled from a barrel, and enoteche which generally pride themselves on the range and quality of their wine.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston UniversityThe {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to study the metabolism of normal human leukocytes. Leukocytes were incubated in vitro with c 14 -labeled acetate, and the fate of the radioactive carbon was determined by fractionation and analysis of the major, cell components. 	Leukocytes were obtained from whole blood by fibrinogen sedimentation and differential centrifugation. Optimal conditions for isolation and incubation of viable cells were developed and assessed using phase microscopy for direct observation of their morphological integrity and by their oxidative metabolism. Control experiments to determine the possible effect of erythrocyte utilization of acetate were run using twice the number of cells ordinarily found in leukocyte suspensions. No utilization of acetate by red blood cells was observed. 	Respiration studies were performed using standard Warburg manometry. Otherwise, incubations were carried out in modified Erlenmeyer flasks equipped with center wells for C 02 collection and stoppered with serum <b>bottle</b> caps. <b>Flasks</b> were equilibrated and various additions were made to the suspensions using hypodermic needles. Total cells per flask varied from 1 to 5 X 108 with concentrations ranging from 60 to 80 X 106 cells per ml. of suspension. Response of respiration and combustion of acetate were directly proportional to cell number and no detrimental effects due to cell crowding were detectable within this range. [TRUNCATED...|$|R
40|$|Various {{cell lines}} are {{currently}} being evaluated for influenza virus production and process performance to find alternatives to the egg-based vaccine manufacturing. Choosing between suspension and adherent cell lines is not easy and requires evaluation of different process concepts. Here, we present a comparison of adherent cell lines (MDCK, Vero) and suspension cell lines (MDCK. SUS 2, AGE 1. CR, HEK 293, CAP) to give insights into the complexity of this choice. The cells were cultivated in various cultivation systems including roller <b>bottles,</b> shaker <b>flasks,</b> small scale stirred tank reactors, and wave bioreactors. Different cultivation strategies were investigated (batch (with or without medium exchange), perfusion), cultivating each cell line in its appropriate medium. Infection with several influenza virus strains using different infection conditions (MOI (multiplicity of infection), trypsin activity) helped to improve virus yields. Data on metabolism, cell growth and virus titer will be discussed for several bioreactor cultivations. It {{can be seen that}} a simple screening of cell lines would not lead to satisfactory results concerning the choice of adherent versus suspension cell-based processes and optimum cultivation conditions. In particular, each of the cell lines investigated can produce most influenza strains in acceptable titers after careful adaptation and selection of appropriate process conditions. It remains however unclear, why some virus strains cannot be produced by specific cell lines. Because of this it seems advisable, to have several alternatives for influenza vaccine manufacturing in case of a pandemic threat...|$|R

La ceramica sovradipinta bizantina di Gortina. p. 1 - 304, PADOVA:Aldo Ausilio Editore in Padova-Bottega d"Erasmo, ISBN: 978 - 88 - 6125 - 071 - 0 The Byzantine painted pottery {{from the}} Gortys {{excavations}} represents {{a new class}} among the painted pottery productions which spread over the Mediterranean basin {{since the end of}} the 6 th century AD. 	The first finds came to light around the mid-fifties during the excavations in the Temple of Athena on the acropolis (Haghios Ioannis hill), but the greatest number of fragments comes from the upper town and, particularly, from the Byzantine quarter between the Pretorio and the Apollo Pythios temple: here, the finding of a ceramic factory site with a small kiln shows that this class is a local production. 	The pottery bears simple linear painted decoration in red or dark brown, over a light brown or clay-coloured slip. The closed forms are amphoras, jugs, <b>bottles,</b> <b>flasks,</b> juglets, bowls; they are decorated on the shoulders with long coupled leaves, horizontal waves, stylized vegetal patterns and groups of diverging lines. 	The open forms include carinated bowls, dishes and basins. The carinated bowls can be considered a fine ware, because of their high technical standards and their great variability in decorative patterns. These latter include motifs such as stylized plants, crosses and birds. The edge of the dishes is decorated with oblique and parallel lines, the rims with colour drops and the inner surface with fishes or small stylized twigs. 	In the production of this pottery class one can distinguish three chronological phases: 	 1. from the end of the 6 th century AD to the earthquake of 618 AD; 	 2. from the earthquake in 618 to the following earthquake of 670 AD; 	 3. from the 670 earthquake to the end of the 8 th century AD. 	The first phase is the one least known, and the very bulk of production is dated after 618 AD. The closed forms are definetly more common than the open ones. The basic forms and the motifs do not show major changes during the two more important phase (from the 1 st half of the 7 th century to the 8 th century AD). 	The Byzantine painted pottery of Gortys can be placed, then, in the wide context of the several ceramic painted productions flourished all around the Mediterranean sea between the end of the 6 th and the 7 th century: in Greek-Aegean area, the dishes and the bowls with vegetal patterns, called “Central Greek Painted Wares” by John Hayes; in Egypt, the painted productions of Alessandria, Antinoe and Kellia; in Syria, Palestine and Jordan the s. c. “Gerash bowls”, the Nabataean bowls and the Omayyad painted pottery with linear and spiral decoration patterns. And painted productions with predominantly regional movement have been identified over the past thirty years, as it is known, also in Central and Southern Italy (Abruzzo, Basilicata, Puglia, Calabria and Sicily). However, the original decorative repertoire of Gortys pottery, devoid of precise similarities with the other contemporary productions, reaffirms its genuine character of local and typical manufacture of Crete island during the first two centuries of Byzantine age...|$|R

The control ismainly aimed at identifying ink spots and faded prints {{produced by a}} serigraphic process, but the approach is generically applicable {{to any kind of}} printing and printed cylindrical surface. Differently from the existing systems, based on the acquisition of good printed samples, the automatic control is based on the original digital image feeded to the printing system. Therefore, the control takes place directly between the ideal model and the result of a complex printing process including a number of distortion and noise sources. Problems related to image acquisition, reconstruction and alignment are investigated; a novel technique for image-model verification, based on adaptive local deformation, is also proposed and tested over a significant set of samples. A complete prototype system designed for such quality control is finally described and its operating capability on the field is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Visual {{recognition}} of material boundaries in transparent vessels is valuable for numerous applications. Such recognition {{is essential for}} estimation of fill-level, volume and phase-boundaries {{as well as for}} tracking of such chemical processes as precipitation, crystallization, condensation, evaporation and phase-separation. The problem of material boundary recognition in images is particularly complex for materials with non-flat surfaces, i. e., solids, powders and viscous fluids, in which the material interfaces have unpredictable shapes. This work demonstrates a general method for finding the boundaries of materials inside transparent containers in images. The method uses an image of the transparent vessel containing the material and the boundary of the vessel in this image. The recognition {{is based on the assumption}} that the material boundary appears in the image in the form of a curve (with various constraints) whose endpoints are both positioned on the vessel contour. The probability that a curve matches the material boundary in the image is evaluated using a cost function based on some image properties along this curve. Several image properties were examined as indicators for the material boundary. The optimal boundary curve was found using Dijkstra's algorithm. The method was successfully examined for {{recognition of}} various types of phase-boundaries, including liquid-air, solid-air and solid-liquid interfaces, as well as for various types of glassware containers from everyday life and the chemistry laboratory (i. e., <b>bottles,</b> beakers, <b>flasks,</b> jars, columns, vials and separation-funnels). In addition, the method can be easily extended to materials carried on top of carrier vessels (i. e., plates, spoons, spatulas).

5000|$|Most {{vacuum tube}} {{collectors}} {{are used in}} middle Europe use heat pipes for their core instead of passing liquid directly through them. Direct flow is more popular in China. Evacuated heat pipe tubes (EHPTs) are composed of multiple evacuated glass tubes each containing an absorber plate fused to a heat pipe. The heat is transferred to the transfer fluid (water or an antifreeze mix—typically propylene glycol) of a domestic hot water or hydronic space heating system in a heat exchanger called a [...] "manifold". The manifold is wrapped in insulation and covered by a protective sheet metal or plastic case.The vacuum inside of the evacuated tube collectors have been proven to last more than 25 years, the reflective coating for the design is encapsulated in the vacuum inside of the tube, which will not degrade until the vacuum is lost.The vacuum that surrounds {{the outside of the}} tube greatly reduces convection and conduction heat loss, therefore achieving greater efficiency than flat-plate collectors, especially in colder conditions. This advantage is largely lost in warmer climates, except in those cases where very hot water is desirable, e.g., for commercial processes. The high temperatures that can occur may require special design to prevent overheating.Some evacuated tubes (glass-metal) are made with one layer of glass that fuses to the heat pipe at the upper end and encloses the heat pipe and absorber in the vacuum. Others (glass-glass) are made with a double layer of glass fused together at one or both ends with a vacuum between the layers (like a vacuum <b>bottle</b> or <b>flask),</b> with the absorber and heat pipe contained at normal atmospheric pressure. Glass-glass tubes have a highly reliable vacuum seal, but the two layers of glass reduce the light that reaches the absorber. Moisture may enter the non-evacuated area of the tube and cause absorber corrosion. Glass-metal tubes allow more light to reach the absorber, and protect the absorber and heat pipe from corrosion even if they are made from dissimilar materials (see galvanic corrosion).|$|R
40|$|In vitro {{studies of}} adverse {{cellular}} effects induced by inhalable substances face {{a number of}} problems due to the difficulties in exposing cultured cells of the respiratory tract directly to test atmospheres composed of complex gases and particulate compounds. This paper discusses the characteristics of in vitro work and summarizes the use of different in vitro technologies to determine the adverse effects of inhaled pollutants. The exposure of cells to test atmospheres requires accurate control of the pollutant levels, as well as the close contact of cells and gas without interfering with the medium. Systems which rely on the solution of the gas in the medium overlay do not resemble the exposure conditions in vivo, and may not be suitable for studying, for example, the effects of poorly soluble gases. Exposure to gases or complex mixtures can be performed with roller <b>bottles</b> or <b>flasks</b> on rotating and rocking platforms and, using these techniques, the cells are periodically exposed to the test atmosphere. However, the most promising approach is based on a biphasic cell culture technique, where cells are grown on microporous membranes at an air-liquid interface. Here the cells are nutrified from the basal side of the membrane whilst the apical part with the cultivated cells is in direct contact with the test atmosphere. Based on this culture technique, different exposure systems have been developed and these are described and discussed. Exposure of cells from the respiratory tract to gases or particles is responsible for cell injury or cell activation associated with an overexpression of mRNA and the release of bioactive mediators. Therefore, in vitro studies using such a strategy, in combination with relevant and efficient exposure devices, open up new ways to test native complex gases and aerosols. Furthermore, such an experimental approach is not only suitable for cultivated cells, {{but it can also be}} used for exposing bacteria to inhalable test compounds. It is possible to analyze the mutagenic potency of in- and outdoor pollutants and several attempts have been made to determine the induction of revertants in a modified Ames assay after exposure to single gases or complex mixtures...|$|R
6000|$|Her dining-room was {{difficult}} for some time. She had equipped that with a dark oak Welsh dresser made very bright with a dessert service that was, in view of its extremely decorative quality, remarkably cheap, and with some very pretty silver-topped glass <b>bottles</b> and <b>flasks.</b> This dresser {{and a number of}} simple but shapely facsimiles of old chairs, stood out against a nearly primrose paper, very faintly patterned, and a dark blue carpet with a margin of dead black-stained wood. Over the mantel was a German colour-print of waves full of sunlight breaking under cliffs, and between this and the window were dark bookshelves and a few bright-coloured books. On the wall, black-framed, were four very good Japanese prints, rich in greenish-blues and blueish-greys that answered the floor, and the window curtains took up some of the colours of the German print. But something was needed towards the window, she felt, to balance the warmly shining plates upon the dresser. The deep rose-red of the cherries that adorned them was too isolated, usurped too dominating a value. And while this was weighing upon her mind she saw in a window in Regent Street a number of Bokhara hangings very nobly displayed. They were splendid pieces of needlework, particularly glorious in their crimsons and reds, and suddenly it came to her that {{it was just one of}} these, one that had great ruby flowers upon it with dead-blue interlacings, that was needed to weld her gay-coloured scheme together. She hesitated, went half-way to Piccadilly Circus, turned back and asked the prices. The prices were towering prices, ten, fifteen, eighteen guineas, and when at last the shopman produced one with all the charm of colour she sought at eight, it seemed like ten guineas snatched back as they dropped from her hands. And still hesitating, she had three that pleased her most sent home, [...] "on approval," [...] before she decided finally to purchase one of them. But the trial was conclusive. And then, struck with a sudden idea, she carried off a long narrow one she had had no idea of buying before into the little study behind. Suppose, she thought, instead of hanging two curtains as anybody else would do in that window, she ran this glory of rich colour across from one side on a great rod of brass.|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} little {{development}} regarding analysis of polonium (Po) in environmental samples since the 1960 ies. This {{is due to the}} straightforward spontaneous deposition of this element on silver (Ag), nickel (Ni) or copper (Cu) without any radiochemical separation. For many years, no radiochemical yield determinant was used and it was generally supposed that the yield was 100 % after two depositions. Counting was often done using ZnS scintillation counter coupled to a photomultiplier tube. However, the use of the yield determinants (208) Po and (209) Po and the development of alpha spectrometry showed that the yield was lower. Furthermore, the tendency of Po to volatilize at low temperatures constrains the sample preparation techniques; dry-ashing cannot be used. But during the wet-ashing procedure, there are still some losses. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the Po losses during wet-ashing by the use of a double-tracer technique. We have found that the losses were about 30 % when open glass beakers were used and about 17 % when the samples were digested in microwave oven. When long-necked <b>bottles</b> (Kjeldahl <b>flasks)</b> were used, a loss of about 20 % was registered. It has also been observed that (210) Pb to some extent is plating out together with its daughter nuclide Po during the electrochemical deposition. This will result in a systematic error since an unknown amount of supported (210) Po will be produced from the (210) Pb decay depending on the fraction of (210) Pb being deposited on the disc and the waiting time between deposition and measurement of the sample. A further consequence of this is that in the assessment of the (210) Pb content in the sample, very often the remaining liquid is stored after deposition for build-up of (210) Po. Since some (210) Pb is lost on the disc, the result for (210) Pb will be too low. Both these systematic errors give rise to a too high (210) Po/(210) Pb ratio. The fraction of (210) Pb which is plating out has been assessed in this study for different matrices and is about 50 - 90 %. During the measurement by solid state Si-detectors, some Po is evaporated in the vacuum conditions contaminating the detectors. Experiments have here been done by heating the discs after deposition which indicate that less Po is evaporated from Ag than from Ni. The losses from Ag are less than that from the other metals probably due to a deeper penetration into the surface of Po. We conclude that in most aspects, Ag is better to use than the other plating metals...|$|R
40|$|Recombinant {{proteins}} {{are important}} for biomedical research and {{for the treatment of}} human disease. Therefore it is necessary to develop reproducible bioprocesses to rapidly produce proteins of adequate quality and quantity. Expression in mammalian cells is preferred if the proteins are to be properly folded and post-translationally modified. For the rapid production of milligram to gram quantities of a protein in mammalian cells, large-scale transient gene expression is an attractive option. The two most important components of this technology are the cell cultivation system and the gene delivery method. For this reason the goal of this thesis was to develop novel cost-efficient cell cultivation systems and gene delivery methods for the large-scale transfection of mammalian cells in chemically defined media free of any animal-derived components including serum. Cultivation of mammalian cells in suspension is essential for large-scale transient gene expression. A superior system for the cultivation of mammalian cells based on the agitation of cells in "square-shaped" glass bottles (square bottles) was developed. It is an inexpensive but efficient means to grow cells to a high density without instrumentation. The growth and viability of cultures of both human embryo kidney (HEK) 293 E and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) DG 44 cells in agitated one-liter square bottles exceeded that in spinner flasks, reaching cell densities 1. 5 times higher on average. Furthermore, an efficient and reproducible method to transfect cells in agitated square bottles was developed for both HEK 293 E and CHO DG 44 cells. A novel gene delivery method termed calfection that relies on the addition of DNA and CaCl 2 directly to a suspension culture was developed. Calfection has a number of advantages over existing gene delivery methods such as calcium phosphate-DNA coprecipitation in that there are no time-dependent steps. The DNA/CaCl 2 solution can be stored for long periods and is filterable. It is suitable for both large-scale transfections in bioreactors and for high-throughput transfections in microtiter plates. One drawback, however, is its dependence on the presence of serum in the culture medium. A second gene delivery method, serum-free transfection with polyethylenimine (polyfection), proved to be highly efficient for the transfection of both HEK 293 E and CHO DG 44 cells. A reproducible method for polyfection in microtiter plates, 50 ml centrifuge tubes, agitated square and round <b>bottles,</b> spinner <b>flasks,</b> and bioreactors was optimized for these two cell lines. Polyfection proved to be a simple and successful gene transfer method in both instrumented and non-instrumented cultivation systems. Importantly, it could be performed in serum-free chemically defined media. With HEK 293 E cells, 80 mg/l of antibody was produced in agitated square bottles and with CHO DG 44 cells, more than 2 g of antibody were produced in one week in a 150 -liter bioreactor...|$|R
