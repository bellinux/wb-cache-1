As a result, the Bermudian government introduced its own domestic legislation in 1999 to rectify the problem.|$|R
50|$|The {{customary}} formal bulletin {{announcing the}} royal birth was displayed on an easel outside Buckingham Palace, although in {{a break with}} tradition the news was first conveyed in a press release from palace officials. Gun salutes signalled the birth in the capitals of <b>Bermuda,</b> the <b>UK,</b> New Zealand, and Canada; the bells of Westminster Abbey and many other churches were rung; and iconic landmarks in the Commonwealth realms were illuminated in various colours, mostly blue to signify {{the birth of a}} boy.|$|R

50|$|On 12 September the {{termination}} of her commission announced {{as part of a}} programme of cuts in naval spending. On 16 October she left <b>Bermuda</b> for the <b>UK,</b> arriving at Devonport on 3 November. Porlock Bay spent the year 1948 as part of the Fishery Protection Squadron in home waters, and was put into reserve at Devonport in January 1949. In February her pennant number was changed to F650 from K650. She remained in Reserve until 1962, during which she was refitted twice.|$|R
50|$|These were {{introduced}} because mail was often {{sent to the}} wrong place, e.g., for St Helena to St Helens, Merseyside and Ascension Island to Asunción, Paraguay, and many online companies would not accept addresses without a postcode. Mail from the UK continues {{to be treated as}} international, not inland, and sufficient postage must be used. Royal Mail's Heathrow centre collects all live underpaid mail for surcharging, and there is a reciprocal arrangement with postal services around the world to collect. An agreed payment based on volumes is made, year on year. Other forms of postage are collected at local mail centres, but Heathrow collects those that still get forwarded to them. <b>Bermuda,</b> the <b>UK's</b> most populous remaining overseas territory, has developed its own postcode system, with unique postcodes for street and PO Box addresses, as have the Cayman Islands and the British Virgin Islands. Montserrat recently introduced postal codes, and a system has been under consideration in Gibraltar, and the code GX11 1AA has been introduced as the generic postcode for the territory. Postcodes are not used in the Turks and Caicos Islands and the TKCA 1ZZ designation is generally unknown.|$|R
50|$|In March 1952, David Brown and Eric Rylands, {{owners of}} the Lancashire Aircraft Corporation (LAC), {{acquired}} all Skyways ordinary shares together with two non-airworthy aircraft that had formed part of Skyways's fleet (a York and a Lancastrian). This takeover resulted in the combined group's headquarters and main operating base relocating to Bovingdon and the award in June 1952 of a new War Office contract to transport 4,000 troops, their dependents and civilian defence personnel between the <b>UK,</b> <b>Bermuda</b> and Jamaica. Joint trooping flights commenced on 2 July 1952. These used modified Yorks with a new 70,000lb (31,751kg) maximum takeoff weight and 36, rear-facing seats. It took 27 hours to reach the Caribbean from the UK, including two intermediate stops at Keflavík, Iceland, and Gander, Canada, respectively. Service frequency eventually increased to three to four monthly round-trips.|$|R
50|$|The FSA {{started a}} search for the {{invested}} monies, which globally extended to Dubai, the Cayman Islands, Thailand and <b>Bermuda.</b> In the <b>UK</b> they seized: £1 million in jewellery; £250,000 in cash; and 16 cars, including Bentleys, two Ferraris, and a Lamborghini. Pruthi was the sole shareholder of Relton Mews Air Ltd, a Bermuda-based company that owned a twin-engine Cessna Citation I jet aircraft, registered as VP-BGE. This aircraft crashed near Biggin Hill Airport, Kent, on 30 March 2008, killing five people, including: David Leslie, a touring car driver; Richard Lloyd, a racing driver and APEX team co-owner; and Chris Allarton, a data engineer. They were travelling to the Nogaro Circuit in France to test for Apex Motorsport in preparation for the FIA GT3 European Championship. Any monies from a $1 million (£610,000) insurance claim for the aircraft will now be deposited with the FSA.|$|R
50|$|Veryan Bay was recommissioned on 5 March 1953 {{for service}} in the 7th Frigate Squadron in the West Indies, {{under the command of}} Captain R.G.W. Hare. She arrived at Bermuda on 30 April, and in June was at Kingston, Jamaica for ceremonies for the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. The ship then visited Antigua, Barbados, Grenada, Puerto Cabello, Trinidad, Recife and Montevideo while en route to the Falklands for another tour as guardship, {{arriving}} on 22 July. After patrols around the islands, she left on 14 October, arriving at Kingston on 19 November to embark troops, and the next day was stationed for Air-Sea Rescue duty during the Royal Flight to <b>Bermuda</b> from the <b>UK.</b> At <b>Bermuda</b> in December she carried out ceremonial duties during the summit meeting between U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower, and the British and French Prime Ministers Winston Churchill and Joseph Laniel, to discuss relations with the Soviet Union following the death of Stalin and their development of a hydrogen bomb.|$|R
5000|$|On 3 August 2007 {{three men}} were stopped by police while escorting and {{piloting}} {{a replica of}} the first American combat submarine within 200 ft of Queen Mary 2, then docked at the cruise ship terminal in Red Hook, Brooklyn. The replica was created by New York artist Philip [...] "Duke" [...] Riley and two out-of-town residents, one of whom claimed to be a descendant of David Bushnell, who had invented it. The Coast Guard issued Riley a citation for having an unsafe vessel, and for violating the security zone around Queen Mary 2.On 19 October 2011, Queen Mary 2 had her registry changed to Hamilton, Bermuda, from her previous home port of Southampton, to allow the ship to host on-board weddings.

40|$|There {{are several}} small territories in the Caribbean {{that have not}} yet gained their {{independence}} and remain under the control of a metropolitan power. These include the territories governed by the United Kingdom (UK) and the Netherlands. This chapter analyses the way in which education policy and reform are enacted in these quite unusual circumstances – with pressures and influences both from the territories and their respective metropoles. The chapter is constructed around two interlinked parts. The first considers the broader political and economic relationships that exist, and the place that education has within them. Both the UK and the Netherlands use language, such as, “partnership,” “prosperity,” and “renewal” to describe their approach to the territories, including in relation to the education sector. However, both governments have used different mechanisms to facilitate change – the British have a slightly more detached approach, while the Dutch are more hands-on. This has important implications for the way in which education is managed in their territories and the consequences that result – and these issues are explored further {{in the second part of}} the chapter. By focusing particularly on the Dutch BES (Bonaire, Saint Eustatius, and Saba) islands and <b>Bermuda</b> (a <b>UK</b> Overseas Territory), the chapter traces the contours of recent education reforms, and evaluates the advantages and disadvantages of the particular approaches taken. The more flexible approach of the UK is perhaps preferable, but here too concerns are raised about neocolonialism and the lack of sensitivity when it comes to local norms and practices...|$|R
50|$|The Bermudian {{government}} took over {{operation of the}} field in 1995, being obliged to {{spend a great deal}} of money making it conform to international civil standards. This involved changes to lighting systems, fencing, and razing any objects over a certain height, within a certain distance of the runway (which included both the former base commander's residence, and the hillock it stood on). The US Government still held the lease, which was for 99 years, however, until negotiations were completed regarding the cleanup of toxic waste left behind. The cost of clean-up of all US Navy facilities in Bermuda was then estimated at $65.7 million, although that included $9.5 million for replacing the Longbird Bridge. Threats were made that, if the Bermuda government did not allow the US Government to wash its hands of responsibility, the US Navy would take the field over again and close it to all air traffic. The final compromise negotiated by the <b>UK,</b> <b>Bermuda,</b> and USA governments, which comprised an $11 million payment for the replacement of Longbird Bridge, has been denounced by many in Bermuda as a betrayal, but the field has now been transferred entirely to the Bermuda Government as the Bermuda International Airport. It was an alternative landing site for NASA's Space Shuttle.|$|R
40|$|Pedagogical {{research}} has shown the relevance of involving students in teaching and peer-teaching, particularly as learners involved in these activities have reported better learning and performance. This {{could be attributed to}} different reasons such as enhancement of active thinking about the topics taught, self-learning, translating the topics’ concepts into one’s own words, etc. Engaging students through teaching could provide them with key transversal competences and will encourage them to develop their “teaching” skills. An innovative group of academics is undertaking an ambitious process to involve undergraduate BSc Biomedical Science and BMedSci Medical Science students in teaching and peer-teaching at De Montfort University (DMU, Leicester, UK). These include students teaching secondary school children (educating younger students) and peer-teaching. The aim {{of this paper is to}} describe and analyse the initial academic and student impressions of these two novel initiatives used in the relevant programmes, as previously such initiatives have been minimal or non-existent. Peerteaching was firstly initiated with BMedSci students in the 2015 / 16 academic course in an attempt to teach basic skills to respond to an outbreak of infection, an activity that received a high level of student satisfaction as discussed previously. However, we have revisited this teaching session to make it more robust, in which students on both programmes will need to develop an intervention programme to protect human health in the aftermath of an outbreak in the UK, a pedagogical activity that we are co-developing with the University of Alcalá (Madrid, Spain). The other teaching initiative that has been created on the biomedical and medical sciences programmes for the first time involved educating pupils in <b>Bermuda</b> (an overseas <b>UK</b> territory). Second and final year students of both programmes visited different Bermudian schools and colleges to deliver the same one hour session chosen by the DMU academic. In addition, these DMU students were involved in promoting their profession (biomedical and medical science). The outcome of both these projects can be beneficial in improving learning and engagement among students enrolled in any human-health related degree...|$|R
