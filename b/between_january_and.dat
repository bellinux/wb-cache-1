5|$|WASP-43 {{was first}} {{observed}} by the WASP-South {{part of the}} planet-searching SuperWASP project <b>between</b> <b>January</b> <b>and</b> May 2009. It was determined from the collected data that WASP-43 could potentially host a planet that transited, or crossed in front of, its host star as seen from Earth. Later observations by both the WASP-South and SuperWASP-North sections of SuperWASP <b>between</b> <b>January</b> <b>and</b> May 2010 yielded a total of 13,768 data points.|$|E
5|$|On 20 June 2010, 611 C3 Picassos built <b>between</b> <b>January</b> <b>and</b> March 2010 were {{recalled}} due to incorrectly routed fuel pipes, {{which were}} {{believed to have been}} in contact with the heat shield. This fault may have caused chafing and may lead to a fuel leak. The models were built <b>between</b> <b>January</b> <b>and</b> March 2010 and were sold in the UK. On 24 August 2010, all 13,234 Picassos sold in the UK were recalled because the windscreen trim could deteriorate, and could eventually detach, leading to a loose-fitting windscreen.|$|E
5|$|A four-part series {{published}} <b>between</b> <b>January</b> <b>and</b> April 1996, {{the story}} begins with the New York Police Department using Brock's wife, Ann, to trap him. Brock sends the symbiote to Ann, turning her into She-Venom again and letting her escape. In issue #3, Ann is afraid of the symbiote's influence and refuses {{to have anything to}} do with Brock while he wears it. This plotline is resolved in The Amazing Spider-Man Vol.2 #19 (2000), in which Ann's experience with the symbiote triggers her suicide. The story includes contemporary Spider-Man Ben Reilly trying to bring Venom to justice.|$|E

5|$|An HD remaster {{edition of}} the series was {{confirmed}} in August 2011 although Mitsuo Fukuda stated it was leaked information and that the official information would come {{in the next few}} days. In November 2011, Bandai announced the release of the series in four Blu-ray compilations between March and December 2012.

5|$|An initial {{prototype}} design was developed <b>between</b> <b>January</b> <b>and</b> May 1964. When used with MAR, the MSR needed only short range, enough to hand off the Sprint missiles. This {{led to a}} design with limited radiated power. For Small City Defense, this would not offer enough power to acquire the warheads at reasonable range. This led to an upgraded design with five times the transmitter power, which was sent to Raytheon in May 1965. A further upgrade in May 1966 included the battle control computers and other features for the SCD system.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in March 1964, Supreme Soviet {{presidium}} {{chairman and}} nominal {{head of state}} Leonid Brezhnev began discussing Khrushchev's removal with his colleagues. While Brezhnev considered having Khrushchev arrested as he returned {{from a trip to}} Scandinavia in June, he instead spent time persuading members of the Central Committee to support the ousting of Khrushchev, remembering how crucial the Committee's support had been to Khrushchev in defeating the Anti-Party Group plot. Brezhnev was given ample time for his conspiracy; Khrushchev was absent from Moscow for a total of five months <b>between</b> <b>January</b> <b>and</b> September 1964.|$|E

Thảo consulted Kỳwho {{wanted to}} seize power for himselfand exhorted {{him to join}} the coup, but the air force chief claimed he was remaining neutral.

5|$|<b>Between</b> <b>January</b> <b>and</b> March 1952 the {{journalist}} Ian Fleming wrote Casino Royale, his first novel, at his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica. Fleming conducted research for Live and Let Die, and completed the novel before Casino Royale {{was published in}} January 1953, four months before his second book was published. Fleming and his wife Ann flew to New York before taking the Silver Meteor train to St. Petersburg in Florida and then flying on to Jamaica. In doing so they followed the same train route Fleming had taken with his friend Ivar Bryce in July 1943, when Fleming had first visited the island.|$|E

5|$|Births occur year-round, with peaks between May and June in {{northern}} populations and <b>between</b> <b>January</b> <b>and</b> March in southern populations. Gestation appears to vary {{from four to}} twelve months, as the species is capable of delayed implantation followed by four months of pregnancy.

5|$|Following {{the end of}} the Pacific War in August 1945, SWPA was {{dissolved}} and the Air Board again assumed {{full control}} of all its operational formations. Nos.1 and 2(Training) Groups, and No.5 (Maintenance) Group, were disbanded <b>between</b> <b>January</b> <b>and</b> March 1946. Northern Command, having been re-designated Northern Area in December 1945, was disbanded in February 1947. The other area commands continued to function with essentially the same boundaries as during the war, except that North-Western Area no longer covered the Dutch East Indies.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, astronomers {{analysed}} {{data from}} the SOHO spacecraft's LASCO instrument, which {{is a set of}} three coronagraphs. The data taken <b>between</b> <b>January</b> <b>and</b> May of that year did not show any vulcanoids brighter than magnitude 7. This corresponds to a diameter of about , assuming the asteroids have an albedo similar to that of Mercury. In particular, a large planetoid at a distance of 0.18 AU, predicted by the theory of scale relativity, was ruled out.|$|E

5|$|In {{statements}} to the Polícia Judiciária, witnesses described men behaving oddly near apartment 5A {{in the days leading}} up to the disappearance and on the day itself.

5|$|Later {{observation}} by both SuperWASPs in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres led to {{the collection}} of 13,768 data points <b>between</b> <b>January</b> <b>and</b> May 2010 and {{to the use of}} the CORALIE spectrograph at La Silla Observatory in Chile. Fourteen measurements using the radial velocity method confirmed WASP-43b as a planet, revealing its mass in the process. The use of La Silla's TRAPPIST telescope helped the science team working on the planet to create a light curve of the planet's transit in December 2010.|$|E

5|$|Mogador was {{refitted}} at Lorient <b>between</b> <b>January</b> <b>and</b> March 1940 and {{a number}} of minor changes were made.
