40|$|In this study, the {{application}} of liquid polymer to form an intemal barrier to prevent the loss of moisture in concrete during curing and to improve the watertightness at the hardening stage was investigated. In normal practice, a barrier or seal type cure is achieved by applying external plastic sheets or spraying curing foam around {{the surface of a}} concrete structure. In some cases, this process may be difficult to perform properly, for example, concrete structures with large surface areas or with complicated shapes. Hence, liquid polymer (acrylic based) is introduced. However, the process is different from the extemal one. Instead of using an extemal <b>barrier</b> <b>sheet</b> wrapping, an internal barner is formed using the formation of the polymer film around the outer surface. Results indicated that the polymer was able to be used as an internal barrier successfully to prevent moisture loss in concrete. With a sufficient amount of water inside the concrete, the internal barrier created by the polymer film was able to prevent moisture evaporation and allowed concrete strength to develop regularly on its own without adding additional water. In addition, at the later stage, the efficiency of the polymer film or network, once fully formed throughout the concrete, was also found to improve the ability of the concrete to prevent the penetration of water. Results from the penetration tests indicated that the watertightness of polymer concrete was by far superior to that of plain concrete...|$|E

Jay Mondali doktoritöös uuriti grafeenoksiidi ja redutseeritud grafeenoksiidi nanoliistakute valmistamise tehnoloogiat ja valmistati nende ainete baasil lihtkatted, hübriidkatted koos elektrit juhtiva polümeeri polüpürrooliga ning komposiitkatted koos metalloksiidide Al 2 O 3 ja TiO 2 nanokiledega. Katted kanti roostevaba terase või Ti-sulamist valmistatud katseobjektide pindadele, kasutades vurrkatmise, elektrokeemilise sadestamise ja aatomkihtsadestamise meetodeid. Katete omaduste uurimiseks kasutades laia hulka tahkisobjektide karakteriseerimise vahendeid, mis on saadaval TÜ Füüsika ja Keemia instituutides. Samuti määrati elektrokeemiliste mõõtmiste ja standarttestidega nende katete võime kaitsta alusmaterjale korrosiooni eest. Töö tulemusena näidati ära, et kuigi nii valmistatud liht- kui hübriidkatted aitavad teatud määral pidurdada korrosiooniprotsesse metallalustel, ei suuda need katted tõhusalt pidurdada punktkorrosiooni nimetatud aluste pikaajalisel hoidmisel tugevasti korrodeeruvates soolalahustes. Seevastu uudsed, submikromeetrilise paksusega grafeeni baasil loodud komposiitkatted näitasid üles väga head korrosioonikaitset mõlema sulami pinnal, ületades paljude tänapäeva tööstuses kasutatavate kümneid kuni sadu kordi paksemate kaitsekatete näitajaid. Töö tulemused on avaldatud eriala juhtivates ajakirjades ja tutvustatud rahvusvahelistel konverentsidel. Antud doktoritöö valmis prof. Väino Sammelselja juhendamisel.

In {{this thesis}} {{corrosion}} inhibition performance of graphene and graphene oxide based composite/hybrid coatings was studied. Graphene is a two-dimensional one-atom-thick sheet of carbon having hexagonal lattice, {{and it is}} a basic structural unit of graphite. Graphene has proven {{to be one of the}} most popular advanced materials in recent developments. This carbon material is widely studied for advanced applications starting from energy harvesting to nanoelectronics and finishing with drug delivery because of many extraordinary properties of it. Among all of the properties the atom/ion barrier property was one of the most interesting for this work. Some studies to use graphene or graphene-based materials as a <b>barrier</b> <b>sheet</b> were published before starting this work and some appeared during the run of this investigation. Lately, the development of graphene and graphene oxide based functionalized biocompatible barrier coatings attracts a great attention among scientists and probably industrialists as well. But the use of graphene oxide/reduced graphene oxide nanoplatelets for corrosion protection of metal alloys was practically not studied before this work, despite the facts that the ideas of preparation the materials were known already decades, and as row material relatively cheap powder of natural graphite can be used. In this thesis the barrier properties of graphene/graphene oxide based nanostructured coatings, including composite and hybrid coatings were investigated towards corrosion protection. Investigations were carried through using different strategies: for the preparation of thin protective coatings spin-coating, electrochemical deposition and atomic layer deposition (ALD) techniques were used. For the corrosion inhibition performance studies of synthesized graphene oxide and reduced graphene oxide the hybrid coatings of graphene oxide-polypyrrole and the composite coatings of graphene-metal oxide laminates were prepared. The extent of protection ability of the coatings deposited onto AISI type 304 stainless steel and Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy substrates was studied thoroughly by electrochemical methods, as open circuit potential and Tafel plots, voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectrometry, and tested by standard ASTM G 48 A and long-time immersion tests in salt solutions. The studies revealed that prepared graphene and graphene oxide based hybrid and especially composite coatings well inhibit corrosion of the metal substrates. This definitely increases lifetime and stability of the metal details and equipment made from these materials, helping to preserve the materials and energy, thus helping to develop also a more sustainable society. ...|$|E

Density functional theory calculations on cluster models, where graphene is modeled by planar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), provide the energies and geometries. Particularities of our systems, such as convergence of both energy barriers and deformation curves with increasing size of the PAHs, are discussed. Three different interaction regimes, adiabatic, planar and vertical, are investigated by enforcing different geometrical constraints. The adiabatic energy barriers range from 5 eV for hydrogen to 20 eV for neon. We find that the permeation of oxygen and carbon into graphene is facilitated by temporary chemical bonding while for other, in principle reactive atoms, it is not.

In this paper, {{charge control}} {{mechanism}} and carrier features have been precisely investigated in InxGa 1 -xN/InN/InxGa 1 -xN based quantum-well double heterostructure high electron mobility transistors (QW-DHEMTs). A study of charge {{control in the}} InxGa 1 -xN/InN/InxGa 1 -xN structure is performed by self-consistently solving Schrödinger equation in conjunction with Poisson’s equation {{taking into account the}} spontaneous and piezoelectric polarization effects. The potential profile and the distribution of electron density in the channel as a function of gate voltage are investigated here. A large conduction band offset of about 2. 2 eV is obtained for the proposed device for In content x= 0. 05, which ensure better carrier confinement and higher sheet charge density. The influence of In composition(x) and doping concentration of InxGa 1 -xN upper <b>barrier</b> on <b>sheet</b> charge density and carrier distributions in channel is also presented.

40|$|The role of inter-bundle {{resistive}} <b>barriers</b> (metal <b>sheet</b> wraps), {{introduced to}} reduce the inter-bundle coupling loss in multistage cabled Cable-In-Conduit Conductors (CICC) for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) is evaluated, based on results gained recently on short sample experiments in the Twente Cable Press and SULTAN. The obvious benefit of limiting the inter bundle coupling loss unavoidably goes together with impeding the redistribution of nonuniform currents in the coil winding introduced at the terminations, as well as reduction of the heat exchange between the bundles. Six-element numerical electromagnetic code simulations are presented that qualitatively explain the effect of wraps on the DC performance, strongly depending on the testing geometry. The computations illustrate that wraps can reduce the DC performance in short sample tests. At the same time simulations of the Poloidal Field Coil Insert (PFCI), with a winding length of 50 m, have shown that omitting sub-stage wraps, can even degrade the DC performance of coils due to the short current transfer length in combination with current nonuniformity causing peak voltages in the most overloaded petals...|$|R

One of the main mitigation measures taken to reduce the degradation of the archaeology has been the construction of a hydrological <b>barrier</b> along the <b>sheet</b> piling that divides the redeveloped area and the historic site. A shallow subsurface infiltration system was designed to achieve groundwater levels and flow conditions that are optimal for the preservation of archaeological remains directly along the sheet pile, while reducing drainage and subsidence also further upstream.

50|$|When a HEMT {{is built}} from AlGaN/GaN, higher power density and {{breakdown}} {{voltage can be}} achieved. Nitrides also have different crystal structure with lower symmetry, namely the wurtzite one, which has built-in electrical polarisation. Since this polarization differs between the GaN channel layer and AlGaN <b>barrier</b> layer, a <b>sheet</b> of uncompensated charge {{in the order of}} 0.01-0.03 C/m is formed. Due to the crystal orientation typical for epitaxial growth ("gallium-faced") and the device geometry favorable for fabrication (gate on top), this charge sheet is positive, causing the 2D electron gas to be formed even if there is no doping. Such a transistor is normally on, and will turn off only if the gate is negatively biased - thus this kind of HEMT is known as depletion HEMT, or dHEMT. By sufficient doping of the barrier with acceptors (e.g. Mg), the built-in charge can be compensated to restore the more customary eHEMT operation, however high-density p-doping of nitrides is technologically challenging due to dopant diffusion into the channel.|$|R

Flexible PV films have significant advantages in terms of ease of manufacture by roll-to-roll (R 2 R) techniques and in easy building integration. A significant challenge is the protection of the flexible solar cells from water vapour ingress, which seriously reduces cell life and efficiency. Transparent barrier films are a possible solution to addressing the water vapour transmission rate (WVTR) challenge. Consequently thin barrier films such as those made from Al 2 O 3 are the subject of increasing research interest when used for the encapsulation of flexible PV modules. The film can be produced by several thin film deposition processes such as atomic layer deposition (ALD). However, micro-scale defects in the barrier film such as pinholes and particulate debris have been shown to have serious consequences in terms of WVTR. Our previous research has empirically shown that small defects (≤ 3 μm lateral dimension) were less significant in determining water vapour ingress. In contrast, larger defects (≥ 3 μm lateral dimension) have been shown to have a greater effect on the barrier functionality. The present paper illustrates the use of surface segmentation techniques to efficiently extract defect data from measured surface topography of <b>barrier</b> film <b>sheets.</b> Experimental results are presented where the defect information is correlated with the WVTR tests. A model is then presented to test the hypothesis that the major contributing defects to water vapour transmission rate (WVTR) are small numbers of large defects.
