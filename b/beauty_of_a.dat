5|$|Sonnet 18 is {{a typical}} English or Shakespearean sonnet. It {{consists}} of three quatrains followed by a couplet, {{and it has the}} characteristic rhyme scheme: abab cdcd efef gg. The poem reflects the rhetorical tradition of an Italian or Petrarchan Sonnet. Petrarchan sonnets typically discussed the love and <b>beauty</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> beloved, often an unattainable love, but not always. It also contains a volta, or shift in the poem's subject matter, beginning with the third quatrain.|$|E
5|$|The {{controversy}} surrounding the Rampart Dam project illustrated the growing {{shift in the}} environmental movement during the 1960s. Rather than becoming focused singularly on solely preserving the natural <b>beauty</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> particular landscape, as had inspired {{the creation of the}} U.S. National Park Service in the United States {{during the first half of}} the twentieth century, naturalists and environmentalists began to consider the human cost of development as well. Though opposition to Rampart was founded primarily on economic and natural grounds, it consequences for the Alaska Native population in the region reflected later concerns about industrial development in more urban areas.|$|E

500|$|A {{number of}} critics {{have found the}} {{character}} of Mercutio to have unacknowledged homoerotic desire for Romeo. Jonathan Goldberg examined the sexuality of Mercutio and Romeo utilising [...] "queer theory" [...] in Queering the Renaissance, comparing their friendship with sexual love. Mercutio, in friendly conversation, mentions Romeo's phallus, suggesting traces of homoeroticism. An example is his joking wish [...] "To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle ... letting it there stand / Till she had laid it and conjured it down." [...] Romeo's homoeroticism {{can also be found}} in his attitude to Rosaline, a woman who is distant and unavailable and brings no hope of offspring. As Benvolio argues, she is best replaced by someone who will reciprocate. Shakespeare's procreation sonnets describe another young man who, like Romeo, is having trouble creating offspring and who may be seen as being a homosexual. Goldberg believes that Shakespeare may have used Rosaline as a way to express homosexual problems of procreation in an acceptable way. In this view, when Juliet says [...] "...that which we call a rose, by any other name would smell as sweet", she may be raising the question of whether there is any difference between the <b>beauty</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> man and the <b>beauty</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> woman.|$|E
500|$|In its time, {{the work}} of A. Farsari & Co. was highly {{regarded}} and popular. Besides Kipling's endorsement, photographer and prolific photography writer W. K. Burton published an appraisal in an 1887 article: [...] "I have seen no better work {{in the way of}} coloured photographs anywhere than some of Farsari's productions". In the same year, an admiring review of Farsari's work appeared in the journal Photographic Times and American Photographer, describing it as [...] "technically almost perfect" [...] and showing [...] "artistic proportion" [...] in the selection of subjects, depicting Japanese life and providing images of the natural <b>beauty</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> country that was admittedly unfamiliar to Americans.|$|E

500|$|Gender studies {{critics have}} argued that Rosaline's name {{suggests}} that Romeo never really forgets her but rather replaces her with Juliet. [...] Thus, when Juliet cries [...] "What's in a name? A rose by any other name would smell as sweet," [...] she is ironically expressing Romeo's own view {{of her as a}} substitute for Rosaline. [...] That is to say, Rosaline, replaced in name only by Juliet, is just as sweet to Romeo. Gender critics also note that the arguments used to dissuade Romeo from pursuing Rosaline are similar to the themes of Shakespeare's procreation sonnets. In these sonnets Shakespeare urges the man (who can be equated with Romeo) to find a woman with whom to procreate—a duty he owes to society. [...] Rosaline, it seems, is distant and unavailable except in the mind, similarly bringing no hope of offspring. [...] As Benvolio argues, she is best replaced by someone who will reciprocate. [...] Rosaline reveals similarities to the subject of the sonnets when she refuses to break her vow of chastity. [...] Her name may be referred to in the first sonnet when the young man is described as [...] "beauties Rose." [...] This line ties the young man to both Rosaline and Romeo in Juliet's [...] "What's in a name?" [...] soliloquy. [...] When Juliet says [...] "...that which we call a rose / By any other name would smell as sweet", she may be raising the question of whether there is any difference between the <b>beauty</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> man and the <b>beauty</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> woman.|$|E

500|$|The poem {{starts with}} a {{flattering}} question to the beloved—"Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?" [...] The beloved is [...] "more lovely and more temperate" [...] than a summer's day. The speaker lists some negative things about summer: it is short—"summer's lease hath all too short a date"—and sometimes the sun is too hot—"Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines." [...] However, the beloved has beauty that will last forever, unlike the fleeting <b>beauty</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> summer's day. By putting his love's beauty into the form of poetry, the poet is preserving it forever. [...] "So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see, So long lives this, and this gives life to thee." [...] The lover's beauty will live on, through the poem which will {{last as long as}} it can be read.|$|E

In 1984, the broadcaster Melvyn Bragg confronted Bacon with a reproduction of the centre panel during the filming of a South Bank Show documentary, and observed that in his earlier career the artist seemed preoccupied with the physicality of the human mouth.

[...] David Jeffries of AllMusic described [...] "Bound 2" [...] as a [...] "new wave <b>beauty</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> closer." [...] Writing for The A.V.

500|$|The figure's {{mouth is}} opened wide as if screaming, an {{expression}} Bacon took from a still he kept of the nurse screaming in Sergei Eisenstein's Odessa Steps massacre sequence in his 1925 silent film Battleship Potemkin. In 1984, the broadcaster Melvyn Bragg asked Bacon about the still, and observed {{that in his}} earlier career the artist seemed preoccupied with the physicality of the human mouth. Bacon replied, [...] "I had always thought that I {{would be able to}} make the mouth with all the <b>beauty</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Monet landscape though I never succeeded in doing so."

[...] Weiland worked on the lyrics using these demo arrangements, often making suggestions for musical phrases to be doubled or moved. Weiland was credited for the lyrical melodies, but Robert pointed out, [...] "This record was made in a way that Scott wasn't really there for the creation of these songs, musically." [...] However, both Dean and Robert would be surprised at the direction Weiland would take the songs, which could have been composed with an entirely different vision.

[...] John Hartl of The Seattle Times gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "It's exceptionally difficult to make an audience care for animated characters unless they're mermaids or anthropomorphized animals or insects, yet the Disney animators, with a big assist from the vocal talents of a superb cast, have pulled it off." [...] Gene Siskel, also of the Chicago Tribune, gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "Beauty and the Beast is one of the year`s most entertaining films for both adults and children." [...] On their Beauty and the Beast edition of Siskel & Ebert, both Siskel and Roger Ebert proclaimed that the film is [...] "a legitimate contender for Oscar consideration as Best Picture of the Year." [...] Michael Sragow of The New Yorker gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "It's got storytelling vigor and clarity, bright, eclectic animation, and a frisky musical wit." [...] Eric Smoodin writes in his book Animating Culture that the studio was trying to make up for earlier gender stereotypes with this film. Smoodin also states that, in the way it has been viewed as bringing together traditional fairy tales and feminism as well as computer and traditional animation, the film's [...] "greatness could be proved in terms of technology narrative or even politics". Animation legend Chuck Jones praised the film, in a 1992 guest appearance on Later with Bob Costas he claimed he [...] "Loved it. I think it should have won ...

500|$|The show's only main {{character}} {{to have been}} spared harsh criticism, Clair has garnered very positive reviews from critics, by whom she continues to be venerated frequently. Critics and journalists often celebrate the character's [...] "outspoken, womanist views". Blake Green of The Baltimore Sun described the character as [...] "the perfect wife and mother of five who also practiced law and dressed to the nines." [...] Jezebel's Hillary Crosley Coker hailed Clair as a [...] "career-driven matriarch that kicked ass {{at home and at}} work." [...] Writing for Complex, Nikeita Hoyte described Clair as [...] "A hard-ass mom who radiates the <b>beauty</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> goddess", while the Chicago Tribune wrote that [...] "Clair was one big beacon of gorgeous in the Huxtable household." [...] Daisy Dumas of the Daily Mail dubbed Clair an [...] "Indomitable matriarch". AfterEllen.com's Jill Guccini called Clair [...] "divine". Including her on her list of [...] "Diverse TV Ladies That Can Help Young Girls Learn How to Kick Ass", she hailed her relationship with Cliff as [...] "something that young girls—gay or straight—really need to see", while praising her occasional use of Spanish. In a retrospective review of The Cosby Show in 2014, Daily Life writer Ruby Hamad highlighted Clair as the [...] "one thing about the show that is as good now as it was then". In terms of the character's best episodes, Joe Reid of The Atlantic cited Clair's unimpressed reaction to her husband allegedly confusing a cherished memory of her with that of an old love interest in the sixth season episode [...] "Isn't It Romantic?" [...] as a personal favorite, specifically lauding Rashad's pronunciation of [...] "tacky barrette" [...] and [...] "her hairpin turn when Cliff's real gift is revealed that shows that next dimension that always pushed Clair {{to the top of the}} heap." [...] Meanwhile, Kevin O'Keefe, writing for the same publication, selected Clair's enraged monologue to Vanessa in season six's [...] "Off to See the Wretched", followed by the character's dismay upon learning that Sondra has decided not to return to law school, as his favorites, enjoying the way in which Clair adopts an [...] "attack mode" [...] in both circumstances. Reviewing the character's conversation about pregnancy and marriage with Denise in season three's [...] "The Shower", Slates Aisha Harris wrote [...] "written realistically and delivered beautifully by Rashad, the moment attains a level of artistry that spot-on TV lessons rarely reach." [...] When the show aired, both middle and upper-class working women responded well to Clair. However, some few reviewers have occasionally accused the character of being too perfect and one-dimensional, while others found her to be too aggressive, outspoken, lacking in maternity and overly controlling towards both her children and husband. Additionally, some feminist critics did not appreciate the fact that Clair rarely struggles with everyday situations that working mothers typically encounter in real life.|$|E
