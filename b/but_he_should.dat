25|$|When saying Kiddush, {{the blessing}} over the wine (or over the bread) precedes the blessing over the day. One {{does not need}} to wash his hands before saying Kiddush <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> wash them after. The towel used to wash one's hands should not be placed on the table, lest it and {{anything}} that comes into contact with it be rendered ritually unclean. Following the meal, all the crumbs in the dining room should be thoroughly swept up, then those involved should wash their hands.|$|E
25|$|Robert Bork's America {{is a land}} {{in which}} women would be forced into back-alley abortions, blacks would sit at {{segregated}} lunch counters, rogue police could break down citizens' doors in midnight raids, schoolchildren could not be taught about evolution, writers and artists could be censored at the whim of the Government, and {{the doors of the}} Federal courts would be shut on the fingers of millions of citizens for whom the judiciary is—and is often the only—protector of the individual rights that are the heart of our democracy... President Reagan is still our president. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> not be able to reach out from the muck of Irangate, reach into the muck of Watergate and impose his reactionary vision of the Constitution on the Supreme Court and the next generation of Americans. No justice would be better than this injustice.|$|E
25|$|The Aghoris of Varanasi perform shava sadhana {{with some}} {{difference}} in the ritual. The corpse is bound to a stake at the wrist or ankle by a silken thread and a protective circle drawn around it to keep evil spirits of the cremation ground away. The spirits are offered meat and liquor outside the circle. The spirits would try {{to talk with the}} practitioner and gain entry in the circle <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> ignore them until finally he will conquer them, forcing them to accept his offerings and leave. This is signified by the corpse's mouth opening a bit. An offering of kheer is put in the corpse's mouth. Finally, the Aghori decapitates the corpse to acquire its skull or extracts a bone from its spine to gain control over its soul. The remaining body is cast in the river. The rite should be followed by a period of asceticism to gain mastery of the soul of the deceased. While the Aghori sits on the corpse's chest and meditates, the ojha (exorcist or wizard) performs the ritual by seating on the stomach of the deceased.|$|E

500|$|New Worlds {{greatest}} {{influence on}} science fiction {{came in the}} 1960s, with the [...] "New Wave" [...] that began with Moorcock's polemical editorials. [...] Moorcock asserted in 1965 that a writer of good sf [...] "can learn from his predecessors, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> not imitate them"; and he was soon publishing stories that were quite different in technique and style from anything that had appeared before, not just in New Worlds itself, but {{in any of the}} sf magazines. Moorcock's goal was to use the magazine to [...] "define a new avant-garde role" [...] for the genre. [...] New Worlds thus became the [...] "ideological center of the [...] movement to rejuvenate conjectural literature".|$|E
500|$|Teammate Sid Barnes criticised the {{omission}} of Hamence from much meaningful cricket on the tour. Referring to the match against the Gentlemen of England, Barnes criticised the fact that Bradman, Hassett and himself all made centuries, while Hamence was only given a short innings in the lower order and was not out on 24 when Australia declared. As the tourists were already in a strong position, Barnes reasoned that Hamence [...] "could have been sent in [...] first wicket down, where he batted with his interstate team... Despite this, Hassett still went in before Hamence in the next game, against Somerset... Hamence batted No. 6... <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> have been sent in No. 3." ...|$|E
500|$|His touring {{colleague}} Sid Barnes criticised {{the omission}} of Hamence from much meaningful cricket on the tour. He wrote: [...] "For instance, against the Gentlemen at Lord's we were 532 when Hamence came to bat. Brown got 120, Bradman 150, Hassett, not out, 200 and Miller 69. Hamence was left not out with 24. This was an innings in which {{he could have been}} sent in first wicket down, where he batted with his interstate team... Despite this, Hassett still went in before Hamence in the next game, against Somerset... Hamence batted No. 6... <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> have been sent in No. 3." [...] Bradman, following the Invincibles tour described Hamence as [...] "a fine batsman of the strictly orthodox type. Very sound and reliable with his game based on driving" [...] and a [...] "very safe fieldsman".|$|E

500|$|At {{least for}} a time, he {{considered}} Elizabeth Barrett Browning the best contemporary English poet. Like many from his time, Chivers called {{for the development of}} a distinctive American literature and he especially encouraged young writers. Poe called the 1845 poetry collection The Lost Pleiad [...] "the honest and fervent utterance of an exquisitely sensitive heart." [...] Overall, he called Chivers [...] "one of the best and one of the worst poets in America". William Gilmore Simms offered conditional praise of Chivers's poetry as well: [...] "He possesses a poetic ardor sufficiently fervid, and a singularly marked command of language. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> have been caught young, and well-bitted, and subjected to the severest training... As an artist, Dr. Chivers is yet in his accidence." [...] Simms also commented that his works were too gloomy and melancholy. Chivers was one of a group of poets criticized for [...] "intensity of epithet" [...] in Bayard Taylor's verse parody The Echo Club and Other Literary Diversions (1876).|$|E
500|$|Bahadur was {{satisfied}} with the decision, [...] "Out of seven accused, five have been given death sentences. This will send a strong message {{to the public that}} law is greater than the khap." [...] However, he was disappointed that [...] "the leader [...] got away with death penalty because he intentionally disappeared during the killing." [...] Narendra said, [...] "We will appeal in High Court for death penalty to the main accused, Ganga Raj. We respect the court's decision <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> be punished so that the instigators of the crime get the punishment. Also it is important that it is a very clear message so that no khap gives such directions, ever." [...] Seema seconded Narendra's concerns, [...] "We would have been happier if the main accused was also given the death sentence. The decision of the panchayat was not justified and people should not to be allowed to misuse their power. We have fought this battle alone when no one was supporting us." [...] She requested more security for her family, [...] "They tried to bribe us to withdraw the case then they threatened that they would kill us if we didn't withdraw the FIR. Even after the decision we're afraid of a backlash from the Khap Panchayat." ...|$|E

Courage is a base instinct he should possess, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> also use wisdom and strategy when he makes moves. One who knows only bravery {{is no more than}} an ordinary man who can fight enemies." ...|$|E

2500|$|While fear of God can be {{replaced}} by fear of the prince, {{if there is a}} strong enough prince, Machiavelli felt that having a religion is in any case especially essential to keeping a republic in order. For Machiavelli, a truly great prince can never be conventionally religious himself, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> make his people religious if he can. According to [...] he was not the first person to ever explain religion in this way, but his description of religion was novel {{because of the way he}} integrated this into his general account of princes.|$|E
2500|$|In 1903, a {{group of}} {{visitors}} came from India {{to pay tribute to}} Zafar at his burial place. But at that time [...] "even the exact location of Zinat Mahal's grave had been forgotten though some local guides pointed out the sight of the withered lotus tree." [...] In 1905, the Muslims of Rangoon protested and demanded that there should be some measure to demarcate Zafar's grave because [...] "...As a man or as a king, Bahadur Shah was not to be admired, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> be remembered." [...] They wanted the government to buy a [...] "strip of land enclosing the grave in question, of sufficient area to permit a monument worthy of Bahadur Shah erected over it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1974 a new tent {{was added}} to the Festival. Instead of {{displaying}} or performing recognized traditions, its goal was to collect items of family folklore from visitors. This tent was unique at the festival in asking visitors to be active contributors to the folklife on display instead of merely receptive spectators. A sign at the tent was hopeful: [...] "Family Folklore – Will You Share Yours With Us?" [...] Card tables with checkered table clothes were set up, tape recorders and folklore interviewers on hand to prompt, listen and record family lore which visitors might share. Not only should each visitor see himself somewhere in the exhibits, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> also recognize and record parts of his own story as a unique and valued artifact of cultural heritage.|$|E

2500|$|Pope Benedict XVI {{called for}} {{the repeal of the}} blasphemy law and also called on governments in Muslim-majority {{countries}} to protect Christians from violent attacks. He told the Holy See's diplomats that the law was a pretext for violence against minorities. He also added that [...] "The tragic murder of the governor of Punjab shows the urgent need to make progress in this direction." [...] The Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam responded in saying: [...] "The pope has given a statement today that has not only offended the 180 million Muslims in Pakistan, it has also hurt the sentiments of the entire Islamic world.

2500|$|In {{the words}} of Thomas S. Freeman, {{one of the most}} {{important}} living Foxe scholars, [...] "current scholarship has formed a more complex and nuanced estimate of the accuracy of Acts and Monuments.... Perhaps [...] may be most profitably seen in the same light as a barrister pleading a case for a client he knows to be innocent and whom he is determined to save. Like the hypothetical barrister, Foxe had to deal with the evidence of what actually happened, evidence that he was rarely in a position to forge. But he would not present facts damaging to his client, and he had the skills that enabled him to arrange the evidence so as to make it conform to what he wanted it to say. Like the barrister, Foxe presents crucial evidence and tells one side of a story which must be heard. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> never be read uncritically, and his partisan objectives should always be kept in mind." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1969, Caldwell joined {{two other}} {{senators}} who defended {{the right of}} Muhammad Ali, the African American boxer who converted to Islam and avoided military service in the Vietnam War, {{to speak at the}} student forum at the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville. [...] "I don't agree with him, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> be heard," [...] explained Caldwell. Democratic Senator Milt Earnhart of Fort Smith introduced a resolution to condemn Ali’s appearance, and Republican Lieutenant Governor Maurice Britt declared that the resolution had passed by a voice vote. In his speech Ali stunned many when he spoke highly of former Governor George C. Wallace of Alabama, who the year before had won forty-six electoral votes, including the six from Arkansas, as the nominee of the American Independent Party, only to lose the 1968 presidential election to Richard M. Nixon. Ali discussed racial segregation and said that he understood why whites in the American South as late as the early 20th century had lynched blacks who had molested white women. Ali further urged African-American men to protect black women.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{generally}} agreed that the basis of initial training {{is to make the}} experience enjoyable for the puppy or young hound, to keep its enthusiasm high. Whitney preferred waiting till the hound is 18 months old, to start training, but others start as young as possible, say three months. Training can be started by running short trails on a family member whom the puppy sees walk away, at first remaining visible, and later going out of sight. Even though familiar with the scent of the ‘runner’, it can be given a scent-article to sniff, and given the command to follow. It can also be introduced to the tracking harness, which is put on just before the trail starts, and removed as soon as it is finished. On reaching the runner the puppy is given lavish praise and perhaps a reward. Generally in training the handler must know exactly where the runner went, so that he does not encourage the hound when it is wrong, or ‘correct’ it when it is on the scent, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> not be too ready with his corrections if the hound goes astray, or it may come to rely on him. He should give the hound time to realise its mistake and put itself right, if possible. As training progresses the handler learns to ‘read’ his hound’s behaviour. The hound must trust its nose and the handler must trust the hound. From early hot trails on a familiar person, the young hound progresses to colder trails on the scents of strangers. Later training can be designed to teach particular lessons: crossing trails with false scents, having the runner start out with a companion, who leaves him somewhere along the trail, laying a trail on ground frequented by wild animals. This will teach the hound not to change on to other humans, or riot on animal scents (known as ‘staying clean’ , or ‘freedom from change’ [...] ). It also needs to work over a variety of ground and learn to cope with distractions of many kinds, as well as being introduced to 'negative trails': given a scent article which has not been handled by anyone in the area, so that it will learn to indicate to a handler that the required scent is not there. If it is becoming discouraged it can revert to simpler tasks to recover enthusiasm.|$|E
