Army National Guard helicopters began assisting in this operation August 31. Meanwhile, Lake Pontchartrain started slowly draining and was expected to return to normal levels in about 36 hours.|$|E
25|$|In 1911, Lieutenant Longmore and Oswald Short {{installed}} streamlined air <b>bags</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> undercarriage struts {{and under}} the tail of Improved S.27 No. 38 to enable the aircraft to land on water. On 1 December 1911, Longmore used the aircraft {{to become the first}} person in the United Kingdom to take off from land and make a successful water landing when he landed in the river Medway off Sheerness, after which No.38 was brought ashore and flown back to Eastchurch. A flying-off platform was constructed over the foredeck and forward 12-inch (305mm) gun turret of the pre-dreadnought battleship HMS Africa, and on 10 January 1912 Samson, piloting No.38, used the platform while Africa was anchored off Sheerness to make the United Kingdom’s first successful aeroplane take-off from a ship. The platform was later transferred to the battleship HMS Hibernia.|$|E
500|$|The steam {{carriages}} {{were four}} wheeled, [...] long over the buffers. First, {{second and third}} class compartments were available. First class carriages had four compartments, the others five. Lighting was initially provided by burning coal gas held in <b>bags</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> roof, later by a pressurised oil gas system. At first they were fitted with a chain brake. This {{was replaced by the}} simple Westinghouse brake and then a fully automatic Westinghouse brake.|$|E

500|$|This {{underground}} station has two tracks and one island platform. Both track walls have a lime green trim {{line with a}} medium Kelly green border. Small [...] "205" [...] signs are placed below them at regular intervals. The platform has a row of concrete-clad I-beam columns on both sides; these are painted medium Hunter green. There is clear evidence of water damage and mold due to poor drainage in numerous areas along the platform ceiling, the wall tiles, and {{to a number of}} the support columns. The station is also notorious for having piles of trash <b>bags</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> platform and at entrances, as well as for large amounts of litter on the tracks due to an absence of trash cans. 205th Street station was declared one of the five worst in the system in terms of maintenance and appearance by the New York City Transit Riders Council in 2005, problems which have persisted into the 2010s.|$|E
500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1982, after three intense seasons of archaeological {{underwater}} work, preparations began for raising the ship. The operation soon ran into problems: early on there were difficulties with the custom-made lifting equipment; divers on the project belonging to the Royal Engineers had to be pulled because of {{the outbreak of the}} Falklands War; and the method of lifting the hull had to be considerably altered as late as June. After the frame was properly attached to the hull it was slowly jacked up on four legs straddling the wreck site to pull the ship off the seabed. The massive crane of the barge Tog Mor was then used to lift the frame and hull on to the specially designed cradle which was padded with water-filled <b>bags.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> morning of [...] 1982, the final lift of the entire package of cradle, hull and lifting frame began. At 9:03 the first timbers of the Mary Rose broke the surface {{in the presence of the}} team, Prince Charles and curious spectators on boats circling the site. A second set of bags under the hull was inflated with air to cushion the waterlogged wood and finally the whole package was transferred to the barge that would take the hull ashore. Though eventually successful, the operation was close to floundering on two occasions; first when one of the supporting legs of the lifting frame was bent and had to be removed and later when a corner of the frame, with [...] "an unforgettable crunch", slipped more than a metre (3feet) and came close to crushing part of the hull.|$|E
2500|$|The {{campsite}} {{did have}} a makeshift stage, made out of cardboard, tents, clothes and <b>bags,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{early hours of the}} Saturday night/Sunday morning called [...] "The Trumpet Stage". It was for anyone who wanted to get up to perform any songs they wanted with just an acoustic guitar could. Most notably roadies from UK band The Kooks and musician Rob Smith. The [...] "stage" [...] lasted just under half an hour before being destroyed.|$|E

2500|$|A {{small group}} of young volunteers {{detached}} themselves from Goathland and moved into Levisham station. [...] At first the only usable building was the signal box (habitable would be too strong a term), with temporary window frames covered in polythene and the fireplace resuscitated, it made a rough and ready base. [...] The more hardy stayed overnight in sleeping <b>bags</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wooden floor with one brave soul suspending a hammock from the roof beams. [...] This group started work tidying up the station and evicting the rats, but more important was fencing, ditching and keying-up on 'their' section of track northwards to Newtondale.|$|E

So once more the blue-bloused porter slung the big bag and <b>the</b> little <b>bag</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> strap over his shoulder, and they plunged into the night, towards some lights and a sort of theatre place.|$|R

60|$|Sir Amias had {{forbearance}} {{enough not}} to hint that unless the return were speedy, she would scarcely find the Queen there, and the matter was settled. Master Richard would not depart until after dinner, when other gentlemen were going, and this would enable Cicely to make up her mails, and {{there would still be}} time to ride a stage before dark. Her own horse was in the stables, and her goods would be bestowed in cloak <b>bags</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> saddles of the grooms who had accompanied Mr. Talbot; for, small as was the estate of Bridgefield, for safety's sake he could not have gone on so long an expedition without a sufficient guard.|$|E
6000|$|He reposed for a time.

Bert liked maps, and he {{spent some time in}} trying to find one of France or the Channel; but they were all British {{ordnance}} maps of English counties. That set him thinking about languages and trying to recall his seventh-standard French. [...] "Je suis Anglais. C'est une meprise. Je suis arrive par accident ici," [...] he decided upon as convenient phrases. Then {{it occurred to him that}} he would entertain himself by reading Mr. Butteridge's letters and examining his pocket-book, and in this manner he whiled away the afternoon.|$|E
60|$|When {{the captain}} had covered the two miles of beach and climbed the two rocky ridges, and reached his tent, it was long after noon, and {{throwing}} his two <b>bags</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground and covering them with a blanket, he proceeded to prepare his dinner. He laid out a complete working-plan, {{and one of the}} rules he had made was that, if possible, nothing should interfere with his regular meals and hours of sleep. The work he had set for himself was arduous in the extreme, and calculated to tax his energies to the utmost, and he must take very good care of his health and strength. In thinking over the matter, he had feared that the greed of gold might possess him, and that, in his anxiety to carry away as much as he could, he might break down, and everything be lost.|$|E

60|$|The divers {{gazed at}} this sight {{for a few}} moments quite motionless. Then Edgar with one hand turned the lamp full on his companion's front-glass so as to see his face, while with the other hand he pointed to the treasure. Joe's eyes {{expressed}} surprise, and his mouth smiling satisfaction. Turning the light full on his own face to show his comrade that he was similarly impressed, Edgar motioned to Joe to sit down on an iron chest that stood in a corner, and giving the requisite signal with his life-line, went up to the surface. He did this very slowly in order to accustom his frame to the change of pressure both of air and water, for he was well aware of the danger of rapid ascent from such a depth. Soon after, he redescended, bearing several canvas sacks, some cord, and a couple of small crowbars. Placing the lamp in a convenient position, and throwing the <b>bags</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor of the treasure-room, Edgar and Baldwin set to work diligently with the crowbars, broke open the kegs, and emptied their golden contents into one of the bags, until it was quite full; tied up the mouth, fastened it to a rope which communicated with the boat above, and gave the signal to hoist away. The bag quickly rose and vanished.|$|E
