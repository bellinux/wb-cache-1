25|$|In 2005, a flag-to-flag {{rule for}} MotoGP was introduced. Previously, if a race started dry and rain fell, {{officials}} could red-flag (stop) {{the race and}} either restart or resume on 'wet' tyres. Now, when rain falls, a white flag is shown, indicating that riders can pit to swap the motorcycle on which they started the race for an identical one, {{as long as the}} tyres are different (that is, intermediates or slicks instead of wets). Besides different tyres, the wet-weather bikes have steel <b>brake</b> <b>rotors</b> and different brake pads instead of the carbon discs and pads used on the 'dry' bikes. This is because the carbon brakes need to be very hot to function properly, and the water cools them too much. The suspension is also 'softened' up somewhat for the wet weather.|$|E
25|$|The revised GT-R {{features}} an engine with revised mapping, changes to valve timing, larger inlets and a revised exhaust system which boosts rated power to 545bhp and 612Nm of torque from 3200 to 6000rpm.

Starting with the lightweight base model GTU, which came with manual windows, no rear wiper, the sunroof and A/C was dealer optioned, the GTUs added items found on the Turbo model such as four piston front brakes, rear ventilated <b>brake</b> <b>rotors,</b> vehicle speed sensing power steering, one-piece front chin spoiler, cloth covered Turbo model seats, leather wrapped steering wheel, 16 inch wheels, 205/55VR tires, and a GTUs-only 4.300 Viscous-type limited slip differential (all other FC LSD's were 4.100). This allowed quicker acceleration from the non-turbo powered 13B. Mazda built 1100 GTUs in 1989, with the last 100 re-stamped as 1990 models.

40|$|This thesis {{reports the}} {{numerical}} {{investigation of the}} automotive ventilated disc <b>brake</b> <b>rotor.</b> Disc <b>brakes</b> operate {{on the principle of}} friction by converting kinetic energy into heat energy. The main objective of a disc <b>brake</b> <b>rotor</b> is to store this heat energy and dissipate it as soon as possible. This work is carried out in a area where there is very limited understanding. Commercial CFD code FLUENT was used for carrying out the simulations with the rotor rotating in still air. Only one passage and blade were simulated as all the rotor passages were identical. Uniform temperatures were used on the rotor to simulate the braking condition. Sixteen different blade angle sets were simulated and the range of blade angles having the best aero-thermal performance were identified using mass flow rate, rate of heat dissipation and temperature uniformity as performance metrics. The effect of rotational speed and rotor temperature (corresponding to various braking conditions) on the aero-thermal performance was evaluated. The rotor speed and temperature were observed to have significant effect on the rotor performance. The number of blades in the ventilated disc <b>brake</b> <b>rotor</b> was also varied and was observed {{to have an impact on}} the aero-thermal performance of the disc <b>brake</b> <b>rotor.</b> Detailed design changes like inlet chamfer, blade leading edge rounding, and variable thickness blade and passage aspect ratio were incorporated.

Aerodynamic changes include: two additional ducts in the front bumper and removal of the protective honeycomb mesh to improve airflow to the intercooler, a bonnet lip spoiler to direct more air into the engine bay, deeper rear spats, and an additional boot lip spoiler to provide more downforce. The Nismo specification deletes ABS, which are not legal in Group A, and the rear wiper to save weight. The bonnet and front bumpers are aluminium rather than the standard steel, again to save weight. Overall the GT-R Nismo weighs 1400kg compared to 1430kg for the standard GT-R. Tyres are Bridgestone RE71 in 225/55R16 fitted to 16" [...] alloys. Mechanically the GT-R Nismo uses the RB26 engine of the 'standard' GT-R but replaces the stock Garrett T03 turbos with larger T04B models, sacrificing the faster spin up of ceramic turbo wheels for the enhanced reliability of steel wheels.
