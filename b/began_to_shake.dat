5|$|Fiennes won a BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actor for {{his role}} and was {{nominated}} for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. His portrayal ranked 15th on American Film Institute's list of the top 50 film villains of all time, the highest ranking for a depiction of a non-fictional person. When Płaszów survivor Mila Pfefferberg was introduced to Fiennes {{on the set of}} the film, she <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> uncontrollably, as Fiennes, costumed in full SS dress uniform, reminded her of the real Amon Göth.|$|E
5|$|The crew {{spent the}} {{following}} months {{preparing for the}} forthcoming dash for the pole. They built sledges that would facilitate fast travel over rough terrain and constructed kayaks on the Inuit model, for use during the expected water crossings. There were endless trials of special clothing and other gear. Violent and prolonged tremors <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> the ship on 3 January 1895, and two days later the crew disembarked, expecting the ship to be crushed. Instead the pressure lessened, and the crew went back on board and resumed preparations for Nansen's journey. After the excitement {{it was noted that}} Fram had drifted beyond Greely's Farthest North record of 83°24, and on 8 January was at 83°34′N.|$|E
5|$|When {{the chaos}} <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> the {{confidence}} of New York's banks, the city's most famous banker was out of town. J.P. Morgan, the eponymous president of J.P. Morgan & Co., was attending a church convention in Richmond, Virginia. Morgan {{was not only the}} city's wealthiest and most well-connected banker, but he had experience with other similar financial crises—he had helped rescue the U.S. Treasury during the Panic of 1893. As news of the crisis gathered, Morgan returned to Wall Street from his convention late on the night of Saturday, October 19. The following morning, the library of Morgan's brownstone at Madison Avenue and 36th St. had become a revolving door of New York City bank and trust company presidents arriving to share information about (and seek help surviving) the impending crisis.|$|E

25|$|The Mali Empire {{has enjoyed}} {{virtually}} no military reverses {{in its first}} century of existence and had grown at a terrific rate in both size and wealth by the time Ibn Battuta arrived there. However this wealth and power {{may have been the}} reason behind more aggressive attacks by its neighbors as well as the complacency of some of the mansas in dealing with them. Subject peoples on the fringes of the empire slowly <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> off the yoke of Mandinka hegemony. This happened slowly at first, but after 1450 the empire would begin to crumble very rapidly.|$|E
25|$|Nepal {{began to}} {{experience}} some successes {{in international affairs}} during the tenure of Jung Bahadur. To the north, relations with Tibet had been mediated through China since Nepal's defeat in 1792, and during {{the early nineteenth century}} embassies had to make the arduous journey to Beijing every five years with local products as tribute to the Qing emperor. By 1854, however, China was in decline and had fallen into a protracted period of disturbances, including the Taiping Rebellion (1851–64), revolts by Muslim ethnic groups north of Tibet, and war with European powers. The Nepalese mission to Beijing in 1852, just after the death of the sixth Panchen Lama, was allegedly mistreated in Tibet. Because of this slight, the Nepalese government sent a protest letter to Beijing and Lhasa outlining several grievances, including excessive customs duties on Nepalese trade. In 1855 Nepalese troops overran the Kuti and Kairang areas. The Nepalese-Tibetan War lasted for about a year, with successes and failures on both sides, until a treaty negotiated by the Chinese resident and ratified in March 1856 gave Nepalese merchants duty-free trade privileges, forced Tibet to pay an annual tribute of 10,000 rupees to Nepal, and allowed a Nepalese resident in Lhasa. In return, Nepal gave up territorial gains and agreed that it, as well as Tibet, would remain a tributary state subject to China. As the Qing Empire disintegrated later in the century, this tributary status was allowed to lapse, and even Tibet <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> off its subordination.|$|E
25|$|And as {{they did}} still not obtain {{anything}} from me, to the implication of my neighbor, Master Hans took water (during the entire time a cloth had lain on my face), and holding my nose shut with one hand, began to pour water on my abdomen and thence all over my breast, and into my mouth; even as one should drink when he is very thirsty. I think that the can from which he poured out – the water held about three pints. And when I {{was at the end}} of my breath, and wanted to fetch such, I drew the water all into my body, whereupon I suffered such distress, that it would be impossible for me to relate or describe it; but the Lord be forever praised: He kept my lips. And when they could still not obtain anything from me, they caused the cord which was on my thigh to be loosed and applied to a fresh place, and wound it much tighter than before, so that I thought he would kill me, and <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> and tremble greatly. He then proceeded to pour water into me again, so that I think he emptied four such cans, and my body became so full of it, that twice it came out again at the throat. And thus I became so weak. that I fainted; for, when I recovered from my swoon, I found myself alone with Master Hans and Daniel de Keyser. And Master Hans was so busily engaged in loosing all my cords, that it seemed to me that they were concerned over me. But the Lord in a large degree took away my pain every time; whenever it became so severe that I thought it was impossible to bear it, my members became as dead. Eternal praise, thanks, honor, and glory be to the Lord; for when it was over I thought that, by the help of the Lord, I had fought a good fight.|$|E

500|$|People's {{reactions}} varied: some {{described themselves}} as [...] "shocked"; others admitted to being [...] "shaky" [...] or nervous {{for the rest of}} the day. Harold Kittinger, a worker at the Suntone Factory, said, [...] "I do not care to tell anyone I was frightened. But I was not shaking in my shoes. My shoes were moving." [...] One woman hypothesized that the shaking was a [...] "bomb". Grace Standerfer suggested the earthquake was sudden, saying, [...] "I was just scared to death. My husband and I were in the house. The Venetian shades <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> one way, then another. When that awful blast came, he grabbed me and we ran outside. Things were falling and breaking in the house. I said to him, 'This is it.' I thought the world had come to an end. Outside, wires were moving. There was no wind. The ground was quivering under our feet. I was so scared. I did not know I was scared." [...] People in the community of Mount Vernon, Illinois, were frightened by the shaking. However, some did not notice the earthquake; Jane Bessen said her party was [...] "in a car... to Evansville and didn't know about it until we got there".|$|E
500|$|On the {{way back}} to the ashram, Uttanka had tied the {{earrings}} in a deerskin. While travelling, he stopped and climbed a tree to pluck some fruit for his refreshment. He tied the deerskin to a branch, but the deerskin became untied and the earrings fell on the ground. A snake immediately got hold of the earrings and vanished into an ant-hill. In grief, Uttanka fell from the tree. For 35 days, he dug the ant-hill with a stick to get the snake out and retrieve the earrings. The earth <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> due to the repeated strikes. At that time, Indra– riding his chariot– saw Uttanka's futile efforts. As in the Adi Parva, Indra used his Vajra to enable Uttanka to enter the beautiful Nagaloka. There, Uttanka saw a horse with the [...] "tail which had black and white hair, a copper-coloured muzzle, and eye of the same colour that seemed to flame forth in splendor". The horse told Uttanka to blow from behind, as in the Adi Parva version. The horse was the fire god Agni who was the guru of Gautama, who had offered his help to retrieve the earrings. When Uttanka followed the directive of the horse, flames and smoke emerged from every pore of the horse and choked the dwellings of the snakes. Thus choked, the serpents, headed by Vasuki came out, worshipped Uttanka and surrendered the earrings and asked that they be pardoned. When Uttanka returned to the hermitage of Gautama to give the earrings to Ahalya, he narrated the sequence of events that occurred in procuring the earrings.|$|E
2500|$|On 6 January 1944, Learmonth led a {{formation}} of three No. 14 Squadron Bristol Beauforts on an exercise off Rottnest Island with ships of the US Navy. At {{a height of}} [...] and about [...] north-west of Rottnest Island his Beaufort <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>shake</b> violently. The Australian-built Beauforts were plagued by a mysterious problem that had destroyed over 90 aircraft and killed many crews, including many under training at RAAF East Sale. Learmonth recognised that the violent shaking was driven by the tail of his aircraft and he called Flight Lieutenant Ken Hewitt, the pilot {{of one of the}} other Beauforts, to fly in close and observe his tail. Hewitt could see the control rod to the elevator trim tab on Learmonth’s Beaufort, hanging down. It had separated from the tab, allowing the tab and elevator to oscillate and drive the violent shaking of the whole aircraft. Learmonth used his radio to advise the crews of the other two Beauforts what he was observing. Shortly afterwards, the trim tab flicked to the extreme up position, over-powering Learmonth and forcing the aircraft to descend rapidly. After less than a minute Learmonth’s Beaufort crashed into the sea, killing Learmonth and his three crew members. The wireless operator on one of the other Beauforts reported sighting a parachute {{on the surface of the}} water.|$|E
