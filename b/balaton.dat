5|$|The Italian convoy {{escorted by}} Borea was {{attacked}} by the Austro-Hungarian destroyers Csepel and <b>Balaton</b> at approximately 03:24. The Austro-Hungarians sank Borea and a munitions ship, and a second was set on fire and abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Some Tiger IIs {{were also}} present during the Soviet Vistula–Oder and East Prussian Offensives in January 1945, {{as well as}} the German Lake <b>Balaton</b> Offensive in Hungary in March 1945, the Battle of the Seelow Heights in April 1945, and the Battle of Berlin {{at the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|Andrew {{continued}} to conspire against Emeric, although Pope Innocent III continued urging Andrew {{to launch a}} crusade. On 10 March 1199, Emeric forced Boleslaus, Bishop of Vác, who was a supporter of Andrew, to give him documents that proved the conspiracy against him. In the summer of that year, Emeric defeated Andrew's army near Lake <b>Balaton,</b> which made Andrew flee to Austria. A papal legate named Gregory arrived in Hungary to mediate a reconciliation between the two brothers. According to the brothers' treaty, Emeric once again granted Croatia and Dalmatia to Andrew {{in the summer of}} 1200.|$|E
5|$|The Mirabello group {{engaged the}} Austro-Hungarian cruisers at 07:00, but were heavily outgunned, and instead {{attempted}} to shadow the fleeing cruisers. At 07:45, Rear Admiral Acton's ships encountered the destroyers Csepel and <b>Balaton.</b> After 20 minutes, the Italian destroyers {{were able to}} close {{the distance to the}} Austro-Hungarian ships; the two groups engaged in a short artillery duel before a shot from Csepel struck Aquila and disabled the ship's boilers. By this time, the Austro-Hungarian destroyers were under the cover of the coastal batteries at Durazzo, and were able to make good their escape.|$|E
5|$|Unaware that Novara {{had been}} disabled, and fearing that his ships would be drawn {{too close to}} the Austrian naval base at Cattaro, Acton broke off the pursuit. The {{destroyer}} Acerbi misread the signal, and attempted to launch a torpedo attack, but was driven off by the combined fire of Novara, Saida, and Helgoland. At 12:05, Acton realized the dire situation Novara was in, but by this time, the Sankt Georg group was too close. The Sankt Georg group rendezvoused with Novara, Saida, and Helgoland, and Csepel and <b>Balaton</b> reached the scene as well. The entire group returned to Cattaro together.|$|E
5|$|After a short break, the {{division}} was allocated to a {{sector of the}} Margarethe Line, a series of fixed defensive works south of Lake <b>Balaton</b> which held up the Soviet advance. After several Red Army assaults were repulsed, static trench warfare developed between December 1944 and January 1945. In early March 1945, a few units took part in Operation Frühlingserwachen (Spring Awakening), {{which was to be}} Germany's last major offensive. Meanwhile, from December 1944 to March 1945, the rest of {{the division}} remained at Barcs rebuilding. In February, they had been joined by the divisional pioneer battalion, which had finally managed to withdraw from Bosnia. On 16 March, the Soviets launched the Vienna Offensive, bypassing the Barcs area. That night, the division attacked the flanks of the Soviet drive at Heresznye, where it undertook its last offensive operation of the war.|$|E
5|$|Budapest fell on 13 February. Hitler ordered Dietrich's 6th SS Panzer Army to {{move into}} Hungary to protect the Nagykanizsa oilfields and refineries, which he deemed the most {{strategically}} valuable fuel reserves on the Eastern Front. Frühlingserwachsen (Operation Spring Awakening), the final German offensive in the east, took place in early March. German forces attacked near Lake <b>Balaton,</b> with 6th SS Panzer Army advancing north towards Budapest and 2nd Panzer Army moving east and south. Dietrich's forces at first made good progress, but as they drew near the Danube, the combination of muddy terrain and strong Soviet resistance brought them to a halt. By 16 March the battle was lost. Enraged by the defeat, Hitler ordered the Waffen-SS units involved to remove their cuff titles as a mark of disgrace. Dietrich refused {{to carry out the}} order.|$|E
5|$|Grand Prince Géza died in 997. Stephen convoked an {{assembly}} at Esztergom where his supporters declared him grand prince. Initially, he only controlled the northwestern {{regions of the}} Carpathian Basin; {{the rest of the}} territory was still dominated by tribal chieftains. Stephen's ascension to the throne was in line with the principle of primogeniture, which prescribed that a father was succeeded by his son. On the other hand, it contradicted the traditional idea of seniority, according to which Géza should have been succeeded by the most senior member of the Árpád dynasty, which was Koppány at that time. Koppány, who held the title Duke of Somogy, had for many years administered the regions of Transdanubia south of Lake <b>Balaton.</b>|$|E
5|$|Pope Innocent III urged Andrew to lead {{a crusade}} the Holy Land, but Andrew hatched a new {{conspiracy}} against Emeric {{with the help of}} John, Abbot of Pannonhalma, Boleslaus, Bishop of Vác, and many other prelates and lords. The Pope threatened him with excommunication if he failed to fulfill his father's vow, but Andrew did not yield. The conspiracy was uncovered on 10 March 1199, when King Emeric seized letters written by Andrew's partisans to Bishop Boleslaus. That summer, royal troops routed Andrew's army near Lake <b>Balaton,</b> and Andrew fled to Austria. A papal legate mediated a reconciliation between Andrew and Emeric, who allowed Andrew to return to Croatia and Dalmatia in 1200. Andrew married Gertrude of Merania; her father, Berthold, Duke of Merania, owned extensive domains in the Holy Roman Empire along the borders of Andrew's duchy.|$|E
5|$|The Hungarians {{adopted the}} ancient (Celtic, Dacian or Germanic) {{names of the}} longest rivers in the Carpathian Basin from a Slavic-speaking population. For instance, the Hungarian names of the rivers Danube (Duna), Dráva, Garam, Maros, Olt, Száva, Tisza and Vág were {{borrowed}} from Slavs. The Hungarians also adopted {{a great number of}} hydronyms of Slavic origin, including <b>Balaton</b> ("swamp"), Beszterce ("swift river"), Túr ("aurochs' stream") and Zagyva ("sooty river"). Place names of Slavic origin abound across the Carpathian Basin. For instance, Csongrád ("black fortress"), Nógrád ("new fortress"), Visegrád ("citadel") and other early medieval fortresses bore a Slavic name, while the name of Keszthely preserved the Latin word for fortress (castellum) with Slavic mediation.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to being found in Villány and Szekszárd, Cabernet Franc is also present in Eger, and in South <b>Balaton</b> and Sopron vineyards, to a lesser extent. Cabernet Franc often complements Bordeaux-style blends from these regions and occasionally {{plays a role in}} rosé production.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} Old Church Slavonic writing {{includes}} a northern tradition begun by {{the mission to}} Great Moravia, including a short mission in the <b>Balaton</b> principality, and a Bulgarian tradition begun {{by some of the}} missionaries who relocated to Bulgaria after the expulsion from Great Moravia.|$|E
25|$|A {{document}} {{written in}} Salzburg in 871 {{is the first}} document mentioning the early medieval city under the name Quinque Basilicae (see above). During the 9th century, the city was inhabited by Slavic and Avar peoples and {{was part of the}} <b>Balaton</b> Principality, a Frankish vassal state.|$|E
25|$|It {{lies not}} far from Lake <b>Balaton</b> at the meeting point of five routes. For centuries the town has been a {{connecting}} link. Goods from Slavonia were transported to Graz via Nagykanizsa, and the town {{played an important role}} in the trade from the Adriatic Sea to the Alpine region, Vienna, and Budapest.|$|E
25|$|Clubbing and {{electronic}} dance music started gaining popularity in Hungary following {{the change of}} regime in 1989 and corresponding to Electronic music's increasing popularity in the worldwide musical mainstream. The political freedom and cultural boom of western culture {{opened the way for}} the clubbing scene, with several venues starting all around the country, especially in Budapest and around Lake <b>Balaton.</b>|$|E
25|$|In February 1945 German and Hungarian cavalry {{divisions}} {{were thrown}} into the Lake <b>Balaton</b> offensive; after a limited success, German forces were ground down by the Soviet counteroffensive. Remnants of Army cavalry fell back into Austria; 22,000 men surrendered to the Western allies, bringing with them 16,000 horses. Remnants of SS cavalry, merged into the 37th SS Division, followed the same route.|$|E
25|$|A site at Brunn am Gebirge {{just south}} of Vienna seems to {{document}} the transition to LBK. The site was densely settled in a long house pattern around 5550–5200. The lower layers feature Starčevo-type plain pottery, with large number of stone tools made of material from near Lake <b>Balaton,</b> Hungary. Over the time frame, LBK pottery and animal husbandry increased, while the use of stone tools decreased.|$|E
25|$|There is 1,439 {{hectares}} (3,556 acres) of Grüner Veltliner {{planted in}} Hungary where the grape {{is known as}} Zöld Veltlini. The majority of these plantings {{are found in the}} western wine regions around Lake <b>Balaton,</b> the northern vineyards {{in the foothills of the}} Mátra mountains and the southern wine regions of Tolna County and Kunság. Some plantings of Grüner Veltliner can also be found in Bulgaria.|$|E
25|$|On 7 March 1945, {{the platoon}} took up {{defensive}} positions {{near the village}} of Sheregeyesh, west of Lake <b>Balaton.</b> After a ten-minute artillery bombardment, two German battalions and seven tanks attacked the positions. Yunev's machine gun fire killed numerous German soldiers, repulsing the attack. On 10 March, Yunev and his platoon repulsed another counterattack, killing 83 German soldiers. On 13 March, he was wounded.|$|E
25|$|Hegyalja Festival, held in Tokaj, the {{historic}} wine-region of the country, {{is the largest}} such event in the Northern part. Visited by 50.000 guests each year, it showcases mainly hard rock and rock formations, but many more genres are present. BalaTone, another major event near lake <b>Balaton</b> is held in Zánka. Magyar Sziget, held in Verőce, has a nationalist theme, with mainly right-wing performers, bands representing the recently emerged nationalistic rock, folk and folk-rock.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} Christianity in Hungary {{began in the}} Roman {{province}} of Pannonia where the presence of Christian communities is first attested in the 3rdcentury. Although the territory was under the successive control of the Huns, Germanic peoples, and Avars from the 5thcentury, Christian communities may have survived {{in the region of}} Lake <b>Balaton</b> up until the 9thcentury. Accordingly, Christianity had existed in the present-day territory of Hungary before the Hungarians settled there around 900AD, but the question of continuity is unresolved.|$|E
25|$|In May 1944, Glagolev was {{transferred}} to command the 31st Army. He led the army during Operation Bagration and its Vitebsk–Orsha and Minsk Offensives. In October, the army fought in the Gumbinnen Operation. In January 1945, Glagolev became {{the commander of the}} 9th Guards Army, composed of airborne divisions converted to infantry. The army advanced into Hungary as part of the 2nd Ukrainian Front and then the 3rd Ukrainian Front. It fought in the <b>Balaton</b> Offensive, Vienna Offensive and the Prague Offensive.|$|E
25|$|The {{remaining}} German and Hungarian units within Budapest surrendered on 13 February 1945. Although the German {{forces in}} Hungary were generally defeated, the Germans {{had one more}} surprise for the Soviets. On 6 March 1945, the Germans launched the Lake <b>Balaton</b> Offensive, attempting {{to hold on to}} the Axis' last source of oil. It was their final operation of the war and it quickly failed. By 19 March 1945, Soviet troops had recaptured all the territory lost during the 13-day German offensive.|$|E
25|$|On October 14, 2008, {{an article}} {{appeared}} in the Fairmont Sentinel, of Fairmont, Minnesota, reporting that Charter was selling parts of their system to Midcontinent Communications, including Charter's offices in Bemidji and International Falls, Minnesota. Starting February 1, 2009, Midcontinent Communications (now known as Midco) took over some Charter's cable system in Minnesota including <b>Balaton,</b> Bemidji, Canby, Ely, Fairmont, International Falls, Littlefork, Sherburn, and surrounding communities. Other areas in Minnesota would have sold to Comcast, but the deal fell through.|$|E
25|$|At present 31 diesel Desiros are {{in service}} with MÁV (including the eight units from Greece), mainly as {{suburban}} trains on the regional line between Budapest-Esztergom and Budapest - Lajosmizse {{and as an}} InterCity between Budapest and Baja. On weekends the units also used as peak inter-city trains from Budapest to Baja and Sátoraljaújhely and as fast trains from Budapest to Tapolca. During the summer months (when fewer units are used on the Budapest suburban routes) Desiros appear on some local train diagram {{on the north shore}} of the Lake <b>Balaton.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{origins of}} the Hungarian indie music scene {{go back to the}} early 1980s when Európa Kiadó, Sziami and <b>Balaton</b> {{released}} their records. The first revival took place in the mid-1990s when bands like Sexepil gained international success, followed by Heaven Street Seven. The second and most notable revival of the indie-alternative scene took place in the mid-2000s when bands like Amber Smith, The Moog signed to international labels. Other notable bands include EZ Basic, The KOLIN and Dawnstar. The Hungarian indie scene is closely intertwined with electronic music therefore artists like Yonderboi and Žagar are often considered part of the indie scene.|$|E
25|$|In January 1945 it was {{transferred}} to the 26th Army in Hungary, to defend against a German attack across the Leithain the final stages of the Budapest Offensive. Surrounded on January 20 in the vicinity of Aba and Jakabszállás, the following day it broke through and reached friendly lines. On January 28 it received reinforcements and took part in the Soviet counter-offensive between Leithe and Danube. It later took part in defence against the <b>Balaton</b> Offensive and then the Vienna Offensive, operating from the town of Nagykanizsa. On May 10 it linked up with American troops from the 80th Infantry Division of XX Corps at the Enns.|$|E
25|$|With his regiment, Gille {{participated in}} the Operation Barbarossa in 1941 and in advance to Kuban in 1942; he {{received}} the Knight's Cross on 8 October 1942. He then took command of the Wiking Division on the Eastern Front. Early in 1944, Gille {{participated in the}} breakout of the Group Stemmermann from the Korsun-Cherkassy Pocket. Gille received the diamonds to his Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords on 19 April 1944. In January 1945 Gille, {{as leader of the}} IV SS Panzer Corps, participated in a failed attempt to relieve the encircled German and Hungarian troops in the Battle of Budapest. In March 1945 he led the IV SS Panzer Corps in the failed Lake <b>Balaton</b> Offensive. He surrendered to the U.S forces in Austria.|$|E
25|$|After Hunnish rule {{faded in}} the 6th century AD, the Germanic Ostrogoths, Lombards and Slavs came to Pannonia, whereas the Gepids had a {{presence}} {{in the eastern part of}} the Carpathian Basin for about 100 years. In the 560s the Avars founded the Avar Khaganate, a state that maintained supremacy in the region for more than two centuries and had the military power to launch attacks against its neighboring empires. The Avar Khaganate was weakened by constant wars and outside pressure, and the Franks under Charlemagne managed to defeat the Avars to end their 250-year rule. In the middle of the 9th century, the Slavic <b>Balaton</b> Principality, also known as Lower Pannonia, was established by the Franks as a frontier march when they destroyed the Avar state in the western part of the Pannonian plain, however this vassal state was destroyed in 900 by Hungarian tribes.|$|E
25|$|On 8 November 1944, Germany {{delivered}} sixteen Fw 190 F-8 fighters (G5+01 and G5+02) to the Hungarian Royal Air Force for training. They {{were initially}} based in Börgönd, near Lake <b>Balaton,</b> {{under the command}} of Lfl. Kdo 4, Fliegerführer 102 Hungarn/VIII Fliegerkorps (HQ in Debrecen). A number of recruits from the Önálló Zuhanóbombazó Osztály (independent dive bomber wing) based at same airfield were sent to Flugzeugführerschule B2 in Neuruppin for ground attack and air combat training in the Fw 190. At the same time, Hungary established the 101. Csatarepülő Osztály as a specialized Fw 190 operational training unit. The Hungarian 190s were originally intended for use on the Eastern front in offensive actions against Soviet armored units along with other Hungarian dive bomber and anti-tank units. In the end, they were used only over Hungarian soil in defensive operations against USAAF and Soviet Air force units. In addition, a small numbers of Fw 190G fighter-bombers were used in air-to-ground operations.|$|E
25|$|The {{brothers}} also founded an academy, initially led by Methodius, {{which produced}} hundreds of Slavic clerics. A well-educated class was essential for administration of all early-feudal states and Great Moravia was no exception. Vita Methodii mentions bishop of Nitra as Svatopluk I's chancellor and even Prince Koceľ of the <b>Balaton</b> Principality {{was said to}} master the Glagolitic script. Location of the Great Moravian academy has not been identified, but the possible sites include Mikulčice (where some styli {{have been found in}} an ecclesiastical building), Devín Castle (with a building identified as a probable school), and Nitra (with its Episcopal basilica and monastery). When Methodius’ disciples were expelled from Great Moravia by Svätopluk I in 885, they disseminated their knowledge (including the Glagolitic script) to other Slavic countries, such as Bulgaria, Croatia, and Bohemia. They created the Cyrillic script, which became the standard alphabet in the Kievan Rus' (modern day Russia, Ukraine and Belarus). The Great Moravian cultural heritage survived in Bulgarian seminaries, paving the way for Christianization of Kievan Rus'.|$|E
25|$|It was {{transferred}} to the 3rd Ukrainian Front on 9 March. Between 8 and 14 March the army was moved from the Kecslemet area across the Danube into the Zámoly sector, replacing the 4th Guards Army. Between 16 March and 15 April, the army fought in the Vienna Offensive. Units of the army broke through German defences north of Székesfehérvár in conjunction with the 4th Guards Army. Advancing in the left flank and rear of the 6th SS Panzer Army, the 9th Guards Army broke through other German units between Lake <b>Balaton</b> and Velence. For the assault on Vienna, the army's 39th Guards Rifle Corps would follow the attack of the 6th Guards Army in the southwestern sector. The 38th Guards Rifle Corps was to cut the Vienna-Linz road and use two divisions to protect the attack from the west. The 37th Guards Rifle Corps protected the assault force's left flank. The 9th Guards Army attacked the northwestern road out of Vienna in conjunction with the 6th Guards Tank Army and broke German resistance in early April. On 13 April, the army helped capture Vienna. The army then fought in the Prague Offensive, where it captured Znojmo on 8 May in conjunction with the 7th Guards Army. It also captured Retz and Písek, ending the war on the Elbe.|$|E
500|$|Andrew came to Hungary for {{the first}} time in 1278 at the {{invitation}} of a powerful lord, Ivan Kőszegi. Kőszegi wanted to play Andrew off against Ladislaus IV of Hungary. Andrew, who was the only male member of the royal family besides the king, adopted the title of [...] "Duke of Slavonia, Dalmatia and Croatia" [...] and marched as far as Lake <b>Balaton.</b> Andrew achieved nothing, however, and went back to Venice in autumn.|$|E
500|$|The first written {{reference}} to a settlement named [...] "Brezalauspurc" [...] dates to 907 and {{is related to the}} Battle of Pressburg, during which a Bavarian army was defeated by the Hungarians. It is connected to the fall of Great Moravia, already weakened by its own inner decline and under the attacks of the Hungarians. The exact location of the battle remains unknown, and some interpretations place it west of Lake <b>Balaton.</b>|$|E
500|$|In {{the south}} the Siege of Budapest raged. Three German {{attempts}} {{to relieve the}} encircled Hungarian capital city failed, and Budapest fell to the Soviets on 13 February. Adolf Hitler insisted on a counter-attack to recapture the Drau-Danube triangle. The goal was to secure the oil region of Nagykanizsa and regain the Danube River for future operations, [...] but the depleted German forces had been given an impossible task. By 16 March, the German Lake <b>Balaton</b> Offensive had failed, and a counter-attack by the Red Army took back in 24 hours everything the Germans had taken ten days to gain. On 30 March, the Soviets entered Austria; and in the Vienna Offensive they captured Vienna on 13 April.|$|E
500|$|Under {{the command}} of Horthy, three Austro-Hungarian cruisers: Novara, Saida, and Helgoland, {{modified}} to resemble large British destroyers, were to attack the drifters {{on the night of}} 14 May and attempt to destroy as many as possible before daybreak. The destroyers Csepel and <b>Balaton</b> were to mount a diversionary raid off the Albanian coast in order to confuse any Allied counter-attack. Two Austro-Hungarian U-boats— and , along with the German U-boat —were to participate in the operation as well. A supporting force composed of the armored cruiser , two destroyers, and four 250t-class torpedo boats was on standby if the raiders ran into trouble. The old pre-dreadnought battleship [...] and three more 250t-class torpedo boats were also available if necessary.|$|E
