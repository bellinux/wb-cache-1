25|$|The spars are {{designed}} by C and fabricated by Offshore Spars. The standard boat has a keel stepped non-tapered double spreader masthead sloop rig, with rod rigging and a hydraulic backstay adjuster. the R and XL variants have a tapered triple-spreader mast with all rod rigging, plus runners, checkstays, and an adjustable <b>babystay</b> for mast bend control. The backstay is split, with two hydraulic rams, on the boats with walk through transom (37+ and XL). The masthead, gooseneck and boom end are custom machined aluminum, welded {{to the one}} piece extrusion. The aerodynamic spreaders are secured to the mast via machined, continuous aluminum spreader bars. They precisely fit the spreader bases and traverse the mast and along with separate support bars carry the compression loads exerted by the shrouds. On the 37R (and 37XL) mast the middle and lower spreaders are slightly swept back, 2° for the middle spreaders, 4° for the lowers.|$|E

The factory modification is to cut a window in the keel and fill it with a sand/resin mixture. Post delivery keel modifications have included shaving lead off the sides of the keel and then building it back up with micro-balloons. C made full size keel section drawings available to permit fairing the keel after modification. The C 37R Wave Train, hull number 14 in the 37R production run, was so extensively customised by the factory (waterproof crash bulkhead forward, all bulkheads tabbed to the deck, upgraded deck and bulkhead construction, custom Britt Chance aluminum & lead keel) for a customer named Watt W. Webb that construction drawings specific to this boat were produced.|$|E
