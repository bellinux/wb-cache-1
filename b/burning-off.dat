50|$|Fibrous {{ceramic filters}} {{are made from}} several {{different}} types of ceramic fibers that are mixed {{together to form a}} porous media. This media can be formed into almost any shape and can be customized to suit various applications. The porosity can be controlled in order to produce high flow, lower efficiency or high efficiency lower volume filtration. Fibrous filters have an advantage over wall flow design of producing lower back pressure.Ceramic wall-flow filters remove carbon particulates almost completely, including fine particulates less than 100 nanometers (nm) diameter with an efficiency of greater than 95% in mass and greater than 99% in number of particles over a wide range of engine operating conditions. Since the continuous flow of soot into the filter would eventually block it, it is necessary to 'regenerate' the filtration properties of the filter by <b>burning-off</b> the collected particulate on a regular basis. Soot particulates burn-off forms water and CO2 in small quantity amounting to less than 0.05% of the CO2 emitted by the engine.|$|E

Among the three catalysts, Cu/CeO 2 - AC exhibited the highest catalytic activity meanwhile the <b>burning-off</b> of AC was restrained {{to the largest}} extent. In the Cu/CeO 2 - AC catalyst, Cu acted as catalytically active sites and CeO 2 {{played an important role}} in enhancing the selectivities of AC towards NO reduction and improving the tolerance to poison by water vapour and SO 2...|$|E
40|$|The adsorption-desorption isotherms of N 2 at 77 K on the {{graphite}} samples, {{which had}} been obtained through burning off a natural graphite with O 2 -H 2 O gas mixture, were measured volumetrically.

Both untreated graphite and the 20 %-burnt-off one gave the similar adsorption isotherms of Type Ⅱ which have the Joyner-Emmett step near the relative pressure of 0. 4, while the shape of the isotherm on the 53 %-burnt-off graphite looks stepwise.

40|$|Over Mo/HZSM- 5 catalysts, various {{carbonaceous}} depositions {{occurred during}} the course of methane dehydroaromatization(MDA). These species of surface carbon formed on HZSM- 5 zeolite or Mo/HZSM- 5 catalysts with different Mo loadings were investigated by means of TPH, TPCOz and TPO in combination with thermal gravimetric analysis(TG). The results of TG revealed that, the total amount of coke formed on 6 Mo/MCM- 22 (luring TPSR is larger than those formed on HZSM- 5 zeolite, 2 Mo/HZSM- 5 and 10 Mo/HZSM- 5 catalysts. The TPO profiles recorded during the procedure of coke <b>burning-off</b> show two different temperature peaks. The results of TPO and TG after TPH suggested that, the TPH experiments only had an effect on the coke burnt-off at a high temperature, but didn't result in the diminishing of the coke burnt-off at low temperature peak. On the other hand, the result of the coked catalyst after succeeding TPM experiments exhibited an obvious reduction in the areas of both the high and low temperature peaks, particularly {{in the area of the}} low temperature peak. The study on the catalysts with different Mo loadings suggested that, the percentage of the coke burnt-off at a low temperature turned larger with the increase of Mo loading, respectively. And the change trend of the coke burnt-off at a high temperature was opposite exactly. By using the experiments of TPSR, TPH, TPCO 2 and TG, quantitative analysis of the coke and the kinetics of its <b>burning-off</b> process have been done. The results show that, either TPH or TPCO 2 can diminish the starting temperature and decrease the activation energy, and there are some differences among the catalysts with various Mo loadings...|$|E
30|$|In the dry sclerophyll {{forests of}} Tasmania, Jackson calculates, forest litter accumulates {{at the rate}} of 3 to 25 cwt [Editor’s note: Imperial cwt = 112 pounds] per acre per year to a steady level of 30 tons per acre. Fires in these forests with full fuel {{complements}} become totally uncontrollable, with vast damage being done to plants, animals, and man. It is ironical that a policy of fire prevention may have brought our bush and forests up to their present dangerous state, and the series of catastrophic fires in recent years {{may be the result of}} discontinuing the Aboriginal custom of regular burning. I have been interested in recent weeks to read that a policy of <b>burning-off</b> may be initiated as a new method of forest conservation.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{deactivation}} and regeneration of naphtha reforming PtReGe/Al 2 O 3 and PtReSn/Al 2 O 3 catalysts {{prepared by}} catalytic reduction were studied. The extent {{and nature of}} coke deposition as determined by TPO were related to catalyst properties such as dispersion, acidity and Cl content. The PtReSn catalyst was the most resistant to coke deactivation. Regeneration was performed by calcination in oxygen at 450 degrees C or ozone at 125 degrees C at variable regeneration times. Regenerated catalysts were evaluated by cyclopentane hydrogenolysis, cyclohexane dehydrogenation and n-heptane reaction tests. Regeneration by oxygen <b>burning-off</b> was the most effective for decoking. However, oxygen combustion produced more segregation of the metal function than ozone regeneration. With the regeneration conditions used in this work, the original acidity of the catalysts cannot be recovered...|$|E

3000|$|... “Aerogels, {{the lightest}} and {{transparent}} nanostuctured materials, are {{obtained from a}} gel by the replacement of liquid present in the pores of gel with air”. They are extremely low dense materials {{with a wide variety}} of outstanding properties such as low thermal conductivity, high porosity and large surface area [1, 2, 3]. Exhibiting such exceptional properties, aerogels are applicable in various fields such as thermal insulation, catalysis and sensors, etc. [4, 5]. The preparation of aerogels can be performed through supercritical drying (drying above critical temperature (Tc) and pressure (Pc) of liquid present in the pores of gel) or ambient pressure drying (drying at ambient pressure and temperature[*]>[*] 150  °C) or freeze drying (drying of frozen gel in vacuum) methods. Recent developments have shown great potential of the ambient pressure drying as an alternative and simple method for the synthesis of aerogels replacing the expensive and energy intensive methods of supercritical and freeze drying. Following this, till date the synthesis and characterizations of zirconia (ZrO 2) aerogels via ambient pressure drying was reported by few research groups [6, 7, 8]. These reports manifested the studies on the influence of propylene oxide as complexing agent, hydrolysis water, and heat treatment on the pore size and surface area of zirconia aerogels. It is well known that the pore sizes in the materials (bulk or thin film) can be controlled in the mesopore range (2 – 50  nm) by addition of surfactant (organic additive) which acts as structure directing agents [9, 10]. Because of the small pore sizes, the mesoporous materials have found extensive applications in the field of designing catalyst support, templates, adsorbents and solid oxide fuel cells [11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. To obtain mesoporous structures, the surfactants like Brij- 76, Brij- 58 and Pluronic F 127 are being used for the network-formation. The surfactant mediated synthesis of mesoporous materials can be considered as the electrostatic interactions between the ions of metal species and the head groups of charged surfactant as well as the hydrogen bonding interactions between the neutral primary amine micelles, and neutral inorganic species [16, 17]. The work on the synthesis of titania- and zirconia-based mesoporous materials has been reported by elsewhere [18, 19]. Much attention is focussed on the ZrO 2 -based catalyst since it has acidic and basic character as well as oxidizing and reducing chemical properties. Moreover, zirconia aerogels exhibit good textural characteristics which help to enhance the catalytic activity, thermal stability, and resistance to poisoning [20]. There are several reports on the catalytic applications of zirconia aerogels related to the modification of their surfaces by metals (copper, iron) or ions (sulfate, phosphate, tungstate) and to the use of surfactant like cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB), octyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (OTAB), etc. The catalytic performances of zirconia xerogels and aerogels were studied in the dehydration of methylpentan- 2 -ol reaction and CO=CO 2 hydrogenation by few research groups [21, 22]. Kalies et al. presented the catalytic activity of Pt doped zirconia aerogel for hydrogenation of methoxy moieties [23]. Suh et al. reported the catalysis of surfactant (CTAB and OTAB) mediated zirconia in the skeletal isomerization of 1 -butene [24]. Further, the catalytic properties of sulfated zirconia aerogels and xerogels at various calcination temperatures were studied by Ghorbel et al. [25]. The sulfated zirconia aerogels doped with cerium were found to have higher acidity leading to their good activity in n-hexane isomerization reaction in the wide temperature range [26]. Interestingly, the iron-doped zirconia solid solution aerogels exhibited an excellent catalytic performance for the solvent-free aerobic oxidation of n-hexadecane which can be recycled five times without significant loss of activity [27]. Moreover, mesoporous sulfated zirconia aerogels doped with chromium showed the improvement of n-hexane isomerization reaction by <b>burning-off</b> coke [28].|$|E
