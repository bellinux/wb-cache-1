SmackDown general manager Theodore Long restarted the match after stating that the ban that former general manager Vickie Guerrero had placed on the move was still in effect. Punk won the match with his Anaconda Vise when referee Scott Armstrong called for the bell despite Undertaker never submitting (reminiscent to the Montreal Screwjob, {{which took place in}} the same venue in 1997). The feud between the two continued and at the Hell in a Cell PPV, Punk lost the World Heavyweight Championship to The Undertaker in a Hell in a Cell match.

Allegany State Park's 18 mi section of the trail includes 4 lean-tos, two in the Quaker Area, and the other two in the Red House area.

After successfully defending the title against Sheamus at Hell in a Cell, Orton feuded with Wade Barrett, who was blackmailing Cena to help him capture the title. Orton lost to Barrett via disqualification at <b>Bragging</b> <b>Rights,</b> but retained the title. He defeated Barrett in a rematch at Survivor Series after Cena, who was the special guest referee, turned on Barrett. After one final match on the November 22 episode of Raw, The Miz immediately cashed in his Money in the Bank briefcase and quickly beat Orton to win the title.

Sometimes he favored heel wrestlers over face wrestlers. At the end of December, Punk left the commentary team after assaulting John Cena on Raw and SmackDown with a chair. Punk later revealed that his motives for the attacks were that he had joined and assumed control of The Nexus.

Over the next few weeks, The Miz attempted to cash in his Money in the Bank contract on the WWE Champion Sheamus, but was continually interrupted by other wrestlers before the matches could occur, which meant that he retained the contract for future use. Daniel Bryan returned to WWE at SummerSlam, taking The Miz's place on Team WWE, causing The Miz to attack him. This began a rivalry between the two, with The Miz losing the United States Championship to Bryan at the Night of Champions event in September. The following month, Miz defeated John Cena to become the captain of Team Raw, but at the <b>Bragging</b> <b>Rights</b> pay-per-view Team Raw—The Miz (with Alex Riley), R-Truth, John Morrison, Santino Marella, Sheamus, CM Punk, and Ezekiel Jackson—were unsuccessful in defeating Team SmackDown.|$|E

And a match in 2016 between the two teams broke the record A-League crowd with 61,880 fans attending the match at ANZ Stadium.

Back in the U.S., the Rams and Minutemen jockeyed at the top of the ACHA and ECWHL as usual, with neither ranked lower than fifth all year long. Rhode Island won the conference <b>bragging</b> <b>rights</b> with a 2–0 ECWHL championship game win to follow up the regular season title.

Jeri-Show successfully defended the title against Cryme Tyme at SummerSlam, MVP and Mark Henry at Breaking Point and Rey Mysterio and Batista at Hell in a Cell. At <b>Bragging</b> <b>Rights,</b> Big Show represented Team Raw, but he betrayed and attacked his teammates, which led to Team SmackDown winning, so that he could receive an opportunity at the World Heavyweight Championship.

Since 2002–03, one of the two has been among the ACHA's final four to end 12 of 15 seasons (2008–09, 2014–15 and 2015–16 are the exceptions). Somewhat surprisingly, given all of that, UMass has only run into Rhode Island five times at nationals, and only three times with something other than <b>bragging</b> <b>rights</b> attached (two meetings, both URI wins, were the 2008 third-place game and a 2016 pool round meeting after both teams had already been eliminated). In 2007, the Rams edged UMass 1–0 at the Mullins Center to end the bottom-seeded Minutemen's chances in the quarterfinals. A 2012 pool round game ended in a 1–1 tie as Sarah Oteri and Johanna Leskinen traded goals while Chelsea Corell and Kayla DiLorenzo traded saves, although the Minutemen ultimately advanced to the tournament semifinals ahead of Rhode Island. In 2014, the biggest game of the group took place, in the national semifinals. Corell and DiLorenzo (both of whom ended the year among the national top five in goals against average, save percentage and shutouts) engaged in another goaltending duel, but first-period markers from Caleigh Labossiere and Raschelle Bräm proved decisive in a 2–1 UMass victory.|$|E
25|$|Mysterio {{returned}} from his suspension at Hell in a Cell, teaming with former tag team partner Batista to face Jeri-Show (Chris Jericho and Big Show) for the Unified Tag Team Championships. They failed to win the titles, as Mysterio was KO punched and pinned by Big Show. At <b>Bragging</b> <b>Rights,</b> Mysterio was unsuccessful in winning the World Heavyweight Championship in a Fatal Four-Way match involving Batista, CM Punk, and then-champion The Undertaker. During the match, Mysterio broke up Batista's pin on Undertaker possibly costing him the match and the title. After the match, Batista turned heel and attacked him. Mysterio faced Batista at Survivor Series, where he lost by referee stoppage after Batista performed three Batista Bombs on him. Mysterio was defeated by Batista again in a street fight on December 11 episode of SmackDown. A few weeks later Mysterio defeated Batista and was named the number one contender for the World Heavyweight Championship, but his title match against The Undertaker ended in a no contest after Batista interfered. On January 1, 2010, Mysterio participated in a Beat the Clock Tournament for a World Heavyweight Championship at the Royal Rumble. In the tournament, he defeated his former rival Chris Jericho in the quickest time, and prevented Batista from beating it by interfering in his match. This led to a number one contender's match between the duo the following week, which also ended in a no contest following interference from the Undertaker. The following week in a re-match, Mysterio defeated Batista in a Steel Cage match, but failed to win the championship at the Royal Rumble.|$|E

On the March 2 episode of Raw, Kane pinned Mike Knox in a triple threat match, also involving Rey Mysterio, {{to earn a}} spot in the Money in the Bank ladder match at WrestleMania XXV, a match ultimately won by CM Punk. During the 2009 draft Kane beat The Brian Kendrick for a draft pick and, later in the night, was drafted back to SmackDown. There, Kane feuded with CM Punk and defeated him to cap it off at Backlash. He then took a break to tour India and also heal injuries, returning at The Bash to assist Dolph Ziggler in his match with The Great Khali by hitting Khali with a steel chair, allowing Ziggler to win. This started a feud with Khali, whom he defeated at SummerSlam and in a Singapore Cane match at Breaking Point. Alongside Chris Jericho, Kane was co-captain for the victorious Team SmackDown at <b>Bragging</b> <b>Rights.</b> Kane then unsuccessfully challenged Jericho in a number one contender's match for an opportunity to face World Heavyweight Champion The Undertaker and Big Show in a triple threat match at Survivor Series. In November, Kane reunited with The Undertaker to feud with Big Show and Jericho, thus becoming a face.|$|E
