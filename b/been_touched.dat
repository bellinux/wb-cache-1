5|$|Charles' {{choices were}} appropriate. Philip was {{culturally}} Spanish: {{he was born}} in Valladolid and raised in the Spanish court, his native tongue was Spanish, and he preferred to live in Spain. Ferdinand was familiar with, and to, the other princes of the Holy Roman Empire. Although he too had been born in Spain, he had administered his brother's affairs in the Empire since 1531. Some historians maintain Ferdinand had also <b>been</b> <b>touched</b> by the reformed philosophies, and was probably the closest the Holy Roman Empire ever came to a Protestant emperor; he remained at least nominally a Catholic throughout his life, although reportedly he refused last rites on his deathbed. Other historians maintain that while Ferdinand was a practicing Catholic, unlike his brother he considered religion to be outside the political sphere.|$|E

40|$|I {{introduce}} a puzzle about contact and de re temporal predication in relativistic spacetime. In particular, I describe an apparent counterexample {{to the following}} principle, roughly stated: if B is never {{in a position to}} say ‘I <b>was</b> <b>touching</b> A, I <b>am</b> <b>touching</b> A, and I will <b>be</b> <b>touching</b> A’, then (time travel aside) A is never in a position to say ‘I <b>was</b> <b>touching</b> B, I <b>am</b> <b>touching</b> B, and I will <b>be</b> <b>touching</b> B’. In the case I present, the most that A is ever in a position to say is: ‘I <b>am</b> now <b>touching</b> B, but this is the only instant at which this will ever be so’. B, on the other hand, can say: ‘I <b>was</b> formerly <b>touching</b> A, I <b>am</b> currently <b>touching</b> A, and I will in the future <b>be</b> <b>touching</b> A’.

Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chrétien {{said in a}} statement: All Canadians have <b>been</b> <b>touched</b> by the untimely death of Sandra Schmirler. Most of us came to know her through her exploits as a champion curler and as an exemplary sports ambassador for Canada. But what really set her apart was her bright, engaging personality and her incredible zest for life, qualities that were so clearly in evidence as she fought so valiantly against her illness. She will be sorely missed. In honour of Schmirler, flags at provincial office buildings in Saskatchewan were lowered to half-staff.|$|E
5|$|Octopus {{card reader}} {{includes}} a fail-safe that prevents reader from initiating transaction {{when more than}} one card is being detected at the same time. On 11 February 2009, Sing Tao Daily reported that the fail-safe has been abused for fare evasion through the railway station turnstile. A large amount of dishonest passengers at Sheung Shui Station and Lo Wu Station were stacking up 4 or more cards before breaking through the turnstile, pretending their cards have <b>been</b> <b>touched</b> with the reader correctly but triggering the fail-safe deliberately to avoid card value deduction. Because of this, if they get caught by the station staff, they can make an excuse of a hardware malfunction and offer the Octopus card with an unsuccessful transaction.|$|E
5|$|On a kickoff, {{the ball}} is placed at the 35-yard line of the kicking team in {{professional}} and college play and at the 40-yard line in high school play. The ball may be drop-kicked or place-kicked. If a place kick is chosen, the ball can {{be placed on the}} ground or on a tee, and a holder may be used in either case. On a safety kick, the kicking team kicks the ball from their own 20-yard line. They can punt, drop-kick or place-kick the ball, but a tee may not be used in professional play. Any member of the receiving team may catch or advance the ball, and the ball may be recovered by the kicking team once it has gone at least ten yards and has touched the ground or has <b>been</b> <b>touched</b> by any member of the receiving team.|$|E

40|$|In our research, {{we aim to}} {{construct}} the visual-haptic system which generate haptic feedback as if they <b>were</b> <b>touching</b> {{on the surface of}} various virtual objects, even though they <b>are</b> <b>touching</b> only a static shape. We focus on the cross modal effect between our vision and haptic sense, which is generally called Pseudo-Haptics, and make up a illusionary haptics only using visual feedback, without any complicated physical devices. In our system, user touches the physical object behind the LCD, and sees the virtual object through the LCD using video see-through methodology. We put two web cameras to provide the different image for each eye and maintain the optical conjugation between viewpoint and cameras using the mirror {{in the back of the}} LCD. From images captured by these cameras, we compose visual feedback as if they <b>were</b> <b>touching</b> another virtual shape, based on the detection of the point where they <b>are</b> <b>touching</b> the physical object. This makes up a haptic illusion as if they <b>were</b> <b>touching</b> the virtual shape. By our proposed system, users perceive visual and haptic sensation as if they <b>were</b> <b>touching</b> various virtual shapes, without any complicated physical devices...|$|R

25|$|On any kicking play, all onside players (the kicker, and {{teammates}} behind the kicker {{at the time}} of the kick) may recover and advance the ball.

25|$|Defending {{indirect}} free-kicks provides different {{difficulties for}} the defending team. The wall {{must be prepared}} to charge down the ball once it has <b>been</b> <b>touched</b> by the free-kick taker, and other defenders must be alert to the attacking team's practised set-plays. Getting the ball over the wall and then to dip into the bottom corner is a superb skill. Xherdan Shaqiri approaches the ball from a 90 degrees angle which is very effective.|$|E

The Russian elite turned away from God after seeing {{the destruction of the}} Fall, and turned to worshiping Chernobog instead.|$|E
25|$|According to kashrut, {{meat and}} poultry may not be {{combined}} with dairy products, nor may they touch plates or utensils that have <b>been</b> <b>touched</b> by dairy products. Therefore, Jews who strictly observe kashrut divide their kitchens into different sections for meat and for dairy, with separate ovens, plates, and utensils (or as much as is reasonable, given financial and space constraints; there are procedures to kasher utensils that have touched dairy to allow their use for meat).|$|E

25|$|Fabius' {{constant}} {{harassment of}} Hannibal's force handicapped the latter's command abilities and gained many prisoners.

Although the Carthaginians returned to the Romans several hundred more prisoners than they received and were thus expecting monetary compensation, the Senate was reluctant to pay. However, the estates of Fabius had not <b>been</b> <b>touched</b> by the Carthaginian pillage parties in order to incite distrust against him. Fabius now sold these estates to pay the enemy army for the received surplus of prisoners.|$|E
25|$|They {{looked at}} the case as a murder, with the {{burglary}} staged to throw the police off the trail. Many aspects of the crime were improbable for a break-in, especially one committed in daylight: Rasmussen's jewelry box, an inviting target for a burglar, was in plain view atop her dresser and had not <b>been</b> <b>touched.</b> The condo {{was in the middle}} of a gated complex, surrounded by other units from which burglars could have expected to be easily observed. The front door had an alarm warning, and had not been forced open, as it might have been if the putative burglars had not expected anyone to be at home.|$|E
25|$|When {{the referee}} is {{satisfied}} that the players are properly positioned, he/she blows the whistle {{to indicate that the}} kicker may kick. The kicker may make feinting (deceptive or distracting) moves during the run-up to the ball, but once the run-up is completed he/she may no longer feint and must kick the ball. The ball must be stationary before the kick, and it must be kicked forward. The ball is in play once it is kicked and moves, and at that time other players may enter the penalty area. Once kicked, the kicker may not touch the ball again until it has <b>been</b> <b>touched</b> by another player of either team or goes out of play (including into the goal).|$|E

Nevertheless, if {{the ends of}} the nails or hairs <b>are</b> <b>touched,</b> ever so lightly, we feel that they <b>are</b> <b>touched,</b> and the sensation seems to be situated in the nails or hairs. Nay more, if a walking-stick a yard long is held firmly by the handle and the other end <b>is</b> <b>touched,</b> the tactile sensation, which is a state of our own consciousness, is unhesitatingly referred {{to the end of the}} stick; and yet no one will say that it is there.|$|R
25|$|Another survey {{conducted}} in 2006 by researchers from Australia's Monash University {{sought to determine}} what types of phenomena that people claim to have experienced and the effects these experiences have had on their lives. The study was conducted as an online survey with over 2,000 respondents {{from around the world}} participating. The results revealed that around 70% of the respondents believe to have had an unexplained paranormal event that changed their life, mostly in a positive way. About 70% also claimed to have seen, heard, or <b>been</b> <b>touched</b> by an animal or person that they knew was not there; 80% have reported having a premonition, and almost 50% stated they recalled a previous life.|$|E
25|$|Hodges {{reports a}} strict touch rule for chu shogi. Once a piece has <b>been</b> <b>touched,</b> then that piece must be moved. Furthermore, if {{the piece is}} also moved to a square, it must remain on that square without exception. (That is, the piece cannot be moved to a {{different}} square, even if one's hand does not leave the piece.) Thus, chu shogi's touch rule is more severe than the western chess touch-move rule used in tournament play. Under {{the rules of the}} Japanese Chu Shogi Association, if a piece is touched but it cannot move, there is no penalty for the first two times, but the opponent can declare a foul on the third time and result in forfeiture of the game.|$|E

After parching and crushing the little sheaf of ears and purifying the barley for grinding, they bring to the altar an assaron for God, and, having flung a handful thereof on the altar, they leave the rest {{for the use of the}} priests. Thereafter all are permitted, publicly or individually, to begin harvest. Since the destruction of the Temple, this offering is brought in word rather than deed.|$|E
