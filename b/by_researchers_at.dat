5|$|A study <b>by</b> <b>researchers</b> <b>at</b> the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) {{found that}} growing sweet sorghum instead of grain sorghum could {{increase}} farmers incomes by US$40 per hectare per crop {{because it can}} provide food, feed and fuel. With grain sorghum currently grown on over 11 million hectares (ha) in Asia and on 23.4 million ha in Africa, a switch to sweet sorghum could have a considerable economic impact.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, at {{the request}} of {{investigator}} Joe Nickell, University of Kentucky professor of English Jean G. Pival studied the vocabulary, syntax, and other stylistic characteristics of the letter and concluded that it more closely resembled Lincoln's style of writing than Hay's. A computer analysis method used in a 2017 study <b>by</b> <b>researchers</b> <b>at</b> Aston University's Centre for Forensic Linguistics identified Hay as the letter's author nearly 90% of the time.|$|E

5|$|On June 9, 2011, it was {{announced}} that Johnson and Perry, who died within months of each other, would have their brains examined <b>by</b> <b>researchers</b> <b>at</b> Boston University who are studying head injuries in sports. Both men were suspected of suffering from chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a disorder linked to repeated brain trauma.|$|E
5|$|The 2001 study <b>by</b> <b>researchers</b> <b>at</b> the Scripps Institution of Oceanography {{concluded}} that the imbalance between global dimming and global warming at the surface leads to weaker turbulent heat fluxes to the atmosphere. This means globally reduced evaporation and hence precipitation occur in a dimmer and warmer world, which could ultimately {{lead to a more}} humid atmosphere in which it rains less.|$|E
5|$|An {{additional}} 4.6 billion tonnes {{of uranium}} {{are estimated to}} be in sea water (Japanese scientists in the 1980s showed that extraction of uranium from sea water using ion exchangers was technically feasible). There have been experiments to extract uranium from sea water, but the yield has been low due to the carbonate present in the water. In 2012, ORNL researchers announced the successful development of a new absorbent material dubbed HiCap which performs surface retention of solid or gas molecules, atoms or ions and also effectively removes toxic metals from water, according to results verified <b>by</b> <b>researchers</b> <b>at</b> Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.|$|E

5000|$|The terms [...] "arthrokinetic reflex" [...] {{was coined}} <b>by</b> medical <b>researchers</b> <b>at</b> the University of Pittsburgh's Medical School, {{department}} of Physiology, in 1956 {{to refer to}} the way in which joint movement can reflexively cause muscle activation or inhibition.|$|R
5|$|In 2016 a {{breakthrough}} in creating a strong light aluminium steel alloy which might be suitable in applications such as aircraft was announced <b>by</b> <b>researchers</b> <b>at</b> Pohang University of Science and Technology. Adding small amounts of nickel was found to result in precipitation as nano particles of brittle B2 intermetallic compounds which had previously resulted in weakness. The result was a cheap strong light steel alloy—nearly as strong as titanium at 10% of the cost—which is slated for trial production at industrial scale by POSCO, a Korean steelmaker.|$|E
5|$|In a paper {{published}} in Nature in January 2013, {{scientists from the}} European Bioinformatics Institute and Agilent Technologies proposed a mechanism to use DNA's ability to code information {{as a means of}} digital data storage. The group was able to encode 739 kilobytes of data into DNA code, synthesize the actual DNA, then sequence the DNA and decode the information back to its original form, with a reported 100% accuracy. The encoded information consisted of text files and audio files. A prior experiment was {{published in}} August 2012. It was conducted <b>by</b> <b>researchers</b> <b>at</b> Harvard University, where the text of a 54,000-word book was encoded in DNA.|$|E
5|$|The oxazolidinones {{have been}} known as monoamine oxidase inhibitors since the late 1950s. Their {{antimicrobial}} properties were discovered <b>by</b> <b>researchers</b> <b>at</b> E.I. duPont de Nemours in the 1970s. In 1978, DuPont patented a series of oxazolidinone derivatives as being effective {{in the treatment of}} bacterial and fungal plant diseases, and in 1984, another patent described their usefulness in treating bacterial infections in mammals. In 1987, DuPont scientists presented {{a detailed description of the}} oxazolidinones as a new class of antibiotics with a novel mechanism of action. Early compounds were found to produce liver toxicity, however, and development was discontinued.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "BLEVE" [...] {{was coined}} <b>by</b> three <b>researchers</b> <b>at</b> Factory Mutual, in the {{analysis}} of an accident there in 1957 involving a chemical reactor vessel. Anthony Santos was one of the Chemical Engineers working at FM who coined the term.|$|R
25|$|Captopril was {{developed}} in 1975 <b>by</b> three <b>researchers</b> <b>at</b> the U.S. drug company Squibb (now Bristol-Myers Squibb): Miguel Ondetti, Bernard Rubin, and David Cushman.

5|$|In {{addition}} to immediate health effects, some injuries sustained during a player's career can have effects that extend to their post-career life. A cohort mortality study <b>by</b> <b>researchers</b> <b>at</b> the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) examined 3,349 NFL players {{who played at}} least five full seasons from 1959 to 1988. The {{findings from this study}} suggest that, in comparison to the typical American male, NFL players live longer on average but have around three times the risk of death associated with neurodegenerative disorders. In particular, the risk of death from Alzheimer's disease and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) was roughly four times higher among former players than the average American male. The study also compared mortality risks from speed players (quarterbacks, running backs, fullbacks, wide receivers, tight ends, linebackers, cornerbacks, and safeties) and nonspeed players (offensive and defensive linemen), with findings indicating that a greater number of deaths were attributable to neurodegenerative disorders in speed players than nonspeed players. This {{may be due to the}} increased momentum of collisions from speed players.|$|E

25|$|Bacon is {{considered}} by many doctors to be unhealthy if eaten in excess. A study conducted <b>by</b> <b>researchers</b> <b>at</b> the University of Zurich found a connection between eating processed meat and the risk of dying from heart disease or cancer. Processed meats contain preservatives known as nitrates that, when absorbed by the human body, convert into nitrosamine, a chemical compound that could cause cancer. A second study <b>by</b> <b>researchers</b> <b>at</b> Columbia University found that the consumption of cured meats increase a person's chances of developing chronic pulmonary disease.|$|E
