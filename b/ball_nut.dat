40|$|AbstractThe {{ball screw}} {{frequently}} {{used to drive}} or translate the parts on the precision machine, such as machine tool and motorized stage. Therefore they were most frequently used on the precision machine, semiconductor equipment, medical instrument and aero industry. The main parts of ball screw are screw, <b>ball</b> and <b>nut.</b> The contact angle between the screw, <b>ball</b> and <b>nut</b> will affect the performance (include loading and noise) and lifecycle of a ball screw. If the actual contact angle and the designed contact angle are not the same, the friction between the <b>ball,</b> screw and <b>nut</b> will increase and it {{will result in the}} thermal increase and lifecycle decrease. This paper combines the traditional profile projector and commercial digital camera to build an imaging based and noncontact measurements system. It can implement the contact angle measurement quickly and accurately. Three different pitch angles of ball screws were completed tests in this paper. The angle resolution of this measurement system is about 0. 001 degree and its accuracy is about 0. 05 degree...|$|R

50|$|Depending {{upon their}} lead angle, ball screws can be back-driven {{due to their}} low {{internal}} friction (i.e., the screw shaft can be driven linearly to rotate the <b>ball</b> <b>nut).</b> They are usually undesirable for hand-fed machine tools, as the stiffness of a servo motor is required to keep the cutter from grabbing the work and self-feeding, that is, where the cutter and workpiece exceed the optimum feedrate and effectively jam or crash together, ruining the cutter and workpiece. Cost is also a major factor as Acme screws are cheaper to manufacture.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, the {{development}} of a methodology for reducing the energy demand and increasing the life time of ball screws by minimizing the friction torque with adaptive lubrication of the <b>ball</b> screw <b>nut</b> is presented. Therefore, a simulation model of the feed axis has been developed and fitted metrologically at an especially designed test stand with an adaptive lubrication system for the <b>ball</b> screw <b>nut.</b> The model allows the calculation of the optimum friction torque of the feed axis and thus determines the need for lubricants in case a deviation to the measured friction torque of the feed axis should arise. The comparison of tests dealing with the life time of ball screws with standard lubrication and new adaptive lubrication aims at proving the increase of the life time. This endeavor will result in characteristic lubrication strategies for a resource-efficient operation of ball screws during constant operating conditions...|$|R
50|$|Most {{electro-mechanical}} designs {{incorporate a}} lead screw and lead nut. Some use a ball screw and <b>ball</b> <b>nut.</b> In either case the screw may be connected to a motor or manual control knob either directly or {{through a series of}} gears. Gears are typically used to allow a smaller (and weaker) motor spinning at a higher rpm to be geared down to provide the torque necessary to spin the screw under a heavier load than the motor would otherwise be capable of driving directly. Effectively this sacrifices actuator speed in favor of increased actuator thrust. In some applications the use of worm gear is common as this allow a smaller built in dimension still allowing great travel length.|$|E
5000|$|To remove {{backlash}} {{and obtain}} the optimum stiffness and wear characteristics {{for a given}} application, a controlled amount of preload is usually applied. This is accomplished in some cases by machining the components such that the balls are a [...] "tight" [...] fit when assembled, however this gives poor control of the preload, {{and can not be}} adjusted to allow for wear. It is more common to design the <b>ball</b> <b>nut</b> as effectively two separate nuts which are tightly coupled mechanically, with adjustment by either rotation one nut with respect to the other, so creating a relative axial displacement, or by retaining both nuts tightly together axially and rotating one with respect to the other, so that its set of balls is displaced axially to create the preload.|$|E
50|$|Typically, an {{electric}} motor is mechanically connected to rotate a lead screw. A lead screw has a continuous helical thread machined on its circumference running along the length (similar to the thread on a bolt). Threaded onto the lead screw is a lead nut or <b>ball</b> <b>nut</b> with corresponding helical threads. The nut is prevented from rotating with the lead screw (typically the nut interlocks with a non-rotating part of the actuator body). Therefore, when the lead screw is rotated, the nut will be driven along the threads. The direction of motion of the nut depends on the direction of rotation of the lead screw. By connecting linkages to the nut, the motion {{can be converted to}} usable linear displacement. Most current actuators are built for high speed, high force, or a compromise between the two. When considering an actuator for a particular application, the most important specifications are typically travel, speed, force, accuracy, and lifetime. Most varieties are mounted on dampers or butterfly valves.|$|E

40|$|This Master of Science thesis {{depicts the}} {{mechanical}} design and physical implementa-tion of double H’-gantry manipulator called DOHMAN. The H’-gantry mechanism is belt driven, two dimensional positioning device {{in which the}} belt is arranged in capital “H” form, and enables one linear and one rotary movement. The Ball-Screw Spline, in addition, is mechanism that consists of <b>Ball</b> Screw <b>Nut,</b> <b>Ball</b> Spline <b>Nut,</b> and Lead Screw with screw and spline grooves that fit both nuts. This mechanism enables linear and rotary displacement along the same axis. The DOHMAN robot is made of two par-allel kinematic H’-gantry structures linked with a miniature Ball Screw-Spline mecha-nism. The resulting structure is capable of performing four degrees-of-freedom (DOF) displacements along the three Cartesian axes X, Y and Z {{as well as a}} rotation W around the Z axis. The size and the other geometries of the DOHMAN robot aim to fit into the microfactory concept (TUT-μF) developed at Tampere University of Technology. For position control and visual servoing of the robot, an additional module was de-signed and implemented. Custom design of mechanical parts along with the selection of off-the-shelf components was done for building the robot prototype. The chapters and the appendix of this thesis thoroughly explain the design decisions and the implementa-tion. During the design development a new innovative homing strategy for linear Z and angular W axes was suggested and later implemented. This innovative homing provides efficient use of space for mounting the limit switches, avoiding huge loss in the overall Z-axis movement, and significantly reduces the cabling issues in the moving structure. Besides the innovative homing, other advantages of DOHMAN are distributed actuation and homogeneous workspace. The distributed actuation decreases the overall mass of the moving structure and also reduces the cabling within the overall mechanical system. The consistency in the workspace eases the control of the robot because there are no regions to avoid while moving the end effector...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Ballscrew drive {{mechanisms}} {{are widely used}} in the transmitting system of precision machine tools. The profile of the <b>ball</b> <b>nut</b> is a gothic curve combined by two equal radius arcs with offset centers. Most of gothic arc ball nuts are manufactured by form grinding, where the grinding wheel is shaped into the desired profile and the tool axis is tilted at the lead angle of the <b>ball</b> <b>nut</b> thread. In case of the internal <b>ball</b> <b>nut</b> grinding the high lead angle and long thread limits the manufacturing process. To avoid the collision between the internal surface of the workpiece and outer surface of the quill the optimal tilt angle is modified. The modified tilt angle affects to {{the profile of the}} formed grinding wheel. This paper presents a method for the generation of modified grinding wheel profile independently of the tilt angle.

The constant weight of the load applied to the lead screw via the <b>ball</b> <b>nut</b> tend to cause the lead screw to rotate, the constant torque of which is opposed by the constant torque produced by the motor when fed from the constant current source.

5000|$|Older designs use {{two main}} principles: the worm and sector {{design and the}} screw and nut.

The recirculating ball version of this apparatus reduces the considerable friction by placing large ball bearings between the screw and the nut; {{at either end of the}} apparatus the balls exit from between the two pieces into a channel internal to the box which connects them with the other end of the apparatus, thus they are [...] "recirculated".|$|R
40|$|The thermal {{condition}} of machine tools can profoundly affect the dimensional accuracy of manufactured parts. Consequently, reducing its influence {{has become increasingly}} important to modern manufacturing. One of the most convenient and effective ways to reduce thermal error and enhance working accuracy is volumetric error compensation, especially for CNC machine tools. However, currently available compensation methods are highly complicated and difficult to apply in industry.
