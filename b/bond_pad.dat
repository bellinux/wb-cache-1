The leads of the package extend diagonally inside the package from their positions of emergence along the periphery to points along a rectangular perimeter surrounding the die, tapering as they go to become fine contacts at the die. Ultra-fine bond wires (barely visible to the naked human eye) are welded between these die periphery contacts and bond pads on the die itself, connecting one lead to each <b>bond</b> <b>pad,</b> and making the final connection between the microcircuits and the external DIP leads. The bond wires are not usually taut but loop upward slightly to allow slack for thermal expansion and contraction of the materials; if a single bond wire breaks or detaches, the entire IC may become useless. The top of the package covers all of this delicate assemblage without crushing the bond wires, protecting it from contamination by foreign materials.|$|E

40|$|The thermo-structural {{analysis}} of ultrasonic wire bonding is performed {{by means of}} 3 D finite element method. A special,focus {{has been placed on}} monitoring the temperature rise during ultrasonic vibration. An equivalent method is used to simulate the wire and <b>bond</b> <b>pad,</b> where the large volumes of wire and <b>bond</b> <b>pad</b> are effectively reduced to small computational magnitudes. The history of temperature changes in the wire-bond pad-substrate interfaces influenced by varying bond forces and <b>bond</b> <b>pad</b> sizes is specifically studied. It is shown that the maximum bulk temperature obtained upon completion of ultrasonic vibration is far lower than the melting temperatures of the wire and <b>bond</b> <b>pad</b> materials, indicating that the bulk temperature rise due to ultrasonic vibration is not directly responsible for ultrasonic wire bonding. A large <b>bond</b> <b>pad</b> size usually leads to a lower temperature rise, and when the pad size reaches a certain value, the effect of <b>bond</b> <b>pad</b> size on temperature rise becomes insignificant. A higher bond force results in a marginally higher temperature rise than a lower bond force, which does not necessarily affect the wire bondability. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Cu {{wire bonding}} {{research}} has exploded exponentially {{in the past}} few years. Many studies have been carried out to understand the different behaviours of Cu wire and Au wire. One of the observations on Cu wire bonding is the excessive formation of aluminium (Al) splash on the <b>bond</b> <b>pad</b> due to a higher bond force. This leads to pad peeling and bond failure resulting in poor reliability performance of Cu and PdCu wire semiconductor devices. It is known that the Al splash is influenced by the front-end pad metal process and back-end wire bond process.

40|$|Abstract—During {{manufacture}} of wire bonding in packaged IC products, {{the breaking of}} bond wires and the peeling of bond pads occur frequently. The result is open-circuit failure in IC products. There were several prior methods reported {{to overcome these problems}} by using additional process flows or special materials. In this paper, a layout method is proposed to improve the bond wire reliability in general CMOS processes. By changing the layout patterns of bond pads, the reliability of bond wires on bond pads can be improved. A set of different layout patterns of bond pads has been drawn and fabricated in a 0. 6 - m single-poly triple-metal CMOS process for investigation by the bond wire reliability tests, the ball shear test and the wire pull test. By im-plementing effective layout patterns on bond pads in packaged IC products, not only the bond wire reliability can be improved, but also the <b>bond</b> <b>pad</b> capacitance can be reduced for high frequency application.
