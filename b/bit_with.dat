25|$|A {{step drill}} bit is a drill bit {{that has the}} tip ground down to a {{different}} diameter. The transition between this ground diameter and the original diameter is either straight, to form a counterbore, or angled, to form a countersink. The advantage to this style is that both diameters have the same flute characteristics, which keeps the bit from clogging when drilling in softer materials, such as aluminum; in contrast, a drill <b>bit</b> <b>with</b> a slip-on collar {{does not have the}} same benefit. Most of these bits are custom-made for each application, which makes them more expensive.|$|E

Both conditions can cause binding, wear, and eventual catastrophic failure of the tool. The proper amount of lip clearance is determined by the point angle. A very acute point angle has more web surface area presented to the work at any one time, requiring an aggressive lip angle, where a flat bit is extremely sensitive to small changes in lip angle due to the small surface area supporting the cutting edges.|$|E

25|$|An {{adjustable}} wood bit, {{also known}} as an expansive wood bit, has a small center pilot <b>bit</b> <b>with</b> an adjustable, sliding cutting edge mounted above it, usually containing a single sharp point at the outside, with a set screw to lock the cutter in position. When the cutting edge is centered on the bit, the hole drilled will be small, and when the cutting edge is slid outwards, a larger hole is drilled. This allows a single drill bit to drill {{a wide variety of}} holes, and can take the place of a large, heavy set of different size bits, as well as providing uncommon bit sizes. A ruler or vernier scale is usually provided to allow precise adjustment of the bit size.|$|E
