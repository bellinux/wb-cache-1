25|$|Scuba demand valves {{which are}} set to breathe lightly (low {{cracking}} pressure, and low work of breathing) may tend to free-flow relatively easily, particularly if the gas flow in the housing {{has been designed to}} assist in holding the valve open by reducing the internal pressure. The cracking pressure of a sensitive demand valve is often less than the hydrostatic pressure difference between the inside of an air-filled housing and the water below the diaphragm when the mouthpiece is pointed upwards. To avoid excessive loss of gas due to inadvertent activation of the valve when the DV is out of the diver's mouth, some second stages have a desensitising mechanism which causes some <b>back-pressure</b> in the housing, by impeding the flow or directing it against the inside of the diaphragm.|$|E

The test apparatus is designed to support multiple measurement techniques for investigating the flow field in a scramjet isolator model. The test section is 1 -inch high by 2 -inch wide by 24 -inch long and simulates a scramjet isolator with an aspect ratio of two. Unheated, dry air at a constant stagnation pressure and temperature is delivered to the isolator test section through a Mach 2. 5 planar nozzle. The isolator test section is mechanically <b>back-pressured</b> to contain the resulting shock train within the 24 -inch isolator length and supports temperature, static pressure, and high frequency pressure measurements at the wall. Additionally, nonintrusive methods including laser-induced thermal acoustics (LITA), spontaneous Raman scattering, particle image velocimetry, and schlieren imaging are being incorporated to measure off-wall fluid dynamic, thermodynamic, and transport properties of the flow field. Interchangeable glass and metallic sidewalls and optical access appendages permit making multiple measurements simultaneously. The measurements {{will be used to}} calibrate computational fluid dynamics turbulence models and characterize the <b>back-pressured</b> flow of a scramjet isolator.

25|$|A {{free flow}} helmet {{supplies}} a continuous flow of {{air to the}} diver, and he breathes this as it flows past. Work of breathing is minimal, but flow rate must be high if the diver works hard, and this is noisy, affecting communications and requiring hearing protection to avoid damage to the ears. This type of helmet is popular where divers {{have to work hard}} in relatively shallow water for long periods. It is also useful when diving in contaminated environments, where the helmet is sealed onto a dry suit, and the entire system is kept at a slight positive pressure by adjusting the <b>back-pressure</b> of the exhaust valve, to ensure that there is no leakage into the helmet. This type of helmet is often large in volume, and as it is attached to the suit, it does not move with the head. The diver must move his body to face anything he wants to see. For this reason the faceplate is large and there is often an upper window or side windows to improve the field of vision.|$|E

30|$|In [20], {{the authors}} {{proposed}} a probe-based call admission control scheme (ProbeCast) with QoS guarantees for inelastic flows (i.e., flows that cannot be dynamically adjusted to traffic and load condition). In ProbeCast, a path is probed for capacity availability.

To achieve this, the probing scheme {{is associated with a}} distributed fairness scheme, Neighborhood Proportional Drop, which enforces uniform drop probabilities among flows competing in the same contention domain. Each node estimates own packet drop probability and propagates this information by piggybacking to neighbors. The received flow has, by design, a lower drop probability threshold than the serving flows. If during probing, the new flow drop rate increases beyond a certain threshold, the flow is <b>back-pressured</b> {{on the way to the}} source node and the flow is re-routed. If backpressure pushes the flow back to the source and all alternate paths are exhausted, the received flow is rejected.

In typical flutter testing blade mounted sensors in the form of strain gages and casing mounted sensors in the form of light probes (NSMS) are used. Casing mounted sensors have the advantage of being non-intrusive and can detect the vibratory response of each rotating blade. Other types of casing mounted sensors can also be used to detect flutter of rotating blades. In this investigation casing mounted high frequency response pressure transducers are used to characterize the part-speed stall flutter response of a single stage unshrouded axial-flow fan.

The monolith with the highest total pore volume (4 cm(3) /g) and flow through channels 20 - 30 mu m in size, was further functionalized with trypsin to obtain multichannel immobilized enzyme (proteolytic) reactor (IMER). The value of permeability coefficient K evaluated for water (similar to 2. 0. 10 (- 11)) {{was found to be}} two orders of magnitude higher in the novel reactor than reported before for high-performance IMERs, enabling the flow rates of 750 mL/cm(2) min at pressure gradients of 64 kPa/cm. Very high practical potentials of the novel microbioreactor were demonstrated in the proteolysis of cytochrome c (Cyt-c) and myoglobin (Myo), without any earlier pretreatment. MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry analysis of sequence coverage was high: 70 % (Cyt-c) and 90 % (Myo) for 24 min digestion, and 39 % (Cyt-c) and 53 % (Myo) when the proteolysis time was reduced to 2. 4 min.

We present results of a laboratory study designed to assess the significance of the phase offset between slope-normal and slope-parallel cyclic stresses on the generation of coseismic landslide displacements. Using a dynamic <b>back-pressured</b> shearbox that is capable of simulating variably-phased slope-normal and slope-parallel dynamic loads, we subjected sediment samples to a range of dynamic loading scenarios indicative of earthquake-induced ground shaking. We detail the variations in strain accumulation observed when slope-normal and slope-parallel stresses occur independently and simultaneously, {{both in and out of}} phase, using a range of dynamic stress amplitudes. Our results show that the instantaneous phasing of dynamic stresses is critical in determining the amount of coseismic landslide displacement, which may vary by up to an order of magnitude based solely on wave phasing effects. Instantaneous strain rate is an exponential function of the distance normal to the Mohr Coulomb failure envelope in plots of shear stress against normal effective stress. This distance is strongly controlled by the phase offset between dynamic normal and shear stresses. Our results demonstrate that conditions considered by conventional coseismic slope stability models can either over- or under-estimate earthquake-induced landslide displacement by up to an order of magnitude.

In this study we present the first detailed examination and modelling of landslide mechanisms in these materials. We found that pelitic schist commonly contains black, graphite-rich layers {{on a scale of}} millimeters to centimeters thickness that are typically weaker than neighboring layers. By examining microscopic textures in borehole samples obtained from landslide masses of pelitic schist, we find that ductile gravitational shearing commonly occurs within these weaker layers, accompanied by brittle fracture in the surrounding layers. To investigate this mechanisms, we have performed high-precision direct shear tests, using a novel <b>back-pressured</b> shearbox, on artificial rock samples both with and without graphite layers placed between pre-cut shear surfaces. The tests used normal stresses up to 800 kPa (equivalent to 32 m depth of burial). We found that the coefficients of friction for samples with graphite layers embedded in the artificial rock samples (0. 30, representing an angle of internal friction of 16. 7 °) were much lower than those without graphite layers on the pre-cut surface (0. 85). The shear strength of the artificial rocks with embedded layers of graphite decreased abruptly with increasing areal extent of the graphite layer along the shear surface, from which it can be inferred that the continuity of a graphite layer in natural pelitic schist has a considerable effect on shear resistance. These results suggest that even comparatively low dip angles of schistosity in pelitic schist could initiate microscopic slip along the graphite-rich layers...|$|R
