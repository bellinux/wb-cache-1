5|$|For {{the first}} years of the war, a degree of tension existed between the {{government}} and the army, which divided its allegiance <b>between</b> <b>government</b> <b>and</b> King. The Free Belgian forces, particular the infantry who had been training since 1940, held the government responsible for not being allowed to fight. In November 1942, 12 Belgian soldiers mutinied, complaining about their inactivity. By 1943, the army's royalist stance had been moderated, allowing the government to re-gain the support of the military.|$|E
5|$|The {{alleviation}} {{of widespread}} unemployment and hunger in Poplar {{had to be}} funded from money raised by the borough itself under the Poor Law. The poverty of the borough made this patently unfair and lead to the 1921 conflict <b>between</b> <b>government</b> <b>and</b> the local councillors known as the Poplar Rates Rebellion. Council meetings were for a time held in Brixton prison, and the councillors received wide support. Ultimately, {{this led to the}} abolition of the Poor Laws through the Local Government Act 1929.|$|E
5|$|In {{many parts}} of the world {{football}} evokes great passions and plays an important role in the life of individual fans, local communities, and even nations. R. Kapuscinski says that Europeans who are polite, modest, or humble fall easily into rage when playing or watching football games. The Côte d'Ivoire national football team helped secure a truce to the nation's civil war in 2006 and it helped further reduce tensions <b>between</b> <b>government</b> <b>and</b> rebel forces in 2007 by playing a match in the rebel capital of Bouaké, an occasion that brought both armies together peacefully for the first time. By contrast, football is widely considered to have been the final proximate cause for the Football War in June 1969 between El Salvador and Honduras. The sport also exacerbated tensions at the beginning of the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s, when a match between Dinamo Zagreb and Red Star Belgrade degenerated into rioting in May 1990.|$|E

5|$|Husayn, however, who {{had been}} {{entrusted}} with the fortress of Ardumusht on the left bank of the Tigris, chose to surrender it instead, and offered his services to the Caliph. He managed to capture the Kharijite leader Harun al-Shari, thereby bringing {{an end to the}} Kharijite revolt in the Jazira. In exchange he secured not only a pardon for his father, but also the lifting of a tribute that the Taghlib had been forced to pay, and the right to form a regiment of 500 Taghlibi cavalry at government expense. This was a major success, laying the groundwork for his own and his family's ascent to power. In the words of the Islamic scholar Hugh N. Kennedy, to the caliph he offered a group of experienced warriors under his own skilled and loyal leadership; to the Taghlib, and other people in the Jazira, he offered the prospect of salaries and booty; and to his own family military command and the opportunity of acquiring wealth in government services. It was in fact not as an independent tribal leader, but rather as an intermediary <b>between</b> <b>government</b> <b>and</b> the Arabs and Kurds of the Jazira that al-Husayn made the family fortune.|$|E

This Reconstructive Left would look beyond debates on the appropriate size of government, and instead re-envision the relationship <b>between</b> <b>government</b> <b>and</b> firms in the market economy by experimenting with the coexistence of different regimes of private and social property.|$|E

Their bid to secure seats in other constituencies also failed. Tien resigned as the Liberal Party's chairman after his defeat, and Chow resigned both her vice-chairmanship and her seat on the Executive Council of Hong Kong.

40|$|The causal {{relationship}} <b>between</b> <b>government</b> revenue <b>and</b> <b>government</b> expenditure {{is an important}} subject in public economics especially to the control of budget deficit. The {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate the relationship <b>between</b> <b>government</b> revenue <b>and</b> <b>government</b> expenditure in Iran by applying the bounds testing approach to cointegration. The results of the causality test show that there is a bidirectional {{causal relationship}} <b>between</b> <b>government</b> expenditure <b>and</b> revenues in both long run and short run. Therefore, the results of this paper are consistent with fiscal synchronization hypothesis. The policy implication of results suggests that because of existing interdependence relation <b>between</b> <b>government</b> expenditure <b>and</b> revenue, the <b>government</b> makes its expenditures and revenues decision simultaneously. Under this hypothesis, the fiscal authorities of Iran should try to increase revenues and decrease expenditure simultaneously to control the budget deficits...|$|R
