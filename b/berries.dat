5|$|All juniper species grow <b>berries,</b> {{but some}} are {{considered}} too bitter to eat. In addition to J. communis, other edible species include Juniperus drupacea, Juniperus phoenicea, Juniperus deppeana, and Juniperus californica. But the <b>berries</b> of some species, such as Juniperus sabina, are toxic and consumption of them is inadvisable.|$|E
5|$|Juniperus communis <b>berries</b> {{vary from}} four to twelvemillimeters in diameter; other species are mostly similar in size, though some are larger, notably J. drupacea (20–28mm). Unlike the {{separated}} and woody scales of a typical pine cone, those in a juniper berry remain fleshy and merge into a unified covering surrounding the seeds. The <b>berries</b> are green when young, and mature to a purple-black colour over about 18 months in most species, including J. communis (shorter, 8–10 months in a few species, and about 24 months in J. drupacea). The mature, dark <b>berries</b> are usually but not exclusively used in cuisine, while gin is flavoured with fully grown but immature green <b>berries.</b>|$|E
5|$|While {{classified}} as generally recognized as {{safe in the}} US, juniper <b>berries</b> may have various side effects that have not been tested extensively in clinical trials. Mainly due to an increased risk of miscarriage, even in small doses, consuming juniper <b>berries</b> may affect pregnant or breastfeeding women and people with diabetes, bleeding disorders or after surgery. In traditional medicine, juniper <b>berries</b> were used for female birth control. In an in vitro study, juniper essential oil was studied for its possible antimicrobial and antifungal properties.|$|E

5|$|Gaylussacia brachycera {{is easily}} {{distinguished}} from {{other members of}} its genus by its leaves: they resemble those of boxwood (hence its name) and lack the resin glands typical of huckleberries. Like its relatives, it bears white urn-shaped flowers in the early summer, which develop to blue, edible <b>berries</b> in late summer. It is mostly found in Appalachia; many of its stations there were known to natives, who picked and ate the <b>berries,</b> before botanists became aware {{of them in the}} 1920s.|$|E
5|$|In Russia, {{blackcurrant}} leaves may be {{used for}} flavouring tea or preserves, such as salted cucumbers, and <b>berries</b> for home winemaking.

In Britain, 95% of the blackcurrants grown end up in Ribena (a brand of fruit juice whose name is derived from Ribes nigrum) and similar fruit syrups and juices.|$|E
5|$|The American robin's diet {{generally}} {{consists of}} around 40 percent small invertebrates (mainly insects), such as earthworms, beetle grubs, caterpillars and grasshoppers, and 60 percent wild and cultivated fruits and <b>berries.</b> Their ability {{to switch to}} <b>berries</b> allows them to winter much farther north than most other North American thrushes. They will flock to fermented Pyracantha <b>berries,</b> and after eating sufficient quantities will exhibit intoxicated behavior such as falling over while walking. Robins forage primarily {{on the ground for}} soft-bodied invertebrates, and find worms by sight (and sometimes by hearing), pouncing on them and then pulling them up. Nestlings are fed mainly on worms and other soft-bodied animal prey. In some areas, robins, particularly of the coastal race T. m. caurinus, will feed on beaches, taking insects and small mollusks.|$|E

50|$|What is not clear, {{and what}} is disputed by {{contemporary}} historians, {{is whether or not}} Nancy Hanks is of Shipley ancestry and whether she lived with the <b>Berrys</b> during her childhood. Two key sources of information about Nancy Hanks living with the <b>Berrys</b> as a child are 1) Sarah Mitchell, who lived with the Richard <b>Berry,</b> Sr. and Rachel Shipley <b>Berry</b> after 1785, and 2) Robert Mitchell <b>Berry,</b> son of Richard <b>Berry,</b> Jr., who says that Nancy Hanks lived with Richard <b>Berry,</b> Jr.|$|R
5|$|The common {{blackbird}} is omnivorous, {{eating a}} wide range of insects, earthworms, seeds and <b>berries.</b> It feeds mainly on the ground, running and hopping with a start-stop-start progress. It pulls earthworms from the soil, usually finding them by sight, but sometimes by hearing, and roots through leaf litter for other invertebrates. Small amphibians and lizards are occasionally hunted. This species will also perch in bushes to take <b>berries</b> and collect caterpillars and other active insects. Animal prey predominates, and is particularly important during the breeding season, with windfall apples and <b>berries</b> taken more in the autumn and winter. The nature of the fruit taken depends on what is locally available, and frequently includes exotics in gardens.|$|E

5|$|Waxwings can eat {{huge numbers}} of <b>berries,</b> each bird {{sometimes}} consuming several hundred a day, more than double its own weight. One individual was recorded as eating between 600 and 1,000 cotoneaster <b>berries</b> in six hours, and defecating every four minutes.

Waxwings forage in large flocks, sometimes of several hundred birds, which enables them to overwhelm birds such as mistle thrushes attempting to defend their fruit trees.|$|E
