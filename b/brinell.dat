5|$|The {{mechanical}} properties {{of iron and}} its alloys can be evaluated {{using a variety of}} tests, including the <b>Brinell</b> test, Rockwell test and the Vickers hardness test. The data on iron is so consistent that it is often used to calibrate measurements or to compare tests. However, the {{mechanical properties}} of iron are significantly affected by the sample's purity: pure, single crystals of iron are actually softer than aluminium, and the purest industrially produced iron (99.99%) has a hardness of 20–30Brinell. An increase in the carbon content will cause {{a significant increase in the}} hardness and tensile strength of iron. Maximum hardness of 65 Rc is achieved with a 0.6% carbon content, although the alloy has low tensile strength. Because of the softness of iron, it is much easier to work with than its heavier congeners ruthenium and osmium.|$|E

Linotype and automotive wheelweights are often used as sources of lead that are blended together in a molten state to achieve the desired <b>Brinell</b> hardness. Other sources of scrap lead, such as recovered bullets, lead cable sheathing, lead pipe, or even lead–acid battery plates, (EXTREME caution should be used as modern battery components, when melted, can yield hazardous, even deadly gases) can yield usable lead with some degree of effort, including purification and measuring of hardness.|$|E
25|$|The {{machinability}} {{rating of}} a material attempts {{to quantify the}} machinability of various materials. It is expressed as a percentage or a normalized value. The American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI) determined machinability ratings {{for a wide variety}} of materials by running turning tests at 180 surface feet per minute (sfpm). It then arbitrarily assigned 160 <b>Brinell</b> B1112 steel a machinability rating of 100%. The machinability rating is determined by measuring the weighed averages of the normal cutting speed, surface finish, and tool life for each material. Note that a material with a machinability rating less than 100% would be more difficult to machine than B1112 and material with a value more than 100% would be easier.|$|E
30|$|For better {{understanding}} wood hardness, {{we developed a}} new hand-operated hardness tester that works with <b>Brinell's</b> method. With this tester we investigated the hardness distribution of wood minutely using a 2 mm diameter ball tip. The following results were obtained: (1) On preliminary examination with medium-density fiberboard, {{we found that the}} value of <b>Brinell's</b> hardness decreased with the increase in the tip ball's diameter but that it was almost constant with the indenting velocity. (2) By using a small diameter tip, the difference of the hardness became clearer between earlywood and latewood. (3) With radial and tangential sections, we obtained hardness distribution patterns similar to those of wood grain. It seems that the hardness distribution reflects the distribution of density on wood surfaces.|$|R
30|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of 613 small clear specimens of 35 species (11 ring-porous hardwoods, 19 diffuse-porous hardwoods, and 5 softwoods) were evaluated. The {{aim of the}} study was to examine indexes of wood quality that are easy to measure and that exhibit a high correlation with bending performance and hardness that are essential properties of hardwood products. The modulus of rigidity, dynamic modulus of elasticity, bending properties (modulus of elasticity, modulus of rupture, stress at the proportional limit, absorbed energy, Tetmajer’s modulus), dynamic energy absorption by an impact bending test, compressive strength parallel to the grain, shear strength, partial bearing strength, and <b>Brinell’s</b> hardness were measured. A high correlation was found between dynamic modulus of elasticity and static modulus of elasticity. Bending stress at the proportional limit was found to be approximately equivalent to the compressive strength parallel to the grain. Static energy absorption correlated with dynamic energy absorption. Tetmajer’s modulus was found to be closely related to the ratio of the initial stiffness within the elastic range to the secant modulus at the maximum load. A high correlation was observed between <b>Brinell’s</b> hardness and partial bearing strength. The difference in the regression coefficients obtained for these correlations between the species groups was small.|$|R

40|$|Utilization of {{ecological}} materials for appliances and products {{is one of}} the ways to achieve the goal of sustainability. Wood-polymer composites as a cheap, lightweight, durable and esthetic material has gained attention of scientists, engineers and consumers alike. Different kinds of polymeric matrices, plants used as the fillers, chemical of physical modifiers and processing technologies have already been widely studied. Nonetheless, surprisingly few information on Wood-Polymer Composites’ tribology can be found. This paper is an attempt to fill this gap. Polypropylene-and poly(lactic acid) -based composites with varying wood flour content have been analyzed. The <b>Brinell’s</b> hardness and coefficient of friction of the samples have been determined. In order to evaluate the influence of the moisture content on the tribological and mechanical properties of the composites, the samples have also been aged in water.

The purpose of examination was to determine the effect of heat treatment (aging at various temperatures) on the microstructure and corrosion resistance of the ZnAl 40 Cu 3 alloy. The scope of the examination included: structural examinations, determination of hardness using <b>Brinell’s</b> method and corrosion resistance examinations. Ageing at higher temperatures causes a creation of areas where is an eutectoid mixture. The study showed that ageing causes a decrease in hardness of ZnAl 40 Cu 3 alloy.

These include: titanium (iv) oxide, iron powder, Cellulose, sodium silicate binder and other additives. In this work, one of the major components was technically and economically substituted. The more popular but expensive potassium silicate binder was replaced by the more readily available sodium silicate. For the newly chosen binder to perform effectively, it was enriched with potassium carbonate (Potash). The flux formulation was not based on the old method of trial and error but some mathematical methods, especially the experimental design approach were applied. The Mc-Cleans and Anderson method was used in the preliminary design to generate the orthogonal array that guided the formulation. Four major components: Titanium dioxide, Iron powder, cellulose and Sodium silicate binder enriched with Potash were considered as the major contributing elements.

40|$|AbstractA new {{formulation}} for elastic-perfectly plastic {{contact in}} the normal direction between two round surfaces that is solely based on material properties and contact geometries is developed. The problem is formulated as three separate domains: the elastic regime, mixed elastic–plastic behavior, and unconstrained (fully plastic) flow. Solutions for the force–displacement relationship in the elastic regime follow from Hertz’s classical solution. In the fully plastic regime, two well supported assumptions are made: {{that there is a}} uniform pressure distribution and there is a linear force–deflection relationship. The force–displacement relationship in the intermediate, mixed elastic–plastic regime is approximated by enforcing continuity between the elastic and fully plastic regimes. Transitions between the three regimes are determined based on empirical quantities: the von Mises yield criterion is used to determine the initiation of mixed elastic–plastic deformation, and <b>Brinell’s</b> hardness for the onset of unconstrained flow. Unloading from each of these three regimes is modeled as an elastic process with different radii of curvature based on the regime in which the maximum force occurred. Simulation results explore the relationship between the impact velocity and coefficient of restitution. Further comparisons are made between the model, experimental results found in the literature, and other existing elastic–plastic models. The new model is well supported by the experimental measurements of compliance curves for elastic–plastic materials and of coefficients of restitution from impact studies, and in elastic-perfectly plastic regimes is demonstrated to be more accurate than existing models found in the literature...|$|R
40|$|The {{accurate}} 3 D {{finite element}} simulation of the Friction Stir Welding (FSW) process requires a proper knowledge of both material and interface behaviors, but friction, the key phenomenon of this process, is quite difficult to model and identify. Friction stir welding {{is a relatively}} new welding process, that has significant advantages compared to the fusion process such as joining conventionally non-fusion weldable alloys. Being a solid-state joining process it produces weld with reduced distortion and improved mechanical properties. The aluminum alloys are widely used in different industrial applications such as ship building, aerospace and automobile industries due to their light weight, good mechanical strength and high corrosion resistance. A three dimensional finite element model is developed to study the thermal history in the butt welding of 6061 aluminum alloy using ANSYS package. Solid 70 elements are used to develop the model. The heat source incorporated in the model involves the friction among the material, probe and shoulder. In this work, a moving co-ordinate has been introduced to model the threedimensional heat transfer process because it reduces the difficulty of modeling the moving tool. In this model the main parameter considered is the heat input from the tool shoulder and tool pin. The temperature distributions of the weld at various welding speeds are obtained. The friction stir welding experiments are carried out at a transverse speed of 0. 75 mm/sec of tool. <b>Brinell’s</b> Hardness test, tensile test and micro structure analysis are performed on the welded material...|$|R

Pin block were divided to eight sections, drilled and fitted by tuning pins. Tightening torque of tuning pins was measured using a torque wrench, depending on the diameter of the hole. Mechanical resistance of the material was measured by microdrill Resistograph. Density distribution in pin blocks and moisture content were determined with gravimetric method. The universal testing machine was used for determination of Janky's and <b>Brinell's</b> hardness, the mechanical properties in compression in plane of the board. Results of tests were evaluated using statistical methods and cross-correlated. A finite-element model in ANSYS software was built, in ordner to clarify the degree and distribution of stress around the hole for tuning pin. Statistically significant differences were found for properties of individual types of pin blocks (especially the density, hardness and compressive strength and tightening torque). Hardness differs significantly when tested perpendicular to the fibers in the plane and along the fibers in the edge. Measurements in individual sections of pin block brought uneven results and did not show statistically significant differences. Significant correlation was found only between the folowing characteristic: type A: the density distribution and the mechanical properties of the plane, density distribution and tightening torque after loosening. Type B: Resistograph resistance and tightening torque after 14 days, the density distribution and mechanical properties of the plane. Type C: density distribution and tightening torque after driving and loosening. Accurate results would be achieved by multiple measurements on multiple pieces of the pin blocks...|$|R

The material for the research served a steel sheet of thickness 1. 4 mm. Steel type H 18 T 1 had a content of chemical elements within grade composition: 0, 12 % C, 17, 5 % Cr, 1 % Mn, 1, 1 % Ni, 0, 85 % Si, 0, 9 % Ti. The specified steel belongs to the semiferritic class of the accepted classification. The structural state of the metal for the study was obtained by cold plastic deformation by rolling at a reduction in the size range of 20 - 30 % and subsequent recrystallization annealing at 740 – 750 ° C. Different degrees of cold plastic deformation was obtained by pre-selection of the initial strip thickness so that after a desired amount of rolling reduction receives the same final thickness. The microstructure was observed under a light microscope, the ferrite grain size was determined using a quantitative metallographic technique. The using of X-ray structural analysis techniques allowed {{determining the}} level of second-order distortion of the crystal latitude of the ferrite. The speed propagation of acoustic vibrations was measured using a special device such as an ISP- 12 with a working frequency of pulses 1. 024 kHz. As the characteristic of strength used the hardness was evaluated by the <b>Brinell’s</b> method. Findings. With increasing of ferrite grain size the hardness of the steel is reduced. In the case of constant structural state of metal, reducing the size of the ferrite grains is accompanied by a natural increasing of the phase distortion. The dependence of the speed propagation of acoustic vibrations up and down the rolling direction of the ferrite grain size remained unchanged and reports directly proportional correlation. Originality. On the basis of studies to determine the direct impact of the proportional nature of the ferrite grain size on the rate of propagation of sound vibrations in the low-carbon alloy steel.
