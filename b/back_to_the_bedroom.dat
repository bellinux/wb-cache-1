6000|$|... "My study," [...] I mumbled, {{and walked}} across the landing. Then {{at the sound of}} my voice a thought struck me, and I went <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> and put in the set of false teeth. They slipped in with the ease of old, habit. [...] "That's better," [...] said I, gnashing them, and so {{returned}} to the study.|$|E
50|$|A simple wooden {{surround}} {{frames the}} main entrance, {{topped by a}} transom. It opens into a side hall that leads <b>to</b> parlors on <b>the</b> west and (in the wing) on the east. Behind the parlor is the library. Both parlors have Greek Revival interior decorations—atticurge architraves on the east and corner blocks on the west, where the baseboard forms a plinth block at the floor. A set of stairs near <b>the</b> <b>back</b> leads <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedrooms</b> upstairs.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> scene changes <b>to</b> Woodruff {{having dinner}} at the female's house with her and her father. The father becomes angry and throws tea in Woodruff's face before an {{argument}} occurs. <b>The</b> scene changes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> female's <b>bedroom,</b> where she's lying in bed and smoking. The video then shows Woodruff in his bedroom, tearing {{a picture of her}} in two. He falls asleep and dreams about her. <b>The</b> scene changes <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> female's <b>bedroom,</b> where she notices Woodruff standing outside of her window, holding a radio (hence the line, [...] "I'm outside of your window, with my radio."). The female walks away, seemingly turning Woodruff down.|$|R
60|$|Certainly she {{had never}} seen such a bedroom in her life. By {{comparison}} even with the largest of the hotel apartments they had occupied it was vast; it had writing-tables and a dainty bookcase and a blushing sofa, and dressing-tables and a bureau and a rose-red screen and three large windows. Her thoughts went <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> narrow little <b>bedroom</b> at Penge with which she had hitherto been so entirely content. Her own few little books, a photograph or so,--they'd never dare to come here, even if she dared to bring them.|$|R
60|$|I {{hardly know}} when I roused myself. I hardly know when I groped my way <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom,</b> and lighted the candle, and searched (with a strange ignorance, at first, {{of where to}} look for them) for dry clothes to warm me. The doing of these things is in my mind, but not the time when they were done.|$|E
60|$|The old man, who {{had never}} raised his eyes during the whole {{transaction}} of Mr Fledgeby's joke, silently bowed and passed out by the door which Fledgeby opened for him. Having closed it on him, Fledgeby returned to Lammle, standing with his <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> fire, with one hand under his coat-skirts, and all his whiskers in the other.|$|E
6000|$|He roused {{himself and}} spoke gruffly to his bath-things. [...] "Come here! You've done enough fooling!" [...] he reproved the treacherous soap, and defied the scratchy nail-brush with [...] "Oh, you would, would you!" [...] He soaped himself, and rinsed himself, and austerely rubbed himself; he noted {{a hole in}} the Turkish towel, and meditatively thrust a finger through it, and marched <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom,</b> a grave and {{unbending}} citizen.|$|E
5000|$|Ellen goes <b>back</b> up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>to</b> {{change her}} clothes and sees the gun still in George's hand, narrating, [...] "Somehow I knew I shouldn't leave it there." [...] As she {{wrenches}} the pistol from his hand, it fires. Readying herself <b>to</b> leave <b>the</b> house, a polite but somewhat aggressive notary (Don Haggerty) rings the doorbell, telling her he has an appointment with George to go over some legal documents. She steadfastly says George is too sick to see anyone. Ellen desperately drives downtown <b>to</b> <b>the</b> post office <b>to</b> see <b>the</b> supervisor, who is friendly and gives her a form for George to sign but then, nettled by Ellen's unhinged and uncooperative behavior, tells her he is going <b>to</b> allow <b>the</b> letter <b>to</b> be delivered. Defeated, she returns <b>to</b> <b>the</b> house and, as she gets <b>to</b> <b>the</b> front door, a kindly neighbor woman (Georgia Backus) offers to help Ellen, since she has seemed so upset all day.|$|R
60|$|The drawers of the {{writing-desk}} were locked. Its revolving top {{was also}} locked. I {{could see no}} indications of the keys, and there were none {{in the pockets of}} my trousers. I shuffled <b>back</b> at once <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom,</b> and went through the dress suit, and afterwards the pockets of all the garments I could find. I was very eager, and one might have imagined that burglars had been at work, to see my room when I had done. Not only were there no keys to be found, but not a coin, nor a scrap of paper--save only the receipted bill of the overnight dinner.|$|R
60|$|And then he bumped {{his nose}}. Yes, Sir, Peter bumped his nose against {{the end of}} that hall. You see, it was an old house, and like most old houses it was rather a tumble-down affair. Anyway, the back door had been blocked with a great stone, and the walls of the back hall had fallen in. There was no way out there. Sadly Peter <b>backed</b> out <b>to</b> <b>the</b> little <b>bedroom.</b> He would wait until night, and perhaps then the Yellow Jackets would be asleep, and he could steal out the front way without getting any more stings. Meanwhile he would try to get a nap and forget his aches and pains.|$|R
6000|$|After {{that he went}} <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom,</b> {{and stood}} there some time {{regarding}} his wife's silent form. She was a woman some years older than himself, but had {{not by any means}} overpassed the maturity of good looks and vigour. Her passionate features, well-defined, firm, and statuesque in life, were doubly so now: her mouth and brow, beneath her purplish black hair, showed only too clearly that the turbulency of character which had made a bear-garden of his house had been no temporary phase of her existence. While he reflected, he suddenly said to himself, I wonder if all has been done? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was a {{long time}} before they rang for me. The coachman was sent for before I was summoned <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom.</b> He was {{dispatched}} to Edinburgh for the second time, with a written message from Dr. Jerome to his head servant, saying that there was no chance of his returning to the city and to his patients for some hours to come. Some of us thought this looked badly for Mrs. Macallan. Others said it might mean that the doctor had hopes of saving her, but expected to be a long time in doing it.|$|E
60|$|Just as I {{was turning}} away wearily {{from the window}} to go <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> and make a second attempt to {{complete}} the unfinished entry in my journal, I smelt the odour of tobacco-smoke stealing towards me on the heavy night air. The next moment I saw a tiny red spark advancing from the farther end {{of the house in}} the pitch darkness. I heard no footsteps, and I could see nothing but the spark. It travelled along in the night, passed the window at which I was standing, and stopped opposite my bedroom window, inside which I had left the light burning on the dressing-table.|$|E
5000|$|The MacDonald family all had {{different}} blood types — a statistical [...] {{that was used}} to theorize what had happened in their house. Starting with the assumption that they were the only four people bleeding in there, investigators theorized that a fight began in <b>the</b> master <b>bedroom</b> between MacDonald and Colette, who possibly argued over Kristen wetting his side of the bed while sleeping there. Investigators speculated that the argument turned physical as she probably hit him on the forehead with a hairbrush, which resulted in his head wound concussion. As he retaliated by hitting her, first with his fists and then beating her with a piece of lumber, Kimberly, whose blood and brain serum was found in the doorway, may have walked in after hearing the commotion and was struck at least once on the head, possibly by accident. Believing Colette dead, MacDonald carried the mortally wounded Kimberly <b>back</b> <b>to</b> her bedroom. After stabbing her (whose blood was discovered on his pajama top which he said he had not been wearing while in her room), he went to Kristen's room, intent on disposing of the last remaining potential witness. Before he could do so, Colette, whose blood was found on Kristen's bed covers and on one wall of the room, apparently regained consciousness, stumbled in, and threw herself over Kristen. After killing both of them, he wrapped Colette's body in a sheet and carried it <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> master <b>bedroom,</b> leaving a smudged footprint of her blood on his way out of Kristen's room.|$|R

6000|$|Up till {{almost the}} last moment Charles nursed his dispatch-box. But as the [...] "baggage-smashers" [...] were taking down our luggage, and a chambermaid was {{lounging}} officiously about {{in search of a}} tip, he laid it down for a second or two on the centre table while he collected his other immediate impedimenta. He couldn't find his cigarette-case, and went <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> for it. I helped him hunt, but it had disappeared mysteriously. That moment lost him. When we had found the cigarette-case, and returned to the sitting-room--lo, and behold! the dispatch-box was missing! Charles questioned the servants, but none of them had noticed it. He searched round the room--not a trace of it anywhere.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{had taken}} with me {{two or three}} things that I foresaw I should want. Among them was an auger, and some corks of a size that would exactly fit the hole that it would make. Simcoe's bedroom communicated with the sitting room, and he always used this door in going from one room to the other; and {{it was evident that}} it was only through that that I could get a view of what was going on. I did not see how I could {{possibly}} make a hole through the door itself. It was on one side, next to that where the fireplace was, and there was a window directly opposite, and of course a hole would have been noticed immediately. The only place that I could see to make it was through the door frame. Its position was a matter of much calculation, I can assure you. The auger was half an inch bore. I dared not get it larger, {{and it would have been}} hopeless to try and see anything with a smaller one, especially as the hole would have to be four or five inches long. As I sometimes went into the room when they were together, either with hot water or grilled bones, or something of that sort, I was able to notice exactly where the chairs were generally placed. Simcoe sat with his <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> door, and the other man on the other side of the hearthrug, facing him. I, therefore, decided to make the hole on the side nearest to the wall, so that I could see the other man past Simcoe. Of course I wanted the hole to be as low as possible, as it would not be so likely to be noticed as it would were it higher up. I chose a point, therefore, that would come level with my eye when I was kneeling down.|$|E
6000|$|... "When I {{answered}} the bell, {{at the time}} I have mentioned, I found the deceased standing at the fireplace. There was a bottle of medicine on the table, by her writing desk. It was a much larger bottle than that which the last witness identified, and {{it was more than}} three parts full of some colourless medicine. The deceased gave me a prescription to take to the chemist's, with instructions to wait, and bring back the physic. She said, 'I don't feel at all well this morning; I thought of trying some of this medicine,' pointing to the bottle by her desk; 'but I am not sure it is the right thing for me. I think I want a tonic. The prescription I have given you is a tonic.' I went out at once to our chemist and got it. I found her writing a letter when I came back, but she finished it immediately, and pushed it away from her. When I put the bottle I had brought from the chemist on the table, she looked at the other larger bottle which she had by her; and she said, 'You will think me very undecided; I have been doubting, since I sent you to the chemist, whether I had not better begin with this medicine here, before I try the tonic. It's a medicine for the stomach; and I fancy it's only indigestion that's the matter with me, after all.' I said, 'You eat but a poor breakfast, ma'am, this morning. It isn't for me to advise; but, as you seem to be in doubt about yourself, wouldn't it be better to send for a doctor?' She shook her head, and said she didn't want to have a doctor if she could possibly help it. 'I'll try the medicine for indigestion first,' she says; 'and if it doesn't relieve me, we will see what is to be done, later in the day.' While we were talking, the tonic was left in its sealed paper cover, just as I had brought it from the shop. She took up the bottle containing the stomach medicine, and read the directions on it: 'Two tablespoonsful by measure-glass twice a day.' I asked if she had a measure-glass; and she said, Yes, and sent me to her bedroom to look for it. I couldn't find it. While I was looking, I heard her cry out, and ran back to the drawing-room to see what was the matter. 'Oh!' she says, 'how clumsy I am! I've broken the bottle.' She held up the bottle of the stomach medicine and showed it to me, broken just below the neck. 'Go back to the bedroom,' she says, 'and see if you can find an empty bottle; I don't want to waste the medicine if I can help it.' There was only one empty bottle in the bedroom, a bottle on the chimney-piece. I took it to her immediately. She gave me the broken bottle; and while I poured the medicine into the bottle which I had found in the bedroom, she opened the paper which covered the tonic I had brought from the chemist. When I had done, and the two bottles were together on the table--the bottle that I had filled, and the bottle that I had brought front the chemist--I noticed that they were both of the same size, and that both had a label pasted on them, marked 'Poison.' I said to her, 'You must take care, ma'am, you don't make any mistake, the two bottles are so exactly alike.' 'I can easily prevent that,' she says, and dipped her pen in the ink, and copied the directions on the broken bottle, on to the label of the bottle that I had just filled. 'There!' she said. 'Now I hope your mind's at ease?' She spoke cheerfully, as if she was joking with me. And then she said, 'But where's the measure-glass?' I went <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> to look for it, and couldn't find it again. She changed all at once, upon that--she became quite angry; and walked up and down in a fume, abusing me for my stupidity. It was very unlike her. On all other occasions she was a most considerate lady. I made allowances for her. She had been very much upset earlier in the morning, when she had received a letter, which she told me herself contained bad news. Yes; another person was present at the time--the same woman that my mistress told you of. The woman looked at the address on the letter, and seemed to know who it was from. I told her a squint-eyed man had brought it to the house--and then she left directly. I don't know where she went, or the address at which she lives, or who the messenger was who brought the letter. As I have said, I made allowances for the deceased lady. I went downstairs, without answering, and got a tumbler and a tablespoon to serve instead of the measure-glass. When I came back with the things, she was still walking about in a temper. She took no notice of me. I left the room again quietly, seeing she was not in a state to be spoken to. I saw nothing more of her, until we were alarmed by hearing her scream. We found the poor lady on the floor in a kind of fit. I ran out and fetched the nearest doctor. This is the whole truth, on my oath; and this is all I know about it." ...|$|E
