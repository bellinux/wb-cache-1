40|$|We {{consider}} an integrated production–distribution scheduling model in a make-to-order supply chain con-sisting of one supplier and one customer. The supplier receives {{a set of}} orders from the customer {{at the beginning of}} a planning horizon. The supplier needs to process all the orders at a single production line, pack the completed orders to form <b>delivery</b> <b>batches,</b> and deliver the batches to the customer. Each order has a weight, and the total weight of the orders packed in a batch must not exceed the capacity of the <b>delivery</b> <b>batch.</b> Each <b>delivery</b> <b>batch</b> incurs a fixed distribution cost. The problem is to find jointly a schedule for order processing and a way of packing completed orders to form <b>delivery</b> <b>batches</b> such that the total distribution cost (or equivalently, the number of <b>delivery</b> <b>batches)</b> is minimized subject to the constraint that a given customer service level is guar-anteed. We consider two customer service constraints—meeting the given deadlines of the orders; or requiring the average delivery lead time of the orders to be within a given threshold. Several problems of the model with each of those constraints are considered. We clarify the complexity of each problem and develop fast heuristics for the NP-hard problems and analyze their worst-case performance bounds. Our computational results indicate that all the heuristics are capable of generating near optimal solutions quickly for the respective problems.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} a <b>batch</b> <b>delivery</b> single-machine scheduling problem in which jobs have an assignable common due window. Each job will incur an early (tardy) penalty {{if it is}} early (tardy) {{with respect to the}} common due window under a given schedule.

40|$|We study a <b>batch</b> <b>delivery</b> single machine {{scheduling}} problem where the due dates are controllable and {{the objective is}} to minimize earliness, tardiness, holding, due date assignment and delivery costs. The earliness, tardiness and holding cost are assumed to be proportional to the corresponding duration. For each customer order (job) there is a specific acceptable lead time that the customer who placed the order considers to be reasonable and acceptable and therefore there is no penalty by assigning a due date not greater than the acceptable lead time. If the due date is greater than the acceptable date then the due date cost is proportional to the deviation from the acceptable lead time. The <b>batch</b> <b>delivery</b> cost is fixed and there is no capacity limitation on the size of a batch. We provide some properties of the optimal schedule, and prove that the problem is -hard. A polynomial time optimization algorithm is presented for two special cases.

40|$|The {{delivery}} scheduling {{process of}} a regional wholesaler was analyzed {{in order to develop}} a more strategic scheduling program. The strategic schedule was designed to utilize weekly demand history, opposed to daily demand, in order to decrease small <b>batch</b> <b>deliveries,</b> aid in store inventory management and foster customer relations. This was accomplished with a linear mathematical program, which produced a standard weekly schedule. A metric for the maximum days between deliveries was developed to show the improved delivery day distribution. For the 30 stores analyzed, the average maximum days between deliveries fell from 5. 04 days to 3. 37 days. The decreased time between deliveries will assist the small stores in inventory management. Additionally, the standardized schedule will allow storeowners and truck drivers to develop a productive relationship, which should be able to decrease delivery time and grow customer relations. by David Gilchrist.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the <b>batching</b> <b>delivery</b> problem with soft time windows {{and its impact on}} the demand {{allocation}} and production scheduling in manufacturing plants. It is critical to be able to provide the right goods or service at the right time in order to win customer orders. However, this can require high coordination among entities in the supply network. A mismatch of a single schedule may seriously influence the reliability of the supply network. Hence, holistically optimizing the schedule of each entity in the network to achieve greater coordination can reap significant rewards. The paper will also explore the tradeoff between high customer service levels in meeting due dates and operating cost. On-time delivery can result in high operating cost, while permitting early or tardy deliveries can reduce costs. Hence, we consider the problem of how to minimize operating costs when time windows are soft while maintaining a certain customer service level. A co-evolutionary Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is developed. Computational results show that soft time windows have a significant effect and that there are advantages in considering the coordination across the supply chai...|$|R

40|$|We study {{a problem}} in which a set of n jobs has to be batched as well as {{scheduled}} for processing on a single machine. A constant machine set-up time is required before the first job of each batch is processed. A schedule specifies the sequence of batches, where each batch comprises a sequence of jobs. The <b>batch</b> <b>delivery</b> time {{is defined as the}} completion time of the last job in a batch. The earliness of a job is defined as the difference between the delivery time of the batch to which it belongs and the job completion time. The objective is to find a number B of batches and a schedule so as to minimize the sum of the total weighted job earliness and mean <b>batch</b> <b>delivery</b> time. The problem is shown to be strongly NP-hard. It remains strongly NP-hard if the set-up time is zero and B ≤ U for any variable U ≥ 2 or if B ≥ U for any constant U ≥ 2. The problem is proved to be ordinary NP-hard even if the set-up time is zero and B ≤ 2. For the case B ≤ U, a dynamic programming algorithm is presented, which is pseudopolynomial for any constant U ≥ 2. Algorithms with O(n²) running times are derived for the cases when all weights are equal or all processing times are equal. For the general problem, a family of heuristics is suggested. Computational experiments on the proposed heuristic algorithm are conducted. The results suggest that the heuristics are effective in generating near-optimal solutions quickly.

30|$|Nevertheless, {{the current}} continuous-time {{expression}} MILP model ignores the time nodes such as batches’ arrival and <b>batch</b> <b>delivery</b> operation’s starting and ending moment, which will inevitably bring about uneconomical operating period distribution and excessive time-window offset. Those will decrease the model’s practicability. Moreover, {{a large number}} of models take the limit of download and injection size as known parameters which are time-related. It would be more reasonable if it is replaced by a limit of operating flow rate. This paper uses the time-continuous expression method to establish a LP model on the basis of known time nodes’ sequence. The objective function is the minimum deviation between the demand batch volume and the actual offloading volume at each station. To accelerate solving speed, the hybrid algorithm of ACO (ant colony optimization) and the SM (simplex method) is used to solve the model.|$|E
