5000|$|A {{stamping}} press is a machine press used to shape or cut metal by deforming {{it with a}} die. It generally consists of a press frame, a <b>bolster</b> <b>plate,</b> and a ram.|$|E
50|$|The <b>bolster</b> <b>plate</b> {{is mounted}} {{on top of the}} press bed and is a large block of metal upon which the bottom portion of a die is clamped; the <b>bolster</b> <b>plate</b> is stationary. Large presses (like the ones used in the {{automotive}} industry) may be equipped die cushions integrated in the <b>bolster</b> <b>plate</b> to apply blank holder or counter draw forces. This is necessary when a single acting press is used for deep drawing. The ram / slide is the moving or reciprocating member that the upper die is mounted to. Ram or Slide guidance is a critical element to assure long die life between die maintenance. Different types of slide guides are available, 4 point V-Gibs or 6 point square gibs on smaller presses and 8 point full length slide guides on larger straight side frame presses. With the dies and material be fed into the die between the bolster and slide, good press designs must account for plastic deformation, other wise known as defection when frame design and loads are considered.|$|E
50|$|The handles {{are most}} often made of {{hardwood}} or water buffalo horn, but ivory, bone, and metal handles have also been produced. The handle quite often has a flared butt that allows better retention in draw cuts and chopping. Most handles have metal <b>bolsters</b> and butt <b>plates</b> which are generally made of brass or steel.|$|R
50|$|On its stroke from TDC to BDC, {{the punch}} enters the material, pushing {{it through the}} die, obtaining the shape {{determined}} by {{the design of the}} punch and die set. The piece of material (slug) cut from the workpiece is ejected through the die and <b>bolster</b> <b>plate</b> and collected in a scrap container. The return to TDC signals to the control to begin the next cycle.|$|E
50|$|Most punch presses are {{mechanically}} operated, {{but simple}} punches are often hand-powered. Major components of this mechanical press are the frame, motor, ram, die posts, bolster, and bed. The punch is mounted into the ram, and the die is mounted to the <b>bolster</b> <b>plate.</b> The scrap material drops through as the workpiece is advanced {{for the next}} hole. A large computer-controlled punch press is called a CNC turret punch. It houses punches and their corresponding dies in a revolving indexed turret. These machines use hydraulic as well as pneumatic power to press the shape with enough force to shear the metal.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of the investigations carried out by the Institut f√ºr Werkzeugmaschinen und Fertigungstechnik (IWF) of the Technical University of Berlin {{on the subject of the}} influence of the abrasive belt specification during belt grinding with <b>bolster</b> <b>plate.</b> The objective of this investigation was to analyze the influence of the grain type, grain size and of the grinding belt system (conventional single layered, compact grain and hollow sphere abrasive multi-layered) on tool wear, the work result and the grinding forces...|$|E
