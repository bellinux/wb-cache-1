We had ever installed the various kinds of surface inspection systems, such as a linear CCD and a laser typed surface inspection system at cold rolled strip production lines. But these systems cannot fulfill the sufficient detection and classification rate, and real time processing performance. In order to increase detection and classification rate, we have used the Dark, <b>Bright</b> and Transition <b>field</b> <b>illumination</b> and area type CCD camera, and for the real time image processing, parallel computing has been used. In this paper, we introduce the automatic surface inspection system and real time image processing technique using the object detection, defect detection, classification algorithm and its performance obtained at the production line.

40|$|SUMMARY A new {{staining}} {{method was}} developed {{for the detection of}} inclusions of Chlamydia psittaci and Chiamydia trachomatis inclusions in cell cultures. Using a combination of methyl green and neutral red stains and washing at pH 5 * 0, inclusions were stained red while cell cytoplasm was pale pink and cell nuclei were pale green. The method was significantly better than Giemsa staining and comparable to immunofluorescence for detecting C psittaci inclusions. Its sensitivity for detect-in C trachomatis inclusions by dark field microscopy was similar to that of Giemsa staining. A variety of staining methods have been used to visualise chlamydial inclusions in cell culture monolayers and conjunctival scrapings. 1 2 Giemsa stain, combined with dark <b>field</b> <b>illumination,</b> has been commonly used to detect Chlamydia tracho-matis inclusions in cell culture monolayers, but this has not proved to be satisfactory for detecting Chlamydia psittaci inclusions. 34 While such inclu-sions can be seen by <b>bright</b> <b>field</b> microscopy, th...|$|R

40|$|A <b>Bright</b> <b>Field</b> <b>Illumination</b> {{system for}} {{inspecting}} {{a range of}} characteristically different kinds of defects, depressions, and ridges in a selected material surface. The system has an illumination source placed near a first focus of an elliptical reflector. In addition, a camera facing the inspected area is placed near the illumination source and the first focus. The second focus of the elliptical reflector is located at a distance approximately twice the elliptical reflector's distance above the inspected surface.

40|$|Many {{pulse power}} {{applications}} in {{use at the}} Pegasus facility at the Los Alamos National Laboratory require specialized imaging techniques. Due to the short event duration times, visible images are recorded by high speed electronic framing cameras. Framing cameras provide the advantages of high speed movies of back light experiments. These high speed framing cameras require bright illumination sources to record images with 10 ns integration times. High power lasers offer sufficient light for back illuminating the target assemblies; however, laser speckle noise lowers the contrast in the image. Laser speckle noise also limits the effective resolution. This discussion focuses {{on the use of}} telescopes to collect images 50 feet away. Both light field and dark <b>field</b> <b>illumination</b> techniques are compared.

As the ejection mechanism of picosecond LIFT {{has not been}} visualized in detail, the governing physics are not fully understood yet. Therefore, this article presents an experimental imaging study on the ejection process of gold-based LIFT.

The high magnification images were obtained using <b>bright</b> <b>field</b> <b>illumination</b> by a 6 ns pulsed Nd:YAG laser source and a 50 × long-distance microscope objective that was combined with a 200 mm tube lens.
