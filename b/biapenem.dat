40|$|Objectives The {{proliferation}} of carbapenemases in Enterobacteriaceae demands new therapies, with current interest centred on ß-lactamase inhibitor combinations. RPX 7009 {{is a new}} boron-based inhibitor of several class A and C ß-lactamases and is being developed in combination with <b>biapenem</b> (RPX 2003). We investigated the in vitro activity of the combination. Methods Three hundred Enterobacteriaceae isolates, representing major carbapenemase types, were tested. MICs were determined by CLSI agar dilution with RPX 7009 at 2, 4 and 8 mg/L or in a chequerboard format with RPX 7009 in doubling dilutions from 0. 25 to 32 mg/L. Results RPX 7009 lacked direct antibacterial activity but achieved a dose-dependent potentiation of <b>biapenem</b> against Enterobacteriaceae possessing KPC, SME or IMI/NMC-A carbapenemases: concentrations as low as 2 mg/L reduced the MICs of <b>biapenem</b> to = 1 mg/L for over 90 % of isolates. RPX 7009 also gave a weak potentiation of <b>biapenem</b> against Enterobacteriaceae with combinations of AmpC or extended-spectrum ß-lactamase activity and impermeability, although any practical gain against such strains {{will depend on the}} breakpoints assigned. RPX 7009 had no effect on the MICs of <b>biapenem</b> for isolates with metallo- (IMP, NDM or VIM) or OXA- 48 ß-lactamases; however, most isolates with these enzymes were less resistant to <b>biapenem</b> than to imipenem or, especially, ertapenem. Conclusions Biapenem/RPX 7009 (Carbavance) overcame most resistance due to KPC and other class A carbapenemases.

The in vitro activity of imipenem was compared between 1990 and 1992 in Nagasaki University Hospital. The resistance rate of S. aureus, whose MIC is higher than 25 mg/l, increased from 3 % to 22 %, S. pneumoniae, whose MIC is higher than 0. 05 mg/l, increased from 9 % to 30 % and P. aeruginosa, whose MIC is higher than 5 mg/l, increased from 20 % to 32 %. The isolation rates of S. maltophilia from sputum increased gradually from 0. 9 % in 1984 to 3. 5 % in 1991.

40|$|The {{first line}} of defense by {{bacteria}} against β-lactam antibiotics is the expression of β-lactamases, which cleave the amide bond of the β-lactam ring. In the reaction of <b>biapenem</b> inactivation by B 2 metallo β-lactamases (MβLs), after the β-lactam ring is opened, the carboxyl group generated by the hydrolytic process and the hydroxyethyl group (common to all carbapenems) rotate around the C 5 -C 6 bond, assuming a new position that allows a proton transfer from the hydroxyethyl group to C 2, and a nucleophilic attack on C 3 by the oxygen atom of the same side-chain. This process leads to the formation of a bicyclic compound, as originally observed in the X-ray structure of the metallo β-lactamase CphA in complex with product. QM/MM and metadynamics simulations of the post-hydrolysis steps in solution and in the enzyme reveal that while the rotation of the hydroxyethyl group can occur in solution or in the enzyme active site, formation of the bicyclic compound occurs primarily in solution, after which the final product binds back to the enzyme. The calculations also suggest that the rotation and cyclization steps can occur at a rate comparable to that observed experimentally for the enzymatic inactivation of <b>biapenem</b> only if the hydrolysis reaction leaves the N 4 nitrogen of the β-lactam ring unprotonated. The calculations support the existence of a common mechanism (in which ionized N 4 is the leaving group) for carbapenems hydrolysis in all MβLs, and suggest a possible revision of mechanisms for B 2 MβLs in which the cleavage of the β-lactam ring is associated with or immediately followed by protonation of N 4.

Complementation of the blaJ and blaP mutations conferred greater resistance to <b>biapenem,</b> panipenem, and imipenem than to BO- 2727 and meropenem, most notably in the outer membrane protein D 2 -deficient strain. The higher levels of resistance to <b>biapenem,</b> panipenem, and imipenem {{can be explained by}} the slow but significant hydrolysis by beta-lactamase, whereas the reduced levels of resistance to BO- 2727 and meropenem would be attributable to their stability in the presence of high levels of beta-lactamase and the fact that they cause only low induction of beta-lactamase. It is also noted that the activity of BO- 2727 against the beta-lactamase-deficient strain was less affected by the loss of the D 2 porin than was that of meropenem, indicating that BO- 2727 in comparison with meropenem can overcome an intrinsic resistance caused by the loss of D 2. Moreover, comparative in vitro resistance studies have shown that BO- 2727 and meropenem selected fewer resistant cells than other carbapenems. In conclusion, BO- 2727 exhibited improved activity against imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa, probably because of its ability to overcome loss of the D 2 porin and beta-lactamase hydrolysis...|$|E

40|$|A general {{mechanism}} {{has been}} proposed for metallo β-lactamases (MβLs), in which deprotonation of a water molecule near the Zn ion(s) results {{in the formation of}} a hydroxide ion that attacks the carbonyl oxygen of the β-lactam ring. However, because of the absence of X-ray structures that show the exact position of the antibiotic in the reactant state (RS) it has been difficult to obtain a definitive validation of this mechanism. We have employed a strategy to identify the RS, which does not rely on substrate docking and/or molecular dynamics. Starting from the X-ray structure of the enzyme:product complex (the product state, PS), a QM/MM scan was used to drive the reaction uphill from product back to reactant. Since in this process also the enzyme changes from PS to RS, we actually generate the enzyme:substrate complex from product and avoid the uncertainties associated with models of the reactant state. We used this strategy to study the reaction of <b>biapenem</b> hydrolysis by B 2 MβL CphA. QM/MM simulations were carried out under 14 different ionization states of the active site, in order to generate potential energy surfaces (PESs) corresponding to a variety of possible reaction paths. The calculations support a model for <b>biapenem</b> hydrolysis by CphA, in which the nucleophile that attacks the β-lactam ring is not the water molecule located in proximity of the active site Zn, but a second water molecule, hydrogen bonded to the first one, which is used up in the reaction, and thus is not visible in the X-ray structure of the enzyme:product complex...|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} the in vitro activity of antibiotics, including arbekacin, cefminox, fosfomycin and <b>biapenem</b> {{which are all}} still unavailable in India, against Gram-negative clinical isolates. We prospectively collected and tested all consecutive isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. from blood, urine and sputum samples between March and November 2012. The minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) of 16 antibiotics {{was determined by the}} broth micro-dilution method. Overall 925 isolates were included; 211 E. coli, 207 Klebsiella spp., 153 P. aeruginosa, and 354 Acinetobacter spp. The MIC 50 and MIC 90 were high for cefminox, <b>biapenem</b> and arbekacin for all pathogens but interpretative criteria were not available. The MIC 50 was categorized as susceptible for a couple of antibiotics, including piperacillin/tazobactam, carbapenems and amikacin, for E. coli, Klebsiella spp. and P. aeruginosa. However, for Acinetobacter spp., the MIC 50 was categorized as susceptible only for colistin. On the other hand, fosfomycin was the only antibiotic that inhibited 90 % of E. coli and Klebsiella spp. isolates, while 90 % of P. aeruginosa isolates were inhibited only by colistin. Finally, 90 % of Acinetobacter spp. isolates were not inhibited by any antibiotic tested. Fosfomycin and colistin might be promising antibiotics for the treatment of infections due to E. coli or Klebsiella spp. and P. aeruginosa, respectively, in India; however, clinical trials should first corroborate the in vitro findings. The activity of tigecycline should be evaluated, as this is commonly used as last-resort option for the treatment of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter infections...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTAmong {{the many}} {{different}} structurally distinct classes of β-lactams, the carbapenem class is regarded as that which is most potent and which has the widest spectrum of antimicrobial activity. Rapidly bactericidal, and demonstrating time-dependent killing, carbapenemes have a spectrum of antimicrobial activity that includes Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic pathogens. Their in-vitro activity includes extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) -producing pathogens and carbapenems are currently {{considered to be the}} treatment of choice for serious infections due to ESBL-producing organisms. However, isolates acquiring resistance under treatment have been reported. Imipenem, meropenem and ertapenem are licensed in the European Community and panipenem and <b>biapenem</b> are also available in Japan and South Korea. Other carbapenemes are under development...|$|E
40|$|Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO 1 showed {{increased}} phenotypic {{resistance to}} imipenem, panipenem, and <b>biapenem</b> {{specifically in the}} presence of salicylate. The antipseudomonal activity of carbapenems was reduced in proportion to the concentration of salicylate. This resistance was transient and nonheritable. The synthesis of the outer membrane protein D 2 (OprD or OprD 2) in P. aeruginosa PAO 1 was inhibited by 4 to 32 mM salicylate in the bacterial growth medium, whereas no changes in any other outer membrane proteins were observed. These results indicate that salicylate suppresses the synthesis of OprD and therefore reduces the antipseudomonal activity of carbapenems. Under these conditions, one carbapenem [...] meropenem [...] is still active against P. aeruginosa, which indicates that meropenem can pass through the outer membrane via both the D 2 channel and another undefined route(s) ...|$|E
40|$|MICs of six extended-spectrum {{cephalosporins}} (cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, FK 037, cefpirome, cefepime), three carbapenems (imipenem, meropenem, <b>biapenem),</b> and vancomycin for 49 penicillin-susceptible (S), 77 penicillin intermediate-resistant (I), and 51 penicillin-resistant (R) pneumococci {{were determined}} by agar dilution. Compared with ceftazidime (MICs for 90 % of strains tested [MIC 90 s] of 2. 0, 16. 0, and 16. 0 micrograms/ml for S, I, and R strains, respectively), all other cephalosporins yielded lower MICs (MIC 90 s of 0. 06 to 0. 125, 0. 5 to 1. 0, and 1. 0 to 2. 0 micrograms/ml against S, I, and R strains, respectively). All three carbapenems were very active, with MIC 90 s, even for R strains, of < or = 1. 0 micrograms/ml. All strains were susceptible to vancomycin (MIC 90 of 0. 5 micrograms/ml) ...|$|E
40|$|Carbapenems (imipenem, meropenem, <b>biapenem,</b> ertapenem, and doripenem) are β-lactam {{antimicrobial}} agents. Because carbapenems {{have the}} broadest spectra among all β-lactams and are primarily {{used to treat}} infections by multi-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, the emergence and spread of carbapenemases became a major public health concern. Carbapenemases are the most versatile family of β-lactamases {{that are able to}} hydrolyze carbapenems and many other β-lactams. According to the dependency of divalent cations for enzyme activation, carbapenemases can be divided into metallo-carbapenemases (zinc-dependent class B) and non-metallo-carbapenemases (zinc-independent classes A, C, and D). Many studies have provided various carbapenemase structures. Here we present a comprehensive and systematic review of three-dimensional structures of carbapenemase-carbapenem complexes {{as well as those of}} carbapenemases. We update recent studies in understanding the enzymatic mechanism of each class of carbapenemase, and summarize structural insights about regions and residues that are important in acquiring the carbapenemase activity...|$|E
40|$|The BlaB metallo-beta-lactamase of Chryseobacterium meningosepticum CCUG 4310 was overproduced in Escherichia coli {{by means}} of a T 7 promoter-based {{expression}} system. The overproducing system, scaled up in a 15 -liter fermentor, yielded approximately 10 mg of BlaB protein per liter, mostly released in the culture supernatant. The enzyme was purified by two ion-exchange chromatographic steps with an overall yield of 66 %. Analysis of the kinetic parameters revealed efficient activities (k(cat) /K-m ratios of > 10 (6) M- 1 s(- 1)) toward most penam and carbapenem compounds, {{with the exception of the}} 6 -alpha-methoxypenam derivative temocillin and of <b>biapenem,</b> which were poorer substrates. Hydrolysis of cephalosporins was overall less efficient, with a remarkable variability that was largely due to variable affinities of the BlaB enzyme for different compounds. BlaB was also able to hydrolyze serine-beta-lactamase inhibitors, including beta-iodopenicillanate, sulbactam and, although less efficiently, tazobactam. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|ME 1071, a {{maleic acid}} derivative, {{is a novel}} {{specific}} inhibitor for metallo-β-lactamases (MBL). In this study, the potentiation of ME 1071 in combination with several β-lactams was evaluated using MBL-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. The rates of susceptibility of MBL producers to carbapenems (imipenem, <b>biapenem,</b> and doripenem) and ceftazidime were increased by 8 to 27 % {{in the presence of}} 32 μg/ml of ME 1071. The corresponding resistance rates were decreased by 13 to 46 %, respectively. On the other hand, ME 1071 showed weaker or no potentiation with non-MBL producers. The Ki value of ME 1071 for IMP- 1 was 0. 4 μM, significantly lower than the Km values of carbapenems for the IMP- 1 enzyme. On the other hand, the Ki value of ME 1071 for VIM- 2 was 120 μM, higher than the Km values of carbapenems for the VIM- 2 enzyme. Results {{of this study indicate that}} ME 1071 can potentiate the activity of ceftazidime and carbapenems against MBL-producing strains of P. aeruginosa...|$|E
