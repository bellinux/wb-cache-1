One of the other players accidentally spills a table of drinks on them, so they cause the basketball to bounce underneath the bleachers and it closes when he goes to get it, killing him.

Since these women had sexual problems, their sexual lives with their partners became a burden without pleasure, and eventually, they may completely lose interest in sexual activity.

Several factors can affect female dysfunction, such as situations in which women do not trust their sex partners. The environment where sex occurs is crucial, since being in an extremely public or extremely private place may make some women feel uncomfortable.

He continued to incorporate the spatial device he was to use many times throughout his career—three lines radiating from this central figure, which was first seen in Crucifixion, 1933. Three Studies was painted over the course of two weeks in 1944, when, Bacon recalled, [...] "I was in a <b>bad</b> <b>mood</b> of drinking, and I did it under tremendous hangovers and drink; I sometimes hardly knew what I was doing.

500|$|Bacon {{said that}} chance played a {{significant}} role in his work, and that he often approached a canvas without having a clear idea of what might emerge.

The following morning he would often approach his canvas [...] "in a <b>bad</b> <b>mood</b> of drinking... under tremendous hangovers and drink; I sometimes hardly knew what I was doing." [...] He incorporated his appetite for chance into his work: an image often would morph midway through into something quite different from what he had first intended. He actively sought out this freedom and felt it crucial to his progression as an artist. To him, lifestyle and art were intertwined; he said that [...] "perhaps the drink helped me to be a bit freer." [...] This is very evident in the 1949 series, which began as a rather morbid study of a collapsed head, but evolved over the six surviving panels into a reworking of Velázquez masterpieces, and arrived at an image that was to preoccupy Bacon for the subsequent 20 years.|$|E

50|$|Mood {{can play}} an {{influential}} role in impression formation by affecting the way the primacy effect is used when making judgments. Being in a positive mood causes a person to process information in a holistic, all-inclusive fashion while being in a negative mood encourages more adaptive processing which accounts for each detail individually. Therefore, positive mood tends to increase the influence of early information while negative mood has the opposite effect. There is also evidence of a mood-congruent factor, where people in good moods form positive impressions and people in <b>bad</b> <b>moods</b> form negative impressions. This is most likely due to the selective priming of information associated with the current mood state, which causes mood-congruent biases in impression formation.|$|R

Metternich now struggled to enforce even the level of censorship he desired. Fortunately there were no major challenges to the regime from outside. Italy was quiet, and neither Metternich's attempt to lecture the new Prussian king Frederick William IV nor the boredom of the new British Queen Victoria at their first meeting posed immediate problems. Far more worrying was Tsar Nicholas, whose estimation of the Habsburg dynasty and Austria was low. After an impromptu tour of Italy in 1845 the Tsar unexpectedly stopped in Vienna. Already in a <b>bad</b> <b>mood,</b> he was an awkward guest, though in between criticisms of Austria he reassured Metternich that Russia was not about to invade the Ottoman Empire again. Two months later their countries were required to work together over the Galician slaughter and a declaration of independence from Kraków. Metternich authorised the occupation of the city and use of troops to restore order in surrounding areas, intent on undoing the pseudo-independence that had been granted Kraków in 1815. After months of negotiations with Prussia and Russia, Austria annexed the city in November 1846. Metternich regarded it as a personal victory, but it was an action of dubious utility: not only were Polish dissidents now officially part of Austria, the Europe-wide Polish dissident movement was now worked actively against the [...] "Metternich system" [...] that had overridden the rights enshrined in 1815. Britain and France appeared similarly outraged, although calls for Metternich's resignation were ignored. For the next two years Ferdinand could not abdicate in favour of his nephew without a regency; Metternich believed Austria would need him in the interim to hold government together.|$|E
