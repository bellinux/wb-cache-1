500|$|A 163-minute {{version of}} the film competed in the main {{competition}} of the 2009 Cannes Film Festival. The Cannes cut lacked much of the finished film's sound design, and some visual effects were not fully in place. Noé said about the version: [...] "the film was like a baby of three months. I took {{it out of my}} belly to show it, flattered by [...] Thierry Frémaux's invitation, but it was still in gestation. So I had to put it <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>my</b> belly, that is to say to tweak many details." ...|$|E
500|$|Swift solely penned [...] "Today Was a Fairytale" [...] in {{the summer}} of 2008 and stored it away for a while. After being cast as Felicia Miller on Valentine's Day, Swift offered the song to the film {{producers}} for the soundtrack as she did not believe it fit on her upcoming album. [...] "When this movie opportunity came about, I reached <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>my</b> pocket and thought, 'I think this is perfect for the soundtrack. I hope it's perfect for the soundtrack'", Swift told The Tennessean. [...] "Today Was a Fairytale" [...] was released as a single from the Valentine's Day soundtrack on January 22, 2010, exclusively through the iTunes Store. The single was re-released on February 15, 2011.|$|E
500|$|Anthony Zerbe {{originally}} {{auditioned for}} the role of Ru'afo, and was considered to be the best choice for it. However, the production team decided instead to cast him in the role of Admiral Matthew Dougherty. During Zerbe's audition, instead of reading the lines provided, he recited Dante's Inferno before seamlessly moving into the script. Frakes and the producers unanimously decided to award him the part of Dougherty. In the film's smaller roles, Stephanie Niznik played Ensign Kell Perim and Daniel Hugh Kelly appeared as Sojef. Gregg Henry appeared as Gallatin, and child actor Michael Welch played the Ba'ku child Artim. Michael Horton returned as the tactical officer he portrayed in First Contact; his character was called Lieutenant Daniels in this film. Rage Against the Machine and Audioslave guitarist Tom Morello played a Son'a warrior. Morello's make-up regimen began at 5am, at which time he said he would normally [...] "be crawling <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>my</b> coffin".|$|E
60|$|Thus far {{my pride}} had held me up. It {{sustained}} me no longer. I dropped <b>back</b> again <b>into</b> <b>my</b> chair, in undisguised dread {{of what was}} coming next.|$|R
60|$|I {{looked up}} and met the full liquid orbs of the Hon. Blanche Fitzroy Sackville, {{youngest}} daughter of the Lord Lieutenant. She blushed deeply. I turned pale and almost fainted. But the cold, sneering tones of a masculine voice sent the blood <b>back</b> again <b>into</b> <b>my</b> youthful cheek.|$|R
6000|$|... 'And at last I dreamt that I {{was walking}} over a bridge {{made of a}} whale's back, and the living bridge spoke to me and said: [...] "Here have I been {{stretched}} out these three years, and men and horses have trampled <b>my</b> <b>back</b> down <b>into</b> <b>my</b> ribs. Must I lie here much longer?"' ...|$|R
500|$|Her love of tattoos, however, gained media {{attention}} in May 2010, after Lavigne and Brody Jenner each got matching tattoos {{of the word}} [...] "fuck" [...] on their ribs. Lavigne appeared in the June/July cover story for Inked magazine, where she discussed and showed off her tattoos, including an [...] "Abbey Dawn" [...] on her left forearm and an [...] "XXV" [...] and star on her right. Although she confirmed the [...] "fuck" [...] tattoo verbally in the article (calling it her [...] "favorite word") she had it applied after the magazine's photo shoot. She added that she eventually {{wanted to get a}} [...] "big-ass heart with a flag through it with a name... I'm going to wait a few years and make sure I still want it then. I have to wait for that special someone to come <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>my</b> life." [...] In July 2010, Lavigne had her boyfriend's name, [...] "Brody", tattooed beneath her right breast. The couple announced that they broke up in January 2012.|$|E
500|$|Several {{videos were}} {{intended}} to demonstrate the album's central theme of [...] "finding the beauty in imperfection". While working on [...] "Flawless", Beyoncé was reminded of her loss on television competition Star Search as a child, which she saw as a defining moment in her career, and believed that the competition had {{taught her how to}} embrace imperfection in the future. The theme was represented in the videos by the recurring use of trophies, which the singer saw as referencing [...] "all of the sacrifice I have made as a kid, all of the time that I lost". It was also carried into how the visuals were created, with the videos for [...] "Drunk in Love", [...] "Yoncé", [...] "No Angel", [...] "XO" [...] and [...] "Blue" [...] shot without prior preparation, as the singer found enjoyment in the spontaneity of the filming locations and in resisting the urge to perfect them. Noting some of the visuals' explicit content and exposure of her body, Beyoncé said she found shooting them liberating and expressed her intention to demonstrate sexuality as a power that women should have, and not lose after becoming a mother. She went on to say, [...] "I know finding my sensuality, getting <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>my</b> body, being proud of growing up, it was important to me that I expressed that... I know {{that there are so many}} women who feel the same way".|$|E
2500|$|On Friday the Ninth of June in {{the present}} year, Mr. and Mrs. Boffin (in their {{manuscript}} dress of receiving Mr. and Mrs. Lammle at breakfast) were on the South-Eastern Railway with me, in a terribly destructive accident. When I had done what I could to help others, I climbed <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>my</b> carriage—nearly turned over a viaduct, and caught aslant upon the turn—to extricate the worthy couple. They were much soiled, but otherwise unhurt. [...] I remember with devout thankfulness that I can never be much nearer parting company with my readers for ever than I was then, until there shall be written against my life, the two words with which I have this day closed this book:—THE END.|$|E
6000|$|... "On the {{staircase}} he stopped suddenly, so that I very nearly blundered into him. He stood looking <b>back</b> right <b>into</b> <b>my</b> face and listening. 'I could have sworn,' he said. His long hairy hand pulled at his lower lip. His eye {{went up and}} down {{the staircase}}. Then he grunted and went on up again.|$|R
60|$|My beloved {{friends were}} alarmed--nay, they {{expressed}} their alarm so anxiously, that I dared not pronounce the word plague, that hovered on my lips, lest they should construe <b>my</b> perturbed looks <b>into</b> a symptom, and see infection in my languor. I had scarcely recovered, and with feigned hilarity had brought <b>back</b> smiles <b>into</b> <b>my</b> little circle, {{when we saw}} Ryland approach.|$|R
60|$|Then hurrying {{footsteps}} sounded {{through the}} house, and the swift {{opening and closing}} of doors; and I slipped <b>back</b> hastily <b>into</b> <b>my</b> knickerbockers and ran out. The women folk were gathered on the stairs, while my father stood in the hall, calling to them to be quiet. And still the wild ringing of the bell continued, and, above it, the hoarse, shrieking cry.|$|R
2500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Right Here (Departed)", Norwood's first {{collaboration}} with Canadian director Little X, was filmed on August 17, 2008 in Los Angeles, California. The {{concept of the}} video was chosen out of several different ideas. Norwood, who cited the [...] "realness" [...] of X's treatment as its strength, described the video about being there for a loved one. The concept depicts Norwood as an angel, who is [...] "crossing {{over to the other}} side and coming <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>my</b> family's life. Just popping up everywhere, just singing to them," [...] she said, also noting its I Am Legend feel. [...] "You can take it like you're talking about a mother and a daughter, a sister, brother, girlfriend, whatever — it's universal in that way [...] sometimes you see me on the street by myself completely, and it's pretty cool. I'm really excited about it [...]" ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{production}} of opening track [...] "Still Standing", {{one of the}} first songs written for the album, was tracked by the reality television show format Monica: The Single on Peachtree TV in 2008. A well-received anthem about empowerment, starting with [...] "an icy club-busting backbeat and a gothic, low-octave choir," [...] it features guest vocals by Monica's cousin Ludacris and was initially considered to be released as the album's first single, but J Records rejected to promote the song as Still Standing′s lead. Nevertheless, the track managed to debut within the top eighty on the US Billboard Hot R/Hip-Hop Songs chart and was used as the theme song of [...] the following year. Second track, Los Da Mystro-crafted [...] "One In a Lifetime", was among a number of songs that leaked a year prior to the album's official release. Announced as the album's leading single at a time, the [...] "lush, piano-laced" [...] song deals with finding true love. Ne-Yo-prenned third track [...] "Stay or Go", one out of several tracks the songwriter and Monica worked on over a course of a week, deals with a [...] "if you’re not going to treat me right, then here’s the option"–nature, according to Monica. [...] "He wanted to do a record that spoke to who I am," [...] she said, [...] "and he reached <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>my</b> history on how I’ve delivered records in a sassy yet vocal way." ...|$|E

50|$|Robert (Raleigh NC): Back back back back back, the WIR is not gone, but back! I was {{cruising}} up to {{a grocery}} store in Negativetown / Killadelphia in my Yugo {{in search of the}} perfect Bloody Mary. The store was packed with all kinds of crazy people. One guy {{was trying to figure out}} the difference between Cilantro and Parsley while others were buying box wine for their party at the stupid hotel and some were getting ready for their appearance on the Pulse. Just when everything seemed normal, I misremembered where I was; this was Killadelphia and nothing is normal there. About that time employees started running through the store with machine guns attacking each other. I started telling bad knock knock jokes to try and calm people down, but it didn't work. I told them about my man crush on Will Ferrell, that didn't work either. I even offered them my Spice Girl tickets. Nothing. I ran back out to my car in 18.6 seconds and the worst thing possible had happened. Some stupid valet had <b>backed</b> <b>into</b> <b>my</b> bumper. My bumper was destroyed. I didn't even get my Bloody Mary mix. Now my pride, like my bumper, was destroyed. Then I realized it was February 31, therefore, none of this happened. The WIR did not like hibernation and is glad to be back.|$|R
6000|$|So we {{went off}} together, Mrs Bowater and I, {{in the cool}} of the evening about half an hour after sunset--she, alas, a little ruffled because I had refused to change <b>back</b> again <b>into</b> <b>my</b> Monnerie finery. [...] "But Mrs Bowater, imagine such a thing in a real wild garden!" [...] I protested, but without mollifying her, and without further explaining--how could I do that?--that the gown which Miss Sentimentality (or Miss Coquette) was {{actually}} wearing was that in which she had first met Mr Anon.|$|R
5000|$|Donovan told auspOp: “It {{has been}} 10 years since I {{released}} my first independent EP Eye 2 Eye and I am {{so excited to}} be able to share this with the Australian public. I can’t wait for people to hear what I’ve been working on in the studio. It has been a long while coming. After finishing up with We Will Rock You late last year it dawned upon me that I really wanted to get <b>back</b> <b>into</b> writing <b>my</b> own music and I really wanted to make that my main focus.” ...|$|R
60|$|I {{looked at}} him, {{and then of}} a sudden his name flashed <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>my</b> mind. I took his hand.|$|E
60|$|He {{declared}} {{that he would do}} nothing of the sort--and tried to force my documents <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>my</b> own possession.|$|E
60|$|I slipped <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>my</b> sleeping-bag, with a keen {{consciousness}} of its nature, and carefully pulled the flap in place, which almost hermetically sealed me up.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why I was up {{that river}} {{only a few}} hours ago!' cried the tunny; 'and as I was coming <b>back</b> {{something}} fell <b>into</b> <b>my</b> ear, and there it is still, for I went to sleep, when I got home and forgot all about it. Perhaps it may be what you want.' And stretching up his tail he whisked out the stone.|$|R
60|$|He {{seemed about}} to say something, but changed his mind. He left me without another word. I stepped <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the sitting-room. <b>My</b> father, with an empty tumbler in his hand, was {{crouched}} forward over the table, breathing heavily. My stepmother, with marble 'face and hard set eyes, was leaning forward in her chair, looking into the dying fire. She scarcely glanced at me as I entered.|$|R
60|$|After I {{came back}} from our three months' trip on the continent, with my health greatly restored, my spirits rose proportionately; and as I had nothing to throw me <b>back</b> again <b>into</b> <b>my</b> old state, with the {{exception}} of the shock I received at the news of Angela Harmer's death, I really began to look at things in a more hopeful way, and to think that the eight years--no, the seven years and a half--I was getting very particular as to dates--which were to elapse before Percy started on his return from India, were not such a hopelessly long time to look forward to after all.|$|R
6000|$|... "Take {{the arrow}} {{out of his}} eye, Wolfgang," [...] said Otto, without looking at the bird: [...] "wipe {{it and put it}} <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>my</b> quiver." ...|$|E
60|$|THE NEWLY BORN. What {{has that}} to do with it? I love you; and I must have you or I will go <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>my</b> shell again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Let no man stir," [...] said Cetewayo, {{and they}} stood {{as though they}} were rooted to the ground, while I slipped my pistol <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>my</b> pocket.|$|E
60|$|We are {{the oddest}} creatures, little son, beasts and barbarians and brains, neither one nor the other but all confusedly, {{and here was}} I who had given up Mary and {{resigned}} her and freed myself from her as I thought altogether, cast <b>back</b> again <b>into</b> <b>my</b> old pit by the most obvious and necessary consequence of her surrender and mine. And it's just there and in that relation that we {{men and women are}} so elaborately insecure. We try to love as equals and behave as equals and concede a level freedom, and then comes a crisis,--our laboriously contrived edifice of liberty collapses and we perceive that so far as sex goes the woman remains to the man no more than a possession--capable of loyalty or treachery.|$|R
2500|$|In October 2009, BBC Radio 6 Music {{announced}} Cocker {{was set to}} {{take over}} the Sunday afternoon slot from 10 January 2010 onwards, with Jarvis Cocker's Sunday Service. He was quoted as saying [...] "Sunday doesn't feel that different to the other days of the week any more. Although there was something weird about when everything seemed to stop on a Sunday, it kind of marked out the week. I am going to put the boringness <b>back</b> <b>into</b> Sunday. That's <b>my</b> mission." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Warren laughed, and he {{took the}} flute from my hand, and began to examine it. I now trembled for the incognito! The {{instrument}} had been mine for many years, and was a very capital one, with silver keys, stops, and ornaments. What if Patt--what if my dear grandmother should recognise it! I would have given the handsomest trinket in my uncle's collection to get the flute <b>back</b> again <b>into</b> <b>my</b> own hands; but, before an opportunity offered for that, it went from hand to hand, as the instrument that had produced the charming sounds heard that morning, until it reached those of Martha. The dear girl was thinking of the jewelry, which, it will be remembered, was rich, and intended in part for herself, and she passed the instrument on, saying, hurriedly,-- ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was then}} that the memory of Ramiro del' Orca, and the look that in his eyes I had {{surprised}} whilst Madonna drank, flashed <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>my</b> mind.|$|E
60|$|Sadly I {{dropped them}} <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>my</b> pocket, sadly we yearned toward the blessed stove and the arm-chairs, and sadly {{we went out}} the door into the frosty night.|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{wanted my}} purse to look at," [...] said Clarence hurriedly, [...] "and that's how the thing happened. Somebody put HIS OWN MONEY <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>MY</b> purse by accident." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was not to}} be done. After a {{banishment}} of years, Mary had got <b>back</b> again <b>into</b> <b>my</b> mind. I {{sat down}} once more on the river bank. The sun was sinking fast. Black shadows hovered under the arches of the old stone bridge. The red light had faded from the swift-flowing water, and had left it overspread with one monotonous hue of steely gray. The first stars looked down peacefully from the cloudless sky. The first shiverings of the night breeze were audible among the trees, and visible here and there in the shallow places of the stream. And still, the darker it grew, the more persistently my portrait led me back to the past, the more vividly the long-lost image of the child Mary showed itself to me in my thoughts.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first volume}} of his planned 3-part {{autobiography}} has recently been published (Quartet Books, April 2013). <b>Backing</b> <b>into</b> Light: <b>My</b> Father's Son {{tells the story of}} the first 3 decades of his eventful life through his wartime boyhood dominated by his raucous, womanising but irrepressible father, to his first successes in the 50s and 60s as an artist, novelist and playwright. They were years which saw ardent affairs with both women and men, a stormy marriage, the birth of a son, and a traumatic divorce. The book has been described as “full of clear-eyed observation and thoughtful reflection, as well as comic incident … unflinchingly honest and exuberantly entertaining,” while The Spectator finds it “a remarkable autobiography which subverts everything you thought you knew about love and life.” ...|$|R
6000|$|Tarzan laughed. [...] "Run <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the sunlight, <b>my</b> children," [...] he said. [...] "I {{will join}} you when I have searched this old ruin {{from top to}} bottom, and found the gold, or found that there is none. At least we may take the tablets from the walls, though the pillars are too heavy for us to handle; but there should be great storerooms filled with gold--gold that we can carry away upon our backs with ease. Run on now, out into the fresh air where you may breathe easier." ...|$|R
