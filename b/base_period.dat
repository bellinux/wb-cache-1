40|$|Measures of {{long term}} trends in world export prices of {{manufactured}} goods {{and in the}} terms of trade between manufactured goods and primary products are sensitive to the choice of country weights and of <b>base</b> <b>periods</b> and, most important of all, the treatment of quality change. Later <b>base</b> <b>periods</b> and higher weights for rapidly growing exporters, such as Japan or the newly industrializing East Asian countries, are associated with lower estimates of the long-term increase in prices. Conservative estimates of the bias in the most commonly used measure of export prices of manufactured products, the United Nations export unit value index for manufactures, suggest that this measure overstates the long-run rise in manufactured goods prices by more than half of one per cent per year, probably one per cent or more. If this is the case, there has been no long term trend toward rising prices of manufactures relative to primary products. However, no conceivable estimate of bias in measures of manufactured goods prices would reverse the picture of declining relative primary product prices during the 1980 s. ...|$|R
25|$|As can be {{seen from}} the {{definitions}} above, if one already has price and quantity data (or, alternatively, price and expenditure data) for the <b>base</b> <b>period,</b> then calculating the Laspeyres index for a new period requires only new price data. In contrast, calculating many other indices (e.g., the Paasche index) for a new period requires both new price data and new quantity data (or, alternatively, both new price data and new expenditure data) for each new period. Collecting only new price data is often easier than collecting both new price data and new quantity data, so calculating the Laspeyres index for a new period tends to require less time and effort than calculating these other indices for a new period.|$|E

25|$|In 1980, a year {{of strong}} {{economic}} activity and robust competition in the grocery market, prices in Houston's grocery stores were {{below the national average}} prices in grocery stores. Houston's grocery price index averaged at 85.6, below the national average of 88.4. This means that, for the 1982-1984 <b>base</b> <b>period,</b> Houstonians paid $88.40 for an amount of food that would cost $100 according to the national average. During the oil bust and the economic decline, Houston's prices stayed even with the national average. In 1983 Houston's grocery index increased from 96.8 to 99.4 and matched the national average of 99.1. As the city began to recover, the prices began to edge upward. When a recession in the U.S. began and while Houston's economic growth slowed and continued, the national price index fell below Houston's price index. As of 1992 prices in Houston's grocery stores were higher than the national average; Houston's index averaged to be 137.3, and the national average was 132.3.|$|E

25|$|In {{the period}} 1960-2010 average {{precipitation}} in the Upper Barada basin {{has remained the}} same. While the yield of the Fijeh springs has declined from an annual average of 9.5m3/second in 1967-71 to 5.5 m3/second in 1996-2000, {{this is due to}} pumping from the aquifer in the immediate vicinity of the springs that was begun in 1981 in order to supply more water to Damascus during the dry season.

Hydrological and meteorological data are considered a state secret in Syria, so that data are only indirectly available. According {{to a study by the}} Karlsruhe Institute of Technology conducted in 2010 and financed by German development cooperation funds, the yield of the Fijeh springs during the critical low-flow period from July to December is projected to decline by about 5% in the period 2021-2050 compared to the historical average during 1962-1991.
