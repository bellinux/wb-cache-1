5|$|Much {{uncertainty}} remains, especially {{regarding the}} size of limitanei regiments, {{as can be seen}} by the wide ranges of the size estimates. It is also possible, if not likely, that unit strengths changed {{over the course of the}} 4th century. For example, it appears that Valentinian I split about 150 comitatus units with his brother and co-emperor Valens. The resulting units may have <b>been</b> <b>just</b> half the strength of the parent units (unless a major recruitment drive was held to bring them all up to original strength).|$|E

5|$|Federer {{defeated}} Murray in {{four sets}} {{in three hours}} and 44 minutes, to capture a record equalling seventh Wimbledon championship, and a record breaking seventeenth Major title. The victory was also historic as it caused Federer to depose Djokovic as world No. 1 and break Sampras' record of 286 weeks at the summit of men's tennis (Federer had <b>been</b> <b>just</b> one week short when he lost the number one ranking in June 2010).

5|$|Francis Penny Burnage, {{son-in-law}} of Charles, became {{chairman of}} Charles Churchill & Co, and Gabriel {{continued to work}} for that company. They moved quickly to add manufacturing capacity to what would otherwise have <b>been</b> <b>just</b> a sales organisation: in December 1934 the company took over Cornelius Redman & Sons, renaming it Churchill-Redman Ltd. The facility was used initially to manufacture American machine tools under licence, rather as the machine tool company had started out in the early 1900s. A particularly notable example of its output was the licence granted in 1937 by Jones & Lamson of Springfield, Vermont, for the Fay automatic lathe. It {{was to become a}} pattern for Gabriel to orchestrate take-overs of other companies but not subsume them: they would have their own management team and retain a separate corporate identity.|$|E

5|$|ZANU-PF won a {{landslide}} victory, with 61% {{of the presidential}} vote and over two-thirds of parliamentary seats. The elections were not considered free and fair; there were widespread stories of vote rigging and many voters may have been fearful of the violence that had surrounded the 2008 election. During the campaign, many MDC supporters had remained quiet about their views {{out of fear of}} reprisals. The MDC was also negatively impacted by its time in coalition government, with perceptions that it had <b>been</b> <b>just</b> as corrupt as ZANU-PF. ZANU-PF had also capitalised on its appeals to African race, land, and liberation, while the MDC was often associated with white farmers, Western nations, and perceived Western values such as LGBT rights.|$|E
5|$|The {{first state}} {{trunkline}} highway designated {{along the path}} of the modern US41 was M-15, in use as far back as 1919. The 1925 draft plan for the establishment of the US Highway System would have replaced M-15 with three different US Highways. Between Menominee and Powers, M-15 was to follow the route that US41 follows today. East of Powers to Rapid River, the trunkline would have <b>been</b> <b>just</b> US2. The next segment between Rapid River and Covington was planned as US102 while the remainder north to Copper Harbor was planned as US41. In between Powers and Covington, US41 was planned to follow US2 west to Iron Mountain and then route of the modern US141 between Powers and Covington. When the system was created on November 11, 1926, US41 was the only US Highway routed along the alignment of M-15. The original map showed US41 following an unbuilt alignment between Powers and Marquette. The new US41 designation was instead routed to follow the former M-15.|$|E
5|$|The {{migration}} {{of the outer}} planets is also necessary {{to account for the}} existence and properties of the Solar System's outermost regions. Beyond Neptune, the Solar System continues into the Kuiper belt, the scattered disc, and the Oort cloud, three sparse populations of small icy bodies thought to be the points of origin for most observed comets. At their distance from the Sun, accretion was too slow to allow planets to form before the solar nebula dispersed, and thus the initial disc lacked enough mass density to consolidate into a planet. The Kuiper belt lies between 30 and 55AU from the Sun, while the farther scattered disc extends to over 100AU, and the distant Oort cloud begins at about 50,000AU. Originally, however, the Kuiper belt was much denser and closer to the Sun, with an outer edge at approximately 30AU. Its inner edge would have <b>been</b> <b>just</b> beyond the orbits of Uranus and Neptune, which were in turn far closer to the Sun when they formed (most likely in the range of 15–20AU), and in 50% of simulations ended up opposite locations, with Uranus farther from the Sun than Neptune.|$|E

This result will be used to show that a finitely generated pro-p group G <b>is</b> <b>just</b> infinite if and only if G has no non-trivial finite normal subgroups and Φ(G) has a just infinite open subgroup...|$|R
