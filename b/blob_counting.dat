40|$|In this paper, {{the results}} of a pilot project carried out to {{estimate}} the speeds of moving vehicles from video sequences are presented. The software pre-processes video images using gray scale and median filters. To extract moving vehicles from a traffic scene, the difference between three consecutive video frames were taken and filtered through an edge detection filter. <b>Blob</b> <b>counting</b> technique was applied to identify the position and size of the moving vehicles in the images. To estimate the trajectories of moving vehicles, the predicted area technique was applied to the blobs. Preliminary tests carried out on local roads show that the individual vehicular speeds can be estimated to an accuracy of better than � 3 km/h. 1...|$|E
40|$|BioNanoLab is {{a project}} aimed towards {{developing}} a prototype for a system capableof fast and sensitive detection of biological warfare agents. One of the important partsin the project is image acquisition and processing. My task was to evaluate andimprove these methods. The {{first step was to}} choose a machine vision library to useand then to write a program for acquiring images from line scan cameras to disctrough frame grabbers and to write code for processing the images. The two different machine vision libraries I tested were Sapera Essential andCommon vision blox (CVB). Sapera Essential is a machine vision library from Dalsa. Itis platform dependent as it only works for Dalsa hardware. CVB on the other hand isa hardware independent machine vision library from Stemmer imaging. The run times for the two libraries were almost the same but Sapera Essential waschosen as the winner because we wanted the more low level control which Saperaoffers, as it is written specifically for the hardware we used. Another reason was thatthe <b>blob</b> <b>counting</b> for CVB started to miscount some times...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to propose a SIMULINK MODEL to detect moving vehicles. Background subtraction is the technique used in this algorithm. Based on the retrieved information, automatic traffic surveillance can be done. Initially, a recorded video is given directly to the blocks. The main logic is then implemented using various Embedded MATLAB blocks using individual algorithms. The algorithm takes into consideration three main techniques namely Background Subtraction, Edge Detection and Shadow Detection. Background Subtraction block is sub-divided into Selective and Non-selective parts to improve the sensitivity and give accurate background. Edge detection helps to detect the exact boundaries of moving vehicles. This is followed by the shadow detection block that removes the falsely detected pixels that are generated due to shadow of the vehicle. By analyzing the output of the blocks discussed above, the final mask is generated. The mask along with the input frame processed to give the final video output with the detected object. Furthermore, using a Blob analysis block, parameters such as number of blobs per frame (vehicles) and the area of blobs can be used directly for traffic surveillance. Finally a <b>Blob</b> <b>counting</b> block is used to count and display the total number of cars...|$|E

When integrated into an image recognition system or human-computer interaction interface, connected component labeling can operate {{on a variety of}} information. [...] Blob extraction is generally performed on the resulting binary image from a thresholding step. <b>Blobs</b> may be <b>counted,</b> filtered, and tracked.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an approach to}} count mango fruit from daytime images of individual trees {{for the purpose of}} a machine vision based estimation of mango crop yield. Images of mango trees were acquired over a three day period, three weeks before commercial harvest occurred. The fruit load of each of fifteen trees was manually counted, and these trees were imaged on four sides. Correlation between tree counts and manual image counts was strong (R 2 = 0. 91 for two sides). A further 555 trees were imaged on one side only. For these images, pixels were segmented into fruit and background pixels using colour segmentation in the RGB and YCbCr colour ranges and a texture segmentation based on adjacent pixel variability. Resultant <b>blobs</b> were <b>counted</b> to obtain a per image mango count. Across a set of 555 images (with mean + standard deviation of fruit per tree of 32. 3 + 14. 3), a linear regression, (y = 0. 582 x – 0. 20, R 2 = 0. 74, bias adjusted root mean square error of prediction = 7. 7) was achieved on the machine vision count relative to the image count. The algorithm decreased in effectiveness as the number of fruit on the tree increased, and when imaging conditions involved direct sunlight. Approaches to reduce the impact of fruit load and lighting conditions are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{next wave}} of micro and nano devices will create a world with trillions of small {{networked}} cameras. This will lead to increased concerns about privacy and secu-rity. Most privacy preserving algorithms for computer vi-sion are applied after image/video data has been captured. We propose to use privacy preserving optics that filter or block sensitive information directly from the incident light-field before sensor measurements are made, adding a new layer of privacy. In addition to balancing the privacy and utility of the captured data, we address trade-offs unique to miniature vision sensors, such as achieving high-quality field-of-view and resolution within the constraints of mass and volume. Our privacy preserving optics enable appli-cations such as depth sensing, full-body motion tracking, people <b>counting,</b> <b>blob</b> detection and privacy preserving face recognition. While we demonstrate applications on macro-scale devices (smartphones, webcams, etc.) our theory has impact for smaller devices. 1...|$|R
40|$|APeC is a video {{monitoring}} {{system that is}} used to count the number of people passing through a monitored area. A single camera is placed directly above the door to get the clear top view of the people passing with minimum of occlusion. Frames are extracted from video and the pixels of each frame are submitted to a Self-Organizing Map for classification as head or non-head. Connected component analysis is performed on the classified pixels to cluster them into different regions then size constraints are imposed on the regions to eliminate noise. The coordinates of each blob’s centroid are computed to identify its location and to which region the blob belongs (top, middle, or bottom). The Euclidean distance between blobs from the current and previous frames is then computed. A blob from the previous frame will be matched with another blob from the current frame if they have minimum Euclidean distance. Matching blobs represent the same person present in those frames. A particular <b>blob</b> will be <b>counted</b> if and only if it has passed through the three regions consecutively. Experiments show that our system is relatively robust even when there are shadows in the video. 1...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose an {{algorithm}} for counting moving objects in outdoor environments. Similar to other approaches the proposed algorithm uses a traditional surveillance system approach: background subtraction followed by noise removing, tracking and object labeling. The novelty of the proposed algorithm is that each processing step uses a stereo camera. In fact, the algorithms use both rectied and depth images obtained with a stereo camera. Moving objects are extracted from the scene using a novel background subtraction approach. In outdoor environment the images can be degraded by noise. We considered two types of noise, namely periodic movements due to {{the wind and the}} cast shadow. In this paper novel algorithms for detecting these types of noise are proposed. Using them, the noisy pixels are removed. The resulting segmented pixels are grouped together by clustering connected regions and then tracked during their movements. The obtained blobs, which correspond to the moving objects, are thus obtained with high accuracy. The nal part of the algorithm is blob classication, which identies the moving objects. The knowledge of the moving objects can be used to build more complex counting applications than that based on just <b>counting</b> <b>blobs.</b> Two simple applications based on the proposed algorithm are worked out and discussed in this paper, namely one that counts the people moving on the left and on the right of the video scene and one that counts the cars moving in the same way...|$|R
