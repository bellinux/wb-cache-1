In December 1986, a commission that reviewed the foster care system recommended that sexual orientation could not be used to disqualify foster parents. As Dukakis delayed accepting that recommendation, advocates for gay and lesbian rights threatened protests against his presidential campaign. The ban on gay foster parents was enacted into law in the 1989 budget. After a lawsuit challenging the ban was settled out of court, the Dukakis administration withdrew the policy in April 1990. In the 1990s, court decisions further expanded the parenting rights of gays and lesbians. In September 1993, the state's highest court ruled that state law allowed for second-parent adoption by a parent of the same sex as a <b>biological</b> <b>parent.</b> In July 1999, the same court awarded visitation rights to each of two mothers after their separation.|$|E

This study has a qualitative approach and contains eight semi-structured interviews with foster parents and social workers in a smaller town in the south of Sweden. Seven foster parents from four foster homes and four social workers were interviewed. As analytical method we have used a qualitative thematic analysis and then the results have been analyzed by the theoretical approach of street-level bureaucracy and its discretion. Theories regarding the relationship between clients and social workers have also been used.   The result demonstrates that social workers perceptions of the relationship between foster parents and the foster child’s <b>biological</b> <b>parents</b> are that the relationship should be remained because the interaction between them is necessary for the child. Concerning possible conflicts that may appear, between foster parents and the child’s <b>biological</b> <b>parents,</b> social workers see as solvable. Foster parents on the other hand emphasize the difficulties in their relationship with the foster child’s <b>biological</b> <b>parents.</b> They also think that they have no exchange of having contact with the child’s <b>biological</b> <b>parents</b> but say that they still have it for the child’s sake. Regarding the support provided to the foster parents in their relationship with the child’s <b>biological</b> <b>parents,</b> the foster parents states that they need a close relationship to the social worker to feel supported. However they argue that a frequent change of social workers prevents them from being able to have a close relationship with their social worker. Social workers say that the support to the foster parents is limited by time constraints and high workload. Instead they underline the importance of providing training as a part of the support to the foster parents in their relationship with the child’s <b>biological</b> <b>parents.</b> ...|$|R
