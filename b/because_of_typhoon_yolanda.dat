40|$|The IBTRACS world {{database}} of tropical cyclone(TC) tracks was analysed to determine potential historical trends in TC characteristics {{for the west}} Pacific basin. Trends are then related to the characteristics <b>of</b> <b>Typhoon</b> <b>Yolanda</b> {{to see if this}} individual event constitutes as a data outlier or is part of a trend that can be related to climate change. In terms of TC frequency, it is deduced that there is a decreasing pattern in tropical cyclone formation starting in 1970. It is also noted that while there is no trend observed in the annual mean maximum wind speed, a {{decrease in the number of}} high wind speed TCs is measured for the months of November and December. The location of TC formation has also been changing towards a higher latitude but closer to the Philippines in terms <b>of</b> longitude. Lastly, <b>typhoons</b> making landfall in the Visayas and Mindanao region have also become slightly more frequent in the last decade. Except for the last f inding, the 2013 typhoon season does not fit in these general trends. This year may be the start of a new trend or shift in TC characteristics (which we will only know after a few more years) but is most likely part of the inherent annual variability <b>of</b> <b>typhoon</b> characteristics. <b>Yolanda</b> goes against perceived trends but its occurrence signifies that there is still much to learn about tropical cyclones and the impending impacts of climate change in general...|$|R
