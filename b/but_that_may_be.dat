5|$|The battle {{began at}} about 9am on 14 October and lasted all day, but while a broad outline is known, the exact events are {{obscured}} by contradictory accounts in the sources. Although {{the numbers on}} each side were about equal, William had both cavalry and infantry, including many archers, while Harold had only foot soldiers and few, if any, archers. The English soldiers formed up as a shield wall along the ridge and were at first so effective that William's army was thrown back with heavy casualties. Some of William's Breton troops panicked and fled, {{and some of the}} English troops appear to have pursued the fleeing Bretons until they themselves were attacked and destroyed by Norman cavalry. During the Bretons' flight, rumours swept through the Norman forces that the duke had been killed, but William succeeded in rallying his troops. Two further Norman retreats were feigned, to once again draw the English into pursuit and expose them to repeated attacks by the Norman cavalry. The available sources are more confused about events in the afternoon, but it appears that the decisive event was Harold's death, about which differing stories are told. William of Jumièges claimed that Harold was killed by the duke. The Bayeux Tapestry has been claimed to show Harold's death by an arrow to the eye, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> a later reworking of the tapestry to conform to 12th-century stories in which Harold was slain by an arrow wound to the head.|$|E

Before the 2008 election of Barack Obama, county voters had not supported a Democrat for President since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964.|$|E

500|$|Thomas Sotinel of Le Monde {{started his}} review by recalling the {{irritation}} the film caused upon its world premiere in Cannes, and compared the cut {{he had seen}} there to the final version: [...] "In all honesty, the difference does not jump to my eyes. Of course, the film seems more consistent, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> because we've already traveled this maze once. While leaving, we might remain calmer, but still amazed by the mixture of exuberant invention and puerility." [...] A positive review came from L'Express, written by Laurent Djian, who compared the film to 2001: A Space Odyssey. He applauded how he found the strobe lights hypnotising {{in a way that}} influenced the perception of time. [...] "In 2010, no other filmmaker [...] than Gaspar Noé can shoot with such mastery, nor draw us into a vortex of sensations as vertiginous." [...] Ouest-Frances critic, on the other hand, was immensely bored by the film, and called it [...] "a padding of simple ideas, stereotypes and cliches in a heap of contrived and vain images which think they're technical prowess. Soporific cinema." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{confession}} {{has been}} received with incredulity, {{and many of}} the facts surrounding his mysterious disappearance from Thailand, including the release of the video three months after him vanishing, have been called into question. The president of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong, Jasper Tsang, said: [...] "the China Central Television (CCTV) report [...] {{did not seem to be}} able to calm the public. As the case drags on, there will be more speculation". Human Rights Watch was quoted in the Wall Street Journal saying: [...] "Given that Gui has been held nearly three months incommunicado, in a secret location, and without a lawyer, his confession on state-controlled TV lacks credibility." [...] The Washington Post said: [...] "The narrative seems messy and incoherent, blending possible fact with what seems like outright fiction. It feels illogical, absurd even. <b>But</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> the point. Televised confessions don't tend to trade in logic, or truth. They trade in fear." [...] Following China Central Television's release of videotaped confessions from Gui Minhai – and of Swedish NGO staffer Peter Dahlin, Reporters Without Borders condemned China's [...] "dissemination of forced 'confessions' that have no informational value". The organisation urged the EU to sanction CCTV and Xinhua for [...] "knowingly peddling lies and statements presumably obtained under duress". Hong Kong's chief executive said that he was unable to act as [...] "the Gui Minhai case has not been reported to the Hong Kong police or the government".|$|E
2500|$|Already {{known as}} 'the crack {{forward of the}} Clapham Rovers', his joining the Castle Blues was welcomed {{in the words of}} a {{football}} commentator writing in The Wellington Journal and Shrewsbury News: [...] "To any of my readers who would wish to see football, I would give the advice, 'See him play'. Some may perhaps consider his play a little selfish and that he does not pass enough, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> when he has not players by his side on whom he can depend, or who are anything of his own calibre." ...|$|E

2500|$|A London v Surrey {{match on}} 31 August 1730 {{took place at}} the Artillery Ground in Bunhill Fields, Finsbury, London. London won by 6 runs. It is the {{earliest}} definite match at the venue which was referred to in contemporary reports as the [...] "old" [...] Artillery Ground, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> because it was used frequently for other forms of sport or entertainment. It was generally used for matches involving the original London Club and also became the featured venue of all London cricket until about 1765, after which the focus shifted to Hambledon. Matches were recorded at the Artillery Ground until as late as 1778 but by then the London Club had disbanded, although its members continued their social and organisational existences and maintained their influence over the game as a whole.|$|E
2500|$|The {{popular press}} {{had a field}} day with the story, {{employing}} crude racial stereotypes and presenting Chang as the head of an international drugs operation that recruited unwitting girls to act as agents, got them to smuggle drugs from Paris to London in their underwear, and organised wild orgies. The American press dubbed Chang the [...] "Limehouse Spider" [...] and depicted him at the centre of a web of his unfortunate victims together with a half-length portrait that bore no resemblance to Chang. The image was repeated in coverage across the U.S. The Payne case, however, was the only offence for which Chang was convicted in Britain. There was a fall in the number of drug convictions in Britain in the years following Chang's jailing, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> attributable to increased police activity following national publicity about the issue. It seems most likely that Chang's operation was limited to supplying young women he met in London, and that he was not the international Drug King that he was made out to be.|$|E
