25|$|In {{nearly every}} story, Wolfe solves the mystery by {{considering}} the facts brought to him by Archie and others, and the replies to questions he himself asks of suspects. Wolfe ponders with his eyes closed, leaning <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair,</b> breathing deeply and steadily, and pushing his lips in and out. Archie says that during these trances Wolfe reacts to nothing {{that is going on}} around him. Archie seldom interrupts Wolfe's thought processes, he says, largely because it is the only time that he can be sure that Wolfe is working.|$|E
500|$|... "The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace" [...] {{was written}} by John Swartzwelder, who had {{a deal with the}} {{producers}} of the show to write five scripts for season ten. Although {{he was the one who}} wrote the episode, Dan Greaney was the one who came up with the idea for it. Greaney based Homer's intense obsession with Edison on the fact that when he himself would have an obsession with something in life, he would badger and bore people with details of it. [...] "Homer's relationship to Thomas Edison's achievements is a version of my own experience of trying to communicate the experience of things you love by driving people crazy," [...] Greaney said in a DVD audio commentary for the episode. The untippable chair was also an idea of Greaney's; while working on the episode, he was leaning <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> and fell backwards. He casually said it would be great if there were legs on the back of the chair and someone in the writing room said that would be a great invention for Homer. Soon after coming up with the story, Greaney told it to Swartzwelder so that he could turn it into a script. Greaney said [...] "it couldn't in my best dreams have turned out as good as it did if I had written it." ...|$|E
