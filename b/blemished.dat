5|$|The eggs of Lepidoptera {{are usually}} rounded and small (1mm) {{though they may}} be as large as 4mm in the case of Sphingidae and Saturniidae. They are {{generally}} quite plain in colour, white, pale green, bluish-green, or brown. Butterfly and moth eggs come in various shapes; some are spherical, others hemispherical, conical, cylindrical or lenticular (lens-shaped). Some are barrel-shaped or pancake-shaped, while others are turban or cheese-shaped. They may be angled or depressed at both ends, ridged or ornamented, spotted or <b>blemished.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{forms of}} the glyphs are {{standardized}} contours of living organisms and geometric designs about one centimeter high. The wooden tablets are irregular in shape and, in many instances, fluted (tablets B, E, G, H, O, Q, and possibly T), with the glyphs carved in shallow channels running {{the length of the}} tablets, {{as can be seen in}} the image of tablet G at right. It is thought that irregular and often <b>blemished</b> pieces of wood were used in their entirety rather than squared off due to the scarcity of wood on the island.|$|E

40|$|Visible facial <b>blemishes</b> can be {{annoying}} {{and embarrassing}} {{in our daily}} lives. This is particularly true when <b>blemishes</b> are permanently captured on video. For film and broadcast production, <b>blemishes</b> on actors/actresses may not be acceptable and must often be removed by post-production processing. Such processing can be incredibly slow and tedious, requiring a digital artist to "retouch" the video footage frame-by-frame. For amateur video editing, this manual processing is impractical with existing tools. This thesis presents a unique framework, referred to as Video Cosmetics (VC), designed to remove unwanted <b>blemishes</b> from video footage with minimal user assistance. Using the VC framework a user needs only to specify the <b>blemish</b> in an initial frame; the system then automatically tracks and removes the <b>blemishes</b> from subsequent frames. This task is accomplished by combining feature tracking, pixel classification, and temporally coherent image inpainting into a single processing framework. The result is an efficient post-production tool that substantially reduces {{the amount of time}} and effort needed to remove <b>blemishes</b> from video footage...|$|R

However, charges of alleged massive corruption or misuse of funds <b>blemished</b> the resulting programs and various projects, {{one of which was}} the Centennial Expo and Amphitheater at the former Clark Air Base in Angeles City, Pampanga, supposedly Ramos' pet project. The commemorative projects, particularly those undertaken at Clark, were hounded by illegal electioneering and corruption controversies even years after the Centennial celebrations.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to Cuvier and Blumenbach, Samuel Thomas von Soemmering interpreted Collini's fossil as a mammal. Specifically, he interpreted {{it as an}} unusual bat, which morphologically linked mammals with birds. He named this strange creature Ornithocephalus. Soemmering may have interpreted this series of forms in an evolutionary sense, following the early evolutionary ideas of Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck. Soemmering's analysis of the specimen was <b>blemished</b> by anatomical errors, like the misidentifications of bones. Soemmering agreed with Cuvier that the creature was a flying insectivore, however. Soemmering argued that pterosaurs walked on all fours like bats when on the ground. His advocacy for this interpretation of pterosaur terrestrial gait has been regarded {{as the beginning of}} a multi-century debate on the subject.|$|E

Additionally, the Sooners won 14 straight conference titles from 1946 to 1959, one under Jim Tatum and 13 under Wilkinson. The Sooners also went undefeated in conference play from November 23, 1946 to October 31, 1959; their record was only <b>blemished</b> by two ties.|$|E

25|$|While {{scholars}} {{have discovered a}} fair amount of information about how Irish Kingship worked, relatively little is actually related by early Irish laws. In particular, very little material survives regarding succession practices, which have been reconstructed as the system of Tanistry. A section of the Senchas Már tract on status was apparently devoted to succession, although little survives. Most early material on succession was collected by Domnal O'Davoren in the 16th century. Another seemingly important omission is that the laws never mention the High King of Ireland centred at Tara. Likewise, the laws only once mention the practice of individuals being ineligible for kingship if they are <b>blemished</b> (a practice more widely evident elsewhere, especially in Irish mythology). However, that mention is only incidental to a regulation on the compensation for bee stings when the legal tract Bechbretha relates the story of Congal Cáech, who was deposed on account of being blinded by a bee.|$|E
500|$|Another view {{does not}} regard the panchakanya as ideal women {{who should be}} emulated. Bhattacharya, author of Panch-Kanya: The Five Virgins of Indian Epics {{contrasts}} the panchakanya with the five satis enlisted in another traditional prayer: Sati, Sita, Savitri, Damayanti and Arundhati. He rhetorically asks, [...] "Are then Ahalya, Draupadi, Kunti, Tara, and Mandodari not chaste wives because each has 'known' a man, or more than one, other than her husband?" [...] Because they exhibited sexual behaviours that were non-ideal and even unethical according to traditional norms, Indian social reformer Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay was perplexed by the inclusion of Ahalya and Tara in the panchakanya. Although Ahalya's transgression <b>blemished</b> her and denied her the high status and reverence accorded to women like Sita and Savitri, this action made her immortal in legend.|$|E
500|$|After Vrana had {{returned}} to the castle, a pasha was chosen to have a conference with Vrana bringing him many rich presents. The pasha tried to convince the count that Murad would be a more suitable master than Skanderbeg was, and that the siege was almost over, but Vrana refused to surrender. As a result, a fresh Ottoman assault began. Meanwhile, Murad sent an envoy trying to convince Skanderbeg to capitulate by offering 10,000 crowns annually. Skanderbeg also refused replying: [...] "Nay if Murad did divide with me and make me co-partner with all his empire, I would never suffer the name of Albania to be stained and <b>blemished</b> with this blot of disgrace and infamy." [...] The assault continued, and the Albanian positions seemed desperate. On October 14, Skanderbeg offered Krujë to the Venetians, threatening to capitulate the fortress to the Turks if they did not accept it. After Murad lifted the siege on October 26, because of the arriving winter, the Venetians replied to Skanderbeg's offer rejecting it and offered to help Skanderbeg to harmonize his relationship with Ottomans.|$|E

Pitchfork critic Mark Pytlik said because most of M.I.A.'s lyrics gave the impression they were written [...] "in {{the service of the}} rhythms", her allusions sounded more [...] "rewarding" [...] than what she literally had written. Andy Gill of The Independent found her lyrics unclear in their message about money and social concerns, while remarking that the gun references on [...] "World Town" [...] and [...] "Paper Planes" [...] <b>blemished</b> [...] "an otherwise fine album". In The Guardian, Alexis Petridis wrote that Kala was still a [...] "unique" [...] listen in spite of occasionally tuneless songs. Writing for NME, Alex Miller acknowledged that the record's music polarised opinion, claiming that some members of the magazine's staff had [...] "fed several copies [...] into the shredder claiming aural abuse", although others went on to praise the album for its innovation and referred to it as M.I.A.'s masterpiece.|$|E

40|$|<b>Blemishing</b> {{is a major}} quality defect of {{persimmon}} both in Australia and New Zealand. Several {{studies were}} conducted on the incidence and development of <b>blemish</b> in 4 well-managed orchards in both countries. Over 10 different types of <b>blemishing</b> were identified and documented. Of the <b>blemishes</b> identified, wind rub caused the greatest reduction in marketable fruit. The occurrence of this disorder was 5 times higher in Australia than in New Zealand in spite of windrun in New Zealand being 2 – 2. 5 time higher than in Australia. The lower incidence of wind rub in New Zealand appears {{to be due to}} the use of Y trellising, whereas, in Australia, trees are free-standing. The incidence of sunburn varied markedly with season. The incidence of this disorder was reduced by bird-netting (5 - 15 % shade factor) which is the standard management practise in Australia. Line, apex and concentric cracking were minor problems in most orchards. Methods for controlling <b>blemishing</b> in commercial orchards are outlined...|$|R

Although {{the pattern of}} <b>blemishes</b> looks random, the sys-tematic and geometry dependent nature of the underlying distribution is still observable. A distribution of tendency (potential to contain <b>blemishes)</b> is mod-eled in the first step, which includes user control and geometric information. The second generates and distributes an irregular <b>blemish</b> pattern according to the modeled tendency distribution. As examples we model three common surface imperfections; dust accumulation, patina and peeling. ...|$|R
