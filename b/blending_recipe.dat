The flexibility in the <b>blending</b> <b>recipe</b> for Chianti accounts {{for some of the}} variability in styles among Chiantis. Lighter bodied styles will generally have a higher proportion of white grape varieties blended in, while Chiantis that have only red grape varieties will be fuller and richer. While only 15% of Cabernet Sauvignon is permitted in the blend, the nature of the grape variety can have a dominant personality in the Chianti blend and be a strong influence in the wine.|$|E

Increasing a refinery’s economic performance depends, among other things, on obtaining optimum blending recipes for the available components. To determine the optimum <b>blending</b> <b>recipe,</b> knowing the mathematical blending model for blending properties estimation and a linear optimization algorithm are necessary.

40|$|Background: Chronic {{hunger and}} {{nutritional}} inadequacy remain major obstacles to human {{development and the}} first UN Millennium Development Goal (MDGs) is targeted at reducing chronic hunger in particular. Various {{attempts have been made}} to address the issue including through food aid, supplementation and fortification programmes. Objective: The primary focus of this paper is to demonstrate how local traditional food sources can be harnessed to help reduce hunger and meet daily nutritional needs of vulnerable groups in resource-poor settings at low cost employing the food multimix concept. Methods: The FMM concept is based on the principle that combining indigenous knowledge, understanding of human physiological needs across the life cycle and employing the principles of food science and technology, scant traditional local food ingredients can be combined to produce nutritionally balanced recipes and composite diets using the ‘nutrient strengths’ of each ingredient. In this study, candidate foods were identified and selected to complement each other. Traditional food processing methods were employed including roasting, sun and freeze-drying and <b>blending.</b> <b>Recipe</b> development was followed by proximate and micronutrient analyses including the use of AAS and ICP / ICP-MS for trace mineral analysis. Through a process of optimization, recipes were refined to meet specifically targeted nutrient needs. Results: Applying the FMM concept resulted in production of composite recipes of very low cost (range 0. 1 – 0. 16 USD per 100 g of product). Energy density ranged from 350 - 400 kcals and protein from 12 – 20 g per 100 g respectively. Mineral content as a...|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to develop an integrated approach to coordinate short-term scheduling of multi-product blending facilities with nonlinear recipe optimization. The proposed strategy is based on a hierarchical concept consisting of three business levels: Long-range planning, short-term scheduling and process control. Long-range planning is accomplished by solving a large-scale nonlinear recipe optimization problem (multi-blend problem). Resulting <b>blending</b> <b>recipes</b> and production volumes are provided as goals for the scheduling level. The scheduling problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program derived from a resource-task network representation. The scheduling model permits recipe changeovers in order to utilize an additional degree of freedom for optimization. By interpreting the solution of the scheduling problem, new constraints can be imposed on the previous multi-blend problem. Thus bottlenecks arising during scheduling are considered already on the topmost long-range planning level. Based on the outlined approach a commercial software system has been designed to optimize the operation of in-line blending and batch blending processes. The application of the strategy and software is demonstrated by a detailed cas...|$|R
40|$|The {{scheduling}} of gasoline-blending {{operations is}} an important problem in the oil refining industry. This problem not only exhibits the combinatorial nature that is intrinsic to scheduling problems, but also non-convex nonlinear behavior, due to the blending of various materials with different quality properties. In this work, a global optimization algorithm is proposed to solve a previously published continuous-time mixed-integer nonlinear scheduling model for gasoline blending. The model includes <b>blend</b> <b>recipe</b> optimization, the distribution problem, and several important operational features and constraints. The algorithm employs piecewise McCormick relaxation (PMCR) and normalized multiparametric disaggregation technique (NMDT) to compute estimates of the global optimum. These techniques partition the domain {{of one of the}} variables in a bilinear term and generate convex relaxations for each partition. By increasing the number of partitions and reducing the domain of the variables, the algorithm is able to refine the estimates of the global solution. The algorithm is compared to two commercial global solvers and two heuristic methods by solving four examples from the literature. Results show that the proposed global optimization algorithm performs on par with commercial solvers but is not as fast as heuristic approaches...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe main aim of {{the study}} is to {{increase}} the efficiency of gasoline blending process using developed complex modeling system, it provides counting feedstock changes in the refinery, influencing detonation characteristics of trade gasoline. Final products of modeling system are precise and gasoline <b>blending</b> <b>recipes</b> are economically optimal. The relevance {{of the study is}} caused by the need to increase production volumes of trade gasoline in refineries that meet gasoline quality standards. Mathematical modeling and application of automatic computer systems are most relevant solutions for optimization of technologically difficult stages of oil production. The study considers the modeling approach to the blending process from the position of non-additivity of gasoline octane numbers. Practical results: The module of gasoline detonation characteristics developed in Borland «Delphi 7 » workspace in conjunction with the module of chromatographic data analysis «Unichrom» and optimal recipes development module are combined in the universal complex system for gasoline blending process maintenance. The system allows taking into account feedstock composition changes on purpose to vary the recipes of trade gasoline blending. The developed complex system analyzes refinery conditions and recommends the feedstock supply in the process and allows getting essential economic benefit for the refineries by reducing the quality reserve of trade products...|$|R

The character transitions in one second from walking to skipping in a seamless, natural way. We invite the reader to view this animation in the accompanying movie. We describe a discriminative method for distinguishing naturallooking from unnatural-looking motion. Our method is based on physical and data-driven features of motion to which humans seem sensitive. We demonstrate that our technique is significantly more accurate than current alternatives. We use this technique as the testing part of a hypothesize-and-test motion synthesis procedure. The mechanism we build using this procedure can quickly provide an application with a transition of user-specified duration from any frame in a motion collection to any other frame in the collection. During pre-processing, we search all possible 2 -, 3 -, and 4 -way blends between representative samples of motion obtained using clustering. The blends are automatically evaluated, and the recipe (i. e., the representatives and the set of weighting functions) that created the best blend is cached. At run-time, we build a transition between motions by matching a future window of the source motion to a representative, matching the past of the target motion to a representative, and then applying the <b>blend</b> <b>recipe</b> recovered from the cache to source and target motion. People seem sensitive to poor contact with the environment like sliding foot plants. We determine appropriate temporal and positional constraints for each foot plant using a novel technique, then apply an off-the-shelf inverse kinematics technique to enforce the constraints.

40|$|National audienceOne of {{the most}} {{critical}} activities in a refinery is the scheduling of loading and unloading of crude oil. Better analysis of this activity gives rise to better use of a system's resources, as well as control of the entire supply chain. It is important that the crude oil is loaded and unloaded contiguously, primarily for security reasons (e. g. possibility of system failures) but also to reduce the setup costs incurred when flow between a dock and a tank or between a tank and a crude distillation unit is reinitialized. The aim of the present paper is to develop an exact solution approach, widely applicable to most refineries where several modes of <b>blending</b> and several <b>recipe</b> preparation alternatives are used.

This results in the generation of various reversible thermochromic effects with control of both the temperaturetransition and the hue in the low and high temperature stages.

40|$|Gasoline {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{valuable}} products in an oil refinery and can account for as much as 60 - 70 % of total profit. Optimal integrated scheduling of gasoline blending and order delivery operations can significantly increase profit by avoiding ship demurrage, improving customer satisfaction, minimizing quality give-aways, reducing costly transitions and slop generation, exploiting low-quality cuts, and reducing inventory costs. In this article, we first introduce a new unit-specific event-based continuous-time formulation for the integrated treatment of <b>recipes,</b> <b>blending,</b> and scheduling of gasoline blending and order delivery operations. Many operational features are included such as nonidentical parallel blenders, constant blending rate, minimum blend length and amount, blender transition times, multipurpose product tanks, changeovers, and piecewise constant profiles for blend component qualities and feed rates. To address the non-convexities arising from forcing constant blending rates during a run, we propose a hybrid global optimization approach incorporating a schedule adjustment procedure, iteratively via a mixed-integer programming and nonlinear programming scheme, and a rigorous deterministic global optimization approach. The computational results demonstrate that our proposed formulation does improve the mixed-integer linear programming relaxation of Li and Karimi, Ind. Eng. Chem. Res., 2011, 50, 9156 - 9174.
