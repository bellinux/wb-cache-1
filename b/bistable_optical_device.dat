40|$|Nonlinear optical {{transverse}} effects, which {{arise from}} the interaction of a Gaussian beam with a nonlinear medium, are discussed. They are cw on-resonance enhancement (CORE), cw off-resonance rings, crosstalk, intracavity phase switching, self-defocusing of a bistable etalon, and thin-sample-encoding (TSE) self-lensing (i. e., self-focusing or self-defocusing) bistability and instabilities. CORE is the enhancement of the on-axis intensity of an on-resonance laser beam in a two-level medium. We report the first observation of CORE using sodium vapor. Cw off-resonance rings, resulting from a pure phase encoding or from simultaneous phase and amplitude encodings, are observed using sodium vapor. These rings have been observed many time before, but we have made the first careful comparison with numerical calculations. Parallel operation and external switching are two crucial themes {{for the application of}} <b>bistable</b> <b>optical</b> <b>devices</b> (BODs). For parallel operation, crosstalk between nearby BODs on the same etalon due to diffraction coupling may need to be avoided. Minimum separations needed to ensure independent operation are computed. For external switching, intracavity phase switching using a plane-wave input can switch on (or off) a BOD using an external pulse. The validity of this concept for a Gaussian input is numerically simulated. Self-defocusing effects, resulting in some interesting effects in the transverse bistable loops, are observed using a GaAs-GaAlAs bistable etalon. The results are confirmed by numerical simulations. TSE self-lensing bistability is observed using a short sodium cell and a single mirror. TSE self-lensing bistability results from an enhancement in the feedback via self-lensing of the beam. The lack of an optical resonator and the use of a thin medium make TSE setup a good candidate to study the Ikeda instability. We report the first observation of the Ikeda instability in this all-optical passive system using a cw input.

Symmetry-recovering crisis originating from the collision between the unstable periodic orbit and chaotic asymmetrical solution is predicated to occur for T (formula obmitted) (T: transit time, (formula obmitted) : response time of nonlinear medium).

40|$|A {{new kind}} of optical bistability is {{discussed}} {{that is based on}} mutual self-action of light beams in a nonlinear medium.

40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{limitations on}} the operation of <b>optical</b> <b>bistable</b> <b>devices</b> in a ring cavity and in GaAs etalons are investigated. Experimental results of spontaneous transitions due to shot noise fluctuations are found in good agreement with various "ladder" models, if one allows the counting rates to vary accordingly. Stability analysis for two-photon homogeneously broadened media reveals single-wavelength instabilities for the laser but not for absorptive optical bistability. Appreciable regions of sidemode gain exist for both problems allowing for multiwavelength instabilities to occur. GaAs bistable devices show attractive features such as low power and high speed {{at room temperature for}} optical processing. However, experimental evidence in GaAs confirm the computer simulations of bistability that cavity losses, due to unsaturable background absorption, limit the switching power at room temperature.

40|$|We {{show that}} two-photon {{transport}} can be modulated by a two-level emitter coupled to a cavity in a one-dimensional waveguide. In the ordinary case, the transmitted light has a wider frequency spectrum than the situation without the cavity {{because it is}} reflected and scattered many times. But when the two photons are resonant with the cavity resonance reflection frequency, the frequency spectrum of the transmitted light becomes narrower than that without the cavity. This means that properly tuning the cavity resonance frequency can improve the photon-photon interaction. In addition, we show that the two-photon intensity correlation functions are nearly opposite to {{each other at the}} two sides of the emitter transition frequency rather than be the same, which is exactly the Fano resonance line shape for two photons. Such an effect is important for lowering the power threshold in <b>optical</b> <b>bistable</b> <b>devices</b> and for sensing applications. When the emitter transition frequency equals to the cavity resonance frequency for a high-Q cavity, our results agree with the recent experiments and theories. Comment: 12 pages, 16 figure...|$|R

Address decoding is implemented with elementary <b>optical</b> <b>bistable</b> <b>devices</b> and modulator pixels as all-optical latches and electro-optical and gates, respectively. All 60 defect-free channels of the system could be operated one by one, but the simultaneous operation of only three channels could be achieved {{mainly because of the}} spatial nonhomogeneities of the devices. Direct-control operation is based on directly setting the bistable device reflectivity with a variable-control beam power.

A systematic study of the room temperature, frequency-dependent optical nonlinearities of bulk and multiple-quantum-well GaAs is reported and discussed. The results of the bulk GaAs experiments are in good agreement with a recently developed plasma theory. The carrier lifetime and the optical nonlinearities of multiple-quantum-well structures of varying well sizes are measured and compared to bulk GaAs. The prospect of lowering the power threshold for nonlinear action is explored in GaAs doping superlattices. The ability to increase the carrier lifetime with internal space charge fields is demonstrated experimentally in a doping superlattice structure. The possibility of using these long lifetimes to lower the power requirements of optical bistability is discussed. The linear optical properties of quantum-confined structures are studied both in GaAs/AlGaAs quantum wires as well as in CdS quantum dots. The enhanced confinement of the carriers shifts the absorption band-edge to higher energies relative to bulk. The techniques used to fabricate these nanometer-sized features are outlined.

This integrated Fabry-Perot device is uniform over a 1 cm² area with switching characteristics comparable to the best devices previously obtained and with improved thermal stability.

High-transmission operation is predicted for certain etalon detunings from the excitation wavelength. Various logic-gate functions have simulated with the model. An investigation of differential energy gain in transient, one-wavelength operation was performed. The conclusion is that useful differential gain is not achievable in transient, one-wavelength operation if the pulse width is less than about ten times the carrier lifetime in the material.
