Political violence is uncommon, though very large demonstrations may occur in Paris and other French cities simultaneously. These demonstrations, usually managed <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> police presence, can turn confrontational and escalate into violence.|$|E

5|$|The present {{shape of}} the walls was defined in the 14th century after the city gained its full {{independence}} from Venetian suzerainty, but the peak of its construction lasted {{from the beginning of}} the 15th century until the latter half of the 16th century.

5|$|After a long {{spell of}} hot and dry weather through mid-1666, what later {{became known as}} the Great Fire of London started on 2 September 1666 in a bakehouse on Pudding Lane. Fanned <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> easterly wind and fed by {{stockpiles}} of wood and fuel that had been prepared for the coming colder months, the fire eventually consumed about 13,200 houses and 87 churches, including St Paul's Cathedral. Charles and his brother James joined and directed the fire-fighting effort. The public blamed Catholic conspirators for the fire, and one Frenchman, Robert Hubert, was hanged {{on the basis of a}} false confession even though he had no hand in starting the fire.|$|E
5|$|After being {{accompanied}} <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> marketing campaign, Resident Evil 3 received {{very positive}} reviews from critics and {{sold more than}} three million units worldwide. Most critics praised the game's detailed graphics and the Nemesis creature as an intimidating villain, but some criticized the game's short length and story. After its release on the PlayStation console, Resident Evil 3 was ported to the Dreamcast, Microsoft Windows and GameCube platforms to varying degrees of success.|$|E
5|$|Court-show viewers don't {{seem to want}} moral conundrums or {{technical}} wrinkles. They love Sheindlin's show because she offers them a fantasy of how they'd like the justice system to operate—swiftly, and without procedural mishaps or uppity lawyers. They get to see wrongdoers publicly humiliated <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> authority figure. There is no uncertainty after Sheindlin renders her verdict and bounds off the bench, and there certainly are no lengthy appeals.|$|E

Del Potro won the first set but eventually lost in the semifinals against Federer, who would go on to win the tournament.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} half of the 18th century, Lima was {{adversely}} affected by the Bourbon Reforms as it lost its monopoly on overseas trade and the important mining region of Upper Peru was transferred to the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata. This economic decline made the city's elite dependent on royal and ecclesiastical appointment and thus, reluctant to advocate independence. In the 1810s, the city became a Royalist stronghold during the South American wars of independence led <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> viceroy, José Fernando de Abascal y Sousa.|$|E
5|$|Eisenhower {{would leave}} office with an {{agreement}} out of reach, as Eisenhower's technical advisors, upon whom he relied heavily, became {{mired in the}} complex technical questions of a test ban, driven in part <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> interest among American experts to lower the error rate of seismic test detection technology. Some, including Kistiakowsky, would eventually raise concerns {{about the ability of}} inspections and monitors to successfully detect tests. The primary product of negotiations under Eisenhower was the testing moratorium without any enforcement mechanism. Ultimately, the goal of a comprehensive test ban would be abandoned in favor of a partial ban due to questions over seismic detection of underground tests.|$|E

5|$|In mid-June, a broad {{cyclonic}} area of cloudiness persisted to {{the south}} of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. A low-level circulation and banding features became more prominent on June16, and further development was aided by the presence of a tropical wave that first departed the western coastline of Africa on June5. As extremely deep convection festered within a band west of the disturbance's center, it is estimated the first tropical depression of the season formed around 06:00UTC on June18, located about 260mi (420km) southeast of Acapulco, Mexico. The newly-formed cyclone tracked west-northwest parallel to the coastline, steered <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> area of high pressure to its north and east.|$|E
5|$|Late in the afternoon, a Yorktown scout {{aircraft}} located Hiryū, prompting Enterprise {{to launch}} a final strike of 24 dive bombers (including 6 SBDs from VS-6, 4 SBDs from VB-6, and 14 SBDs from Yorktowns VB-3). Despite Hiryū being defended <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> cover {{of more than a}} dozen Zero fighters, the attack by Enterprise and orphaned Yorktown aircraft launched from Enterprise was successful: four bombs (possibly five) hit Hiryū, leaving her ablaze and unable to operate aircraft.

5|$|On 14 January, the Rangers {{formed the}} armored {{spearhead}} of the 1st Battalion, 32nd Infantry {{attack on the}} village of Majori-ri, {{as part of an}} offensive to push Chinese forces back from the Tanyang area. The company entered the village at 07:30 and was ambushed by a battalion of Chinese troops entrenched there in fortified positions. The Rangers were able to capture the village and fend off a counterattack with their heavy weapons, suffering five killed and five wounded while killing 100 Chinese soldiers. However, as it moved to reinforce another U.S. infantry company advancing north, the 2nd Ranger Company was hit <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> Chinese counterattack, and was forced to withdraw after running out of ammunition.
