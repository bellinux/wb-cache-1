5|$|Ireland is {{the third}} best seller European market of E85 flex-fuel vehicles, after Sweden and France. <b>Bioethanol</b> (E85) in Ireland is made from whey, a waste product of cheese manufacturing. The Irish {{government}} established several incentives, including a 50% discount in vehicle registration taxes (VRT), which can {{account for more than}} one third of the retail price of a new car in Ireland (around €6,500). The <b>bioethanol</b> element of the E85 fuel is excise-free for fuel companies, allowing retail prices to be low enough to offset the 25 per cent cut in fuel economy that E-85 cars offer, due to ethanol's lower energy content than gasoline. Also, the value added tax (VAT) on the fuel can also be claimed back. E-85 fuel is available across the country in more than 20 of Maxol service stations. In October 2005, the 1.8 Ford Focus FFV became the first flexible-fuel vehicle to be commercially sold in Ireland. Later Ford launched the C-max and the Mondeo flexifuel models. Saab and Volvo also have E85 models available.|$|E
5|$|On June 10, 2010, the EC {{announced}} {{its decision to}} set up certification schemes for biofuels, including imports {{as part of the}} Renewable Energy Directive. The Commission encouraged E.U. nations, industry and NGOs to set up voluntary certification schemes. EC figures for 2007 showed that 26% of biodiesel and 31% of <b>bioethanol</b> used in the E.U. was imported, mainly from Brazil and the United States.|$|E
5|$|In {{another study}} {{commissioned}} by the Dutch government in 2006 to evaluate the sustainability of Brazilian <b>bioethanol</b> concluded that there is sufficient water to supply all foreseeable long-term water requirements for sugarcane and ethanol production. This evaluation also found that consumption of agrochemicals for sugar cane production is lower than in citric, corn, coffee and soybean cropping. The study found that development of resistant sugar cane varieties is a crucial aspect of disease and pest control {{and is one of}} the primary objectives of Brazil’s cane genetic improvement programs. Disease control is one of the main reasons for the replacement of a commercial variety of sugar cane.|$|E
5|$|The UK {{government}} established several {{incentives for}} E85 flex-fuel vehicles. These include a fuel duty rebate on E85 fuel of 20 p per liter, until 2010; a £ 10 to 15 {{reduction in the}} vehicle excise duty (VED); and a 2% annual company car tax discount for flex-fuel cars. Despite {{the small number of}} E85 pump stations available, limited to the Morrisons supermarket chain stations, most automakers offer the same models in the UK that are available in the European market. In 2005 the Ford Focus Flexi-Fuel became the first flexible-fuel car sold in the UK, though E85 pumps were not opened until 2006. Volvo now offers its flexifuel models S80, S40, C30, V50 and V70. Other models available in the UK are the Ford C-Max Flexi-Fuel, and the Saab models 9-5 and 9-3 Flex-Fuel Biopower, and the new Saab Aero X BioPower E100 <b>bioethanol.</b>|$|E
25|$|Sources of new energy: <b>bioethanol</b> from bamboo, {{citrus fruit}} extract, thinned wood, and other plants. <b>Bioethanol</b> is mostly used for {{transportation}} and shipping. JNC Corp {{is one such}} <b>bioethanol</b> plant that was established in early 2012 that will produce 100,000 kiloliters/ year of <b>bioethanol</b> from bamboo.|$|E
25|$|In Brazil, {{gasoline}} {{is required to}} contain at least 22 percent <b>bioethanol.</b> This <b>bioethanol</b> is sourced from Brazil's large sugarcane crop.|$|E
25|$|The use of <b>bioethanol,</b> either {{directly}} or indirectly by conversion of such ethanol to bio-ETBE, is encouraged by the European Union Directive on the Promotion of the use of biofuels and other renewable fuels for transport. Since producing <b>bioethanol</b> from fermented sugars and starches involves distillation, though, ordinary people in much of Europe cannot legally ferment and distill their own <b>bioethanol</b> at present (unlike in the US, where getting a BATF distillation permit has been easy since the 1973 oil crisis).|$|E
25|$|Under {{the auspices}} of the <b>BioEthanol</b> for Sustainable Transport project, more than 138 <b>bioethanol</b> ED95 buses were part of {{demonstration}} trial at four cities, three in Europe, and one in Brazil, between 2006 and 2009. A total of 127 ED95 buses operated in Stockholm, five buses operated in Madrid, three in La Spezia, and one in Brazil.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bioethanol</b> {{is a form}} of {{renewable}} energy that can be produced from agricultural feedstocks. It can be made from very common crops such as hemp, sugarcane, potato, cassava and corn. There has been considerable debate about how useful <b>bioethanol</b> is in replacing gasoline. Concerns about its production and use relate to increased food prices due to the large amount of arable land required for crops, as well as the energy and pollution balance of the whole cycle of ethanol production, especially from corn. Recent developments with cellulosic ethanol production and commercialization may allay some of these concerns.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bioethanol</b> is {{an alcohol}} made by fermentation, mostly from {{carbohydrates}} produced in sugar or starch {{crops such as}} corn or sugarcane. Cellulosic biomass, derived from non-food sources, such as trees and grasses, is also being developed as a feedstock for ethanol production. Ethanol {{can be used as}} a fuel for vehicles in its pure form, but it is usually used as a gasoline additive to increase octane and improve vehicle emissions. <b>Bioethanol</b> is widely used in the USA and in Brazil. Current plant design does not provide for converting the lignin portion of plant raw materials to fuel components by fermentation.|$|E
25|$|Biofuels {{include a}} wide range of fuels which are derived from biomass. The term covers solid, liquid, and gaseous fuels. Liquid {{biofuels}} include bioalcohols, such as <b>bioethanol,</b> and oils, such as biodiesel. Gaseous biofuels include biogas, landfill gas and synthetic gas. <b>Bioethanol</b> is an alcohol made by fermenting the sugar components of plant materials and it is made mostly from sugar and starch crops. These include maize, sugarcane and, more recently, sweet sorghum. The latter crop is particularly suitable for growing in dryland conditions, and is being investigated by International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics for its potential to provide fuel, along with food and animal feed, in arid parts of Asia and Africa.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{its high}} energy density and ease of handling, oil has a unique role as a {{transportation}} fuel. There are, however, {{a number of possible}} alternatives. Among the biofuels the use of <b>bioethanol</b> and biodiesel is already established to some extent in some countries.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, BP {{formed with}} AB Sugar and DuPont {{a joint venture}} Vivergo Fuels which opened a <b>bioethanol</b> plant in Saltend near Hull, United Kingdom in December 2012. Together with DuPont, BP formed a {{biobutanol}} joint venture Butamax by acquiring biobutan technology company Biobutanol LLC in 2009.|$|E
25|$|Another {{possible}} {{alternative is}} a yeast-based coproduct of <b>bioethanol</b> production, proteinaceous fermentation biomass. Substituting such products for engineered feed {{can result in}} equal (sometimes enhanced) growth in fish. With its increasing availability, this would address the problems of rising costs for buying hatchery fish feed.|$|E

Biodiesel {{can be used as a}} fuel for vehicles in its pure form, but it is usually used as a diesel additive to reduce levels of particulates, carbon monoxide, and hydrocarbons from diesel-powered vehicles. Biodiesel is produced from oils or fats using transesterification and is the most common biofuel in Europe.|$|E
25|$|Braskem and Toyota Tsusho Corporation started joint {{marketing}} activities to produce polyethylene from sugarcane. Braskem {{will build a}} new facility at their existing industrial unit in Triunfo, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil with an annual production capacity of , and will produce high-density and low-density polyethylene from <b>bioethanol</b> derived from sugarcane.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, Volvo {{entered the}} Swedish Touring Car Championship with a C30 powered by <b>bioethanol</b> E85 fuel. Robert Dahlgreen and Tommy Rustad were the drivers, {{finishing}} 5th and 10th respectively in the championship. Volvo had also signalled their intentions {{to enter the}} 2009 British Touring Car Championship with the same car.|$|E
25|$|The {{ability to}} {{efficiently}} and rapidly produce dimethylfuran from fructose, found in fruit and some root vegetables, or from glucose, {{which can be}} derived from starch and cellulose - all widely available in nature - adds to the attraction of dimethylfuran, although safety issues must be examined. <b>Bioethanol</b> and biodiesel are currently the leading liquid biofuels.|$|E
25|$|Industry {{has also}} {{developed}} recently around new energy investments and other energies: Bio-fuels (manufacturing site of <b>bioethanol</b> from the AB Bioenergy France Company, €150M investment), biomass (cellulose) {{and the production}} of electricity from gas (production site of SNET, investment of €400M). One driver of uptake and CO2 sequestration process is also underway (industrial investment of €100M).|$|E
25|$|A 2007 Uruguayan law {{mandates}} {{a minimum}} of 5% of ethanol blended with gasoline starting in January 2015. The monopolic, state-owned fuel producer ANCAP started blending premium gasoline with 10% of <b>bioethanol</b> in December 2009, which {{will be available in}} all the country by early January 2010. The other two gasolines will follow later in 2010.|$|E
25|$|Other common blends include E5 and E7. These {{concentrations}} {{are generally}} safe for recent engines that should run on pure gasoline. As of 2006, mandates for blending <b>bioethanol</b> into vehicle fuels had been enacted {{in at least}} 36 states/provinces and 17 countries at the national level, with most mandates requiring a blend of 10 to 15% ethanol with gasoline.|$|E
25|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} an {{increased}} interest in biofuels – <b>bioethanol</b> and biodiesel – derived from common agricultural staples or waste. Increased domestic production of these fuels could reduce US expenditure on foreign oil and improve energy security if methods of producing and transporting the fuels do not involve heavy inputs of fossil fuels, as current agriculture does.|$|E
25|$|Gasoline {{engines are}} used in most hybrid {{electric}} designs and will likely remain dominant for the foreseeable future. While petroleum-derived gasoline is the primary fuel, {{it is possible to}} mix in varying levels of ethanol created from renewable energy sources. Like most modern ICE powered vehicles, HEVs can typically use up to about 15% <b>bioethanol.</b> Manufacturers may move to flexible fuel engines, which would increase allowable ratios, but no plans are in place at present.|$|E
25|$|The {{difference}} from ethanol production is {{primarily in the}} fermentation of the feedstock and minor changes in distillation. The feedstocks {{are the same as}} for ethanol: energy crops such as sugar beets, sugar cane, corn grain, wheat and cassava, prospective non-food energy crops such as switchgrass and even guayule in North America, as well as agricultural byproducts such as bagasse, straw and corn stalks. According to DuPont, existing <b>bioethanol</b> plants can cost-effectively be retrofitted to biobutanol production.|$|E
25|$|Swedish carmakers have {{developed}} ethanol-only capable engines {{for the new}} Saab Aero X BioPower 100 Concept E100, with a V6 engine which is fuelled entirely by E100 <b>bioethanol,</b> and the limited edition of the Koenigsegg CCXR, {{a version of the}} CCX converted to use E85 or E100, as well as standard 98-octane gasoline, and currently the fastest and most powerful flex-fuel vehicle with its twin-supercharged V8 producing 1018hp when running on biofuel, as compared to 806hp on 91-octane unleaded gasoline.|$|E
25|$|Cellulosic ethanol commercialization is {{the process}} of {{building}} an industry out of methods of turning cellulose-containing organic matter into fuel. Companies, such as Iogen, POET, and Abengoa, are building refineries that can process biomass and turn it into <b>bioethanol.</b> Companies, such as Diversa, Novozymes, and Dyadic, are producing enzymes that could enable a cellulosic ethanol future. The shift from food crop feedstocks to waste residues and native grasses offers significant opportunities for a range of players, from farmers to biotechnology firms, and from project developers to investors.|$|E
25|$|The January 2006 Science {{article from}} UC Berkeley's ERG, {{estimated}} reduction from corn ethanol in GHG to be 13% after reviewing {{a large number}} of studies. In a correction to that article released shortly after publication, they reduce the estimated value to 7.4%. A National Geographic Magazine overview article (2007) puts the figures at 22% less CO2 emissions in production and use for corn ethanol compared to gasoline and a 56% reduction for cane ethanol. Carmaker Ford reports a 70% reduction in CO2 emissions with <b>bioethanol</b> compared to petrol for one of their flexible-fuel vehicles.|$|E
25|$|Life {{science is}} a key sector with {{extensive}} research and development activities. Danish engineers are world-leading in providing diabetes care equipment and medication products from Novo Nordisk and, since 2000, the Danish biotech company Novozymes, the world market leader in enzymes for first generation starch based <b>bioethanol,</b> has pioneered development of enzymes for converting waste to cellulosic ethanol. Medicon Valley, spanning the Øresund Region between Zealand and Sweden, is one of Europe's largest life science clusters, containing {{a large number of}} life science companies and research institutions located within a very small geographical area.|$|E
25|$|At that power, {{only a few}} {{sections}} of the road need embedded cables. Hybrid vehicles, which use an internal combustion engine combined with an electric engine to achieve better fuel efficiency than a regular combustion engine, are already common. Natural gas is also used as a transport fuel. Biofuels are a less common, and less promising, technology; Brazil met 17% of its transport fuel needs from <b>bioethanol</b> in 2007, but the OECD has warned {{that the success of}} biofuels in Brazil is due to specific local circumstances; internationally, biofuels are forecast to have little or no impact on greenhouse emissions, at significantly higher cost than energy efficiency measures.|$|E
25|$|Since 1989 {{there have}} also been ethanol engines based on the diesel {{principle}} operating in Sweden. They are used primarily in city buses, but also in distribution trucks and waste collectors. The engines, made by Scania, have a modified compression ratio, and the fuel (known as ED95) used is a mix of 93.6% ethanol and 3.6% ignition improver, and 2.8% denaturants. The ignition improver makes it possible for the fuel to ignite in the diesel combustion cycle. It is then also possible to use the energy efficiency of the diesel principle with ethanol. These engines have been used in the United Kingdom by Reading Buses but the use of <b>bioethanol</b> fuel is now being phased out.|$|E
25|$|Until the {{beginning}} of the nineteenth century biomass was the predominant fuel, today it has only a small share of the overall energy supply. Electricity produced from biomass sources was estimated at 44GW for 2005. Biomass electricity generation increased by over 100% in Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland, and Spain. A further 220GW was used for heating (in 2004), bringing the total energy consumed from biomass to around 264GW. The use of biomass fires for cooking is excluded. World production of <b>bioethanol</b> increased by 8% in 2005 to reach , with most of the increase in the United States, bringing it level to the levels of consumption in Brazil. Biodiesel increased by 85% to , making it the fastest growing renewable energy source in 2005. Over 50% is produced in Germany.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, Grylls led {{a team of}} four {{to climb}} {{one of the most}} remote unclimbed peaks in the world in Antarctica, to raise funds for children's charity Global Angels and promote the use of {{alternative}} energies. During this mission the team also aimed to explore the coast of Antarctica by inflatable boat and jetski, part powered by <b>bioethanol,</b> and then to travel across some of the vast ice desert by wind-powered kite-ski and electric powered paramotor. However, the expedition was cut short after Grylls suffered a broken shoulder while kite skiing across a stretch of ice. Travelling at speeds up to 50km/h (30mph), a ski caught on the ice, launching him in the air and breaking his shoulder when he came down. He had to be medically evacuated.|$|E
25|$|With {{advanced}} technology being developed, cellulosic biomass, such as trees and grasses, {{are also used}} as feedstocks for ethanol production. Ethanol {{can be used as}} a fuel for vehicles in its pure form, but it is usually used as a gasoline additive to increase octane and improve vehicle emissions. <b>Bioethanol</b> is widely used in the United States and in Brazil. The energy costs for producing bio-ethanol are almost equal to, the energy yields from bio-ethanol. However, according to the European Environment Agency, biofuels do not address global warming concerns. Biodiesel is made from vegetable oils, animal fats or recycled greases. It {{can be used as a}} fuel for vehicles in its pure form, or more commonly as a diesel additive to reduce levels of particulates, carbon monoxide, and hydrocarbons from diesel-powered vehicles. Biodiesel is produced from oils or fats using transesterification and is the most common biofuel in Europe. Biofuels provided 2.7% of the world's transport fuel in 2010.|$|E
25|$|Brazil generates nearly three-quarters (73%) of its {{electricity}} from hydropower. This contribution was {{as high as}} four-fifths in 2010 but the share of hydropower has been eroded {{by a combination of}} declining rainfall and ageing hydroelectric plants, many of which date back to the 1960s and 1970s. Intensive use of thermoelectric power plants operating on fossil fuels has compensated for much of the loss, since the share of new sources of renewable energy, such as solar and wind, in the energy mix remains small. Moreover, although Brazil has made great strides in the use of <b>bioethanol</b> in transportation, there has been little focus on research and innovation in energy generation, be it in terms of developing new sources of energy or improving energy efficiency. In light of the foregoing, there is little reason to expect public investment in energy R to rebound to the levels seen {{at the turn of the}} century that would rebuild Brazil’s international competitiveness in this field.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, {{worldwide}} {{biofuel production}} reached 105 billion liters (28 billion gallons US), up 17% from 2009, and biofuels provided 2.7% of the world's fuels for road transport. Global ethanol fuel production reached 86 billion liters (23 billion gallons US) in 2010, with the United States and Brazil as the world's top producers, accounting together for about 90% of global production. The world's largest biodiesel producer is the European Union, accounting for 53% of all biodiesel production in 2010. As of 2011, mandates for blending biofuels exist in 31 countries {{at the national}} level and in 29 states or provinces. The International Energy Agency has a goal for biofuels to meet {{more than a quarter of}} world demand for transportation fuels by 2050 to reduce dependence on petroleum and coal. The production of biofuels also led into a flourishing automotive industry, where by 2010, 79% of all cars produced in Brazil were made with a hybrid fuel system of <b>bioethanol</b> and gasoline.|$|E
500|$|The {{history of}} ethanol fuel in Brazil {{dates from the}} 1970s and relates to Brazil's sugarcane-based ethanol fuel program, which allowed the country {{to become the world}}'s second largest {{producer}} of ethanol, and the world's largest exporter. [...] Several important political and technological developments led Brazil to become the world leader in the sustainable use of <b>bioethanol,</b> and a policy model for other developing countries in the tropical zone of Latin America, the Caribbean, and Africa.|$|E
