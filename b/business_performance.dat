500|$|As the Republican presidential {{nomination}} race {{went into the}} primaries season, Romney had not endorsed anyone but {{was one of the}} Republican establishment figures who were becoming increasingly concerned about the front-runner status of New York businessman Donald Trump. Romney publicly criticized Trump for not releasing his taxes, saying there might be a [...] "bombshell" [...] in them. Trump responded by calling Romney [...] "one of the dumbest and worst candidates in the history of Republican politics." [...] Then Romney gave a speech on March 3, 2016, at the Hinckley Institute of Politics, that represented a scathing attack on Trump's personal behavior, <b>business</b> <b>performance,</b> and domestic and foreign policy stances. He said Trump was [...] "a phony, a fraud ... He's playing members of the American public for suckers" [...] and that [...] "If we Republicans choose Donald Trump as our nominee, the prospects for a safe and prosperous future are greatly diminished." [...] In response Trump dismissed Romney as a [...] "choke artist". [...] Romney's speech represented an unprecedented attack by a major U.S. party's most recent presidential nominee against the party's current front-runner for the nomination. Romney encouraged Republicans to engage in tactical voting, by supporting whichever of the remaining rivals had the best chance to beat Trump in any given state, and as such Romney announced he was voting for, although not endorsing, Ted Cruz for president prior to the March 22 Utah caucus. [...] As the race went on, there was some evidence of tactical voting occurring, and some partial arrangements were formed among candidates, but by May 3 Trump had defeated all his opponents and became the party's presumptive nominee. [...] Romney then announced that he would not support Trump in the general election, saying, [...] "I am dismayed at where we are now, I wish we had better choices".|$|E

The internal perception of a corporation and the external perception of the same corporation are used as generic determinants of <b>business</b> ethics <b>performance.</b> In turn, they are underpinned by evolutionary and contextual issues in the marketplace. The authors provide a generic conceptual framework of proactive and reactive <b>business</b> ethics <b>performance.</b> Case illustrations underpin the positives and negatives of proactive and reactive business ethics in the marketplace.

2500|$|Three {{plans of}} {{reorganization}} were put forth {{before the end}} of 1880. The first came from the McCalmont faction; the second from a former vice president of the Reading; and the third from Franklin Gowen. The McCalmont plan would have given preferred protection to senior mortgage bond holders and also would have put a levy upon stockholders, US$15 per share, towards substantially paying down floating debt. The second plan did away with the levy—heavily objected to by American shareholders—but was contingent for success upon the Reading's preferred stock being worth roughly four times its current trading value. The third plan was put forth by Franklin Gowen in the context of known contemplation by the English bondholders of exercising their right of foreclosure against the Reading. Gowen's plan called for receivership to last for five years, for which time he projected increasingly improved <b>business</b> <b>performance,</b> reduction of fixed expenses to a manageable level, and liquidation of floating debt by the selling off of assets and/or conversion into preferred stock. This plan, as put forth to the McCalmonts, was accompanied by Gowen's offer to step aside as receiver. The English faction agreed to a plan very close to Gowen's, but with the stipulation that Gowen should indeed be replaced as receiver by someone not involved in the corporation's management prior to the bankruptcy. Gowen backpedaled vigorously.|$|E

40|$|Inter-firm {{business}} alliances attract {{considerable attention}} in recent years, but empirical {{studies on the}} effect of these alliances on the <b>business</b> <b>performances</b> of the participating firms have not been sufficiently conducted yet. Specifically, most empirical studies on this topic focus on the research consortia among large firms, and few studies have been carried out on the impact of alliances by small firms. Using micro data of 8, 622 manufacturing firms for the period 1991 - 98, this paper fills this gap by estimating the effects of business alliances by small firms on <b>business</b> <b>performances</b> and comparing the results with those of large firms. The measures of <b>business</b> <b>performances</b> used as dependent variables are profit rates as well as the growth of sales, labor productivity, and total factor productivity. Main independent variables are the dummies for the alliances in R&D, production, purchase, and sales. By comparing different length of performance measurement, we examine the duration of the effects of alliances. The empirical results with the sample of small firms (6, 096 firms) suggest that only R&D alliances have positive and significant effects on various kinds of <b>business</b> <b>performances.</b> No significant effects were found for the other kinds of business alliances. Major differences between small and large firms are that the R&D alliances have longer-lasting effects on profitability and significant effects on the growth of total factor productivity for small firms. These results as a whole provide support to the argument that alliances in R&D are important measures for improving profitability and efficiency of small manufacturing firms, which in general face the constraints of internal business resources...|$|R
40|$|<b>Business</b> {{sustainability}} <b>performance</b> differs greatly among {{companies and}} literature {{indicates that a}} possible explanation for {{this may be the}} differences that exist in the perception of business sustainability. While it is known that there is a relation between perception of business sustainability and <b>business</b> sustainability <b>performance,</b> further insight into how this perception varies with performance is needed. The research question of this study is therefore how does the <b>business</b> sustainability <b>performance</b> of companies vary with their perception of business sustainability? For this purpose, this study defines a holistic approach to business sustainability, which is characteristic for a sophisticated <b>business</b> sustainability <b>performance,</b> and develops the <b>business</b> sustainability <b>performance</b> framework. This framework allows differentiating four different <b>business</b> sustainability <b>performance</b> levels and is applied to the Dutch food retail sector. Eventually, five retailers are selected that vary in their <b>business</b> sustainability <b>performance.</b> By conducting in total 12 interviews at these retailers with sustainability managers as well as store managers, the food retailers’ perception of business sustainability is investigated. To better understand what determines the business sustainability perception, cognitive-affective mapping is applied – a tool to illustrate concepts and beliefs along with their emotional values as well as the relations between these concepts and beliefs. This study reveals that the business sustainability perception of a food retailer with a sophisticated <b>business</b> sustainability <b>performance</b> is more complex than the perception of those with a lower <b>business</b> sustainability <b>performance.</b> This complexity is determined by the number of concepts and beliefs, their mutual relations, and by the attached emotional values that together constitute the perception of business sustainability. The results show furthermore that commitment – especially of a company's decision-makers – {{is an essential part of}} becoming more sustainable as an organisation. Besides studying different industries, future research should therefore focus on decision-makers' commitment and individual perception of business sustainability as well as the underlying values, concepts, and believes...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the {{contribution}} of information technology (IT) value on <b>business</b> process <b>performance</b> and competitive dynamics by using value-based measurement with value chain concept. The inconsistency in results of previous studies made necessity to repeat testing to get conceptual measures and value chain model that can be accepted to measure IT value contribution on <b>business</b> process <b>performance</b> and competitive dynamics. Value chain concept to measure IT value contribution in <b>business</b> process <b>performance</b> and competitive dynamics is relatively new and never conducted before in Indonesia. This gives motivation to conduct the study. The primary data used in this study is collected from 197 IT managers in 70 Star Hotel in Bali by survey method and questionnaire administered by contact person. The sample determined by convenience random sampling. Data analyzed by multivariate structural equation modeling (SEM) technique processed by AMOS 4. 01 and SPSS 10. 0 programs. The results show that IT gives positive and insignificant value contribution on <b>business</b> process <b>performance</b> and competitive dynamics. Based on direct and indirect analysis comparison, it can be concluded that in indirect effect analysis, IT effect through primary business process gives higher value contribution on <b>business</b> process <b>performance</b> than its direct effect. Conversely, IT indirect effect through primary business process less contribute on competitive dynamics compared with its direct effect.
