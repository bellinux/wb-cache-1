5|$|HSP occurs {{more often}} in {{children}} than in adults, and usually follows an upper respiratory tract infection. Half of affected patients are below the age of six, and 90% are under ten. It occurs about twice as often in <b>boys</b> <b>as</b> in girls. The incidence of HSP in children is about 20 per 100,000 children per year, making it the most common vasculitis in children.|$|E
5|$|His {{father was}} by all {{accounts}} a cold and jealous man. Both parents were Jewish, but decided against raising the <b>boys</b> <b>as</b> Jews. Reich and his brother, Robert, were brought up to speak only German, were punished for using Yiddish expressions and forbidden from playing with the local Yiddish-speaking children.|$|E
5|$|Public {{interest}} in the scandal eventually faded. Nevertheless, newspaper coverage reinforced negative attitudes about male homosexuality as an aristocratic vice, presenting the telegraph <b>boys</b> <b>as</b> corrupted and exploited {{by members of the}} upper class. This attitude reached its climax a few years later when Oscar Wilde was tried for gross indecency as the result of his affair with Lord Alfred Douglas.|$|E
60|$|From {{the knee}} downward, the naked leg was {{beautiful}} to behold as any lady's arm; so soft and rounded, with infantile ease and grace. His whole figure was free, fine, and indolent; {{he was such}} a <b>boy</b> <b>as</b> might have ripened into life in a Neapolitan vineyard; such a <b>boy</b> <b>as</b> gipsies steal in infancy; such a <b>boy</b> <b>as</b> Murillo often painted, when he went among the poor and outcast, for subjects wherewith to captivate the eyes of rank and wealth; such a <b>boy,</b> <b>as</b> only Andalusian beggars are, full of poetry, gushing from every rent.|$|R

5|$|After all, {{young people}} are always searching for the beauty in love. They want their love to be beautiful. If they give in to weakness, {{following}} the models of behavior that can rightly be considered a 'scandal in the contemporary world' (and these are, unfortunately, widely diffused models), {{in the depths of}} their hearts they still desire a beautiful and pure love. This is as true of <b>boys</b> <b>as</b> it is of girls. Ultimately, they know that only God can give them this love. As a result, they are willing to follow Christ, without caring about the sacrifices this may entail.|$|E
5|$|Harry {{arranged}} for the future Beatles' manager, Brian Epstein, to see them perform a lunchtime concert at the Cavern Club on 9 November 1961. Epstein subsequently asked Harry to create a national music paper, the Music Echo, but after disagreements with Epstein about editorial control, he {{decided to become a}} P.R. agent; working for many solo artistes and groups, including Pink Floyd, Jethro Tull, Procol Harum, David Bowie, Led Zeppelin and the Beach <b>Boys,</b> <b>as</b> well as many others.|$|E
5|$|In {{stories from}} the 13th century, tengu began to abduct young <b>boys</b> <b>as</b> well as the priests they had always targeted. The boys were often returned, while the priests would be found tied to the tops of trees or other high places. All of the tengu's victims, however, would {{come back in a}} state of near death or madness, {{sometimes}} after having been tricked into eating animal dung.|$|E

5|$|The {{historian}} N. J. Higham {{speculates that}} Gregory had {{originally intended to}} send the British slave <b>boys</b> <b>as</b> missionaries, until in 596 he received news that Liudhard had died, thus opening the way for more serious missionary activity. Higham argues {{that it was the}} lack of any bishop in Britain which allowed Gregory to send Augustine, with orders to be consecrated as a bishop if needed. Another consideration was that cooperation would be more easily obtained from the Frankish royal courts if they no longer had their own bishop and agent in place.|$|E
5|$|Eagle Boys {{was founded}} in Albury, New South Wales by {{businessman}} Tom Potter in 1987. Since 1992, Eagle Boys national headquarters have been located in Annerley, Queensland. In 2007 NBC Capital, a Queensland-based venture capital group, bought Eagle Boys from Potter. At the chain's peak, in 2013, more than 340 Eagle Boys stores were operating across Australia. Outlet numbers fell drastically {{between the end of}} 2013 and the end of 2014 to around 170. In July 2016, fewer than 130 stores remained open and administrators were brought in to the head office to identify restructuring options ahead of a potential sale of the business, although the move did not extend to franchisee-operated outlets. In November 2016, Pizza Hut announced to media that it had merged with Eagle <b>Boys.</b> <b>As</b> at that date, 114 Eagle Boys stores operated throughout Australia; making it the fourth largest pizza chain in the country, with less than 10% share of the country's pizza market.|$|E
5|$|He {{was also}} a member of the North Carolina based Organization of Modern Extreme Grappling Arts (OMEGA) run by Matt and Jeff Hardy, where he {{defeated}} York to win the OMEGA Light Heavyweight Championship on January 29, 1999. He was signed to a World Championship Wrestling contract in 1999; Birch did not make any appearances for the promotion during the seven months he was signed to a contract. A few months later, while competing in singles competition at Maryland Championship Wrestling (MCW), he once again defeated York to win the MCW Cruiserweight Championship on May 21. Matthews and York soon began teaming again, and, sometimes using The Bad Street <b>Boys</b> <b>as</b> a tag team name, they won numerous tag team championships, including the Atlantic Terror Championship Wrestling Tag Team Championship on January 15, 2000 and the MCW Tag Team Championship on May 17, 2000.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1960s, {{sales of}} Hardy Boys books began to drop. The Stratemeyer Syndicate {{conducted}} a survey, which {{revealed that the}} decline in sales {{was due to the}} perceived high cost of the books and to competition from television. As a result, the Syndicate approved an hour-long pilot for a new Hardy Boys television show. The pilot, based on The Mystery of the Chinese Junk, was aired on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) on September 8, 1967 and starred Tim Matthieson (later Matheson) as Joe Hardy and Rick Gates as Frank. Both actors were twenty at the time of production and portrayed the Hardy <b>Boys</b> <b>as</b> young adults rather than children, as they had been in the Mickey Mouse Club serials. The show did poorly, however, and the series was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Schmittou {{learned from}} {{a member of the}} Metro Board of Parks and Recreation that neither the Park Board or the city of Nashville {{would be willing to pay}} for such a park. So, Schmittou, along with help from country music star Conway Twitty, put {{together}} a group of investors including other country stars Cal Smith, Larry Gatlin, Jerry Reed, and Richard Sterban (bass singer of the Oak Ridge <b>Boys),</b> <b>as</b> well as other Nashvillians, in order to finance a stadium and a minor league team. Twenty shares valued at US$15,000 each were issued, with Schmittou purchasing 2shares, or 10percent of the team. The Metro Parks Board agreed to lease to Schmittou the site of Nashville's former softball fields on the grounds of Fort Negley, an American Civil War fortification, approximately two miles (3km) south of downtown, for a period of 20years as long he built a stadium with a minimum capacity of 6,500 at a cost of at least $400,000 within 10years. In the second ten years, he would be required to pay the city seven percent of the team's total revenue.|$|E
5|$|The {{outcome of}} the case turned largely on the {{question}} of who had written the Nancy Drew series. Adams filed a countersuit, claiming that, as author of the Nancy Drew Mystery Stories, she retained the rights to her work. Although Adams had written many Nancy Drew titles after 1953 and edited others, she claimed to be the author of all of the early titles. In fact, she had rewritten the older titles, but was not the original author. When Mildred Benson, the author of the early Nancy Drew volumes, was called to testify about her work for the Syndicate, Benson's role in writing the manuscripts of early titles was revealed in court with extensive documentation, contradicting Adams' claims to authorship. The court ruled that Grosset had the rights to publish the original series of both Nancy Drew and the Hardy <b>Boys</b> <b>as</b> they were in print in 1980, but did not own characters or trademarks. Furthermore, any new publishers chosen by Adams were completely within their rights to print new titles.|$|E

5|$|Till {{arrived in}} Money, Mississippi, on August 21, 1955. On August 24, he and cousin Curtis Jones skipped church where his great-uncle Mose Wright was preaching and joined some local <b>boys</b> <b>as</b> {{they went to}} Bryant's Grocery and Meat Market to buy candy. The {{teenagers}} were children of sharecroppers and had been picking cotton all day. The market mostly served the local sharecropper population and was owned by a white couple, 24-year-old Roy Bryant and his 21-year-old wife Carolyn. Carolyn {{was alone in the}} store that day; her sister-in-law was {{in the rear of the}} store watching children. Jones left Till with the other boys while Jones played checkers across the street.|$|E
5|$|While {{he reads}} the diary {{over the course of}} several months, Jake is confronted by his {{siblings}} about his own view of humans. He spends time with his sister‚Äôs human fianc√©e and visits the set of a film in which his brother stars. Jake is introduced to a human actress whom he finds attractive. As he reaches the end of his father‚Äôs diary, there is an entry detailing a time Jake was attacked by some human <b>boys</b> <b>as</b> a child. Jake, who had repressed the memory, discusses it with his mother. He learns the attack was stopped by members of ‚Äò‚ÄôGallus Rex‚Äô‚Äô, an anti-human chicken group. Their actions colored Jake‚Äôs perception, and Elmer recorded his concerns about their effect on Jake in his diary.|$|E

25|$|In 1852, Horacio Morales {{helped build}} the first chapel in San Juan, {{although}} many parishioners still went to Santa B√°rbara. By 1885, the district educated as many <b>boys</b> <b>as</b> girls, with schools for both.|$|E
25|$|Brian Gorby, Neuhardt's {{friend and}} former bandmate in the percussion-heavy jam-band Humble Sacrifice, has carried on the charismo's {{tradition}} in the Hackensaw <b>Boys</b> <b>as</b> their touring percussionist.
