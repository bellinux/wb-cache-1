5|$|The pass {{is above}} tree line, so the {{surrounding}} terrain is alpine tundra. Open grassy expanses are occasionally broken by low shrubbery and <b>bare</b> <b>patches</b> of rock, {{particularly on the}} steep slope to the north. Snow lingers in some areas year-round. Adjacent to the road and parking area are small ephemeral pools on the southwest, with a larger, permanent one north of the road.|$|E
5|$|Various {{species of}} tick {{commonly}} infest the ears, neck and groin regions of most lions. Adult forms of {{several species of}} the tapeworm genus Taenia have been isolated from intestines, the lions having ingested larval forms from antelope meat. Lions in the Ngorongoro Crater were afflicted by an outbreak of stable fly (Stomoxys calcitrans) in 1962; this resulted in lions becoming covered in bloody <b>bare</b> <b>patches</b> and emaciated. Lions sought unsuccessfully to evade the biting flies by climbing trees or crawling into hyena burrows; many perished or emigrated as the population dropped from 70 to 15 individuals. A more recent outbreak in 2001 killed six lions. Lions, especially in captivity, are vulnerable to the canine distemper virus (CDV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), and feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). CDV is spread through domestic dogs and other carnivores; a 1994 outbreak in Serengeti National Park resulted in many lions developing neurological symptoms such as seizures. During the outbreak, several lions died from pneumonia and encephalitis. FIV, {{which is similar to}} HIV while not known to adversely affect lions, is worrisome enough in its effect in domestic cats that the Species Survival Plan recommends systematic testing in captive lions. It occurs with high to endemic frequency in several wild lion populations, but is mostly absent from Asiatic and Namibian lions.|$|E
25|$|The {{rufous-naped lark}} {{is found in}} many parts of sub-Saharan Africa. It has a very large but {{discontinuous}} range, with an estimated global extent of occurrence of 5,600,000km2. Its range is believed to be increasingly fragmented in the north, from which a declining population is inferred. The southern African population has not contracted in range or abundance, save for areas of extensive cultivation or urbanization. Livestock ranching is believed to have created <b>bare</b> <b>patches</b> in grasslands, which they favour. The populations of southern Mozambique and Swaziland have been estimated at >50,000 and 100,000 individuals respectively.|$|E

25|$|The {{process of}} {{domestication}} of wild plants cannot be described with any precision. However, Bruce D. Smith and other scholars {{have pointed out}} that three of the domesticates (chenopods, I. annua, and C. pepo) were plants that thrived in disturbed soils in river valleys. In the aftermath of a flood, in which most of the old vegetation is killed by the high waters and <b>bare</b> <b>patches</b> of new, often very fertile, soil were created, these pioneer plants sprang up like magic, often growing in almost pure stands, but usually disappearing after a single season, as other vegetation pushed them out until the next flood.|$|E
500|$|A {{patch of}} pennaceous {{feathers}} is found running along its back, which was {{quite similar to}} the contour feathers of the body plumage of modern birds in being symmetrical and firm, although not as stiff as the flight-related feathers. Apart from that, the feather traces in the Berlin specimen are limited {{to a sort of}} [...] "proto-down" [...] not dissimilar to that found in the dinosaur Sinosauropteryx: decomposed and fluffy, and possibly even appearing more like fur than feathers in life (although not in their microscopic structure). These occur on the remainder of the body—although some feathers did not fossilize and others were obliterated during preparation, leaving <b>bare</b> <b>patches</b> on specimens—and the lower neck.|$|E
500|$|Female emus {{court the}} males; the female's plumage darkens {{slightly}} {{and the small}} patches of bare, featherless skin just below the eyes and near the beak turn turquoise-blue. The colour of the male's plumage remains unchanged, although the <b>bare</b> <b>patches</b> of skin also turn light blue. [...] When courting, females stride around, pulling their neck back while puffing out their feathers and emitting low, monosyllabic calls that have been compared to drum beats. This calling can occur when males are out of sight or more than [...] away. [...] Once the male's attention has been gained, the female circles her prospective mate {{at a distance of}} [...] As she does this, she looks at him by turning her neck, {{while at the same time}} keeping her rump facing towards him.

50|$|Many {{arboreal}} species, such as tree porcupines, chameleons, silky anteaters, spider monkeys, and possums, use prehensile tails {{to grasp}} branches.

500|$|The clan's {{social life}} {{revolves}} around a communal den. While some clans may use particular den sites for years, others may use several different dens {{within a year}} or several den sites simultaneously. Spotted hyena dens can have more than a dozen entrances, and are mostly located on flat ground. The tunnels are usually oval in section, being wider than they are high, and narrow down from an entrance width of ½–1 metre (1.6–7.7ft) to as small as [...] In the rocky areas of East Africa and Congo, spotted hyenas use caves as dens, while those in the Serengeti use kopjes as resting areas in daylight hours. Dens have large <b>bare</b> <b>patches</b> around their entrances, where hyenas move or lie down on. Because of their size, adult hyenas are incapable of using the full extent of their burrows, as most tunnels are dug by cubs or smaller animals. The structure of the den, consisting of small underground channels, is likely an effective anti-predator device which protects cubs from predation during the absence of the mother. Spotted hyenas rarely dig their own dens, having been observed for the most part to use the abandoned burrows of warthogs, springhares and jackals. Faeces are usually deposited [...] away from the den, though they urinate wherever they happen to be. Dens are used mostly by several females at once, and {{it is not uncommon to}} see up to 20 cubs at a single site. The general form of a spotted hyena den is tunnel-shaped, with a spacious end chamber used for sleeping or breeding. This chamber measures up to [...] in width, the height being rather less. Females generally give birth at the communal den or a private birth den. The latter is primarily used by low status females in order to maintain continual access to their cubs, as well as ensure that they become acquainted with their cubs before transferral to the communal den.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the early}} {{problems}} the ground faced was the drought which struck southern Tasmania {{towards the end of}} the 19th century. [...] The pitch cut up and was virtually unplayable.

2500|$|Upon {{reaching}} Erebor, the Dwarves sent Bilbo into Smaug's lair, and he {{was initially}} successful in stealing a beautiful golden cup as Smaug slept fitfully. Knowing {{the contents of the}} treasure hoard which he had slept upon for centuries to the ounce, Smaug quickly realized the cup's absence upon his awakening and sought for the thief on the Mountain. [...] Unsuccessful, he returned to his hoard to lie in wait. [...] Having been nearly killed in the dragon's search, the Dwarves send Bilbo down the secret tunnel a second time. Smaug sensed Bilbo's presence immediately, even though Bilbo had rendered himself invisible with the One Ring, and accused the Hobbit (correctly) of trying to steal from him. During his discourse with the dragon, Bilbo detected a small <b>bare</b> <b>patch</b> in the jewel-encrusted underbelly of the dragon. [...] When Bilbo narrowly escapes an attack from the dragon and collapses amidst the Dwarves {{at the entrance to the}} secret tunnel, a thrush overhears Bilbo's frantic retelling of his interaction with the dragon and learns of the <b>bare</b> <b>patch</b> on Smaug's underside. [...] This becomes important later when Bard the Bowman kills the dragon during the wyrm's attack on Laketown by shooting an arrow into this <b>bare</b> <b>patch</b> and piercing the dragon mortally.|$|R

60|$|Ladd {{pursued a}} zigzag course southward across the desert, {{trotting}} down the aisles, cantering in wide, <b>bare</b> <b>patches,</b> {{walking through the}} clumps of cacti. The desert seemed all of a sameness to Dick--a wilderness of rocks and jagged growths hemmed in by lowering ranges, always looking close, yet never growing any nearer. The moon slanted back toward the west, losing its white radiance, and the gloom of the earlier evening began to creep into the washes and to darken under the mesas. By and by Ladd entered an arroyo, and here the travelers turned and twisted with the meanderings of a dry stream bed. At {{the head of a}} canyon they had to take once more to the rougher ground. Always it led down, always it grew rougher, more rolling, with wider bare spaces, always the black ranges loomed close.|$|E

At any rate, it entirely cleared away during the night; and when the sun arose the next morning, it shone brightly down on as bleak a tract of hill-country here in Berkshire, as could be seen anywhere in the world.
