40|$|An {{advanced}} infant {{car seat}} {{has been proposed}} to increase highway safety by reducing the incidence of crying, fussy behavior, and other child-related distractions that divert an adult driver s attention from driving. In addition to a conventional infant car seat with safety restraints, the proposed advanced infant car seat would include a number of components and subsystems that would function together as a comprehensive infant-care system that would keep its occupant safe, comfortable, and entertained, and would enable the driver to monitor the baby without having to either stop the car or turn around to face the infant during driving. The system would include a vibrator with bulb switch to operate; the switch would double as a squeeze toy that would make its own specific sound. A music subsystem would include loudspeakers built into the seat plus digital and analog circuitry that would utilize plug-in memory modules to synthesize music or {{a variety of other}} sounds. The music subsystem would include a built-in sound generator that could synthesize white noise or a human heartbeat to calm the baby to sleep. A second bulb switch could be used to control the music subsystem and would double as a squeeze toy that would make a distinct sound. An anti-noise sound-suppression system would isolate the baby from potentially disturbing ambient external noises. This subsystem would include small microphones, placed near the <b>baby</b> <b>s</b> ears, to detect ambient noise. The outputs of the microphone would be amplified and fed to the loudspeakers at appropriate amplitude and in a phase opposite that of the detected ambient noise, such that the net ambient sound arriving at the <b>baby</b> <b>s</b> ears would be almost completely cancelled. A video-camera subsystem would enable the driver to monitor the baby visually while continuing to face forward. One or more portable miniature video cameras could be embedded {{in the side of the}} infant car seat (see figure) or in a flip-down handle. The outputs of the video cameras would be transmitted by radio or infrared to a portable, miniature receiver/video monitor unit that would be attached to the dashboard of the car. The video-camera subsystem can also be used within transmission/reception range when the seat was removed from the car. The system would include a biotelemetric and tracking subsystem, which would include a Global Positioning System receiver for measuring its location. This subsystem would transmit the location of the infant car seat (even if the seat were not in a car) along with such biometric data as the <b>baby</b> <b>s</b> heart rate, perspiration rate, urinary status, temperature, and rate of breathing. Upon detecting any anomalies in the biometric data, this subsystem would send a warning to a paging device installed in the car or carried by the driver, so that the driver could pull the car off the road to attend to the baby. A motion detector in this subsystem would send a warning if the infant car seat were to be moved or otherwise disturbed unexpectedly while the infant was seated in it: this warning function, in combination with the position- tracking function, could help in finding a baby who had been kidnapped with the seat. Removable rechargeable batteries would enable uninterrupted functioning of all parts of the system while transporting the baby to and from the car. The batteries could be recharged via the cigarette-lighter outlet in the car or by use of an external AC-powered charger...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Sounds {{are part}} of our life {{and are able to}} produce effects on {{physical}} and emotional balance of people. Objective: To evaluate the effects of mother’s singing on the preemie using as parameters the heart and respiratory frequency and blood oxygen concentration of preemies, and also the mother perception related to baby behavior during the exposition to her singing. Methods: It is an exploratory investigation with quantitative and qualitative analyzes. Twenty preemies babies were observed during three consecutive days. Each child was exposed to the mother singing during ten minutes for three periods. The data were collected before and immediately after the music exposition. The heart and respiratory frequency and blood oxygen concentration of the baby were registered in two moments: pre and post- music exposition; the two measures were analyzed and compared. In the third day, the mother was interviewed to know her perception related to baby behavior during the singing exposition. The assessment of data was performed from March to July 2015 in two public hospitals in Sorocaba, São Paulo, Brazil. For the statistical analysis, Wilcoxon, Mc Nemar and variance test of Friedman were applied.

40|$|O presente estudo teve como objetivo {{principal}} analisar a comunica??o n?o verbal de d?ades m?e-beb? durante o primeiro ano de vida da crian?a, especificamente aos seis, nove e 12 meses de idade. Para tanto, foram verificadas as frequ?ncias com que m?es e beb?s utilizaram os gestos d?iticos e representativos em cada um dos per?odos evolutivos, bem como as respostas maternas aos gestos comunicativos do beb? e os contextos em que foram observados. Al?m disso, foram analisadas as atribui??es de significado maternas relativas aos gestos e demais comportamentos comunicativos do beb?, como choro, sorrisos e dire??o do olhar. Segundo a Perspectiva da Intera??o Social dos Estudiosos da Linguagem, aporte te?rico adotado por este estudo, o desenvolvimento da linguagem da crian?a ocorre por meio de intera??es estabelecidas com o adulto desde as idades iniciais. Considerando-se os beb?s como ativos desde o seu nascimento, estas intera??es s?o concebidas como bidirecionais, de modo que ambos os constituintes da d?ade atuam na modifica??o do contexto e dos comportamentos um do outro. Participaram do estudo seis d?ades, sendo quatro beb?s meninos e duas meninas. As seis d?ades foram filmadas longitudinalmente aos seis, nove e 12 meses de idade do beb?, sendo duas filmagens em cada per?odo evolutivo, totalizando 36 observa??es. Cada filmagem continha 20 minutos de observa??o da d?ade em situa??o de brincadeira livre e, deste total, foram transcritos dez minutos, desconsiderando-se os cinco minutos iniciais e os cinco minutos finais. A an?lise das filmagens foi feita por meio da transcri??o literal das falas e vocaliza??es da d?ade, bem como da descri??o detalhada do ambiente e dos comportamentos da m?e e do beb? durante as sess?es de observa??o. Este procedimento permitiu que, al?m do estabelecimento de categorias de gestos representativos e d?iticos e da posterior contagem de suas frequ?ncias, fosse realizada uma an?lise minuciosa dos contextos em que tais gestos foram utilizados. Os resultados demonstraram que, em especial aos nove meses, ocorrem mudan?as, de modo que o gesto d?itico de alcan?ar deixa de ser ?nica categoria utilizada pela crian?a e passa a ser substitu?do pelo gesto de apontar. Foi verificado tamb?m que os gestos representativos, tanto convencionais quanto de objeto, foram observados apenas a partir desta idade. Os gestos d?iticos mais utilizados no estabelecimento e manuten??o de epis?dios interativos foram o de alcan?ar, por parte dos beb?s, e o de mostrar, por parte das m?es. Al?m disso, comportamentos como choro, sorrisos e dire??o do olhar, que fazem parte da base da comunica??o pr?-verbal da crian?a, mostraram-se bastante eficazes para a mudan?a da conduta materna. Observou-se, portanto, que as m?es ajustaram o seu comportamento de acordo com as caracter?sticas dos beb?s, de modo que mudan?as nos gestos da crian?a ao longo do seu desenvolvimento foram acompanhadas por mudan?as nos gestos e nas atribui??es maternas. Tais resultados s?o relevantes no sentido que contribuem para um maior conhecimento acerca da comunica??o gestual m?e-beb? e do seu papel no desenvolvimento lingu?stico da crian?a. This study {{aimed to}} analyze the nonverbal communication of mother-infant dyads {{during the first year}} of life, specifically at six, nine and 12 months of age. The frequency with which mothers and babies used deictic and representational gestures in each stage was verified, as well as maternal responses to the <b>baby</b> <b>s</b> communicative gestures and the contexts in which they were observed. In addition, it was analyzed the maternal meaning attributions regarding to gestures and other <b>baby</b> <b>s</b> communicative behaviors, such as crying, smiling and gaze direction. According to the social interaction perspective, adopted by this study, the child's language development occurs through interactions established with the adult since the early ages. Considering that babies are active since birth, these interactions are designed to be bidirectional, so that both components of the dyad act in modifying the context and behavior of each other. The participants were six dyads, four baby boys and two girls. The six dyads were recorded longitudinally when babies were six, nine and 12 months old, twice in each evolutionary period, totaling 36 observations. Each video contained 20 minutes of observation of the dyad in a free play situation. Ten minutes were transcribed, disregarding the first five and the final five minutes. The videos were analyzed through the literal transcription of speech and vocalizations of the dyad, as well as the detailed description of the context and the behavior of the mother and baby during the observation sessions. In addition to establishing categories of deictic and representational gestures and subsequent counting their frequency, a detailed analysis of the contexts in which such gestures were used was performed. The results showed that changes occur, especially at nine months. The reaching gesture is no longer the single category used by the child and shall be replaced by the pointing gesture. It was also noticed that the representational gestures, both conventional and object gestures, were observed only after that age. The deictic gestures most used in the establishment and maintenance of interactive episodes were reaching, by the babies, and showing, by mothers. Furthermore, behaviors such as crying, smiling and gaze direction, which form part of the basis of child s pre-verbal communication, proved to be very effective in changing the mother s behavior. It was noticed that mothers adjusted their behavior according to the <b>baby</b> <b>s</b> characteristics, so that changes in the child gestures during its development were accompanied by changes in maternal gestures and meaning attributions. These results are relevant in the sense that contribute to a greater knowledge about mother-infant gestural communication and its role in the child's linguistic development...|$|R
