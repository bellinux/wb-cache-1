50|$|From {{the late}} 19th century {{through the early}} 20th, <b>blow-by</b> <b>gases</b> from {{internal}} combustion were allowed {{to find their own}} way out to the atmosphere past seals and gaskets. It was considered normal for oil to be found both inside and outside an engine, and for oil to drip to the ground in small but constant amounts. The latter had also been true for steam engines and steam locomotives in the decades before. Even bearing and valve designs generally made little to no provision for keeping oil or waste gases contained. Sealed bearings and valve covers were for special applications only. Gaskets and shaft seals were meant to limit loss of oil, but they were usually not expected to entirely prevent it. On internal combustion engines, the hydrocarbon-rich <b>blow-by</b> <b>gases</b> would diffuse through the oil in the seals and gaskets into the atmosphere. Engines with high amounts of blow-by (e.g., worn out ones, or ones not well built to begin with) would leak profusely via those routes.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A closed type {{crankcase}} ventilation system has been adopted to engines to prevent emission of <b>blow-by</b> <b>gas</b> to atmosphere. In the early closed type {{crankcase ventilation}} system, <b>blow-by</b> <b>gas</b> which contains engine lubricating oil is re-circulated into the intake system. The <b>blow-by</b> <b>gas</b> containing oil mist leads to increased harmful emissions and engine problems. To reduce loss of the engine oil, a highly-efficient oil separation device is required. Principle of a cyclone oil separator is to utilize centrifugal force in the separator and, therefore, oil separator designs depend on rotational flow which causes the centrifugal force. In this paper, flow characteristics and oil separation performances for cyclone type designs are calculated with CFD methodology. In the CFD model, oil particle was injected on a inlet surface with Rosin-Rammler distribution and uniform distribution. The major design parameters considered in the analysis model are inlet area, cone length and outlet depth of the oil separator. As results, reducing inlet area and increasing cone length increase oil separation performance. Changes in outlet depth could avoid interference betwee...|$|R

50|$|The V12's new {{management}} system {{was designed by}} Nippon Denso. The top aluminium cover in the engine's valley was redesigned to house two packs of three coils each, with each coil having two high-tension terminals {{for a total of}} twelve. These coilpacks were driven by two Denso ignition modules, which are very similar to Ford EDIS-6 units. The crankshaft in the V12 was switched from a forging to a chill casting. A visibly significant chromed pipe connecting {{the left and the right}} banks of the V12 in the XJ40 platform (intended to vent and route the crankcase <b>blow-by</b> <b>gas</b> to the intake plenum) was changed with the introduction of the X300 to an almost invisible design at the top center of the engine underneath a plastic cover that also hides fuel rails and coilpacks.|$|R
5000|$|In {{order to}} address the {{deficiencies}} of the air-cooled Norton Wankel engine, Garside went on to develop SPARCS (Self-Pressurising-Air Rotor Cooling System); [...] a system that utilises self-pressurising <b>blow-by</b> <b>gases</b> as a cooling medium, absorbing higher levels of heat from the engine core and dispersing the heat {{by means of an}} external heat exchanger. This system would go on to provide superior heat rejection than standard air cooling methods.|$|E
50|$|The first {{refinement}} in {{crankcase ventilation}} was the road draft tube, {{which is a}} pipe running from a high location contiguous to the crankcase (such as {{the side of the}} engine block, or the valve cover on an overhead valve engine) down to an open end facing down and located in the vehicle's slipstream. When the vehicle is moving, airflow across the open end of the tube creates a draft that pulls gases out of the crankcase. The high location of the engine end of the pipe minimises liquid oil loss. An air inlet path to the crankcase, called the breather and often incorporated into the oil filler cap, meant that when a draft was generated at the tube, fresh air swept through the crankcase to clear out the <b>blow-by</b> <b>gases.</b>|$|E
50|$|The early {{generation}} 1JZ-GTEs {{combined the}} inherent smoothness of an inline 6-cylinder engine with the revving capacity of its short stroke and early power delivery of its small, ceramic wheeled turbochargers. The ceramic turbine wheels {{are prone to}} delamination {{in the setting of}} high impeller rpm and local temperature conditions, usually a result of higher boost. The first generation 1JZs were even more prone to turbo failure due to there being a faulty one-way valve on the head, specifically on the intake cam cover causing <b>blow-by</b> <b>gases</b> to go into the intake manifold. On the exhaust side, a decent amount of oil vapor flows into the turbos causing premature wear on the seals. The later second generation engines had this problem fixed and in Japan there was actually a recall in order to repair the first generation engines, though that does not apply to 1JZs imported to other countries. The fix is simple, and involves replacement of the PCV valve (2JZ); all parts are available through Toyota.|$|E
40|$|Trouble-free {{operation}} of liquid rocket engines (LRE) depends, among other factors, on the nonstop {{supply of liquid}} rocket fuel components in the fuel tank feed line with continuous flow. This condition becomes especially relevant for the aerial vehicles (AV) in orbital (suborbital) environment. With a little filled fuel tanks discontinuity of flow may occur because of pressurizing <b>gas</b> <b>blow-by</b> in the feed line {{as a result of}} the funnel generation (with or without vortex formation) and so-called phenomenon of dynamic failure of the interface "liquid-gas”. The paper presents a mathematical model of the process of emptying tank initially a little filled and having a reduced level of the gravity acceleration. Using the developed mathematical model a parametric study has been conducted to find how stabilization rate of liquid flow effects on the volume of drained liquid. The computational experiment defines <b>gas</b> <b>blow-by</b> points in the feed line and propellant residuals, depending on the flow rate, physical properties of the fuel components, residual value of the acceleration, and diameter of the feed line. As a result, an effect is discovered that previously has been never mentioned in publications on research of the emptying processes of the aircraft fuel tanks, namely: with abrupt bootstrap of the flow rate a <b>blow-by</b> of <b>gas</b> occurs at the initial stage of emptying tank.

Because of the three wide equal width driving bands, the total bearing surface is greater than half the overall length of the bullet.

50|$|The pistons {{are short}} {{cylindrical}} parts which seal {{one end of}} the cylinder from the high pressure of the compressed air and combustion products and slide continuously within it while the engine is in operation. The top wall of the piston is termed its crown and is typically flat or concave. Some two-stroke engines use pistons with a deflector head. Pistons are open at the bottom and hollow except for an integral reinforcement structure (the piston web). When an engine is working the gas pressure in the combustion chamber exerts a force on the piston crown which is transferred through its web to a gudgeon pin. Each piston has rings fitted around its circumference that mostly prevent the gases from leaking into the crankcase or the oil into the combustion chamber. A ventilation system drives the small amount of gas that escape past the pistons during normal operation (the <b>blow-by</b> <b>gases)</b> out of the crankcase so that it does not accumulate contaminating the oil and creating corrosion. In two-stroke gasoline engines the crankcase is part of the air-fuel path and due to the continuous flow of it they do not need a separate crankcase ventilation system.|$|E

5000|$|When fitting new {{piston rings}} or {{breaking}} them in within an engine, {{the end gap}} is a crucial measurement. In order that a ring may be fitted into the [...] "grooves" [...] of the piston, it is not continuous but is broken at one point on its circumference. The ring gap may be checked by putting the ring into the bore/liner (squared to bore) and measuring with a feeler gauge.

Metals expand with a rise in temperature, so too small a gap may result in overlapping or bending when used under hot running conditions (racing, heavy loads, towing) and, even at normal temperatures, a small ring gap may lead to ring gap closure, ring breakage, bore damage and possible seizure of the piston. Too large a gap may give unacceptable compression and levels of <b>blow-by</b> <b>gases</b> or oil consumption. When being measured in a used bore, it may indicate excessive bore wear or ring wear.

40|$|The {{performance}} of the piston ring-pack is directly associated with the friction, oil consumption, wear, and blow-by in internal combustion engines. Because of non-axisymmetric characteristics of the power cylinder system, the {{performance of}} a ring varies along its circumference. Investigating these variations is of great interest for developing advanced ring-packs, but is out of the capabilities of the existing two-dimensional models. In this work, three separate but closely related numerical models were developed to study the {{performance of the}} piston ring-pack. The model for static analysis was developed to facilitate the design of piston rings. In this model, a finite beam element model is adopted with incorporation of a physics-based sub-model describing the interaction between the ring and the bore as well as the ring and the groove. A step-by-step approach is adopted to calculate the ring/bore and ring/groove conformability if the free shape of the ring is given. A method {{that can be used to}} determine the free shape as to achieve a specific tension distribution is also developed. Model results revealed the complex ring/bore and ring/groove interaction. A three-dimensional model for ring dynamics and <b>blow-by</b> <b>gas</b> flow was developed to address non-axisymmetric characteristics of the power cylinder system. In this model, the rings are discretized into straight beam elements. 3 -D finite element analysis is employed to address the structural response of each ring to external loads. Physics-based sub-models are developed to simulate each ring's interactions with the piston groove and the liner. The gas flows driven by the pressure difference along both the axial and circumferential directions are modeled as well. (cont.) This model predicts the inter-ring gas pressure and 3 -D displacements of the three rings at various circumferential locations. Model results show significant variations of the dynamic behavior along ring circumference. In the ring-pack lubrication model, an improved flow continuity algorithm is implemented in the ring/liner hydrodynamic lubrication, and proves to be very practicable. By coupling the ring/liner lubrication with the in-plane structural response of the ring, the lubrication along the entire ring circumference can be calculated. Model results show significant variations of lubrication along the circumference due to the non-axisymmetric characteristics of the power cylinder system. Bore distortion was found to have profound effects on oil transport along the liner. Particularly, it stimulates the occurrence of oil up-scraping by the top ring during compression stroke. Because the oil evaporation on the liner affects the liner oil film thickness, a sub-model for liner evaporation with consideration of multi-species oil is incorporated with the lubrication model. With consideration of oil transport along the liner, the prediction of evaporation is more precise. The combination of these models is a complete package for piston ring-pack analysis. It is computationally robust and efficient, and thus has appreciable practical value. by Liang Liu. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, 2005.

40|$|In {{recent decades}} much effort {{has gone into}} {{reducing}} particle emissions in the exhaust gases of heavy-duty diesel engines. Engine development has now reached the stage where it is worth to put heavy focus on the contribution of lubricating oil to particulate emissions {{in order to further}} reduce these emissions. A literature study demonstrates that the cylinder system is usually the largest source of oil-related particles. Oil consumption in the cylinder can be divided into throw-off effects when inertia forces act on the piston, piston rings and oil; evaporation from hot surfaces; reverse <b>blow-by</b> when <b>gas</b> pressure drives the oil consumption; and top land scraping when oil is scraped off the cylinder liner. The pressure between the compression rings strongly affects the stability and position of the upper compression ring as well as the oil consumption caused by the reverse blow-by. A method to measure the inter-ring pressure was developed and evaluated. The measurements showed that cycle-to-cycle variations were small, but that the inter-ring pressure varied over time. Calculations with AVL Excite Piston and Rings confirmed that ring gap positions can have a major influence on the inter-ring pressure. The measured particle size and number distributions at motoring conditions show interesting and unexpected results. The high number of particles with a diameter of around 100  nm was greatly reduced when the temperature in the diluter was increased. The mean number particle diameter decreased until 10  nm and then became stable independent of further temperature increase. Other authors have found that the small particles (nucleation mode) are reduced and the larger particles (accumulation mode) are more or less unaffected when exhaust gases are heated up and diluted.

50|$|The O-rings {{were two}} rubber rings that formed a seal between two {{sections}} of the SRBs. The {{sections of the}} boosters were joined using tang and clevis joints and the rings were intended to seal the joint, while allowing for the inevitable movement between the sections under flight conditions. By design, pressure from within the booster was to push a fillet of putty into the joint, forcing the O-ring into its seat. The system never functioned as designed. The rings were supposed {{to sit in a}} groove and seal the joint between the sections of the booster. It was found, however, that flight dynamics caused the joints in the SRBs to flex during launch, opening a gap through which rocket exhaust could escape. As the joints flexed, the rings would come out of their grooves and move to a new position in the joint, a process called extrusion. The extruded ring would form a seal in this new position, but during the time it took for the ring to shift, the joint was unsealed and hot gases could escape, a process called <b>blow-by.</b> These hot <b>gases</b> would damage the rings until the seal was achieved.|$|R

40|$|At {{compressor}} stations, fugitive methane {{emissions from}} compressor piston rod packing and engine crankcases are vented {{directly into the}} atmosphere. In {{an effort to reduce}} compression station carbon footprint, this study evaluates the feasibility of combusting the methane emissions into carbon dioxide and thus reduce the global warming potential. This study focuses on running simulations to determine the methane reduction from rebreathing engine crankcase and compressor vent gases into the air intake of a large bore, natural gas, 2 -stroke engine. The methane reduction percentage is observed over a range of rebreathed gas mass flow rates, and rebreathed gas composition. It is extremely difficult to determine the composition of the engine <b>blow-by</b> <b>gases</b> in the crankcase, since the composition depends on a large variety of parameters. For this study, the emissions from the compressor was modeled as methane, and the emissions from the engine crankcase was modeled as products of combustion with a varying amount of methane concentrations. A sensitivity analysis was performed, and the observed pressure traces show that the engine performance is not affected by the addition of rebreathed gases. This insensitivity mainly results from the very small rebreathed flow rates compared to the air intake, and the adjustments made on engine parameters, boost pressure and fuel injection rate, to keep TER and the energy delivery rate the same. The simulations also showed that the net methane reduction percentage was approximately 52 %, no matter the study test conditions. It was discovered that the methane reduction depends on the trapping ratio of the engine; since these engines generally have trapping ratios around 50 %, the actual methane reduction tends to be small. A 52 % reduction rate is not desirable; the hope is to increase the reduction rate closer to 100 %. More importantly to note, a substantial amount of complexity would need to be added to a typical compressor station just to reduce methane emissions by 1 kg/hr. Thus, at present, the idea of rebreathing compressor and engine crank case gases for methane emission reduction is not feasible. Future studies should focus on routing the emissions to a 4 -stroke engine, a waste heat recovery system, or other combustion devices with higher trapping ratios...|$|E

However, there is currently a lack of understanding of the fundamentals involving oil transport inside the power cylinder.

This work seeks to address some fundamental aspects of oil transport in the power cylinder through experiments and modeling. A two-dimensional multiple-dye Laser-Induced Fluorescence (LIF) visualization system was implemented in a spark-ignition engine. Real time images of oil distribution were acquired and analyzed for a multitude of operating conditions typically encountered by passenger car engines. Based on experimental observations, major oil flow patterns in the piston ring pack during transient operation were identified and characterized. Physically based models were used to describe and understand the fundamentals of the individual oil transport process. The work shows oil may enter the top ring groove under low load (high vacuum) conditions. After enough time at low load, the oil may interfere with the gas flow into the top ring groove. Thereafter, upon a transition to a higher engine load, the top ring may radially collapse, resulting in an extremely large increase of <b>blow-by</b> <b>gases.</b> Additional work was conducted studying oil transport from the piston to the cylinder liner during steady state conditions.

Thiokol even went as far as to persuade NASA to declare the O-ring problem [...] "closed".

A two-dimensional multiple-dye Laser-Induced Fluorescence (LIF) visualization system was successfully implemented in a diesel and a spark-ignition engine. Real time high resolution images of the ring pack oil distribution were acquired and analyzed for the entire range of operating conditions typically encountered by passenger car engines. Based on experimental observations, major oil flow patterns in the piston ring pack were identified and characterized. Physically based models were proposed to describe each individual oil transport process, such as, oil flows on the piston lands in both axial and circumferential directions and oil flows through the ring grooves and gaps. Modeling results showed good agreement with the experimental data. (cont.) Then, using the individual oil transport models, the contributions of the different oil transport mechanisms to oil flow in and between the piston regions and the effects of piston and ring designs were analyzed. Finally, a global oil transport scheme was presented by integrating all major paths and mechanisms of oil transport along the piston. It highlighted that the rate at which oil is lost to the combustion chamber is mostly determined by the competing oil transport processes occurring on the piston lands.

This study provides for development and test verification of analysis methods used for flow-thermal modeling of a CFR thermal barrier subject to fault conditions such as rope combustion <b>gas</b> <b>blow-by</b> and CFR splice failure. Global model development is based on a 1 -D (one dimensional) transient volume filling approach where the flow conditions are calculated as a function of internal 'pipe' and porous media 'Darcy' flow correlations. Combustion gas flow rates are calculated for the CFR on a per-linear inch basis and solved simultaneously with a detailed thermal-gas dynamic model of a local region of gas blow by (or splice fault). Effects of gas compressibility, friction and heat transfer are accounted for the model. Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) solutions of the fault regions are used to characterize the local flow field, quantify the amount of free jet spreading and assist in the determination of impingement film coefficients on the nozzle housings. Gas to wall heat transfer is simulated by a large thermal finite element grid of the local structure. The employed numerical technique loosely couples the FE (Finite Element) solution with the gas dynamics solution of the faulted region. All free constants that appear in the governing equations are calibrated by hot fire sub-scale test. The calibrated model is used to make flight predictions using motor aft end environments and timelines.

40|$|The need of {{exploiting}} the offshore oil reserves {{and reducing the}} equipment costs becomes the motivation for developing new compact separation techniques. In the past years, the development of compact separators has almost solely focused on the cyclonic type separators made of pipes, because of their simple construction, relatively low cost of manufacturing {{and being able to}} withstand high pressures. Considerable effort has been put into the separator test program and qualification, and consequently notable advances in the compact separation technique have been made. However the application has been held back due to lacking of reliable predicting and design tools. The objectives of this study were threefold. Firstly, an experimental study was carried out aiming at understanding the separation process and flow behaviours in a compact separator, named Pipe-SEP, operating at high inlet gas volume fraction (GVF). Secondly it is to gain insight of the gas and liquid droplet flow in the compact separator by means of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. Last but not least, the understanding and insight gained above were used to develop a comprehensive performance predictive model, based on which, a reliable optimizing design procedure is suggested.

As a result the ring is meant to conform closely to the cylinder surface which promotes increased friction. The compression ring is subjected to combustion pressure loading, ring tension, varying inertial force and friction. It is a slender ring of low mass, thus undergoes complex elastodynamic behaviour, when subjected to a multitude of forces. These motions occur in the ring’s radial in-plane and axial out-of-plane dynamics, which comprise flutter, ring axial jump, compression-extension, ring twist and rotational drag. An implication of these motions can be loss of sealing, <b>gas</b> <b>blow-by,</b> loss of power and lubricant degradation/oil loss, to name but a few. Consequently, understanding and accurately predicting ring dynamic behaviour under transient conditions is an important step in any subsequent modelling for evaluation of cylinder system efficiency. There have been a plethora of investigations for ring dynamics, often decoupling the ring behaviour in its in-plane and out-of-plane motions. This approach disregards any transfer of dynamic energy from one degree of freedom to another which is only applicable to rectangular ring cross-sections. Alternatively, there are computationally intensive approaches such as finite element analysis (FEA) which are not conducive for inclusion in any subsequent system level engine modelling where ring response alters in an instantaneous manner. This would require embedded FEA within a transient analysis. This paper presents a finite difference numerical analysis for coupled in-plane and out-of-plane motions of compression rings with practical cross-sectional geometries, which are mostly not rectangular. The formulated method can be integrated into a system level transient cyclic analysis of ring-bore contact. The presented approach takes into account the energy transfer between different degrees of freedom. The predictions are validated against precise non-contact measurements of ring elastodynamic behaviour under amplitude-frequency sweeps. This approach has not hitherto been reported in literature and constitutes the main contribution of the paper...|$|R
40|$|Advances {{in modern}} engine {{development}} {{are becoming more}} and more challenging. The intense increase of thermal and mechanical loads as a result of higher power density requires perfecting the function of all engine components especially with regard to emission and friction reduction. In particular, piston rings pack represent one of the most important cause of mechanical friction loss in internal combustion engine [1], and inadequate ring-liner lubrication leads to high fuel/oil consumption and increased engine emissions with dramatic impact over the entire system efficiency. A desirable piston ring-pack set has to provide efficient sealing performance with both the cylinder wall in a radial direction and the top or bottom sides of the piston ring housing in an axial direction, leading to minimal <b>gas</b> <b>blow-by,</b> oil consumption and friction loss. Moreover piston ring other requirement are low friction, low wear and good resistance against mechanical/thermal fatigue. This is a challenging task due to the nature of the phenomena and interactions associated with piston rings. For example, increasing the installed ring tension, which is a method to control oil consumption, also tends to increase ring friction. Hence, any attempt to optimize ring-pack performance output parameters requires a good understanding of the dynamics of all the involved components. Different key elements have to be considered: the ring shape in its free state (namely free shape), the ring crossing-section geometry and the contact surface profile, which play important roles in determining the ring behavior. In order to achieve sealing, the piston rings are first held against the cylinder liner in its front face by their tension after being installed into the cylinder bore. The contact pressure on the cylinder wall is achieved by the inherent spring force of the ring in conjunction with the gas pressure behind the ring. During different engine operating conditions, the piston rings experience dynamically changing forces and axial as well as radial movements of the rings can occur. The contact on the side of the piston housing is achieved by the axial forces acting on the ring. The axial forces are composed of the gas pressure above and under the ring, the mass forces (inertia), and the friction forces. These forces change their direction during the cycle, and, as a result, the piston ring moves from one side of the groove to the other during the engine cycle. This is known as ring fluttering when the axial movement becomes excessive. This behavior open an additional gas flow path: gas can flow around the inner diameter of the ring which results in very high engine blow-by loss. In addition the ring pack design should also consider other factors, including gas blowback and, as said before, ring pack friction. The blowback is the reverse process of blowby and is highly related to engine emission and oil consumption while ring friction can cause severe ring and cylinder wall wear, which results in the ring losing its sealing capability. These factors are related to the ring circumferential pressure distribution, which is defined by the ring free shape and the ring cross section geometry. The understanding of the piston ring behavior is an hard challenge for automotive engineer. Firstly, in 1936 Castleman [2] investigated and proposed the concept of hydrodynamic lubrication for the piston ring. Thereafter, more and more research has been done in this field. Dowson et al. [3] predicted the behavior of a piston ring using the EHL theory. Sun [4] conducted his study for ring-bore conformability, in which the ring was modeled as a curved beam under in-plane loads. Liu and Tian [5, 6] developed an FEA tool for piston ring design. Ejakov et al. [7] modeled ring twist behavior predicting ring axial, radial displacements, bending and twisting angles along the ring periphery over an engine cycle. In this contributions a complete 3 D model of the piston ring is proposed, and the influence of an important parameter like the twist angle of the piston ring section on both ring-liner and ring-piston groove interaction is investigated...|$|R
