40|$|The {{course of}} the river, the {{topography}} of the valley and the river regime are determinants of spatial composition of the city, as well as development {{and nature of the}} city’s structure (eg building on river terraces, no or temporary constructions on floodplains etc.). Second important factor shaping the spatial and functional arrangement of cities located on rivers is the accessibility to waters. Analyzing the land use plans of chosen Baltic riverside port cities (Lübeck [9], Szczecin [10], Gdańsk [11]) one could distinguish two or three functional zones (I, II, III.) existing along the river. The first two zones are closed and are not accessible to the public. The first zone (I) is created by spatial objects whose function enforces the waterside location. These are usually: the port terminals, industrial plants, and energy plants, which have to use raw materials and intermediate products delivered by water transport. Mostly, zone I is continuous, and is interrupted only by transport passageways (arterial road, tracks), river crossings (bridgeheads, check ferry), or infrastructure objects (e. g. wastewater treatment plant). If zone I is divided into particular sections, it is usually greenery which separates them. Residential development located directly {{on the banks of the}} river is relatively rare outside the downtown. Zone II is designed to support or to co-operate with the first zone. It usually consist of <b>back-up</b> <b>infrastructure</b> (eg energy facilities, water supply facilities, machine base), transport-logistics objects (such as logistic centers, railway sidings, parking lots for a truck route, container depot etc.) and industrial objects (eg factories providing services for freight). Zone II is more or less parallel to th...|$|E
