5|$|Before the {{construction}} of the causeway, the Petitcodiac River was home to many aquatic species. Fish originally included hundreds of thousands of Atlantic tomcod and rainbow smelt, tens of thousands of gaspereau and American shad, thousands of American eel, Atlantic salmon, brook trout, lamprey, and striped bass and hundreds of Atlantic sturgeon. Other fish include the <b>blueback</b> <b>herring,</b> the brown bullhead, the chain pickerel, the smallmouth bass, the white perch, and the white sucker. Marine mammals were uncommon, but normally consisted of pilot whales, Atlantic white-sided dolphins, harbour porpoise, harbour seals, and porbeagles. Freshwater mollusc species included the brook floater, the dwarf wedgemussel, the eastern ellipto, the eastern floater, the eastern pearlshell, and the triangle floater. Many other aquatic organisms are thought to have once entered the watershed due to the low salinity of the water.|$|E
5|$|Lake Phelps and the Scuppernong River {{are both}} open for fishing. The North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission (NCWRC) has {{established}} fishing regulations, such as catch and length limits, that {{are meant to}} enhance sport fisheries in public waters such as Lake Phelps and the Scuppernong River. The NCWRC has had regulations in place at Pettigrew State Park since 2002. The regulations specify that anglers may keep largemouth bass that are greater than 20inches (50.8cm) or between 14 and 16inches (35.6-40.6cm). This rule {{was put in place}} {{to increase the number of}} tropy fish, fish over 20inches (50.8cm). Additionally the NCWRC stocks Lake Phelps with bluegill and they have begun a program to reintroduce alewife and <b>blueback</b> <b>herring</b> via fish ladder on Bee Tree Canal from the Scuppernong River.|$|E
25|$|Though the {{population}} of striped bass was growing and repopulating in the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s, a study executed by the Wildlife and Fisheries Program at West Virginia University found that {{the rapid growth of}} the striped bass population was exerting a tremendous pressure on its prey (river herring, shad, and <b>blueback</b> <b>herring).</b> This pressure on their food source was putting their own population at risk due to {{the population}} of prey naturally not coming back to the same spawning areas.|$|E
500|$|Route308 {{begins at}} US9 in the Dutchess County village of Rhinebeck, at about [...] in elevation. To {{the south is}} the American Legion Park, a small lake, and the Rhinebeck Cemetery. In {{the center of the}} village is the Rhinebeck, New York U.S. Post Office, which is {{situated}} very close to the US9/ NY308 intersection. The Post Office was established in 1940, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. At this point, the Dutchess County Fairgrounds are located just to the north of Route308. The highway proceeds eastward on East Market Street, soon exiting Rhinebeck while it runs parallel to the Landsman Kill River, a minor tributary of the Hudson River, which is sometimes known as Landsman Kill or Landsmankill. The Landsman Kill has numerous spawning runs of smelt, alewife, and <b>blueback</b> <b>herring.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>blueback</b> <b>herring</b> or {{blueback shad}} (Alosa aestivalis) is an {{anadromous}} species of herring {{from the east}} coast of North America, with a range from Nova Scotia to Florida. <b>Blueback</b> <b>herring</b> form schools and are believed to migrate offshore to overwinter near the bottom.|$|E
50|$|Deal is a {{freshwater}} lake, but {{is unique}} {{because it has}} spawning saltwater fish, including alewives, <b>blueback</b> <b>herring</b> and gizzard shad.|$|E
5000|$|There is a {{commercial}} [...] "river herring" [...] fishery {{in the river}} (Alewife and <b>Blueback</b> <b>herring),</b> which employs dip nets and fixed gill nets.|$|E
50|$|The fish {{targeted}} for upstream passage at the Rahway River Water Supply Dam are alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus), <b>blueback</b> <b>herring</b> (Alosa aestivalis), gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum), white perch (Morone Americana) and the endangered American eel (Anguilla rostrate). Alewife and <b>blueback</b> <b>herring</b> are collectively {{referred to as}} river herring due to their similarity in appearance, range, and life histories. River herring, gizzard shad, and white perch are all anadromous (adults spawn in freshwater; juveniles migrate to saltwater); whereas American eel are catadromous (adults spawn in the ocean; the young migrate to freshwater habitats).|$|E
50|$|Fish {{seen in the}} Waquoit Bay and its {{connecting}} waters include <b>blueback</b> <b>herring,</b> brook trout, rainbow trout, golden shiner, banded killifish, {{and northern}} pipefish. Arthropods present include the blue crab, hermit crab, and barnacles.|$|E
50|$|The Native Americans and {{settlers}} {{used the}} Malden River for recreation and commercial purposes. Alewife and <b>blueback</b> <b>herring</b> were once caught in this river with nets {{and used for}} consumption. Shipbuilding also occurred along the Malden River.|$|E
50|$|A varied {{fish fauna}} {{includes}} <b>blueback</b> <b>herring,</b> blackspotted stickleback, American eel and a southern population of Greenland cod. A feral population of rainbow trout {{is present in}} the bay as well. These support strong populations of great blue heron, double-crested cormorant, and bald eagle.|$|E
50|$|This {{river is}} a {{significant}} clam fishery. Some of the migratory fishes in the river include alewives, <b>blueback</b> <b>herring</b> (together called river herring), American eels (the juveniles called elvers or glass eels), rainbow smelt and striped bass. Two other notable species are the horseshoe crab and quahog clam.|$|E
50|$|The Central New England Fishery Resource Office is {{involved}} in programs to restore, enhance, and manage a number of migratory fish species and the habitats they depend upon. Species of primary concern include American shadalewife, <b>blueback</b> <b>herring,</b> Atlantic salmon and American eel. Programs include fish population assessments, hatchery product evaluations, habitat restoration, fish trap and transfer, and movement studies.|$|E
50|$|Today, a {{fish ladder}} {{provides}} access to upstream spawning habitat {{as part of a}} system of fish passages that provide access up to river mile 20. The high concentrations of <b>blueback</b> <b>herring</b> and alewife below the dam in the spring make it a popular fishing spot for herring gulls, great black-backed gulls, great blue herons, night herons and cormorants.|$|E
50|$|The <b>blueback</b> <b>herring</b> is a U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service Species of Concern. Species of Concern {{are those}} species about which the U.S. Government’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Marine Fisheries Service, has some {{concerns}} regarding status and threats, but for which insufficient {{information is available}} to indicate a need to list the species under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA).|$|E
50|$|Another fish is the alewife and its cousin, the <b>blueback</b> <b>herring,</b> collectively {{known as}} river herring or simply herring. Both migrate {{from the ocean}} into the fresh water of the Malden River every spring to spawn. Striped bass, a prized {{saltwater}} fish, also {{come in from the}} ocean to spawn and prey on the herring. Other fish, like bluegill, largemouth bass, and catfish, are less common.|$|E
50|$|Even today, {{it remains}} one of the few managed herring runs in Massachusetts, {{although}} few fish reach the river's spawning and nursery habitat. It includes 570 acre of water bodies that could serve as habitat to alewife, <b>blueback</b> <b>herring,</b> and American shad. Approximately 36% of this habitat is in Halfway Pond. Fishway retrofit projects aim to restore river herring population to historic levels, perhaps as many as 100,000+ fish annually.|$|E
50|$|Historically, {{anadromous}} spawning runs of alewife, <b>blueback</b> <b>herring,</b> striped bass, and American shad and catadromous runs of American eel {{were common}} in the NYC/NJ harbor estuary. However, poor stream conditions and an increased number of obstacles to upstream migration, like tide gates, culverts, and dams, have reduced these species’ migration opportunities. Restoring fish passage on major tributaries like the Rahway can be accomplished {{through the construction of}} fish ladders.|$|E
50|$|<b>Blueback</b> <b>herring</b> spawn {{from late}} March through mid-May, {{depending}} on latitude. Females usually mature by age five and produce between 60,000 and 103,000 eggs. Males generally mature earlier at between 3 and 4 {{years of age}} and at a smaller size than the females. For both species, adults migrate quickly downstream after spawning and little is known about their life history while in the marine environment; however, they are believed to be capable of migrating long distances (over 1900 km).|$|E
50|$|Though the {{population}} of striped bass was growing and repopulating in the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s, a study executed by the Wildlife and Fisheries Program at West Virginia University found that {{the rapid growth of}} the striped bass population was exerting a tremendous pressure on its prey (river herring, shad, and <b>blueback</b> <b>herring).</b> This pressure on their food source was putting their own population at risk due to {{the population}} of prey naturally not coming back to the same spawning areas.|$|E
50|$|Archeological {{evidence}} suggests that Watertown was inhabited {{for thousands of years}} before the arrival of settlers from England. Two tribes of Massachusett, the Pequossette and the Nonantum, had settlements {{on the banks of the}} river later called the Charles. The Pequossette built a fishing weir to trap herring at the site of the current Watertown Dam. The annual fish migration, as both alewife and <b>blueback</b> <b>herring</b> swim upstream from their adult home in the sea to spawn in the fresh water where they were hatched, still occurs every spring.|$|E
50|$|Middleborough {{was once}} a large {{producer}} of shoes and is still home to the Alden Shoe Company, {{one of the last}} remaining shoe manufacturers in America. The local Maxim Motors manufactured fire engines from 1914-1989. Middleborough has since become the cranberry capital of the world, hosting the corporate headquarters of Ocean Spray Cranberries. Notable sights include the 1870s Victorian-style town hall, the Beaux Art style town library (1903), and in the spring, the Nemasket River alewife and <b>blueback</b> <b>herring</b> run upstream to the Assawompset Ponds complex to spawn.|$|E
50|$|The {{three mile}} stretch of Stockport Creek holds {{important}} spawning {{ground for the}} Hudson River's anadromous fish such as <b>Blueback</b> <b>Herring,</b> Alewives, Striped Bass, American Shad, White Perch, Smelt, Atlantic Sturgeon and Shortnose Sturgeon. Some spawning fish travel as far up to spawn as Claverack and Kinderhook creek. The tidal mudflats and littoral zones {{at the mouth of}} the river also host feeding grounds for Striped bass. They also act as a nursery area for juvenile migratory fishes. There is a large concentration of smallmouth bass in Stockport creek.|$|E
50|$|Coastal marshes, bays, tidal creeks, {{and rivers}} support diverse {{shellfish}} and finfish populations. Sunfish (Lepomis species), creek chub (Semotilus atromaculatus), cunner (Tautogolabrus adspersus), golden shiner (Notemigonus crysoleucas), common mummichog (Fundulus heteroclitus), American eel (Anguilla rostrata), and white sucker (Catostomus commersoni) abound. Brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) and brown trout (Salmo trutta) are stocked in rivers and estuaries each year. The Ogunquit River sustains alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus), <b>blueback</b> <b>herring</b> (Alosa aestivalis), pollock (Pollachius virens), bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix), longhorn sculpin (Myoxocephalus octodecimspinosus), and winter flounder (Pleuronectes americanus). The Webhannet River has native {{species such as}} winter flounder, northern pipefish (Syngnathus fuscus), Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus), common mummichog, Atlantic silversides (Menidia menidia) and Atlantic mackerel. The Merriland River sustains populations of American eel, brown trout, and brook trout. The Mousam River attracts little skate (Raja erinacea), American shad (Alosa sapidissima), striped bass (Morone saxatilis), bluefish, cunner, Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus), pollock, and rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax). The Spurwink River supports <b>blueback</b> <b>herring,</b> Atlantic menhaden (Brevoortia tyrannus), American shad, pollock, cunner, winter flounder, and little skate. Striped bass and brown trout are popular recreational fishing resources in the area. The National Marine Fisheries Service has designated as “essential fish habitat” areas that provide substrate necessary for fish spawning, breeding, feeding, or growth to maturity. Estuaries within the refuge boundaries are part of that essential fish habitat.|$|E
50|$|According to the Sebasticook Regional Land Trust:The Sebasticook River is {{the largest}} {{tributary}} (985 square miles) to the Kennebec and thus {{plays an important role}} in the restoration of both the anadromous and resident aquatic fisheries of the Kennebec basin and the Gulf of Maine ecosystem. Due to its relatively close proximity to the lower Kennebec, large drainage area, and low gradient, this watershed historically contributed a major percentage of available spawning and nursery habitat for anadromous runs of alewife, <b>blueback</b> <b>herring,</b> American shad, rainbow smelt, and striped bass associated with the Kennebec River watershed and Gulf of Maine ecosystems. To a lesser extent, the river provided habitat for Atlantic salmon.|$|E
50|$|The Mullica River {{is noted}} as a {{spawning}} ground for striped bass. <b>Blueback</b> <b>herring</b> make a spring spawning {{run up the}} river and its tributaries. Freshwater portions are also home to healthy populations of white catfish, pickerel, white perch, crappie, white sucker, and largemouth bass. Brackish and saltwater portions of the river are inhabited by weakfish, winter flounder, bluefish, American eel, and summer flounder. Blue claw crabs are prevalent in the lower reaches {{of the river and}} in tributaries flowing through the surrounding salt marshes. These tidal creeks also support populations of the northern diamondback terrapin, which is listed by the federal government as a species of special concern.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} species of {{anadromous}} and catadromous fish, including brook trout, winter flounder, <b>blueback</b> <b>herring,</b> alewife, rainbow trout, large brown trout, American shad (Alosa sapidissima), hickory shad, smallmouth bass, Atlantic sturgeon, striped bass (Morone saxatilis), carp, catfish, American eel, sea lamprey, and endangered shortnose sturgeon and dwarf wedgemussels. Additionally, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service has repopulated the river with another species of migratory fish, the Atlantic salmon, which for more than 200 years had been extinct from the river due to damming. Several fish ladders and fish elevators have been built to allow fish to resume their natural migration upriver each spring.|$|E
50|$|Assessments of fish {{communities}} {{throughout the}} Chesapeake Bay system by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources find the Mattawoman estuary {{to be the}} most productive of sampled tributaries for migratory fish. Especially abundant are anadromous alewife, <b>blueback</b> <b>herring</b> and American shad and semi-anadromous white and yellow perch. The largemouth bass, a resident gamefish that supports an active recreational fishery in the tidal freshwater Potomac River and its tributaries, also achieves high concentrations in the estuary. On the basis of fish assessments, Maryland fisheries biologists have concluded that Mattawoman represents as near to ideal conditions as {{can be found in the}} northern Chesapeake Bay, perhaps unattainable in other systems, and should be protected from overdevelopment.|$|E

50|$|A {{sizeable}} herring run was {{an important}} food source for Weymouth's citizens as documented in town records as early as 1648. At Iron Hill Park off Iron Hill Street, Whitman's Pond was dammed to turn the machines which processed the natural bog iron for the Weymouth Iron Works. Later, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts installed a herring ladder to allow the herring to bypass the dam on their spawning runs. Historically the herring ran to Whitman's Pond, and beyond up Mill River and Swamp River, to Great Pond. River herring commonly refers to two species, <b>Blueback</b> <b>herring</b> (Alosa aestivalis) and alewife ((Alosa pseudoharengus)). Today, 1/2 million river herring and Rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) run up the river each year to spawn (although they {{are not able to}} ascend the fish ladders and only utilize the tidal portions of the river).|$|E
50|$|Before the {{construction}} of the causeway, the Petitcodiac River was home to many aquatic species. Fish originally included hundreds of thousands of Atlantic tomcod and rainbow smelt, tens of thousands of gaspereau and American shad, thousands of American eel, Atlantic salmon, brook trout, lamprey, and striped bass and hundreds of Atlantic sturgeon. Other fish include the <b>blueback</b> <b>herring,</b> the brown bullhead, the chain pickerel, the smallmouth bass, the white perch, and the white sucker. Marine mammals were uncommon, but normally consisted of pilot whales, Atlantic white-sided dolphins, harbour porpoise, harbour seals, and porbeagles. Freshwater mollusc species included the brook floater, the dwarf wedgemussel, the eastern ellipto, the eastern floater, the eastern pearlshell, and the triangle floater. Many other aquatic organisms are thought to have once entered the watershed due to the low salinity of the water.|$|E
50|$|At one time, the Mystic River {{was home}} to great numbers of many species of fish, {{including}} salmon, alewife, <b>blueback</b> <b>herring,</b> striped bass, bluefish, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, bluegill, carp, and more. Although most of these species {{still live in the}} Mystic River, pollution and dam building have severely damaged the populations. Pollution came from various mills and a small ship building yard in the past. The main source of pollution in the 20th century and into the present is from drainage from cities and towns in the watershed. Many of the records of nearby drainage pipes have been lost, or have undocumented changes and diversions. Once described as having so many herring that one could cross the river on their backs, the Mystic River herring run is much smaller than it was in historic times. Pollution has raised bacteria levels and turbidity, making it unfavorable for fish to live in.|$|E
50|$|Route 308 {{begins at}} US 9 in the Dutchess County village of Rhinebeck, at about 200 ft in elevation. To {{the south is}} the American Legion Park, a small lake, and the Rhinebeck Cemetery. In {{the center of the}} village is the Rhinebeck, New York U.S. Post Office, which is {{situated}} very close to the US 9 / NY 308 intersection. The Post Office was established in 1940, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. At this point, the Dutchess County Fairgrounds are located just to the north of Route 308. The highway proceeds eastward on East Market Street, soon exiting Rhinebeck while it runs parallel to the Landsman Kill River, a minor tributary of the Hudson River, which is sometimes known as Landsman Kill or Landsmankill. The Landsman Kill has numerous spawning runs of smelt, alewife, and <b>blueback</b> <b>herring.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Shads {{are thought}} to be unique among the fishes in having evolved an ability to detect {{ultrasound}} (sound at frequencies above 20 kHz, which is the limit of human hearing). [...] This was first discovered by fisheries biologists studying a type of shad known as <b>blueback</b> <b>herring,</b> and was later verified in laboratory studies of hearing in American shad. This ability is thought to help them avoid dolphins that find prey using echolocation. Alosa species are generally pelagic. They are mostly anadromous or semianadromous with the exception of strictly freshwater landlocked species. Alosa species are generally migratory and schooling fish. Males usually mature about a year before females; they spawn in the late spring to summer. Most individuals die shortly after spawning. Alosa species are seemingly very adaptive vertebrates, so can change readily to adapt to their environments, as species are found in a variety of temperatures and waters.|$|E
50|$|In {{fisheries}} management, stock {{refers to}} a harvested or managed unit of a fish. Typically stocks are divided based on geographical location and not based on individual population. Spanish mackerel are distributed from Maine to the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. They are divided into two stocks, based on whether they migrate northward along the eastern United States coast or if they migrate into the Gulf of Mexico. Each stock of Spanish mackerel does not represent discrete populations. Stocks are not always composed of a single species. Stocks can be composed of multiple species due to their being harvested together or {{as a form of}} convenience for managers. An example of a multispecies stock is river herring. Alewives and <b>blueback</b> <b>herring</b> are labeled as river herring for management purposes due to their similar physical appearances and being harvested together. Individuals within a stock are subdivided into cohorts. A cohort is a group of fish born in the same year within a population or stock.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} marine {{fish in the}} Sound include porgy, butterfish, winter flounder, summer flounder, {{windowpane}} flounder, fourspot flounder, northern and striped sea robin, little skate, menhaden, Atlantic silversides, black seabass, blackfish (tautog), cunner, bluefish, and smooth dogfish. Frequently Atlantic bonito and false albacore, both members of the tuna family, enter the sound and can be caught by anglers from small boats and shore. Many species have declined rapidly since 1975 due to over fishing. Winter flounder may not be currently present except for rare, small local populations. Tautog and summer flounder are also less numerous. Anadromous fishes include striped bass, white perch, alewives, <b>blueback</b> <b>herring,</b> and American and hickory shad. Although several shark species likely infrequently wander {{in and out of}} the Sound, e.g. blue shark, mako shark, hammerhead shark & thresher shark, there are only four species of sharks which are regularly found in the area. These are the sand tiger shark, the sandbar shark, the spiny dogfish and the smooth dogfish.|$|E
