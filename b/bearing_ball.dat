5000|$|Grease {{fittings}} are {{permanently installed}} by either a (taper) thread or straight push-fit ('hammer in') arrangement, leaving a nipple connection that a grease gun attaches to. The pressure {{supplied by the}} grease gun forces a small captive <b>bearing</b> <b>ball</b> in the fitting to move back against the force of its retaining spring. The arrangement is thus essentially a valve that opens under pressure to allow lubricant to pass through a channel and be forced into the voids of the bearing. When the pressure ceases, the ball returns to its closed position. The ball excludes dirt and functions as a check valve to prevent grease escaping {{back out of the}} fitting. The ball is almost flush with the surface of the fitting {{so that it can be}} wiped clean to reduce the amount of debris carried with the grease into the bearing.|$|E

5000|$|Most pens today {{use either}} a piston filler, squeeze-bar filler or cartridge. Many pens are also {{compatible}} with a converter, {{which has the}} same fitting as the pen's cartridge and has a filling mechanism and a reservoir attached to it. This enables a pen to either fill from cartridges, or from a bottle of ink. The {{most common type of}} converters are piston-style, but many other varieties may be found today.Piston-style converters generally have a transparent round tubular ink reservoir. Fountain pen inks feature differing surface tensions that can cause an ink to adhere or [...] "stick" [...] against the inside of the reservoir. Common solutions for this problem are adding a small (rust-proof) ink agitating object like a 316 or 904L stainless steel or zirconium dioxide <b>bearing</b> <b>ball,</b> spring or hollow tube in the tubular reservoir to mechanically promote free movement of the contained ink and ink/air exchange during writing. Adding a very small amount of surfactant like Triton X-100 used in Kodak Photo-Flo 200 wetting agent to the ink will chemically promote free movement of the contained ink and ink/air exchange during writing. However ink might react adversely to adding a surfactant.|$|E
