5|$|Bond {{occasionally}} supplements his {{alcohol consumption}} {{with the use}} of other drugs, for both functional and recreational reasons: Moonraker sees Bond consume a quantity of the amphetamine <b>benzedrine</b> accompanied by champagne, before his bridge game with Sir Hugo Drax (also consuming a carafe of vintage Riga vodka and a vodka martini); he also uses the drug for stimulation on missions, such as swimming across Shark Bay in Live and Let Die, or remaining awake and alert when threatened in the Dreamy Pines Motor Court in The Spy Who Loved Me.|$|E
5|$|Seventeen {{hours after}} lifting off at sunrise in Japan, the men {{began to see}} the sun rise again over the Yukon—it was a very short day for them, and none had been able to sleep for the {{excitement}} of the trip, the stimulant <b>benzedrine,</b> and the penetrating cold. Crossing into Canada, the headwinds grew stronger still, and a load of hard rime ice and clear ice was visible on the wings. Though the B-29s had been delivered to the war front complete with deicing equipment, such gear had been removed months before to reduce weight and therefore increase combat range and speed. The ice load picked up in the night would have to be endured until it melted off at lower altitudes.|$|E
5|$|Several {{currently}} prescribed amphetamine formulations contain both enantiomers, including Adderall, AdderallXR, Mydayis, , DyanavelXR, and Evekeo, {{the last}} of which contains racemic amphetamine sulfate. Amphetamine is also prescribed in enantiopure and prodrug form as dextroamphetamine and lisdexamfetamine respectively. Lisdexamfetamine is structurally different from amphetamine, and is inactive until it metabolizes into dextroamphetamine. The free base of racemic amphetamine was previously available as <b>Benzedrine,</b> Psychedrine, and Sympatedrine. Levoamphetamine was previously available as Cydril. Many current amphetamine pharmaceuticals are salts due to the comparatively high volatility of the free base. However, oral suspension and orally disintegrating tablet (ODT) dosage forms composed of the free base were introduced in 2015 and 2016, respectively. Some of the current brands and their generic equivalents are listed below.|$|E
5|$|The Commandoes Mob {{was formed}} in 2004 {{when a group of}} Gattaca females teamed up with a Young Ones roving coalition. Aragorn and Zorilla {{established}} dominance after several disputes. They remained the dominant pair till 2007 when Aragorn died. After the death of Aragorn, his son Ketamine established natal dominance beside his mother. Then five Whiskers males emigrated and all natal adult males had left, Zarathustra became dominant male till he was predated. Then Baker took his position but Miles stole it from him. Throuought their history, the Commandos had been a fast-growing group, unlike their founding group the Gattaca. In January 2009, Zorilla, Miles, Baker Karim and Cody were killed by TB, the group is led by Whiskers male Panthro and Commandos female Celidh. Disease hit the group killing a few members. The Commandos left the monitored area and could no longer be tracked. A few new groups were formed from Commandos members. The Kung Fu was formed by Zorilla's sister. The Geckos and Sequioa were formed by Zorilla and Aragorn's daughters. <b>Benzedrine</b> is the last known surviving Commandos meerkat today.|$|E
25|$|He {{was also}} {{prescribed}} <b>Benzedrine,</b> the wonder drug of the 1950s. Regarded {{then as a}} harmless stimulant, {{it belongs to the}} family of drugs called amphetamines, and at that time they were prescribed and used in a very casual way. Among the side effects of <b>Benzedrine</b> are insomnia, restlessness, and mood swings, all of which Eden suffered during the Suez Crisis; indeed, earlier in his premiership he complained of being kept awake at night by the sound of motor scooters. Eden's drug use is now commonly agreed to {{have been a part of}} the reason for his bad judgment while Prime Minister.|$|E
25|$|Witt's {{research}} was discontinued, {{but it became}} reinvigorated in 1984 after a paper by J.A. Nathanson in the journal Science, which is discussed below. In 1995, a NASA research group repeated Witt's experiments {{on the effect of}} caffeine, <b>benzedrine,</b> marijuana and chloral hydrate on European garden spiders. NASA's results were qualitatively similar to those of Witt, but the novelty was that the pattern of the spider web was quantitatively analyzed with modern statistical tools, and proposed as a sensitive method of drug detection.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{members of}} the Beat Generation used {{a number of different}} drugs, including alcohol, marijuana, <b>benzedrine,</b> morphine, and later psychedelic drugs such as peyote, Ayahuasca, and LSD. They often approached drugs experimentally, initially being unfamiliar with their effects; their drug use was broadly inspired by intellectual interest and many Beat writers felt their drug experiences enhanced creativity, insight or productivity. The use of drugs was a key influence on many of the social events of the time that were personal to the Beat generation.|$|E
25|$|The first {{reported}} evidence of stimulant medication {{used to treat}} children with concentration and hyperactivity problems came in 1937. Charles Bradley in Providence, Rhode Island reported {{that a group of}} children with behavioral problems improved after being treated with the stimulant <b>Benzedrine.</b> In 1954, the stimulant methylphenidate (Ritalin, which was first produced in 1944) became available; it {{remains one of the most}} widely prescribed medications for ADHD. Initially the drug was used to treat narcolepsy, chronic fatigue, depression, and to counter the sedating effects of other medications. The drug began to be used for ADHD in the 1960s and steadily rose in use.|$|E
500|$|The first {{amphetamine}} pharmaceutical was <b>Benzedrine,</b> a brand {{which was}} used to treat a variety of conditions. [...] Currently, pharmaceutical amphetamine is prescribed as racemic amphetamine, Adderall, dextroamphetamine, or the inactive prodrug lisdexamfetamine. Amphetamine, through activation of a trace amine receptor, increases monoamine and excitatory neurotransmitter activity in the brain, with its most pronounced effects targeting the catecholamine neurotransmitters norepinephrine and dopamine.|$|E
500|$|Amphetamine {{was first}} {{synthesized}} in 1887 in Germany by Romanian chemist Lazăr Edeleanu who named it phenylisopropylamine; its stimulant effects remained unknown until 1927, {{when it was}} independently resynthesized by Gordon Alles and reported to have sympathomimetic properties. Amphetamine had no medical use until late 1933, when Smith, Kline and French began selling it as an inhaler under the brand name <b>Benzedrine</b> as a decongestant. <b>Benzedrine</b> sulfate was introduced 3years later and was used to treat {{a wide variety of}} medical conditions, including narcolepsy, obesity, low blood pressure, low libido, and chronic pain, among others. During World War II, amphetamine and methamphetamine were used extensively by both the Allied and Axis forces for their stimulant and performance-enhancing effects. As the addictive properties of the drug became known, governments began to place strict controls on the sale of amphetamine. [...] For example, during the early 1970s in the United States, amphetamine became a scheduleII controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act. In spite of strict government controls, amphetamine has been used legally or illicitly by people from a variety of backgrounds, including authors, musicians, mathematicians, and athletes.|$|E
500|$|During his {{minor league}} career, Ellis once chased a heckler {{in the stands}} with a {{baseball}} bat. He also used pills when he pitched, specifically the amphetamines <b>Benzedrine</b> and Dexamyl. Stressed by the pressure of his [...] "can't-miss" [...] status as a prospect, Ellis became addicted. Ellis later said that he never pitched a game without using amphetamines. He eventually needed [...] per game, between five and twelve capsules, depending on their strength. Ellis acknowledged {{that he began to}} use cocaine in the late 1960s.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to the tired former prisoners and civilians, {{the majority of the}} Rangers had only slept for five to six hours over the past three days. The soldiers frequently had hallucinations or fell asleep as they marched. <b>Benzedrine</b> was distributed by the medics to keep the Rangers active during the long march. One Ranger commented on the effect of the drug: [...] "It felt like your eyes were popped open. You couldn't have closed them if you wanted to. One pill was all I ever took—it was all I ever needed." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{reporter}} {{who contributed to}} the story spent an evening at the exclusive London club Blaise's, where {{a member of the}} Rolling Stones allegedly took several <b>Benzedrine</b> tablets, displayed a piece of hashish and invited his companions back to his flat for a [...] "smoke". The article claimed that this was Mick Jagger, {{but it turned out to}} be a case of mistaken identity; the reporter had in fact been eavesdropping on Brian Jones. On the night the article was published Jagger appeared on the Eamonn Andrews chat show and announced that he was filing a writ for libel against the News of the World.|$|E
500|$|According to {{the author}} Raymond Benson, Moonraker is a deeper and more introspective book than Fleming's {{previous}} work, which allows the author to develop the characters further. As such, Bond [...] "becomes something more than... cardboard figure" [...] {{that he had been}} in the previous two novels. The start of the book concentrates on Bond at home and his daily routines, which Fleming describes as [...] "Elastic office hours from around ten until six,... evenings spent playing cards in the company of a few close friends,... or making love, with rather cold passion, to one of three similarly disposed married women." [...] This lifestyle was largely modelled on Fleming's own, which the journalist and writer Matthew Parker sees as showing [...] "a sourness" [...] in the author's character. According to Chancellor, two of Bond's other vices were also displayed in the book: his fondness for gambling—illegal except in private members clubs in 1955—and excessive drink and drug taking, neither of which were frowned upon in post-war upper class circles. In preparation for beating Drax at cards, Bond consumes a vodka martini, a carafe of vodka shared with M, two bottles of champagne and a brandy; he also mixes a quantity of <b>Benzedrine,</b> an amphetamine, into a glass of the champagne. According to The Times journalist and historian Ben Macintyre, to Fleming the alcohol consumption [...] "meant relaxation, ritual and reliability". <b>Benzedrine</b> was regularly taken by troops during the war to remain awake and alert, and Fleming was an occasional consumer.|$|E
500|$|Rand's {{first major}} {{success as a}} writer came in 1943 with The Fountainhead, a romantic and {{philosophical}} novel that she wrote {{over a period of}} seven years. The novel centers on an uncompromising young architect named Howard Roark and his struggle against what Rand described as [...] "second-handers"—those who attempt to live through others, placing others above themselves. It was rejected by twelve publishers before finally being accepted by the Bobbs-Merrill Company on the insistence of editor Archibald Ogden, who threatened to quit if his employer did not publish it. While completing the novel, Rand was prescribed the amphetamine <b>Benzedrine</b> to fight fatigue. The drug helped her to work long hours to meet her deadline for delivering the novel, but afterwards she was so exhausted that her doctor ordered two weeks' rest. Her use of the drug for approximately three decades may have contributed to what some of her later associates described as volatile mood swings.|$|E
500|$|Una Ellis-Fermor, who {{had been}} one of Rainbow's lecturers at Bedford, found her a {{position}} as a clerk at the Ministry of Pensions in Cambridge, where she also lectured part-time for adult education classes. At this point she received a telegram from the Ministry of Labour and National Service, who were tracking down graduates not working for the war effort, and was instructed to report for duty at the War Office. She served as part of Army Council secretariat, working for Lieutenant Colonel Alan Mocatta. There she took on increasing responsibilities, many related to supply and logistics for the war effort. As D-Day drew near, her workload became intense, and she took <b>Benzedrine.</b> During this time, she lived in London with her aunt Phyl on Kensington High Street. After her father joined the Army, her mother and siblings left the family farm and moved to the same street, about [...] away. Like many Londoners, they experienced the hazards of the German air raids on London. She served as a neighbourhood fire warden. The windows of her office at the War Office were blown in twice, and were then replaced with scrim.|$|E
2500|$|Before the race, he {{had taken}} a [...] "magic pill" [...] given to him by Fangio, and he has commented that {{although}} {{he did not know what}} was in it, [...] "Dexedrine and <b>Benzedrine</b> were commonly used in rallies.

[...] After the win, he spent the night and the following day driving his girlfriend to Cologne, stopping for breakfast in Munich and lunch in Stuttgart.|$|E
2500|$|Amphetamine and methamphetamine {{are both}} {{pharmaceutical}} drugs {{used to treat}} a variety of conditions, along with recreational drugs, which are colloquially known as [...] "speed." [...] Amphetamine was first synthesized in 1887 in Germany by Romanian chemist Lazăr Edeleanu who named it phenylisopropylamine. [...] Shortly after, methamphetamine was synthesized from ephedrine in 1893 by Japanese chemist Nagai Nagayoshi. Neither drug had a pharmacological use until 1934, when Smith, Kline and French began selling amphetamine as an inhaler under the trade name <b>Benzedrine</b> as a decongestant.|$|E
2500|$|His smoking {{increased}} to three packs {{a day and}} he suffered from various stress-related ailments such as frequent severe headaches, indigestion, insomnia, anxiety, eczema and heart palpitations, while his weight dropped to ninestone (126lb / 57kg). In order to keep to his 16-hour workdays, he sniffed <b>Benzedrine</b> {{during the day and}} then took tranquillizers and sleeping pills at night to offset the effects and allow him to sleep. He admitted later he had become addicted to benzidrene. [...] Over this period he became irritable and developed an [...] "explosive" [...] temper.|$|E
2500|$|Methylphenidate {{was first}} used to allay barbiturate-induced coma, {{narcolepsy}} and depression. It was later used to treat memory deficits in the elderly. Beginning in the 1960s, {{it was used to}} treat children with ADHD or ADD, known at the time as hyperactivity or minimal brain dysfunction (MBD) based on earlier work starting with the studies by American psychiatrist Charles Bradley on the use of psychostimulant drugs, such as <b>Benzedrine,</b> with then called [...] "maladjusted children". Production and prescription of methylphenidate rose significantly in the 1990s, especially in the United States, as the ADHD diagnosis came to be better understood and more generally accepted within the medical and mental health communities.|$|E
2500|$|Amphetamines (marketed as <b>Benzedrine)</b> {{became popular}} {{for weight loss}} during the late 1930s. They worked {{primarily}} by suppressing appetite, and had other beneficial effects such as increased alertness. Use of amphetamines increased over the subsequent decades, including Obetrol and culminating in the [...] "rainbow pill" [...] regime. This {{was a combination of}} multiple pills, all thought to help with weight loss, taken throughout the day. Typical regimens included stimulants, such as amphetamines, as well as thyroid hormone, diuretics, digitalis, laxatives, and often a barbiturate to suppress the side effects of the stimulants. In 1967/1968 a number of deaths attributed to diet pills triggered a Senate investigation and the gradual implementation of greater restrictions on the market.|$|E

2500|$|Their life in Mexico was by all {{accounts}} an unhappy one. Without heroin and suffering from <b>Benzedrine</b> abuse, Burroughs began to pursue other men as his libido returned, while Vollmer, feeling abandoned, started to drink heavily and mock Burroughs openly. One night while drinking with friends at a party above the American-owned Bounty Bar in Mexico City, a drunk Burroughs allegedly took his handgun from his travel bag and told his wife [...] "It's time for our William Tell act", {{even though they had}} never performed such an act previously. Vollmer, who was also drinking heavily and undergoing amphetamine withdrawal, obliged him by putting a highball glass on her head. Burroughs shot low and the bullet struck her, killing her almost immediately.|$|E
2500|$|While highly effective, the {{requirement}} for injection limited the use of epinephrine and orally active derivatives were sought. A structurally similar compound, ephedrine, (actually more similar to norepinephrine,) was identified by Japanese chemists in the Ma Huang plant and marketed by Eli Lilly as an oral treatment for asthma. [...] Following the work of Henry Dale and George Barger at Burroughs-Wellcome, academic chemist Gordon Alles synthesized amphetamine and tested it in asthma patients in 1929. The drug proved to have only modest anti-asthma effects, but produced sensations of exhilaration and palpitations. Amphetamine was developed by Smith, Kline and French as a nasal decongestant under the trade name <b>Benzedrine</b> Inhaler. Amphetamine was eventually developed {{for the treatment of}} narcolepsy, post-encephalitic parkinsonism, and mood elevation in depression and other psychiatric indications. [...] It received approval as a New and Nonofficial Remedy from the American Medical Association for these uses in 1937 and remained in common use for depression until the development of tricyclic antidepressants in the 1960s.|$|E
2500|$|An {{anonymous}} source—later {{identified as}} Glenn Moser of Norfolk, Virginia—sent {{a letter to}} the Fredericksburg authorities, suggesting that they look into Rees. Moser explained that he and Rees often engaged in heady philosophical conversations, one of which had been about whether murder could be considered acceptable. Rees, under the influence of <b>benzedrine,</b> confided to Moser that he considered murder to just be another part of the [...] "human experience" [...] that he eagerly wanted to take part in. [...] "You can't say it's wrong to kill," [...] Rees reportedly told Moser. [...] "Only individual standards make it right or wrong." [...] The discussion took place the day before the Jacksons disappeared; upon hearing of their murders months later, Moser suspected Rees of killing the family. Moser confronted Rees about the murders; while Rees did not confess to the killings, he also didn't deny responsibility and became evasive. In his anonymous letter, Moser also voiced his suspicion of Rees in Margaret Harold's murder in 1957, as the two men were working in the Annapolis area as salesmen at the time.|$|E
2500|$|During this time, Burroughs {{began using}} {{morphine}} and became addicted. He eventually sold heroin in Greenwich Village {{to support his}} habit. Vollmer also became an addict, but her drug of choice was <b>Benzedrine,</b> an amphetamine sold over the counter at that time. [...] Because of her addiction and social circle, her husband immediately divorced her after returning from the war. With some urging from Allen Ginsberg, and also perhaps Kerouac, Burroughs became intellectually and emotionally linked with Vollmer and {{by the summer of}} 1945 had moved in with Vollmer and her daughter. In spring 1946, Burroughs was arrested for forging a narcotics prescription. Vollmer asked her psychiatrist, a Dr. Wollberg, to sign a surety bond for Burroughs's release. As part of his release, Burroughs returned to St. Louis under his parents' care, after which he left for Mexico to get a divorce from Ilse Klapper. Meanwhile, Vollmer's addiction led to a temporary psychosis that resulted in her admission to [...] Bellevue Hospital, which endangered the custody of her child. Upon hearing this, Burroughs immediately returned to New York City to gain her release, asking her to marry him. Their marriage was never formalized, but she lived as his common-law wife. They returned to St. Louis to visit Burroughs's parents and then moved with her daughter to Texas. Vollmer soon became pregnant with Burroughs's child. Their son, William S. Burroughs Jr., was born in 1947. The family moved briefly to New Orleans in 1948.|$|E
2500|$|For {{the next}} six years, Kerouac {{continued}} to write regularly. Building upon previous drafts tentatively titled [...] "The Beat Generation" [...] and [...] "Gone on the Road," [...] Kerouac completed what {{is now known as}} On the Road in April 1951, while living at 454 West 20th Street in Manhattan with his second wife, Joan Haverty. [...] The book was largely autobiographical and describes Kerouac's road-trip adventures across the United States and Mexico with Neal Cassady in the late 40s and early 50s, as well as his relationships with other Beat writers and friends. [...] He completed the first version of the novel during a three-week extended session of spontaneous confessional prose. [...] Kerouac wrote the final draft in 20 days, with Joan, his wife, supplying him with <b>benzedrine,</b> cigarettes, bowls of pea soup and mugs of coffee to keep him going. [...] Before beginning, Kerouac cut sheets of tracing paper into long strips, wide enough for a typewriter, and taped them together into a [...] long roll which he then fed into the machine. This allowed him to type continuously without the interruption of reloading pages. The resulting manuscript contained no chapter or paragraph breaks and was much more explicit than the version which would eventually be published. [...] Though [...] "spontaneous," [...] Kerouac had prepared long in advance before beginning to write. [...] In fact, according to his Columbia professor and mentor Mark Van Doren, he had outlined much of the work in his journals over the several preceding years.|$|E

50|$|While {{the drug}} was {{initially}} used for medical purposes, as a decongestant, early users of the <b>Benzedrine</b> inhaler discovered it had a euphoric stimulant effect, resulting in its {{being one of the}} earliest synthetic stimulants to be widely used for recreational (i.e., nonmedical) purposes. Even though this drug was intended for inhalation, some people used <b>Benzedrine</b> recreationally by cracking the container open and swallowing the paper strip inside, which was covered in <b>Benzedrine.</b> The strips were often rolled into small balls and swallowed, or taken with coffee or alcohol. Because of the stimulant side effect, physicians discovered amphetamine could also be used to treat narcolepsy. This led to the production of <b>Benzedrine</b> in tablet form. <b>Benzedrine</b> was also used by doctors to perk up lethargic patients before breakfast.|$|E
50|$|<b>Benzedrine,</b> colloquially {{referred}} to as bennies, is the brand name of the first pharmaceutical drug that contained amphetamine. The drug contained the racemic mixture of amphetamine, which is an equal parts mixture of levoamphetamine and dextroamphetamine. It was first marketed in 1933 as a decongestant in the United States by Smith, Kline & French {{in the form of}} <b>Benzedrine</b> inhalers. <b>Benzedrine</b> sulfate was introduced three years later and was used to treat a wide variety of medical conditions, including narcolepsy, obesity, low blood pressure, low libido, and chronic pain, among others.|$|E
50|$|<b>Benzedrine</b> was {{supplied}} to combat troops in World War 2 {{for use in}} exceptional circumstances (e.g. to keep escort ship officers awake and alert in continuous pursuit of submarines for 24 hours or more) as is documented by some participants, e.g. Nicholas Monsarrat. In the 1940s and 1950s, reports began to emerge about the recreational use of <b>Benzedrine</b> inhalers, and in 1949, doctors began {{to move away from}} prescribing <b>Benzedrine</b> as a bronchodilator and appetite suppressant. In 1959, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) made it a prescription drug. After its removal from open sale a black market continued in many large cities, to supply addicts and enthusiasts. For example, the working day at some carnivals (e.g. Labour Day at the Canadian National Exhibition, Toronto, in 1960) was 12 to 16 hours long, enabled by standard dose <b>Benzedrine</b> tablets, still available surreptitiously.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the series}} of books by Ian Fleming, the {{character}} James Bond repeatedly makes use of <b>Benzedrine</b> in times of peak stress and typically during the climax of various books. Actually, Ian Fleming first makes reference to <b>Benzedrine</b> in his first book Casino Royale written in 1953. Le Chiffre, is the paymaster of the [...] "Syndicat des Ouvriers d'Alsace" [...] (French for [...] "Alsatian Workmen's Union"), a SMERSH-controlled trade union. In the very early scenes, Le Chiffre is noted {{to make use of}} a <b>Benzedrine</b> inhaler as he plays baccarat. This detail is not lost in the 2006 film remake of the same name in which Le Chiffre played by Danish actor, Mads Mikkelsen, uses a platinum cased Salbutamol inhaler. The character of James Bond's first use of <b>Benzedrine</b> {{is in the form of}} tablets in the book Live and Let Die [...] "...He still felt perfectly fresh and the elation and clarity of mind produced by the <b>Benzedrine</b> were still with him..." [...] This scene occurs as James Bond is maneuvering through an underwater coral reef toward the island of Surprise off the coast of Jamaica. The next instance of James Bond using <b>Benzedrine</b> is in Moonraker where early in the book he uses a champagne and <b>Benzedrine</b> mixed drink (to which he says [...] "Never Again.") to stay alert to beat the villain Hugo Drax at a game of high-stakes contract bridge. Additionally, when James Bond is about to deal with two gangsters in The Spy Who Loved Me over a long night at the Dreamy Pines Motor Court, [...] "...He took out two and when I gave him the coffee he swallowed them down. 'Benzedrine.' That'll keep me awake for tonight." [...] says Bond.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Benzedrine</b> and derived amphetamines {{were used}} as a {{stimulant}} for armed forces during World War II and the Vietnam War. <b>Benzedrine</b> was commonly referenced in Beatnik culture and writings.
