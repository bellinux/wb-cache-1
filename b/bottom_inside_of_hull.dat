The <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> each <b>hull</b> can be reached through a hatch cover locatedat the rear <b>of</b> each <b>hull.</b> The boat is assembled by attaching the main and rear beams to the hulls with spring-loaded retaining clips, and lacing the trampoline to the beams and hulls.The two rudders are removable without tools, retract on impact with the beach, and can be locked in the up position.|$|R
40|$|A current {{trend is}} {{autonomous}} {{transport of goods}} {{and people in the}} air, at land, and at sea. For safe and reliable operations, autonomous systems require sensors that replace, or even exceed, the senses of a human operator. A system of spatially distributed inertial measurement units (IMUs) along the <b>hull</b> <b>of</b> a vessel, which allows sensing of local accelerations of a vessel or structure at sea is proposed. In contrast to classic motion sensors on ships, the sensors are not placed in a central location of the ship, but are instead mounted on the <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> <b>hull</b> <b>of</b> the vessel. This enables the system to measure local hull vibrations, which are induced by external forces or pressure gradients. The measurements can be processed to allow a spatial awareness of environmental loads or force fields acting on the vessel. After a discussion of the fundamentals of local motion sensing on a marine vessel, this paper presents two applications for distributed motion sensing. The first application is the measurement and classification of ice-induced vibrations in the <b>hull</b> <b>of</b> an Oden-class icebreaker during transit and stationkeeping in ice-infested waters. At four locations on the vessel, the local vibrations were measured and probability distribution function fitted to the motion data. It is shown, depending on the ice-conditions, that the stochastic properties of the signal change. In a second application, a model scale ship is equipped with an array of four motion sensors along the <b>hull</b> <b>of</b> the vessel and one virtual sensor in the center of gravity as a reference measurement. By this configuration, it is demonstrated how to detect local pressure zones along the hull caused by incoming waves...|$|R

2500|$|Major repairs were {{undertaken}} in 1814, including the fitting of [...] metal braces along the <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> her <b>hull,</b> {{to strengthen the}} timbers. This was the first use of iron in the vessel structure, other than small bolts and nails. Active service was resumed from February 1817 when she was relisted as a first-rate carrying 104 guns. However her condition remained poor, and in January 1822 she was towed into dry dock at Portsmouth for repairs to her hull. Refloated in January 1824, she was designated as the Port admiral's flagship for Portsmouth Harbour, remaining in this role until April 1830.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{consideration}} {{is in the}} draft angles. These are required to remove the piece from the mold.

50|$|The T-72 has a {{comprehensive}} nuclear, biological, and chemical (NBC) protection system. The <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> both <b>hull</b> and turret {{is lined with}} a synthetic fabric made of boron compound, meant to reduce the penetrating radiation from neutron bomb explosions. The crew is supplied clean air via an extensive air filter system. A slight over-pressure prevents entry of contamination via bearings and joints. Use of an autoloader for the main gun allows for more efficient forced smoke removal compared to traditional manually loaded ("pig-loader") tank guns, so NBC isolation of the fighting compartment can, in theory, be maintained indefinitely.

5|$|Galenas keel {{was laid}} down by Maxson, Fish & Co. in 1861 and she was {{launched}} on 14 February 1862. The ship was commissioned on 21 April 1862 with Commander Alfred Taylor in command. Galena arrived in Hampton Roads on 24 April, after having suffered several engine breakdowns en route, and was assigned to Flag Officer L.M. Goldsborough's North Atlantic Blockading Squadron. Commander John Rodgers relieved Taylor the same day. When Goldsborough inspected the ship shortly after her arrival he ordered that her spars be cut away and the nuts on the <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> her <b>hull</b> to be covered with sheet iron {{to prevent them from}} breaking loose when the ship was hit.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1920s he devised a better {{solution}}. The solution was {{the addition of}} a bellcrank, which changed the direction of motion from vertical to horizontal. The road wheels were individually mounted on a pipe that could move vertically only, at the top of which the bell crank rotated the direction of motion to the rear. Springs were mounted {{on the end of the}} crank, and could be as long as needed, lying along the <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> the <b>hull.</b> The result was a substantial increase in range of motion, from only some 10 cm in his original designs, to 25 cm on the M1928, 35 cm on the M1930, and 60 cm on the M1932.|$|R

2500|$|The heat/energy from a popcorn kettle is {{transferred}} into the oil, most commonly corn oil, {{which is a}} good heat conductor. [...] "As the kernel begins to heat up, the water vapor <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> the kernel will also become very hot, increasing the pressure <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> the <b>hull.</b> Around 212°F (100°C) the internal water will expand into steam and create an outward force on the <b>hull</b> because <b>of</b> the increasing kinetic energy as the molecules begin to move faster and faster. The pressure is increasing as the temperature increases. Finally, the kernel will fracture once the pressure inside reaches 135 lbs/in^2. (Pressure is equal to average force / unit area)." [...] When water is converted from a liquid to a gas disorder increases, which is another way of saying entropy. This kinetic energy in the form of entropy is one of the forces that drives the popping of popcorn kernels.|$|R
50|$|The air bled {{from the}} engines {{is hot and}} {{requires}} cooling by air conditioning units. It is also extremely dry at cruising altitude, and this causes sore eyes, dry skin and mucosa on long flights. Although humidification technology could raise its relative humidity to comfortable middle levels, this is not done since humidity promotes corrosion to the <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> the <b>hull</b> and risks condensation which could short electrical systems, so for safety reasons it is deliberately kept to a low value, around 10%. Another problem of the air coming from the ventilation (unto which the oil lubrication system of the engines is hooked up) is that fumes from components in the synthetic oils can sometimes travel along, causing passengers, pilots and crew to be intoxicated. The illness it causes is called aerotoxic syndrome.|$|R
50|$|To {{counter the}} danger of bullet splash or {{fragments}} knocked off the <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> the <b>hull,</b> the crew wore helmets with goggles and chainmail masks. Gas masks were also standard issue, as they were to all soldiers {{at this point in}} the war due to the use of chemical warfare. The side armour of 8 mm initially made them largely immune to small arms fire, but could be penetrated by the recently developed armour-piercing K bullets. There was also {{the danger of}} being overrun by infantry and attacked with grenades. The next generation had thicker armour, making them nearly immune to the K bullets. In response, the Germans developed a larger purpose-made anti-tank rifle, and also a Geballte Ladung ("Bunched Charge")—several regular stick grenades bundled together for a much bigger explosion.|$|R

50|$|The {{technique}} {{consists of}} stitching together plywood panels {{with some sort}} of wire or other suitable device, such as cable ties or duct tape and staples. All these methods of stitching or suturing the plywood panels <b>of</b> the <b>hull</b> are simple methods <b>of</b> clamping the <b>hull</b> parts together before they are permanently welded or fused by epoxy and fiberglass tape joints. Once the epoxy sets solid in most cases the stitches or other clamping structures are removed leaving only the fused plywood panels behind. Copper wire is popular because the wires can be twisted tighter or looser to precisely adjust fit, and because it is easy to sand after gluing, and it is suitable in a marine environment if left in place, but mild steel electric fencing wire can be used just as easily and then can be removed completely from the hull structure. To join, the cut panels are drilled with small holes along the joining edges and stitched. Once together, the joint is glued, usually with thickened epoxy and fiberglass on the <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> the <b>hull.</b>|$|R
50|$|At {{the time}} when Clasper was {{starting}} to design racing boats, the standard boat <b>hull</b> was constructed <b>of</b> a number of strakes (or planks), with a keel projecting from bottom <b>of</b> the <b>hull.</b> Together with Matthew Taylor, another Tyneside boat-builder, he worked to reduce the surface area and drag. They did this by placing the keel <b>inside</b> the <b>hull</b> <b>of</b> the boat and constructing the hull with a single strake on each side. The surface would then be given several coats of varnish to give as smooth a finish as possible.|$|R
50|$|To {{counter the}} danger of bullet splash or {{fragments}} knocked off the <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> the <b>hull,</b> crews were issued with leather-and-chainmail masks.

The side armour of 8 mm initially made them largely immune to small arms fire, but could be penetrated by the recently developed armour-piercing K bullets. There was also {{the danger of}} being overrun by infantry and attacked with grenades. The next generation had thicker armour, making them nearly immune to the K bullets. In response, the Germans developed the 13.2 mm Mauser anti-tank rifle, and also a Geballte Ladung ("Bunched Charge") - several stick grenades bundled together for a much bigger explosion.|$|R
500|$|Although the U.S. Navy {{then had}} several classes of {{ballistic}} missile submarines and submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) in service, the study placed a significant {{emphasis on the}} survivability of SLBMs. This resulted in the enormous Ohio-class submarine and the Trident SLBMs which the Ohio class carried. The study originally called for dedicated slow-moving missile-carrying submarines (instead of converted attack submarines) to embark missiles outside their hulls and rely primarily on stealth for survivability. However, Admiral Hyman Rickover, director of the Naval Reactors office, wanted a boat capable of a burst of high speed in order to affect a safe [...] "getaway" [...] after launching the boat's payload.

50|$|Under the {{leadership}} of Admiral Hyman G. Rickover, Naval Reactors followed a concurrent design strategy, with the design and construction of the S1W reactor taking place ahead of the design and construction of the Nautilus. This enabled problems to be identified and resolved before they appeared in the shipboard plant. To better support this design process, the S1W power plant was built <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> a submarine <b>hull.</b> While the cramped spaces prevented engineers from obtaining information on some plant components, it provided a much more realistic {{example of how the}} shipboard plant would have to be constructed.|$|R
