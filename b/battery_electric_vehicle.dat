25|$|About 6 a.m. on 17 November 2010 a fire {{broke out}} on the vehicle deck of the MS Pearl of Scandinavia on its way from Oslo to Copenhagen. The ferry's fire {{sprinkler}} system {{put out the fire}} before any of the crew or the 490 sleeping passengers were injured and the ship could dock in Copenhagen under its own power. It was determined that the cause of the fire was a short circuit in the plug of an extension cord used to charge a rebuilt Nissan Qashqai, converted into a <b>battery</b> <b>electric</b> <b>vehicle</b> by the Sakskøbing based company A Future EV. The company owner was returning from Norway where the vehicle had started the approval process for general sale there, and had used an extension cord to charge the vehicle from a general purpose power outlet on the ferry.

500|$|The Volt {{operates}} as a pure <b>battery</b> <b>electric</b> <b>vehicle</b> until its battery capacity drops to a predetermined threshold from full charge. From there its internal combustion engine powers an electric generator to extend the vehicle's range as needed. When the engine is running it may be periodically mechanically linked (by a clutch) to a planetary gear set, and hence the output drive axle, to improve energy efficiency. The Volt's regenerative braking also contributes to the on-board electricity generation. Under the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) cycle, the 2013/15 model year Volt all-electric range is , with a combined electric mode/gasoline-only rating of [...] equivalent (MPG-equivalent).|$|E
500|$|The {{drivetrain}} {{permits the}} Volt {{to operate as}} a pure <b>battery</b> <b>electric</b> <b>vehicle</b> until its battery capacity has been depleted to a defined level, at which time it commences to operate as a series hybrid design where the gasoline engine drives the generator, which keeps the battery at minimum level charge and provides power to the electric motors. The full charge of the battery is replenished only by loading it on the electrical grid. While in this series mode at higher speeds and loads, (typically above [...] at light to moderate loads) the gasoline engine can engage mechanically to the output from the transmission and assist both electric motors in driving the wheels, {{in which case the}} Volt operates as a power-split or series-parallel hybrid. After its all-electric range has been depleted, at speeds between , the Volt is programmed to select the most efficient drive mode, which improves performance and boosts high-speed efficiency by 10 to 15 percent.|$|E

40|$|<b>Battery</b> <b>electric</b> <b>vehicles</b> possess great {{potential}} for decreasing lifecycle costs in medium-duty applications, a market segment currently dominated by internal combustion technology. Characterized by frequent repetition of similar routes and daily return to a central depot, medium-duty vocations are well positioned to leverage the low operating costs of <b>battery</b> <b>electric</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Unfortunately, the range limitation of commercially available <b>battery</b> <b>electric</b> <b>vehicles</b> acts {{as a barrier to}} widespread adoption. This paper describes the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's collaboration with the U. S.

This analysis employs real-world vocational data and near-term economic assumptions to (1) identify optimal component configurations for minimizing lifecycle costs, (2) benchmark economic performance relative to both <b>battery</b> <b>electric</b> and conventional powertrains, and (3) understand how the optimal design and its competitiveness change with respect to duty cycle and economic climate. It is found that small fuel-cell power units provide extended range at significantly lower capital and lifecycle costs than additional battery capacity alone. And while fuel-cell range-extended vehicles are not deemed economically competitive with conventional vehicles given present-day economic conditions, this paper identifies potential future scenarios where cost equivalency is achieved...|$|R
