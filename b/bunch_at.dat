25|$|The years 1911–1930 could arguably {{be called}} the Golden Age of Willow <b>Bunch.</b> <b>At</b> the end of 1927, {{according}} to the Willow Bunch Parish Bulletin, there were “77 baptisms, 11 marriages and six burials for a population of 1,348 distributed over 227 families of which 219 are French-speaking.” During this time period there was also several notable buildings that were constructed, the residents celebrated their 50-year Golden Jubilee and they enjoyed an active political culture. But {{by the end of}} 1929, over 200 people had left Willow Bunch due to the intense drought and the effects of the Great Depression.|$|E

25|$|In {{the days}} before the Tour, Basso was {{suspended}} by Team CSC after his name had been brought up in the Operación Puerto doping investigation. Carlos Sastre became team captain. Voigt took the role of early attacker, to lessen the load for the team, and he formed or joined unsuccessful breakaways on several stages. On the memorable stage 13 from Béziers to Montélimar, the longest stage of the 2006 Tour at 231km, Voigt got in a five-man breakaway which finished 29 minutes and 58 seconds ahead of the main <b>bunch.</b> <b>At</b> the line, Voigt outsprinted Óscar Pereiro to take his second Tour stage win. On stage 15, Voigt helped Fränk Schleck from Luxembourg, pulling hard in the break with teammate David Zabriskie of the US, which eventually gave Schleck the win. Voigt finished the 2006 Tour 53rd, helping Sastre finish 4th.|$|E

2500|$|Willow Bunch is the Rural Municipality #42 in {{southern}} Saskatchewan. In 2006, the total Aboriginal population for the RM #42 was 407. The Métis in Willow Bunch “played {{a key role}} in maintaining the peace during the time that the Sioux and the other American tribes were forced from the United States into the area of Wood Mountain. ” The Métis had a strong relationship with the Sioux, especially with Chief Sitting Bull. “The fires of 1880 on Wood Mountain resulted in the movement of our people to other communities. It was at this time that the Métis pioneers moved to Willow <b>Bunch</b> <b>at</b> the suggestion of Andre Gaudry." [...] The Métis were already settled in Willow Bunch when the North West Resistance, led by Louis Riel, battled the Canadian government over land rights.

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a solution for}} producing ultrashort (∼fs) high charge (∼pC) from ultracompact guns utilizing single-cycle THz pulses.

Moreover, it is demonstrated that THz energies of 2 [*]mJ are sufficient to generate relativistic electron bunches with higher than 2  MeV energy. The high acceleration gradients possible in the structures provide 30  fs electron <b>bunches</b> <b>at</b> 30  keV energy and 45  fs <b>bunches</b> <b>at</b> 2  MeV energy. These structures will underpin future devices for strong field THz physics in general and miniaturized electron guns, in which the high fields combined with the short pulse duration enable electron beams with ultrahigh brightness...|$|R

40|$|A novel {{method of}} {{producing}} intense short wavelength radiation from relativistic electrons is described.
