40|$|This note {{explores the}} interrelationship between ecologically {{sustainable}} development (the green environmental agenda) and pro-poor urban development {{and environmental health}} (the <b>brown</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>agenda)</b> in relation to local government in South Africa. The meaning and relevance of the brown agenda versus the green agenda in environmental governance are discussed in general. This discussion subsequently feeds into the argument that South Africa's constitutional environmental right also foresees the advancement of the <b>brown</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>agenda,</b> which has implications for the interpretation and enforcement of local government's service delivery mandate. This link between municipal service delivery and the environmental right further informs understanding of what is required of government to fulfill this right. This paper is thus devoted to an introductory conceptual framing of South Africa's environmental right {{that goes beyond the}} green agenda. This impacts on how the constitutional duties of municipalities are interpreted and executed...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} how, by undertaking {{an international}} agenda to address global environmental problems, subnational governments (SGs) are promoting a rescaling of environmental governance. It uses the Brazilian state of São Paulo {{as a primary}} example. It argues that by establishing an international <b>environmental</b> <b>agenda,</b> the state breaks the fixed scales in which it would traditionally operate. As a result, the state engages in a particular form of rescaled environmental governance—one that extends the locus, agency, and scope of action from the regional to the transnational level. To undertake this analysis, the paper brings the multilevel governance and subnational diplomacy literatures into dialogue. The paper suggests that when engaging in an international <b>environmental</b> <b>agenda,</b> SGs promote six forms of rescaling; this is a wider and more nuanced picture than so far envisioned by the literature. The paper draws upon documental analysis, and semi-structured interviews...|$|R

40|$|From the {{beginning}} of nineties, when significant changes took place, Russia began to elaborate new environmental policy and designed new patterns for responding the environmental problems. The paper {{tried to make a}} contribution to our understanding of environmental policy and policy processes within the Russia in general terms and to the nature of <b>environmental</b> <b>agenda</b> setting in Pskov region in more specific terms. This thesis is therefore explores <b>environmental</b> <b>agenda</b> setting process in Russia taking into consideration contemporary trends in the analysis of policy- making, such as inclusion of non-state actors as well as role of ideas shaping actors attitudes and behaviour. The purpose of the thesis is to study the relationship between transnational forces and interactions, national policy and local political developments and the role of various agents and institutions in agenda setting of the regional environmental policy-making. The frame of reference is constituted by a theoretical combination of the agenda-setting model with constructivist approach in order to broaden our investigation of the implications of environmental policy-making, impact of political culture upon construction of environmental issues, and transformations in the public policy. By focusing on Pskov region case, the paper identifies and discusses a number of reasons why environmental issues are found on the margins of the political agenda. A central argument is that in the absence of effective governance in the Pskov region, international agents together with regional interest groups formulate <b>environmental</b> <b>agenda.</b> The paper concludes that, even though, the mentality of environmentalism is set through the foreign assistance, the processes of learning from international cooperation may contribute to attainment of regional environmental objectives...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the process of {{organizational}} change undergone by a large Portuguese business group within the context of the <b>environmental</b> <b>agenda</b> and the role of accounting as a mechanism for change. Design/methodology/approach – The paper reports the results of a case study conducted between 2006 and 2009. Information was obtained from semi-structured interviews and secondary sources. Organizational changes were analyzed using Laughlin’s model in order to identify which category reflected most of the changes introduced to address environmental matters. Findings – This paper offers evidence that change is not a homogeneous phenomenon. Additionally, it confirms previous studies’ findings which found that accounting did not play a significant role in the process of organizational change within the context of the <b>environmental</b> <b>agenda.</b> Originality/value – This paper seeks to complement the research in this area by integrating observations from a case study into an existing model of levels of organizational change according to how a Portuguese business group incorporated environmental issues into its processes, policies and corporate culture...|$|R
40|$|This article {{argues that}} <b>brown</b> <b>environmental</b> {{problems}} have been given scant attention in urban planning and governance in favour of profit-making and industrial development efforts in South Africa, {{at the expense of}} public health. Urban South Africa is plagued by mounting <b>brown</b> <b>environmental</b> problems that arose out of industrialisation and urbanisation. As a result, informal economic activities have mushroomed in urban spaces, which are now synonymous with air pollution, waste and squalid settlement environments. Often the informal economic activities are pigeonholed in high capital intensive industries, mining companies, manufacturing institutions as well as processing and heavy metal companies, amongst others. But the ubiquity of informal business establishments around public transit stations, pavement/walkways and adjacent formal businesses, notwithstanding a myriad of bylaws, have contributed significantly towards emissions of toxins, gases, fumes and liquids into the surroundings with deleterious repercussions on public health. The informal economy is characterised by congestion, street vending and littering, illegal disposal of contaminated liquids and refuse on pavements and sidewalks as well as a series of air polluting activities, which are seemingly ungovernable. This article explores various <b>brown</b> <b>environmental</b> problems that affect urban South Africa in order to highlight the deleterious consequences of lax in urban governance...|$|R
