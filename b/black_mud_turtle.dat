They are also known as Dickhalsschildkröte in German, ホオジロクロガメ in Japanese, Kura-kura pipi-putih in Indonesian, and Черепаха черная болотная in Russian.|$|E
50|$|The East African <b>black</b> <b>mud</b> <b>turtle</b> (Pelusios subniger), {{also known}} as the Pan terrapin, is a species of turtle in the Pelomedusidae family, native to eastern and southeastern Africa.|$|E
50|$|The East African <b>black</b> <b>mud</b> <b>turtle</b> is {{omnivorous}} {{and takes}} fish, invertebrates and plants. It {{is known to}} reach an age of over fifty years in captivity and forty-seven years in the wild. Females lay nests of 3-12 eggs their eggs {{in the spring and}} they bury them in mud. Eggs take about two months to hatch. Although the East Africa <b>black</b> <b>mud</b> <b>turtle</b> can be seen basking throughout the day they are more active at night and are considered to be nocturnal. They have been observed to burrow into the mud to regulate their body temperature.|$|E
25|$|Dublin Zoo's Reptile House {{was opened}} in 1876. It {{features}} reptiles such as West African crocodiles, Gila monsters, veiled chameleons, pancake tortoises, leopard tortoises, plated lizards, Bell's hinge-back tortoises, Burmese pythons, Asian leaf turtles, Asian water monitors and East African <b>black</b> <b>mud</b> <b>turtles,</b> {{as well as}} invertebrates such as Macleay's spectres and Chilean rose tarantulas.|$|R

50|$|The yellow <b>mud</b> <b>turtle</b> (Kinosternon flavescens), also {{commonly}} known as the yellow-necked <b>mud</b> <b>turtle,</b> is a species of <b>mud</b> <b>turtle</b> in the family Kinosternidae. The species is endemic to the Central United States and Mexico.|$|R
50|$|The East African <b>black</b> <b>mud</b> <b>turtle</b> has a smooth, domed {{carapace}} with {{a length}} of 5.1-7.9 in. The carapace is typically dark brown, gray, or black, often with yellow or dark markings on the margins. They are rather dull in color like most of their genus. The plastron is hinged. The underside of the turtle can be brown, grey, black, or yellow. The upper jaw has a blunt, smooth shape. The head of an adult is generally uniform in color. As in all side-necked turtles, the neck retracts the head sideways instead of vertically into the shell. This species may {{be confused with the}} West African mud turtle.|$|E
50|$|Relatively few {{families}} and genera of reptile have reached Madagascar {{but they have}} diversified into more than 260 species, with over 90% of these being endemic. The chameleons are very well represented with two-thirds of the world's species found there. The other lizard groups on Madagascar are the geckoes, skinks, girdle-tailed lizards and iguanids. Over 60 different snakes occur on the island; none of these are harmful to man. There are six land tortoises species, five endemics and one introduced species (Bell's hinge-back tortoise). Land based turtles include the African helmeted turtle, yellow-bellied mud turtle and East African <b>black</b> <b>mud</b> <b>turtle.</b> The shores are used for nesting by the loggerhead sea turtle, green sea turtle and hawksbill sea turtle while the {{olive ridley sea turtle}} forages here. Madagascar's largest reptile is the Nile crocodile which has become very rare due to hunting for its skin. Endemic voay (V. robustus) became extinct.|$|E
50|$|The East African <b>black</b> <b>mud</b> <b>turtle</b> {{does well}} in captivity. It is a hearty, mid-sized turtle that does {{well in a}} twenty-gallon tank. They must be given room to swim and ideally a place to bask under a warm light as well. They can {{experience}} skin problems if the Ph of the water is not maintained between 6.0-6.5. As tropical species, a temperature of 78-82 degrees F should be maintained. These turtles are easy to handle and are not aggressive towards humans but are highly aggressive towards other turtles, thus cannot be housed with other breeds of turtles and should be introduced slowly to conspecifics. They will attack and kill birds, mice, insects and nearly anything else {{they can get a}} hold of so if you house them outdoors screening over their habitat is a good consideration. Although these turtles rarely get sick, allowing birds and rodents into their habitat could also introduce disease.|$|E

5000|$|In a study, the {{serrated}} hinged terrapin (Pelusios sinuatus) (also {{sometimes referred}} to as the [...] "water tortoise") was more commonly reported in the stomach contents of adult crocodiles from Kruger National Park than any single mammal species. Other turtle species commonly recorded among Nile crocodile prey include the Speke's hinge-back tortoise (Kinixys spekii) and east African <b>black</b> <b>mud</b> <b>turtle</b> (Pelusios subniger). Beyond their ready availability and respectable size, turtles are favored by big crocodiles due to their slowness which allows the cumbersome crocodiles to capture them more easily than swifter vertebrates. While adults have a sufficient bite force to crush turtle shells, sometimes younger crocodiles are overly ambitious and one choked to death attempting to swallow a whole large river turtle. A variety of snakes have been preyed on from relatively small innocuous species such as the common egg-eating snake (Dasypeltis scabra) to the largest African snakes species, the African rock python (Python sebae), which can exceed 6.1 m in length and weigh over 91 kg. Venomous species, including the puff adder (Bitis arietans), the forest cobra (Naja melanoleuca) and the black mamba (Dendroaspis polylepis) have been recorded as Nile crocodile prey. The only frequently recorded lizard prey are the large Nile monitor (Varanus niloticus), although this mesopredator may be eaten fairly regularly as they often share similar habitat preferences, whenever a crocodile is able to ambush the stealthy monitor, which is more agile on land than the bulkier crocodile.|$|E
