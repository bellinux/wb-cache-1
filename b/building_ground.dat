25|$|In 455 BC, {{during the}} First Peloponnesian War, it was burned by the Athenian admiral Tolmides who besieged {{the city with}} 50 ships and 4,000 hoplites. It was rebuilt and was most probably, the <b>{{building}}</b> <b>ground</b> for the Spartan fleet in the Peloponnesian War. In 407 BC during the Peloponnesian War, Alcibiades landed there and saw the thirty triremes the Spartans were building there. In 370 BC, the Thebans {{under the command of}} Epaminondas besieged the city successfully for three days after ravaging Laconia. However it was recaptured by the Spartans three days later.|$|E
25|$|The station's {{terminal}} layout has posed some unique problems {{ever since}} the late 20th century, since all trains have to change directions and reverse {{out of the station}} to continue on to their destination. This causes long turn-around times and places the passengers in the opposite direction of where they had been sitting. There have been several attempts to change this. The last project, called Frankfurt 21, was to put the whole station underground, connect it with tunnels also to the east, and so avoid the disadvantages of the terminal layout. This would be financed by selling the air rights over the area now used for tracks as <b>building</b> <b>ground</b> for skyscraper, but this soon proved unrealistic, and the project was abandoned.|$|E
25|$|It was {{intended}} as the central headquarters of the BOT in order to house 2,500 employees from several divisions of the board including its executive, legal, and engineering staffs. The remainder of the building not used by the BOT would be rented out. The ground level of the building at Jay and Wiloughby Streets is designed with numerous columns forming an arcade. Haugaard, the lead designer, had drafted the design prior to World War II. Within the arcade and adjacent to the building are several entrances to the Jay Street–MetroTech subway complex, which consisted of two separate stations when the building was constructed. The location was selected {{in order to be}} in close proximity to the lines of all three subway divisions, in order to collect fares via money train. Passageways from the subway stations, including a visible door in the Jay Street IND station, lead to a money sorting room {{in the basement of the}} <b>building.</b> <b>Ground</b> broke on the site on October 8, 1948. The building was erected at a time when many other BOT transit facilities were also being built. The headquarters opened on April 1, 1951, just two years before the BOT ceased existence, and after the death of Haugaard. It cost $10 million to construct. The BOT proceeded to vacate its former headquarters, one at Hudson Street at the entrance to the Holland Tunnel in Hudson Square, Manhattan, and the other in the former Paramount Theatre in Downtown Brooklyn.|$|E

60|$|Remus, however, did not {{concur in}} these views. A little {{farther down the}} stream there was another {{elevation}} called the Aventine Hill, which seemed to him more suitable for {{the site of a}} town. The sides were less precipitous, and thus were more convenient for <b>building</b> <b>ground.</b> Then the land in the immediate vicinity was better adapted to the purposes which they had in view. In a word, the Aventine Hill was, as Remus thought, for every substantial reason, much the best locality; and as for the fact of their having been washed ashore {{at the foot of the}} other hill, it was in his opinion an insignificant circumstance, wholly unworthy of being taken seriously into the account in laying the foundation of a city.|$|E

6000|$|Mrs. Ray's small income arose {{partly from}} certain cottages in Baslehurst, {{which had been}} let in lump to a Baslehurst tradesman, and partly from shares in a gas company at Exeter. Now the gas company at Exeter was the better {{investment}} of the two, and {{was considered to be}} subject to less uncertainty than the cottages. The lease under which the cottages had been let was out, and Mrs. Ray had been advised to sell the property. <b>Building</b> <b>ground</b> near the town was rising in value; and she had been advised by Mr. Goodall to part with her little estate. Both Mrs. Ray and Rachel were aware that this business, to them very important, was imminent; and now had come a letter from Mr. Goodall, saying that Mrs. Ray must go to Exeter to conclude the sale. [...] "We should only bungle matters," [...] Mr. Goodall had said, [...] "if I were to send the deeds down to you; and as it is absolutely necessary that you should understand all about it, I think you had better come up on Tuesday; you can get back to Baslehurst easily on the same day." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was like}} all other expresses, as every express is and must be. It bore through the harvest country a smell like a large washing- day, and a sharp issue of steam as from a huge brazen tea-urn. The {{greatest}} power in nature and art combined, it yet glided over dangerous heights {{in the sight of}} people looking up from fields and roads, as smoothly and unreally as a light miniature plaything. Now, the engine shrieked in hysterics of such intensity, that it seemed desirable that the men who had her in charge should hold her feet, slap her hands, and bring her to; now, burrowed into tunnels with a stubborn and undemonstrative energy so confusing that the train seemed to be flying back into leagues of darkness. Here, were station after station, swallowed up by the express without stopping; here, stations where it fired itself in like a volley of cannon-balls, swooped away four country-people with nosegays, and three men of business with portmanteaus, and fired itself off again, bang, bang, bang! At long intervals were uncomfortable refreshment-rooms, made more uncomfortable by the scorn of Beauty towards Beast, the public (but to whom she never relented, as Beauty did in the story, towards the other Beast), and where sensitive stomachs were fed, with a contemptuous sharpness occasioning indigestion. Here, again, were stations with nothing going but a bell, and wonderful wooden razors set aloft on great posts, shaving the air. In these fields, the horses, sheep, and cattle were well used to the thundering meteor, and didn't mind; in those, they were all set scampering together, and a herd of pigs scoured after them. The pastoral country darkened, became coaly, became smoky, became infernal, got better, got worse, improved again, grew rugged, turned romantic; was a wood, a stream, a chain of hills, a gorge, a moor, a cathedral town, a fortified place, a waste. Now, miserable black dwellings, a black canal, and sick black towers of chimneys; now, a trim garden, where the flowers were bright and fair; now, a wilderness of hideous altars all a- blaze; now, the water meadows with their fairy rings; now, the mangy patch of unlet <b>building</b> <b>ground</b> outside the stagnant town, with the larger ring where the Circus was last week. The temperature changed, the dialect changed, the people changed, faces got sharper, manner got shorter, eyes got shrewder and harder; yet all so quickly, that the spruce guard in the London uniform and silver lace, had not yet rumpled his shirt-collar, delivered half the dispatches in his shiny little pouch, or read his newspaper.|$|E

40|$|Transition {{to market}} economy brings the {{necessity}} for market evaluation of real estate grounds. Here, only {{on the basis of}} the real estate market analysis, it can be established which factors and to what extent are giving an impact to the value of real estate. For an appropriate real estate market analysis a sufficient amount of corresponding data on real estate market is indispensable. In my graduate task I have gathered advertisements from printed and electronic media and, in processing them, I have elaborated an analysis of land marketing in the local communities of the Gorenjska statistical region. Further on, I have compared the results obtained to geographic, demographic as well as economic indicators of this region. I have also established the impacts influencing on the prices in an individual local community of the Gorenjska region. In the end, all the results obtained have been displayed graphically. The results of analysis have shown: that the most expensive non-covered <b>building</b> <b>grounds</b> without documentation are located in the Commune of Kranjska Gora,; that the most expensive non-covered <b>building</b> <b>grounds</b> without documentation that are intended for business activity are located in the Commune of Naklo, that the most expensive non-covered <b>building</b> <b>grounds</b> suitable for construction of dislocated holiday-home are located in the Municipality of Kranj; that the most expensive idle <b>building</b> <b>grounds</b> with settled paper documentation are located in the Commune of Škofja Loka; that the most expensive occupied <b>building</b> <b>grounds</b> with existing <b>building</b> to be reconstructed can be found in the Commune of Bohinj while the most expensive farming grounds and forests are in the Commune of Železniki; that the prices for non-occupied <b>building</b> <b>grounds</b> in the Gorenjska statistic region increase, on average, by 34...|$|R
