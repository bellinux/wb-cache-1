5|$|Fat-rich plant {{products}} such as nuts and conifer seeds are particularly important as winter food {{in the north of}} the woodpecker's range, and can then supply more than 30% of the bird's energy requirements. Other plant items consumed include buds, <b>berries</b> <b>and</b> tree sap, the latter obtained by drilling rings of holes around a tree trunk.|$|E
5|$|The {{black-throated blue warbler}} forages {{actively}} in low vegetation, sometimes hovering or catching insects in flight. It often forages in one area {{for a while before}} moving on to the next. It mainly eats invertebrates such as caterpillars, crane flies, and spiders. It may supplement its diet with seeds, <b>berries,</b> <b>and</b> fruit in the winter.|$|E
5|$|The manakins are {{a family}} of {{subtropical}} and tropical mainland Central American, South America, and Trinidad and Tobago. They are compact forest birds, the males typically being brightly colored, although the females of most species are duller and usually green-plumaged. Manakins feed on small fruits, <b>berries,</b> <b>and</b> insects.|$|E

5|$|This munia eats mainly {{grass seeds}} apart from <b>berries</b> <b>and</b> small insects. They forage in flocks and {{communicate}} with soft calls and whistles. The species is highly social and may sometimes roost with other species of munias. This species is found in tropical plains and grasslands. Breeding pairs construct dome-shaped nests using grass or bamboo leaves.|$|E
5|$|All {{motorized}} {{vehicles are}} prohibited, {{but it is}} permitted to bring canoes and other non-motorized boats, as well as skiing during winter. Walking and tenting is permitted everywhere. <b>Berries</b> <b>and</b> mushrooms can be harvested for personal use. Hunting and fishing is also permitted with a hunting or fishing license. Dogs may be brought along, but must be in a leash between 1 April and 20 August. Hikers must show special consideration regarding vegetation, animal life and cultural heritage.|$|E
5|$|Malabi is {{a creamy}} pudding {{originating}} from Turkey prepared with milk or almond milk (for a kosher version) and cornstarch. It is {{sold as a}} street food from carts or stalls, in disposable cups with thick sweet syrup and various crunchy toppings such as chopped pistachios or coconut. Its popularity has resulted in supermarkets selling it in plastic packages and restaurants serving richer and more sophisticated versions using various toppings and garnishes such as <b>berries</b> <b>and</b> fruit. Sahlab is a similar dessert made from the powdered tubers of orchids and milk.|$|E

5|$|Predominantly insectivorous, the {{black-throated blue warbler}} {{supplements}} its {{diet with}} <b>berries</b> <b>and</b> seeds in winter. It builds its nests in thick shrubs and the closeness of its nesting sites to the ground make it a favored species {{for the study of}} warbler behavior in the wild. The black-throated blue warbler defends its territory against other birds of the same species for both nesting and winter habitats. As the black-throated blue warbler requires large, unbroken forest areas for nesting, its numbers are declining.|$|E
5|$|The diet of the Arctic tern varies {{depending}} on location and time, but is usually carnivorous. In most cases, it eats small fish or marine crustaceans. Fish species comprise {{the most important part}} of the diet, and account for more of the biomass consumed than any other food. Prey species are immature (1–2-year old) shoaling species such as herring, cod, sandlances, and capelin. Among the marine crustaceans eaten are amphipods, crabs and krill. Sometimes, these birds also eat molluscs, marine worms, or <b>berries,</b> <b>and</b> on their northern breeding grounds, insects.|$|E

Back in the Lower Mainland, the September harvest provides them with melons, peppers, eggplant, grapes, and tomatoes. To prepare for winter they preserved corn and tomatoes, made jam from berries, collected herbs from their community garden, and bought many potatoes.|$|E
5|$|The male of the {{nominate}} subspecies, {{which is}} found {{throughout most of}} Europe, is all black except for a yellow eye-ring and bill and has a rich, melodious song; the adult female and juvenile have mainly dark brown plumage. This species breeds in woods and gardens, building a neat, mud-lined, cup-shaped nest. It is omnivorous, eating {{a wide range of}} insects, earthworms, <b>berries,</b> <b>and</b> fruits.|$|E
5|$|Along the way, the LocoRoco {{can grow}} in size by eating special <b>berries,</b> <b>and</b> then can be split and rejoined {{to pass the}} LocoRoco through narrow spaces. The game's bright and {{colorful}} visuals and dynamic music soundtrack were hallmarks of the game, earning it several awards from the gaming press in 2006. While the game did not sell high volumes, its success {{led to the development}} of four other LocoRoco titles – two sequels for the PSP (PlayStation Portable)/PSP Go, a spin-off for the PlayStation 3 and a mobile version (called LocoRoco Mobile and LocoRoco Hi, depending on the market) for cellular (mobile) telephones.|$|E

5|$|Fishers are generalist predators. Although {{their primary}} prey is snowshoe hare and porcupine, {{they are also}} known to {{supplement}} their diet with insects, nuts, <b>berries,</b> <b>and</b> mushrooms. Since they are solitary hunters, their choice of prey is limited by their size. Analyses of stomach contents and scat have found evidence of birds, small mammals, and even moose and deer—the latter two indicating {{that they are not}} averse to eating carrion. Fishers have been seen to feed on deer carcasses. While the behavior is not common, fishers have been known to kill larger animals, such as wild turkey, bobcat, and lynx.|$|E
5|$|In Africa, the warbler eats insects {{as well as}} <b>berries,</b> <b>and</b> {{the fruits}} of the {{introduced}} Spanish flag is a favourite where present. An increase in body mass occurs again before the northward migration, birds fattening even more rapidly than prior to their southward journey. Most internal organs (including the liver, spleen, intestines, kidneys and heart) and the flight muscles lose weight during the journey over the Sahara, although the testes quadruple in mass in preparation for the breeding season. Unlike drier-habitat species like the common whitethroat, they leave from savanna rather than the treeless Sahel further north.|$|E
5|$|In the ground, they dig for {{earthworms}} and grubs, {{and they}} search for beetles, cicada, crickets, flies, weta, spiders, caterpillars, slugs and snails on the ground. They will also feed on <b>berries</b> <b>and</b> seeds. To find prey, the great spotted kiwi use their scenting skills or feel vibrations {{caused by the}} movement of their prey. To do the latter, a kiwi would stick its beak into the ground, then use its beak to dig into the ground. As they are nocturnal, they do not emerge until thirty minutes after sunset to begin the hunt. Kiwis will also swallow small stones, which aid in digestion.|$|E

5|$|In {{the summer}} the {{fieldfare}} frequents mixed woodland of birch, alder, pine, spruce and fir, often near marshes, moorland or other open ground. It does not avoid {{the vicinity of}} humans and {{can be seen in}} cultivated areas, orchards, parks and gardens. It also inhabits open tundra and the slopes of hills above the tree line. In the winter, groups of fieldfares are chiefly found in open country, agricultural land, orchards and open woodland. They are nomadic, wandering wherever there is an abundance of <b>berries</b> <b>and</b> insects. Later in the year they move on to pastureland and cultivated fields.|$|E
5|$|Several {{studies of}} the house sparrow in {{temperate}} agricultural areas have found the proportion of seeds in its diet to be about 90%. It will eat almost any seeds, but where it has a choice, it prefers oats and wheat. In urban areas, the house sparrow feeds largely on food provided directly or indirectly by humans, such as bread, though it prefers raw seeds. The house sparrow also eats some plant matter besides seeds, including buds, <b>berries,</b> <b>and</b> fruits such as grapes and cherries. In temperate areas, the house sparrow has an unusual habit of tearing flowers, especially yellow ones, in the spring.|$|E
5|$|The 100-Mile Diet: A Year of Local Eating (or Plenty: One Man, One Woman, and a Raucous Year of Eating Locally) is a non-fiction {{book written}} by Canadian writers Alisa Smith and J.B. MacKinnon. In the book, the authors recount their experiences, {{including}} motivations and challenges, on restricting their diet, for one year, to include only foods grown within 100 miles of their residence. Beginning in March 2005, with little preparation the urban couple began only purchasing foods with ingredients they knew were all from within 100 miles. Finding little in grocery stores, {{they relied on}} farmers' markets and visits to local farms. Staples in their diet included seafood, chicken, root vegetable, <b>berries,</b> <b>and</b> corn. They lacked cooking oils, rice, and sugar. They preserved foods {{for use in the}} winter but ended with extra supplies.|$|E
