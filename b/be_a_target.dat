The ship was hit by the blast from the first atomic bomb, Able, and was left heavily damaged and radioactive. Unfit for further service, Nevada was decommissioned on 29 August 1946 and sunk for naval gunfire practice on 31 July 1948.|$|E

25|$|In many disease processes, such as cancer, gene {{promoter}} CpG islands acquire abnormal hypermethylation, {{which results in}} transcriptional silencing that can be inherited by daughter cells following cell division. Alterations of DNA methylation have been recognized as {{an important component of}} cancer development. Hypomethylation, in general, arises earlier and is linked to chromosomal instability and loss of imprinting, whereas hypermethylation is associated with promoters and can arise secondary to gene (oncogene suppressor) silencing, but might <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>target</b> for epigenetic therapy.|$|E

Also WLS-TV reported December 15 that Jackson notified investigators that Blagojevich refused to appoint Jackson's wife, Sandi, as state lottery director because Jackson refused to donate $25,000 to the governor's campaign fund.|$|E

25|$|At {{the onset}} of S phase, the pre-replicative complex must be {{activated}} by two S phase-specific kinases in order to form an initiation complex at an origin of replication. One kinase is the Cdc7-Dbf4 kinase called Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK) {{and the other is}} cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK). Chromatin-binding assays of Cdc45 in yeast and Xenopus have shown that a downstream event of CDK action is loading of Cdc45 onto chromatin. Cdc6 has been speculated to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>target</b> of CDK action, because of the association between Cdc6 and CDK, and the CDK-dependent phosphorylation of Cdc6. The CDK-dependent phosphorylation of Cdc6 has been considered to be required for entry into the S phase.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} some {{investigation}} into human CD36 as well. A study examined oral detection of fat in obese subjects with genetic bases for high, medium, and low expression of the CD36 receptor. Those subjects with high CD36 expression were eight times more sensitive to certain fats (oleic acid and triolein) than the subjects with low CD36 expression. Those subjects with an intermediate amount of CD36 expression were sensitive to fat at a level between {{the high and low}} groups. This study demonstrates that there is a significant relationship between oral fat sensitivity and the amount of CD36 receptor expression, but further investigation into CD36 could be useful for learning more about lipid tasting in the context of obesity, as CD36 may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>target</b> for therapies in the future.|$|E
25|$|Angiogenesis may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>target</b> for combating {{diseases}} {{characterized by}} either poor vascularisation or abnormal vasculature. Application of specific compounds that may inhibit or induce {{the creation of}} new blood vessels in the body may help combat such diseases. The presence of blood vessels where there should be none may affect the mechanical properties of a tissue, increasing the likelihood of failure. The absence of blood vessels in a repairing or otherwise metabolically active tissue may inhibit repair or other essential functions. Several diseases, such as ischemic chronic wounds, are the result of failure or insufficient blood vessel formation and may be treated by a local expansion of blood vessels, thus bringing new nutrients to the site, facilitating repair. Other diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration, may be created by a local expansion of blood vessels, interfering with normal physiological processes.|$|E

25|$|When {{melatonin}} receptor agonists activate their receptors {{it causes}} numerous physiological processes. MT1 and MT2 receptors may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>target</b> {{for the treatment}} of circadian and non circadian sleep disorders because of their differences in pharmacology and function within the SCN. The SCN is responsible for maintaining the 24 hour cycle which regulates many different body functions ranging from sleep to immune functions. Melatonin receptors have been identified in the cardiovascular system. Evidence from animal studies points to a dual role of melatonin in the vasculature. Activation of MT1 receptors mediates vasoconstriction and the activation of MT2 receptors mediates vasodilation. Melatonin is involved in regulating immune responses in both human and animals through activation of both MT1 and MT2 receptors. MT1 and MT2 receptors are widespread in the eye and are involved in regulating aqueous humor secretion, which is important for glaucoma, and in phototransduction. This is not a complete list since many of the possible processes need further confirmation.|$|E
25|$|Kasumi {{returns in}} Dead or Alive 5, {{where she is}} unable {{to return to her}} village, lives on the run and {{continues}} to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>target.</b> Kasumi joins forces with Helena to find Alpha-152, refusing help from other characters, including her brother. After defeating her clone, she is attacked and killed by Hayate and Ayane. However, it is revealed that she was an Alpha clone programmed to believe she is the original, while the real Kasumi is in Japan with Ninja Gaidens Muramasa at a hidden village. Kasumi receives a message from the ninja master Ryu Hayabusa, telling her that Hayate is in danger and she is needed in battle. She reaches the oil platform where her brother is, and discovers a secret laboratory belonging to Victor Donovan's new organization, MIST. Kasumi finds that he has created several Alpha clones to sell to the militaries of powerful countries. She frees Hayate, who helps her, Ayane and Ryu destroy Alpha-152 and the laboratory. Afterwards, Kasumi decides to find Donovan and defeat him.|$|E

Trump's tower completed construction in January 2009, just a few blocks west of the Chicago Spire site. If the Chicago Spire had been built as planned, it would have replaced the Trump International Hotel and Tower as the tallest residential structure in the United States, and the two towers would have been in direct competition in selling residential units.|$|E

She further castigated the show for excluding lesbians {{and people of color}} (although she acknowledges that this to an extent mirrored the state of gay leadership at the time) and noted her belief that anti-gay attack videos produced in the 1990s were modeled on this broadcast.
