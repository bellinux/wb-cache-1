5|$|Locomotion {{abilities}} are best studied for Tyrannosaurus {{and there are}} two main issues concerning this: how well it could turn; and what its maximum straight-line speed was likely to have been.Tyrannosaurus may have <b>been</b> <b>slow</b> to turn, possibly taking one to two seconds to turn only 45°– an amount that humans, being vertically oriented and tail-less, can spin in a fraction of a second. The cause of the difficulty is rotational inertia, since much of Tyrannosaurus’ mass was some distance from its center of gravity, like a human carrying a heavy timber.|$|E
5|$|The U2 360° Tour was the highest-grossing tour of 2009, with {{earnings}} of over $311million for the year's 44 shows, and around 3million ticket sales. Due {{to the high}} costs to operate the tour, U2's profits were minimal. Sales of No Line on the Horizon had <b>been</b> <b>slow,</b> meaning the group was not making much money from that either. Through November 2010, the tour's first 66 shows had grossed $443million and sold 4.3million tickets. At the 2010 Billboard Touring Awards, U2 were honored for the year's Top Tour and Top Draw for U2 360°.|$|E

5|$|Carrick {{is a small}} {{historic}} {{village that}} is primarily a residential settlement for those who work in Launceston and the rural areas surrounding the town. Development has <b>been</b> <b>slow</b> and has not changed the town's original 19th century character. The local council's development plan aims to restrict development along Meander Valley road and prevent the merging of Carrick and Hadspen, keeping them as distinct centres. Construction is only planned within the town's boundary, where up to sixty homes could potentially be built under the strategic plan that runs until 2016. The town's development boundary is dictated by the span of sewerage connection. There are few businesses in the town and little incentive for business growth due to the town's small population. The town is in the Meander Valley Council local government area, the Federal Division of Lyons, and the State Division of Lyons.|$|E
5|$|Edward VI acceded to the English throne in 1547, and the Protestant reformers there {{hoped to}} take the {{opportunity}} to more thoroughly reform the Church of England. Archbishop Thomas Cranmer invited Vermigli and Ochino to assist in the effort. In addition, the victory of Catholic Emperor Charles V in the Schmalkaldic War and the resulting Augsburg Interim led to a hostile environment for Protestants in Germany. Vermigli accepted the invitation in November and sailed with Ochino to England. In 1548, he replaced Richard Smyth, becoming the second Regius Professor of Divinity at Oxford. This was a very influential post at a university which had <b>been</b> <b>slow</b> to accept reform.|$|E

50|$|The Athenians {{managed to}} survive for several reasons. First, their foes were lacking in initiative.

5|$|The 18th Armoured Regiment disembarked at Taranto on 22 October 1943 and {{gradually}} travelled north towards the Sangro River, which it duly crossed on 3 December. The advance had <b>been</b> <b>slow</b> due to mine fields and delaying ambushes by the Germans. Pleasants, the regiment's commanding officer, was slightly wounded by artillery fire and Major Hugh Green briefly took over. He was mortally wounded by artillery fire on 3 December {{at the village}} of Melone, {{to the north of}} the Sangro River. Two days later the regiment, with Pleasants back in command, mounted an attack on the German positions at Melone but this failed and seven tanks became stuck. The crews remained with the tanks until they were recovered at the beginning of 1944.|$|E
5|$|The airline's {{growth has}} <b>been</b> <b>slow</b> {{compared}} to other airlines established {{at the same time}} such as IndiGo and SpiceJet, which have larger market share, fleet size and destinations served as of 2016. According to the airline, it is a planned strategy due to the tough aviation environment in India and to focus on maintaining profitability rather than on capturing market share and increasing the destinations and fleet size. As of February 2016, it remains the fifth largest carrier in the country with an 8% market share. The airline is planning for an Initial Public Offering (IPO) in 2016. The airline took delivery of its 20th aircraft in June 2016, making it eligible to operate international flights.|$|E
5|$|The {{fighting}} around Base 5 was {{the final}} action of the fighting in the northern sector of the island, which essentially ended in stalemate. The Australians, under pressure to limit casualties to their largely inexperienced troops, had pursued a cautious campaign and had <b>been</b> <b>slow</b> to regain the initiative in the area following the defeat at Porton Plantation. In contrast, the Japanese commander—Kato—had been skillful and aggressive. On 11 August, {{in anticipation of the}} capitulation of Japan following the dropping of two atomic bombs on Japanese cities, the order to cease offensive combat operations on Bougainville was passed to all Australian units by their commanders.|$|E

The cause of the difficulty is rotational inertia, since much of Tyrannosaurus mass was some distance from its center of gravity, like a human carrying a heavy timber horizontally — although it might have reduced the average distance by arching its back and tail and pulling its head and forelimbs close to its body, rather like the way ice skaters pull their arms closer in order to spin faster.|$|E
5|$|A heated altercation between Ramirez and {{teammate}} Kevin Youkilis {{took place}} on June 5, during a game at Fenway Park against the Tampa Bay Rays. The Boston Globe speculated that Youkilis was angry that Ramirez has <b>been</b> <b>slow</b> to join a bench-clearing brawl earlier in the game. The altercation may have also been caused by Ramirez objecting to what he believed was excessive complaining by Youkilis about the strike zone, {{as well as the}} first baseman's penchant for sometimes throwing his helmet in frustration after making an out. Before the fifth inning, Ramirez was caught on NESN cameras taking a swing at Youkilis. Ramirez and Youkilis yelled at each other and had to be separated by teammates, coaches, and training staff. Youkilis headed out to the field still yelling at Ramirez, while Ramirez was escorted into the tunnel leading to the clubhouse by bench coach Brad Mills and trainer Paul Lessard.|$|E
5|$|Also in {{the region}} was the British 74-gun ship of the line HMS Swiftsure under Captain Benjamin Hallowell, {{a veteran of the}} Battle of the Nile three years earlier. Swiftsure was passing slowly along the North African coast after being {{detached}} from Keith's fleet to join Warren's squadron off Malta, escorting a small convoy en route. Hallowell's ship was understrength as more than 80 men had been removed from the ship for service in Egyptian waters and illness rendered another 59 unfit for duty, while the vessel itself was in a poor state of repair and leaking badly. Progress had <b>been</b> <b>slow,</b> and a northeasterly wind had also significantly delayed Hallowell's passage. When he learned from a passing vessel that there was a French squadron {{in the region}}, he ordered the convoy to separate and sailed for Malta alone in an effort to join Warren more rapidly and warn him of Ganteaume's return. At 03:30 on 24 June his lookouts sighted sails to the southwest. Hallowell immediately assumed that the distant ships were the enemy and he turned away from the French and tacked into the wind. By 05:30, lookouts on the nearest French ships, the ships of the line Jean Bart and Constitution had spotted the distant British vessel and were ordered to give chase.|$|E

5|$|Another {{potential}} {{application of}} lipid bilayers is {{the field of}} biosensors. Since the lipid bilayer is the barrier between the interior and exterior of the cell, {{it is also the}} site of extensive signal transduction. Researchers over the years have tried to harness this potential to develop a bilayer-based device for clinical diagnosis or bioterrorism detection. Progress has <b>been</b> <b>slow</b> in this area and, although a few companies have developed automated lipid-based detection systems, they are still targeted at the research community. These include Biacore (now GE Healthcare Life Sciences), which offers a disposable chip for utilizing lipid bilayers in studies of binding kinetics and Nanion Inc., which has developed an automated patch clamping system. Other, more exotic applications are also being pursued {{such as the use of}} lipid bilayer membrane pores for DNA sequencing by Oxford Nanolabs. To date, this technology has not proven commercially viable.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{expansion}} {{in the number of}} positions available to women and other changes which aim to encourage increased female recruitment and retention, the growth in the proportion of female permanent defence personnel has <b>been</b> <b>slow.</b> In the 1989–1990 financial year women made up 11.4% of the ADF personnel. In the 2008–2009 financial year women occupied 13.5% of ADF positions. During the same period the proportion of civilian positions filled by women in the Australian Defence Organisation increased from 30.8% to 42.8%. As of 30 June 2016, women made up 15.5% of the ADF's permanent force and 16.6% of reservists. The proportion of women in the permanent force differs by service: 12.1% of members of the Army are female, compared to 19.1% of the RAN and 19.2% for the RAAF. In 2015 the ADF adopted targets to increase the proportion of service personnel who are female by 2023: by this time it is planned that women will make up 25% of the RAN, 15% of the Army and 25% of the RAAF.|$|E
