40|$|International audienceWe apply a new tsunami {{vulnerability}} assessment method to two coastal {{villages in the}} Gulf of Corinth, Greece using the 7 th February 1963 tsunami as a worse case scenario. In Akoli, 46. 5 % of all buildings are classified highly vulnerable (BV). Approximately, 26. 3 % of all households are located within <b>buildings</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> High BV classification whereas 85 % of all businesses are located within <b>buildings</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> High BV classification and 13. 7 % {{of the population is}} located within <b>buildings</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> High BV classification. In Selianitika, 28. 8 % of all <b>buildings</b> are classified <b>with</b> <b>a</b> High BV and 11 % of all households are located within <b>buildings</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> High BV classification. Also 29. 3 % of all businesses and 33. 4 % of all services are located within <b>buildings</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> High BV classification and 6. 7 % of the population is located within <b>buildings</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> High BV classification. We estimate the minimum costs of <b>a</b> hypothetical tsunami <b>with</b> <b>a</b> wave run-up (H (m) max) of + 5 m.

The sparse arrangement, with little provision for lighting, has led to suggestions that it was used as stables, however there are no drains which are usually associated with stables. The tower in the northwest corner of the castle had a garderobe and fireplace on each of the three above-ground floors, and there was a basement underneath.|$|E
