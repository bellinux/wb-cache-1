500|$|In March 1930, {{ill health}} {{prevented}} Ferens from attending the company’s Annual Meeting. It {{was the first}} he had missed in 50 years. He had not fulfilled any public engagements for some weeks; nevertheless, he wrote out his speech and it was presented by Sir Harold Reckitt. In the speech Ferens was again able to present the board with pleasing figures. The net profit was £1,277,683, an increase of £33,108 over 1928, which was itself a record year. It {{was a source of}} great gratification for him [...] "to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the most cordial relations exist between the workers, the management and the board".|$|E
500|$|According to Sestero and Greg Ellery, Wiseau {{came to the}} Birns and Sawyer film lot, {{rented a}} studio, and bought a [...] "complete Beginning Director package," [...] which {{included}} the purchase of two brand new film and HD cameras. Wiseau, confused {{about the differences between}} 35 mm film and high-definition video, decided to shoot the entire film in both formats simultaneously, using a custom-built apparatus that housed both cameras side-by-side and required two crews to operate. Commenting on his decision to shoot the film in this way, Wiseau said that he wanted to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> he was the first director to film an entire movie simultaneously in two formats, although ultimately only the 35mm footage was used in the final edit.|$|E
500|$|Around 5:00 pm {{the wind}} began to shift, to British disadvantage. De Grasse gave signals for the van to move further ahead {{so that more}} of the French fleet might engage, but Bougainville, fully engaged with the British van at musket range, {{did not want to}} risk [...] "severe {{handling}} had the French presented the stern." [...] When he did finally begin pulling away, British leaders interpreted it as a retreat: [...] "the French van suffered most, because it was obliged to bear away." [...] Rather than follow, the British hung back, continuing to fire at long range; this prompted one French officer to write that the British [...] "only engaged from far off and simply in order to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> they had fought." [...] Sunset brought an end to the firefight, with both fleets continuing on a roughly southeast tack, away from the bay.|$|E

2500|$|Bloom never pissed me {{off because}} there are critics out there, and he's one of them, who take their ignorance about popular culture as a badge of {{intellectual}} prowess. He might <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Mark Twain is a great writer, but it's {{impossible for him to}} say that there's a direct line of descent from, say, Nathaniel Hawthorne to Jim Thompson because he doesn't read guys like Thompson. He just thinks, [...] "I never read him, but I know he's terrible." ...|$|E
2500|$|In February 2011, Architects {{announced}} {{the departure of}} bassist Alex Dean, due to family commitments. On 3 July 2011 {{it was announced that}} Dean had rejoined the band. When Dean commented on the short 5-month split from the band he said [...] "I'm very happy to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I'm back, being able to stay at home for the past few months have given my family and I the opportunity to adjust to what happened last year and I know it's done us all a lot of good." [...] During this period where Dean was {{not a part of the}} band Casey Lagos filled in as a bass guitarist on some of the tours.|$|E
2500|$|A milder form {{than either}} niddui or herem was the [...] "nezifah" [...] ban. (In modern Hebrew, [...] "nezifah" [...] {{generally}} means [...] "a dressing-down" [...] or [...] "reading (someone) the riot act", i.e., a stern verbal rebuke.) This ban generally only lasted one day. During {{this time the}} offender dared not appear before him whom he had displeased. He had to retire to his house, speak little, refrain from business and pleasure, and manifest his regret and remorse. He was not required, however, to separate himself from society, nor was he obliged to apologize to the man whom he had insulted; for his conduct {{on the day of}} nezifah was sufficient apology. But when a scholar or prominent man actually pronounced the formal niddui on one who had slighted him, all the laws of niddui applied. This procedure was, however, much discouraged by the sages, so that {{it was a matter of}} proper pride for a rabbi to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> he had never pronounced the ban of excommunication. Maimonides concludes with these words the chapter on the laws of excommunication:(Mishneh Torah, Talmud Torah, vii. 13).|$|E

2500|$|During {{his visit}} to Chile, John Paul II {{supported}} the Vicariate of Solidarity, the Church-led pro-democracy, anti-Pinochet organisation. John Paul II visited the Vicariate of Solidarity's offices, spoke with its workers, and [...] "called upon them to continue their work, emphasizing that the Gospel consistently urges respect for human rights". While in Chile, Pope John Paul II made gestures of public support of Chile's anti-Pinochet democratic opposition. For instance, he hugged and kissed Carmen Gloria Quintana, a young student burned alive by Chilean police {{and told her that}} [...] "We must pray for peace and justice in Chile." [...] Later, he met with several opposition groups, including those that had been declared illegal by Pinochet's government. The opposition praised John Paul II for denouncing Pinochet as a [...] "dictator", for many members of Chile's opposition were persecuted for much milder statements. Bishop Carlos Camus, one of the harshest critics of Pinochet's dictatorship within the Chilean Church, praised John Paul II's stance during the papal visit: [...] "I am quite moved, because our pastor supports us totally. Never again will anyone <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> we are interfering in politics when we defend human dignity." [...] He added: [...] "No country the Pope has visited has remained the same after his departure. The Pope's visit is a mission, an extraordinary social catechism, and his stay here will be a watershed in Chilean history." ...|$|E
2500|$|A Midrash {{read the}} words of [...] "he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt [...] [...] [...] but there was none that could {{interpret}} them for Pharaoh," [...] to teach that every {{nation in the world}} appoints five wise men as its ministers. And God grants each nation wisdom, understanding, and strength. When God judges the world, God takes these things away from the nation that God punishes, as [...] says, [...] "‘Shall I not in that day,' says the Lord, ‘destroy the wise men out of Edom, and discernment [...] out of the mount of Esau? And your mighty men, O Teman, shall be dismayed — broken.'" [...] The Midrash taught that the purpose of all this sending for and failing of magicians was so that Joseph might come at the end and be raised to high rank. God saw that if Joseph came at the beginning and interpreted the dream, Joseph would gain little praise, for the magicians would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> had one asked them, we would have interpreted the dream long before. Therefore, God waited until the magicians had wearied and had exhausted Pharaoh's spirit, and then Joseph came and restored it. Thus [...] "A fool spends all his spirit," [...] refers to Pharaoh's magicians, and the continuation of [...] "But a wise man stills it within him," [...] alludes to Joseph, as [...] reports that Pharaoh said to Joseph, [...] "There is none so discreet and wise as you." ...|$|E
