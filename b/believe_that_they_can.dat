5|$|Heathen deities are {{not seen}} as perfect, omnipotent, and omnipresent, and are instead viewed as having their own {{strengths}} and weaknesses. Many practitioners believe that these deities will one day die, as did, for instance, the god Baldr in Norse mythology. Heathens view their connection with their deities not as being that of a master and servant but rather as an interdependent relationship akin {{to that of a}} family. For them, these deities serve as both examples and role models whose behavior is to be imitated. Many practitioners <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> communicate with these deities, as well as negotiate, bargain, and argue with them, and hope that through venerating them, practitioners will gain wisdom, understanding, power, or visionary insights.|$|E
5|$|Justification {{for using}} the Sunnah {{as a source of}} law {{can be found in the}} Qur'an. The Qur'an {{commands}} Muslims to follow Muhammad. During his lifetime, Muhammad made it clear that his traditions (along with the Qur'an) should be followed after his death. The overwhelming majority of Muslims consider the sunnah to be essential supplements to and clarifications of the Qur'an. In Islamic jurisprudence, the Qur'an contains many rules for the behavior expected of Muslims but there are no specific Qur'anic rules on many religious and practical matters. Muslims <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> look at the way of life, or sunnah, of Muhammad and his companions to discover what to imitate and what to avoid.|$|E
25|$|The {{opportunity}} to be an entrepreneur arises with the fulfillment of four criteria. First, there must exist opportunities or situations in which people <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> use new means-ends frameworks to recombine resources to generate profit. Second, entrepreneurship requires differences between people. Specifically, the preferential access to or ability to recognize information about opportunities. Third, risk bearing is {{a necessary part of}} the entrepreneurial process. Fourth, the entrepreneurial process requires the organization of people and resources.|$|E

50|$|Intermetamorphosis is a {{delusional}} misidentification syndrome, {{related to}} agnosia. The main symptoms consist of patients <b>believing</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> see others change into {{someone else in}} both external appearance and internal personality. The disorder is usually comorbid with neurological disorders or mental disorders.|$|R
25|$|There {{is nothing}} solid {{left in the}} Players' Protective Association. There has been no {{activity}} {{on the part of}} the present officials, and there will be none. The organization has been allowed to die because the members have seen nothing in it to interest them. Some are not pleased with the officers; others object to the paying of dues, while others still <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> do better by themselves than by acting in concert with all the other players; and so the Players' Protective Association gradually is being allowed to die out. One hears but little of it now, and in a year from now will hear less. It would have been a good thing for the players if they had been true to its principles and the officials had been active in carrying out all its aims and laws. However, there was failure on all sides, and the result is that the organization gradually is fading out of existence.|$|E
500|$|However, {{despite these}} {{widespread}} feelings of fatalism, some men <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> avoid HIV contraction by modifying their personal behaviors. Men who decide {{to change their}} behaviors to reduce their risk of infection are unlikely to use condoms consistently, particularly during marital intercourse; instead, they usually continue engaging in extramarital sexual relations, but alter {{the ways in which}} they choose their sexual partners. For example, before selecting extramarital sexual partners, men sometimes survey their peers to determine whether their potential partners are likely to have exposed themselves to the virus. Men who choose their sexual partners based on external appearances and peer recommendations often believe that women who violate traditional gender norms by, for example, wearing modern clothing are more likely to carry HIV, while young girls, who are perceived as sexually inexperienced, are considered [...] "pure." [...] Because of this perception, many people are concerned that schoolchildren in Malawi, particularly girls, are becoming exposed to the virus through sexual harassment or abuse by their instructors.|$|E

We believe the highest and best use of the property is with the good people of Catasauqua because it can be used for so many community type events." ...|$|E
50|$|Northern {{religions}} {{contain the}} notion of dual deities found in the southwest, although the two often complement rather than oppose each other. Ancestral spirits are especially important, because it is <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> directly influence an individual's fortunes in this life.|$|R

2500|$|Under the {{doctrine}} of continuing revelation, Latter-day Saints believe that the church president is a modern-day [...] "prophet, seer, and revelator" [...] and that Jesus Christ, {{under the direction of}} God the Father, leads the church by revealing his will to its president. The current president is Thomas S. Monson. Individual members of the church <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> also receive personal revelation from God in conducting their lives. The president heads a hierarchical structure with various levels reaching down to local congregations. Bishops, drawn from the laity, lead local congregations. Male members, after reaching age 12, may be ordained to the priesthood, provided they are living the standards of the church. Women do not hold positions within the priesthood, but do occupy leadership roles in some church auxiliary organizations.|$|E
2500|$|In 1864, Niccolò Turrisi Colonna, {{leader of}} the Palermo National Guard, wrote of a [...] "sect of thieves" [...] that {{operated}} throughout Sicily. This [...] "sect" [...] was mostly rural, composed of cattle thieves, smugglers, wealthy farmers, and their guards. The sect made [...] "affiliates {{every day of the}} brightest young people coming from the rural class, of the guardians of the fields in the Palermitan countryside, and of the large number of smugglers; a sect which gives and receives protection to and from certain men who make a living on traffic and internal commerce. It is a sect with little or no fear of public bodies, because its members <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> easily elude this." [...] It had special signals to recognize each other, offered protection services, scorned the law, and had a code of loyalty and non-interaction with the police known as umirtà ("code of silence"). Colonna warned in his report that the Italian government's brutal and clumsy attempts to crush crime only made the problem worse by alienating the populace. An 1865 dispatch from the prefect of Palermo to Rome first officially described the phenomenon as a [...] "Mafia". An 1876 police report makes the earliest known description of the familiar initiation ritual.|$|E

50|$|Social {{cognitive}} theory posits that learning most likely occurs {{if there is}} a close identification between the observer and the model and if the observer also has a good deal of self-efficacy.

Self-efficacy beliefs function as an important set of proximal determinants of human motivation, affect, and action—which operate on action through motivational, cognitive, and affective intervening processes.|$|R

I do not <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be furthered, except very rarely, by revolution and war; and I am convinced that at the present moment they can only be promoted by a diminution in the spirit of ruthlessness generated by the war. For these reasons, while admitting the necessity and even utility of Bolshevism in Russia, I do not wish to see it spread, or to encourage the adoption of its philosophy by advanced parties in the Western nations.|$|E

A correct diagnosis is necessarily the first step toward a cure. The existing evils in international relations spring, at bottom, from psychological causes, from motives forming part of human nature as it is at present. Among these the chief are competitiveness, love of power, and envy, using envy in that broad sense in which it includes the instinctive dislike of any gain to others not accompanied by an at least equal gain to ourselves. The evils arising from these three causes can be removed by a better education and a better economic and political system.|$|E
