5|$|During {{the early}} stages of development, in-game {{dialogue}} was recorded in Los Angeles by local Asian actors, <b>but</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> audio was then re-recorded in Hong Kong through Drum Music, a specialist recording company. Audio design was complicated; scripting was handled in Vancouver and the recording was in Hong Kong. There were reservations among the developers about the language for the background dialogue; the sound design team eventually prevailed in using Hong Kong Cantonese over English.|$|E

5|$|Historically, {{the first}} ideas leading to vector spaces {{can be traced}} back as far as the 17th century's {{analytic}} geometry, matrices, systems of linear equations, and Euclidean vectors. The modern, more abstract treatment, first formulated by Giuseppe Peano in 1888, encompasses more general objects than Euclidean space, <b>but</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> theory can be seen as an extension of classical geometric ideas like lines, planes and their higher-dimensional analogs.|$|E

5|$|By 1300 only Harlech and Conwy {{had been}} {{properly}} completed: Caernarfon's town walls were finished, <b>but</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> castle was still incomplete and at Beaumaris Castle the inner walls {{was only half}} their intended height, with gaps in the outer walls. By 1304 the total building programme in Wales had come to at least £80,000, almost six times Edward's annual income. Edward had meanwhile become embroiled in a long-running sequence of wars in Scotland which began to consume his attention and financial resources, {{and as a result}} further work on the Welsh castles slowed to a crawl. In 1306 Edward became concerned about a possible Scottish invasion of North Wales, spurring fresh construction work, but money remained much more limited than before. By 1330 all new work had finally ceased, and Caernarfon and Beaumaris were never fully completed.|$|E
5|$|During the inter-war {{years the}} {{navigation}} struggled {{to hold its}} own against competition from the railways and later the roads, and was affected by miners' strikes in the coal industry. Traffic was spasmodic, rising from 381,727 tonnes in 1926, {{the year of the}} general strike, to 815,329 tonnes in 1937, <b>but</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> latter was short-haul traffic, rather than long-haul, and the revenues did not increase correspondingly. In an agreement with Hatfield Main Colliery and the Aire and Calder, Bramwith Lock on the Stainforth and Keadby Canal was lengthened in 1932, to allow compartment boats to be used for the coal traffic, while straightening of a stretch near Doncaster and {{the construction of a new}} warehouse and wharf were largely funded by Doncaster Corporation in 1934.|$|E

5|$|In {{the ensuing}} period many {{thousands}} of country houses of great architectural value were demolished, or had whole wings razed to the ground. In 1955 alone one house was demolished every five days. In this respect Belton was fortunate to survive at all, as {{in addition to the}} family's problems, the house deteriorated {{to such an extent that}} in 1961 the 6th Baron employed the architect Francis Johnson to oversee a large restoration program lasting three years. Not only was the roof repaired <b>but</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> panelling taken down and repaired, and new cornices installed. Also attempts were made to curtail serious infestations of dry rot. By the time of the death of the 6th Baron in 1978, the resultant death duties, coupled with the rising costs of the upkeep, made Belton too much for the Brownlow family.|$|E
5|$|Nearby is {{the former}} site of St. Mary's (Whitechapel Road) tube station. It opened in March 1884 but its close {{proximity}} to both Whitechapel and Aldgate East tube stations made it superfluous, leading to its closure in April 1938. It {{was used as an}} air raid shelter in the Second World War, but was destroyed by bombing in 1940. Opposite to the south {{is the former}} Royal London Hospital building, built in 1740.

5|$|Princes Street was {{developed}} during Dunedin's 1860s boom from the Central Otago gold rush, and consequently {{is one of}} New Zealand's most historic streets, with about 70 buildings in close proximity listed on the New Zealand Historic Places Trust Register. Originally {{the site of the}} city's wharf, a substantial area of land to the east of the street was formerly part of Otago Harbour, much of it reclaimed via rock removed during the lowering of Bell Hill which separated Princes Street from northern Dunedin {{in the early years of}} settlement.

5|$|In the United States, initial {{support to}} develop {{alternative}} fuels {{by the government}} was also {{a response to the}} first oil crisis, and some time later, as a goal to improve air quality. Also, liquid fuels were preferred over gaseous fuels not only because they have a better volumetric energy density but also because they were the most compatible fuels with existing distribution systems and engines, thus avoiding a big departure from the existing technologies and taking advantage of the vehicle and the refueling infrastructure. California led the search of sustainable alternatives with interest focused in methanol. Ford Motor Company and other automakers responded to California's request for vehicles that run on methanol. In 1981, Ford delivered 40 dedicated methanol fuel (M100) Escorts to Los Angeles County, but only four refueling stations were installed. The biggest challenge in the development of alcohol vehicle technology was getting all of the fuel system materials compatible with the higher chemical reactivity of the fuel. Methanol was even more of a challenge than ethanol <b>but</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> early experience gained with neat ethanol vehicle production in Brazil was transferable to methanol. The success of this small experimental fleet of M100s led California to request more of these vehicles, mainly for government fleets. In 1983, Ford built 582 M100 vehicles; 501 went to California, and the remaining to New Zealand, Sweden, Norway, United Kingdom, and Canada.|$|E
5|$|John de la Pole's {{attainder}} {{meant that}} his brother Edmund inherited their father's titles, <b>but</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wealth of the duchy of Suffolk was forfeit. Edmund did not possess sufficient finances to maintain {{his status as a}} duke, so as a compromise he accepted the title of earl of Suffolk. Financial difficulties led to frequent legal conflicts and Edmund's indictment for murder in 1501. He fled with his brother Richard, while their remaining brother, William, was imprisoned in the Towerwhere he would remain until his death 37 years lateras part of a general suppression of Edmund's associates Philip the Fair had been holding Edmund and in 1506 he returned him to Henry. Edmund was imprisoned in the Tower. In 1513, he was executed after Richard de la Pole, whom Louis XII of France had recognised as king of England the previous year, claimed the kingship in his own right. Richard, known as the White Rose, plotted an invasion of England for years but was killed in 1525 at the Battle of Pavia while fighting as the captain of the French landsknechts during François I of France's invasion of Italy.|$|E
5|$|McCall {{still had}} one year {{left on his}} Rangers {{contract}} in 1998, <b>but</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> team that Walter Smith had built had left and McCall was allowed to leave on a free transfer by new manager Dick Advocaat, {{as long as he}} joined an English club. Barnsley and Huddersfield Town were both interested in signing McCall, but he rejoined Bradford City as club captain. Rookie manager Paul Jewell put together a squad which emerged as surprise promotion contenders after two seasons spent battling relegation, adding other new signings, including central midfield partner Gareth Whalley and striker Lee Mills, who went on to be club's top goal-scorer. The season started off slowly with just one win from the first seven games, but by {{the latter half of the}} season, City were vying with Ipswich Town and Birmingham City for the second promotion spot behind runaway leaders Sunderland. Loan signing Lee Sharpe and Dean Windass were added to the ranks and City had the chance to seal promotion in their penultimate game against relegation-threatened Oxford United. The game finished as a 0–0 draw, with McCall heading over the goal in the final minutes, taking the promotion bid to the final game of the season. Days later he was named the club's player of the year. A 3–2 victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers at Molineux on 9 May 1999 ensured promotion to the Premier League and denied Ipswich Town – the team that had thwarted McCall and Bradford 11 years before.|$|E

25|$|Pockets of Georgian {{architecture}} {{survived the}} war, <b>but</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city was levelled. There has been extensive redevelopment since World War II.
