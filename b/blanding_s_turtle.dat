40|$|We {{document}} {{and describe the}} change in attitudes, hunting behaviour and historic subsistence use of sea turtles by Cocos Malay people of Islamic faith in the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Indian Ocean over the last 180 years. We used several lines of evidence including historical documents, scientific journals, archived records and interviews with current and former residents. The results are grouped in two time categories: 1) use of turtles prior to mid- 1980 s and 2) use of turtles after mid- 1980 s. Prior to the mid- 1980 <b>s,</b> <b>turtle</b> meat was popular with Muslim residents and was consumed when available and was particularly appreciated during times of ceremony.

CFPHV glycoprotein H (gH) expressed in recombinant baculovirus was used in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect virus-specific 7 <b>S</b> <b>turtle</b> antibodies. Using captive-reared green turtles (Chelonia mydas) with no history of virus exposure as “known negatives” and others with experimentally induced FP as “known positives,” the assay had 100 % specificity but low sensitivity, as seroconversion was detected in {{only half of the}} turtles bearing experimentally induced tumors. Antibodies were detected only in samples collected after cutaneous fibropapillomas appeared, consistent with observations that tumors are significant sites of virion production and antigen expression and the possibility that prolonged/repeated virus shedding may be required for adequate stimulation of 7 S antibody responses to gH. Natural routes of infection, however, may produce higher seroconversion rates. High gH antibody seroprevalences (∼ 80 %) were found among wild green turtles in three Florida localities with different FP prevalences, including one site with no history of FP. In addition, all eight loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) tested were seropositive despite FP being uncommon in this species. The possibility that CFPHV infection may be common relative to disease suggests roles for environmental and host factors as modulators of disease expression. Alternatively, the possibility of other antigenically similar herpesviruses present in wild populations cannot be excluded, although antibody cross-reactivity with the lung/eye/trachea disease-associated herpesvirus was ruled out in this study...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The {{distribution}} and {{natural history of}} amphibians and reptiles have been little studied in the northern states of the great plains. Relative to other vertebrate groups, the herpetofauna of grasslands is depauperate particularly at higher latitudes where temperature becomes a limiting factor to poikilotherms. Nevertheless, certain species of amphibians and reptiles are common in specific habitats and thus form a conspicuous component of the prairie fauna. The purposes {{of the present study}} were to document the distributions of herpetiles in a specified region of western Nebraska and to describe general aspects of their natural history. We hope such information will stimulate additiona work as well as provide a baseline reference for future studies on the herpetofauna of the northern great plains. Previous work on herpetiles in western Nebraska are either in need of updating (e. g. Hudson, 1942) or are anecdotal or not comprehensive (Heyl and Smith, 1957; Gehlbach and Collette, 1959; Iverson, 1975; Lynch, 1978). Summary: The herpetofauna of the seven county study area in western Nebraska may be characterized in general by a preponderance of organisms exhibiting both wide geographical and wide ecological distributions and tolerances. Species exhibiting little microhabitat specificity and which are found widely throughout the region include the tiger salamander, spadefoot toad, rocky mountain toad, striped chorus frog, lesser earless lizard, fence lizard, racerunner, common racer, bullsnake, red-sided garter snake, plains garter snake, snapping turtle and painted turtle.

Icarus 176, 351 - 381) {{developed}} a useful {{test for the}} internal consistency of crater-count chronometry systems. They argued that certain multi-kilometer, fresh-looking martian craters with prominent rays should be the youngest or near-youngest craters in their size range. The "McEwen et al. test" is that the ages determined from crater densities of the smallest superimposed craters (typically diameter D similar to 5 - 20 m) should thus be comparable to the expected formation intervals of the host primary. McEwen et al. concluded from MOC data that crater chronometry failed this test by factors of 700 - 2000. We apply HiRISE and other imagery to eight different young craters in order to re-evaluate their arguments. We use existing crater chronology systems as well as the reported observed production rate of 16 m craters (Malin, MC., Edgett, K., Posiolova, L., McColley, S., Noe Dobrea, E. [2006]. Science 314, 1573 - 1557; Hartmann, W. K., Quantin, C., Mangold, N. [2007]. Icarus 186, 11 - 23; Kreslavsky [2007]. Seventh International Conference on Mars, 3325). Every case passes the McEwen et al. test. We conclude that the huge inconsistencies suggested by McEwen et al. are spurious. Many of these craters show evidence of impact into ice-rich material, and appear to have ice-flow features and sublimation pits on their floors. As production rate data improve, decameter-scale craters will provide a valuable way of dating these young martian geological formations and the processes that modify the...|$|R

40|$|The slit (sli) gene, {{encoding}} a secreted glycoprotein, {{has been}} demonstrated to {{play a vital role}} in axonal guidance in Drosophila melanogaster by acting as a signalling ligand for the robe receptor (Rothberg, J.

Multiple homologs of both sli and robe have been identified in vertebrates and are thought to play similar roles to their fly counterparts in neural development (Brose, K., <b>Bland,</b> K. <b>S.,</b> Wang, K.

Cell 96, 795 - 806). Slit 2 has been shown to bind Robo 1, mediating both neuronal and axonal guidance in the developing central nervous system (CNS), (Brose et al., 1999; Hu, H., 1999. Chemorepulsion of neuronal migration by Slit 2 in the developing mammalian forebrain. Neuron 23, 703 - 711). Importantly, both gene families display distinct expression patterns outside the CNS (Holmes, G. P., Negus, K., Burridge, L., Raman, S., Algar, E., Yamada, T., Little, M. H., 1998. Distinct but overlapping expression patterns of two vertebrate slit homologs implies functional roles in CNS development and organogenesis. Mech. Dev. 79, 57 - 72; Yuan, W., Zhou, L., Chen, J.

Using in situ hybridization on metanephric explant cultures and urogenital tract sections, the expression patterns of Slit 1, 2, 3 and Robo 1 and 2 were investigated during murine metanephric development. Slit 1 was expressed in the metanephric mesenchyme (MM) surrounding the invading ureteric tree (UT). Slit 2 was expressed at the tips of the UT and both Slit 2 and Slid were expressed at the far proximal end of the comma shaped and S-shaped bodies. Expression of Robo 1 was initially diffuse throughout the MM, then upregulated in the pretubular aggregates, and maintained at the distal end of the comma and S-shaped bodies. Robo 2 was detected in the induced MM surrounding the arborizing UT tips and later in the proximal end of the S-shaped bodies. Coincident expression of Robo 1 with Slit 1 in the metanephric mesenchyme and Robo 2, Slit 2 and Slid in the far proximal end of the S-shaped bodies was observed during metanephric development.

40|$|Bibliography: p. 147 - 160. Protective {{gillnets}} (shark nets) {{have been}} successful in reducing the frequency of shark attacks on the coast of KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), South Africa. This is achieved primarily through a reduction in numbers of large sharks. The nets also take a by-catch of dolphins, sea turtles, batoids and teleosts. Catch rates of most shark species declined initially but have shown no trend since the mid- 1970 <b>s.</b> <b>Turtle</b> and teleost stocks {{do not appear to be}} threatened by net mortalities, but there is concern about the sustainability of catches of the humpback dolphin. Certain batoids may have declined despite a high release rate. A published contention that shark netting has resulted in a proliferation of small sharks through reduced predation is re-examined and considered to be exaggerated. Reduced predation on dolphins, as a result of shark netting, is estimated. Considerably less fishing effort is applied in the shark control programs of New South Wales and Queensland, Australia, than in that of KZN. On the basis of a comparison of factors such as the nearshore physical environments and trends in shark catch and catch rate, it is concluded that the number of nets used in KZN could be reduced. To test whether a 70 cm mesh would continue to capture potentially dangerous sharks, while at the same time reducing by-catch, a gamma distribution model was used to determine length-specific selectivities in 50. 8 cm and 70 cm mesh nets respectively. A reduction in relative selectivity from 81 to 25 for a shark of 1. 6 m PCL would result from an increase in mesh size from 50. 8 to 70 cm. Despite a probable reduction in catch of dolphins. and certain other by-catch species, the introduction of the larger mesh would constitute an unacceptable reduction in levels of bather safety. Baited lines, or drumlines, were tested as possible alternatives to gillnets. They demonstrated greater species selectivity for sharks, including a higher catch of two of the target species, Carcharhinus leucas and Galeocerdo cuvier, and also a reduced by-catch of nonshark animals. The probability of the bait being scavenged, or a shark being caught, was modelled in relation to a number of physical factors. Although there were insufficient data for a quantitative comparison of catch rates between nets and drumlines, the results indicated that an optimal solution may be to deploy a combination of nets, using the existing 50. 8 cm mesh, and drumlines, using 14 / 0 shark hooks...|$|R

40|$|Northern Plains Borders and the People in Between is a {{transnational}} {{history of}} colonialism and mixed, mobile indigenous {{people in the}} borderlands of the northern Great Plains from 1860 to 1940. Based on archival documents from Canada and the United States, it focuses on social, spatial, political and legal developments. It demonstrates that when American and Canadian militaries invaded, they relied on and targeted mixed indigenous communities. Members of these communities were affiliated with tribes across the region, and moved often and far. As they mixed and moved, {{they were involved in}} the many different conflicts that wracked the Northern Plains after 1860, and they physically linked period violence in Canada and the United States. Subsequently, both countries incorporated Plains inhabitants through Indian treaties and state status categories that created mutually-exclusive, spatialized legal classifications—American or Canadian, Sioux or Cree, Métis, Indian, citizen, or alien. These classifications conveyed different rights, and status and rights were tightly tied to particular places, like homesteads, or nations or specific Indian reservations. One’s legal status thus had direct material implications, linking boundaries of race, place, tribe, and band to land. On both sides of the international line, these social and spatial borders criminalized mixture and mobility. With the concurrent spread of allotment and tribal enrollment, many borderlands indigenes were left stateless—they were excluded from every legal category through which Canada and the U. S. allocated status and rights. This study shows how statelessness flowed through prior racial, tribal and spatial classifications—like enrolled member of the U. <b>S.</b> <b>Turtle</b> Mountain Chippewa Indians. It wasn’t just the international boundary that created indigenous statelessness, but the multi-faceted and layered boundary-making of settler colonialism. For indigenous people, tribal membership boundaries, or enrollment, became the most significant aspect of allotment, both in terms of land loss and in terms of enduring community consequences. This dissertation concludes that statelessness originated not in overseas imperialism but in the earlier colonization of the continent. It also finds that the most critical implications of statelessness were material: stateless indigenes were not just landless, or homeless, but worse—their mere presence was forbidden everywhere. Legally, they had the right to occupy no place, no space. In this context, people contested their statelessness, pursuing legal status, rights and property into the 20 th century. This study maps that ongoing political activity and associated mobility, revealing enduring indigenous geographies in a period when Indian people have been considered politically inactive, and reservation-bound. It shows how, into the 1940 s, indigenous mixture and movement entwined Canadian and American histories, making them not just parallel but inseparable. Ultimately, it engages discussions of space, power, violence, law and the state as they relate to histories of borderlands, frontiers, and the West, Native Americans, First Nations, immigration and race...|$|R

To {{determine the extent of}} S. invicta infestation of sea turtle nesting beaches, we sampled known nesting beaches throughout the state of Florida. Beach surveys indicated that S. invicta are present and often abundant on most beaches and dunes along the Florida coast...|$|R

We {{are based}} at Hawkesbury (Richmond) and we {{research}} and consult on Australian Native & Pest Animal ecology & management. WildLab {{is headed by}} Dr Ricky Spencer, who is a Senior Lecturer of Zoology, but WildLab consists of Post-docs, PhD and Honours students, as well as research assistants, that are dedicated to the conservation of Australia 2 ̆ 7 s native wildlife. WildLab is also committed to integrating traditional Science with Citizen Science. We have developed a range of tools to facilitate active engagement with the community. Please look at our Citizen Science page for more detail. TurtleSAT is our Flagship program where where communities are mapping the location of freshwater turtles in waterways and wetlands across the country. Australia 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> unique freshwater <b>turtles</b> are in crisis - their numbers are declining and your help is needed to record where you see turtles in your local area...|$|R
40|$|Long-term {{data are}} {{critical}} for assessing the status, trends, abundance, and distributions of wildlife populations. However, such data streams are often lacking for protected species, especially highly mobile marine vertebrates. Using five decades of aerial surveys, we assessed changes in marine megafauna on the insular coral reef ecosystem of Guam (Marianas Archipelago in Micronesia). The data allowed estimates of relative abundance, trends, and geographic distributions for several important taxa: sea turtles, sharks, manta rays, small delphinids, and large delphinids. These surveys occurred in 32 years from 1963 - 2012 amounting to 632 flights lasting 809 hours over a 70. 16 km 2 area. Over this span, surveyors recorded 10, 622 turtle, 1, 026 shark, 60 manta ray, 7, 515 small delphinid, and 95 large delphinid observations. Since the 1960 <b>s,</b> sea <b>turtles</b> increased {{an order of magnitude}} (r = 0. 07) and sharks decreased five-fold (r = - 0. 03). Turtle increases were largely restricted to one geographical area, where optimal habitat coincides with low human density and a marine protected area. Shark observations declined proximate to human population centers. Trends for the other taxa were less informative, but each taxon had geographic foci. Protections in the region may be working to recover turtle populations, but failing (or have not yet had sufficient time) to recover overfished shark populations. Long-term analyses of vulnerable marine megafauna in this data-limited region are uncommon, and should be used to guide more focused studies that inform regional management and conservation of these species...|$|R
