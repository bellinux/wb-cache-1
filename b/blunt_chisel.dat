2500|$|A final {{layer of}} adornments {{added to the}} helmet a crest, eyebrows, nose and mouth piece, and three dragon heads. A hollow iron crest ran {{across the top of}} the cap and {{terminated}} at front and back. It was made of [...] "D-sectioned" [...] tubing and consisted of two parts, an inverted [...] "U-shaped" [...] piece into which a [...] "flat bottom strip" [...] was placed. As no traces of solder remain, the crest may have been either forged or shrunk on to the cap. From either end of the crest extended an iron tang, to each of which was riveted a gilded dragon head. That on the front was made of cast bronze, while the one on the rear was made of [...] "a different alloy, and now consists largely of tin oxide." [...] A third dragon head, also of cast bronze, faced upwards on the front of the helmet and broke the plane between face mask and cap; its neck rested on the face mask, while under its eyes it was held to the cap by [...] "a massive rivet shank." [...] To either side of the neck projected a hollow cast bronze eyebrow, into each of which was inlaid parallel silver wires separated by niello. Terminal boar heads were gilded, as were the undersides of the eyebrows, where individual bronze cells held square garnets. The eyebrows were riveted on, both to the cap at their outer ends and to the tang of a nose and mouth piece which extended upwards underneath the neck of the dragon head. This tang was itself riveted to the cap, one of five attachment points for the cast bronze nose and mouth piece. Both sides of the nose featured [...] "two small round projecting plates," [...] connected by fluted and swaged strips, and concealing rivets. An inlaid strip of wire extended the length of the nasal ridge, next to which the [...] "background was punched down" [...] and filled with niello, leaving [...] "triangles in relief" [...] that were silvered. A tracer (a [...] "rather <b>blunt</b> <b>chisel</b> [...] [...] [...] used chiefly for outlining") was used to provide a grooved border on each side. Running horizontally aside the nasal bridge were three punched circles per side, inlaid with silver and surrounded by niello. Beneath these circles, also running horizontally from the center of the nose to its sides were chased [...] "alternate rows of plain flutings and billeted strips which run obliquely between the central strip and a billeted lower edge." [...] This same pattern is repeated in vertical fashion on the moustache. The curve along the bevelled lower lip, in turn, repeats the circled pattern used on the nasal bridge. Excepting the portions covered by the eyebrows and dragon head, or adorned with silver or niello, the nose and mouth piece was heavily gilded, which is suggested by the presence of mercury to have been [...] "applied by the fire-gilding technique." ...|$|E
30|$|After wedge removal, the resected wedge is {{inspected}} for completeness as remaining bone fragments {{may cause}} incomplete closure and fracture of the medial cortical hinge during closure. If this is found, additional bone removal and {{weakening of the}} hinge (with help of a special bone impaction instrumentâ€”a <b>blunt</b> <b>chisel)</b> are then indicated. Closure of the wedge must be performed gradually and with a gentle valgus force. It may take several minutes to enable plastic deformation of the medial cortex to close the osteotomy gap. It {{should be noted that}} the medial cortex of the distal femur in general is weaker and the hinge point of the osteotomy will fracture more often as compared to the lateral cortex hinge point in a medial closing-wedge osteotomy. An intact medial cortex after osteotomy closure provides for higher axial and rotational stability.|$|E
40|$|A CAJM {{article on}} bone fractures. It is now well {{recognised}} that fractures {{of the head}} of the radius are not trivial injuries, but are due to the elbow joint being subjected to a considerable degree of violence. The injury usually occurs when the patient falls on to the outstretched hand {{and the head of the}} radius is driven violently against the capitellum, which acts rather like a <b>blunt</b> <b>chisel</b> and either impacts the radial head or else splinters off a portion of it. The capitellum itself often suffers a considerable degree of damage to its articular cartilage, although this does not usually show on routine X-rays. Unless the crack in the head of the radius is of a very trivial nature, operation should be advised in order to excise the radial head. This should not be delayed for more than a few days, and I have found that the best results are obtained if the operation can be performed within a few hours of the injury. Attempts have been made to replace the radial head with plastic or metal inserts, but I do not consider that this procedure is' advisable and that experimental surgery of this nature should be left to large clinics, where the problem can be properly evaluated...|$|E
