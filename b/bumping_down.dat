Another curious meal wafted from {{the bowels of the}} earth and cooled by all the airs that blow,--then the shawl-straps were girded anew, the carriage (a half-grown omnibus with the jaundice) mounted, the farewell bows and adieux received, and forth rumbled the duchesses en route for Blois.|$|E

5000|$|On September 24, 2012, FYÜTCH {{released}} the mixtape Mr. Flattop. It contains 12 songs and {{begins with an}} intro from executive producer and DJ Robb 'Sir' Lazenby. Music City Interactive journalist Shad Reed compared it to J. Prince's intros on Rap-A-lot records. Mr. Flattop has features from rappers Mike Stud, Futuristic, Mello Rello, singer Whitney Coleman, and production by G-Pop, Wick-it the Instigator, and The FANS. Sean Maloney from The Nashville Scene wrote, [...] "Mr. Flattop, the first release under his new nom de plume, is a well-executed post-collegiate party-rap tape with plenty of pop hooks and big <b>bumping</b> <b>Down</b> South bass." [...] He adds, [...] "the real gem on Flattop is [...] "Set Me Free," [...] produced by longtime collaborator and P&B favorite Wick-It. It's got a gorgeous hook and a deep, mournful groove {{that you might not}} expect if you hadn't been watching both of these artist develop over the last half-decade." [...] FYÜTCH began his promotional tour for the album at the A3C Hip Hop Festival in Atlanta, GA.|$|E
50|$|Loving premiered on June 26, 1983 as {{a two-hour}} primetime movie. It starred {{much of the}} {{original}} cast and featured film actors Lloyd Bridges and Geraldine Page. Set in the fictional town of Corinth, Pennsylvania, {{the early years of}} the show revolved around the blue-collar Donovans and the blue-blood Aldens. Major social issues such as incest, alcoholism, and post-traumatic stress syndrome of Vietnam vets were covered. But Marland and Nixon left the series after a few years and in spite of ABC's <b>bumping</b> <b>down</b> Ryan's Hope to give Loving a choice timeslot, and cast additions of such popular All My Children stars as Debbi Morgan and Jean LeClerc, the ratings remained low throughout the show's run. Loving suffered from a constant revolving door of writers and producers, leading to questionable story moments such as a heroine's addiction to cough syrup and one character's selling his soul to the Devil. Circumstances became so desperate in the early 1990s that, to keep the show afloat, ABC assigned its own programming suits, network executive Haidee Granger and later, Vice President of Daytime Programming JoAnn Emmerich, to serve as executive producers. Despite its frequently subpar ratings, on June 26, 1993, Loving celebrated its 10th Anniversary on ABC.|$|E

40|$|This paper, {{based on}} data from Survey of Family Income and Expenditure of Taiwan, shows that the recent trends of job match in Taiwan labor market have been marked by {{increasing}} proportion of overeducated workers due to the higher education expansion policy, while the incidence of undereducation continues to decline. Furthermore, workers¡¯ economic position is not completely determined by their educational levels. Working experience also {{plays an important role in}} workers¡¯ job placement and their wages. Workers with relatively less working experience are more likely to be overeducated, while workers with relatively more working experience are more likely to be undereducated. Overeducated (Undereducated) workers would earn more (less) than their co-workers with adequate education but less (more) than the workers having the same educational level with adequate education for jobs. However, the rewards (penalties) to adequate education and overeducation (undereducation) decline as more experience accumulated. Evidence also shows effect of <b>bumping</b> <b>down</b> from overeducation on the wages and employment of lower educated workers.

40|$|This paper uses HILDA data {{to examine}} whether {{migration}} reduces local unemployment differentials by helping the unemployed find employment or whether it merely shuffles the unemployed between regions? The paper also considers whether employed residents experience better outcomes in their destination region, or whether labour supply shifts and increased job competition quickly erode the gains to be had? The paper shows that migration per se does little to address unemployment through improved job matching, particularly amongst the severely disadvantaged. Migration also reduced the the outcomes for those previously in employment suggesting some <b>bumping</b> <b>down</b> is occurring in job-rationed labour markets...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the impact}} of the skill composition of migration flows on the host country’s labour market in a specific-factors-two-sector model with heterogeneous labour (low-, medium-, and high-skilled). We assume price-setting behavior in both manufacturing and services sectors. The low- and medium-skilled labour markets are characterized by frictions due to wage bargaining. Moreover, we assume <b>bumping</b> <b>down</b> of unemployed medium-skilled workers into low-skilled service jobs whereas endogenous benefits create an interdependency between the two bargaining processes. Particular attention is paid to medium-skilled migration which enables us to augment the literature by replicating important stylized facts regarding medium skills, such as i) the interaction between immigration, low-skilled unemployment and medium-skilled over-qualification, ii) the polarization effect where both low and high-skilled wages increase relative to the medium-skilled. The model is calibrated using German data. The key findings are: (i) a perfectly balanced migration has a neutral impact on the receiving economy due to international capital flows; (ii) immigration of medium-skilled labour together with some high-skilled labour lowers the low-skilled unemployment rate and has a positive effect on output per capita; (iii) migration of only medium-skilled labour has a neutral GDP per capita effect. ...|$|E
