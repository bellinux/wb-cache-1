25|$|Hopper's seascapes {{fall into}} three main groups: pure landscapes of rocks, sea, and beach grass; lighthouses and farmhouses; and sailboats. Sometimes he {{combined}} these elements.

He painted {{the majority of the}} pure seascapes in the period between 1916 and 1919 on Monhegan Island. Hopper's The Long Leg (1935) is a nearly all-blue sailing picture with the simplest of elements, while his Ground Swell (1939) is more complex and depicts a group of youngsters out for a sail, a theme reminiscent of Winslow Homer's iconic <b>Breezing</b> Up (1876).|$|E

The second round against Tommy Haas, {{who has never}} won a set against Rafael, was tighter, but Nadal again advanced in three straight sets.

By doing so, he has reached the finals of all four majors consecutively. In the final, on 29 January, he was beaten by Novak Djokovic in a five-set match that lasted 5 hours and 53 minutes, the longest ever match for a Grand Slam title.

The team’s only regular–season loss came at Oklahoma, 89–88. UNLV entered the NCAA Tournament as the top seed in the West Region, <b>breezing</b> through the first three rounds. The Rebels received a big scare in the regional final when they were forced to overcome an 18–point deficit against a scrappy Iowa squad. The 84–81 triumph earned UNLV a spot in the Final Four at the Superdome in New Orleans. Banks shined in the semifinal matchup with Indiana, connecting on a tournament–record 10 3–pointers, but it was not enough as the Rebels fell to the eventual champions, 97–93. The loss ended UNLV’s season with a record of 37–2. The squad was inducted into the UNLV Athletic Hall of Fame in 1998.|$|E

[...] Adrien Begrand from PopMatters singled it out as a highlight from {{the second half of}} Body Language, commenting that it [...] "keeps {{the last half of the}} album from being a complete waste of time." [...] Favouring Minogue's vocal performance, Eric Seguy from Stylus Magazine wrote: [...] "Kylie proves herself to be a consummate entertainer, <b>breezing</b> through the chill muzak of [...] "Promises" [...] and [...] "Chocolate"'s wild disco jam with equal ease." [...] Slant Magazine editor Sal Cinquemani likened Minogue's vocals to that of British electronic music duo Mono and felt the tone of the song resembled the [...] "gauzy melancholy" [...] of Madonna's 1994 album Bedtime Stories. A mixed review came from The Guardian critic Helen Pidd, who acknowledged the song's commercial appeal but felt it [...] "sounds too dated to pack any punch in the age of Beyoncé and Missy Elliott." [...] Spin magazine criticised the vocals for being over-processed and the lyrics for lacking substance. The magazine also felt that the theme of the song had already been covered by [...] "minor artists" [...] like American singer–songwriter Mandy Moore.|$|E
500|$|Erika Ramirez of Billboard {{magazine}} {{noted that}} there were two highlights of the night, aside from the choreography and vocal prowess; the dynamic between Beyoncé and her fans and the video montages from her personal life. Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly wrote that Beyoncé was in a [...] "fighting shape, <b>breezing</b> through four nights of wickedly aggressive modern R" [...] and added that the most [...] "attention-grabbing" [...] moments of the night were the covers of other artists that she performed during the concert. Chuck Darrow of the Philadelphia Media Network noted that [...] "Beyonce and her small army of supporting singers, dancers and musicians... conjured an impressive onslaught of sight, sound and motion." [...] He further noted that unlike Lady Gaga and Madonna who used [...] "sartorial extremism" [...] to call attention to themselves, [...] "It is testament to Beyonce's star-power that her stage incandescent presence never allowed the visual pyrotechnics behind her or the hyperkinetic dancers beside her to rise above the peripheral." [...] Praising the feminism showcased during the show, Tris McCall of The Star-Ledger wrote in his review that Beyoncé gave everything she had for the concert pulling them out as vigorously as she could. He further added [...] "The star gave Ovation Hall exactly what it wanted, and left the new theater smoking. The problem for Revel now: following it up." [...] In another review, he described the concert as [...] "spellbinding", wrote that everything onstage was perfectly choreographed, down to the [...] "goofy mid-song mugging" [...] that added so much character to her performances. He concluded that no other pop artist sounds [...] "quite as awake" [...] as Beyoncé does.|$|E
2500|$|A sea <b>breeze</b> or onshore <b>breeze</b> is any {{wind that}} blows {{from a large}} body of water toward or onto a landmass; it {{develops}} due to differences in air pressure created by the differing heat capacities of water and dry land. As such, sea <b>breezes</b> are more localised than prevailing winds. Because land absorbs solar radiation far more quickly than water, a sea <b>breeze</b> is a common occurrence along coasts after sunrise. By contrast, a land <b>breeze</b> or offshore <b>breeze</b> is the reverse effect: dry land also cools more quickly than water and, after sunset, a sea <b>breeze</b> dissipates and the wind instead flows from the land towards the sea. Sea <b>breezes</b> and land <b>breezes</b> are both important factors in coastal regions' prevailing winds. The term offshore wind may refer to any wind over open water.|$|R
