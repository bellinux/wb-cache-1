5|$|Greece and the Republic of Macedonia each {{consider}} this name a compromise: it is opposed by some Greeks for containing the Greek self-identifying name Macedonia, and <b>by</b> <b>many</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Republic of Macedonia {{for not being}} the short self-identifying name.

5|$|By {{the end of}} January, Pole {{had dropped}} to twenty-one votes, but the French faction {{remained}} split between Carafa, de Bourbon, Lorraine, and Salviati; Este's candidacy, though desired <b>by</b> <b>many</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> French College, {{had not yet been}} put forward, perhaps having been held back in hopes that he would be more acceptable as the conclave dragged on. Toward the end of January, in accordance with traditional efforts to counter dillatory cardinals, the amenities and rations of the conclave were decreased and the upper story windows were closed to reduce the natural lighting and fresh air. Soon afterwards, Ridolfithe French candidate most acceptable to Farnesedied amid accusations of poisoning on January 31.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge fled behind Confederate lines. He was {{commissioned}} a brigadier general and then {{expelled from the}} Senate. Following the Battle of Shiloh in 1862, {{he was promoted to}} major general, and in October he was assigned to the Army of Mississippi under Braxton Bragg. After Bragg charged that Breckinridge's drunkenness had contributed to defeats at Stone River and Missionary Ridge, and after Breckinridge joined many other high-ranking officers in criticizing Bragg, he was transferred to the Trans-Allegheny Department, where he won his most significant victory in the 1864 Battle of New Market. After participating in Jubal Early's campaigns in the Shenandoah Valley, Breckinridge was charged with defending supplies in Tennessee and Virginia. In February 1865, Confederate President Jefferson Davis appointed him Secretary of War. Concluding that the war was hopeless, he urged Davis to arrange a national surrender. After the fall of Richmond, Breckinridge ensured the preservation of Confederate records. He then escaped the country and lived abroad for more than three years. When President Andrew Johnson extended amnesty to all former Confederates in 1868, Breckinridge returned to Kentucky, but resisted all encouragement to resume his political career. War injuries sapped his health, and he died in 1875. Breckinridge is regarded as an effective military commander. Though well-liked in Kentucky, he was reviled <b>by</b> <b>many</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> North as a traitor.|$|E

5|$|Due {{to another}} lockout, the 2012–13 season was delayed until January 2013. The Sedins this time {{remained}} in Canada, as {{they decided that}} would return to Modo only if the entire season again wound up cancelled. In the second month of the season, Henrik recorded his 757th point, surpassing Markus Näslund as the Canucks' all-time leading scorer. Two months later, Daniel also passed Näslund, scoring a goal and an assist in a 3–1 win against the Chicago Blackhawks, ranking the Sedins first and second in team history. Playing in just 47 games due to the lockout-shortened season, Daniel recorded 12 goals and 40 points. He ranked second in team scoring behind Henrik's 45 points. In the playoffs, he added three assists in a four-game defeat to the San Jose Sharks. The series ended on a shorthanded goal due to a penalty assessed to Daniel in overtime. In pursuit of a loose puck in the defensive zone, Daniel bodychecked Sharks forward Tommy Wingels into the boards, resulting in a boarding penalty. The call would later {{be the subject of}} controversy as it was believed <b>by</b> <b>many</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> media, such as National Post journalist Cam Cole, as well as teammates, such as Henrik, that Daniel had made contact with Wingels shoulder-to-shoulder, which according to NHL rules, should not result in a boarding penalty.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, Wilkinson {{served in}} Churchill's wartime {{coalition}} {{as a junior}} minister, mainly at the Ministry of Home Security where she worked under Herbert Morrison. She supported Morrison's attempts to replace Clement Attlee as the Labour Party's leader; nevertheless, when he formed his postwar government, Attlee appointed Wilkinson as Minister of Education. By this time, her health was poor, a legacy of years of overwork. She saw her main task in office as {{the implementation of the}} wartime coalition's 1944 Education Act, rather than the more radical introduction of comprehensive schools favoured <b>by</b> <b>many</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Labour Party. Much of her energy was applied to organising the raising of the school-leaving age from 14 to 15. During the exceptionally cold weather of early 1947, she succumbed to a bronchial disease, and died after an overdose of medication, which the coroner at her inquest declared was accidental.|$|E

25|$|Van Til {{was also}} a strident {{opponent}} of the theology of Karl Barth, and his opposition led to the rejection of Barth's theology <b>by</b> <b>many</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Reformed community. Despite Barth's assertions that he sought to base his theology solely on the 'Word of God', Van Til believed that Barth's thought was syncretic in nature and fundamentally flawed because, according to Van Til, it assumed a Kantian epistemology, which Van Til argued was necessarily irrational and anti-Biblical. Nonetheless, Al Wolters has demonstrated that Dooyeweerd's philosophy draws deeply from the wells of Neo-Kantianism, phenomenology, and existentialism, rendering suspect the impression that Van TIl and Dooyeweerd have sought to convey regarding the biblical and Christian purity of their philosophical systems.|$|E
