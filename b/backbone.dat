5|$|Because protein {{structures}} {{are composed of}} amino acids whose side chains are linked by a common protein <b>backbone,</b> {{a number of different}} possible subsets of the atoms that make up a protein macromolecule can be used in producing a structural alignment and calculating the corresponding RMSD values. When aligning structures with very different sequences, the side chain atoms generally are not taken into account because their identities differ between many aligned residues. For this reason it is common for structural alignment methods to use by default only the <b>backbone</b> atoms included in the peptide bond. For simplicity and efficiency, often only the alpha carbon positions are considered, since the peptide bond has a minimally variant planar conformation. Only when the structures to be aligned are highly similar or even identical is it meaningful to align side-chain atom positions, in which case the RMSD reflects not only the conformation of the protein <b>backbone</b> but also the rotameric states of the side chains. Other comparison criteria that reduce noise and bolster positive matches include secondary structure assignment, native contact maps or residue interaction patterns, measures of side chain packing, and measures of hydrogen bond retention.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Backbones</b> of propositional {{theories}} are literals that are true in every model. <b>Backbones</b> {{have been used}} for characterizing the hardness of decision and optimization problems. Moreover, back-bones find other applications. For example, <b>backbones</b> are often iden-tified during product configuration. <b>Backbones</b> can also improve the efficiency of solving computational problems related with proposi-tional theories. These include model enumeration, minimal model computation and prime implicant computation. This paper investi-gates algorithms for computing <b>backbones</b> of propositional theories, emphasizing the integration of these algorithms with modern SAT solvers. Experimental results, obtained on representative problem in-stances, indicate that the proposed algorithms are effective in practice and can be used for computing the <b>backbones</b> of large propositional theories. In addition, the experimental results indicate that proposi-tional theories can have large <b>backbones,</b> often representing a signif-icant percentage {{of the total number of}} variables. ...|$|R

5|$|Saccharolipids {{describe}} {{compounds in}} which fatty acids are linked {{directly to a}} sugar <b>backbone,</b> forming structures that are compatible with membrane bilayers. In the saccharolipids, a monosaccharide substitutes for the glycerol <b>backbone</b> present in glycerolipids and glycerophospholipids. The most familiar saccharolipids are the acylated glucosamine precursors of the LipidA component of the lipopolysaccharides in Gram-negative bacteria. Typical lipidA molecules are disaccharides of glucosamine, which are derivatized {{with as many as}} seven fatty-acyl chains. The minimal lipopolysaccharide required for growth in E. coli is Kdo2-Lipid A, a hexa-acylated disaccharide of glucosamine that is glycosylated with two 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid (Kdo) residues.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we explore}} the feature of sharing partial results of {{multiple}} queries {{to reduce the}} total number of messages incurred. Those queries sharing their partial results are referred to as <b>backbones.</b> Given a set of queries, we shall determine <b>backbones</b> with the purpose of minimizing {{the total number of}} messages. Specifically, given a set of queries, we derive a graph, where each vertex represents one query and the corresponding weight edge denotes the number of messages reduced by sharing partial results. Then, we develop a heuristic algorithm SB (standing for Selecting <b>Backbones)</b> to derive a cut in which both <b>backbones</b> and non-backbones are determined. Simulation results show that by sharing partial results, algorithm SB is able to significantly reduce the total number of messages involved. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{stereochemistry}} of the archaeal glycerol moiety is {{the mirror}} image of that found in other organisms. The glycerol moiety can occur in two forms that are mirror images of one another, called enantiomers. Just as a right hand does not fit easily into a left-handed glove, enantiomers of one type generally cannot be used or made by enzymes adapted for the other. The archaeal phospholipids are built on a <b>backbone</b> of sn-glycerol-1-phosphate, which is an enantiomer of sn-glycerol-3-phosphate, the phospholipid <b>backbone</b> found in bacteria and eucaryotes. This suggests that archaea use entirely different enzymes for synthesizing phospholipids than do bacteria and eukaryotes. Such enzymes developed very early in life's history, indicating an early split from the other two domains.|$|E

40|$|The {{evolution}} of many kinetic processes in 1 + 1 (space-time) dimensions results in 2 d directed percolative landscapes. The active phases {{of these models}} possess numerous hidden geometric orders characterized by various types of large-scale and/or coarse-grained percolative <b>backbones</b> that we define. For the patterns originated in the classical directed percolation (DP) and contact process (CP) we show from the Monte-Carlo simulation data that these percolative <b>backbones</b> emerge at specific critical points {{as a result of}} continuous phase transitions. These geometric transitions belong to the DP universality class and their nonlocal order parameters are the capacities of corresponding <b>backbones.</b> The multitude of conceivable percolative <b>backbones</b> implies the existence of infinite cascades of such geometric transitions in the kinetic processes considered. We present simple arguments to support the conjecture that such cascades of transitions is a generic feature of percolation as well as many others transitions with nonlocal order parameters.

5|$|Temnospondyls' {{vertebrae}} {{are divided}} into several segments. In living tetrapods, {{the main body of}} the vertebra is a single piece of bone called the centrum, but in temnospondyls, this region was divided into a pleurocentrum and intercentrum. Two types of vertebrae are recognized in temnospondyls: stereospondylous and rhachitomous vertebrae.'In rhachitomous vertebrae, the intercentra are large and wedge-shaped, and the pleurocentra are relatively small blocks that fit between them.' Both elements support a spine-like neural arch, and well-developed interlocking projections called zygapophyses strengthen the connections between vertebrae. The strong <b>backbone</b> and strong limbs of many ratchitomous temnospondyls allowed them to be partially, and in some cases fully, terrestrial. In stereospondylous vertebrae, the pleurocentra have been lost entirely, with the intercentra enlarged as {{the main body of the}} vertebrae. This weaker type of <b>backbone</b> indicates that stereospondylous temnospondyls spent more time in water.|$|E
