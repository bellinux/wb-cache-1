5|$|The Harrier was {{typically}} {{used as a}} ground attack aircraft, though its manoeuvrability also allows it to effectively engage other aircraft at short ranges. The Harrier {{is powered by a}} single Pegasus turbofan engine mounted in the fuselage.

Several small reaction nozzles are also fitted, in the nose, tail and wingtips, for the purpose of balancing during vertical flight. It has two landing gear units on the fuselage and two outrigger landing gear units, one near each wing tip.

It makes the aerosol flow which has different particle size characteristics can be generated by aerosol generator and be installed several <b>bypass</b> <b>flows</b> according {{to the principle of}} aerosol generator. By the way, the particle size distribution and particle size characteristics of aerosol flow can be obtained after measuring the quality of aerosol flow which is collected under different <b>bypass</b> <b>flows</b> by Berner Impactor. So the different type of test smoke for fire smoke detectors can be obtained by aerosol generator. And then, the distribution characteristics of aerosol flow can be obtained in testing tubes (EN 54 - 5 / 7 c) of fire smoke detectors. Finally, the improved test environment of fire smoke detectors has realized the diversification of test environment. And the reliability of the test results has improved through this study...|$|R

50|$|Turboramjet engines may be {{classified}} {{according to the}} manner of energy transfer to the ramjet parts and whether they have a separate combustor. In the Griffon 02 power plant the turbojet was separate from the ram duct, which had its own combustor, {{and there was no}} energy transfer.

50|$|Because {{of these}} distinctions, {{turbofan}} engine designs are often categorized as low-bypass or high-bypass, {{depending upon the}} amount of air which bypasses {{the core of the}} engine. Low-bypass turbofans have a bypass ratio of around 2:1 or less, meaning that for each kilogram of air that passes through the core of the engine, two kilograms or less of air bypass the core. Low-bypass turbofans often use a mixed exhaust nozzle meaning that the <b>bypassed</b> <b>flow</b> and the core flow exit from the same nozzle. High-bypass turbofans often have ratios from 4:1 up to 8:1, with the Rolls-Royce Trent XWB approaching 10:1.|$|R
5000|$|Thus civil turbofans {{today have}} a low exhaust speed (low {{specific}} thrust [...] - [...] net thrust divided by airflow) to keep jet noise to a minimum and to improve fuel efficiency. Consequently, the bypass ratio (<b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> divided by core flow) is relatively high (ratios from 4:1 up to 8:1 are common), with the Rolls-Royce Trent XWB approaching 10:1. Only a single fan stage is required, because a low specific thrust implies a low fan pressure ratio.|$|E
50|$|The MIR VHTR <b>Bypass</b> <b>Flow</b> Experiment will measure flow {{characteristics}} in the coolant channels and interstitial gaps between typical prismatic block standard fuel elements or upper reflector blocks.

The {{benefit of the}} MIR technique is that it permits optical measurements to determine {{flow characteristics}} in passages and around objects to be obtained without locating a disturbing transducer in the flow field and without distortion of the optical paths. Unheated MIR experiments are first steps when the geometry is complicated.|$|E
50|$|To {{illustrate}} {{one aspect}} of how a turbofan differs from a turbojet they may be compared, as in a re-engining assessment, at the same airflow (to keep a common intake for example) and the same net thrust (i.e. same specific thrust). A <b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> can be added only if the turbine inlet temperature is not too high {{to compensate for the}} smaller core flow. Future improvements in turbine cooling/material technology can allow higher turbine inlet temperature, which is necessary because of increased cooling air temperature, resulting from any overall pressure ratio increase.|$|E
40|$|Refinements are {{described}} to an existing fluidic {{temperature control system}} developed under a prior study which modulated temperature at the inlet to the liquid-cooled garment by using existing liquid supply and return lines to transmit signals to a fluidic controller located in the spacecraft. This earlier system produced a limited range of garment inlet temperatures, requiring some <b>bypassing</b> of <b>flow</b> around the suit to make the astronaut comfortable at rest conditions. Refinements {{were based on a}} flow visualization study of the key element in the fluidic controller: the fluidic mixing valve. The valve's mixing-ratio range was achieved by making five key changes: (1) geometrical changes to the valve; (2) attenuation of noise generated in proportional amplifier cascades; (3) elimination of vortices at the exit of the fluidic mixing valve; (4) reduction of internal heat transfer; and (5) flow balancing through venting. As a result, the refined system is capable of modulating garment inlet temperature from 45 F to 70 F with a single manual control valve in series with the garment.

40|$|Objectives : The {{aim of this}} {{retrospective}} study was to evaluate the prognostic value of corrected thrombolysis in myocardial infarction frame count (cTFC) measurements and different cutoff values {{of the degree of}} proximal coronary artery stenosis in a series of patients who had undergone elective isolated coronary artery bypass surgery. Methods : A retrospective analysis of 98 patients who had elective isolated coronary artery bypass surgery performed at our institution between January 2008 and March 2009 was made. Preoperatively, all patients had undergone angiography. The degree of epicardial coronary stenosis was estimated visually by the cardiologist, and cTFC of the target coronary arteries was obtained from standard projections on preoperative coronary angiograms with frame rate of 12. 5 frames/s. All bypass grafts were evaluated by intraoperative transit time flow measurement (TTFM). Results : All bypass grafts were divided according to the results into four nearly equally sized groups using cTFC and percentage of proximal coronary artery stenosis. The cut-off values for both cTFC and percentage of stenosis were their median values (cTFCâ 14, percentage of stenosisâ 80 %). Bypass grafts in the four groups showed significant differences in mean flow. In group 1 (high percent stenosis and high cTFC) mean <b>bypass</b> graft <b>flow</b> was 38. 3 Â± 20. 3 ml/min, in group 2 (low percent stenosis and high cTFC) mean <b>bypass</b> graft <b>flow</b> was 29. 0 Â± 15. 1 ml/min, in group 3 (high percent stenosis and low cTFC) mean <b>bypass</b> graft <b>flow</b> was 48. 2 Â± 26. 3 ml/min, and in group 4 (low percent stenosis and low cTFC) mean <b>bypass</b> graft <b>flow</b> was 35. 3 Â± 14. 8 ml/min. Differences between individual groups were significant for all combinations except when comparing group 1 with group 4. Conclusion : Combining the data obtained from coronary angiography and TFC has shown to have a good predictive value for postoperative coronary <b>bypass</b> graft <b>flow,</b> and could thus help surgeons in making choice of target vessels for bypass surgery or help them decide whather revision of a bypass graft would be beneficial. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectives: In animals the Cardeon Cobra {{catheter}} (Cardeon Corp, Cupertino, Calif) allows {{independent control}} of aortic arch and descending aortic temperatures and profoundly reduces cerebral embolization during bypass. This investigation describes the first clinical {{use of the}} device during adult cardiac surgery. The {{purpose of the study}} was to confirm that the Cobra catheter delivers adequate cerebral and systemic perfusion while providing simultaneous cerebral hypothermia and systemic normothermia during cardiopulmonary bypass. Methods: In a prospective multicenter study the Cobra aortic catheter was placed in 20 adults undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass. Arch and corporeal temperatures, <b>bypass</b> <b>flows,</b> and arterial blood pressures were recorded intraoperatively. Jugular bulb and mixed venous oxygen saturation was used to assess the adequacy of cerebral and systemic perfusion. Results: Surgeons at 3 institutions placed the Cobra catheter in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (n = 13), valve (n = 3), and combined valve-bypass (n = 4) operations. Mean total <b>bypass</b> <b>flows</b> of 2. 1 Â± 0. 2 L Â· minâ 1 Â· â 2 maintained mean arterial pressures in arch and descending aortic circulations of greater than 55 mm Hg. A mean differential of 4. 3 Â°C between arch and descending aortic temperatures was established before crossclamp application, and a mean maximum temperature differential of 7 Â°C was established during bypass. A 2. 4 Â°C temperature differential was maintained at crossclamp removal. Cerebral and systemic venous oxygen saturation remained greater than 65 % during bypass. Conclusions: The Cobra device met all expectations for an arterial cannula with adequate perfusion to the arch and corporeal circulations. Dual perfusion with the Cobra catheter allows for independent temperature control during cardiopulmonary bypass with simultaneous cerebral hypothermia and systemic normothermia.

50|$|The mainstem of San Gregorio Creek, in {{combination}} with its tributaries of La Honda, Alpine, Harrington, El Corte de Madera and Bogess Creeks, contains approximately 33 mi of historical coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) rearing habitat. In the 1800s the creek had large enough salmon runs to support commercial harvest (Skinner, 1962). As part of the southern range of the Central California Coast Coho Evolutionarily Significant Unit (ESU), the creek is considered an attractive site for re-stocking. In fact, in 1998 the Draft Strategic Plan for Restoration of Endangered Coho Salmon South of San Francisco Bay identified San Gregorio Creek and its tributaries as one of nine creeks in which recovery of coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) is a priority. South of San Francisco to Monterey Bay the coho salmon was listed by the State of California as endangered in 1995. The San Gregorio watershed has seen recently increasing residential development but remains primarily pastoral with cattle and sheep grazing, timber harvesting, and recreational trails being the main commercial uses. Because of the large private ownership and development potential, water diversions and low base flows are an important issue in this watershed. In 1993, water rights in the San Gregorio watershed were adjudicated and a minimum stream <b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> was established. However, the prescribed bypass flows are too low to assure viable coho salmon populations.|$|E
50|$|One SST VCE {{concept is}} the Tandem Fan engine. The engine has two fans, both {{mounted on the}} {{low-pressure}} shaft, with a significant axial gap between the units. In normal flight, the engine is in the series mode, with the flow leaving the front fan passing directly into the second fan, the engine behaving much like a normal turbofan. However, for take-off, climb-out, final-descent and approach, the front fan is allowed to discharge directly through an auxiliary nozzle {{on the underside of}} the powerplant nacelle. Auxiliary intakes are opened on each side of the powerplant, allowing air to enter the rear fan and progress through the rest of the engine. Operating the fans in this parallel mode substantially increases the total airflow of the engine at a thrust, resulting in a lower jet velocity and a quieter engine. Back in the 1970s, Boeing modified a Pratt & Whitney JT8D to a Tandem Fan configuration and successfully demonstrated the switch from series to parallel operation (and vice versa) with the engine running, albeit at part power. In the Mid Tandem Fan concept, a high specific flow single stage fan is located between the high pressure (HP) and low pressure (LP) compressors of a turbojet core. Only bypass air is allowed to pass through the fan, the LP compressor exit flow passing through special passages within the fan disc, directly underneath the fan rotor blades. Some of the bypass air enters the engine via an auxiliary intake. During take-off and approach the engine behaves much like a normal civil turbofan, with an acceptable jet noise level (i.e., low specific thrust). However, for supersonic cruise, the fan variable inlet guide vanes and auxiliary intake close-off to minimize <b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> and increase specific thrust. In this mode the engine acts more like a 'leaky' turbojet (e.g. the F404).|$|E

In this study, we report our test of the hypothesis that an apoplastic pathway (the so-called <b>bypass</b> <b>flow)</b> causes a difference in salt resistance between rice genotypes {{and can be used}} in screening for salinity resistance. Fourteen-day-old seedlings of low- and high-Na+-transporting recombinant inbred lines (10 of each) of rice IR 55178 were treated with 50 mm NaCl and 0. 2 mm trisodium- 8 -hydroxy- 1, 3, 6 -pyrenetrisulphonic acid (PTS), a <b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> tracer, for short (4 d) and long (90 d) periods of time.
