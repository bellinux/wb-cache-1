5|$|Two {{different}} {{measures are}} used for storm tide and storm surge measurements. Storm tide is measured using a geodetic vertical datum (NGVD 29 or NAVD 88). Since storm surge {{is defined as the}} rise of water beyond what would be expected by the normal movement caused by tides, storm surge is measured using tidal predictions, with the assumption that the tide prediction is well-known and only slowly varying in the region subject to the surge. Since tides are a localized phenomenon, storm surge can only be measured in relationship to a nearby tidal station. Tidal <b>bench</b> <b>mark</b> information at a station provides a translation from the geodetic vertical datum to mean sea level (MSL) at that location, then subtracting the tidal prediction yields a surge height above the normal water height.|$|E

With 59 seconds left, Gannon threw an interception to the Dolphins' Troy Vincent to seal the Dolphins' 17-10 victory. Gannon injured his foot during the game.

Land subsidence occurs in Semarang is a complex problem because the rate of land subsidence is different in places {{and changes in the}} development of time. Therefore it is necessary to monitor the land subsidence rate in Semarang. The aim of this research are to check the newest elevation of <b>Bench</b> <b>Marks</b> in coastal area of Semarang, to monitor land subsidence rate in coastal area of Semarang, To make elevation and land subsidence contour map in coastal area of Semarang. The result of this research shows that <b>bench</b> <b>marks</b> which are above MSL + 100 m in height are stable enough. The closer to the sea, the faster land subsidence occurs.
