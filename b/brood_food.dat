30|$|Bi-parental care {{occurs in}} most monogamous bird species with altricial or semi-precocial young (Lack 1968; Clutton-Brock 1991; Székely et al. 2007). Such birds exhibit {{more or less}} divided parental duties during nesting; on the one hand, there are species in which {{both males and females}} {{cooperate}} in incubation, <b>brooding,</b> <b>food</b> provisioning, or nest defense (e.g., waders, gulls, auks, pigeons, and passerines), and on the other hand, there are species in which males and females have strictly divided parental task; females usually incubate and brood, while males provide most food for the young and female (e.g., most diurnal raptors and owls).|$|R
50|$|The {{amount of}} food a clutch will get depends {{on the size of}} the clutch, with larger {{clutches}} getting more food on average.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the ideal brood area to be introduced for strengthening Apis mellifera colonies, considering variations in the hive's internal ambience. Therefore, eight colonies were equipped with data loggers for recording variations in temperature and humidity inside the hives. Then, these colonies were split in four treatments involving the swapping of four, three, two and one brood comb between strong and weak colonies. Growth {{in the amount of}} <b>brood</b> and <b>food</b> stores to the four colony strengthening treatments was assessed counting the comb cells to record changes in the <b>brood</b> and <b>food</b> area. The colonies tended to restore their normal thermoregulation within four hours after they had been manipulated and the hive cover had been closed, which quickly increased brood area in the receiving colonies. Results showed that adding up to three brood combs constitute an important alternative for strengthening Apis mellifera colonies because it did not interfere with nest thermoregulation, speeded up population growth in weak colonies and did not affect the development of strong colonies...|$|R
50|$|The {{development}} of worker bees in a colony {{is typical of}} that for any insect that undergoes complete metamorphosis as it includes the four stages of egg, larva, pupa, and adult. The embryo grows inside the egg for 3 days, consuming the protein-rich egg yolk. Then it undergoes an 8-day larval stage, which is an intense feeding state involving honey, pollen, and <b>brood</b> <b>food</b> supplied by the adult bees. Finally, there is construction of a wax pupa which then matures and gnaws through the wax cap of the cell to emerge as a young bee.|$|E
50|$|When {{cleaning}} infected cells, bees distribute spores {{throughout the}} entire colony. Disease spreads rapidly throughout the hive as the bees, attempting to remove the spore-laden dead larvae, contaminate <b>brood</b> <b>food.</b> Nectar stored in contaminated cells will contain spores and soon the brood chamber becomes filled with contaminated honey. As this honey is moved up into the supers, the entire hive becomes contaminated with spores. When the colony becomes weak from AFB infection, robber bees may enter and take contaminated honey back to their hives thereby spreading the disease to other colonies and apiaries. Beekeepers also may spread disease by moving equipment (frames or supers) from contaminated hives to healthy ones.|$|E

Two research teams led by Jeff Pettis at the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Cedric Alaux at INRA/France have demonstrated that interactions between the pathogen Nosema and imidacloprid significantly weaken the immune systems of honeybees (Apis mellifera). In their research, Alaux et al. (2010) found that bees infected with Nosema and exposed to 0.7 ug/kg imidacloprid had an increased rate of mortality compared to the controls. The combination of Nosema and imidacloprid also significantly decreased the activity of glucose oxidase, an important enzyme that allows the bees to sterilize their colony and <b>brood</b> <b>food.</b> Without this enzyme, bees can become more susceptible to infections by pathogens.

40|$|In biparental {{bird species}} the optimal level of parental care of {{one member of}} the pair gen-erally depends on its mate’s strategy. In monogamy, a {{predicted}} response to reduced pa-rental care by one parent is incomplete compensation by its partner. The importance of male parental care has been suggested to vary also according to environmental conditions during breeding. From our previous studies, double-brooded male Eurasian Treecreepers (Certhia familiaris) were found to desert their nests more often during second <b>broods,</b> when <b>food</b> conditions were generally good. Here, we studied the importance of male pa-rental care in this species, by testing the effects of male removal on the parental behavior and reproductive success during the first <b>broods,</b> when <b>food</b> is scarcer. The aim was to de-termine the degree to which female parents could increase their workload to compensate for the male absence. We did this by measuring feeding rate, and the size and composition of food loads of widowed and paired females. Food abundance was measured within Treecreeper territories, immediately after fledging, as a measure of territory quality rela-tive to the breeding success of both paired and widowed females. Our results showed that widowed females increased their feeding rate enough to compensate for the loss of their mate. However, widowed females produced fewer young, which were also of lower nest-ling weight, than control pairs. The success of the second brood, in the same breeding sea-son, was also lower among widowed females with new males than among the control fe-males, despite all experimental females having the opportunity to re-nest. 1...|$|R
30|$|Four female Boreal Owls in our study, however, {{decreased}} brooding {{and increased}} foraging {{in response to}} the absence or low feeding rates of males during the early brooding phase (i.e., {{at a time when the}} young needed both <b>brooding</b> and <b>food</b> provisioning). These females left their nest for as long as several hours per night, and sometimes came back to the nest with food. Therefore, it is likely that these females attempted to hunt to compensate for the insufficient feeding rates of their mates. However, these females stopped providing at an early stage of the brooding period when the oldest young averaged 11.8 days of age, and thus nesting attempts failed (i.e., our second prediction).|$|R
50|$|Honey bees obtain all {{of their}} {{nutritional}} requirements from a diverse combination of pollen and nectar. Pollen is the only natural protein source for honey bees. Adult worker honey bees consume 3.4-4.3 mg of pollen per day to meet a dry matter requirement of 66-74% protein. The rearing of one larva requires 125-187.5 mg pollen or 25-37.5 mg protein for proper development. Dietary proteins are broken down into amino acids, ten of which are considered essential to honey bees: methionine, tryptophan, arginine, lysine, histidine, phenylalanine, isoleucine, threonine, leucine, and valine. Of these amino acids, honey bees require highest concentrations of leucine, isoleucine, and valine, however elevated concentrations of arginine and lysine are required for brood rearing. In addition to these amino acids, some B vitamins including biotin, folic acid, nicotinamide, riboflavin, thiamine, pantothenate, and most importantly, pyridoxine are required to rear larvae. Pyridoxine is the most prevalent B vitamin found in royal jelly and concentrations vary throughout the foraging season with lowest concentrations found in May and highest concentrations found in July and August. Honey bees lacking dietary pyridoxine were unable to rear brood.Pollen is also a lipid source for honey bees ranging from 0.8% to 18.9%. Lipids are metabolized during the brood stage for precursors required for future biosynthesis. Fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K are not considered essential but have shown to significantly improve the number of brood reared. Honey bees ingest phytosterols from pollen to produce 24-methylenecholesterol and other sterols as they cannot directly synthesize cholesterol from phytosterols.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{three factors}} that may influence the change in protein content {{and size of the}} <b>brood</b> <b>food</b> glands in honey bees. Effects on the mandibular gland, involved in the production of <b>brood</b> <b>food</b> and in royal jelly, have not been examined in relation to primer pheromones while effects on the hypopharyngeal glands, also involved in the production of <b>brood</b> <b>food,</b> have not been examined in relation to queen mandibular pheromone. This thesis provides preliminary insight into how these pheromones affect the extractable protein content of <b>brood</b> <b>food</b> glands. The first study in this thesis assessed the effects of brood pheromone (BP), queen mandibular pheromone (QMP), and pollen presence on the protein content of hypopharyngeal and mandibular glands of the honey bee. In this study, newly emerged bees were caged for 12 days in one of eight treatments: Queenless state: 1) control (no pollen + no pheromone), 2) pollen, 3) BP, 4) BP + pollen; Queenright state: 1) QMP, 2) QMP + pollen, 3) BP + QMP, 4) BP + QMP + pollen. This study indicated that regardless of pheromone treatment, the most influential factor on gland protein content and size was pollen. The second experiment examined effects of varying pollen dilution on hypopharyngeal and mandibular gland protein content, bee mass, and lipid content of the honey bee. In this experiment, newly emerged bees were caged for 7 days and fed one of five treatments: pollen, 1 : 1 pollen: cellulose (vol:vol), 1 : 2 pollen: cellulose (vol:vol); 1 : 3 pollen: cellulose (vol:vol), and cellulose. This study indicated that bees on the pollen diet were significantly greater than all other diluted diets in measurements of hypopharyngeal gland protein content, lipid content, and mass with significantly less consumption. However, mandibular gland protein content of bees on the pollen diet was significantly greater only from pure cellulose...|$|E
40|$|The {{worldwide}} use of neonicotinoid pesticides {{has caused}} concern {{on account of}} their involvement in the decline of bee populations, which are key pollinators in most ecosystems. Here we describe a role of non-neuronal acetylcholine (ACh) for breeding of Apis mellifera carnica and a so far unknown effect of neonicotinoids on non-target insects. Royal jelly or larval food are produced by the hypopharyngeal gland of nursing bees and contain unusually high ACh concentrations (4 - 8 mM). ACh is extremely well conserved in royal jelly or <b>brood</b> <b>food</b> because of the acidic pH of 4. 0. This condition protects ACh from degradation thus ensuring delivery of intact ACh to larvae. Raising the pH to ≥ 5. 5 and applying cholinesterase reduced the content of ACh substantially (by 75 - 90 %) in larval food. When this manipulated brood was tested in artificial larval breeding experiments, the survival rate was higher with food supplemented by 100 % with ACh (6 mM) than with food not supplemented with ACh. ACh release from the hypopharyngeal gland and its content in <b>brood</b> <b>food</b> declined by 80 %, when honeybee colonies were exposed for 4 weeks to high concentrations of the neonicotinoids clothianidin (100 parts per billion [ppb]) or thiacloprid (8, 800 ppb). Under these conditions the secretory cells of the gland were markedly damaged and brood development was severely compromised. Even field-relevant low concentrations of thiacloprid (200 ppb) or clothianidin (1 and 10 ppb) reduced ACh level in the <b>brood</b> <b>food</b> and showed initial adverse effects on brood development. Our findings indicate a hitherto unknown target of neonicotinoids to induce adverse effects on non-neuronal ACh which should be considered when re-assessing the environmental risks of these compounds. To our knowledge {{this is a new}} biological mechanism, and we suggest that, in addition to their well documented neurotoxic effects, neonicotinoids may contribute to honeybee colony losses consecutive to a reduction of the ACh content in the <b>brood</b> <b>food...</b>|$|E

50|$|The main {{difference}} found between African and European honey bees {{were a few}} behavioral traits in the worker bees that were all related to the workers’ food preference.

The {{breeding}} densities of both species were {{limited by the}} availability of nest sites. The larger great tits were dominant in obtaining nest boxes. This was most important where breeding sites were scarce. The two species did not maintain interspecific territories or interfere with interspecific nest site spacing beyond the immediate vicinity of the nest. Blue and great tit numbers fluctuated in parallel where nest sites were not limiting resources. Annual changes in breeding numbers of great tits were negatively related to blue tit breeding density but great tit density {{did not seem to}} affect changes in the blue tit population. Overlap in the feeding sites of blue and great tits was greatest during the summer and interference competition was lowest at this time. The nestling diets of the two species were very similar. Despite an apparent abundance of food for nestlings, adults were pressed to feed large <b>broods.</b> <b>Food</b> for nestlings was probably a limiting and depletable resource. The date of clutch initiation of great tits, but not blue tits, was retarded at high densities of blue or great tits. The clutch sizes of both species were probably negatively affected by high breeding densities of congeners but the results were not clear cut. Heavy great tit fledglings are most likely to survive to breed. Great tit fledglings were heavier at low densities of blue tits. An experiment in which blue tit young were removed from a section of the Woods, showed that great tit nestlings were heavier and developed faster, and that female condition was better, than in a control section or section where blue tit broods were supplemented.

40|$|The {{maintenance}} {{of the immune system}} can be costly, and a lack of dietary protein can increase the susceptibility of organisms to disease. However, few studies have investigated the relationship between protein nutrition and immunity in insects. Here, we tested in honeybees (Apis mellifera) whether dietary protein quantity (monofloral pollen) and diet diversity (polyfloral pollen) can shape baseline immunocompetence (IC) by measuring parameters of individual immunity (haemocyte concentration, fat body content and phenoloxidase activity) and glucose oxidase (GOX) activity, which enables bees to sterilize colony and <b>brood</b> <b>food,</b> as a parameter of social immunity. Protein feeding modified both individual and social IC but increases in dietary protein quantity did not enhance IC. However, diet diversity increased IC levels. In particular, polyfloral diets induced higher GOX activity compared with monofloral diets, including protein-richer diets.

Larvae infected by a high dose of Nosema ceranae spores developed into adults with 2 fold higher Vg titers. However, they also had 1. 3 fold lower total hemolymph protein titers.

40|$|Many complex {{factors have}} been linked to the recent marked {{increase}} in honey bee colony failure, including pests and pathogens, agrochemicals, and nutritional stressors. It remains unclear, however, why colonies frequently react to stressors by losing almost their entire adult bee population in a short time, resulting in a colony population collapse. Here we examine the social dynamics underlying such dramatic colony failure. Bees respond to many stressors by foraging earlier in life. We manipulated the demography of experimental colonies to induce precocious foraging in bees and used radio tag tracking to examine the consequences of precocious foraging for their performance. Precocious foragers completed far fewer foraging trips in their life, and had a higher risk of death in their first flights. We constructed a demographic model to explore how this individual reaction of bees to stress might impact colony performance. In the model, when forager death rates were chronically elevated, an increasingly younger forager force caused a positive feedback that dramatically accelerated terminal population decline in the colony. This resulted in a breakdown in division of labor and loss of the adult population, leaving only <b>brood,</b> <b>food,</b> and few adults in the hive. This study explains the social processes that drive rapid depopulation of a colony, and we explore possible strategies to prevent colony failure. Understanding the process of colony failure helps identify the most effective strategies to improve colony resilience. 6 page(s...|$|E
25|$|Experiments {{have shown}} that {{asynchronous}} hatching may also reduce sibling rivalry. Experimentally manipulated synchronous broods produced more aggressive chicks; chicks in asynchronous broods were less violent. This pattern of behavior arguably occurs through a clearly established brood hierarchy in asynchronously hatched siblings. Although asynchronous hatching is not vital {{for the formation of}} brood hierarchies (the experimentally synchronous broods established them as well), it does aid in efficient <b>brood</b> reduction when <b>food</b> levels are low. Subordinate chicks in asynchronous broods die more quickly, thus relieving the parents of the burden of feeding both offspring when resources are insufficient to properly do so.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Both {{climatic factors}} and bee forage {{characteristics}} affect the population size and productivity of honey bee colonies. To our knowledge, no scientific investigation has as yet considered the potential effect of nectar-rich bee forage exposed to drastic subtropical weather {{conditions on the}} performance of honey bee colonies. This study investigated the performance of the honey bee subspecies Apis mellifera jemenitica Ruttner (Yemeni) and Apis mellifera carnica Pollmann (Carniolan) in weather that was hot and dry and in an environment of nectar-rich flora. The <b>brood</b> production, <b>food</b> storage, bee population and honey yield of Yemeni (native) and Carniolan (imported) colonies on Talh trees (Acacia gerrardii Benth.), a nectar-rich, subtropical, and summer bee forage source in Central Arabia were evaluated. Owing to their structural and behavioral adaptations, the Yemeni bees constructed stronger (high population size) colonies than the Carniolan bees. Although both groups yielded similar amounts of Talh honey, the Yemeni bees consumed their stored honey rapidly if not timely harvested. A. m. jemenitica has a higher performance than A. m. carnica during extremely hot-dry conditions and A. gerrardii nectar-rich flow...|$|R
30|$|Sex-specific parental {{roles of}} most raptors allow mates to {{cooperate}} during breeding; while females incubate and <b>brood,</b> males provide <b>food.</b> If one partner fails in its parental duties, however, sex-specific parental roles can limit {{the ability of}} each sex {{to carry out the}} role normally performed by its partner. We observed the effect of male food provisioning on female parental care in Boreal Owls Aegolius funereus using cameras at 12 nests in western Finland in 2005. We compared the parental care of eight females in nests with a high male feeding rate (successful nests) with that of the females in four nests with a low or zero male feeding rate (failed nests).|$|R
