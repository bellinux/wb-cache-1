40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} was to {{evaluate}} the success and cost evaluation experiment of regeneration of forest in the area named Rakovec I (ŠLP) For this purpose, was established 5 different types of forest regeneration on the clearing area on an area of 0. 15 hectares. This area was formed after the wind calamity in mostly unoriginal spruce forest. Monitoring was conducted on this area from spring 2013 to autumn 2015. The "A" variant simulates re-growth using sowing of an alder (Alnus glutinosa (L.) Gaertn) into a manually pre-prepared soil. The variant "B" represents the re-growth of forest by using a broadcast sowing of a birch (Betula pendula Roth.). The variant "C" represents the re-growth through sowing an alder (Alnus glutinosa (L.) Gaertn) and a birch (Betula pendula Roth.), into a mechanickly pre-prepared soil. The variants "D" and "E" simulate re-growth using <b>bare</b> <b>root</b> <b>plant,</b> planted by dibble level planting. For the variant "D" is selected a tree species alder (Alnus glutinosa (L.) Gaertn), and for the variant "E" isselected a spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karsten). According to an economic standpoint it is the least expensive a variant "B" (13, 508. 37 CZK/ha), in {{which is the only}} expense the purchase of seeds and subsequent sowing. Conversely, the most expensive variant is a variant of "E" (81, 270 CZK/ha). Highest success of forest regeneration is a variant of "D", when from a total count of 93 pieces of seedlings in the autumn of 2015 was on the area a count of 90 pieces of viable individualsThe lowest succed of forest regeneration is in the variant "C", in which was found in the autumn of 2014 only 22 pieces of viable individuals on an area of 0. 021 hectares...|$|E

However, the low water holding capacity of the medium necessitates frequent irrigation.

Adding 10 % sand (v/v) increased water holding capacity of medium slightly at soil water pressures lower than - 1 kPa. Gravel amended with 40 % calcined clay had 16 % air-filled porosity and had 3. 5 times more plant available water than gravel with sand only. Dry weights of seedlings grown in the medium amended with 40 % calcined clay and no sand were over twice as great as those of seedlings grown in the standard MGB medium...|$|R

Price per plant also depends on root biomass, a higher root biomass being more valuable because of the increased chance of establishment. At the farm participating in this study, rooting of cuttings is highly variable and salable plants per season are at around 60 - 70 %.

40|$|In the {{southern}} regions of Mediterranean areas the plantations with fresh plants (winter planting system) have almost completely replaced those with cold stored plants (summer planting system). Particularly, fresh <b>bare</b> <b>root</b> <b>plants</b> produced in high elevation nurseries located in Spain and Poland and, in experimental phase, in {{the southern}} of Italy (in the mountains of Sicily, Calabria, Basilicata) are the most used. Such type of plant usually has a crown diameter from 6 to 14 mm, but the smallest plants should be (< 8 mm) discarded in phase of selection and packing. Objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the influence of the different crown diameter on the earliness, productivity and quality of two new cultivars of strawberry. The research was carried out in 2007 / 08 in the experimental fields located in Palermo. Three typologies of fresh bare-root plants (small plants: crown diameter 6 - 8 mm; medium plants: 8. 1 - 11 mm and large plants 11. 1 - 14 mm) and two cultivars ('Candonga' and 'Nora') were compared. The experimental design was a split-plot with 3 replication and individual experimental plot of 4. 6 m(2). The plantation was established the 22 nd of October in a plastic greenhouse of 600 m 2, on two-row beds and at a plants density of 9. 1 plant/m(2). The production started in January and finished in May. The medium plants (crown diameter 8. 1 - 11 mm) were earlier than the others types. The marketable production during the whole harvesting period was influenced by crown diameter. Large and medium plants (crown diameter 8. 1 - 14 mm) produced more than small plants (crown diameter 6 - 8 mm) (respectively 590 and 551 g/plant). 'Candonga' (586. 8 g/plant) produced more than 'Nora' (567. 9 g/plant). The average strawberry weight wasn't statistically influenced by the typology of plant but by the cultivar; 'Candonga' produced the biggest fruits. The crown diameter of fresh plants influenced earliness and productivity of strawberries. To ensure high production it should be use medium and large fresh plant with a crown diameter from 8. 1 to 14 mm...|$|R
50|$|In continuous-flow {{solution}} culture, {{the nutrient}} solution constantly flows past the roots. It {{is much easier}} to automate than the static solution culture because sampling and adjustments to the temperature and nutrient concentrations can be made in a large storage tank that has potential to serve thousands of plants. A popular variation is the nutrient film technique or NFT, whereby a very shallow stream of water containing all the dissolved nutrients required for plant growth is recirculated past the <b>bare</b> <b>roots</b> of <b>plants</b> in a watertight thick root mat, which develops {{in the bottom of the}} channel and has an upper surface that, although moist, is in the air. Subsequent to this, an abundant supply of oxygen is provided to the <b>roots</b> of the <b>plants.</b> A properly designed NFT system is based on using the right channel slope, the right flow rate, and the right channel length. The main advantage of the NFT system over other forms of hydroponics is that the <b>plant</b> <b>roots</b> are exposed to adequate supplies of water, oxygen, and nutrients. In all other forms of production, there is a conflict between the supply of these requirements, since excessive or deficient amounts of one results in an imbalance of one or both of the others. NFT, because of its design, provides a system where all three requirements for healthy plant growth can be met at the same time, provided that the simple concept of NFT is always remembered and practised. The result of these advantages is that higher yields of high-quality produce are obtained over an extended period of cropping. A downside of NFT is that it has very little buffering against interruptions in the flow (e.g. power outages). But, overall, it is probably one of the more productive techniques.|$|R
50|$|Nutrient film {{technique}} (NFT) is a hydroponic technique wherein a very shallow {{stream of}} water containing all the dissolved nutrients required for plant growth is re-circulated past the <b>bare</b> <b>roots</b> of <b>plants</b> in a watertight gully, also known as channels.

Restoration is needed to replace wildlife habitat. This study focused on site selection for native cottonwood (Populus deltoides Bartr. Ex Marsh. ssp. Monilifers (Ait.) Eckenwalde) restoration to help mitigate this loss. Geographic information systems technologies were used to develop a suitability model for cottonwood restoration. Tribal lands were extracted from a digital dataset oflandownership. Those touched by or included in a 46 m border of the Moreau River were candidate sites. Of the 182 candidates, 50 sites were randomly selected for model development. Slope, aspect, stream length and number, soil properties, and land cover criteria were given a numeric score and these were summed; the lowest total score possible was - 7 and the highest score possible was 33. The sample sites were evaluated and ranked as high (21 to 33, 7 sites), medium (7 to 20, 35 sites), or low (- 7 to 6, 8 sites) for growth and maintenance of riparian cottonwood forests.

The measurement of the height and thickness of the root neck of the seedlings was carried out on designated plots in March 2015.

Furthermore, 154 seedlings, 84 containerized seedlings a 70 <b>bare</b> <b>root</b> seedlings, in order to evalutate the development of the root system, its possible deformation and subsequently detection of the volume by using xylometric method. The data collected in the field were processed into tables and compared with the results observed in the bachelor thesis. The average figures for the height, the thickness of the root neck and the volume of the root system showed almost identical development of <b>bare</b> <b>root</b> and containerized seedlings in the forest cover, even though the figures of individual seedlings were highly variable. When reviewing the development of the root system, I found unacceptable deformation of the main taproot at 25 % containerized seedlings and 20 % <b>bare</b> <b>root</b> seedlings. The remaining seedlings were without deformation or with acceptable deformation of the taproot (wavy taproot, unbalanced taproot with the axis in the above-ground part, an outgrowth).
