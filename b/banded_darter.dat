5|$|An October 2001 {{survey of}} Mahanoy Creek {{identified}} {{two species of}} fish each at Ashland and Girardville. There were 20 individuals at the latter location and 22 at the former. There were also 13 species and 134 individuals at Gowen City, and 14 species and 545 individuals at the creek's mouth. Additionally, 1003 individuals and 20 species of fish were observed {{at the mouth of}} the tributary Schwaben Creek. White Suckers were found at each of the aforementioned sites. Other fish species found on Mahanoy Creek and Schwaben Creek include the swallowtail shiner, the rosyface shiner, the river chub, the <b>banded</b> <b>darter,</b> and the shield darter. Brown trout, longnose dace, and eastern blacknose dace have also been observed in the watershed. Historically, deer came to the creek to consume salt.|$|E
500|$|<b>Banded</b> <b>Darter</b> (Sympetrum pedemontanum), {{recorded}} {{just once}} to date, near Tredegar, Monmouthshire on 16 August 1995, although a darter seen on 29 July 2003 at Hickling Broad, Norfolk, which had dark bands on its wings, {{may have been}} this species ...|$|E
50|$|Not much {{information}} is available on management and conservation of the <b>banded</b> <b>darter.</b> Since the <b>banded</b> <b>darter</b> is one of North America's most common darters, the species is not listed on the federal endangered list. Mainly, the only agencies working on conservation for the darter are state agencies. The <b>banded</b> <b>darter</b> is protected in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Tennessee and North Carolina. Some ideas for management of the <b>banded</b> <b>darter</b> are to stop building dams and stop pollution of streams they inhabit. The <b>banded</b> <b>darter</b> is sensitive to siltation and pollution, and dams are thought to limit its distribution. The <b>banded</b> <b>darter</b> will also be affected by run-off from surrounding lands of the river or stream they inhabit. Michigan state agencies are managing the darter by monitoring habitat and water chemistry. If a dam is built in a river the <b>banded</b> <b>darter</b> inhabits, the dam would be destruction to the habitat.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to brook trout and brown trout, large populations of young fallfish {{have been observed}} in Lewis Creek, even though the species has been declining in population in the area. The only game fish in the creek are brook trout and brown trout. Young-of-the-year were unusually rare in the creek in 2005. Other fish species inhabiting it include central stoneroller, spottail shiners, swallowtail shiners, bluntnose minnows, eastern blacknose dace, longnose dace, white suckers, tessellated <b>darters,</b> <b>banded</b> <b>darters,</b> and sculpins.|$|R
5000|$|Areas of slow riffles {{and some}} {{moderate}} flows characterize the {{portions of the}} Little Chucky Creek that the chucky madtom occupies. The beds of these streams usually consist of gravel or flat slabs of rock. Due to {{the small amount of}} specimens observed in the wild there is currently no information about the diet of the chucky madtom or whether or not it has any natural predators. The species the chucky madtom competes with is also unknown, although when chucky madtom species were collected there were other species of fish usually present. Species such as the central stoneroller, banded sculpins, greenside darders, redline <b>darters,</b> and <b>banded</b> <b>darters.</b> The current habitat has a few indicators of good stream health like the aforementioned mussels. Upstream from the known range of the madtom there is some impact on the land from agricultural use. Environmental pressures like siltation and destruction of the riparian zone may play a key part in the range of this endangered fish.|$|R
40|$|Apple Creek as {{the third}} best {{candidate}} stream in Ohio for supporting trout. This designation was based on water temperature and quality, trout habitat suitability, and public access. Despite the designation, ODNR has not stocked trout in Apple Creek. Clear Fork Chapter of Trout Unlimited (TU) received permission from ODNR to privately stock 850 rainbow trout in Apple Creek (a one-mile stretch at Grosjean Park in Wooster) on March 19, 2005. An informal, volunteer fishing survey was conducted and found at least 794 catches over a 12 -week period. An additional 450 rainbows were stocked in Apple Creek at the Park on October 29, 2005. At {{the time of this}} writing (February 12, 2006), fish from the second stocking are being caught by sports fishermen. On October 5, 2005 I conducted an electrofishing survey of the stocked section of Apple Creek with several members of the local TU chapter. No rainbow trout were observed or captured in a 1. 5 -hour sampling period. Given the efficiency at which we were collecting other large-bodied species of fish, I believe that all of the trout have been removed from this section by fisherman, washed downstream, or otherwise perished during the summer. Other fish species caught included rainbow and <b>banded</b> <b>darters,</b> striped shiner, central stoneroller, creek chub, bluntnos...|$|R
50|$|The <b>banded</b> <b>darter</b> {{prefers to}} live around swift riffles of {{moderately}} large to large cobble or gravel, rock slabs, and small boulders in moderate-sized streams and rivers. The <b>banded</b> <b>darter</b> prefers water deeper than 25 cm in the riffles around the midchannel {{of the river}} or creek. The diet of the <b>banded</b> <b>darter</b> consists of midge, mayfly larva, black flies and trichopeteran larvae. Ten specimens of the <b>banded</b> <b>darter</b> were captured and monitored in a tank. Chironomids (larvae of non-biting flies called midges), ephemeropterans (mayflies), and trichopterans (caddisflies) were supplied for the darters to eat. The study found the <b>banded</b> <b>darter</b> prefers chironomids over the mayflies (ephemeropterans) or caddisflies (trichopterans), and the fish fed more during the day than they did at night. The <b>banded</b> <b>darter</b> has a diverse range of temperatures it can tolerate; it can survive in water between 32 and 80 °F, but its preferred temperature range is between 72 and 76 °F. As a small fish, banded darters have numerous predators including larger fish such as smallmouth bass and largemouth bass, as well as fish-eating birds like herons and egrets. This darter will compete with other darters for habitat. For example, in the Susquehanna River drainage, the tessellated darter competes with the <b>banded</b> <b>darter.</b> Humans may affect their distribution. For example, dams slow the flow of a river or a creek and could cause loss of habitat. By contrast, climate change / global warming could increase the range of distribution of the <b>banded</b> <b>darter</b> by resulting in warmer water closer to their preferred temperature.|$|E
50|$|The <b>banded</b> <b>darter</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} common darters in North America, where an {{estimated}} 250 species of darters occur. The <b>banded</b> <b>darter</b> has a widespread distribution throughout much of eastern United States, primarily the Mississippi Basin. It ranges from the Verdigris River in Kansas eastward to the Allegheny River in New York and from the Minnesota River in Minnesota southward to the Ouachita River in Arkansas and the Tennessee River in Alabama. The <b>banded</b> <b>darter</b> can also be found in the headwaters of the Savannah River, in drainages of Lake Michigan, in the Duck River, and other streams across eastern United States. The species has been introduced in a few non-native streams. Its most distinguishable introduction has occurred in the Susquehanna River drainage. Specimens of the <b>banded</b> <b>darter</b> and the native darter, Etheostoma olmstedi (tessellated darter), were collected at Catatonk Creek in New York beginning in the 1960s. Biologists have studied the two darters and their niches in the Susquehanna River drainage. They found the <b>banded</b> <b>darter</b> was outcompeting the tessellated darter for habitat and resources. The buccal cavity length of the tessellated darter has increased since the <b>banded</b> <b>darter</b> was introduced to the watershed, which is expected to result in higher suction feeding performance measured as volumetric flow rate of water through the mouth. The morphological change in the tessellated darter was likely caused from the <b>banded</b> <b>darter</b> taking over the niche of the tessellated darter.|$|E
50|$|The brighteye darter (Etheostoma lynceum) is {{a species}} of darter endemic to the eastern United States. The brighteye darter was first {{described}} by Oliver Perry Hay in 1885. He noted it {{is closely related to}} the <b>banded</b> <b>darter</b> (E. zonale). Until the 1970s, the brighteye darter was generally believed to be a genetic variation of the <b>banded</b> <b>darter.</b>|$|E
50|$|Newtown Green {{consists}} of open areas of green space for informal recreation and organised sports. Mature trees form {{the perimeter of}} the site and the Aylesford Stream runs along the edge. Ruddy <b>darter,</b> <b>banded</b> demoiselle, blue-tailed damselfly and common blue damselfly have been recorded at the site.|$|R
50|$|The <b>banded</b> <b>darter</b> (Sympetrum pedemontanum) is a European {{species of}} {{dragonfly}} {{of the family}} Libellulidae.|$|E
50|$|The <b>banded</b> <b>darter</b> {{has been}} {{recorded}} in Britain just once, in Wales, in the Sympetrum immigration year of 1995 on 16-17 August.|$|E
50|$|Males of the <b>banded</b> <b>darter,</b> {{like most}} members of the genus, have a red abdomen. The species' primary {{distinguishing}} feature however is the presence, in both sexes, of broad black bands across the outer section of each wing. It is similar in size to the black darter (Sympetrum danae) (35-40mm), sharing the broad hindwings and black legs.|$|E
5000|$|The first <b>banded</b> <b>darter</b> was {{described}} by Cope in 1868 in the North Fork of the Holston River in Virginia. Spawning season occurs during late spring in April and May, but the breeding color for the males begins to intensify during February. [...] A <b>banded</b> <b>darter</b> can spawn at one year of age. The breeding color helps attract females to the males. The female <b>banded</b> <b>darter</b> will attach adhesive eggs to algae. While spawning, males are territorial and would chase other banded darters. Most pairs of banded darters would court and spawn in a 1-m2 area. While breeding, the male darters would stimulate the nape and head regions of the females by using their heads or fins. Once the female began undulating, the male quickly mounted her with his head, and they both quivered in unison while moving 2-3 cm forward. The process took usually no more than 1 sec. Fertilization of the eggs is external. After the female spawns, the male will swim away. For eight breeding pairs of darters, {{the least amount of}} time it took a pair to mate was four minutes, while the longest spawning time took 54 min. In the Duck River in Tennessee and three separate populations of darters in Arkansas, interannual variation in the banded darter’s clutch size appears to be less extensive than geographic variation, but egg size is less variable than clutch size due to geographical and temporal locations. Clutch size will vary from 10 to around 100 eggs.|$|E
50|$|A {{valuable}} habitat {{has been}} generated on the Große Aue for {{plants and animals}} typical of water meadows. In the wet biotopes and in the standing and flowing waters there are grass rushes, water violets and blister sedges as well as short-winged coneheads and large marsh grasshoppers. Threatened dragonflies, such as the <b>banded</b> <b>darter,</b> southern emerald damselfly live here as do birds like the whitethroat and little grebe. Reed buntings, reed warblers and snipe also occur here.|$|E

Other fish species found on Mahanoy Creek and Schwaben Creek include the swallowtail shiner, the rosyface shiner, the river chub, the <b>banded</b> <b>darter,</b> and the shield darter. Brown trout, longnose dace, and eastern blacknose dace have also been observed in the watershed. Historically, deer came to the creek to consume salt.|$|E
5000|$|Etheostoma zonale, the <b>banded</b> <b>darter,</b> is {{a species}} of darter endemic to the eastern United States. It is mainly found in the Mississippi Basin, ranging from the Verdigris River in Kansas eastward to the Allegheny River in New York, and from the Minnesota River in Minnesota southward to the Ouachita River in Arkansas and the Tennessee River in Alabama. Its typical habitat in small and {{medium-sized}} rivers is riffles over cobble or gravel, rock slabs, and small boulders. It feeds on the riverbed on small insect larvae and is itself eaten by birds and larger fish. Males become more colorful and become territorial before spawning which takes place in spring. The females attach the eggs to waterweed. The population trend of this fish seems to be stable, {{it is a common}} species with numerous sub-populations over a wide range, no major threats have been identified and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of [...] "least concern".|$|E
40|$|Effective {{conservation}} of fish species of greatest conservation need (SGCN) {{requires an understanding}} of species– habitat relationships and distributional trends. Thus, modeling the distribution of fish species across large spatial scales may be a valuable tool for conservation planning. Our goals were to evaluate the status of 10 fish SGCN in wadeable Iowa streams and to test the effectiveness of Iowa Aquatic Gap Analysis Project (IAGAP) species distribution models. We sampled fish assemblages from 86 wadeable stream segments in the Mississippi River drainage of Iowa during 2009 and 2010 to provide contemporary, independent fish species presence–absence data. The frequencies of occurrence in stream segments where species were historically documented varied from 0. 0 % for redfin shiner Lythrurus umbratilis to 100. 0 % for American brook lamprey Lampetra appendix, {{with a mean of}} 53. 0 %, suggesting that the status of Iowa fish SGCN is highly variable. Cohen’s kappa values and other model performance measures were calculated by comparing field-collected presence–absence data with IAGAP model–predicted presences and absences for 12 fish SGCN. Kappa values varied from 0. 00 to 0. 50, with a mean of 0. 15. The models only predicted the occurrences of <b>banded</b> <b>darter</b> Etheostoma zonale, southern redbelly dace Phoxinus erythrogaster, and longnose dace Rhinichthys cataractae more accurately than would be expected by chance. Overall, the accuracy of the twelve models was low, with a mean correct classification rate of 58. 3 %. Poor model performance probably reflects the difficultie...|$|E
