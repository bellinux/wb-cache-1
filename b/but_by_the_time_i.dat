500|$|After his 34th {{birthday}} on August 6, 2003, {{he gave up}} alcohol, caffeine, red meat, {{refined sugar}} and his longtime (sometimes abused) regimen of psychiatric medication. Director Mike Mills had been working with Smith during his final years and described Smith's troubles and apparent recovery: [...] "I gave the script to him, then he dropped {{off the face of}} the earth [...] he went through his whole crazy time, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> was done with the film, he was making From a Basement on the Hill and I was shocked that he was actually making music." ...|$|E
500|$|Hillenburg went to Humboldt State University, in Arcata, California, as a marine-science major. He also minored in art, {{and claimed}} that [...] " [...] blossomed as a painter in Humboldt." [...] In 1984, he earned his bachelor's degree in natural-resource {{planning}} and interpretation, with an emphasis in marine resources. He intended to take a master's degree, but {{said it would be}} in art: [...] "Initially I think I assumed that if I went to school for art I would never have any way of making a living, so I thought it might be smarter to keep art my passion and hobby and study something else. <b>But</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> got to the end of my undergrad work, I realized I should be in art." ...|$|E
60|$|He rushed like {{a madman}} from the room, and I {{followed}} {{him as soon as}} I had sufficiently recovered my wits. <b>But,</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> had {{reached the top of the}} stairs, he was out of sight.|$|E

6000|$|... "He was {{standing}} under that light when I drove {{out from the}} stable. I ran to speak to him, and then he took to his legs and scooted around yonder corner.

6000|$|...

60|$|And {{it was no}} {{more than}} just enough. I ordered the {{windlass}} manned, the sails loosed, and the topsails set. <b>But</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> had cast the ship I could hardly feel any breath of wind. Nevertheless, I trimmed the yards and put everything on her. I was {{not going to give up}} the attempt.|$|E

60|$|In {{the road}} below me were three figures,--a lady, a gentleman, {{and a little}} girl. As the latter turned towards the lady who {{addressed}} her, I recognized the unmistakable copper-colored tresses, trim figure, delicate complexion, and refined features of the friend of my youth! I seized my hat, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> had reached the road, they had disappeared.|$|E
60|$|Our way now led us {{into the}} {{north-east}} quarter of the town, among pleasant new faubourgs, to a decent new church of a good size, where I was soon seated {{by the side of}} my good Samaritan, and looked upon by a whole congregation of menacing faces. At first the possibility of danger kept me awake; <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> had assured myself there was none to be apprehended, and the service was not in the least likely to be enlivened by the arrest of a French spy, I had to resign myself to the task of listening to Dr. Henry Gray.|$|E
60|$|Let me beg you--now and always--not {{to think}} that I mean more than I say. In all probability, I mean just what I say, and only that.

You are perfectly welcome to know all that I think, as soon as I have put before you all my grounds for thinking it; <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> have done so, {{you will be able to}} form an opinion of your own; and mine will then be of no consequence to you.|$|E
50|$|The Maserati Boomerang was {{a concept}} car {{designed}} by Giorgetto Giugiaro.

6000|$|We {{have another}} boy, born the 10th of March. He {{is very much}} such a child as Bob was at his age, rather of a longer order. Bob is [...] "short and low," [...] and I expect always will be. He talks very plainly--almost as plainly as anybody. He is quite smart enough. I {{sometimes}} fear that {{he is one of}} the little rare-ripe sort that are smarter at about five than ever after. He has a great deal of that sort of mischief that is the offspring of such animal spirits. Since I began this letter, a messenger came to tell me Bob was lost; <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> reached the house his mother had found him and had him whipped, and by now, very likely, he is run away again.|$|E

6000|$|... "Would it?" [...] I growled, {{much less}} amused now; <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> {{had decided that}} this remark was not meant for a dig at me he had worked himself into a high state of resentfulness against Falk. The inconvenience, the damage, the expense! Gottferdam! Devil take the fellow. Behind the bar Schomberg with a cigar in his teeth, pretended to be writing with a pencil on a large sheet of paper; and as Hermann's {{excitement}} increased it made me comfortingly aware of my own calmness and superiority. But {{it occurred to me}} while I listened to his revilings, that after all the good man had come up in the tug. There perhaps--since he must come to town--he had no option. But evidently he had had a drink with Falk, either accepted or offered. How was that? So I checked him by saying loftily that I hoped he would make Falk pay for every penny of the damage.|$|E
60|$|The {{return of}} the tug from the outer Roads was {{unexpected}} but possible, for Falk had taken away the Diana at half-past five, and it was now two o'clock. Schomberg wished me to observe that neither of these men would spend a dollar on a tiffin, which they must have wanted. <b>But</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> was ready to leave the dining-room Falk had gone. I heard {{the last of his}} big boots on the planks of the verandah. Hermann was sitting quite alone in the large, wooden room with the two lifeless billiard tables shrouded in striped covers, mopping his face diligently. He wore his best go-ashore clothes, a stiff collar, black coat, large white waistcoat, grey trousers. A white cotton sunshade with a cane handle reposed between his legs, his side whiskers were neatly brushed, his chin had been freshly shaved; and he only distantly resembled the dishevelled and terrified man in a snuffy night shirt and ignoble old trousers I had seen in the morning hanging on to the wheel of the Diana.|$|E
6000|$|... "Suddenly, as she spoke, I saw {{her white}} face grow whiter {{yet in the}} moonlight, and her hand {{tightened}} upon my shoulder. Something was moving {{in the shadow of}} the tool-house. I saw a dark, creeping figure which crawled round the corner and squatted in front of the door. Seizing my pistol, I was rushing out, when my wife threw her arms round me and held me with convulsive strength. I tried to throw her off, but she clung to me most desperately. At last I got clear, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> had opened the door and reached the house the creature was gone. He had left a trace of his presence, however, for there on the door was the very same arrangement of dancing men which had already twice appeared, and which I have copied on that paper. There was no other sign of the fellow anywhere, though I ran all over the grounds. And yet the amazing thing is that he must have been there all the time, for when I examined the door again in the morning, he had scrawled some more of his pictures under the line which I had already seen." ...|$|E

'I {{provided}} {{myself with}} two disguises, as a careful man should, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> reached that outlandish hole, Asquith, the little thing I was {{mixed up in}} burst prematurely, and the papers were full of it that morning. The whole place was out with sticks, so to speak, hunting for you. They told me the published description hit you to a dot, all except the scar, and they quarrelled about that. I posed as the promoter of resort syndicates, and I hired the Scimitar and sailed over to Bear Island; and I didn't have a bad time that afternoon, only Cooke insisted on making remarks about my whiskers, and I was in mortal fear lest he might accidentally pull one off. He came cursed near it. By the way, he's the very deuce of a man, isn't he? I knew he took me for a detective, so I played the part. And in the night that ass of a state senator nearly gave me pneumonia by getting me out {{in the air to}} tell me they had hid you in a cave. So I sat up all night, and followed the relief party in the morning, and you nearly disfigured me for life when you threw that bottle into the woods. Then I went back to camp, and left so fast that I forgot my extra pair of red whiskers. I had two of each disguise, you know, so I didn't miss them.|$|E
6000|$|When {{we arrived}} in Dundee, Mrs. B- was already there, waiting to take him home. We {{travelled}} up to London by the same train; <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> {{had managed to get}} through with my examination the ship had sailed on her next voyage without him, and, instead of joining her again, I went by request to see my old commander in his home. This {{is the only one of}} my captains I have ever visited in that way. He was out of bed by then, [...] "quite convalescent," [...] as he declared, making a few tottering steps to meet me at the sitting- room door. Evidently he was reluctant to take his final cross- bearings of this earth for a Departure on the only voyage to an unknown destination a sailor ever undertakes. And it was all very nice--the large, sunny room; his deep, easy-chair in a bow window, with pillows and a footstool; the quiet, watchful care of the elderly, gentle woman who had borne him five children, and had not, perhaps, lived with him more than five full years out of the thirty or so of their married life. There was also another woman there in a plain black dress, quite gray-haired, sitting very erect on her chair with some sewing, from which she snatched side-glances in his direction, and uttering not a single word during all the time of my call. Even when, in due course, I carried over to her a cup of tea, she only nodded at me silently, with the faintest ghost of a smile on her tight-set lips. I imagine she must have been a maiden sister of Mrs. B- come to help nurse her brother-in-law. His youngest boy, a late-comer, a great cricketer it seemed, twelve years old or thereabouts, chattered enthusiastically of the exploits of W. G. Grace. And I remember his eldest son, too, a newly-fledged doctor, who took me out to smoke in the garden, and, shaking his head with professional gravity, but with genuine concern, muttered: [...] "Yes, but he doesn't get back his appetite. I don't like that--I don't like that at all." [...] The last sight of Captain B- I had was as he nodded his head to me out of the bow window when I turned round to close the front gate.|$|E
