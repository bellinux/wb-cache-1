5|$|The player, as Yumetaro, must {{venture into}} the {{alternate}} dimension to rescue his new owner. The player character can jump and spawn stars above the horn on his head. The star is a central mechanic to the game, being necessary to defeat enemies found while also doubling as a platform, capable of being ridden to reach otherwise inaccessible areas. The player must make their way through six stages and six bosses to complete the game. Once the sixth <b>boss</b> <b>is</b> defeated, it is revealed that the girl is still missing and the game restarts from the beginning. To truly complete Gimmick!, the player must find a hidden area in each stage where a magic item resides. If one can obtain each all the magic items without losing every life (i.e. using no continues), a secret stage will appear in which an extra boss must be beaten. Only after this <b>boss</b> <b>is</b> defeated is the game completed in full, with a cutscene showing Yumetaro rescuing the girl and leading {{her back to the}} real world.|$|E

As he leaves the party, Michael brings Gabe into the joke by threatening to kill him if he breaks Erin's heart.|$|E
5|$|Mega Man: Dr. Wily's Revenge is an action-platformer that shares many {{similarities}} {{with its}} NES counterparts. The player, as Mega Man, {{is able to}} choose among four stages to complete in whatever order desired. Each stage contains various enemies to blast through and obstacles to overcome, such as leaping between disappearing blocks over deadly spikes and bottomless pits. Mega Man's primary weapon is an arm cannon that has unlimited ammunition. Destroyed enemies typically leave items that replenish Mega Man's health or extra lives. At {{the end of every}} stage is a boss battle with a robot master, and defeating it earns the player its special weapon. Each <b>boss</b> <b>is</b> weak to another's weapon, allowing the player to strategize the order in which they are beaten.|$|E

While working to contain the damage, the <b>Boss</b> <b>is</b> informed that STAG, {{in an attempt to}} discredit the Saints, has rigged the Steelport Monument with explosives, leaving several kidnapped Saints, including Shaundi, Viola, and Mayor Burt Reynolds at the site to frame them. At the same time, Killbane is fleeing the country by private flight.|$|E
5|$|The game offers four {{different}} difficulty settings and includes online leaderboards which enumerate high scores that different players have achieved for the game. The game is segmented into protecting six different villages, and each village is broken up into four levels: a Day level, a Boss level, a Night level, and a bonus level. Levels are further broken into waves as increasingly difficult enemies attack the village. The bonus level drops the top-down camera view and is played {{from the perspective}} of the driver seat of the car. Boss levels confront the player with a boss enemy that is much stronger than the other enemies encountered in the game. Each boss requires the player to discover and employ a predefined strategy in order to defeat them. For example, the first <b>boss</b> <b>is</b> a giant steamroller with an attached flamethrower that can not be damaged by the car's regular guns and instead requires the use of napalm to destroy it.|$|E
5|$|Battles {{take place}} on grid-based {{self-contained}} maps and are governed by a turn-based system where units on both sides are given their chance to move and act. Once a unit has moved, depending on their position relative to allied units and enemies, they may perform actions such as attacking or supporting allied characters through statistic-enhancing abilities, or they can wait until the next turn. When attacking, the game transitions from the top-down view of the map to a side-view battlefield, where a cinematic battle plays between the player and enemy units. Each unit has access to different weapons and items, but these will break {{after a number of}} uses and must be repaired in between missions. The effectiveness of melee weapons is dictated with the series' recurring Weapons Triangle mechanic: axes are strong against lances, lances strong against swords, and swords strong against axes. Villages found during map battles will be attacked; if defended by the player, non-player characters within the village will give hints about future objectives. A map is cleared when the <b>boss</b> <b>is</b> defeated. If characters fall in battle, they are subjected to permanent death, removing them {{from the rest of the}} game. If Roy dies, the game ends and the map must be restarted.|$|E
