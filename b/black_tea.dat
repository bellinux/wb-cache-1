5|$|Post-fermented tea: Teas {{that are}} allowed to undergo a second {{oxidation}} after the fixation of the tea leaves, such as Pu-erh, Liu'an, and Liubao, are collectively referred to as secondary or post-fermentation teas in English. In Chinese they are categorized as Dark tea or <b>black</b> <b>tea.</b> This {{is not to be}} confused with the English term <b>Black</b> <b>tea,</b> known in Chinese as red tea. Pu-erh, also known as Póu léi (Polee) in Cantonese is the most common type of post-fermentation tea in the market.|$|E
5|$|Tea is also {{a widely}} {{consumed}} beverage and is served at cafés and drunk at home. Tea is prepared in many ways, from plain brewed Russian and Turkish-style <b>black</b> <b>tea</b> with sugar, to tea with lemon or milk, and, available as a common option in most establishments, Middle Eastern-style with mint (nana).|$|E
5|$|Prisoners ate {{meals in}} their cells, {{from the early}} years of the prison through to its closure in 1991. Bread from the prison bakehouse was {{included}} in every meal in the convict era. It was served with <b>black</b> <b>tea</b> for breakfast, and with either tea or cocoa in the evening. The main meal, called dinner, was in the middle of the day, and also featured soup, meat, and vegetables.|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of the present study}} were {{to determine the effects of}} the brewing method on the amount of the major catechins, methylxanthines, total polyphenols and antioxidant capacity in green and <b>black</b> <b>teas,</b> and to correlate the chemical composition of tea infusions to their sensorial properties by the combined use of the electronic nose and tongue. For this purpose, tea infusions were prepared from 7 green <b>teas</b> and 6 <b>black</b> <b>teas</b> using different extraction times (3 - 5 and 10 min). The extraction of total polyphenols and catechins was increased by prolonging the infusion time from 3 - 5 to 10 min, while the caffeine amounts did not increase. The antioxidant activity of teas was well correlated with polyphenol content. Electronic tongue and electronic nose were able to discriminate green <b>teas</b> from <b>black</b> <b>teas</b> on the basis of their sensorial properties. Considering the taste, green teas were characterized by astringency and aftertaste-astringency and this sensation was increased by prolonging the infusion time; <b>black</b> <b>teas</b> were perceived as more bitter, sour, salty and the extraction time affected the astringent sensation. The aroma of green and <b>black</b> <b>teas</b> was discriminated by specific sensors and the increase of the extraction time produced more richly flavoured infusions. This work adds information about correlation between sensorial properties, antioxidant capacity and chemical composition of green and <b>black</b> <b>teas...</b>|$|R
2500|$|The more {{delicate}} <b>black</b> <b>teas,</b> such as Darjeeling, should be steeped for 3 to 4 minutes. The same holds for broken leaf teas, which have more surface area and need less brewing time than whole leaves. Whole-leaf <b>black</b> <b>teas,</b> and <b>black</b> <b>teas</b> {{to be served}} with milk or lemon, should be steeped 4 to 5 minutes. Longer steeping times makes the tea bitter (at this point, it {{is referred to as}} being [...] "stewed" [...] in the UK). When the tea has brewed long enough to suit the drinker's taste, it should be strained before serving.|$|R

5|$|The {{recorded}} {{history of the}} town starts from the early 19th century when the colonial administration under the British Raj set up a sanatorium and a military depot in the region. Subsequently, extensive tea plantations were established {{in the region and}} tea growers developed hybrids of <b>black</b> <b>tea</b> and created new fermentation techniques. The resultant distinctive Darjeeling tea is internationally recognised and ranks among the most popular black teas in the world.|$|E
5|$|The Scuppernong had {{remained}} largely undeveloped throughout history. In 1793, {{the town of}} Columbia was built on its banks, as were several boat landings. The Scuppernong is a blackwater river: it water is colored like <b>black</b> <b>tea</b> or coffee. The Scuppernong served {{as a means of}} transportation for the early settlers in this region of North Carolina. Since 1989 the Nature Conservancy has sought to protect it in its most natural state. In 2002 the Nature Conservancy offered to donate four tracts of land that they owned along the Scuppernong if the state would purchase three more tracts that became available that same year. The state agreed and in 2004 the area along the river was officially added to the state park system.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the active}} {{substances}} in <b>black</b> <b>tea</b> do not develop at temperatures lower than 90°C (194°F). As a result, <b>black</b> <b>tea</b> in the West is usually steeped in water near its boiling point, at around 99°C (210°F). The most common fault when making <b>black</b> <b>tea</b> is to use water at too low a temperature. Since boiling point drops with increasing altitude, {{it is difficult to}} brew <b>black</b> <b>tea</b> properly in mountainous areas. Warming the tea pot before steeping is critical at any elevation.|$|E

50|$|Prince of Wales tea blend is a {{blend of}} <b>black</b> <b>teas</b> {{typically}} served in the afternoon with scones in Britain. The blend was originally devised for Edward, Prince of Wales, later King Edward VIII. The strong earthy scent of Edward's tea reportedly came from high grade Keemun tea from Anhui Province blended with other <b>black</b> <b>teas</b> from around China in order to produce a complex cup of tea. Prince of Wales tea is mild, but full-bodied, with a bright liquor and strong aroma.|$|R

25|$|Meta-analyses of {{observational}} {{studies have}} concluded that <b>black</b> <b>tea</b> consumption {{does not affect the}} development of oral cancers in Asian or Caucasian populations, esophageal cancer or prostate cancer in Asian populations, or lung cancer. <b>Black</b> <b>tea</b> consumption may be associated with a reduced risk of stroke. A 2013 Cochrane review of randomized controlled trials greater than 3 months duration concluded that long-term consumption of <b>black</b> <b>tea</b> only slightly lowers systolic and diastolic blood pressures (about 1-2 mmHg). A 2013 Cochrane review concluded that long-term <b>black</b> <b>tea</b> consumption lowers the blood concentration of LDL cholesterol by 0.43mmol/L (or 7.74mg/dL), but overall this research remains inconclusive.|$|E
25|$|While {{green tea}} usually loses its flavor within a year, <b>black</b> <b>tea</b> retains its flavour for several years. For this reason, {{it has long}} been an article of trade, and {{compressed}} bricks of <b>black</b> <b>tea</b> even served as a form of de facto currency in Mongolia, Tibet and Siberia into the 19th century. Although green tea has recently seen a revival due to its purported health benefits, <b>black</b> <b>tea</b> still accounts for over ninety percent of all tea sold in the West.|$|E
25|$|Generally, {{unblended}} <b>black</b> <b>teas</b> {{are named}} after the region {{in which they are}} produced. Often, different regions are known for producing teas with characteristic flavors.|$|R

25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that green and <b>black</b> <b>tea</b> may protect against cancer or other diseases such as obesity or Alzheimer's disease, but the compounds found in green tea have not been conclusively demonstrated to have any effect on human diseases.

25|$|Pu'er is a microbially {{fermented}} tea {{obtained through}} {{the action of}} molds, bacteria and yeasts on the harvested leaves of the tea plant. It is thus truly a fermented tea, whereas teas known in the west as <b>black</b> <b>teas</b> (known in China as Red teas) have only undergone large-scale oxidation through naturally occurring tea plant enzymes. Mislabelling the oxidation process as fermentation and thus naming <b>black</b> <b>teas,</b> such as Assam, Darjeeling or Keemun, as fermented teas has created endless confusion. Only tea such as pu'er, that has undergone microbial processing, can correctly be called a fermented tea.|$|R
