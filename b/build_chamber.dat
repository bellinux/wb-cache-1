5000|$|The DMLS {{process begins}} with a 3D CAD model whereby a [...]stl file is created {{and sent to the}} machine’s {{computer}} program. A technician works with this 3D model to properly orient the geometry for part building and adds supports structure as appropriate. Once this [...] "build file" [...] has been completed, it is [...] "sliced" [...] into the layer thickness the machine will build in and downloaded to the DMLS machine allowing the build to begin. The DMLS machine uses a high-powered 200 watt Yb-fiber optic laser. Inside the <b>build</b> <b>chamber</b> area, there is a material dispensing platform and a build platform along with a recoater blade used to move new powder over the build platform. The technology fuses metal powder into a solid part by melting it locally using the focused laser beam. Parts are built up additively layer by layer, typically using layers 20 micrometers thick.|$|E
30|$|The {{life history}} is {{univoltine}} based on field observations. Females deposit eggs {{at the base}} of flower buds of the host plant, D. sequax in autumn. The eggs hatch in 10 to 15 days. The hatched larvae feed on the flowers. Older larvae prefer to feed on beans inside of the pods. The larval stage lasts about 2 months. Mature larvae leave the host plant and crawl down to the soil. They <b>build</b> <b>chambers</b> underground for pupation. The pupal stage (Figure  3) lasts about 20 days. Newly emerged adults do not crawl out of the ground until spring. Adults feed on leaves (Figure  3) and survive from spring to autumn. They may disappear during the summer most probably due to summer diapause.|$|R

50|$|Sexual {{maturity}} of P. corroboree is reached at {{four years of}} age, with one year as an embryo/tadpole and two years as a juvenile/subadult. Adults primarily have only one breeding season. Breeding occurs around December terrestrially near shallow pools, fens, seepages, wet grassland or wet heaths, where the males <b>build</b> <b>chamber</b> nests within the grasses and moss. Males compete for females via song. Each male will attract up to ten females to his burrow sequentially and may dig a new burrow if his first is filled with eggs. The female lays up to 38 eggs and the male grasps her and deposits sperm directly onto the eggs. Tadpoles develop but remain within the protective egg coat until hatching occurs when high ground-water levels after rain cause the nest to become flooded at 4 to 6 months. Tadpole development takes six to eight months. Metamorphosis occurs between December and February (Osborne and Norman 1991). P. pengilleyi prefers to breed in sphagnum bogs and wet heath in sub-alpine areas and dense patches of herbs in openings or seepages amongst fallen tussocks at lower elevation (bog pools at high altitudes above 1300 m and in shallow seepage pools in gullies at lower altitudes of 1000-1400 m). Other reproductive details are as for P. corroboree. Both species are restricted to mountain and sub-alpine woodlands, heathlands and grasslands.|$|E
30|$|To save on {{costs and}} {{minimize}} material consumption, 80 – 95  % of un-sintered powder {{left in the}} <b>build</b> <b>chamber</b> after printing is recycled and a blend of virgin and reused powder are often used. Due to processing conditions such as heating and cooling of the building chamber, un-sintered powder degrades, causing a gradual reduction in quality. Temperature in the bed chamber and duration of the sintering process have major influences on the rate of this process. This also varies according to the location within the <b>build</b> <b>chamber,</b> and {{it was found that}} PA  12 powder (PA 2200, EOS GmbH) collected and analysed towards the centre and the base of the <b>build</b> <b>chamber</b> had a lower melt flow rate and are therefore less usable [60]. The powder was collected from two SLS machines EOSINT P 700 (EOS GmbH) and Sinterstationtm 2500 HIQ (3 D Systems Ltd). The term “orange peel” has been used to describe the phenomenon which occurs after too many repeated cycles without refreshing with virgin powder where a rough surface resembling the skin of a peeled orange arises [60].|$|E
30|$|In theory any {{thermoplastic}} material ground into a powdered form should {{be suitable for}} laser sintering but practically {{this is not the}} case. A range of factors can prevent production of good quality prototypes such as: different thermal properties of different materials, availability of powdered polymers with suitable particle size and morphology, broad thermal processing window and limitations in laser sintering systems. This has been discussed elsewhere [58]. The density and porosity of the sintered part will depend {{on the size of the}} particles and how densely these are packed in the <b>build</b> <b>chamber.</b> Other SLS parameters such as laser wavelength, laser energy, temperature distribution within the <b>build</b> <b>chamber</b> can also affect the mechanical properties of the part such as porosity or anisotropy [58].|$|E

40|$|Laser {{sintering}} {{technologies are}} well {{established in the}} rapid prototyping and rapid manufacturing industries, producing {{a wide range of}} products for an ever-increasing number of industry sectors. In theory, these processes facilitate direct digital fabrication from 3 D CAD models, creating items that have very sophisticated geometries with high levels of quality and accuracy. However, the laser sintering fabrication process is susceptible to part shrinkage which in turn may lead to dimensional inaccuracies (and therefore quality degradation) of the finished item. This paper reviews the issue of shrinkage for laser sintering in the z-axis, and using an EOS P 700 machine operating with polyamide- 12 material, demonstrates a technique for the assessment of this problem. The experimental results quantify the magnitude of z-axis shrinkage, finding it to be both non-linear and linked to thermal inconsistencies in the <b>build</b> <b>chamber.</b> The study shows that z-axis non-linear shrinkage is likely in all builds; however, its linearity may be improved through placement of products in the centre of the <b>build</b> <b>chamber.</b> The data presented highlight that current operational practices of factorial adjustment for each axis of the <b>build</b> <b>chamber</b> are inadequate and demonstrates the implications of these inaccuracies across different size build components...|$|E

The shrinkage and the mechanical performance of components across the entire <b>build</b> <b>chamber</b> have been tested and a non-linear shrinkage profile has been obtained. The middle of the <b>build</b> <b>chamber</b> recorded the highest degree of shrinkage and the shrinkage in Z direction had the largest variation. The laser sintered components built in X and Y directions recorded a 10 % lower tensile strength than the injection moulded samples of the same material where those built in the Z direction showed an approximately 50 % decrease in strength in comparison with the injection moulded test specimens. The crystallinity between the skin and the core of the sintered samples was different; varied with the position within the <b>build</b> <b>chamber</b> and coincided with noticeable sample colour changes...|$|E
30|$|Cooke et al. [63] {{found that}} in the {{majority}} of studies into the anisotropy of SLS objects not all building orientations were included and sample numbers were insufficient to provide statistically significant results. Using 288 DuraForm®GF samples produced using a Sinterstation HIQ (3 D Sytems Ltd.) they investigated three different building orientations and the effect of “ageing” (defined as moisture absorption) of samples stored in a non-desiccated environment for 43  days. The samples were found to be transversely isotropic (i.e. isotropic within a layer) as the position of samples within the <b>build</b> <b>chamber</b> greatly affected densification, which could be a result of temperature distribution. Sensitivity of material properties to slight changes in building parameters was also noted [64].|$|E
40|$|Description and {{biological}} {{aspects of a}} new species of Sigelgaita Heinrich, 1939, the first known to occur east of the Andes, S. cerei Becker, are presented. S. cerei larvae were collected on "restinga" ecosystems feeding on Pilosocereus arrabidae (Lem.) Byles & Rowl. (Parque Nacional da Restinga de Jurubatiba-Macaé and Área de Proteção Ambiental de Barra de Marica, Rio de Janeiro) and rarely on Cereus obtusus Haw. (PNRJ).

They <b>build</b> <b>chambers</b> in the cladodium where they complete their larval development, then droping {{to the ground in}} order to pupate. Trichogramma sp. was parasitizing 72 % of eggs and a species of braconid was parasitizing half out of ten larvae collected from fruits of Cereus obtusus. S. cerei larvae develop a special role in the colonization and establishment of a diverse fauna associates with the hosts such as insects, spiders and yeasts. Ants, such as Camponotus crassus Mayr, 1862 and C. cingulatus Mayr, 1862 are among the insects which most frequently nest in the chambers abandoned by the larvae of this moth species...|$|R
5000|$|Until 1885, all {{intending}} Irish barristers were {{obliged to}} [...] "keep terms" [...] {{in one of the}} English Inns of Court before being called to the Irish Bar and being entitled to practise as barristers in Ireland. Following on from these close historical links to the English Bar, for much of the nineteenth century it appeared that a system of barristers' chambers would develop in Ireland. Initially, the benchers of the King's Inns made plans to <b>build</b> <b>chambers</b> for Irish barristers, in the vicinity of Dublin's Henrietta Street. From about 1793, the benchers {{went so far as to}} decide to have chambers built, funded both by the King's Inns and by barristers who would lease building land from the benchers for their own chambers. Deposits were levied annually from new barristers and solicitors, and rules were even agreed by the benchers for the regulation of tenancies by Irish barristers in chambers. However, despite this levying of the profession, following practical objections raised by the architect James Gandon concerning the difficulty of building the main King's Inns building at the same time as private chambers, the barristers' chambers were never built, and the idea of chambers for Irish barristers has languished to the present day.|$|R

They feed on the starchy content of the wood as {{they are unable to}} digest cellulose. Young larvae chew their way along the grain of sapwood but older larvae may tunnel across the grain. They may come near to the surface but do not break through. When the larvae are ready to pupate, they <b>build</b> pupal <b>chambers</b> close to the surface.|$|R
30|$|Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) {{works by}} a CO 2 (10.6  µm) or Nd: YAG (1.06  µm) laser {{selectively}} sintering {{the contours of}} a cross section corresponding to the CAD model onto {{a thin layer of}} powder spread on the building platform. The laser sinters particles by heating them just enough for their surfaces to soften (melt) and fuse at the point of contact (unlike complete melting where the molten flow of the material can cause deformation). The powder in the <b>build</b> <b>chamber</b> is heated and kept to a temperature just below the glass transition temperature, to reduce thermal distortion and to aid fusion between layers. Un-sintered powder remains in place as support [26, 58]. The processes of sintering have been theoretically and computationally modelled based on current understanding of laser-matter interaction, and reviewed [59].|$|E
30|$|Eventually it {{was decided}} to go with the more {{expensive}} powder-based printing, using a ZCorp Z 310 Rapid Prototyping Printer. A powder-based 3 D printer works {{in much the same way}} as an inkjet printer. First, a layer of powder, in this case plaster of Paris, is laid down into the print bed. The approximate printing time on powder-based printers is 1  h per one-inch (2.54  cm) Z height. For example: A stack of ten one half inch thick parts will take around 5 - 5 - 1 / 2  h to print. One hour is needed for drying inside the machine, with another hour needed for the application of CA (cyanoacrylate glue). Since powder printers print in a matrix, the powder material acts as the support structure. This also gives the added advantage of allowing prints to be stacked on top of each other inside the <b>build</b> <b>chamber</b> with a minimum 1  mm separation.|$|E
40|$|Selective laser melting (SLM) is an {{additive}} manufacturing technique which enables fabrication of three dimensional objects by selectively melting successive layers of metallic powder. By utilizing a {{high energy density}} laser, complex geometries of even refractory metals like tungsten can be realized.

40|$|Build {{orientation}} {{is one of}} the most important process planning tasks in additive manufacturing (AM) since it directly affects the part quality, build time, cost etc. Many researchers have investigated the orientation optimization problem and proposed numerous solutions. However, former researches only focused on how to find an optimal orientation for one part, but none of the solutions was provided to solve the orientation optimization problem of Multi-part production, where a group of parts in the same build vat or chamber should be optimally-orientated simultaneously. This paper introduces a two-step solution to solve the problem. At first, a feature based method is used to generate a set of finite optimal alternative orientations for each part within a given part group to guarantee each part's individual build quality; then an improved genetic algorithm is applied to search for an optimal combination of part build orientations to minimize the total build time and cost at a global optimal level.
