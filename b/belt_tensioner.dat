50|$|In its 3.0 L form, this {{engine was}} notable for recalls of all units {{installed}} in Cadillac Cateras due to timing <b>belt</b> <b>tensioner</b> bearing failures, which could cause catastrophic {{damage to the}} engine because of its interference design.|$|E
50|$|Some {{machines}} now use {{a direct}} drive motor, a low aspect ratio device, where the stator assembly {{is attached to}} the rear of the outer drum, whilst the co-axial rotor is mounted on the shaft of the inner drum. Direct drive eliminates the need for a pulley, belt and <b>belt</b> <b>tensioner.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{serpentine}} belt, {{also known}} as a multi-vee, poly-v, or multi-rib belt, is a single, continuous belt used to drive multiple peripheral devices in an automotive engine, such as an alternator, power steering pump, water pump, air conditioning compressor, air pump, etc. The belt may also be guided by an idler pulley and/or a <b>belt</b> <b>tensioner</b> (which may be spring-loaded, hydraulic, or manual).|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Dynamic {{model of}} the moving <b>belt</b> system with <b>tensioner</b> pulley is studied in this paper. Belt is {{considered}} elastic continuous element, and pulley and tensioner arm are discrete element. Considering the geometrical nonlinearity and Kelvin viscoelastic constitutive model, the kinetic energy, potential energy and work done by external forces of moving <b>belt</b> system with <b>tensioner</b> pulley are given respectively. Then, the nonlinear equations of motion for the moving viscoelastic <b>belt</b> system with <b>tensioner</b> pulley are obtained by using the Hamilton’s principle. Note that nonlinear oscillations of the belt and pulley oscillations are coupled...|$|R
50|$|At introduction, {{the second}} {{generation}} featured front airbags as well as seat-mounted combination head/thorax side airbags along with the tridion cell, seat <b>belt</b> <b>tensioners,</b> anti-lock brakes, brake force distribution and electronic stability control. In the United States from model year 2012 onward, the Fortwo featured a total of eight dual-stage airbags in the Coupe—front, knee, side (thorax/pelvis) and window curtain—and {{a total of six}} dual-stage airbags in the Cabrio model—front, knee, side (thorax/head) dual-stage airbags. As a part of the vehicle's tridion cell and crash management system, the front crumple zone is maximized by the rear-mounted engine location.|$|R

50|$|Timing belts must be {{replaced}} at the manufacturer's recommended distance and/or time periods. Failure to replace the belt can result in complete breakdown or catastrophic engine failure, especially in interference engines. The owner's manual maintenance schedule {{is the source of}} timing belt replacement intervals, typically every 30,000 to 50,000 miles (50,000 to 80,000 km). It is common to replace the timing <b>belt</b> <b>tensioner</b> {{at the same time as}} the belt is replaced.|$|E
5000|$|Ignition was via a magneto, and {{the engine}} was started using bicycle-style pedals. Instead of a {{conventional}} clutch, a pulley <b>belt</b> <b>tensioner</b> could be moved, allowing the leather drive belt to slip. [...] Touting its effective muffler, Harley-Davidson advertised the 7D, and the other Harleys of this era, as [...] "The Silent Gray Fellow." [...] The latter moniker was also in reference to William S. Harley, who {{was known for his}} quiet personality. A 1911 Model 7D from the George Pardo collection was set to be auctioned in January 2014.|$|E
50|$|Engine {{timing was}} {{controlled}} by the all-steel, silent Morse timing chain (some early production engines had double-row roller timing sets), which was located beneath the aluminum timing cover {{at the front of}} the engine block. The timing chain sprockets, one each for the camshaft and crankshaft, were all-steel; for the last few years the LA engine came with nylon teeth on the sprockets. At the rear of the camshaft was cut a set of helical gear teeth, these being used to spin the distributor. Mounted to the front of the timing cover was a new-design counter-clockwise-rotation water pump, with much improved flow. Externally, the accessory drive belt was changed to a serpentine system; coupled with an automatic <b>belt</b> <b>tensioner</b> this increased belt life, reduced maintenance and contributed to lower noise and vibration levels.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} the modeling of the hysteretic behavior of <b>belt</b> <b>tensioners.</b> An initial experimental device is composed only of the tensioner by using forcing frequencies, preloads and deflection amplitudes. It permits {{the identification of the}} parameters of the restoring force model used. Comparison of the measured and predicted force deflection loops of the tensioner subjected to large deflections permits preliminary validation of the model. The second experimental device consists of a belt-tensioner system. Its non-linear modeling includes the above hysteretic model and the belt’s longitudinal characteristics. Validation of the belt-tensioner model is completed by comparing the measured and predicted belt tension. Finally, it is shown by using a parametric investigation and phase-plane portrait that the response of the belt-tensioner system increases with the frequency and the amplitude of the excitation...|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} Reitwagen {{was destroyed}} in the Cannstatt Fire that razed the Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft Seelberg-Cannstatt plant in 1903, but several replicas exist in collections at the Mercedes-Benz Museum in Stuttgart, the Deutsches Museum in Munich, the Honda Collection Hall at the Twin Ring Motegi facility in Japan, the AMA Motorcycle Hall of Fame in Ohio, and in Melbourne, Australia. The Deutsches Museum lent their replica to the Guggenheim Las Vegas The Art of the Motorcycle exhibition in 2001. The replicas vary as to which version they follow.

50|$|All of the 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engines have a {{timing belt}} made of rubber and cord. This belt must be {{replaced}} at 105,000 mi. These engines are interference engines, meaning that if the timing belt breaks or stretches, the pistons will hit the valves, resulting in an engine teardown, and a likely rebuild. Also, if this belt is replaced around 105,000 miles, {{it is a good}} idea to change the water pump, thermostat, <b>belt</b> <b>tensioner</b> and all the idler pulleys for this belt. The water pump and thermostat are behind this belt.In Australia for the Series II (MY06) cars, Subaru changed the recommended service interval for the timing belt replacement from 100,000 kilometers to 125,000 kilometers.The 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine in the first-generation Foresters featured head gaskets which were prone to premature failure. For 2003 and later, this issue was addressed with a revised, higher performing design, but is still an issue.|$|E
5000|$|It is more {{efficient}} than the older multiple belt system and may consume less space in the engine compartment. By using a single, wider belt instead of multiple, thinner belts, the belt may be put under increased tension without stretching. Higher tension reduces slip, which increases belt life and mechanical efficiency. Reduced slip can allow the use of lower-ratio pulleys; this reduces the load on the engine, increasing fuel economy and available power. The tendency for V-belts to [...] "flip over" [...] in the pulley groove (at high RPM and/or when the belt stretches) is eliminated, and a serpentine belt is also much easier to maintain and replace, {{since there is no}} need to remove multiple belts in order to replace one of them, although newer adjustable-length V-belts ("link belts") can be put on without having to remove other belts, and their link design also allows a self-tensioning characteristic to reduce the risk of flipping over. Also since only one movable <b>belt</b> <b>tensioner</b> is required all of the peripheral components (alternator, A/C compressor, etc.) can simply be mounted to the engine without the need to swivel.|$|E
5000|$|Pre-Safe Plus: {{offers an}} {{extension}} of the familiar occupant protection measures in situations where traffic behind poses a danger. A radar sensor in the rear bumper monitors the traffic behind the vehicle. If the risk of an impact from the rear is detected, the rear hazard warning lights are activated to alert the driver of the vehicle behind (not on vehicles with USA/Canada coding). Apart from this, the PRE-SAFE® anticipatory occupant protection measures, such as the reversible <b>belt</b> <b>tensioners,</b> are deployed. Plus, if the vehicle is stopped and the driver indicates a wish to remain stationary - by depressing the brake pedal, for example, activating the HOLD function or moving the selector lever to [...] "P" [...] - PRE-SAFE® PLUS will also come to the driver's aid by increasing the brake pressure {{in order to keep the}} vehicle firmly braked during a possible rear-end collision.|$|R
40|$|Modern cars {{exhibit a}} variety of new {{functionalities}} concerning engine management, safety, vehicle dynamics control as well as comfort and convenience. Safety features like airbags, antilock braking systems (ABS), anti-skid systems, <b>belt</b> <b>tensioners</b> or the electronic stability program (ESP) are standard fittings of present day car models and in some cases even stipulated by legislation. These safety systems have led to an increased avoidance of accidents by actively affecting vehicle dynamics and to a mitigation of the consequences of accidents on the driver and passengers by innovative restraint systems. As a rule these systems are mechatronic systems. Mechatronic systems today derive their functionality by an interlocked interaction of mechanics, electronics and information technology. Their deployment in the safety-relevant environment requires fault tolerance. Fault tolerant mechatronics is based on redundancy, which must be supervised and tested permanently. Reliability of sensor and actuator technology is essential for future motor vehicle systems. Operability and reliability are to be achieved by suitable on-board and on-line test methods. Exemplarily this is shown for future X-by-wire applications...|$|R
5000|$|It {{was decided}} to create a special {{building}} for this work of art. It is located just behind the museum, west of it, and was baptized {{in the name of}} Archaeothiki. After completion of the building the mosaic had to be removed from the [...] "Villa des Dionysos". In the fall of 2015, conservators, archaeologists and workers began this project. In {{order to be able to}} divide the mosaic into several parts, the position and shape of the individual mosaic stones were first recorded on the intended dividing lines. They were then removed. A special adhesive fabric and textile strips were applied to fix the remaining stones in their place. The mosaic was divided into several, transportable, plates. After that, these plates had to be separated from the underlying ground. At the edge, with long drills, close to each other, holes were drilled into the ground beneath the fixed object. With flat steel blades, which were cut into the holes at certain intervals, experts separated the mosaic from the ground. Then it was carefully raised to allow a suitable steel plate to be driven underneath. The Helpers covered the surface with a wooden plate. With several <b>belt</b> <b>tensioners,</b> the plates (steel plate and wooden plate) were fixed against each other so that no movement was possible during transportation. Via a ramp the parts, weighing up to 500 kg, reached a trailer and were transported to the Archaeothiki.|$|R
