The bulldozer kept moving, and she slipped and fell off the plow. But the bulldozer kept moving, the shovel above her. I guess it was about 10 or 15 meters that it dragged her {{and for some reason}} didn't stop. We shouted like crazy to the operator through loudspeakers that he should stop, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> kept going and didn't lift the shovel. Then it stopped and backed up. We ran to Rachel. She was still breathing.|$|E
25|$|For the 2001 season, McReynolds was {{replaced}} by Royce McGee. In 2001, Skinner suffered a concussion and a broken ankle in an opening-lap crash at the inaugural race at Chicagoland in July. Robby Gordon was named his replacement in the No. 31 car. Gordon struggled heavily, missing two races and failing to post a finish better than 25th in his first four starts for the team. During this time in August, Cingular Wireless (then the sponsor of Chip Ganassi Racing's No. 01 car) was announced as the new sponsor for 2002 signing a four-year deal, with Lowe's not renewing their contract and moving to Hendrick Motorsports. Skinner returned at Bristol, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> wasn't the same. Skinner {{was released from the}} final year of his contract in August, and left the team after Dover in September to have season-ending surgery. Gordon once again took his place at Kansas.|$|E
25|$|Regrettably {{there was}} jealousy between Rear Admiral Seivers and Gordon. Seivers {{had been born}} at Copenhagen and served the King of Denmark in his navy about the year 1708. Having been engaged by Peter the Great as captain, he was {{sometimes}} employed on board, sometimes in the yard, as Under-Equipage Master. He was reported {{as a man of}} excellent sense, general knowledge and very exact and methodical in his conduct. He was also able to speak and write most European tongues and was fluent in Russian. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> could not stand Thomas Gordon. Seivers refused to suffer Rear Admiral Gordon to be present at discussions upon the executions of any orders even when required by the Tsar. He felt that Peter the Great esteemed Gordon before him and indeed the Tsar appointed Gordon to take charge of a fleet over his head on the strength of his having been a British officer and trained in a better navy than Sievers had. Unlike Seivers, Gordon could not speak Russian but was fluent in Dutch.|$|E

500|$|Heath, who had {{acquired}} the nickname [...] "Lord Jeff", {{was called a}} [...] "problem child" [...] by Indian player-manager Lou Boudreau. Peckinpaugh once said that Heath [...] "could {{have been one of}} the greatest players. He had the ability to do about anything. He could run, he could throw, and he could hit. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> had no hustle, no nothing. If a ball went by him, he just might walk after it." [...] In December 1945 the Indians traded Heath to the Washington Senators where he started in right field.|$|E
500|$|The {{offensive}} line was frequently shuffled due to injuries, with left guard Matt Slauson playing some games at center and right guard Kyle Long moving to tackle. The former alternated between guard and center during the season, playing weeks seven to nine and sixteen at center. At left tackle, second-year player Charles Leno, Jr. started 13 games after taking over for an injured Jermon Bushrod; Gase stated, [...] "He {{had a little}} bit of a rough start, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> kept working and then when he got the opportunity at left tackle, he took full advantage of it." ...|$|E

We couldn't figure out why an American Airlines plane would be so low in downtown Manhattan. We sort of expected him to veer off and go into the Hudson. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> rose a little bit, his altitude, leveled off, and he was headed straight for the Trade Center. So just before he got to the Trade Center, it seemed as though he gained power. We were just watching this airplane on target for the World Trade Center. All of a sudden, boom!

500|$|... "Push the Button" [...] was conceptualised after {{group member}} Keisha Buchanan {{developed}} an infatuation with another artist who was collaborating with Austin. Buchanan told Jess Cartner-Morley of The Guardian {{that she made}} advances towards the man, but {{he was unaware of}} her intentions: [...] "I really liked this guy, so I'd be like, there's this good movie coming out, you know, dropping hints. And he'd be like, that movie sounds great, let me know what it's like if you go see it. I knew he liked me too <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> wasn't getting what I was trying to say." [...] Austin advised Buchanan to tell the man to [...] "push that button" [...] or she would eventually move on.|$|E
500|$|In a 1980 {{interview}} with Playboy magazine, John Lennon expressed his {{doubts about the}} notion of [...] "subconscious" [...] plagiarism, saying: [...] "He must have known, you know. He's smarter than that... He could have changed a couple of bars in that song and nobody could ever have touched him, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> let it go and paid the price. Maybe he thought God would just sort of let him off." [...] Ringo Starr's reaction was more charitable: [...] "There's {{no doubt that the}} tune is similar but how many songs have been written with other melodies in mind? George's version is much heavier than The Chiffons – he might have done it with the original {{in the back of his}} mind, but he's just very unlucky that someone wanted to make it a test case in court." ...|$|E
500|$|In February 2011, McGregor {{announced}} his departure from Neighbours and a Herald Sun reporter {{stated that he}} would film his final scenes in April. On screen, his character was seen exposing corruption within the local police force and then receiving threats from some of his colleagues. McGregor later explained to a Press Association reporter that Mark's exit storyline {{would not be a}} happy one, as he is forced out of Ramsay Street. Mark is asked to enter a witness protection program and the night before he leaves, he realises he is still in love with his ex-girlfriend, Kate (Brewer). McGregor told Sarah Ellis of Inside Soap [...] "He hasn't been able to tell Kate that he's leaving before now – <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> can't say goodbye, and asks her to come along with him.

500|$|Most of the {{original}} first-person shooter elements were removed by the third revision of the game, which incorporated a more spy-oriented style of gameplay, with the player [...] "trying to quietly take out enemies and not be seen." [...] Chung commented that he reworked the game several more times to fit his vision: [...] "It kept on just changing and changing and changing until it got into a more story-oriented direction." [...] He stated {{that he did not}} feel comfortable developing Gravity Bone as a first-person shooter game, and kept adding [...] "bits and bits of more and more unconventional" [...] elements as a result. He explained that he [...] "got stuck on this idea of the hero never fires a gun, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> has a bunch of tools on his belt, like a power drill or a can of pressurized Freon, a screwdriver. I thought that was kind of funny and interesting." ...|$|E
500|$|Plans {{were made}} for Paynter to run {{additional}} races before the Breeders' Cup Classic in the fall. [...] His next race was the San Diego Handicap at Del Mar on July 27, 2013. Shortly after his arrival at Del Mar racetrack in early July, Paynter was profiled on TV, showing that his usual temperament was back to normal, as the camera showed him attempting to nip Baffert. [...] Running {{for the first time}} on a different synthetic surface, Polytrack, in the grade 2 race, Paynter was the 3–5 favorite, and at 122 pounds carried the most weight. [...] After running close to the [...] pace and taking the lead in the homestretch, he lost by a half-length to a late-running horse, Kettle Corn, at the finish. Jockey Bejarano believed the polytrack surface was a factor in his loss. [...] "He never seemed comfortable out there, I felt like I had plenty of horse, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> wasn't liking what he was doing... he didn't have enough at the end." [...] Nonetheless, purse money for his placing put him over one million dollars in lifetime winnings.|$|E
500|$|Broderick and Hughes {{stayed in}} touch for a while after production. [...] "We thought about a sequel to Ferris Bueller, where he'd be in college or at his first job, and {{the same kind of}} things would happen again. But neither of us found a very {{exciting}} hook to that. The movie is about a singular time in your life." [...] "Ferris Bueller is about the week before you leave school, it's about the end of school—in some way, it doesn't have a sequel. It's a little moment and it's a lightning flash in your life. I mean, you could try to repeat it in college or something but it's a time that you don't keep. So that's partly why I think we couldn't think of another", Broderick added. [...] "But just for fun", said Ruck, [...] "I used to think why don't they wait until Matthew and I are in our seventies and do Ferris Bueller Returns and have Cameron be in a nursing home. He doesn't really need to be there, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> decided his life is over, so he committed himself to a nursing home. And Ferris comes and breaks him out. And they go to, like, a titty bar and all this ridiculous stuff happens. And then, {{at the end of the}} movie, Cameron dies." ...|$|E

500|$|The video {{begins with}} a footage of Usher walking offstage during a show part of his OMG Tour (2010—11), held at the O2 Arena, Berlin in January 2011. Subsequently, {{announcer}} explains, [...] "He tried because he loves Berlin and {{he really wanted to}} give you guys a show, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> couldn’t do it. Thanks for understanding." [...] Usher then speaks with a remorse, [...] "I felt like a failure, hopeless, paralyzed, numb." [...] As the song starts Usher is seen chanting the lyrics while several sequence shots of him with his son and a sick woman in hospital are shown. The scenes are intercuted by Usher performing in a room full with bright white lights. Several other short scenes of Usher taking care of the sick woman, his son having a meal and Usher throwing money at strippers are shown. Several natural environments are projected onto a wall the singer stands in front off. As the song progresses, he enters in a glass box and starts dancing during the chorus. Scenes of Usher having toast with his friends, smoking a cigar and watching strippers performing lap-dance for him are shown. The singer is shown holding man's hand while he dies in a hospital. Then, he is seen unable to perform and cries in front of the microphone. The video ends with Usher managing to break the glass box.|$|E
500|$|Concerning the {{recording}} of the album's opening song [...] "N.Y. State of Mind", producer DJ Premier later stated [...] "Nas — he's one of our saviors now. When we did ‘N.Y. State of Mind,’ at the beginning when he says, ‘Straight out the dungeons of rap / Where fake niggas don’t make it back,’ then you hear him say, ‘I don’t know how to start this shit,’ ’cause he had just written it. He's got the beat running in the studio, but he doesn’t know how he's going to format how he's going to convey it. So he's going, ‘I don’t know how to start this shit,’ and I’m counting him in [...] One, two, three. And then you can hear him go, ‘Yo,’ and then he goes right into it." [...] DJ Premier later discussed the unexpectedness of Nas's delivery during {{the recording}}, stating [...] "He didn’t know how he was gonna come in, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> started going because we were recording. I’m actually yelling, ‘We’re recording!’ and banging on the [...] window. ‘Come on, get ready!’ You hear him start the shit: Rappers…. And then everyone in the studio was like, ‘Oh, my God’, ’cause it was so unexpected. He was not ready. So we used that first verse. And {{that was when he}} was up and coming, his first album. So we was like, 'Yo, this guy is gonna be big.'" ...|$|E

500|$|His final race of 2016 was the Winter Challenge Stakes at Los Alamitos, {{the only}} time the horse had ever run at the track that had been his home {{training}} base. [...] In a race of a mile and a sixteenth against light competition, where he was as much as 6 horses wide, he won easily by 12 lengths and set a track record. The final race of his career was the Pegasus World Cup on January 28, 2017, where he drew the far outside post and ran a surprisingly poor race, was eased in the stretch, and finished ninth, well behind the winner, Arrogate. Arrogate's jockey, Mike Smith, commented, [...] "Chrome just didn't fire his race today at all." [...] Sherman commented [...] "This was the first bad race he has run for me." [...] The horse had fluid on his right knee after the race, and although the injury did not appear serious, Sherman theorized about the cause: [...] "It looks like he scrambled away from there and couldn't get his footing." [...] Arrogate's trainer, Bob Baffert, was also disappointed: [...] "I kept waiting for the matchup with Chrome, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> didn't bring his race today. It's too bad." [...] X-rays taken after the race showed no bone injury, but California Chrome was a bit [...] "off" [...] in his gait. [...] Frank Taylor explained that no one knew what exactly happened, [...] "We don't know if he just wrenched it or strained it, but it had a little filling, fluid and heat in it." [...] An equine chiropractor got a small [...] "pop" [...] when he stretched out the horse's leg. Clinical signs of injury went down, and he was shipped to Taylor Made Farm the next day, Sunday. By Monday he was allowed to go out and exercise in a paddock.|$|E
