5|$|Uncovered {{interest}} rate parity asserts that an investor with dollar deposits will earn the {{interest rate}} available on dollar deposits, while an investor holding euro deposits will earn {{the interest rate}} available in the eurozone, but also a potential gain or loss on euros depending on the rate of appreciation or depreciation of the euro against the dollar. Economists have extrapolated a useful approximation of uncovered interest rate parity that follows intuitively from these assumptions. If uncovered interest rate parity holds, such that an investor is indifferent between dollar versus euro deposits, then any excess return on euro deposits must <b>be</b> <b>offset</b> <b>by</b> some expected loss from depreciation of the euro against the dollar. Conversely, some shortfall in return on euro deposits must <b>be</b> <b>offset</b> <b>by</b> some expected gain from appreciation of the euro against the dollar. The following equation represents the uncovered interest rate parity approximation.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{acquisition}} project organisers originally {{planned for the}} first submarine to be constructed overseas, the Cabinet decided {{as part of the}} project's approval that all six submarines would be built in Australia; the increases in construction time and cost from not building the lead ship in the winning designer's home shipyard was considered to <b>be</b> <b>offset</b> <b>by</b> the additional experience provided to Australian industries. Even so, two sections of the first submarine were constructed by Kockums' shipyard in Malmo, Sweden.|$|E
5|$|In many {{developing}} countries, the ketogenic diet is expensive because dairy fats and meat {{are more expensive}} than grain, fruit and vegetables. The modified Atkins diet has been proposed as a lower-cost alternative for those countries; the slightly more expensive food bill can <b>be</b> <b>offset</b> <b>by</b> a reduction in pharmaceutical costs if the diet is successful. The modified Atkins diet is less complex to explain and prepare and requires less support from a dietitian.|$|E

40|$|The 2013 Fundraising Effectivenes Project Report {{summarizes}} {{data from}} 2, 840 survey respondents covering year-to-year fundraising results for 2011 - 2012. The report shows that: Gains of $ 769 million in gifts from new, upgraded current, and previously lapsed donors <b>were</b> <b>offset</b> <b>by</b> losses of $ 735 million through reduced gifts and lapsed donors. This means that, {{while there was}} a positive $ 34 million net growth-in-giving, every $ 100 gained in 2012 <b>was</b> <b>offset</b> <b>by</b> $ 96 in losses through gift attrition. That is, 96 percent of gains in giving <b>were</b> <b>offset</b> <b>by</b> losses in giving. Gains of $ 866, 000 in new and previously lapsed donors <b>were</b> <b>offset</b> <b>by</b> losses of 909, 000 in lapsed donors. This means {{that there was a}} negative (44, 000) growth-in-donors and every 100 donors gained in 2012 <b>was</b> <b>offset</b> <b>by</b> 105 in lost donors through attrition. That is, 105 percent of the donors gained <b>were</b> <b>offset</b> <b>by</b> lapsed donors. Growth-in-giving performance varies significantly according to organization size (based on total amount raised), with larger organizations performing much better than smaller ones. The largest growth in gift dollars/donors came from new gifts/donors, and the pattern was most pronounced in the organizations with the highest growth-in-giving ratios. The greatest losses in gift dollars came from lapsed new gifts, particularly in the organizations with the lowest and highest growth-on-giving ratios. the greatest losses in donors came from lapsed new donors in all growth-in-giving categories...|$|R

5|$|In {{the middle}} of June, City Council Speaker Gifford Miller visited the zoo, and {{in a press conference}} {{outlined}} some of the pragmatic consequences of closure: a savings estimated by the city of $6 million for both facilities that would <b>be</b> <b>offset</b> <b>by</b> a WCS estimated expenditure of $8 million, to decommission facilities and — on short notice — find homes for 160 displaced animals. If the estimates were correct, reasoning went, it would be cheaper to run the zoos than to shut them down.|$|E
5|$|He {{also promised}} to seek income tax law changes {{that he said}} would help to lower federal deficits and would stimulate {{economic}} growth. These included: reducing individual income tax rates across the board by 20percent, maintaining the Bush administration-era tax rate of 15percent on investment income from dividends and capital gains (and eliminating this tax entirely for those with annual incomes less than $200,000), cutting the top tax rate on corporations from 35 to 25percent, and eliminating the estate tax and the Alternative Minimum Tax. He promised {{that the loss of}} government revenue from these tax cuts would <b>be</b> <b>offset</b> <b>by</b> closing loopholes and placing limits on tax deductions and credits available to taxpayers with the highest incomes, but said that that aspect of the plan could not yet be evaluated because details would have to be worked out with Congress.|$|E
5|$|The {{antibiotic}} rifaximin may be {{recommended in}} addition to lactulose for those with recurrent disease. It is a nonabsorbable antibiotic from the rifamycin class. This is thought {{to work in a}} similar way to other antibiotics, but without the complications attached to neomycin or metronidazole. Due to the long history and lower cost of lactulose use, rifaximin is generally only used as a second-line treatment if lactulose is poorly tolerated or not effective. When rifaximin is added to lactulose, the combination of the two may be more effective than each component separately. Rifaximin is more expensive than lactulose, but the cost may <b>be</b> <b>offset</b> <b>by</b> reduced hospital admissions for encephalopathy.|$|E

5|$|Independent twin sets or {{independent}} doubles {{consists of two}} independent cylinders and two regulators, each with a submersible pressure gauge. This system is heavier, more expensive to buy and maintain and more expensive to fill than a single cylinder set. The diver must swap demand valves during the dive to preserve a sufficient reserve of gas in each cylinder. If this is not done, then if a cylinder should fail the diver may end up having an inadequate reserve. Independent twin sets do not work well with air-integrated computers as they usually only monitor one cylinder. The complexity of switching regulators periodically to ensure both cylinders are evenly used may <b>be</b> <b>offset</b> <b>by</b> the redundancy of two entirely separate breathing gas supplies. The cylinders may be mounted as a twin set on the diver's back, or alternatively can be carried in a sidemount configuration where penetration of wrecks or caves requires it, and where the cylinder valves are in easy reach.|$|E
5|$|Nitrogen {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} elements in organic chemistry. Many organic functional groups involve a carbon–nitrogen bond, such as amides (RCONR2), amines (R3N), imines (RC(=NR)R), imides (RCO)2NR, azides (RN3), azo compounds (RN2R), cyanates and isocyanates (ROCN or RCNO), nitrates (RONO2), nitriles and isonitriles (RCN or RNC), nitrites (RONO), nitro compounds (RNO2), nitroso compounds (RNO), oximes (RCR=NOH), and pyridine derivatives. C–N bonds are strongly polarised towards nitrogen. In these compounds, nitrogen is usually trivalent (though it can be tetravalent in quaternary ammonium salts, R4N+), with a lone pair that can confer basicity on the compound by being coordinated to a proton. This may <b>be</b> <b>offset</b> <b>by</b> other factors: for example, amides are not basic because the lone pair is delocalised into a double bond (though they may act as acids at very low pH, being protonated at the oxygen), and pyrrole is not acidic because the lone pair is delocalised as part of an aromatic ring. The amount of nitrogen in a chemical substance can be determined by the Kjeldahl method. In particular, nitrogen is an essential component of nucleic acids, amino acids and thus proteins, and the energy-carrying molecule adenosine triphosphate and is thus vital to all life on Earth.|$|E
