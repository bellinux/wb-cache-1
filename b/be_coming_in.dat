500|$|In July 2008, Neighbours was branded [...] "too white" [...] {{by black}} and Asian viewers in Britain. A {{report found that}} many ethnic viewers felt they were {{under-represented}} in some of Britain's most popular television shows. In Australia {{there was talk of}} a 'White Australia policy' when it came to casting actors for top-rated soaps. In response to the criticism, executive producer Susan Bower made the decision to add more ethnically diverse extras, small walk on roles and speaking parts. She also decided to introduce 15-year-old Korean actor Hany Lee into the cast as exchange student, Sunny Lee. Bower said [...] "I know we're going to get flak about this gorgeous little Korean girl who's going to <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> next year, because you're damned if you do and damned if you don't".|$|E

Kojima said: [...] "I think we'll {{probably have to}} make it [...] at some point, but what that will be, we have no idea." [...] Kojima stated that when Konami does get around to building the game, he will have less influence than he had on previous iterations in the series.

2500|$|The {{author has}} stated that she enjoys writing Dumbledore because he [...] "is the epitome of goodness." [...] Rowling said that Dumbledore speaks for her, as he [...] "knows pretty much everything" [...] about the Harry Potter universe. Rowling {{mentioned}} that Dumbledore regrets [...] "that he has always {{had to be the}} one who knew, and who had the burden of knowing. And he would rather not know." [...] As a mentor to the central character Harry Potter, [...] "Dumbledore is a very wise man who knows that Harry is going to have to learn a few hard lessons to prepare him for what may <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> his life. He allows Harry to get into what he wouldn't allow another pupil to do, and he also unwillingly permits Harry to confront things he’d rather protect him from." [...] In a 1999 interview, Rowling stated that she imagined Dumbledore [...] "more as a John Gielgud type, you know, quite elderly and– and quite stately." [...] During his time as a student, Dumbledore was in Gryffindor House. Rowling said in an interview that Dumbledore was about 150 years old. However, on her website, she states that Dumbledore was born in 1881, making him either 115 or 116 when he died.|$|E
2500|$|The {{developers}} {{stated that}} they listened to fan responses from the first game and implemented those ideas into the sequel. [...] "We have been listening to our fans and building the pinball game that they envisioned," [...] stated Kigyossy. [...] "It took {{a little longer than}} expected, but we have designed a game that unifies the online community, and takes all the social features to the next level." [...] The game was made available free of charge and gives players the ability to try any table for a limited time. [...] Players can then elect to download Pinball FX 2 Core which unlocks full versions of the Pinball FX 2 tables. [...] Owners of the original Pinball FX can import their existing tables, then selectively choose which of the new tables they want to download. [...] Players who do not own Pinball FX can purchase the Pinball FX Classic pack, which contains the three original tables along with the free downloadable table from the original game. [...] Kigyossy hinted that some of the exclusive tables from Zen Pinball would <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> the future to Pinball FX 2, which was realized when the Mars table was released on April 20, 2011. Zen Studios announced on February 29, 2012 that the game would be available for free along with the Sorcerer's Lair table for Windows 8 users, with the additional tables available as premium downloadable content. It was released on the new OS for download from the Windows Store on October 27, 2012, although the Mars table was provided for free instead.|$|E
