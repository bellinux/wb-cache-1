500|$|During the {{rehearsal}} for that evening, Julie and Steve {{learn that the}} town sheriff is coming to arrest them. Steve takes out a large pocket knife and makes a cut on the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> sucking the blood and swallowing it. Pete returns with the sheriff, who insists that the show cannot proceed, because Julie is a mulatto woman married to a white man, and local laws prohibit such miscegenation. Julie admits {{that her mother was}} black, but Steve tells the sheriff that he also has [...] "black blood" [...] in him, so their marriage is legal in Mississippi. The troupe backs him up, boosted by the ship's pilot Windy McClain, a longtime friend of the sheriff. The couple have escaped the charge of miscegenation, but they still have to leave the show boat; identified as black, they can no longer perform for the segregated white audience. Cap'n Andy fires Pete, but in spite of his sympathy for Julie and Steve, he cannot violate the law for them.|$|E
2500|$|Springfield {{was raised}} in a music-loving family. Her father would tap out rhythms on the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> and {{encourage}} her to guess the musical piece. She listened {{to a wide range of}} music, including George Gershwin, Rodgers and Hart, Rodgers and Hammerstein, Cole Porter, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, and Glenn Miller. A fan of American jazz and the vocalists Peggy Lee and Jo Stafford, she wished to sound like them. At the age of twelve, she made a recording of herself performing the Irving Berlin song [...] "When the Midnight Choo Choo Leaves for Alabam" [...] at a local record shop in Ealing.|$|E
60|$|Barbara ceased her weeping, {{wiped her}} eyes with the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> {{and looked up at}} him.|$|E
50|$|As Red Queen, {{she uses}} {{implanted}} bio-wings to fly. Also, she has bio-electric blasters {{installed on the}} gloves on the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands,</b> and extendable claws built into her gloves. However, she apparently {{does not have the}} ability to alter her size.|$|R
60|$|The younger lady {{looked down}} on her {{companion}} with something of the calm expert attention that a plumber gives to a tap that is misbehaving, and like a plumber refrained from precipitate action. She stood with the <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> resting on <b>her</b> hips.|$|R
60|$|Her low-cut {{dress was}} of yew-green, with, little threads <b>of</b> flame-colour, {{matching}} <b>her</b> hair, {{so that there}} was about <b>her</b> a splendour <b>of</b> darkness and whiteness and gold, almost dazzling; and she stood very still, leaning back against the lighter green of the billiard-table, grasping its edge so tightly that the smooth strong <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> quivered.|$|R
60|$|With the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> Thyme {{rubbed off}} the kiss. The two cousins walked out amongst the traffic.|$|E
60|$|And {{he looked}} with such deferential and shining eyes at his {{companion}} that {{she placed the}} <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> before her mouth, and her breast rose.|$|E
6000|$|She put her {{forehead}} {{down on the}} <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> and laughed again. [...] "You ought to be photographed. You look {{as if you were}} sitting for it." ...|$|E
6000|$|She turns away, shuddering, {{and sits}} {{down on the edge of}} the [...] armchair, {{covering}} her eyes with the <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands.</b> MALISE [...] picks up the stick, and fingers it lovingly. Then putting it [...] down, he moves so that he can see her face. She is sitting [...] quite still, staring straight before her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Husband!" [...] she cried, {{and held}} out her slender arms to me. I was {{compelled}} {{to go to her}} and kiss her, and she twined them softly about my neck and drew me to her and kissed me. I disentangled them very gently, and took each wrist and kissed it, and the <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands.</b>|$|R
60|$|But to {{have got}} there at last {{was a great}} comfort, {{especially}} as there were lights still burning in the office window, and therefore some hope {{that she was not}} too late. So the Marchioness dried her eyes with the <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands,</b> and, stealing softly up the steps, peeped in through the glass door.|$|R
6000|$|... "Shut up, Jesse!" [...] {{my mother}} cried, landing the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> stingingly on my mouth. And then, to the stranger, [...] "Go away {{and let the}} boy alone." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{raised her}} head from her arms and dried her eyes with the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> like a child. A kinder note than he had {{intended}} went into his voice.|$|E
60|$|She was {{watching}} {{him all the time}} with her dark, dilated, inchoate eyes. She leaned forward and swung round her arm, catching him a light blow on the face with the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|E
60|$|Mary {{turned the}} <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> father's <b>hand</b> to <b>her</b> lips {{and smiled at}} him.|$|R
60|$|But Miss Ledrook wouldn't come to Miss Snevellicci, so Miss Snevellicci {{was obliged}} to go to Miss Ledrook, which she did, in a {{skipping}} manner that was quite fascinating; and Miss Ledrook evidently joked Miss Snevellicci about being struck with Nicholas; for, after some playful whispering, Miss Snevellicci hit Miss Ledrook very hard on the <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands,</b> and retired up, {{in a state of}} pleasing confusion.|$|R
6000|$|... "I mean," [...] said Miss Mackinnon, {{striking}} {{her hips}} with the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> smartly, and accenting each word that dropped like a bullet {{from her mouth}} with an additional blow,--"I--mean--that--your--wife--had one--of--her--old--hangers-on--from--'Frisco--here--in--this very--kitchen--all--the--arternoon; there! I mean that whiles she was waitin' here for you, she was canoodlin' and cryin' over old times with him! I saw her myself through the winder. That's what I mean, Mr. Joshua Rylands." ...|$|R
6000|$|In the {{presence}} of old Angus Craig and young Johnson they were married, and when the minister gave Mrs. Bidwell a rousing smack she wiped her lips with the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> and said to Bidwell: ...|$|E
6000|$|Lady Davenant got {{up again}} and went to her; drawing off her glove she felt her cheek with the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b> 'You are ill, {{you are in a}} fever. I'm sure that {{whatever}} you said it was very charming.' ...|$|E
60|$|Her father, {{his thumbs}} in the armholes of his {{waistcoat}} {{and his legs}} far apart, {{looked at her in}} blank and speechless amazement; her mother, with more consideration but equal lack of sympathy, patted her gently on the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|E
40|$|Churgâ€“Strauss {{syndrome}} {{associated with}} montelukast therapy Sir, A 47 -year-old {{woman had a}} 4 -year history of severe asthma. Because asthma continued to deteriorate, montelukast therapy was instituted in April 2007. On September 2007, the patient presented with painful cutaneous manifestations of 1 -month dura-tion that had progressively developed, involving <b>her</b> elbows and <b>hands.</b> On admission, the patient was febrile (388 C). Physical examination revealed diffuse sibilant rales, bilaterally. Cutaneous examination demonstrated skin nodules involving her elbows and the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> (Figure 1). The patien...|$|R
6000|$|... "God {{will help}} us," [...] said Hetty, sitting {{down on the}} floor and gently {{stroking}} the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> mother's <b>hand,</b> [...] "for He sent the trouble, and will hear us when we cry to Him." ...|$|R
60|$|So saying, Mrs Nickleby {{nodded her}} head, and patted the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> daughter's <b>hand,</b> {{a great many}} times, and {{looked as if she}} could tell {{something}} vastly important if she chose, but had self-denial, thank Heaven; and wouldn't do it.|$|R
60|$|VIVIE [unmoved] Be quiet. Some {{one will}} answer the bell. [Without flinching a step she strikes the bell with the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b> It clangs harshly; {{and he starts}} back involuntarily. Almost {{immediately}} Frank appears at the porch with his rifle].|$|E
60|$|Miss Carver now {{stopped her}} work, and looked from her friend, {{with her head}} bowed in {{laughter}} on the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> to that of Berry bent in burlesque reproach upon her, and then at Lemuel, {{who was trying to}} control himself.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{come home}} with pleasure," [...] Rochester interrupted. [...] "Don't look so scared," [...] he added, patting the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> gently. [...] "You know very well, {{if there is any}} little trouble, I shall be delighted to help you out." ...|$|E
60|$|Louis' {{face was}} {{puckered}} up with anxiety. He saw, too, what I had seen. Bartot had {{walked to the}} other end of the room to speak to some friends. The girl had taken a gold and jewelled pencil from the mass of costly trifles which lay with her purse upon the table, and was writing on a piece of paper which the waiter had brought. I could see her delicately manicured fingers, the blue veins at the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands,</b> as she wrote, slowly and apparently without hesitation. Both Louis and myself watched the writing of that note as though Fate itself were guiding the pencil.|$|R
6000|$|While thus discoursing he had unbuckled {{his empty}} scabbard. He sent it flying under the bed, and, {{lowering}} {{the point of}} the sword, brushed past the perplexed Lieut. D'Hubert, exclaiming, [...] "Follow me!" [...] Directly he had flung open the door a faint shriek was heard and the pretty maid, who had been listening at the keyhole, staggered away, putting the <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> over <b>her</b> eyes. Feraud did not seem to see her, but she ran after him and seized his left arm. He shook her off, and then she rushed towards Lieut. D'Hubert and clawed at the sleeve of his uniform.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Oh, you brave man! God bless you!' He stooped {{suddenly}} and impulsively kissed the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> lightly and was gone. For a fleeting {{moment she was}} angry. No man had kissed her hand before; {{but the thought of}} his liberty was swept away by another: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said she, [...] "but I've {{had pretty}} hard times since I left home, Hi." [...] The tears sprang {{to her eyes}} at the {{recollection}} of her troubles, but she only wiped them hastily away with the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> without stopping in her eating.|$|E
60|$|Then he {{took out}} the roll of tobacco, took a whiff, and gave the old woman some snuff on the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b> Then she was so delighted that she began to dance, and the man got leave to stay all night. It {{was not long before}} he began to ask about Farmer Weatherbeard.|$|E
6000|$|At length [...] "Wilbur" [...] said: [...] "Good-night." [...] I rose, and Miller, eagerly, expectantly, {{turned the}} light slowly on. Mrs. Smiley sat {{precisely}} {{as we had}} last seen her. Her eyes were closed, her head leaning against the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> chair. <b>Her</b> <b>hands</b> were fastened exactly as we had left them, and, strangest thing of all, the table was pushed away from her so that the silk threads were tight.|$|R
50|$|Rinslet {{enters the}} Blade Dance with the wish for the Water Lord to forgive her sister Judia {{and break the}} eternal ice curse cast upon her for what {{was thought to be}} a mistake during a kagura dance to the Water Lord. Similar to Ellis she gets a boost to her divine power after kissing Kamito in Volume 13. Position in team is that <b>of</b> Sniper/Support as <b>her</b> Ice Magic and Bow attacks are best suited for mid/long range battle while {{extremely}} disadvantageous at close melee range. Contract symbol is on <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> right <b>hand</b> and resembles a white/blue complex snowflake with two sides cropped off by the edge of the symbol. While trying to save a spirit after the Blade Dance she gets another contract symbol on the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> left <b>hand</b> that looks like a white/blue ice rose.|$|R
6000|$|Then {{she looked}} at the <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> which she could not see because of the {{gathering}} darkness, and as they were invisible, kissed them instead, just as though they belonged to someone else. After this she sat a while brooding and listening to the pulsing <b>of</b> <b>her</b> heart, which was beating with unusual strength this night. As she did so in that mysterious hour which sometimes comes to us in English summers, a great change fell upon her. When she sat down upon that fallen tree she was still a girl and virginal; when she rose from it she was a developed, loving woman. It was as though a spirit had visited her and whispered in her ear. She could almost hear the words. They were: ...|$|R
