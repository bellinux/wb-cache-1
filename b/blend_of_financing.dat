" The theme of entrepreneurial philanthropy focused largely on the practices of venture philanthropy and impact investing organisations [...] institutionalised funds that offer a <b>blend</b> <b>of</b> <b>finance</b> and advisory services to social entrepreneurs in support of their ambitions to strengthen their organisations and grow social impact. We were intrigued by a variant of venture philanthropy whereby individuals pooled their resources and together selected {{a small number of}} non-profit organisations to support with grants and advice.

In the next chapter we will look at how research evidence from North America supports a dual objective for the giving circle methodology [...] to provide resources for non-profits; and to educate and motivate donors. Giving circles can provide a learning experience for people who want to better understand philanthropy, such as how to create social value by donating their money and skills in a socialised context. When philanthropy is described as a journey that individuals embark upon throughout life, it is not simply about giving more money over time. Giving should be made more intelligently and strategically; it can involve leveraging non-financial resources; and it understands and measures the impact created. Collaborating with others on the philanthropy journey holds the potential to make giving a more impactful and personally fulfilling experience. Giving circles make it easier for individuals to enter into larger scale and more sophisticated philanthropy and share the risks and rewards with others. ...|$|R
5000|$|Blended finance {{is defined}} [...] "as the {{strategic}} use <b>of</b> development <b>finance</b> and philanthropic funds to mobilize private capital flows to emerging and frontier markets", resulting in positive results for both investors and communities. Blended finance offers {{the possibility to}} scale up commercial financing for developing countries and to channel such financing toward investments with development impact. As such, Blended finance is designed to support progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set forth by the United Nations. Meeting the SDGs will require an additional $2.5 trillion per year, and an additional $13.5 trillion to implement the COP21 Paris climate accord. The concept <b>of</b> <b>blended</b> <b>finance</b> was first recognized {{as a solution to}} the funding gap in the outcome document of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development in July 2015 ...|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates whether <b>blends</b> <b>of</b> {{platinum}} ores display linear grinding and flotation characteristics {{or whether}} non-linear effects occur, i. e. synergistic/antagonistic effects. Ores from four different shafts {{are used in}} the study, i. e. Salene, Waterval UG 2, Paardekraal and Townlands. Laboratory grinding and flotation tests are conducted on <b>blends</b> <b>of</b> the four ores using a statistical simplex lattice mixture design. Grinding results show no evidence that <b>blends</b> <b>of</b> ores display non-linear grinding characteristics. Flotation results show significant antagonistic effects in binary <b>blends</b> <b>of</b> the Salene ore with the other ore types. On the other hand, ternary/quaternary <b>blends</b> <b>of</b> ores result in synergistic effects. The study concludes that <b>blends</b> <b>of</b> platinum ores display non-linear (non-additive) characteristics when there are large differences in metallurgical properties between the ore types. The study demonstrates that appropriately designed mixtures experiments are an effective way to study the performance <b>of</b> ore <b>blends</b> in the laboratory...|$|R

40|$|The venture philanthropy (VP) model {{provides}} a <b>blend</b> <b>of</b> performance-based development <b>finance</b> and professional services to social purpose organisations (SPOs) – helping them expand their social impact. This is a high-engagement, partnership approach {{analogous to the}} practices of venture capital in building the commercial value of companies. Its focus on building organisational capacity in entrepreneurial social purpose organisations, matching appropriate finance with strategic business-like advice, makes it a distinctive provider of capital. The first working paper in this series explored the origins of VP and its development and expansion in Europe. Interest in VP models has grown rapidly in Europe since 2002, initially in the UK and Ireland, but today VP funds can be found across continental Europe including the Baltic States and central & eastern Europe. In Europe VP has strong links to the private equity and venture capital industry, {{due in part to}} the European Venture Philanthropy Association, a VP peer network founded by philanthropists from the private equity community. VP in Europe is generally well networked and markets itself as complementary to the more traditional philanthropic models of foundations and governmental funders. This working paper examines the so-called ‘value add’ of VP – the advisory services provided to SPOs together with financial support. By surveying European VP organisations we explore what these advisory services are and how they are delivered, and the level of engagement with the organisation being supported. We have asked social entrepreneurs receiving VP support what they value most about value-added services and how they view a level of engagement not usually associated with social sector funders...|$|R
30|$|In LP, cotton {{yields of}} all 30 genotypes were {{significantly}} lower than its counterpart in NP (Table  3). Late planting stress reduced SCY, LCY, bolls/P, L%, SI, and LI by 20.4, 23.1, 18.9, 3.3, 4.4, and 11.5, respectively. The largest reductions in LCY due to the stress of LP were observed for the inbreds (33.2 %) and hybrids (47.8 %), whereas the lowest reductions were detected in <b>blend</b> <b>of</b> hybrids (15.1 %). This was reflected in higher sensitively stress indices for inbreds (SSI[*]=[*] 1.1 or susceptible) and hybrids (SSI[*]=[*] 2.0 or susceptible). However, reductions for <b>blend</b> <b>of</b> inbreds (−[*] 12.9 %) superior in LP than NP (SSI[*]=[*]−[*] 0.6 or high stress tolerant) and <b>blend</b> <b>of</b> hybrids (15.1 %) superior in LP than NP (SSI[*]=[*] 0.4 or high stress tolerant).

40|$|Six {{different}} <b>blends</b> <b>of</b> zinc calcium phosphorous oxide ceramics (ZCAP) {{were prepared}} by mixing and calcining powders (ZnO:CaO:P 2 O 5) of weight percent ratio: 50 : 30 : 20, 48 : 32 : 20, 44 : 20 : 26, 40 : 40 : 20, 30 : 40 : 30, and 30 : 30 : 40. ZCAP is a resorbable bioceramic {{and has been}} used to repair bone defects and deliver drugs in a continuous manner. The chemical composition, porosity, and elements released on exposure to buffered Tris HCl were measured for each <b>blend</b> <b>of</b> ZCAP. The products of mixing and thermal reaction were beta-Ca 3 (PO 4) 2, alpha-CaZn 2 (PO 4) 2, and 2 CaO. P 2 O 5. Free calcium and/or zinc oxide was present in several <b>blends.</b> The components <b>of</b> ZCAP and their volume percentages influenced the interconnected porosity of ZCAP bioceramics. The interconnected porosity for all <b>blends</b> <b>of</b> ZCAP ranged from 35 to 38 %. Pore sizes from these six <b>blends</b> <b>of</b> ZCAP ranged from less 1 micron to greater than 100 microns. Results of the 12 hour dissolution study showed that more calcium was released than zinc or phosphorous from all <b>blends</b> <b>of</b> ZCAP. Zinc was released in trace amounts from all <b>blends</b> <b>of</b> ZCAP. Release of phosphorous from the different <b>blends</b> <b>of</b> ZCAP was not detected by the procedures used to detect phosphorous in this investigation. These <b>blends</b> <b>of</b> ZCAP have the potential to be used as bone substitutes and probably long term treatment of zinc deficiency in humans...|$|R

40|$|Venture philanthropy {{provides}} a <b>blend</b> <b>of</b> performance-based development <b>finance</b> and professional services to social purpose organisations in helping them expand their social impact. This is a high-engagement, partnership approach {{analogous to the}} practices of venture capital in building the commercial value of companies. In its modern form, venture philanthropy developed significantly in the US in the mid 1990 s, took hold in the UK from 2002 and is now expanding into continental Europe. Although not without its sceptics, venture philanthropy {{has the potential to}} contribute to developing a more responsive and diverse capital market for the social sector. Its focus on building organisational capacity in entrepreneurial social purpose organisations, matching appropriate finance with strategic business-like advice, makes it a distinctive provider of capital. Venture philanthropy in Europe has strong links to the private equity and venture capital community, giving it opportunities to influence the corporate social responsibility of a set of major players in Europe's financial services industry. Several new venture philanthropy funds have been established by philanthropists with successful careers in private equity. Europe's transitional countries, in Central and Eastern Europe, the Baltic States and former Soviet Union, have under-capacitated social sectors and widespread, unmet social needs. Venture philanthropy may have a particularly valuable role to play in helping build stronger civil society institutions in these countries. As a relatively young industry, venture philanthropy faces many challenges in communicating and marketing what it does; developing a menu of financial instruments and advisory services; measuring performance and social impact; collaborating with complementary capital providers such as foundations. This working paper is {{the first in a series}} which explores the expansion of high engagement philanthropy in Europe...|$|R
