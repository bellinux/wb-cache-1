These terms {{can refer to}} either the production of crude oil at an oil well, the conversion of crude oil to other products at an oil refinery, or the overall consumption of oil by a region or country. One common term is barrels per day (BPD, BOPD, bbl/d, bpd, bd, or b/d) where 1 BPD is equivalent to 0.0292 gallons per minute. One BPD also becomes 49.8 tonnes per year. At an oil refinery, production is sometimes reported as <b>barrels</b> <b>per</b> <b>calendar</b> <b>day</b> (b/cd or bcd), which is total production in a year divided by the days in that year.

5000|$|In the 19th century, {{refineries}} in the U.S. processed {{crude oil}} primarily {{to recover the}} kerosene. There was no market for the more volatile fraction, including gasoline, which was considered waste and was often dumped directly into the nearest river. The invention of the automobile shifted the demand to gasoline and diesel, which remain the primary refined products today. Today, national and state legislation requires refineries to meet stringent air and water cleanliness standards. In fact, oil companies in the U.S. perceive obtaining a permit to build a modern refinery to be so difficult and costly that no new refineries were built (though many have been expanded) in the U.S. from 1976 until 2014, when the small Dakota Prairie Refinery in North Dakota is set to begin operation. More than half the refineries that existed in 1981 are now closed due to low utilization rates and accelerating mergers. As {{a result of these}} closures total US refinery capacity fell between 1981 and 1995, though the operating capacity stayed fairly constant in that time period at around [...] Increases in facility size and improvements in efficiencies have offset much of the lost physical capacity of the industry.

40|$|Graduation date: 2005 Construction {{remains the}} most {{hazardous}} industry in the United States {{in terms of the}} aggregate number of fatalities. Twenty percent of all occupational related fatalities occur in construction; approximately three construction workers die <b>per</b> <b>calendar</b> <b>day.</b> Moreover, this trend has been prevalent for too long. One method to reduce this trend is to involve architects and design engineers in considering construction safety during the design process. The concept of designing for construction safety is a viable intervention to improve worker safety. However, in the United States many barriers (legal, contractual, regulatory) exist that prevent this intervention from becoming part of a standard practice within the construction industry. Four-hundred and fifty construction accidents from two databases were analyzed and a link to the design for construction safety concept was determined. An objective investigation model was developed to make these determinations. A significant link between the concept of designing for construction safety and construction fatalities and disabling injuries was established. Specific construction project parameters linked to the concept of designing for construction safety include the minimization of risk due to falls through and from roofs, skylights and structural steel construction; and the minimization of risk due of contact with electric and other utilities. It is recommended that the concept of designing for construction safety be considered by regulatory agencies, insurance companies, and the United States' construction industry as one intervention of a comprehensive safety agenda to reduce the disproportionate number of fatalities and disabling injuries...|$|R

40|$|Across North America, {{water supply}} and {{distribution}} systems (WSDs) are controlled manually by operational staff - who place a heavy reliance on their experience and judgement when rendering operational decisions. These decisions range from scheduling the operation of pumps, valves and chemical dosing in the system. However, due to the uncertainty of demand, stringent water quality regulatory constraints, external forcing (cold/drought climates, fires, bursts) from the environment, and the non-stationarity of climate change, operators have the tendency to control their systems conservatively and reactively. WSDs that are operated in such fashion {{are said to be}} 'reactive' because: (i) the operators manually react to changes in the system behaviour, as measured by Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems; and (ii) are not always aware of any anomalies in the system until they are reported by consumers and authorities. The net result is that the overall operations of WSDs are suboptimal with respect to energy consumption, water losses, infrastructure damage and water quality. In this research, an intelligent platform, namely the Real-time Dynamically Dimensioned Scheduler (RT-DDS), is developed and quantitatively assessed for the proactive control and optimization of WSD operations. The RT-DDS platform was configured to solve a dynamic control problem at every timestep (hour) of the day. The control problem involved the minimization of energy costs (over the 24 -hour period) by recommending 'near-optimal' pump schedules, while satisfying hydraulic reliability constraints. These constraints were predefined by operational staff and regulatory limits and define a tolerance band for pressure and storage levels across the WSD system. The RT-DDS platform includes three essential modules. The first module produces high-resolution forecasts of water demand via ensemble machine learning techniques. A water demand profile for the next 24 -hours is predicted based on historical demand, ambient conditions (i. e. temperature, precipitation) and current calendar information. The predicted profile is then fed into the second module, which involves a simulation model of the WSD. The model is used to determine the hydraulic impacts of particular control settings. The results of the simulation model are used to guide the search strategy of the final module - a stochastic single solution optimization algorithm. The optimizer is parallelized for computational efficiency, such that the reporting frequency of the platform is within 15 minutes of execution time. The fidelity of the prediction engine of the RT-DDS platform was evaluated with an Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) driven case study, whereby the short-term water consumption of the residential units in the city were predicted. A Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model alongside ensemble-driven learning techniques (Random forests, Bagging trees and Boosted trees) were built, trained and validated as part of this research. A three-stage validation process was adopted to assess the replicative, predictive and structural validity of the models. Further, the models were assessed in their predictive capacity at two different spatial resolutions: at a single meter and at the city-level. While the models proved to have strong generalization capability, via good performance in the cross-validation testing, the models displayed slight biases when aiming to predict extreme peak events in the single meter dataset. It was concluded that the models performed far better with a lower spatial resolution (at the city or district level) whereby peak events are far more normalized. In general, the models demonstrated the capacity of using machine learning techniques in the context of short term water demand forecasting - particularly for real-time control and optimization. In determining the optimal representation of pump schedules for real-time optimization, multiple control variable formulations were assessed. These included binary control statuses and time-controlled triggers, whereby the pump schedule was represented as a sequence of on/off binary variables and active/idle discrete time periods, respectively. While the time controlled trigger representation systematically outperformed the binary representation in terms of computational efficiency, it was found that both formulations led to conditions whereby the system would violate the predefined maximum number of pump switches <b>per</b> <b>calendar</b> <b>day.</b> This occurred because at each timestep the control variable formulation was unaware of the previously elapsed pump switches in the subsequent hours. Violations in the maximum pump switch limits lead to transient instabilities and thus create hydraulically undesirable conditions. As such, a novel feedback architecture was proposed, such that at every timestep, the number of switches that had elapsed in the previous hours was explicitly encoded into the formulation. In this manner, the maximum number of switches <b>per</b> <b>calendar</b> <b>day</b> was never violated since the optimizer was aware of the current trajectory of the system. Using this novel formulation, daily energy cost savings of up to 25 % were achievable on an average day, leading to cost savings of over 2. 3 million dollars over a ten-year period. Moreover, stable hydraulic conditions were produced in the system, thereby changing very little when compared to baseline operations in terms of quality of service and overall condition of assets...|$|R
