It is {{necessary}} to halt and close up our files--of correspondence I mean. So it is a chance if, except for contradiction's sake, or upon getting the proof-sheets, I write a line to-day at Boney. I did, however, correct five revised sheets and one proof, which took me up so much of the day that I had but one turn through the courtyard. Owing to this I had some of my flutterings, my trembling exies, as the old people called the ague. Wrote a great many letters--but no [...] "copy." ...|$|E
50|$|In 1959, the Empire {{installed}} new 70mm projectors {{and a new}} {{screen in}} front of the proscenium to show Ben-Hur, which ran for 76 weeks. Following this, in 1961 the Empire was closed for extensive internal reconstruction to a design by Architect George Coles; almost all the original ornate plasterwork was removed with only two small sections remaining, hidden behind false walls and ceilings--one section <b>still</b> <b>being</b> hidden <b>behind</b> the IMAX auditorium side wall.|$|R
50|$|While both basic {{education}} {{and higher education}} have both been improved and expanded in the past 50 years, this has not translated to a more equal society in terms of academics. While the feminist movement has made great strides for women, other groups have not been as fortunate. Generally, social mobility has not increased, while economic inequality has. So, while more students are getting a {{basic education}} and even attending universities, a dramatic divide is present and many people are <b>still</b> <b>being</b> left <b>behind.</b>|$|R
40|$|Science {{communication}} {{is undergoing a}} considerable evolution in the Internet era. Open Access is at last letting researchers, scholars and students in developing countries acquire full access to scientific knowledge. Nowadays, this represents a bit {{less than half of}} the scientific literature, the other half <b>being</b> <b>still</b> hidden <b>behind</b> paywalls and unaffordable by them. Unfortunately, in order to preserve their highly profitable business model, the major publishing companies are flipping the model from "pay to read" to "pay to publish". This is the most important threat for African and other developing countries: the price to pay for reading freely is the loss of opportunity to communicate. A truly democratic future, at the international level, calls for publicly run open publication platforms accessible to all, submitted to open reviewing and immediately accessible. This novel communication tool can only be attractive upon two conditions: 1) it must be attractive enough so that the researchers become aware of the advantages it provides in terms of audience, visibility and potential citations; 2) the research/researcher evaluation processes must take the new paradigm in consideration and quit using the current indirect metrics (proxys) such as the journals impact factor. However, this indispensable change in the evaluation tradition must be adopted worldwide and at the same time if no scientific community, particularly the young generation, is to be sacrificed...|$|R
40|$|The old picture environment, {{introduced}} by Leslie Lamport into the L ATEX kernel almost 20 years ago, {{appears to be}} neglected {{in favor of more}} modern and powerful L ATEX packages that eliminate all drawbacks of the original environment. Nevertheless it is <b>still</b> <b>being</b> used <b>behind</b> the scenes by a number of other packages. Lamport announced an extension in 1994 that should have removed all the limitations of the original environment; in 2003 the first version of this extension appeared; in 2004 the first stable version was released; in 2009 it was actually expanded with new functionality. Nowadays the picture environment can perform like most simple drawing programs, but it has special features that make it invaluable...|$|R
50|$|In {{gridiron}} football, ineligible receiver downfield is {{a penalty}} {{that is called}} when a forward pass is thrown and an ineligible receiver is beyond {{the line of scrimmage}} without blocking an opponent {{at the time of the}} pass. An exception is on screen plays where the ineligible player is allowed to cross the line of scrimmage to go out and block because the ball is <b>still</b> <b>being</b> caught <b>behind</b> the line of scrimmage. This exception, however, does not apply to the NFL. A member of the offensive team considered an eligible receiver by the rules of the game, in most leagues, are the running backs, wide receivers, and tight ends. Ineligible receivers include the center, offensive guards, and offensive tackles.|$|R
6000|$|One {{other thing}} we note: Graf von Khevenhuller, solid Austrian man, issued from Vienna, December 31st, {{last day of}} the Year, with an Army of only some 15,000, but with an {{excellent}} military head of his own, to look into those Conquests on the Donau. Which he finds, as he expected, to be mere conquests of stubble, capable of being swept home again at a very rapid rate. [...] "Khevenhuller, here as always, was consummate in his choice of posts," [...] says Lloyd; [General Lloyd, History of Seven-Years War, &c. (incidentally, somewhere).]--discovered where the ARTERIES of the business lay, and how to handle the same. By choice of posts, by silent energy and military skill, Khevenhuller very rapidly sweeps Segur back; and shuts him up in Linz. There Segur, since the first days of January, is strenuously barricading himself; [...] "wedging beams from house to house, across the streets;"--and hopes to get provision, the Donau and the Bavarian streams <b>being</b> <b>still</b> open <b>behind</b> him; and to hold out a little. It will be better if he do,--especially for poor Karl Albert and his poor Bavaria! Khevenhuller has also detached through the Tyrol a General von Barenklau (BEAR'S-CLAW, much heard of henceforth in these Wars), who has 12,000 regulars; and much Hussar-folk under bloody Mentzel:-across the Tyrol, we say; to fall in upon Bavaria and Munchen itself; which they are too like doing with effect. Ought not Karl Albert to be upon the road again? What a thing, were the Kaiser Elect taken prisoner by Pandours! ...|$|R
50|$|During pre-draft workout, Bledsoe was touted for his quickness, ball {{handling}} ability, {{and ability}} to hit the long ball. He was subsequently selected with the 18th overall pick in the 2010 NBA draft by the Oklahoma City Thunder, but {{was traded to the}} Los Angeles Clippers. In his first season, he averaged 6.7 points and 3.6 assists and started 25 games. As a result, he was named to the NBA All-Rookie Second Team. In his second season, due to the Clippers' acquisition of Chris Paul, he played only an average of 11 minutes per game, with only one start, and his stats dropped. In fact, during that season, he ended up being assigned to the Clippers' NBA Development League affiliate team, the Bakersfield Jam. However, during his third season, his statistics ended up rising in spite of <b>still</b> <b>being</b> <b>behind</b> Chris Paul for most of the games that he played. Bledsoe also participated in the 2013 All-Star Game's Slam Dunk Contest.|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{evidence}} that many of Australia's children are learning literacy in schools, our poorest and most disadvantaged children are <b>still</b> <b>being</b> left <b>behind.</b> To date, {{our understanding of the}} place of transitions in this has been limited, although there has been work on the fourth grade slump (Gee, 2000, 2008) which has followed children's move from early years' classrooms into the fourth or fifth grade; the transition from primary to secondary school (e. g. Bahr & Pendergast, 2007; Pendergast & Bahr, 2005, 2010), and transitions when changing schools (Henderson, 2008). In this chapter, we consider the notion of transitioning, as we unpack issues that are related to recognising and valuing student diversity and difference. Using a lens analogy, we analyse a family case study from two perspectives. We conclude with a list of implications and suggestions for providing high quality and high equity literacy pedagogy and literacy outcomes for middle years students. ...|$|R

It could improve the overall economy of the country by opening more jobs opportunities which means more income to the country. That is why some scientist said that the minimum percentage of entrepreneurs in a country is 2 %. In Indonesia, it still has low entrepreneur percentage which is only 1. 56 %. Compare to other South Asia countries like Singapore which has 5 % of entrepreneurs, Indonesia is <b>still</b> <b>being</b> left <b>behind.</b> This paper explores the factors that affect the entrepreneur growth in Bekasi region, Indonesia. The research identified the education and motivation factors, entrepreneurial intention, readiness of potential entrepreneurs, government rules for the entrepreneurs, and hinders to capital access. The quantitative research method is used as well in this paper. The questionnaires are spread for 215 respondents.
