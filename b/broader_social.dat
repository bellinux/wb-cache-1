5|$|Criminologists analyse the nature, causes, {{and control}} of {{criminal}} activity, drawing upon methods across sociology, psychology, and the behavioural sciences. The sociology of deviance focuses on actions or behaviours that violate norms, including both formally enacted rules (e.g., crime) and informal violations of cultural norms. It is the remit of sociologists to study why these norms exist; how they change over time; {{and how they are}} enforced. The concept of social disorganization is when the <b>broader</b> <b>social</b> systems leads to violations of norms. For instance, Robert K. Merton produced a typology of deviance, which includes both individual and system level causal explanations of deviance.|$|E

She soon found herself in a power struggle with LaGuardia, who preferred to focus on narrower aspects of defense, while she saw solutions to <b>broader</b> <b>social</b> problems as equally important to the war effort. Though LaGuardia resigned from the OCD in December 1941, Eleanor {{was forced to resign}} following anger in the House of Representatives over high salaries for several OCD appointments, including two of her close friends.|$|E
25|$|Authors such as White and Cliffe drew {{attention}} {{to the way in which}} the 'broadening of aid objectives from pure survival support towards rehabilitation, development and/ or peace-building' led to the 'dilution of commitment to core humanitarian principles'. Furthermore, many humanitarian organisations have sought to develop rights-based approaches to assistance strategies which challenge the apolitical approach of traditional humanitarianism. Rights based approaches view poverty and vulnerability as rooted in power relations – specifically, the denial of power, which is itself related to the denial of human rights. Hence rights based approaches to humanitarian action relate the achievement of security for marginalized people to the realization of their human rights and often to <b>broader</b> <b>social</b> change. Multimandate humanitarian organisations that seek more inclusive and participatory forms of citizenship and governance and the achievement of <b>broader</b> <b>social</b> rights outcomes therefore risk enmeshing apolitical humanitarian responses in advocacy programmes that push for <b>broader</b> <b>social</b> changes.|$|E

Tabarrok concluded his study suggesting that gradual elimination of organ donation restrictions and move to a free market in organ sales will increase supply of organs and encourage <b>broader</b> <b>social</b> acceptance of organ donation as a practice.|$|E

25|$|Emphasis {{is placed}} upon this group because {{the years between}} the late teens and the mid-twenties are {{believed}} to be a critical period during which young people form adult identities and move toward independence. The effects of youth disconnection—limited education, social exclusion, lack of work experience, and fewer opportunities to develop mentors and valuable work connections—can have long-term consequences that snowball across the life course, eventually influencing everything from earnings and self-sufficiency to physical and mental health and marital prospects. Much discussion has been focused on how to reach these young people and connect them with <b>broader</b> <b>social</b> institutions in order to prevent these negative consequences.|$|E
25|$|Raja Ravi Varma (29 April 1848–2 October 1906) was {{a celebrated}} Indian painter and artist. He is {{considered}} among the greatest painters {{in the history of}} Indian art for a number of aesthetic and <b>broader</b> <b>social</b> reasons. Firstly, his works are held to be among the best examples of the fusion of European techniques with a purely Indian sensibility. While continuing the tradition and aesthetics of Indian art, his paintings employed the latest European academic art techniques of the day. Secondly, he was notable for making affordable lithographs of his paintings available to the public, which greatly enhanced his reach and influence as a painter and public figure. Indeed, his lithographs increased the involvement of common people with fine arts and defined artistic tastes among common people for several decades. In particular, his depictions of Hindu deities and episodes from the epics and Puranas have received profound acceptance from the public and are found, often as objects of worship, across the length and breadth of India.|$|E

500|$|In the 1920s, every English county cricket {{team had}} an amateur captain. Yorkshire had been led by amateurs since Lord Hawke {{took over the}} {{position}} in 1883. Amateurs were usually from privileged backgrounds, while professionals were mainly from the working classes. Class distinctions pervaded the game, which was organised and administered by former and current amateurs. They wished to preserve leadership roles {{for members of the}} Establishment, in defiance of <b>broader</b> <b>social</b> changes that had reduced their influence in other sports. Administrators argued that amateurs were better captains as they were free from worries over [...] employment. The Wisden editor believed that [...] "the professional may have difficulty in enforcing discipline. He would naturally hesitate to suggest to his committee that this player or that should be dropped, and so be instrumental in depriving the man in question of some part of his livelihood. Further, feeling that an error of judgment would prejudice his standing with the committee, he might well hesitate to take risks." [...] In 1925, Lord Hawke, then the Yorkshire president, expressing his hope that an amateur would always be available to captain the national side, had made the impromptu comment, [...] "Pray God, no professional shall ever captain England." [...] His remarks were widely reported in the press and heavily criticised. This was to leave Hawke in an awkward situation in 1927.|$|E

500|$|Family, {{gender and}} {{sexuality}} form a broad area of inquiry studied in many sub-fields of sociology. A {{family is a}} group of people who are related by kinship ties :- Relations of blood / marriage / civil partnership or adoption. The family unit is one of the most important social institutions found in some form in nearly all known societies. It is the basic unit of social organization and plays a key role in socializing children into the culture of their society. The sociology of the family examines the family, as an institution and unit of socialization, with special concern for the comparatively modern historical emergence of the nuclear family and its distinct gender roles. The notion of [...] "childhood" [...] is also significant. As one of the more basic institutions to which one may apply sociological perspectives, the sociology of the family is a common component on introductory academic curricula. Feminist sociology, on the other hand, is a normative sub-field that observes and critiques the cultural categories of gender and sexuality, particularly with respect to power and inequality. The primary concern of feminist theory is the patriarchy and the systematic oppression of women apparent in many societies, both at the level of small-scale interaction and in terms of the <b>broader</b> <b>social</b> structure. Feminist sociology also analyses how gender interlocks with race and class to produce and perpetuate social inequalities. [...] "How to account for the differences in definitions of femininity and masculinity and in sex role across different societies and historical periods" [...] is also a concern. Social psychology of gender, on the other hand, uses experimental methods to uncover the microprocesses of gender stratification. For example, one recent study has shown that resume evaluators penalize women for motherhood while giving a boost to men for fatherhood.|$|E
