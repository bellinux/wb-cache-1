40|$|Abstract { A cost-e ective <b>built-in</b> <b>self</b> <b>testing</b> (BIST) {{method for}} the {{detection}} of delay faults is presented. A multiple-input signature register (MISR) with a constant parallel input vector is used as a test pattern generator. To reduce the test length of the MISR, a two-step approach is proposed. First, deterministic delay test generation is employed to determine a set of two-pattern tests which detect all testable path delay faults. Second, a minimal number of constant MISR input vectors is calculated such that the state sequences generated by the MISR include the pre-determined test set. The second step is formulated asasetcovering problem. As the number of MISR input vectors may be exponential in the number of stages of the MISR, their calculation and the set covering are performed implicitly with BDDs. Experimental results reveal that in almost all considered cases a maximum robust path delay fault coverage is obtained with less than 100 MISR input vectors. ...|$|R

In designing zero-aliasing space compressors, the concept of strong and weak compatibilities of response approach is considered, and in most cases maximal compaction is achieved.

Balance testing also forms the basis for design for balance testability (DFBT), a systematic DFT technique that achieves full coverage of SSL faults. It places the unit under test in a low-cost framework circuit that guarantees complete balance testability. Unlike most existing DFT techniques, DFBT requires only one additional control input and no redesign of the underlying circuit is necessary.

In this dissertation a methodology to replace the complex and expensive RF functional <b>tests</b> with defect-oriented <b>Built-in</b> <b>Self</b> <b>Tests</b> (BiSTs) is detailed. If a design has sufficient margin to RF specifications then RF tests can be replaced with structural tests using a new data analysis technique called quadrant analysis, which is presented. Data from the analysis of over one million production units of said System on Chip (SoC) is presented along with the results of the analysis. The BiST techniques that have been used are discussed and a Texas Instruments 65 nm RF SoC with a Bluetooth and a FM core was used as a case study.

40|$|A voltage {{controlled}} oscillator (VCO), that generates a periodic signal whose frequency is tuned by a voltage, {{is a key}} building block in any integrated circuit systems. A sine wave oscillator {{can be used for}} a <b>built-in</b> <b>self</b> <b>testing</b> where high linearity is required. A bandpass filter (BPF) based oscillator is a preferred solution, and high quality factor (Q-factor) is needed to improve the linearity. However, a stringent linearity specification may require very high Q-factor, not practical to implement. To address this problem, a frequency harmonic shaping technique is proposed. It utilizes a finite impulse response filter improving the linearity by rejecting certain harmonics. A prototype SC BPF oscillator with an oscillating frequency of 10 MHz is designed and measurement results show that linearity is improved by 20 dB over a conventional oscillator. In radio frequency area, preferred oscillator structures are an LC oscillator and a ring oscillator. An LC oscillator exhibits good phase noise but an expensive cost of an inductor is disadvantageous. A ring oscillator can be built in standard CMOS process, but suffers due to a poor phase noise and is sensitive to supply noise. A RC BPF oscillator is proposed to compromise the above difficulties. A RC BPF oscillator at 2. 5 GHz is designed and measured performance is better than ring oscillators when compared using a figure of merit. In particular, the frequency tuning range of the proposed oscillator is superior to the ring oscillator. VCO is normally incorporated with a frequency synthesizer (FS) for an accurate frequency control. In an integer-N FS, reference spur is one of the design concerns in communication systems since it degrades a signal to noise ratio. Reference spurs can be rejected more by either the lower loop bandwidth or the higher loop filter. But the former increases a settling time and the latter decreases phase margin. An adaptive lowpass filtering technique is proposed. The loop filter order is adaptively increased after the loop is locked. A 5. 8 GHz integer-N FS is designed and measurement results show that reference spur rejection is improved by 20 dB over a conventional FS without degrading the settling time. A new pulse interleaving technique is proposed and several design modifications are suggested as a future work...|$|R
