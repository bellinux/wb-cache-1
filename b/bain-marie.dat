25|$|In a very {{traditional}} form of terrine, au torchon ("in a towel"), a whole lobe of foie is molded, {{wrapped in a}} towel and slow-cooked in a <b>bain-marie.</b> For added flavor (from the Maillard reaction), the liver may be seared briefly over a fire of grape vine clippings (sarments) before slow-cooking in a bain-marie; afterwards, it is pressed served cold, in slices.|$|E
25|$|The first alchemist is {{recognized}} as being Mary the Jewess (c. 200 A.D.). Mary is known for creating a number of improvements to alchemical equipment and tools as well as novel techniques in chemistry. Her most well-known advancements are heating and distillation processes. The water-bath, also known as <b>bain-marie</b> {{is said to have}} been invented by or at least improved by her. This double-boiler was often used in chemistry for processes that might require gentle heating. The tribikos (a basic still) and the kerotakis (a more intricate distilling apparatus) are two other advancements in the process of distillation that are credited to her. It is also said that Mary was the first individual to discover hydrochloric acid, though this is not accepted by most scientific texts. Though we have no writing from Mary herself, she is known from the fourth century writings of Zosimos of Panopolis.|$|E
500|$|In 2012, Jill Turton ate at the {{restaurant}} for the Yorkshire Post following {{the restaurant}}'s fiftieth anniversary, and described some dishes, such as asparagus and a soft-boiled egg which had been cooked in a <b>bain-marie,</b> as [...] "perfect". She described the meal overall as [...] "terrific", but said that the desserts were not a stretch for the kitchen, having ordered a chocolate brownie.|$|E
50|$|In {{small scale}} soap-making, a <b>bain-marie's</b> {{inherent}} control over maximum temperature makes it optimal for liquefying melt-and-pour soap bases prior to molding them into bars. It offers {{the advantage of}} maintaining the base in a liquid state, or reliquefying a solidified base, with minimal deterioration. Similarly, using a water bath, traditional wood glue can be melted and kept in a stable liquid state over many hours without damage to the animal proteins it incorporates.|$|R
500|$|Another dish which {{highlights}} local vegetables is a salt baked turnip side which accompanies duck. Harrod explained [...] "Turnips don't deserve their unloved image, {{they add}} a wonderful freshness to a dish." [...] The {{signature of the}} restaurant is a suckling pig themed dish, incorporating a pork shoulder which is cooked over two days in a <b>bain-marie,</b> served with shallot and mugwort. This {{is accompanied by a}} croquette made from pig's head and a pork cutlet with celeriac, pear, sorrel and cauliflower mushrooms. The restaurant serves breakfast to residents staying in the rooms, which includes Trealy Farm produced sausages and bacon.|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to the relative disorder of English eighteenth century cookery books such as Eliza Smith's The Compleat Housewife (1727) or Elizabeth Raffald's The Experienced English Housekeeper (1769), Mrs Rundell's text is strictly ordered and neatly subdivided. Where those books consist almost wholly of recipes, Mrs Rundell begins by explaining techniques of economy ("A minute account of the annual income and the times of payment {{should be kept in}} writing"), how to carve, how to stew, how to season, to [...] "Look clean, be careful and nice in work, so that those who have to eat might look on", how to choose and use steam-kettles and the <b>bain-marie,</b> the meanings of foreign terms like pot-au-feu ("truly the foundation of all good cookery"), all the joints of meat, the [...] "basis of all well-made soups", so it is page 65 before actual recipes begin.|$|E
2500|$|As of 2017, Western {{restaurant}} kitchens {{typically have}} tiled walls and floors and use stainless steel for other surfaces (workbench, but also door and drawer fronts) because these materials are durable {{and easy to}} clean. Professional kitchens are often equipped with gas stoves, as these allow cooks to regulate the heat more quickly and more finely than electrical stoves. Some special appliances are typical for professional kitchens, such as large installed deep fryers, steamers, or a <b>bain-marie.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} Western alchemists, {{who lived}} in the first centuries of the common era, invented chemical apparatus. [...] The <b>bain-marie,</b> or water bath is named for Mary the Jewess. Her work also gives the first descriptions of the tribikos and kerotakis. Cleopatra the Alchemist described furnaces and has been credited with the invention of the alembic. Later, the experimental framework established by Jabir ibn Hayyan influenced alchemists as the discipline migrated through the Islamic world, then to Europe in the twelfth century.|$|E
2500|$|Like Hollandaise sauce, {{there are}} several methods for the {{preparation}} of Béarnaise sauce. The most common preparation is a <b>bain-marie</b> method where a reduction of vinegar is used to acidulate the yolks. Escoffier calls for a reduction of wine, vinegar, shallots, fresh chervil, fresh tarragon and crushed peppercorns (later strained out), with fresh tarragon and chervil to finish instead of lemon juice. [...] Others are similar. [...] Alternatively, the flavorings may be added to a finished Hollandaise (sans lemon juice). Joy of Cooking describes a blender preparation with the same ingredients. [...] A faux Béarnaise can be produced by adding capers and tarragon to a Hollandaise.|$|E
5000|$|Electric bains-marie {{can also}} be wet, using either hot water or vapor, or steam, in the heating process. The open, bath-type <b>bain-marie</b> heats via a small, hot-water tub (or [...] "bath"), and the vapour-type <b>bain-marie</b> heats with scalding-hot steam.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>bain-marie</b> ( [...] ; {{also known}} as a water bath or double boiler), a type of heated bath, is a piece of {{equipment}} used in science, industry, and cooking to heat materials gently and gradually to fixed temperatures, or to keep materials warm over a period of time.

5000|$|A {{contemporary}} {{alternative to}} the traditional, liquid-filled <b>bain-marie</b> is the electric [...] "dry-heat" [...] <b>bain-marie,</b> heated by elements below both pots. The dry-heat form of electric bains-marie often consumes less energy, requires little cleaning, and can be heated more quickly than traditional versions. They can also operate at higher temperatures, and are often much less expensive than their traditional counterparts.|$|E

50|$|Mary's name survives in her {{invention}} of the <b>bain-marie</b> (Mary's Bath), which limits the maximum temperature of a container and its contents to the boiling point of a separate liquid: essentially a double boiler. It is extensively used in chemical processes for which a gentle heat is necessary. This term was introduced by Arnold of Villanova in the 14th century. The <b>bain-marie</b> is also used for cooking food.|$|E
