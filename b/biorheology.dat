The extracted trajectories are exploited to compute the mean-squared displacement that characterizes the dynamics of the probe particles. Limited spatial resolution and statistical uncertainty are the limiting factors that alter the accuracy of the mean-squared displacement estimation. We precisely quantified the effect of localization errors in the determination of the mean-squared displacement by separating the sources of these errors into two separate contributions. A “static error” arises in the position measurements of immobilized particles. A “dynamic error” comes from the particle motion during the finite exposure time that is required for visualization. We calculated the propagation of these errors on the mean-squared displacement. We examined the impact of our error analysis on theoretical model fluids used in <b>biorheology.</b> These theoretical predictions were verified for purely viscous fluids using simulations and a multiple-particle tracking technique performed with video microscopy. We showed that the static contribution can be confidently corrected in dynamics studies by using static experiments performed at a similar noise-to-signal ratio.

Kornfield in the Journal of Rheology and are reproduced here with their permission. 1 2. 1 Wall Slip – A Classical Problem with Implications in <b>Biorheology</b> Accurate rheological characterization using rheometric flows depends critically upon the “no-slip ” boundary condition, which essentially requires that the sample adhere to the surfaces of the rheometer. Stated more specifically, the velocity of the sample at the sample boundary must be equal to the velocity of the adjacent tool surface (Figure 1) so that the deformation rate of the sample is known. Unfortunately, a wide range of materials violate this boundary condition. For example, in suspensions and emulsions (e. g., creams, lotions, and pastes) a thin “depletion ” layer can form as particles/droplets migrate away from the boundary. The depletion layer forms a planar region with reduced viscosity and so the deformation becomes inhomogeneous. Polymers in solution are entropically driven away from solid boundaries; in this case, depletion layers form {{even in the absence of}} flow. 21 Many biological specimens slip due to the formation of lubricating layers at their surfaces. Elastomers are susceptible to slip even without lubricating fluid layers, sliding at the tool interface if there is insufficient friction...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Cytoskeletal {{proteins}} tagged {{with green}} fluorescent protein were used to directly visualize the mechanical role of the cytoskeleton in determining cell shape. Rat embryo (REF 52) fibroblasts were deformed using glass needles either uncoated for purely physical manipulations, or coated with laminin to induce attachment to the cell surface. Cells responded to uncoated probes in accordance with a three-layer model in which a highly elastic nucleus is surrounded by cytoplasmic microtubules that behave as a jelly-like viscoelastic fluid. The third, outermost cortical layer is an elastic shell under sustained tension. Adhesive, laminin-coated needles caused focal recruitment of actin filaments to the contacted surface region and increased the cortical layer stiffness. This direct visualization of actin recruitment confirms a widely postulated model for mechanical connections between extracellular matrix proteins and the actin cytoskeleton. Cells tethered to laminintreated needles strongly resisted elongation by actively contracting. Whether using uncoated probes to apply simple deformations or laminin-coated probes to induce surface-to-cytoskeleton interaction we observed that experimentally applied forces produced exclusively local responses by both the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton. This local accomodation and dissipation of force is inconsistent with the proposal that cellular tensegrity determines cell shape.

40|$|Abstract. A {{viscometer}} for bedside blood measurements was developed, {{consisting of}} an oscillating resonator probe mounted {{directly into a}} disposable vacutainer tube for blood withdrawal. It was tested in vitro on blood samples with variable hemat-ocrits (20 – 60 %), increasing fibrinogen concentrations (0 – 20 g/l), increasing concentrations of an admixed radiographic contrast medium and erythrocyte suspensions in dextran 40 and dextran 70. Results were compared with those obtained with a conven-tional Couette viscometer. Oscillating viscometry yielded generally higher values than Couette viscometry, and had a good sensitivity for changes in hematocrit with a good correlation between the two methods (r = 0. 96, p < 0. 0001). Oscillating viscosity depended on the resonator frequency, it was higher at 3900 Hz than at 215 Hz, suggesting a viscoelastic behavior of blood. Erythrocyte aggregation, induced by increasing fibrinogen concentrations or dextran 70, affected oscillating viscometry. At a high frequency, i. e. a smaller penetration depth of the shear wave, oscillating viscosity tended to decrease, which suggests a depletion of the boundary layer from erythrocytes when they aggregate. At low frequency with a deeper shear wave penetration (about 50 µm), erythrocyte aggregation increased oscillating viscosity. Bedside tests in 17 patients with coronary heart disease and 10 controls confirmed the easy practicability of the test and showed lower oscillating viscosity in these patients despite higher fibrinogen concentrations presumably due to increased erythrocyte aggregation. We conclude that oscillating viscom-etry is an interesting bedside test, which is capable of providing new information on the <b>biorheology</b> of the erythrocyte-poor boundary layer near the vessel wall...|$|E
40|$|Chondrocytes {{have been}} shown to express both in vivo and in vitro a number of integrins of the beta 1 -, beta 3 - and beta 5 -subfamilies (<b>Biorheology</b> 37 (2000) 109). Normal and v-Src-transformed chick {{epiphyseal}} chondrocytes (CEC) display different adhesion properties. While normal CEC with time in culture tends to increase their adhesion to the substrate by organizing focal adhesions and actin stress fibers, v-Src-transformed chondrocytes display a refractile morphology and disorganization of actin cytoskeleton. We wondered whether the reduced adhesion and spreading of v-Src-transformed chondrocytes could be ascribed to changes in integrin expression and/or function. Integrin expression by normal CEC is studied and compared to v-Src-transformed chick chondrocytes, using monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to integrins alpha- and beta-chains. We show the presence of alpha 1 -, alpha 3 -, alphav-, alpha 6 -, beta 1 - and beta 3 -chains on CEC, with very low levels of alpha 2 - and alpha 5 -chains. Alphav chain associates with multiple beta subunits in normal and transformed chondrocytes. With the exception of alpha 1 - and alpha 2 -chains, the levels of the integrin chains analyzed are higher in transformed chondrocytes as compared with normal chondrocytes. In spite of the increased levels of integrin expression, transformed chondrocytes exhibit loss of focal adhesion and actin stress fibers and low adhesion activity on several extracellular matrix constituents. These observations raise the possibility that, in addition to its effects on global pattern of integrin expression, v-Src can influence integrin function in chondrocytes...|$|E

Flows in a Couette viscometer and a capillary tube have been simulated to investigate various combinations of Reynolds and/or viscous stresses power law models for hemolysis prediction. A finite volume-based computational method provided Reynolds and viscous stresses {{so that the}} effects of area-averaged and time-averaged Reynolds stresses, as well as total, viscous, and wall shear on hemolysis prediction could be assessed. The flow computations were conducted by using Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes models of turbulence (k-ε and k-ω SST) to simulate four different experimental conditions in a capillary tube and seven experimental conditions in a Couette viscometer taken from the literature. Power law models were compared by calculating standard errors between measured hemolysis values and those derived from power law models with data from the simulations. In addition, suitability of Reynolds and viscous stresses was studied by threshold analysis. Results showed {{there was no evidence of}} a threshold value for hemolysis in terms of Reynolds and viscous stresses. Therefore, Reynolds and viscous stresses are not good predictors of hemolysis. Of power law models, the Zhang power law model (Artificial Organs, 2011, 35, 1180 – 1186) gives the lowest error overall for the hemolysis index and Reynolds stress (0. 05570), while Giersiepen’s model (The International journal of Artificial Organs, 1990, 13, 300 – 306) yields the highest (6. 6658), and intermediate errors are found through use of Heuser’s (<b>Biorheology,</b> 1980, 17, 17 – 24) model (0. 3861) and Fraser’s (Journal of Biomechanical Engineering, 2012, 134, 081002) model (0. 3947) ...|$|E

A fluorescent polarization method was used to assess erythrocyte membrane <b>biorheology</b> and to measure its fluidity. Eighteen sub-jects participated in the study: 8 healthy controls and 10 patients with morbid obesity. The erythrocyte membrane fluidity was obtained in the healthy subjects and in the patients with morbid obesity prior to and after a ten-day zero-calorie diet. Fluidity was determined by steady-state fluorescence polarization after incorpo-ration of the lipophilic probe 1, 6 -diphenyl- 1, 3, 5 hexatriene (DPH).

40|$|Biological tissues like {{intervertebral}} discs and {{articular cartilage}} primarily consist of interstitial fluid, collagen fibrils and negatively charged proteoglycans. Due to the fixed charges of the proteoglycans, the total ion concentration inside the tissue {{is higher than}} in the surrounding synovial fluid (cation concentration is higher and the anion concentration is lower). This excess of ion particles leads to an osmotic pressure difference, which causes swelling of the tissue. In the last decade several mechano-electrochemical models, which include this mechanism, have been developed. As these models are complex and computationally expensive, it is only possible to analyze geometrically relatively small problems. Furthermore, there is still no commercial finite element tool that includes such a mechano-electrochemical theory. Lanir (<b>Biorheology,</b> 24, pp. 173 – 187, 1987) hypothesized that electrolyte flux in articular cartilage can be neglected in mechanical studies. Lanir's hypothesis implies that the swelling behavior of cartilage is only determined by deformation of the solid and by fluid flow. Hence, the response could be described by adding a deformation-dependent pressure term to the standard biphasic equations. Based on this theory we developed a biphasic swelling model. The goal {{of the study was to}} test Lanir's hypothesis for a range of material properties. We compared the deformation behavior predicted by the biphasic swelling model and a full mechano-electrochemical model for confined compression and 1 D swelling. It was shown that, depending on the material properties, the biphasic swelling model behaves largely the same as the mechano-electrochemical model, with regard to stresses and strains in the tissue following either mechanical or chemical perturbations. Hence, the biphasic swelling model could be an alternative for the more complex mechano-electrochemical model, in those cases where the ion flux itself is not the subject of the study.

40|$|A new {{technique}} of visualization of diffusion-convection phenomena at a solid-liquid interface using the luminol chemiluminescent reaction catalyzed by immobilized peroxidase {{has been previously}} described (Dimicoli, J. L., M. Nakache, and P. Peronneau, 1982, <b>Biorheology,</b> 19 : 281 - 300). We propose now a theoretical model that predicts quantitatively the light fluxes, JL, corresponding to the transfer J of the hydrogen peroxide substrate at the liquid-solid interface in a cylindrical tube for continuous flow experiments. A simple phenomenological relation, J alpha J 1 /mL (1 less than m less than 3) was first established for each point of the wall. Then, numerical integration showed that, independent of the laminar or turbulent character of the flow, J 1 /mL was proportional to (S 1 Kideal) /(1 + Kideal/ET), where S 1 is the bulk substrate concentration, Kideal is the ideal transport coefficient, and ET (in cm. S- 1) a phenomenological first-order enzymatic rate constant per unit of wall surface. This relation proved to be satisfactory for all experimental conditions since a single mean value of ET {{takes into account the}} experimental data collected for a given enzymated tube in a large range of Reynolds number values (Re) (500 less than Re less than 9, 000) and of distances from the entrance of the tube (chi greater than 0. 3 cm). This quantitative analysis using a pseudo-first-order approximation interprets the observed great dependence of JL on Re(JL alpha Ren', with n' usually greater than 1 / 3 for laminar flows) and on S 1 (JL alpha S 1 m). It predicts also that the laminar-to-turbulent transition can be evidenced for interfacial enzymatic activity, ET greater than 2. 10 (- 4) cm. S- 1, as observed with most of the tubes prepared by covalent binding of peroxidase on the acrylamide gel wall. The experiment had to be carried out at a pH value of 8, which corresponds to the fastest rate of the chemiluminescent reaction. The predicted entrance effects were also observed experimentally {{for the first time in}} an immobilized enzyme system. This technique appears therefore to be a valuable tool for the quantitative analysis of diffusion-convection phenomena at a liquid-solid interface with a good spatial resolution with a great range of flow rate...|$|E

It can arise from positive feedback transcription networks and {{can be found in a}} colony of cells by the coexistence of two populations with different stable concentration of a specific protein. In M. Acar, A. Becskei, A. van Oudenaarden, ¿Enhancement of cellular memory by reducing stochastic transitions¿, Letters to nature 435, 228 (2005), Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells were found to switch from one stable state to another one of the Galactose-signalling network. This network is mainly governed by a positive feedback loop and the switching rate depended on the state from which cells came. In order to describe such phenomena a deterministic model based on positive feedback loops is not sufficient. The aim of the present work is to understand from a theoretical point of view how these transitions are originated and predict the rate at which they jump between different stable states. For this purpose numerical simulations have been done based on Langevin equations with multiplicative noise and later compared to theoretical predictions derived from Fokker-Plank equations. In order to become familiar with the required numerical and theoretical techniques the Ginzburg-Landau model has been previously studied.

But as technology and research is reaching new zeniths in the present times, cure or early detection of cancer is possible. The detection of rare cells can help understand the origin of many diseases. The current study deals with one such technology that {{is used for the}} capture or effective separation of these rare cells called Lab-on-a-chip microchip technology. The isolation and capture of rare cells is a problem uniquely suited to microfluidic devices, in which geometries on the cellular length scale can be engineered and a wide range of chemical functionalizations can be implemented. The performance of such devices is primarily affected by the chemical interaction between the cell and the capture surface and the mechanics of cell-surface collision and adhesion. This study focuses on the fundamental adhesion and transport mechanisms in rare cell-capture microdevices, and explores modern device design strategies in a transport context. The <b>biorheology</b> and engineering parameters of cell adhesion are defined; chip geometries are reviewed. Transport at the microscale, cell-wall interactions that result in cell motion across streamlines, is discussed. We have concentrated majorly on the fluid dynamics design of the chip. A simplified description of the device would be to say that the chip is at micro scale. There are posts arranged on the chip such that the arrangement will lead to a higher capture of rare cells. Blood consisting of rare cells will be passed through the chip and the posts will pose as an obstruction so that the interception and capture efficiency of the rare cells increases. The captured cells can be observed by fluorescence microscopy. As compared to previous studies of using solid microposts, we will be incorporating a new concept of cylindrical shell micropost. This type of micropost consists of a solid inner core and the annulus area is covered with a forest of silicon nanopillars. Utilization of such a design helps in increasing the interception and capture efficiency and reducing the hydrodynamic resistance between the cells and the posts. Computational analysis is done for different designs of the posts. Drag on the microposts due to fluid flow has a great significance on the capture efficiency of the chip. Also, the arrangement of the posts is important to contributing to the increase in the interception efficiency. The effects of these parameters on the efficiency in junction with other factors have been studied and quantified. The study is concluded by discussing design strategies with a focus on leveraging the underlying transport phenomena to maximize device performance...|$|E
40|$|Tracking the Brownian {{motion of}} colloids {{was first used}} about {{a hundred years ago}} to {{demonstrate}} the molecular nature of matter. Today's colloidal scientists perform particle tracking experiments to assess the structural and mechanical properties of complex materials at a micron length scale. Indeed, the dynamics of micron sized probe particles embedded in a material can be related to the local mechanical response of the system. This probing technique, called microrheology, has received much interest in the last few decades due to the importance of a materials local properties in its function and its macro-scale characteristics. These new assessments are especially relevant in soft matter sciences such as biophysics. Video microscopy particle tracking is an easy technique to implement experimentally. Movies of the fluctuating particles in a sample are recorded and analyzed off-line using custom algorithms. For this reason, it is widely used in studies of soft matter properties and in fluid dynamics. However, behind this apparent simplicity lie a number of subtle limitations that can alter significantly the validity of the measurements. The focus of the parts of this thesis is an exhaustive characterization of the errors incurred in the standard video microscopy particle tracking setup. (cont.) Detailed understanding of these errors led to new methods to circumvent some of the intrinsic limitations. The trajectories extracted from particle tracking are used to compute the means-squared displacement that characterizes the dynamics of the probe particles. This measurement suffers from two kinds of limitations: the finite spatial resolution in the particle localization and statistical uncertainties. The source of localization errors was separated into two separate contributions. A "static error" arises in the position measurements of immobilized particles. A "dynamic error" comes from the particle motion during the finite exposure time that is required for visualization. We calculated the propagation of these errors on the mean-squared displacement and examined the impact of our analysis on theoretical model fluids used in <b>biorheology.</b> These theoretical predictions were verified for purely viscous fluids using simulations and a multiple particle tracking technique performed with video microscopy. We showed that the static contribution could be confidently eling the sampling design, we derived estimators for the mean and variance of particle's dynamics that are independent, under well-efined conditions, of the peculiar statistics of the measurement output. (cont.) These estimators serve to quantify a material heterogeneity. Having gained a full characterization of the technique, we applied video multiple particle tracking to study a complex time-evolving system of self-assembling peptides. This material undergoes a transition from a purely viscous solution to an elastic hydrogel through the molecular assembly of the peptides into a fibrous network. We used the oligo-peptide KFE 8 as a model self-assembling peptide and assessed the dependency of the gelation kinetics with the pH of the solution. We were able to develop a theoretical model for this dependency by using the Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory for the interaction between the peptides. by Thierry Savin. Thesis (Ph. D.)
