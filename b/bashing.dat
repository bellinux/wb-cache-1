40|$|Abstract—Shell {{scripting}} is {{the primary}} way for programmers to interact {{at a high level}} with operating systems. For decades <b>bash</b> shell scripts have thus been used to accomplish various tasks. But <b>Bash</b> has a counter-intuitive syntax that is not well understood by modern programmers and is no longer adequately supported, making it now difficult to maintain. <b>Bash</b> also suffers from poor performance, memory leakage problems, and limited functionality which make continued dependence on it problematic. At the request of our industrial partner, we therefore developed a source-to-source translator, <b>bash</b> 2 py, which converts <b>bash</b> scripts into Python. <b>Bash</b> 2 py leverages the open source <b>bash</b> code, and the internal parser employed by <b>Bash</b> to parse any <b>bash</b> script. However, <b>bash</b> 2 py re-implements the variable expansion that occurs in <b>Bash</b> to better generate correct Python code. <b>Bash</b> 2 py correctly converts most <b>Bash</b> into Python, but does require human intervention to handle constructs that cannot easily be automatically translated. In our experiments on real-world open source <b>bash</b> scripts <b>bash</b> 2 py successfully translates 90 % of the code. Feedback from our industrial partner confirms the usefulness of <b>bash</b> 2 py in practice...|$|R

5000|$|The Great American <b>Bash</b> was a {{pay-per-view}} (PPV) event {{consisting of}} a main event and undercard that feature championship matches and other various matches. The Great American <b>Bash</b> was originally known as The Great American <b>Bash</b> until 2009; this was the original name when produced under the professional wrestling promotions World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and Jim Crockett Promotions. The first The Great American <b>Bash</b> event was produced under the National Wrestling Alliance's Jim Crockett Promotions and took place on July 6, 1985 at the American Legion Memorial Stadium in Charlotte, North Carolina.

The first Great American <b>Bash</b> event produced under the WCW banner was The Great American <b>Bash</b> 1991, which has been considered the worst show under the event chronology. After the purchase of WCW by the World Wrestling Federation in 2001, none of their pay-per-view event names were seen again until The Great American <b>Bash</b> returned under World Wrestling Entertainment in 2004.

5|$|The willie wagtail perches on low branches, fences, posts, and the like, {{watching}} for insects {{and other small}} invertebrates in the air or on the ground. It usually hunts by hawking flying insects such as gnats, flies, and small moths, but will occasionally glean from the ground. It will often hop along the ground and flit behind people and animals, such as cattle, sheep or horses, as they walk over grassed areas, to catch any creatures disturbed by their passing. It wags its tail in a horizontal fashion while foraging in this manner; the exact purpose of this behaviour is unknown but is thought to help flush out insects hidden in vegetation and hence make them easier to catch. The willie wagtail takes ticks from the skin of grazing animals such as cattle or pigs, even from lions asleep in a zoo. It kills its prey by <b>bashing</b> it against a hard surface, or holding it and pulling off the wings before extracting the edible insides.|$|E
