This period also witnessed the demolition of Merton <b>Board</b> <b>Mills,</b> which was replaced by the Sainsbury's Savacentre. Merton Abbey station and railway line were also removed at this time and the line was replaced by the Merton relief road, Merantun Way.

In September 1951, the most serious peacetime oil fire to date broke out at Avonmouth Docks, and Pyronaut made the journey down the River Avon to attend; she pumped water continually for two days. The following year saw her fighting a dangerous fire aboard the m.v. Stalheim in the city docks.|$|E

By monitoring the network pressure the compressor's output pressure can be constantly maintained at the lowest possible level, with the minimum idle running time.

40|$|The trends to {{increased}} speed and higher qualities {{have increased the}} need for wet-end control - especially for systems with on-line measuring devices and feed forward control. One possibility {{is the use of}} Focused Beam Reflectance Measurement (FBRM) to measure on-line particle counts and their dimensions in (high concentration) suspensions. This paper describes the use of FBRM for: i) wet-end optimisation at an uncoated woodfree paper-mill; and ii) web break prediction at a corrugated <b>board</b> <b>mill.</b> At the woodfree mill, the aim was to analyse and stabilise the wet end to improve runnability and reduce downtime. The FBRM was used to determine the chord length distributions of both pulp and white water; to evaluate fixation and retention agents and to determine the retention on a hand sheet. It was also possible to chart and monitor the complete wet-end section of the mill. At the <b>board</b> <b>mill</b> FBRM was used to analyse the relation between measured water parameters and variations in process and product quality. FBRM showed a relation between the amount of particles in the white water and web breaks - it seems that web breaks can be predicted by measuring the amount of small particles with the FBRM...|$|E

The studied problem concerns pre-evaporation of effluents in a <b>board</b> <b>mill</b> using excess heat. Different alternatives are evaluated, taking into account economic, technical and practicable constraints. The results show that it is cost-effective to pre-evaporate the effluent using excess heat in the studied mill...|$|E

The two Drewrys were then onsold to Forest Loaders, a subcontractor working for Tranz Rail in the Portland area, loading log wagons at Portland. Both locomotives were renumbered by Forest Loaders as FL 106 and FL 107 respectively. Both are now preserved by the Bay of Islands Vintage Railway.|$|R
