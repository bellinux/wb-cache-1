5|$|Belgrano {{also met}} María Dolores Helguero in Tucumán, and briefly {{considered}} getting married, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> forced a postponement. María Dolores married another man; the relationship ended, but was briefly restarted in 1818. While he {{was near the}} frontiers of Córdoba, Santa Fe, and Buenos Aires, and in a delicate state of health, he learned that María Dolores {{had given birth to}} his daughter, Manuela Mónica del Sagrado Corazón, who was born on 4 May 1819.|$|E
5|$|Hood was {{the closest}} to {{completion}} and her construction was continued in case the Germans managed to complete any of their new battlecruisers. Admiral Beatty continually pressed to have Hoods construction expedited and for her sisters to be restarted, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> Cabinet refused to approve either measure as nothing could be sacrificed in the shipbuilding programme to this end. After {{the end of the}} war the three suspended ships were cancelled as they could not fully incorporate the lessons of the war.|$|E
50|$|The Caribbean {{region was}} war-torn {{throughout}} much of colonial history, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>wars</b> were often based in Europe, with only minor battles fought in <b>the</b> Caribbean. Some <b>wars,</b> however, were borne of political turmoil in the Caribbean itself.|$|R

50|$|After {{conducting}} a brief shakedown cruise {{off the coast}} of Texas, Hidalgo sailed to the Panama Canal Zone for routing to the Pacific Ocean 5 September 1945, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>war's</b> end brought orders to proceed to Norfolk, Virginia.|$|R
5|$|In the end, King {{was forced}} to impose {{overseas}} conscription after {{the failure of the}} voluntary recruitment campaign, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> ended soon after and his government survived unscathed. The conscription crisis however, hardened the animosity between King and his naval minister. Macdonald, disillusioned by what he saw as the chicanery and ruthlessness of national politics, longed to return to Nova Scotia. After King called an election for June 11, 1945, Macdonald resigned from the federal cabinet.|$|E
5|$|The brigade {{was then}} sent to India as the division's advance party, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> ended before it could begin operations. Instead the brigade became {{involved}} in disarming the Japanese forces in Malaya and Singapore, to restore British sovereignty. Its last operation was in Java, where it remained until a Dutch force arrived to take over. The brigade then rejoined the 6th Airborne Division, which was serving in Palestine, but was disbanded almost immediately afterwards.|$|E
5|$|The {{reality of}} defeat for Austria caused a reevaluation of {{internal}} divisions, local autonomy, and liberalism. The new North German Confederation {{had its own}} constitution, flag, and governmental and administrative structures. Through military victory, Prussia under Bismarck's influence had overcome Austria's active resistance {{to the idea of}} a unified Germany. Austria's influence over the German states may have been broken, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> also splintered the spirit of pan-German unity: most of the German states resented Prussian power politics.|$|E
50|$|The {{conflicts}} were over, but Dauphiné {{was destroyed}} {{and its people}} exhausted. The enactment of the Edict of Nantes (1598) restored some civil rights to the Huguenots and brought peace for a short time, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>wars</b> resumed soon afterward.|$|R

5|$|After a {{short period}} of {{occupation}} duty, the 44th Infantry Division returned to the United States in July 1945 where it began training for deployment to the Pacific Theater. As part of Operation Coronet it was intended that Dean would lead the division during the planned invasion of Honshū, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> came to an end before this took place and the operation was subsequently cancelled. Dean then oversaw the drawdown of the division until he was relieved of command on November 1, 1945. The 44th Infantry Division was disbanded {{by the end of that}} month.|$|E
5|$|After the battle, Persano was {{replaced}} by Admiral Giovanni Vacca; {{he was ordered to}} attack the main Austrian naval base at Pola, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> ended before the operation could be carried out. After the end of the war, the government lost confidence in the fleet and drastically reduced the naval budget. The cuts were so severe that the fleet had great difficulty in mobilizing its ironclad squadron to attack the port of Civitavecchia in September 1870, as part of the wars of Italian unification. Instead, the ships were laid up and the sailors conscripted to man them were sent home. Terribile was rapidly surpassed, first by central battery and then turret ships, which made the first generation of ironclads like Terribile and her sister obsolete.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the end of}} the Second World War in Europe {{the brigade}} saw active service in Italy, the South of France and Greece. At {{the end of the}} European war the brigade {{returned}} to the United Kingdom and was intended to join the 44th Indian Airborne Division in the Far East, for service against the Japanese Empire, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> ended before they sailed. Instead the brigade was assigned to the 6th Airborne Division, which had been named the Imperial Strategic Reserve, and sent to serve in the Mandate of Palestine.|$|E
50|$|After <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> Ghibelline {{power had}} risen up once again, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>wars</b> weren't over. In 1447, the Ghibellines {{encountered}} failures when the Ambrosian Republic was created and broke down. <b>The</b> <b>wars</b> of <b>the</b> Guelphs and Ghibellines continue until 1529, when Charles I of Spain seized imperial power in Italy during <b>the</b> Italian <b>Wars.</b> Faced with <b>the</b> {{threat of a}} foreign invasion, the two factions made peace with one another.|$|R

5|$|Charles X died in February 1660 and was {{succeeded by}} a regency council—led by {{the queen mother}} Hedvig Eleonora—that ruled {{in the name of}} Charles XI who was only four {{at the time of his}} father's death. Sweden had come close to almost {{complete}} control over trade in the Baltic, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> revealed the need to work against the formation of anti-Swedish alliances that included Denmark, especially with France, the most powerful state in Europe at the time. There were some successes in foreign policy with the anti-French 1668 Triple Alliance of England, Sweden, and the Dutch Republic.|$|E
5|$|Frost {{also met}} RAF Flight Sergeant C.W.H. Cox, who {{had volunteered to}} {{accompany}} C Company for the operation; as an expert radio mechanic, {{it would be his}} job to locate the Würzburg radar set, photograph it, and to dismantle part of it for transportation back to Britain. Derek Garrard of Jones' team asked Jones to obtain an Army uniform and identification number for Cox, as he would be the object of special attention from the Germans if he was captured in Air Force uniform, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> Office were obdurate.|$|E
5|$|Johnson fell {{unconscious}} {{after this}} duel and was dragged from the battlefield; {{in addition to}} his five wounds, twenty other bullets had hit his horse and gear. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> in the Northwest was over. Although there was no organized resistance to his presence in Canada, Harrison withdrew to Detroit because of supply problems. (The Canadians would not feed his men.) Johnson eventually recovered, except for a crippled hand, but he was still suffering from his wounds {{when he returned to the}} House in February 1814.|$|E

5|$|New regiments {{continued}} to muster into service at Indianapolis. The 28th Regiment U.S. Colored Troops, organized between December 24, 1863, and March 31, 1864, {{was the only}} black regiment formed in Indiana during the war. The regiment trained at Camp Fremont, near Fountain Square. It included 518 enlisted men who signed on for a term of three years, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> was effectively over within a year, cutting short its term of service. The regiment lost 212 men before it mustered out of service on November 8, 1865.|$|E
5|$|On 20 October, Bazaine's {{infantry}} conducted reconnaissance toward Kherson and met no organized resistance before withdrawing. After {{they returned}} to Kinburn, the French and British commanders determined that the fort could be rebuilt and held through the upcoming winter. A force of 1,700 men was left behind to garrison the position, along with the three ironclad batteries. The rest of the force returned to the Crimea. Though the British had initially considered continuing up the Dneiper to capture Nikolaev, it became clear after the seizure of Kinburn that {{to do so would}} require much larger numbers of soldiers to clear the cliffs that dominated the river than had been originally estimated. The British planned to eventually launch an offensive to take Nikolaev in 1856, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> ended before it could be begun.|$|E
5|$|Substantial combat {{had ended}} <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> had not, and a formal treaty of peace was months away. The British still had 26,000 troops occupying New York City, Charleston, and Savannah, {{and had a}} {{powerful}} fleet. The French army and navy departed, so the Americans were on their own in 1782–83. Money matters fed the anxiety; the treasury was empty, and the unpaid soldiers were growing restive {{almost to the point}} of mutiny. At one point, they forced an adjournment of the Congress from Philadelphia to Princeton. Washington dispelled unrest among officers by suppressing the Newburgh Conspiracy in March 1783, and Congress came up with the promise of a five-year bonus.|$|E

5|$|The Company {{suggested}} to the UK government {{that it might}} despatch 500 troopers from the Rhodesian Reserves to Europe {{to act as an}} all-Southern Rhodesian unit on the Western Front (in Belgium and France), <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> Office in London replied that such an expeditionary force would be more practically deployed in Africa, within the South African forces. When the Company relayed this idea south, the South Africans said they were happy to take the Southern Rhodesians, but only if they enlisted independently in existing Union regiments. The Company found itself in the unusual position of having a prospective expeditionary force that nobody wanted. Unwilling to wait, some Southern Rhodesian would-be soldiers made their own way to England to join the British Army directly, as individuals or in groups. By the end of October 1914, about 300 were on their way.|$|E
5|$|The Vietnam War, (also {{known as}} the Second Indochina War, Vietnam Conflict, and in Vietnam as the American War), took place from 1955 to 1975. The war was fought between the Communist-supported Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the United States-supported Republic of Vietnam, {{beginning}} {{with the presence of}} a small number of US military advisors in 1955 and escalating into direct US involvement in a ground war in 1965. US combat forces were withdrawn in early 1973 pursuant to the Paris Peace Accords, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> continued concluding with the Fall of Saigon on 30 April 1975.|$|E
