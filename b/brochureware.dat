A factor that is increasing the intensity of this pressure whilst offering assistance in meeting this challenge is e-business, In this context this is not purely e-commerce and <b>brochureware,</b> but {{an extension of the}} power of the web into all areas of the organisation. This is a discussion paper that focuses on two examples of e-business activity: collaboration and support networks, and their relevance to SMEs...|$|E
40|$|This study aims to {{evaluate}} the websites of independent hotels in Singapore in the business-to-consumer (B 2 C) framework. The modified balanced scorecard (BSC) approach is incorporated into the evaluation by features method {{in order to avoid}} the dominance of the marketing perspective by including technical, customer, and destination information perspectives. A set of website evaluation criteria representing these four perspectives is then used to examine the websites of 37 independent hotels. Almost three of four hotels get it right in developing, utilizing, and maintaining their websites. These websites have the presence of features that are known to be contributing towards website effectiveness. Ten websites were found to function as <b>brochureware</b> with no capability to perform business transactions online. The results of the study propose areas for website improvement that include the destination information perspective in general and contemporary aspects of the marketing perspective...|$|E

[...] Humboldt State University, Sociology, 2014 Social {{movements}} emerge {{to create}} change, yet even within movements there exists tension surrounding any single vision of social change. Movement participants often choose between two fundamentally different approaches: fighting for change by reforming existing institutions or transforming institutions and society to affect change. While not always explicitly stated, {{this question of}} reforming versus transforming frames the vision, goals, objectives and tactics of social movements worldwide. This choice of approach is particularly salient in the gender and sexuality movements. The differences between reformative and transformative framing of these movements are clear, as victories range from achieving same-sex marriage rights through successful litigation to culturally challenging binary conceptualizations of gender and sexuality. Throughout history technology has affected social movement tactics. The Internet has enabled activists to participate in social movements in unprecedented ways. This study explores {{the relationship between a}} gender and sexuality movement organization???s master frames and the types of online activism they deploy. In this study I examined gender and sexuality movement websites. Using content analysis, I coded sites on their use of transformative or reformative master frames, particularly exploring community identification, injustice framing, scope of issues addressed, and organizational type. I then further analyzed sites identifying e-mobilizations (<b>brochureware</b> and online facilitation of offline actions) and e-tactics, or online protest actions. I found that both transformative and reformative movements use e-mobilizations very frequently, while reformative movements were more likely to use online protest actions such as petitions, boycotts, and email or letter writing campaigns...|$|E
40|$|D. Litt. et Phil. Today, {{more and}} more organisations are {{adopting}} {{the use of the}} Internet and webbased technologies in the management of and provision of access to information and knowledge resources and services in digital formats. However, it appears that innovative use of the web is more pronounced in corporate organisations. For example, corporate organisations are using portals or sophisticated websites to conduct electronic commerce via the web and provide access to both internal and external information resources and services, accessed via the Internet, intranets, and extranets. The view of the researcher is that innovative use of the Internet and web-based technologies, such as portals, should not be the domain of the corporate world alone. The focus of this thesis is, therefore, to establish the potential application possibilities of portals in other types of organisations, especially agricultural research organisations in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region. The main research problem addressed in this thesis was What is the nature and application possibility of agricultural information portals in the provision of webbased, value-added information services for researchers? To address the above research problem, literature relating to the historical development of the Internet and the World Wide Web, intranet and extranet applications in organisations, as well as portals and their applications, was reviewed. In addition, a study was made of international trends regarding the provision of access to digital agricultural information resources and services via the web, and a questionnaire survey was conducted to establish whether it was necessary to use portals to provide access to digital-based agricultural information resources and services in agricultural research organisations in the SADC region. ii Resulting from the literature reviews, the study of websites of international agricultural organisations, and the survey on the need for portals in agricultural research organisations in the SADC region, the study established that: · There are several potential applications of portals in agricultural research organisations. This led to the definition of the nature and major components of the type of portal that could serve the needs of researchers in agricultural research organisations. · There is a need for portals in agricultural research organisations in the SADC region. The current use of the web in these organisations in the region is largely limited to the development of <b>brochureware</b> types of websites, providing access to information contained in the organisations’ brochures. Therefore, there is need to upgrade from basic Web sites to advanced sites or portals, and the study concluded that in this regard {{there is a need for}} clear guidelines to assist agricultural research organisations to plan the deployment of their information portals. Currently, most organisations are using ad hoc approaches when developing their Web sites. The dissertation, furthermore, develops the definition of an agricultural information portal as a web-based application that is accessed via the intranet or extranet and provides a personalised and adaptive interface that enables agricultural researchers to discover, track, and interact with colleagues and other people, software applications, information resources, services and tools relevant to their research interests and work. Taking into account the major components and definition of an agricultural information portal, the study proposes guidelines for use in planning the deployment of portals in agricultural research organisations. The proposed guidelines are independent of specific portal design or development methodology, application domains, and techniques...|$|E
