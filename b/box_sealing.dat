5000|$|A {{case sealer}} or box sealer {{is a piece}} of {{equipment}} used for closing or sealing corrugated boxes.

One set of ballot boxes was missing a book of voting papers from the presidential election box, although all the other books were locked inside.

50|$|The major use {{of water}} based pipe coating is for {{ductile iron pipe}} that {{comprises}} water supply lines infrastructure.

5000|$|<b>Box</b> <b>sealing</b> tape (also [...] "Packing Tape"; [...] "Parcel tape", UK) {{is a type}} of {{packaging}} tape which is clear or opaque, and used for closing packages for shipment. It is usually two inch (48 mm) or three inch (72 mm) wide and is made of a polypropylene or polyester backing.|$|E
5000|$|If a tape {{remains on}} {{corrugated}} box during recycling, a tape should be chosen {{which does not}} hinder box recyclability. [...] For example, when taped corrugated boxes are recycled, film backed <b>box</b> <b>sealing</b> tapes do not hinder box recycling: the PSA adhesive stays with the backing and is easily removed.|$|E
60|$|A small <b>box,</b> with a <b>sealed</b> paper {{torn off}} from it (the paper {{containing}} an inscription) was found open, and empty, {{on a table}} in the room. Mr. Luker has himself personally identified the <b>box,</b> the <b>seal,</b> and the inscription. He has declared that the box did actually contain the diamond, called the Moonstone; and he has admitted having given the <b>box</b> (thus <b>sealed</b> up) to Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite (then concealed under a disguise), on the afternoon of the twenty-sixth of June last. The fair inference from all this is, that the stealing of the Moonstone was the motive of the crime.|$|R

50|$|The first British {{secret ballot}} using ballot papers and a ballot box {{was held in}} Pontefract on 15 August 1872, {{under the terms of}} the {{recently}} enacted Ballot Act 1872.

50|$|Reuse or {{recycling}} {{are sometimes}} {{aided by a}} tape being removable from a surface. If a tape remains on an item during recycling, a tape should be chosen which does not hinder the recyclability of the item. For example, when taped corrugated boxes are recycled, film backed <b>box</b> <b>sealing</b> tapes do not hinder box recycling: the PSA adhesive stays with the backing and is easily removed.|$|E
50|$|ASTM International has {{dozens of}} {{standards}} related to pressure-sensitive tape. Some {{of them are}} for general types of PSA tape: Others are for specific types. For example, ASTM D1000 has test methods for electrical tapes. There are ASTM specifications for many tapes including: D2301 for vinyl electrical tape, D5486 for <b>box</b> <b>sealing</b> tape, etc. Several of the ASTM test methods are coordinated with PSTC, other trade associations, and other international organizations.|$|E
5000|$|With semi {{automated}} equipment, {{the operator}} typically fills and loads a {{box at the}} entrance to the case sealer; the box may or may not have the bottom flaps previously closed. The operator closes the top flaps and feeds the box in or through a machine which automatically applies the closure. This helps save time and controls the application of the closure materials such as <b>box</b> <b>sealing</b> tape ...|$|E
25|$|Carbon {{itself is}} solid at {{case-hardening}} temperatures {{and so is}} immobile. Transport {{to the surface of}} the steel was as gaseous carbon monoxide, generated by the breakdown of the carburising compound and the oxygen packed into the <b>sealed</b> <b>box.</b> This takes place with pure carbon but too slowly to be workable. Although oxygen is required for this process it is re-circulated through the CO cycle and so can be carried out inside a <b>sealed</b> <b>box.</b> The <b>sealing</b> is necessary to stop the CO either leaking out or being oxidised to CO2 by excess outside air.|$|R
5000|$|The {{secret ballot}} was {{eventually}} extended generally in the Ballot Act 1872, substantially reducing {{the cost of}} campaigning (as [...] "treating" [...] was no longer realistically possible) and was first used on 15 August 1872 to re-elect Hugh Childers as MP for Pontefract in a ministerial by-election following his appointment as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.

There was considerable interest in the outcome, many observers believing that support for the parties might be drastically different once voters {{were able to make}} their choice in secret; but in the event the shares of the vote were much as they had been at the previous general election.

5000|$|Verifying {{titles of}} {{ownership}} {{was the most}} frequent task carried out by [...] "places of authentication". Accordingly, their clerks copied out previously issued charters, checked up on {{the authenticity of the}} originals, and recorded the deed either in a register or {{in the form of a}} chirograph. The clerks always had to be convinced that a landowner's claims to ownership was genuine before issuing a charter affirming his or her title to landed property. For this purpose, the clerks examined the document, determining by reference both to its writing, seal and other features whether it carried the mark of authenticity in all its details. Private papers of local landowners were kept in deposit <b>boxes</b> <b>sealed</b> by the owners.|$|R
2500|$|A cat {{is placed}} in a <b>box</b> <b>sealed</b> off from {{observation}} with a quantum mechanical switch designed to kill the cat when appropriately deployed. While in the box, the cat is described as being in a quantum superposition of [...] "dead" [...] and [...] "alive" [...] states, though opening the box effectively collapses the cat's wave function {{to one of the}} two conditions. In the case of the EPR paradox, quantum entanglement appears to allow for the physical impossibility of information transmitted faster than the speed of light, violating special relativity. Related to the EPR paradox is the phenomenon of quantum pseudo-telepathy in which parties who are prevented from communicating do manage to accomplish tasks that seem to require direct contact.|$|R
50|$|The {{idea for}} what became duct tape came from Vesta Stoudt, an ordnance-factory worker {{and mother of}} two Navy sailors, who worried that {{problems}} with ammunition <b>box</b> <b>seals</b> would cost soldiers precious time in battle. She wrote to President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1943 with the idea to <b>seal</b> the <b>boxes</b> with a fabric tape, which she had tested at her factory. The letter was forwarded to the War Production Board, who put Johnson & Johnson on the job. The Revolite division of Johnson & Johnson had made medical adhesive tapes from duck cloth from 1927 and a team headed by Revolite's Johnny Denoye and Johnson & Johnson's Bill Gross developed the new adhesive tape, designed to be ripped by hand, not cut with scissors.|$|R
