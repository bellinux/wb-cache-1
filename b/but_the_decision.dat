5|$|Back in Washington, both Scully and Mulder {{report to}} Section Chief McGrath, {{who does not}} believe their claims. McGrath offers an {{especially}} harsh reprimand to Mulder, and presents written testimony by Henderson claiming that Max's {{body was found in}} a cargo container. McGrath and his disciplinary board decide to shut down the X-Files and dismiss Mulder from the FBI, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> is vetoed by Deep Throat, who feels it would be more dangerous for them to allow Mulder to turn whistleblower than to let him continue his work.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{receipts}} {{were initially}} insufficient {{to cover the}} six per cent dividend on the £5,697 that the Conservators had invested, they added the difference to the capital, so that the debt steadily increased. This state of affairs was challenged in 1735, when it was decreed that the original capital had been repaid, and the poor should now benefit, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> was overturned in 1738 on appeal.|$|E
50|$|The House of Lords {{held that}} the first {{instance}} judge’s decision was to be restored.

60|$|Somehow, {{not only}} the first climaxes of a game <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>decisions,</b> <b>the</b> convictions, the reputations of {{pitchers}} and fielders evolve around the great hitter.

5|$|In February 1953, Lympne {{was again}} {{waterlogged}} and Silver City Airways operated out of Southend and Blackbushe. The company {{stated that they}} were willing to purchase Lympne, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> of Folkestone Town Council was still awaited for. By May, Folkestone Town Council had decided not to purchase Lympne and Silver City Airways again expressed an interest in purchasing the airport at a reasonable price. In November, it was announced that Air Kruise had been given permission to operate a scheduled service from Lympne and/or Ramsgate to Birmingham. The service was to be seasonal between April and September, with permission to run the service lasting until 1960. Air Kruise moved its operations to Ramsgate Airport in 1953.|$|E
5|$|On December 17, Judge Sanderson finally {{ruled that}} prize {{fighting}} was illegal in San Francisco {{and the courts}} would not determine who the winner was. Sharkey retained the purse, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> provided no vindication for Earp. Until the fight, Earp had been a minor figure known regionally in California and Arizona. Afterward, his name was known {{from coast to coast}} in the worst possible way. Earp sold his interest in his horses on December 20 and left San Francisco shortly afterward. He only returned when he caught a boat to Alaska. Earp's decision left a smear on his public character that followed him until he died and afterward.|$|E
5|$|The Christmas tree is {{decorated}} with lights that are switched on at a seasonal ceremony. It is usually held twelve days before Christmas Day. The festivity {{is open to the}} public and attracts a large number of people. The switch-on is usually followed by several nights of Christmas carol singing and other performances and events. On the twelfth night of Christmas, the tree is taken down for recycling. Westminster City Council threatened to abandon the event to save £5,000 in 1980 <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> was reversed.|$|E

5|$|The issues {{regarding}} {{the development of}} the park's coastline remain open. The Master Plan of Tsarevo Municipality adopted in 2008 and approved by the Ministry of Environment and Water envisages the construction of vacation complexes with 75,000 beds on the territory of the park and Natura 2000 network. As a result, the European Commission launched an infringement procedure against Bulgaria that forced the Ministry to withdraw the positive environmental assessment of the Master Plan in 2010 <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> was rejected by the Supreme Administrative Court. The Strandzha Nature Park Management Plan drafted in 2003 has not yet meet with approval by the Ministry of Environment and Water.|$|E
5|$|The jamming {{operations}} were effective, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> {{to pack a}} large number of aircraft into relatively small airspace made it certain that German night fighters would locate some aircraft. At this time, German policy was to commit only Experten to battle as they had the skill and experience to find and shoot down Allied bombers. The first fighters were being vectored onto their targets as the bombs began to fall on Ladbergen. Four pilots claimed all eight of the Lancasters lost on the raid out of a operating force of some 203 bombers. Geschwaderkommodore of NJG 4, Heinz-Wolfgang Schnaufer claimed two; Hauptmann (Captain) Hermann Greiner claimed three; Hauptmann Josef Kraft claimed two, while Major Martin Drewes claimed one.|$|E
5|$|The main turbine and boiler {{building}} {{is now a}} locally listed building, standing today as {{a monument to the}} important role that Tyne and Wear played in the development of electrical supply. The building had been considered for the more protected Listed Building status, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> was taken in May 2004 not to promote it. Other early power stations in the area (such as those at Dunston and Wallsend) have all been entirely demolished. The Lemington station is partly still standing due to riverside sites becoming less important to industrial development, leading to the site never being redeveloped.|$|E

5|$|After {{the signing}} of the Treaty of Saigon, the Huế court {{attempted}} to regain what it had lost militarily through diplomacy. Vietnamese negotiators sought a reversal of the territorial cession, which they regarded as the most humiliating clause of the treaty. In late 1863, the Vietnamese proposed extensive financial, economic, and political concessions in exchange for the return of the three provinces. Tự Đức sent Gian to France to seek an audience with Napoleon III. There Gian behaved in a helpless manner in an attempt to gain pity from the French monarch. Gian promised that Vietnam would pay large indemnities for the military conflicts, grant further commercial concessions and a protectorate over all six southern provinces. Napoleon initially agreed, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> was reversed after lobbying from French officers.|$|E
5|$|Although the Byzantine–Bulgarian {{conflict}} {{that began in}} 913 was provoked by the Byzantines, it was the Bulgarian monarch Simeon I (r. 893–927) who was seeking pretext to wage war and fulfil his ambitions to claim an imperial title for himself and to assume the throne of Constantinople. Unable to confront the Bulgarians, the Byzantines reluctantly recognized Simeon I as Emperor of Bulgaria (in Bulgarian, Tsar) as early as July 913 <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> was revoked after a palace coup in Constantinople in 914. Three years later, in 917, the main Byzantine forces were routed in the Battle of Achelous and the Bulgarians took the military initiative. In the four year that followed they launched a number of successful campaigns, reaching the walls of Constantinople and the Isthmus of Corinth.|$|E
5|$|Following their 11th-place {{finish in}} the 2012–13 Premier League Norwich started their {{preparations}} for their third consecutive season in the top flight by releasing ten players in May 2013 including first team players Chris Martin, Simeon Jackson, Elliot Ward and Marc Tierney. Over {{the course of the}} summer James Vaughan, Grant Holt, Leon Barnett and Jacob Butterfield were all sold for undisclosed fees. Former Norwich City manager Paul Lambert returned to his former club to sign goalkeeper Jed Steer for his current club Aston Villa <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> on a fee went to tribunal. During the summer Declan Rudd and Andrew Surman were both loaned out to lower league clubs for the season.

5|$|Meanwhile, Matilda's younger brother, William Adelin, {{died in the}} White Ship {{disaster}} of 1120, leaving England facing a potential succession crisis. On Emperor Henry V's death, Matilda was recalled to Normandy by her father, who arranged for her to marry Geoffrey of Anjou to form an alliance to protect his southern borders. Henry I had no further legitimate children and nominated Matilda as his heir, making his court swear an oath of loyalty to her and her successors, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> was not popular in the Anglo-Norman court. Henry died in 1135 but Matilda and Geoffrey faced opposition from the Norman barons and were unable to pursue their claims. The throne was instead taken by Matilda's cousin Stephen of Blois, who enjoyed {{the backing of the}} English Church. Stephen took steps to solidify his new regime, but faced threats both from neighbouring powers and from opponents within his kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Starting with {{victory in}} the Revolution, there were many {{proposals}} to build a monument to Washington. After his death, Congress authorized a suitable memorial in the national capital, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> was reversed when the Democratic-Republican Party (Jeffersonian Republicans) took control of Congress in 1801. The Republicans were dismayed that Washington had become {{the symbol of the}} Federalist Party; furthermore the values of Republicanism seemed hostile to the idea of building monuments to powerful men. They also blocked his image on coins or the celebration of his birthday. Further political squabbling, along with the North-South division on the Civil War, blocked the completion of the Washington Monument until the late 19th century. By that time, Washington had the image of a national hero who could be celebrated by both North and South, and memorials to him were no longer controversial.|$|E
5|$|As {{there were}} {{insufficient}} transport aircraft {{for all three}} brigades to conduct their operations simultaneously, {{it was decided that}} the first operation would be Ladbroke, whose objective was the capture of the Ponte Grande Bridge. The mission, under the command of Brigadier Philip Hicks, was conducted just prior to the amphibious landings, on the night of 9July, while the remaining two operations took place on successive two nights. The 1st Airlanding Brigade was also given the additional tasks of capturing Syracuse harbour and the urban area that adjoined it, and either destroying or confiscating a coastal artillery battery that was in range of the amphibious landings. When training began for the operation, difficulties immediately arose. The original plan for the airborne operations had called for all three to employ parachutists, but in May Montgomery altered the plan; after determining that airborne troops would be at a considerable distance from Allied ground forces, he believed that the force sent to capture Syracuse would be served best by gliders in order to provide them with the maximum possible amount of firepower. His airborne advisor, Group Captain Cooper of the Royal Air Force, argued that a glider landing conducted at night with inexperienced aircrews was not practical, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> was left unchanged.|$|E

5|$|During another {{summer with}} his Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon, Harry Potter and Dudley are {{attacked}} by Dementors. After using magic to save Dudley and himself, Harry is expelled from Hogwarts, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> is later rescinded. Harry is whisked {{off by a}} group of wizards (including the real Mad-Eye Moody, Professor Lupin, and several new faces, including Nymphadora Tonks, a bubbly young witch who is a Metamorphmagus , and Kingsley Shacklebolt, a senior Auror who believes everyone is equal) to Number 12, Grimmauld Place, the former home of his godfather, Sirius Black. The building also serves as the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix, of which Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, Lupin, Mad-Eye, and Sirius are members. Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger explain that the Order of the Phoenix is a secret organisation led by Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore, dedicated to fighting Lord Voldemort and his followers, the Death Eaters. From the members of the Order, Harry and the others learn that Voldemort is seeking an object {{that he did not have}} prior to his first defeat, and assume this object to be a weapon of some sort. Harry learns that the Ministry of Magic, led by Cornelius Fudge, is refusing to acknowledge Voldemort's return because of the trouble that doing so would cause, and has been running a smear campaign against him and Dumbledore.|$|E
