30|$|The {{construction}} documents {{maintained a}} high level of accuracy in setting out the connection intersection point markings onto members of variable thickness. These markings became guides for an assembly process that included tolerances and human error, resulting in an interconnection that allowed a level of in-situ form finding. The method was straightforward enough to allow for the onsite crossing of language and cultural barriers. A certain level of self-correction took place during the installation: as the system relied on the material’s natural bending behaviour, installation errors that deviated too far from the ‘exact’ simulated digital geometry would become impossible as the real-world material would fight back to find its balance. Large human annotation errors would be spotted and corrected instantly by the spontaneously <b>balanced</b> <b>construction</b> system.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} gender (re) presentation in three carefully selected works: Brown Girl, Brownstones; The Color Purple; and When Rocks Dance. Employing the scholarship of women {{writers of the}} Diaspora, I contend that the works dismantle and (re) construct gender identities. Where traditional notions of sexuality depict men as masculine and women as feminine, this analysis interrogates and subverts the traditional paradigm. Methodologically, the dissertation combines literary analysis, post-colonial studies, and gender schema theory into an interdisciplinary approach. I begin by exploring gender construction to establish a theoretical perspective for characters who reject traditional heteronormative paradigms. I then extend recent critical discussions on gender and post-colonialism by examining {{the relationships between the}} men and women in each literary text.

40|$|Construction {{skill is}} one of the vital aspects of {{construction}} work which is growing in importance due to skill gaps and skill shortages during different economic cycles. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate competence development strategies by a traditional construction company within its own pool of skill resources and among its supply chain members. The study was carried out via literature review, empirical studies involving a focus study, analysis of documentary evidence supported by unstructured interviews and a report of skill development/supply chain conference. The study demonstrates how longterm skill development can be achieved through: (a) strategic capacity planning which allows high retention, continuous training, and <b>balanced</b> <b>construction</b> demand and contractor’s supply capacity over a long-term; (b) updating and upgrading the knowledge base of the supply chain through conferences and training schemes; (c) strategic investment in the workforce through training, vocational and higher degrees; and (d) acquaintance with different sources of finance. This study will assist small traditional firms in building competencies in skill development and improvement. It will assist an international audience who may face similar issue with their construction firms. 1...|$|E

Variations in the subgrade width and surfacing depth seem to affect cost the most. Fuel consumption of alternative logging systems is also compared in this paper. The results indicate that cable logging initially consumes more fuel due to increased road construction. However, once the roads are established, cable logging systems consume less fuel than tractor logging. This study indicates that it takes approximately 40 to 60 years for cable logging systems to catch and surpass tractor systems in terms of total accumulated fuel consumption...|$|E

40|$|Tapered {{designs are}} {{currently}} certified only for balanced and symmetric laminate construction, despite the severe design constraint that 1 angle-ply termination requires a further 3 angle-ply terminations: two terminations to maintain <b>balanced</b> <b>construction</b> and a further two terminations to maintain symmetry. This constraint is often violated in practice, leading to localised thermal warping; {{the effects of}} which {{have yet to be}} quantified. An obvious, but somewhat controversial strategy for ‘thin laminate’ designs, with traditional uni-directional (UD) material, is to adopt unbalanced and/or nonsymmetric stacking sequence configurations to fully exploit the available design space, particularly where tapered designs are a requirement. This extended design space has previously been shown to contain warp-free laminates with either fully uncoupled mechanical properties or with Extension-Shearing and/or BendingTwisting coupling behaviour. Extension-Shearing coupling, which arises in unbalanced construction, can be exploited to produce bending-twisting deformation in aircraft wing-box structures when top and bottom skins have identical bias fibre alignment, but equally, this can be eliminated with opposing bias fibre alignment. Bending-Twisting coupling, which is generally present in symmetric laminate construction, results in weaker compression buckling strength compared to the equivalent fully uncoupled laminate (with matching stiffness properties), but with potentially stronger shear buckling strength. Recent studies on Extension-Shearing and Bending-Twisting coupled laminates have provided useful insight into the available design space for tapered laminates with single angle-ply or cross-ply terminations. Similar tailoring strategies are now applied to unconventional tapered laminate designs (i. e. those free from the ubiquitous symmetric and balanced, or un-balanced, design constraint) with two-ply terminations, to investigate the extent to which angleply layers can be terminated without introducing Extension-Shearing coupling, or the extent to which angle- and cross-ply combinations can be terminated to tailor or maintain Extension-Shearing throughout the tapered laminate. Consideration is also given to the potential effectiveness of introducing tailored mechanical coupling through ply terminations, e. g. to induce bending-twisting coupling in a wing-tip or winglet, using Extension-Shearing coupling at the laminate level, whilst maintaining fully uncoupled laminate behaviour in the tapered skins elsewhere in the wing-box...|$|E

40|$|Constructability {{considerations}} are of importance in segmental bridge construction as {{the occurrence of}} failures of bridge superstructures under construction have highlighted. For a safe and economical construction process the interactions between construction loads and the permanent structural system, depending on the chosen erection method, need to be evaluated. Segmental bridges can be constructed with methods like <b>Balanced</b> Cantilever <b>Construction,</b> where individual spans are counterweighted about their substructure support. Time-dependent material properties like strength of the newly cast concrete, as well as shrinkage, creep, and relaxation influence the structural system resistance. Resulting stresses in the unfinished bridge structure during construction can even exceed the final stresses during service.

During recent years, the Taiwan {{government}} launches {{issues of}} green building, sustainable engineering, carbon reduction and etc., to promote <b>balance</b> <b>construction</b> and environment ecology.

Then makes the value analysis and properties investigation for HPC. Based on this research, rice husk (RH) will contain lots of silicon dioxide (SiO 2) after burning into RHA.
