40|$|This paper {{tries to}} {{determine}} {{to what extent}} EU-US cooperation {{in the field of}} international peace and security is impacted by bilateral relations under the New Transatlantic Agenda versus multilateral dialogues. It employs Michael Smith's framework of 'bi-multilateral' negotiations in its analysis. The case studies explored are <b>bilateral</b> <b>dialogues</b> under the New Transatlantic Agenda alongside multilateral dialogues in the framework of the United Nations, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and ad hoc fora such as the Middle East Quartet. The main finding is that <b>bilateral</b> and multilateral <b>dialogues</b> are complementary in EU-US cooperation on issues of international peace and security. <b>Bilateral</b> <b>dialogues</b> by themselves are not sufficient to effectively address complex international peace and security issues. Multilateral dialogues can gain useful support, efficiency and a degree of legitimacy from good relations at the bilateral level. Moreover, ad hoc fora can be valuable additions which may complement both existing bilateral as well as multilateral EU-US dialogues. Finally, the choice of forum and the potential of EU-US cooperation are often considerably influenced {{by the nature of the}} issue under discussion...|$|R
