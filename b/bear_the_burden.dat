25|$|Furthermore, Apple {{had created}} too many similar models that {{confused}} potential buyers. At one point, its product lineup was subdivided into Classic, LC, II, Quadra, Performa, and Centris models, with {{essentially the same}} computer being sold under {{a number of different}} names. These models competed against Macintosh clones, hardware manufactured by third parties to whom Apple had licensed System 7. This succeeded in increasing the Macintosh's market share somewhat, and provided cheaper hardware for consumers, but hurt Apple financially as existing Apple customers began to buy cheaper clones which cannibalized the sales of Apple's higher-margin Macintosh systems, while Apple continued to <b>bear</b> <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> of developing Mac OS.|$|E
25|$|For most exchanges, forward {{contracts}} were standard at the time. However, most forward contracts {{were not}} honored {{by both the}} buyer and the seller.

Additionally, the forward contracts market was very illiquid and an exchange was needed that would bring together a market to find potential buyers and sellers of a commodity instead of making people <b>bear</b> <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> of finding a buyer or seller.|$|E

Confederate and State authorities became increasingly concerned about a shadowy organization in north-central Arkansas known as the Peace Society. The Peace Societies were largely union sympathizers who felt that the large slaveholding planters of southern Arkansas and the deep South had caused the war; they felt that they should be required to <b>bear</b> <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> of the conflict.

Christian professor Craig Detweiler writes in his 2008 book A Purple State of Mind: Finding Middle Ground in a Divided Culture that, {{if he could have}} given his students a graduation present, {{it would have been a}} copy of What's So Amazing About Grace? because many of his Christian students were more concerned with avoiding the forbidden than they were with enjoying the permitted.

500|$|Governor of the Bank of England {{and former}} Governor of the Bank of Canada Mark Carney has {{described}} two approaches to global financial reform: shielding financial institutions from cyclic economic effects by strengthening banks individually, and defending economic cycles from banks by improving systemic resiliency. Strengthening financial institutions necessitates stronger capital requirements and liquidity provisions, {{as well as}} better measurement and management of risks. The G-20 agreed to new standards presented by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision at its 2009 summit in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The standards included leverage ratio targets to supplement other capital adequacy requirements established by Basel II. Improving the resiliency of the global financial system requires protections that enable the system to withstand singular institutional and market failures. Carney has argued that policymakers have converged on the view that institutions must <b>bear</b> <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> of financial losses during future financial crises, and such occurrences should be well-defined and pre-planned. He suggested other national regulators follow Canada in establishing staged intervention procedures and require banks to commit to what he termed [...] "living wills" [...] which would detail plans for an orderly institutional failure.|$|E

500|$|The US ran a {{propaganda}} campaign through the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) {{to enhance the}} size of the southward exodus. The program was directed by Colonel Edward Lansdale, who masqueraded as the assistant US air attaché in Saigon while leading a covert group that specialised in psychological warfare. Lansdale had advised Diem that it was imperative to maximise the population in the south in preparation for the national reunification elections. When Diem noted the limited ability of the south to absorb refugees, Lansdale assured him that the US would <b>bear</b> <b>the</b> <b>burden.</b> Diem thus authorised Lansdale to launch the propaganda campaign. According to the historian Seth Jacobs, the campaign [...] "ranked with the most audacious enterprises in the history of covert action". Lansdale recollected that [...] "U.S. officials {{wanted to make sure that}} as many persons as possible, particularly the strongly anti-communist Catholics, relocated in the South". While many Diem supporters claimed that the mass exodus was proof of the popularity of Diem and the people's hatred of communism, the CIA operative Chester Cooper said [...] "the vast movement of Catholics to South Vietnam was not spontaneous". However, while Lansdale is often credited by historians—usually those critical of his influence—with the large exodus of refugees due to superstition, he rejected the notion that his campaign had much effect on popular sentiment, saying in later years: [...] "People don’t just pull up their roots and transplant themselves because of slogans. They honestly feared what might happen to them, and their emotion was strong enough to overcome their attachment to their land, their homes, and their ancestral graves. So the initiative was very much theirs—and we mainly made the transportation possible." [...] Some northerners who stayed behind and were interviewed half a century later said that they had not come across any pro-migration propaganda and said that their decisions were based on discussions with fellow locals. They said that concerns over the possible effects of communist rule were discussed among themselves independent of outside information.|$|E

In her view, when she became prime minister, she had very little time or chance to make up ground on the Liberals once her initial popularity faded.
