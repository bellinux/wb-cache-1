A seamstress by trade, she joined the textile workers’ union in 1930 and was part of International Red Aid Chișinău from 1931 to 1933. She joined the Romanian Communist Party, then illegal, in 1933. A Jew, she was deported to the Transnistria Governorate during World War II. After the King Michael Coup of August 23, 1944, she held a number of positions in the PCR (which soon after became the Romanian Workers' Party, PMR), starting {{as a member of}} the <b>Bucharest</b> <b>county</b> party committee bureau. In 1948 she joined the Ilfov County party committee.|$|E
40|$|AbstractPublic {{policies}} {{have an important}} role in stimulating the birth. Due to society modernisation, Europeans are increasingly less interested in having children. Therefore, decisions on fertility must allow cross-fertility with labour market participation and not addressing them separately (Francesconi, 2002; Del Boca, 2002; Apps and Rees, 2004; Laroque and Salanie, 2005). Researches on women labour participation, mostly empirical studies, emphasize the negative effect of fertility rates in diminishing the labour supply. Thus, a study with married couples from <b>Bucharest</b> <b>County,</b> Romania was conducted. The main objective was to assess the reproductive behaviour for the married couples. The methodology consists on a Computer Assisted Telephonic Interviews questionnaire, developed by authors. The sample size was of 201 respondents aged 25 - 39 years. Data was processed on unweight database, using SPSS 19. 0. The case-study results show that in the decision to have a child, wage and the overall income are the most important determinants...|$|E

25|$|Romania {{is divided}} into 41 {{counties}} (județe, pronounced judets) and the municipality of <b>Bucharest.</b> Each <b>county</b> is administered by a county council, responsible for local affairs, {{as well as a}} prefect responsible for the administration of national affairs at the county level. The prefect is appointed by the central government but cannot be a member of any political party. Each county is further subdivided into cities and communes, which have their own mayor and local council. There are a total of 319 cities and 2,686 communes in Romania. A total of 103 of the larger cities have municipality statuses, which gives them greater administrative power over local affairs. The municipality of Bucharest is a special case as it enjoys a status on par to that of a county. It is further divided into six sectors and has a prefect, a general mayor (primar), and a general city council.|$|R
50|$|Romania {{is divided}} into 41 <b>counties</b> (judeţe) plus <b>Bucharest.</b> Each <b>county</b> (judeţ) is {{centered}} on a municipality. Each one of the 41 municipalities has a main police headquarters for that county. Starting in the 1990s, the municipalities' police sections created Rapid Intervention detachments, to participate in operations that could pose a life-threatening risk to the officers involved in carrying them out. Detaşamentul de Intervenţii şi Acţiuni Speciale (DIAS, Special Actions and Interventions Detachment). DIAS groups were formed in all 41 municipalities, {{as well as in}} Bucharest. In 1999, however, Constantin Dudu Ionescu, who then headed the Ministry of Administration and Interior (MAI), signed the order for creating a much larger organization, called Serviciul de Poliţie pentru Intervenţie Rapidă (SPIR). SPIR was basically a much-enlarged DIAS, which was now composed of several teams, plus logistics and support structures. In November 2001, all 41 municipalities were obliged to change the names of their special detachments from DIAS; most were renamed to DPIR.|$|R

The long distance code was changed from 9 to 0, the area code for Bucharest became 01, while to the rest of the country was temporarily given a 0 before the older area codes.

There was some criticism of the use of Desiros for CFR's long-distance services because they were considered to be uncomfortable.

5000|$|Ilfov County is {{the only}} county that has its capital outside of its {{territorial}} area, in Bucharest which {{is not part of}} the actual county. Initially, immediately after the 1968 reform of the public administration in communist Romania, Ilfov was a larger county, that comprised its present-day territory, the entire Giurgiu <b>County,</b> <b>Bucharest</b> and the western parts of Călăraşi and Ialomiţa counties. Later during the communist period, its territory was reduced to its current size and it became one of the sectors of Bucharest. It became again a county in 1997, when its capital was designated to be Bucharest.However, in 2005, some plans were proposed that would merge Bucharest with 90 other communes located to up to 40 km outside the city, in Ilfov County and other nearby counties into a [...] "metropolitan area" [...] of Bucharest, similar to Greater London. As of 2011, these plans did not happen, while a debate on the general administrative division of Romania was under way.|$|R
5000|$|With a total {{route length}} of 1374 km, the RATB bus network {{is the most}} dense {{out of all the}} {{transport}} types in Bucharest. There are 85 bus lines (plus 25 night routes), most of which operate in the Municipality of Bucharest. However, there are also 11 bus lines which provide services to the towns and villages which border <b>Bucharest,</b> in Ilfov <b>county,</b> and whose populations usually commute to Bucharest for work. In mid-2005, the lines that linked the city to the peripheral area were licensed out to independent transportation providers, but in early 2006, they were placed once again under the control of RATB due to a wide range customer complaints about the private operators. Sometime in 2010, all the RATB lines of the peripherial network were removed, leading to the increace of minivans owned by private transport companies, and so far only a few of these lines have been put back.|$|R

40|$|Since the {{development}} of remote sensing satellites {{in the latter half}} of the 20 th century huge quantities of remotely sensed data have been gathered in the archives. Such amount of data poses a difficult challenge in extracting valuable information from the data, being estimated that only a small percentage of the data is currently analyzed. Furthermore, the current approach of assuring the long-term preservation of the archived data only emphasizes the problem of data analysis in order to extract useful information. In this paper we focus on a different approach, that of long-term data exploitation, by defining a framework for characterization and extraction of long-term satellite image time series (SITS), allowing us to fully exploit the informational content of data archives. The proposed framework aims towards creating automated methods for SITS extraction, allowing us to overcome the issues related to working with historical imagery, such as the co registration of images with missing or erroneous metadata, and by proposing methods that automate the evaluation of data quality, in support of enhancing the informational content of the extracted SITS. Considering the future remote sensing missions such as the Landsat 8 and the Sentinel programme, we focus on developing methods that allow us to enhance the temporal resolution of the extracted SITS by adding new data, enabling us to combine older and new information for a better understanding of the spatio-temporal evolution patterns. Considering the vast amount of spatial, spectral and temporal information embedded within SITS, we aim to identify possible applications of SITS analysis. In support of describing the SITS informational content we define spatio temporal feature descriptors and their potential of use for specific applications. The proposed methods are applied on a set of 106 Landsat TM and ETM+ datasets covering the area of <b>Bucharest</b> and Ilfov <b>county</b> in Romania, covering a timespan of over 27 years, resulting in the extraction of one of the longest satellite image time series...|$|R
