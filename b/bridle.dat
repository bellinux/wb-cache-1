5|$|As James and Scamper {{entered the}} arena that night, Scamper caught his <b>bridle</b> {{on the side}} of the gate, dislodging the Chicago screws. With no screws, the headstall broke loose from the <b>bridle</b> after she made the turn around the first barrel. When she strove for the second barrel, the <b>bridle</b> was hanging from the horse's mouth to down under his foot. Meanwhile, she is trying to hold that bit in his mouth. But coming to the third barrel, she has to turn his head loose.|$|E

5|$|Communication {{between human}} and horse is {{paramount}} in any equestrian activity; to aid this process horses are usually ridden with a saddle {{on their backs}} to assist the rider with balance and positioning, and a <b>bridle</b> or related headgear to assist the rider in maintaining control. Sometimes horses are ridden without a saddle, and occasionally, horses are trained to perform without a <b>bridle</b> or other headgear. Many horses are also driven, which requires a harness, <b>bridle,</b> and some type of vehicle.|$|E
50|$|The <b>bridled</b> nail-tail wallaby (Onychogalea fraenata), {{also known}} as the <b>bridled</b> nail-tailed wallaby, <b>bridled</b> nailtail wallaby, <b>bridled</b> wallaby, merrin, and flashjack, is a {{vulnerable}} species of macropod. It is a small wallaby found in three isolated areas in Queensland, Australia, and whose population is declining. The total population of the species is currently estimated to be less than 1,100 mature individuals in the wild.|$|R
50|$|Today, the frentera {{is seldom}} seen in English {{speaking}} countries but widely used {{elsewhere in the}} world. It is used in Spain and Portugal on serreta <b>bridles,</b> in Hungary on similar <b>bridles,</b> and in Argentina and adjacent countries on both halters and <b>bridles.</b>|$|R
50|$|In Argentina, a fiador is seen on both halters and <b>bridles,</b> often {{together}} with a frentera. In Spain it is also used on <b>bridles.</b>|$|R
5|$|By 1934, {{there was}} a large system of {{interconnected}} <b>bridle</b> paths along trails and park roads. One <b>bridle</b> path ran close by to the lake, intersecting with Mosholu Avenue, before looping around the Parade Ground and diverging in the Northwest Woods. The Van Cortlandt Golf Course also had trails, as did the Old Croton Aqueduct and near Jerome Avenue and Holly Lane. However, as the primary roads through the park such as Jerome, Grand, and Mosholu Avenues were constantly maintained and upgraded, secondary roads fell into a state of neglect. One such road was Rockwood Drive, which was closed in 1936 and became a <b>bridle</b> path.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, James and Scamper {{qualified}} for the NFR and won five go-rounds at the event. James recalled that it was Friday the 13th during the 7th go-round of the barrel racing competition when Scamper's <b>bridle</b> fell off his head during the run.|$|E
5|$|A geology party, {{headed by}} Manasseh Cutler, named the {{mountain}} in 1784. The Crawford Path, the oldest mountain hiking trail in the United States, was laid out in 1819 as a <b>bridle</b> path from Crawford Notch to the summit {{and has been in}} use ever since. Ethan Allen Crawford built a house on the summit in 1821, which lasted until a storm in 1826.|$|E

5|$|About 10 a.m., one of Desha's neighbors {{encountered}} the riderless gray mare, still rigged with saddle and <b>bridle.</b> Catching the horse, he rode {{it up the}} road, shortly finding Desha's riderless bay (which he recognized), with a saddle but no <b>bridle.</b> He noticed blood on the neck and withers of Desha's horse. Further along, the neighbor encountered Desha on foot, carrying two saddlebags. Desha {{said that he had}} just accepted the gray mare as payment from a man who owed him money. He did not volunteer how the two horses had escaped his control, but mounted the gray mare and returned home. Later that day, friends at Desha's tannery noticed that he was unusually quiet and repeatedly asked what was wrong. He said that he had been kicked by a horse and severely cut his finger in separate incidents the previous day.|$|E

5000|$|The island {{group has}} been {{identified}} as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports large numbers of breeding <b>bridled</b> terns as well as smaller numbers of other tern species. [...] Estimated numbers of <b>bridled</b> terns nesting in the four years between 1993-1999 when surveys were made varied from 5000 to 50,000. Roseate and black-naped terns nest irregularly on the northern islets while black-naped, <b>bridled</b> and roseate terns have been recorded nesting on Dudley Island.|$|R

5|$|The Church of St John the Baptist {{was built}} {{on the site of the}} former Nos.49–50 in 1885, and was consecrated on 23 November. The {{building}} cost £5,100 (now £) and catered for services in the local parish that had previously been held in rooms or temporary buildings. The church covered a district between Oxford Street, Poland Street, Brewer Street, <b>Bridle</b> Lane, Carnaby Market and Argyll Street.|$|E
5|$|At {{the third}} barrel, Scamper spit the {{bit out of}} his mouth, causing the <b>bridle</b> to drop to his chest, but he kept running full speed ahead. While running down the home stretch after the third barrel, James had nothing but a single rein around Scamper's neck with which to control him. Despite these occurrences, the pair crossed the finish line {{with a time of}} 14.4 seconds to win both the round and the 1985 World Barrel Racing Championship.|$|E

She and Scamper earned {{national}} recognition after winning the WPRA World Barrel Racing Championship consecutively from 1984 to 1993. The duo also won the National Finals Rodeo (NFR) Barrel Racing Average title seven times. They are also known for a particular moment in history when Scamper's <b>bridle</b> fell off, yet they still won the round. James retired Scamper in 1993. James retired from competition in 2003 after winning an 11th WPRA World Barrel Racing Championship.|$|E
5|$|The conquest {{strengthened}} Tang {{rule over}} modern Xinjiang, {{administered by the}} Anxi Protectorate, and led to Tang suzerainty over the regions previously {{under the control of}} the Western Turks. The fall of the Khaganate brought the Altai Mountain region under Tang control and the residing Three Qarluq tribes were governed in newly established prefectures led by tribal chiefs, now commander-in-chiefs under the Tang. Another prefecture, the Jinman <b>Bridle</b> Prefecture, was created for the Chuyue tribes living in the southern Dzungar basin. The Amu Darya valley, the Tarim Basin, and the area beyond the Pamir Mountains, all former suzerains of the Western Turks, were placed under Tang control.|$|E

40|$|The Australian <b>bridled</b> goby (Arenigobius bifrenatus) {{has been}} in New Zealand since 1996, and has {{subsequently}} spread to thirteen estuaries and the coastal Otara Lake. The native exquisite goby (Favonigobius exquisitus) may be displaced or threatened by the <b>bridled</b> goby as they share estuarine habitat. The ecophysiological tolerances and sediment preferences for both goby species were examined to determine the potential for niche overlap and habitat selection. The results of acute salinity and temperature tolerance tests supported the hypotheses that <b>bridled</b> gobies are more tolerant than exquisite gobies to extremes of salinity and temperature. The incipient ten day LT 50 values were 6. 7 C and 11. 8 C for <b>bridled</b> and exquisite gobies, respectively, however, both tolerated temperatures up to 35 C. Both species showed some mortality at low salinities, but mortality did not exceed 50 % for either species at the lowest salinity tested (2. 2 ppt) after 96 h. <b>Bridled</b> gobies displayed a strong preference for fine sediment (less than 63 um), whereas exquisite gobies were less selective, accepting {{a broad range of}} sediment grain sizes (63 - 250 um). <b>Bridled</b> gobies have successfully established and dispersed in New Zealand, and their ecophysiological adaptations that allowed them to survive harsh conditions in ballast water, their presumed introduction vector, will likely aid their future spread throughout New Zealand. Their increasing abundance is likely to see them encounter and possibly encroach on the habitat of exquisite gobies. <b>Bridled</b> gobies may displace the smaller exquisite gobies from optimal habitats, as exquisite gobies are unlikely to survive competition from and predation by <b>bridled</b> gobies. However, exquisite gobies should be able to relocate to adjacent habitat with coarse sediment that is unsuitable for burrow construction by <b>bridled</b> gobies. Additionally, acclimatisation to local environmental conditions may extend the tolerance limits determined in this thesis, and may allow <b>bridled</b> gobies to spread to upstream zones in estuaries and occupy freshwater. New Zealand presently has eight recognised gobiid species of which one is endemic, two are native, two are not recorded in mainland waters and three are proposed as non-indigenous. Additionally, several tropical and subtropical gobies exist in the aquarium trade. Similar ecophysiological tests of tolerance and preference may determine the possibility that these species could establish in the wild following accidental release...|$|R
5|$|According to legend, Varanasi {{was founded}} by the god Shiva. There {{happened}} a fight between the two supreme gods, Brahma and Shiva, and the succeeding combat resulted {{in one of the}} five heads of Brahma being torn off by Shiva. It was a custom of the time that the victor carried the slain adversary’s head in his hand and let it hang down from his hand as an act of ignominy and a sign of his own bravery. A <b>bridle</b> was also put into the mouth. Shiva thus dishonored Brahma's head, and kept it with him at all times. When he came to the city of Varanasi in this state, the hanging head of Brahma dropped from Shiva's hand and disappeared in the ground. The land of Varanasi is therefore considered an extremely holy religious site.|$|E
5|$|Ark Royal {{had entered}} refit to {{accommodate}} the Phantom in 1967; this involved a major reconstruction, including several elements to allow the ship to operate the aircraft – the flight deck was increased in area and fully angled to 8½°, the arresting gear was replaced with a new water-spray system {{to accommodate the}} Phantom's higher weight and landing speed, and <b>bridle</b> catchers and water-cooled JBDs were fitted to the catapults. Once this work was complete, Eagle was scheduled to undergo a similar modernization. In 1969, the planned refit of Eagle was cancelled, and the options for seven additional FG.1s was not taken up. As a consequence, {{it was decided to}} further reduce the FAA's Phantom fleet to just 28 aircraft. The remaining 20 aircraft were then allocated to the Royal Air Force.|$|E
5|$|In 1923, Hill {{learned of}} {{the remains of a}} Spanish saddle {{obtained}} from the George DeWitt farm in Webster County. He visited the farm, and learned from DeWitt, the son of the original homesteader, that when the land was first plowed, it was covered with Native American relics. Hill opened a grave and found a Spanish <b>bridle</b> bit and spur; across the river, on land that had never been plowed, he found traces of a camp, including rifle pits. The topography of the site closely matched Pike's description; and when Hill attempted to follow Pike's route from the site to the Arkansas River, he recognized a number of landmarks from Pike's account.|$|E
