5|$|Several urban legends exist {{regarding}} the chariot sequence. One claims that a stuntman died during filming, which Nosher Powell claims in his autobiography, and another states that a red Ferrari {{can be seen}} during the chariot race. The book Movie Mistakes claims this is a myth. Heston, in a DVD commentary track for the film, mentions that a third urban legend claims that he wore a wristwatch during the chariot race, but points out that he wore leather <b>bracers</b> up to the elbow.|$|E
5|$|When {{considering}} his appearance for Soulcalibur, different designs were considered, including {{one with a}} heavily bandaged eye and scarred appearance intended to imply his fate {{at the end of}} Soul Edge, and another modeled after his appearance in Soul Edges opening sequence, featuring a wide-brimmed hat, though both designs were rejected as the developers felt they made the character appear too thin. Elements from both were reused for Soulcalibur III, retaining the hat while giving his left eye a damaged appearance. Elements of his previous design were retained, {{with the addition of a}} green vest and <b>bracers,</b> and the lengthening of the tail of his coat to his mid-thighs. His alternate character model from Soul Edge was added as his alternate in the game, featuring minimal changes save for opening the vest to have his chest be bare.|$|E

50|$|Nicholas Oluka (born 29 May 1995), {{better known}} as Kid <b>Bracer,</b> is a music artist from London, England. The South London native has {{released}} two EPs, with his first one released on Soundcloud on 16 October 2015 of Kid On The Block EP. His debut project EP displayed Kid <b>Bracer</b> flexing on soul influenced tracks but also had a trap element to it. Kid <b>Bracer</b> keeps up the chilled out Hip Hop vibes throughout the tape with 'Dreams & Reality' ‘Icebreaker’ and ‘Like Me’, all featuring smooth singing vocals from Wade, Jordan James and Elijah Melo respectively. KidOnTheBlockEP had a touch of trapesque, bass-rich tracks on which Kid <b>Bracer</b> deliver slick bars. Kid <b>Bracer’s</b> flow is strong and on point, seeming to be rapping rapidly, alternating between speeds on tracks such as I'm Up and Jordan Wings.|$|R

25|$|Combat is action-based, {{with the}} player {{fighting}} enemies in real-time {{in a variety}} of in-game environments. During battle, the player can use light attacks—which are fast but weak—and heavy attacks—slow and more powerful. The player can evade enemy attacks, and with successfully timed button presses, can gain temporary invulnerability and launch a counterattack which deals heavy damage. The player is also assisted by a Pod, a flying robot assistant which launches customizable ranged attacks varying from simple gunfire to heavy-hitting hammer attacks. Players can access four different weapon types in battle: short swords, long swords, <b>bracers,</b> and spears. While attacking, the player can alternate between both weapon types and attacks to create combination attacks. Attacks with different weapon types can also be charged and launched for increased damage. Weapon Stories, a recurring element in both Nier and the Drakengard series, where weapons found throughout the world have unique stories attached to them, are also featured.|$|E
500|$|A {{total of}} 250 longbows were carried on board, and 172 {{of these have}} so far been found, as well as almost 4,000 arrows, <b>bracers</b> (arm guards) and other archery-related equipment. Longbow archery in Tudor England was {{mandatory}} for all able adult men, and despite the introduction of field artillery and handguns, they were used alongside new missile weapons in great quantities. On the Mary Rose, the longbows {{could only have been}} drawn and shot properly from behind protective panels in the open waist or {{from the top of the}} castles as the lower decks lacked sufficient headroom. There were several types of bows of various size and range. Lighter bows would have been used as [...] "sniper" [...] bows, while the heavier design could possibly have been used to shoot fire arrows.|$|E
500|$|During the Russian war of 1788–1790, Sweden built three hemmemas {{of a new}} design. They were {{considerably}} larger, 44.5 by 11m (146 by 36ft), and {{the number}} of oars were increased to 20 pairs. They also had some of the heaviest broadsides, even when compared with the much larger frigates of the high seas navy. The artillery officer Carl Fredrik Aschling had cooperated with Chapman to increase the main armament to twenty-two 36-pounders and two 12-pounders, which increased the draft by about 30cm (1ft). The addition of diagonal <b>bracers</b> to reinforce the hull allowed the later hemmemas to carry guns more powerful even than those on the largest sailing frigates of the high seas navy. Due to their considerable firepower and relative size, naval historian Jan Glete has described the hemmemas as [...] "super archipelago frigates".|$|E

After escaping the temple, Dark returns to the Predator ship and his ancient mask gives him data revealing the Aliens' homeworld.|$|R

2500|$|The Cumans were {{reported}} to be handsome people with blond hair, fair skin and blue eyes, and desirable women. Cuman women had a high reputation for their beauty amongst the Russian aristocracy. Robert de Clari reported that the Cumans often wore a sleeveless sheepskin vest, usually worn in conjunction with <b>bracers.</b> [...] Underneath the vest was worn a short or long sleeved tunic/tabard, extended to the mid calf, splitting {{in the front and}} back between the legs. Men wore trousers and a caftan, each fastened by a belt, which was the traditional costume. The women also wore caftans, as well as pants, dresses, and tunics shorter than those worn by men, sometimes split along the front, back, and sides. Clothes were commonly coloured deep crimson for decoration. Cuman men wore distinguishing conical felt or leather hats, pointed at the top with a broad brim (if made of felt) or a fur trim around the base (if made of leather). The brim of the hat formed a sharp angle at the front and upturned on the rear and at the sides. Women wore a large variety of head dresses and also wore conical hats but with a felt top and a cloth veil extending down the back. This veil only covered the back neck and not the hair or face; another source states that it did cover the hair and that sometimes one or two braids were visible. Women wore a variety of jewellery, such as torques, a type of neck ornament consisting of one or several metal strands attached to a ribbon or necklace and hung around the neck, and head dresses that were made of a series of silver rings on a solid, cylindrically shaped material that was fastened at the temples. The men shaved the top of their head, {{while the rest of the}} hair was plaited into several braids; they also had prominent moustaches. Other Cumans also wore their hair very long, without shaving the top. The women had their hair loose or braided with buns twisting at the side. Both men and women followed a tradition of braiding coloured ribbons into their hair. For footwear, Cuman men and women wore long leather or felt boots with support straps connected to their belt. Both men and women wore cloth or metal arm bands.|$|E
