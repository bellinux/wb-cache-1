5|$|After the {{founding}} of Night School Studio, the team set up a casting call for voice actors on Backstage. Prior to actors being cast and their lines recorded, the team had placeholder subtitles in the game. Lead engineer Bryant Cannon recalled that without the voices, he was unsure whether the game would <b>be</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> play; after the voices were added, {{he could see the}} characters as believable people having conversations. Hines directed recording sessions, allowing him to change dialogue on-the-fly if he felt material did not work when voiced by the actors. All of the actors voiced their lines separately, with their conversations in-game stitched together in post-production.|$|E
5|$|Rise of Mana was {{intended}} to reach a wide audience, gaining an attention only previously seen by Dawn of Mana in 2006. The concept of the main character switching between angelic and demonic form was suggested by Yagi. The original concept was to keep both characters in separate bodies, with the unoccupied character being controlled by the game's artificial intelligence. The team used the Photon Server middleware to develop the game's multiplayer component. The development team initially thought of creating custom middleware, but the rebuild needed {{would have taken a}} whole year, threatening the project's existence. In search of suitable middleware, the team contacted Fixer, who offered them the use of multiple options including Photon Server. Trying out Photon Server, all the problems faced by the developers were resolved within a two-month period, and the middleware's inbuilt security structure and specification match with the game persuaded the project's engineers to greenlight its use. Rise of Mana was the first Japanese game to use Photon Server. The team needed to create two different specifications for iOS and Android, as Android had higher graphical power. During the early development stage, the team thought it would <b>be</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> re-create the multiplayer elements in Secret of Mana. The initial idea was to have multiplayer available in standard quests, but this took up too much operational space to be practical, so they reduced this to raid battles. Due to the use of Photon Server, additional player characters could be fully rendered rather than appearing as ghost-like transparent helpers.|$|E

The idea for the episode was pitched by Cary, who thought it would <b>be</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> see the citizens of Springfield hallucinating. He then fleshed it out, forming its current iteration. The episode features the revelation of Homer's middle name, [...] "Jay", which is a [...] "tribute" [...] to animated characters such as Bullwinkle J. Moose and Rocket J. Squirrel from The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show who got their middle initial from Jay Ward. The name was pitched on for three days by the writers.|$|E
30|$|Responses to the {{question}} asking whether it <b>was</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> post to the SNS were mostly positive. The reasons of choosing ‘fun’ were because participants enjoyed sharing the posts. Examples of responses were ‘I like my posts being viewed by everyone’ and ‘I can get a hint from others’ posts’. In addition, operability was also given as a reason of choosing ‘fun’. Examples of answers <b>were</b> ‘it <b>was</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> hide the program’ and ‘because I can write a message’. Some {{of the reasons for}} selecting ‘fair’ were ‘because I did not have much time to use it’ and ‘I did not understand how to use’. However, as there was no relation between the operability of iPad and the answer <b>to</b> whether it <b>was</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> post to the SNS or not, we assume that operability did not affect the pleasure of posting to the SNS.|$|R

However, he thought it [...] "didn't feel right for a story partly about real events" [...] and realized it could <b>be</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> use Nixon. He believed there was something [...] "comically awkward" [...] about him, and it would be interesting for the Doctor to have to work with someone he did not like.

500|$|Review did {{note that}} the [...] "Top 40" [...] songs do not always make for {{challenging}} songs, as many featured simple chord repetition throughout the song or simply following pre-programmed electronic keyboard or drum beats. However, most songs were found to feature at least one difficult instrument portion that would <b>be</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> play. Reviews {{also noted that the}} censoring of songs in order to affirm a family-friendly rating is awkward, such as censoring the word [...] "whiskey" [...] from Don McLean's [...] "American Pie" [...] (8 times), and can ruin the enjoyment of some songs. Greg Miller of IGN further noted that these censoring are at odds with the straight-up inclusion of other songs such as [...] "Gasoline" [...] by The Airborne Toxic Event which, Miller claims, is about sex.|$|E

Penman's first mystery, The Queen's Man, was a finalist for an Edgar Award for Best First Mystery from the Mystery Writers of America. Penman explains her reasons for turning to the mystery genre after writing only historical novels: [...] "By the time I'd finished researching and writing When Christ and His Saints Slept, I was in danger of burning out. For {{the first time in nearly}} two decades, my boundless enthusiasm for the Middle Ages had begun to flag. So I decided I needed a change of pace, and since I am a long-time mystery fan, it occurred to me that a medieval mystery might <b>be</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> write. Once that idea took root, it was probably inevitable that I'd choose to write about Eleanor of Aquitaine, surely one of history's most memorable women." ...|$|E

Initially, Ward was not interested in portraying the character, because, after the cancellation of Once and Again, she wanted to spend more time with her kids, which is why she had also turned down earlier roles on [...] and Desperate Housewives.

[...] "He didn't seem to have just one way to solve a problem," [...] she said. [...] "He seemed to approach each commission thinking only of it and then develop a way to make something beautiful." [...] Ultimately, however, Kennedy made her choice based on her personal connection with Pei.

500|$|The film is Spielberg's {{third on}} the subject of alien visitation, along with Close Encounters of the Third Kind and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. Producer and {{longtime}} collaborator Kathleen Kennedy notes that with War of the Worlds, Spielberg had the opportunity to explore the antithesis of the characters brought to life in E.T. and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. [...] "When we first started developing E.T., it was a much edgier, darker story and it actually evolved into something that was more benign. I think that the edgier, darker story has always been somewhere inside him. [...] Now, he's telling that story." [...] Spielberg stated that he just thought it would <b>be</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> make a [...] "really scary film with really scary aliens", something which he had never done before. Spielberg was intent on telling a contemporary story, with Kennedy stating the story was created as a fantasy, but depicted in a hyper-realistic way.|$|E
500|$|The {{team had}} several goals: factions {{should not be}} [...] "locked-in" [...] to certain strategies; players should have {{interesting}} things to do without unbalancing the game, and the factions must <b>be</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> play. The team believed the [...] "coolness" [...] of the Progenitor aliens would determine {{the success or failure}} of Alien Crossfire. They strove to make them feel significantly different to play, but still compatible with the existing game mechanics. The developers eventually provided the aliens with Battle Ogres, a Planetary survey, non-blind research, and other powers to produce [...] "a nasty and potent race that would take the combined might of humanity to bring them down". Chris Pine modified the AI to account for the additions. The team also used artwork, sound effects, music, and diplomatic text to set the aliens apart. Other than the aliens, the Pirates proved to be the toughest faction to balance because their ocean start gave them huge advantages.|$|E

500|$|The {{game was}} overall well {{received}} by game critics. Greg Miller of IGN considered the title to be [...] "one {{of the best}} PlayStation 3 games to date". Core to the game's success, according to reviewers, were the basic mechanics of the game. [...] Giant Bomb's Brad Shoemaker considered that Sucker Punch had [...] "nailed the basic gameplay elements", tying all the {{various aspects of the}} game together. The mixture of Cole's powers with the Karma elements of the game were also praised. The powers and Karma system were seen to bring difficult choices to how the player approach battles. Both sides of the Karma system were considered to <b>be</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> play. The mission structure was considered a strong asset of the game. According to X-Play's Matt Kiel, the missions forced the player to consider the full extent of Cole's powers through their difficulty but provided [...] "generous" [...] checkpoints to prevent too much frustration with the game. Reviewers cited the variation in side missions and how they related to the main story as positive aspects of the game.|$|E
500|$|The game's {{focus on}} tactics was praised. Bertz applauded the {{tactical}} {{nature of the}} game, as it fostered communications between players. However, he noted that teamwork {{may not be possible}} if players did not have a headphone and microphone. Arthur Gies from Polygon echoed these comments, stating that the game's over-reliance on teamwork meant that when teammates were not communicating, the game would not <b>be</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> play. The [...] "No Respawn" [...] system was praised by Butterworth for making each match feel intense, as even the best player needs to think tactically in order to win. Jonathon Leack from Game Revolution enjoyed the scouting phase of a multiplayer match, which encouraged players {{to communicate with each other}} and coordinate their attacks. However, Gies noted that the placement of game objectives does not vary much, thus making the scouting phase meaningless. Both Bertz and Butterworth agreed that the game's competitive nature increases the game's replay value. Ben Griffin from GamesRadar praised the destruction mechanic for bringing tactical depth to the game.|$|E
