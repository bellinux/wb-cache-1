The access network, which connects the subscriber to the core, is highly diversified with different copper-pair, optic-fibre and wireless technologies. DTH, a relatively new <b>broadcasting</b> <b>technology</b> has attained significant popularity in the Television segment. The introduction of private FM has given a fillip to the radio broadcasting in India. Telecommunication in India has greatly been supported by the INSAT system of the country, one of the largest domestic satellite systems in the world. India possesses a diversified communications system, which links all parts of the country by telephone, Internet, radio, television and satellite.|$|E
500|$|Since Christian metal is {{very much}} a {{counterculture}} of the Christian music scene, it has never had any major corporate radio outlets, as opposed to the more accepted CCM-associated Christian music formats. Nevertheless, it has remained culturally significant in the genre, primarily enduring the test of time through word of mouth and through the help of pioneering Christian rock and metal broadcasters. Despite the lack of commercial radio support, Christian metal broadcasters have managed to hit the airwaves on public radio, campus radio, Internet radio, and in recent years through podcasting via the Internet. As digital <b>broadcasting</b> <b>technology</b> becomes more accessible, the number of Christian metal broadcasters has steadily increased. Some of today's largest non-commercial Christian alternative radio stations such as RadioU, Call FM, and Effect Radio have some Christian metal programing late nights and on weekends. However, as a whole these larger stations generally maintain a GMA-prescribed format. Other stations such as Almighty Metal Radio, Savage Rock Radio, Reign Radio, Metal Blessing Radio, The Cross Stream, The Refinery Rock Radio, www.theBlast.fm, and FuelRadio.FM have been able to maintain twenty-four-hour Christian metal formats through Internet radio. Some notable Christian metal radio DJs, shows and podcasts include: [...] "Jesus Solid Rock" [...] Show ('74 - '80) hosted by Pastor Bob Beeman, [...] "Intense Radio" [...] ('95 - present) founded by Pastor Bob Beeman and Sanctuary International, [...] "HM Podcast" [...] with HM Magazine founder & publisher Doug Van Pelt, [...] " [...] The Full Armor of God Broadcast" [...] ('97 - present) hosted by Bro Scotland Kubinski (Kuba [...] "The Demon Slayer"), [...] "Radio U Hardcore" [...] and ('02 - present) hosted by Jaddeus Dempsey (A.K.A.
