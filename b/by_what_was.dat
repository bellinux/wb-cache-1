5|$|Buttressed <b>by</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> left of {{the legacy}} from his grandmother, Richardson {{determined}} to learn to act. He paid a local theatrical manager, Frank R Growcott, ten shillings a week {{to be a member}} of his company and be taught the craft of an actor. He made his stage debut in December 1920 with Growcott's St Nicholas Players at the St Nicholas Hall, Brighton, a converted bacon factory. He played a gendarme in an adaptation of Les Misérables, and was soon entrusted with larger parts including Banquo in Macbeth and Malvolio in Twelfth Night.|$|E
5|$|Eventually {{a liberal}} agitation, pro-Greek and {{inspired}} <b>by</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> then happening in that country, {{began to develop}} in France. The longer France waited, the more delicate her position vis-à-vis Metternich became. The ultra-royalist government thus decided to accelerate events. A land expedition was proposed to Great Britain, which refused to intervene directly. Meanwhile, Russia had declared war against the Ottoman Empire and its military victories were unsettling for London, which {{did not wish to}} see the Tsarist empire extend too far south. Thus Great Britain did not oppose an intervention by France alone.|$|E

5|$|On Election Day, Goldwater {{lost the}} {{election}} to Johnson <b>by</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> then the largest margin in history. Goldwater accumulated 52 electoral votes to Johnson's 486 and 39% {{of the popular vote}} (27,178,188) to Johnson's 61% (43,129,566). Goldwater carried six states: Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, South Carolina and his home state of Arizona. Goldwater's strong showing in the south is largely due to his support of the white southern view on civil rights: that states should be able to control their own laws without federal intervention.|$|E
5|$|Ruby Laffoon (January 15, 1869March 1, 1941) was an American {{politician}} {{who served as}} the 43rd Governor of Kentucky from 1931 to 1935. A Kentucky native, at age 17 Laffoon moved to Washington, D.C., to live with his uncle, U.S. Representative Polk Laffoon. He developed an interest in politics and returned to Kentucky, where he compiled a mixed record of victories and defeats in elections at the county and state levels. In 1931, he was chosen as the Democratic gubernatorial nominee by a nominating convention, not a primary, making him the only Kentucky gubernatorial candidate to be chosen by a convention after 1903. In the general election, he defeated Republican William B. Harrison <b>by</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> then the largest margin of victory in Kentucky gubernatorial history.|$|E
5|$|From 2006 to 2013, XV was {{developed}} <b>by</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> then Square Enix 1st Production Department. In {{the wake of}} extensive business restructuring in 2013, development of XV transferred to the newly formed Business Division 2, headed by Tabata and incorporating the core Final Fantasy development team. Along with bringing in staff members from other sections of the company, they also recruited help from other development studios: HexaDrive {{was brought in to}} help with engineering the game, XPEC Entertainment helped with the design for the later sections of the game, Shanghai company Plusmile helped with the design of buildings, licensed middleware from Umbra was used to boost the game's graphics, while Streamline Studios was brought in to help with technical development. It was initially supposed, after an announcement in 2015, that Avalanche Studios was brought on board to help create the game's airship mechanics. In the event, Avalanche and Square Enix did not directly collaborate: instead, Avalanche showed them their level of detail development methods, and Square Enix's internal team created the airship mechanics using that information.|$|E

5|$|Infuriated <b>by</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> {{perceived}} {{as yet another}} affront to British prestige after the recent landings at Pontian and Labis by Indonesian volunteers in southwestern Malaysia, members of the British Cabinet, particularly Peter Thorneycroft and Louis Mountbatten, favoured sending the carrier back through the Strait {{in spite of the}} Indonesian ban. Though British naval commanders in the Far East had grave concerns that the Victorious would be indefensible while in passage, the prevailing opinion was that not to send the ship would result in an immense political defeat on both a domestic and international scale as well as the loss of rights to an important waterway. Tension mounted as the British and Indonesians each refused to bend, and as the carrier's time to sail came, war became increasingly likely.|$|E
5|$|The churchyard covers {{some two}} acres. Most of the headstones in the churchyard are modern – {{many of them}} are from the nineteenth century – but the churchyard, which is now closed to new interments, {{contains}} some old monuments. The whole churchyard and church is surrounded <b>by</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> once a typical sign of an early Celtic church; an oval formation of trees. There are also indications which suggest the remains of an early pond, probably for keeping fish for the priests and monks who once lived there. There is no visible trace of any conventual buildings (which would probably have been mostly relatively slight wooden structures, and never extensive). In the early nineteenth century Meyrick does however record the survival of what appeared to be stone monastic or church buildings.|$|E
