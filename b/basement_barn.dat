50|$|Left unrecognized and untreated, the {{interval}} between transmission of rabies virus strains until the disease manifests in the victims, varies from hours to years. Most victims {{are not aware of}} either having been bitten by a bat or exposed to a bat's secretions. This can be {{due to a lack of}} awareness of a bat's presence in the same space, such as when sleeping, not feeling the bite if aware of the bat's presence, and/or exposure to bat saliva, urine, and/or feces in closed environments. These include caves and human living spaces such as attics, <b>basements,</b> <b>barns</b> and sheds. Bats invading human living and working spaces will normally offensively attack by biting and urinating on the victim to mark the victim's location.|$|R

50|$|It {{was found}} in 1902 in Monteleone di Spoleto near Spoleto in the {{province}} of Umbria, by a farmer named Isidoro Vannozzi who inadvertently unearthed it while digging a wine cellar or <b>basement</b> <b>barn.</b> Its history from that time is the subject of controversy. According to some accounts, Vannozzi hid the chariot in his barn, concerned that the authorities might confiscate it, and later sold it to two Frenchmen in exchange for two cows. Another account, related by Vannozzi's son Giuseppe, holds that the chariot was immediately sold as scrap metal, and the proceeds from the sale used to buy roof tiles. Changing hands several times after its initial sale, the chariot was eventually purchased in Paris by J. P. Morgan, who sent it to the Metropolitan Museum in 1903, where its first restoration took place.|$|E

50|$|Built in {{the early}} 1850s by his father, the house was {{occupied}} by Hise and his wife Margaret in 1875, when they rechristened the home, Unserheim (“our home” in German), and made several alterations to the property, including construction of several hiding places for fleeing slaves. These renovations—including hidden rooms in the <b>basement</b> and a <b>barn</b> on the property—made the house a viable stop on the Underground Railroad.|$|R
50|$|Mr. Christiansen {{named the}} area Nordic Valley, {{mainly because of}} his Norwegian ancestry.

Odin Hall housed the golf shop, ski rental, snack bar and ski patrol, many parties and gatherings were held there. Before it was a lodge, it was a hay barn complete with two hay shoots that ran from the basement of the structure {{all the way to the}} roof reaching two cupola vents situated on top of the barn, tack rooms were located in the <b>basement.</b> The <b>barn</b> is still currently used as a ski lodge.|$|R

5000|$|In 1851, Strock {{sold the}} house and the {{accompanying}} 108 acre to Francis Henry. Henry was active in the Restoration (reformed Baptist) movement. The Strock Stone house was reputedly a stop on the Underground Railroad that smuggled fugitive slaves to safety in Canada. This claim has yet to be proven, but some evidence appears to support it. Austintown was listed in Galbreath's History of Ohio as part of the path of the Underground Railroad that included [...] "Salineville, New Lisbon, Canfield, Austintown, Edinburgh, Warren, Bloomfield, Rome, Lenox, Austinburg, Ashtabula Harbor." [...] William Strock's brother, John Henry Strock, was described {{as one of the first}} abolitionists in Mahoning County. Additionally, Francis Henry appears on William Seibert's 1898 list of known underground railroad operators in Mahoning County. Finally, Heffelfinger's unpublished History of Meander says that slaves were hidden in a tunnel that connected the house <b>basement</b> with the <b>barn.</b> Henry lived in the Strock Stone house with his wife, Mary, and their four children[...]|$|R
2500|$|After Alan and Dale both {{graduated}} from college they formed an aircraft company in 1984, which they named [...] "Cirrus Design" [...] (now known as Cirrus Aircraft) in remembrance of a summer drive the brothers had {{a few years back}} where they saw cirrus clouds on the horizon and wished that they were flying. Once they formed the company, the Klapmeiers called upon Alan's old college roommate, Jeff Viken, to help out with their new design: the VK-30 (VK standing for Viken-Klapmeier). Viken was an aeronautical engineer who eventually married another aeronautical engineer, Sally Viken, and the unpaid Cirrus staff grew to four volunteers (with occasional help from the Klapmeiers' high school friend, Scott Ellenberger). The Cirrus VK-30 was a four to five-seat composite pusher with conventional wings and tail. Alan and Dale moved into the family farmhouse to be closer to the project, and began work on the airplane in the <b>basement</b> of the <b>barn</b> [...] "down where the cows were". They all pitched in with the designing and balanced that with hands-on labor. Jeff designed the airfoil while Sally designed the flap system. The four of them would finish designing a part or a system, build it, and return to designing. Experimental aircraft innovator Moulton Taylor gave the Klapmeiers and Vikens technical advice surrounding the VK-30.|$|R
