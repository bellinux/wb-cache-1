5|$|On 13 June 1905, a {{passenger}} service {{began on the}} short branch to South Acton. A short fifth platform for the single car train of the South Acton branch was provided {{to the north of}} the eastbound island platform. At first the service ran to Hounslow West and to Uxbridge but it was later reduced to a shuttle between Acton Town and South Acton on 15 February 1932. The South Acton branch was closed on 28 February 1959 due to low usage; its platform at Acton Town has not been removed and is still visible. The platform is hidden behind advertising hoardings and not obvious to the casual observer. Much of the branch remains including a <b>bridge</b> <b>support</b> on the south side of Bollo Lane. In the picture, the area behind the hoarding in the background is the location of the former branch platform (Platform 5) which was only ever very short, two carriages at most.|$|E
5|$|The {{leopard shark}} captures prey by {{expanding}} its buccal cavity {{to create a}} suction force, which is facilitated by its labial cartilages swinging forward to form the mouth into a tube. Simultaneously, the shark protrudes its jaws forward to grip the prey between its teeth. As with other sharks, {{the teeth of the}} leopard shark are periodically shed and replaced; it takes 9ndash&12 days for a replacement tooth to move into position. Leopard sharks have been caught with stomachs filled with clam siphons, which the sharks seize before the clams can retract and break off with a levering motion of their bodies. On occasion, the shark tears the entire clam body out of its shell this way. Other sharks examined have had stomachs containing whole innkeeper worms with no bite marks, suggesting that the sharks sucked them out of their burrows. Under a hollow <b>bridge</b> <b>support</b> in San Francisco Bay, a group of leopard sharks and spiny dogfish have been observed feeding on a dense school of anchovies by slowly swimming counterclockwise through the clockwise-swimming school, and swallowing any anchovies that accidentally entered their open mouths.|$|E

25|$|Plans for a limited-access route {{along the}} Delaware River in the Philadelphia area {{originated}} in the 1930s when both a parkway and elevated highway were proposed; neither of these were built. The Delaware Expressway was approved in 1945 as a toll road {{that was to be}} part of the Pennsylvania Turnpike system until the project was turned to the Pennsylvania Department of Highways in 1956, with the expressway to be included in the Interstate Highway System as part of I-95. Construction on I-95 began in 1959 and was mostly complete by 1979, with the final portion near the Philadelphia International Airport finished in 1985. The route was originally projected to run through the center of Trenton, New Jersey, but was rerouted to the Scudder Falls Bridge due to limited capacity in Trenton. In March 2008, large cracks were discovered on a <b>bridge</b> <b>support</b> column in Philadelphia, requiring a two-mile section of the route to be closed for two days. Bridges are planned to be rebuilt along the section of I-95 between Center City and Woodhaven Road (Pennsylvania Route 63), and an interchange is planned to be built with the Pennsylvania Turnpike (Interstate 276) where I-95 will be rerouted to follow the Pennsylvania Turnpike to the New Jersey Turnpike and Interstate 295 will be extended along the current portion of I-95 north of the proposed interchange, with an extension of Interstate 195 having been proposed between 2005 and 2015.|$|E

2500|$|In January 2004, the {{expressway}} {{was shut}} down between Lower Nazareth Township (Route 248) and Stockertown (Route 191) because of a sinkhole {{that was in the}} area of the Bushkill Creek directly under a northbound <b>bridge</b> <b>support</b> beam. [...] Crossovers were created, narrowing the highway to one lane in each direction through Stockertown. [...] Studies were conducted, and came to the conclusion that the bridge was dangerous and could not be fixed. [...] The northbound bridge was demolished in February of the same year. [...] Just 21 days later, a sinkhole was discovered under the southbound bridge over the Bushkill Creek, and resulted in the demolition of the southbound bridge. [...] Once the new northbound bridge was completed, another crossover was created, detouring southbound traffic onto the northbound side of the highway. [...] On April 21, 2004, a depression formed under the new northbound bridge, and the highway {{was shut down}} once again to fill the area with bituminous material. [...] The bridge re-opened within twenty minutes. [...] By November 19, 2004, both bridges were completed and opened. [...] All of this happened feet from the Bushkill Street Bridge, which connects Stockertown and Palmer Township, and has been closed since 1999 because of numerous sinkholes causing the bridge to collapse.|$|E

2500|$|The {{experiments}} of William Fairbairn, and {{the mathematical}} analysis of Eaton Hodgkinson had shown {{by a series}} of experiments that an enclosed box girder, made of riveted wrought iron, combined relative lightness with great strength. The tubular wrought-iron girder – be the cross-section rectangular, triangular or circular – formed a most efficient truss component. If the cross-section was large enough it could be self-supporting. It was Fairbairn's experiments that led to the design of the Menai and Conwy bridges. Stephenson had originally proposed using a box-girder section suspended from chains. The box section would, he argued, be stiff enough to overcome the conventional problems of the bridge-decks of suspension bridges. In the event, Fairbairn showed that a properly constructed box girder would be strong enough so that the chains could be dispensed with. Nevertheless, the decision (not to use chains) was taken late in the project, so the Britannia <b>bridge</b> <b>support</b> towers were still built with holes for the chains. Stephenson's box-girders were a great innovation, and using steel or pre-stressed concrete instead of wrought iron, box-girder construction is the standard today for large bridges. But as Berridge has observed, [...] "Brunel was never one to follow fashion for fashion's sake... (at Chepstow)... Here was the real engineer at work, designing the bridge to suit the site and the best way of getting it into position".|$|E

40|$|AbstractScour of the riverbeds around <b>bridge</b> <b>supports</b> is {{the most}} {{frequent}} cause of their failures. Maintenance and repair costs of the bridges damaged by scour effects are significant, but {{it is estimated that}} the social costs are five times higher than the direct repair and replacement costs. The <b>bridge</b> <b>supports</b> are subjected to the scour effects due to the erosive action of the flowing water, involving soil loosening from the bottom and the banks of the watercourse. The condition for the proper monitoring of scour is to understand its nature. The knowledge of the phenomena occurring during the high water flow {{in the area of the}} <b>bridge</b> <b>supports</b> is crucial to properly assess the current condition and to develop proper maintenance actions. Scour may be the consequence of:•narrowing the watercourse – a natural or man-made, including construction of a bridge,•lateral movement or lowering of the stream bed,•hydraulic works shortening the length of the meandering section of the watercourse,•changes occurring in the catchment area of the watercourse,•other changes in watercourse hydrology. Construction of a bridge in the certain area disturbs natural stream flow conditions, especially the flood water and may change the terms of the normal water flow. The presence of a bridge causes the stream flow cross-section reduction, which increases the speed and intensity of erosion of the streambed. River tends to stabilize its bed in order to restore the natural flow section. <b>Bridge</b> <b>supports</b> also change the laminar water flow and turbulent flow. Scour present around a <b>bridge</b> <b>supports</b> can be monitored by the mobile and fixed devices. Portable scour monitoring devices are mainly: different types of probes such as: sticks, tape or rope with weights and bars used by divers and sonar acoustic measuring devices. Stationary equipment is used for continuous or regular scour monitoring of the <b>bridge</b> <b>supports</b> of the <b>bridge,</b> for example once a day, once a week. They are stationary devices including various types of robotic probes and stationary hydroacoustic measurement systems. Stationary device can be installed on a support or near the bridge, usually at the head of the pillar, or in the ground near the bottom of the watercourse. It should be installed near the site of the anticipated greatest scour. The device interacts with the data logger, which can be read on the site or transmitted to a remote control unit. The article presents the principles of scour monitoring near the <b>bridge</b> <b>supports,</b> developed during the project “Monitoring system for <b>bridge</b> <b>supports</b> and their surrounding areas” co-founded by the Polish National Centre for Research and Development under the program Innotech. During the project monitoring system for <b>bridge</b> <b>supports</b> was developed with specialized software for online data visualization.
