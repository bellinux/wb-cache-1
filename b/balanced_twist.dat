50|$|S/PDIF was {{developed}} {{at the same time}} as the main standard, AES3, used to interconnect professional audio equipment in the professional audio field. This resulted from the desire of the various standards committees to have at least sufficient similarities between the two interfaces to allow the use of the same, or very similar, designs for interfacing ICs. S/PDIF remained nearly identical at the protocol level, but changed the physical connectors from XLR to either electrical coaxial cable (with RCA connectors) or optical fibre (TOSLINK; i.e., F05 or EIAJ optical), both of which cost less than the XLR connection. The RCA connectors are typically colour-coded orange to differentiate from other RCA connector uses such as composite video. The cable was also changed from 110 Ω <b>balanced</b> <b>twisted</b> pair to 75 Ω coaxial cable, using RCA jacks.|$|R

40|$|Currently, the {{presence}} of significant RE noise on twisted pair loops prevents mass deployment of high-speed Digital Subscriber Loop (DSL) technology. DSL technology generally uses bandwidth within the frequency spectrum range of 10 kHz up to 10 MHz. Unfortunately this same spectrum is presently allocated for private, governmental and public radio communications. As well, due to limited cable <b>balance,</b> <b>twisted</b> pair copper cables are highly susceptible to ingress from noise sources present within the DSL frequency bandwidth. This thesis presents a new architecture to reduce radio frequency interference (RFI) noise at the receiver by exploiting the transmission characteristics of twisted pair wire. A novel technique is proposed in this thesis to reduce common-mode noise coupled into the differential mode signal of a twisted pair cable, by adding an identical but inverted version of the common mode signal component. The resulting signal is the differential mode signal without the common mode RFI noise. Simulations using Matlab shows that this technique can reduce RFI {{by as much as}} 38. 7 dB...|$|R

50|$|To {{measure the}} unknown force, the spring {{constant}} of the torsion fiber {{must first be}} known. This is difficult to measure directly because of the smallness of the force. Cavendish accomplished this by a method widely used since: measuring the resonant vibration period of the balance. If the free <b>balance</b> is <b>twisted</b> and released, it will oscillate slowly clockwise and counterclockwise as a harmonic oscillator, at a frequency {{that depends on the}} moment of inertia of the beam and the elasticity of the fiber.

High capacitance causes increasing distortion and greater loss of high frequencies as distance increases.|$|R

40|$|One way {{to create}} a new drying {{technology}} is the development and adoption by the industry of high-intensity machines with active hydrodynamic regimes, providing in many cases, higher technical and economic indicators. This principle is very successfully implemented in devices with swirling flow and particulate material. Therefore, the use of devices with twisted coolant flow to intensify the process of drying particulate materials is both theoretical interest and practical value. Amaranth seeds contain an average of 17 % protein, 8 % of oil and 4 - 5 % fiber. Because of the significant amino acid content of lysine in the protein which amaranth twice larger than that of wheat, and three times more than corn and sorghum, and compares the number with cow's milk and soy, amaranth protein quality is considered very high. Amaranth seeds are the raw material for the production of oil containing up to 8 % of squalene. On the basis of theoretical analysis of heat and mass transfer process of drying amaranth seeds in the machine with a <b>balanced</b> <b>twisted</b> layer authors developed a mathematical model of it.
