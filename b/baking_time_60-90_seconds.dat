The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of <b>baking</b> <b>time</b> and temperature on bread quality and its shelf life. In this study, the effect of three rates of oven temperature (top and under bread surface) and <b>baking</b> <b>time</b> levels on bread quality and its shelf life was investigated. <b>Baking</b> temperature and <b>time</b> were 300 and 280 °C for 3 minutes and 20 seconds, 300 and 350 °C for 2 minutes and 30 seconds and 350 and 380  °C for 2 minutes respectively. Soluble starch and staling factors of the samples were measured. The data was statistically analyzed by complete randomized design and comparison was made between the means via Duncan,s multiple range test at 5 % level. The results showed that the bread baked in various time–temperature conditions were different in moisture content. The bread baked at lower temperature and longer time had the lowest moisture. Also, the result showed that the amount of soluble starch increased by increasing the <b>baking</b> <b>time</b> and decreasing the baking temperature.

40|$|The primary {{emphasis}} {{of this study}} has been to explain how modifying a cake recipe by changing either {{the dimensions of the}} cake or the amount of cake batter alters the <b>baking</b> <b>time.</b> Restricting our consideration to the genoise, one of the basic cakes of classic French cuisine, we have obtained a semi-empirical formula for its <b>baking</b> <b>time</b> as a function of oven temperature, initial temperature of the cake batter, and dimensions of the unbaked cake. The formula, which is based on the Diffusion equation, has three adjustable parameters whose values are estimated from data obtained by baking genoises in cylindrical pans of various diameters. The resulting formula for the <b>baking</b> <b>time</b> exhibits the scaling behavior typical of diffusion processes, i. e. the <b>baking</b> <b>time</b> is proportional to the (characteristic length scale) ^ 2 of the cake. It also takes account of evaporation of moisture at the top surface of the cake, which appears to be a dominant factor affecting the <b>baking</b> <b>time</b> of a cake. In solving this problem we have obtained solutions of the Diffusion equation which are interpreted naturally and straightforwardly in the context of heat transfer; however, when interpreted {{in the context of the}} Schrodinger equation, they are somewhat peculiar. The solutions describe a system whose mass assumes different values in two different regions of space. Furthermore, the solutions exhibit characteristics similar to the evanescent modes associated with light waves propagating in a wave guide. When we consider the Schrodinger equation as a non-relativistic limit of the Klein-Gordon equation so that it includes a mass term, these are no longer solutions.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} of a multi-layer polymeric film made from a hybrid organic-inorganic bond-layer, a decorative epoxy-based basecoat and, finally, a protective polyurethane-based topcoat. The establishment of visual appearance and mechanical strength of the multi-layer polymeric films has been investigated by varying both <b>baking</b> <b>time</b> and temperature on a very wide range. Furthermore, two different two-step baking procedures (i. e., with and without full post-curing of the topcoat) were also proposed and comparatively evaluated. Improved trends of average roughness and mechanical strength of the multi-layer films were found at any <b>time</b> progressively higher <b>baking</b> <b>time</b> and/or temperature was set. Accordingly, the overall adhesion between multi-layer films and underlying metal surfaces was found to increase, as well. Nonetheless, experimental results show that even though satisfactory surface roughness and mechanical properties of the multi-layer films can be established over wide enough ranges of <b>baking</b> <b>time</b> and temperature with both baking procedures, an acceptable visual appearance is only achievable if the topcoat is superimposed at least on an almost fully cured basecoat.

40|$|The {{deposition}} of protective coatings from thermosetting polymer powders is undergoing rapid growth as an ecological, economic and energy-efficient technology. Nevertheless, {{a combination of}} conflicting needs is characterizing new formulations: (i) minimization of premature crosslinking during material production and storage; (ii) film levelling and cross-linking at the lowest possible temperature in the least possible time. We address the problem by developing an experimental study in which the evolution of film morphology and its thermal, rheological, mechanical and tribological properties are analyzed {{in the light of}} film <b>baking</b> <b>time</b> and temperature. Experimental results show that smooth films can be achieved at relatively low <b>baking</b> <b>time</b> and temperature, while film mechanical performances are not yet fully developed. In contrast, good film strength, adhesion and wear endurance can be attained, only if longer <b>baking</b> <b>time</b> or higher temperature is set. However, a generalized scratch map, which correlates the adhesion strength of the polymeric films with the thermorheological behaviour of the base material, has been also built. Our results open up the possibility of predicting best baking programs and how full film performances are progressively established with time and temperature by better understanding of the mechanisms involved in polymeric films formation from loose powders.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the correlation between the acrylamide (AA) content and the antioxidant activity (AOA) of self-prepared cookies. Cookies were baked in the laboratory under defined conditions following four different recipes. The parameters of investigation were the influence of the type and relative content of sugar (glucose and fructose) and the <b>baking</b> <b>time</b> on the AA content as well as AOA of the final products. Parameters depending on the recipe and baking conditions such as the moisture content, the total nitrogen concentration, and the colour of the products were evaluated for all samples as well. To prove the transferability of the finding gained with model cookies to samples from industry, the same measurements were performed on seven different types/brands of cookies that were purchased in local markets. A direct correlation was found between the concentration of AA and the AOA. With increasing <b>baking</b> <b>time,</b> the moisture content of the cookies decreased. The latter parameter correlated well with the AA concentration and AOA. The use of fructose enhances the concentration of AA and the AOA of the final products, when compared with the use of sucrose.

40|$|Thermal {{conductivity}} {{of a food}} {{material is}} an essential physical property in mathematical modelling and computer simulation of thermal processing. Effective thermal conductivity of non-homogeneous materials, such as food matrices, can be determined experimentally or mathematically. The aim of the following research was to compare the thermal conductivity of short pastry biscuits, at different baking stages (60 - 160 min), measured by a line heat source thermal conductivity probe and estimated {{through the use of}} thermo-physical models. The measures were carried out on whole biscuits and on powdered biscuits compressed into cylindrical cases. Thermal conductivity of the compacted material, at different <b>baking</b> <b>times</b> (and, consequently at different moisture content), was then used to feed parallel, series, Krischer and Maxwell-Eucken models. The results showed that the application of the hot wire method for the determination of thermal conductivity is not fully feasible if applied directly to whole materials due to mechanical changes applied to the structure and the high presence of fats. The method works best if applied to the biscuit component phases separately. The best model is the Krischer one for its adaptability. In this case the value of biscuit thermal conductivity, for high <b>baking</b> <b>time,</b> varies from 0. 15 to 0. 19 Wm – 1 K – 1, while the minimum, for low <b>baking</b> <b>time,</b> varies from 0. 11 to 0. 12 Wm – 1 K – 1.

40|$|Background: Labeling {{of major}} food allergens is {{mandatory}} {{for the safety}} of allergic consumers. Although enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, polymerase chain reaction, and mass spectrometry are sensitive and specifi c instruments to detect trace amounts of food proteins, they cannot measure the ability of food constituents to trigger activation of mast cells or basophils. Aim: We evaluated the basophil activation test as an instrument to determine the allergenic potential of trace amounts of food allergens in complex matrices. Peanut (Arachis hypogaea) allergy was selected as a proof-of-concept model. Methods: The study population comprised 5 severely peanut-allergic patients (3 males/ 2 females; median age, 12 years) all sensitized to 3 major peanut allergens (Ara h 1, Ara h 2, and Ara h 3) and 5 peanut-tolerant individuals (2 males/ 3 females; median age, 8 years). Basophils from patients and controls were stimulated with pure peanut extract and blank and peanut-spiked (0. 1, 0. 01, and 0. 001 ppm) biscuits (<b>baking</b> <b>time</b> 11, 16, 21, 26 minutes) and chocolate extracts. Results: Blank biscuits and chocolate did not induce cell activation in patients or controls. A comparison between patients and controls showed signifi cantly higher activation of basophils after stimulation with 0. 1 and 0. 01 ppm of peanut-spiked biscuit at all <b>baking</b> <b>times</b> and peanut-spiked chocolate (P<. 05). Conclusions: The basophil activation test is a highly sensitive and specifi c tool to detect traces of functionally active food allergens. For biscuits, its accuracy seems independent of <b>baking</b> <b>time.</b> Furthermore, it allows even the most sensitive patients to be included in study protocols. JRC.

Second. metal substrates, made from low carbon steel (AISI 1040), were EFB coated and baked at several <b>baking</b> <b>time</b> and temperatures. Combined analyses of scanning electron and confocal microscopes were led to measure the evolution of the films surface morphology under different baking conditions.
