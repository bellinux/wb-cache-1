40|$|The European Union (EU) {{provides}} {{grants to}} disadvantaged regions of member states from two pools, the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund. The main {{goal of the}} associated transfers is to facilitate convergence of poor regions (in terms of per-capita income) to the EU average. We use data at the NUTS 3 level from the last two EU <b>budgetary</b> <b>periods</b> (1994 – 1999 and 2000 – 2006) and generalized propensity score estimation to analyze to which extent the goal of fostering growth in the target regions was achieved with the funds provided {{and whether or not}} more transfers generated stronger growth effects. We find that, overall, EU transfers enable faster growth in the recipient regions as intended, but we estimate that in 36 % of the recipient regions the transfer intensity exceeds the aggregate efficiency maximizing level and in 18 % of the regions a reduction of transfers would not even reduce their growth. We conclude that some reallocation of the funds across target regions would lead to higher aggregate growth in the EU and could generate even faster convergence than the current scheme does...|$|R

This bachelor´s work is focused on the study of economy and services provided by the Staroměstská Social Services Centre, a non-profit organisation. When the new Act came into force, two <b>budgetary</b> <b>periods</b> have been analysed and viewed from the aspect of radical changes which the Act has brought. The aim {{of this study is to}} find out how much the new Social Services Act affects the economy of the Staroměstská Social Services Centre. This study contains mostly the financial analyses of the budget, costs and yields, structure and state of the staff and financial sources of the organisation. Secondary and factual analyses of adequate document data have been applied in this study. I have used such reliable documents such as the document of foundation of the organisation, cost calculations, economy analyses, grant requests and personnel data.

40|$|EU {{regional}} policy is in a challenging and dynamic period of change. Not only are there significant administrative problems to overcome {{in both the}} current and the new Member States, {{but there is also}} a major ongoing debate about the reform of EU {{regional policy}} after 2006. Post 2006, the principal challenge concerns economic and social cohesion in an enlarged Union. Enlargement will lead to a severely unbalanced EU territory in terms of the widening disparities between Member States and regions. The degree to which EU regional policy can meet these challenges will be determined by <b>budgetary</b> constraints. The <b>period</b> of successive increases in EU regional policy ended at the Berlin Council in March 1999. Aspects of the current debate concern not only the EU regional policy budget for 2007 - 2013 but also the possible allocations. In this context, the paper has two main objectives: a) To identify regional disparities in the forthcoming enlarged Europe using multivariate statistical analysis techniques. b) To assess different proposals arising from the Commission open debate on future Cohesion Policy. The data used in the analysis is Newcronos-REGIO database elaborated by EUROSTAT. As a result, a classification of all regions (NUTsII) in the EU- 25 is obtained through factor and cluster analysis techniques. Results obtained show that regional disparities cannot be exclusively explained by GDP per capita. Other factors linked to the behaviour of the labour market and to the demographic characteristics of the territories are also of a great importance Key words: Economic and Social Cohesion, Regional Policy, Cluster Analysi...|$|R
40|$|This audit {{assessed}} {{the effectiveness of}} the Parliamentary Budget Office in conducting its role since being established in July 2012. Audit objective, criteria and scope The audit objective was to assess {{the effectiveness of the}} Parliamentary Budget Office in conducting its role since being established in July 2012. In order to form a conclusion against this audit objective, the ANAO adopted the following high level criteria: 	effective governance and administrative arrangements were established, to support the delivery of services to the Parliament; 	sound and timely processes facilitated the conduct of the PBO’s key functions within and outside of the caretaker period; and 	performance was monitored, reviewed and reported. The audit focused on the functions of the PBO including arrangements in place to prepare costings, and whether these arrangements had been consistently followed. The audit did not independently cost any of the policies, or other work costed by the PBO but did consider the views of Treasury and Finance in relation to PBO policy costings that were subsequently prepared for the 2014 Budget process. This audit has been conducted under subsection 15 (1) of the Auditor‑General Act 1997. In conducting this audit, the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) was mindful of the Parliamentary Service Act, which allows the JCPAA to request an independent review of the operations of the PBO, to be completed within nine months after a general election. The ANAO briefed the JCPAA on the planning for this audit—its objective, criteria and expected tabling date (planned for completion within nine months of the general election held on 7 September 2013). In conducting the audit, the ANAO was aware of the Government’s National Commission of Audit and its terms of reference, which included identifying options for strengthening Commonwealth budgeting arrangements, incorporating an examination {{of the role of the}} PBO. The Commission’s report was released publicly on 1 May 2014. The report contained a recommendation for the Government to adopt a high‑level fiscal strategy with fiscal rules which set out how a fiscal strategy will be achieved (Recommendation 1). With reference to the PBO, the Commission recommended that the PBO reports the Government’s progress against the fiscal rules following the release of the Final Budget Outcome each year (Recommendation 2). The Government has not yet responded to these recommendations, however, the additional function for the PBO suggested in Recommendation 2 would be consistent with one of the four key features of effective IFIs identified by the IMF, and with the functions performed by 11 of the 17 OECD countries’ IFIs. Overall conclusion Prior to the establishment of the PBO in July 2012, there was no independent body in Australia that specialised in the research and analysis of fiscal policy for the Federal Parliament. At this time, there were also limited resources for non‑government political parties, individual and independent members of parliament to have policies costed outside of the caretaker period for a general election. The establishment of the PBO was expected to: help level the playing field for all parliamentarians by providing non‑partisan access to policy costings (outside of and during the caretaker <b>period),</b> <b>budgetary</b> and fiscal policy analysis; and improve the transparency of Australia’s budgetary frameworks. Since commencing operation in July 2012, the PBO has effectively undertaken its statutory role and is already well regarded as an authoritative, trusted and independent source of budgetary and fiscal policy analysis. The PBO has made a significant contribution to levelling the playing field for all parliamentarians. Stakeholders consulted during the course of this audit all agreed that, for the first time, all parliamentarians have access to independent policy costing and information request services during all periods of the parliamentary cycle. In addition, parliamentary and peer group stakeholders viewed the costings prepared by the PBO as being of high quality, and those involved in the costing process agreed that the PBO was professional to deal with. These stakeholders also agreed that the PBO’s work has improved the transparency around election commitments, and facilitated a more informed public debate about budgetary matters that has the potential to increase as the PBO releases further information and the public becomes better educated about these topics...|$|R

40|$|Agriculture {{in former}} {{agricultural}} societies had {{significant influence on}} the economy and social life of the countryside. Developing industrialization, which caused general lagging of the countryside, diminished this influence. Gradually, under the principles of integrity, new policies and programmes were modelled for advanced development of rural areas and agriculture gained new, extended meaning in these concepts. In addition to its economic function, new functions were attributed, such as: ecological, social and cultural, but also the settling function. Due to multifunctionality of agriculture, tendencies toward equal integration of agriculture in each rural developmental plan on the local, regional and state level appeared. The paper presents the course of consciousness building about the multifunctionality of agriculture and its part in the rural development of West European countries as well as Slovenia, in the time frame from the Second World War {{to the beginning of the}} EU <b>budgetary</b> <b>period</b> 2007 – 2013.

40|$|The 2001 / 42 /CE Directive on the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) gives {{environmental}} monitoring {{a very important}} role. Monitoring activities should allow the actual effects of the program to be tested against those predicted in the SEA and help ensure that problems arising during implementation, {{whether or not they}} were originally predicted, could be identified and that the appropriate actions could be taken. The few published studies on environmental assessment of transport infrastructure programs highlight different monitoring types and approaches which often are not adequate for the purposes of the SEA Directive.

40|$|The {{regions of}} the European Union and {{the people living in}} them are not all equally well off in {{economic}} and social terms. Because problems of regional development are quite important in members states, especially in new members countries, the EU undertakes effort to ensure that all regions and their citizens can take full and proportionate advantage of the European Single Market. According to article 158 of the Treaty on European Union the Community shall develop and pursue its action leading to the strengthening of its economic and social cohesion in order to promote its overall harmonious development. In particular, the Community shall aim at reducing disparities between the levels of development of the various regions and the backwardness of the least favored regions or islands, including rural areas (1). In order to stimulate economic activity in the less developed regions, private– sector investment needs to be supplemented by financed from the EU budget public actions.

40|$|Background: Chile has a National Health Services System, {{formed by}} 29 Health Services. An {{efficient}} resource distribution among this services {{is crucial for}} an efficient health care delivery. Aim: To obtain indices from the Chilean Public Health Services, that could improve allocation of resources. Material and methods: Information from the Chilean Public Health Services, corresponding to activities during 2001 <b>budgetary</b> <b>period,</b> was collected. This is the latest complete and official information for the totality of Health Services in the country. Seventeen variables generated or monitored by the Instituto Nacional de Estadísticas (INE), the Ministerio de Salud (MINSAL), the Ministerio de Hacienda, the Ministerio de Planificación y Cooperación (MIDEPLAN) and the Fondo Nacional de Salud (FONASA) were studied. The Main Components Analysis (ACP) was used, obtained from the R correlation matrix. Results: The first two main components were selected, with an accumulated percentage of explained variability of 63. 05 %. The first component {{is related to the}} population assigned to each Health Service. This corresponds to the number of people needed to treat in the hospitals of these Services and their answer to this demand, justified by the expenses in which each Health Service incurs. There is an inverse relation of the first component with health indicators, measured by burden of disease and death. The second main component would represent the social and economic characteristics of the population, poor and ery poor populations and public health insurance beneficiaries, to take care of in each Health Service. Conclusions: Health indicators in each Health Service are not considered a priority for resource distribution among Health Services in the country. The transference is done considering the indices contained in the two main components defined (Rev Méd Chile 2004; 132 : 1532 - 42) ...|$|E
40|$|For {{over two}} decades, Scotland {{has been a}} major {{beneficiary}} of the regional policy of the European Union (EU). By 2006, it is expected that Scotland will have received around £ 7 billion under the Structural Funds since the inception of ERDF in 1975. During the 1990 s, when Structural Fund expenditure in Scotland was at its maximum, some two thirds of the Scottish population were covered by areas eligible for EU regional policy support, averaging over £ 250 million per year. In the current budget planning period (2000 - 2006), Scotland will receive a total of £ 1, 094 million for the various EU-funded programmes now under way. This European funding is now under threat. As the EU prepares for enlargement to take in up to 12 new members over the next decade, plans are being made to redirect Structural Funds to the poorer countries of Central and Eastern Europe. Many of these countries have income levels well below those of the EU Member States, with extensive poverty, underdevelopment and industrial dereliction. Tackling these problems will be the priority for future EU regional policy, with any remaining available Structural Funds going largely to the present less-developed countries of the EU - Greece, Portugal and Spain. Without an increase in EU budgetary resources, it seems unlikely that the richer EU Member States, including the UK, can expect to receive much, or maybe any, funding under EU regional policy, {{after the end of the}} current <b>budgetary</b> <b>period</b> in 2006.
