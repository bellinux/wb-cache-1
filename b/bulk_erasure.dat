50|$|The Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) erased much of {{its early}} output. Much of the videotaped ABC {{programme}} material from the 1960s and early 1970s was erased {{as part of an}} economy policy instituted in the late 1970s in which old programme tapes were surrendered for <b>bulk</b> <b>erasure</b> and reuse. This policy particularly targeted older programmes recorded in black-and-white, leading to the loss of many recordings made before early 1976, when the real reason is that Australian television converted to colour. The ABC continued erasing older television output until the late 1970s.|$|E

A device’s declared storage capacity and the total amount of information that can be written to it over its lifetime thus jointly characterize it. Write-once memory (WOM) coding permits a trade-off between these, enabling multiple writes between erasures. The guaranteed (over data) number of such writes is presently considered the important measure. We observe that given the typical endurance (104 - 105 for Flash), the actual write capacity is very close to its mean value with extremely high probability, rendering the mean number of writes between erasures much more interesting than its guaranteed value in any practical setting. For the Linear WOM code, we derive the write capacity CDF, and show that even the nearly guaranteed number of writes between erasures is substantially larger than the guaranteed one. Based on this, we present Piecewise Linear WOM code, whereby a page is partitioned into numerous independent WOM segments (whose writes must all succeed), permitting a flexible storage/write capacity tradeoff. We show that the aforementioned behavior is preserved. Finally, we outline an extension to Multi-Level cells...|$|E
