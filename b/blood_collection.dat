40|$|Background: Venous <b>blood</b> {{specimen}} <b>collection</b> is {{a common}} health care practice that has to follow strict guidelines, non-compliance among sampling staff may compromise patient safety. We evaluated a large-scale 2 h educational intervention that emphasised guideline adherence to assess possible improvements of venous <b>blood</b> specimen <b>collection</b> practices. Methods: <b>Blood</b> specimen haemolysis is usually caused by inadequate venous <b>blood</b> specimen <b>collection</b> and handling, reflecting overall pre-analytical handling. We monitored haemolysis of serum samples with haemolysis index corresponding to ≥ 150 mg/L of free haemoglobin for specimens sent from 11 primary health care centres and analysed on a Vitros 5, 1 clinical chemistry analyser before (2008, n= 6652 samples) and after (2010, n= 6121 samples) the intervention. Results: The total percentage of haemolysed specimens was 11. 8 % compared to 10. 5 % (p= 0. 022) before the intervention. As groups, rural primary health care centres demonstrated a significant reduction [Odds ratios (OR) = 0. 744] of haemolysed specimens after intervention, whereas urban primary health care centres demonstrated a significant increase (OR= 1. 451) of haemolysis. Conclusions: A large-scale 2 h educational intervention to make venous <b>blood</b> specimen <b>collection</b> staff comply with guideline practices had minor effects on collection practices. Educational interventions may be effective in wards/care centres demonstrating venous <b>blood</b> specimen <b>collection</b> practices with larger deviations from guidelines...|$|R

30|$|Due to its {{intrinsically}} {{high contrast}} resolution, {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) provides an excellent visualisation of the normal post-prostatectomy anatomy and of possible neoplastic recurrence [9]. In the emergency setting, the use of MRI is limited by lengthy examination time, scanner availability, constraints and artefacts in acutely ill patients.

25|$|Much of {{the current}} spread of the human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) in China has been through intravenous drug use and prostitution. In China, {{the number of people}} affected by HIV has been estimated at between 430,000 and 1.5 million; somewhere below or around 0.1% of the population. The CIA World Factbook as of 2012 estimated the percentage of adults (aged 15–49) living with HIV/AIDS in China at 0.1%, the same as in Japan and less than in many European Union countries such as the United Kingdom (0.2%) and Austria (0.3%). According to a United Nations report in 2001, the main distributors of HIV were the sharing of needles among drug users and problems during blood donations. In many rural areas of China during the 1990s, for example, faulty <b>blood</b> <b>collection</b> programs infected {{a large number of people}} with HIV.|$|E

2500|$|Henan {{has still}} not, however, entirely shed its {{reputation}} as an economic backwater. In recent years the prevalence of [...] "selling blood" [...] (blood donations for payment) among poor villagers has put Henan in the national spotlight. It was exposed that AIDS villages, {{where most of the}} population is HIV positive, exist in Henan. In many rural areas of China during the 1990s, particularly in the province of Henan, tens to hundreds of thousands of farmers and peasants were infected with HIV through participation in state-run <b>blood</b> <b>collection</b> programs in which contaminated equipment was reused. The initial cover up of the crisis by local officials, followed by the national exposure, has put Henan in a somewhat negative spotlight.|$|E

2500|$|Newborn {{screening}} programs {{participate in}} quality control programs {{as in any}} other laboratory, with some notable exceptions.

[...] This source of variation has been eliminated in most newborn screening programs through standardization of approved sources of filter paper for use in newborn screening programs. [...] In most regions, the newborn screening card (which contains demographic information as well as attached filter paper for <b>blood</b> <b>collection)</b> is supplied by the organization carrying out the testing, to remove variations from this source.|$|E
2500|$|Some parents {{choose to}} have this blood {{diverted}} from the baby's umbilical blood transfer through early cord clamping and cutting, to freeze for long-term storage at a cord blood bank should the child ever require the cord blood stem cells (for example, to replace bone marrow destroyed when treating leukemia). This practice is controversial, with critics asserting that early cord blood withdrawal {{at the time of}} birth actually increases the likelihood of childhood disease, due to the high volume of blood taken (an average of 108ml) in relation to the baby's total supply (typically 300ml).
