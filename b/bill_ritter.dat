5000|$|During season six of The Mary Tyler Moore Show, Moore {{appeared}} in a musical/variety special for CBS titled Mary's Incredible Dream, which featured Ben Vereen.

In the 1978-79 season, Moore attempted to try the musical-variety genre by starring in two unsuccessful CBS variety series in a row: Mary, which featured David Letterman, Michael Keaton, Swoosie Kurtz and Dick Shawn in the supporting cast. CBS canceled the series.

25|$|Most Coloradans {{are native}} {{to other states}} (nearly 60% {{according}} to the 2000 census), and this {{is illustrated by the}} fact that the state did not have a native-born governor from 1975 (when John David Vanderhoof left office) until 2007, when <b>Bill</b> <b>Ritter</b> took office; his election the previous year marked the first electoral victory for a native-born Coloradan in a gubernatorial race since 1958 (Vanderhoof had ascended from the Lieutenant Governorship when John Arthur Love was given a position in Richard Nixon's administration in 1973). In the 2016 election, the Democratic party won the Colorado electoral college votes.|$|E
